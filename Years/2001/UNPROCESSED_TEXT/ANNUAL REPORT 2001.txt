from an ATM in Maastricht a few minutes into 1 January 2002.The euro cash changeover in the 12 euro area Member States was a historic event. The14 dividing pages between the chapters of this Annual Report feature scenes from the cashchangeover drawn from a collection of photographs commissioned by the European Central

Bank. The work of photographer Claudio Hils, they depict preparations across the euroarea, ranging from the design and production of the euro banknotes and coins to 
-dayitself on 1 January 2002.Foreword2In this foreword to the Annual Report 2001,I should first like to mention the euro cash
changeover, which started on 1 January 2002
and which represents an important milestonein the European monetary integration
process. It went far more smoothly than

could have been expected and the nationalbanknotes were largely withdrawn wellbefore 1 March, the date on which the last
remaining legacy currencies of the euroceased to be legal tender in any of the euro
area countries. I should like to express my
sincere gratitude to all citizens of the euroarea, who accepted the new euro cash withenthusiasm, and to the financial and economic
agents that contributed to making the cashchangeover a success. After three years of
existence, the euro Œ with the introduction
of the banknotes and coins Œ finally became a
tangible reality for more than 300 millioneuro area citizens.
The euro cash changeover followed a year in
which inflation in the euro area, measured in
terms of the Harmonised Index of ConsumerPrices (HICP), was 2.5%, 0.2 percentagepoint higher than in 2000. The slight increase
in inflation last year was mainly due
to developments in the more volatilecomponents of the HICP, namely energy andunprocessed food. The knock-on effects ofthe increase in energy prices and thedepreciation of the effective exchange rate of
the euro in 2000, as well as the consequencesof the spread of livestock diseases in anumber of euro area countries on the prices

of unprocessed food, were among the main
factors contributing to the increase in theinflation rate, which reached its peak in May
2001 (3.4%), and then gradually declined to2.0% in December (in year-on-year terms).This turnaround was mainly a result of the
gradual unwinding of the factors that hadgenerated inflationary pressures in late 2000and in the first months of 2001. In early 2002,
inflation increased somewhat, owing to baseeffects, increases in indirect taxes in somecountries and adverse weather conditions.
However, the impact on price developmentsof the euro cash changeover appeared to besmall or even negligible.In the course of last year, the overall risks toprice stability gradually declined. Economic
conditions in the euro area worsened as a
result of the global economic slowdownwhich started to materialise at the end of
2000. The terrorist attacks in the UnitedStates increased uncertainty and prolongedthe economic downturn. Against the
background of declining inflationary risks inthe euro area, the Governing Council of theEuropean Central Bank (ECB) decided to
lower the key ECB interest rates four timesin the course of last year, by a total of150 basis points. Since 8 November 2001,

the Governing Council has kept the key ECBinterest rates unchanged, at levels appropriate
for the maintenance of price stability over
the medium term, with the minimum bid rateat 3.25%. Although annual M3 growth rose tohigh levels in late 2001, this development

was not considered to be a threat to theprospects for price stability in the euro area.Rather, it had to be seen primarily in the
context of substantial financial marketuncertainty in the second half of 2001. At theturn of the year the first signs emerged of
renewed growth in the euro area economy.While the strength of the economic recovery
remains subject to some uncertainty at the3current juncture, conditions are in place inthe euro area to ensure that a recovery willtake place.The worsening of economic conditions in thecourse of 2001, in combination with those
factors that had temporarily increasedinflation rates in the early part of the year,presented major challenges for the conduct
of monetary policy in the euro area.Nevertheless, 2001 ended with the prospect
of inflation soon being in line with the ECB™s
definition of price stability, an annual increasein the inflation rate of below 2% and a positiveoutlook suggesting that price stability would

prevail in the medium term.
In this respect, the level of long-term interestrates in the euro area indicates that financialmarkets have confidence in the determinationand ability of the ECB to maintain price
stability in the medium and longer term. Inaddition, various indicators of the inflationexpectations of economic agents have clearly
shown that the credibility of the ECB with
regard to delivering price stability in themedium term is very high. This, in turn, is

reflected in the relatively low degrees of
inflation uncertainty prevailing in the euroarea, as can be seen, for example, from the
structural reduction in inflation risk premiain the euro area, which illustrates veryconvincingly the real economic benefits which

the euro area has derived from the consistentpursuit of stability-oriented policies over theyears.The economic downturn in the euro area in2001 also presented challenges for fiscal
policy. The average budget deficit of thecountries that have adopted the euroincreased last year to 1.3% of GDP, as a
result of both the working of automaticstabilisers and the implementation of majortax cuts in some euro area countries. It was
the first time since 1993 that the overall fiscalposition of the euro area had deteriorated.As a result, most countries failed to meet
the targets laid down in their stability
programmes, submitted in late 2000. Onaverage, these targets were missed by 0.7%of GDP. The rules of the Stability and GrowthPact allow, in principle, for automaticstabilisers to work if economic growth
deviates from its trend rate. If countries haveachieved, over the medium term, a balanced
budget or a surplus, it is very unlikely that
normal business cycle fluctuations would leadthe budget deficit to exceed 3% of GDP,which is the threshold laid down in the

Treaty. This is why it is so important thatthose countries that have not yet achieved abalanced budget or surplus over the medium
term should try to do so as soon as possible.In this respect, the Stability and Growth Pactwas put under strain in the course of last
year and early this year, but it kept working.If countries were not to adhere to theStability and Growth Pact and were to fail to
use the economic recovery to improve theirfiscal position substantially, the credibility offiscal policy in the euro area would be

seriously impaired. This would not only haveadverse consequences for medium-termeconomic growth, but would also make the
monetary policy task of maintaining pricestability more difficult.
2001 also marked the tenth anniversaryof the conclusion of the negotiationson the Treaty on European Union. The

macroeconomic policy framework laid downin this Treaty has served the European Unionand the euro area well. Following the ill-fated
experiences of the 1970s and 1980s, thedrafters of the Treaty realised that monetaryand fiscal policy should not be geared towards
fine-tuning economic activity, but shouldrather create a stable macroeconomicenvironment. Only in this way can they make
a lasting contribution to economic growth.For this reason, monetary policy should serveto maintain price stability, while fiscal policy

should aim to ensure sound public finances.In the same vein, the rate of potential growthin the euro area, estimated by the ECB at 2%to 2.5% per annum, can be raised only bystructural reforms aimed at improving the
functioning of markets. A more flexible labourmarket and continued wage moderation arealso of paramount importance in reducing4the unacceptably high level of unemployment,which amounted to 8.3% last year. In thecourse of last year, a number of initiatives
were taken (in particular as regards productmarkets), some of which stemmed from the
Lisbon European Council in March 2000, at
which the importance of structural reformsto promote economic growth and reduceunemployment in the European Union was
emphasised. However, overall progress inthese areas has to be speeded up. Indeed, themain challenge for the European Union and
the euro area in the years to come is tomake substantial progress with such
structural reforms.The replacement of national currencies bythe euro raises important issues concerning

the distribution of monetary income in theEurosystem, i.e. the ECB and the nationalcentral banks (NCBs) of the Member States

participating in the euro area, whichcollectively perform the central bankingfunctions for the area as a whole. Against

this background, the Governing Council
decided, in December last year, on the
issuance of euro banknotes and the allocation

of monetary income. According to thisdecision, the ECB will issue, as from 2002,8% of the total euro banknote requirement,

while the issuance of the remaining 92% is tobe divided between the NCBs of theEurosystem in accordance with their shares

in the ECB™s capital. The seigniorage incomeearned by the NCBs on euro banknotesissued will be included in the monetary
income, which has to be pooled andredistributed in accordance with theprovisions laid down in the Statute of the
European System of Central Banks and of theEuropean Central Bank. In order to mitigate
its impact on the relative financial positions
of the NCBs, the new regime will be phased
in progressively during a transitional periodwhich will end in 2007. As from 2008, all

monetary income earned will be distributedamong the NCBs in accordance with theirshares in the ECB™s capital.
At the end of 2001 the number of staff
employed by the ECB from all 15 MemberStates stood at 1,043, with total budgetedstaff positions at 1,118.5. This compares with941 staff employed at the end of 2000. The
ECB™s budget for 2002 envisages increasingthe number to slightly over 1,150 in the
course of the year. In the light of the
experience gathered during the first threeand a half years of the existence of the ECB,a number of organisational changes were
made. In order to enhance the synergybetween business areas, the Executive Board
of the ECB decided to change the
responsibilities of individual Executive Boardmembers. Moreover, some changes weremade in the functions of the ECB business

areas. These changes are reflected in the neworganisation chart of the ECB.In 2001 the ECB made a net profit of1,822 million.This Annual Report summarises the activitiesof the European System of Central Banks andthe Eurosystem in 2001. It also reports on

monetary policy in 2001 and early 2002 andhighlights the many issues, sometimes of atechnical nature, that arose in establishing
and consolidating the Eurosystem as the
ﬁcentral bankﬂ of the euro area.I should like to conclude this foreword byreturning to the historic event that closedthe past year and marked the beginning of
this year. Indeed, the introduction of the eurobanknotes and coins not only represents thefinal phase of the monetary integration
process, but also gives fresh impetus to
European economic and financial integration.First, the increased price transparency as a
result of the euro cash changeover willencourage more cross-border trade andcommerce and, therefore, competition.
Second, people will become more aware thatthe Single Market is not complete: regulatory,
administrative and legal impediments to trade
in goods, to the provision of cross-borderservices and to the mobility of labour stillexist. The introduction of the euro Œ one

reason for which was to ﬁcrownﬂ the
establishment of the Single Market Œ will thushelp to highlight these obstacles and stimulate5attempts to eliminate them. Indeed, nowthat the governments of the euro areahave voluntarily relinquished their national
currency, and the citizens of the euro areawill be able to reap the economic benefits ofusing one single currency in an enlarged

economic area, these citizens will ask why itis possible to have a single currency but notto eliminate other barriers between the
countries of the euro area. In other words,
European integration might become more ofa ﬁbottom-upﬂ process, initiated by the
citizens of Europe, and less of a ﬁtop-downﬂprocess driven by politicians and experts. Itis rare for central bankers to have a hand in

events such as the euro cash changeover,which can fundamentally reshape societies andtheir economies. I have had the great privilege
of presiding over the Eurosystem as suchevents unfolded, and I should like to takethis opportunity to express my gratitude to,and pride in, all the thousands of colleagues
in the ECB and NCBs, who have turnedthe solemn contract and intention of theEuropean nations at Maastricht into an
everyday reality.Frankfurt am Main, March 2002

Chapter IEconomic developmentsand monetary policy81Overview: monetary policy decisions in 2001
In 2001, monetary policy in the euro areawas conducted in a challenging environment.One of the most difficult tasks faced bythe Governing Council of the ECB was
the prompt and accurate assessment of agradually changing growth outlook in the euroarea, stemming mainly from the global
economic slowdown and the impact of oiland food price rises on real disposableincome. This task was made harder by the
global shock related to the terrorist attacks
in the United States on 11 September, whichincreased uncertainty and aggravated the
economic slowdown already taking place inthe world economy and the euro area. Theconduct of monetary policy was further
complicated by the short-term inflationarypressures related to the lagged effects ofthe increases in import prices in 2000
and the impact of livestock diseases onunprocessed food inflation in early 2001. Inthis environment, the Governing Council
™sinterest rate decisions were aimed atmaintaining price stability over the mediumterm based on the assessment of the outlook
under the two pillars of the monetary policystrategy of the ECB.At the start of 2001, the key ECB interestrates were those prevailing since 5 October2000, when the Governing Council had
increased them by 25 basis points. On that
occasion, consistent with an assessment thatpointed to the existence of upward risks to

price stability, the rate on the mainrefinancing operations of the Eurosystem wasincreased to 4.75%, and the rates on the
marginal lending facility and the deposit facilitywere raised to 5.75% and 3.75% respectively(see Chart 1). Reflecting the increase in oil

prices as well as the depreciation of theexchange rate of the euro in 1999 and mostof 2000, inflation had remained above levels

compatible with price stability for some
months. Most forecasts at that time expected
economic growth both in the euro area and
abroad to remain strong. This increasedthe risk that the rise in inflation wouldhave a longer-lasting impact on inflation viasecond-round effects through wages. Inaddition, developments in monetary andcredit aggregates indicated risks of upwardinflationary pressures in a context of still
robust growth.In the course of 2001, the balance of risks toprice stability gradually shifted downwards.With regard to the first pillar, M3 growth,which had already started to decline in the
course of 2000, decreased further in early2001. This deceleration was mainly attributable
to a pronounced decline in the expansion of

the most liquid components of M3, whichreflected the impact of the gradual increasein the key ECB interest rates since November
1999. The annual growth rate of loans tothe private sector also declined from thebeginning of 2001. The moderation in monetary
and credit aggregates indicated that the risksto price stability stemming from the monetaryside were becoming more balanced.At the end of 2000, there had also beenpreliminary indications that the official
monetary growth figures were being distortedupwards by non-euro area residents™purchases of negotiable paper included in M3.

A rough quantification of these distortions,
which became available shortly before thefirst Governing Council meeting of May 2001,
suggested that the amounts involved weresignificant, adding up to 1 percentage point ofannual M3 growth, had been increasing over
time and were higher than previouslyexpected. Taking these factors into account,the growth of M3 appeared to be less
pronounced than previously thought, and firstestimates of corrected M3 growth werealready at levels below the 4½% referencevalue from late 2000. (These distortions couldonly be fully eliminated from the officialstatistics in November 200l.)
As regards the second pillar, by the end of2000 the global economy was showing some
signs of weakness, notably the first indicationsof a slowdown in the United States and aworsening of the Japanese economy, both of
9which were giving rise to increasinguncertainty about the growth prospects forother regions of the world. The first
indications that the euro area economy wasbeing affected by these developments werevisible in sectors most exposed to the
external environment. Industrial productiongrowth started to decline from the beginningof 2001 and all available surveys on economic

conditions also pointed to some slowdown ineconomic activity in the first few monthsof 2001. At the same time, consumption
was expected to remain resilient given thestrong employment growth and tax cutsimplemented in several countries. Overall,
while it became increasingly evident that realGDP growth was slowing down in the euroarea, forecasts available in the first half of
2001 from several institutions, as well asthe Eurosystem staff projections, pointedto a decline in euro area real GDP growth
in 2001 towards levels broadly in line withtrend potential growth. The risks to theseprojections were, however, increasingly on
the downside, given the internationaleconomic outlook.An additional factor dampening growthprospects, in particular those for growth inprivate consumption, was the further increase
in HICP inflation in the euro area in early2001. This counteracted the positive effect onhouseholds™ disposable income stemming from
reductions in direct taxes in a number of euroarea countries at the end of 2000 and thebeginning of 2001. The annual rate of HICP
inflation, which had stood at 2.4% in January2001, increased to a peak of 3.4% in May 2001.This increase was mainly due to rises in
unprocessed food prices related to the outbreakof livestock diseases in a number of euro areacountries, as well as the delayed effects of past
oil price rises and the depreciation of theexchange rate of the euro, which had workedtheir way through producer prices. As a result
of these indirect effects, HICP inflation excluding
unprocessed food and energy prices alsomaintained a steady upward path in early 2001.

These price increases in the euro area were ofsome concern for the conduct of monetarypolicy since they also implied upward risks
to the medium-term prospects for inflation,
especially related to potential second-roundeffects via wages.Chart 1ECB interest rates and money market rates(percentages per annum; daily data)Source: ECB.Note: The rate for main refinancing operations is the rate applicable to fixed rate tenders for operations settled before 28 June 2000.Thereafter, the rate reflects the minimum bid rate applicable to variable rate tenders.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1

deteriorated further. In fact, the worseningof the economic growth outlook implied bothlower inflationary pressure from domestic
demand and lower risks to inflation fromwages. Against this background, and taking
into account the facts that wage growth
continued to be moderate until then andrevised M3 figures indicated a significantweakening of monetary growth, the Governing
Council decided at its meeting on 10 May2001 to lower the key ECB interest rates
by 25 basis points.
Economic activity in the euro areamoderated further in subsequent months. The

deceleration mainly reflected a decline ineuro area exports and investment growth asa consequence of the global slowdown and,

at the same time, a weakening of consumptiongrowth. In addition, short-term price
pressures abated. In this environment, from
the second quarter of 2001 M3 growthstabilised after the previous period of declineand then started to increase. However, for
several reasons, this increase was notinterpreted as implying risks to inflation. First,
part of the rise in M3 growth reflected
the greater need of economic agents fortransaction balances in order to adjust toprevious increases in energy and food prices.
Second, the strong M3 growth took place in
a period with a relatively flat yield curve,which increased the attractiveness of holding
short-term assets relative to long-term assets.Third, there was evidence that the continueddecline in stock prices observed from spring
2000 and the uncertainty prevailing in thefinancial markets had led many investors toshift their investments into safer and liquid
short-term assets such as deposits. Lastly, it
had to be borne in mind that the high rate ofgrowth in the official M3 figures was still
partly distorted by holdings of marketableinstruments by non-euro area residents. Allthese factors, together with the further
decline in the growth of loans to the privatesector, suggested that the information under
the first pillar was consistent with the
maintenance of price stability over themedium term. Against a background ofincreasingly apparent weakness of economic
activity and lower inflationary pressures, theGoverning Council decided to reduce keyECB interest rates on 30 August 2001 by
another 25 basis points.The terrorist attacks in the United States
on 11 September constituted a major shockto the world economy and risked disruptingthe functioning of financial markets.
Immediately after the attacks, the Eurosystemtook measures to ensure the normal functioningof the financial markets. The Eurosystem
conducted several liquidity-providingfine-tuning open market operations, whichstabilised money markets in the euro area

within a few days. In addition, througha foreign exchange swap agreement betweenthe ECB and the US Federal Reserve, the
Eurosystem also contributed to alleviatingeuro area banks™ shortages of liquidity in
US dollars (see Chapter II).
The terrorist attacks increased uncertaintyworldwide and therefore had the potential
to reinforce the already prevailing downwardtrend in economic activity. The weakerinternational environment adversely affected
external demand in the euro area
and hampered business investment. Theheightened uncertainty also had the potential
to affect consumption growth. In thesecircumstances, with the prospects foreconomic growth already worsening in the
euro area prior to the terrorist attacks,
downside risks to economic growth increasedand inflationary pressures were expected
to ease further. Against this background,following an extraordinary meeting held bymeans of a teleconference on 17 September,
the Governing Council reduced the key ECBinterest rates by 50 basis points, in concertwith an equivalent decision by the Federal

Open Market Committee of the US FederalReserve System. This decision responded toexceptional circumstances and reflected the
Governing Council™s conviction that a promptand concerted response to this commonglobal shock was needed. It also reflected11the assessment of lower inflationary pressuresin the euro area and was thereby fully in linewith the ECB™s monetary policy strategy.In the subsequent period, the evidenceavailable, especially that stemming from the

second pillar of the monetary policy strategy,indicated that inflationary pressures werelikely to decline further over the medium
term. In the aftermath of the attacks of11 September, it became increasingly clearthat the economic slowdown in the euro area
would last longer and be more pronounced
than previously expected. External demandwas expected to decline further and the
uncertainty generated by the terrorist attackswas considered likely to delay the recoveryin investment in the euro area and negatively
affect domestic private consumption. Allthese elements led to the expectation that
economic activity would remain subdued in
the second half of 2001, and that real GDPgrowth would also remain weak in early 2002.At the same time, the impact of the shocksto the price level from the oil price increasesand the depreciation of the exchange rate of
the euro in 1999 and 2000, as well asfrom the food price increases seen in early2001, was gradually fading. As a consequence,

HICP inflation fell continuously in late 2001.The decline in inflationary pressure waslikely to contribute to the stabilisation of
inflationary expectations, as it showed
that the previous increase in inflation wastemporary. This development, together with
the slowdown in economic activity, was, inturn, expected to support the continuationof wage moderation.This assessment was not contradicted by theanalysis stemming from monetary data. A

further strong acceleration in M3 occurred
after the terrorist attacks of 11 September,
but this was seen to largely reflect shifts in
private investors™ portfolios from shares and
other longer-term financial assets towards
more liquid, relatively safe short-term assets

included in M3. These shifts were seen as a
response by investors to heightened financialmarket uncertainty and were therefore
judged by the Governing Council to have
only a temporary effect on M3 growth andnot to indicate future inflationary pressures.
This assessment was supported by thefact that annual growth of credit to theprivate sector continued to decline. In this
environment, the Governing Council took thedecision to reduce the key ECB interest ratesby a further 50 basis points on 8 November.
After this decision, the minimum bid rate onthe main refinancing operations stood at3.25% and the rates on the marginal lending

facility and the deposit facility at 4.25% and
2.25% respectively.At its meeting on 8 November, the Governing
Council also decided that it would henceforth
Œ as a rule 
Œ assess the stance of the ECB
™smonetary policy and take interest rate decisionsonly at its first meeting of the month. TheGoverning Council announced that, at the
second meeting of the month, the focus wouldbe on issues related to the other tasks andresponsibilities of the ECB and the Eurosystem.At its meeting on 6 December, the Governing
Council conducted its regular review of the
reference value for M3 growth and reconfirmedthe value of 4½% for the broad aggregate M3.This decision was based on the ECB™s definitionof price stability and on unchanged assumptionsfor trend potential output growth of 2-2½%per annum and a trend decline in M3 income
velocity of ½-1% per annum in the euro area.It was recalled at that time that thereference value is a medium-term concept.
Temporary deviations of M3 from levels in line
with its long-term determinants might occurin the context of extraordinary economic

developments. The strong developments of M3growth in late 2001 should be assessed inthis light. They occurred in an economic and
financial environment characterised by highuncertainty and should therefore not indicateupward risks to price stability over the medium
term. It was also recalled that, shouldthe prevailing economic and financial marketuncertainty subside, any persisting excess
liquidity in the economy would need to becarefully reassessed with regard to whether itsignalled risks to price stability.12At the end of 2001 and in early 2002,the information which became availableconfirmed the earlier expectations of the
Governing Council regarding the economicoutlook in the euro area and therebyalso the forward-looking monetary policy
decisions previously taken. Real GDP growthturned out to be close to zero in the thirdquarter of 2001, and several indicators
pointed towards weak economic activity inthe fourth quarter of 2001 and in early 2002.At the same time, there were expectations
that economic growth would improve overallin the course of 2002. These expectationswere reflected in the available forecasts of

international institutions and also in theEurosystem staff projections published in
December 2001. Several factors supported

this view. First and foremost, there wereno major imbalances in the euro area thatwould have required a lengthy process
of adjustment. Given that the uncertaintyovershadowing the world economy wasexpected to diminish over time, the sound
economic fundamentals and the favourable
financing conditions in the euro area wereconsidered to provide a solid basis to sustaina recovery. In addition, it was envisaged that
the continued decline in consumer priceinflation would positively affect realdisposable income and thereby support
domestic demand. Overall, while the timingand strength of the upturn remaineduncertain, the evidence available in early 2002

indicated that a firming of economic activityshould take place.At the beginning of 2002, all information,including all available forecasts and theEurosystem staff macroeconomic projections,
supported the view that annual HICP inflation
should stabilise at levels below 2% over the
medium term.2Monetary and financial developments
2.1Monetary developments
Strong rise in M3 growth linked to specific
factorsThe annual growth rate of the broadmonetary aggregate M3 averaged 5.5% in

2001, which compares with an average of4.9% in 2000. However, after a substantialslowdown between spring 2000 and early
2001, M3 growth increased significantly in
the course of 2001, from a low of 3.8% in
March to 8.0% in December (see Chart 2).
The marked increase in M3 growth meantthat the three-month moving average of theannual growth rates of M3 was above the
reference value of 4
½% from the secondquarter of the year onwards. The three-month
moving average of the annual growth rates of
M3 covering the period from October to
December 2001 was 7.8%, compared with 4.1%in the same period of 2000.The strong rise in M3 growth in the courseof 2001 can be related to a number of factors.The rise in energy and food prices increasedthe needs of economic agents for transactionbalances, and the acceleration of M3 can be
partly seen as an adjustment following thesubdued monetary growth around the end of2000 and the beginning of 2001.The influence of these two factors can beillustrated with the help of measures of
liquidity such as the nominal and real moneygaps. In Chart 3 the measure of the nominalmoney gap is defined as the difference

between the actual level of M3 and the level
of M3 implied by monetary growth in linewith the reference value since December
1998 (taken as the base period). The measureof the real money gap is defined as thedifference between the actual level of M3

deflated by the HICP and the level of real M3implied by medium-term potential outputgrowth and trends in income velocity of

M3, again taking December 1998 as the base
period. When interpreting the nominal andthe real money gaps, it has to be taken into13Chart 3Estimates of the nominal and real money gaps(as a percentage of the stock of M3; three-month moving averages)Source: ECB.1)Deviation of the actual level of M3 from the level consistent with monetary growth at the reference value, taking December 19

somewhat arbitrary. As can be seen inChart 3, between the beginning of 2000 and
the second quarter of 2001 there was awidening discrepancy between the twomeasures. This discrepancy was caused by
the rise in the inflation rate during this period,
reflecting higher energy and food prices. Theresulting higher price level combined with
weak M3 growth resulted in low levels of thereal money gap in late 2000 and early 2001,indicating that there was a shortfall of M3
when measured in real terms in thatperiod. Part of the rise in M3 growth in
2001 was therefore probably related to a
ﬁcatch-upﬂ effect and a stronger demand for
transaction balances than was necessary tobring nominal money holdings back into line
with desired levels.An additional factor leading to the increasedliquidity preference of euro area non-MFIinvestors in 2001 was, at least until August,the relatively flat yield curve. As a
consequence, the relative attractiveness of
shorter-term assets that are remuneratedclose to the money market interest rate as
compared with longer-term assets remainedhigh during most of 2001. While the yield
curve gradually steepened as from late
summer 2001, following reductions in the keyECB interest rates, the associated decline inshort-term market interest rates reduced the

opportunity costs of holding instrumentscontained in M3, in particular those with lowor no remuneration, such as overnight

deposits, compared with other short-termassets not included in M3 (e.g. Treasury bills).
Hence this constituted a further factor
underpinning the higher M3 growth in late
2001.Finally, M3 developments in 2001 appear tohave been influenced by stock marketdevelopments. The persisting weakness in
global stock markets between March 2000and September 2001 seems to have led to agradual rise in the risk aversion of investors
with regard to holding stocks. This, in turn,induced a reallocation of the portfolios ofeuro area non-MFI investors, from equity to
low-risk assets. Later in the year, theconsiderable rise in stock market uncertaintyin the wake of the 11 September terrorist

attacks also led to a strong demand for safeand liquid assets.Overall, the combination of theaforementioned factors suggested that thestrong monetary dynamics in 2001 were not
to be overemphasised. As long as these
factors were of a temporary nature, they
were not to be seen as signalling risks to
price stability in the medium term.
Looking at the evolution of the componentsof M3 in more detail, the annual rate ofchange in currency in circulation declined
significantly in 2001 (see Table 1). This
development reflected to a large extent theincreasing effect of the prospect of the euro
cash changeover (see Box 1 for further
details). By contrast, after being very subduedin the first four months of 2001, the annualrate of growth of overnight deposits rose
significantly, particularly in the second half ofthe year. As is the case for M3 as a whole,the rise in the growth of overnight deposits
may in part be seen as a ﬁcatch-upﬂ effect
following the earlier weak growth andan adjustment to the higher price level,

particularly as these are very liquidcomponents that are more closely related to
transactions. In addition, there are indications
that former holdings of currency may to a
large extent have been shifted into holdingsof overnight deposits. The strong increase in
overnight deposits, particularly fromSeptember onwards, was also related to highfinancial market uncertainty, as overnight

deposits seem to have been used by investors
as an instrument for ﬁparkingﬂ money for a
limited period of time.The annual growth rate of marketableinstruments included in M3 also increased

markedly, to 20.9% in the last quarter of2001, which compares with 6.5% in the
last quarter of the previous year. This
rise presumably resulted primarily fromportfolio reallocations on account of both
developments in global stock markets and15200020012001200120012002

the relatively flat yield curve in the euro areaduring most of the year. Marketableinstruments are particularly suited to parking
money since they are liquid, entail a low risk,
and their remuneration is closely related tomarket interest rates and is thus typically
higher than that of short-term bank deposits.
Within marketable instruments, the increase
in the annual growth rate of money marketfund shares/units was particularly strong in

the last quarter of 2001 (30.2% comparedwith 1.8% in the last quarter of 2000).Finally, the annual growth rate of short-termdeposits other than overnight deposits alsoincreased in 2001, continuing a rising trend
that started at the beginning of 2000.However, this increase masks contrastingdevelopments in short-term savings deposits
(i.e. deposits redeemable at a period of noticeof up to three months) and short-term timedeposits (i.e. deposits with an agreed maturity
of up to two years). While the annual rateof change in short-term savings depositsrecovered strongly (from -4.9% in the last

quarter of 2000 to 5.0% in the last quarter of2001), there was a significant moderation inthe annual growth rate of short-term timedeposits, which occurred mainly in thesecond half of the year (from 12.6% in thelast quarter of 2000 to 6.9% in the last quarter
of 2001). These developments reflected the

evolution of the retail interest rates of these
components of M3, which altered theirrelative attractiveness in 2001. In fact, from
the end of 2000, the spread between the
retail interest rates of short-term time
deposits and those of short-term savings

deposits fell by 80 basis points, to 60 basispoints in December 2001, reflecting the factthat time deposits more closely followed
the gradual fall in short-term interest rates
during 2001. Accordingly, short-term savings
deposits became more attractive in relative
terms.In January 2002 the annual growth rate of M3declined to 7.9%, from 8.0% in the previous
month. The three-month average of theannual growth rates of the broad monetary

aggregate M3 increased to 8.0% in the periodfrom November 2001 to January 2002, from7.8% during the period from October to

December 2001. This increase, however,masked a slowdown in the short-termdynamics of M3, as indicated by a decline16in the annualised six-month growth rate to8.1%, after 8.7% in December and 9.7% inNovember 2001.Slowdown in credit to the private sectorChart 4 provides an overview of thedevelopments in M3 and its counterparts in
2001. The chart shows that the strong rise inM3 growth was accompanied by decreasing(but still relatively robust) credit growth,
subdued growth of longer-term financialliabilities and higher net external assets. Thiscontrasts strongly with the situation in 1999
when strong M3 growth was accompanied byhigh credit growth, pronounced growth oflong-term financial liabilities and a strong

decline in the MFI net external position.
Examining these developments more closelyand starting with credit developments, theannual average growth of total credit grantedby MFIs to residents of the euro area declinedto 5.5% in 2001, from an annual averagegrowth rate of 7.1% in 2000. This reflectedcontrasting developments in credit to the
general government and credit to the privatesector.Credit to the general government recoveredstrongly in the course of 2001, showing onlya small annual decline in the last quarter of

the year (0.5%), which contrasts with thehigh annual decline (7.0%) in the last quarter
of 2000 (see Table 2). This recovery may
partly reflect the increased financing needs ofthe general government in the euro area as awhole against the background of worsening
government budget balances.In contrast, the annual rate of growth of
credit granted by MFIs to the private sector
fell during 2001, to 6.9% in the last quarter,from 10.5% in the last quarter of 2000.
This reflected the significant fall in theannual growth rate of loans to the privatesector, down to 6.5% in the last quarter ofChart 4Movements in M3 and its counterparts(annual flows; EUR billions; not adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects)Source: ECB.-200-1000100200300400500

2001, from 9.6% in the last quarter of theprevious year. The quarterly sectoral
breakdown of loans granted by euro areaMFIs to the non-financial private sector shows
that in 2001 the growth of both loans to
non-financial corporations and loans tohouseholds declined (see Table 2). Withinloans to households, there was a particularly
marked decline in the growth of consumercredit (to 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2001,
from 7.8% in the last quarter of 2000),
possibly reflecting the deterioration inconsumer confidence in the euro area as well
as the slowdown in economic activity during
the year. The annual growth rate of lendingfor house purchase declined to 6.6% in the
fourth quarter of 2001, from 8.6% in the last
quarter of 2000. This decrease appears to
have been partly related to less buoyant
conditions in property markets in some euro
area countries. At the same time, the
continuous relatively strong demand for loansfor house purchase may be related to therelatively pronounced fall in thecorresponding retail interest rates in the
course of the year. As regards non-financialcorporations, the annual growth rate of loansto these corporations declined to 6.3% in the
fourth quarter of 2001, from 10.9% in thelast quarter of the previous year. Thisdevelopment was partly explained by the
moderation or unwinding of special factors
that in 2000 had pushed up the annual growthrate of loans to corporations, such as strong
merger and acquisition activity and the
financing of UMTS licences. In addition, the
weakening of economic growth is likely to

have played an important role in theslowdown of the growth of loans to
corporations.The subdued growth of the longer-termfinancial liabilities of the MFI sector (excluding
capital and reserves) provides furtherevidence of the above-mentioned portfolioreallocations into assets included in M3 in18 Box 1
Impact of the euro cash changeover on currency in circulation and M3Developments in currency in circulation during 2001 were strongly influenced by the prospect of the euro cashchangeover on 1 January 2002. From December 2000 to December 2001 currency in circulation decreased by
116 billion, which is equivalent to an annual growth rate of -32.2%. As illustrated in the chart below, thisdecline is far too sharp to be explained by the slowdown in economic activity. A shrinking amount of currency
in circulation was observed in 11 out of the 12 euro area countries over this time span.For an analysis of the decline in currency in circulation during 2001, two distinct periods can be identified: thefirst three-quarters of the year and the last quarter. The main source of the decline in currency in circulation inthe first three-quarters of the year was probably the fact that economic agents in the euro area were disposing
of their hoarded currency. This led in particular to a reduction in high-denomination banknotes. The flowbackof banknotes denominated in the euro legacy currencies from abroad had an additional impact. This effect islikely to have been particularly pronounced in Germany, as the circulation of Deutsche Mark outside the euro
area was the highest among all legacy currencies. Indeed, there was a sharper decline in the circulation of
Deutsche Mark than in the other legacy currencies taken together. (The annual growth rate of Deutsche Mark
in circulation was -46.4% compared with -25% for the other legacy currencies combined in December 2001.)In the last quarter of 2001, especially in December, the decline in currency in circulation was more widespreadand affected high as well as low-denomination banknotes. In addition to a reduction in domestically hoarded
banknotes and a flowback of banknotes of the euro legacy currencies from abroad, currency holdings for
transaction purposes may also have decreased to some extent in anticipation of the cash changeover. Moreover,there is some evidence that the flowback of banknotes of euro legacy currencies from abroad, especially

Deutsche Mark-denominated banknotes, picked up towards the end of 2001.There are indications that the reduction in currency in circulation during 2001 has led to important substitutionsbetween currency and short-term deposits within M3. In particular, the pace of growth of overnight deposits,which is the closest substitute for currency, increased during 2001. Thus, despite the massive decline incurrency in circulation, the impact of the euro cash changeover on monetary aggregates, especially M3, can be

assumed to be small.Currency in circulation, GDP and opportunity costs

Data on the distribution of euro banknotes to
residents and non-residents, which became available in early 2002, can be used as a preliminary indication ofthe demand for euro banknotes by non-residents. Data on the different channels for the initial distribution ofbanknotes to non-residents of the euro area (frontloading via euro area NCBs, sub-frontloading and banknote
distribution via euro area credit institutions) suggest that the initial distribution of banknotes and coins to non-residents of the euro area reached5 billion at the end of December 2001, i.e. 4% of the total amountdistributed. There are additional indications that a similar amount was distributed to non-residents of the euro
area in January 2002.
2001. The annual growth rate of longer-termfinancial liabilities (excluding capital andreserves) was 2.8% in the last quarter of
2001, which was exceptionally low byhistorical standards. This development partlyreflected the fact that the yield curve was
relatively flat for most of 2001. The narrowerspread between the yield on longer-termfinancial liabilities and the remuneration on
short-term instruments is likely to have
reduced the demand for longer-term financialliabilities in 2001. In addition, the unsettled
conditions in financial markets, particularlyafter the terrorist attacks in September, seem
to have contributed to lower demand for
longer-term assets, even though in the last
two months of the year, there appeared
to be some rebound in the growth of
this counterpart. This development could be
related to the steepening of the yield curvefrom August onwards and a normalisation of
the situation on financial markets after thesurge in uncertainty caused by the terroristattacks on 11 September.Finally, there was a significant change in the
pattern of the flows in net external assets of
the MFI sector in 2001. Following strongdeclines in the net external position of euroarea MFIs in 1999 and 2000 (of 196.6 billionand 142.3 billion respectively), in the12-month period up to December 2001 netexternal assets of euro area MFIs rose by
3.0 billion. The significant improvement inthe net external position of MFIs mainlyreflected strong inflows of funds by non-MFIs
into the euro area in the period from June toDecember 2001. Data from the balance ofpayments suggest that this developmentreflected net inflows of combined direct andportfolio investment and, in particular, equityinflows into the euro area.2.2Financial markets
Continued growth in the issuance of debtsecuritiesIn 2001 the market for debt securities issuedby euro area residents continued to grow at
a slightly higher pace than in 2000, with
the amount of debt securities outstandingincreasing by more than 7% between end-

2000 and end-2001, compared with growthof just below 7% in 2000. Underlying thegrowth in 2001 was an increase of 5.5% in

the amount outstanding of short-term debtsecurities, up from 4% in 2000, and anincrease of 7.3% in the amount outstanding

of long-term issues, up from 7% in 2000.Long-term debt securities accounted for mostof the total amount of debt securities
outstanding, representing more than 90% ofthe total amount outstanding at the end of
2001. This share has been stable since 1997.
At the same time, issuance of short-term
debt securities accounted for roughly 75% oftotal gross issuance in 2001, which represents
a strong increase compared with the averageshare of short-term issuance during the
1990s.Issuance activity in 2001 increased in allsectors except the MFI sector. In terms of
both amounts outstanding and issuance, thegeneral government and the MFI sectorcontinued to dominate the securities market20for euro-denominated debt, but the growth
in the market was due to the continued
strong issuance by the private non-MFI sector
(see Chart 5). The decline in the issuanceactivity of the MFI sector seems to have beenlargely due to lower credit demand by
the private non-financial sector against abackground of slowing economic activity,
combined with rising inflows of deposits to
MFIs (see Section 2.1).The annual growth of the total amountoutstanding of debt securities issued by thegeneral government increased from 2.6%at the end of 2000 to 3.6% at the end of
2001. This reflected the increased borrowingrequirements in the public sector in 2001, inparticular outside central government, at
the state and local levels.For the private non-MFI sector, theamounts outstanding of euro-denominateddebt securities issued by non-financialcorporations grew by approximately 18%
in 2001, compared with 17% in 2000,
while issuance by non-monetary financialcorporations grew by about 41% in 2001
compared with 28% in 2000. This sharpincrease in the growth of debt securities
issuance in the private non-MFI sector took
place in an environment of weakeningeconomic growth in the euro area and ageneral widening of spreads for corporate
debt securities during 2001, particularly forlower-rated issuers.The strong issuance by the private non-MFIsector was due to the concurrence ofseveral factors. Restructuring in the euro area
corporate sector continued at a steady pacein 2001, despite easing off slightly comparedwith 1999 and the first half of 2000. Interest
rates were also relatively low by historical
standards. Part of the stronger reliance ondebt securities finance might also have been
due to somewhat lower corporate earnings
and deteriorating financing conditions in theequity market, owing to high volatility and
declining prices in stock markets in 2001.Furthermore, the virtuous circle, initiatedwith the introduction of the euro, of more
issuers creating a larger market which, in
turn, attracts more issuers continued in2001 as increasing market depth and liquidityChart 5Amounts outstanding of euro-denominated debt securities

60Monetary Financial Institutionsnon-monetary financial corporationsnon-financial corporationsgeneral government21continued to improve conditions for private
issuers to tap the euro area capital markets.In 2001 the market broadened its appeal to a
steadily growing number of individual issuers,so that a broader range of industrial sectorsincreasingly came to rely on direct financing
through the issuance of debt securities,
although the dominant issuers continuedto be the telecommunications sector, in
particular, and the automobile sector.
As a consequence of these trends, theproportion of outstanding debt securitiesissued by non-monetary financial and non-financial corporations increased from 9.8%
at the end of 2000 to 11.5% at the end of2001, continuing the trend that hadprevailed over previous years (see Table 3).
The MFI sector™s share in the stock of
euro-denominated debt securities declinedfrom 37.4% at end-2000 to 36.5% at
end-2001. Mirroring these changes, theproportion of general government euro-denominated securities fell from 52.9% at
the end of 2000 to 52.0% at the end of 2001.Money market interest rates decreased inline with ECB interest rates in 2001Money market rates decreased significantlyin the course of 2001, continuing the trend
seen since autumn 2000. This mirrored the
decrease in the key ECB interest rates of atotal of 150 basis points in 2001 which wasimplemented in four steps over the course
of the year. The decline in money marketinterest rates during 2001 was not fullyanticipated by the markets at the beginning
of the year. This can be seen from the
difference between the one-month and the12-month interest rates at the beginning of
the year, which was less than 20 basis points,indicating that market participants only
expected a moderate decrease in money

market rates during 2001 (see Chart 6). More
precisely, at the beginning of January 2001,according to the interest rates implied
in EURIBOR futures contracts, marketparticipants expected a decline of around½ percentage point in three-month money
market rates during the year. Expectations ofa fall in money market rates increased duringthe year as the incoming information
increasingly pointed to a decline in inflationarypressures.The level of the overnight interest rate, asmeasured by the EONIA, tended to mirrorthe pattern of the minimum bid rate in
the main refinancing operations of theEurosystem. The volatility of the EONIA was,in general, low and confined to the end of
the reserve maintenance periods when theminimum reserve constraints on the banking
system became binding. The main exceptions

followed episodes of insufficient bidding bythe Eurosystem™s counterparties in themain refinancing operations. Such episodes
occurred in February, April, October andNovember. Moreover, following theSeptember terrorist attacks, the EONIA
rose temporarily as market participantsincreased their preference for holding excess
liquidity. However, two fine tuning operations
conducted by the Eurosystem helped torestore normal market conditions in the
overnight market (see Chapter II). In addition,The share of gross issuance by euro arearesidents of debt securities denominated ineuro as a percentage of issuance in all
currencies was stable at just below 93% in

2001. The euro also remained an attractivecurrency for international issuers, and theamount outstanding of euro-denominated
debt securities issued by non-residents of
the euro area grew by about 17% in 2001,down from the high growth rate of 26.3%

month, in response to financial institutions™desire to adjust their balance sheets at thesetimes. As in previous years, this occurred

most markedly at the turn of the year. At
the start of 2002 the euro cash changeovergenerated some uncertainty with regard
to the liquidity situation, but the volatility
of the EONIA remained contained andnormal conditions were restored after two

fine-tuning operations conducted by theEurosystem.In the first half of 2001 money market interest
rates at all maturities declined by somewhatmore than the key ECB interest rates, which
were reduced by 25 basis points in May,
reflecting increasing expectations of furthermonetary policy easing in the second half of
2001. In the period after the GoverningCouncil decision on 10 May, money marketinterest rates at maturities of up to one

month broadly stabilised, while at longermaturities they continued to declinesomewhat.In August, the downward trend resumedat all maturities, reflecting increasedexpectations among market participants ofreductions in the key ECB interest rates as

signs of a decline in medium-term inflationary
pressures became more evident. TheGoverning Council reduced the key ECB

interest rates by 25 basis points on 30 August.Money market rates declined further in
the days following the terrorist attackson 11 September, as market participants
expected that these events would have an
impact on economic confidence and theoutlook for price stability. On 17 September,the Governing Council decided to reduce the
key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, inconcert with an equivalent decision by theFederal Open Market Committee of the
US Federal Reserve System. The volatility ofthe three-month EURIBOR implied in optionson futures contracts rose considerably

following the terrorist attacks, indicating anincrease in market participants™ perceived
uncertainty about the economic outlook (see
Chart 7). Following the decision of theGoverning Council to lower the key ECBrates by 50 basis points on 8 November,
however, implied volatility broadly stabilised,to decline significantly later on.Chart 6Short-term interest rates in the euro area(percentages per annum; daily data)Source: Reuters.Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1

market rates at the longer maturities tendedto increase, reflecting financial market
expectations of a gradual recovery in the
euro area. The downward slope of the
money market yield curve, measured as thedifference between the 12-month and the
one-month interest rates, thus levelledoff (see Chart 7). At the end of 2001 theone-month and the 12-month money market

rates stood at 3.33% and 3.34% respectively,both around 1

a year earlier.In early 2002 money market interest ratesrose. The increase was most pronounced at
the longer maturities. As a consequence, themoney market yield curve became positivelysloped.Long-term bond yields in the euro area
changed little overall in 2001Long-term interest rates in both the euroarea and the United States were subject tosome fluctuations in 2001. Overall, however,they changed little between the end of2000 and the end of 2001. In the euro areaand the United States, average ten-year
government bond yields stood at around 5.1%at the end of 2001 (see Chart 8 (a)). Thedifferential between US and euro area ten-
year bond yields Œ which had narrowed
substantially in 2000 
Œ hovered at around
zero throughout 2001, although it went into

environment where the US economy wasmoving into recession. The continued

from recession sooner rather than later. This
overall optimism notwithstanding, investorsentiment with regard to the severity of the
recession and the anticipated start of therecovery changed markedly in the course ofthe year, giving rise to the above-mentioned

swings in long-term interest rates. Forexample, long-term bond yields increasedrather strongly between mid-March and the
end of May on the back of marketparticipants™ growing optimism about a quick
rebound in economic activity and related
inflation fears. This episode gave way to aperiod where investors seemed to becomemore pessimistic about growth prospects,
which was reinforced by the terrorist attacksin early September. Moreover, the sharpdeclines in long-term interest rates after the
attacks were to a large extent also driven byportfolio shifts out of the stock market intothe market for long-term government bondsin connection with investors™ temporarily

2001, long-term bond yields did not declinefurther, reflecting market participants
™increasing concerns about the high level of
issuance, and lowered credit ratings, ofJapanese government debt.In the euro area, bond yield developments in2001 were quite similar to those in theUnited States. This indicates that common
global factors Œ in particular the worldwide
slowdown in economic growth and the
uncertainty related to the terrorist attacks
on 11 September Œ were the main driving
forces behind interest rate movements inboth economies, a view also confirmed by

stock market developments (see Box 2).However, movements in long-term interestrates were much less pronounced and less
volatile in the euro area, signalling morestable market expectations for euro areagrowth and inflation than in the United States.

In particular, market participants
™ long-term
inflation expectations as reflected in thebreak-even inflation rate Œ calculated as the
difference between French nominal ten-yeargovernment bond yields and the real yield onFrench ten-year index-linked bonds (linkedto the French consumer price index) Œchanged little overall in 2001, remaining atrelatively low levels (see Chart 9). This canbe interpreted as revealing market
participants™ confidence that the ECB would
maintain price stability in the euro area over
the medium term.
Real yields on French ten-year index-linkedbonds remained basically unchanged between
the end of 2000 and the end of 2001. Thissuggests that investors™ long-term average
real growth expectations also changed little
over this period. In this respect, the upwardsloping yield curve could be seen as anindication that at the end of 2001, market
participants were expecting the euro areaeconomy to make a relatively quick recovery.In fact, reflecting declines in money market

interest rates, the slope of the euro areayield curve, as measured by the differencebetween ten-year bond yields and the three-
month EURIBOR, steepened from an almost
flat level in December 2000 to a level ofaround 180 basis points by the end of 2001.

This is because when bond yields fall in an environment of stable inflation expectations, future dividends andearnings should be discounted less heavily. This means that stock prices Œ which in equilibrium are thediscounted present value of all future cash-flows to investors Œ should rise if the origin of declining bond
yields is declining real interest rates, other things being equal. During most of 2001, however, long-terminterest rates and stock prices in the euro area moved in the same direction. For example, from around Marchuntil the terrorist attacks in the United States in September, euro area ten-year bond yields and the EURO
STOXX price index moved broadly in parallel (see the chart below). By contrast, stock prices and bond yieldsreacted quite differently to the terrorist attacks, with stock prices initially falling and then rebounding someweeks earlier than bond yields. Although this caused a short period of negative weekly correlation between
them from around mid-September to early November, the correlation was positive overall in 2001.In general, the degree of co-movement between bond yields and stock prices depends on relative changes inthe fundamental economic factors that drive bond yields and stock prices over a specific period of time.Long-term interest rates depend on expected short-term interest rates over the remaining life of the bond aswell as a bond-specific risk premium. This risk premium, in turn, compensates investors for the risk of bondprice changes prior to the maturity of the bond. Moreover, the longer the maturity of the bond, the higher thisrisk premium tends to be. As short-term interest rates reflect the current stance of monetary policy, which in
turn depends on perceived inflationary pressures and the expected state of economic activity, long-terminterest rates basically mirror market participants™ growth and inflation expectations over a long-term horizon.Stock prices should reflect the discounted present value of future dividends. Hence, expectations of futurecorporate earnings are one of the key factors that determine stock prices. The discount rates can be broken
down into current and expected short-term interest rates and an equity risk premium which compensatesBond yields and stock prices in the euro area(bond yields in percentages per annum; daily data)Source: Reuters.Note: Bond yields are average ten-year government bond yields for the euro area.

such risks (risk preferences).Against this background, the correlation between changes in bond yields and stock prices may help in identifyingthe likely driving factors behind bond and stock market movements. For example, if market participants expect
higher short-term interest rates in the future, all else being equal, stock prices decline and long-term bond yieldsincrease, causing a negative correlation between the two. By contrast, when expectations for economic growthimprove, stock prices often rise Œ as corporate earnings and thus dividends tend to rise when economic activity
increases Œ together with bond yields, leading to a positive correlation between stock prices and long-term interest
rates. A positive correlation may also arise in situations where investors become more risk-averse and uncertainabout future stock returns. This is because such uncertainty can often prompt portfolio shifts from stocks into
long-term government bonds, which can be regarded as safer investments (ﬁflight to safetyﬂ). The resulting priceeffects of such portfolio shifts Œ lower stock prices and lower bond yields 
Œ can be interpreted as an increase in the
equity risk premium and a decline in the risk premium on bonds.In this vein, the strong co-movement of bond yields and stock prices over most of 2001 appears to have beenmainly due to changes in the general outlook for economic growth in the euro area. For example, in the course
of 2001, in line with global developments, the economic outlook in the euro area became less favourable. Thisled to declines not only in short-term interest rates, but also in long-term interest rates, albeit to a lesser extent.At the same time stock prices declined, which suggests that the ongoing economic slowdown had a stronger
impact on corporate earnings expectations than on the expected interest rates used to discount future dividends.In September, this strong positive correlation between changes in bond yields and stock prices was interruptedby the terrorist attacks in the United States. These events substantially increased stock market participants™uncertainty and risk aversion, prompting investors to shift funds out of the stock market into safer securities.The resulting strong decline in stock prices seemed to have been due mainly to an increase in the equity risk
premium. Long-term interest rates, however, changed little immediately after the attacks. This was because, incontrast to previous periods of financial market turbulence, investors in the euro area seemed to prefer short-term bonds or bank deposits, as safe assets, to long-term bonds. At the same time, it seems that the terrorist

attacks did not initially prompt a significant reappraisal of long-term growth prospects for the euro areaeconomy. As a result, bond yields and stock prices showed little discernible correlation immediately after theterrorist attacks.However, when market conditions started to normalise, probably reflecting the swift reaction of policy-makers to the new situation after the terrorist attacks, stock prices gradually rebounded, as market participants
apparently demanded a lower risk premium for holding equity, in line with declining uncertainty and riskaversion. The upward movement in stock prices coincided with declines in long-term bond yields. This causeda temporary strong negative correlation between changes in stock prices and ten-year bond yields.
The subsequent upturn in long-term interest rates from early November onwards Œ triggered by waning
investor pessimism about the euro area economic outlook Œ was generally accompanied by further increases in
stock prices, reinstating the positive correlation between long-term interest rates and stock prices that hadprevailed over most of the year. This would suggest that, beyond the support received from further declines inthe equity risk premium, higher economic growth and thus earnings expectations again exerted a strong
influence on stock price developments in the last two months of 2001.All in all, contrasting with the standard negative correlation, euro area stock prices and long-term bond yieldstended to move in the same direction during most of 2001. This seemed to suggest that bond and stock marketdevelopments during 2001 were mainly driven by investors™ changing views about growth prospects in the
euro area, which illustrates the particular difficulty experienced by market participants in the year 2001 in
assessing future economic activity and the prospects for corporate profits.28In the period from the end of December
2001 to 5 March 2002, ten-year governmentbond yields in the euro area increased slightly
to a level of about 5.2%. Owing to the factthat long-term bond yields in the UnitedStates remained broadly stable over the same
period, the differential between ten-yeargovernment bond yields in the United Statesand in the euro area narrowed somewhat
and stood at around -10 basis points by5 March 2002.Retail rates declined in 2001, broadlyfollowing market ratesShort-term retail bank interest rates declinedthroughout 2001, following the trend set by
money market rates from late 2000 onwards.However, significant differences could beobserved between the rates for various forms
of deposits. From end-2000 to end-2001 themonthly average of the three-month moneymarket rate declined by about 160 basis
points. Over the same period, however, therates for overnight deposits and short-termsavings deposits (deposits redeemable at a
period of notice of up to three months) both
declined fairly modestly, by about 30 basisChart 10Short-term retail bank interest rates and a comparable market rate(percentages per annum; monthly averages)Sources: ECB and Reuters.Note: From 1 January 2001, data include Greece.1997199819992000

130 basis points by the end of 2001. Bycontrast, the rate on deposits with anagreed maturity of up to one year declined
by about 115 basis points (see Chart 10).
This development is not particularly unusualcompared with historical experience, which
shows that the pass-through from marketrates has tended to be slower and lesscomplete for overnight deposits and short-
term savings deposits than for short-termtime deposits, partly on account of country-
specific institutional arrangements. Retail
rates for loans to enterprises with maturitiesof up to one year declined by about 95 basispoints. Whereas, by the end of 2001, money
market rates had returned to the levelsprevailing at the end of 1999, this retail loanrate remained more than 40 basis points

above the December 1999 level. This wideningof spreads can be partly explained by theusual sluggishness of the pass-through from
market rates to retail rates, but it may alsobe attributed in part to an increase in creditrisk associated with the general economic
downturn in 2001, as reflected, for instance,
in the widening of corporate bond spreads in29Chart 11Long-term retail bank interest rates and a comparable market rate

partly due to declines in market rates which
had already taken place in 2000, in particularin the last quarter. From the end of 2000 toNovember 2001, the monthly average of the
five-year government bond yield declined byabout 85 basis points. By comparison, the
rate for long-term time deposits (deposits
with maturities of over two years) and therate for loans to households for housepurchase declined by about 95 basis points
over the same period, while the average ratefor loans to enterprises with a maturity ofover one year declined by about 75 basis
points. Starting in December, the monthlyaverage of the five-year government bondyield increased markedly, which was quicklyreflected in the rate for long-term depositsand to a lesser extent in the rate for loans
to households for house purchase. Theaverage rate for loans to enterprisescontinued to decline in January 2002. Rather
than unusual sluggishness, this developmentshould probably be seen as a decrease inthe risk premium of uncollateralised lending

in particular,  which had built up during 2001.
Global stock prices declined in 2001Stock prices declined globally in 2001,continuing the downward trend that startedin September 2000, thus unwinding the
substantial increases before April 2000 and
bringing the levels of benchmark indices inthe United States and the euro area closeto those seen in late 1998 (see Chart 12 (a)).

A major factor behind the broadly based,continued decline in stock prices in 2001,which had been concentrated in technology-
related sectors in 2000, seemed to be the
global economic slowdown that materialisedin the course of 2001. This was accompanied
by downward revisions to expectations offuture corporate profitability, company profit
30warnings, and a correction of the buoyantstock price developments before the secondquarter of 2000. Stock market developmentsin 2001 were also characterised by periods

of high uncertainty as measured by impliedvolatility derived from prices on optionscontracts (see Chart 12 (b)).Overall, stock prices in the United States, Japan
and the euro area followed similar patterns in
2001. In the first quarter of 2001 benchmarkstock price indices generally declined and
implied volatility in stock markets increased as
the outlook for the world economy becamemore uncertain. However, between late Marchand late May stock prices recovered to levels
similar to those prevailing at the beginning ofthe year, mainly owing to increasing confidencein a quick recovery in the world economy. This
increased confidence in a quick recovery ineconomic activity nevertheless faded ratherrapidly, and stock prices declined again
more or less continuously from early Juneto late September as corporate earningscontinued to fall and expectations for economic
activity and corporate profits were adjusteddownwards.This downward trend in stock prices wasreinforced temporarily in September owingto the terrorist attacks in the United
States. In addition to an immediate significant
negative impact on stock prices, the attacksalso induced a surge in implied volatility. Thisreflected the highly uncertain outlook for
profitability, particularly for insurancecompanies and companies in the travelindustry. In the course of October and
November, however, implied volatility settledat levels more typical of historical experienceand stock prices gradually recovered to levels
similar to those seen before the terroristattacks. This might suggest that stock pricedevelopments reflected a perception that the
events would not have a lasting impact onearnings in the corporate sector, includingon those companies which were most
affected by the events of 11 September 2001.The steps taken by the monetary authoritiesin the United States and Europe and the fiscal

measured by the Standard & Poor™s 500 index,declined by 14% between the end of 2000and the end of 2001, while, in Japan, the
Nikkei 225 index lost 24% over this period.
In the euro area, the Dow Jones EUROSTOXX broad index declined by 20%
between end-2000 and end-2001.In the United States, despite the monetaryeasing throughout 2001, stock prices were
negatively affected by the further slowdownin the pace of economic activity in the course

of the year. In early 2001 there were widelyheld expectations of a recovery in the courseof the second half of the year, but evidence
gradually accumulated pointing to a deeperand more prolonged downturn. For thecorporate sector, this implied a sharp
deterioration in reported earnings and an
increase in bankruptcies, while, at the sametime, investors were revising their
expectations for future corporate earningsdownwards. Accordingly, stock pricesdeclined significantly in most sectors,
emphasising the broad nature of the
slowdown in economic activity in 2001. Inthis respect, similar to 2000, the technology
sector was a significant contributor to thedecline in the broad index between end-2000
and end-2001, owing to a further significant

downward adjustment of long-term earningsexpectations in this sector.In Japan, the fall in stock prices reflected thecontinued weakness in the domesticeconomy, which was exacerbated by the
worldwide economic slowdown. This impliedthat, in addition to companies operatingdomestically, exporting companies also faced

a sharp deterioration in earnings prospects.
Moreover, the high level of non-performingloans in the financial sector contributed to a

lowering of stock prices in Japan during 2001.Implied volatility, as derived from prices onoptions contracts on the Nikkei 225 index,
was higher than in previous years, reflecting
the continuing uncertainty about futureeconomic developments in Japan.In the euro area, stock prices in 2001 werenegatively affected by an increasing realisationover the course of the year that the
slowdown in economic activity would bemore prolonged than generally believed atthe beginning of the year. Coinciding with
this, reported earnings for the corporatesector were, overall, worse than expected
and, at the same time, companies tended to
emphasise the uncertain outlook for futurecorporate earnings. Owing partly to thesimultaneous economic slowdown in all the

major economies of the world, stock pricesdeclined across all sectors in the euro areabetween end-2000 and end-2001. There were
only small sectoral differences compared withthose observed in recent years, with theexception of the telecommunications and
technology sectors, where the declines were
particularly marked. The telecommunicationssector stock price index declined by 28%
between end-2000 and end-2001 after a dropof 43% in 2000. It seemed that investorswere increasingly becoming more concerned
about the profitability of companies in this
sector, given the high level of debt thathad been built up in order to finance the
acquisition of UMTS licences in 2000 and theinvestments in the necessary technology.Similar to developments in the United States,
stock prices in the technology sector declinedby 37% between end-2000 and end-2001, as
the market revised its expectations for
earnings prospects in this sector downwards.In the period from end-2001 to 5 March2002, stock prices in the euro area, asmeasured by the Dow Jones EURO STOXXindex, and in the United States, as measured

by the Standard & Poor
™s 500 index, remained
broadly stable. Developments in US stockmarkets seemed to reflect ongoing concerns
about the sustainability of high levels of
corporate debt as well as the reliability ofreported earnings, particularly for companies
in the telecommunications and technologysectors. At the same time, market participants
became more optimistic that an economic
rebound was on its way. The same mixedsignals seemed to influence euro area stockprices.323   Price developments

From January to May 2001, when the annual
inflation rate peaked, prices of unprocessedfood were the main factor contributing to
the increase in the HICP. The increase inunprocessed food prices was mainly causedby health concerns related to cases of BSE in
a number of euro area countries. In addition,the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease insome countries and the measures taken in
order to prevent a further spread of thedisease exerted further upward pressures onprices of unprocessed food. In year-on-year
terms, unprocessed food prices increasedfrom 4.6% in January to 9.1% in May 2001
(see Chart 13). As the upward price pressures
associated with the above-mentioned healthconcerns started to unwind during thesummer of 2001, the year-on-year rates of
change in this component started to decline.The annual rate of change subsequently stood
at 6.5% in December 2001. Although the level
of unprocessed food prices declined in thesecond half of 2001, by the end of the year itwas still above the levels observed before
the outbreak of BSE.The turnaround in the inflation rate that took
place after the peak in May 2001 and thesubsequent decline were mainly accountedfor by lower energy prices. The downward
movement in the annual rate of change in
energy prices that had begun at the end of2000 continued in 2001 with a short
interruption in the second quarter of 2001,reflecting the temporary rebound of euro-denominated oil prices. In the last four

months of 2001 negative annual growth ratesin energy prices were recorded. The year-on-year rate of decline in the energy
component was 4.5% in December 2001,compared with an increase of 7.9% in January2001 and 15.6% at its peak in September
2000. The downward movement in the year-on-year rates of change in energy pricesreflected, on the one hand, the base effects
associated with the increase in energy pricesduring 2000 and, on the other, a substantialdecline in euro-denominated oil prices in thecourse of 2001. On average, oil prices werequoted at 22.4 per barrel in the fourthquarter of 2001, 12.1 (or 35.1%) lower thanthe average quotation in the correspondingquarter one year earlier. In contrast to 2000,euro-denominated oil prices in 2001 were
almost entirely determined by movements inthe US dollar price of oil, and not by
movements in the euro-dollar exchange rate.HICP inflation excluding volatilecomponents increased in 2001Inflation measured by the HICP excludingunprocessed food and energy prices in 2001was still influenced by indirect effects causedby the oil price increases and the depreciation34of the euro exchange rate in 1999 and mostof 2000. In addition, prices of processed food
exerted further pressures on this component
as a result of delayed effects of earlierincreases in unprocessed food prices.Domestic price pressures, however, remained
contained throughout the year. Reflectingthese indirect and lagged effects, HICPinflation excluding unprocessed food and
energy prices increased further in the courseof 2001. This development reflected higherannual rates of change in all of its three main

sub-components: processed food, non-energyindustrial goods, and services. The year-on-year rate of change in the HICP excluding
unprocessed food and energy prices stood at2.5% in December 2001, 1.0 percentage point
higher than in December 2000 and

1.6 percentage points higher than the troughin October 1999.The annual growth rates in prices of non-energy industrial goods was 1.7% inDecember 2001, 0.6 percentage point higher
than in December 2000. However, theincreases in the year-on-year rates of changegradually diminished in the latter half of the

year as the above-mentioned indirect effectsstarted to unwind. The annual rate of increasein services prices rose from 1.8% in

December 2000 to 2.2% in January 2001,reflecting changes in administrative prices andindirect taxes in a few euro area countries.
The year-on-year rate of change in prices ofservices was also affected by pass-througheffects from previous increases in import
prices, and hence edged up furtherthroughout the year to stand at 2.8% inDecember 2001. The pick-up in the year-on-
year rates of change in the HICP excluding
unprocessed food and energy prices during2001 also reflected higher prices of processed
food as a result of delayed effects from earlierincreases in unprocessed food prices. Theannual growth rate in prices of processed

food stood at 3.5% in December 2001,2.1 percentage points higher than in December2000. Also for this component, the increases
in the year-on-year rates diminished over
the last two quarters of 2001, suggesting anunwinding of these indirect effects.As regards any possible effects from the eurocash changeover on HICP inflation in the
course of 2001, the evidence suggests that
these were limited. In this respect, it shouldbe borne in mind that it is very difficult to
disentangle any cash changeover effects

from other sources of inflationary pressures.
Box 3, entitled ﬁThe impact of the euro cashchangeover on euro area consumer prices
ﬂ,reviews this issue in more detail.Inflation expectations remained containeddespite higher inflationVarious surveys (for example the ECB
™sSurvey of Professional Forecasters and
Consensus Economics Forecasts) indicate that
there was little evidence of an overreaction
of expected inflation to the pick-up in actualinflation during the first half of 2001. This is
illustrated in Table 5, which shows actualHICP inflation outcome for the four quartersof 2001 (and the yearly average) together
with the evolution of expectations as regards
the average inflation outcome for 2001 and2002 surveyed in each of the four quarters of

2001.While over the course of 2001 inflation
expectations for the year were graduallyrevised upwards in line with the actualoutcome, expectations for 2002 were much
more stable and, in particular, they all
remained below 2% throughout the year. Thisstability in expectations indicates that economic
agents largely perceived the increase in inflationin 2001 as transitory. This was most probablyreinforced by the ECB™s determination to ensurethat the increase in inflation would remain atemporary 
phenomenon, which in turn helpedto foster an environment where the risks of
second-round effects on wages could becontained.Inflation divergence remained broadlyunchanged in 2001The degree of dispersion of HICP inflationrates among euro area countries remained35broadly unchanged in 2001. The spread
between the two countries with the highest
and the lowest rates remained at3.3 percentage points, virtually unchangedcompared with 2000. The standard deviation
remained at around 1 percentage point.Changes in annual average HICP inflationvaried across countries, mainly as a result of
the different impact of temporary and one-off factors. In particular, the differentcountry-specific impact of the animal diseases
and weather conditions on food prices helpsto explain the various patterns observed.Producer prices strongly affected bydevelopments in commodity pricesOn average, the industrial producer priceindex (excluding construction) increased by
2.2% in 2001, 3.3 percentage points less thanthe increase in 2000. This outcome is mostlyexplained by developments in the energy
and intermediate goods components, whichin turn reflected lower prices for energy
and non-energy commodities. After the
producer price increases peaked at 6.7% inOctober 2000, the annual rates of changedeclined substantially and in December 2001
a negative growth rate of 1.1% was recorded(see Chart 14).As regards capital and consumer goods, theaverage price rises in 2001 increasedcompared with 2000.

36Box 3The impact of the euro cash changeover on euro area consumer pricesWith the introduction of euro banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002, all prices in the euro area were converted
into prices denominated in euro. Fears have been raised, as witnessed in survey results by the European
Commission, that the changeover could result in widespread price increases. This box reviews the main argumentsand facts related to possible upward and downward effects on consumer prices stemming from the cash changeover.
Economic arguments suggest potential for upward as well as downward pressure on pricesIn relation to the euro cash changeover, there are three main factors that could affect prices: a pass-through ofcosts, so-called menu costs and rounding to new attractive prices. As regards costs, companies have faced one-off

costs (such as IT investment and staff training) that might be passed on to customers in order to maintain profitmargins. Available information, albeit limited, suggests that costs might have been relatively modest.Moreover, they are  mainly of a one-off nature and have occurred over a longer period. In addition, due to the
costs of changing prices (also called menu costs), which often lead to relatively infrequent price adjustments,retailers may have organised their regular price adjustments to coincide with the changeover. This would result inan unusual concentration of individual price changes close to the time of the changeover that could influence the
normal seasonal pattern. Over the longer term, however, average inflation would not be affected. A further risk ofprice increases arises from the possibility that companies round up prices to new attractive euro prices in order toimprove their profits. The use of attractive (or psychological) prices (ending with the digit 9 for instance) is very
common in the retail trade and companies may have reviewed their price structures, after conversion into euro, so
that they have as many attractive prices as before the changeover. However, such a readjustment of prices wouldmost likely include both upward and downward rounding and the overall net effect is a priori uncertain.Several factors should, however, limit general price increases. For instance, competition in most markets in theeuro area seems to be strong enough to limit any upward price pressures from the outset. In fact, companies may
even reduce prices in order to attract customers or capture market share. The prevailing demand situation also
limits opportunities for price increases. Moreover, consumers and consumer organisations have been asked to bevigilant and to monitor the situation closely, and have been helped by the dual display of prices, making it more
difficult for retailers to raise prices. Furthermore, all central governments have ensured that the conversion of the
prices, charges and fees they administer remains price-neutral or benefits the consumer, and local governmentshave been requested to follow this example. Historical examples of cash conversions, like decimalisation in the
United Kingdom and Ireland in 1971, also suggest that the net effect on prices is very limited.These arguments suggest that the overall price effects of the changeover are likely to be limited for the euro
area as a whole. Moreover, they should be spread out over a longer period, and some retailers and suppliers
have pledged not to raise prices during the conversion period. The close monitoring of prices by consumersduring this period may have led to price adjustments being brought forward or postponed. While any effect on
inflation should be of a temporary nature, over the longer term increased price transparency and competition
are likely to contain pressures on prices.Empirical evidence suggests only a limited effect
In 2001, national statistical institutes, the Eurosystem and consumer organisations initiated monitoringexercises of psychologically attractive prices in several euro area countries.
1 By closely following the price
dynamics of selected consumer goods that are usually offered at attractive prices, they have tried to estimate
the actual impact of the conversion of prices into euro. It should be stressed that the identification of
changeover effects is extremely difficult as any price changes might either be due to the changeover (roundingor a pass-through of changeover costs) or just reflect a change in other cost factors (e.g. wages and importprices, etc.) or profits. Bearing this in mind, results of these monitoring exercises confirm that the impact of37the cash changeover on price developments has so far been rather limited. While there has been some evidenceof euro-induced price increases for some specific products in individual countries over recent months, theseeffects have been negligible in terms of their impact on the overall HICP in the euro area countries and in theeuro area as a whole. For January 2002, Eurostat estimated that out of the 0.5% month-on-month increase in
the HICP, the contribution stemming from the euro cash changeover was most likely between 0.0 and0.16 percentage point. Results of business surveys conducted by NCBs and other organisations also generallyconfirm the view that the cash changeover has not affected prices to any significant extent.2To conclude, economic arguments suggest that the impact of the euro cash changeover on prices should be
limited. Actual developments so far indicate that there have been no substantial general price increases
resulting from the euro cash changeover. The introduction of the euro will increase price transparency acrossthe euro area, which should encourage arbitrage and strengthen competition. This should ultimately benefitthe consumers by containing future price increases.1See, for example, ﬁAppendix: price analysis in the period of changeover from the D-Mark to the euroﬂ, Deutsche BundesbankMonthly Bulletin, November 2001 and ﬁEffects of the euro changeover on consumer prices in Finlandﬂ, Statistics Finland and

the indirect effects driving advances in these
components diminished during the secondhalf of 2001.
Wage growth remained moderatein 2001The annual growth rate in compensation peremployee increased slightly in the first twoquarters of 2001 compared with the previousyear (see Chart 15). In the third quarter, the
growth rate declined by 0.1 percentage pointto 2.4%, which is 0.3 percentage point highercompared with the last quarter of 2000. By
contrast, between the second and third
quarters of 2001, the annual growth rate oftotal hourly labour costs in the non-
agricultural business sector increased by0.5 percentage point to 3.4%, and therebydiscontinued the trend decline observed since
the first quarter of 2000. However,
movements in this indicator should be treatedwith caution since its development has been
affected by a series of statistical distortions.Available data at the country level indicate

Real GDP growth declined in the course of
2001 due to a combination of adverse
factorsEconomic growth in the euro area started todecline in the second half of 2000, partly as aresult of the negative impact of the protracted
increase in oil prices on consumption and
investment. In the course of 2001 growthdeclined further, due to a combination of
adverse factors which affected both domesticdemand and exports and which was reflectedin lower activity in both industry and services.
First, higher inflation in the first half of theyear as a result of high price increases for
energy and food dampened growth in real

disposable income. Second, the deteriorationin the external environment, which stemmedmainly from the slowdown in the United

States at the end of 2000, curtailed growth ineuro area exports and increased theuncertainty surrounding investment and, to a
lesser extent, consumption decisions. Third,the terrorist attacks in the United States on11 September 2001 and their aftermath led
to a further sharp increase in overall
uncertainty, reflected in a further decline in
euro area business and consumer confidence.
Consequently, while there were somepreliminary indications of an upturn in euroarea growth during the summer months, this

was subsequently delayed. According toEurostat, real GDP growth in 2001 as a whole
was 1.5%, following the high rate of growth
of 3.4% in 2000 (see Table 6). However, theeuro area economy has maintained solidfundamentals. The decline in inflation and
favourable financial conditions  are conducive
to a gradual strengthening of domesticdemand.Weak growth in domestic demand andexportsThe adverse impact from high rates ofinflation, the deterioration in the externalenvironment and increased uncertainty wasdemonstrated by lower contributions to euro
area real GDP growth from domestic demandand exports. Domestic demand, which wasthe main factor underlying strong growth in
the years 1998 to 2000, was also the mainreason for the decline in real GDP growth in2001 (see Chart 16). Final domestic demand
(i.e. domestic demand excluding changes ininventories) contributed 1.4 percentagepoints to growth in 2001, while in theincreased marginally in the third quarter. This,in combination with the developments in the
annual growth rate of compensation per
employee, implies that the annual growth ratein unit labour costs increased during the firsttwo quarters of 2001 and declined by 0.2
percentage point to 2.3% in the third quarter.Chart 16Contributions to quarterly real GDPgrowth in the euro area(quarterly percentage point contributions)Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.Note: All data are seasonally adjusted.

negative contribution to growth in 2001
of 0.5 percentage point, following a zero
contribution the previous year. By contrast,
the contribution to growth from netexports was 0.6 percentage point in 2001as a whole, which was unchanged compared
with that of 2000. This reflects the factthat the decline in export growth wascounterbalanced by a decline in import

growth.Growth in private consumption stood at 1.0%quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of2001, following more subdued rates of
expansion in the second half of 2000. This
reflected the impact on households™disposable income from reductions in directtaxes in a number of euro area countries at
the end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001.However, the loss of purchasing power as aresult of the high rates of inflation in the firstfew months of 2001 counteracted this
beneficial impact. After the first quarter,growth in private consumption weakened andremained subdued for the remainder of the
year, despite the fact that declining inflationrates underpinned growth in real disposableincome in the second half of 2001. This may
have been due to a delayed and incomplete
adjustment of consumer spending to the taxreductions and to the increased uncertainty
in the outlook for growth and employment,partly resulting from the deterioration inthe external environment. In 2001 as a
whole private consumption grew by 1.8%,following 2.5% the previous year. At the endof 2000 consumer confidence was still at a
record high but subsequently began to declineconsiderably when the components relatedto unemployment expectations and general
economic prospects started to deteriorateAnnual rates 1)Quarterly rates 2)1999200020012000200120012001200120002001200120012001

more than 5% in 1998 and 1999 and more
than 4% in 2000. The weak performance ofinvestment is at least partly explained by the
downward pressure on profitability from high

oil prices and weak external and domesticdemand, as reflected in the decline in capacityutilisation. The deterioration in the external
environment over the course of 2001 alsoincreased uncertainty as regards the timingof an upturn, and this uncertainty was
reinforced by the terrorist attacks in the
United States. Businesses therefore delayedtheir investment decisions, despite favourable

financing conditions and continued wagemoderation.Growth in exports and imports declined at
a broadly similar paceEuro area exports and imports increased by3.4% and 1.8% respectively in 2001, withgrowth being around 9 percentage points
lower in both cases than in 2000. As a result,the contribution from net exports to realGDP growth in 2001 was unchanged
compared with that of the previous year.National accounts data for exports andimports in the euro area include intra-euroarea trade and therefore reflect both externaland domestic influences. The volume data on
extra-euro area and intra-euro area trade ingoods from the external trade statistics
suggest that the decline in the year-on-year
rate of growth in extra-euro area exportsstarted at around the same time as that inintra-euro area exports but that it was
somewhat stronger in the course of 2001.The determinants underlying these declineswere different, though, with extra-euro areaChart 18Euro area exports of goods andindustrial production(volumes, annual percentage changes)Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.Note: Data shown are calculated from three-month centred

Chart 18).The degree of dispersion of real GDPgrowth rates among euro area countries
declined in 2001In 2001 the spread of GDP growth between thetwo euro area countries with the highest andthe lowest rates fell to around 5.5 percentage
points from 8.5 percentage points in 2000. The
standard deviation declined to around 1.7percentage points from 2.5 percentage points in2000. Annual average real GDP growth declined
sharply in all euro area countries in 2001,without exception, although the extent of the
slowdown differed somewhat.The slowdown in real GDP growth was
initially driven by a contraction of industrialactivityThe adverse external factors had theirstrongest and most direct effect on output inthe industrial sector. In 2001 as a whole
growth in real value added in industryexcluding construction was 1.0%, following a
rate of over 4% the previous year (see
Table 6). Quarter-on-quarter, growth waspositive in the first quarter of 2001 but turnednegative in the remainder of the year. This
largely shaped the pattern of real GDPgrowth.The decline of output in industry (excludingconstruction and energy) started in the firstquarter of 2001 and was initially due to
declines in the intermediate goods sector andin the consumer goods sector (see Table 7).In the second quarter a decline in the capital
goods sector reinforced the decline in overall
production. In 2001 as a whole production
growth declined strongly in the capital goods
and intermediate goods sector, being around7 percentage points lower in both casesthan in 2000. For export-sensitive sectors,
this reflects in particular the negative impactof a deteriorating external environment,reinforced by an unwinding of the high rates
of expansion in sectors producing informationand communications goods. In the euro area,growth in the manufacture of radio, television
and communication equipment, together withthe manufacture of office machinery andcomputers, declined from around 20% inAnnual rates 1)Quarterly rates 2)1999200020012000200120012001200120002001200120012001

422000 to around -2% in 2001. While growth inthe capital goods sector remained positive in
2001 as a whole, growth in the intermediate
goods sector was negative. The decline ingrowth in the consumer goods sector was
relatively limited, from 2.4% in 2000 to zero

in 2001, but this was mainly due to a limitedslowdown in the production of non-durable
consumer goods, while for durable consumer
goods the slowdown was much morepronounced.Output in the construction sector asmeasured by real value added declined by0.6% in 2001, following growth of around 2%
in the previous two years. The decline in
2001 was mostly due to weaker constructionactivity in the first half of the year, while
there were signs of stabilisation in thesecond half. The weakness in constructionwas attributable to a number of factors. In

particular, housing and office space
construction had increased during the pastyears of strong economic growth, creating

oversupply in some countries. Moreover, theincreased uncertainty in the course of 2001regarding the outlook for growth and
employment may have prompted businessesand households Œ despite favourable financing
conditions Œ to delay investment decisions
that involve a high degree of financial
commitment and irreversibility.Developments in activity in the servicessector lagged somewhat behind those in the

industrial sectorGrowth of real value added in the servicessector declined by around 1 percentage point in2001, mainly due to a slowdown in the growthof market-related services from 4.5% in 2000 to
3.1% in 2001. All the main shocks affecting
economic growth in the euro area in 2001 arelikely to have had a direct negative impact on
activity in market-related services. For example,high oil prices and the terrorist attacks havehad an adverse effect on activities related to
transportation. In addition, the decline in outputgrowth in market-related services could be adelayed response to the decline in industrialactivity, considering that a large proportion ofbusiness services are related to the productionprocess in the industrial sector.Employment growth slowed markedly in2001On average, euro area employment isestimated to have increased at a slower pacein 2001 (around 1.4%) than in the previousthree years, i.e. compared with 2.1% in 2000
and 1.6% in both 1999 and 1998 (seeTable 8). The quarter-on-quarter growth rateof employment slowed down markedly
throughout the year from 0.5% in the lastquarter of 2000 to close to zero in the lastquarter of 2001, reflecting, with a lag, the
deceleration in economic activity recordedsince the second half of 2000.
All sectors contributed to the slowdown intotal employment growth in 2001 (seeTable 8). The sharp reduction in employment
growth in market-related services (trade,transport, finance and business services),which represent over a third of total
employment, appears to have been the maindriving force behind the slowdown inemployment growth. After a relatively strong
increase in industrial employment in 2000,employment growth fell in the first threequarters of 2001 in both construction and
manufacturing, which are generally verysensitive to developments in economic activity.Employment in the agricultural sector continued
to decline in 2001, although at a slightly slowerpace than in recent years. With a year-on-yeargrowth rate of over 2.1% on average in the first
three quarters of 2001, the services sectorcontinued to foster net job creation, albeit at aslower pace than in 2000.Unemployment remained broadlyunchanged in 2001
The standardised rate of unemployment was8.3% on average in 2001, compared with 8.8%in 2000. By contrast with the strong andsteady decline in unemployment observed43from mid-1997 until the end of 2000, theeuro area rate of unemployment fell slightly
between January and April 2001, stabilisedbetween May and August and increased inthe latter part of the year, in line with the
slowdown in employment growth (seeChart 19). The number of unemployed in theeuro area diminished by only 7,000 over the
course of the year, compared with more thanone million per year in the period from1998 to 2000. On average in 2001, there
were around 11.4 million unemployed inthe euro area, a level last seen in 1992.These developments occurred in a context

of sustained labour force growth (around0.9%) in 2001.Although all age groups and both genders havebeen adversely affected by less favourabledevelopments in the labour market, those with
higher unemployment, namely women and theyoung, do not appear to have suffered more
from the recent economic downturn. Overall,
the youth unemployment rate remained broadlyunchanged at 16.7% between the last quarter of
2000 and the last quarter of 2001, while the
unemployment rate of those aged 25 and overdeclined by 0.1 percentage point to 7.3% in thesame period. Unemployment for both agegroups followed a similar pattern, declining untilspring 2001 and rising from late summer to
December 2001. While the male unemploymentrate increased during 2001, the female1999200020011999199920002000200020002001200120012001

average male unemployment rate (6.9%) andthe female rate (10.2%) continued to narrowslightly. Overall, the convergence of
unemployment rates across age groups and
genders, particularly noticeable during theperiod of strong economic growth between
1997 and 2000, continued in the course of2001 across genders but came to a halt acrossage groups.The increase in unemployment occurred inmost euro area countries. However, somecountries with high unemployment ratesregistered a slight decline in their respective
rate during the year. As a consequence, the
dispersion of unemployment rates acrosseuro area countries continued to narrow in
2001.The relatively good performance of euro areaemployment over the last few years taken

together may be partly attributable to thereforms in labour and product markets and
continued wage moderation. Recent progress
with structural reforms in euro area productand labour markets is summarised in Box 4.
Box 4Progress with structural reforms in euro area product and labour markets
Structural reforms aimed at increasing the flexibility of euro area product and labour markets are likely to havesubstantial economic benefits and lower the adjustment costs associated with economic shocks. Against thisbackground, the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 emphasised the importance of structural reforms to
promote growth and employment in the EU. In particular, the European Council regards product and labourmarket reforms as a key condition for the EU to become the most competitive and dynamic economy in theworld. This message was reconfirmed in the conclusions of the Stockholm, Laeken and Barcelona European
Councils in 2001 and 2002. In this context, this box briefly reviews the progress made with structural reformsin euro area product and labour markets during 2001.Some progress with structural reforms in euro area product markets has been made over the last few years,
especially with regard to the integration of goods markets and regulatory reforms in network industries.
Product market integration proceeded further in 2001, although some of the agreed measures will only beimplemented in a few years™ time. The average share of non-implemented Internal Market Directives in the
euro area countries declined from around 3.3% in November 2000 to around 2.7% in October 2001.
Furthermore, the Council of Ministers adopted the European Company Statute in October 2001. This Statutegives enterprises the option to form a company, which can then operate on an EU-wide basis being governedby Community law directly applicable in all Member States. Concerning regulatory reforms in network
industries, agreement was reached on a more far-reaching Œ although still incomplete 
Œ liberalisation of the
EU™s postal sector. Furthermore, a new package of Directives concerning reforms in the telecommunicationssector was agreed. To the extent that these reforms succeed in increasing the level of de facto competition in
euro area product markets, they are likely to result in downward effects on consumer prices and improvedlonger-term employment and growth prospects.Despite the encouraging developments described above, the pace of liberalisation has differed considerablyacross Member States and incumbents™ market shares have remained very high. It should also be noted that
EU Member States have not agreed on a number of important reform projects in 2001, such as the draft take-
over Directive and an EU-wide patent. The European Council in Barcelona decided that all European non-household consumers will be able to freely choose their electricity and gas suppliers as of 2004. However, nocommitment was made with regard to opening up the market for households. Furthermore, in most countries,
the distribution of electricity and gas is still a legal regional or local monopoly and there is a risk that most ofthe benefits of liberalisation will be captured by these monopolists and not passed on to consumers.45Moving to euro area 
labour markets, structural reforms have been uneven across countries since, contrary toproduct markets where the implementation of structural reforms is often linked to the application of ECDirectives, labour market reform is more strongly based on national initiatives.
In 2001, some euro area countries implemented reforms to lower the tax burden on labour with a view toincreasing work incentives. These efforts continued the trend of reductions in taxes and social security
contributions, which had gained importance over the 1990s. A number of member countries have also agreedupon or initiated measures to improve the job search process, either by attempting to increase work incentivesthrough reforms of the unemployment benefit system or by efforts to raise the efficiency of services provided
by employment agencies. Finally, some efforts were made to expand the use of part-time contracts. Reducingthe strictness of employment protection legislation was not on the agenda in 2001.The existence of high and persistent levels of unemployment and low labour market participation in several euroarea countries indicate that further and more comprehensive labour market reforms are needed. Of particularimportance are flexible wages and increased wage differentiation, reforms of tax and benefit systems encouraging
job search instead of non-participation, improved education, training and life-long learning avoiding thedepreciation and obsolescence of human capital and less restrictive employment protection regulations. That said,employment growth and the reduction in unemployment during the strong economic expansion of 1997-2000 were
more considerable than earlier in the 1990s, which indicates that the labour market reforms conducted in euro areacountries over recent years have been progressing in the right direction.In sum, existing hurdles to flexibility and competition in euro area product and labour markets are graduallybeing removed, but considerable further efforts are needed if the ambition to transform the EU into the mostcompetitive and dynamic economy in the world is to be realised. As emphasised by the European Council in
Barcelona in 2002, policies for the promotion of employment and the integration of European marketstherefore need to be given specific emphasis.5Fiscal developments
Deterioration of budget balances in 2001The average budget balance in the euro area
deteriorated in 2001 for the first time since1993. The latest available data from Eurostatshow a deficit of 1.3% of GDP, compared
with a deficit of 0.8% in 2000 (both figuresexclude proceeds from the sale of UMTSlicences) (see Table 9). Including UMTS

proceeds, the 2000 surplus of 0.2% turned
into a deficit of 1.3% of GDP in 2001. Factorsthat account for the budgetary deterioration
are the working of automatic stabilisers inthe context of the slowdown in economicactivity and the implementation of major tax
cuts in some euro area countries withoutsufficient offsetting expenditure restraint. Asa consequence, most countries failed to meet
the budget balances targeted in the stabilityprogrammes that were submitted at theend of 2000 and at the beginning of 2001. Onaverage, these targets were missed by 0.7%of GDP.
Although the average euro area deficitdeteriorated, a few countries managed toimprove their fiscal balances in 2001 (Greece,

Spain, Italy and Austria), partially due, in somecases, to the lagged effects of high economicgrowth in 2000 on tax revenues and one-off
measures. While seven countries reported
balanced budgets or surpluses in 2001 and one
country had a deficit below 0.5% of GDP, the
remaining four countries (Germany, France, Italyand Portugal) continued to report relatively highdeficits. In Germany and Portugal, deficits were
even reported around 1 percentage point abovethe target set in the previous round of stabilityprogrammes. In 2001 both the Portuguese
deficit of 2.2% of GDP and, especially, theGerman deficit of 2.7% of GDP were not farfrom the 3% reference value laid down in the
46Maastricht Treaty. Only four countries (Spain,Luxembourg, Austria and Finland) managed to
achieve the targets of the previous stabilityprogrammes and two of them (Luxembourgand Austria) overachieved their budget target
by a wider margin.The government expenditure ratio declinedslightly in the euro area in 2001 as a result ofcontinuing lower interest expenditures. The
primary expenditure ratio increased slightly,
after having declined by about ¾ percentage
point in 2000. About half of the countriessucceeded in bringing down the share of
government expenditure in GDP further.Government investment stabilised in the euro

area in 2001 at 2.5% of GDP. As in previousyears, healthcare expenditure targets wereoverrun in many countries in 2001. With a
few exceptions, revenue ratios declined in alleuro area countries in 2001, due mainly tomajor cuts in taxes and social security
contributions in many Member States(Belgium, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy,Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Finland).The euro area government debt ratio
decreased by 1.0 percentage point to 69.1%Sources: Eurostat and the ECB for euro area aggregates.Note: Data are based on the ESA 95.

47in 2001. The decline was smaller than initiallytargeted due to deteriorating fiscal balancesand lower than expected economic growth.
However, the debt ratio did not increase inany of the euro area countries, with theexception of Portugal. The reduction was
particularly strong in Spain and Greece, withdeclines of more than 3 percentage points.Debt-deficit adjustments, which leave the
deficit ratio unaffected but have an impact ongovernment debt levels, amounted to 0.3% ofGDP in 2001. A further explanation of the
limited decline in the debt ratio is that in
some countries significant proceeds fromprivatisation have been used to undertake

other financial transactions, such as equityinjections into public enterprises.According to European Commission data,after the relaxation of fiscal policies in 2000,the euro area fiscal stance was loosened in
2001, as shown by a further decline in the
cyclically adjusted primary surplus. Thisloosening was most evident in countries
where major tax cuts were implementedwithout sufficient offsetting expenditurerestraint. However, beyond this discretionary
fiscal relaxation, the budgetary outcomes in2001 were also affected by the functioningof automatic stabilisers. The budgetary
deterioration compared with the initialstability programme targets mainly reflectsthe budgetary impact of the economic
slowdown compared with the relativelyoptimistic macroeconomic projections 
Œ in
retrospect Œ on which the initial budgetary
plans for 2001 were based, as most countriesdid not restrict the free operation of
automatic stabilisers.Assessment of stability programmesA comparison of the 2002 targets in thestability programmes submitted at the end
of 2001 with the targets included in thepreviously submitted programmes, about oneyear before, reveals that most countries have
adapted their nominal budgetary target tothe deteriorating economic environment. Thisreflects the worse than expected budgetaryoutcomes in 2001, as well as the operation ofautomatic stabilisers in 2002. Overall, the
fiscal stance planned for the euro area in
2002 in the updated stability programmes is
slightly restrictive.
Countries that still face fiscal imbalances need
to make progress towards achieving positionsﬁclose to balance or in surplusﬂ. At present,the room for manoeuvre which some of
these countries have in allowing automaticstabilisers to continue to operate, is very

limited because nominal deficits in thesecountries have come closer to the 3% of GDPreference value. Deficits could even exceed
that level if planned consolidation measuresare less effective than projected, if expenditure
overruns recur, or if the economic recovery
were to be weaker or delayed as comparedwith the relatively optimistic assumptions foreconomic growth in some stability programmes.The latest stability programmes reconfirm thecommitment to achieving balanced budgetary
positions by 2003 for Italy and by 2004 forGermany, France and Portugal. Maintaining
this commitment prevents the medium-term
objective of budgetary positions close to balanceor in surplus from becoming a moving target. Inthis way, the credibility of the Stability and
Growth Pact is preserved. However, themeasures required to achieve such an objectiveare not always well specified. In addition,
progress towards the deficit targets issometimes pursued via one-off measures, suchas the sale of real estate, which does not

constitute durable fiscal consolidation (notablyin Italy, where one-off measures will have tobe replaced by permanent measures currently

under discussion).
In view of the fiscal developments in 2001and the projected outcomes for 2002, theCommission recommended an early warningto Germany and Portugal in January 2002.

The ECOFIN Council considered that
the subsequent reconfirmation and evenstrengthening of the fiscal commitments by
these two countries was a sufficient responseto the concerns underlying the Commission
recommendation, and forcefully supported the
48attainment of sound budgetary positionsby 2003/04 in its opinions on the updatedstability programmes of the countries with

remaining imbalances.Countries that have already achieved soundbudgetary positions should let automaticstabilisers operate symmetrically over thecycle, thus contributing to macroeconomic
stability. Discretionary cyclical fiscal policy,on the other hand, is not warranted becausein the past it has not produced the beneficial
effects expected. Long lags have oftenresulted in a delayed pro-cyclical impact ofmeasures aimed at stabilising economic
fluctuations. Moreover, governments havebeen more prone to stimulate economies in
cyclical downturns than to moderate their
expansion in prosperous times. In particular,
they have shown more diligence in adoptingexpenditure increasing measures that were
intended to be only temporary, than inscrapping them when economic conditionsno longer justified them. This asymmetric
behaviour, if protracted, generates an upwarddrift in public spending and deficit ratios thatcan put the sustainability of public finances atrisk.Progress on structural reform of public
financesStructural reform of public finances shouldbe high on the agenda, following theconclusions of the Lisbon European Council
held in 2000 on increasing Europe™s growthpotential. By fostering economic growth, well-
designed fiscal reform measures not onlyimprove welfare but also contribute to the
sustainability of public finances in the longerrun (see Box 5). Overall, however, progressin improving the role of public finances in

supporting potential growth has been limited.The tax cuts implemented so far or plannedare welcome from a structural perspective,as they can enhance medium to long-termeconomic growth. They should, however,
be preceded, or at least accompanied, byBox 5Fiscal policy and long-term economic growth
One of the major challenges for the euro area is to increase long-term growth prospects. Over the pastfour decades, growth has been slowing down in most euro area countries and averaged only 2% over the1990s, 1 percentage point below that of the United States. One key factor in this relatively poor performance
has been the lack of a dynamic environment conducive to investment and employment creation. Comprehensivefiscal reforms will be needed to achieve a higher potential growth rate.The contribution of public finances to long-term growthThe basic determinants of growth are savings, human and physical capital investment, technological changeand employment growth. The main ways in which fiscal policies influence these growth determinants are viathe stability and sustainability of public finances, and expenditure and tax policies. The role of fiscal policiesin promoting potential growth in the euro area has been mixed.Stability and sustainability of public financesStable and sustainable public finances require low deficits and public debt. Such fiscal accounts enhance
expectations of macroeconomic stability, a predictable fiscal policy framework and favourable long-termfinancing conditions. This, in turn, creates an environment favourable to investors, innovators and entrepreneurs.Expenditure policiesPublic expenditure can also affect growth through its level and design. Expenditure programmes in generalneed to be weighed against the efficiency costs of such activities (for example, compared with the private49sector), the resulting disincentives to work, invest and save, and the distortions created by the taxes needed tofinance them. Generous social benefits, for example, may provide strong disincentives to work. Governmentsectors are relatively large, also from an international perspective, and most euro area countries™ public
spending exceeds 40% of GDP.Tax policiesTax policies are an important determinant of long-term growth. In particular, high personal, corporate and
capital income taxes reduce the incentive to work, to invest in education and physical capital and to save. Asregards the efficiency of financing the public sector via tax policies, the situation is not yet satisfactory;likewise from an international perspective. Marginal income taxes and average tax burdens are still relatively
high, and public revenue exceeds 40% of GDP in most euro area countries. Some progress has been made inrestructuring tax systems and reducing marginal income tax burdens. But the scope for reductions in taxes islimited as it should be accompanied by sufficient expenditure restraint.
Fiscal policies in Europe™s growth strategyAt its meeting in Stockholm in March 2001, the European Council agreed on a strategy paper to improve thequality and sustainability of public finances in order to enhance its contribution to growth and employment.The strategy focuses on three key channels. First, governments should support a stable macroeconomic
environment via fiscal consolidation and debt reduction and should also promote further employment andpension reforms. Second, they should make tax and benefit systems more employment-friendly by means oftax cuts and benefit reform. Third, they should redirect public expenditures towards physical and human
capital accumulation. The report suggests a comprehensive strategy. This would help economic growth andemployment by supporting consolidation, sustainability and growth in a virtuous circle.Well-designed institutions that create incentives to pursue stability and sustainability-oriented policies areessential in achieving such objectives. Similarly, reform of the rules and institutions governing tax andexpenditure policies in euro area countries should be considered. Hence, the rules governing the extent of
government involvement in the financing and provision of goods, services and social insurance and in the waysuch activities are conducted need to be scrutinised and reformed, when appropriate.6The global macroeconomic environment, exchange rates and
the balance of paymentsThe global economy deterioratedsignificantly in 2001The global economy experienced a markedslowdown throughout 2001, following arecord year of economic growth in 2000.World GDP growth is estimated to have
reached 2% in 2001, down from 4.6% in 2000,the highest growth rate since the mid-1980s.The growth rate of world trade declinedeven more sharply, down from 12.5% to an
estimated 0.7%. Important determinants ofthis slowdown were a decline in demand forinformation and communication technologyoffsetting expenditure restraint so as not toput the attainment or maintenance of soundbudgetary positions at risk. In view of thegrowth-promoting role of public investments,
such expenditure restraint should focus oncurrent expenditure. In 2002, by contrast,the primary expenditure ratio is forecast toincrease by ½ percentage point. Moreover,
as expenditure overruns have often thwartedconsolidation efforts in the past, effectivemechanisms to monitor and contain spending,

at all levels of government, would improvethe credibility of budget targets.50(ICT) products, notably in the United States,a general deterioration in global economic
conditions and the lagged impact of the sharp
rise in oil prices in 2000 (see Box 6). The
terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 added
to the uncertainty and had a short-lived but
immediate impact on economic activity.In 2001, the ten-year expansion of theeconomy in the United States came to a haltand the National Bureau of EconomicResearch (NBER) declared in November 2001
that a recession had started in March 2001.In its statement, the NBER stressed theimportance of the terrorist attacks of
11 September in intensifying an already
pronounced slowdown of real GDP growth.In 2001, real GDP grew by 1.2%, compared
with 4.1% in 2000. At the same time, labour
productivity in the non-farm business sector
increased by, on average, 1.9%, after growing
by 3.3% in 2000. The main factor driving realGDP growth down in the course of 2001 was
the sharp contraction of private business

fixed investment and inventories. In 2001,real private business fixed investment declined
by 1.9%, compared with an increase of 7.6%
in 2000. Overall, real GDP growth in 2001was supported by private consumptiongrowth, which contributed 2.1 percentage
points, after 3.3 percentage points in 2000,and by public expenditure, while thesharp contraction of real exports, relative

to real imports, brought the contributionof net foreign trade to real GDP growth
to -0.1 percentage point compared with
-0.8 percentage point in 2000.
Against this background, the imbalances inthe US economy were not fully corrected. Inparticular, private sector credit expansioncontinued while the ﬁnet cash flow/debtserviceﬂ ratio of the corporate sector
declined. The expansion of household debtalso continued and the household debt
service burden remained at historically highlevels. Furthermore, the slowdown in the USeconomy contributed only marginally to the
improvement in the current account-to-GDPratio, from 4.5% in 2000 to 4.1% in 2001.Concerning inflation, the decline in oil prices
contributed to a significant reduction ofinflationary pressures in the United States.
Annual inflation, as measured by theconsumer and producer price indices,dropped to 2.8% and 2% respectively in 2001,
down from 3.3% and 3.6% respectively in2000. However, despite the weakeningof domestic demand, the growth rate of

the Consumer Price Index (CPI) excludingfood and energy, which delivers a morereliable picture of underlying price pressures,
increased marginally to 2.6%, from 2.4% in2000.Against the background of a deeper and moreprotracted slowdown of economic activitythan previously expected, the Federal Open

Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal
Reserve System reduced its target for thefederal funds rate in a number of successive
steps throughout the year to a 40-year lowof 1.75% on 11 December 2001; the targethad been 6.5% at the end of 2000. According
to official FOMC statements, monetary policyactions in 2001 were driven by persistentprospects for a deterioration in economic
conditions, following the contemporaneousadjustment in the corporate sector and theslowdown in private consumption growth. In

February 2001, the new Administration
submitted a proposal to Congress for apermanent reduction in revenue, notably
deriving from personal income taxes. In May2001, Congress approved a resolution thatfixed the total tax reduction for the period
from 2002 to 2011 at USD 1,350 billion,compared with that of USD 1,600 billion
originally proposed by the Administration.In Japan, after some tentative signs ofeconomic recovery in 2000, economic
conditions deteriorated noticeably, partlyas a result of the slowdown in globaldemand in 2001, in a context of structural
problems in the private business sectorand a continuous slump in asset prices.
In line with rapidly falling export growth
and amid rising inventory levels, industrialproduction declined throughout most of the51Box 6Determinants of international business cycle synchronisationAn important feature of the slowdown in the world economy in 2001 was the high degree of synchronisationacross the major economies. More synchronised business cycles are important factors in economic forecastsand policy-making. In particular, if the observed increase in the synchronisation of business cycles is the resultof stronger transmission mechanisms between business cycles in different countries associated with the
globalisation process, even relatively closed and large economies may be exposed more strongly to spilloversfrom abroad. In that case, when assessing the outlook for a particular country, the weight of the internationalenvironment should be increased substantially. The main factors determining international business cycle
synchronisation are trade links, cross-border financial asset diversification, confidence spillovers and commonshocks.In general, economic interdependence between different countries is, to a significant extent, a reflection oftrade links. In the long run, such links through international trade have tended to intensify, as trade volumes
have expanded faster than world output. For example, the openness of the euro area has increased significantlyover the past decade. Exports of goods to countries outside the euro area increased from 9% of GDP in 1991 tomore than 15% of GDP in 2000. In a similar way, goods imports rose from 11% of GDP to 16% of GDP in this

period. International production chains, which have been a determinant of the observed rise in openness, havebecome a significant factor in spillovers via the trade channel. For example, the recent slowdown in the UnitedStates is strongly related to a sharp decline in US demand for information and communication technology
(ICT) products, which are highly tradable and involve international production chains. As a consequence, theslowdown that started in the United States in the second half of 2000 quickly spread to the small openeconomies in South-East Asia, the main producers of ICT products and major importers of goods from third
countries such as the euro area. In the recent cyclical downswing, the euro area was exposed not only to directtrade effects related to a slowdown of the US economy, but also to indirect third-country effects related to theimpact of the slowdown in the United States on South-East Asia and other areas of the world, which were only
felt, however, in the course of 2001.This underscores the fact that the trade channel does not capture the full size of transmission. Against thisbackground, attention has more recently turned to financial linkages. Private, corporate and institutionalinvestors have greatly increased the cross-border diversification of their assets and liabilities over the past fewyears. Specifically, firms have considerably expanded their operations internationally Œ in particular, through
mergers and acquisitions Œ and sales revenue from operations of foreign affiliates generally account for an
increasing share of total sales revenue. Between 1980 and 2000, foreign assets and liabilities of residents in allmajor advanced economies more than doubled as a percentage of GDP. With the exception of Japan,
international asset diversification accelerated remarkably in the 1990s. At the end of the millennium, the sumtotal of foreign assets and liabilities in many major economies was close to 100% of GDP. As a result of cross-border investment, both firms and households may have been more directly exposed to developments abroad.
Moreover, and possibly as a reflection of increased cross-border investment, financial markets have becomemore closely correlated in recent years, in particular with regard to equity returns. Equity prices affect thefinancing conditions of enterprises and the wealth of private households. Consequently, equity price correlation
can potentially be a significant transmission channel in itself. Financial linkages, therefore, could have playeda role in the recent episode of synchronisation.In addition, confidence spillovers may play a role in the transmission of business cycles. While a high cross-country correlation of confidence measures may merely be a reflection of a high underlying correlation of realbusiness cycles, it may also be the result of spillovers. For example, if residents simply ﬁimitateﬂ the behaviour
of their counterparts abroad, confidence spillovers could prevail irrespective of existing economic linkages. Astrong correlation in business confidence linkages has been observed between the United States and the euroarea in the period from 1999 to 2001, with a correlation coefficient of up to 0.8 (with a lag of three quarters52year, particularly in the ICT-intensiveelectrical machinery sector. The weakness in
the manufacturing sector increasingly spreadto other sectors of the economy and led to a
sharp deterioration in the labour market
situation, with the unemployment ratereaching an unprecedented level of 5.5% inDecember 2001 and the number of overtime
hours worked declining rapidly. As privateconsumption spending declined and businessfixed investment decelerated, overall GDP
growth contracted in the second and thirdquarters of 2001, causing concern about anincrease in non-performing loans and financial
sector health in general.On the price side, deflationary pressuresintensified during most of 2001, leading to anaverage decline of 0.7% in the CPI. Against
this background, the Bank of Japan took
several decisions to ease the monetary stancein 2001. Most notably, in mid-March 2001, itchanged its main operating target for money
market operations from the uncollateralisedovernight call rate to the outstanding balanceof the current accounts held at the Bank of
Japan. It also announced that the newoperating strategy would be maintained untilthe annual rate of change in the CPI
(excluding perishables) stabilised at or above0%. The target for the current accountbalance was initially set at JPY 5 trillion, but

was later increased in successive steps to a
range of JPY 10 trillion to JPY 15 trillion.
Moreover, the amount of outright purchases
of long-term government bonds wasincreased from JPY 400 billion to JPY 1 trillionper month. As a result of this policy, theuncollateralised overnight call rate was keptclose to zero. As to fiscal policy, the Japanese
Parliament passed a supplementary budget for
the 2001 fiscal year in November 2001,
containing JPY 3 trillion of additional

expenditure, which emphasised structuralreform, including measures to strengthen the
social safety net, and a second supplementary
package of JPY 2.6 trillion was approved at
the beginning of 2002. As a consequence, thegeneral government overall budget deficit
rose to 6.4% of GDP in 2001, causing thedebt-to-GDP ratio to increase to 132% in
2001.In Asia, many emerging economies
experienced a sharp economic downturn
driven by the collapse of ICT exports. Inmany of the small open economies, thedecline in external trade spilled over into the
domestic economy, leading to increasedpressure on firms and households, therebyweakening domestic demand. In addition, net
private capital inflows slowed down Œ partly
reflecting increasing economic uncertaintyand the impact of external developments Œcontributing to a further dampening of
economic activity. As a result, those openeconomies most heavily exposed to the ICT

sector experienced a GDP contraction overthe year. However, the more closedeconomies of China and India proved rather
resilient to external developments andrecorded robust annual real GDP growthrates, estimated at 7.3% and 5.0% respectively,

on account of strong domestic investment andconsumption spending. Against this backdrop,weakening GDP growth in the region led towith regard to the United States), compared with a correlation coefficient of 0.4 for the period from 1990 to
2001.1The currently observed parallel development of growth in major economic regions in the world may, however,
also reflect common shocks. Since the first oil crisis in the early 1970s, major slowdowns in the worldeconomy have often been associated with the lagged impact of sharp oil price increases. This could also holdtrue for the slowdown in major world economies in 2001, as oil prices in US dollar terms have more than
tripled in the period from 1999 to 2000. However, a robust judgement regarding the relative importance of thevarious possible determinants of the observed business cycle synchronisation would require more solidtheoretical and empirical foundations than are currently available.1IMF: World Economic Outlook October 2001, Box 2.1.
53diminishing inflationary pressures, which were
reinforced by lower oil prices in the latter partof the year.
Compared with other emerging markets,transition countries managed to weather the
global slowdown and the aftermath of theterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001relatively well. In the majority of these
countries, output growth was fairly strong inthe first half of the year, and only graduallybegan to moderate in the second half of 2001
as export growth weakened. Overall, the
financial markets coped relatively well withinstances of international turbulence, as
signalled by the limited response of sovereignbond spreads to events in Argentina andTurkey. In Russia, real GDP growth is

estimated to have reached 5% in 2001, after8.3% in 2000. Benefiting from past higher oil
prices, the country™s fiscal and externalaccounts improved, which also led to asizeable reduction in its external debtexposure. In the course of the year, however,
the external factors underpinning growthweakened as oil prices declined, the realexchange rate appreciated and the global
environment became less supportive.Growth also began to moderate in mostcentral and eastern European countries,following a robust performance in the firsthalf of the year. In many countries, inflation
abated, which partly reflected stability-oriented monetary policies and weakeningeconomic activity. The main concern was
related to a certain degree of deteriorationin public deficits that could only be partlyattributed to the structural expenditure
associated with the transition process. In theCzech Republic, growth peaked in the firstquarter of 2001, fostered by strong domestic
demand and buoyant foreign directinvestment flows, before decelerating in thesecond half of the year. Similarly, output
growth in Hungary was initially sustained bythe upturn in household consumption. In thecourse of the year, however, lower external
demand increasingly started to have animpact, as shown by the weakening export-oriented manufacturing sector and by subduedinvestment growth. In Poland, adverse domesticconditions and, subsequently, lower external
demand reduced output growth to just above1% in 2001, down from 4% in 2000.In Turkey, weak economic fundamentals, aswell as the high vulnerability of the bankingsector, led to the floating of the Turkish lira

towards the end of February 2001, whichadded to upward inflationary pressure. In the
second half of the year, thanks also to the
involvement of the IMF, market concernsabout the sustainability of domestic debteased somewhat, as reflected by a significant
improvement in a range of financial market
indicators.In 2001, the Latin American countries wereadversely hit by the global economicdownturn, as well as by the worsening

economic crisis in Argentina. As a result,economic activity in the region reached astandstill after the strong growth registered
the year before. In Argentina, financialsupport from multilateral organisations,
accompanied by massive debt restructuring
programmes and fiscal austerity measures,
proved ineffective in preventing high
uncertainty and declining economic activity.
Such negative developments led to the default
on government obligations and Œ in early 2002
Œ the abandonment of the decade-long
currency board system. Argentina™s financialturmoil contributed until October 2001 tothe deterioration of the economic situation
in Brazil, which Œ having entered 2001 growing
at a robust pace 
Œ was also negatively affected
by both the global slowdown and a severe
domestic power shortage. In addition, foreigndirect investment flows to Brazil fell sharplyfrom the previous year™s record levels,highlighting the vulnerability of the countryto adverse external shocks. The Mexicaneconomy showed little contagion from the
difficulties in South America, but economic
activity decelerated markedly in response to
developments in the United States and the
moderation in oil prices, given that Mexico isa net oil exporter.54Africa is the only major economic regionwhich showed stronger growth in 2001 thanin the preceding year (around 4% in 2001,
compared with 2.8% in 2000), mainly inrelation to the end of the drought in the
Maghreb countries. However, with exports

accounting for more than one-third of African
GDP, economic activity in the region wasalso affected by the global slowdown. In
addition, market conditions for most non-fuel commodities, not all of which are closelycorrelated to the global cycle, were relatively
weak in 2001.Euro broadly stable in the second half of2001Following the strong rebound in the last fewmonths of 2000 and in early January 2001,the external value of the euro gradually
declined, in nominal effective terms, reachinga trough in June 2001. During the second halfof the year, however, the single currency
strengthened and subsequently stabilised atlevels slightly higher than the average in 2000(see Chart 20). These developments took

place against a backdrop of a slowdown inglobal economic activity and increaseduncertainty regarding the relative growth

prospects in the major economic areas.Overall, at the end of 2001, the nominaleffective exchange rate of the euro was more
than 2% lower than at the beginning ofthe year, but more than 1½% above itsaverage level in 2000. On 5 March 2002,
the cut-off date for this Annual Report, theeuro™s nominal effective exchange rate haddepreciated by 1.1% compared with the
average for 2001. As for the real effective
exchange rates, which are adjusted for theprice and labour cost differentials between
the euro area and its partner countries, thesehave moved broadly in tandem with thenominal index.In late 2000 and early 2001, the euro
appreciated vis-à-vis the US dollar, amidimminent signs of a slowdown in the UnitedStates. Subsequently, however, the eurodepreciated against the US dollar throughoutmost of the first half of 2001, reaching a low ofUSD 0.8384 on 6 July 2001. This 
developmentappears to have been associated with astream of data releases confirming aslowdown in euro area growth as well as a

prevailing perception in financial markets that
the US economy would rebound more swiftlythan the euro area economy. As prospects
for a rapid rebound in US economic activitystarted to fade in August 2001, the eurorebounded vis-à-vis the US dollar, with theappreciation being amplified against the
background of increased global risk aversionin the aftermath of the tragic events of
11 September. As market uncertaintysubsided in the months that followed, theeuro stabilised at a somewhat lower level.
At the end of 2001, the euro was quoted atUSD 0.88, which was almost 6
½% lower than
at the beginning of the year and more than
4½% below its 2000 average. On 5 March,the euro traded at USD 0.87, which was 3.1%below its average in 2001.The euro appreciated against the Japaneseyen in 2001. During most of the first half ofChart 20Nominal effective exchange rate of

The euro came under some temporarydepreciating pressure in May 2001, mainly inresponse to firming evidence on the extent
of the slowdown in economic activity in theeuro area. Over the summer, however,
deteriorating business conditions in Japan
contributed to the euro™s rebound towardslevels seen at the beginning of the year.Between September and November 2001, the
euro traded around an average value of JPY108.95, before appreciating strongly amid a
further deterioration of the economic
situation in Japan towards the end of theyear. On 28 December, the euro stood at
JPY 115.33, which was about 6½% higherthan at the beginning of the year and almost16% higher than the average in 2000. On5 March, the euro was quoted at JPY 114.46,
i.e. 5.3% higher than the 2001 average.Turning, finally, to the Swiss franc, broad
stability characterised its evolution againstthe euro in the course of the year, at least
up to September 2001. The terrorist attacks

against the United States triggered an
appreciation of that currency vis-à-vis theeuro, probably due to ﬁsafe havenﬂconsiderations. By the end of 2001, the euro
had recovered only partly against the Swiss
currency and on 5 March was quoted at
CHF 1.48.1Current account deficit declined in 2001
The current account of the euro area
reported a deficit of 9.3 billion in 2001,compared with a deficit of 70.1 billion in2000 (all data refer to the Euro 12). This
decrease in the deficit resulted mainly from a
rise in the goods surplus from 11.7 billionin 2000 to 74.1 billion in 2001, togetherwith a change in the services deficit(5.2 billion) to a surplus (
1.5 billion) overthe same period. This was only partially offset
by the increase of 10.2 billion in the incomedeficit in 2001 (to 
37.7 billion), comparedwith the year before. The deficit for transfers
remained virtually unchanged.Although the volume of both exports andimports of goods declined during the year
(see Box 7 for a detailed discussion) onaccount of lower foreign and euro area
demand, the downturn was more pronouncedfor imports, thereby explaining part ofthe increase in the goods surplus (see
Chart 21). Import prices declined by 9.9%
over the first ten months of 2001, afterincreasing by 20.3% in 2000. This resulted
mainly from the development in oil prices,which rose from 17.1 per barrel in 1999 to31.0 per barrel in 2000 before decreasing
to 27.8 per barrel in 2001.1Developments with regard to the Danish krone, the Swedish
krona and the pound sterling can be found in Chapter III.Box 7Developments in euro area trade volumes since the Asian crisisAfter growing strongly in the first half of 2000, the seasonally adjusted volume of extra-euro area imports ofgoods started to decline in the fourth quarter of 2000, while the volume of extra-euro area exports began to fallin the first quarter of 2001. However, the latter contracted less sharply than the volume of intra-euro area
exports (which are equivalent, apart from a statistical discrepancy, to intra-euro area imports). To analyse theextent of the downturn in external trade in 2000/2001, a comparison is made with trade developments duringthe Asian crisis of 1998. The 2000/2001 downturn seems to have been due to a slowdown in both domestic
and foreign demand, as the volume of both extra-euro area and intra-euro area exports declined, while the
Asian crisis primarily represented an external shock. However, the Asian crisis seems to have resulted inpermanently higher import penetration into the euro area by some Asian countries, while euro area export
volumes to several Asian countries remained below their 1997 levels.56Comparing recent developments in intra-euro area and extra-euro area trade volumes with the Asian crisisThe seasonally adjusted volume of both extra-euro area and intra-euro area imports of goods grew stronglyfrom the beginning of 1997 until mid-2000, while that of extra-euro area exports declined in the second half of
1998 before recovering strongly in 1999. Hence, the latter were strongly influenced by the Asian crisis whileintra-euro area trade and extra-euro area imports remained largely unaffected by the downturn in 1998.In the fourth quarter of 2000, the volume of extra-euro area imports started to decline, while that of extra-euroarea exports began falling slightly later in the first quarter of 2001 (see the chart on extra and intra-euro areaexport and import volumes). One striking feature is that the 2000/2001 downturn in extra-euro area exports is
quite mild in comparison with the Asian crisis, despite the fact that the slowdown in foreign demand wasrelatively sharper during the 2000/2001 downturn (see the chart on extra-euro area export volume, foreigndemand and export share). Although the decline in extra-euro area export volumes during the Asian crisis
seemed to be partly due to the appreciation of the legacy currencies of the euro, the decline in extra-euro areaexports in 2001 took hold despite the relatively low level of the effective exchange rate of the euro and seemedlargely to have been driven by the downturn in global economic activity. Moreover, the euro area™s share ofthe export market increased marginally in 2001.
The 2000/2001 decline in intra-euro area exports is somewhat stronger than the decline in extra-euro areaexports. Indeed, the situation is quite different from the Asian crisis when extra-euro area export volumes felldramatically, while intra-euro area exports continued to grow. Accordingly, the 2000/2001 downturn seemsrelatively more pervasive as it seems to have been due to a slowdown in both euro area and foreign demand,
while the Asian crisis primarily represented an external shock.Developments in extra-euro area trade vis-à-vis partner countries since the Asian crisis
When comparing the evolution of trade volumes in 2000/2001 with that following the Asian crisis, it is worthbreaking down the development of extra-euro area trade into trade with the United States and trade with major
trading partners in Asia (excluding Japan). The chart below shows that the volume of exports from the euroarea to the Asian countries considered here decreased noticeably in the aftermath of the Asian crisis. Not allcountries were affected in the same way, however. While euro area exports to China fell somewhat, but

persistent downturns in domestic demand in the ASEAN countries, while Chinese demand remained morerobust throughout the period. In fact, the volume of euro area exports to China increased by 41% from July1997 to July 2001, while exports to the ASEAN countries declined by 13% over the same period. The chart
below also shows that exports to the United States increased at a very fast pace until January 2001 (almostdoubling since 1997), partly reflecting the strong growth of US GDP in recent years. Given that the UnitedStates is a major export market for the euro area, it seems that exports to the United States have accounted for
a disproportionately large part of euro area export growth since 1997 and, accordingly, explain much of thefall in extra-euro area export volumes in 2001, in line with the downturn in US activity.Comparing the recent evolution of imports with the period after the Asian crisis, the chart below shows thatafter 1997 the volume of imports from many Asian countries increased at a substantially faster pace than therest of extra-euro area imports. In fact, import volumes from China and South Korea increased by more than
100% over that period. For South Korea, this is probably due mainly to competitiveness effects arising fromlower import prices (expressed in euro), which have remained below their 1997 levels despite the depreciationof the euro since its launch. In the case of China, the increase in import volumes is most likely related to a
relatively high level of foreign direct investment.
The aforementioned developments in exports and imports have prompted a change in the relative shares ofAsia and the United States in euro area trade. Between 1996 and 2000, for example, the share of euro areaexports to Asia fell from around 22% to slightly below 19%, while exports to the United States increased theirshare from around 13% to just over 17%. Within the same period, the share of imports from Asia increased
from around 24% to slightly above 27%, with the share of imports from the United States remaining virtuallyunchanged. In summary, it seems that the Asian crisis reinforced the already upward trend in importpenetration of the euro area by countries such as China and South Korea, while euro area export volumes to
several Asian countries remain below their 1997 levels. This has occurred despite the gains in euro area pricecompetitiveness that have resulted from the depreciation of the euro since 1999.

the slowdown in export volumes startedsomewhat earlier for consumption goods thanfor intermediate and capital goods. For
intermediate goods, the decline was far
stronger than for the other two categories(see Chart 22).With regard to the income account,Chart 23 shows that both credits and debits
of income declined in the second part of theyear, mainly as a result of the slowdown
in global activity and the associated fall

in profitability. However, income receipts
decreased 
more rapidly than payments,thereby causing the income deficit to rise in

2001.Combined direct and portfolio investmentnet outflows declined in 2001Combined net outflows in direct andportfolio investment in 2001 (53.0 billion)were lower than in 2000 (
87.6 billion,see Chart 24). This reduction in net outflowsin 2001 resulted mainly from a switch in
portfolio investment from large net outflows

in 2000 (102.8 billion) to net inflows in2001 (40.9 billion), which was onlypartially compensated for by a shift of net
direct investment from net inflows in 2000(15.2 billion) to net outflows in 2001(93.9 billion). Developments in 2001 mustbe seen against the background of a
substantial decrease with respect to 2000 inmerger and acquisition activity, often settled
via distribution of shares, which had resultedin inflows of foreign direct investment and
outflows of portfolio investment. On theChart 22Extra-euro area export volume indices

a substantial rise in net equity inflows,

621Monetary policy implementation
1.1Overview
The operational framework for theimplementation of the single monetary policy
worked efficiently in 2001, further confirmingthe overall positive experience since the startof Monetary Union. Apart from Greece™s

entry into the euro area on 1 January 2001,only very limited changes were made in thecourse of the year. Therefore, the three main
elements of the operational framework Œnamely open market operations, standingfacilities and minimum reserves Œ as well
as the modalities of monetary policyimplementation relying upon thedecentralised execution and administration of
operations by NCBs remained unchanged. Adetailed description of the operationalframework can be found in the document
entitled ﬁThe single monetary policy in StageThree: General documentation on
Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and
proceduresﬂ (December 2000).Among the open market operations, the mainrefinancing operations (MROs) are the mostimportant, playing a pivotal role in steeringliquidity conditions and signalling the stance
of monetary policy. They were conducted asfixed rate tenders from January 1999 to20 June 2000 and after that as variable rate
tenders with a minimum bid rate. The MROsprovide the bulk of the refinancing to thebanking sector. They are regular, liquidity-
providing, reverse transactions, conducted asstandard tenders, with a weekly frequencyand normally a maturity of two weeks.
Moreover, once a month the Eurosystemexecutes longer-term refinancing operations(LTROs) with a three-month maturity. These
operations are aimed at providing longer-
term refinancing to the banking sector. In
addition to the regular open market
operations, the Eurosystem conducted two
fine-tuning reverse operations and twostructural reverse operations in 2001.The two standing facilities offered by theEurosystem, namely the marginal lendingfacility and the deposit facility, aim to provide
and absorb overnight liquidity, signalling thestance of monetary policy and setting anupper and lower limit for the overnight

market interest rate.
Besides offering the standing facilities, theEurosystem requires credit institutions tohold minimum reserves with it equal to 2% ofcertain short-term liabilities. The purpose of

this requirement is the stabilisation of short-term money market interest rates and the
enlargement of the structural liquidity deficit
of the banking system vis-à-vis the
Eurosystem. The stabilisation of moneymarket rates is facilitated by the fact that
reserve requirements must only be fulfilledon average over a one-month reservemaintenance period. This has a significant
smoothing effect on the behaviour of moneymarket interest rates within the reservemaintenance period. It also enables the

Eurosystem, under normal circumstances, to
limit its open market operations to regularMROs and LTROs. As the required reserves
are remunerated at the average marginal rate,over the maintenance period, of theEurosystem™s main refinancing operations,
they do not entail any significant cost to the
banking sector.In its management of the liquidity conditions
in the euro area money market, theEurosystem focuses on the interbank market
for reserves. In this context, reserves areunderstood as being the current accountdeposits that credit institutions in the euro
area hold with the Eurosystem in order tofulfil reserve requirements. The supply of suchreserves is determined by the net effect of
the liquidity provided through monetarypolicy operations and the liquidity withdrawn
by the so-called ﬁautonomous factorsﬂ. The
latter refer to a central bank™s balance sheetitems which do not depend on monetarypolicy operations, such as banknotes in
circulation, government deposits, items in thecourse of settlement and net foreign assets.63

64The level of the autonomous factors rangedfrom 51.1 billion to 142.6 billion in 2001,averaging 94.1 billion (see Chart 25). Theaverage level of the autonomous factors in2001 was 9.0 billion lower than in 2000,implying that the liquidity deficit of the
banking sector vis-à-vis the Eurosystemdecreased by this amount as a result of
these factors. The decreasing trend in the
autonomous factors resulted from the declinein banknotes in circulation ahead of the 2002euro cash changeover. The most volatile
autonomous factor was government depositswith the NCBs. Their volatility (measured bythe standard deviation of the daily changes)

amounted to 4.3 billion, compared with1.1 billion for banknotes in circulation and
1.5 billion for net foreign assets.The Eurosystem™s monetary policy frameworkallows a broad range of counterparties to
participate in monetary policy operations. All
credit institutions subject to minimumreserves may, in principle, access the standing
facilities and participate in open market
operations based on standard tenders.However, in addition to the general eligibility
criteria, counterparties must also fulfil alloperational criteria specified in thecontractual or regulatory arrangements
applied by the Eurosystem to ensure the
efficient conduct of monetary policy
operations. As a consequence,  3,409 of the

7,219 euro area credit institutions subject to
minimum reserves at the end of December2001 had access to the deposit facility, and
3,065 to the marginal lending facility. 2,454credit institutions could participate in openmarket operations based on standard tenders.
There is a select group currently consisting
of 141 credit institutions eligible for fine-tuning operations. Compared with the
situation prevailing at the end of 2000, the
total number of credit institutions subject tominimum reserves decreased by 302, mainly

owing to consolidation in the banking
industry.1.2The main refinancing operations
In 2001 the Eurosystem conducted 52 MROs.Of all the liquidity provided through regular
open market operations, 73% was suppliedby MROs. The MROs were conducted as

variable rate tenders with a minimum bidrate according to the multiple rate(ﬁAmericanﬂ) auction procedure. According
to this procedure, bids above the marginalallotment rate (the lowest accepted bid) aresatisfied in full and at the interest rate offered,

while bids at the marginal rate are allottedpro rata. The allotment volumes variedbetween 5 billion and 172 billion, withthe average amounting to 79 billion. Thebid cover ratio, which expresses how many
times the total bid amount exceeds the total
allotment amount, ranged between 1.0 and16.7, averaging 1.9.As a result of the multiple rate auctionprocedure, the allotment rates (i.e. themarginal rate and the weighted average rate)

can be higher than the minimum bid rate.The average spread between the marginal rateand the minimum bid rate in the MROs was
2.3 basis points in 2001, while the averagespread between the weighted average rateand the marginal rate amounted to 1.4 basis
points. The narrowness of the latter spreadindicates that counterparties were generallyquite capable of anticipating the marginal rates
of the MROs and that the dispersion of thebid rates among counterparties was generallylimited. A comparison of the bidding in MROs
in 2001 with that in the second half of2000 reveals the impact of interest rateexpectations on the allotment rates. In 2000,

rate hike expectations prevailed, meaning thatmoney market rates Œ and hence bid ratesand allotment rates Œ tended to be
considerably above the minimum bid rate. In2001, rate cut expectations dominated, so
that market rates tended to be close to,

or even below, the minimum bid rate (see
Chart 26). This had the result that bid rateswere normally submitted close to the
minimum bid rate, which often turned out tobe the same as the marginal rate in these
cases.65
The dominance of rate cut expectations in2001 contributed to the decline in the average
number of counterparties participating in
Eurosystem MROs during the year (see
Chart 26). When compared with the second
half of 2000, this average number declined by36% to 410. During 2001, the number of
counterparties participating in the MROs
ranged from 201 to 658. Other factorsexplaining this downward trend inparticipation in MROs include the
consolidation in the euro area bankingindustry, the increased concentration oftreasury management activities within banking
groups and greater efficiency in the interbankmarket which tends to reduce the need toobtain refinancing from the central bank

directly.In addition to causing a decline in theallotment rates and the number of bidders,strong rate cut expectations can result inunderbidding, which occurred in the MROs
conducted on 13 February, 10 April,
9 October and 6 November. In these MROsthe aggregate bid amount submitted byChart 26Number of bidders and the spread between the two-week EONIA swap rate and theminimum bid rate(weekly data)counterparties fell short of the actual liquidityneeds of the banking system, exerting strong
upward pressure on the overnight rate. In allfour cases, the ECB provided large amountsof liquidity in the following MRO, although it

could not always fully restore neutral liquidityconditions since it also had to takeinto account the liquidity supply in the
subsequent maintenance period. The tightliquidity conditions and high interbankovernight rates resulting from the
underbidding improved the understanding inthe money market that the bankingcommunity cannot use underbidding as
a profit-making strategy.The switch to the variable rate tenderprocedure in June 2000 was accompanied by
the decision to start publishing an estimate ofthe aggregate liquidity needs of the banking
system in order to facilitate the preparationof bids by counterparties. The liquidity needsof the banking system are related to two
items: first, the reserve requirements; andsecond, the autonomous factors. Of thesetwo components, the reserve requirementsnumber of bidders (left-hand scale)spread in basis points between the two-week EONIA swap rate and the minimum bid rate (right-hand scale)0100200300400500600700-15-10-50

numberbasis points
66are generally known with a high degree of
accuracy, while the estimate of the autonomous
factors is less certain. In 2001 the average
absolute forecasting error (i.e. the absolutedifference between the estimated value of the
autonomous factors published once a week and
the corresponding outcome) was 1.9 billion.The standard deviation of the differencebetween the estimated and the actual values
was 2.7 billion.1.3The longer-term refinancing
operationsIn addition to the MROs, the Eurosystemalso conducts LTROs, which are liquidity-
providing reverse transactions with a monthly
frequency and a maturity of three months.On average over the year, LTROs provided
about 27% of the total refinancing through
regular open market operations. In contrastto MROs, the LTROs are not, as a rule,conducted with the intention of steering the
liquidity situation or signalling the monetarypolicy stance. In order for the Eurosystem toact as a rate-taker, LTROs have been

conducted in the form of variable rate tenders
with the multiple rate (ﬁAmericanﬂ) auctionprocedure, pre-announced allotment volumes
and no minimum bid rate. All the LTROs
conducted in 2001 had a pre-announcedallotment volume of 20 billion, meaning that60 billion of lending to the banking systemwas permanently outstanding via this type ofopen market operation.1 On average, 225
counterparties participated in the LTROs in2001, with the actual numbers ranging from195 to 268. Compared with 2000, the
participation rate declined by 17%, mainly for
the same reasons as those mentionedpreviously for the MROs.In the LTROs, the dispersion of bids was
generally higher than in the MROs, mainly
because of the absence of a minimum bidrate. On average over the year, the weightedaverage rate exceeded the marginal rate by
2.7 basis points, compared with 2.2 basis
points in 2000. The bid cover ratio averaged2.0, as opposed to 2.8 in the previous year.1.4Other open market operations
In 2001 the Eurosystem undertook two
fine-tuning operations and two structuraloperations. Both fine-tuning operations werecarried out to facilitate the normal functioning
of markets and to provide liquidity afterthe terrorist attacks in the United States on11 September (see Box 8).On 27 April and 27 November, in parallelwith the respective MROs, the Eurosystem
carried out one-week structural reverse
operations. These operations, also called
ﬁsplit tendersﬂ, enabled the ECB to restore

similar sizes to the two outstanding MROs.
2On both occasions, the sizes of the two
outstanding MROs had diverged strongly
on account of previous underbidding.The additional operations were alsospecified as standard tenders, albeit with a
shorter maturity, and implemented asvariable rate tenders with the same minimumbid rate as in the MRO conducted in
parallel. On 27 April, the ECB allotted80 billion in the MRO and 73 billion inthe one-week structural operation, both
at the same marginal rate. On 27 November,
the ECB allotted 71 billion in the
MRO and 53 billion in the one-weekstructural operation, with the marginalrate for the latter 1 basis point higher than inthe regular MRO.1.5Standing facilities
The width of the interest rate corridordetermined by the two standing facilities
remained unchanged at 200 basis points in2001. The minimum bid rate of the MROsremained in the middle of this corridor.1Owing to a technical problem in the submission of bids,
the amount allotted had to be reduced to 19.1 billion on
28 March 2001.2In future cases, such ﬁsplit tendersﬂ will also be formally classified
as MROs, implying that their marginal rate will be included in

the calculation of the remuneration of holdings of required
reserves.67
Over the year, the daily recourse to the
marginal lending facility and the deposit facilityamounted, on average, to 0.7 billion and0.4 billion respectively. While the averageuse of the deposit facility declined by 21%relative to 2000, the average use of the
marginal lending facility increased by 97%,mainly as a consequence of the underbiddingepisodes (see Chart 25). Normally, recourse
to the standing facilities is relatively lowduring most of the maintenance period, as
can be seen from Chart 25. Counterparties
generally use the deposit facility only afterthey have fulfilled their reserve requirementswhich Œ for most credit institutions Œ occurs
only in the last days of the maintenanceperiod. Accordingly, the use of the depositfacility over the last three business days of
the maintenance periods was on averageseven times higher than on other maintenanceperiod days in 2001. The same also applies,
albeit to a lesser extent, to the use of themarginal lending facility, with the average useover the last three business days being
5 times higher than on other days of themaintenance periods. The total number ofcredit institutions which had access to
the deposit facility declined by 190. The
corresponding number for the marginallending facility increased by 6.
1.6The minimum reserve system
The average level of reserve requirementsheld by credit institutions in the euro area
amounted to 124 billion in 2001. This was12.2 billion higher than in 2000, increasingthe overall structural liquidity deficit of the
banking sector vis-à-vis the Eurosystem bythis amount. The level of the aggregate
reserve requirements varied between
119.1 billion (during the maintenance periodending on 23 January) and 127.2 billion(during the maintenance period ending on
23 August). The average monthly reserve basesubject to the 2% reserve ratio increasedby 10% relative to 2000.Of the 7,219 credit institutions subject tominimum reserves in December 2001, 4,649fulfilled their requirements directly, whileothers fulfilled them indirectly through anintermediary. The current account holdings
of banks fluctuated between 91.6 billion and186.9 billion in the course of the year,indicating that a substantial buffer against
unexpected liquidity withdrawals was alwaysavailable (see Chart 25). Indeed, the volatilityof the EONIA (euro overnight index average)
remained subdued in 2001. The standarddeviation of its daily changes was only15 basis points, which is rather small by
international standards, despite the very lowfrequency of fine-tuning operations. In 2000,the standard deviation of the EONIA was
14 basis points. Consequently, the two mainfunctions of the minimum reserve system,namely the stabilisation of money market

interest rates and the enlargement of thestructural liquidity deficit of the bankingsector, were once again successfully fulfilled.
As a consequence of the smooth functioningof the minimum reserve system, no changes
were made to its main features. Only two
new elements were introduced to the systemin 2001. First, on 1 March 2001, the ECB
issued a Recommendation for a Council
Regulation (EC) to extend from 15 days totwo months the time limit granted to the
Governing Council of the ECB for decidingon objections raised by credit institutions tosanctions imposed for breaches of minimum
reserve limits. This amendment becamebinding when the Regulation to amendCouncil Regulation 2531/98 concerning the
application of minimum reserves by the ECB,entered into force on 26 January 2002.Second, 10 May 2001 saw the adoption of
Regulation ECB/2001/4 amending RegulationECB/1999/4 of 23 September 1999 on thepowers of the European Central Bank to
impose sanctions. This binding legal actestablished the NCBs™ and ECB™s obligationto retain original documents on non-

compliance cases for at least five years.The introduction of the euro in Greece on1 January 2001 implied some adjustments forthe Eurosystem™s first reserve maintenanceperiod in 2001, since it started in Greece

68only on 1 January 2001, while in the otherparticipating Member States it started as usual
on 24 December 2000. As a result, the
accession of Greece to the euro areaincreased the aggregate reserve requirementof the Eurosystem from 1 January 2001 by
2.1 billion. All in all, 57 Greek creditinstitutions became subject to Eurosystem
minimum reserves.During 2001, 70 cases of non-compliance with
reserve requirements were observed on
average per reserve maintenance period,corresponding to an average daily shortfall of1.2 million. A large proportion of these
non-compliance cases were only for negligibleamounts, meaning that no penalty wasimposed. However, there were also several

rather large infringements and 25 ofthem led to fines in excess of 10,000.Most of the non-compliant credit institutions
acknowledged the errors, while 14
institutions raised objections that required adecision by the Executive Board of the
ECB. One credit institution requested areview of the decision of the Executive Boardby the Governing Council.1.7Eligible assets
The Statute of the ESCB requires that all theEurosystem™s credit operations be covered
by adequate collateral. The collateralframework of the Eurosystem is designed to
protect the Eurosystem against incurring

losses in its monetary policy and paymentsystem operations (see Chapter III on riskcontrol measures), to ensure the equal
treatment of counterparties and to enhanceoperational efficiency. Common eligibilitycriteria for collateral accepted for credit
operations conducted by the Eurosystem areapplied. At the same time, due regard is givento differences in central bank practices and

financial structures across the euro area andto the need for the Eurosystem to ensuresufficient availability of adequate collateral
for its credit operations. According to
Article 102 of the Treaty establishing theEuropean Community, privileged access bypublic institutions to financial institutions isprohibited; there should therefore beno discrimination within the collateral
framework on the grounds of the public orprivate nature of the issuers.In order to take account of existing
differences in the financial structure of
participating Member States, assets eligible
for credit operations include a large numberof different instruments. A distinction is madebetween two categories of assets eligible for
the credit operations of the Eurosystem.These two categories are referred to as ﬁtieroneﬂ and ﬁtier twoﬂ respectively. This
distinction has no bearing on their eligibilityfor the various types of Eurosystem monetary
policy operations, except that tier two assets
are not normally expected to be used by theEurosystem in outright transactions. Tier one
consists of marketable debt instruments
fulfilling uniform eligibility criteria specified
by the ECB. Tier two consists of assets which
are of particular importance for national
financial markets and banking systems and forwhich eligibility criteria are established bythe NCBs, subject to minimum eligibility
criteria established by the ECB. Tier twoassets may be marketable or non-marketabledebt instruments or they may be equities.Eurosystem counterparties may use eligibleassets on a cross-border basis, i.e. they can

obtain funds from the NCB of the MemberState in which they are established by makinguse of assets located in another Member
State. To enable the cross-border use ofcollateral in all types of Eurosystem liquidity-
providing operations, the correspondent
central banking model (CCBM), as well asﬁlinksﬂ between securities settlement systems(SSSs) that have been positively assessed
against the standards of the Eurosystem, are
available. The CCBM can be used for all
eligible assets, as specific solutions are
provided for non-marketable assets or tiertwo assets with restricted liquidity and specialfeatures that cannot be transferred through
an SSS (see Chapter VII).69
Between January and December 2001 thetotal amount of marketable assets eligible ascollateral for Eurosystem credit operations
increased by 5% from approximately6.3 trillion to 6.6 trillion. A very large
proportion, i.e. 95%, of marketable assets were
tier one assets, while the remaining 5% were
tier two assets. In addition to marketable assets,tier two assets consist of non-marketable debt

instruments, including bank loans, trade bills
and mortgage-backed promissory notes.3Although tier one assets are the main source ofcollateral for monetary policy operations, some
credit institutions rely to a large extent on tier
two collateral.While a large amount of securities arepotentially available to counterparties for

Eurosystem credit operations, the actualamount of assets held by credit institutions isonly part of the total amount of eligible assets,
since assets are also held by other economicagents. According to a rough estimate by the
Eurosystem at the beginning of 2001, about

one-third (i.e. approximately 2.1 trillion) ofall eligible collateral was held by creditinstitutions in the euro area. The actual
amount of collateral held by counterpartiesis a function of their balance sheet structure,which, in turn, is related to the financial
structure of the individual euro areacountries. The differences in availablecollateral among counterparties also reflect
differences in the level of sophisticationreached by financial markets in the individualeuro area countries, such as the degree ofType of assetTier one (European Economic Area)Tier two (euro area)

Table 10Main categories of eligible assets for Eurosystem credit operationsdevelopment of private sector securitiesmarkets and of the legal frameworks forsecuritisation. The initial differences in
availability appear to be diminishing, partlyowing to increased private issuance of debtsecurities in the euro area markets, spurred
by the introduction of the euro and thesignificant growth in the cross-border use ofcollateral.The collateral eligible for Eurosystem creditoperations encompasses a very broad
spectrum of high-quality assets denominatedin euro, issued (or guaranteed) by entitiesestablished in the European Economic Area

for tier one assets, or in the euro area fortier two assets (see Table 10). A substantial
part of tier one (which comprises debt
instruments only) is made up of generalgovernment bonds, i.e. assets issued bycentral, regional and local governments.
Securities issued by central governmentstypically have a high outstanding amount, largeissue size and turnover and low trading
spreads. They are quantitatively the mostabundant source of eligible collateral inalmost all euro area countries. Regional and
local government securities in differentcountries display differing degrees of liquidity,but are in general less liquid than central
government bonds. Other types of assetsin tier one include securities issued byinternational and supranational institutions.3The amount of eligible non-marketable tier two assets is not
available.
70Private sector securities in tier one includeasset-backed securities, uncovered creditinstitution bonds and bonds issued by
corporations. Many asset-backed bonds aresecurities backed by residential mortgagesor by public sector debt. Unlike other
asset-backed securities, these are issueddirectly by specialised credit institutionsrather than through special purpose vehicles4.Assets similar to ﬁPfandbriefeﬂ, whichoriginated in German and Austrian markets,have also been introduced or have
experienced issuance growth in recentyears in other euro area countries(for example, ﬁobligations foncièresﬂ in
France and ﬁcédulas hipotecariasﬂ in Spain).Outstanding amounts of uncovered creditinstitution bonds are large in some euro areacountries, but turnover is generally lowcompared with government bonds or certain
Pfandbrief-type products (such as the so-called ﬁJumboﬂ issues). For corporate bonds,the issue size is normally smaller than for
other types of issuer in many euro areacountries and the available data show thatturnover is substantially lower than for
government bonds. Corporate bond marketshave experienced substantial growth inissuance in the wake of the introduction of
the euro.Tier two assets include credit institution orcorporate bonds, commercial paper, medium-term notes, regional government bonds,bank loans, trade bills, mortgage-backed
promissory notes and equities. Except for
this last category, the liquidity is generallylower and the market depth shallower for
tier two assets than for tier one assets. Manyof these tier two assets are not listed ortraded on a regulated market, but are traded
over the counter.The management and publication of thecomplete list of assets eligible for Eurosystemcredit operations are handled centrally at the
ECB, where an Eligible Assets Database is
kept. The NCBs submit information to the
ECB on assets issued in their respectivenational markets. Data are collected weekly
4A special purpose vehicle is a legal entity set up to acquire and
hold certain assets on its balance sheet and to issue securities
backed by those assets, to be sold to third parties.and are made accessible to all interested
parties by the ECB on its website(www.ecb.int). The solution of publishing the
list of eligible assets on the internet has
proved to be efficient. Preparations arecurrently under way to improve the efficiency
of the updating procedure and to increasethe frequency of the present weekly update.1.8Money market activity
The introduction of the euro led to thecreation of a large, liquid and integratedmoney market across the euro area. This
holds true for most of the different moneymarket segments, although the signs ofintegration have been particularly evident in
the unsecured lending and swap segments.Progress towards integration is alsoevidenced across a number of financial

centres by a centralisation of euro areatreasury management activities within banks.The cross-border activity within the euro
area is strong and these transactions arewidely considered as quasi-domestic. Thereis also an increasing concentration of

intermediation activity within a relativelysmall number of major institutions, whichhave become less domestically oriented and
whose activity has spread across the euroarea.Although less integrated, the euro repo
market showed improvements, as evidencedby a significant growth of cross-border
transactions in this segment. As part of theefforts to promote a more integrated repomarket, market participants have been
involved in a project conducted under theaegis of the European Banking Federation andthe European Repo Council for the
establishment of a representative benchmark
for the euro ﬁgeneral collateralﬂ repo market(Eurepo reference rates). This benchmark
became operational in March 2002.71
As regards the market for short-termsecurities (e.g. Treasury bills, commercialpaper and certificates of deposit), the
development remains limited compared withthat prevailing in other money marketsegments. This market is still fragmented, as
transactions remain essentially domesticallyoriented. However, a general trend towardsan increased emphasis on market-based
financing has sustained the dynamic growthof commercial paper issuance.Activities involving euro-denominated moneymarket derivatives, such as interest rateswaps and futures, continued to recordsignificant increases during 2001. The Bankfor International Settlements™ Triennial
Central Bank Survey, conducted in April 2001,
concluded that 47% of the global dailyturnover in over-the-counter interest ratederivatives took place in euro. The liquidity
of the interest rate swap market has beenenhanced, inter alia, by the systematic use of
this market segment for hedging and position-
taking purposes. The EONIA continues toshow an increasing importance as an indexfor the overnight-interest-swap (OIS) market.
For very short-term maturities, the swap
market is now almost exclusively based on
this reference rate.2Foreign exchange operations and investment of foreign reserve
assetsThe Eurosystem is responsible for holding
and managing the foreign reserve assets ofthe participating EU Member States.2.1Foreign exchange operations
In 2001 the ECB did not conduct anyintervention in the foreign exchange marketon its own initiative. However, on 24, 26 and
27 September, the ECB and selected NCBsconducted operations in the foreign exchangemarket on behalf of the Bank of Japan under
the agency agreement between thatinstitution and the ECB. In addition, following
the terrorist attacks in the United States,
the US Federal Reserve and the ECB agreedon a swap arrangement on 12 September,
which was used on 12, 13 and 14 September

(see Box 8).On 15 November 2000, the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) approved the ECB™sapplication to become a prescribed holder ofspecial drawing rights (SDRs), thereby
enabling the ECB to participate in voluntarytransactions with IMF member countries andother prescribed SDR holders. A standing
arrangement between the ECB and the IMFwas signed in April 2001 to facilitate theinitiation of SDR transactions by the IMF onbehalf of the ECB with other SDR holders(see Chapter V). This arrangement was
activated on one occasion in 2001.
2.2The foreign reserve assets of the
EurosystemAt the end of 2001, the ECB™s net foreignreserve assets amounted to 46.8 billion
compared with 43.5 billion at the end of2000. This change reflects the impact of threeelements: the transfer of foreign reserve
assets by the Bank of Greece to the ECBupon joining the euro area at the beginningof the year, the interest income earned on
the ECB™s foreign reserves and the change in
the market value of these foreign reserveassets. The possibility exists for the ECB to
make further calls on the NCBs™ foreignreserve assets under the conditions definedin secondary European Community legislation
(i.e. Council Regulation (EC) 1010/2000 of8 May 2000 concerning further calls of foreign
reserve assets by the European Central Bank).The Governing Council has defined thecurrency distribution of the ECB™s foreign
reserves, which consist of gold, US dollars
and Japanese yen, on the basis of optimalcurrency allocation studies and prospective

72Box 8Central bank operations in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on 11 September2001The terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 had far-reaching implications for financialmarkets, leading the world™s major central banks to act to support the normal functioning of these markets. Onthe day of the attacks, the Eurosystem announced its readiness to support the normal functioning of the
markets and provide liquidity, if necessary.In line with its announcement, the Eurosystem conducted two liquidity-providing fine-tuning operations in
order to smooth developments in the euro money market. These were carried out as reverse operations underquick tender procedures, with same-day settlement and one-day maturity. A fixed rate of 4.25% which
coincided with the then prevailing minimum bid rate of the main refinancing operations was applied in bothoperations. In the first operation, bids amounted to 69.3 billion, with 63 counterparties participating. In thesecond, 45 counterparties submitted bids totalling 40.5 billion. The ECB satisfied all bids in both operations.In addition to providing euro liquidity, the Eurosystem helped euro area banks to meet urgent US dollarliquidity needs which resulted from settlement problems with some US correspondent banks and the reluctance

of US banks to lend dollars before arranging their own liquidity needs, the latter only taking place after the endof the European trading session. In order to provide the required dollar liquidity, the US Federal Reserve andthe ECB agreed on a swap arrangement on 12 September. Under the agreement, the ECB was eligible to draw
up to USD 50 billion on a swap line, receiving dollar deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Inexchange, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would receive euro deposits of an equivalent amount at theECB. The swap line expired on 13 October.The ECB drew on the swap facility on 12, 13 and 14 September. The first amount drawn on 12 Septembertotalled USD 5.4 billion and matured on 17 September. The swap line was again drawn upon on the following
two days for overnight swaps totalling USD 14.1 billion on 13 September and USD 3.9 billion on14 September. The dollar deposits were made available to NCBs of the Eurosystem and were used by the latterto help meet the dollar liquidity needs of euro area banks.Against the background of increased uncertainty about the US and world economies following the terroristattacks, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered the federal funds rate on 17 September. In concert with
this decision, and taking into account the likelihood that the events in the United States would weigh on
confidence in the euro area, the Governing Council of the ECB, also on 17 September, reduced the minimumbid rate on the Eurosystem™s main refinancing operations by 50 basis points to 3.75%. Similarly, a number of
other central banks lowered their key interest rates on 17 and 18 September (for an overview of all monetarypolicy decisions taken in 2001, see Chapter I).In the field of foreign exchange, the immediate dollar depreciation ensuing from the terrorist attacks exertedintense and undesirable upward pressure on the Japanese yen. Within the context of the agency agreementbetween the ECB and the Bank of Japan, the ECB (and selected euro area NCBs acting on behalf of the ECB)
bought euro against yen on 24, 26 and 27 September for the Bank of Japan.operational needs, and may change it if andwhen it deems appropriate. In order to avoidany interference with the monetary policy of

the ECB, there is no active trading of theforeign reserve currencies for investmentpurposes. Regarding gold assets, the ECB hasnot entered into any type of management, in
line with the Central Bank Gold Agreementof 26 September 1999. Each of the
Eurosystem central banks is a party to this
agreement, which stipulates that thesignatories will not increase their activity in73
gold lending and gold futures and optionmarkets.The NCBs manage the ECB™s foreign reservesin accordance with ECB guidelines andinstructions. In addition, they manage their
own foreign reserves as they see fit. Theiroperations in foreign currencies are subject,above certain limits, to ECB notification or

approval, in order to ensure consistency withthe monetary policy of the ECB.As regards both the ECB™s and the NCBs™
foreign reserves, data on internationalreserves and foreign currency liquidity are
published monthly on the ECB™s website(www.ecb.int), with a one-month lag, in linewith the IMF™s Special Data Dissemination

Standard. This publication complements theinformation provided by the consolidatedweekly financial statement of the Eurosystem.2.3Developments in the Eurosystem™s
approach to foreign reserve
managementThe aim behind the management of the ECB™s
foreign reserves is to ensure that, at anygiven point in time, the ECB has an adequate

amount of liquid resources at its disposal forany foreign exchange intervention, if andwhen the Governing Council decides that this
is necessary. Liquidity and security are
therefore the basic requirements for theinvestment of the ECB™s foreign reserves.
Subject to these constraints, the ECB™sforeign reserves are managed in such a way
as to maximise their value.
The ECB™s foreign reserves are managed in adecentralised manner by the euro area NCBs
on the basis of investment guidelines, astrategic benchmark approved by theGoverning Council of the ECB and a tactical

benchmark determined by the ExecutiveBoard of the ECB. In addition to the currencydistribution, the ECB defines four keyparameters for the investment of its foreignreserves: first, a two-level investment

benchmark (i.e. a strategic benchmark and atactical benchmark) for each currency;second, permitted deviations from these
benchmarks in terms of the interest rate risk;
third, a list of eligible instruments andoperations; and, fourth, limits for credit risk
exposures (see Chapter III). NCBs then usethe leeway given to them by the deviationbands and risk limits to maximise the return
on their portfolios relative to the benchmark,
subject to continuous monitoring by the ECB.When conducting the ECB™s investment
activity, NCBs act on behalf of the ECB on adisclosed agency basis, so that the ECB™s
counterparties can distinguish the operations
carried out by the NCBs on behalf of the
ECB from those carried out by the NCBs fortheir own account.Since its launch, this framework hasfunctioned satisfactorily, and work is
continuously undertaken with a view toenhancing portfolio and risk management
techniques.  In line with the gradual extension

of the range of investment instruments andto improve the efficiency with which positions
are taken, the use of money market and bond
futures for managing the foreign exchangereserves is scheduled for the first quarter of2002. In addition, the ECB has further
diversified its fixed income investmentstowards high quality non-sovereign issuerswith the aim of improving the risk/return
profile of the portfolios.Finally, the ongoing development of the riskmanagement framework (see Chapter III), andchanges to the IT system (with the introductionof a new version of the portfolio management

system) and to the legal documentation
(with, inter alia, the introduction of theEuropean Master Agreement), contributed

to an enhancement of the overall managementof the ECB™s foreign reserves.

743The ECB™s own funds management
The principal purpose of the ECB™s capital isto act as a reserve fund, providing it with
sufficient income while maintaining anappropriate level of security. The ECB
was endowed with an initial capital of
approximately 4,000 million. In 2001 therewere two notable additions to the ECB™s own
funds. First, Greece contributed its share tothe ECB™s capital upon joining the euro areaat the beginning of the year and second, a
proportion of the ECB™s total operating profitfor 2000 was transferred to the generalreserve fund.The decision-making bodies of the ECBdetermine four key parameters for the
investment of its own funds in the Europeanbond markets: first, a strategic investmentbenchmark; second, a permitted deviation
from this benchmark in terms of the interestrate risk; third, a list of eligible instrumentsand operations; and, fourth, limits for credit
risk exposures. The ECB then uses the scopeprovided by the deviation bands and risklimits to maximise the return on the own
funds portfolio.In view of the purpose of the ECB™s ownfunds and the key parameters outlined above,the own funds are mainly invested in euroarea government bonds and some other

highly rated collateralised bonds. Certaineuro area bond derivatives and directsecurities lending transactions have also been
eligible instruments since 1999. As part of
the gradual extension of the range ofpermissible investment instruments, anautomatic securities lending programme for
own funds was implemented in February
2001.There is also a list of eligible counterpartiesfor the investment of the ECB™s own funds.This list, while prepared separately fromthose corresponding to the management of
the ECB™s foreign reserve assets, meets the
same criteria concerning prudence andefficiency. The relevant legal documentation
including the recently introduced EuropeanMaster Agreement corresponds to that usedin connection with the management of the
foreign reserves.Since the ECB™s own funds are currentlyinvested exclusively in euro-denominatedassets, it is of the utmost importance that
any interference with the ECB™s monetary
policy decisions be prevented. In order toprevent the misuse of privileged informationin the management of the ECB™s own funds

and to protect the ECB™s reputation, a
ﬁChinese wallﬂ is in place, i.e. a strictfunctional and physical separation between
the unit managing the own funds and theother units of the ECB. In addition, the ECBmanages its own funds on a relatively passive
basis, especially in the money market, in orderto avoid generating any signals which could
be misconstrued as being monetary policy-
related.75
Chapter IIIRisk management
78The risk management function of the ECB manages and monitors financial risks incurred bythe ECB directly or by the 12 NCBs of the Eurosystem on behalf of the ECB. Risk management
at the ECB has two main areas, namely policy operations and investment operations. The
former focuses on the risk issues associated with the Eurosystem
™s monetary policy operations,including payment system operations (principally through the provision of intraday liquidityvia the TARGET system). The latter focuses on foreign reserve assets and the management of
the ECB™s own capital.1Policy operations
In the conduct of its monetary policy andpayment system credit operations, the
Eurosystem incurs a risk when entering intoa transaction with a counterparty that may
be unable to meet its credit obligations.This credit risk is mitigated by the useof collateral. The use of adequate collateral.
The use of adequate collateral is
required in all Eurosystem credit operations
by Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB.
To protect the Eurosystem from incurringlosses as well as to ensure the equal
treatment of counterparties and enhanceoperational efficiency, assets have to fulfil
certain common criteria in order to be
eligible as collateral for Eurosystem creditoperations. The criteria are laid down in the
collateral framework.Owing to the differences in financial structure
across Member States and for purposes
internal to the Eurosystem, a distinction ismade between two categories of assetseligible for Eurosystem credit operations.
These two categories are referred to asﬁtier oneﬂ and 
ﬁtier twoﬂ. Tier one consistsof marketable debt instruments which fulfil
uniform euro area-wide eligibility criteriaspecified by the ECB. Tier two consists
of additional assets (marketable and non-
marketable) which are of particularimportance to national financial markets andbanking systems.. The eligibility criteria
applied to these assets by the respectiveNCBs are subject to approval by the ECB.
No distinction is made between the two tiers
with regard to the quality of the assets ortheir eligibility for the various types ofEurosystem credit operations, except that
tier two assets are not normally used by the
Eurosystem in outright transactions.
1.1Risk control framework
Tier one and tier two assets are both subjectto risk control measures. These are appliedto the assets underlying Eurosystem
credit operations in order to protect theEurosystem against the risk of financial loss ifunderlying assets have to be realised owing

to the default of a counterparty. Thismeans that the Eurosystem uses the collateralto recover the liquidity provided. It is in
such a situation that it incurs marketand liquidity risks associated with thecollateral. The risk control measures at

the disposal of the Eurosystem in 2001were initial margins, valuation haircuts,variation margins, limits in relation to issuers/
debtors or guarantors, and additionalguarantees.Risk controlsTo obtain an adequate level of risk control,the Eurosystem evaluates in line with bestmarket practices parameters such as current
and potential price developments and relatedprice volatilities. Value at Risk (VaR) measuresare used to estimate the valuation haircuts

needed to reflect the maximum loss ofmarket value which, assuming historicalconditions, could be generated by the
collateral with a given level of statisticalconfidence over a given period of time.79
Additional measures used to calibrate thevaluation haircuts include back testing andstress testing.In addition to the initial margins applied tothe credit amount, the Eurosystem applies
the valuation haircuts according to asset type,residual maturity and coupon structure. Thehaircuts are applied by deducting a certain
percentage from the market value of the
asset. Three haircut groups were used in 2001for tier one assets: fixed rate, floating rate

and inverse floating rate instruments.The valuation haircuts applied to tier two
assets reflect the specific risks associated withthese assets and are at least as stringent as
the haircuts applied to tier one assets.
Initial margins and margin calls are applied totier two assets in a similar fashion as to tier
one assets. Four different haircut groups were
used in 2001 for tier two assets, reflectingdifferences in their intrinsic characteristics
and liquidity: equities, marketable debt
instruments with limited liquidity, debtinstruments with restricted liquidity andspecial features, and non-marketable debt
instruments.The assets are subject to a daily valuationand NCBs calculate on a daily basis therequired value of underlying assets taking intoaccount the valuation principles outlined by
the Eurosystem. Symmetric margin calls aremade whenever the underlying assets donot match the collateral requirements.
Margin calls can be met either by supplyingadditional assets or by means of cashpayments.Valuation principlesA set of principles is employed to determinethe value of underlying assets in Eurosystem
credit operations. For marketable tier one ortier two assets, the Eurosystem specifies asingle reference market to be used as the

price source, following a marked-to-marketapproach. It defines the most representativeprice on the reference market, which is then
used for the calculation of market values. If
more than one price is quoted, the lowest ofthese prices (normally the bid price) is used.For non-marketable tier two assets or for
those marketable assets that do not normallytrade, so that mark to market is not possible,the Eurosystem generally applies a mark-to-
model strategy based on present-valuediscounting of future cash flows. Thediscounting is based on an appropriate
zero-coupon curve, and differences in creditrisk between issuers are explicitly taken intoaccount through credit spreads. The level of
the applicable credit spread strongly dependson national market characteristics and istherefore proposed by the NCB after
analysing the available market data. The creditspreads are ultimately subject to approval bythe ECB.1.2Credit risk assessment
Assets used as collateral in Eurosystem creditoperations must meet high credit standards.
In the assessment of the standard of debtinstruments, the ECB takes into account, inter
alia, available market agency ratings and the
NCBs™ own credit assessment systems, as
well as certain institutional criteria which
would ensure particularly high protection
of the holders, including guarantees. TheEurosystem does not accept as underlyingassets debt instruments issued or guaranteed
by the counterparty, or by any other entitywith which the counterparty has close links.The credit quality of the eligible assets isconstantly monitored to check that it isequivalent to at least the minimum level
of financial soundness specified by
the Eurosystem. The ECB monitors the
assessment provided by NCBs™ credit
assessment systems and from time to time bynational rating companies which rate nationaltier two assets.
802Investment operations
At the end of 2001, the ECB had a reserveportfolio totalling 46.8 billion, whichcomprised foreign currency reserves, gold
and special drawing rights (SDRs).The foreign currency reserves aredenominated in US dollars and Japanese yen

and are managed on behalf of the ECB by theNCBs. This reserve portfolio is first and
foremost an intervention portfolio.In addition to the actively managedinvestments, the ECB also holds gold.The ECB™s own capital is denominated in euroand managed by a separate portfolio
management team at the ECB. These
investments, known as the ECB™s ﬁownfundsﬂ, are designated for generating a returnto fund the running costs of the ECB.The ECB™s financial health and reputation aredependent on the appropriate managementof the investment portfolio. A key componentin the management of these investments is
the correct risk management structure.The risk management frameworkThe framework for managing the risksassociated with the ECB
™s investmentportfolio has three closely interlinkedcomponents:the establishment of an analytical
framework to determine the appropriate
asset allocation for the foreign currencyreserves and the investment reserves. Inconcrete terms, this specifies the currency
distribution of the reserve portfolios and
the strategic benchmarks for each
portfolio;the analysis of investment performance;the establishment of appropriate risk
management and compliance measures.Asset allocationThis process determines the optimal currencydistribution for the foreign currency reserves
and the optimal asset allocation for eachcurrency portfolio.In assessing the currency distribution, the two
major considerations are liquidity and
diversification. The actual asset allocation for
each portfolio results in the establishment ofthe strategic investment benchmarks for eachportfolio.The strategic benchmarks are designed toindicate and implement the long term risk-
return preferences of the ECB. They giveportfolio managers in the Eurosystem clearindications of the levels of market, credit and
liquidity risk that the ECB desires. Thebenchmarks are crucial to the performanceof the ECB as they are the main determinants
of the returns earned.The goal of asset allocation is to achievemaximum returns under the constraintswithin which the ECB operates. The strategicbenchmarks are reviewed on an annual basis.
For the 2001 review, new methodologieswere developed for estimating expectedreturns for each asset class and these
scenarios of expected returns were
incorporated into the various optimisationexercises conducted prior to the benchmark
construction. In addition, the yield curve
for each asset class was stress-testedto assess the resilience of possible future
asset allocations to external shocks.This approach to asset allocation is indicativeof the proactive approach to the managementof risk at the ECB.
Analysis of investment performanceQuarterly, semi-annual and annual analyses
of investment performance and risk arepresented to the Governing Council and the81
Executive Board of the ECB, as well asportfolio managers and senior decision-
makers at the ECB and in the Eurosystem.

Performance and risk are measured incompliance with the Association ofInvestment Management and Research (AIMR)
recommendations. Investment performance isalso analysed to identify the sources of
performance. In 2001 special attention was
paid to an examination of the liquidityconstraints implied by managing anintervention portfolio. All markets or
instruments in which the ECB invests mustmeet pre-set liquidity criteria approved bythe Executive Board. These requirements
imply a definition of liquidity that should bemet even in stress situations. Clearly, themost stringent liquidity requirements are for
the foreign currency reserves. It is importantfor the ECB to know the impact ofthese demanding liquidity criteria. Its
investments are therefore compared againsttheoretical efficient frontiers so as to measurethe cost in terms of return foregone resulting
from its definition of liquidity.Establishment of appropriate risk managementmeasures and complianceRisk management and compliance measuresare in place to measure and manage market,credit and liquidity risk. Duration is the
primary measure of market risk used.
However, relative market risk measures such
as Value at Risk and tracking error are alsomonitored. Tracking error is a particularlyuseful measure, as it provides one figure
reflecting the market risk that portfoliomanagers take regardless of its origin (spreadrisk, yield curve risk and shift risk are all
subsumed into this figure). Considerableresources have also been devoted to the
decomposition of market risk into risk

sources. This type of information helpsdevelop a deeper understanding of thecomposition of the returns.The ECB™s prudent stance towards risk isreflected in its investment decisions, in
which considerable emphasis is placed onhigh creditworthiness and liquidity. To beeligible for participation in foreign reserve
management operations, counterparties must
meet minimum rating criteria and satisfycertain operational requirements. Minimum
rating levels are set for the counterpartiesdepending on the nature of the transactionbeing conducted and its inherent credit risk.
Analysis of the credit status of counterpartiesis carried out to supplement agency creditratings using a multivariate statistical
technique developed by the Risk ManagementDivision. Credit limits are determined forcounterparties and distributed among the
NCBs according to the proportion of total
funds that they manage on behalf of the ECB.All trading relationships with approved
counterparties are supported by the
appropriate legal documentation.3Future developments for 2002
In 2002 efforts to improve the risk
management framework of the ECB willcontinue.Eurosystem credit operations: newdevelopments will include the incorporation
of an enhanced treatment of liquidity risk.Additionally, analysis will be devoted to theimpact of the Basel proposal on Capital

Adequacy on the collateral framework.Interesting work lies ahead of the ECB onthe possibility of increasing the sources ofcredit risk information to assess the financialsoundness of Eurosystem collateral.In investment operations the focus will be ontwo main areas. First, performance attributionwill be enhanced so as to increase the

precision with which performance can beattributed to market factors. This will enrichthe current ex post analysis of performance
in order to provide decision-makers withimproved information for future investmentdecisions. Second, an IT platform will be
82implemented so as to link all the currentapplications used for risk management. Thisplatform will facilitate the integration of credit
and market reports and analysis. Thecombined analysis will provide moreopportunities for the risk management
function to add value to the decision-makingprocess.Ultimately, these initiatives will ensure thatthe ECB achieves the maximum returnavailable while fully observing the constraintswithin which it operates. The proper
management of its financial risks ensures the
financial independence and strength of theECB. This in turn enhances the ECB™sreputation and institutional independence,
which ultimately allow it to fulfil its primaryobjective of maintaining price stability. In thiscontext, the importance of managing risk

efficiently and appropriately is clear.83
Chapter IVEconomic developmentsin the other countries of theEuropean Union
86The Eurosystem and the NCBs of the non-participating EU countries co-operate closely
in the context of the General Council of theECB, with a view to contributing to themaintenance of price stability in the EU as a
whole. A regular review of macroeconomicconditions as well as monetary and exchangerate policies is an integral part of the

co-ordination exercise between theEurosystem and the three NCBs currently
not participating in the single monetary policy.
Although these NCBs conduct their monetary
policies within different institutional andoperational frameworks, the ultimate goal of
monetary policy for all of them is to maintain
price stability.DenmarkThe Danish economy slowed in 2001, withreal GDP growing by a moderate 1.2% in2001, down from 3.0% in 2000 (see Table 11).This apparently sharp slowdown includes theeffect of a hurricane in December 1999, which
boosted activity in 2000. The fact
that this temporary increase in activityfaded may alone have accounted for up to
1.5 percentage points of the fall in growthbetween that year and 2001. Export growthdeclined from 11.5% in 2000 to 3.4% in 2001.

Import growth also declined, however, andthe contribution of net exports to real GDP
growth remained both positive and significant
in 2001. This continued export growth
reflects the fact that wind turbine exportssoared while the demand for pharmaceuticals
and pork exports remained relativelyinsensitive to economic fluctuations. Porkexports benefited temporarily from the
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in theUnited Kingdom. Consumer confidenceincreased slightly, while private consumption
grew modestly, by 1.1%, and public

consumption grew by 1.4% in 2001. Together,these latter components were not sufficientto offset a fall in investment, which in
materials and construction reverted to levelssimilar to those in 1999. The contribution ofdomestic demand, including stocks, to real
GDP growth declined from 2.5% in 2000 to
0.8% in 2001. The Danish labour marketcontinued to be relatively tight, with the
unemployment rate falling to a low of 4.3%.Despite the tight labour market and highenergy prices, price developments inDenmark remained broadly contained in2001. The rate of increase in the HICP
remained relatively stable throughout theyear, the annual average falling to 2.3% from2.7% in 2000. Wages continued to grow at a

faster rate than in the euro area, mostly onaccount of a fall in working hours as holidayentitlement increased, although public sector
wage acceleration was high. Compensationper employee rose by a modest 4.2% and
unit labour costs by 3.5% in 2001. Both figures
remain above those for the euro area.Denmark™s public finances remained sound in2001. The general government surplusremained at 2.5% of GDP in 2001 (excludingUMTS proceeds), as in the previous year.
Government debt continued to decline. Thedebt level fell from 46.8% of GDP to 44.5%.
The updated Danish Convergence
Programme targets budgetary surpluses of1.9% and 2.1% of GDP in 2002 and 2003respectively. These balances are lower than

those envisaged in the previous update of theConvergence Programme. The difference canmainly be explained by the proposed
reorganisation of the Special Pension SavingsScheme, which is no longer included in the
government sector. The gross debt ratio is
only moderately affected by this reform andis projected to fall to 42.9% of GDP in 2002
and 40.1% in 2003.
Following the referendum on the adoption ofthe euro on 28 September 2000, Denmark
continued to pursue a fixed exchange ratepolicy vis-à-vis the euro, maintaining a narrowband of ±2.25% for the krone around its
ERM II central rate against the euro. Given

this policy, developments in key official andshort-term market interest rates should
primarily be seen against the background of
the ECB™s interest rate decisions anddevelopments in the exchange rate of thekrone against the euro. The krone remained
stable in 2001 (see Chart 28), holding a levelmarginally stronger than its central rate of
DKK 7.46038 for most of the year. Danmarks
Nationalbank intervened in the markets in
late September, purchasing foreign exchangeto dampen an appreciation in the krone. The

krone had strengthened as a result of somepension funds readjusting their portfolios,shifting out of foreign equities and into
domestic bonds to protect their reservesagainst a further decline in international stock
prices.In 2001 a series of five cuts in the lendingrate of Danmarks Nationalbank between July

and November reduced its spread over themarginal interest rate on the ECB™s mainrefinancing operations to 35 basis points (see
Chart 27). This is similar to the spread
prevailing before the referendum inSeptember 2000. Besides two smaller
reductions of 0.05 percentage point each,Danmarks Nationalbank decreased thelending rate by 0.3 percentage point on
30 August and by 0.5 percentage point on18 September, in line with the ECB™s decisionsto lower key interest rates. On 8 November,
the lending rate was again reduced by0.5 percentage point, in line with the keyECB interest rate reduction of the same
magnitude, to 3.6%. In early February 2002the lending rate was further reduced to3.55%. Developments in long-term interest

rates in 2001 broadly mirrored those in theeuro area. The spread between Danish andeuro area long-term bond yields declined to
almost nil in early 2001, subsequentlyremaining slightly positive for the rest of the
year.

90SwedenThe Swedish economy slowed downsignificantly in 2001 (see Chart 27). Real GDPgrew by 1.2%, compared with 3.6% in 2000
(see Table 12). The international slowdown
affected the Swedish export industrymarkedly, reflecting the relatively highexposure of the Swedish economy to

developments in the United States and thetelecommunications industry. Export growthdeclined to 1.4% in 2001, down from 10.3%
in 2000. Investment growth also decelerated
markedly due to the decline in demand and
resource utilisation. Partly due to heavy stock

market declines that reduced both householdwealth and consumer confidence, privateconsumption was also particularly affected,

growing by 0.2% compared with 4.6% in 2000.Real disposable income continued to developfavourably, largely due to tax cuts. This mainly
resulted in an improvement in the savingsratio, however, rather than supporting
consumer expenditure. Import growth also
decelerated, and the contribution to realGDP growth from net exports rose to
1.0 percentage point. The contribution from

domestic demand was 0.7 percentage point.The rapid slowdown in economic activityhas so far not had major repercussions on
the labour market, and the unemploymentrate remained relatively stable at around 5%,with continued growth in private service
sector employment.Annual inflation rates, as measured by the
HICP, the CPI and UND1X1, rose rapidly inthe spring of 2001 to around 3%, which wassimilar to the situation in the euro area (see
Chart 27). Throughout the rest of the year,inflation rates remained around 3%. Annualaverage HICP inflation was 2.7%, up from
1.3% in 2000, while the CPI rose to 2.6%
from 1.3% in 2000. The rise in inflationstemmed mainly from developments in items

such as meat, domestic fruit and vegetables,electricity and telephone charges. These pricecomponents were affected by various
temporary supply shocks such as the effectsof foot-and-mouth disease and BSE in thefood industry, and weather conditions. For
the remaining domestic price components therise was more gradual and general, and waslargely explained by the indirect effects of
previous oil price hikes, the rapid increase inresource utilisation in recent years, asreflected in rising unit labour costs, and, in
markets with weak competition, increasedprofits. Unit labour costs rose by 4.5%compared with 5.7% in 2000, largely due to
the cyclical deceleration in labour productivity,implying a risk to the employment andinflation outlook. However, monthly wage

statistics show lower growth rates, includingfor unit labour costs. Imported inflationmoderated in 2001, despite the weakening

of the krona, reflecting the decrease in oil
prices.The Swedish general government fiscalsurplus increased from 3.7% of GDP in2000 to 4.7% of GDP in 2001. Tax cuts of

approximately 1% of GDP were offset by one-off revenues, among other things. Despitethese tax cuts, the Swedish tax ratio remains
high relative to those observed in otherindustrialised countries. The debt-to-GDPratio increased slightly from 55.3% in 2000
to 56% in 2001. The updated SwedishConvergence Programme targets budgetsurpluses of 2.1% and 2.2% of GDP in 2002

and 2003 respectively. This reduction of thebudget surplus results to a large extent fromthe phasing-in of the income tax reform that
started in 2000. The debt-to-GDP ratio isprojected to fall to 49.7% in 2002 and 47.3%in 2003.
Since 1993 Sveriges Riksbank has operatedunder a flexible exchange rate regime with
the objective of monetary policy expressedas an explicit inflation target. Since 1995 theinflation target has been quantified as a 2%
increase in the CPI with a tolerance marginof ±1 percentage point. In June 2001 the
central bank intervened in the currency1UNDIX is defined as the CPI excluding interest expenditure and
direct effects of altered indirect taxes and subsidies. In Sweden,
headline CPI is the target variable of monetary policy. However,
when in recent years transient factors have had an impact on
the forecast, monetary policy decisions have been based on an
assessment of UND1X.91
market against the background of a marked
depreciation in the krona. Combined with

the effects of relatively high resourceutilisation and unexpectedly rapid price
increases which could have affected inflation
expectations, Sveriges Riksbank took the viewthat there was a risk of the inflation targetbeing exceeded. It consequently increased the
repo rate on 5 July by 0.25 percentage pointto 4.25%. Following the terrorist attacks inthe United States and a more accentuated
international slowdown early in the autumn,Sveriges Riksbank then lowered the repo rateon 17 September by 0.5 percentage point
owing to an increased risk that projectedinflation would be below the target.Reflecting these changes in the official interest
rate, short-term market interest rates inSweden moved above comparable euro area
rates in mid-2001, with the spread standing
at around 50 basis points at the end of theyear (see Chart 27). Long-term interest ratestracked developments on the internationalcapital markets with no clear direction for
most of the year, and the differential with theeuro area had moved from around -10 to
around 40 basis points by the end of 2001.
This was probably related to an increasedexchange rate premium in the wake of the
krona™s depreciation and greater internationaluncertainty. The krona depreciated by nearly11% against the euro up to September before
recovering at the end of the year and in early
2002 (see Chart 28).United KingdomAverage real GDP growth in the United
Kingdom slowed to 2.4%, compared with
3.0% in 2000, as external weakness was onlypartly offset by strong domestic demand (see
Table 13). The gradual slowdown stemmedmainly from a contraction in high-techindustries, especially in optical and electronic1996199719981999200020012001200120012001

92equipment, faltering foreign demand and thepersistent strength of the pound sterling. Thiswas also reflected in a greater divergence
between various sectors of the economy, a
larger current account deficit and a lowersavings ratio. In particular, output in the
manufacturing sector recorded a decline of2.3% after an increase of 1.9% in 2000,whereas growth of value added in the services
sector remained strong at 4.0%, comparedwith 3.8% in 2000.Real household consumption grew by 4.2% in2001, marginally above the rate of 4.1% inthe preceding year. Increased real earnings,

rises in household wealth and vigorous creditexpansion were the main driving factors. Thestrength of the housing market was linked to
low real interest rates and increasedcompetition in the mortgage market following
earlier financial deregulation. Output growth
was also supported by an acceleration in
public consumption from 1.9% in 2000 to
2.4% in 2001, reflecting progress towardsgovernment spending targets. Gross fixedcapital formation grew by 1.1%, down from
4.9% in 2000. Business investment washampered by a worsening financial positionof the corporate sector and increased
uncertainty about demand prospects. Thislatter factor also induced companies to rundown their inventory levels, reducing real
GDP growth by 0.1 percentage point. Theweakness in business investment was partlycompensated by an acceleration in
government investment, reflecting plans toupgrade the public sector™s capital stock. Thecontribution of domestic demand to real GDP
growth was 3.3 percentage points, somewhatlower than in 2000. For the sixth year ina row, foreign trade made a negative
contribution, with export growth falling from1996199719981999200020012001200120012001

10.3% in 2000 to 0.8% in 2001. Import growthalso fell, but less strongly than exports dueto the continued strength of domestic

demand and to the relatively strong value ofsterling with respect to the euro. Total
employment expanded at an annual rate of
0.8%, somewhat below the increase in 2000,reducing the unemployment rate from 5.4%in 2000 to around 5% in 2001. In the second

half of the year, however, the labour marketshowed some signs of weakening, as theunemployment rate increased slightly and
skills shortages were reported to haveeased somewhat. In general, however,unemployment remained stable and lower
than predicted.RPIX inflation remained below theGovernment™s target of 2.5% for almost thewhole year.2 HICP inflation increased to 1.2%
in 2001, from 0.8% in 2000. Import prices fell
slightly compared with 2000. In the first half
of the year, poor weather and the foot-and-mouth epidemic had a temporary upward
effect on inflation. Inflation was temperedby subdued developments in commodityand producer prices. Annual earnings growth
in the economy as a whole increasedsomewhat compared with 2000, maskingrobust growth in regular pay which was offset
by lower bonuses. Annual growth in unitlabour costs in the economy as a whole also
rose compared with the previous year.
Overall, cost pressures seem to haveremained rather subdued and the pick-up ininflation may have been an indication that
retailers™ margins were recovering, possibly
as a reflection of the sustained strength ofprivate consumption.Following the sizeable improvement in the
general government budget in previous yearsresulting in a surplus of 1.8% (excluding UMTSlicences) in 2000, the surplus declined to 0.9%of GDP in 2001. This decline was the result

of a significant increase in governmentexpenditure which created an expansionaryfiscal policy stance. The debt-to-GDP ratio
fell from 42.4% in 2000 to 39% in 2001.The updated Convergence Programmeprojects a further fiscal expansion, leading to
deficits of 0.2% and 1.1% of GDP for the
fiscal years 2001-2002 and 2002-2003respectively. The debt-to-GDP ratio is

projected to fall modestly to 38.1% and 37.2%during these years.The Bank of England conducts monetarypolicy within a flexible exchange rate regimewith an explicit and symmetric inflation target,
set by the Government at an annual increasein the RPIX of 2.5%. In 2001 the official reporate was reduced seven times by a total
of 2 percentage points to 4.0%. Thesereductions came in a context of a weakeninginternational environment, a downturn in the
manufacturing sector and a benign inflationoutlook. As a result of the interest rate
cuts, the short-term interest rate differential
vis-à-vis the euro area continued to narrow,albeit at a slower pace than in 2000. Long-term interest rates rose in the first half of
the year, and then fell back to end the yearbelow their level at the start of 2001. Theyremained below the average euro area rates
for most of the year (see Chart 27). The
pound sterling exchange rate against the eurofluctuated around an average of GBP 0.62.

Its appreciation during the first half of theyear to GBP 0.59 was broadly offset by adepreciation in July and August.2The RPIX is defined as the Retail Price Index excluding mortgage

In 2001 the ECB continued to maintainand develop its regular contact withCommunity institutions and relevant bodies.1As foreseen in Article 113 of the Treaty, ECBrepresentatives attended several meetings ofthe ECOFIN Council when matters relating
to the tasks and objectives of the ESCB were
being discussed. In 2001 such matters related
to financial market issues and the preparation
of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines
(BEPG) in particular. At the same time, thePresident of the ECOFIN Council used theopportunity to participate in meetings of the

Governing Council of the ECB on severaloccasions. In this context, it should be notedthat during the first half of 2001, when the
EU Council Presidency was held by Sweden,a Member State with a derogation, thePresident of the Eurogroup attended
Governing Council meetings on behalf of the
President of the ECOFIN Council. A memberof the European Commission also participated
in meetings of the Governing Council.Beyond this contact on the basis ofArticle 113 of the Treaty, the President of theECB and the governors of the national central
banks were invited to the three informal
meetings of the ECOFIN Council which took
place in Malmö (Sweden) in April and in Li
ègeand Laeken (Belgium) in September and
December 2001 respectively. The Malmömeeting also gave the ECOFIN ministers, the
governors of the national central banks of the
Member States and the President of the ECBthe opportunity to hold an exchange of viewswith their counterparts from the 13 candidate

countries. The meeting in Liège allowed for afirst in-depth discussion and assessment of theeconomic consequences of the terrorist attacks

on the United States on 11 September 2001.Furthermore, the President of the ECB wasinvited to an exchange of views with the EU
Heads of State or Government at the informal
European Council meeting in Ghent in October.On this occasion, the discussion focused on the

general economic situation and the state ofpreparation for the introduction of the eurobanknotes and coins.1The ECB™s relations with the European Parliament are dealt with
separately in Chapter XI of this Annual Report.In line with past practice, the ECB continuedto attend meetings of the Eurogroup on a
regular basis. Participation in those meetings
provides an opportunity for the ECB to
engage in an open and informal policy dialoguewith the finance ministers of the euro areaMember States and the Commissioner
responsible for Economic and MonetaryAffairs. Discussions within the Eurogroup
continued to concentrate on the overall
economic outlook for the euro area,budgetary developments in individual euro
area Member States and, with increasing
intensity, the progress of necessary structural
reform. A further specific focus of theEurogroup in 2001 was a regular monitoring
of the state of preparation for the euro cashchangeover.In addition to the relations described aboveat the political level, the ECB participated inthe work of the Economic and Financial
Committee (EFC) and the Economic PolicyCommittee (EPC). Through its membershipof both committees, which provide analysis
and advice for the ECOFIN Council and theEurogroup, the ECB was able to contributeits expertise to the various economic policy
procedures and multilateral surveillance
exercises. In this vein, the ECB participatedin, inter alia, the preparation of the Broad
Economic Policy Guidelines and theassessment of the Member States™ stability
and convergence programmes. Moreover, the
ECB contributed to the wide range of otheractivities of both committees, including therefinement of analytical tools and methods

and the comprehensive country review
exercise of the EPC. Since the focus of thelatter is mainly on structural reform and leads
to the EPC™s annual report on structuralreform, the contribution to this workprovides the ECB not only with a useful
insight into the process of structural reform,
97
but also with the opportunity to share itsviews with Member States.The ECB also continued to attend thebiannual meetings of the MacroeconomicDialogue, at both the technical and the
political level. In line with the mandate
provided by the Cologne European Council,representatives of the Member States, the

European Commission, the ECB, non-euroarea central banks and the EU level social
partners discussed the economic outlook and
related policy challenges. The MacroeconomicDialogue thereby continued to allow for aconfidential exchange of views and
confidence-building among the participants.Finally, the ECB continued to maintain closeworking relations with the EuropeanCommission. Beyond regular working contactcovering a variety of areas, there were
bilateral visits between the President of theEuropean Commission, the Commissioner forEconomic and Monetary Affairs and members
of the Executive Board.From among the broad range of topics dealt
with by the European institutions and bodieswith which the ECB maintains close relations,the following are highlighted given their
economic and institutional importance.1.1Development of the Economic
Policy FrameworkIn the third year since the start of StageThree of EMU, the economic policy
framework, with its specific allocation of
policy responsibilities, multilateral proceduresand common policy instruments, continued
to be further developed and refined.2Particular attention was placed on improvingthe Broad Economic Policy Guidelines as aninstrument for guiding the economic policy
decisions in the Member States and onprocedural and methodological refinementsto the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover,
the use of the ﬁopen method of co-ordinationﬂ established by the Lisbon
European Council was extended, in particular2An article entitled ﬁThe economic policy framework in EMUﬂ
was published in the November 2001 issue of the ECB™s Monthly
Bulletin.by an increased reference to indicators andprecise timetables for the achievement andassessment of progress in a growing number
of policy areas.The 2001 Broad Economic Policy GuidelinesFor the adoption of the Broad Economic
Policy Guidelines (BEPG), the Communityapplied for the first time the procedureinitiated by the Lisbon European Council.

Accordingly, the BEPG benefited fromcontributions from a wider range of Councilformations, including, in addition to the
ECOFIN Council, the Employment and SocialPolicy Council and the Internal MarketCouncil. Moreover, in line with the

understanding that the European Councilshould take on a pre-eminent guiding and co-ordinating role with regard to the coherence
of the BEPG and the effective monitoring ofprogress as concerns their implementation,the Stockholm European Council in March
provided guidance on key issues to be dealtwith in the 2001 BEPG.The European Commission presented acomprehensive report on the implementationof the BEPG of the previous year. Its
implementation reports, which are drafted inaccordance with Article 99 (3) of the Treaty,serve to provide an accurate and detailed

picture of the actual implementation of theBEPG. In this way, achievements as well as
failures and lack of progress with regard to

the actual implementation of the BEPG can
be highlighted and serve as a basis for theformulation of new guidelines for the

following year. The close monitoring ofadherence to the recommendations of theBEPG is essential in that, on the basis of

Article 99 (4) of the Treaty, the ECOFINCouncil may decide to issue a specificrecommendation to an individual Member
State in the event of non-compliance with
98the BEPG or if the policies of a Member Statewould risk jeopardising the proper functioningof Economic and Monetary Union. In 2001
the ECOFIN Council adopted the first
recommendation under this specific provisionwhich is intended to ensure adherence to the
BEPG.Refining the implementation of the Stability
and Growth PactIn EMU, in accordance with Article 104 ofthe Treaty, Member States are committed toavoid excessive deficits. Moreover, their
budgetary policies are framed within the rulesof the Stability and Growth Pact. Under theseterms, the euro area Member States submit
to the EU Council and the EuropeanCommission each year stability programmeswhich provide the necessary information for
the multilateral surveillance of their budgetarypolicies. Each Member State™s stabilityprogramme should present the medium-term
objective of its budgetary policy, which shouldbe close to balance or in surplus, and theadjustment path towards this objective.
Moreover, it should describe the economicpolicy measures being taken Œ or to be takenŒ to achieve this objective and present the
main assumptions about expected economicdevelopments and how changes in these
assumptions would affect budgetary
outcomes. Correspondingly, the non-euroarea Member States present convergenceprogrammes providing comparable
information to that contained in the stabilityprogrammes, as well as information onmedium-term monetary policy objectives. The
stability and convergence programmes areexamined by the EU Council, which assessesthe appropriateness of the objectives,

assumptions and measures contained therein,in particular with a view to avoiding excessivedeficits. Moreover, the EU Council assesses

their consistency with the BEPG.In view of the central role of the stability and
convergence programmes in the process ofmultilateral surveillance, it is important thattheir content is appropriate and allows forcomparisons to be made across Member
States. Recognising this, the MonetaryCommittee (the legacy committee of the
Economic and Financial Committee) adopted,and the ECOFIN Council endorsed on12 October 1998, an Opinion and a Code of
Conduct on the content and format of
stability and convergence programmes. TheCode of Conduct, which serves as a checklist
to be used by the Member States in preparingtheir stability and convergence programmes,provides precise guidelines as to the
information to be presented in terms of, interalia, budgetary objectives, underlyingassumptions, policy measures and sensitivity
analysis.In 2001 the Economic and FinancialCommittee reviewed experience gained withthe assessment of stability and convergenceprogrammes since the adoption of the Code
of Conduct. It considered that, on the whole,
the Code of Conduct of 1998 had contributedto well-functioning procedures, but that some
improvements could nonetheless be made.To this end, it adopted a new Opinion and
Code of Conduct. The latter were endorsed

by the ECOFIN Council at its meeting on10 July 2001. The new Opinion and Code ofConduct update and revise their predecessors
in the following respects:First, the revised Opinion and Code of

Conduct provide greater clarity regardingthe BEPG™s role in relation to the Stability
and Growth Pact. In particular, it is
stressed that the stability and convergenceprogrammes should be consistent with theBEPG, which is the overarching instrument

of economic policy co-ordination.
Second, the revised Opinion and Code of
Conduct lay the foundations for a greaterequality of treatment across MemberStates. Henceforth, the content and format
of stability and convergence programmesare to be more standardised. Member
States are to respect a minimum set of
information requirements agreed by theEconomic and Financial Committee andannexed to the Code of Conduct. As far99
as possible, common assumptions are tobe used by all Member States as regardsthe external economic environment.
Finally, stability and convergenceprogrammes should be submitted bothearlier and within a shorter period of time
than has been the case thus far. This shouldallow the ECOFIN Council to examine allstability and convergence programmes
within a maximum of two consecutivesessions.Third, the revised Opinion and Code ofConduct take into account the conclusionsof the Lisbon and Stockholm European
Councils with regard to the quality ofpublic finances and the budgetary
implications of population ageing. Thus, in
future, the stability and convergenceprogrammes should present the measuresbeing taken to improve the quality of public
finances. They should also describe thelonger-term budgetary implications of
population ageing and outline the strategy
to tackle this problem.1.2Financial market reform
Since the introduction of the euro, increasingattention has been devoted to removing theremaining obstacles to the emergence of atruly single market for financial services in

order to reap the full benefits of the singlecurrency. In Lisbon in March 2000, the Headsof State or Government set the ambitious

target of making the EU the most competitiveand dynamic knowledge-based economy in
the world. To meet this objective, it called
for, inter alia, an acceleration of thecompletion of the internal market for financialservices. In 2001 further important steps
were taken to this end. In particular, theStockholm European Council called for amore rapid implementation of the Financial
Services Action Plan (FSAP) and endorsedthe ﬁLamfalussy reportﬂ on measures to
speed up the implementation of regulations
needed for the creation of an efficientEuropean securities market.The Financial Services Action Plan
The Stockholm European Council called forfull implementation of the Financial ServicesAction Plan by 2005 in order to overcomethe remaining imperfections in the European
market for financial services. Thus, morepolitical weight was put behind this crucialproject which was launched in 1999.
The FSAP provides guidelines for thenecessary measures to be taken in the area
of financial markets, in that it identifies areasin which progress is needed and provides
guidance for their implementation. Results
achieved are regularly reviewed by theEuropean Commission, assisted by theFinancial Services Policy Group in which the
ECB is also represented. In its fifth ProgressReport on the implementation of the FSAP,which was issued in December 2001, the
Commission considered that significantprogress had been made. Of the 42 measuresidentified in the FSAP, 25 had been adopted
since 1999 or were about to be adopted atthat point in time. In 2001 the EU Council
and the European Parliament adopted legal
acts relating to the European companystatute, money laundering and undertakingsfor collective investment in transferable
securities (UCITS). Of the remaining 17 FSAP
measures there were only six legislative
proposals still to be made by the Commission.
These included the revision of the capitaladequacy framework for banks andinvestment firms and the Investment Services
Directive. Thus, responsibility for the rapidimplementation of the FSAP has now shiftedmainly to the EU Council and European

Parliament, which need to adopt the
necessary legislation on the basis of European
Commission proposals. In this context, in
December 2001 an agreement was reached
within the EU Council on four proposalsrelating to the distance marketing of financial
services, financial collateral, market abuse andinternational accounting standards (IAS).However,  the Commission
™s fifth Progress
Report also highlighted the fact thatimportant concerns still remain. These relatein particular to the absence of tangible

100progress on the Pension Funds Directive and
the proposed directive on takeover bids
which, after 12 years of negotiation, was

rejected by the European Parliament.Therefore, in spite of the progress achievedso far, more decisive action needs to be taken
in order to deliver the Action Plan within the
agreed time frame. To this end, the
Commission initiated a mid-term review in
February 2002.The Lamfalussy reportWith the endorsement of the measures
suggested in the Report of the Committee ofWise Men on the regulation of Europeansecurities markets, the Stockholm European
Council also signalled the importance it
attached to the rapid achievement of a trulyintegrated securities market (which should
be completed by 2003). The Committee ofWise Men, chaired by Mr. Lamfalussy, wasset up in July 2000 to examine how to achieve
a more effective approach towards theimplementation of regulations needed for thecreation of an efficient securities market in
the EU. The ﬁLamfalussy reportﬂ, which waspublished in February 2001 after a wide-
ranging consultation to which the ECB also
contributed, proposed a four-level approachfor the adoption of securities marketregulations and the monitoring of their
proper implementation. Moreover, the reportsuggested that two new committees be
established, namely the European Securities
Committee (ESC) with both regulatory andadvisory functions, and the advisoryCommittee of European Securities Regulators
(CESR). Against this background, the four-level approach for the adoption andmonitoring of the implementation of
securities market regulations is designed asfollows. At the first level, the basic principlesof the respective legislation are to be laid
down through framework directives andregulations; at this level, the ESC is to assistthe Commission in drafting its proposals.
At the second level, the Commission willadopt implementing legislation with theassistance of the ESC under a specificcomitology procedure. In this context, theCESR will provide the Commission withtechnical advice in relation to the preparation
of its proposals. The function of the thirdlevel is to ensure that Community law is
interpreted in an efficient and consistent
manner. The CESR is to perform this task.Finally, at the fourth level, the Commissionwill monitor compliance with Community law
on the part of Member States.Since the above-mentioned endorsement ofthe Lamfalussy report by the StockholmEuropean Council, the two committees havebeen set up. The ESC is composed of
representatives of ministries of finance ofMember States and is chaired by the EuropeanCommission. The CESR, which operates as a

body independent from the Commission,brings together the heads of the national
public authorities competent in the field of
securities regulation and supervision. InSeptember 2001 it took over the activitiesand secretariat of the informal Forum of

European Securities Commissions (FESCO).The ECB participates as an observer in themeetings of the ESC and may be invited by

the CESR to its meetings ﬁwhere this isrelevantﬂ, as foreseen in the latter™s statutes.The Commission has made proposals for twonew directives, on prospectuses and market
abuse,3 which should be adopted and
implemented in accordance with the newrules. On the basis of Article 105 (4) of the
Treaty, the ECB delivered its Opinions on
the two proposals on 18 and 22 November2001 respectively. In its Opinion concerningthe proposed directive on prospectuses, the
ECB welcomed the proposal as an effective
means of advancing the integration ofEuropean financial markets. The proposed
directive will improve market access forraising capital in the EU and eliminate existingobstacles to cross-border offerings of3Commission proposals for directives of the European Parliament
and of the Council (i) on the prospectus to be published when
securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and
(ii) on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse).101
securities. However, the ECB noted that ahigh level of disclosure has to be weighedagainst the need for an efficient issuance
process, with costs proportional to the sizeof the issuing company and the type of
securities issued. In its Opinion concerning
the proposed directive on market abuse, theECB welcomed the proposal as a contribution
to the establishment of sound and consistent
standards, which should further promote theintegrity of European financial markets,enhance investor confidence and ensure the
smooth functioning of the markets.On 5 February 2002, the Commission and
the European Parliament reached anagreement which resolved some remaining
institutional questions relating to the
Lamfalussy procedure, in particular withregard to the role of the European Parliament
in the adoption of implementing legislation.
This agreement removed the final obstacle tothe application of the Lamfalussy procedure
in the case of forthcoming financial marketlegislation, starting with the aforementioneddirectives on prospectuses and market abuse.2Multilateral issues
In 2001 the Eurosystem continued to
participate in the activities of internationalorganisations and fora related to monetary,financial and economic issues. The practical
arrangements for the internationalrepresentation and co-operation of the ECB,as described in the ECB™s Annual Report1999, remained broadly unchanged. Workingrelations with several internationalorganisations and fora were deepened. In
particular, the IMF completed a Report onthe Observance of Standards and Codes(ROSC) for the euro area, and the OECD

drew up its first ﬁEconomic Survey of theEuro Areaﬂ (see Section 2.2). Financial
relations with the IMF were strengthened
through the conclusion of a special drawingrights (SDR) selling and buying arrangementbetween the IMF and the ECB, as prescribed
holder, on 18 April 2001. This arrangementallows the IMF to initiate SDR transactionsbetween the ECB and other holders of SDRs,
thereby contributing to the smoothmanagement of the IMF™s SDR department.2.1Multilateral and bilateral
surveillance of macroeconomic
policiesThe Eurosystem participates in regular peerreviews (multilateral surveillance) andconsultations with international institutions(bilateral surveillance) of monetary, financialand economic developments and policies, asthese reviews enhance its ability to analysethe impact of external developments on euroarea variables. These procedures do not
involve ex ante international co-ordination ofthe single monetary policy with the policiescarried out by non-euro area countries. Such
ex ante co-ordination, going beyond regularexchanges of information and views among
major policy-makers, would be incompatible

with the mandate of the Eurosystem 
Œ which
is to maintain price stability in the euroarea Œ and with its independence.
Multilateral surveillanceThe ECB participated in the exchange of
information and views with other policy-
makers in multilateral organisations and fora.Regular meetings on monetary, financial and
economic developments and policies in major
economic areas contributed to, inter alia,clarifying views on current policies in the euro
area and on the impact of external
developments on the euro area economy.Some of these meetings were prepared at
the EU level, inter alia by the EFC.In 2001, several international meetingsprovided an opportunity for such multilateral
exchanges of views. The President of the ECB,together with the Eurogroup Presidency,
represented the euro area in the sessions of
102the meetings of G7 finance ministers andcentral bank governors devoted tosurveillance and exchange rate issues. The
President of the ECB also participated in thediscussions on the state of the worldeconomy in a number of other informal fora,
such as the ministers and governors of theG10 and the G20.The ECB Observer participated in the regularreviews by the IMF Executive Board of worldeconomic and market developments and in
the discussions by the IMF Executive Boardof the ﬁWorld Economic Outlookﬂ (May,
October and December 2001).The ECB participated in the Economic PolicyCommittee of the OECD, which discussed

the short-term global outlook and near-term
policy requirements, thereby contributing tothe preparation of the OECD Economic

Outlook (June and November 2001).Furthermore, the Economic PolicyCommittee reviewed economic policies
aimed at fostering growth and discussed thepolicy implications of trends in saving andinvestment. The ECB also took part in

meetings of sub-committees and workingparties of the EPC.
Bilateral surveillanceThe Eurosystem contributed to bilateralreviews of monetary, financial and economicpolicies with the IMF and the OECD. In 2001,
the IMF staff prepared two Article IV reportson the monetary and exchange rate policiesof the euro area, which complemented the

national consultations on other policies, in
particular in the fiscal and structural areas.
The first report was circulated for
information to the IMF Executive Board andpublished in April 2001. The second reportwas discussed by the IMF Executive Board
and published in November 2001, togetherwith a public information notice summarisingthe IMF Executive Board™s assessment.4 The
Executive Directors of the IMF noted that, in
the face of a synchronised world slowdown,the euro area™s economic activity proved less4See the IMF™s website at http://www.imf.org.
resilient than anticipated, but thatmacroeconomic fundamentals remain soundin the absence of any significant imbalances.
As for monetary policy, they noted that the
risks to price stability were receding, andthat the ECB had properly reversed a
significant proportion of the monetarytightening it undertook in 2000. Theyﬁcommended the swift action by the ECB, inconcert with the US Federal Reserve and
other central banks, to shore up confidenceand provide sufficient liquidity to the banking
system in the aftermath of the events of
September 11ﬂ. The medium-term orientationof the Stability and Growth Pact was

endorsed as a contribution to confidence in
sound fiscal policy. To increase the euroarea™s growth potential, further structuralreforms, especially in the labour market,
were recommended. In addition, in
November 2001, the IMF published

background documents, prepared by its ownstaff, on relevant euro area issues, such asthe first pillar of the ECB™s monetary policystrategy, the effect of external shocks on euroarea inflation, the exchange rate of the euro,and the estimation of potential output.In the context of the Article IV consultation,the IMF also prepared a euro area Report on
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)(see Box 9).In the April 2001 the OECD published itsfirst ﬁEconomic Survey of the Euro Areaﬂ,which drew on, inter alia, the work of an
OECD staff mission to the ECB. The
Economic and Development ReviewCommittee of the OECD, in which the

Eurogroup Presidency, the EuropeanCommission and the ECB jointly representedthe European Community, was responsible
for finalising the survey. The survey noted
that external developments had generatedconcerns about macroeconomic prospects in
the euro area, although the euro area is in abetter position to withstand such adverse
external shocks than the constituent
countries were in the past. As regards103
Box 9Euro area Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)At the ECB™s request, the IMF prepared a Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on selectedCodes and Core Principles for the euro area (November 2001). Participation in the ROSC exercise reflectedthe Eurosystem™s commitment to meeting international standards and codes, as well as their support for theinternational financial institutions™ efforts to foster compliance with best practices. It should also be seen as a
complement to the ROSC or Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) modules prepared at the levelof individual euro area Member States.The ROSC assessed the transparency of monetary policy and payment systems oversight, on the basis of theIMF™s Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies, as well as the complianceof the euro area™s two main payment systems, TARGET and Euro 1, with the CPSS Core Principles forSystemically Important Payment Systems. The IMF staff found that the Eurosystem has achieved a very highdegree of compliance with transparency principles applicable to monetary policy and payment systems
oversight. The ECB was found to pursue a large publication and public relations programme, providingextensive information on its policies, procedures and practices. In particular, the IMF staff considered that theMonthly Bulletin and other regular public statements that accompany policy decisions communicate the
monetary policy stance to the public in an open and timely manner. However, the IMF staff considered thatimprovements could be made in some areas. In particular, in order to meet the requirements under the IMF™sSpecial Data Dissemination Standard concerning the advance release calendars for monetary statistics, the
IMF staff recommended an extension of the advance publication of release dates by one month. The ECB hasbeen complying with this recommendation since September 2001. The IMF staff also considered that additionalclarification regarding the allocation of responsibilities for foreign exchange policy could be helpful. Finally,
the IMF recommended some improvements regarding disclosure practices for some functions carried out byNCBs.As regards payment systems, the ROSC concluded that Euro 1 fully observes all the Core Principles.TARGET was considered to be almost fully in line with the Core Principles and was seen as effective intransferring funds throughout the EU, thereby contributing to a smooth implementation of monetary policy
within the euro area. Nonetheless, the IMF staff identified opportunities for certain improvements in operationalreliability, risk assessment, consultation procedures, efficiency and governance (see Section 2 of Chapter VII).monetary policy, the survey examinedmonetary conditions, which were found to
have remained relatively accommodating, andreviewed several aspects of the monetarypolicy framework, including the publication
of the Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections.2.2Monitoring of developments in
global financial marketsGlobal financial market stabilityGiven that, in accordance with the Treaty,the Eurosystem must contribute to thesmooth conduct of policies pursued by thecompetent authorities relating to theprudential supervision of credit institutions

and the stability of the financial system, theECB continued to devote special attention tothe work undertaken within international
financial institutions and fora dealing withdevelopments in global financial markets.The ECB participated in the regular
monitoring of market developments by theFinancial Stability Forum (FSF), aimed atgathering views on vulnerabilities in domestic
and international financial systems, and theCommittee on the Global Financial System(CGFS), intended to identify potential sources
of vulnerabilities and assess changes in theoperational infrastructure of financialmarkets. Within the OECD, the ECB
104continued to take part in reviews of structural
developments in global financial marketscarried out by the Financial Markets
Committee. The IMF reviewed financial
market developments in its 
ﬁInternationalCapital Markets Reportﬂ (August 2001). In
preparing this Report, an IMF delegation
visited the ECB to discuss recentdevelopments in the European financial

markets, with a special focus on financialintegration and policies to ensure financialstability.Specific initiatives to enhance financialstabilityA number of international organisations andfora, in which the ECB participates, studiedspecific topics relating to the functioning of
international financial markets. Particular

attention was devoted to anti-moneylaundering initiatives and measures tocombat the financing of terrorist activities,

especially in the aftermath of the events of11 September 2001.The ECB took part in several committeesoperating under the auspices of the centralbank governors of the G10 countries. The
Basel Committee on Banking Supervisioncontinued to work on an in-depth revision ofthe capital adequacy framework (a more
detailed discussion of the revisions made tothe capital adequacy framework is providedin Chapter VIII). The CGFS analysed the
financing of the new economy, reviewedmarket liquidity conditions and studied recentchanges in the major fixed-income markets.
The G10 Deputies are preparing two studies:one on the legal underpinnings of financialmarkets with a view to enhancing their

resilience in the face of financial distress, andanother on the microeconomic determinants
of asset price developments. The ECB was
also involved in the work of both the CPSS,which is chaired by a member of the ECB™sExecutive Board, and the Gold and Foreign
Exchange Committee.The FSF reviewed progress in implementingthe recommendations that it had formulated
in 2000 to address potential concerns about
highly leveraged institutions. Progress wasnoted in the strengthening of counterpartyrisk management and regulatory oversight, as
well as in the disclosure of information byhighly leveraged institutions to creditproviders. The FSF also examined the actions
taken so far to address concerns with respectto offshore financial centres, and encouragedthese centres to improve their supervisory
and co-operation practices, inter alia throughparticipation in the assessment programme
launched by the IMF. Finally, the FSF
completed its international guidance ondeposit insurance schemes.2.3The architecture of the
international monetary and financial
systemThe Eurosystem contributed to further workon measures to improve the overall stabilityof the global monetary and financial system.These contributions were made either
through direct participation in the relevantinternational institutions and fora or throughwork at the European level, in particular in
the EFC. In this context, the Eurosystem has
closely monitored the experience of specific
regions and countries.Soundness of domestic economic policiesSpecific attention was devoted to the stabilityof domestic financial systems and the
implementation of standards and codes. TheIMF and the World Bank continued toimplement their joint Financial Sector
Assessment Programme (FSAP), wherebyfinancial sectors in individual IMF membercountries are assessed and potential
vulnerabilities are identified. Furthermore, theIMF monitored compliance with internationalstandards and codes by preparing Reports on
Observance of Standards and Codes for a
number of IMF member countries. In thecontext of an arrangement agreed with the105
IMF, the ECB provided technical experts for
FSAP and ROSC missions in 2001.Sound policies extend beyond the traditionalmacroeconomic policy domain andencompass, inter alia, prudent management
of foreign reserves, a carefully conductedliberalisation of capital movements and anappropriate exchange rate policy. The IMF
drew up guidelines for foreign exchange
reserve management (September 2001),which are not a set of binding principles, but

rather are designed to assist official foreignreserve managers in strengthening their policyframeworks, to help increase their country™sresilience to financial market shocks. Drawingon their own experience in official reservemanagement, the Eurosystem actively
contributed to the development of theguidelines.International organisations and fora also
devoted specific attention to the orderlyliberalisation of the capital account. The
Eurosystem believes that capital accountliberalisation is inherently beneficial, providedthat it is carefully designed and sequenced
in line with the development of robustdomestic financial sectors. In particular,
liberalisation should start with the most stable
elements of capital flows, i.e. long-termflows, such as foreign direct investment.Furthermore, domestic financial systems
should be sufficiently strong beforerestrictions on capital flows are totally lifted.The Eurosystem also emphasises that, for
certain countries, regional economicintegration may provide an impetus toopening the capital account.As for the choice of appropriate exchangerate policy regimes, the Eurosystem stressed
that the purpose of any exchange rate regime
is to promote economic and financialperformance, by contributing to price stability
and orderly international trade and financialrelations. Given that economies differ widely,
no exchange rate regime is suitable for all

countries, nor for any country all of the time.As there is an interactive relationshipbetween exchange rate policy and othercomponents of countries™ overall policy
frameworks, policy-makers should ensurethat exchange rate policy and underlying
conditions, especially as regards the degreeof capital account liberalisation, remainconsistent over time. This interactive

relationship also implies that all exchange rate
regimes can be subject to a shift, depending
on changing domestic and external conditions.
As regards the latter aspect, specific attention
needs to be paid to close regional tradeand financial links among countries that
may Œ provided that certain conditions are
met Œ influence the choice of regime,
its sustainability and the need for and

smoothness of a shift in regime.Regional co-operationInternational surveillance is increasingly
focusing on regional developments and issues,such as the choice of exchange rate regimesin a regional context and the exploration of
possible forms of monetary policy co-operation at a regional level. In this context,the ECB has closely reviewed regional
integration processes outside the euro area,focusing on issues such as exchange rateregimes, capital account liberalisation and
financial co-operation (e.g. the ﬁChiang MaiInitiativeﬂ within the ASEAN+3 group). The
ECB is also actively involved in several
co-operation initiatives with Asia and LatinAmerica. In particular, the Vice-President of
the ECB participated in the Third Asia-Europe

Finance Ministers™ Meeting in January 2001 in
Kobe, Japan. At that meeting it was agreed,among other things, to promote co-operative
research activity between Asia and Europeby launching a common research project, theso-called Kobe Research Project. The ECB is
actively contributing to this project throughthe preparation of a seminar on ﬁRegionaleconomic, financial and monetary co-
operation: the European and Asianexperiencesﬂ, to be hosted by the ECB in
2002. The ECB has also strengthened its

relations with Latin American countries, inparticular through the preparation, inco-operation with the Banco de España,
106of a Eurosystem seminar on regionalintegration in Latin America, also to beheld in 2002.Management of financial crisesIn the field of crisis management, the ECB
contributed to the work of the international
community, inter alia via the EFC. Thesecontributions were based to a large extenton the continuous monitoring and assessment
both of international financing and adjustmentpackages and of private sector involvementin systemically important emerging market
economies, such as Argentina and Turkey.Of particular prominence is the continuedwork on measures to involve the privatesector in financial crisis prevention and
resolution, which has been undertaken by the
IMF, the G7 and other internationalorganisations. In its contributions to thiswork, the Eurosystem has stressed the need
for clear rules that would set out therespective responsibilities of the private andpublic sectors in the resolution of crises.
Further work is needed to better define therespective roles of official and private financeand to develop procedures for their effective
implementation. In this regard, the Eurosystemtook part in the development of agreedprinciples to govern private sector involvement
and remains involved in assessing theimplementation of such principles.The Eurosystem has also taken an interest in
the IMF™s general review of conditionalityattached to financing packages. The basic

objectives of the review were to make
conditionality more efficient, effective andfocused, without weakening it. The IMF
decided that conditions should focus on thepolicy reforms that are crucial in order tohelp countries address their balance of
payments problems. In contrast, structuralmeasures that are relevant, but not of criticalimportance, should be given less priority. A
more focused conditionality also requiresstrengthened collaboration between the IMFand the World Bank.2.4The international role of the euro
The international role of the euro Œ the
second most widely used currency in theworld Œ is and will mainly be determined by
the market. The increasing liberalisation and
globalisation of financial markets willsharply limit any direct bearing whichpolicy-makers could have on such a use. The
Eurosystem is not, therefore, pursuing the
internationalisation of the euro as anindependent policy goal. Indirectly, however,
European public policies may influence futuredevelopments, since market participants willtake these policies into account when
denominating their liabilities, allocating theirportfolios among different currencies, orinvoicing external trade. For instance,
stability-oriented policies and efforts topromote an efficient and fully integratedfinancial market for euro-denominated assets
and liabilities are likely, if successful, to makethe euro more attractive to internationalborrowers and investors, thereby increasing
its role as a store of value.
As regards the international use of the euro,the evidence currently available is as follows:
as a financing currency, the share of the
international issues of euro-denominated
money market instruments increased
substantially in gross terms between the first
quarter of 1999 and the second quarter of

2001, mainly as a result of higher liquiditybrought about by the creation of anintegrated euro money market. On average,
the share of the euro
™s legacy currencies in
money market issuance by non-residents was8.5% in the period from 1994 to 1998

(US dollar 77%, Japanese yen 4.5%), whilebetween the beginning of 1999 and the end
of June 2001 the share of the euro averaged

24% (US dollar 60%, Japanese yen 3%).
A similar increase took place in the issuanceof euro-denominated international bonds and

notes. The average share of the euro™s legacycurrencies in bond issuance by non-residentsof the euro area was 18% in the period from
1994 to 1998 (US dollar 42%, Japanese yen25%). Between the beginning of 1999 and theend of June 2001 the share of the euro in107
international bond issuance rose substantially,
to 31% (US dollar 36%, Japanese yen 18%).As an investment currency, the estimatedshare of euro-denominated debt securities inthe portfolios of major global asset managers
was 28% at the end of September 2001 (USdollar 49%, Japanese yen 16%). At the same
time, holdings of euro area equity securities

Finally, with regard to the official uses of theeuro, more than 50 countries outside theeuro area currently have an exchange rate
regime involving an external anchor in whichthe euro plays a role. As a reserve currency,at the end of 2000 the euro accounted for
12.7% of the world foreign exchange reserveassets, compared with 68.2% for the US dollarand 5.3% for the Japanese yen. This level is
comparable to that reached by the legacycurrencies (mainly the Deutsche Mark, Frenchfranc and Dutch guilder) prior to the
introduction of the euro, implying that there
has been no reallocation of official reservesout of the US dollar. The official use of the
US dollar and the euro tends to differ
significantly depending on the geographicalarea.3Bilateral issues
In 2001 the Eurosystem continued to deepen
its working relations with central banks

outside the European Union. In particular, itfurther strengthened its dialogue with thecentral banks of the EU accession countries,

at both the technical and the policy level,which also includes the monitoring ofeconomic and institutional developments in
these countries.6 In parallel, the Eurosystem
also contributed to the ﬁEconomic Dialogueﬂestablished in 2001 between the European
Union and the governments of accessioncountries. Moreover, it was involved in asignificant number of activities in co-operation

with the accession countries™ central banks,
addressing a wide range of central bankingissues. Finally, the ECB further developed

working relations with central banks in otherneighbouring countries and key emergingmarkets in Asia and Latin America.3.1The EU accession process: some key
economic policy issues identified by
the EurosystemDuring the course of 2001 the process ofaccession gained considerable momentum.The Eurosystem analysed key macroeconomic
policy issues of relevance to the accession
process. Five issues deserved particularattention, namely price developments,monetary and exchange rate policy strategies,
real convergence, the structure andfunctioning of the banking and financialsectors and capital account liberalisation.
Moreover, the Eurosystem agreed on anumber of policy positions on the EUaccession process (see Box 10).
1087The Balassa-Samuelson effect occurs if productivity growth is
faster in the tradable than in the non-tradable sector, resulting in
a rise in the relative price of non-tradables. A rise in productivity

in the tradable goods sector will tend to drive up wages in this
sector and, as labour is assumed to be mobile across sectors,
push up wages in the non-tradable sector. As the latter increase
is not matched by a productivity increase, it will raise costs and
thereby prices in the non-tradable goods sector.Price developmentsOver the past few years most accession
countries have made remarkable progress inbringing down inflation, with the rate of priceincrease declining to around 6% on average
by the end of 2001 (excluding Romania, withan inflation rate of over 30%). The 
ﬁBalassa-Samuelson effectﬂ7 has often been cited as
one of the main reasons for the currentinflation differentials with the euro area.However, closer examination shows that this
effect alone does not explain the persistenceof those inflation differentials with the euro
area. Indeed, further disinflation is
complicated by, inter alia, the inflationaryimpact of the ongoing transition andconvergence-related factors, including price
liberalisation and the privatisation process.Apart from the transition and convergence-related factors, inflation differentials with the
euro area have also been due to moreexpansionary fiscal and wage policies in somecountries.Monetary and exchange rate policystrategiesOver the past few years there has been asignificant diversity in the monetary policyand exchange rate strategies of accessioncountries. While the Baltic States and Bulgaria
have kept their pegs or currency boards and
Romania has kept its managed float, thecentral and eastern European countries have
gradually moved towards more flexible
exchange rate arrangements, which hasallowed them to focus more on fighting
domestic inflation, partly through nominalappreciation. Notwithstanding this variety,the importance of the euro as a main
reference currency in pegged or managedfloating regimes has steadily increased overthe past few years. In 2001, Lithuania
announced the re-pegging of its currency,the litas, from the US dollar to the euro on
2 February 2002. Moreover, both Hungary
and Cyprus opted to shadow ERM II with a±15% fluctuation band, and to anchorexchange rate expectations already in thepre-accession phase with a view to ERM IImembership, which is a Treaty requirementfor the eventual adoption of the euro.Real convergenceWith real GDP growth in the accession
countries expected to have averaged at

around 2.9%  in 2001 (according to the IMF),
growth differentials with the euro area remainlimited. Meanwhile, the gap between average
GDP per capita Œ the most easily quantifiablemeasure of real convergence Œ in the
accession countries and in the euro area
remains large. Indeed, in 2000 income levelsin the accession countries were around 44%of the EU average in terms of purchasing

power parity and only around 22% in termsof current exchange rates. Large differencesexist between accession countries, which
exhibited individual GDP per capita figures
ranging from 24% to 82% of the EU average
in terms of purchasing power parity, and from
7% to 63% in terms of current exchange rates
for the year 2000. The size of the incomegap, combined with the small growth
differentials, suggests that the process of real
convergence will be very gradual and reachfar beyond the tentative dates for EU
accession.The banking and financial sectorAccession countries have made major
progress over the past decade in establishingwell-capitalised and sound banking sectors,although there remain a number of
transitional issues, which would need carefulmonitoring. The banking sectors have beenconsiderably strengthened through large-scale
privatisation of state-owned banks andextensive opening up to foreign investors,109
Box 10Overview of the Eurosystem™s main policy positions on accessionInflation developments: The inflation convergence criterion should not be revised to account for the
Balassa-Samuelson effect or for other factors affecting price developments in accession countries, to
ensure, inter alia, equal treatment with the current euro area countries. While keeping price increases to a
minimum is necessary in all countries to lay the foundation for macroeconomic stability and sustainablegrowth, fulfilling the Maastricht inflation criterion could, at the current stage, conflict with the structuralchanges associated with real convergence.Real and nominal convergence: Real and nominal convergence should be seen as complementary and be
pursued in parallel. Real convergence can support the nominal convergence process, as structural reformsare likely to enhance growth potential and market flexibility. Likewise, nominal convergence, by anchoring
inflation expectations, supports real convergence.Monetary and exchange rate strategies: In the pre-accession phase, no single exchange rate strategy is
prescribed, although an increasing degree of orientation towards the euro would be in line with furthereconomic and financial integration with the euro area. However, the unilateral adoption of the euro as legal
tender (ﬁeuroisationﬂ) is incompatible with the rationale and multilateral framework of EMU. FollowingEU accession, ERM II should not be seen as a mere ﬁwaiting roomﬂ for the adoption of the euro, but as a
meaningful policy framework within which to prepare the accession economies for Monetary Union and toachieve further real and nominal convergence. Euro-based currency boards may be judged compatible with
ERM II, subject to an assessment on a case-by-case basis.
Capital account liberalisation: Significant capital flows and incomplete restructuring of financial sectors
mean that the pace and sequencing of further capital account liberalisation have to be supported by
consistent macroeconomic and structural policies. As the accession countries are moving further towardsfull liberalisation, the main policy challenge consists in reducing their vulnerability to increasingly volatile
capital flows by pushing ahead with structural reforms in the financial and corporate sectors andstrengthening supervision.Financial sector structure and functioning: Accession countries need to implement legislation in the
banking and financial areas that is part of the acquis communautaire, including money laundering. Theyalso need availability of the functions necessary for financial markets and payment systems to operate in
accordance with euro area standards. They also should set up mechanisms for risk-control and crisis
management in banking and financial institutions. In countries where the banking supervision is notintegrated in the central bank, it should at least be closely linked with the central bank.Fiscal policy: In the run-up to EU accession, the authorities should be prepared to accommodate higher
public expenditure and possibly lower revenues arising from the transition and accession processes,
without compromising the progress achieved in fiscal consolidation. Backtracking on past fiscalachievements would conflict with other policy objectives, in particular the pursuit of disinflation.Acquis communautaire and central bank independence:
 The effective implementation of the acquis
communautaire is not only a legal prerequisite for accession to the EU but also implies the transformationof accession countries into fully fledged market economies, which should facilitate their integration into
the EU and, later, the euro area. In this context, it should be ensured that there is no discrepancy betweenthe central banks™ formal status in the legislation and the implementation of that legislation.
Availability of statistics: Accession countries should continue efforts to bring statistical systems up to EU
standards, as the availability of reliable and timely statistics is crucial for sound decision-making (and,ultimately, the assessment of the Maastricht criteria).
110which now own more than 60% of bankingassets on average in these countries. This hasprovided the banking sector with know-how
and capital and led to significant gains in
efficiency and financial stability. The financialsector in the accession countries is largely
dominated by the banking sector. Althoughin some accession countries the funding ofthe public sector via the debt securities

market has gained considerably in importance
with a substantial and increasing share ofdomestic and foreign non-banks as investors,
stock and bond markets still play only alimited role on average. Moreover, the degreeof financial intermediation remains relatively

low, with the bank assets-to-GDP ratio andthe credit-to-GDP ratio well below thoseprevailing in the euro area (on average
one-quarter and one-third respectively).Furthermore, the interest rate and creditchannels in the monetary policy transmission
mechanisms remain relatively weak comparedwith the exchange rate channel.Capital account liberalisation
As part of the 
acquis communautaire all
accession countries are committed tocomplying with the full liberalisation of the
capital account by the date of their accessionto the EU, provided transitional periods arenot stipulated during negotiations. So far, only
a few countries have requested transitionalregimes, and these relate mainly to areas thatare of limited relevance to monetary policy
(e.g. real estate purchases). In the course of2001 the liberalisation of capital account
progressed in several countries. Many
accession countries have already reached ahigh degree of capital account liberalisation.However, in some countries capital accounts

are still subject to a number of restrictions,which are mainly related to short-termcapital. Moreover, large current account
deficits and the likely fall in foreign directinvestment inflows in connection with lower
privatisation proceeds make many accession
countries vulnerable to external shocks.3.2Co-operation between the
Eurosystem and accessioncountries™ central banks
In 2001 the Eurosystem intensified its regularco-operation with accession countries™central banks. In total, the Eurosystem
performed 341 activities (compared to 296in 2000) involving central banks from all
accession countries. Such co-operationactivities took various forms, most frequentlytraining courses, workshops, technical
assistance, bilateral visits at expert level, andhigh-level consultation (see Chart 29).These activities related to issues such as
payment systems, economic policies and
analysis, legal requirements, prudentialsupervision, banknotes, statistics, the
monetary policy framework, the foreignexchange policy framework and informationtechnology. More information regarding co-

operation on specific issues relevant to the
accession countries™ central banks can be
found in other chapters of this Annual Report.
The annual Eurosystem seminar on theaccession process Œ bringing together the
Eurosystem and the governors of the 12accession countries Œ represents the highest
level of co-operation with the accession
countries™ central banks. After Helsinki in
1999 and Vienna in 2000, this year™s seminartook place in Berlin in December and was
jointly organised by the ECB and theDeutsche Bundesbank. The seminar focusedon the structure and functioning of the

financial sector in the accession countries,
the impact of capital account liberalisation onthe exchange rate strategies of the accession
countries and ingredients for a successfulcatching-up process.3.3The Eurosystem
™s involvement inthe Economic Dialogue between the
EU and the accession countries
The Eurosystem is involved in the Economic
Dialogue between the EU and the accessioncountries, established in early 2001 by theEU. This dialogue is not directly part of the
111
negotiations for EU membership, but is aimedat assisting the accession process by means
of an in-depth exchange between EUinstitutions and the accession countries onmacroeconomic policy and financial stability
issues in the pre-accession phase. It is alsointended to familiarise the accession countrieswith the EU procedures of mutual surveillance

and policy co-ordination to which they willbecome subject upon joining the EU.
Within the Economic Dialogue framework,the EU, including the ECB and the NCBs, andaccession countries met four times in 2001.
They met twice at the EFC level (in Stockholm
on 27 June and in Brussels on 27 November
2001) and twice at ministerial level (in Malmöon 21 April and in Brussels on 4 December2001). In 2001 the Economic Dialogue aimed atdiscussing, inter alia, the accession countries™pre-accession economic programmes.3.4Strengthening working relations
with other countriesThe ECB also continued to develop itsrelations with central banks of thoseEuropean countries outside the EU which are
not at present negotiating EU accession, andcentral banks of key emerging markets in Asiaand Latin America. The President and theChart 29Co-operation between the Eurosystem and the central banks of accession countries

delegations from their central banks.Furthermore, working relations at management/expert level have been established with a
number of central banks in these regions. Issues
frequently discussed at meetings are theeconomic situation, exchange rate policies and

the role of the euro in the country in question.
Among neighbouring countries, contacts withthe central banks of the Balkan countries,Russia and Turkey (a candidate country whichis not yet negotiating EU accession) have
played an important role. In the intensivebilateral discussions, the introduction of eurobanknotes and coins figured prominently,
given the widespread circulation of nationalbanknotes issued by the euro area NCBs inthese countries. In the Balkans, the ECB took
part in activities organised by the WorkingTable on Economic Reconstruction,Development and Co-operation within the
framework of the Stability Pact for South
Eastern Europe. The ECB closely followedeconomic and financial developments in
Turkey and established a more regular policydialogue with its central bank on the occasion
of the Turkish Governor™s visit to the ECB.The ECB also started to strengthen workingrelations with central banks in theMediterranean region.Chapter VIThe cash changeoverand the production and issueof euro banknotes
1141Changeover to the euro banknotes and coins in 2002
In order to ensure a smooth changeover to
the euro banknotes and coins, a Eurosystem
Cash Changeover Co-ordination Committee(CashCo) was established in March 2001,
comprising representatives from the ECB andone representative from each of the national
central banks (NCBs) of the 12 participating
Member States. The European Commissionand Europol had observer status at CashCo
meetings. Within the field of competence
of the Eurosystem, the Committee boreoverall responsibility for co-ordinating theintroduction of the euro banknotes and coins
and withdrawing the legacy currencies in theperiod up to the end of February 2002. Itmonitored the preparatory work relating
to the issuance of, and changeover to, theeuro banknotes and coins and established
a Eurosystem-wide information exchange
framework for the period prior to and
following 1 January 2002.1.1The changeover inside the euro area
The Governing Council of the ECB agreedon certain Eurosystem-related provisions onthe 2002 cash changeover in an ECB
Guideline of 10 January 2001. In accordancewith these provisions, frontloading byNCBs to credit institutions and sub-

frontloading of banknotes and coins toprofessional target groups was allowed asfrom 1 September 2001. This four-month
lead time was required in order to ensurethat sufficient euro banknotes and coinswere available for widespread circulation
from 1 January 2002. The lead time permittedefficient transportation and logistics. In fact,the scale and timing of frontloading and
sub-frontloading varied considerably fromone country to another, depending on the
national changeover scenario, the national
infrastructure (e.g. the structure of thecentral bank branch network and its role inthe currency supply, the storage facilities
available in bank branches, etc.) as well as thesize and geography of the country concerned.In 11 countries the national authoritiesprovided euro coins to credit institutions asfrom September 2001 because their bulk
made them more difficult to transport than
banknotes and their lower value meant thatthe risk to credit institutions was lower
than for banknotes; in one country the
frontloading of coins did not begin until
December 2001. Five countries began
frontloading banknotes in September 2001;

the remaining seven countries postponedthe distribution of banknotes until October,November or December 2001.All 12 countries supplied credit institutionsand retailers with both euro banknotes and
coins prior to 1 January 2002. Moreover, allcountries sub-frontloaded euro coins to thecash-operated machine industry in order that
it could load machines with coins prior to-day. In total, euro banknotes to a valueof 133 billion were frontloaded to credit
institutions, an amount corresponding toaround 50% of the national banknotes incirculation at the end of 2001. As for coins, a
total of 37.5 billion, worth 12.4 billion,were frontloaded by the end of 2001. Thismeant that, in terms of volume, around
80% of the banknotes and over 97% of the
coins needed had been distributed to banksbefore 1 January 2002, which paved the way
for a smooth changeover. Broadly speaking,sub-frontloading to professional target groupswas also in line with initial forecasts and
represented an overall amount of between10% and 20% of the frontloaded amount.According to the ECOFIN Council statementof November 1999, euro coins could beprovided to the general public from mid-

December 2001 in order to help people
to become familiar with them and to reducethe stocks needed by retailers to provide

change at the beginning of 2002. All euroarea countries offered the public starter kits,and the demand for these was great. In a
number of countries, the level of demandwas such that banks were authorised to makeup their own kits and even to sell some of115
their bulk stocks. The countervalue of thestarter kits ranged from 3.88 to 15.25and in most cases corresponded to a national
banknote denomination in order to facilitatethe exchange. In one country, a small starterkit was also provided to each citizen free
of charge. Distribution through a wide rangeof outlets started in three countries on
14 December 2002 and in the others on
15 or 17 December 2001. Overall, the generalpublic acquired more than 150 million starterkits comprising over 4.2 billion coins worth
1.6 billion. This means that, on average,
each member of the public had 14 coins atthe beginning of 2002.In addition, retailers were supplied with retailstarter kits with countervalues ranging from
30.41 to 315.Given that, in terms of transactions, most ofthe banknotes enter circulation via automatedteller machines (ATMs), the quick adaptation
of these machines was a key factor in the
changeover. In total, more than 200,000ATMs in bank branches and elsewhere(e.g. in shopping centres) had to be
converted. The speed at which the ATMswere converted varied slightly from countryto country depending on factors such as
conversion capacity, location, number andtype of ATMs. In addition, the policy withregard to ATMs which had not yet been
converted by the time the euro banknotesand coins entered circulation varied slightlyacross the euro area. In six countries they
were removed from service, whereas in fourcountries they continued dispensing nationalbanknotes. Four days after the entry into
circulation of the euro banknotes and coins,virtually all ATMs were issuing only euro.As a result, an average of 75% of cash

transactions were taking place in euro by theend of the first week, and this figure was wellover 90% by the end of the second week.
Naturally, this figure varied from country tocountry and from sector to sector. In anycase, euro banknotes and coins were
introduced considerably faster than originally
foreseen.To achieve a smooth changeover, it was also
essential to put the low-denomination eurobanknotes (i.e. 5, 10 and 20) intocirculation on a large scale at the beginningof 2002. This considerably reduced the needfor retailers to hold large amounts of cash
during the first few days of 2002. In all euroarea countries one, two or three of the
low-denomination euro banknotes were
dispensed by ATMs at the start of 2002. Incountries where welfare payments are made
largely in cash, these transactions were
effected in low denominations. Moreover,banks frequently paid out low-denominationeuro banknotes over the counter. As a result,low-denomination ba
nknotes (i.e. 
5, 10 and20) accounted for 82.4% of the totalnumber of banknotes in circulation in early

2002 and for 43% of the circulation value.
This far exceeded the proportion of nationalbanknotes with a similar countervalue prior
to the changeover.As for the withdrawal of national coins,
most national authorities encouraged thepublic to deposit hoarded coins at banksbefore the turn of the year in order to
reduce the workload of banks, retailers and
cash-in-transit companies during the dualcirculation period; in addition, coins were
collected through a range of charity schemeswhich had been introduced in some countries.At the same time, there was a considerable
influx of hoarded national banknotes,particularly in high denominations. In total,national banknotes in circulation fell by
110 billion during the course of 2001 to270 billion at the end of the year.In conclusion, the changeover was anunprecedented undertaking, directly affectingthe lives of over 300 million people in
the 12 euro area countries. The financialinstitutions, cash-in-transit companies, the
security forces, retailers and the cash-
operated machine industry needed to be
closely involved in the preparations at an
early stage, as a smooth changeover could
only be achieved in a short period of timethrough systematic and co-ordinatedinteraction between all the leading players.
116However, the success of the euro cash
changeover ultimately depended not only onthe co-operation of all the professional

parties directly involved, but also on thepositive attitude of and swift acceptance bythe public. In retrospect, it can be said that,
given the scale of the task, the introductionof euro banknotes and coins went verysmoothly and successfully.1.2The changeover outside the euro
areaA significant number of banknotes issued bythe NCBs of euro area countries werecirculating outside the euro area, especiallyin the accession countries and other
neighbouring countries. For example, it wasestimated in a study relating to the mid-1990sthat around 30% to 40% of Deutsche Mark

banknotes in circulation were held outsideGermany, with the majority probably held in
eastern and south-eastern Europe (including
Turkey). Every effort was therefore madeto ensure that the cash changeover outsidethe euro area also proceeded smoothly. The
framework for the changeover outside theeuro area was built upon three pillars:In accordance with the ECB Guideline of
10 January 2001 stipulating certainprovisions on the 2002 cash changeover,
banks were allowed, under strict
conditions, to distribute frontloaded eurobanknotes to their branches and
headquarters located outside the euro area
as from 1 December 2001. In addition, theGuideline allowed frontloaded banks, from
the same date, to sub-frontload to theirsubsidiaries outside the euro area, as wellas to other banks with registered and/or

head offices and branch networks outsidethe euro area. However, sub-frontloadingto retailers was not allowed outside the
euro area.The Governing Council decided in an ECB
Guideline of 13 September 2001 on certainprovisions on frontloading outside the euroarea, that central banks and monetaryauthorities of non-participating MemberStates and other countries couldbe frontloaded upon request as from
1 December 2001, subject to specificterms and conditions. All operationaland practical arrangements for such
frontloading were taken care of bilaterallyby the euro area NCB concerned and thecounterparty central bank. Central banks
outside the euro area were allowed tosub-frontload credit institutions havingtheir registered and/or head office in
their respective jurisdictions as from1 December 2001, in accordance with
certain rules.
The Governing Council decided that non-
euro area credit institutions operating in
the worldwide wholesale banknote marketcould be frontloaded by NCBs and wereallowed to sub-frontload euro banknotes
to their customer banks outside the euroarea from 1 December 2001. The detailed
terms and conditions, which were in

principle the same as those imposed onforeign central banks, were also laid downin the ECB Guideline of 13 September
2001.The introduction of the euro banknotesalso proceeded smoothly outside the euro
area. 26 central banks located outside theeuro area, mainly in central and eastern
Europe, the Mediterranean area and in Africa,were frontloaded. The total amount of euro
banknotes provided to central banks and

banks outside the euro area was some4.6 billion.
1.3Exchange of national banknotes at
national central banksThe substitutability of national currency unitsbetween 1999 and 2002 is ensured by Article
52 of the Statute of the ESCB, which governsthe exchange of banknotes denominated inthe national currencies of the countries
participating in the euro area. Since 1 January1999, in accordance with a decision of theGoverning Council, each participating NCB
117
2Production of euro banknotes and coins
2.1Production of banknote
requirements for the launchEach NCB was responsible for procuring eurobanknotes to meet its national requirementsfor the launch. Estimates of the volumes
needed by the NCBs were reviewed annuallyand most recently in late 2001 in order totake account of the actual demand during the

frontloading phase. Estimates as at end-2001amounted to some 15 billion banknotes, witha total face value of 
around 633 billion.15 printing works were involved in theproduction of the banknotes.Throughout the year, production progresswas carefully monitored by the ECB in termsof both quantity and quality. During this

period, the visual appearance of thebanknotes was also regularly sampled. TheECB continued to audit the Quality
Management Systems operating in the printingworks and thus helped to ensure consistentquality. The manufacturers of cash handling
machines, who have a special interest inthe quality and consistency of eurobanknotes, were involved in an extensive

testing programme to help them adjusttheir sensors and machines in time for thelaunch.2.2Production of a Central Reserve
Stock of banknotes to cover risksA Central Reserve Stock of euro banknoteswas established by the ECB as part of its
euro launch risk management. The risks to
be covered included production quantity orquality shortfalls due to unforeseencircumstances and a higher-than-expected
demand for some euro denominations.Approximately 10% over and above thelaunch volume of 15 billion banknotes was
produced for the Central Reserve Stock. TheECB was responsible for the procurement ofthese banknotes, which were produced in
accordance with the same demandingstandards as all other euro banknotes.Some banknotes from this stock were usedto meet additional commercial bankrequirements during frontloading and helped
the launch phase to go smoothly.
2.3Support for the production of euro
coinsThe Member States are responsible for theproduction of euro coins. National estimatesof the total volume needed for the launch
amounted to more than 51 billion coins with
a face value of around 16 billion. Production
involved 16 mints in 12 countries.
or its authorised agent has been offering, atone location at least, to exchange thebanknotes of other participating countries at

the official conversion rate free of bank
charges. The Governing Council decided toextend the Article 52 arrangement beyond
2001 until the end of March 2002.Against this background, some 500 NCBbranches throughout the euro area wereinvolved in the exchange of nationalbanknotes of other euro area countries. From
a practical point of view, the exchange withinthe framework of Article 52 ran smoothly inall the participating Member States from 1999onwards.In addition, the NCBs may repatriate thenational banknotes of other participatingcountries, appoint an agent to perform this
repatriation service on their behalf or use
existing commercial repatriation channels.The value of banknotes repatriated to their
respective issuing country under thisarrangement between 1999 and the end of2001 was 14.4 billion; the number of
banknotes repatriated was 293.4 million.
118The ECB acted as an independent assessor ofeuro coin quality. It assisted in theimplementation and maintenance of a

common quality management system in allmints. The performance of each mint waschecked by conducting regular quality audits.The quality of the coins was assessed on thebasis of both monthly quality reports by themints and the ECB™s own measurements ofreference coins. The decision-making bodieswere given regular updates on the quality ofeuro coins.3Protection of euro banknotes against counterfeiting
3.1Research and development
Research and development work aims to buildtechnological ﬁfoundationsﬂ upon which the
further development of the first banknote
series will be based.These activities are decentralised but areco-ordinated by the ECB. They are on theincrease as the focus moves towards thepost-launch period. The co-ordination of the
research and development efforts of theNCBs, expert suppliers and the ECB wasreviewed and improved in 2001 and further
continuous improvement of the structure isexpected in 2002.The ECB is a member of various internationalcentral bank anti-counterfeit technical groupswhich are pursuing global initiatives.3.2Anti-counterfeiting activities
The European network of National AnalysisCentres (NACs) was set up. The NACs are

responsible for counterfeit analysis at anational level and for the transfer of data oncounterfeit euro banknotes to the central
database being established at the ECB. Thestaff of these centres have received trainingin the classification of counterfeit euro
banknotes.The Counterfeit Analysis Centre (CAC) at theECB has been operating since the beginning of2002. It is responsible for classifying the neweuro counterfeits received from the NACs. Its
staff, comprising counterfeit experts, technicalspecialists and administrative personnel, havebeen recruited and its equipment has been
procured. The CAC now has the resources itneeds to analyse counterfeits and to distinguishbetween counterfeit and genuine banknotes.Progress towards establishing the CounterfeitMonitoring System (CMS), including a
database that will store all the technical and
statistical data on counterfeit euro banknotesand coins, has been slower than expected on
account of technical difficulties. Accordingly,some of the functions of the system are not
yet available. In the interim, other procedures
have been established to ensure an efficientuse of the information which is being storedin the database.The most important provisions in relation tothe CMS are laid down in the Decision of the
European Central Bank of 8 November 2001on certain conditions regarding access to theCounterfeit Monitoring System (CMS).A co-operation agreement has beenconcluded between the ECB and the
European Police Office (Europol) onmeasures to combat threats arising fromeuro counterfeiting and to enhance and

co-ordinate assistance in this area provided
by either party to the national andEuropean authorities and to international
organisations.119
4Issue of euro banknotes
The Governing Council of the ECB hasdecided that the ECB and the 12 NCBs  of
the euro area shall issue euro banknotes.It was agreed that, while 92% of eurobanknotes would be issued by the 12 NCBs,
the remaining share would be issued by the
ECB as from the beginning of 2002. EachNCB will show in its balance sheet a share ofthe euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB™s capital. Thetotal banknote issue of the Eurosystem willbe shown in its consolidated weekly financialstatement, as published by the ECB.In accordance with the principle ofdecentralisation for the execution ofEurosystem operations, the 12 NCBs of the

euro area will put into and withdraw fromcirculation, and will physically process, alleuro banknotes, including those issued by the
ECB.5The Euro 2002 Information Campaign
As part of the preparations for the
introduction of the euro banknotes and coins,the ECB and the 12 NCBs of the euro areahave been conducting a ﬁEuro 2002Information Campaignﬂ. The GoverningCouncil approved a campaign budget of80 million, and this was reinforced by
additional funds made available by NCBs.The Eurosystem™s campaign has been closelyco-ordinated with similar initiativesundertaken by national authorities and theEuropean Commission, and focused on the
following key messages:the appearance of the banknotes and coins;
the security features of the banknotes;
the denominations; andthe overall changeover modalities.Three principle channels have been used todeliver these messages: a mass media campaign,
public relations and press activities, and co-
operation with other groups active in this area(the Partnership Programme). All el
ements ofthe campaign have been supported by adedicated website, www.euro.ecb.int, which,as with all campaign materials, is in the 11
official languages of the European Community.As 2001 progressed and public interest in theeuro banknotes and coins grew, so thecampaign became more high-profile. Theunveiling of the security features to thegeneral public on 30 August 2001 saw thecampaign enter a new phase, with newmaterials made available, incorporating,
inter alia, the final visual appearance of the
euro banknotes and their security features.
The mass media campaignThe mass media campaign was also launched on30 August 2001. It comprised TV spots andprint adverts which were run both nationallyand internationally across the euro area. In some
cases these efforts were complemented byadditional mass media activities by NCBs.National audiences were addressed in theirrespective languages via five TV spots andeight complementary print adverts, which
were identical in all the euro area countries.They provided both general and detailed
information on the banknotes and coins as
well as on the security features of thebanknotes. The spots were shown on 50 TVstations and the print adverts appeared in
over 250 publications. The campaign came toan end with a final print burst throughout theeuro area in late January/early February 2002.At a global level, the campaign was aimed at
international business executives and visitors
to the euro area. Six international TV stationsbroadcast specially adapted versions of theTV spots, and nine international publications
120and 14 in-flight magazines featured the printadverts. In addition to this, an airportcampaign in 12 euro area airports, plus
London Heathrow, ensured that visitors ontheir way to the euro area were exposed tothe core messages of the campaign.Some 200 million copies of a publicinformation leaflet, Getting ready for theeuro Œ Your guide to the euro banknotes andcoins, containing authoritative information on
the euro banknotes and coins, were produced
to support the mass media campaign. For theeuro area alone, 26 versions of the leafletwere needed to cover the official languages
and changeover modalities of each country.Distribution throughout the euro area tookplace to almost every household between
October and December 2001, using variouschannels, but mostly national postal systemsor door-to-door delivery. In order to make
the information contained in the leafletavailable to people outside the euro area, an
international version was translated into

23 other languages and made available topartners via the campaign™s website.Moreover, some NCBs reinforced this effort
by printing and distributing the leaflets inseveral languages in addition to the official
Community languages.PR and press activitiesThe public relations and press programmefor the Euro 2002 Information Campaign
comprised three main activities throughout2001: an editorial countdown calendar, Euro2002 Information Campaign conferences and
the children™s competition.Under the editorial countdown calendar, mediakits were sent to over 4,500 media contacts onsix key dates falling on and between -365 and-day itself. Each kit provided comprehensiveinformation on the euro banknotes and coinsand changeover data, and in some cases the kits
contained additional materials, such as video
tapes and images, to ensure that campaignmessages could be passed on to the public via
the media.A series of 11 Euro 2002 InformationCampaign conferences, hosted by the NCBsof the euro area in their respective countries,
brought together over 5,000 key players prior
to the cash changeover. As well as providinga forum for discussion on changeover issues,
each conference generated media coverageensuring, once more, that campaign messageswere spread further afield.Children were identified as a key target groupfor the Euro 2002 Information Campaign, with
the result that a specific project was createdto inform and engage them. For the Be a EuroSuperStar competition, over 7 million posters
containing information on the euro banknotesand coins were distributed to primary schoolsacross the euro area. The poster, together
with the children
™s zone on the ECB™seuro website, featured a multiple-choicecompetition which was open to children
between the ages of eight and twelve.Some 300,000 children entered thecompetition and the 24 winners 
Œ two from
each euro area country Œ were invited to
Frankfurt to receive their prizes, a full set ofeuro banknotes in a specially designed
commemorative case and a laptop computer,from the President of the ECB at a mediaevent on 31 December.
The end-of-year event, like the earlier launchof the campaign slogan ﬁthe EURO. OUR
moneyﬂ on 1 March 2001 and both the
unveiling of the final visual appearance ofthe euro banknotes and the launch of the
mass media campaign on 30 August, attracteda large number of media representatives andgenerated positive press and TV coverage.Partnership ProgrammeThe overall aim of the PartnershipProgramme was to encourage those private
and public sector organisations interested inmaking information on the euro banknotesand coins available to their customers and
staff to join the programme and benefit fromthe materials provided by the campaign. Bythe end of the year, the Eurosystem had over121
3,000 national, European and internationalpartners. The greatest demand for materials,which could be adapted and co-branded to
suit partners™ needs, came after the unveiling
of the final visual appearance of the eurobanknotes and their security features on

30 August. Several million posters and leaflets
were produced by the Eurosystem and itspartners, in addition to master copies which
were available from the campaign™s website.Training materials for professional cashhandlers were also distributed via the
Partnership Programme and NCBs. 230,000training kits were produced, each containing
a training brochure with in-depth descriptions
and pictures of the coins, banknotes and theirsecurity features, a training video and aCD-ROM, which included an interactive
presentation. In addition, over 6 million
brochures for trainees were distributed,
containing information on the main security
features. This material was used as part of anextensive regime of training courses,
organised nationally by the NCBs and alsooutside the euro area, for experts who, inturn, trained thousands of cash handlers in
various fields, including the financial and retail
sectors.Although most visible in the run-up to -day,the campaign continued to run into the earlypart of 2002. The website will remain online

for some time before eventually beingtransferred to the ECB™s permanent website.Chapter VIIPayment and securitiessettlement systems
124The Eurosystem carries out its task of promoting the smooth operation of payment andsettlement systems through the provision of payment and securities settlement facilities, aswell as by overseeing the euro payment and settlement systems and acting as a catalyst for
change. First, the Eurosystem is involved operationally by running a real-time gross settlementsystem for large-value payments in euro, the Trans-European Automated Real-time Grosssettlement Express Transfer (TARGET) system, and by providing a mechanism for the cross-
border use of collateral (the correspondent central banking model, or CCBM). Second, theEurosystem sets standards aimed at ensuring the soundness and efficiency of systems handling
euro transactions and assesses the continuous compliance of euro payment and settlement
systems with these standards. Third, the Eurosystem acts as a catalyst for change by promoting
efficiency in payment systems and the adaptation of the payment and settlement infrastructureto the needs of the single currency area.1Operations of the Eurosystem
™s payment and settlement systems1.1The TARGET system
In 2001, TARGET processed, in terms ofvalue, almost 75% of the total turnover of
large-value payments in euro. TARGET had
1,569 direct participants, while the numberof indirect participants amounted to morethan 5,000.TARGET continued to fulfil the objectivesfor which it was conceived, namely to serve
the needs of the ECB
™s monetary policy, toincrease the efficiency of cross-border
payments in euro, and to provide a reliable
and safe mechanism for the settlement of
payments.On 19 November 2001 the TARGET 2001
upgrade went live successfully. The upgraded
software included only minor modifications
to the data format of payment messages usedin TARGET. In the United Kingdom,NewChaps was introduced at end-August
2001, providing a common IT platform forsterling and euro RTGS participants.Furthermore, on 5 November 2001 the
Deutsche Bundesbank successfully launchedits RTGSplus system, which now constitutes
the new German component of TARGET.
Upon the introduction of RTGS
plus, as a steptowards consolidating the large-valuepayment systems infrastructure within the

euro area, the hybrid system Euro Access
Frankfurt (EAF) was shut down. Furthermore,the Danish TARGET component was replaced
by a new system: KRONOS commencedoperations on 19 November 2001.TARGET operations in 2001
In 2001 a daily average of 211,282 payments
were processed by TARGET as a whole
(i.e. both cross-border and domesticpayments), with a total value of 1,299billion. This represents an increase of 12% in

terms of the number of payments and of 26%in terms of value.Volume20002001Change, %

Table 15Peak traffic in TARGET in 2001In terms of value, TARGET cross-bordertraffic in 2001 represented 39.0% of totalTARGET traffic, compared with 41.8% in
2000. In terms of volume, it represented21.4% of total TARGET traffic, compared with21.2% in 2000. Of cross-border TARGET

payments, 96.5% in terms of value and 60.8%in terms of volume were interbanktransactions, with the remainder being

customer payments. The average value of across-border interbank payment was 17.7million and the average value of a cross-

border customer payment was 1 million.Information on peak traffic days in terms ofvolume and value is provided in Table 15.Generally, TARGET participants submit theirpayments early on in the day. By 1 p.m. morethan 50% of cross-border turnover, and
almost 75% in terms of volume, has alreadybeen settled in TARGET (see Chart 30). Thiscontributes substantially to the smooth
functioning of the system and to the reductionof the risk of gridlocks in the event of liquiditystrains late in the day.Further statistics can be found on the ECB™swebsite at www.ecb.int by clicking on

126are being reviewed with the aim of furtherimproving their effectiveness and facilitatingthe orderly settlement of time-critical
payments, mainly related to the forthcoming
start of operations of CLS Bank.Relations with TARGET usersIn 2001 the ECB and the NCBs maintained anongoing dialogue with TARGET users. Regularmeetings of the national TARGET user groups
were held. Two meetings of the ContactGroup on Euro Payments Strategy (COGEPS)were also held at the ECB that year. This
group brings together representatives of theEurosystem and market participants. Its aimis to facilitate dialogue on several topics,

including TARGET-related issues. In 2001 thisensured that the NCBs and the ECB werebetter able to respond to participants™business needs.Other issuesIn 2001 TARGET was closed on New Year™sDay, Good Friday, Easter Monday, 1 May(Labour Day), Christmas Day and26 December, as well as on Saturdays and
Sundays. In addition, the system wasclosed on 31 December 2001 in order tosafeguard the smooth conversion of retail

payment systems and internal bank systemsto the euro. As from 1 January 2002, thelong-term TARGET calendar will apply
(see also ﬁGeneral informationﬂ in the
TARGET section of the ECB™s website).In line with the policy of transparency, on26 April 2001 the ECB published GuidelineECB/2001/3 on TARGET. This document,
which represents the core of the legal
framework of TARGET, is available onthe ECB™s website as well as in the OfficialJournal of the European Communities,L 140, 24 May 2001 (see 
ﬁLegal documentsﬂin the ﬁPublicationsﬂ section of the ECB
™swebsite).In May 2001, the first ﬁTARGET AnnualReportﬂ was published by the ECB. It covers
operations in both 1999 and 2000, and
includes the business and technicalperformance of TARGET, together with adescription of major developments and future
prospects.1.2The correspondent central banking
model (CCBM)The CCBM was designed in the preparatory
stages of Monetary Union to enable the cross-border use of collateral by participants in
monetary policy and intraday creditoperations. It was conceived as an interimsolution until such time as the market
developed alternatives.In 2001 the CCBM remained the main toolfor the cross-border transfer of collateral tothe Eurosystem. The amount of collateral
under custody through the CCBM increased
from 124 billion at the end of 2000 to157 billion at the end of 2001. The linkarrangements between securities settlement
systems (SSSs) for the transfer of securitiescurrently constitute the only alternative tothe CCBM. Although more than 60 links
between SSSs have been established and areeligible for Eurosystem operations, their use
has not been extensive. Chart 31 presents
the developments in cross-border collateral
through the CCBM and the links as apercentage of the total collateral provided to
the Eurosystem.In a survey organised by the Eurosystem,1market participants referred mainly to twofactors to explain the limited use of links.First, the counterparty needs to transfer to

the domestic SSS the part of its holdings tobe used for central bank operations, thusmoving them from their usual settlement
environment. Second, market participants

takes place within the industry.2General issues of payment systems oversight
In February 2001, the Governing Council of
the ECB adopted the Core Principles forSystemically Important Payment Systems(Core Principles) in the set of minimum
standards which the Eurosystem uses for itscommon oversight policy on paymentsystems. The Core Principles were elaborated
by the G10 Committee on Payment andSettlement Systems (CPSS) in order to  help
maintain financial stability by strengthening
the financial infrastructure. They compriseprinciples, good practices and guidelineswhich should govern the design and operation
of payment systems and suggest the keycharacteristics which all systemicallyimportant payment systems should satisfy. In
view of its statutory task to promote thesmooth operation of payment systems, theEurosystem will assess all systemically
important payment systems in the euro areaagainst the Core Principles by the end of2002.In 2001, at the request of the ECB, the IMFprepared Reports on the Observance ofStandards and Codes (ROSCs) for theeuro area in the context of its Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). Theparticipation of the ECB in the preparation ofthese ROSCs reflects its commitment to meet
international standards and codes and to
ﬁlead by exampleﬂ in their implementation.
This is based on the conviction that
compliance with internationally agreedstandards and best practices is key tostrengthening the global financial system and

to ensuring financial stability.In the field of payment systems, theassessments by the IMF covered transparencyin payment systems policy and compliancewith the Core Principles of the two
systemically important payment systemswith an EU-wide reach, namely TARGETand the Euro 1 system of the Euro Banking
128Association (EBA).2 The IMF acknowledged
that the Eurosystem maintains a high level oftransparency in payment systems policy. The
IMF recognised that TARGET has successfullyfulfilled the policy goals for which it was setup and largely meets the needs of the market.

TARGET complies fully with six of the CorePrinciples and broadly or partly meets therequirements of three further Core2The IMF published the assessments in October 2001; they are
available on the IMF™s website (http://www.imf.org).3ﬁReport of the Committee on Interbank Netting Schemes of the
Central Banks of the Group of Ten Countriesﬂ, BIS, November
1990.Principles. One of the Core Principles is notapplicable to TARGET. The Eurosystem isnow focusing on further enhancements of the
compliance of TARGET with those CorePrinciples which have not yet been met in full(for further details, see Box 9 in Chapter V).
The Euro 1 system, which is overseen by theECB, was found to be fully compliant with allCore Principles.3Large-value payment systems
3.1Developments in other large-value
payment systems in euroIn 2001 the five large-value net settlementsystems in euro continued to operate
smoothly. They are the Euro 1 system of the
EBA, Euro Access Frankfurt (EAF) inGermany, Paris Net Settlement (PNS) in
France, the Servicio de Pagos Interbancarios
(SPI) in Spain and the Pankkien On-line
Pikasiirrot ja Sekit-järjestelmä (POPS) in
Finland. Upon the introduction of RTGSplus,the new German TARGET component, on5 November 2001, the EAF system ceased
to exist.These large-value systems in euro have
proven to be suitable alternatives to TARGETfor the processing of certain types ofpayments. In 2001, the largest of the systems,
Euro 1, processed some 113,000 transactionsper day with an average daily value of205 billion. Taken together, the five systemsprocessed approximately the same volume ofpayments as the TARGET system, but onlyabout one-third of the value of the TARGET
system, because, apart from monetary policyrelated payments, time-critical, very large-value payments in connection with money

market operations are usually routed throughTARGET.Although interbank payments in 2001
accounted for more than 80% of the valueprocessed by the five large-value systems, the
share of low-value customer payments rosein all systems. More than half of the payments
processed in volume terms were customerpayments, typically with a value of below50,000. This development can be explainedby a shift from correspondent bankingchannels towards payment systems and isconsistent with a heightened need for efficient
cross-border retail payments within the euroarea.3.2Continuous Linked Settlement
(CLS)CLS is a system designed to settle foreignexchange transactions on a payment-versus-
payment basis on the books of CLS Bank, aprivate bank incorporated in New York. CLSis a private sector solution to the central

banks™ demands for risk reduction in foreign
exchange settlement. After some delays inthe system™s development, CLS Bank isscheduled to start operations with seven
currencies from mid-2002.As foreseen by the framework for co-operative oversight established by theLamfalussy report3, the Federal ReserveSystem has the lead oversight responsibilityfor the CLS system and has involved thecentral banks of the other prospective eligible
currencies in the system design. The Bank ofEngland will be the designating authorityunder Directive 98/26/EC of the European
129
Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 1998on settlement finality in payment and
securities settlement systems. Since the euro
will be one of the currencies to be settledin the system from the outset, theEurosystem has followed the development of
the system closely and liaised with CLS Bankand with the other central banks involvedin the co-operative oversight of the system.

In addition, representatives of the Eurosystemmet twice during 2001 with the euro areashareholders of CLS to discuss liquiditymanagement and operational issues. The
ESCB, together with commercial banks, hasdrawn up recommendations for CLS

payments in euro. These recommendations,which can be downloaded from on the
ECB™s website (www.ecb.int), emphasise thatbanks should prepare their payments to CLSBank as soon as possible in the morning inorder to allow time to deal with contingency

situations, and that CLS payments should begiven the highest priority.4Retail payment systems
4.1Final changeover of retail payment
systems to the euroDuring 2001, the Eurosystem monitored the
preparedness of retail payment systems for

operations in euro from the start of 2002.
This showed that the cash changeover wasnot expected to represent a major issue for

retail payment systems and cashless payment
instruments. However, some issues remained
in relation to the preparation of automated
teller machines (ATMs) and point of sale
(POS) terminals in a few countries. Theseissues were successfully addressed before the
final changeover. For more information onthe euro cash changeover see Chapter VI.4.2Developments in the area of
cross-border retail servicesIn pursuing its objective to create a singlepayment area for the euro, the Eurosystem
continued in 2001 to act as a catalyst forimprovements in the area of cross-borderretail payment services, so that such services
would eventually be provided as safely,cheaply and efficiently as domestic services.
The ECB reaffirmed the policy stance of its
1999 report entitled ﬁImproving cross-borderretail payment services in the euro area Œ the
Eurosystem™s viewﬂ in an article in the
February 2001 issue of the ECB MonthlyBulletin entitled ﬁTowards a uniform servicelevel for retail payments in the euro areaﬂ. Itorganised various meetings and collaborated
intensively with banks, payment systems
operators and the European Credit SectorAssociations to help the industry fulfilthe objectives set out in the 1999 report
by 2002. In the report ﬁTowards anintegrated infrastructure for credit transfersin euroﬂ, published in November 2001,the Eurosystem reviewed ways to remove
the remaining obstacles identified asthose incurring high costs for cross-border
credit transfers. It proposed differenttechnical options which banks could chooseto implement in order to establish an efficient
interbank infrastructure for cross-borderretail credit transfers. The report suggestsa ﬁroad mapﬂ to which banks should commit
in order to be able to decrease the pricesof cross-border payments to the level of
prices of domestic payments by the end of
2004.The fact that charges for cross-border retailcredit transfers have remained persistentlyhigh over the years prompted theEuropean Parliament and the Council
to adopt Regulation (EC) 2560/2001 of19 December 2001 on cross-border paymentsin euro. It obliges banks to reduce charges
for cross-border payments of up to 12,500(50,000 as of 1 January 2006) to thelevel of those for domestic payments. The

Regulation applies to card payments andATM withdrawals as from 1 July 2002 andto cross-border credit transfers as from
1301 July 2003. In October 2001, the ECB issuedan Opinion on the draft regulation, statingthat it shared the general objective of the
regulation but had reservations aboutpotential negative side effects of a regulation.4.3EBA initiatives
In November 2000 the EBA launched theSTEP 1 initiative (the acronym ﬁSTEPﬂ being
derived from ﬁStraight-Through EuroProcessingﬂ) for the processing of low-value
customer payments. The number of STEP 1banks increased from 21 when the service

was first launched to 65 at the end of 2001,and the volume and value of payments
processed by the system also tripled to more
than 7,100 payments per day for a totalaverage daily value of 79.3 million.In 2001 the EBA presented a draft scheme for apan-European interbank processing system forretail payments. The new system, called STEP 2,

further develops the STEP 1 service and is aresponse to the Eurosystem™s objective ofimproving cross-border retail services in the
euro area. STEP 2 will provide an automatedclearing service, which sorts the aggregatedpayment files of each sending participant into
separate files for the individual addressedparticipants. These payment files are settled viaa bank participating in the Euro 1 large-value

payment system. The EBA intends to implementthe STEP 2 system by December 2002.4.4Electronic money and investigations
in e-commerce and e-paymentsIn 2001 the Eurosystem extended itsattention to new developments in the area of
electronic payments (i.e. payments overthe internet), triggered by the expansionof e-commerce and other initiatives. The
Eurosystem started to analyse whether thetraditional roles of the central bank with
regard to payment systems and payment
instruments, i.e. the maintenance of systemicstability, the promotion of efficiency andsecurity and the safeguarding of the monetary
policy transmission mechanism, were affectedby these new developments and, if so, towhat extent. As the issue of trust (legal

certainty, security of transactions, etc.) is
essential to e-commerce, the Eurosystemstarted to analyse the ﬁtrust servicesﬂ related
to the open network environment, such aspossible applications of the Public KeyInfrastructure (PKI) within the payment
systems sector.The Eurosystem also continued to monitorthe developments of e-money schemes and
their implications for central banks. Inparticular, the different technical security
approaches for e-money schemes wereanalysed from an oversight perspective. It iscurrently being considered whether the ECB™sﬁReport on electronic moneyﬂ (1998) and,
more precisely, the third minimum requirementof that report concerning the technical security
of e-money schemes, could be developed inmore detail, with a view to establishing a
common technical security framework for
e-money schemes. Particular attention is beingpaid to market initiatives, which provide asecurity framework consisting of security
objectives and requirements, independent of the
underlying technology that is used.5Securities clearing and settlement systems
The Eurosystem has a general interest in thecorrect functioning of securities clearing and
settlement systems. Indeed, the inappropriatefunctioning of these systems might have animpact on two core responsibilities of centralbanks, namely ensuring the smooth
functioning of payment systems and theimplementation of monetary policy.131
4Consolidation may be achieved through various means, such as
interoperability, alliances, joint ventures and mergers.Moreover, some NCBs operate securitiessettlement systems (SSSs) or are explicitly incharge of the respective oversight.In principle, securities trades agreed by twoparties lead to the delivery of the securities
on the one hand and to the underlyingpayment on the other. These activities arecarried out by central institutions such as

SSSs. Obligations by 
participants in SSSs are
sometimes calculated 
beforehand by clearinghouses. Clearing houses that interpose
themselves as buyer to the seller and as sellerto the buyer are called central counterparties.Disruptions in SSSs may impede the smooth
functioning of financial markets and, with theimplementation of deli
very-versus-paymentmechanisms, are automatically transmitted to
the payment system. All Eurosystem credit
operations are collateralised, with theirexecution dependent on the timely delivery
of assets mainly transferred and settled bythese institutions.5.1Clearing
The Eurosystem has been carefully monitoring
and analysing the consolidation process incentral counterparty clearing because of the
possible implications for the smoothexecution of monetary policy operations, theeffective functioning of payment and
settlement systems and the stability of thefinancial markets in general. The consolidationprocess4 adds to the complexity of the issue:
on the one hand, consolidation in centralcounterparty clearing could help to increaseefficiency in the clearing and settlement of
securities; on the other hand, the potentialsystemic consequences of a centralcounterparty™s failure increase with its size.In this regard, a number of issues are relevant.
On 27 September 2001, the ECB released
the Eurosystem™s policy line with regard toconsolidation in central counterparty clearing,stating the following.First, it is essential that effective standards
for risk management be established forcentral counterparties.In addition, currency areas have traditionally
developed their own domestic infrastructuresin terms of payment systems, securities
settlement systems, stock exchanges, etc. Inthis regard, it is important to distinguishbetween ﬁdomesticﬂ central counterparties,
on the one hand, and ﬁinternationalﬂ central
counterparties, on the other. A ﬁdomesticﬂcentral counterparty mainly handles assets
denominated in one currency. The logicalgeographical scope for any marketinfrastructure handling mainly securities and
derivatives denominated in euro is the euro
area. Given the potential systemic importanceof securities clearing and settlement systems,
this ﬁdomesticﬂ infrastructure should be
located in the euro area. In addition, theexistence of a domestic infrastructure should
not prevent the emergence of ﬁinternationalﬂinfrastructures handling several currencies,including the euro, at the same time.
Moreover, consolidation in centralcounterparty clearing could not only facilitate
integration, but may also help to reduce thecost of clearing by making use of economies
of scale and network externalities. Unless

there are clear signs of market failure,the process of consolidation of central
counterparty clearing infrastructure should
be driven by the private sector, but publicauthorities can help by removing unfair and
unjustified barriers to integration and to
competition, such as legal difficulties and alack of standardisation.
Furthermore, the Eurosystem has an interestin the efficiency of market structures.Whatever the final architecture, it is crucial
that market participants have open and fairaccess to all systems along the 
ﬁvalue chainﬂ(i.e. trading, clearing and settlement).Finally, the Eurosystem supports co-operationin central counterparty clearing at a global
level and should be involved in monitoringglobal multi-currency systems handling euro.

1325.2Settlement
In 1998 the ECB adopted standards for SSSsand links between SSSs, which must be
met by those systems if they are to be used inESCB credit operations. The standards prevent
inappropriate risks from being assumedwhen conducting credit operations, ensuring acommon level of safety for securities settlement
related to the provision of collateral. SSSsand their links are assessed against the standardson a regular basis. On 3 July 2001, the Governing
Council approved five additional links betweenSSSs, thus bringing the total number of currentlyeligible links to 66. The new eligible links are
from SCLV (Spain) to Necigef (the Netherlands),Necigef to SCLV, Euroclear (Belgium) toCrest (the United Kingdom), Crest to Euroclear,
and Monte Titoli (Italy) to Clearstream(Luxembourg).Some SSSs are involved in cross-border
consolidation processes. Nonetheless, apartfrom the transfer in December 2000 to
Euroclear of the settlement functionpreviously carried out by the Central Bank ofIreland Securities Settlement Office, these
agreements have not yet resulted in areduction in the number of systems in Europe.5.3Co-operation with the Committee
of European Securities RegulatorsIn October 2001 the Governing Council andthe Committee of European SecuritiesRegulators agreed to work together on issues
of common interest in the field of securitiesclearing and settlement systems. Thisco-operation is aimed at establishing
standards and/or recommendations at theEuropean level. A common approach willcontribute to the creation of a level playing-
field for the providers of securities clearingand settlement services and help to overcomethe significant heterogeneity within the
legislative frameworks of European countries.The report entitled ﬁRecommendations forSecurities Settlement Systemsﬂ by the Joint
Task Force of the Committee on Paymentand Settlement Systems of the G10 central
banks (CPSS) and the InternationalOrganization of Securities Commissions(IOSCO), released in November 2001, covers

SSSs in both industrialised and developingcountries. It was regarded as a valid starting-
point for an assessment of the need to adopt
more precise recommendations at theEuropean level.6Co-operation with accession countries and other activities
6.1Co-operation with accession
countries.The Eurosystem continued to strengthen its
co-operation with accession countries in thefield of payment and settlement systems.

Further bilateral contacts, including thedelivery of speeches and presentations, andworking relationships with accession country
central banks were established andmaintained throughout the year. The ECBhosted a multilateral meeting, involving all
EU and accession country central banks. As afollow-up to this meeting, the ECB, in co-operation with EU and accession country
central banks, worked on producingcomprehensive documentation aimed atproviding guidance, in the field of paymentand settlement systems, on the accession
process.The ECB was involved in the organisation
of the Central and Eastern EuropeanCentral Securities Depositories Association
conference on securities settlement systemsin central and eastern European countries,which took place in Budapest in March 2001.
The conference was attended by officials fromcentral banks, securities regulators andcentral securities depositories.From 3 to 5 September 2001 the ECB held aseminar on payment systems for central
bankers from accession countries, othercountries of eastern Europe, theMediterranean region, central Asia and the
133
Middle East. The seminar providedparticipants with an overview of payment andsecurities settlement systems in the EU as
well as with information about the activitiesof the Eurosystem in these areas.
The ECB also co-operated closely withthe European Commission by participatingin working visits of accession country

delegations to the Commission. During such
visits, practical issues are discussedregarding the implementation of EC
Directives and Recommendations on paymentand settlement systems in accessioncountries™ national legislation.
Furthermore, work was initiated on thepreparation of an update of the 1999 report

entitled ﬁPayment systems in countries that
have applied for membership of the EuropeanUnionﬂ (the 
ﬁAccession Country Blue Bookﬂ).It is expected to be published in the secondhalf of 2002 and will provide an updateddescriptive guide to the payment and
securities clearing and settlement systemsoperating in accession countries, includingupdated statistical information.Further information on the ECB™s relationswith accession countries is provided in
Chapter V.6.2Other activities
On 7 February 2001 the ECB hosted aconference with the title 
ﬁHow to establish a
domestic retail payment infrastructure for theeuro areaﬂ. The objective of the conference
was to promote a strategic euro area view
for the development of retail payments. Itserved to create awareness among market
participants of their role in contributing to a
new retail payments infrastructure for thesingle payment area.In June 2001 the ECB released the third
edition of the publication 
ﬁPayment and
securities settlement systems in the EuropeanUnionﬂ, also known as the ﬁBlue Bookﬂ, withan updated description of the major payment
and securities settlement systems operatingin the Member States of the European Unionand updated statistics. The newly introduced
chapter on the euro area describes aspectsand features of payment and securities
settlement systems which are common or
relevant to the euro area as a whole. It alsodescribes the common EU legal andregulatory framework and focuses on the
roles of the ECB and the Eurosystem.Chapter VIIIFinancial stability andprudential supervision
1361Arrangements for financial stability and prudential supervision
The institutional arrangements for prudentialsupervision have recently been revised ordebated in a number of Member States. Insome cases, the proposals envisaged a
reduced role of central banks in prudentialsupervision, while increasing the scope
of responsibility of separate supervisory

agencies. Nevertheless, at present, in ten out
of twelve euro area countries, national centralbanks (NCBs) are either directly responsible

for prudential supervision or have closeinstitutional links with the separate
supervisory agency, or else are strongly
involved in the operational performance ofsupervisory tasks. The Eurosystem stronglysupports a continued, and even reinforced,

role of NCBs in prudential supervision. Thisposition, which was communicated to thepublic,1 is based on an assessment of the
main changes in the institutional frameworkand in financial markets prompted by the
introduction of the euro.Two of the main arguments in favour ofgranting supervisory responsibilities to an
agency outside the central bank lose most oftheir force in the institutional setting of StageThree of Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU). First, the alleged potential for conflictsof interest between supervisory andmonetary policy objectives is smaller in the

Eurosystem. The monetary jurisdiction Œ the
euro area Œ no longer coincides with the
supervisory one, i.e. national institutions
and markets. Thus, no conflict can emerge atthe national level, since NCBs no longer haveany independent control over money
creation. Second, the argument that assigningthe two functions to the same authoritywould create an excessive concentration of
power also loses ground in a setting in whichmonetary policy decisions reside with the
Governing Council of the ECB, beyond the
exclusive control of NCBs. By contrast, thearguments in favour of entrusting centralbanks with supervisory responsibilities have
strengthened. EMU has changed the natureand scope of systemic risk, increasing thelikelihood that disturbances originating in orchannelled through wholesale and capitalmarkets or market infrastructures will extendbeyond national borders. The contributionmade by the Eurosystem to monitoring and
controlling systemic risk on a euro area-widebasis will be greater if NCBs are morestrongly involved in prudential supervision. In
carrying out their prudential supervisoryfunctions, the NCBs would in turn benefitfrom their knowledge 
Œ which they have
acquired as components of the Eurosystem Œof area-wide developments both in moneyand securities markets and in market

infrastructures. In addition, the trend towardsinternationalisation and conglomeration offinancial activities raises important issues as

to the systemic concerns created by large
and complex multinational institutions.Hence, an institutional framework within
which the ECB has responsibilities formonetary policy and NCBs have extensivesupervisory involvement in domestic markets,
and where co-operation is reinforced at anarea-wide level, would seem appropriate inorder to tackle the changes triggered by the
introduction of the euro. These argumentsare also reflected in the Opinionsdelivered by the ECB, in accordance with
Article 105 (4) of the Treaty, on the draftlaws on the institutional structure for financialsupervision in Austria and in Germany. 2The debate on the adequacy of institutional
arrangements for financial stability is also
being conducted at the EU level. TheEconomic and Financial Committee (EFC)monitored the implementation of the
recommendations made in the ﬁReport onFinancial Stabilityﬂ issued in April 2000, which
called for an enhancement, through intensified
co-operation, of the operational functioningof the arrangements for financial stability. TheEFC also examined the issue of financial crisis
management, which was not specifically1See European Central Bank, ﬁThe role of central banks in
prudential supervisionﬂ, March 2001.2See the ﬁPublications Œ Legal documentsﬂ section of the ECB™s
website.137
addressed in the aforementioned report. Theoutcome of this work is the ﬁReport onFinancial Crisis Managementﬂ issued in April
2001. This report recognises that substantialprogress is being made by the supervisorycommittees and the national authorities in
the EU in implementing the recommendationsof the first report and urges those involvedto further improve the functioning of current
institutional arrangements. It also advocatescloser co-operation to ensure effective crisismanagement. In particular, the EFC report
recommends: (i) that major financialinstitutions and groups should be able to
produce accurate information on their
financial position at short notice, performingstress tests and adopting contingency plansto address specific crisis scenarios, which
should be shared regularly with the relevantsupervisors and central banks; (ii) the removalof any remaining legal impediment to the

timely exchange of information betweensupervisors, NCBs and other relevant
authorities; (iii) agreement on the co-ordinating supervisor for major financial
institutions, including conglomerates; (iv) thefurther development of memoranda ofunderstanding to deal with issues related to
crisis management, and prior agreement on
the procedures for information exchange incases of crisis; and (v) that the competition
authorities should maintain timely and robustprocedures for considering the competitiveimplications of crisis management measures.
The Eurosystem fully supports the assessment
put forward in the report and stronglyencourages a prompt implementation of its
recommendations. To this end, the BankingSupervision Committee (BSC) has workedin liaison with the Groupe de Contact
to develop an understanding between
supervisory authorities and central banks onco-operation and information sharing in crisis

situations.2Structure, performance and risks in the banking sector
The monitoring of developments in the
banking sector from an EU/euro area-wide
perspective Œ conducted by the BSC 
Œ was
further enhanced in the course of 2001, along
two main lines. First, a regular andcomprehensive analysis of major structural
developments in the banking industry was
initiated. This analysis Œ to be carried out
once a year Œ is expected to highlight relevant
developments of a structural nature requiring

the attention of, and policy responses from,central banks and supervisory agencies. Inthis context, the BSC has also continued to
examine a number of ad hoc issues, such as
bank-customer relationships in corporatefinancial services and developments in banks™liquidity profile and management. Second, theregular macro-prudential analysis of the
stability of the banking sector has been
further expanded in terms of methodologies
and thematic scope. Work has begun onmethodologies for assessing banks™ credit risk
exposures to various industrial sectors andfor conducting stress-test analyses. Amongthe topics considered, the determination ofbanks™ loan loss provisions over business
cycles is worth mentioning. The majorstructural banking developments and the mainfactors affecting the soundness of the banking
sector are outlined below.Structural developmentsA number of long-term trends continue toshape the banking sector.First, the banking consolidation processcontinued in most EU countries in 2001. In
the recent past, this process has increasingly
involved the largest banks, which have

reinforced their position in domestic marketsor have striven to achieve sufficient ﬁmassﬂto integrate wholesale and capital market
activities and compete on a euro area-widebasis in several areas (e.g. asset management,underwriting and trading). This is indicated in
Table 16, as the aggregated value of bankingmergers and the average size of thetransactions have increased substantially in
138the past few years. In the same period, therestructuring of small and medium-sized bankshas continued unabated in many countries.As a result, domestic banking concentrationhas further increased in most countries. In
the EU countries, the average share of thedomestic banking business controlled by the
five major banks (CR5) increased from
around 50% to 60% over the period from1990 to 2001. The increased involvement ofthe largest banks in the consolidation process
has accelerated the structural changes, withconcentration rising significantly since 1997.However, considerable differences continue
to exist between countries. Scandinaviancountries have CR5 figures of 70%-90%, whilein Germany, which has the most dispersed

banking system, the figure is around 20%.
Consolidation has also increased in the areaof investment banking. Major EU banks have
invested substantial amounts in this area overthe past few years in order to be able to
meet the surge in the demand for investment
banking services fostered by the expansion of
European capital markets. The increased
importance of investment banking is reflected
in EU banks™ income structure. In 2000, non-
interest income, for which investment bankingis one of the major sources, accounted for
52% of the total net income (compared withless than 30% in 1996). In this field,consolidation has been driven by the desireto gain global presence and to offer a wide
variety of services. The industry is becomingincreasingly polarised, as medium-sizedinvestment banks have had to choose
between becoming niche players, linking upwith other firms or withdrawing from the
sector. This trend has been reinforced by the
adverse business conditions resulting fromthe sharp stock market correction since the
second half of 2000. A significant slowdown
in primary capital market activity, especiallyin equity issuance, resulted in a substantialreduction in investment banking earnings in
the course of 2001.Second, the process of internationalisation isunfolding inside as well as outside the EU.This process appears to be linked toincreasing domestic competition and to more

favourable growth prospects in foreign
markets. Many banks have preferred toexpand to neighbouring countries or
countries that share a similar language andculture, thus developing ﬁregionalﬂ banking
activities. Greek banks, for example, have
expanded into the Balkans, Scandinavian banksinto the Nordic and Baltic regions, and
Spanish banks into Latin America. Central
and eastern Europe has been the target for1990-19971998-20011990-2001

Table 16Merger and acquisition activity involving EU banks139
banks from Austria, Belgium, France, theNetherlands and Italy. Within the EU alone,there have been several important cross-
border transactions, which have led to anincrease in the non-domestic component ofmany countries™ banking systems. Aggregateddata also show an increase in the relevanceof cross-border mergers and acquisitions(see Table 16).Third, financial conglomerates are establishedin many countries. This is highlighted by

the rather significant share of cross-industry
deals in the mergers and acquisitions involvingEU banks (see Table 16). The traditional form

of conglomeration involves the setting-up ofbank-insurance groups. This tendency hasalso been promoted by the reforms in
national pension systems, increasing theinvestment potential of pension funds and the
synergies involved in distributing different
financial products. Mere distributionagreements, usually making use of banks™branch networks, have represented an
alternative to ownership links. For banks, thisis a way of recovering some of the costs of
maintaining extensive branch networks.
Recently, banks have increasingly merged withsecurities firms in order to take advantage ofthe developing capital markets.Fourth, the blurring of the traditional bordersbetween banking, insurance and asset
management has resulted in increasinglyﬁhybridﬂ financial products, such as insurance
contracts with performance linked to that of
mutual fund units. As regards corporate
clients, banks have expanded beyond their
traditional roles as credit providers
into underwriting, advice and corporate
restructuring. Although ﬁrelationship bankingﬂis still found to be relevant in all countries,
this does not prevent increased pressurefrom international competition. For example,firms have begun to put out tenders among
international banks, or to use different banksfor specific transactions.Finally, alternative distribution channels areincreasingly being used by banks to save costs
and to reach new customers. Althoughbranches have remained the main channel,banks have increased their use of independentintermediaries or franchise systems. The
internet has the potential to fundamentallychange the way in which banks interact withcustomers. In most EU countries, however,
banks are developing a multi-channel strategy,combining the traditional branch networkwith the internet. So far, the spread of

internet banking has been greatest in
securities trading and other standardiseddeposit-related services. In the EU, internet
banking has been developed mainly by existingbanks; there are very few pure internet banksand their market share is very low.Performance and risks
In the course of 2001 the environment inwhich banks operated deteriorated as global
and EU macroeconomic performanceweakened, stock markets declined andfinancial market volatility increased. Macro-
prudential analysis of the risks to the banking
sector was stepped up, particularly after
the terrorist attacks in the United States on
11 September.Risks to the banking sector increased, evenbefore the US events, on account of thehigher indebtedness of banks™ borrowers andthe greater fragility of certain important
borrower sectors and countries.First, as to banks™ sectoral risk exposures,
the telecom-media-technology (TMT) sectorsshowed a rapid increase in borrowing, mainlyfor the acquisition of licences and other

investments related to the third-generation(3G) mobile telephone networks. In the EU,
these sectors lost more than 50% of their
stock market value in the year since the peakin the spring of 2000. While the market
sentiment towards the TMT sectors improved
in late 2001, significant fragilities remained.
This was due to, inter alia, the increasedwillingness of governments to reduce the high
cost of building the 3G infrastructure. Somesectoral risks were heightened further as aresult of the terrorist attacks in the United
140States; this was particularly the case for thosesectors (airline, tourism and insurance)directly affected by these attacks. Banks™exposures to these sectors were generally
found to be not overly large and manageable.Second, with regard to the banks™ country
risk exposures, the economic situation insome emerging market economies had
deteriorated even before the US events, and
this deterioration was accentuated as a result.In Asia, a sharp decline in IT sector exports,
in particular, drove down economic activity.
The situation in Latin America worsenedsignificantly as a result of the weakening of
the US economy and the financial crisis inArgentina. In the course of the year, and incontrast to previous situations of financial
instability in emerging markets, international
investors decoupled the specific risksassociated with Argentina from those arising
from other Latin American countries.
Financial contagion effects on Brazildecreased significantly in the last quarter of
2001, even though conditions in Argentinacontinued to deteriorate. A similarassessment can be made as regards Turkey,
where financial instability, while remaining aconcern, did not result in widespread contagionto other countries. With the exception of

Russia, economic growth prospects alsoworsened in a number of central and easternEuropean countries. EU banks™ total gross credit
exposures to emerging market economiestended to increase in 2001, whilst in most casesremaining fairly limited in proportion to banks™own funds.Third, as regards the performance of thebanking sector, in 2001 EU banks™ net income
declined following a reduction in income frominvestment banking, which was one of the
main drivers behind the record level ofprofits in 2000, and the deterioration ofmacroeconomic conditions. In this context,
the rigidity of banks™ costs seems to have
made it difficult to maintain profitability. Allin all, the outlook for profitability worsened
in the course of 2001. However, the positiveperformance record of most banks in the
years before 2001 and the accumulated capital
buffers were deemed reassuring as regardstheir ability to withstand the deterioration inexternal conditions.3Banking and financial regulation
The revision of the capital adequacy
framework for banks remained the main
issue in the field of 
banking regulation at the
international level. The Basel Committeeon Banking Supervision (BCBS) decided to
amend the time frame for finalisation andimplementation of the new Capital Accordinter alia in order to thoroughly review the

numerous and extensive comments receivedduring and after the second consultativeround, which started in January 2001. During
the course of 2001 the BCBS further refinedthe main elements of the three pillars of theproposed framework, namely minimum
capital requirements, the supervisory reviewprocess and market discipline, in order to
enable the elaboration of a comprehensive

set of rules. In addition, the calibration ofabsolute capital charges was further improvedon the basis of the outcome of targetedimpact studies. Moreover, macro-prudentialaspects relating to possible pro-cyclical
features of the new Accord receivedincreased attention.At the EU level, work on reforming theregulatory capital framework for banks and
investment firms was undertaken in parallel
with that of the BCBS. In March 2001, the
European Commission released its secondconsultative document. The focus of this
document was on issues of particular concernto the EU, such as the treatment of small andmedium-sized banks and of investment firms;
a number of specific solutions were proposedin this regard. Given the need for flexibility inthe decision-making process, in order to
respond effectively to developments infinancial services and markets, a new
procedure is envisaged for amending the141

website.forthcoming directive; this is based on adistinction between the core elements Œsubject to the normal co-decision
procedure Œ and the technical provisions 
Œsubject to amendments under theﬁcomitologyﬂ procedure.In June 2001, the ECB, which participates inboth the BCBS and the Banking Advisory
Committee (the EU forum assisting theEuropean Commission in the preparation of
the new Community banking legislation) in an
observer capacity, submitted its commentson the consultative documents issued by theBCBS3 and the European Commission. The
ECB supported the general thrust of the
proposed regulatory reform on the basis thatit would contribute to strengthening financial

stability. The main remarks of the ECB
focused on: (i) the possible pro-cyclical effectsof the new Accord; (ii) the need for an
adequate incentive structure in selecting the
most appropriate approach (i.e. standardised,IRB foundation and IRB advanced); (iii) the
effective interplay of the three pillars and theneed for supervisory convergence in
implementing the new regulatory framework;
and (iv) the right balance between accuracyand complexity. As regards the EU-specificissues, the ECB endorsed a fair and prudent
treatment both of small and medium-sizedbanks and of investment firms to ensure thatthe regulatory capital requirements reflect
their specific risk profile. The ECB also
welcomed the proposed flexibility of thelegislative process.The issue of fair value accounting (FVA) has
also been topical in the international
discussions following the issuance inDecember 2000 of the consultative documententitled ﬁDraft standard and basis forconclusions Œ financial instruments and similar
itemsﬂ by the Financial Instruments Joint
Working Group of Standard Setters. In this

document, it is proposed to use FVA as thebasis for the valuation of all financialinstruments. In its contribution to the
consultation process, the ECB conveyed its
reservations about the adequacy of applyinga full FVA regime to the banking sector, in
particular to the banking book of banks.
 4In the area of financial regulation, the
implementation of the Financial ServicesAction Plan continued in 2001, with the
objective of promoting further integration offinancial markets in the EU, while at the sametime pursuing adequate investor protection
and the stability of the financial sector. In thiscontext, in 2001 the Commission put forwarda proposal for a directive on financial
conglomerates, with the aim of establishingprudential requirements at the conglomeratelevel and of achieving a high degree of
co-ordination between the competentsupervisory authorities. In its Opinion onthe matter,5 the ECB proposed certain
improvements with regard to the directive™sscope of application, the transparency andclarity of supervisory arrangements and the
appropriate distribution of tasks and
competencies among the relevant authorities,particularly as regards the ﬁco-ordinationﬂ ofsupplementary supervision.The events of 11 September and their impact
on financial stability received high priority ininternational regulatory discussions, as didthe related concerns over the potential abuse
of the financial system for financing terrorism.
The Governing Council of the ECB fullysupported the measures taken in the

aftermath of these events to prevent the useof the financial system in the funding ofterrorist activities. At the global level, the
role of the Financial Action Task Force onMoney Laundering Œ in which the ECB
participates as an observer Œ was enhanced
by extending its mandate to combatting the
financing of terrorism. At the EU level,
the final agreement, reached in December
2001, on the amendments to the moneylaundering Directive will imply a substantial
142strengthening of this Directive. The draftdirective on insider dealing and marketmanipulation, put forward in 2001, is also

expected to make a useful contribution todiscouraging the abuse of financial markets.In its Opinion on the subject, the ECBhighlighted the need for enhanced supervisoryco-operation and for convergence of
supervisory practices.143
Chapter IXThestatistical framework
1461Introduction
As in 2000, the ECB™s statistical work in 2001was aimed at ensuring that the informationneeded to support the functions of theEurosystem continued to be received,
processed and made available to users in atimely manner and to a high quality standard,with good supporting documentation.Much of this work was carried out in closeco-operation with the NCBs, which collect
data from the reporting agents, produceaggregates at the national level and transmitthese to the ECB, which, in turn, produces
the euro area aggregates. In addition, boththe NCBs (and other national authorities)
and the ECB have been heavily involved in
statistical conceptual and development work,as well as in the preparation of ECB legal actswithin the framework of Council Regulation

(EC) No. 2533/98 concerning the collectionof statistical information by the ECB.  The
Statute of the ESCB also requires that the
ECB co-operate with Community institutionsand with international organisations. The
scope of the statistical work of the ESCB ispresented in a document entitled ﬁStatisticalinformation collected and compiled by theESCBﬂ, dated May 2000, which covers moneyand banking and related statistics, balance of
payments statistics, the internationalinvestment position, financial accounts andgovernment finance statistics. Information

needs in the areas of prices and costs,national accounts, the labour market,
government receipts and expenditure, short-
term indicators of output and demand, andbusiness and consumer surveys, which aremainly the responsibility of national statistical
institutes, are dealt with at the European levelby the European Commission, with the ECB
taking a keen interest in their development
as an active user.Subject to meeting its statistical requirements,
the ECB seeks to produce reliable,comprehensive and high-quality statistics in away that minimises the reporting burden on
institutions. In doing so, the ECB makes useof existing statistics wherever possible.2Money and banking statistics and statistics on financial markets
Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) report
balance sheet data on a monthly and quarterly
basis. The ﬁList of MFIsﬂ is updated monthly
and is published on the ECB™s website. Therequirement is to maintain a consistent
application of the definition of an MFI acrossthe euro area and the European Union.In November 2001 the Governing Council ofthe ECB approved a new ECB Regulation
concerning the consolidated balance sheet of
the MFI sector (ECB/2001/13), which repealsand replaces Regulation ECB/1998/16, asamended in August 2000, and introduces
major improvements to MFI balance sheetstatistics. The new requirements include themonthly compilation of a detailed sectoral
breakdown of deposits included in M3 and ofloans, as well as the provision of comparablerevaluation adjustments for the calculation offlow statistics for MFI loans and holdings ofsecurities. A quarterly breakdown of MFI
holdings of shares by sub-sector is alsoincluded. The new statistical requirementswere subject to a formal procedure involving
reporting agents to strike a balance betweenthe benefit of additional data for monetarypolicy analysis and other analytical purposes
and the costs arising from the implementationof these requirements. Data according to thenew regulation will be reported for the first
time in early 2003.During 2001 adjustments were made to theM3 aggregate, using newly availableinformation about holdings of negotiableinstruments by non-residents of the euro
area. Holdings of money market fund shares/
units by investors outside the euro area have
been excluded from M3 since May 2001.147
Starting with the release of monetarystatistics for October 2001, M3 has also beencorrected for holdings of short-term debt
instruments (i.e. money market paper anddebt securities issued by MFIs in the euroarea with an initial maturity of up to two
years) by non-residents of the euro area.Hence, as from October 2001, M3 has beenadjusted for all holdings of negotiable
monetary instruments by non-residents of theeuro area. Back series are available from thestart of monetary union in January 1999.
These adjustments bring the measurement ofM3 significantly closer to the ECB™sconceptual definition of this aggregate, which
is to include monetary holdings of euro arearesidents only.There were some important developmentsregarding the publication of M3 in 2001. The
release dates for the ECB™s monthly monetarystatistics are currently announced for thefollowing four months on a rolling basis; thefirst such announcement was made in July
2001. Furthermore, as from that month theannual growth rates for currency incirculation, overnight deposits, M1, short-
term deposits other than overnight deposits
(M2 Œ M1), M2, marketable instruments
(M3 Œ M2) and M3 were calculated on the
basis of data adjusted for seasonal and end-of-month calendar effects. Through thisprocedure, the annual growth rates reflect
underlying patterns more accurately thanthose based on unadjusted data. When themonetary statistics were first published, no

sufficiently reliable and stable seasonallyadjusted data were available. In addition, euroarea statistics on electronic money, on the
national breakdown of the aggregated balancesheet of the 
ﬁOther MFIﬂ sub-sector, and on
the derivation of M3 flows are now regularly
published on the ECB™s website.Since 1999, a set of ten euro area retailinterest rates has been published monthly inthe ECB™s Monthly Bulletin. These follow ashort-term approach based on existingnational sources. While the availability ofthese retail interest rates has ensured that a
minimal initial set of retail interest ratestatistics was available for monetary policypurposes from the start of Monetary Union,

the underlying data are not harmonised andthe results should be used with caution.During 2001 work on new interest rate
statistics continued and in December 2001Regulation No. ECB/2001/18 was adopted.This Regulation provides for the introduction
of a comprehensive new set of interest ratestatistics on MFI loan and deposit business,which is harmonised, complete, detailed and
able to cope with financial innovation. Thestatistics cover only those interest rates thatare applied to euro-denominated deposits and

loans vis-à-vis households and non-financial
corporations resident in the euro area. They
will meet a long-standing and essential user
requirement for better interest rate datainter alia to support the analysis of monetarydevelopments and the monetary transmission
mechanism. The Regulation stipulates that45 indicators must be available to the ECB bythe 19th working day after the end of the
reference month and provides for thereporting of monthly interest rate statistics
on new business and outstanding amounts. In
this area, too, the decision was based on amerits and cost procedure. The first data willbe available in early 2003.In February 2001 securities issues statisticswere greatly extended with the release on

the ECB™s website of monthly data stretchingback to January 1990 (December 1989 for
stocks) on stocks (amount outstanding) and
flows (gross issuance, redemptions and net
issuance).
1483Balance of payments, international reserves and international
investment position statistics, and effective exchange ratesThe compilation and publication of euro areamonthly and quarterly balance of paymentsdata and annual net international investment
position data and of the Eurosystem
™s monthlyinternational reserve position proceededsmoothly in 2001. Work has been undertaken
to improve the collection of portfolioinvestment data, an important and complexitem. Further developments are expected in
2002 on this, on direct investment (the
subject of much collaborative work in 2001)
and on the recording of investment income.
Work has also been undertaken to define a
standard geographical breakdown of thebalance of payments and international
investment position statistics. Further stepshave been taken to improve the sectorbreakdown of the balance of payments, in
particular between the MFI and other sectors,thus contributing to consistency betweenmonetary aggregates and balance of payments
data. In co-operation with the European
Commission (Eurostat) and national balanceof payments compilers, the ECB worked on
criteria for assessing the quality of balance ofpayments and related statistics. The ECB alsocontributed to the discussion within the
European Union about the likely direction ofchange in balance of payments statisticalsystems, to some extent as a consequence of
the advent of Economic and Monetary Union.The seasonal adjustment of the euro area
balance of payments current account was
published for the first time in July 2001.A revised version of the annual publication
ﬁEuropean Union balance of payments/international investment position statistical
methodsﬂ was released in November 2001.
This publication provides documentation onthe statistical methodologies applied in
Member States for compiling balance ofpayments and international investmentposition statistics and, as such, improves the
transparency of the compilation of euro area
statistics.4Financial accounts and government finance statistics
Quarterly financial accounts data for the euroarea non-financial sectors were published for
the first time in May 2001. The new data
cover the financing and financial investmentof the household, non-financial corporations
and government sectors in the euro area,showing both transactions and amountsoutstanding along with instrument details.
The data are based on euro area moneyand banking and securities issues statistics,government finance statistics, quarterly
national financial accounts and BISinternational banking statistics, and start inthe fourth quarter of 1997.The ECB continues to publish annual data
on government revenue and expenditure
in the euro area. During 2001 quarterly
data became available under CommissionRegulation (EC) No. 264/2000, covering taxes
and social contributions on the revenue sideand social benefits on the expenditure side.Community legislation in preparation will,
when implemented, complete the quarterlycoverage of government non-financialtransactions and provide quarterly data on
government financial transactions and stocks
beyond what is already available from otherdata sources.149
5General economic statistics
General economic statistics covering pricesand costs, national accounts, labour marketsand a wide range of other economic datasupport the second pillar of the ECB™smonetary policy strategy. The ECB and theEuropean Commission (which is mainlyresponsible for these statistics at European
level) collaborated closely in monitoring theimplementation of the Action Plan on EMUStatistical Requirements presented to the
ECOFIN Council in September 2000. TheAction Plan includes about ten legal acts, ofwhich three, in the area of short-term
business statistics, were adopted in 2001.A further progress report adopted andpublished by the ECOFIN Council in
November 2001 lists a number of actions still
necessary even after the implementation of
the current Action Plan. In particular, furtherimprovements must be made in availability
and timeliness of key indicators. The report
also stressed the need for a broader statisticalbasis for service activities, a better balancingof priorities between speed, detail and quality
of statistics, and the collection of data for the
rapid production of European aggregates.
6Incorporation of Greece in euro area statistics
The incorporation of Greece into euro areastatistics generally went smoothly. Theenlargement of the euro area to includeGreece as from 1 January 2001 had two main
statistical implications. First, residents ofGreece were included as residents of theeuro area. Second, the Greek drachma
became a national denomination of the euro.
Consequently, from a statistical perspective,
the composition of the ﬁrest of the worldﬂand ﬁforeign currenciesﬂ items changed. This,
in turn, affected all monetary, financial and
other economic statistics for the euro area
as a whole.The preparation of statistics for the enlargedeuro area was co-ordinated with theEuropean Commission to ensure, wherenecessary, consistency in all statisticaldomains. All changes were implemented inthe ﬁEuro area statisticsﬂ section of the ECB
™sMonthly Bulletin, as data relating to 2001
became available. Monetary policy statisticsand data on monetary developments, financialmarkets, securities issues, interest rates and

consumer prices for the extended euro areawere available first. Balance of payments dataas well as real economy statistics for the
extended euro area became available later,reflecting the normal release schedule. Inaddition, for analytical purposes, back series
for some selected economic indicators werecompiled for the euro area plus Greece upto end-2000 and published in the statistical

section of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.7Co-operation with the European Commission and international
institutionsAt the European level the agreed division ofstatistical responsibilities between the ECB
and the European Commission (Eurostat),worked well in 2001, as in previous years.The ECB also has close contacts with the BIS,the IMF and the OECD concerning statistical
matters.
1508Statistics relating to non-participating Member States and
accession countriesAll EU Member States were stronglyencouraged to undertake the statisticalpreparations for participation in Stage Three

of EMU.As in previous years, in 2001 the Eurosystemprovided extensive technical assistance to thecentral banks of those countries which arecandidates to join the EU 
Œ the accession
countries Œ with a view to preparing for their
future integration into the ESCB, and later
into the Eurosystem (see also Chapter V for

a more detailed overview of the relation
between the ECB and the accessioncountries). This technical assistance isprimarily intended to help these countriesimplement data collection, compilation and
exchange systems that will allow them, in duecourse, to meet the ECB™s statisticalrequirements, and to contribute to properly
articulated (aggregated and consolidated)statistics for the euro area. At the conceptual
level, the ECB published a ﬁProvisionallist of MFIs of the accession countriesﬂ and
a methodological manual for moneyand banking statistics, while a manual for

balance of payments statistics was publishedin early 2002.151

2Compliance with the prohibitions of monetary financing and
privileged accessPursuant to Article 237 (d) of the Treaty, theECB is entrusted with the task of monitoringthe fulfilment by the 15 EU NCBs of their
obligations under Articles 101 and 102 ofthe Treaty and Council Regulations (EC)Nos. 3603/93 and 3604/93. This task is
performed by the General Council of theECB. In addition, the General Council
monitors the ECB™s compliance with theseprovisions. Article 101 prohibits the ECB and
the NCBs from providing overdraft facilitiesor any other type of credit facility to
governments and Community institutions orbodies, as well as from purchasing debtinstruments directly from them. Article 102

prohibits any measure, not based on
prudential considerations, which establishesprivileged access by governments and
Community institutions or bodies to financial
institutions. In parallel with the General
Council, the European Commission monitors
Member States™ compliance with the above
provisions.The General Council also monitors the EUcentral banks™ secondary market purchases
of debt instruments issued by both the
domestic public sector and the publicsector of other Member States. Accordingto the recitals of Council Regulation (EC)No. 3603/93, the acquisition of public sectordebt instruments in the secondary marketmust not be used to circumvent the objective

of Article 101 of the Treaty. Such purchasesshould not become a form of indirectmonetary financing of the public sector.For 2001, the General Council did not findmajor cases of non-compliance with the
above Treaty requirements and the associatedCouncil Regulations by the NCBs of MemberStates or by the ECB. The General Council
noted that the amount of coins held by twoNCBs and credited to the public sectortemporarily exceeded the limit of 10% of
coins in circulation as laid down in Article 6of Council Regulation (EC) No. 3603/93, inthe context of the strong reflow of coins to
these NCBs prior to the introduction of eurocoins on 1 January 2002. Apart from theseinfringements of the prohibition of monetary

financing laid down in Article 101, the GeneralCouncil also took note of two other incidentswhere the ECB and one NCB, in differentways, did not comply 
fully with the Treatyprovisions. However, in both these cases, theamounts involved were minor and immediate
measures were taken by the central banksconcerned to avoid the occurrence of suchevents in the future.3The administration of the borrowing and lending operations
of the European CommunityIn accordance with Article 123 (2) of theTreaty and Article II of Council Regulation(EEC) No. 1969/88 of 24 June 1988, theECB has responsibility for the administration
of the borrowing and lending operations ofthe European Community under the medium-term financial assistance facility. During 2001,however, the ECB performed no suchadministration tasks, as there was nooutstanding balance at the end of 2000 and
no new operations were initiated during theyear.Chapter XIExternal communication
and accountability
160IThe ECB
™s communication policy and activities1.1Communication policy objectives
The ECB is committed to the principles ofopenness, transparency and accountability.
Although these are not an end in themselves,they provide the basis for the ECB™s and theEurosystem™s communication policy, which is
aimed at contributing to the effectiveness,efficiency and credibility of monetary policyand at enhancing public understanding of the

Eurosystem and its work.The communication efforts are directedmainly, but not exclusively, towards audiencesin the 12 euro area countries. Thedecentralised set-up of the Eurosystem
facilitates external communication in differentlanguages and in different national contexts.Accordingly, the NCBs play an important role
in achieving the goals of the communicationpolicy. The effective co-ordination of
the communication activities within the
Eurosystem is of paramount importance. Inthe process of co-ordination, special emphasisis put on the efforts to achieve ﬁsingle voiceﬂcommunication on the single monetary policyin the euro area.The decision taken on 8 November 2001 bythe Governing Council of the ECB to assessits monetary policy stance Œ as a rule 
Œ only
once a month, instead of at every fortnightlymeeting, had significant communicationimplications. One of the desired effects of
this decision was to reduce the frequency ofmedia and market speculation on possiblechanges in the monetary policy stance.1.2Important communication issues in
2001A number of topical issues can be identifiedas being among the most important for the
ECB™s communication in 2001. These issues
are dealt with in detail in the relevant
chapters of this Annual Report. However,they are also mentioned in brief below in orderto give an overview of the communicationchallenge facing the ECB and the Eurosystem in2001.For some of these issues the ECB actedproactively, with the aim of increasingthe general public™s knowledge of matterspertaining to the ECB™s fields of competence.For others, the ECB responded to a demandfor information from the media, fromspecialised groups or from the public.Some of the most important communicationissues in 2001 were:The monetary policy stance. The ECB
™skey interest rates were changed four times
during 2001. See Chapter I.
Decisions on the issue of euro banknotes
and on the allocation of monetary income.Preparations for the euro cash
changeover, including the conduct of theEuro 2002 Information Campaign. SeeChapter VI.Monetary policy operations, particularly in
the light of the exceptional circumstances
in September 2001. See Chapter II.The Eurosystem™s role in the EU accession
process. See Chapter V.Development of payment and settlement
systems, in particular progress towards a
uniform service level for retail payments inthe euro area. See Chapter VII.Statistical issues, in particular a

refinement of the statistics on monetary
developments. See Chapter IX.Discussions on supervisory issues andfinancial stability at the European andinternational level. See Chapter VIII.
Organisational matters of the ECB, in

particular the project to acquire a site forthe future premises of the ECB and the
161
Executive Board™s decision to partially
redistribute the individual responsibilitiesof its members. See the ECB President™sforeword to this Annual Report.1.3Communication activities
The ECB continues to use various different
communication tools to disseminateinformation to the general public and itselected representatives, to the financial
markets and to other interest groups in sucha way as to take due account of the diversityof the audiences. Article 15 of the Statute of
the ESCB stipulates that the ECB shall drawup and publish quarterly reports on theactivities of the ESCB. Moreover, it must
present an annual report on the activities ofthe ESCB and on the monetary policy of boththe previous and the current year to the
European Parliament, the Council of theEuropean Union, the Commission and theEuropean Council. In addition, a financial
statement of the Eurosystem has to bepublished each week. In fact, the ECBcommunicates more actively than is required
by the Treaty.The communication channels used by the ECBinclude the following:Press conferences held by the President
and the Vice-President, usually immediatelyafter the first Governing Council meetingof each month. The introductory statement
delivered by the President and theVice-President gives a detailed and almostﬁreal-timeﬂ description of the Governing
Council™s assessment of the monetary andeconomic developments in the euro area.The ECB™s Monthly Bulletin normallyappears one week after the first GoverningCouncil meeting in the month. It contains
details of the ECB™s view of the economicsituation, as well as articles on topicalissues and, in June and December, the
Eurosystem staff economic projections. Inaddition, it includes a wide range ofeconomic and financial data on the euro
area.The Annual Report of the ECB is presented
to the European Parliament and published
every year in April.The President of the ECB appears before
the Committee on Economic and Monetary

Affairs of the European Parliament once a
quarter. These testimonies are dealt within Section 2 of Chapter XI of this Annual

Report.Public speeches and interviews given by
the members of the ECB™s decision-makingbodies constitute an important meansof directly addressing both specialist
audiences and the general public.Press releases are used to make statistical
information or short policy announcementsavailable to the public.Brochures and other printed publications
are provided for audiences ranging fromthe general public to specialists in various
fields.The Working Paper Series seeks to

disseminate the results of researchconducted at the ECB, or presented in thecontext of ECB conferences and seminars.The Occasional Paper Series presents
policy-related topics to a wide audience,
including other policy-makers, academics,the media and the general public.The direct transmission of pages to wire
services gives the ECB the opportunity todisseminate market-sensitive information
in real time to financial market participants.Groups of visitors are received at the ECB
on an almost daily basis throughout theyear. In 2001 more than 10,000 Europeancitizens gained first-hand information
during a visit to the ECB.
162Academic conferences are organised tohelp stimulate interaction betweeneconomists interested in central banking
issues.Most documents published by the ECB aretranslated into the official languages of the
European Community. A substantial part ofthis translation work is carried out by the
NCBs. In addition, the NCBs are in charge ofprinting and distributing the ECB™s MonthlyBulletin as well as other ECB publications.All documents published by the ECB canbe viewed and downloaded from the
ECB™s website (www.ecb.int). A furtherimprovement of this service took place inJanuary 2002 when a search function was
installed on the website. The number of visitsto the ECB™s website has increased steadilyand reached a monthly average of some
2 million in 2001. E-mail hotlines are providedto deal with various types of queries.2The exchange of information and views with the
European Parliament2.1Overview of relations between the
ECB and the European ParliamentIn 2001 the ECB continued its regulardialogue with the European Parliament, as
provided for in Article 113 (3) of the Treaty.As in past years, the main forum for theseregular contacts were the quarterly
testimonies before the Parliament™sCommittee on Economic and MonetaryAffairs, in which the President of the ECB
reported on the decisions taken by the ECB
and the fulfilment of the tasks of theEurosystem. Members of the Executive Board
also appeared before the European Parliamentin order to present the ECB™s Annual Report2000 to the Committee on Economic and
Monetary Affairs and, subsequently, at theEuropean Parliament™s plenary session,and in order to present the ECB
™s viewson the Commission™s report entitled ﬁEUeconomy Œ 2000 review
ﬂ.Moreover, the ECB was invited by the
European Parliament to participate inmeetings at the expert level. In this context,
ECB experts took part in a hearing ofthe European Parliament™s TemporaryCommittee on the ECHELON Interception
System in order to provide information about,in particular, the ECB™s strategy to protectinformation exchanged via its data and voice
communications systems against possibleinterception. Furthermore, the ECB took partin an expert panel on ﬁMonetary co-operationin Europe: the introduction of the euro and
its implications for ACF countriesﬂ (African,
Caribbean and Pacific states), which wasorganised in the context of the ACP-EU Joint
Parliamentary Assembly. An overview of theappearances made by ECB representativesbefore the European Parliament in 2001 is
provided in Box 12.In addition, some meetings between theEuropean Parliament and the ECB wereheld on an informal basis. In particular, a
delegation of members of the Committee on
Economic and Monetary Affairs visited theECB on 22 October 2001 in order toexchange views with the members of the
Executive Board. Moreover, on 27 June adelegation of ECB experts met members ofthe Committee on Economic and Monetary
Affairs at the European Parliament to discuss
issues related to the improvement of cross-
border retail payment services in euro.Finally, the ECB also replied to a number of
questions submitted in writing by Members
of the European Parliament. Insofar as suchreplies related to questions raised duringpublic testimonies made by the President of
the ECB, they were published on the ECB
™swebsite as an annex to the transcript of therespective testimonies. Thus the explanations
are made available to a wider public so as toensure transparency of the ECB™s views.163
Box 12Appearances by ECB representatives before the European Parliament in 2001On 4 July 2001 the President presented the ECB™s Annual Report 2000 at the European Parliament™s plenarysession.The following appearances were made by members of the Executive Board before the Committee onEconomic and Monetary Affairs:quarterly testimonies by the President (5 March, 28 May, 12 September and 18 December);presentation of the ECB™s Annual Report 2000 by the Vice-President (2 May);exchange of views with Mr. Issing on the Commission™s report entitled ﬁEU economy Œ 2000 review
ﬂ(24 January);Moreover, ECB experts participated in the following meetings held at the European Parliament:
hearing of the European Parliament™s Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System(6 March);1expert panel at the workshop on ﬁMonetary co-operation in Europe: the introduction of the euro and itsimplications for ACP countriesﬂ organised in the context of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly
(31 October).2.2Views of the ECB on selected topics
raised at meetings with theEuropean ParliamentDuring the exchanges of views between theEuropean Parliament and the ECB, a widerange of issues pertaining to the Eurosystem™sfields of competence were addressed.Naturally, the ECB™s monetary policydecisions and the assessment of economic
developments figured among the mainfocal points. In addition, members of theCommittee on Economic and Monetary
Affairs enquired about the other tasksconferred by the Treaty upon theEurosystem, such as its contribution to the
prudential supervision of credit institutions
and to the stability of the financial system, aswell as to the maintenance of efficient and
sound payment systems.Given the broad scope of subjects, it is notpossible to report on all aspects of thediscussions held between the EuropeanParliament and the ECB. Nonetheless, the
following sections provide information aboutsome of the most pertinent issues raised
during the President™s testimonies.The definition of price stability adopted bythe Governing Council of the ECBMembers of the Committee on Economic andMonetary Affairs raised questions with regardto the definition of price stability adopted bythe Governing Council of the ECB.The President pointed out that the  definition
of price stability, i.e. a year-on-year increase in
HICP inflation of below 2%, followed on fromdefinitions adopted by NCBs in the euro area
prior to the start of Stage Three of EMU. By
1On a decision by the Committee, this hearing was held in camera.

164maintaining this continuity, the ECB respectedexisting public expectations of long-term pricestability, thus enhancing the credibility of the

single monetary policy and public support forthe euro.With regard to the numerical value for the
definition of price stability, the Presidentrecalled that, for sound economic reasons,
the Treaty does not allow the exclusion, inan arbitrary manner, of low positive numbersfor increases in the price level. In this sense,
it would not have been appropriate toexclude inflation rates below a certain value,say 1.5%, from the definition of price stability.
Setting a relatively narrow range of price
increases admissible over the medium termhelps to anchor inflation expectations in
an effective manner, thereby reducinguncertainty and the associated risk premia oninterest rates. At the same time, by setting a
floor which excludes decreases in the HICPfrom the range of inflation rates regarded ascompatible with price stability, the definition
of price stability is made symmetric in that itprecludes deflation as well as inflation.From a general point of view, choosing aquantitative rather than qualitative definition
of price stability contributes to anchoring
inflation expectations which, as pointed outabove, is essential if the full benefits of pricestability are to be reaped. Moreover, the
President recalled that a quantitative definitionof price stability also provides the basis forthe accountability of the ECB by setting a

clear benchmark against which its monetarypolicy can be assessed over time. In this regard,the President stressed that, as foreseen by the

ECB™s monetary policy strategy, price stabilityis to be maintained over the medium term.This acknowledges the existence of shocks to
inflation which monetary policy cannot controlin the short run.The contribution of the single monetarypolicy to general economic policies in theCommunityThe contribution of the single monetarypolicy to general economic policies in the
Community without prejudice to theobjective of price stability, as stipulated inArticle 105 (1) of the Treaty, was again one
of the key issues raised during the President™stestimonies at the European Parliament.The President recalled that monetary policy
cannot influence real output over the longrun. Rather, the best contribution the ECB
can make to the general economic objectivesin the Community, such as sustainable andnon-inflationary growth and a high level of
employment, is the maintenance of pricestability. By focusing on its primary objective,the ECB contributes to avoiding distortions
in the price mechanism and minimisinginflation risk premia on interest rates. In thisway, it promotes the efficient allocation of
market resources and fosters conditionsconducive to investment.By focusing on the maintenance of price
stability over the medium term, the ECB™smonetary policy contributes to stabilising
output growth. This medium-term orientation
also reflects the need for gradual responsesto some types of economic shocks, thus

helping to avoid unnecessary variability in real
activity and interest rates.
The President also took the opportunity tostress that decisive structural reforms shouldremain an important element in Member
States™ policies to enhance the growth
potential of the euro area.These views were shared by the EuropeanParliament in its resolution on the ECB™sAnnual Report 2000, which emphasised that
ﬁthe ECB™s primary objective is to maintain
price stabilityﬂ and that 
ﬁits contribution togrowth and employment lies first and
foremost in the achievement of thatobjectiveﬂ (Recital B). Moreover, the
resolution also underscored the importance165
of structural reform to be undertaken by
Member States (Article 4).Preparations for the introduction of theeuro banknotes and coinsIn view of the fundamental importance of
ensuring a smooth cash changeover, the

President reported extensively on thepreparations for the introduction of theeuro banknotes and coins. More detailed
information on the introduction of eurobanknotes and coins and the cash changeoveris provided in Chapter VI.One of the issues raised in this context wasthat of banknote security. The President
pointed out that the security features of theeuro banknotes reflected the most advancedstate of technology so as to ensure that the
public can trust in the security of the new
banknotes. The particular attention devotedto the security of banknotes is also reflected
in the ECB™s participation in the preparationof Community legislation to protect the eurobanknotes and coins against counterfeiting

and the establishment by the ECB of aCounterfeit Analysis Centre for the technicalanalysis and classification of euro counterfeits.
The Counterfeit Analysis Centre sharesrelevant information with all competentauthorities.Members of the Committee on Economic andMonetary Affairs also enquired about the
state of preparation and implementation ofthe Euro 2002 Information Campaignlaunched by the Eurosystem. The President
explained that the general objective of theinformation campaign was to provide thegeneral public with all practical information
needed for a smooth cash changeover. Theinformation campaign, headed by the sloganﬁthe EURO. OUR 
moneyﬂ, was being closelyco-ordinated with the governments andchangeover boards of the participatingMember States in order to ensure the
maximum impact of the information given.
The Eurosystem had also paid utmostattention to ensuring that vulnerable groups,such as the blind and partially sighted, areprovided with the information and trainingneeded to become familiar with the new
banknotes.Committee members also addressed the issueof the frontloading and sub-frontloading of
euro banknotes and coins. In this context,the question was raised as to whether the

general public should be provided with eurobanknotes prior to the official changeoverdate. The President pointed out that in
assessing this issue the Eurosystem had hadto take a global perspective, covering allrelevant aspects and focusing on the general
interest. After extensive consultation with thecompetent professional organisations it wasconcluded that the disadvantages of sub-

frontloading euro banknotes to the general
public would outweigh the possibleadvantages. Consequently, the Governing
Council of the ECB had taken the decision Œwhich was supported by the ECOFINministers Œ not to provide the general public
with euro banknotes before 1 January 2002.Instead, the ECB suggested a number ofmeasures to facilitate a smooth cash
changeover which, to a large extent, havebeen taken into account in the nationalchangeover scenarios prepared by Member
States.Improving cross-border retail paymentservices in euroAn important part of the exchange of viewsbetween the European Parliament and thePresident was devoted to the question of
how to improve retail payment services in
euro. Committee members asked for the
ECB™s views on how to achieve a substantialdecrease in fees levied for such services andhow the ECB was contributing to thisobjective.The President explained that from the startof Stage Three of EMU the Eurosystem had

been paying much attention to this issue, asevidenced by several ECB publications. TheEurosystem fully shares the European
166Parliament™s view that an integrated area forpayments is a necessary complement to the
single currency area and will further enhance
public support for the euro. To this end, ithas defined seven objectives considered to
be indispensable for the achievement of a
single payments area for the euro. Moreover,the Eurosystem has been actively engaged indiscussions with the banking industry so as to
act as a catalyst for change in this area.More detailed information on cross-borderretail payments in euro may be found in

The European System of Central Banks(ESCB) is composed of the European Central
Bank (ECB) and the national central banks
(NCBs) of all 15 EU Member States, i.e. itincludes the three NCBs of the Member
States which have not yet adopted the euro.In order to enhance transparency andfacilitate understanding of the structure of

central banking in the euro area, the termﬁEurosystemﬂ has been adopted by the
Governing Council of the ECB. The
Eurosystem comprises the ECB and the NCBsof the Member States which have adoptedthe euro. As long as there are Member States
which have not yet adopted the euro, it willbe necessary to make a distinction betweenthe Eurosystem and the ESCB.The ECB has legal personality under publicinternational law. It has been established as

the core of the Eurosystem and ensures that
the tasks of the Eurosystem are carried outeither through its own activities or via theNCBs. While decision-making within theEurosystem and the ESCB is centralised, the
ECB, in taking its decisions on the way inwhich the tasks of the ESCB should be carriedout, is committed to the principle of
decentralisation in accordance with theStatute of the ESCB.Each of the NCBs has legal personalityaccording to the national law of its respectivecountry. The euro area NCBs, which form an
integral part of the Eurosystem, carry out thetasks conferred upon the Eurosystem inaccordance with the rules established by the
ECB™s decision-making bodies. The NCBs alsocontribute to the work of the ESCB throughthe participation of their representatives in
the various ESCB Committees (see Section 5below). The NCBs may perform non-Eurosystem functions on their own
responsibility, unless the Governing Council
finds that such functions interfere with theobjectives and tasks of the Eurosystem.
171
2The decision-making bodies of the ECB
The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governedby the decision-making bodies of the ECB:the Governing Council and the ExecutiveBoard. Without prejudice to this, the General
Council is constituted as a third decision-
making body of the ECB, if and for as long asthere are Member States which have not yet

adopted the euro. The functioning of thedecision-making bodies is governed by theTreaty establishing the European Community,
the Statute of the ESCB and the relevantRules of Procedure.12.1The Governing Council
The Governing Council, which is the supremedecision-making body of the ECB, comprisesall the members of the Executive Board and
the governors of the NCBs of the Member
States which have adopted the euro.According to the Treaty, the main
responsibilities of the Governing Council are:to adopt the guidelines and take the
decisions necessary to ensure theperformance of the tasks entrusted to the
Eurosystem; andto formulate the monetary policy of the

euro area, including, as appropriate,
decisions relating to intermediatemonetary objectives, key interest rates andthe supply of reserves in the Eurosystem,
and to establish the necessary guidelinesfor their implementation.When taking decisions on monetary policyand on other tasks of the Eurosystem, themembers of the Governing Council do notact as national representatives, but in a fullyindependent personal capacity. This isreflected in the principle of ﬁone member,one voteﬂ.In 2001 the Governing Council met, as a rule,every other week at the ECB™s premises inFrankfurt am Main, Germany. Seven meetings,including some non-scheduled meetings, were
held by means of a teleconference. Moreover,in line with the decision taken earlier thatthe Governing Council would meet twice a
year in another euro area country, onemeeting was hosted by the Central Bank ofIreland in Dublin and one by the
Oesterreichische Nationalbank in Vienna. Asmentioned in Chapter XI, in November 2001the Governing Council decided to change the
set-up of its meetings in such a way thatthere would be an in-depth assessment ofmonetary and economic developments and
related decisions specifically at the firstmeeting in the month, while, as a rule, the
second meeting of the month would

concentrate on issues related to other tasksand responsibilities of the ECB and theEurosystem.1The Rules of Procedure have been published in the Official
Journal of the European Communities, see Rules of Procedure of

The Executive Board comprises the President,the Vice-President and four other members,appointed by common accord of thegovernments of the Member States which

have adopted the euro at the level of theHeads of State or Government. The mainresponsibilities of the Executive Board are:
to prepare the meetings of the Governing
Council;to implement the monetary policy in theeuro area in accordance with the guidelinesand decisions laid down by the GoverningCouncil and, in doing so, to give thenecessary instructions to the euro areaNCBs;to manage the current business of the ECB;andto exercise certain powers delegated to itby the Governing Council, including someof a regulatory nature.Current practice is for the Executive Boardto meet at least once a week in order totake decisions on the implementation of
monetary policy, the preparation of themeetings of the Governing Council andinternal ECB matters.Back row (left to right): Eugenio Domingo Solans, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Otmar IssingFront row: Christian Noyer, Willem F. Duisenberg,  Sirkka Hämäläinen

1742.3The General Council
The General Council is composed of thePresident and the Vice-President of the ECB
and the governors of all 15 NCBs of the EU.It carries out those tasks taken over from
the European Monetary Institute which stillhave to be performed by the ECB in StageThree of EMU on account of the fact that not
all the Member States have adopted the euro.
Therefore, the General Council is primarilyresponsible for reporting on the progress
made towards convergence by the MemberStates which have not yet adopted the euro2and for giving advice on the necessarypreparations for irrevocably fixing theexchange rates of the currencies of thoseMember States (see Chapter IV). Moreover,
the General Council contributes to particular
activities of the ESCB, such as advisory
functions (see Chapter X) and the collection
of statistical information (see Chapter IX). In2001 the General Council met four times.
Two of these meetings were held by meansof a teleconference.2In accordance with the Protocol on certain provisions relating to
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
the Protocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark, both of
which are annexed to the Treaty, this reporting will be carried

out for the United Kingdom and Denmark only if they decide to
apply to adopt the euro.175

1763The organisation of the ECB
3.1Corporate governance
In addition to the decision-making bodies ofthe ECB described in the previous sections,

the corporate governance of the ECB alsoencompasses a number of external andinternal control layers.The Statute of the ESCB provides for twolayers, namely the external auditors and the
European Court of Auditors. The externalauditors audit the annual accounts of the ECB
(Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB). The

European Court of Auditors examines theoperational efficiency of the management ofthe ECB (Article 27.2).Moreover, the Directorate Internal Audit,
which reports directly to the President of
the ECB, continuously performs auditmissions under a mandate from the ExecutiveBoard. The mandate of the Directorate
Internal Audit is defined in the ECB Audit
Charter. The Charter was established on thebasis of professional standards which apply
internationally.3 Furthermore, the Internal
Auditors Committee is responsible for auditmissions under a mandate from the

Governing Council. The ESCB audit policywas established by the Governing Council inorder to ensure audit coverage for joint
projects and joint operational systems at theESCB level, which is carried out by theInternal Auditors Committee.The internal control structure of the ECB isbased on a functional approach, whereby each
organisational unit (Division, Directorate or
Directorate General) is responsible for itsown internal control and efficiency. In order
to ensure this, the business units implementa set of operational control procedures withintheir area of responsibility. In addition to
these controls, certain organisational unitsadvise and make proposals to the ExecutiveBoard on specific control issues on a
horizontal basis.The Code of Conduct of the European
Central Bank gives guidance to, and setsbenchmarks for, the staff of the ECB and themembers of the Executive Board, all of whom

are encouraged to maintain high standards ofprofessional ethics in the performance oftheir duties at the ECB as well as in their
relations with NCBs, public authorities,market participants, media representatives
and the public in general.4 In this respect, it
echoes the inquiry conducted on the
European Ombudsman™s own initiative into acode of good administrative behaviour for
Community officials in their relations withthe public.The Executive Board also adopted a set ofinternal controls, including detailed rulespreventing the abuse of sensitive financial

market information (ﬁinsider trading rulesﬂand ﬁChinese wallsﬂ). The staff of the ECBand the members of the Executive Board are
thereby prohibited from taking advantage,
whether directly or indirectly, of insideinformation to which they have access by
conducting private financial activities at theirown risk and for their own account, or at the
risk and for the account of a third party.
5Moreover, the Executive Board has appointedan Ethics Adviser to provide guidance onsome aspects of professional conduct and
professional secrecy. The Ethics Adviserensures a consistent interpretation of the staffrules, in particular the insider trading rules.
The budgetary authority of the ECB is vestedin the Governing Council, which adopts the
budget of the ECB, acting on a proposal put

institutes, such as the Institute for Internal Auditors (IIA) and the
Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA).4See the Code of Conduct of the European Central Bank in
accordance with Article 11.3 of the Rules of Procedure of the
European Central Bank, OJ C 76, 8.3.2001, p. 12 and the ECB™s

forward by the Executive Board. In addition,the Budget Committee assists the GoverningCouncil in matters related to the ECB™sbudget.In order to join the efforts of the institutionsof the European Communities and theMember States to combat fraud and otherillegal activities, the originally existing layers
of control within the ECB were enhanced bythe establishment of an independent Anti-Fraud Committee on the basis of the ECB
Decision on fraud prevention (ECB/1999/5)6.The Anti-Fraud Committee, which held threemeetings in 2001, is kept regularly informed
by the Directorate Internal Audit with regardto all issues related to the performance of itstasks.In accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the
Council, the Executive Board appointed a dataprotection officer with effect from 1 January2002.3.2Human resources management
StaffingAt the end of 2001 the number of staff
employed by the ECB from all 15 MemberStates stood at 1,043, with total budgeted
staff positions of 1,118.5. This compares with
941 staff employed at the end of 2000. TheECB™s annual staff position budget for 2002was set at a maximum of 1,154.5 Œ an increase
of 3.2% compared to the 2001 annual staff
position budget.A Research Visitors programme was launchedin the Directorate General Research. It
focuses on specific high-level researchprojects in the field of monetary policy. 13Research Visitors have been contracted for
an average duration of two months.Also in the Directorate General Research,the ECB™s Graduate Research programme,which is aimed at highly talented researchstudents at an advanced stage of theirdoctoral studies, attracted 13 participants foran average duration of three months.In the ECB as a whole, and across almost allbusiness areas, 87 trainees, students andgraduates, mainly with an economics
background, were contracted for an averageduration of three and a half months.
Human resources management policiesThe rules for recruitment and promotionhave been codified and laid down inrespective Administrative Circulars. The rules
aim to ensure that recruitment andpromotion are based upon the principles ofprofessional qualification, transparency, equal
access and non-discrimination, and toestablish fair and equal practices in therecruitment and promotion procedures.As a complement to the annual staff appraisalexercise, a multi-source feedback process has
been introduced for managers. The focus of
the process is on self-development in termsof managerial skills. Managers (Heads of
Division, Directors, Deputy DirectorsGeneral and Directors General) and membersof the Executive Board can volunteer to
participate in the process, in which they seekfeedback from those reporting directly tothem, their peers and, if appropriate, external
parties. 39 managers volunteered toparticipate in the first exercise.The childcare facility and the EuropeanSchoolThe ECB™s childcare facility has moved fromprovisional facilities to its permanent location.
However, in view of the high demand forplaces, the provisional facility will remainopen until the permanent location can be
extended. The definitive premises should6See the Decision of the European Central Bank of 7 October
1999 on fraud prevention (ECB/1999/5), OJ L 291, 13.11.1999,

European Central Bank were amended by a new Article 9a, see
OJ L 314, 8.12.1999, p. 32.

met with delays. The school will thereforeopen for the 2002/2003 school year, for
primary and pre-primary classes, in temporary
premises. The school will have four languagesections: English, French, German and Italian.
Staff relationsIn addition to formal consultations on changesin the Conditions of Employment, the StaffRules and other issues, the dialogue with the
Staff Committee covered several other topics
in 2001, in particular in the second half of theyear the security situation at the ECB.
The Union of the Staff of the ECB (USE) gave
its views on proposed changes to the
Conditions of Employment and the StaffRules. The issue of the recognition of theUSE and an external trade union as socialpartners for the negotiation of collectivelabour agreements is still pending in the
European Court of First Instance.3.3The organisation chart of the ECB
In the light of experience gathered during thefirst three and a half years of the existence ofthe ECB, the Executive Board decided on anumber of organisational adjustments. In

order to maximise the synergy betweenbusiness areas, the Executive Board decidedto change the responsibilities of individual
Executive Board members. Moreover, somechanges were made in the functions of ECB
business areas. These changes took effect on
1 January and 1 March 2002, respectively,and are reflected in the new organisationchart of the ECB. The new organisation chart

also better reflects the fact that the ExecutiveBoard acts as a collegiate body whenmanaging the day-to-day business of the ECB.

1804ESCB Social Dialogue
On the basis of an agreement with three
European trade union federationsrepresenting staff employed in the ESCB, theECB conducts a Social Dialogue with staff
representatives from the NCBs and the ECB.The objective of the Social Dialogue is to
inform staff and to discuss decisions to be

taken by the decision-making bodies of theECB with regard to the tasks of the ESCBinsofar as they may have a major impact onthe employment situation and workingconditions at the central banks. In 2001, theSocial Dialogue was convened twice. The

major topic of discussion was the futureprinting of euro banknotes. Other issues weredevelopments in TARGET and in prudential
supervision.5ESCB Committees
The ESCB Committees have continued to playan important role in the performance of the
tasks of the Eurosystem/ESCB. In July 2001
the Governing Council renewed theirmandates and re-appointed their respectivechairpersons for a further three years. At the
request of both the Governing Council andthe Executive Board, the ESCB Committeeshave provided expertise in their fields of
competence and have facilitated the decision-making process. The ESCB Committees arecomposed of representatives from the
Eurosystem central banks and, whereappropriate, of other competent bodies, suchas national supervisory authorities in the caseof the Banking Supervision Committee. The
NCBs of the Member States which have not
yet adopted the euro have also eachappointed representatives to take part in the
meetings of an ESCB Committee whenever itdeals with matters which fall within the fieldof competence of the General Council. At
present there are 12 ESCB Committees, allof which were established under Article 9 ofthe Rules of Procedure of the ECB.

Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure of theECB. It is composed of representatives of theEurosystem central banks and assists theGoverning Council in matters related to theECB™s budget. In July 2001 the GoverningCouncil adopted a revised mandate for the
Budget Committee and re-appointed itschairman, Liam Barron, for a further threeyears.Annual Accountsof the ECBand Consolidated Balance Sheetof the Eurosystem2001Chapter XIII1

Frankfurt am Main, 12 March 2002EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKWillem F. DuisenbergPresident1871
1The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in
a Decision of the Governing Council of the ECB of
12 December 2000 (ECB/2000/16) OJ L 33, 2.2.2001.Accounting policies1Form and presentation of the financial
statementsThe financial statements of the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB) have been designed topresent fairly the financial position of the
ECB and the results of its operations. They
have been drawn up in accordance with thefollowing accounting policies, which theGoverning Council of the ECB considers to
be appropriate to the function of a central
bank. These policies are consistent with theprovisions of Article 26.4 of the Statute of
the ESCB, which require a standardised
approach to the rules governing theaccounting and reporting operations of the
Eurosystem.Accounting principlesThe following accounting principles have beenapplied: economic reality and transparency,prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet
events, materiality, the accruals principle,
going concern and consistency andcomparability.Basis of accountingThe accounts have been prepared on ahistorical cost basis, modified to includemarket valuation of marketable securities,
gold and all other on-balance-sheet andoff-balance-sheet assets and liabilitiesdenominated in foreign currency. Transactions

in financial assets and liabilities are reflectedin the accounts on the basis of the date on
which they are settled.Gold, foreign currency assets andliabilitiesAssets and liabilities denominated in foreigncurrency are converted into euro at theexchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet
date. Income and expenses are converted atthe exchange rate prevailing at the time ofthe transaction. The revaluation of foreignexchange assets and liabilities is performedon a currency-by-currency basis, including
on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheetinstruments.Revaluation to the market price for assetsand liabilities denominated in foreign currencyis treated separately from the exchange rate
revaluation.No distinction is made between the price
and currency revaluation differences for gold.Instead, a single gold valuation is accountedfor on the basis of the price in euro per fine
ounce of gold, which is derived from the
exchange rate of the euro against the USdollar on 28 December 2001.
SecuritiesAll marketable debt securities and similarassets are valued at the mid-market prices
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Forthe year ending on 31 December 2001,mid-market prices on 28 December 2001
were used. Non-marketable securities arevalued at cost.Income recognitionIncome and expenses are recognised in theperiod in which they are earned or incurred.Realised gains and losses are taken to the
profit and loss account. An average cost
method is used on a daily basis to calculatethe acquisition cost of individual items. In the
event of an unrealised loss on any item at theyear-end, the average cost of that item isreduced in line with the end-of-year exchange
rate and/or market price.1
1882TARGET is the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross
settlement Express Transfer system (see also Chapter VII).Unrealised gains are not recognised asincome, but are transferred directly to arevaluation account.Unrealised losses are taken to theprofit and loss account if they exceed

previous revaluation gains registered inthe corresponding revaluation account.Unrealised losses in any one security or
currency or in gold are not netted againstunrealised gains in other securities, currenciesor gold.Premiums or discounts arising on purchasedsecurities are calculated and presented as part
of interest income and are amortised overthe remaining life of the assets.Repurchase agreementsRepurchase agreements are recorded in thebalance sheet as collateralised inwarddeposits. The balance sheet shows the
deposits and the value of the securities usedas collateral. Securities sold under this typeof agreement remain on the balance sheet of

the ECB and are treated as if they hadremained part of the portfolio from whichthey were sold. Agreements involving
securities denominated in foreign currencyhave no effect on the average cost of the
currency position.Reverse repurchase agreements are recordedas collateralised loans on the assets side of
the balance sheet, for the value of the loan.Securities acquired under this type ofagreement are not revalued.Repurchase agreements and reverserepurchase agreements (including security
lending transactions) conducted under anautomated security lending programme arerecorded with effect on the balance sheet for
such transactions only where collateral isprovided by the borrower in the form ofcash over the maturity of the operation. In

2001, the ECB did not receive any collateral
in the form of cash over the maturity of suchan operation.Off-balance-sheet instrumentsCurrency instruments, namely foreign
exchange forward transactions, forward legsof foreign exchange swaps and other currency
instruments involving an exchange of one
currency for another at a future date, areincluded in the net foreign currency positionfor the purpose of calculating foreign
exchange gains and losses. Interest rateinstruments are revalued on an item-by-itembasis and treated in a similar manner to

securities. For foreign exchange swaps, the
forward position is revalued in conjunctionwith the spot position. Consequently, no net
valuation differences arise since the currencyreceived and the obligation to return it areboth valued at the same market rate in euro.
Profits and losses arising from off-balance-sheet instruments are recognised and treatedin the same way as profits and losses relating
to on-balance-sheet instruments.Post-balance-sheet eventsAssets and liabilities are adjusted for events
that occur between the annual balance sheetdate and the date on which the GoverningCouncil of the ECB approves the financial
statements if such events materially affect thecondition of assets and liabilities at thebalance sheet date.Intra-ESCB balancesIntra-ESCB transactions are cross-bordertransactions that occur between two EU
central banks. These transactions areprocessed primarily via TARGET2 and give
rise to bilateral balances in accounts held
between those EU central banks connected
to TARGET. These bilateral balances arenovated to the ECB daily, leaving each NCB
with a single net bilateral position vis-à-visthe ECB only. This position in the books ofthe ECB represents the net claim or liability
of each NCB against the rest of the ESCB.1891
Intra-ESCB balances of the participating NCBswith the ECB (except for the capital of theECB and positions resulting from the transfer

of foreign reserve assets to the ECB) aredescribed as intra-Eurosystem claims orliabilities and are presented in the Balance
Sheet of the ECB as a single net asset orliability position.Intra-ESCB balances of the non-participatingNCBs with the ECB are disclosed under
ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area residents
denominated in euroﬂ.Treatment of tangible and intangiblefixed assetsTangible fixed assets are valued at cost lessdepreciation. Depreciation is calculated on astraight-line basis, beginning in the quarter
after acquisition and continuing over theexpected economic lifetime of the asset,namely:Computers, related hardware and

software, and motor vehicles: four years;
Equipment, furniture and plant in building:ten years;Building and capitalised refurbishmentexpenditure: twenty-five years.Fixed assets costing less than 10,000 arewritten off in the year of purchase.
The ECB™s retirement planThe ECB operates a defined contributionpension scheme. The assets of the plan, which
exist solely for the purpose of providingbenefits for members of the plan and their

dependants, are included in the other assets
of the ECB and are identified separately.
Valuation gains and losses arising on the
assets of the pension fund are recognised asincome and expenditure of the retirementplan in the year in which they arise. The
benefits payable from the core benefitaccount, resulting from the contributionsof the ECB, have minimum guaranteesunderpinning the defined contributionbenefits.Entry of Greece into the euro areaFollowing the entry of Greece into the euro
area on 1 January 2001:
3the Bank of Greece transferred to the ECB
an amount of 97,679,000 representing theremaining 95% of its capital subscription toadd to the 5% already paid-up;between 2 and 5 January 2001, and in
accordance with Article 30.1 of the Statuteof the ESCB, the Bank of Greece
transferred foreign reserve assets to theECB with a total value equivalent to1,278,260,1614. These foreign reserveassets comprised amounts of gold, USdollars and Japanese yen in the sameproportions as the amounts transferred by
the other participating NCBs atthe beginning of 1999. The currencycomponent was transferred in the form of
cash and securities. The Bank of Greecewas subsequently credited with a claim onthe ECB in respect of the paid-up capital

and foreign reserve assets equivalent tothe amounts transferred.the depreciation of the euro, in particularvis-à-vis the US dollar, implied that the
euro equivalent of the foreign reserveassets transferred by the Bank of Greece,
calculated using rates as of 29 December2000, was higher than would have beenthe case had the Bank of Greece
transferred these assets along with theother participating NCBs in 1999. Had theBank of Greece been credited with a claim
of 1,278,260,161, this would have implied3Council Decision (2000/427/EC) of 19 June 2000 in accordance
with Article 122 (2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Greece of
the single currency on 1 January 2001, and Article 49 of the
Statute of the ESCB and the legal acts adopted pursuant to that
Article by the Governing Council of the ECB on 16 November
2000.4This latter figure was determined by multiplying the euro value,
at the exchange rates prevailing on 29 December 2000, of the

foreign reserve assets already transferred to the ECB by the
existing members of the Eurosystem by the ratio between the
number of shares subscribed by the Bank of Greece and the
number of shares already paid up by the other NCBs without a
derogation.1
190that they would have had a higher share inthe total claims of the participating NCBson the ECB than their respective share in
the capital of the ECB would havepermitted. Consequently this claim was
reduced, in agreement with the Bank of

Greece, to 1,028,200,000 so that theclaim of the Bank of Greece on the ECB
would be in line with its share in the ECB™s
capital.the difference between the adjusted claim
and the value of the assets transferred was

recorded as part of the contributions ofthe Bank of Greece, due under Article49.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, to the

provisions and reserves of the ECB existingas at 31 December 2000. The totalpayment by the Bank of Greece in respect
of these contributions amounted to285,794,874 and can be broken down asfollows:Contributions of the Bank of Greece underArticle 49.2 of the Statute of the ESCBECB provisions andAmountBalance

is of the opinion that the publication of a
cash flow statement will not provide the
readers of the financial statements with any
additional relevant information.In accordance with Article 27 of the Statuteof the ESCB, and on the basis of arecommendation of the Governing Councilof the ECB, the Council of the European

Notes on the Balance Sheet1Gold and gold receivables
The ECB holds 24.7 million ounces of fine gold
(2000: 24 million ounces). No transactions in
gold took place in 2001. The increase in this
position is due to revaluation and to thetransfer of gold from the Bank of Greece under

Article 30.1 of the Statute of the ESCB (seeﬁGold, foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂand ﬁEntry of Greece into the euro areaﬂ in thenotes on accounting policies).2Claims on non-euro area and euro
area residents denominated inforeign currency2.1Receivables from the IMF
This asset represents the ECB™s holdingsof Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as at31 December 2001. In 2001 the ECB agreed
to establish a two-way SDR buying and sellingarrangement with the International MonetaryFund (IMF) whereby the IMF is authorised to
arrange sales or purchases of SDRs against
euro, on behalf of the ECB, within minimumand maximum holdings levels.The SDR is defined in terms of a basket of
currencies. Its value is determined as the
weighted sum of exchange rates of the four
major currencies (US dollar, pound sterling,Japanese yen and euro). For accounting
purposes, SDRs are treated as a foreigncurrency asset (see ﬁGold, foreign currency
assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on

accounting policies).2.2Balances with banks and security
investments, external loans and otherexternal assets

Claims on euro area residents denominatedin foreign currencyThese claims consist of balances with foreign
banks, loans denominated in foreign currency
and investments in securities, denominated in
US dollars and Japanese yen.
3Claims on non-euro area residents
denominated in euro
As at 31 December 2001, this claim consistedof bank deposits with non-euro area
residents.4Other claims on euro area credit
institutions denominated in euroAs at 31 December 2001, except for thosetransactions conducted under the automatic
securities lending programme (see note 18),there were no outstanding reverserepurchase operations conducted with euro
area credit institutions in connection withthe management of the ECB™s own funds.5Securities of euro area residents
denominated in euro
These securities comprise marketable debtissued by specific euro area issuers with a
high level of credit quality.
6Intra-Eurosystem claims
This item consists mainly of the TARGET
balances of the participating NCBs vis-à-visthe ECB (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balancesﬂ in the
notes on accounting policies).1
1927Other assets
7.1Tangible and intangible fixed assets

These assets comprised the following mainitems on 31 December 2001:reinvested in the funds concerned,pending payment of benefits. The valueof the assets held by the plan is based on
a valuation by the external fund manager,using year-end market prices.(b)The ECB holds 3,000 shares in the
Bank for International Settlements, whichare included at the acquisition cost of
38.5 million.7.3Accruals and deferred expenditure
The principal component of this item isaccrued interest on securities and otherfinancial assets.7.4Sundry items
The increase in sundry items in 2001 isprimarily due to the capitalisation of banknoteproduction costs related to the production
of a contingency stock of euro banknotes forthe Eurosystem. These costs have been bornein the first instance by the ECB pending the
allocation of the stock to NCBs at cost.This position also includes a claim against theGerman Federal Ministry of Finance in respectof recoverable value added and other indirecttaxes paid. Such taxes are refundable under

the terms of Article 3 of the Protocolconcerning the Privileges and Immunities ofthe European Communities, which applies to
the ECB by virtue of Article 40 of the Statuteof the ESCB.8Liabilities to euro area credit
institutions denominated in euroAs at 31 December 2001, except for thosetransactions conducted under the automatic
securities lending programme (see note 18),there were no outstanding repurchaseoperations conducted with euro area credit
institutions in connection with themanagement of the ECB™s own funds.
The principal increase, under the headingﬁLand and buildingsﬂ, relates to capitalised
costs of the ECB™s installations at its second
site, the Eurotheum, transfers from thecategory ﬁAssets under constructionﬂfollowing commencement of use of the assets,
and the acquisition of an official residence forPresidents of the ECB.
7.2Other financial assets
The main components of this item are asfollows:(a)The investment portfolios relating to the
ECB pension fund, which are valued at
53.9 million (2000: 42.9 million). Theassets held represent the investments ofaccumulated pension contributions by theECB and the staff of the ECB as at
31 December 2001, and are managed byan external fund manager. The regularcontributions of the ECB and members
of the plan have been invested on amonthly basis. The assets of the plan arenot fungible with other financial assets of
the ECB, and net income thereon doesnot constitute income of the ECB, but isNet book valueNet book value

9Liabilities to other euro area
residents denominated in euroThis item comprises deposits by members ofthe Euro Banking Association (EBA), whichare used in order to provide the ECB with
collateral in respect of the EBA™s paymentssettled through the TARGET system.10Liabilities to non-euro area
residents denominated in euroThese liabilities principally represent balances
held at the ECB by non-participating NCBs
arising from transactions processed via the
TARGET system (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balancesﬂ
in the notes on accounting policies).11Liabilities to euro area and non-euro
area residents denominated inforeign currencyThese liabilities arise from repurchaseagreements conducted with euro area andnon-euro area residents in connection with
the management of the foreign currencyreserves of the ECB.12Intra-Eurosystem liabilities
These represent the liabilities to participating
NCBs that arose from the transfer of foreignreserve assets to the ECB. The original
liabilities were denominated in euro on a fixedbasis determined by the value of the assets atthe time of their transfer, and are
remunerated at the short-term refinancingrates of the Eurosystem, adjusted to reflect azero return on the gold component (see
ﬁNotes on the Profit and Loss Accountﬂ,note 1). The total liability has increased as aresult of the transfer of such assets by the
Bank of Greece at the beginning of 2001 (see
ﬁEntry of Greece into the euro areaﬂ in thenotes on accounting policies).13Other liabilities
This item consists mainly of interest due to
the NCBs in respect of their claims relatingto the foreign reserves transferred (see
note 12). The ECB™s liabilities in respect
of the pension fund of 
53.9 million (2000:
42.9 million) and other accruals are also
shown under this item.14Provisions
As at 31 December 2000, taking into account
the ECB™s large exposure to exchange rate and
interest rate risk, and the size of its revaluationreserves, it was deemed appropriate to establish

a special provision against these risks amountingto 2,600 million. In accordance with Article49.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Bank
of Greece also contributed an amount of67.7 million in March 2001 to this provision
(see ﬁEntry of Greece into the euro areaﬂin the notes on accounting policies). Thecontinuing requirement for this provision isreviewed on an annual basis.This position also includes administrative
provisions relating to expenditure on goods
and services. Given the ECB™s announcementin 2001 of its intention to acquire a site inthe city of Frankfurt am Main on which toCapital key%Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique2.86581,432,900,000

These accounts represent revaluation reservesarising from unrealised gains on assets andliabilities. The balances include contributions

made by the Bank of Greece in accordance withArticle 49.2 of the Statute of the ESCB (seeﬁEntry of Greece into the euro areaﬂ in the

notes on accounting policies).16Capital and reserves
CapitalThe fully paid-up subscriptions of theparticipating NCBs to the capital of theECB of 5 billion amount to a total of4,049,715,000 as shown below:The non-participating NCBs™ contributions,which represent 5% of the amount which
would be payable if these countries were to
participate in Monetary Union, amount to atotal of 47,514,250 as shown below:These amounts represent contributions tocover the operational costs incurred by theECB in connection with tasks performed forthe non-participating NCBs. The non-
participating NCBs are not required to payup any capital subscriptions beyond the
amounts already decided until such time as
they join the Eurosystem. They are notentitled to receive any share of thedistributable profits of the ECB, nor are they
liable to fund any losses of the ECB.Reserves
In accordance with Article 33 of the Statuteof the ESCB and the Governing Council

decision of 29 March 2001, an amount of398 million of the net profit for the yearending 31 December 2000 was transferred
to the general reserve fund. The remaining
10.4 million included within this caption
relates to the contribution of the Bank of
Greece under Article 49.2 of the Statute ofthe ESCB to the reserves of the ECB (seeﬁEntry of Greece into the euro areaﬂ in thenotes on accounting policies).17Post-balance-sheet events

programmeAs part of the management of the ECB™s ownfunds, the ECB entered into an automatic
securities lending programme agreement in2001, whereby an appointed securities lending
agent enters into securities lendingtransactions on behalf of the ECB with a
number of counterparties, designated by the6ECB Decision of 6 December 2001 on the allocation of monetary
income of the national central banks of participating member
states from the financial year 2002 (ECB/2001/16), OJ L 337,

value of 1.6 billion, were outstanding

policies).19Off-balance-sheet items

Notes on the Profit and Loss Account1Net interest income
This item includes interest income, net ofinterest expense, in respect of the assets and

liabilities denominated in foreign currency,and net interest income on balances arisingfrom TARGET and in respect of other assets
and liabilities denominated in euro. The
remuneration paid to participating NCBs ontheir claims on the ECB in respect of the
foreign reserve assets transferred underArticle 30.1 of the Statute of the ESCB is
disclosed separately.Interest income on foreign reserve assets isdisclosed net of interest expense on foreign
reserve liabilities as follows:The decrease in net interest incomecompared with 2000 is primarily due to lowernet interest income from assets denominated
in US dollars. This decrease was partiallyoffset by higher interest income earned fromremuneration on larger average balances
resulting from TARGET transactions in 2001when compared with 2000.The balances for ﬁOther interest incomeﬂand ﬁOther interest expenseﬂ decreased in2001, due primarily to netting of bilateral
TARGET balances which commenced with
effect from 30 November 2000. All TARGET-
related bilateral balances between the EU
NCBs and the ECB are netted daily at closeof business by novating them to the ECB,leaving each NCB with a single net bilateral
position vis-à-vis the ECB only (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balancesﬂ in the notes on accountingpolicies).2Realised gains/losses arising from
financial operationsNet realised gains arose mainly on sales ofsecurities as a result of normal portfolio
management transactions. The decrease innet realised gains compared with 2000
is primarily due to the fact that, in 2000,
substantial realised gains arose due to the
intervention activity of the ECB in the foreign
exchange markets. The disposal of foreign
currency income earned since the beginningof 1999 was also included in this item. In
2001 no foreign currency intervention activitytook place, and disposals of earningsdenominated in foreign exchange were
suspended.3Write-downs on financial assets and
positionsThis expense is due almost entirely to the
write-down of the acquisition cost ofindividual securities shown in the balance
sheet to their market value as at31 December 2001 due to falls in their
prices in the latter part of 2001 (see ﬁIncome

recognitionﬂ in the notes on accountingpolicies).4Net income from fees and
commissionsThis item consists of the following incomeand expenses. Income arose from penalties
imposed on credit institutions for non-compliance with the minimum reserverequirements.20012000

5Other income
Other miscellaneous income during the yeararose principally from the transfer of unused
administrative provisions to the Profit andLoss Account.6Staff costs
Salaries and allowances of 82 million (2000:67 million) and employer™s contributions to
the ECB™s pension fund and to health andaccident insurance are included under thisheading. The emoluments of the Executive
Board of the ECB amounted to a totalof 1.9 million (2000: 
1.8 million). No
pensions were paid to former members of
the Executive Board or their dependantsduring the year. Salaries and allowances ofstaff, including the emoluments of holders of
senior management positions, are modelledin essence on, and are comparable with, theremuneration scheme of the European
Communities.At the end of 2001, the ECB employed 1,043staff, of whom 75 held managerial positions.The average number of staff employed by theECB in 2001 was 997 compared with 823 in
2000. 176 additional staff were employedduring the period, and 74 members of staffleft the service of the ECB.7The ECB™s retirement plan
In accordance with the rules of the ECB plan,a triennial full actuarial valuation is required.The latest actuarial valuation was carried outas at 31 December 2000, using the ProjectedUnit Credit Method, subject to minimum
liabilities equal to cash lump sums that wouldbe payable to members on termination ofservice.The pension cost relating to the plan is
assessed in accordance with the advice of a
qualified actuary. The total pension costto the ECB including a provision fordisability and post-retirement benefits was
14.9 million (2000: 
13.1 million). Thisincludes a provision for pensions to members
of the Executive Board of 0.7 million(2000: 
0.6 million). The required future
service contribution rate by the ECB is 16.5%of pensionable earnings of all staff.8Administrative expenses
These cover all other current expensesrelating to rental of premises, maintenance of
premises, goods and equipment of a non-capital nature, professional fees and otherservices and supplies, together with staff-
related expenses including recruitment,relocation, installation, training and
resettlement.The increase in administrative expenditure isprimarily due to additional operational costs
associated with the ECB™s second site, the
Eurotheum, and higher consultancy fees, thelatter mainly in connection with the
preparation of the Euro 2002 InformationCampaign.1

202Annexes
204GlossaryAccession countries: there are currently 13 countries in central and eastern Europe and inthe Mediterranean which are recognised by the European Council as candidates for accession
to the European Union (EU). At present, the following 12 countries have formally entered
into accession negotiations: Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Turkey is also an official candidatefor accession, although negotiations have not yet started, and is included in the EconomicDialogue with the EU. When referring to accession countries, the Annual Report refers to
those 12 countries with which negotiations for EU membership are ongoing.Acquis communautaire: term commonly used to refer to all Community law including EU
treaties, regulations and directives. Countries must have implemented the existing acquiscommunautaire by the time of accession.
Benchmark: in relation to investments, a benchmark is a reference portfolio or index
constructed on the basis of the objectives for the liquidity and risk of as well as the return onthe investments. The benchmark serves as a basis for comparison of the performance of the
actual portfolio. In the context of the foreign reserve management of the European CentralBank (ECB), the strategic benchmark is a reference portfolio reflecting the long-term risk/return preferences of the ECB. Its characteristics are amended only in exceptional
circumstances. The tactical benchmark reflects the risk/return preferences of the ECB with a
time horizon of a few months, based on prevailing market conditions. It is reviewed on amonthly basis.Bilateral procedure: a procedure whereby the central bank deals directly with one or onlya few counterparties, without making use of tender procedures. Bilateral proceduresinclude operations executed through stock exchanges or market agents.
Central securities depository (CSD): an entity which holds and administers securities orother financial assets and enables securities transactions to be processed by book entry.Assets may exist either physically (but immobilised within the CSD) or in a dematerialisedform (i.e. only as electronic records).
Collateral: assets pledged as a guarantee for the repayment of loans (e.g. which 
creditinstitutions receive from central banks), as well as assets sold (e.g. to central banks by credit
institutions) as part of repurchase agreements.Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR): the Committee of European
Securities Regulators, which was created in June 2001, is composed of representatives fromthe national authorities regulating the securities markets. It advises the EuropeanCommission on securities policy issues and plays an important role in the transposition of
Community law in the Member States.
Consolidated MFI balance sheet: the consolidated balance sheet of the 
MonetaryFinancial Institution (MFI) sector is obtained by netting out inter-MFI positions (e.g. inter-
MFI loans and deposits) on the aggregated MFI balance sheet. It provides information on the
MFI sector™s assets and liabilities vis-à-vis residents of the 
euro area
 not belonging to this
sector (i.e. general government and other euro area residents) and vis-à-vis non-residents
of the euro area. The consolidated balance sheet is the main statistical source for the
calculation of monetary aggregates and it provides the basis for the regular analysis of the
counterparts of M3.205
Convergence programmes: see 
stability programmes.Copenhagen criteria: the overall criteria which countries have to meet as a prerequisite
for becoming members of the European Union (EU) were defined in general terms by theCopenhagen European Council in June 1993. The Copenhagen criteria require (i) the
stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and the respect
for and protection of minorities; (ii) the existence of a functioning market economy as well asthe capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU; and (iii) theability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political
unification as well as Economic and Monetary Union.Correspondent banking: 
an arrangement whereby one credit institution provides
payment and other services to another credit institution. Payments through correspondentsare often executed through reciprocal accounts (nostro and loro accounts), to which standingcredit lines may be attached. Correspondent banking services are primarily provided across
international boundaries, but are also known as agency relationships in some domesticcontexts. A loro account is the term used by a correspondent to describe an account held on
behalf of a foreign credit institution; the foreign credit institution would in turn regard this

account as its nostro account.Correspondent central banking model (CCBM): a mechanism established by theEuropean System of Central Banks with the aim of enabling counterparties to transfereligible assets as collateral in a cross-border context. In the CCBM, national central banks(NCBs) act as custodians for one another. This means that each NCB has a securities account
in its securities administration for each of the other NCBs (and for the 
European CentralBank).Council of Ministers: see 
EU Council.Counterparty: the opposite party in a financial transaction (e.g. any party transacting with acentral bank).
Credit institution: an institution covered by the definition in Article 1 (1) of Directive
2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to thetaking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions, as amended by Directive2000/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000. Thus, a
credit institution is: (i) an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other
repayable funds from the public and to grant credit for its own account; or (ii) an undertaking
or any other legal person, other than those under (i), which issues means of payment in the
form of electronic money. ﬁElectronic moneyﬂ shall mean monetary value, as represented by aclaim on the issuer, which is: (a) stored on an electronic device; (b) issued on receipt of funds
of an amount not lower in value than the monetary value issued; and (c) accepted as a means
of payment by undertakings other than the issuer.Credit to euro area residents: a broad measure of the financing of non-MonetaryFinancial Institution (MFI) euro area residents (including 
general government and the
private sector) provided by the MFI sector. It is defined as including loans and MFI holdings of
securities. The latter include shares, other equity and debt securities issued by non-MFI euro
area residents. As securities can be seen as an alternative source of funds to loans, and as
some loans can be securitised, this definition provides more accurate information on the total
amount of financing provided by the MFI sector to the economy than a narrow definition
comprising loans only.
206Currency in circulation: comprises banknotes and coins in circulation that are commonly
used to make payments. It includes banknotes denominated in euro and in the legacy
currencies issued by the Eurosystem and by other 
Monetary Financial Institutions(MFIs) in the 
euro area (in Ireland and Luxembourg) as well as the coins issued by some
national central banks of the Eurosystem and by the central government. Throughout the
whole of 2002, currency in circulation will include the legacy currencies of the euro, even

though the euro will have been the sole legal tender in all euro area countries from 1 March2002 onwards. This decision was taken on account of the fact that legacy currencies can easilybe converted into euro at the irrevocably fixed conversion rates. Currency in circulation as
included in M3 is a net concept, i.e. it refers only to banknotes and coins in circulation that
are held outside the MFI sector (as shown on the consolidated MFI balance sheet, i.e.currency issued but held by MFIs Œ ﬁvault cashﬂ Œ has been subtracted). Currency in circulation
does not include a central bank™s stock of own banknotes (as they are not issued), norcommemorative coins that are not commonly used to make payments.Debt ratio: the subject of one of the fiscal convergence criteria laid down in Article 104 (2)
of the Treaty. It is defined as the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product atcurrent market prices, while government debt is defined in Protocol No. 20 (on the excessive
deficit procedure) as the total gross debt at nominal value outstanding at the end of the year
and consolidated between and within the sectors of general government. Generalgovernment is as defined in the European System of Accounts 1995
.Deficit-debt adjustment: the difference between the government deficit and the change in
government debt. Among other reasons, this may arise as a result of changes in the amount of
financial assets held by the government, a change in government debt held by other governmentsub-sectors or statistical adjustments.Deficit ratio: the subject of one of the fiscal convergence criteria laid down in
Article 104 (2) of the 
Treaty. It is defined as the ratio of the planned or actual government
deficit to gross domestic product at current market prices, while the government deficit

is defined in Protocol No. 20 (on the excessive deficit procedure) as net borrowing of
the general government. General government is as defined in the European System ofAccounts 1995.Delivery versus payment (DVP) or delivery against payment system: 
a mechanism ina securities settlement system 
which ensures that the final transfer of assets (securities
or other financial instruments) occurs if, and only if, the final transfer of another asset or
other assets occurs.Deposit facility: a 
standing facility of the 
Eurosystem which 
counterparties may
use to make overnight deposits at a national central bank and which are remunerated at a
pre-specified interest rate (see key ECB interest rates).Deposits redeemable at notice: savings deposits for which the holder must respect a
fixed period of notice before withdrawing the funds. In some cases there is the possibility of
withdrawing a certain fixed amount in a specified period or of earlier withdrawal subject tothe payment of a penalty. Deposits redeemable at a period of notice of up to three monthsare included in M2 (and hence in 
M3), while those with a longer period of notice are part ofthe (non-monetary) longer-term financial liabilities of the Monetary Financial Institution(MFI) sector.
207
Deposits with agreed maturity: mainly time deposits with a given maturity that, depending
on national practices, may be either not convertible prior to maturity or convertible only
subject to a penalty. Some non-marketable debt instruments, such as non-marketable (retail)
certificates of deposit, are also included. Deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two yearsare included in M2 (and hence in 
M3), while those with an agreed maturity of over two yearsare included in the (non-monetary) longer-term financial liabilities of the Monetary FinancialInstitution (MFI) sector.
ECOFIN: see 
EU Council.Economic and Financial Committee: a consultative Community body set up at the start
of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union, when the Monetary Committee wasdissolved. The Member States, the European Commission and the
 European Central
Bank (ECB) each appoint no more than two members of the Committee. One of the two
members appointed by each of the Member States is selected from among senior officials
from the respective national administration and the other from among senior officials fromthe respective national central bank. Article 114 (2) of the Treaty contains a list of the tasksof the Economic and Financial Committee, which include reviewing the economic and financial
situation of the Member States and of the Community.Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): the 
Treaty describes the process of achieving
EMU in the European Union (EU) in three stages. Stage One of EMU started in July 1990 andended on 31 December 1993; it was mainly characterised by the dismantling of all internalbarriers to the free movement of capital within the EU. Stage Two of EMU began on 1 January
1994. It provided for, inter alia, the establishment of the European Monetary Institute,the prohibition of financing of the public sector by the central banks, the prohibition of
privileged access to financial institutions by the public sector and the avoidance of excessive
government deficits. Stage Three started on 1 January 1999 with the transfer of monetarycompetence to the European Central Bank and the introduction of the 
euro. The cashchangeover on 1 January 2002 completed the set-up of EMU.ECU (European Currency Unit): the ECU was a basket currency made up of the sum of
fixed amounts of 12 of the 15 currencies of the EU Member States. The value of the ECU was

calculated as a weighted average of the value of its component currencies. The ECU wasreplaced by the euro on a one-for-one basis on 1 January 1999.
Effective (nominal/real) exchange rates (EERs): nominal EERs consist of a geometric
weighted average of various bilateral exchange rates. Real EERs are nominal EERs deflated bya weighted average of foreign, relative to domestic, prices or costs. They are thus measures
of price and cost competitiveness. The 
European Central Bank calculates nominal EER
indices for the euro against the currencies of a narrow and a broad group of trading partners
of the euro area. As from January 2001, the narrow group consists of 12 industrial and newlyindustrialised partner countries, while the broad group is made up of 38 trading partners
including emerging market economies and economies in transition. The real EER indices for
the euro are calculated using alternative measures of prices and costs.
Electronic money (e-money): an electronic store of monetary value on a technical devicethat may be widely used for making payments to undertakings other than the issuer without
necessarily involving bank accounts in the transaction, but acting as a prepaid bearer instrument(see also multi-purpose prepaid card).
208EMU: see 
Economic and Monetary Union.EONIA (euro overnight index average): a measure of the effective interest rate prevailingin the euro interbank overnight market. It is calculated as a weighted average of the interest
rates on unsecured overnight lending transactions denominated in euro, as reported by apanel of contributing banks.
ERM II (exchange rate mechanism II): the exchange rate arrangement which provides
the framework for exchange rate policy co-operation between the euro area and EU
Member States not participating in the euro area from the start of Stage Three of Economicand Monetary Union. Membership of the mechanism is voluntary. Nevertheless, MemberStates with a derogation are expected to join the mechanism. Currently, the Danish krone
participates in ERM II with a fluctuation band around the central rate against the euro of
±2.25%. Foreign exchange intervention and financing at the margins of the standard ornarrower fluctuation bands are, in principle, automatic and unlimited, with very short-term
financing available. The European Central Bank
 and the participating non-euro area national
central banks could, however, suspend automatic intervention if this were to conflict withtheir primary objective of maintaining price stability.EU Council: an institution of the European Community. It is made up of representatives of
the governments of the Member States, normally the ministers responsible for the matters
under consideration (therefore often referred to as the Council of Ministers). The EUCouncil meeting in the composition of the ministers of finance and economy is often referred
to as the ECOFIN Council. In addition, the EU Council may meet in the composition of the
Heads of State or Government (see also European Council).EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate): the rate at which a prime bank is willing to lend
funds in euro to another prime bank. The EURIBOR is computed daily for interbank deposits
with a maturity of one to three weeks and one to 12 months as the average of the daily offerrates of a representative panel of prime banks, rounded to three decimal places.Euro: the name of the European currency adopted by the European Council at its meetingin Madrid on 15 and 16 December 1995 and used instead of the term 
ECU employed in theTreaty.Euro area: the area encompassing those Member States in which the 
euro has been adopted
as the single currency in accordance with the Treaty and in which a single monetary policy isconducted under the responsibility of the 
Governing Council of the 
European CentralBank. The euro area currently comprises Belgium, Germany, Greece (which joined on 1January 2001), Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal
and Finland.
Euro Banking Association (EBA): an organisation which provides a forum for exploring
and debating all issues of interest to its members and, in particular, matters pertaining to theuse of the euro and the settlement of transactions in euro. The EBA established a clearing
company (ABE Clearing, Société par Actions Simplifiée à capital variable) for the purposeof managing the Euro Clearing System as from 1 January 1999. The Euro Clearing System(Euro 1) is the successor to the ECU Clearing and Settlement System.Euro central rate:
 the official exchange rate of 
ERM II member currencies vis-à-vis theeuro, around which the ERM II fluctuation margins are defined.209
Eurogroup: informal grouping bringing together those members of the 
ECOFIN Council
who represent the Member States of the euro area. It meets on a regular basis (usually priorto meetings of the ECOFIN Council) to discuss issues connected with the euro area Member
States™ shared responsibilities for the single currency. The European Commission and,
when appropriate, the European Central Bank are invited to take part in these meetings.
European Central Bank (ECB): the ECB lies at the centre of the

Executive Board, and, as a third decision-making body, by the General Council.European Commission (Commission of the European Communities): the institutionof the European Community which ensures the application of the provisions of the Treaty.The Commission develops Community policies, proposes Community legislation and exercisespowers in specific areas. In the area of economic policy, the Commission recommends broad
guidelines for economic policies in the Community and reports to the EU Council

economic developments and policies. It monitors public finances within the framework ofmultilateral surveillance and submits reports to the Council. It consists of 20 members and
includes two nationals each from Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, and
one from each of the other Member States.European Council: provides the European Union with the necessary impetus for its
development and defines the general political guidelines thereof. It brings together the Heads
of State or Government of the Member States and the President of the 
EuropeanCommission (see also 
EU Council
).European Monetary Institute (EMI): a temporary institution established at the start ofStage Two of Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January 1994. The two main tasks of
the EMI were to strengthen central bank co-operation and monetary policy co-ordination andto make the preparations required for the establishment of the European System ofCentral Banks, for the conduct of the single monetary policy and for the creation of a singlecurrency in Stage Three. It went into liquidation following the establishment of the 
EuropeanCentral Bank on 1 June 1998.
European Parliament:
 consists of 626 representatives of the citizens of the Member States.
It is a part of the legislative process, although with different prerogatives according to the
procedures through which EU law is to be enacted. In the framework of 
Economic andMonetary Union, the Parliament has mainly consultative powers. However, the Treatyestablishes certain procedures for the democratic accountability of the European CentralBank to the Parliament (presentation of the annual report, general debate on the monetary
policy, testimonies before the competent parliamentary committees).European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95): a system of uniform statistical definitionsand classifications aimed at achieving a harmonised quantitative description of the economiesof the Member States. The ESA 95 is the Community™s version of the world System of
National Accounts 1993 (SNA 93). The ESA 95 is a new version of the European system,
implementation of which began in the course of 1999 in accordance with Council Regulation(EC) No. 2223/96.
210European System of Central Banks (ESCB):
 is composed of the 
European CentralBank (ECB) and the national central banks of all 15 Member States, i.e. it includes, in
addition to the members of the Eurosystem, the national central banks of the MemberStates which have not yet adopted the euro. The ESCB is governed by the GoverningCouncil and the 
Executive Board of the ECB, and, as a third decision-making body of the
ECB, by the General Council.Eurostat: the Statistical Office of the European Communities. Eurostat is part of the
European Commission and is responsible for the production of Community statistics.
EURO STOXX: STOXX Limited (www.stoxx.com) publishes the Dow Jones STOXX indices
which measure stock price developments in Europe as a whole. The Dow Jones EURO
STOXX index is one member of this index family. This index aggregates the prices of a broadrange of stocks from those countries belonging to the euro area. Furthermore, three typesof sector index (economic and market sectors as well as industry groups) are available for the

Dow Jones EURO STOXX index.
Eurosystem: comprises the 
European Central Bank (ECB) 
and the national centralbanks (NCBs) of the Member States which have adopted the euro in Stage Three of
Economic and Monetary Union (see also euro area

the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem is governed by the Governing Council and the 
ExecutiveBoard of the ECB.Eurosystem™s foreign exchange liquidity position: this comprises the
 Eurosystem™s
international reserves and the Eurosystem™s other foreign currency claims and liabilities,including positions vis-à-vis euro area residents such as foreign exchange deposits placed
with banking institutions resident in the euro area.
Eurosystem™s  international reserves:
 the reserve assets of the 
euro area consist of the
Eurosystem™s reserve assets, i.e. the reserve assets of the European Central Bank
(ECB) and the reserve assets held by the national central banks (NCBs) of the participating
Member States. Reserve assets must be under the effective control of the relevant monetaryauthority, whether the ECB or the NCB of one of the participating Member States, and refer
to highly liquid, marketable and creditworthy foreign (non-euro) currency-denominatedclaims on non-residents of the euro area, plus gold, special drawing rights and the reservepositions in the International Monetary Fund of the participating NCBs.Executive Board: one of the decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank(ECB). It comprises the President and the Vice-President of the ECB and four other

States which have adopted the euro.Fair Value Accounting (FVA): a valuation principle that stipulates the use of either a
market price, where it exists, or an estimation of a market price as the present value ofexpected cash flows, to set the balance sheet value of financial instruments.Fine-tuning operation: a non-regular open market operation executed by the
Eurosystem mainly in order to deal with unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market.
Foreign exchange swap: simultaneous spot and forward transactions exchanging one
currency against another. The Eurosystem can execute open market operations in the form211

of the national central banks of the Member States which have adopted the euro.Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP): the measure of prices used by theGoverning Council for the purpose of assessing 
price stability. The HICP was developedby the European Commission (Eurostat) in close liaison with the national statisticalinstitutes and the European Monetary Institute, and later the European Central Bank,in order to fulfil the Treaty requirement for a consumer price index constructed on a
comparable basis, taking into account differences in national definitions.Implied interest rate volatility: a measure of expected volatility in future short and long-
term interest rates, which can be extracted from option prices. Given the observed market
price of an option, the implied volatility can be extracted using a standard option pricingformula which explicitly depends on, inter alia, the expected volatility of the underlying asset
price during the period until the option expires. The underlying assets can be futurescontracts on short-term interest rates, such as the three-month 
EURIBOR, or on long-termbonds such as ten-year German Bunds. Given appropriate assumptions, the implied volatility
may be interpreted as the market™s expectation of volatility during the remaining life of theoption.Interbank funds transfer system (IFTS): 
a funds transfer system
 in which most (or
all) direct participants are credit institutions.Interlinking mechanism: one of the components of the 
TARGET system. The term is
used to designate the infrastructures and procedures which link domestic RTGS systems inorder to process cross-border payments within TARGET.International investment position (i.i.p.) (or external asset or liability position):the value and composition of the stock of an economy™s financial claims on and financial
liabilities to the rest of the world. At present, the euro area i.i.p. is compiled on a net basis,
from aggregated national data.
212Key ECB interest rates: the interest rates which reflect the stance of the monetary policyof the European Central Bank (ECB) and which are set by the Governing Council. Thekey ECB interest rates are at present the minimum bid rate on the 
main refinancingoperations, the interest rate on the 
marginal lending facility
 and the interest rate on the
deposit facility.Large-value payments: payments, generally of very large amounts, which are mainlyexchanged between banks or between participants in the financial markets and usually require
urgent and timely settlement.
Link between securities settlement systems: the procedures and arrangements between
two securities settlement systems for the cross-border transfer of securities through a
book-entry process.Longer-term refinancing operation:
 a regular 
open market operation
 executed by the
Eurosystem in the form of a reverse transaction. Longer-term refinancing operations arecarried out through monthly standard tenders and have a maturity of three months.
Loss-sharing rule (or agreement): an agreement between participants in a transfer
system or a clearing house arrangement regarding the allocation of any loss arising when oneor more participants fail to fulfil their obligations; the agreement stipulates how the loss will
be shared among the parties concerned in the event of its being activated.Lump-sum allowance: a fixed amount which an institution deducts in the calculation of its
reserve requirement within the minimum reserve framework of the 
Eurosystem.M1, M2, M3: see monetary aggregates.Main refinancing operation: a regular open market operation
 executed by the
Eurosystem in the form of a 
reverse transaction. Main refinancing operations areconducted through weekly standard tenders and normally have a maturity of two weeks.
Maintenance period: the period over which 
credit institutions™ compliance with reserverequirements is calculated. The maintenance period for 
Eurosystem minimum reserves is
one month, starting on the 24th calendar day of one month and ending on the 23rd calendarday of the following month.Marginal lending facility: a 
standing facility of the 
Eurosystem which 
counterpartiesmay use to receive overnight credit from a national central bank at a pre-specified interest
rate against eligible assets (see key ECB interest rates).Minimum bid rate: the lower limit to the interest rates at which 
counterparties maysubmit bids in the variable rate tenders on the main refinancing operations. As a 
key ECBinterest rate it plays, at present, the role previously covered by the rate in fixed rate
tenders (see key ECB interest rates).Monetary aggregates: currency in circulation plus outstanding amounts of certain
liabilities of Monetary Financial Institutions and central government (Post Office, Treasury)
that have a high degree of ﬁmoneynessﬂ (or liquidity in a broad sense). The narrow monetary
aggregate M1 has been defined as currency in circulation plus 
overnight deposits. Theﬁintermediateﬂ monetary aggregate M2 comprises M1 plus 
deposits with agreed maturity213
of up to two years and deposits redeemable at notice of up to three months. The broad
monetary aggregate M3 includes M2 plus 
repurchase agreements, money market fundshares/units, money market paper and debt securities with a maturity of up to two years. The
Governing Council has announced a reference value for the growth of M3 (see also
reference value for monetary growth).Monetary Financial Institutions (MFIs): financial institutions which form the money-
creating sector of the 
euro area. These include central banks, resident credit institutionsas defined in Community law and all other resident financial institutions whose business is to
receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from entities other than MFIs and, for
their own account (at least in economic terms), to grant credit and/or invest in securities. Thelatter group consists predominantly of money market funds. At the end of 2001, there
were 8,868 MFIs in the euro area (the European Central Bank, 12 national central banks,
7,218 credit institutions, 1,631 money market funds and six other financial institutions).
Monetary policy strategy: the monetary policy strategy of the European Central Bank(ECB) rests on the quantitative definition of 
price stability and two analytical frameworks
(ﬁpillarsﬂ) which contribute to assessing the risks to future price stability. The first pillar
assigns a prominent role to money Œ monetary and credit developments are thoroughlyanalysed for their information content. It includes a reference value for monetary growth anda number of models in which monetary and credit developments play a role in determining or
projecting price developments. The second pillar consists of the analysis of a wide range ofother economic and financial variables. It includes various models in which cost pressures andthe relationship between supply and demand in goods, service and labour markets determine

price developments.Money market: the market in which short-term funds are raised, invested and traded usinginstruments which generally have an original maturity of up to one year.Multi-purpose prepaid card: a stored value card which can be used for a wide range of
payment purposes and which has the potential to be used on a national or international scale,but which may sometimes be restricted to a certain area. A reloadable multi-purpose prepaidcard is also known as an electronic purse (see also electronic money).Net settlement system (NSS): 
a funds transfer system, the settlement operations of
which are completed on a bilateral or multilateral net basis.Open market operation: an operation executed on the initiative of the central bank in thefinancial markets involving one of the following transactions: (i) buying or selling assets
outright (spot or forward); (ii) buying or selling assets under a repurchase agreement;(iii) lending or borrowing against underlying assets as collateral; (iv) issuing central bankdebt certificates; (v) accepting fixed-term deposits; or (vi) conducting foreign exchangeswaps between domestic and foreign currencies.
Option: an option is a financial instrument which gives the owner the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell a specific underlying asset (e.g. a bond or a stock) at a predeterminedprice (the strike or exercise price) at or up to a certain future date (the exercise or maturitydate). A call option gives the holder the right to purchase the underlying asset at an agreed
exercise price, whereas a put option gives the holder the right to sell it at an agreed exerciseprice.
214Outright transaction:
 a transaction whereby assets are bought or sold up to their maturity
(spot or forward).Overnight deposits: deposits with next-day maturity. This instrument category comprises
mainly those sight/demand deposits which are fully transferable (by cheque or similarinstrument). It also includes non-transferable deposits that are convertible on demand or by
close of business the following day.Payment versus payment (PVP): a mechanism in a foreign exchange settlement system
which ensures that a final transfer of one currency occurs if, and only if, a final transfer of theother currency or currencies takes place.Price stability: the maintenance of price stability is the primary objective of the 
EuropeanCentral Bank. The Governing Council has published a quantitative definition of price
stability in order to give clear guidance to expectations of future price developments and to
be accountable. The Governing Council defines price stability as a year-on-year increase inthe Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%.
The Governing Council announced that price stability according to this definition is to be
maintained over the medium term. The definition delineates an upper boundary for the rateof measured inflation; at the same time, the use of the word ﬁincreaseﬂ signals that deflation,i.e. prolonged declines in the level of the HICP, would not be deemed consistent with price
stability.Primary balance: government net borrowing or net lending excluding interest payments onconsolidated government liabilities.Projections: the results of exercises conducted by 
Eurosystem staff to project possible
future macroeconomic developments in the 
euro area. Euro area projections are obtained ina way consistent with individual country projections. The projections, which are publishedtwice a year, form part of the second pillar of the 
monetary policy strategy of the
European Central Bank and are one of several inputs into the Governing Council™sassessment of the risks to price stability.Quick tender: the tender procedure used by the Eurosystem for 
fine-tuning operations.Quick tenders are executed within a time frame of one hour and are restricted to a limitedset of counterparties.Realignment: a change in the central parity of a currency participating in an exchange ratesystem with a fixed but adjustable peg. In ERM II a realignment consists of a change in the
euro central rate.Re-denomination of securities: the denomination of a security is the currency in which
the par value of the security is expressed (in most cases, the face value of a certificate).Re-denomination refers to a procedure through which the original denomination of a security,issued in a national currency, is changed into euro at the irrevocably fixed conversion rate.
Reference value for monetary growth: the 
Governing Council assigns money aprominent role in the conduct of the monetary policy, implying that monetary aggregatesand their counterparts are thoroughly analysed regarding their information content for futureprice developments. This is signalled by the announcement of a reference value for thegrowth rate of the monetary aggregate M3. The reference value is derived in a manner which215
is consistent with and serves the achievement of the Governing Council™s definition ofprice stability on the basis of medium-term assumptions regarding trend real GDP growth
and the trend in the velocity of circulation of M3. Substantial or prolonged deviations of M3
growth from the reference value would, under normal circumstances, signal risks to pricestability over the medium term. However, the concept of the reference value does not entail
a commitment on the part of the Governing Council to correct mechanistically deviations of
M3 growth from the reference value.Reference value for the fiscal position: Treaty Protocol No. 20 on the excessive deficit
procedure sets explicit reference values for the general government deficit ratio (3% of
GDP) and the debt ratio
 (60% of GDP) (see also 
Stability and Growth Pact).Remote access (to an IFTS): the facility enabling a 
credit institution established in one
country (ﬁhome countryﬂ) to become a direct participant in an interbank funds transfersystem (IFTS) established in another country (ﬁhost countryﬂ) and, for that purpose, to
have a settlement account in its own name with the central bank in the host country withoutnecessarily having established a branch in that country.Repurchase agreement: an arrangement whereby an asset is sold but the seller has a rightand an obligation to repurchase it at a specific price on a future date or on demand. Such anagreement is similar to collateralised borrowing, but differs in that ownership of the securities
is not retained by the seller. The Eurosystem uses repurchase agreements with a fixed
maturity in its reverse transactions. Repurchase transactions are included in M3 in cases
where the seller is a 
Monetary Financial Institution (MFI)
 and the 
counterparty is a
non-MFI resident in the euro area
. According to the Regulation of the ECB concerning theconsolidated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions sector (ECB/2001/13, replacing
ECB/1998/16), repurchase operations (repos) are classified as deposit liabilities since they
are not marketable.Repurchase operation (repo): a liquidity-providing 
reverse transaction based on a
repurchase agreement.Reserve base: the sum of the balance sheet items (in particular liabilities) which constitutethe basis for calculating the reserve requirement of a 
credit institution.Reserve ratio: a ratio defined by the central bank for each category of balance sheet itemsincluded in the reserve base. The ratios are used to calculate reserve requirements.Reserve requirement: the requirement for credit institutions to hold minimum reserves
with the central bank. In the minimum reserve framework of the 
Eurosystem, the reserverequirement of a credit institution is calculated by multiplying the 
reserve ratio for each
category of items within the reserve base by the amount of those items on the institution™s
balance sheet. In addition, institutions are allowed to deduct a lump-sum allowance from
their reserve requirement.Reverse transaction: an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under arepurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against 
collateral.RTGS (real-time gross settlement) system: a settlement system in which processingand settlement take place on an order-by-order basis (without netting) in real time(continuously). See also TARGET.
216Securities settlement system (SSS): a system which permits the holding and transfer of
securities or other financial assets, either free of payment (FOP) or against payment (deliveryversus payment).Settlement agent: an institution that manages the settlement process (e.g. the determinationof settlement positions, monitoring of exchange of payments, etc.) for transfer systems or
other arrangements that require settlement.Settlement risk: a general term used to designate the risk that settlement in a transfer
system will not take place as expected. This risk may comprise both credit and liquidity risk.
Stability and Growth Pact: consists of two 
EU Council
 Regulations on (i) the
strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and co-ordinationof economic policies and on (ii) speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessivedeficit procedure, and of a European Council Resolution on the Stability and Growth Pact
adopted at the Amsterdam summit on 17 June 1997. It is intended to serve as a means ofsafeguarding sound government finances in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union(EMU) in order to strengthen the conditions for 
price stability and for strong, sustainable
growth conducive to employment creation. More specifically, budgetary positions close tobalance or in surplus are required as the medium-term objective for Member States, whichwould allow them to deal with normal cyclical fluctuations while keeping the government
deficit below the 
reference value of 3% of GDP. In accordance with the Stability and
Growth Pact, countries participating in EMU will report stability programmes, while non-
participating countries will continue to provide convergence programmes.Stability programmes: medium-term government plans and assumptions provided by 
euroarea Member States regarding the development of key economic variables towards the
achievement of the medium-term objective of a budgetary position close to balance or in
surplus as referred to in the Stability and Growth Pact. Measures to consolidate fiscalbalances as well as underlying economic scenarios are highlighted. Stability programmes must
be updated annually. They are examined by the European Commission and the 
Economicand Financial Committee, whose reports serve as the basis for an assessment by theECOFIN Council, focusing, in particular, on whether the medium-term budgetary objective
in the programme provides for an adequate safety margin to ensure the avoidance of an
excessive deficit. Countries not participating in the euro area must submit annual convergenceprogrammes, in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact.Standard tender: a tender procedure used by the 
Eurosystem in its regular 
openmarket operations. Standard tenders are carried out within 24 hours. All counterpartiesfulfilling the general eligibility criteria are entitled to submit bids.Standing facility: a central bank facility available to counterparties on their own initiative.
The Eurosystem offers two overnight standing facilities: the 
marginal lending facility
 and
the deposit facility.Structural operation: an open market operation executed by the 
Eurosystem mainlyin order to adjust the structural liquidity position of the financial sector vis-à-vis theEurosystem.217
Sub-frontloading: the distribution of 
euro banknotes and/or coins by credit institutionsto certain target groups (e.g. retailers, cash-in-transit companies, the cash-operated machineindustry and the general public) prior to 2002.TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement ExpressTransfer system): the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system for the euro. It is adecentralised system consisting of 15 national RTGS systems
 and the ECB payment mechanism.
These are interconnected by common procedures (Interlinking mechanism) to allow
cross-border transfers throughout the EU to move from one system to another.Tier one asset: a marketable asset fulfilling certain uniform euro area
-wide eligibilitycriteria specified by the ECB.Tier two asset: a marketable or non-marketable asset fulfilling specific eligibility criteria
established by a national central bank, subject to ECB approval.Treaty: refers to the Treaty establishing the European Community. The Treaty was signed in
Rome on 25 March 1957 and entered into force on 1 January 1958. It established the
European Economic Community (EEC), which is now the European Community (EC), and is
often referred to as the ﬁTreaty of Romeﬂ. The Treaty on European Union (which is oftenreferred to as the ﬁMaastricht Treatyﬂ) was signed on 7 February 1992 and entered into force

on 1 November 1993. The Treaty on European Union amended the Treaty establishing theEuropean Community and established the European Union. The ﬁTreaty of Amsterdamﬂ,which was signed in Amsterdam on 2 October 1997 and entered into force on 1 May 1999,

amended both the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Treaty on EuropeanUnion. Equally, the ﬁTreaty of Niceﬂ, which concluded the 2000 Intergovernmental Conferenceand was signed on 26 February 2001, will further amend the Treaty establishing the European
Community and the Treaty on European Union, once it is ratified and enters into force.
UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System): system for ﬁthird generationﬂ
mobile telecommunication. Licences for mobile telecommunication frequencies are sold orawarded by EU governments to telecommunications companies.
Valuation haircut: a risk control measure applied to underlying assets used in 
reversetransactions, in which the central bank calculates the value of underlying assets as theirmarket value reduced by a certain percentage (haircut). The Eurosystem applies valuation
haircuts reflecting features of the specific assets, such as their residual maturity.Variation margin (or marking to market): the Eurosystem requires that a specified
margin be maintained over time on the underlying assets used in reverse transactions. Thisimplies that if the regularly measured market value of the underlying assets falls below acertain level, counterparties have to supply additional assets (or cash). Similarly, if the
market value of the underlying assets, following their revaluation, were to exceed the amountowed by a counterparty plus the variation margin, the central bank would return excessassets (or cash) to the counterparty.

Monetary policy chronology2 January 2001On 1 January 2001 the euro is introduced in
Greece. Greece thus becomes the twelfth
EU Member State to adopt the singlecurrency and the first to do so since the startof Stage Three of Economic and Monetary

Union (EMU) on 1 January 1999. As a result,the Bank of Greece becomes a full memberof the Eurosystem, with the same rights and

obligations as the 11 national central banks
of the EU Member States which previously
adopted the euro. In accordance with
Article 49 of the Statute of the EuropeanSystem of Central Banks and of the EuropeanCentral Bank, the Bank of Greece pays up
the remainder of its contribution to thecapital of the ECB, as well as its share of theECB™s reserves, and also transfers to the ECB
its contribution to the foreign reserve assetsof the ECB.4 January 2001The Governing Council of the ECB decides
that the minimum bid rate on the mainrefinancing operations and the interest rates
on the marginal lending facility and thedeposit facility will remain unchanged at4.75%, 5.75% and 3.75% respectively. In
addition, it decides on an allotment amount
of 20 billion per operation for the longer-
term refinancing operations to be conducted
in 2001. This amount takes into considerationthe expected liquidity needs of the euro areabanking system in 2001 and the desire of the

Eurosystem to continue to provide the bulkof refinancing to the financial sector throughits main refinancing operations.18 January, 1 February, 15 February,1 March, 15 March, 29 March, 11 April,

operations to be conducted in 2002. This
amount takes into consideration the expectedliquidity needs of the euro area banking
system in 2002 and the desire of theEurosystem to continue to provide the bulkof refinancing to the financial sector through
its main refinancing to operations. TheGoverning Council makes provision for thefact that it may adjust the allotment amount
in the course of the year in the event ofunexpected developments in liquidity needs.7 February, 7 March 2002The Governing Council of the ECB decides
that the minimum bid rate on the mainrefinancing operations and the interest rates
