Economic Activity Continues to Firm UpEurope continues to enjoy a strong growth 
spurt. Growth has ˜rmed up in many European 

economies, including all the major ones except 

the United Kingdom
. Also, activity has broadened: 

for the ˜rst time since the global ˜nancial crisis 
all economies are growing. Real GDP increased 

by 2.8
 percent in 2017, up from 1.8
 percent in 
2016. ˚e expansion is largely driven by domestic 

demand (Figure
 1.1, panel 1), initially mainly by vibrant private consumption but now also b
y investment (Figure
 1.1, panel 3; Box
 1.1). Ł Advanced European economies 
grew by 
2.4 percent in 2017, up from 1.9
 percent 
in 2016 (Figure
 1.1, panel 2). ˚e upward 
revision of 0.2
 percentage point since the 
Nov
ember 2017 Regional Economic Outlook: 
Europe
 is due to higher-than-expected net 
exports growth (Figure
 1.1, panel 4). oIn the 
euro area
, quarterly growth has been 
positive for the last 19 quarters, and annual 

growth in 2017 reached 2.3
 percent, up 
from 1.8
 percent in 2016. ˚e recov
ery is 
broad-based across countries and sectors, 

with a positive feedback loop between jobs, 

consumption, and investment. Moderate but 

sustained rises in wages and real disposable 

income and recovering asset prices are 

boosting household incomes and wealth. 

In 
Germany
, household consumption grew 

by 2.1
 percent in 2017, the largest increase 
since 2000. Business inv

 oNordic economies
 expanded by 2.2
 percent 
in 2017, broadly the same as in 2016. 

Sw
eden enjoyed robust growth, with 
unemployment declining to near precrisis 

low levels. However, weaker-than-forecast 

net exports in the second half of 2017 

resulted in a downward revision of growth to 

2.4 percent in 2017, from 3.1
 percent in the 
Nov
ember 2017 Regional Economic Outlook: 
Europe
. Norway™s 
economy accelerated to 
1.8 percent in 2017 from 1.1
 percent in 
2016, supported by the r
ecovery of business 
investment, stronger consumer spending, 

and higher oil prices. oGrowth in 
other advanced European economies 
was largely unchanged at 2 percent in 2017. 
In the
 United Kingdom, GDP growth slowed 
to 1.7 percent in 2017. Domestic demand 
is being held back by slo
wer real income 
growth following the sharp depreciation 

of the pound as well as Brexit-related 

uncertainties that held back investment. 

However, favorable foreign demand and a 

cheaper pound led to a rise in exports of 

goods and services. In contrast, economic 

activity in the Czech Republic
 surged to 
4.3 percent in 2017, due to strong private 
demand and increased absorption of the new round of EU Structural and Investment 

Funds (Figure
 1.2). Ł In most of 
emerging Europe,
 the strong 
cyclical upswing that took hold several 

years ago continued. ˚e region more than 

doubled its annual real GDP growth rate

and Southeastern Europe). 
In 2017,
 EU funds ˜nanced an equivalent of about half of 

public investment in 
Romania 
and Hungary, 

and a third elsewhere (Figure
 1.2). Growth 
was further supported by discretionary ˜scal 
spending in Poland
 and procyclical ˜scal 

policy in Romania
. oIn 
Turkey
, growth accelerated sharply to 
7 percent in 2017, from 3.2
 percent the 
previous year
. A sizable credit impulse 
(driven by state loan guarantees and relaxed 

macroprudential measures) and strong policy 

stimulus in the wake of the 2016 coup 
attempt stimulated domestic demand. In 

addition, exports increased considerably on 

the back of stronger external demand and a 

sizable depreciation of the lira.
 oRussia™s 
oil-dependent economy expanded 
by 1.5 percent in 2017, supported by 
higher oil prices, easier domestic ˜nancial 
conditions, and improved domestic demand. 
However, momentum softened in the 

second half of 2017. Economic activity in 

the other members of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS)
 also picked up in 
2017 to 2.2 percent, with 
Belar
us bouncing back from a two-year recession and recording 

growth of 2.4
 percent.
 oGrowth moderated in the 
Western Balkan
 countries to 2.3 percent in 2017 from 
3.1 percent in 2016, re˝ecting mainly 
a temporary slo
wdown in 
Serbia
 caused by a prolonged drought and electricity 

disruptions.
In addition to upward revisions to growth, the 

pickup in investment has also led to higher 

estimates of potential growth in 2018, by 

0.2 percentage point in 
advanced E
urope 
and by 0.1 percentage point
 in emerging Europe
. While the estimates of potential growth and output gaps 

are uncertain (November 2017 
Regional Economic 

Outlook: Europe
), output gaps appear largely closed 
in most of the region (Figure
 1.3). Howev
er, a 
broader set of indicators paints a mixed picture 

of overheating pressures in the largest European 

economies (Table

buoyant activity and unemployment rates below 
historical averages, with the notable exception 

of France, Italy
, and Spain
. Output is above 

precrisis levels but still below precrisis trend in 

most countries. However, in˝ation remains below 

central bank targets almost everywhere (partly 

re˝ecting slack, as discussed in Chapter
 2), except 
in Tur
key and the United Kingdom
. Also, external indicators generally do not suggest overheating. 

Similarly, indicators of ˜nancial stability appear 

mostly benign, with a few exceptions (including 

high credit growth in 
Turkey 
and a rapid increase 

in house prices in Romania
).High-frequency data and indicators point to 
continued expansion in the near term, though 
likely with fewer upward surprises. Manufacturing 

purchasing managers™ indices (PMIs) remain ˜rmly 

in expansion territory (Figure
 1.4). Howev
er, the 
March readings softened from their long string of 

gains. Russia™s
 PMI came in barely above 50, and 

the composite index for the euro area
 has declined 
by a cumulative 4 points since the end of 2017Š

the largest three-month decrease since May 2012. 

Similarly, con˜dence among 
euro area
 and Nordic
 
households eased in March, though it remains 
historically high. Hard data paint a similar picture: 

the trends remain favorable, but there is some 

softening. Industrial output continued to expand 

in January 2018 at about 3.6
 percent in 
advanced 
Europe
 and 4.6 percent in 
emerging Eur
ope, but the most recent growth rates are lower than in the 

second half of 2017. In 
Germany
, industrial orders 

fell almost 4 percent, and factory sales edged down 
0.2 percent month over month in J
anuary 2018. 
Looking ahead, Citigroup™s Economic Surprise 

Index suggests that upside surprises are now less 

frequent than last year, especially in the 
euro area
 
(Figure
 1.5). 

Pace in Eastern EuropePrice pressures are diverging across the region, but 
this is mostly visible in headline rates, owing to 

di˛erent weights of energy and food in household 

consumption baskets. In˝ation rates are low 

in advanced Europe
 but gradually closing in or 
surpassing targets in eastern Europe
. But even

there, core in˝ation is still quite low in most 
economies, despite higher wage growth.
Ł In many 
advanced Eur
opean economies, in˝ation remains subdued (Figure
 1.6, panel 1). In the 
euro ar
ea, headline in˝ation declined to 1.1 percent in Februar
y 2018, below the European Central Bank™s (ECB™s) 
target, most recently re˝ecting mainly lower 

food prices. On the back of sluggish wage 

growth, core in˝ation remains low (Figure
 1.6, panel 2). In˝ation is similarly subdued in the 

Nordic economies
, with readings at 1.5
 percent 
in Februar
y 2018. By contrast, in˝ation in 
the United Kingdom
 reached 2.7
 percent in 
Februar
y 2018. Ł In other advanced European economies, 

in˝ation has risen moderately, with the impact of high wage growth becoming increasingly 

visible. In the 
Czech Republic
, in˝ation 
surpassed the 2 percent target of the central 
bank starting in early 2017 before declining 
at the beginning of this year. In the 
Baltics
, in˝ation reached almost 4
 percent in the 
second quarter of 2017, but then dropped to 

2.8 percent in Februar
y 2018.Ł Regarding
 emerging Eur
ope, headline in˝ation in Central
 and Southeastern Europe
 increased 

appreciably to about 2
 percent at the end of 
2017, mostly owing to higher energy prices. 

Core in˝ation, ho
wever, while inching up, 
remains subdued at about 1
 percent despite 
strong wage gro
wth. In
 Poland
, headline in˝ation hit 2.5 percentŠthe central bank™s 
targetŠin November 2017 but has fallen 
since then, and core in˝ation has hovered 

around 0.8
 percent in recent months. Among 
the Southeastern Europe
 (SEE) economies, headline in˝ation has increased steeply 

in Romania
 as the e˛ects of tax and other 
administrative adjustments are dissipating. In 

the non-EU SEE economies, headline in˝ation, 
after picking up sharply to 2½ percent in 
mid-2017, declined somewhat in the second 

half of 2017, as in˝ation in Serbia fell to 3 percent. Core in˝ation remains r
elatively 
low at about 1
 percent in
 SEE countries.Ł In 
Russia
, in˝ation has declined further amid tight monetary policy, a weaker-than-expected 

recovery, and a good harvest. ˚e decline 

continues to be broad-based, and both 

headline and core in˝ation reached record 

lows of 2.2 and 2
 percent, respectively
, during JanuaryŒFebruary 2018.
Ł In contrast, in˝ation remains elevated in 

Tur
key, re˝ecting strong domestic demand, 
expansionary ˜scal and insu˙ciently tight 

monetary policies, and the pass-through 

of lira depreciation. Core in˝ation has 

picked up noticeably to about 12 percent 
in recent months, from about 10
 percent in 
August 2017.

Different Wage Dynamics 
Continue across Europe: 



Wage growth continues to be low in most of 
advanced Europe,
 but is strong in the rest of the 

region owing to tighter labor supply (Figure
 1.7). While employment growth has been r
obust and there are notable reductions in indicators of labor 
market slack, wage growth is still subdued in 

the euro area 
and many other advanced European 

economies. However, recent wage negotiations 

in some euro area economies
 (such as Germany
) 
suggest that employers are willing to accommodate 

demands for higher wage growth in tightening 

labor markets. In contrast, wage growth continues 

to be strong in
 the newer EU member states
 (Czech 

Republic, Baltics, Central Europe
, SEE economies)Š
signi˜cantly outpacing in˝ation as unemployment 

rates dip below precrisis lows.

Di˛erences in wage growth dynamics in the 
region are also the result of di˛erences in labor 

productivity growth, wage-setting mechanisms, 

and in˝ation expectations. As examined in 
Chapter 2, wage Phillips curves appear aliv
e and well, having broadly stable parameters, 

with a modest slope in the EU15 and especially 
strong wage responses to slack in the
 newer EU 

member states. Wage growth has generally been 

synchronized with labor productivity in most 

of advanced Europe
. In contrast, in the 
newer 

EU member states, wage growth has outpaced 

productivity growth, though the gap narrowed as 

labor productivity rose strongly in late 2017. In 

advanced Europe, 
low in˝ation expectations and 

external competition have been important factors 

in muting the response of wages to slack. As a 

result, corporate pro˜tability has been broadly 

stable. In comparison, corporate pro˜tability 

declined moderately in Eastern Europe
 in recent 

years, although it is still about 10
 percentage 
points higher than in advanced E
urope
 (Figure
 1.8).After a long creditless recovery, credit growth has 

been picking up since 2016 in many European 

countries, but it continues to lag domestic demand 
and output. As investment gains further strength, 

credit growth should follow, with bene˜cial e˛ects 

for bank pro˜tability and balance sheets (see 

Box
 1.2 for an in-depth discussion comparing the current recov

euro area
 and other advanced European 
countries, bank credit to the private sector is 

picking up (Figure
 1.9). Howev
er, growth 
in credit to businesses remains uneven 

across countries (Figure
 1.9, panel 4) and is particularly weak in countries with high 

levels of nonper
forming loans (NPLs). In 
the Nordic economies
, credit to businesses is 

robust, in line with a pickup in investment 

and exports, while credit growth to 

households has slowed somewhat following 

the recent macroprudential measures aimed 

at containing the housing boom and elevated 

household debt levels.

Ł In 
emerging Europe
, outside the CIS, credit 
growth to both non˜nancial corporations 

and households is increasing, par
ticularly in Central Europe
 and the SEE-EU region, 

in line with continuing strong real GDP 

and investment growth (Figure
 1.9, panel 3). On a transactional basis, credit gro
wth may be even higher in countries where the 

cleanup of loan portfolios has lowered credit 

stocks (for example in Albania, Croatia, 
and 
Hungary
). In 
Russia
, the decline in credit 

seems to have stabilized as the economy has 

exited the recession (Figure
 1.9, panel 3). In 
the rest of the 
CIS, credit has continued to 
contract, albeit at a slower pace. In 
Turkey
, 
credit growth initially slowed in 2016 in the 

aftermath of the failed coup attempt, but by 

way of various stimulus measures, notably 

a credit guarantee program for lending to 

businesses, it has since rebounded strongly to 

about 20 percent year ov
er year in early 2018 
(Figure
 1.9, panel 4).NPL levels have declined, but still weigh on bank 

pro˜tability and credit supply in several countries 
(Figure
 1.10). In 
advanced E
urope
, NPLs in the euro area
 have been substantially reduced since 

their peak in 2014, but the stock remains high 

in some countries. In 
Ireland
, Italy, 
and Spain, 

the reduction of NPLs and the recent pickup in 

NPL sales is encouraging. However, for a sizable 

part of the banking system, the return on equity 

is persistently below the cost of equity (IMF 

2017). ˚e economic recovery may not be enough 

to boost returns to meet investor expectations 

or resolve the structural challenges faced by the 

least pro˜table banks; further consolidation and 

restructuring will be needed. NPL levels have 

been declining across 
emerging Europe
 but remain 

higher than 10 percent in half of the countries. 
While disentangling demand and supply factors 
is di˙cult, high NPL levels are w
eighing on pro˜tability and credit growth. More actions are 

needed to repair bank balance sheets and facilitate 

the underlying corporate restructuring.

performance. ˚e Polish zloty and Hungarian 

forint also experienced some appreciation due 

to strong growth and subdued in˝ation. ˚e 

depreciation of the Turkish lira in 2017 by about 

6 percent follows a depreciation of a similar siz
e after the coup in the second half of 2016, amid 
above-target in˝ation and a widening current 

account. ˚e Russian ruble has depreciated by 

6 percent since Februar

pound has also moved broadly sideways since 

the depreciation in 2016. Meanwhile, the Swiss 

franc has depreciated since early 2017, given the 

negative interest rate di˛erential with the euro. 
˚us far, current account balances remain 
noticeably stronger than before the global ˜nancial 

crisis in most countries. Net external debtor

Meanwhile excess external surpluses have persisted. 
Ł In 
advanced Eur
ope, the euro area members 
that had current account de˜cits prior to 
the crisis have achieved surpluses (
Estonia, 

Portugal, Spain
) or reduced their de˜cits 

appreciably (
Greece, Latvia, Lithuania
) over 

the past several years (Figure
 1.12, panels 1 and 2), partly driven by adjustments in 
unit labor costs. However, negative net 
foreign asset positions remain elevated in 

many of these countries (Figure
 1.12, panel 3). Recent indicators of competitiveness, 

while not conclusive, suggest some er
osion of competitiveness in
 the Baltics
, where real 
e˛ective exchange rate appreciation, fast wage 

growth, and modest productivity gains have 

led to a notable increase in unit labor costs, 

bringing them close to the precrisis peak 

(Figure
 1.12, panel 4). Excess current account 
surpluses have persisted in Germany
 and the Netherlands
, and in Germany
 remained 

stronger than implied by medium-term 

fundamentals and desirable policy setting, 
indicating that adjustment mechanisms are 

weak, partly re˝ecting currency arrangements

to small surpluses, but here too the net 
external liability positions remain elevated 

(Figure
 1.12, panels 2 and 3). In 
Centr
al Europe
 and the SEE-EU region, real e˛ective 

exchange rates have edged up somewhat 

as wages outstripped productivity in the 

last two years (Figure
 1.12, panel 4). ˚e level of economy-wide pro˜t shares in these 

economies is higher than the EU average (Figure
 1.8), which suggests that companies have some room to absorb the higher labor 

costs. Ho
wever, the impact of high wage 
growth on competitiveness needs to be 

monitored closely.
Ł In 
Turkey
, the current account de˜cit has 
stayed around 5
 percent of GDP. Although 
exports hav
e performed well, higher fuel prices 
and strong domestic demand have led to a 

wider current account de˜cit.


˚e external environment and macroeconomic 
policy setting remain supportive for Europe™s 

near-term outlook. ˚e synchronized global 

expansion remains on track, with global growth 

projected to edge up from 3.8
 percent in 2017 to 
3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, partly re˝ecting 
spillover e˛ects of expansionary ˜scal policy in 
the United States
 (see Chapter 1 of the April 
2018 Wor
ld Economic Outlook
). ˚e continued recovery in global investment has spurred stronger 

manufacturing activity and an upturn in global 
trade (Figure
 1.13, panel 1). Global PMIs for 
early 2018 indicate that the global gro
wth momentum will continue into the ˜rst half of

Union for a 21-month Brexit transition period 
mitigates the risk of a disorderly UK exit from 

the European Union and reduces the uncertainty 

facing ˜rms and households.Commodity prices started the year on a bullish 
note. Oil prices, boosted by healthy global 

growth prospects and expectations for continued 

oil production curbs by the Organization of 

the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 
Russia
, 
increased to above $65 a barrel (about 30
 percent 
above the pr
ojection in the October 2017 
World 
Economic Outlook
). Higher oil prices will aid the 

cyclical recovery in 
Russia
 and could put some 
upward pressure on headline in˝ation elsewhere. 

Futures markets point to some oil price declines 

over the next few years from current levels.
Despite recent equity market turbulence, ˜nancial 
conditions remain supportive of growth, although 

signs of tightening conditions are gradually 

appearing in some markets (see Chapter
 1 of the April 2018 
Global F
inancial Stability Report
). Financial stress indices tightened modestly in 

late 2017 (Figure
 1.14, panel 1). Sover
eign bond yields edged up in many euro
 area
 economies, in 
response to better-than-expected growth outcomes 

and an expectation of earlier monetary policy 

normalization, and in the Czech
 Republic
 and 
Romania
, which began normalizing their monetary 

policy (Figure
 1.14, panel 2). Howev
er, yields 
actually declined in about a quarter of European 

economies, most notably in Greece
, Portugal
, 
and Ukraine
. In the 
euro
 area
, still-easy ˜nancial 
conditions are underpinned by large asset holdings 

by the ECB. Despite the lower purchase schedule, 

net purchases are expected to remain substantial 

at least through September 2018 relative to 

the projected net issuance of government debt 

(Figure
 1.14, panel 3).˚e recent stock market corrections hav
e thus far left no lasting scars. Market volatility rose 

substantially for European equities in early 

February 2018, but since then has declined to the 

average level observed in 2016
  
Œ17 (Figure
 1.14, panel 4). Portfolio ˝ows to 
emerging Europe
 remained robust through January 2018, especially 

bond ˝ows (Figure
 1.14, panel 5). Weekly data 
indicate that portfolio ˝o
ws reversed slightly 
amid the global equity market correction in the 

˜rst half of February, but have recovered since. 

˚e correction was mild compared with out˝ows 

during the ﬁtaper tantrumﬂ of 2013 (Figure
 1.14, panel 6). Howev
er, volatility is still a concern, 
given the recent stock movements and ongoing 

trade tensions.Continued accommodative macroeconomic 
policies will further support activity, with 

almost all central banks in the region 

maintaining negative
 real policy rates 
(Figure
 1.15, panel 2). Ł Monetary policy normalization in the large 

advanced economies is expected to be gradual 

and predictable (F
igure
 1.15, panel 1). In 
the United Kingdom, monetary policy 

remains accommodative but the Bank of 
England has started to consider the case for 

the normalization process. It raised the policy 

rate for the ˜rst time in 10 years, to 0.5 from 

0.25 of a percent. Central banks in the rest of 

advanced Europe are signaling a tightening 

bias. In
 the Czech Republic
, the Czech 

National Bank has raised rates three times 

since August 2017, after almost ˜ve years of a 

supportive stance, and is expected to continue 

gradually normalizing monetary conditions.
Ł In 
emerging Europe
, markets expect modest 
tightening of policy rates in almost all 
countries, although some central banks are 

maintaining a very accommodative monetary 

stance (Hungary
, Poland
). In
 Romania
, the policy rate was raised twice in 2018 by a 

cumulative 50 basis points. In 
Turkey
, the increase of the e˛ective interest rate by almost 

5 percentage points in 2017 has not been 
enough to contain in˝ation and prevent 

in˝ation expectations from increasing, 
prompting markets to expect further 

tightening of monetary policy in 2018. In 

contrast, Russia™s
 central bank has cut policy 
rates by a cumulative 275
 basis points since March 2017 as in˝ation stabilized belo
w its 4 percent target.

tobacco taxes, in˝ation in the 
euro area
 has been revised up by 0.1
 percentage point to 1.5
 percent 
in 2018, and down 0.1
 percentage point in 
2019 to 1.6 percent, still below the ECB target. 
In˝ation in the 
Nordic economies
 has been revised 
marginally downward relative to the forecast in 

October 2017. In the 
United Kingdom, 
in˝ation 
is expected to decline gradually toward the target 

over the next two years as import price pressures 

dissipate. However, that decline is expected to be 

o˛set by some recovery in wage growth, given a 

tighter labor market.
In 
Central and SEE countries
, in˝ation has been revised slightly upward for 2018, re˝ecting the 

impact of higher energy prices. In 
Poland,
 in˝ation 
has also been revised up by 0.3
 percentage point 
to 2.5 percent in 2018 due largely to higher 
energy prices. In 
Romania, in˝ation has been revised up more sizably by 1.3
 percentage points 
to 4.7 percent (above the upper end of the central 
bank target) for 2018, re˝ecting strong wage 
growth and demand pressure.
 In 
Russia
, in˝ation 
has been revised signi˜cantly downward to below 

3 percent in 2018, re˝ecting faster-than-expected 
deceleration in 2017, and to about 3¾ percent 
in 2019. For Turkey
, in˝ation is revised 
signi˜cantly upward, re˝ecting the pass-through 

from the exchange rate depreciation and higher 

energy prices.



Risks to the short-term outlook are 
broadly balanced:
Ł On the 
upside, there is still the potential for 
growth surprises. Business and consumer 
con˜dence indicators are robust, boosted by 

the strong cyclical upswing. High-frequency 

indicators, while somewhat softened, suggest 

solid growth in the months ahead, as market 

sentiment is buoyant and external conditions 

supportive (see the April 2018 
World Economic 

Outlook
). In addition, potential growth may 

be stronger and economic slack could be larger 

than currently assessed, thus the upswing may 

continue for longer before generating wage 

and price pressures.

Ł On the 
downside
, increasingly overstretched 
asset valuations and compressed term 

premiums at the global lev
el (see the April 
2018 Global Financial Stability Report
) raise 
the possibility of a ˜nancial market correction 

and a rapid tightening of global ˜nancial 
conditions, which could dampen growth 

and con˜dence in both the short term and 

potentially the medium term (see Box
 1.3 for a quanti˜cation exercise). A possible trigger 

could be a faster-than-expected increase 

in in˝ation in the advanced economies. A worsening of trade tensions and imposition of 
trade barriers could also weaken con˜dence 

and take a toll on economic activity.
Ł Beyond the near term, risks are clearly 

tilted to the downside. E
xternal downside 
risks facing the entire region stem from a 

mix of ˜nancial vulnerabilities, possible 
inward-looking policies globally, and a range 

of noneconomic factors.Ł With ˜nancial conditions set to remain 

easy despite the onset of monetary policy 

normalization, ˜nancial vulnerabilities that have accumulated o
ver the years could give 
way to a rapid tightening in global ˜nancial 
conditions, with repercussions for growth 

(see the April 2018 
World Economic Outlook
 
and April 2018 
Global Financial Stability 

Report). 
Inward-looking policies and rising 

protectionism could a˛ect European countries 

as well as the rest of the world through trade, 

˜nancial, and investment channels. Support 

for globalization has weakened in the
 United 

States
 and parts of Europe, as re˝ected in the 

renegotiations of free trade agreements such 

as the North American Free Trade Agreement 

and arrangements between the
 United 

Kingdom and the European Union. Retreat 

from cross-border integration and increases 

in tari˛s and nontari˛ barriers in the context 
of these negotiations or elsewhere (as seen 

recently with the proposed US tari˛s) could 

sour market sentiment, disrupt supply chains, 

slow the spread of technologies, and reduce 

global productivity and investment. A host of 

other risks, such as a signi˜cant slowdown in 

China, geopolitical tensions, and cyberattacks 
could cause ˜nancial instability and disrupt

growth. Domestic risks vary within the region 
and are tilted to the downside as well.
Ł With the reduction of monetary 

accommodation, highly indebted euro area
 countries could face challenges in coping with 
the higher ˜nancing costs in the absence 
of ˜scal adjustments to rebuild bu˛ers and 

structural reforms to improve productivity. 

Despite progress on bank cleanups, remaining 

vulnerabilities in parts of the 
euro area
 
banking system could reignite ˜nancial 

distress. A tail of weaker internationally active 

banks that have lower levels of capital and 

provisions could face funding challenges in 

the case of a sudden bout of market turmoil or 

an unexpected downturn (see the April 2018 

Global Financial Stability Report
).Ł Dissatisfaction with the slow pace of 

convergence after the crisis, and high 

unemployment rates in par
ts of the euro 
area,
 could challenge the cohesion of the 
Economic and Monetary Union and a˛ect 

the reform e˛orts of existing members as well 

as non-EU countries that aspire to join the 

European Union.
Ł Protracted policy and economic uncertainty 

could weigh on gr
owth. ˚is includes 
uncertainties surrounding the negotiations 

of the post-Brexit arrangements between the 

European Union and the
 United Kingdom.
 A 
long list of tasks in those negotiations remains 

to be accomplished. Notably, a large and 

complex ˜nancial system exposes the United 

Kingdom and the global economy to risks 
associated with the transition to a new state 

of play. ˚ere are also policy uncertainties 

related to newly elected governments in major 

European countries.
With economic prospects continuing to improve 

in the short term, but medium-term downside 

risks persisting, policymakers should seize 

the moment to rebuild room for ˜scal policy 
maneuver and push forward with reforms to boost 

growth potential. In countries where in˝ation is 

still subdued, monetary policy should continue 

to be supportive to ensure a durable increase in 

in˝ation to targets. In countries where in˝ation 

is hitting targets, monetary policy should 

gradually normalize.
For the 
euro area
 and most of advanced Europe,
 
monetary policy should remain strongly 

accommodative until in˝ation has durably 

converged to the central bank target. ˚e 

commitment to raising in˝ation and in˝ation 
expectations remains key to generating durably 

higher in˝ation and lifting sluggish wages 
(Chapter 2). ˚e ECB™s recent decision to drop 
an explicit reference to possible future increases 
in the monthly pace of net asset purchases re˝ects 

an improving balance of risks. ˚e ECB™s net 

asset purchases were downsized in January 2018. 

˚e well-communicated recalibration of asset 

purchases, coupled with forward guidance on 

keeping policy rates at their extraordinarily low 

levels well past the horizon of net asset purchases, 

will continue to support favorable ˜nancing 

conditions. In the 
United Kingdom
, following the 

rate increase in November 2017, future policy rate 

increases should be guided by evolving in˝ation 

conditions and the need to deal with uncertainties 

posed by Brexit. Similarly, in the
 Czech Republic
, 
the central bank™s steady approach toward 

normalization has been appropriate, and future 

policy decisions should continue to be data driven.
In 
emerging Europe
, for Central European 
economies, given the more advanced stage of 

the recovery and strong wage growth, in˝ation 

pressure should be monitored carefully, and 

monetary policy should stand ready to adjust if 

in˝ation reaches or exceeds targets. In 
Hungary
, 
monetary policy can remain supportive in the 

immediate term, but should be prepared to remove 

some stimulus if underlying in˝ation pressure 

picks up. In 
Poland
, policy decisions should be 
data dependent, but should take into account the 211. M

˜scal stance and monetary transmission lags to 
avoid in˝ation overshooting its target. In 
Russia
, 
there is room for further policy easing given 

declining in˝ation, while in Turkey
, monetary 

policy should tighten further beyond what would 

be needed to keep pace with the US Federal 

Reserve™s rate hikes to lower in˝ation meaningfully 

and reanchor expectations. Credible monetary 

tightening would also help underpin the currency 

and rebuild o˙cial reserves.
For most countries across the region (in both 

advanced
 and emerging Europe
), the economic 
expansion has buoyed revenues and allowed 

the headline ˜scal balance to improve (Annex 

Table
 1.9). Howev
er, only about a third of these 
countries have seen improvement in cyclically 

adjusted balances, and policies need to ensure 

more progress on this front. ˚e trade-o˛ between 

protecting growth and ˜scal consolidation is 

now tilted more favorably toward consolidation 

to rebuild room to cope with future shocks. In 

the euro area, 
countries with limited ˜scal space 
should consolidate in a growth-friendly way 

before monetary accommodation ends in order 

to avoid a sharper adjustment later or during a 

new downturn. Countries with ample ˜scal space 

can and should use it to promote higher potential 

growth through more public investment, which 

can also help their external rebalancing (see the 

IMF 2017 External Sector Report).
 For the 
Nordic
 
economies, a mildly contractionary ˜scal stance 

is appropriate given the cyclical positions of the 

economies. For the 
United Kingdom, 
the ˜scal 
framework needs to strike a balance between 

preserving su˙cient ˝exibility to respond to 

shocks and committing to ˜scal discipline and to 
rebuilding ˜scal bu˛ers. Going forward, steady 

˜scal consolidation remains critical to rebuild 

room for policy maneuver.
Regarding 
emerging Europe, 
buoyant tax revenues, 
thanks in part to past tax administration reforms 

in Central Europe
 and consolidation e˛orts in 

Southeastern Europe, 
have helped rein in ˜scal 
de˜cits. With a strong and well-entrenched 

cyclical recovery, the priority should be to 

continue to reduce structural ˜scal de˜cits toward 

medium-term ﬁclose-to-balanceﬂ targets and to 

lower still-high debt levels. In 
Russia,
 the planned 
de˜cit reduction in 2018Œ20, underpinned by the 

new ˜scal rule, is warranted due to permanently 

lower oil prices and the need to increase oil fund 

savings. ˚e adjustment can be helped by measures 

to improve tax collection and the return on state 

assetsŠincluding dividend payouts and more 

permanent and better-targeted spending, such as 
parametric reform to the pension system, shifts to 

means testing of social assistance programs, and 

reductions in subsidies and tax expenditures. In 

Turkey,
 front-loaded ˜scal consolidationŠabove 

the authorities™ medium-term program targets 

and backed by well-de˜ned and comprehensive 

revenue and spending measuresŠwould support 

internal and external rebalancing and buoy 

investor sentiment.
For many countries in the region, progress has 

been made on cleaning up bank balance sheets, 
but more remains to be done. For European 

Union member countries, the recent proposals 

from the EU and the ECB targeting NPLs are 

steps in the right direction. In addition, for 

the euro area
, the authorities should focus on 
reducing impediments to NPL resolution caused 

by the fragmentation across the 19 jurisdictions™ 

legal and regulatory frameworks, including by 

establishing minimum standards for valuation 

of loan collateral, consistent de˜nitions of 
NPLs, and minimum standards for insolvency 

and creditor rights. ˚e Single Supervisory 

Mechanism should continue to follow up on 

its NPL guidanceŠincluding by evaluating 

and monitoring bank-speci˜c targets for NPL 
reductionŠbacked by its Pillar 2 powers. Equally, 

the European Banking Authority should press 

forward with its NPL sales platform. For the 

Nordic
 economies, macroprudential policy can help 

reduce vulnerabilities related to the housing sector. 

In the 
Czech Republic
, the central bank should 22REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EURO
PEInternational Monetary Fund
 | May 2018
be given binding powers over loan-to-value, 
debt-to-income, and debt-servicing-to-income 

ratios. Risks related to housing prices should also 

be carefully monitored in 
Hungary
. Continued 
reduction of NPLs should be a priority for 

some Eastern European economies
, where the 

economic recovery provides better prospects 

for asset sales. In 
Turkey
, policies should aim at 
strengthening oversight and governance of the 

banking sector, where progress has been limited 

so far in implementing recommendations from 

the IMF™s Financial Sector Assessment Program. 

Macroprudential policies should be revisited in 

areas where vulnerabilities are highest, particularly 

the highly leveraged corporate sector.
In 
advanced Europe
, countries should seize the 

moment to push forward structural reforms that 

boost competitiveness and potential growth and 

enhance resilience to shocks, while making sure 

that the gains from growth are shared widely. 

˚ese include ambitious labor and product 

market reforms to close competitiveness gaps at 

the national level. Quality education and training 

that are well tailored to labor market needs will 

help improve labor productivity. Shifting taxes 

away from labor, better apprenticeship programs, 

and other active labor market policies will also 

help reduce high youth employment. As noted in 

the November 2017 
Regional Economic Outlook: 

Europe
, at the EU level, incentives for structural 

reforms in the form of targeted support from EU 

structural funds and outcome-based benchmarks 

could be combined with stricter enforcement of 

the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure.
In e
merging Europe
, structural reforms should 
focus on enhancing institutions (see Chapter 2 of the November 2017 
Regional Economic Outlook: 
Europe
) and on improving public sector e˙ciency 
(see the November 2016 
Regional Economic 

Issues: Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe
). 
For some countries, especially 
SEE non-EU and 
some CIS countries, priorities should also include 
improving the investment environment, boosting 
labor participation rates of women and older 

workers (see Box
 1.4 for a discussion of policy options), and reducing high youth unemployment 

rates. In the Western Balkan economies
, strengthening institutions should help the renewed 

e˛ort for EU engagement.
In 
Russia, 
institutional improvements are 
prerequisites to realizing dividends from 

investment in innovation and other reforms. In 

Turkey
, the reforms should focus on increasing 

labor market ˝exibility and improving the business 

environment.
Union (EMU) Architecture
˚e recovery provides an opportunity to move 
faster to deepen the Economic and Monetary 

Union (see the IMF 2017 Article IV Sta˛ Report 

for the Euro Area). First, more actions are needed 

to complete the banking union. Instituting a 

backstop from the European Stability Mechanism 

to the Single Resolution Fund and setting up 

a European deposit insurance scheme with a 

˜scal backstop would mark an important step 

toward greater risk sharing. Second, with the 

United Kingdom
 leaving the single market, there 

is a more urgent need to upgrade supervisory 

capacity to oversee a slew of migrating ˜nancial 

intermediation with Brexit and increased 

market-based activities from advancing the Capital 

Markets Union (CMU). ˚e CMU aims to widen 

˜nancing choices of small and medium-size 

enterprises by increasing the investor base, 

promoting harmonization of insolvency regimes, 

and protecting cross-border investor rights. ˚ird, 

there is a strong case for setting up central ˜scal 

capacity for macroeconomic stabilization. It will 

take time to build support for such capacity, and 

it will likely require making access to central funds 

conditional on compliance with the ˜scal rules 

and having mechanisms to prevent permanent 

transfers across countries. ˚e central ˜scal 

capacity (CFC) could prevent permanent transfers 

between countries through several mechanisms 

(Arnold and others 2018). First, the CFC could 
231. M

employ something known as a ﬁusage premium,ﬂ 
through which a country pays a premium in 

good times based on transfers it got in bad times. 
Second, the CFC could place a cap on the amount 

countries must contribute to prevent some 
countries from becoming large net contributors. 

Finally, it could limit how much a country can 

receive, so that transfers do not substitute for 

necessary policy adjustment.

How
 strong is the recovery in investment likely to be? Are businesses expanding or replacing their capacity? 
Could the current recovery in investment translate into more jobs, higher productivity and growth, and thus a 
more durable recovery? ˚is box sheds light on these questions using a rich survey of a large number of ˜rms 

across the European Union conducted by the European Investment Bank (EIB). ˚e EIB Investment Survey 

(www  
.eib  
.org/ eibis) provides information about ˜rms™ investment purposes, ar
eas, and obstacles. It ˜nds 
that the current investment recovery, accompanied by upgrading of the quality of capital and moving to new 

products, bodes well for productivity and employment, though some challenges, notably skill shortages, could 

be limiting.˚e 2017 EIB survey of EU ˜rms reveals that the replacement of existing capacity continues to dominate 
˜rms™ investment activities. About half of ˜rms™ investment undertaken in 2017 was for replacement purposes. 

Investment in capacity expansion accounted for slightly more than a quarter of total investment, while the 

remaining 17
 percent was for innovation purposes (F
igure
 1.1.1, panel 1). Looking ahead, investment in capacity expansion and new products is expected to account for mor
e than half of the investment, boding well for productivity and employment. Compared with 2016, when asked 

about future plans, ˜rms are increasingly prioritizing capacity expansion and investment in new activities 

(Figure
 1.1.1, panel 2). ˚e shift in investment focus is good news from a pr
oductivity angle as well as from 
an employment perspective. Investment for expanding capacity and innovation purposes, rather than for 

replacement purposes, tends to support more employment (Figure
 1.1.1, panel 3).Despite improv
ements in investment activity, challenges remain. Going forward, lack of sta˛ with the right 
skills is considered by many ˜rms as the most important factor limiting investment, closely followed by 

uncertainty about the future (Figure
 1.1.1, panel 4). Skill constraints are particularly acute for ne
wer member 
states, where emigration of skilled labor has been a long-standing issue (see Atoyan and others 2016) and is 

also re˝ected in indicators of labor shortages (see Chapter
 2). In addition, investment in intangible assets, such 
as resear
ch and development, training, information and communication technology capital, and improvement 
of organizational processes, is weaker in 
Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe
 than in the rest of the 

European Union (Figure
 1.1.1, panel 5). Investment in intangibles is likely an important factor in the 
convergence and catch-up process as ˜rms move up the value chain (WIPO 2017). Here, too, lack of skilled 
sta˛ could pose a challenge, since investment in intangibles is likely more skill-intensive. Another obstacle for 

investment in intangibles across Europe could be Europe™s largely bank-based ˜nancial sector, which poses 

di˙culties for using intangibles as collateral (EIB 2017).˚is box was prepared by Phillip-Bastian Brutscher and Miroslav Kollar (European Investment Bank) and Raju Huidrom and

Europe™s recovery from the Great Recession has been long and uneven. It took about 10 years after the crisis 
for all countries in Europe to grow again in 2017. ˚e years in the aftermath of the global ˜nancial crisis 

have been characterized by weak investment, lackluster credit growth, large output gaps, and stubbornly low 

in˝ation. ˚e recent strengthening of the recovery in Europe on the back of still generally subdued in˝ation 

raises the question of how this recovery is di˛erent from previous recoveries from recessions, both for 
advanced 

and emerging Europe
. Speci˜cally, can one expect a more moderately paced but potentially longer recovery 

than after previous recessions?
To answer these questions, the dynamics of a set of economic and ˜nancial variables since the global ˜nancial 
crisis are compared with the recovery from the 1991 global recession. Among the global recessions in the past 

50 years (1975, 1982, 1991, and 2009, as identi˜ed in the April 2012 
World Economic Outlook
), the 1991 
crisis was chosen based on data availability and similarities, though for 
emerging Europe
, the transition to a 
market economy makes comparability more di˙cult. First, both recoveries were preceded by a boom and bust 

in credit and stock markets in advanced economies. Second, the initial years of recovery involved challenges 

that complicated the recovery, notably, the 1992Œ93 Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis and the euro area debt 

crisis in 2011Œ13. ˚e main obvious di˛erence is the monetary union.
˚e current recovery di˛ers from the past one in important ways. In the 
advanced economies
, output growth 
has been much weaker, credit stagnant, and in˝ation very low. ˚e same holds for the 
emerging economies of 
Eastern Europe
, except for output. Regarding unemployment rates, in 
emerging Europe
 developments in the 

current cycle are notably better, re˝ecting in part stronger macroeconomic frameworks. In 
advanced Europe
, 
despite the larger shock in the current episode, the recoveries are broadly similar in the early years due to more 

˝exibility in labor markets in some of these countries. A comparison of the developments in real and ˜nancial 

variables between the two recoveries reveals the following (Figure
 1.2.1).Real GDP:
 In 
advanced Europe
, growth gained momentum only ˜ve years after the global ˜nancial crisis as 
opposed to three years after 1991. ˚e recent crisis was sharper and more globally synchronized than the 1991 

recession. Also, the euro area debt crisis (2011Œ13) slowed the pace of recovery. ˚e enduring legacy of the 

global ˜nancial crisis and the drawn-out process of balance sheet repair in corporate and household sectors led 

to a stubbornly slow recovery. In 
emerging Europe
 excluding the CIS and Turkey
, the recovery has been stronger 

than in advanced Europe
, and on average similar to that following the 1991 episode.
Investment:
 A feature of the aftermath of the global ˜nancial crisis has been the sustained weakness in 
investment in both 
advanced 
and emerging Europe
. ˚is deterioration can be traced to weaknesses in housing 

and credit markets and could, in some countries, re˝ect the need for a housing market correction.
Unemployment:
 Both recovery episodes are marked by higher unemployment rates. However, despite a much 
sharper contraction of output in 2009, there was a broadly similar rise in the unemployment rate in the 

˜rst three years in 
advanced Europe
. ˚is may re˝ect more ˝exible labor markets and greater labor hoarding. 

Nonetheless following the double dip of 2011Œ13, the unemployment rate remains somewhat more elevated 

than in the previous crisis and has not yet returned to precrisis levels. In 
emerging Europe
, the trajectory 

of the unemployment rate has been more favorable than following the 1991 recession, likely re˝ecting 

stronger macroeconomic frameworks and fundamentals in the current episode, but also the structural rise of 

unemployment in the early 1990s as these countries transitioned to market economies.

In˜ation: 
Both recovery episodes are marked by declines in the in˝ation rate in the aftermath of crises. ˚e 
initial drop in in˝ation after the global ˜nancial crisis was sharper. After seven years, average in˝ation has been 

lower by about 3
 percentage points compared with the precrisis y
ear. A salient di˛erence is that initial in˝ation 
levels in the two episodes were di˛erent. In 
advanced Europe
, average in˝ation hovered around 5
 percent in 
1991 and 3 percent in 2009. After the global ˜nancial crisis, this entailed below-target in˝ation rates for an 
extended period of time. For 
emerging Europe
, higher in˝ation after 1991 was due to price liberalization on the way to market economies. But, like the advanced economies, most of the emerging market economies have 

now seen a prolonged period of very low in˝ation.
Equity prices: 
In 
advanced Europe, 
equity prices have been weaker in the current episode compared with the 
1991 case. ˚is is in line with developments in real GDP, as equity prices embody information about actual 

and expected output growth and the major weight of banks in the indices.
Credit growth: 
˚e current recovery in both 
advanced
 and emerging Europe
 has been creditless compared 
with the 1991 episode. For 
advanced Europe
, the creditless nature of the current recovery is much more

pronounced, as even a decade after the initial shock credit has remained ˝at, compared with ˜ve years after the 
1991 recession. ˚is again highlights the depth of balance sheet challenges and the likely slow policy response 

to clean them up, which perpetuated the vicious circle of low credit and depressed demand. For 
emerging 
Europe
, the current creditless recovery is in sharp contrast to the 1991 episode, when credit growth was strong 

as credit deepened during the transition to market economies.
What does this mean for growth going forward? Perhaps the main insight is that there are few compelling 
reasons to believe that the recovery in the 
emerging economies of Eastern Europe
 would go on for longer than 
the post-1991 recovery. While real GDP displays a broadly similar dynamic, investment has been much 

weaker, and this may increasingly constrain potential growth. In the 
advanced economies
, the issue appears 
less clear, although there too the weakness of investment does not portend well for the future. ˚is seems 

consistent with large markdowns in projected growth rates for potential output after the global ˜nancial crisis 

for all countries.(continued)30REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EURO
PEInternational Monetary Fund

˚e ˜nancial market turbulence in early February 2018 was a reminder that asset prices can correct rapidly 
and trigger disruptive portfolio adjustments and increased volatility, with the potential to hamper growth. 

Indeed, there is extensive empirical evidence that asset price changes, particularly stock prices, have predictive 

power for growth in industrial economies (Fama 1990; Mauro 2000; Bluedorn, Decressin, and Terrones 

2013). Asset prices incorporate information about expected growth and a˛ect growth through wealth e˛ects, 

the cost of capital, and con˜dence.To gauge the implications of asset price declines for activity and policy responses, this box examines short- and 
medium-term developments in growth, in˝ation, unemployment, and short-term interest rates during past 

episodes of large asset price corrections in a sample of 
G7 countries, Spain,
 and Sweden
 from 1980 to 2017. 
While there are notable di˛erences across countries, it appears that in the aftermath of sharp asset price 
correctionsŠde˜ned as asset price drops within the ˜fth percentile of the distribution of quarterly changesŠ

GDP growth on average declines by 0.5
 percentage point (quarter ov
er quarter) in the ˜rst quarter. Growth 
recovers somewhat over the subsequent few quarters, but remains lower by 0.1
 percentage point after eight 
quarters (Figur

lower by 0.3
 percentage point in the quarter after a sharp asset price drop and by 1.2
 percentage points after 
eight quarters. ˚e decline in in˝ation seems more pronounced in the recent crisis than in the early 2000s. 
Given the low starting level of in˝ation, another step down in in˝ation would be problematic for many 
in˝ation-targeting central banks. After eight quarters of sharp asset price drops, unemployment is higher by 
1 percentage point on average. Appr
eciable asset price declines also trigger monetary policy responses that 
are generally limited in the ˜rst quarter (Œ0.5
 percentage point reduction in short-term rates) but follo
wed 
by larger responses over the medium term (eight quarters later). ˚e scope for large responses is much more 

limited today.

Emerging European countries are confronting some of the worst demographic trends in the region. ˚e 
working-age population has been declining due to aging, persistent outward migration, and relatively low 

life expectancy (see the May 2016 
Regional Economic Issues: Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe
). At the 

same time, labor force participation among certain demographic groupsŠwomen and older workersŠis low 

compared with advanced Europe (Figure
 1.4.1, panel 1). ˚us, getting more working-age people to actually 
work could mitigate some of these adv
erse trends. 
˚is box complements Chapter
 2 of the April 2018
 W
orld Economic Outlook, 
on labor force participation 
in advanced economies, by drawing on the European experience with policies that encourage labor force 

participation in various demographic groups (prime-age women, older workers, the young, and newly arrived 

migrants).1In line with global trends, overall labor force participation has fallen in many 
advanced European economies
 
in the last decade (see Chapter 2 of the April 2018
 W
orld Economic Outlook
). Workforce participation rates 
of men declined in most countries (Figure
 1.4.2, panel 2), re˝ecting lower attachment rates of y
oung and prime-age men (Figure
 1.4.1, panel 2). Population aging and the prolonged impact of the global ˜nancial 
crisis have contributed to the r
ecent decline in male workforce attachment, with technological progress

further weighing on low-skilled male workers. In contrast, female labor force participation rose in about 
three-quarters of advanced European economies, thanks to increased workforce attachment of prime-age 

and older women, as more women obtained secondary and tertiary education. Across di˛erent age groups, 

labor force attachment has markedly increased among older workers, yet declined slightly among youth 

(Figure
 1.4.1, panel 2). Labor force participation is a function of personal choices, demographics, economic trends, and labor mar
ket policies and institutions. Tax bene˜t systems, retirement bene˜ts, family-friendly policies, and active labor 

market policies matter, and they are particularly important in getting more women and older workers to 

participate in the workforce. Drawing on the European experience, speci˜c policies include those addressing:
Ł Prime-age women:
 Women
™s decisions to participate in the labor force are often a˛ected by potential 
work ˝exibility, childcare and preschool availability and a˛ordability, parental leave policies, and tax 
policy (Atoyan and Rahman 2017). In 
Sweden
, policies such as parental leave, subsidized childcare, 

and scope for shorter working hours for parents with young children have made it easier for women to 

enter the workforce and return following childbirth. Also, the Swedish tax system does not discourage 

second earners (often women) from taking up work, as incomes are taxed individually. In 
Germany,
 a 
comprehensive set of labor market reforms introduced during 2003Œ05 (known as the ﬁHartz reformsﬂ) 

increased opportunities to work part-time, which has enabled millions of German women to work. In 

addition, the 2007 reform of maternity leave bene˜ts encouraged faster return to work after childbirth. 

In 
Spain
, the 2012 labor market reforms also promoted part-time work. In 
Israel
, the 2003 reform of 

untargeted child allowances encouraged women to work by reducing bene˜ts and gradually eliminating 

the progressivity of bene˜ts linked to the number of children.

Ł Older workers:
 ˚e participation decisions of older workers are in˝uenced by the statutory retirement 
age, the generosity of pension schemes, and the generosity of disability insurance. In 
Germany
, the 2007 pension reform gradually increases the statutory retirement age to 67 from 65 by 2030. ˚e pension 

system also became less generous, as the replacement rates were reduced. More recently, 
Germany
 
introduced ˜nancial incentives to encourage work past the mandatory retirement age coupled with more 

˝exible work schedules, while lowering the retirement age for certain workers. In 
Sweden, 
an earned 
income tax credit reform was introduced in 2007 to encourage an increased labor supply; the size of the 

tax credit was larger for workers older than 65. In addition, the payroll tax rate was more than halved for 

these workers. ˚ese reforms were combined with stricter eligibility criteria in the disability insurance 

program (Laun and Palme 2017).
Ł ˜e young:
 High labor costs (both the tax wedge and minimum wages) a˛ect emplo
yment opportunities 
for entry-level workers, who require on-the-job training (Banerji and others 2014). In 
Germany
, 
about 50 percent of all high school graduates receive dual v
ocational training to acquire skills and 
enhance job readiness. ˚is training is a combination of company-based apprenticeships and theoretical 

classes at vocational colleges. Apprentices are exempted from minimum wage
 regulations and instead 
receive a ﬁ
training allowanceﬂ of about 50
 percent of the national minimum wage. ˚e lower wages early 
in their careers pay for their training but result in higher productivity and better lifetime incomes.
Ł Immigrants:
 Policies that encourage labor market integration of migrants ar
e associated with higher participation of prime-age workers. In 
Sweden
, immigrants are integrated into the labor market mainly 

through general measures for the unemployed among the entire population, regardless of country of 

birth. ˚ese general measures are supplemented by targeted support for newly arrived refugees. Since 

2008, newly arrived refugees and their relatives have been eligible for up to two years of personalized 

language training; employment assistance (for example, validation of education and prior work 

experience); and personal counseling. Participation in this introductory program is voluntary, but the 

available ˜nancial bene˜ts and housing support are conditional on full-time participation. In 
Germany
, 
intensive vocational language training was also used to help integrate more than 1
 million refugees into 
the labor market.
In addition to speci˜c policies, activ
e labor market policies have centered on maintaining the motivation 
of jobseekers to actively seek employment, while improving their employability and helping them ˜nd 

appropriate jobs. In 
Germany
, the Hartz reforms focused on improving job-search e˙ciency, modernizing 

public employment services, increasing employment ˝exibility, and activating the unemployed by making 

unemployment bene˜ts conditional on tighter rules for job search and acceptance. ˚e reforms introduced 

measures directly supporting integration into regular employment, such as wage subsidies paid to employers 

for hiring hard-to-place workers and start-up subsidies. Also, labor market institutions were deregulated 

to allow temporary and ˜xed-term contract work. In the
 United Kingdom
, the 2008 reform of the welfare 

program for low-income single parents (ﬁLone Parent Obligationsﬂ) provided out-of-work single parents with 

˜nancial incentives to look for paid employment, alongside support for ˜nding jobs.

Employment
 is notably higher across Europe, and 
unemployment substantially downŠthere are even 

labor shortages in some countries. Yet wage growth 

is stubbornly low in long-standing European Union 

(EU) countries (EU15), even if it has picked up 

notably in newer EU members.
1 ˜e source of 
these dynamics is explored in this chapter, which 

looks at the role of labor market slack, in˚ation, 

and productivity, as well as crisis legacies. Europe™s 
cross
-country varied but highly integrated economyŠ
including for laborŠgives a glimpse of possible 

spillovers across countries.
An econometric analysis shows that wage 
developments in long
-standing EU members and the newer EU members are driven by di˛erent factors. 
In the EU15, wages typically respond very slowly to 

changes in unemployment and are closely related to 

in˚ation and in˚ation expectations. Viewed against 

this evidence, current wage developments are not 

unusual. Rather, in˚ation and in˚ation expectations 

are unusually low. In the newer EU members, by 

contrast, the econometric evidence suggests that 

wage growth responds very quickly to changes in 

unemployment. ˜is, together with lower importance 

of in˚ation and in˚ation expectations, explains why 
wage growth in these states is now running much 
higher. Other factors, such as cross
-country labor 
market spillovers, also play a role in wage growth. 

For the EU15, this role is smaller than that of 

labor market slack and in˚ation. For the newer EU 
 ˜e chapter was prepared by a sta˚ team comprising Vizhdan 
Boranova, Jiaqian Chen, Dilyana Dimova, Christian Ebeke, Raju 
Huidrom, Nemanja Jovanovic, Li Lin, Aiko Mineshima, Jean-Marc 

Natal, Faezeh Raei, Tiberiu Scutaru, Jesse Siminitz, Yan Sun, Peichu 

Xie, Sophia Zhang. ˜e team was led by Craig Beaumont and Emil 

Stavrev. Laura Papi provided useful advice and comments. Lian Veluz 

provided administrative support.
1Newer EU members (NMS) are Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech 
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, 

the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia. EU15 members are Austria, 

Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, 

Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the 

United Kingdom. Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta are not included in

members, it is smaller than the role of slack but larger 
than that of in˚ation.˜e chapter also documents spillovers between labor 
markets. Declines in both domestic and foreign slack 

contributed to the recent higher wage growth in 

newer EU members. ˜e spillovers from euro area 

unemployment and wages to wages in newer EU 

members are likely the result of actual and potential 

emigration™s e˛ects on domestic labor supply and the 
integration of these countries in pan
-European value 
chains. Also, wages in several old EU members appear 

a˛ected by wages in Germany.
Conditions for wage growth to pick up in the 
EU15, this analysis implies, are improving thanks to 

declining slack in countries and in the region. Some 

recent wage negotiations have yielded signi˝cant 

increases. Nonetheless, sustained higher wage increases 

depend to a large extent on in˚ation and in˚ation 
expectations. Continued European Central Bank 

commitment to raising euro area in˚ation and 

in˚ation expectations is essential for durably higher 

wage growth.
In the newer EU members, higher wage increases are 
boosting people™s incomes, but competitiveness could 

come under pressure, requiring reforms to ramp up 

skills and support labor force participation. Chapter 

1 cautions newer EU member central banks with 

their own currencies to be alert to the in˚ation risks 

of higher wage growth and to bear in mind that 

raising policy rates could trigger capital in˚ows and 

exchange rate appreciation. Countries whose ˝scal 

de˝cits are still relatively large given the state of the 

economic cycle should strive for more consolidation to 

help alleviate some exchange rate pressure.
˜ere have been dramatic improvements in 
labor market conditions in the European Union 

in recent years. Employment has increased by 

12.7˛million people since early 2013, exceeding 

precrisis peaks by 2.2˛percent at the end of 2017. 

In parallel, unemployment fell from 11˛percent 

in early 2013 to 7.3˛percent in late 2017.

Unemployment dropped faster in the newer EU 
member states, falling by a total of 5˛percentage 

points on average, yet the 3˛percentage point 

decline in the EU15 average rate is also 

substantial (Figure˛2.1). 
However, nominal wage rises remain stubbornly 
low in the EU15 even as they are picking up in 

the newer members. Average EU15 wage increases 

have remained below 2˛percent since 2012 and, 

at 1.8˛percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, were 

only half of precrisis (2001Œ08) average growth 

rates (Figure˛2.2). In sharp contrast, average wage 

increases in newer member states accelerated 

to 6¾˛percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, 

from 3½˛percent in 2014, led by the Baltics and 

southern European countries; central European 

country wages have picked up more recently. ˜is 

divergence between the EU15 and newer EU 

members is also evident in real product wages 

(de˝ated by the GDP de˝ator): growth averaged 

½ percent in the EU15 in 2017, little changed 

from 2014, but surged from 3 to 5¼˛percent year 

over year during the same period in the newer 

members.2˜is chapter explores the drivers of these recent 

divergent wage dynamics, including the potential 

role of EU integration. As recently analyzed in 

Chapter˛2 of the October 2017 
World Economic 

Outlook 
(WEO), which focused on regions with 

low wage growth, the bulk of the wage slowdown 

in advanced economies can be accounted for by 

reductions in in˝ation expectations and trend 

productivity growth, together with expanded 

measures of labor market slack.
3 ˜e WEO noted 
that domestic conditions driving wages could 
have a signi˙cant common componentŠgiven 

economic linkages between countriesŠand that 

there could also be direct spillovers on wage setting 

in other countries (see Box˛2.2).
˜e main contribution of this chapter is to discuss wage dynamics in the EU15 and newer 
2˜e GDP de˝ator is used to calculate real wages in this analysis, 
because it drives the nominal value added available for distribution 
to labor and capital and allows for the comparison of real wages with 

labor productivity.

EU members, explore the di˚erences between the 
two groups, and look at spillovers. ˜e chapter 

further analyzes the potential need to supplement 

unemployment with other indicators when 

assessing labor market slack, while controlling for 

in˝ation expectations in a wage Phillips curve. In 

view of the potential for wages to temporarily be 

away from equilibrium, especially given Europe™s 
double-dip recession and nominal wage rigidities, 
the chapter also uses an error correction model 

(ECM) for wage analysis.˜e chapter ˙rst describes recent wage 
developments in the EU15 and newer member 

states. Trends in EU labor market arrangements 

are described in the next section of the chapter, 

which also assesses whether other slack indicators 
might complement unemployment. ˜e chapter 

then summarizes the integration of goods and 

labor markets in the European Union, with a 

preliminary assessment of the implications for the 

sensitivity of wages to global shocks. ˜e analysis 
brings these factors together in a more formal 

analysis of wage dynamics, starting from the 

widely used Phillips curve model, evaluating an 

ECM alternative, and then exploring spillovers via 

slack, wages, and migration. Wages in the newer

EU members are found to be more ˛exible in 
relation to domestic labor market slack and more 

responsive to external labor market conditions. 

Next, the chapter examines any changes in the 

formation of wages and in˛ation expectations and 
the pass-through of wages to in˛ation. ˜e ˝nal 

section of the chapter puts forth conclusions and 

discusses implications for policies.Recent European Wage 
DevelopmentsSlowing wage growth across EU15 countries 
has been accompanied by lower in˛ation and 

productivity growth (Figure
 2.3). Average nominal 
wage gro
wth has remained around 1½
 percent 
since 2011, down from just o
ver 3
 percent during 
2003Œ09.4 ˜is decline coincides with lower 
in˛ation in output prices (down 1
 percentage 
point to about 1¼ percent in recent y
ears) and slower trend productivity growth (down ½ 

percentage point to 0.6
 percent). Average r
eal 4Nominal wages are labor compensation (including employers™ 
social security contributions) per employee hour worked.
wage growth has also slowed ½ percentage point 

to about 0.4 percent since 2011. 
Part of the EU15 wage moderation r
e˛ects an unwinding of a wage overhang that emerged after 

the global ˝nancial crisis. Panel 6 in Figure
 2.3 shows cumulative gro
wth in real wages relative 
to the trend level of labor productivity.
5 After some decline in the ˝rst half of the 2000s, 
real wages were broadly stable relative to trend 

labor productivity during 2005Œ08.
6 ˜e global ˝nancial crisis led to a 2 percentage point jump 
in this ratio during 2009 as nominal wage 
rises continued at almost 3½ percent despite 

the sharp fall in in˛ation and slowing tr
end productivity. Low real wage increases in the years 

that followed gradually unwound this overhang. 

˜e real wage level returned to its 2005Œ08 

average relative to productivity by 2017, at a 

time when unemployment was just ½ percentage 
5Labor productivity is GDP per employee hour worked. ˜e trend 
in labor productivity is a more useful benchmark because actual 
productivity is subject to signi˝cant cyclical and temporary volatility, 

whereas wages are relatively smooth.
6˜is earlier decline was largest and most prolonged in Germany, 
but there were also adjustments in Austria, Belgium, the Nether
-
lands, and Sweden, along with Portugal and Spain.

 (Year-over-year percent change, four-quarter average)
Wage rises slowed sharply in 2010, to average 1½ percent since 2011, down 
from just over 3 percent in 2003Œ09 ...... after a sharp deceleration in price in˜ation during 2009, to about
1Œ1½ percent from 2Œ2½ percent.Growth in the estimated trend in labor productivity also slowed substantially ...... while unemployment rose in 2008Œ09 and in 2011Œ13, before declining from 
2014 back toward precrisis levels.Real wages rose in 2009Œ10 as nominal wages slowed later than in˜ation. 
Subsequently, real wage growth was very low for some years, ˚rming to about 
½ percent by 2015Œ17. The cumulative impact was a sharp rise in real wages relative to trend 
productivity during 2009, which gradually unwound, to reach 2006 levels in

point higher than in 2005Œ08. Country cases 
of slow wage growth also display a correction of 

wage overhangs, although a wage freeze played 

a signi˝cant role in Belgium in recent years. 

For euro area countries, the direction of wages 

since the global ˝nancial crisis has been broadly 

consistent with rebalancing of their external 

positions, although further adjustments will be 

appropriate in some cases, as discussed in Box
 2.1.In contrast, wage increases in new
er EU members have picked up strongly in recent 

years as unemployment has fallen to low levels 

(Figure
 2.4). A more rapid decline in nominal 
wage increases since the global ˝nancial crisis 

ensured that ther
e was no lasting wage overhang 
in the newer members. Nominal wage growth 

of about 3½ percent in 2011Œ15 kept real wages 
stable relativ
e to productivity, at about 1
 percent 
below historical normsŠre˛ecting the period 

of high unemployment in the newer members 
following the global ˝nancial crisis. But nominal 

wage growth picked up rapidly in 2016Œ17, 

hitting close to 6 percent year ov
er year on average 
in 2017. ˜is wage acceleration followed a steeper 

decline in unemployment, averaging 5
 percentage 
points since the end of 2012, bringing 
unemployment down to an av
erage of 6 percent 
by the end of 2017, in line with precrisis lo
ws.As a result, real wages in newer EU members 

have risen relative to trend productivity to 

levels comparable to precrisis peaks, when 

unemployment was similarly low. In˛ation has 

risen in recent years, but only modestly, so that 

real wage gains also surged to 4.1
 percent year 
ov
er year in 2017, well above estimates of trend 
productivity growth, which averaged about 

2 percent. ˜e cumulative e˚ect is that the average 
ratio of real wages to trend labor productivity 
was roughly 2½
 percent higher than its historical 
average in 2017, a level ex
ceeded only in mid-2008 for just two quarters.
Labor markets are notably tighter in newer EU 
member states, consistent with wage divergence 

from the EU15. Both unemployment gaps 

and surveys of labor shortages indicate tighter 

labor market conditions in the newer members 
(Figure
 2.5).7 Slack in those countries is estimated 
to have largely disappeared by about mid
-2015, which is consistent with the timing of the wage 
acceleration in recent years. Labor shortages 

exceed precrisis peaks in the newer membersŠand 
are especially strong in industry, which may help 

explain the recent very strong pace of real wage 

growth in these countries. Yet other domestic 

factors and perhaps spillovers from the EU15 labor 

market recovery could also be at work.
Typical lags in adjustment between labor slack 
and wages could also help explain EU15 wage 
moderation in recent years. In EU15 countries, 

unemployment only recently fell in line with 

the estimated nonaccelerating in˛ation rate 
of unemployment (NAIRU). Analysis of the 

correlations between real wages (as deviations from 

trend productivity) and unemployment gaps ˝nds 

that these correlations are initially higher in newer 

EU members and that they peak after six quarters; 
in EU15 countries these correlations start lo
wer 
and peak after eight quarters (Figure
 2.6). Low EU15 nominal wage growth o
verall is not 
clearly underpinned by unusual real wage behav-

ior, but the drivers of rapid wage increases in the 

newer EU members clearly merit further analysis. 

After allowing for some correction of earlier wage 

overhangs and for typical lags in the wage response 

to declining unemployment, EU15 real wages do 

not as yet appear out of line with developments 

in productivity and unemployment. ˜is suggests 

a need to explore the role of in˛ation and in˛a-

tion expectations in driving low nominal wage 

growth, but it also leaves scope for cross
-border 
spillovers to contribute to wage moderation and 

low in˛ation. In newer members, low domestic 
slack is consistent with the strength of wages, but 

the role of other factors, such as spillovers from 

EU15 labor markets, still merits analysis given the 

recent noticeable pickup in EU15 employment 

growth. Together with appreciably higher wages, 

this makes the EU15 an attractive destination for 
7Unemployment gaps are subject to uncertainty around the 
NAIRU, which is based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) estimates for OECD members and 

Hodrick-Prescott (HP) ˝lters for other countries. Analytical results 

are similar when applying an HP ˝lter in all cases.

Evolving Employment Arrangements and 
Measuring SlackPotential explanations of wage moderation include 
declines in employment security after the global 

˝nancial crisis and the potential for continued 
labor market slack despite falls in unemployment. 

In some EU countries, there has been a shift 

from regular contracts to self
-employment, 
temporary contracts, and part-time jobs. I
f these employment arrangements are less secure, they 

could reduce workers™ bargaining power and hence 

put downward pressures on wages. If such workers 

are also less fully employed, the underlying slack 

in the labor market may be larger than previously 

thought for a given level of unemployment.

a result con˝rmed for Sweden (IMF 2017a) and 
the United Kingdom (IMF 2018), with UK wages 

also sensitive to cyclical self-employment.
EU employment arrangements remained 
broadly stable over the past several years, 

but underemployment indicators, especially 

involuntary part-time employment changed 

notably (Figure
 2.7). Partly re˛ecting rising 
female participation, there has been a trend rise in 
part-time employment, whereas other indicators 

of the security of employment arrangements 

have been mostly stable, including the share of 

temporary employment and self-employment. ˜e 

OECD measure of involuntary part
-time jobs as a share of total employment rose star
ting in the early 2000s and peaked in 2014, which could 
potentially have contributed to wage moderation 

in recent years. Following the global ˝nancial 

crisis, some increases were also recorded in the 

share of people marginally attached to the labor 

force (that is, those who are not unemployed 

under typical labor force surveys, but who 

intend to work), but there has been a decline in 

recent years. 
 Aggregate EU developments mask some 

heterogeneities across regions and countries. In 

contrast with EU-wide developments, Germany 

managed to bring down involuntary part-time 

employment following the global ˝nancial crisis 

(Figure
 2.8). Newer EU members r
ecorded a 
declining share of people marginally attached 

to the labor force, consistent with declining 

unemployment in those countries, but in the 

EU15 there has been much less of a decline in the 

marginally attached. Underneath the relatively 

stable developments for temporary contracts 

and self-employment at the EU level, the share 
of temporary contracts has been rising in newer 
EU members, particularly in the years before the 

global ˝nancial crisis. Self-employment in the 

Netherlands and the United Kingdom has been 

higher as well. 
At the EU level, the share of involuntary 
part-time jobs and the share of those marginally 

attached to the labor force appear to be useful 

additional measures of economic slack. Both 

shares have increased since the global ˝nancial 

crisis, and, across countries, the changes relative 

to precrisis levels are positively correlated with the

changes in the unemployment rates, suggesting 
that they may capture cyclical information 

(Figure
 2.9). On the other hand, the shares of 
self-employment and temporar
y contracts did not increase visibly after the crisis. Across countries, 

the changes from precrisis levels have weak or 

even negative correlation with the changes in 

unemployment rates.
A nonemployment index, combining the 
unemployment rate with the measures discussed 

above, could provide greater information about 

slack. As discussed in Byrne and Conefrey (2017), 

the index incorporates potential labor input 
from those
 currently unemployed, marginally 
attached to the labor force, and underemployed. 
Across countries, changes in the nonemployment 

index appear somewhat positively correlated with 

the changes in unemployment rates, although 

the correlation is not perfect (Figure
 2.10). ˜is suggests that the nonemployment index 

potentially captures additional information that is 

not embedded in the unemployment rate.
Recent literature suggests using the intensive 
margin, or hours worked per person, as a further 
indicator of labor market slack (Figure
 2.11). In a Phillips curv
e analysis of the wages in the euro area and its ˝ve largest economies, Bulligan, 

Guglielminetti, and Viviano (2017) ˝nd that 

the intensive margin of labor utilization is 

relevant for wage growth. Moreover, they ˝nd 

the shape of the Phillips curve becomes ˛atter for 

lower levels of hours per worker. Labor market 

arrangements in Germany, which tend to reduce 

hours to limit job losses, may make this indicator 
particularly relevant. 
A simple correlation analysis ˝nds that most of 
these slack indicators have signi˝cantly di˚erent 

information. As expected, the highest correlations

via labor market slack. For example, migrant

relocation and outsourcing shift the demand for 
labor between countries. Accordingly, this section 

illustrates interconnections between EU goods and 

labor markets, providing stylized facts on labor 

movement and global value chains.
Labor Market IntegrationNew accessions to the European Union since 

2004 facilitated a rise in migration from these 

countries to the EU15, although migration from 

outside the European Union has also been sizable 

(Figure
 2.12; Box
 2.3). Intra-EU migration is 
largely from new member states to the EU15, 

driven by di˚erences in wage levels. Between 
2000 and 2015, the stock of migrants from new 

members in the EU15 tripled to 2.1 percent of 
the EU15 population. In large part this migration 

took place before the global ˝nancial crisis, but it continued over 2010Œ15, in part as some 

new members gained free access to key EU15 

countries, with a lag.9 In contrast, migration 
stocks within new members and from EU15 
9For example, Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union 
in 2007, yet their workers gained free mobility to Austria, Belgium, 
France, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands only in 2014.

countries to new members remained broadly 
stable as shares of the respective populations, and 

within the EU15 migrant stocks, rose gradually to 

2.5 percent of the EU15 population.
10 Migration 
from outside the European Union has been large, 

with migrants to the EU15 coming mainly from 

the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s, from 

former colonial countries, and in recent years as 

refugees. Migration from outside the European 

Union to newer members does not appear to be 

signi˝cant, with some exceptions (for example, 

Poland has seen very large in˛ows from Ukraine).
Alongside increased migration, EU labor market 
integration has intensi˝ed through posted workers 

and cross-border workers. ﬁPosted workersﬂ are 

employees sent by their employer to carry out a 

service in another EU country on a temporary 

basis. For example, a service provider may win a 

contract in another country and send employees 

there to deliver the services. Posted workers di˚er 

from EU mobile workers in that they remain 

in the host EU country temporarily and do not 

integrate into its labor market, yet they can still 

a˚ect the host country™s labor market slack.
11 Net in˛ows of posted workers to some EU15 

countriesŠespecially GermanyŠhave increased 

since 2007, matched by rising net out˛ows from 

newer members such as Slovenia and the Slovak 

Republic (Figure
 2.13). In addition, the number 
of ﬁcross-bor
der workersﬂ who live in one EU 
country and work in another was estimated at 

1.3 million (or 0.6 percent of the total employed) 
across the European Union in 2015.
12 Most emigrants from newer EU member countries 

are highly educated, causing skill shortages in the 

home countries. ˜e education levels of newer 

EU member emigrants tend to be higher than 
their home-country averages (IMF 2016).
 ˜e 10Migration among the EU15 countries includes retirees who do 
not increase the labor supply.
11On the contrary, EU mobile citizens who go to another member 
state to seek work are entitled to equal treatment with nationals in 
access to employment, working conditions, and all other social and 

tax conditions.
12Cross-border workers include ﬁfrontier workersﬂ who return to 
their country or residence daily or at least once a week and ﬁseasonal 

workersﬂ who work in another EU member state for a limited 

amount of time.
prevalence of better-educated and working-age 
people among emigrants leaving newer member 

countries has signi˝cantly reduced the supply 

of skilled labor, with the brain drain most 

prominent in the Baltics, potentially contributing 

to the recent hikes in wages in these countries. 

Furthermore, the large-scale emigration may also 

have slowed growth and income convergence 

with the EU15, while also contributing to ˝scal 
burdens from the higher dependency ratio.
Goods Market Integration˜e rise of global supply chains and fragmentation 
of production across borders a˚ects labor markets 

in the short and long term. In the short term, for 

countries that are highly integrated into global 

supply chains, domestic conditions (such as the 
demand for labor) become more sensitive to 

global production cycles, leading to increased 

business cycle synchronization (IMF 2013). From 

a long-term perspective, o˚shoring increases 

cross-border wage linkages across countries 

(Feenstra and Hanson 1997; Grossman and 

Rossi-Hansberg 2008). In addition, o˚shoring

(or the threat of it) further reduces the bargaining 
power of labor (Harrison 2002). On the other 

hand, demand for labor in emerging market 

economies (or the destination of o˚shoring) 
becomes increasingly linked to external conditions.
EU countries are highly integrated through 
pan-European supply chains. On average 

70 percent of exports of goods and services of 
EU countries represents trade in intermediate 
goods that are part of supply chains (Figure
 2.14, panel 1). ˜is share is signi˝cantly higher than 

in other parts of the world and has been on the 

rise in the Eur
opean Union, particularly over 
2000Œ07, helped by the expansion of global trade 

and EU enlargement (Figure
 2.14, panel 2). EU linkages are generally stronger than non-EU 

linkages, as on average two-thir
ds of foreign value 
added in EU exports originates from within the 

European Union. 
Germany plays a key role in EU supply chains. 
Over time, the integration of EU countries has 

increased the most with Germany, followed by 

China, and to a lesser extent with France and Italy.
Germany is by far the most important source 

of intermediate inputs for many EU countries, 
followed by France, the United Kingdom, and 

Italy (Figure
 2.15). A point worth noting is 
the role of Germany acting as a hub
, with large in˛ows and out˛ows of intermediate goods and 

services ˛owing through Germany to various EU 

countries. Global value chain linkages outside 

Europe (to China and the United States) appear 

fairly small compared with pan-European linkages 

and possibly go through Germany as well. 
Foreign direct investment ˛ows within the 
European Union mirror these tightly knit supply 

chains. As supply chains have expanded in 

newer EU members, the stock of foreign direct 

investment has also been increasing in those 

countries over time (Figure
 2.16, panels 1 and 3). Within the European U
nion, newer members are 
the largest recipients of foreign direct investment; 

EU15 countries are generally net foreign direct 

investment exporters, and this pattern has 

remained broadly the same over time. In line with

investment to newer EU members is from within 
Europe and 85
 percent from within the Eur
opean Union. Germany and Austria are major senders of 

foreign direct investment to central, eastern, and 

southeastern Europe, while Sweden is the largest 

˝nancier in the Baltics (Figure
 2.16, panel 2). It appears that supply chain integration has 

increased the sensitivity of labor markets to 

external conditions, particularly for highly integrated newer member states. Integration 

into global supply chains contributes to 
synchronization of business cycles across 

economies (Figure
 2.17, panel 1). External 
conditions are transmitted to the domestic 

economy through v
arious channels. Regarding 
labor market outcomes, indicators of labor 

shortages for EU countries are highly correlated 

with indicators of external demand (for example, 
aggregate EU industrial production), particularly 

for more integrated newer member states 

(Figure
 2.17, panel 2). ˜e sensitivity of labor shortages to external conditions has increased ov
er time for both the newer members and the EU15, 

but labor shortages in the newer members are 
more sensitive to global shocks than in the EU15 

(Figure
 2.17, panel 3). Nevertheless, a formal 
empirical analysis that includes all the various drivers of wage dynamics is neededŠthis is the 

subject of the next section.Exploring Drivers of European Wage Behavior
EU integration could make wages in EU countries more dependent on labor market conditions, 

including wages, in other countries.13 Firms in 
di˚erent countries across the European Union 

are often competing in goods markets both 

within and outside the union, and increasingly 

in services as these become more tradable. In 

wage bargaining, ˝rms will seek to preserve cost 

competitiveness across these markets, while 

unions and workers will also consider risks to 

˝rms™ sales and employment. Hence, wage growth 

in one country may have a direct spillover on 

wage setting in others. Higher labor market 

slack in another country could indicate future 

wage moderation, which may also impact wages 
elsewhere. Such spillovers could strengthen with 

the increasing integration of European goods 

and labor markets through labor movement and 

relocation of production.
Recent work on wage drivers in some EU 
countries provides evidence of such spillovers from 

foreign wages and labor market slack. For Sweden, 

the IMF (2017a) ˝nds that in the long term real 

wages are determined by labor productivity. But 

the growth in Swedish nominal wages shows a 

sizable spillover from German wage growth, and 

this linkage became stronger beginning in the 

early 2000s. A second spillover channel operates 

via changes in euro area unemployment, with a 
13Being a member of a currency union could also a˚ect wage 
dynamics. We tested this for the newer EU members in the empir
-ical analysis by using an interaction dummy on slack for euro area 

membership. ˜e estimates for the dummy suggest that there is 

no structural break in the relationship between wages and unem
-
ployment in the newer EU economies (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 

Slovak Republic, Slovenia) after they joined the euro area. But we 

acknowledge that this test is imperfect, for various reasons. For 

older euro area members we did not test this because our data only 

start in 1995.

˜e EU15 countries outside the euro area are not 
analyzed given the recent studies on Sweden and 

the United Kingdom. Italy was initially included 

in the ﬁother euro areaﬂ panel, but the trend level 

of labor productivity has been almost ˛at. It has 

risen only 1 percent cumulatively since 2002, 
resulting in lo
w explanatory power and unreliable 
estimates of the long-term impact of productivity 

on real wage levels.
15 ˜e reported results are for 
total labor compensation (national accounts) per 
employee hourŠwhich includes social security 

contributions of employersŠbut estimates of 

the same speci˝cations using data on wages and 
salaries per employee hour and the labor cost 

index yield similar results.
˜e key steps are as follows:

(1) Long-term models of real wages based on trend 
labor productivity are estimated.
 Labor productivity 
is the principal driver of real product wages in 
the long term, as seen in the relatively narrow 

range of variations in the ratio of real wages 

to productivity in Figures 2.3 and 2.4, despite 

substantial variation in productivity growth across 

time and countries.16 A trend measure of labor 
productivity is preferred since wages show inertia 

through short-term and cyclical productivity 

swings. Separate ordinary least squares regressions 

for each country are used to allow for di˚erences 

in long-term impacts of productivity. In the 

euro area countries, the e˚ects of reforms are 

controlled for using a database on major reforms 

(IMF 2017d). In the case of some small European 

countries, the potential for a long-term spillover 
from for
eign wages is explored. For newer EU 
members, the long-term real wage model includes 

only domestic productivityŠthe convergence of 

wages to the EU15 levels in the long term hinges 
15Kangur (2018) ˝nds that Italian wages show low responsiveness 
to ˝rm-speci˝c productivity, regional disparities, and skill mis
-matches and that rigid nominal wages imply that adjustment occurs 

through lower pro˝ts and employment.
16Modeling the level of real product wages implies a restriction 
that nominal wages respond to the GDP de˛ator with a unity 

coe˙cient in the long run that is consistent with economic theory. 

But the short-term error correction models of nominal wage growth 

allow real wages to be a˚ected temporarily by in˛ation shocks. In 

contrast, the Phillips curve without the error correction model term 

imposes no long-term restrictions on the impact of in˛ation and 

productivity on wages (see Blanchard and Katz 1999).
on productivity convergence by the newer EU 
members since ˝rms must generate adequate 
pro˝ts to remain viable. Newer EU member labor 

markets tend to be relatively ˛exible, with no 

major reforms evident in the sample period.
(2) Short
-term baseline models are estimated for 
nominal wage gro
wth.17 ˜ese include a set of core 
variables that are standard in the Phillips curve 
literature and Chapter
 2 of the October 2017 
WEO: lagged in˛ation, in˛ation expectations, 
trend productivity gr
owth, the unemployment gap 
(both level and change), and lagged wage growth. 

Adding the fourth lag of the residual from the 

long-term equation to this Phillips curve gives the 

error correction model speci˝cation. In view of the 

relatively rich parametrization, panel estimation 

is used to ensure more robust estimates, except 

for Germany.
(3) ˜e impact of broader indicators of slack is 
assessed. In both the Phillips curve and the error 

correction model, the nonemployment index 

gap is assessed as an alternative to headline 

unemployment. For Germany, involuntary 

part-time employment is included separately, 

similarly to Sweden and the United Kingdom. 

Based on Bulligan, Guglielminetti, and Viviano 

(2017), the intensive margin (hours worked per 

employee) is also included.
(4) Spillovers from external unemployment and wages 
and the impact of migration are estimated. 
To limit 
the scope for spillovers to re˛ect the omission 

of relevant domestic factors, a preferred baseline 

speci˝cation including broader indicators of slack 

is used. Variables for external unemployment and 

foreign wages are added sequentially. Migration 

˛ows are the last variable added, in part because 

data for 2016Œ17 are not yet available.
Long-Term Analysis
Structural reforms are found to a˚ect the level of 

real wages in the long term and some long
-term 17Modeling the four-quarter growth rate is consistent with 
wage-setting practices and allows dynamics over a one- to two-year 
period to be modeled with fewer estimated parameters.

wage spillovers are found in smaller euro area 
countries (Table
 2.1):18Ł Germany:
 ˜e Hartz reforms implemented in 

2003Œ05 are found to lower the equilibrium 

real wage by 5½ percent, and the long-term 
productivity coe˙cient is close to unity.
19 Absent the reform dummy, the latter 

coe˙cient is 0.73, which is too low given 

the near parallel trends in real wages and 

productivity both before the Hartz reforms 

and since the global ˝nancial crisis.Ł France and Spain:
 Long-term real wage developments depend on domestic 

productivity trends. In Spain, reforms, 

including unemployment bene˝ts, reduce real 

wages by an estimated 4
 percent.
20 In France, 
such a dummy has a counterintuitive positive 
18A Dickey-Fuller test rejects a unit root in the residuals of most 
country equations, consistent with a cointegrating relationship 
between real wages and productivity.
19From the outset of reforms in the ˝rst quarter of 2003, the 
Hartz reform dummy rises from 0.1 in steps of 0.1 each quarter to 

reach 1 in the second quarter of 2015, just after the ˝nal stage of 

these reforms.
20An employment protection reform dummy is also statistically 
signi˝cant for Spain, but it results in an implausibly high estimated 

parameter (about 1.5) on labor productivity. See IMF (2015) for 

a more comprehensive analysis of the impact of the 2012 labor 

market reforms.
sign, as it was implemented close to the global ˝nancial crisis, a period when French real 

product wages rose about 3
 percent relative to 
productivity, owing to nominal wage growth 
inertia. In France, this real wage increase has 

not subsequently unwound, unlike in other 
EU15 countries.Ł ˜e Netherlands and Austria:
 Wages in these 
two countries are driven principally by 

domestic productivity, but German wages 

(de˛ated by the domestic GDP de˛ator of 

each country) also have a long-term impact 

with a coe˙cient of about 0.2. ˜is re˛ects 

the domestic wage-setting anchor that 
Germany provides in these two countries, 

consistent with their high interconnection 

with the German economy. In Austria, 

reforms of employment protection are found 

to reduce real wages by 3
 percent.
Ł Belgium:
 French wages, in addition to 

German wages, are found to have a lasting 
e˚ect on Belgian wages. ˜is ˝nding is 

broadly consistent with a 1996 law that links 

Belgian wage setting to wage developments in

In the newer EU members, productivity gains are 
generally translated into similar real wage rises over 

the long term (Table
 2.2). In the Czech R
epublic, Estonia, Latvia, the Slovak Republic, and to a 

lesser extent Slovenia, the coe˙cient on labor 

productivity is close to unity. Poland and Hungary 

are outliers. In the case of Poland, the low 

coe˙cient appears to re˛ect real wage levels that 

are exceptionally high relative to productivity in 

the early years of the sample, a public sector wage 

freeze after the crisis, and the surge in temporary 

foreign migrant workers in more recent yearsŠ

the impact of which is not captured in o˙cial 

statistics. In Hungary, some data issuesŠincluding 

discontinuities in hours worked that a˚ect both 

wages and productivityŠmay contribute to the 

very low coe˙cient estimate.
Short-Term Regional Panel Analysis
In the regional panel analyses, the preferred 

baseline model is the error correction model 

using the nonemployment index gap rather than 

unemployment, with hours per employee as an 

additional slack indicator.
22 Baseline Phillips curve 
model estimates are presented in column (1) of 
weights on foreign wages are sensitive to changing the dependent 
variable to wages and salaries (which exclude social security contribu
-
tions by employers), with the estimated weights on French real wages 

lower at 0.194 and those on German wages higher at 0.163.
22For the euro area excluding Germany, estimation of a 
six-country panel including Italy gave similar results to those in 

Table
 2.3 column (8), but hours 
per person are not signi˝cant, and 
the mix of spillovers di˚ers, with a larger coe˙cient on euro area 

wage growth and a smaller and insigni˝cant coe˙cient on changes 

in euro area unemployment. But, as noted above, the long-term 

estimates may be less reliable given the near absence of productivity 

growth since 2002 in Italy.
Tables 2.3 and 2.4, with columns (2) and (3) 
progressively including broader slack indicators. 

Columns (4) to (6) are similar, but also include 

the error correction model term. ˜e explanatory 

variables are lagged four to ˝ve quarters, with the 

exception of changes in unemployment or the 

nonemployment index, which are often included 

in wage equations in part to proxy short-term 

unemployment. ˜e wage Phillips curves have 

sensible properties, with sizable e˚ects from 

trend productivity growth, expected in˛ation, 

lagged in˛ation in the case of the other euro 

area region, and indicators of slack. ˜e notably 

higher coe˙cients on slack in the newer member 

states indicate greater real wage ˛exibility, which 

will aid adjustment to asymmetric shocks.23 Columns (4) to (8) show that the error correction 

parameter is sizable (Œ0.36 in ﬁother euro areaﬂ 

and Œ0.40 in newer member states), and highly 

signi˝cantŠfurther evidence consistent with the 

above long-term equations being cointegrating 

relationships.
24 ˜e error correction model 
with the nonemployment index gap has more 

explanatory power than that for unemployment, 

with the gain larger for newer member states than 

for the ﬁother euro areaﬂ panel.
2523Panel regressions that replace the nonemployment index gap 
with both unemployment and changes in involuntary part-time 
employment, while retaining the hours gap, yield similar results.
24Note that the error correction model term is at the fourth lag, 
so roughly 40
 percent of a deviation fr
om long-term equilibrium 
is corrected each year, or 64
 percent after two y
ears and 78
 percent 
after three y
ears.25Although the parameter on trend labor productivity growth 
tends to be lower in the error correction model, productivity also 

a˚ects wages through the error correction model term, and in the 

long run the impact of productivity on real wages is higher in the 

error correction model.

Spillovers are found to have signi˝cant e˚ects 
on wage growth in the ﬁother euro areaﬂ panel 

and especially in the newer member states. In 

the other euro area countries, changes in euro 

area unemployment (lagged two quarters) and 

the growth rate in euro area wages (lagged three 

quarters) are both statistically signi˝cant (column 

8).26 German wages were not found to be 
statistically signi˝cant, hence they are not reported 

here. In the newer member states, changes in 

unemployment in the euro area (columns 8 and 

9) have substantial and signi˝cant impacts on 

wage growth, with short lags, suggesting that 

wages need to respond quickly to improving job 

opportunities in euro area countries to help retain 

workers. ˜e growth rate in euro area wages also 

has a signi˝cant impact (column 9), consistent 
with anecdotal reports that developments in 

euro area wages are the starting point for wage 

bargaining in many newer member states.
Increases in net migration in˛ows are found to 
weigh on subsequent wage growth in both regions, 

but the impact is modest and temporary. Column 

(9) adds the four-quarter change in net migration 
in˛ows in the prior year as a shar
e of the labor force. Controlling for domestic slack and regional 

developments, a rise in in˛ows by 1

27 But 
in practice, the changes in net migration ˛ows 

are generally small relative to the labor force, 

so the wage e˚ects are also small. ˜ese e˚ects 

are also temporary, as they re˛ect the change in 

migration ˛ows rather than the level, and wages 

also converge back to long-term equilibrium over 

time. Interestingly, when migration is separated 

into in˛ows and out˛ows, the latter have a 

larger coe˙cient, although the di˚erence is not 

statistically signi˝cant. Nonetheless, it suggests 
26For the smaller euro area economies, there are also spillovers 
through the error correction model term.
27˜e lag structure helps address concerns that migration is endog

growth, with knock-on e˚ects on labor market slack.
that at least in the near term, migrants to a country are not perfect substitutes for people in 

the domestic workforce.
Short-Term Analysis of Germany
For Germany, the growth in involuntary part-time 

employment proved to be a key indicator of slack 

(Table
 2.5). ˜e wage Phillips curve again has 
sensible properties, with quite high responsiveness 
to the unemployment gap, trend productivity, and 

in˛ation expectations. A nonemployment index 

was also signi˝cant, but the coe˙cient on the 
growth rate in labor productivity became negative. 

Given the longer sample available for Germany, 

changes in involuntary part-time employment 

were included separately, with the sizable 

coe˙cient perhaps re˛ecting the more widespread 

use of changes in employee hours to avoid layo˚s. 

˜e error correction term is particularly high 

(about Œ0.6), and it contributes substantially to 
explanatory power, making the error correction 

model with the changes in involuntary 

employment the best baseline model.
German wage setting appears to be anchored on 
domestic labor market conditions and less sensitive 

to spillovers than either of the regional panels. 

German wages are not found to be responsive to 

changes in euro area unemployment (column 7 in 

Table
 2.5), while the estimated coe˙cient on euro 
area wage gro
wth has the opposite sign (column 8) from that expected from a spillover. Changes in 

net migration ˛ows also do not have a statistically 

signi˝cant impact on German wages (column 9).
Factors Driving Wages 
within RegionsIn the ﬁother euro area,ﬂ in˛ation and in˛ation 
expectations have been key factors behind 

variations in nominal wage growth, together with 

domestic and external slack, with the correction 

of past wage overhangs also moderating wages

2.3 percentage points in 2010 is linked to lower 
in˛ation expectations (0.8 percentage point), 
lower past in˛ation (0.5
 percentage point), 
domestic labor slack (0.6 percentage point), 
and the error correction (0.3
 percentage point), 
as wage rises remained solid in 2009 even as 
in˛ation and productivity growth fell. ˜e error 
correction continued to weigh on wages by 0.2 

to 0.3 percentage point during 2011Œ15, helping 
account for wage moderation. During 2011Œ13, 

in˛ation expectations and actual in˛ation 
reco
vered, lifting their combined contribution to 
wage growth by 0.9
 percentage point. But the euro 
area crisis meant that domestic and external slack began to weigh more heavily on wages during 

2012 Œ14, with a total drag of 0.6 percentage point 
on wage growth in both 2013 and 2014. ˜is drag 

was ampli˝ed by the contributions from in˛ation 
expectations and in˛ation falling sharply during 
2014Œ15 by 0.9
 percentage point, with only a 
slight increase seen by 2017.
In the newer member states, declines in both 
domestic and foreign slack have contributed to 
wages picking up in recent years, based on average 

results from the eight-country panel (Figure
 2.19). ˜e sharp halt in wage rises in 2009 re˛ected large 

negative contributions from both rising domestic 

slack and rising euro area unemployment, plus 
some error correction drag. Even as the high 

level of domestic and external slack continued 

to drag on wage rises during 2010Œ14, by 2011 

the declines in domestic slack began to support 

wages, while declines in euro area unemployment 

began to support wages beginning in 2014. By 

2016Œ17, the low level of domestic slack began 

to reinforce wage rises. Yet this combination of 

domestic and external pressures does not fully 

account for the extent of wage acceleration during 
2016Œ17, which may be partly due to migration. 

However, data on migration in recent years are not 

yet available.
In Germany, domestic labor market conditions 
and in˛ation expectations have been key factors 

behind variations in nominal wage growth 

(Figure
 2.20). ˜e steep initial fall in wage growth 
by 2.9
 percentage points in 2010 is linked to lower 
in˛ation expectations (0.9 percentage point), 
domestic labor slack (0.3 percentage point), 
and the error correction (1
 percentage point). 
Domestic slack also weighed on wages in 2011,

and has not become a source of upward wage 
pressure in more recent years. During 2011Œ13, 

in˛ation expectations recovered, lifting the 

contribution of those expectations to wage growth 

by 0.8
 percentage point. Wage gr
owth higher 
than 3 percent in 2012, despite low in˛ation 
and productivity gr
owth, led to a signi˝cant 
error correction drag on wages during 2012Œ14, 

peaking at 0.7 percentage point in 2013. ˜is 
drag was ampli˝ed by the contributions from 

in˛ation expectations falling during 2014Œ15 
by 0.4 percentage point, with a slight additional 
decline in 2017. ˜e scale and nature of spillov
ers can be illustrated through a scenario analysis of a rise in German 
wage growth (Figure
 2.21). For illustrative 
purposes, hourly wage rates in Germany ar
e assumed to rise 1 percentage point faster than in a 
baseline, which would raise euro area wage gr
owth 
by about 0.4
 percentage point given Germany
™s 
weight in the euro area. ˜is would spill over 

into the growth of wages in both regional panels. 

Moreover, higher German wages also spill over 

through the long-term equations for Austria, 

Belgium, and the Netherlands. Overall, wage 
growth in the euro area excluding Germany rises 

about 0.1 percent after one
 year and 0.2
 percent 
in the medium term. ˜e impact on newer EU 

member country wages is slightly larger in the near term (about 0.15 percent after one year), but 
fades to zer
o over time because in the long term 
real wages in the newer member states depend 

only on domestic labor productivity. To the extent 

that higher wages lead to higher in˛ation, through 

either domestic demand or cost channels, the 
medium-term impact on wages would be higher 
than these simulations indicate. Impacts of Regional Differences in Wage Formation
In newer EU members, greater wage sensitivity to 
domestic labor slack and external developments 

help account for the faster wage increases in 

these countries (Figure
 2.22). Wages are found 
to be more responsive to domestic labor slack 
in the newer members, with the coe˙cients on 

the nonemployment gap and hours gap about 

two times larger (column 8), and the impact of 
changes in nonemployment is much larger in 

the newer members than in the EU15, so wages 

also respond more rapidly to slack. Hence, in the 

wake of the global ˝nancial crisis, the adverse 

impact of domestic slack on newer member state 

wage growth was much larger than in the euro 

area excluding Germany. In more recent years, as 

discussed earlier in this chapter, domestic slack has 

diminished more rapidly in the newer member 

states, with an estimated contribution to wage 
growth of about 2
 percentage points. In addition, 
wage dynamics in the new
er members are also 
found to be more sensitive to external labor 

market developments, with combined spillovers 

from euro area unemployment and euro area wage 

rises accounting for about 1½ percentage points of 

the wage pickup in the newer members, compared 

with less than ½ percentage point in the euro area 

excluding Germany during 2015Œ17. 
In the euro area, subdued in˛ation has been 
a key factor weighing on wage rises in recent 

years (Figure
 2.23). Compared with the new EU

members, expected and lagged in˛ation are much 
more important factors driving wage formation in 

the EU15, with the coe˙cient on lagged in˛ation 
much more signi˝cant and the contribution from 

expected in˛ation more than two times higher 

in the EU15 than in the newer member states. 

Despite some recent increases in actual in˛ation, 

near-term expected in˛ation in the euro area 

remains subdued. ˜us, the overall contribution 

of in˛ation expectations to wage increases declined 

by half a percentage point during 2016Œ17 

compared with 2012Œ13. 
To summarize, wage developments in the EU15 
and newer EU members are driven by di˚erent 

factors. In the EU15, wages typically respond 

very slowly to changes in unemployment and 

are closely related to in˛ation and in˛ation 

expectations. Viewed against this evidence, 

current wage developments are not unusual, 

rather, in˛ation and in˛ation expectations are 

unusually low. By contrast, in the newer EU 

members, the econometric evidence suggests that 
wage growth responds very quickly to changes 

in unemployment. ˜is, together with lower 

importance of in˛ation and in˛ation expectations,

explains why wage growth in these states is 
now running much higher. Other factors, such 

as cross-country labor market spillovers, also 

play a role in wage growth. For the EU15, this 

role is smaller than that of labor market slack 

and in˛ation. For the newer EU members, it is 

smaller than the role of slack but larger than that 

of in˛ation.Expectations, Wages, 
Understanding wage dynamics and how the role of 
key factors, such as slack, in˛ation, and in˛ation 
expectations, has evolved over time is particularly 

important for policymakers. Has the sluggish wage 

growth in the euro area been due to a ˛attening 

of the wage Phillips curve? Or is it because 

wages have become more tied to low in˛ation 

expectations, which have themselves become less 

anchored to targets given prolonged low in˛ation? 

Did wage moderation contribute to low in˛ation 

in the euro area, and what are the implications 

for getting in˛ation back to the European Central 

Bank™s target? In the newer member states, would 

the already strong wage growth accelerate given 

the tight labor market conditions? How much of 

this wage growth, given productivity, would be 

passed to in˛ation?To shed light on these questions, this section 
investigates how the role of slack, in˛ation, and 

in˛ation expectations has changed over time. 

Speci˝cally, it looks at (1) how anchored in˛ation 

expectations have remained over time; (2) how the 

parameters of the baseline Phillips curve estimated 

earlier in this chapter have evolved over time; 

and (3) the extent of the pass-through from wage 

growth to in˛ation. Separate analyses are done for 

the EU15 and the newer EU members, in part 

because the chapter ˝nds notable di˚erences in 

wage behavior between these regions.
˜e anchoring of in˛ation expectations is analyzed 

by assessing whether in˛ation expectations are 

systematically sensitive to movements in actual 

in˛ation. Drawing on similar approaches in 

the literature (see Chapter
 3 of the April 2013
 WEO; Str
ohsal, Melnick, and Nautz 2016; and 
Lyziak and Paloviita 2017), the equation below is 

estimated for the euro area countries and newer 

EU members with quarterly data beginning in the 

˝rst quarter of 1998, wherever data are available, 

until the third quarter of 2017:
  ˙  t  e  
ˆ  ˙ ¯   
= ˜ + ˚ ( ˙  t   ˆ  
˙ ¯  )  
+  ˛  t  ,  (2.1)in which   
˙  t  e  
 represents a measure of in˛ation 
expectations,   ˙  t    actual in˛ation, and 
  ˙ ¯   
 the 
in˛ation target for a given country. I
n˛ation expectations are ˝rmly anchored in the short 

term if they are not systematically sensitive to 

movements in actual in˛ation, that is, when 
 ˚  = 
0 (see Bernanke 2007 for a similar concept). To 

assess how the anchoring of in˛ation expectations has evolved over time, ˝ve-year rolling regressions 

of the above equation are estimated.
Consensus Forecasts for in˛ation are used to 
measure in˛ation expectations. More speci˝cally, 

two-year-ahead forecasts are used in the baseline 

estimates, and robustness of the results is checked 

with ˝ve-year-ahead forecasts.
28 For the euro area 
and each member country, the in˛ation target is 

taken to be 1.9 percent, in line with the European 
Central Bank™s de˝nition of price stability. For 
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the 

Slovak Republic, the target is the rate announced 

by the central bank or the simple average of 

the announced rates at a given point in time, 

interpolating linearly wherever necessary.
28Market-based in˛ation expectations are appealing but they are 
potentially biased due to in˛ation risk, liquidity risk, and institu
-tional distortions (Lyziak and Paloviita 2017). Such biases are likely 

signi˝cant during times of ˝nancial stress and unconventional mon
-
etary policy. Market-based measures are not available for all newer 

member states, or markets tend to be shallow. For the aggregate 

euro area for which data are available, the results are robust to using 

market-based measures of in˛ation expectations (˝ve-year-forward 

in˛ation compensation ˝ve years ahead).

In the euro area, there are some signs of a 
deanchoring of in˛ation expectations in recent 

years. ˜e rolling regression estimates show an 

increase in the coe˙cient on actual in˛ation, 

indicating that in˛ation expectations have 

become somewhat more sensitive to movements 

in actual in˛ation (Figure
 2.24). To address 
potential endogeneity, the equation is estimated using lagged actual in˛ation; the headline results 

remain robust. ˜e results with the one-year-ahead 

in˛ation expectations (estimated at the country 

level) and ˝ve-year-ahead in˛ation expectations 

(estimated as an aggregate for the euro area) are 

similar. Overall, the results support the view 

that low in˛ation since the global ˝nancial crisis 

contributed to some deanchoring of in˛ation 
expectations in the euro area similar to Lyziak and 

Paloviita (2017). 
In newer members, in˛ation expectations seem 
to have become more anchored over time

Expectations have become less sensitive to 

movements in actual in˛ation than they were 

during the period preceding the global ˝nancial 
crisis. Although there has been some reversal of 

this trend in the past ˝ve years, the sensitivity 

remains quite low.

explanatory variables are taken consistent with 
the earlier analysis in this chapter. To assess how 

the impact of indexation, slack, and in˛ation 
expectations on wages has evolved over time, 

the above equation is estimated in a panel 

with 15-year rolling windows using quarterly 

data from the ˝rst quarter of 1996 to the third 

quarter of 2017, separately for the euro area 

(excluding Germany) and the newer EU member 

states, as before.
˜e slope of the wage Phillips curve is found 
to be broadly stable for both the euro area and 

the newer member states. For the euro area
, the 
estimated coe˙cient on the unemployment gap 

starts at about Œ0.4 and rises only modestly to 

Œ0.3, while for the newer members, the coe˙cient 

is stable at about Œ1 (Figure
 2.25). ˜ese results 
use hourly total labor compensation as in the 
baseline speci˝cation earlier in this chapter. 

Results using hourly wages and salaries paint a 

similar picture. ˜us, the wage Phillips curve has 
not ˛attened signi˝cantly since the early 2000s. 
˜is result is consistent with existing studies that 

˝nd that much of the ˛attening of the Phillips 
curve (for wages and prices) occurred in the 

1980s, while the slope parameter has remained 

broadly stable since then (Blanchard, Cerutti, and 

Summers 2015; Borio 2017).
29 In the euro area, wage setting has become notably 

more forward
-looking over time. ˜e coe˙cient 
on in˛ation expectations has increased fr
om about 0.3 in the late 1990s to about 0.8 (and statistically 
signi˝cant) in recent years (Figure
 2.26).30 At 
the same time, wage adjustment in response to 

actual in˛ation has declined modestly in recent 

years, from about one
-quarter to one
-˝fth. In 
newer member states, the coe˙cient on expected 

in˛ation has varied without a clear trend, and 
there is some decline in the impact of actual 

in˛ation in recent years. 
29Recent literature o˚ers little consensus on how the slope of 
the wage Phillips curve has evolved in recent times (Riggi and 
Venditti 2015; Constâncio 2017; Bonama, de Haana, and van 

Limbergen 2018).
30To the extent that in˛ation expectations in the euro area have 
become more sensitive to actual in˛ation in recent years, this would 

tend to increase the e˚ect of actual in˛ation on wages. ˜at said, 

the impact is likely minor given the modest estimated sensitivity of 

in˛ation expectations to actual in˛ation (Figure
 2.24).2011:Q111:Q211:Q3

˜e pass-through of wages to in˛ation is 
studied using a vector autoregression (VAR) 

model. Building on Peneva and Rudd (2017), 

a four-variable VAR is estimated comprising 

relative import price in˛ation (ratio of import 

prices over the GDP de˛ator), nominal wage 

growth adjusted for trend productivity growth, 

consumer price in˛ation, and an unemployment 

gap (based on OECD estimates of the NAIRU).
31 ˜e multivariate framework of the VAR allows 

for assessing the pass-through of wages (adjusted 

for productivity) to prices while controlling for 
31Adjusting wages for productivity produces unit labor costs, 
which are a key driver of in˛ation in many economic models; they 
also shape external competitiveness.
endogenous feedback e˚ects with prices and slack.32 ˜e VAR is estimated as a panel separately 
for the EU15 and the newer members using 

quarterly data from the ˝rst quarter of 1998 to the 

third quarter of 2017. A Cholesky decomposition 

is used for the identi˝cation of the shocks, with 
the variables ordered as described above. ˜e 

ordering re˛ects a relative exogeneity of the 

variables, whereby import prices are assumed most 

exogenous and the unemployment gap the most 

endogenous (Peneva and Rudd 2017). By ordering 

wage growth before in˛ation, it is assumed that 

movements in wages have an immediate impact 
32˜e responses of wage growth to shocks to in˛ation and 
the unemployment gapŠpositive in the former and negative in 
the latterŠare consistent with the panel regression estimates in 

this chapter.

on in˛ation, but wages take at least a quarter 
to respond to price movements.
33 Results are 
robust to alternative ordering of variables (for 

example, ordering in˛ation before wages results 

in similar medium-term dynamics of in˛ation to 
a wage shock, even when the immediate impact is 

constrained to zero).
˜e medium-term pass-through from wages to 
prices, while positive, is less than full in both 

the EU15 and the newer member states. ˜e 

immediate impact of a wage shock on price 
in˛ation is positive yet small, but the impact 

rises over time to peak around four to six 

quarters before dissipating after about three 

years (Figure
 2.27). In the EU15, a wage shock 
that increases wage gro

 percentage 
point on impact is followed b
y cumulative 
increases over three years of 0.6
 percent in prices, 
and 2.4 percent in wages, for a pass-through 
of 25 percent. For the new
er members, the cumulative increase is 0.9
 percent in prices, and 
3.6 percent in wages, for a similar pass-through of 
25 percent. ˜e literature also ˝nd a less-than-full 
and relativ
ely small pass-through from wages to 
in˛ation, especially after the 1980s (Mehra 2000; 

May 2017 
Regional Economic Issues: Central, 

Eastern, and Southeastern Europe
; Peneva and 

Rudd 2017). 
Conclusions and Policy ImplicationsWage formation in Europe remains principally 
driven by country
-speci˝c conditions, but global and regional factors play a signi˝cant role, 

especially in the new
er EU member states. Key 
points from the analytical work presented in this 

chapter are the following:
Ł ˜e wage Phillips curve appears alive and 
well, having broadly stable parameters, with 
a modest slope in EU15 countries, and 
especially strong wage responses to slack 
33˜is distinguishes only between orthogonalized shocks to wages 
and in˛ation in the VAR system. A deeper structural interpretation 
of the fundamental drivers of wage and in˛ation shocks is beyond 

the scope of the chapter.
in the newer EU member countries. ˜is 
contributed to the much faster deceleration of 
wages in the latter countries after the global 
˝nancial crisis, together with the more recent 

wage acceleration.Ł Real wages are anchored by labor pr
oductivity, 
but deviations from equilibrium can develop. 

Incorporating such deviations into the analysis 

facilitates understanding of wage moderation, 
especially in the wake of major shocks (global 
˝nancial crisis and the euro area crisis) to 

regions with nominal wage inertia, such 

as the EU15.Ł While unemployment remains the main 

indicator of slack, it is also useful to monitor 
involuntary par
t-time employment and hours 
worked per person. A nonemployment index 

can usefully summarize the ˝rst two variables 

plus marginally attached workers.
Ł Spillovers can operate via both wage and 

slack developments in other countries. 

Spillovers are especially strong in the newer 
EU members, which may re˛ect the positions 

of many of those countries in global supply 
chains and migration e˚ects on domestic 
labor supply. Migration e˚ects on wages 

appear to be statistically signi˝cant, but small 
and temporary.
Ł In˛ation expectations are a key driver of 

nominal wage developments, especially in 

the euro area. Some deanchoring of these 
expectations has appeared in recent years 

owing to prolonged low in˛ation.
Although the models can broadly account for 

wage trends, wages in the newer EU member 

countries are growing somewhat faster than 

the models would indicate. ˜e moderation of 
nominal wages in the EU15 is found to re˛ect 

principally low in˛ation expectations and slower 

productivity growth, together with the relatively 

modest and lagged impact of slack on wages. 
Accordingly, provided unemployment continues 

to fall and in˛ation gradually increases in line 

with projections in the April 2018 WEO, wage 

rises are also projected to pick up in the EU15,

but the process will take much longer than in 
the newer EU members. In contrast, even with 

contributions from declining domestic slack in 

the newer members, and spillovers from declining 

euro area unemployment, the recent acceleration 

in new member state wages is not fully accounted 

for. Migration of skilled workers from the newer 

members and hikes in minimum wages and 
public sector wages are potential contributors to 

these developments, which have lifted wages to 

relatively high levels compared with trends in labor 

productivity.
For the euro area, the central policy implication is 
to underpin a ˝rm reanchoring of expectations to 

the in˛ation target. ˜e analysis suggests that the negative impact of slack on wages was deepened 

and prolonged by downward adjustments in 

in˛ation expectations, which have become more 

sensitive to actual in˛ation developments as 

in˛ation remained below target in recent years. 

Accordingly, to ensure the e˚ectiveness of the 

in˛ation target in promoting macroeconomic 

stability, it remains essential for the European 

Central Bank to stay committed to its strategy 

to durably raise in˛ation to target. Regarding 

current account rebalancing within the euro area, 

the analysis suggests that although the wage and 
real exchange rate adjustments following the 

global ˝nancial crisis were sizable, they do not 

fully account for the major adjustments in current

accounts, which were principally the result of 
swings in domestic demand ˝nanced by capital 

in˛ows. Nonetheless, wage developments in the 

euro area are broadly consistent with promoting 

adjustment in current account imbalances, with 

room for further unit labor cost rises in Germany 

and perhaps also in the Netherlands.
Recent wage developments in newer EU member 
countries increase the urgency for implementation 

of reforms to reduce skill mismatches and support 

labor force participation. ˜e sharp acceleration of 

wages during 2016Œ17 lifted the average ratio of 

real wages to trend labor productivity to roughly 

2½ percent over its historical av
erage in 2017, a level only exceeded temporarily in mid-2008 

for two quarters. ˜ere is naturally a concern 

that the impact on pro˝tability will undermine 
investment and growth. Mobilizing labor supply 

through measures to reduce skill and locational 

mismatches could usefully help contain wage 
pressure and support employment and growth. 

Given unfavorable demographics and emigration, 

active labor market policies aimed at increasing 

participation rates and reducing structural 

unemployment are needed to boost labor supply. 

More retraining courses for the unemployed and 

apprenticeship systems would help systematically 

develop the necessary skills and alleviate skill 

mismatches. Also, structural reforms focusing 

on strengthening institutions and improving 

public sector e˙ciency would not only help 
convergence, but would also encourage potential 

emigrants to stay.

Wage developments in the euro area are broadly consistent with promoting adjustment in external imbalances, 
with a need for further unit labor cost rises in Germany and the Netherlands. Other countries should seek higher 

productivity growth, including improvement in competitiveness.
˜ere have been substantial reductions in external imbalances within the euro area since the global ˝nancial 
crisis. Countries with large external de˝cits in 2007Œ08 (Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain) 

have seen the largest increases in their current account balances. Italy™s balance also rose notably, though its 

initial de˝cit was modest (Figure
 2.1.1). In some countries with surpluses of 3 to 4
 percent of GDP balances 
declined (Austria and Finland). O
utliers from this 
perspective are Germany and the Netherlands, whose 

large intial surpluses continued to increase after the 

global ˝nancial crisis. Developments in unit labor costs are mostly 
supportive of this external adjustment. Unit labor 

costs in Greece, Portugal, and Spain have fallen 

10 percent or more relativ
e to the euro area average 
since the global crisis. ˜is adjustment re˛ects labor 

shedding at ˝rst and below-average wage rises more 

recently (Figure
 2.1.2). In some countries with 
declines in their external balances, relative unit labor 

costs increased (Austria and Finland). Beginning in 
2011, Germany™s wage growth appropriately drove 

an increase in its relative unit labor costs, although 

its external surplus continued to rise. However, the 

relative unit labor costs in the Netherlands declined in 

recent years despite its strong initial surplus. 
˜ese adjustments in relative unit labor costs within 
the euro area have also supported adjustments in 

multilateral indicators of competitiveness. Recent 

research ˝nds that the unit-labor-cost-basis real 

e˚ective exchange rate has a strong negative 

correlation with the external balance, whereas there 

is no such relationship for measures based on the 

consumer price index or the GDP de˛ator (Ahn, 
Mano, and Zhou 2017). ˜e very high unit-labor-cost-basis real e˚ective exchange rates in Portugal and Spain 

have unwound and are close to 30-year averages, although Portugal remains a little above that.
1 Real e˚ective 
exchange rates in France and Italy have declined more modestly, and in Austria and Belgium they are broadly 

stable. Despite the signi˝cant rise in Germany™s unit labor costs relative to the euro area, the multilateral 

unit-labor-cost-based real e˚ective exchange rate still appears low, as is true in the Netherlands, albeit to a 

lesser extent.But changes in competitiveness account for only a fraction of the very large current account adjustments. An 
analysis of the linkage between the exchange rates and the trade balance ˝nds that on average a 10
 percent 
depreciation is associated with a rise in real net expor
ts of 1.5 percent, or a 0.15 elasticity (see Chapter
 3 of the October 2015

with a median of 0.33 for the euro area countries identi˝ed. Applying this elasticity to either (1) the change 
in relative unit labor costs relative to the euro area average or (2) the change in the multilateral real e˚ective 

exchange rate on a unit labor cost basis, generates implied current account adjustments well short of those in 

the countries with large adjustments.˜is observation is consistent with the view that a sudden stop in capital in˛ows drove the sharp 
adjustment in external balances within the euro area (Baldwin and others 2017). From this perspective, the 

pre
-global-˝nancial-crisis external de˝cits to a large extent resulted from capital in˛ows driving aggr
egate demand via credit growth and/or ˝scal de˝cits. When these in˛ows endedŠas a result of the global and

employment. ˜e labor market slack arising during the adjustment process, to varying degrees in di˚erent 

countries, also supported a decline in wages relative to productivity and hence declines in unit labor costs. 

Although these relative declines were supportive of an external adjustment feasible with a smaller than 

otherwise reduction in domestic demand, their co-movement with the external balance does not make them 

the primary driver.   
Real exchange rate adjustment remains appropriate in countries with large current account de˝cits before the 
crisis. ˜e external balances of Greece and Portugal are now at or above their External Balance Assessment 

norms, with Spain in surplus yet below its norm (see IMF 2017b). Nonetheless, these three countries have 

large negative international investment positions, adding to the importance of aiming for higher productivity

Wages across Europe can have common underlying drivers. Domestic drivers of wagesŠsuch as 
unemployment and in˛ationŠcould have a signi˝cant common component either due to common shocks 
(for example, commodity price shocks) or through spillovers (given trade and ˝nance channels). Common 

factors could be even more important in European countries. For instance, European Union (EU) trade and 

labor market integration could make wages in EU countries more dependent on labor market conditions, 

including wages, in other countries due to the threat of production relocation or migration. ˜e common 

monetary policy in the euro area could increase wage co-movement in these countries as well. ˜us, it is 

important to understand the extent to which movements in domestic wages stem from forces beyond borders.
˜e objective of this box is to quantify the role of common factors in driving wage dynamics in the EU15 
and newer EU member states. It addresses the following questions: (1)
 How important ar
e common factors in driving wage dynamics in European countries? (2) To what extent are these common factors Europe-wide; that 

is, common to both EU15 and newer members, and, given their structural di˚erences, speci˝c to EU15 and 

newer member states? (3) How has the role of these common factors evolved over time?
˜is box uses a multifactor dynamic factor model 
to analyze the cyclical drivers of wage growth across 

European countries. ˜e model decomposes wage 

growth (year-over-year growth of quarterly wages, 

demeaned) at the country level into the following 

factors: (1) a Europe-wide factor that captures 

˛uctuations common across all European countries; 

(2) two group-speci˝c factors that capture ˛uctuations 

common across the EU15 and the newer EU 

members; and (3) idiosyncratic terms or country 

factors that are speci˝c to each country.
1 ˜e common factors capture wage co-movement due to either 

common shocks or spillovers, but cannot distinguish 

between the two. Given structural di˚erences across 

the EU15 and newer EU member countries that could 

produce di˚erent wage dynamics, the group-speci˝c 

factors are designed to capture commonalities speci˝c 

to each group. ˜e model is estimated using Bayesian 

techniques for 26 European countries (the EU15 
countries and 11 new
er EU members) for the ˝rst quarter of 2002 to the third quarter of 2017. To assess 

how common factors have evolved over time, the 

model is estimated using ˝ve-year rolling windows.
Common factors explain a signi˝cant portion of wage 
growth in European countries. More precisely, the 

Europe-wide and group-speci˝c factors combined 

explain more than a quarter of the variance of wage 

growth during 2002Œ17 (Figure
 2.2.1). ˜e role 
of the Europe-wide factor is larger for the ne
wer 
members, consistent with the fact that they are small 
1To the extent that Europe-wide factors evolve as part of a broader global phenomenon, the Europe-wide factor could represent 
global developments as well. For a detailed discussion of the model and estimation, see Kose, Otrok, and Whiteman (2003).

open economies. On the other hand, the group-speci˝c factor has a somewhat larger role for the EU15. 
˜is can be rationalized in terms of more synchronous business cycles in a monetary union that characterize 

the EU15. Even though common factors play an important role, country-speci˝c factors remain the most 

signi˝cant driver of wage dynamics, explaining about three-quarters of their variance. ˜e results are robust 

to using a simpler Principal Components Analysis to estimate the common factors. Also, while work on wage 

co-movement is scant, the above ˝ndings are broadly in line with the literature on in˛ation co-movements. 

For instance, the European Central Bank (2017) ˝nds that common factors explain about a quarter of the 

variation in core in˛ation based on a comparable sample used in this box.
2 ˜e rolling estimates suggest that wage co-movement increased during crisis periods (Figure
 2.2.2). ˜is is in line with Chapter 2 of the October 2017 
Wor
ld Economic Outlook
, which attributes increased wage 
co-movement to downward pressure on wage demands due to synchronized recessions and elevated concerns 

about job losses in the aftermath of the 2008Œ09 global ˝nancial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis. 

More generally, Chapter
 3 of the April 2013 
Wor
ld Economic Outlook
 ˝nds that activity and ˝nancial variables 
are more correlated during crisis periods. While wage co-movement in recent years was somewhat smaller than 

during these crisis episodes, it nonetheless remained sizable. 
2Several studies also ˝nd a signi˝cant role of common factors in driving in˛ation (Ciccarelli and Mojon 2010; Mumtaz, and Surico 
2012; Kamber and Wong 2018). Admittedly, our quantitative ˝ndings are more in line with the co-movement of core in˛ation than 

headline in˛ation. See ECB (2017) for a survey.

Overall, these results attest to an important role of common factors for wage dynamics in European countries. 
Common wage drivers, such as slack and in˛ationŠgiven strong economic integration among European 

countries, and direct spillovers from wage setting in one country to others as a result of product, labor, and 

˝nancial marketsŠlikely explain a signi˝cant portion of European wage dynamics in recent years.

Freedom of movement for workers is a fundamental principle enshrined in Article 45 of the Treaty on the 
Functioning of the European Union (EU). Labor mobility also occurs via the free cross
-border provision of 
services as illustrated in Figure 2.3.1: 
Under the Treaty:
Ł EU citizens are entitled to (1) look for a job in another EU country; (2) work ther
e without needing a work permit; (3) reside there for that purpose; (4) stay there even after employment has ˝nished; and (5) 
enjoy equal treatment with nationals in access to employment, working conditions, and all other social 

and tax advantages.
Ł EU nationals may also have certain types of health and social security coverage transferr
ed to the country 
in which they go to seek work.
Ł People working in some occupations may also be able to have their professional quali˝cations 

recognized abroad.
Ł Free movement of wor
kers also applies, in general terms, to the countries in the European Economic 
Area, which covers Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.
EU social security coordination provides rules to protect the rights of people moving within the European 

Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.
