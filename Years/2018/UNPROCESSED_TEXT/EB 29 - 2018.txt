 Summary
 The information 
that has become 
available since 
the Governing Council™s 
monetary 
policy meeting 
on 14 June 
indicates that the euro area economy is proceeding along 
a solid and broad
-based growth path
.1 Uncertainties related to global factors
, notably 
the threat of 
protectionism,
 remain prominent
, 
and the risk of persistent heightened 
financial market volatility continues to warrant monitoring
. However, the 
risks 
surrou
nding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced
. The underlying s
trength of the economy has confirmed the Governing Council™s
 confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to 
its
 aim will continue in the 
period ahead a
nd will be maintained even after a gradual winding
-down of 
the
 net 
asset purchases. Nevertheless, significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to 
support the further build
-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation 
developments over the 
medium term. This support will continue to be provided by 
the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired 
assets and the associated reinvestments, and by 
the Governing Council™s
 enhanced 
forward guidance on the key ECB 
interest rates. In any event, the Governing Council 
stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation 
continues to move towards 
its
 aim in a sustained manner.
 The growth momentum of the global economy 
continued to be
 ste
ady in the second 
quarter of 2018, but downside risks
 related to
 trade tariff
s have remained prominent.
 In addition, global trade indicators recorded a loss in momentum. Financial 
conditions have tightened somewhat for emerging market economies
, but
 overal
l remain supportive
 in advanced economies
. In the euro area, 
sovereign bond yields have declined 
since 
the 14
 June meeting
, on 
the back of receding 
volatility
 in sovereign debt markets and declining risk
-free rates. 
Equity prices experienced a correction 
amid increasing trade tensions. In foreign 
exchange markets, the euro broadly appreciated in trade
-weighted terms.
 The latest 
economic indicators have stabilised and continue to point to ongoing solid 
and broad
-based growth, albeit at a slower pace than in
 2017. This easing reflects a 
pull
-back from the very high levels of growth last year and is related mainly to 
weaker impetus from previously very strong external trade, compounded by an 
increase in uncertainty and some temporary and supply
-side factors at
 both the 
domestic and the global level. 
Private consumption continues to be supported by 
ongoing employment gains
, which, in turn, partly 
reflect
 past labour market reforms
, and by growing household wealth. Business investment is fostered by the
 favourabl
e financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. Housing 
                                                                    1  Taking into account information available at the time of the Governing Council meeting of 
26
 July
 2018.

 Œ Update on economic and mon
etary developments
 Summary
 3 investment remains robust. In addition, the broad
-based expansion in global demand 
is expected to continue, thus 
providing
 impetus to euro area exports.
 Euro area annual HICP 
inflation increased to 2.0% in June, from 1.9% in May, 
reflecting mainly higher energy and food price inflation. On the basis of current 
futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the 
current level for the remaind
er of the year. While measures of underlying inflation 
remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic cost 
pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation 
and tightening labour markets. 
Unc
ertainty around the inflation outlook is receding. 
Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the 
year and thereafter to increase gradually over the medium term, supported by the 
ECB™s monetary policy measures, the contin
uing economic expansion, the 
corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth.
 The monetary analysis indicates that b
road money growth increased 
again 
in 
June
 2018, having gradually decelerated since it last peaked in September
 2017. 
The r
ecovery in
 the growth of loans
 to the private sector is proceeding, driven mainly 
by loans to non
-financial corporations (NFCs). The euro area bank lending survey 
for 
the second quarter of 2018 
suggests that loan growth continued to be supported by 
easing 
credit standards and increasing demand across all loan categories. Net 
issuance of debt securities by euro area NFCs is estimated to have increased 
further, while financing costs for NFCs 
have 
remained favourable.
 On the basis 
of the
 outcome of the
 economi
c analysis and the signals coming from 
the monetary analysis, the Governing Council 
confirmed that an ample degree of 
monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence 
of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% 
over the medium term.
 Accordingly, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates 
unchanged and continues to expect them to remain at their present levels at least 
through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to en
sure the 
continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 
2% over the medium term. Regarding non
-standard monetary policy measures, the 
Governing Council confirmed that the Eurosystem will continue to make net 
purchases 
under the asset purchase programme
 (APP)
 at the current monthly pace 
of •30
 billion until the end of September
 2018. The Governing Council anticipates 
that, after September, subject to incoming data confirming its medium
-term inflation 
outlook, it will red
uce the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to •15
 billion until 
the end of December
 2018 and then end net purchases. 
Furthermore, t
he Governing 
Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities 
purchased under the APP for an 
extended period of time after the end of the net 
asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable 
liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.

 Global survey indicators continue t
o signal a steady growth momentum for the 
second quarter of 2018.
 The global composite output Purchasing Managers™ Index 
(PMI) excluding the euro area increased slightly further in June (see Chart
 1), 
reaching a four
-month high, as the continued pick
-up in
 the service
s sector more 
than compensated for the moderate decline in manufacturing. In quarterly terms, the 
PMI in the second quarter of 2018 was slightly above the average in the previous 
quarter. The 
composite output 
PMI in June decreased moderately in
 the 
United 
States
 from May, while it strengthened in Japan and in the 
United Kingdom
. In 
emerging market economies, the composite output PMI increased in June in China 
and bounced back
 considerably in India, while the rate of expansion slowed in 
Russia 
and Brazil.

 Note
s: The latest observations are for 
June
 2018. ﬁLong
-term averageﬂ 
refers to the period from January
 1999 to 
June
 2018. At the sam
e time downside risks to the global economy have intensified, amid 
actions and threats regarding trade tariff increases by the United States and 
possible retaliation by the affected countries.
 The first wave of US tariffs on 
Chinese imports took effect on 
6 July
 and further US tariffs
 are
 planned
. The 
Chinese authorities revealed their
 intention to introduce retaliatory measures. 
Simultaneously, retaliatory measures by the 
European Union
 and Canada against 
the tariffs previously imposed on steel and alumini
um came into force. The US 
administration also initiated a new investigation 
into
 imports of cars and spare parts 
for cars
, which, 
should it result in
 protectionist measures, could particularly affect 
Canada, Japan, Mexico
 and South Korea as well as key ec
onomies in the European 
Union. Complex supply chains could further amplify the adverse effects 
of protectionism 
on the world economy. Overall, if all the threatened measures were 
to 
be implemented, the average US tariff rate would rise to levels not seen i
n the last 
50 years. These developments constitute a serious risk 
to
 the outlook for global 
trade and activity in the short to medium
 term.

 External environment
 5 Global financial conditions remain supportive
 overall, but have tightened 
somewhat for 
emerging market economies
. Overall, monetary policy in advanced 
economies remains accommodative. In the 
United States
, the Federal Open Market 
Committee increased policy rates in line with expectations in June. 
Against the 
backdrop of increasing inflation and tighter labour market 
conditions,
 officials
 at the 
Federal Reserve System
 also revised up the path of the federal funds rate to four 
total hikes in 2018, from 
the 
three previously expected. Renewed global trade 
tensions and 
the appreciation in the US dollar
 resulted in somewhat
 tighter financing 
conditions for 
emerging market economies
. In China, stock prices also declined and 
the renminbi faced some depreciation pressures. 
On the whole
, volatility in global 
equity markets increased and stock prices of automotive and technologic
al sectors 
came
 under downward pressures. Central bank interest rates have been maintained 
in the 
United Kingdom
, and the Bank of Japan 
is holding
 ten
-year yields close to 
zero in line with its yield curve control programme. Among emerging market 
economies
, Russia and Brazil 
have
 kept rates unchanged in recent months, while 
Turkey and Argentina hiked rates substantially in May and June amid significant 
financial market tensions. China has continued to tighten domestic financial 
conditions to tackle
 risks in
 the financial system.
 Global trade indicators recorded a loss in momentum.
 Monthly trade data 
decelerated significantly and broadly across countries. Global merchandise imports 
contracted in April 
and May
 2018, reversing the strong growth recorded in the 
first 
quarter, and the global PMI for new export orders fell 
in the five months to June
 (see 
Chart
 2). Other trade indicators have also weakened, including measures related to 
global value chains. Overall, these indicators point to a deceleration in trade 
in the 
second quarter of 2018.

 6 Global inflation edged up in May.
 Annual consumer price inflation in the countries 
of the Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD) increased 
to 2.6% in May. The 
rise
 was driven by energy prices, while food prices slowed
 slightly. Excluding food and energy prices, OECD
 annual inflation increased 
marginally to 2%. Inflation is expected to continue rising in the near term following 
the pick
-up in oil prices. Looking further ahead, the gradual decline in spare capacity 
is also expected to support underlying inflation.
 Oil 
prices have remained broadly stable amid some volatility.
 Brent crude oil 
prices increased gradually from around USD
 75 per barrel 
in mid
-June 
to USD
 78 per barrel on 10
 July, before falling to 
USD
 73 per barrel on 20
 July. The effect on oil 
prices from th
e announcement by 
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC)
 on 22
 June
 of its intention
 to increase supply has been 
relatively
 muted to date. While markets had anticipated an output rise of 
one million barrels 
per day, capacity constrain
ts in many OPEC countries suggest a smaller rise in oil 
supply in the near term. In addition, 
in July, 
oil prices 
were
 buoyed by strong global 
oil demand, ongoing geopolitical tensions in
volving
 Iran
, and political turmoil in 
Venezuela
 and in Libya. More r
ecently oil prices have decreased slightly. Non
-oil 
commodity prices have decreased by around 8% since mid
-June, with food prices 
falling by 8% and metal prices dropping by 9%. Food prices fell 
owing
 to ample 
supplies on the back of favourable weather cond
itions in North America and 
concerns about rising protectionist threats also affecting food commodities, 
particularly soybeans. 
The fall in metal prices
 can be partly explained by lower 
demand in China and concerns about a possible trade war.
 The outlook f
or economic activity in the United States remains solid, but 
concerns about tariffs have 
arisen
 among firms.
 Real GDP expanded at an 
annualised rate of 2% in the first quarter of 2018. Despite the slight deceleration in 
activity, the near
-term US outlook r
emains strong, supported by solid fundamentals 
as well as the large and procyclical fiscal expansion. In particular, consumer 
confidence is at cyclical highs, and tax cuts should further support domestic demand, 
even if the recent increase in 
petrol
 prices
 might mitigate somewhat the positive 
effects of the fiscal expansion. At the same time, anecdotal evidence from regional 
manufacturing surveys suggest that US businesses are concerned about the impact 
of a possible further escalation of trade tensions, wh
ich may affect their investment 
spending. The labour market continued to generate jobs at a solid pace and 
indicators continue to point to tightness, while wage growth remains moderate. 
Annual headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation reached its highe
st level since 
2012, rising to 2.9% in June, while 
increasing 
to 2.3%
 when food and energy are 
excluded
. In Japan, the economy is expected to recover from a mild contraction in the 
first quarter
 of 2018
, but the outlook is surrounded by growing 
uncertainty.
 Economic indicators suggest that positive growth in activity resumed in the second 
quarter, recovering from the first contraction of GDP in two years. However, the 
outlook is surrounded by growing uncertainty. The intense rainfall in western J
apan in early July is expected to weigh on economic activity, as several large 
manufacturers had to shut down their plants amid 
the 
severely damaged

 External environment
 7 infrastructure in the region. In addition, a further escalation of trade tensions could 
significantly hit t
he Japanese economy, especially if tariffs are increased on 
imports 
of 
cars and 
their spare 
parts, which account for around a third of Japan™s exports to 
the 
United States
. A further tightening of the labour market seems to 
be inducing
 a transition to more
 secure jobs, amid gradually accelerating base wages and still 
subdued inflation. Annual headline CPI inflation remained stable at 0.7% in June, yet 
underlying inflation remained low, with CPI excluding food and energy at 0%.
 In the United Kingdom, the wea
kening in GDP growth 
over the first quarter of 
2018 is considered to be temporary.
 The third GDP growth release for the first 
quarter posted a 0.1
 percentage point
 upward revision to 0.2%, mainly due to the 
upward revision of the net trade component, which
 also led to a further narrowing of 
the 
United Kingdom™s
 trade deficit. The latest PMI 
and monthly GDP numbers 
suggest a rebound in UK GDP in the second quarter, but short
-term indicators for the 
export
-oriented manufacturing sector signal a less optimisti
c outlook. This is in line 
with an environment of heightened uncertainty, particularly regarding the outcome of 
the negotiations on the country™s withdrawal
 from membership of the European 
Union
 in March 2019. Inflation stabilised at 2.4% in May, 
unchanged
 from 
April, as 
movements in the exchange rate have helped offset recent increases in oil prices.
 In China, GDP growth moderated slightly in 
the second quarter of 
2018 while 
financial markets recorded downward pressures.
 Real GDP grew at 6.7% in 
year
-on-year terms in the second quarter of 2018, in line with market expectations of 
a slowdown in economic activity. The ongoing structural deleveraging campaign has 
so far been focused on the banking sector, but it is starting to filter through to the 
broader eco
nomy and is affecting investment patterns. Infrastructure investment in 
particular fell as financing channels tightened, although investment in manufacturing 
and real estate rebounded (see
 the box entitled ﬁImbalances in China: is growth in 
peril from a ho
using market downturn?ﬂ in this issue of the Economic Bulletin
). 
Chinese equities and foreign exchange markets have been under pressure recently, 
reflecting both fears of an escalation 
of trade tensions and a slowdown
 in growth
. 
Price pressures picked up i
n June, with annual headline CPI inflation rising to 1.9%.

 Although incoming data 
point to a loss in momentum
 following the very strong 
growth seen in 
2017, the solid and broad
-based growth pattern in the euro area 
is expected to continue.
 Real GDP increased by 0.
4%, quarter on quarter, in the 
first 
quarter of 201
8, following growth of 0.7% in the five previous quarters 
(see 
Chart
 5). D
omestic demand
 and changes in inventories made positive contributions 
to the outcome in the first quarter, whereas net trade had a small dampening effect 
on GDP growth. 
Although 
economic indicators 
during the first half of this year have 
softened, they
 Œ and particularl
y the survey results
 Œ still remain at very high levels. 
Overall, this suggests ongoing robust growth in the second and third quarters of the 
year. The recent strengthening of growth has coincided with a broad
-based reduction 
in growth dispersion across eu
ro area countries (see Box
 3).

 Annual

. Private consumption rose by 
0.5%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2018, following a slower rate of

This 
outcome seems to reflect strong

 12 moving average) 
remained 
broadly 
unchanged at
 12.0% in 
the first quarter,
 only 
slightly above
 the record low of 11.9% in 
the third quarter of 
2017. Gains in employment are expected to continue to support robust growth in 
private consumption.
 While recent 
data on retail trade and new passenger car 
registrations 
point to continued, albeit relatively
 slower, growth in consumer spending 
in the second quarter of this year, other indicators support the picture of continued 
robust consumption dynamics. The l
atest survey 
results signal
 ongoing 
labour 
market improvements, which
 should 
continue to 
support 
aggregate income and thus 
consumer spending.
 A lower unemployment rate increases
 not only the 
income 
of those 
who
 find a new job
, but
 also 
the 
expected future income of those who are 
already employed and face lower unemployment risk. 
Moreover
, households™ ne
t 
worth continued to increase at robust 
rates in the first quarter of 2018
, thus lending 
further 
support 
to 
private consumption.
 Together, these factors explain why 
consumer confidence 
continues to stand at elevated levels 
close to 
the
 all
-time high 
reache
d in May
 2000. For a more comprehensive overview of recent consumption 
developments, see Article 3 in this issue of the Economic Bulletin.
 While
 investment growth eased in the first quarter of 2018
, short
-term 
indicators continue to point to robust growth
. The quarterly rise in investment in 
the first quarter of this year, of 0.3%, was brought about by an increase in 
construction investment of 1.3%, whereas non
-construction investment declined by 
0.5%. The decline in non
-construction investment chiefly refl
ected the fall in 
investments in m
achinery
 and transport 
equipment
. As regards the second quarter of 
2018, short
-term indicators point to continued, albeit slightly weakened, growth. For 
instance, monthly data on capital goods production stood on average i
n April and 
May 1.0% above the average level in the first quarter of 2018, when they declined by 
2.1% on a quarterly basis. In addition, 
conditions in the capital goods sector
, such as 
stabilising 
capacity utilisation
 and stable 
orders, 
as well as falling,
 but still strong, 
confidence and 
demand, 
signal 
continued growth in non
-construction investment 
overall. 
With regard to construction investment, monthly construction production data 
until May 
point to
 continued
 Œ but moderating
 Œ growth in the 
second 
quarter of 
2018. 
Survey data for the construction sector broadly support this picture.
 Investment is expected to continue to grow 
at a robust pace
. Investment 
continue
s to be supported by favourable earnings expectations, 
strong
 domestic and 
foreign demand
, and accommodative financing conditions. According to the euro 
area sectoral accounts for the f
irst
 quarter of 201
8, business margins (measured as 
the ratio of net operating surplus to value added) 
remain close to the highest level 
since early 2009. Furth
ermore, earnings expectations for listed companies in the 
euro area
, despite moderating somewhat,
 continue to 
support investment
. At the 
same time
, uncertainties surrounding the implementation of tariff increases may 
already be detrimental 
to
 investment de
cisions.
 As regards construction investment,
 the
 latest indicators point to a decelerating but still positive momentum in 
construction and housing investment. Households™ rising disposable income and very 
favourable lending conditions 
are expected to 
conti
nue to underpin demand in the 
construction sector

 13 Euro area trade growth 
remained
 moderate at the beginning of the second 
quarter of 2018.
 Euro area 
nominal
 goods 
exports 
in April and May confirm the 
weak growth pace observed in the first quarter
, 
decreas
ing by 0.6%, month on 
month, in May.
 Extra euro area goods exports decreased across almost all 
destinations; this was observed most notably in exports to the United Kingdom
. 
Euro 
area nominal imports were up by 1.5%, month on month, in April and were stabl
e in 
May. 
Survey indicators for global and euro area new manufacturing orders 
remained 
broadly stable in June and point to 
a continuing moderation of euro area exports
 for 
the coming quarter
, while hard data such as new manufacturing orders outside the 
euro area showed signs of improvement in April and May.
 Overall, the latest economic indicators suggest ongoing solid growth.
 Industrial 
production (excluding construction) 
displayed a relatively strong increase in May. 
Despite this, production stood on avera
ge in April and May 0.2% below the level 
seen 
in the 
first 
quarter
 of 2018
, when 
it declined 
by 
0.6
% on a quarterly basis. More 
timely survey data 
signal ongoing robust growth, albeit at slower rates than in 2017. 
The composite output Purchasing Managers™ 
Index 
(PMI) 
averaged 5
4.7
 in the 
second 
quarter of 201
8, compared with
 57.0
 in the 
first 
quarter
, before declining 
slightly in July
 2018 to 54.3. Meanwhile, 
the European Commission™s Economic 
Sentiment Indicator
 (ESI)
 eased 
to 1
12.5 in the second quarter 
from 1
14.0
 in the 
first 
quarter
 (see Chart
 5). 
Both the ESI and the PMI 
continue to stand well 
above their 
respective long
-term averages
. This easing reflects a pull
-back from the high pace of growth observed last 
year and is related mainly to 
a weakening 
of external trade, compounded by an 
increase in uncertainty and some temporary and supply
-side factors at both 
the domestic and the global level.
 Overall, however, growth is expected to remain 
solid and broad
-based. The ECB™s monetary policy measures, whic
h have facilitated 
the deleveraging process, should continue to underpin domestic demand. Private 
consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains 
(which, in turn, partly reflect 
past labour market reforms
) and by growing household wealth. Business inv
estment 
continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, rising 
corporate profitability and solid demand. Housing investment continues to improve. 
In addition, the broad
-based global expansion
, which is expected to continue,
 is providing impetus to euro area exports.
 The results of the latest round of the 
ECB 
Survey of Professional Forecasters
, conducted in early 
July
, show that private sector
 GDP growth forecasts were revised 
downwards for 2018 and 2019
 compared
 with 
the previous round 
conducted in
 early 
April
. The figure for 2020 remained 
unchanged.
 The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as 
broadly balanced.
 Uncertainties related to global factors, notably the threat of 
protectionism, remain promine
nt. Moreover, the risk of persistent heightened 
financial market volatility continues to warrant mo
nitoring.

remained generally 
muted
 but stand 
above earlier lows.
 HICP inflation excluding energy 
and food
 decreased to 0.9% in 
June from 1.1% in May. This was partly due to 
the 
lagged effects of the timing of 
Easter, which have contributed 
significantly 
to the volatile behaviour of 
th
is measure 
of inflation since March. Measures of underlying inflation that are more robust to 
Easter effects have remained broadly stable over recent months. For example, HICP 
inflation excluding energy
, food
 and the volatile travel

items 
and cloth
ing was 
unchanged at 1.0% between March and May and down only 
slightly to 0.9% in June.
 Price pressures for HICP non
-energy industrial goods remained robust, with 
signs of more upward pressure visible in the early stages of the pricing chain.
 Producer pric
e inflation for non
-food consumer goods remained stable at 0.5% in 
May, unchanged since February
 2018. Such resilience to downward pressure from 
the strong euro appreciation in 2017 may reflect the offsetting impact of 
strengthening domestic cost pressures
, as well as stronger pricing power. There are 
also tentative signs of more upward pressures in the early stages of the pricing 
chain; for instance, growth in import prices for intermediate goods was 0.9% in May, 
up from 
-0.8% in April. Moreover, growth in
 the global Producer Price Index 
excluding energy has risen from its historical average in recent months. At the 
consumer level, HICP non

wage growth follow the direction of improving labour market conditions, as other 
factors that 
have 
weighed on wage growth

 The results of 
the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the third quarter of 2018 show

 remain
ed the 
largest contributor to annual

, the contribution has declined

 2018, 
in 
the Eurosyst
em™s 
net purchases 
under its

. The declining contribution to M3 growth from the 
Eurosystem™s asset purchases was offset by a moderate increase in the contribution

pooling) 
rose
 to 3.
5% in 
June,
 from 3.
3% in

%, from 
3.7% in 
May. Mean
while
, the annual growth rate 
of loans to 
households 
was stable at
 2.9%, where it has stood since December
 2017. 
More 
specifically, the annual growth ra
te of loans to households for house purchase has 
remained moderate from a historical perspective. While growth in loans to 
households for house purchase, which is typically reported in net terms, has been 
dampened by loan repayments resulting from the boom
 period in mortgage markets 
before the 
financial 
crisis
, the origination of new loans is stronger (see the box 
entitled ﬁ
Developments in mortgage loan
 origination in the euro area
ﬂ in this issue of

). The recovery in loan growth has been supported by the 
significant 
decline
 in bank 
lending rates across the euro area since mid
-2014 (
notably 
owing
 to the ECB™s 
non-standard monetary 
policy measures) and overall improvements in the supply of, 
and demand for, bank loans. In addition, banks have made progress in consolidating 
their balance sheet

 and consumer confidence
 were 
important 
drivers of
 loan demand.
 According to the results of a new question on the impact of 
NPL ratios on banks™
 lending policies, euro area banks reported that they 
had contributed to a tightening 
of their credit standards and terms and conditions across 
all categories of loans over the past six months. The 
tightening 
impact has, however, 
generally diminished 
in comparison with
 the impact between 2014 and 2017
 Œ in line 
with developments in actual NPL
s Œ and is expected to decrease further in the next 
six months. 
Over the past six months, b
anks™ 
NPL
 ratios affected lending policies 
mainly through their impact on risk perceptions, risk tolerance and the cost of the 
balance sheet clean
-up. Bank lending r
ates for NFCs 
recorded
 a new historical low.
 In 
May
 2018 the composite bank lending rate for 
loans to 
NFCs 
fell further to stand at a new
 historical 
low 
of 
1.62%. 
In the same month, t
he composite

lending rate for housing loans 
remained 
stable
 at 1.8
3%, 
slightly above its 
historical low of 1.78% 
recorded

lending rates for 
loans to 
NFCs and 
households have decreased
 significantly and by 
more than market reference rates 
since the ECB™s credit easing measures
 were announced 
in June
 2014. The

 1 Imbalances in China: is growth in peril from a housing 
market downturn?
 Prepared by 
Thomas
 Nielsen
 The Chinese economy has recently been pl
aying a key role in the global 
economic recovery.
 Recording growth rates of more than 6.5% over the past five 
years, China 
has 
contributed on average one
-third of total global growth. It has also 
become one of the euro
 area
™s largest
 trading partners, acco
unting for almost 7% of 
total extra
-euro area exports. While the world economy has benefited from China™s 
economic strength and growing importance, a downturn would also have large 
repercussions for global activity. In fact, imbalances in China have been i
dentified as 
a key external downside risk to the euro area and world economy.
8 One catalyst for 
such a risk materialising could be the housing market
. An abrupt downturn in the Chinese housing market after a long period of 
expansion could have a significan
t adverse effect on the economy, as the real 
estate and construction sector accounts for approximately 15% of China™s 
GDP.
 The real estate sector was a key driver of China™s robust economic growth in 
2017. Against this background, this box outlines the rec
ent developments in China™s 
housing market and presents an estimate of 
the
 impact 
that 
a housing market shock 
could have 
on the Chinese economy.
 After a period of expansion lasting an unprecedented two years, China™s 
housing market has cooled down.
 Overall
 house prices in China rose by 10% 
annually between late 2016 and late 2017, with some prime markets reaching annual 
growth rates of over 30%. This expansion cycle has contributed to 
strong 
domestic 
demand and the robust pick
-up in producer and commodity p
rices. 
Average 
house 
price growth slowed down to about 5% year
 on year
 up until June 2018
, while 
housing sales, which 
had also expanded rapidly since mid
-2015, have also 
decelerated from their earlier peaks. However, compared 
with
 previous episodes of 
strong house price corrections, housing inventory levels are 
currently
 lower, thereby 
suggesting a less pressing need to absorb excess supply through price concessions. 
Accordingly, the slowdown in prices and sales thus far has been s
omewhat less 
pronounced than in previous downturns (see Chart A), possibly also reflecting 
a more nuanced 
approach to 
domestic policy
.                                                                     8  See ﬁ

. Notes: Inventories are calculated by subtracting house sales from housing starts. Tier 1 cities are China™s largest cities, n
amely 
Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen. The latest observations are for
 June 2018.
 While overall house prices in China have risen broadly in line with income 
growth, housing markets in the largest Chinese cities have decoupled and 
show signs of disproportionately high valuations.
 In China™s so
-called tier
 1 cities 
Œ Beijing, 
Guangzhou, 
Shanghai
 and Shenzhen 
Œ house price growth has well 
exceeded income growth over the past ten years. As a result, the rise in house 
prices relative to income in these cities appear
s comparable to 
that
 observed in 
Japan in the early 1990s and in t
he United States
 and the 
European Union
 prior to 
the global financial crisis, which ultimately proved to be unsustainable (see 
Chart B). 
On the one hand, while real estate purchases in tier
 1 cities are often seen as a 
low
-risk financial investment, the di
vergence of house price and income growth could 
indicate that prices have indeed decoupled from fundamentals. On the other hand, 
house prices in the tier
 1 cities 
Œ which are the political, financial and manufacturing 
centres of China 
Œ may be skewed upwar
ds by housing demand from (high
-income) 
individuals from across China, not just local inhabitants.

 3 cities are smaller, provincial cities in China.
 Some segments of the property sector could a
ct as triggers for tightening 
financial conditions.
 The sharp 
increases in house prices of
 recent years were 
associated with significant property
-related borrowing, including from abroad. In the 
near term, property developers are facing sizeable refinancin
g needs. Chinese 
household debt has risen to 48% of GDP, comparable 
with
 high
-income countries, 
rendering them vulnerable to rising interest rates. As the Chinese authorities aim at 
deleveraging the economy, highly leveraged borrowers could face balance sh
eet 
pressures as financial conditions tighten. Moreover, local government budgets could 
be stretched by a pronounced slowdown in the housing sector
, as land sales have 
been an important source of local government financing.
 A severe housing market downturn
 could significantly affect the
 Chinese 
economy with possible global spillovers.
 A model simulation
9 assuming a fall in 
house prices of 6% and a decline in housing sales of 32% 
for four quarters
 (values 
similar to the 2008
-09 downturn in housing activity)
 suggests that China™s GDP 
would decrease by close to 2%
 cumulatively 
over five quarters 
compared 
with
 the 
baseline (see 
Chart
 C). If financial conditions are allowed to loosen, the cumulative 
                                                                    9  A Bayesian vector autoregressive

Analysis and Regression (

. Four shocks are identified: an aggregate demand shock, a 
monetary policy demand shock, a housing demand
 shock
 and 
a housing supply shock. The variables 
included in
 the model are GDP growth (expressed as a deviation from potential growth), the ratio of 
housing activity over overall activity (to differentiate between a housing demand shock and an 
aggregate demand shock), house price growth and growth of floor space so
ld. A financial conditions 
index is used to measure changes in financial conditions. Measures of global activity and commodity 
prices are included as exogenous variables to account for the potential influence of external 
developments. All variables are mea
sured in quarter

for instance be the result of a housing policy kept too tight for too long, adversely affecting both housing 
demand and supply.

 (percent

)  Source: ECB calculations.
 While the economic impact of a nationwide housing market correction would 
be sizeable, for the time being sharp house price corrections are more likely to 
be localised.
 The risk of a housing market correction may be most pronounced in 
the tier 1 cities, but they represent less than 10% of 
China™s
 total housing market. 
Furthermore, robust income growth and 
ongoing
 urbanisation continue to support 
fundamental housing deman
d across China. Policymaking has also changed, taking 
local circumstances better into account when intervening in the housing market. 
However, some key risks prevail.
 A sharp correction in tier 1 cities 
could
 lead to 
tighter financing conditions more gener
ally. Moreover, the current deleveraging 
campaign could put a number of highly
 leveraged firms under financial pressure, 
which could dampen construction activity. 
More i
mportantly, a reassessment of 
China™s future growth potential could have a negative eff
ect on housing demand. 
This would further hamper local government revenues and debt 
servicing
 capacity.

 Cyclical developments in the euro area current account
 25 2 Cyclical developments in the euro area current account
 Prepared by Michael Fidora
 The euro area current account balance stood at the historically high
 level of 
3.6% of GDP in the year up to the first quarter of 2018, slightly above the level 
of 3.5% of GDP recorded one year earlier (see Chart A).
 The slight increase in the 
current account surplus however masks significant decreases in the surplus on tra
de in goods (by 0.2 percentage point of GDP) as well as in the surplus on primary 
income (by 0.3 percentage point of GDP)
, which were slightly more than offset by an 
increase in the surplus on trade in services (by 0.5 percentage point of GDP).

 Note: The 
latest
 observation is for the 
first
 quarter of 201
8. There are, however, signs of a stabilisation of the current account balance, 
albeit at elevated levels, largely on account of developments in the oil price 
cycle (see Chart B).
 The current account surplus had reached a record high 
Œ slightly above its current level 
Œ in the third quarter of 2016. This peak coincided with 
an all
-time low in the energy trade deficit at the end of 2016 due to the trough in oil 
prices a few months earlier. Since then, the energy trade balance has worsened by 
0.3 percentage point of GDP. T
his, together with a slight decrease in the surpluses 
on non
-energy trade in goods as well as on primary income, more than offset the 
increase in the surplus 
on trade in services over the same period. Looking at energy 
trade developments over a longer peri
od, the stabilisation in oil prices after 2012 and 
their subsequent fall from 2014 to the end of 2
015 had
 in fact 
reduced 
the 
energy
 trade 
deficit
 by about 2 percentage points of GDP and thus entirely accounted for the 
rise
 in the current account surplus
 over the same period
. The current account 
balance of the euro area excluding energy trade, in turn, has remained remarkably 
stable since 2013.

 Since the start of the economic recovery in 2013, private sector investment has been 
steadily recuperating, albeit at a slow pace, while gross saving of t
he private sector 
only levelled off in 2016 and started to decline in 2017. As a result, net lending of the 
private sector declined in both 2016 and 2017. This development was however 
largely offset by a further reduction in net borrowing of the public sec
tor due to the 
ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts in a number of countries.

 Cyclical developments in the euro area current account
 27 From the perspective of euro area 
imbalances, the stabilisation of the euro 
area current account surplus reflects to some extent current account 
adjustment in euro area countries (see Chart D).
 In fact, the contribution of 
Germany to the current account surplus of the euro area has shrunk 
by about 0.3 
percentage point of euro area GDP since the beginning of 2016. This development 
has contrasted with a further rise in the current account surplus of the Net
herlands, 
by about 0.2 percentage point of euro area GDP 
over the same period
, which wa
s however broadly offset by a narrowing of current account surpluses of other euro 
area economies. At the same time, programme and post
-programme surveillance 
countries, on aggregate, continued to record further improvements in their current 
account balanc
es of around 0.2 percentage point of GDP.

8. PPS stan
ds for post
-programme surveillance.
 At present, the position of the euro area in the business cycle
, together with 
the recent increase in oil prices
, should further support the stabilisation of the 
current account balance.
 A weaker cyclical position of the
 euro area compared 
with
 its main trading partners continues t
o weigh on euro area import demand, while 
supporting foreign demand for euro area exports. This leads to a temporary increase 
in the euro area
™s trade surplus and thereby its current account bal
ance. In fact, a 
fraction of the current account surplus of about 0.1 percentage point of GDP is 
estimated to be due to the position of the euro area in the business cycle relative to 
that of its main trading partners
, based on standard elasticities availa
ble in the 
empirical literature
. This implies that the current account surplus of the euro area 
would decline by around 0.1 percentage point of GDP over the medium term 
if the 
output gaps of the euro area and its main trading partners were to converge
. A 
similar fraction of about 0.1 percentage point of GDP of the current account surplus, 
in turn, can be attributed to the deviation of oil prices from their trend level. As a

 Looking

Œ increasing markedly in 2018 and decreasing somewhat again over the

Œ imply
, based 
on standard elasticities, 
a narrowing of the euro area current account surplus by 
between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage point of GDP 
by the end of 2020
. At the same time, 
the narrowing of the negative 
output gap in the euro area 
Œ turning positive in 2018 
and projected to further increase 
over the coming years 
Œ should 
increase
 import 
demand and thereby reduce the 
euro area current account surplus. 
Based on 
standard elasticities, the 
impact 
would range 
between 0.3 percentage point of GDP 
in 2018 and 0.7 percentage point of GDP 
by the end of 2020
. However, the effect of 
the increasingly positive output gap in the euro area is partly 
Œ although not fully 
Œ offset by a similar but less pronounced improvemen
t in the global output gap, which 
is expected to add up to 0.3 percentage point of GDP to euro area foreign demand 
and thereby support the current account surplus. As a result of these two opposing 
forces, the combined effect of 
oil price and business cycl
e factors 
would 
amount
 to a 
reduction of the euro area current account surplus by betwe
en 0.3 percentage point

 Growth synchronisation in euro area countries
 30 3 Growth synchronisation 
in 
euro area countries
 By 
Jaime Martinez
-Martin, Lorena Saiz and Grigor Stoevsky
 The degree of business cycle synchronisation, both across the euro area 
countries as well as between the euro area and the rest of 
the world, is a 
pertinent research question.
 Regarding the euro area, t
he endogenous optimal 
currency area (OCA) hypothesis
12 suggests that the degree of business cycle 
synchronisation among the participating 
countries
 should increase over time
 as a 
result of
 deepening financial and trade integration. 
Individual countries 
should thus 
become less 
exposed to 
idiosyncratic shocks,
 facilitating the effectiveness of 
the 
single
 monetary policy
. 
Against this background, this box 
present
s and analyses 
several measures of
 business cycle synchronisation both within the euro area as 
well as from a global perspective
. In an environment of stronger trade and financial linkages, the favourable 
growth dynamics of recent years are common to the majority of euro 
area 
countries and world economies (see Chart A).
 Between 2014 and 2016 the share of 
world countries with strengthening growth declined, partly reflecting the negative 
impact of low oil prices on oil
-produc
ing
 countries.
 However, t
he share of countries wit
h improving growth dynamics has 
been rising
 since the second half of 2016
, with m
ore 
than half of 
euro area
 countries experienc
ing
 a strengthening of economic dynamics
. This
 has coincided with 
the broadening of economic growth 
that began in

 Gro
wth synchronisation in euro area countries
 31 The recent strengthening of growth has coincided with a broad
-based 
reduction in growth dispersion across the euro area countries and in 
advanced economies (G7) (see Chart B).
 Growth volatility across euro area 
countries was very 
high
 in th
e aftermath of the global financial crisis as well as 
during the sovereign debt crisis. This implied that the impact of the shocks was very 
diverse across countries. In contrast, the recent d
ecline
 in growth 
dispersion across 
euro area countries
 has largel
y coincided with a reduction in fragmentation in 
financing conditions
 in the euro area, facilitated by the ECB™s monetary policy 
measures.

 Notes
: The measure of business cycle correlation
 is a weighted average of pairwise cross

 of real GDP growth, 
following Stock and Watson (2008)
. The pairwise cor

two different groupings are considered: the ﬁeuro areaﬂ (all euro area countries excluding Malta and Ireland owing to data av
ailability) 
and the ﬁbig fiveﬂ euro area countries 
(the five largest euro area economies). The latest observation is for the first quarter of 2018.
 The increase in synchronisation is also evident in the fact that a substantial 
share of the variation in GDP growth across the euro area countries is 
explained
 by a common factor (see Chart D).
 The 
common
 component explains 
on average more than 65% of the GDP growth variance across euro area countries 
as well as across advanced world economies (G7). 
However, t
he share 
explained 
by 
the 
common factor
 increased s
harply
 during the financial crisis 
owing
 to the 
synchronised downturn. It is notable that synchronisation in terms of this measure 
rose again in recent years in the euro area
. This trend is
 in contrast to 
that observed 
in the
 G7 countries
, where there is les
s evidence of a common factor explaining the 
recent cross
-country variation in GDP growth.
                                                                     16  One should bear in mind that these measures do not point to the underlying factors contributing to the 
currently high lev
el of synchronicity among the euro area countries.

 The role of wages in the pick

 34 4 The role of wages in the pick
-up of inflation
 Prepar
ed by 
Jos
é Emilio 
Gumiel and 
Elke Hahn
 In current forecasts and projections, a pick
-up in labour costs is considered an 
important precondition for a sustained increase in underlying inflation.
 However, the signals provided by different labour cost indicato
rs have been mixed 
for some time. While wage growth as measured by compensation per employee or 
by compensation per hour worked has clearly strengthened over the past two years, 
unit labour cost growth, i.e. wage growth adjusted for productivity growth, ha
s remained rather flat over the same period (see Chart A). This begs the question: 
which labour cost indicators provide the relevant signal for 
the 
pass
-through
 to, and 
the outlook for,
 underlying
 inflation? 
This 
box tries to shed some light on th
is issue
 by 
analysing the transmission of two different 
typ
es of macroeconomic 
impulse, namely 
certain kinds of supply and demand shock, in the context of the 
New Area
-Wide 
Model
, and by comparing the results with the patterns of development observed in 
the recent 
past.

that this component does 
not contribute to changes in the GDP deflator.
 In the New Area
-Wide Model
 wages and productivity are defined in terms
 of persons.
 The response pattern of wages and unit labour costs following a demand 
shock is qualitatively distinct from the case of a supply shock.
 Chart C shows 
the impact of a demand shock
20 in the

Model on the GDP deflator 
and its componen
ts. The demand shock leads to an incr
ease in production and a 
higher demand for capital and labour inputs
, increasing 
both 
wages and 
employment
. Again, the impact on employment is smaller than that on 
GDP
, leading 
in the case of a positive demand shock to 
a pick

productivity
 with a

for
 emplo
yment measured both in terms of persons or hours worked, though for the latter 
the adjustment is generally stronger, given that it is easier, and therefore the drop in labour productivity 
smaller.
 20  The demand shock corresponds to the domestic risk premiu
m shock 
in the 
New Area
-Wide Model
. This 
shock reflects a wedge between the interest rate controlled by the monetary authority and the return 
required by households when taking their decisions, affecting both consumption and investment. An 
example of a ris
k premium shock is an increase in uncertainty in the economy.

 36 dampening impact on unit labour costs.
21 Given the favourable demand prospects
, companies can pass on the cost increase to prices 
so that the productivity gains and 
their downward impact on unit labour costs are absorbed by the companies via their 
profit margins. 
In the case of the demand shock therefore, 
wages 
pick up but unit 
labour costs are initially dampened and rise only with som
e delay
. This is different to 
the responses in 
the 
case of a supply shock, where the wage increases amplified by 
the productivity losses lead to an immediate increase in unit labour costs (at the cost 
of profit margins). 
In essence, the analysis shows that
 the source of the shock 
matters for the transmission of wage developments to prices.
 In the 
case of a 
demand shock, the upward price pressures are initially only 
correctly 
signalled by 
compensation per employee
, while unit labour cost developments in the 
first few 
quarters even provide contradictory signals.

 To conclude, the analysis underpins the notion in current forecasts and 
projections that rising 
wage growth will lead to upward pressures on prices.
 The constellation 
of the components of the GDP deflator resembles that of a more 
demand
-driven pick
-up in wages. This is in line with the strong output and 
employment growth observed in recent quarters, and implies that 
the increase in 
wage
 growth (rather than the 
relatively 
flat unit labour cost growth) reflects the 
relevant signal 
concerning
 upward cost pressures 
on underlying inflation
.22 This 
underpins
 the 
recent 
policy focus on wage growth as a precondition for rising 
inflation 
and determines the importance of t
he increased confidence in the rise in 
wage growth as corroborated, for instance, by the latest negotiated wage data and 
by the broad
-based nature of the pick
-up in wage growth across sectors and 
countries.
                                                                       22  Note that, if we focus on wages and employment in terms of hours worked rather than persons, the 
wage response w
ould be smaller, as mentioned before. Therefore the signalling message of rising 
wage growth is reinforced by the fact that not only compensation per employee has been increasing 
but also compensation per hour.

 Developments in mortgage loan 
origination in the euro area
 38 5 Developments in mortgage loan origination in th
e euro 
area
 Prepared by Ramón Adalid and Matteo Falagiarda
 Loans to households for house purchase appear to have 
grown at a moderate 
rate 
in recent years, 
despite
 very favourable financing conditions, the recovery 
in economic activity and dynamic housing m
arkets.
23 The annual growth rate of 
adjusted loans to households for house purchase 
was
 2.8% in the first quarter of 
2018, 
having increased gradually
 from slightly abov
e 0% in 2014 (red line in 
Chart
 Aa). However, when assessing loan developments, it should
 be noted that 
loan growth figures are usually reported in net terms, i.e.
 newly originated loans and 
the repayments of previously granted loans are considered together
 because
 statistics 
on balance sheet items 
are derived from stock figures. Given the lon
g-term 
nature of mortgage contracts, loan repayments have a long
-lasting impact on net 
figures, especially after a boom, 
and thus obfuscate
 the prevailing lending dynamics. 
Against this background, this box presents the results of a simulated portfolio 
approach which decomposes net lending flows into loan origination and the 
repayments of previously granted outstanding loans
. Examining these two 
components separately provides
 a better view of current loan developments.
24 Loan repayments have been increasingl
y dragging 
down
 net loan growth in 
recent years, concealing an increasing dynamism in loan origination.
 In the first 
quarter of 2018, loan repayments
 made a negative contribution
 to the annual growth 
rate of loans to households for house purchase 
of around
 -8 percentage points
, 
compared with 
-6 percentage points just before the boom (blue shaded area in 
Chart
 Aa). In other words, had the contribution of repayments remained constant 
since that period, the annual growth rate of loans to households for house p
urchase
 would currently be 2
 percentage points higher
. This negative contribution is expected 
to grow further, likely peaking in 2022, dragging 
down 
net loan growth by around 
3.5
 percentage points more than before the boom (this estimate is made under the 
assumption that
, in the coming years
, the stock will continue to grow at the current 
pace). Loan origination is estimated to 
currently be contributing
 around 
11 percentage points to the annual growth of loans to households for house 
purchase (yellow 
shaded 
area in Chart

loan origination are in line with the new 
data on 
ﬁpure new loansﬂ published by the 
ECB in the 
monetary financial institution interest rate (MIR) statistics 
(green line in 
Chart

: Loans to h

for house purchase are 
adjusted for sales and securitisation. 
Adjusted loans before 2015 are constructed 
by allocating to loans to households for house purchase all securitisation and loan sales adjustments of loans to households.
 From 
2015 onwards, intern
ally available data on securitisation and

The l
atest observation
s are for March
 2018. The increasing contribution of repayments 
to the annual growth rate of loans 
to households for house purchase 
is a consequence of the large amount of 
mortgages granted in the boom period 
before the financial crisis.
 The 
predetermined nature of loan repayments allows 
them to be traced
 over the life of 
their respective loans and their contribution to 
net 
loan growth 
to be broken down 
by 
period of origination. The contribution of the repaymen
ts of loans granted in the 
boom 
period 
has been increasing in the last ten years, 
and in recent years 
they have 
become
 the loan group 
that is 
contributing the most to repayments (Chart
 Ab). The 
delayed impact of 
these 
mortgage loans reflects
 the fact
 that 
principal amounts are 
repaid over a long period.
26 This lagged effect is intensified by the fact that most euro 
area mortgage loans embed increasing repayments over the life of the loan.
27 After a 
boom, this
 lag mechanism, which operates through repayments,
 has 
a long
-lasting 
                                                                    25  MIR statistics on ﬁpure new loansﬂ have been publicly available since August
 2017 and internally 
available since December
 2014. The latest MIR data are available on the

. 26  The average original maturity of the mortgages granted during the
 boom period is estimated at 
between 18 and 19
 years (data derived from the 
Household and Finance Consumption Survey
).
 27  The most prominent example is the ﬁFrenchﬂ loan, c
haracterised by a fixed monthly instalment with 
decreasing interest payments and increasing repayments over time. As the decomposition approach 
used in this box focuses on the repayments schedule of 
that type of
 loan, it also covers most variable 
rate cont
racts, as long as they share the amortisation schedule of an equivalent French loan.

 on the stock

, depressing its growth rate for many years ahead
 and thus blurring the picture of lending dynamics conveyed by net figures. For this 
reason, especially after large lending booms
, it is worth looking at loan o
rigination 
per se
, or relative to alternative scale variables
 such as
 GDP.
 While net loan flows suggest that mortgage lending remains subdued 
compared 
with
 the pre
-boom period, loan origination is currently estimated to 
be around the average observed since
 2001 (Chart
 B). This is valid both when 
annual loan flows are expressed in real terms (i.e.
 deflated by the GDP deflator) 
and when they are expressed as 
a percentage of GDP. In the 
12 months up to 
March
 2018, real loan origination amounted to around •450
 billion (or 4.5% of GDP), 
compared 
with
 an average of •405
 billion since 2001 (or an average ratio of loan 
origination to GDP of 4.4%). This is in contrast 
to
 the picture obtained by looking at 
net lending, which in Marc
h 2018 was
 at significantly lower le
vels than in the pre
-boom years. The message from loan origination is consistent with the buoyant house 
price dynamics observed in recent years
, as well as with banks™ 
own 
perceptions of 
loan dynamics as reported in the bank lending survey
 (see Section
 5 o
f this issue of 
the Economic Bulletin)
. According to this survey, both credit standards and loan 
demand have been supporting mortgage lending dynamics for a number of years, a 
situation not observed since the pre

 Country

Semester
 41 6 Country
-specific recommendations for economic policies 
under the 2018 European Semester
 Prepared by João Capella
-Ramos
 Within the EU governanc
e framework for the coordination of economic 
policies, the country
-specific recommendations (CSRs) represent an integral 
part of the annual European Semester process. They provide guidance to 
individual EU Member States on how to address structural reform 
needs and 
macroeconomic imbalances in the following 12
-18 months.
 CSRs
 are 
the 
instrument
 through which 
EU national
 economic policies 
are treated 
as a matter of 
common concern and coordinate
d within the Council 
of the European Union 
in 
accordance with Arti
cle 121
 of the
 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 
They therefore constitute a cornerstone of the EU™s macroeconomic imbalance 
procedure (MIP), whose aim is to prevent, detect and correct macroeconomic 
imbalances in individual countries, there
by containing risks to the smooth functioning 
of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Their
 timely and 
proper
 implementation is 
critical to
 reducing vulnerabilities and 
strengthen
ing
 the economic resilience of 
the 
euro area
 and the EU as a whole
, ultimately 
leading to higher growth potential 
in 
the 
long term.
28 Against the background of the 2018 CSRs received by 27 EU Member 
States (i.e. all excluding Greece
29), this
 box 
examines the policy recommendations 
addressed to 18 
euro area countries
, 
with the exception of those that pertain strictly 
to the implementation of the 
EU™s Stability and Growth Pact.
30 CSRs are the culmination of a comprehensive process of economic monitoring 
and surveillance within the European Semester, starting in the autumn
 of the 
preceding year.

 as a whole. On 
7 March
 2018, the

 The 2018 recommendations for the euro area as a whole call on Member States 
to take advantage of ongoing solid and broad
-based economic gro
wth, in a 
context of favourable financing conditions, to strengthen growth potential and 
economic resilience, and rebuild fiscal buffers.
 On 23 January 2018, the 
ECOFIN Council issued the 2018 recommendations on the economic policy of the 
euro area on the 
basis of the European Commission™s proposal. The 
recommendations urge Member States, in parallel to widening thin fiscal buffers, to 
pursue policies that support sustainable and inclusive growth and improve economic 
resilience, rebalancing and convergence
. To that end, Member States are invited to 
address structural challenges that continue to exert a drag on the economy, 
prioritising reforms that increase productivity and growth potential, improving the 
institutional and business environment, removing bott
lenecks to investment, fostering 
innovation, supporting the creation of quality jobs and reducing inequality. They are 
also encouraged to make swift progress on completing EMU, and especially the 
banking union through enhanced risk reduction and risk shari

 The 2018 CSRs give less priority to product market reforms and to labour 
market reforms aimed at ensuring 
the appropriateness of wages.
 Chart B shows 
that the number of CSRs on product market reforms remains limited and that of 
CSRs on labour market reforms, while remaining relatively sizeable, decreased 
compared with last year. However, both policy areas rema
in vital to promoting the 
reallocation of resources to their most productive uses and thereby reviving 
productivity growth and strengthening the economic resilience of EMU. Product and 
labour markets overall should 
be adaptable, open and competitive.
 In 
this regard, 
product market reforms, such as lifting barriers to market entry, would support the 
proliferation of i

dynamic 
entrepreneurs 
that 
are at the root 
of productivity gains
. Labour market policies should be formulated in su
ch a way as 
to ensure that 
wages appropriately reflect 
the underlying
 economic conditions
, in line 
with productivity at the firm, sector and country level, and workers™ qualifications. 
Indeed, while wage rigidities may be less visible in an economic upswin

negative impact may be 
sizeable when
 the economic cycle turns.

CSRs for implementation of the Stability and Growth

 Continued weak CSR implementation over recent years remains a challenge in 
view of still outstanding stock imbalances of a long

31 Chart 
C shows that most 
CSRs were, at best, only partly addressed by Member States over 
the period 2013
-17. T
he disappointing track
 record 
on implementing 
structural 
reform
s may be seen 
in the light of
 the
 cyclical upswing and the fact th
at the 
perception of 
policy challenges
 may have moderated in the favourable economic and 
financial environment. Similarly to the previous year, the European Commission 
concluded in February 2018 that the overwhelming majority (i.e. more than 90%) of 
the 20
17 CSRs had been implemented to only ﬁsomeﬂ or a ﬁlimitedﬂ extent. Only one 
of close to 80 CSRs had been ﬁsubstantiallyﬂ implemented and none had been ﬁfullyﬂ 
implemented. Moreover, countries with ﬁexcessiveﬂ macroeconomic imbalances do 
not seem to have ta
ken decisive policy action to step up the implementation of their 
2017 CSRs, even though this would have been commensurate with the
 rigidities and 
vulnerabilities remaining in 
those 
countries. 
Furthermore, some of the 2017 CSRs 
were not repeated this year,
 despite the fact that only ﬁsomeﬂ or even ﬁlimitedﬂ 
progress had been made on them, and their continued macro
-critical relevance (i.e. 
their importance to the reduction of macroeconomic imbalances). This may risk 
sending unwarranted signals; efforts made 
in recent years to contain the number of 
CSRs, which have streamlined the process, are by no means a reflection of 
improved or strong structural reform momentum.
                                                                     31  For more details, see the box entitled ﬁ

 Notes: 
The chart shows the share of MIP

CSRs 
for 
implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact
 are not included.
 Refocusing the CSRs on macro
-criti
cal policies t
hat
 facilitate a timely wind
-down of macroeconomic imbalances could encourage compliance with the 
MIP.
 Chart D shows that most 2018 CSRs are deemed significant for compliance 
with the MIP; these are referred to as ﬁMIP
-relevantﬂ. However, som
e have been 
made MIP
-relevant even though they pertain to the realm of broad economic 
coordination and only indirectly address macroeconomic imbalances.
32 Where the 
presence of excessive macroeconomic imbalances implies greater urgency, 
recommendations for 
a wide array of structural reforms may blur the focus and thus 
ultimately fail to induce effective policy action in the short term. Better prioritisation of 
CSRs according to their macro
-critical relevance could encourage compliance with 
the MIP and also h
elp incentivise countries to take firmer ownership of structural 
reforms.
 The full and effective use of all instruments available under the MIP, including 
the excessive imbalance procedure (EIP), as its corrective arm, could help 
buttress recent cyclical i
mprovements by means of structural measures that 
strengthen economic resilience and growth potential over the medium term.
33 The EIP, which so far is yet to be activated, is in essence aimed at ensuring greater 
traction for the implementation of macro
-criti
cal policies in the most vulnerable 
countries. Since it has proven difficult to reinvigorate the pace of structural reform 
under the preventive arm of the MIP, there seems to be a strong case for applying 
the EIP for all countries with excessive macroecono
mic imbalances. The application 
of the EIP would ensure the credibility and ultimate effectiveness of the MIP. In 
addition, if appropriately designed and implemented, other instruments and

 46 reform implementation and national ownership could help improve the current 
lacklustre prospects for CSR implementation in the EU.
 CSRs should serve as the key benchmark for sound economic policies at the 
country level, 
thereby 
ensuring 
consistency over time.
 The 
European 
Commission has gradually excluded from the CSRs certain policy areas which are 
covered
 by other monitoring mechanisms. These include economic aspects of the 
energy sector, moved to the Energy Union governance arrangement
s, and the 
monitoring and enforcement mechanisms related to the Single Market
. Insofar as 
they matter for the overall economic performance of the Member States, the 
continued monitoring of these policy areas remains essential, not least to ensure that 
the 
economic policies implemented by individual Member States are assessed in an 
even more comprehensive and consistent manner across time and policy areas.

 1 The evolution of the ECB™s accountability practices during 
the crisis
 Prepared by Nicolò Fra
ccaroli, Alessandro Giovannini and 
Jean
-François Jamet
 This article examines the evolution of the ECB™s accountability practices 
during 
the 
financial crisis. After describing the challenges 
stemming from
 the crisis
 and changes 
resulting from 
the conferral 
of new supervisory tasks on the ECB, it provides 
evidence on how the strengthening of the ECB™s accountability has taken shape in 
the context of its relationship with the European Parliament in line with the latter™s 
key role as provided for in the Treatie
s. The ECB and 
the European Parliament
, building on the accountability framework enshrined in primary law, have increased 
the frequency of their interactions, made innovations regarding the format and 
sharpened the focus of their exchanges, allowing 
increased scrutiny of the ECB™s 
policies. This has provided the ECB with more opportunit
ies

is acting in accordance with its democratic mandate, which is 
a fundamental pillar of its legitimacy.
 1 Introductio
n The financial crisis that emerged in 2007/2008 raised a number of challenges 
for central banks in all advanced economies.
 In order to fulfil their mandate
s during the crisis, central banks adopted a number of monetary policy measures 
taken both from with
in and outside their standard toolkits. In some cases they also 
took on new responsibilities. As a result, they have been subject to close attention 
and scrutiny, in line with the necessity for independent authorities to be held 
accountable by democratical
ly elected bodies. However, the variety and novelty of 
central bank measures tested existing accountability frameworks, as they made it 
more 
complicated 
to track and scrutinise monetary policy.
 The ECB was no exception, and the evolution of its role during
 the crisis was 
accompanied by a commensurate evolution in its accountability practices.
 Like 
other central banks, the ECB adopted a number of monetary policy measures to 
preserve price stability, which supported the euro area™s economic recovery.
34 The 
ECB
, however, had to operate in the unique institutional environment of the euro 
area
, where, during the crisis, the integrity of the monetary union was questioned 
                                                                    34  For an overview of the use of the Eurosystem™s monetary

 The evolution of the ECB™s accountability practices during the crisis
 48 and financial fragmentation hampered the transmission of monetary policy. It is 
against this ba
ckground that in July
 2012 the President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, 
said ﬁWithin our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the 
euroﬂ.
35 The ECB also took on new tasks as a micro
- and macroprudential 
supervisor, and was called 
upon 
to 
provide its expertise in financial assistance 
programmes 
alongside 
the International Monetary Fund and the European 
Commission. Despite the creation of specific accountability arrangements for its new 
tasks as a banking supervisor, the unchanged Treaty fra
mework governing 
accountability led to a perception 
in 
some 
quarters 
that the ECB™s accountability had 
not adjusted to the 
new 
policy environment.
36 This article argues that such a focus 
on the accountability 
framework
 overlooks the evolution in the ECB™s a
ccountability 
practice
s during the crisis.
 The strengthening of the ECB™s accountability has been particularly visible in 
the context of its relationship with the European Parliament, in line with the 
latter™s key role as provided for in the Treaties.
 The 
ECB is subject to the scrutiny 
of the European public at large, and, as emphasised in an ECB Monthly Bulletin 
article
 in 2002
,37 the Treaties entrust 
the European Parliament
 Œ as the 
representative of EU citizens
 Œ with a central role in holding the ECB acc
ountable. 
Building on the provisions laid down in primary law, detailed accountability practices 
had already 
been developed before the crisis. It should 
therefore 
come as no 
surprise that 
the European Parliament
 was the main and natural forum via which the
 demand for stronger ECB accountability was channelled during the crisis. 
Although 
other EU institutions, actors and communication channels also play an important 
role, this article focuses on the ECB™s active relationship with 
the European 
Parliament
. The
 ECB™s accountability practices have evolved to respond to the new 
demand for accountability.
 After explaining the concept of accountability and the 
framework set out in the Treat
ies
 to hold the ECB accountable (Section
 2), this 
article looks at the increa
sed challenges and public awareness that resulted from the 
crisis (Section
 3). While the focus of the article is on accountability for central 
banking tasks, Box
 1 in Section
 3 discusses the specific accountability framework set 
up for the task of banking 
supervision. Section
 4 provides new quantitative and 
qualitative evidence on how the ECB™s interactions with 
the European Parliament
 intensified and evolved during the crisis in terms of frequency, format and content. 
The analysis is combined with further 
insights on the evolution and intensity of 
hearings of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European 
Parliament (ECON) through text analysis in Box 2. Section
 5 summarises the main 
                                                                    35  See Draghi, M., ﬁ

 36  It should be noted, however, that the accountability mechanisms surrounding the architecture of 
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) had already been subject to critical analysis in the academic 
community before the crisis. See, for example, Amtenbrink, F.

 49 themes of the article and concludes with perspectives on t
he future of the ECB™s 
accountability practices.
 2 ECB accountability and its relevance
 Central bank accountability should be understood as the legal and political 
obligation of an independent central bank to explain and justify its decisions 
to citizens a
nd their elected representatives.
 In the case of the ECB, 
accountability is understood as an obligation vis
-à-vis the representatives of 
European citizens and 
is a crucial cornerstone of the legitimacy of the ECB and its 
policies.
38 Primary EU law sets out 
explicit accountability obligations for the ECB.
 Article
 284(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of European Union (TFEU) and 
Article
 15.3 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the 
European Central Bank provide that the ECB is prima
rily accountable to 
the 
European Parliament
, as the representative of EU citizens.
39 The ECB™s decision
-making bodies are held collectively accountable at EU 
level for the decisions they take in the pursuit of the ECB™s mandate.
 Specifically, it falls 
to 
th
e President of the ECB and other members of the Executive 
Board to explain and justify the
ir collective 
decisions 
at EU level
. This reflects the 
core provision of the Treaties
, which establishes that the ECB™s monetary policy 
mandate 
concerns 
the euro area
 as a whole and that governors of national central 
banks (NCBs) do not represent their respective countries but the interests of the 
euro area when they attend Governing Council meetings.
40 Thus
, according to the 
Treaties, 
ECB accountability is discharged 
at EU level. In other words, a single 
monetary policy requires single accountability.
41 Accountability is a fundamental aspect of delegation to independent bodies in 
democratic societies.
 The rationale for accountability can be envisaged in a 
principal
-agent framework; as powers are delegated to an agent (the ECB) 
to be 
                                                                    38  ibid.
 39  Article
 284(3) TFEU reads: ﬁ
The European Central Bank shall address an annual report on the 
activities of the ESCB and on the monetary policy of both the previous and current year 
to the 
European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and also to the European Council. The 
President of the European Central Bank shall present this report to the Council and to the European 
Parliament, which may hold a general debate on that basis.
 The President of the European Central Bank and the other members of the Executive Board may, at 
the request of the European Parliament or on their own initiative, be heard by the competent 
committees of the European Parliament.

issues.

 50 exercised 
independent
ly of its principal (
the European Parliament
 and, ultimately, EU 
citizens), there must be some provisions in place to ensure that the agent respects 
its mandate.
42 The ECB 
is granted a high degree of independence 
in order 
to be 
protected from any temptation by governments to seek changes in monetary policy.
43 Independence 
also 
protects the principal from the risk 
that 
the agent 
will be 
diverted 
from its mandate as a result of
 short
-sighted motivations. 
However, independence 
does not mean that central banks can act in a completely unfettered way.
 In modern 
democratic societies, independent institutions are accountable
.44 In fact, for the 
delegation of powers to an independent, 
unelected agent to be democratically 
legitimate, it is crucial that the agent can be held accountable by directly elected 
bodies. 
The literature emphasises 
that, f
or the accountability obligation 
in a principal
-agent relationship 
to be effective, a clear co
ntract detailing the mandate conferred 
upon the agent 
is needed 
in order to allow adequate scrutiny of the agent by the 
principal.
45 In the case of the ECB, such a contract is represented by the Treaty, 
which enshrines the ECB™s mandate of price stability i
n primary law.
 The legitimacy of the ECB™s independence therefore relies on its 
accountability.
 Accountability ensures that independence does not lead to 
arbitrariness and that the mandate is fulfilled. From this perspective, proper 
accountability arrangem
ents strengthen the case for independence.
46 Independence 
and accountability are therefore two inseparable sides of the same coin and 
reinforce each other.
47 Only through a strong and well
-defined governance 
framework is it possible for central banks to be ﬁvery powerful and independent yet 
unelectedﬂ.
48 Even before the crisis, accountability practices had already been developed 
that not only reflected Treaty r
equirements but also went beyond them.
 In line 
with the Treaty requirements, every year the ECB submits to 
the European 
Parliament
, the Council, the Commission and the European Council an annual report 
on its tasks, the activities of the European System of
 Central Banks (ESCB) and the 
                                                                    42  For a comparative discussion on the design of accou

 Annual Report
 The ECB submits an annual report on its tasks, the activities of the ESCB and the 
Eurosystem™s monetary policy to 
the European Parliament
, the Council and the 
Commission. The report is pr
esented each year in the European Parliament by the 
Vice
-President of the ECB in a dedicated session of the ECON committee and by the 
President on the occasion of a plenary debate.
 Hearings and exchanges of views
 The ECB™s President participates in quarterly hearings before 
the 
ECON
 committee
. Other Executive Board members also participate in ECON committee hearings to 
explain the ECB™s reasoning and decisions on specific topics.
 Written questions
 Members of the E
uropean Parliament can address written questions to the ECB.
  The ECB has also developed further channels of communication over the 
years to make its decisions more transparent to the general public so that EU 
citizens are better able to understand and ju
dge them.
 Communication and 
transparency are crucial aspects of the ECB™s accountability.
55 Through various 
channels, the ECB provides the general public and markets with all relevant 
information on its strategy, assessments and policy decisions. Among othe
r things, 
the ECB holds press conferences immediately after the Governing Council™s 
monetary policy meetings. In addition, building on Article
 284(3) TFEU and 
Article
 15.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, eight times a year the ECB publishes 
its 
Economic Bullet
in, which 
covers 
the main economic, financial and monetary 
developments that formed the basis for the Governing Council™s policy decision, and 
each week it publishes the consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem, 
which provides information on mone
tary policy operations, foreign exchange 
operations and investment activity. Furthermore, the ECB recently increased the 
transparency of the Governing Council monetary policy meetings, 
which are held 
every six weeks
, by publishing the accounts of the 
discussions. Notably, the ECB 
was the first major central bank to organise regular press conferences after each 
monetary policy meeting.
56 In addition, the members of the Executive Board are 
regularly in contact with the public through articles, interviews 
and speeches at 
public events. All these measures (summarised in Table
 2) help to clarify the ECB™s 
policy decisions and the reasons underlying them, providing additional tools for 
scrutiny to other EU institutions, including 
the European Parliament
, and t
o EU 
citizens, beyond traditional accountability channels.
                                                                     55  The two dimensions of transparency are relevant in this respect. On the one hand, transparency is 
considered as a tool aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the ECB™s policy. As explained on the 
ECB™s website
, transparency helps the public to understand the ECB's monetary policy, and better 
public understanding makes the policy more credible and effective. On the other hand, 
transparency is 
considered as an essential governance tool for securing public trust in the institution. See Cœuré, B., 
op. cit. The ECB™s transparency has recently been the subject of debate in the literature in relation to 
ECB accountability and independ
ence. See, for example, Curtin, D., ﬁ‚Accountable Independence™ of

  3 The challenge posed to the ECB™s accountability by the 
crisis
 The crisis challenged the ECB™s accountability on two main fronts.
 The first 
affected all major central banks; with the crisis, the scrutiny of monetary policy 
became more 
complicated 
owing to the exceptional economic 
circumstances 
and the 
recourse to non
-standard measures. The second uniquely affected the ECB, as it 
ste
mmed from the evolution of the institutional framework 
of Economic and Monetary 
Union (EMU) 
in response to the crisis.
 The crisis and the adoption of non
-standard measures challenged central 
banks™ accountability by making the scrutiny of monetary policy m
ore 
complicated.
 The adoption of a variety of measures
 Œ standard and non
-standard
 Œ and the implications of the crisis for the transmission of monetary policy in the euro 
area meant
, for instance
, that, in crisis times, it turned out to be nearly impossib
le to 
track the monetary policy stance using simple tools.
57 On the one hand, the 
realisation of the key role of monetary policy during the crisis led to increased 
attention being paid to its design and implications, including operational aspects of 
asset p
urchases and their distributional consequences. On the other hand, the 
general public had to confront the growing complexity
, both in 
terms 
of the variety of 
instruments being used simultaneously and in 
terms 
of each individual instrument 
being more comple
x in its implementation and its effect on the economy.
58 In this 
context, it should also be noted that the ECB is the central bank for 19
 countries
, and, as an EU institution, 
it 
has to be understood in an even larger number of 
languages. In all these count
ries

 The evolution of the ECB™s accountability practices during the crisis
 54 expectations are different, thus creating a continuous challenge.
59 The growing 
complexity posed a serious challenge in terms of accountability
, not only to the ECB 
but also to other central banks in ad
vanced economies, where some 
people 
have 
openly 
questioned 
the balance between independence and accountability.
60 The second challenge is specific to the European institutional context and is 
related to the new tasks assigned to the ECB.
 As part of the refo
rm of the 
governance of EMU during the crisis,
 the ECB was entrusted with a number of new 
functions that go beyond its traditional role as 
a central bank. Among 
other things
, 
the ECB was 
given 
responsibility for the microprudential supervision of the euro 
area 
banking system with the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in 
2014. W
ith the entry into force of the SSM Regulation, the ECB was 
also 
given 
macroprudential tools to tackle the emergence of possible systemic risks in the 
financial syste
m.61 In addition, since 2010 the ECB has 
had an advisory role in EU 
financial assistance programmes, acting in liaison with the European Commission; 
this 
role was 
subsequently 
codified in the ﬁtwo
-packﬂ regulation.
62 This expansion of 
the ECB
™s role and tasks led commentators to wonder whether the ECB could 
remain accountable, given the need for the ﬁprincipalﬂ to monitor a wider range of 
instruments and objectives simultaneously.
63 Finally, a 
specific feature 
of EMU is 
the 
interaction of 
the ECB
™s policies 
with other policies in a multi
-level governance 
context
; while EU policies have assumed a 
greater 
role during the crisis (e.g.
 through 
the creation of the banking union), in some instances they still overlap with national 
policies, possibly con
tributing to confusion among the general public over the 
assignment of responsibilities and accountability arrangements.
64 As a result of these challenges, the ECB™s monetary policy has been subject to 
increased attention and public scrutiny.
 Hard evidence 
of this growing public 
interest in the ECB™s actions can be seen in the media coverage. From an 
accountability perspective, it is notable that the sharp rise in the number of ECB
-related newspaper articles after the start of the sovereign debt crisis in 20
10 (Chart
 1) was accompanied by a similar rise in the number of articles citing the ECB 
and the European Parliament
 together. This might suggest more extensive media 
reporting on ECB
-European Parliament accountability channels. Such attention was 
not limit

 The evolution of the ECB™s accountability pract
ices during the crisis
 55 While the regular press conference after the Governing Council meeting remained 
their primary focus for understanding the ECB™s monetary policy, the appearances of 
the ECB President befo
re 
the European Parliament
 also 
captured the attention of 
market participants on some occasions, as they were looking for possible signs of 
changes in the future monetary policy stance. While the analysis of high frequency 
data changes in financial market 
asset prices tentatively shows that these hearings 
have generally had no 
significant
 market impact, on 
a few occasions (e.g.
 the regular 
hearing of November
 2015) there was some relatively minor and mostly short
-lived 
market reaction. However, the ECB has 
treated such appearances primarily as an 
accountability tool to provide MEPs with the justifications for its policy choices, rather 
than 
as 
an alternative channel to communicate with the markets, as is also apparent 
from the data.

 The evolution of the ECB™s accountability practices during the crisis
 56 It was important from the ECB™s perspective to make sure that its 
accountability evolved to address developments brought about by
 the crisis in 
a manner consistent with its independence.
 After the establishment of the SSM, 
specific accountability arrangements were developed and put in place, to hold the 
supervisory arm of the ECB accountable. Such a regime, developed within the 
exis
ting accountability framework, was laid down in the SSM Regulation
65 and is 
described in Box
 1. For existing central banking tasks subject to increased scrutiny, 
Treaty provisions and the overall framework did not need to be amended; the 
extended use of 
the
ir 
scope 
allowed the ECB™s accountability practices to evolve.
66 Box
 1  Accountability provisions for the new task of supervision
 Prepared by Joachim Eule and Nicol
ò Fraccaroli
 The creation of the SSM in 2014 and the consequent conferral of supervisory resp
onsibilities 
on the ECB led to one of the significant changes to the accountability framework brought 
about by the crisis.
 As part of the SSM Regulation, a specific regime was laid down regarding the 
ECB™s accountability for this new task. The practical fu
lfilment of supervisory accountability 
requirements was further clarified in an Interinstitutional Agreement between 
the European 
Parliament
 and the ECB
67 and a Memorandum of Understanding between the Council and the 
ECB.
68 In line with these, the three ﬁtra
ditionalﬂ channels of the ECB accountability framework have 
been extended to 
ECB Banking Supervision
. First, the Chair of the Supervisory Board attends 
regular hearings and exchanges of views in 
the European Parliament
.69 Second, MEPs can 
address written qu
estions related to supervision to the Chair of the Supervisory Board
. In the 
course of 2017, the ECB published 
39 replies to MEPs™ questions on supervisory matters (Chart
 A). 
Third, since 2014 the ECB has published an annual report on its supervisory activ
ities, which is 
presented by the Chair of the Supervisory Board to 
the European Parliament
 at a public hearing. 
The report is also submitted to the Council, the Eurogroup, the Commission and the national 
parliaments of participating Member States. As a res
ult of this framework, between February
 2014 and March
 2018 Danièle Nouy, Chair of the Supervisory Board, appeared 20
 times before 
the 
European Parliament
 for ordinary hearings
 and ad hoc exchanges of views with MEPs and to 
present the 
annual 
reports. In a
ddition to the hearings and exchanges of views provided for in the 
Interinstitutional Agreement, the Chair and Vice
-Chair of the Supervisory Board also participated in 
hearings with MEPs on revisions of EU banking legislation and the European Court of Audi
tors™ 
report on ECB Banking Supervision.

 In addition, the SSM Regulation and the 
Interinstitutional Agreement provide for some 
accountability channels which are specific to the ECB™s supervisory function.
 Among other 
things, as agreed in the Interinstitutional Agreement, the ECB provides 
the European Parliament
 with a comprehensive and
 meaningful record of the proceedings of the Supervisory Board 
which is 
accessible to MEPs in a secure reading room. The SSM Regulation also establishes the format 
for 
confidential oral discussions to ensure full confidentiality 
of 
exchanges with 
the 
European 
Parliament
 where needed. These channels allow comprehensive and thorough interaction between 
the ECB and the European Parliament on supervisory issues and thus a high degree of 
accountability.
  To assess the evolution of accountability practices, 
it is necessary to go 
beyond the indexes economists use to measure the degree of central bank 
independence and accountability.
 As the criteria on which accountability indexes 
are built only refer to statutory provisions, they are unable to account for all 
relevant 
aspects of central banks™ democratic accountability
. The indexes tend not to evolve 
significantly over time,
70 giving rise to the impression that changes in the frameworks 
do not adequately match changing accountability demands (Chart
 3). However, 
this 
                                                                    70  See Garriga, A.C., ﬁCentral Bank Independence in the World: A New Datasetﬂ, International

Parliament™s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, 2009. Notably, De Grauwe and Gros point 
out that by comparing their update with the estimates proposed in the literature, ﬁit emerges tha
t the 
[accountability] indexes do not show any significant change in accountabilityﬂ (p.
 20). Looking at the 
results from the five different studies, they found that the ECB performed similarly to the Federal 
Reserve System and the Bank of Japan in terms o
f accountability, but not as well as the Bank of 
England. In particular, the low score of the ECB is driven by institutional factors, such as the 
impossibility for the European Parliament to veto the appointment of ECB Executive Board members. 
On the other
 hand, the ECB has the same score as other central banks in terms of parliamentary 
exchanges.

 The evolution of the ECB™s accountability practices during the crisis
 58 mismatch can largely be explained by the 
de jure
 nature of such indexes; they are 
estimated on the basis of legal provisions designed to ensure that the central bank 
remains accountable (for accountability indexes) and to shield it from political 
pres
sures (for independence indexes). As pointed out in the literature, however, it is 
important to look at 
de facto
 accountability, which depends not only on the legal 
provisions, but also on the intensity of interactions between the parliament and the 
centra
l bank.
71 In the case of the ECB, its accountability practice
s evolved during the 
crisis to allow enhanced scrutiny, as discussed in the next section.

ECB™s accountability practice
s Building on Treaty provisions, the ECB reacted to the challenges of the crisis 
by enhancing its accountability practices in terms of frequency, format and 
content, as well as in terms of interactions with other stakeholders.
 The legal 
framework was flexible enough to accommodate the increased need for the ECB to 
explain and justify its policies before 
the European Parliament
. This was not only 
driven by external demands, as it was in the ECB™s own interest to provide the publi
c and the markets with a comprehensive analysis of the economic situation and 
monetary policy decisions to enhance the predictability and credibility of 
the 
ECB
™s monetary policy.

 The evolution of the ECB™s accountability practices during the crisis
 59 4.1
 Frequency and format
 The frequency of the exchanges between the ECB and
 the European 
Parliament increased substantially during the crisis, as regular hearings 
before the European Parliament were complemented by additional ad hoc 
hearings.
 The quarterly ECON hearings remained the cornerstone of the 
relationship between the ECB
 and the European Parliament
. Nevertheless, as the 
parliamentary rules regulate the number and timing of MEPs™ oral questions to the 
ECB President, other instruments were used to intensify the frequency of 
ECB
-European Parliament interactions. Building on 
Article
 284(3) TFEU, ECB 
representatives were invited to numerous additional exchanges during the crisis (18 
exchanges between 2008 and 2017). These included an extraordinary ECON 
hearing of the ECB President on the crisis in August
 2011, as well as an in 
camera 
exchange of views with the ECB President on the report ﬁToward a genuine 
Economic and Monetary Unionﬂ in 2012. Furthermore, there were three additional 
ECON hearings with ECB representatives on matters related to EU financial 
assistance programmes,
73 one exchange of views on the crisis in general,
74 two on 
economic governance, four on payment and settlement system issues, and one on 
statistical issues.
75 Moreover, Executive Board members participated in a series of 
meetings organised by the European Par
liament which also involved members of 
national parliaments (
such as 
in the European Parliamentary Week
76) and in 
exchanges of views with national parliaments.
77 Furthermore, the number of written questions addressed to the ECB from 
MEPs has increased substa
ntially over the past two legislative terms.
 Chart
 4 shows that the crisis was a prominent determinant of this upward trend, leading 
to a 
substantial increase in written questions between the 6th and 7th parliamentary 
terms, and a particularly sharp rise i
n the 8th term. In the 7th parliamentary term, 
MEPs sent more than twice as many written questions than their peers 
had done 
in 
                                                                    73  In the context of the enquiry on the role and operations of the Troika (ECB, Commission and IMF) with 
regard to the euro area programme countries, the ECB also provided 
written replies
 to the 
questionnaire submitted by the European Parliament which are available on the ECB™s website.
 74  In 2009 José Manuel González
-Páramo participated in a hearing organised by the European 
Parliament™s Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis (see 
ECB Annual 
Report
 2009
, p.
 170).
 75  Though not to be counted as part of the ECB™s accountability obligations, there were also a number of 
staff
-level exchanges on topical issues. See, for example, 
ECB Annu
al Report
 2012
, p.
 148, and 
ECB 
Annual Report
 2013
, p.
 164. The exchange of views on statistical issues mentioned in the text was in 
relation to AnaCredit, a statistical project aimed at 
setting up a dataset containing detailed information 
on individual bank loans in the euro area, harmonised across all member countries. The project 
attracted the attention of a number of MEPs who also addressed written questions to the ECB on the 
topic. Th
e 
meeting with Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschläger
 provided, inter alia, an 
opportunity to explain in detail the procedure followed by the ECB in preparing the Ana
Credit 
Regulation, in setting out the costs linked to it and in ensuring stakeholders™ involvement.
 76  Since February
 2012, at the beginning of every year the European Parliament has organised an 
interparliamentary event on the European Semester for Econom
ic Policy Coordination called the 
European Parliamentary Week which gathers together parliamentarians from all over the EU to discuss 
economic, budgetary and social matters. The European Parliamentary Week aims to provide a 
framework for debate and exchang
e of information between national parliaments and the European 
Parliament in order to ensure democratic accountability in the area of economic governance in the EU.
 77  While the ECB™s interaction with national parliaments is not part of its accountability 
activities, it is worth 
noting that since 2012 the ECB President has spoken before six national parliaments: in Germany (in 
2012 and 2016), in Spain and France (2013), in Finland (2014), in Italy (2015) and in the Netherlands 
(2017). In addition, other mem
bers of the Executive Board have also participated in meetings in 
national parliaments.

smaller political groups, which partly compensates for the limited number of oral

78 This suggests that t

enhancing the channels for the realisation of the ECB™s accountability obligations.

 While 
the European

parliamentary tool since 1999, the increase in the number of amendments

In 2017 t
he number of amendments

difference is even starker when comparing the number of amendments 
pri
or to 
the 
sovereign debt crisis of 2010 with 
the number 
tabled during and after it. The sum of 
all the amendments tabled 
to 
the own
-initiative reports from 2005 to 2009 is lower 
than the sum of the amendments tabled 
to 
the reports for 2010 and 2011 alone (
375 against 468). Although these data may be the result of a higher degree of 
polarisation between political groups,
79 they also confirm that the ECB™s annual 
                                                                    78  Under the internal rules of the European Parliament, the slots for questions and answers during 
hearings are allocated according to the size of the political group, 
thus reducing the opportunity for 
smaller groups and non
-aligned MEPs to put oral questions to the ECB President.

 Content
 The intensification of the interactions between the ECB and the European 
Parliament has been accompanied by a change in the content of th
e exchanges.
 Looking at the evolution of topics over time, it can be observed that 
MEPs have focused their questions on issues 
that are topical 
at the time of the 
regular hearings. The regular Monetary Dialogue thus provided a primary 
accountability forum to explain the ECB™s position on matters related to the policy 
and political agenda of the 
day
. The opportunity to discuss topical issues is cer
tainly 
an important factor when determining the effectiveness of an accountability tool. In 
line with this, the results of a recent survey
84 showed that 50% of MEPs always 
found the exchanges with the ECB President useful, and none of them found them 
useles
s. Box
 2  The evolution of the topics and tone of the ECB parliamentary hearings
 Prepared by Nicol
ò Fraccaroli
 Text analysis techniques provide additional insights on the evolution of the content and tone 
of ECON hearings over time.
 On the basis of the ECO
N hearing transcripts, it is possible to 
identify the words used most frequently during these exchanges between 1999 and 2018 and their 
evolution.
85 The ﬁword cloudﬂ of the hearings provides a visual overview of the most frequent words 
in 
the exchanges (Cha
rt A), showing that 
euro
, 
monetary policy
, 
inflation
 and growth
 were the most 
prominent terms that emerged during the debates. At the same time, the focus of attention evolved 
with the crisis
. Understandably, the crisis itself became a prominent topic of 
the Monetary Dialogue, 
especially at the peak of the crisis in the euro area (Chart
 B).

 at risk
.86 However, these opinions have often relied on anecdotal evidence, 
owing 
to the failure of the 
measures 
commonly 
used 
in 
the literature to account for such changes, as explained in the 
previous section. Text analysis allows this gap 
to be filled 
and provides empirical evidence. 
Following the literature 
on sentiment analysis applied to texts,
87 it is possible to calculate the degree 
of positive and negative sentiment populating the Monetary Dialogue, to proxy the negative tone 
used during hearings both 
by the ECB and by MEPs
, and thus 
to 
measure how the tone of the 
parliamentary debates 
has 
changed 
over 
time (see Chart
 C).

Liu 
and collaborators for

which consists in matching each term of the transcripts with the ones contained in two lists of positive and negative words t

they 
have not been fully 
translated in

 In spite of the crisis
, the overall tone of the debate remained positive.
 After reaching a peak in 
February
 2004, sentiment fell to its worst level in December
 2007, at the beginning of the recession. 
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that this negative level did not differ signi
ficantly from the low point 
reached in October
 2002. Furthermore, sentiment 
had 
already started to decline, albeit more 
moderately, in 2005, two years before the crisis occurred. However, the tone of the dialogue swiftly 
recovered after 2008 and, despite b
eing characterised by some ups and downs, remained quite 
stable over the crisis period, with some positive peaks. This seems to suggest that the ECON 
hearings between the ECB President and MEPs serve as a useful platform for constructive 
dialogue, even in 
times of crisis. This analysis has, however, some methodological limits. For 
                                                                    86  For a review of the debate, see Merler, S. ﬁ

 The
 evolution of the ECB™s accountability practices during the crisis
 65 example, low sentiment ratios during the crisis may stem from the negative economic outlooks 
discussed in the hearings
 and commented on by MEPs. Nonetheless, the stability of sent
iment 
throughout the crisis suggests that the relationship between the two institutions did not crumble, 
and that the accountability framework supporting it proved resilient to the challenge of an economic 
downturn.
  The European Parliament improved its us
e of expert advice in preparation for 
the hearings with the President.
 The MEPs™ lack of expertise in technical economic 
and financial issues was identified as a possible factor weakening the scrutiny efforts 
of the European Parliament
.88 Since
 1999, before
 each Monetary Dialogue
 meeting
, 
the ECON committee commissions briefing papers from a panel of experts, who 
provide MEPs with technical insights on 
current 
topics. It has been argued that 
MEPs proved more successful in influencing monetary policy when the
y were in line 
with the experts.
89 While some critics 
have 
noted in the past that the 
requests for 
advice from experts by 
the European Parliament
 did not focus enough on technical 
aspects related to monetary policy,
90 Chart
 6 shows that over the last parliam
entary 
term 
the European Parliament
 has reduced the number of topics and focused more 
on monetary policy aspects.
91 This suggests that MEPs are increasingly relying on 
expert input 
in this area
, as is also evidenced by a recent survey among MEPs.
92                                                                     88  See Wyplosz, C., ﬁ

95 Furthermore, with respect to the most recent years, 
the fact that MEPs have tended to focus on new topics and topical issu

 The breakdown of topics in the written questions MEPs sent to the ECB 
suggests that this accountability tool plays a compl
ementary role.
 Monetary 
policy has also been the most frequent topic in written questions during the last two 
parliamentary terms (Chart
 8). 
Questions on financial sector policies shrank from 
19% in the 7th term to 5% in the 8th term (partly because, since
 2014, it has been 
possible to address written questions to the Chair of the Supervisory Board), while 
questions on the EU financial assistance programmes increased. It is worth noting 
                                                                    94  In this respect, the response of former ECB President Jean

30
 June
 2011 is quite telling: ﬁ
I would have expected a lot of questions on our monetary policy, on the
 level of inflation, on what inflation will be in two years™ time, on whether our projections are right or 
wrong, and on whether we are right or wrong to have the present level of interest rates, taking into 
account other decisions taken elsewhere in the w
orld. However, I see that you have such a confidence 
in my institution that these are not a problem or an issue at all! I have also had a lot of questions on 
issues for which we are not responsible. We are responsible for the euro area as a whole and for p
rice

 68 that, unlike 
at 
regular hearings, the largest share of written question
s in 2014 and 
2015 concerned 
events in Greece. Written questions gave smaller political groups 
(with only limited speaking time in hearings) and national constituencies the 
opportunity to ask questions on the matter and gave the ECB the opportunity to 
pres
ent its views on several aspects of the Greek adjustment programme.
97 The 
higher share of written questions on institutional matters also points to the 
complementary role they play, suggesting that MEPs use them to ask more detailed 
questions on issues not 
usually addressed during hearings owing to, for instance, 
time constraints. This gave the ECB the opportunity to explain in greater detail the 
functioning of its decision
-making process
98 and to provide more information on its 
activities.
99                                                                     97  For instance,
 between March
 2015 and October
 2015, the ECB President answered 15 written 
questions on the Greek adjustment programme, explaining, inter alia, the precise functioning and 
rationale for the eligibility rules applied to Greek bonds used as collateral in Eu
rosystem monetary 
policy operations.
 98  For instance, in 
an answer to a written question from several MEPs
, the ECB President provided a full 
description of the 
methodology for computing the total seigniorage income earned by the ECB and 
provided all the requested background information (e.g.
 yearly data on the retention/distribution of this

 Interaction with other stakeholders
 The increased interest in holding the ECB accountable has primarily affected 
the ECB™s interaction with the European Parliament, but other EU institutions 
and actors have also played an important 
role in providing checks and 
balances.
 The ECB™s accountability is embedded in a network of interactions with 
other institutions, which are intensified at times of crisis.

the Court of 
Justice of the European Union has become more involved in

 70 implications, since individuals can challenge the ECB™s conduct by seeking damages 
as well as 
by 
asking the Court to annul ECB decisions 
on grounds 
of illeg
ality.
102 The 
European Ombudsman is another institution which plays a role, as it can be involved 
in matters regarding transparency and good governance. The operational efficiency 
of the ECB™s management is examined by the European Court of Auditors (ECA) in
 accordance with Article
 27 of the Statute of the ESCB. Other relevant institutions 
include 
the European Anti
-Fraud Office (OLAF), which has the power to conduct 
administrative investigations within the ECB for the purposes of fighting fraud, 
corruption an
d other illegal activities, and the European Data Protection Supervisor, 
which monitors and ensures compliance with data protection legislation in 
the ECB™s 
data
-processing operations. Moreover, other civil society organisations have 
contributed to the deb
ate on accountability. For instance, the debate spurred by the 
publication of the Transparency International report on the ECB™s accountability and 
transparency was welcomed by the ECB,
103 as it provided an opportunity for open 
and balanced dialogue with non
-governmental organisations (NGOs).
 None of these institutions and bodies act in isolation, and their actions have a 
bearing on the ECB™s accountability to the European Parliament.
 For instance, 
judgments of the Court have been referred to by both the ECB 
and MEPs during 
their regular exchanges. Similarly, reports by the ECA, the European Ombudsman, 
NGOs and academics have been discussed with MEPs, both in the context of the 
regular hearings and in written answers.
104 5 Conclusions
 This article has provided 
both quantitative and qualitative evidence of the 
evolution of the ECB™s accountability practices in response to the quest for 
scrutiny that emerged from the crisis.
 While the Treaty provisions on 
accountability have remained unchanged, a new accountabilit
y framework has been 
created in order to cater for the new supervisory tasks entrusted to the ECB. 
Moreover, within the existing framework
, the ECB and 
the European Parliament
 have 
increased the frequency of their interactions, innovated on format and incr
eased the 
focus of exchanges in response to the demand for 
greater 
scrutiny of 
the 
ECB™s 
actions. On the one hand, this 
has 
resulted in an enhanced use by 
the European 
Parliament
 of the accountability instruments at its disposal. On the other hand, the 
ECB
 also 
has an interest in strengthening its accountability practices vis
-à-vis 
the 
                                                                    102  See Mersch, Y., op. cit.

 as part of an effort to explain its policies in a more complex 
environment.
 The joint effort by the two institutions allowed a high degree of central bank
 accountability to be ensured throughout the crisis.
 The pre
-existing 
accountability framework allowed increased scrutiny and thus proved its robustness. 
The ECB was able to explain and demonstrate that it was acting in accordance with 
its 
democratic manda
te
, which 
is a fundamental pillar of its legitimacy.
 Despite the evolution of the ECB™s accountability practices, public demand for 
increased scrutiny remains high.
 The increase in public awareness of the ECB 
persists, while trust in the ECB has been recov
ering 
gradually 
since 2014, as 
reported by the Eurobarometer.
105 While 
enhancing 
the general public™s 
understanding of financial and economic interrelations help
s them better understand 
the ECB™s policies,
106 accountability is still indispensable to the ECB as a channel to 
explain its actions to citizens and thereby contribute to public trust, which is itself an

 Prepared by Jens Eisenschmidt, Danielle Kedan and Robin Tietz
 The overnight money market plays an important role in the implementation and 
transmission of monetary policy in the
 euro area. Money market fragmentation is a 
sign of impairment in the transmission mechanism which merits the close monitoring 
of a set of suitable indicators. This article discusses concepts and measurement of 
fragmentation and proposes a new measure of f
ragmentation from a monetary policy 
transmission perspective.
 1 Introduction
 The overnight money market is the starting point of the monetary policy 
transmission mechanism.
 Expectations about the path of the ECB™s key policy 
rates underpin the expected pat
h of overnight rates.
 Overnight rates, in turn,
 anchor 
the entire yield curve, as long
-term rates that matter most for economic activity are a 
function of expectations of future overnight rates plus risk premia.
 Hence, a well
-functioning overnight money ma
rket without fragmentation is important for the 
transmission of monetary policy.
 The unsecured overnight interbank segment is especially relevant, because 
price formation in this market has arguably the closest link to monetary policy.
 The unsecured segmen
t remains highly relevant for the implementation and 
transmission of monetary policy, notwithstanding the secular shift in euro area 
money market activity towards secured transactions.
107 Prices
 in this segment reflect 
supply and demand dynamics for central 
bank reserves. As such, 
price
 formation is 
predominantly liquidity
-driven and 
depends on 
factors under the direct control of the 
central bank: (i)
 the key policy rates and (ii)
 the quantity of reserves provided by the 
central bank. By contrast, 
the demand 
for central bank reserves is not necessarily 
the driving factor 
behind
 price formation
 in the secured money market. 
For
 the 
majority of 
repo transactions
, it is the supply of and demand for collateral that drives 
prices. 
Although monetary policy can impact
 the market for collateral,
108 exogenous 
factors such as regulation
109 are also important.
 Fragmentation is a sign of impairment in the initial transmission of monetary 
policy, which can undermine its effectiveness in steering broad 
credit
                                                                     107  For further discussion of the decline in unsecured money market activity, see ﬁEuro money market 
study 2014ﬂ, ECB, April
 2014 and ﬁFinancial integration in Europeﬂ, ECB, May
 2018, p.

 108  This can happen both indirectly (e.g.
 via the central bank™s collateral framework) and directly (e.g.
 via 
central bank asset purchase programmes).

holds and firms.
 The first signs of market stress 
during the 
financial crisis became evident in the unsecured
 interbank
 segment
. The ECB
 Œ as 
well as other central banks
 Œ therefore closely monitored developments in interbank 
funding markets 
over 
the 
course of the
 crisis, as evidenced in official publications, 
speeches and summaries of policy meetings.
110 To address impairments in the 
interbank market, the ECB introduced a variety of measures, such as fixed rate 
tender procedures with full allotment, add
itional longer
-term refinancing operations 
and reciprocal liquidity swap lines 
with s
everal 
other 
central banks
. The financial crisis led to an increase in academic research on interbank 
markets to improve understanding of their structure and functioning, 
as well 
as the sources and degree of stress and fragmentation in these markets.
 For 
example,
 Heider et al. develop a model of interbank lending and borrowing with 
counterparty risk and analyse how banks™ private information about risks affect
s the 
trading 
and pricing of liquidity in this market segment.
111 Eisenschmidt and Tapking 
show that concerns about market access in the future can lead banks to either 
increase their short
-term lending rates or withdraw entirely from interbank lending.
112 Cocco et al. and 
Bräuning and Fecht find that lending relationships are an important 
determinant of the availability of funding and the interest rate at which banks can 
borrow in the interbank market.
113 Frutos et al. examine stress in the European 
interbank market using pay
ments systems data; they find that increased 
counterparty risk of borrowers in non
-core euro area countries resulted in less 
lending 
by banks in core countries.

 Measuring fragmentation in the euro area unsecured overnight interbank money market:
 a monetary po
licy transmission approach
 74 overnight money market transactions. Section
 4 discusses the properties of the new 
indicator compared with existing indicators.
 2 Defining and measu
ring fragmentation
 From a monetary policy transmission perspective, fragmentation can be 
viewed as the lack of full tradability of central bank reserves across borders 
which cannot be explained by technical or fundamental factors.
 In the context of 
a monet
ary union, a well
-functioning money market without fragmentation implies 
that reserves flow freely between banks. As a result, interest rates should
 satisfy the 
law of one price, meaning that they should
 be homogenous across banks after 
controlling for tec
hnical (e.g.
 access to the central banks™ standing facilities)
116 and fundamental factors (e.g.
 counterparty credit risk) that would justify rate differentials. 
Although there might be idiosyncratic factors affecting cross
-border trading, there 
should be no 
systematic impediments to cross
-border borrowing and lending in a 
non-fragmented market.
117 Conceptually, f
ragmentation in the euro area is often viewed through the lens 
of financial integration
, while data availability has led to indicators deviating 
from t
his concept being used to assess the state of fragmentation
. Seen from 
th
e financial integration
 perspective, impairment in cross
-border market activity
 Œ in 
terms of either interest rate differentials across countries or the 
lack
 of cross
-border 
funding
 Œ can indicate fragmentation. Measuring fragmentation in terms of risk
-adjusted rates and cross
-border activity requires transaction data which are not 
publicly available. In practice, therefore, fragmentation has often been assessed 
using timely and readil
y available indicators of money market 
activity
 (e.g.
 money 
market interest rate spreads
, which are not necessarily indicative of cross
-border 
fragmentation
). Other measures used to gauge fragmentation include indicators of 
interest rate dispersion (which 
is linked to the law of one price),
118 network 
dynamics
119 and recourse to the Eurosystem™s balance sheet.
120                                                                     116  Counterparty access to the Eurosystem™s balance sheet is one technical factor that can affect pric
ing in 
the money market.
 Only banks located in the euro area are eligible to participate in Eurosystem 
refinancing operations and 
have 
access 
to 
the standing facilities. As a result, the ECB™s key interest 
rates are not the relevant opportunity costs for a
ll participants in the interbank market. Banks without 
access to the standing facilities must deposit euro reserves with another bank that does have access. 
The ensuing asymmetry in bargaining power can exert downward pressure on interbank rates 
when 
there
 is 
high excess liquidity. In the current environment, the rates at which non
-euro area banks lend 
to (or place deposits with) euro area banks are below the 
deposit facility rate
. Hence, market rates can 
deviate more from key policy rates when non
-euro are
a banks account for a larger share of activity in 
the interbank money market. Such deviations arise from the technical issue of counterparty access to 
the Eurosystem™s balance sheet
, however,
 and do not necessarily signal impairment in the monetary 
policy 
transmission mechanism
. 117  In the Germ
an banking system, for example,
 there are institutional lending relationships between 
savings banks and Landesbanks
, which can reduce the need to participate in the interbank market
. See

 Measuring fragmentation in the euro area unsecured overnight interbank money market:
 a monetary policy transmission approach
 75 Different measures reflect different aspects of fragmentation and can be 
affected by non
-standard monetary policies.
 Prior to the financial crisis, the 
three
-month EURIBOR
-OIS spread was small (
see 
Chart
 1).
121 As money market tensions 
increased in 2007, 2008 and 2011, this commonly
 used metric widened sharply, 
before narrowing again in response to the non
-standard monetary policy measures 
introduced over t
he past decade
. The figure
 has been very stable since 2013 and is 
currently below its pre
-crisis level.
122 Like many other indicators, the EURIBOR
-OIS 
spread is affected by central bank interventions, making it difficult to distinguish the 
underlying degree 
of fragmentation from the mitigating impact of central bank 
policies. Similarly, cross
-border trading volumes
 Œ another common measure of 
fragmentation
 Œ are affected by excess liquidity, which can significantly change 
supply and demand dynamics in the mar
ket for central bank reserves, thereby 
distorting their signalling effect. Between
 2014 and 2016, for example, the rise in 
excess liquidity was accompanied by a decline in the share of cross
-border trading in 
the unsecured interbank money market (
see 
Chart
 2).
123 Seen in isolation, this could 
be (mis)interpreted as an increase in fragmentation, which conflicts with the signal 
emanating from the EURIBOR
-OIS spread.
                                                                                                                                                           120  See,

 121  The spread betwee
n the euro interbank offered rate (EURIBOR) and the overnight indexed swap (OIS) 
rate of the same maturity is an example of a measure widely used to gauge 
fragmentation 
in the 
unsecured interbank
 market. EURIBOR is a quoted rate for unsecured interbank ter
m deposits
, involving
 term, liquidity and credit risk premia. OIS rates are a proxy for risk
-free rates
, reflect
ing
 the 
expected path of monetary policy rates. The spread between these rates therefore measures various 
risk premi
a and is considered a proxy 
indicator for risk in the banking sector.
 122  The EURIBOR
-OIS spread reflects the perceived credit risk of prime banks. Hence, it may only signal 
stress when tensions in the money market are 
severe enough 
to affect prime banks
 as well
. 123  Increasing levels 
of excess liquidity reduce banks™ funding needs and dampen trading volumes 
generally. Cross
-border trading volumes in particular may decline as such transactions entail greater 
monitoring costs. At the same time, however, with substantial amounts of excess
 liquidity distributed to 
entities without access to the ECB™s deposit facility, the share of cross
-border volumes can increase 
(e.g.
 in 2017) as these entities deposit euro reserves with banks located in the euro area.

ring indicators based on all money market transactions

to control for the impact of monetary policy can shed light on underlying 
fragmentation. The next section proposes a new indicator of fragmentation for the 
unsecured overnight interbank market that takes these
 factors into account.

 77 3 Fragmentation from a monetary policy transmission 
perspective: a new indicator based on unsecured overnight 
interbank transactions
 This section details the 
construction 
of a new indicator of money market 
fragmentation. It starts wi
th an overview of the theoretical underpinnings of the 
indicator, in particular the question of how unsecured short
-term rates are 
determined in a corridor system under different liquidity conditions. It then explains 
the steps needed to build the indicato
r.
 3.1
 Rate formation in a corridor system and the impact of excess 
liquidity on market rates and volumes
 Rate formation in the unsecured overnight interbank money market is a 
function of the ECB™s key policy rates and the quantity of reserves provided by 
the central bank.
 Under balanced liquidity conditions, whereby central bank liquidity 
provision is calibrated to fulfil the liquidity needs of the banking sector arising from 
reserve requirements and autonomous factors, overnight rates in the unsecured 
int
erbank money market are anchored to the main refinancing operations (MRO) 
rate. The rates on the standing facilities
 Œ the marginal lending facility and the 
deposit facility
 Œ provide a corridor around the MRO rate and serve as a ceiling and a 
floor
 for ra
tes in the unsecured overnight interbank money market (assuming both 
counterparties in the trade have access to these facilities).
 The position of rates within the corridor, as well as transaction volumes, 
depends on the level of reserves in the banking sy
stem.
 When liquidity 
conditions are neutral, the central bank provides just enough reserves to meet the 
needs of the banking sector at a rate linked to the MRO rate.
124 Hence, the end
-of-day marginal value of reserves is 
equal to 
the MRO rate (assuming no fr
agmentation 
in the market). 
In general
, the end
-of-day marginal value is a weighted average of 
the rates on the marginal lending and deposit facilities, whereby the weights are a 
function of the probability of taking recourse to either facility (
see 
Chart
 3). In the 
context of full allotment tender procedures and the asset purchase programme 
(APP), the level of reserves provided by the Eurosystem has greatly exceeded the 
liquidity needs of the banking system over recent years. This has resulted in high 
leve
ls of excess liquidity, which has reduced trading volumes and made the deposit 
facility rate (DFR) the effective anchor for market rates
 (as the probability of end
-of-day recourse to the deposit facility has effectively increased to one)
.125                                                                     124  Under variable rate tender proced
ures, the MRO rate is a minimum bid rate for participation in 
Eurosystem liquidity
-providing repurchase operations. Under fixed rate tender procedures with full 
allotment, the MRO rate is the actual rate at which banks participate in these operations.
 125  The standing facilities corridor can reduce transaction volumes by curtailing the range of rates that can 
prevail in the market. If credit risk premia rise substantially so as to push market rates outside of the 
corridor, banks will use the standing facilit
ies rather than trade in the interbank market (assuming they 
have sufficient collateral and are not concerned about possible stigma effects of using central bank 
facilities). For further discussion of rate formation in a corridor system, see Bindseil, U.,

-axis: unsecured overnight interbank rate)
  Notes: This is a stylised chart illustrating a
 symmetrical standing facilities corridor. The same broad concepts apply to an asymmetrical 
corridor. MLF, MRO and DFR stand for the rates that apply to the marginal lending facility, the main refinancing operations a
nd the 
deposit facility, respectively. 
To the left of the grey line, there is a shortage of reserves in the banking sector; to the right of the grey 
line, there is excess liquidity (i.e.
 a surplus of reserves).
 The distribution of central bank reserves in itself is not an indicator of 
fragmenta
tion.
 As discussed in Eisenschmidt et al., the financial structure of the 
euro area 
has led to 
excess liquidity accumulat
ing
 in particular locations during the 
period of the APP.
126 This concentration of excess liquidity is not necessarily 
indicative of frag
mentation. Assuming risk neutrality, arbitrage ensures that rates in 
the unsecured overnight interbank market are equilibrated across banks, and 
thereby across countries, within the euro area. The extent to which arbitrage 
opportunities exist and are not e
xploited, however, does convey information on 
fragmentation. This concept is the basis for the discussion in Section
 3.2.
 3.2
 Construction of the
 new indicator
 Full fungibility of central bank reserves across borders implies that the rate 
paid by any bank 
to borrow reserves in the unsecured overnight market 
should be a function of the aggregate, rather than domestic, level of excess 
liquidity.
127 The blue line in Chart
 4 presents a stylised illustration of the relationship 
between the weighted average euro ar
ea overnight rate in the unsecured interbank 
                                                                    126  See Eisenschmidt, J., Kedan, D., Schmitz, M., Adalid, R. and Papsdorf, P.

es

 127  The implication of full fungibility does not stop at borders. In principle, full fungibility (or no 
fragmentation) implies that interbank rates should be correlated with aggregate excess liquidity levels 
and not with excess liquid
ity levels pertaining to smaller subsets of banks, like those located in the 
same country. Data availability and the nature of fragmentation, which often affects cross
-border 
trades, have driven the focus of this analysis on the country dimension of fragme
ntation by comparing 
rates implied by country
-level excess liquidity with rates implied by aggregate excess liquidity.

 Measuring frag
mentation in the euro area unsecured overnight interbank money market:
 a monetary policy transmission approach
 81 In order to translate the monetary policy transmission
-based definition of 
fragmentation into an indicator, it is necessary to establish the aggregate 
interest rate spreads against the DFR that would be 
expected to prevail in a 
non-fragmented market for every level of aggregate excess liquidity 
(i.e.
 threshold spreads).
 This exercise should be based on transactions of entities 
that have access to the E
urosystem
™s standing facilities (i.e.
 euro area banks)
 and on 
rates that are adjusted for counterparty credit risk in order to isolate rate differentials 
attributable to fragmentation from those owing to technical and fundamental factors. 
The relationship between excess liquidity and money market rates is in 
itself a 
function of the state of fragmentation.
129 Therefore, the thresholds should ideally be 
derived from pre
-crisis data, when money markets were perceived as being 
completely non
-fragmented. This is not possible for two reasons: first, transaction
-level
 data for the interbank overnight money market are not available for the period 
prior to the go
-live date of TARGET2 in May
 2008; and second, levels of excess 
liquidity were minimal prior to the crisis.
130 Historical risk
-adjusted unsecured overnight interba
nk transaction data for 
euro area banks during periods of relatively low market stress since 2008 are 
used to derive threshold spreads against which the current level of 
fragmentation can be benchmarked.
 First, unsecured overnight interbank 
borrowing rates
 derived from TARGET2 payment system data
131 are adjusted for 
counterparty credit risk.
132 Second, the sampling period is chosen by
 finding a 
compromise between having
 sufficient variation in the level of excess liquidity 
on the 
one hand 
and ensuring that the 
period represents relatively benign money market 
conditions
 on the other
.133 Third, a regression spline is fitted to the relationship 
between aggregate risk
-adjusted rate spreads against the DFR and aggregate 
excess liquidity over these time periods. Finally
, the threshold spreads are obtained 
by using the 95% tolerance interval corresponding to the estimated regression spline 
(see 
Chart
 7).

 2016 onwards, data

be used to complement the rates derived from TARGET2 payment system data. If a 
country™s volume

-adjusted average rate exceeds the threshold level 
corresponding to the aggregate level of excess liqui
dity prevailing in a given month, 
the country™s banking sector is classified as having impaired market access in that 
month. Countries are then weighted by their share of the sum of banking sector 
assets across the sample of countries. Hence, countries wit
h larger banking sectors 
are given more weight. The resulting fragmentation indicator estimates the share of 
euro area banking sectors with impaired access to the unsecured overnight 
interbank market 
at country level 
(see

 4 Development and properties of the new indicator
 Compared to the periods of relatively lo
w financial market stress from mid
-2008 to mid
-2013, fragmentation seen through the lens of reserve tradability is 
estimated to also have been low at the end of 2017.
 Fragmentation peaked in late 
2008 following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, when 
banks
 in 
all euro area 
countries were estimated to have had impaired market access (
see 
Chart
 8). By 
around mid
-2009, however, 
banks in 
all those countries appeared to have regained 
full access to market funding based on the interest rates prevailing in 
domestic 
money markets at that time. Fragmentation rose again in the spring of 2010 as the 
sovereign debt crisis began, and increased sharply by late 2011 as the crisis 
intensified. As aggregate excess liquidity increased following the allotment of the 
thr
ee-year longer
-term refinancing operations (LTROs) in December
 2011 and 
February
 2012, unsecured overnight interbank rates across countries declined. 
However, the fragmentation measure increased through mid
-2014 due to a reduction 
in excess liquidity and g
rowing uncertainty about its path from late 2013 onwards 
owing to early repayments in the three
-year LTROs, as well as some repricing in the 
money market against the background of the comprehensive assessment. It also 
remained somewhat elevated in the mont
hs following the introduction of negative 
rates on the DFR, as banks were initially reluctant to trade at negative interest rates, 
resulting in higher money market rates; the full pass
-through of negative policy rates 
only materialised in early 2015. A dec
line in the level of fragmentation followed the 
cessation in June
 2014 of the liquidity

 Measuring fragmentation in the euro area unsecured overnight interbank money market:
 a monetary policy transmission approach
 84 aimed at expanding the Eurosystem balance s
heet. Some fragmentation remained in 
2017, albeit at relatively low levels.
 The new fragmentation indicator complements existing measures by better 
controlling for the degree of prevailing monetary policy support and generally 
offering a more nuanced view 
of fragmentation.
 The indicator is benchmarked 
against the observed relationship between unsecured overnight rates and excess 
liquidity during periods of low money market stress. This exercise helps to control for 
the endogeneity between the level of fragm
entation and monetary policy 
accommodation as higher fragmentation
 has typically coincided with higher levels of 
excess liquidity, but also with a change in the relationship between overnight rates 
and excess liquidity. Furthermore, the indicator is based 
on all money market 
transactions in a given period rather than on market quotes or a subset of trades. It 
is also constructed from data on rates and volumes, thus reflecting price and quantity 
dimensions of fragmentation.
 As with any other indicator, howev
er, the new fragmentation measure has its 
limitations and should be considered alongside a range of fragmentation 
measures.
 Ideally, the indicator would control for the width of the interest rate 
corridor as, all else being equal, rate spreads against the 
DFR should be lower for a 
given level of fragmentation the narrower the corridor. However, there is not enough 
variation over time in the width of the corridor at different
 levels of excess liquidity to 
reliably estimate adjustment coefficients. 
In any cas
e, w
ith high levels of excess 
liquidity, the analysis indicates that the elasticity of market rates to changes in the 
corridor width is minimal. Hence, it is only necessary to take into account the corridor 
width when interpreting the indicator when the ag
gregate level of excess liquidity is 
much lower than at the end of 2017.
 Another caveat of the indicator is that it is based on a panel of banks that 
changes over time and cannot capture trades that did not take place because 
of fragmentation.
 The changing
 panel implies that an observed increase in 
measured fragmentation could be caused by (a)
 deteriorated trading conditions for 
the same banks or (b)
 changes in the composition of the panel. 
Furthermore, 
changes in the composition of the panel could be due t
o new banks joining 
the panel 
or existing banks leaving the panel
, or both
. The potentially changing composition of 
the panel highlights the risk of a sampling bias because the indicator does not take 
into account money market trading that is not observed.
 At the extreme, the indicator 
will substantially underestimate the true level of fragmentation when the panel of 
trading banks is exclusively made up of banks with good market access because the 
stressed banks, with counterfactually impaired market access
, are not active any 
more. When banks regain market access, probably at higher rates, the indicator will 
overestimate fragmentation. If, intentionally or not, certain monetary policy measures 
work through disintermediation, this problem could become larger
. To overcome this

 85 limitation, it is necessary to model banks™ participation in the market. This would 
facilitate an adjustment in the indicator based exclusively on observed rates.
134 The new indicator sends a message that is broadly comparable to the 
EURIB
OR-OIS spread but is more precise in tracking 
times
 of market 
adjustment, like the period leading up to the comprehensive assessment of 
euro area banks (see Chart
 9).
 The indicator does a good job of tracking the 
periods of high stress during the Lehman Br
others episode and the euro area 
sovereign debt crisis. Remarkably, in contrast to the EURIBOR
-OIS spread, it puts 
the stress levels at the end of 2011 on a par with those experienced after the 
collapse of Lehman Brothers. This difference could be attribut
able to the prevailing 
degree of policy support that arguably affects the EURIBOR
-OIS spread more than 
the new indicator. The episode around the comprehensive assessment (late 2013 to 
late 2014) is signalled as a period of money market fragmentation, which
 is a 
plausible finding although the underlying reason for the fragmentation is largely 
unrelated to financial market stress. Finally, the indicator points to low levels of 
fragmentation in 2017, in line with the signal given by the EURIBOR
-OIS spread.

fragmentation due to banks joining the market at higher rates that had previously been excluded due to 
their risk
 profile. If the indicator increases because of banks joining, overall volumes should increase 
and central bank intermediation should decrease.

 Private c

 86 3 Private consumption and its drivers in the current 
economic expansion
 Prepared by Maarten Dossche, Magnus Forsells, Luca Rossi and 
Grig
or Stoevsky
 This article
 documents 
the key role that
 private consumption has 
played in 
recent 
output growth
 (2013-18), and asks how long the current growth in consumption can 
continue and whether it is self
-sustaining. To that end, this article tries to id
entify
 the 
relative importance of different factors
 driving consumption,
 such as the recovery in 
the labour market, accommodative monetary policy, the 2014
-15 drop in oil prices, 
the increase in asset prices, the easing of credit conditions 
and deleveragin
g. 
As the 
fall in consumption from 2008 to 2013 was very heterogeneous across countries, this 
article also sheds light on the extent to which the current expansion has actually led 
to a net increase in consumption
 over the past decade. This is relevant bec
ause 
private consumption is also a prime indicator of the economic well
-being of 
households.
 While 
the 
growth of consumption has been low compared 
with
 previous expansions, 
since 2013 it has exceed
ed initial expectations. 
It
 has been driven 
mainly
 by the 
recovery in the labour market, even 
though
 unemployment in some countries and for 
some groups of workers remains higher than before 
2008. Looking forward, as 
labour markets continue to improve, private consump
tion should expand further in all 
count
ries and for all groups of workers
. Through its impact on the labour market, the 
ECB™s accommodative monetary policy 
is not only 
contribut
ing
 to the expansion of 
private consumption
, but also to a decrease in inequality
. At the same time, there is 
little e
vidence that low interest rates have led to generalised increases in household 
indebtedness, supporting the sustainability of the 
overall 
economic expansion.
 1 Introduction
 Euro area private consumption has played a significant role in the 
current
 economic
 expansion
 since its start in 2013
. In some euro area countries the initial 
increase in private consumption was even stronger than the increase in 
investment
, 
although that is typically the fastest
-growing demand component during an economic 
expansion
. 
Fiv
e years into the current expansion, the question is how long the 
current pace of consumption growth can continue. For an assessment of the
 current 
euro area economic outlook
 it 
is therefore 
essential to 
uncover
 the drivers 
of the 
recent expansion 
in privat
e consumption.
 The analytical approach in this article has been influenced by the lessons from 
the financial crisis.
 It has long been recognised that 
certain aspects of the data are 
at odds with

led to several extensions of the theory of consumption (including 
income uncertainty
 and liquidity constraints) stressing the importance of

characteristics
.136 The 
importance of 
this was further demonstrated by economic 
developments during and after the Great Recession. This article therefore presents 
evidence on the drivers of private consumption both from an aggregate and a 
disaggregate perspe
ctive, including the interaction with income and wealth 
inequality. In addition, the country
-specific macroeconomic environment, in particular 
through conditions in labour and housing markets, has greatly affected private 
consumption dynamics across countr
ies
 in the euro area
. T

is therefore

 2 Consumption in the ongoing economic expan
sion
 2.1
 A consumption
-led economic expansion?
 Since the beginning of the current economic expansion in 2013, growth has 
been driven mainly by private consumption.
 As private 
consumption is the
 biggest expenditure component, this may 
be considered 
normal
; 
in 2017 private 
consumption accounted for about 55% of 
gross domestic product (
GDP
). However, it 
stands in stark contrast 
to
 the 2009
-11 recovery, whe
re on average 
only
 about 
10% of euro area 
GDP growt
h was driven by private consumption (see Chart
 1).137 This 
observation is not confined to the euro area only. In the recent economic expansion 
many industrialised countries have witnessed strong consumption dynamics, often 
with consumption growth exceeding that of investment.

 Private consumption and its drivers in the curr
ent economic expansion
 89 From a historical perspective, the 
expansion in private consumption has 
nevertheless remained weak.
 In fact, the current expansion in private consumption 
is among the weakest since the 1970s (see Chart
 3).
139 However, the recent 
expansion in GDP has also been among the slowest on record. This
 observation is 
again not confined to the euro area only. Most industrialised countries have 
witnessed GDP growth below that of previous expansions.
140 This raises the 
question as to how much factors specific to the household sector (e.g.
 income and 
wealth d
evelopments, or borrowing constraints) have dampened the expansion in 
private consumption. In other words, has consumer spending that is 
conditional
 on household income and wealth been exceptionally weak during the past five years?

path, similar to that developed in Pistaferri, based on an estimated relationship

 consumption and household income and wealth

141 The two textbook determinants of private consumption, household 
income and wealth, seem to explain the largest part of consumption growth since 
2013. Only during the period of the Great Recession 
and the sovereign debt crisis 
was private consumption lower than this simple relationship with income and wealth 
would suggest. Since 2013 private consumption has recovered strongly; since mid
-2016 it stands even higher than the estimated pre

 2.2 Consumption across countries
 Consumption growth has been broad

 since 2013, but 
the losses from the financial crisis have not been recouped
 everywhere.
 While 
some 
large euro area 
countries experience
d strong declines in consumption as a 
result of the 
Great Recession and the sovereign debt crisis (e.g.
 Italy and Spain)
, 
other countries
 (e.g.
 Germany and France
) have been much
 less affected
 (se
e Chart
 5). 
Ten years after the start of the Great Recession private consumption in 
Germany and France stand
s about 10% higher than before it began. By contrast, 
consumption in Italy and Spain has not yet recovered completely. 
Since
 2013, 
however, all coun
tries have been on a clear
ly expansionary path

experienced the deepest downturn, has show

 Consumption across product categories
 Household spending on durable goods is the part of private consumption that
 is most sensitive to the business cycle.
 Durable goods typically have an expected 
lifetime of more than three years, whereas 
semi
-durables and 
non-durables
 have a 
much 
shorter lifetime. Households do not derive utility directly from spending on 
durable goods in the current period, but rather from
 the flow of services they provide 
over their lifetime. Households may decrease these purchases when their income is 
low, with a relatively small reduction in their utility, postponing them until periods 
when their income recovers. 
As a result, 
the 
consump
tion of durable goods
 varies 
more over 
the business cycle.
142 Consumption of durables ha
s recovered to ﬁnormalﬂ levels.
 An important factor 
supporting
 recent
 durable goods consumption has been pent
-up demand
. T
he sharp 
drop in durable goods consumption durin
g the crisis resulted in a decline
 in the 
effective stock of durables and a commensurate increase in its average age.
143 In 
the 
countries that were more affected by the financial crisis the average age of the 
stock of durable goods
 also
 increased more
, which
 gave rise to pent
-up demand as 
soon as economic
 conditions improved.
144 As the economic recovery progressed, 
households 
were
 able to increase spending on durable goods and offset earlier 
declines
 in their
 stock of durables. 
Since
 2015, however,
 the 
positive
 impact of 
                                                                    142  See

 92 pent-up demand for durables has
 been declining. Following a long catch

for private consumption, this can be regarded as a
 normalisation
 (see Chart
 6). Chart

. Note: The data point for 2017 has been computed using available data on real disposable income and consumption together with 
the 
historical income elasticity of durable goods.
 The c
onsumption of necessities
, which provide for
 basic human needs
, suggests that there is more room for consumer spending to recover
. Private 
consumption can also be split into necessities (e.g.
 food, health care
 and rent) and 
non-necessities (
e.g.
 electric
al appliances, holidays
 and restaurant visits)
, which 
each make up roughly 50% of total euro area private consumption. When 
households absorb a negative income shock
, they mainly adjust their consumption of 
non-necessities.
 As a result, non
-necessities have a higher income elasticity than 
necessities.
 However, in the long run both components of consumption can be 
expected to grow at a similar pace.
145 Chart
 7 therefore suggests that as
 household
 income keeps rising, the 
consumption of 
non-necessit
ies
 should further support total 
consumption. Put differen
tly, the breakdown between necessities and 
non-necessities suggest
s that the cyclical recovery in euro area consumption can 
still be expected to last for some time.
146                                                                     145  This is confirmed by evidence 
from France and F
inland in the 1980s and 1990s
 Œ for which longer time 
series are available
 Œ that shows 
that 
as the economy recovers
, the path of these two components of 
private consumption converge
s again.

 1   Income and wealth effects on euro area private consumption
 Prepared by Gabe de Bondt, Arne Gieseck and Zivile Zekaite
 This box reports empirical estimates of income and wealth effects on private consumption in 
the eur
o area since 1999.
 It follows 
a so
-called thick modelling approach that considers a 
multiplicity of model specifications rather than a single ﬁbestﬂ one. 
Thick modelling considers the 
uncertainty stemming from both 
model specifications and 
unstable paramet
ers
.147 It
 is particularly 
useful for empirical applications using a short sample
 of ﬁtrueﬂ euro area data that starts in 1999,
 where model
 and parameter
 uncertainty 
are
 expected to 
matter
. The thick modelling 
keeps those 
model specifications that 
reliably 
explain (in
-sample) and forecast (out
-of-sample) 
quarter
-on-quarter growth of 
private consumption and 
have a solid 
theoretical 
basis
.148 It 
uses standard 
determinants from the consumption literature, distinguishing between long
-run
 and short
-run drivers 
of co
nsumption
. In the long run d
isposable income and wealth determine 
private 
consumption
, 
assuming unit elasticity of total income and wealth combined. This assumption implies that 
consumer spending moves one
-to
-one with income and wealth
 in the long 
term. In the short run, 
besides income and wealth 
a rich set of 
other potential 
determinants 
is considered, such as i
nterest 
rates, indebtedness, uncertainty and demographics
. In the long run, income has been the key driver of private consumption in the eu
ro area 
since 1999
. The estimated long
-run elasticit
ies
 of labour income 
are
 greater than 
those
 of 
non-labour income (alternatively, property and transfer income)
: typically
 they are 
about twice as 
                                                                    147  See Granger, C.W. and Jeon, Y., ﬁThick modellingﬂ,

 The differences are smaller in terms of 
the proportio
n of additional income that an individual 
consumes
, referred to as 
the marginal propensity to consume
 (MPC)
. 
The MPC 
out of labour 
income
 has been
 somewhat higher 
than the MPC out
 of non
-labour income
 (see Table
 A). For
 wealth components, the average long
-run elasticity of financial wealth is found to be four to five 
times larger than that of non
-financial wealth. The average 
MPC
 out of financial wealth is found to 
be around 1
 cent and 
out of 
non-financial wealth 
0.1
 cent.
 The estimated 
wealth effects 
are s
imilar 
to those reported in 
the literature for the euro area.
149 In 
the 
short run, labour income plays a bigger role 
in consumption growth than the other 
types of income.
 In the short run t
he estimated elasticity range
s are lower than those for the long 
run and 
var
y between 0.1 and 0.3 for
 both
 labour a
nd n
on-labour income. A similar range 
results 
for 
the second definition 
of 
labour income, whereas property and transfer income play a smaller role 
in consumption growth in 
the short run. 
For
 short
-run wealth effects, 
the estimated elasticity range of
 financial wealth 
is smaller 
than 
that
 of non-financial wealth
. This is in contrast to the long
-run 
estimates, which show a larger impact for financial wealth than for non
-financ
ial wealth. This finding 
may be explained 
by 
the fact that 
financial asset prices 
are more
 volatile in the short run 
than
 house 
prices
. Households may 
perceive financial wealth fluctuations as being 
less persistent
 with the 
result that they

 Private consumption and its drivers in the current economic expansion
 95 3 Developments in household income
 Private consumption growth has closely followed growth in household 
income.
 This section sheds more light on the d
rivers of household income and their 
implications for overall spending on consumer goods. Chart
 8 shows that in the
 early 
years of the 
expansion
 (2014
-15), real disposable income was strongly supported by 
improvement in the terms of trade as a result of th
e fall in oil prices.
 At the same 
time, the c
ompensation 
of employee
s gradually
 became the main driver of 
households™ real disposable income. This stands in stark contrast to the contribution 
of property and mixed income, or
 the income households receive f
rom holding 
assets, which has remained almost unchanged since 2010. As the economic 
expansion progressed, the 
contribution of taxes and transfers bec
ame 
somewhat 
more negative
 in 2017.
 In good times automatic fiscal stabilisers 
tend to have a 
dampen
ing effect on 
the gr
owth of real disposable income.

All income components are deflated with the GDP deflator. The contribution from the ter

between
 the GDP and consumption deflator

 Labour income
 Despite broad
-based increases, labour income in some countries remai
ns 
significantly below its pre
-2008 level
. With an increase in the number of employed 
persons of around eight million since 2013, the current recovery in the euro area 
labour market has been remarkable.
150 However, these aggregate numbers conceal 
large diffe
rences. For example, in Italy and Spain real compensation of employees 
remains significantly lower than before the crisis (see Chart
 9), on account of both

-induced wage moderation and unemployment remaining elevated. Moreover, 
strong employment grow
th also reflects increased labour market participation among 
older as well as female workers. As t
he unemployment rate in some countries has 
not yet returned to pre
-crisis levels
, unemployment risk is still dampening 
consumption growth to some extent.
 Desp
ite the strong consumption growth since 
2013, this is clearly an important reason why, in these countries, private consumption 
has not yet recovered to its pre

 While 
the recovery in the lab

past few years, a significant share of the population

of income r

Chart

higher skilled workers (see also Box

consumers tend to respond more 
strongly to negative than to positive income shocks; see Christelis, D.,

quivalised disposable income is the total income of a household, after tax and other deductions, that is available for spendi
ng 
or saving, divided by the number of household members converted into equ
alised adults; household members are made equivalent by 
weighting each according to their age
. Falling
 unemployment should continue to support aggregate consumption 
growth.
 Households 
in the 
lower part
 of the income distribution (i.e.
 mostly low
er 
skilled 
and/or younger
 workers
) typically have a 
higher propensity to consume (see 
Chart
 11)
. 
As the recovery in the labour market also reaches these households, 
aggregate consumer spending should receive additional impetus and continue to 
contribute to a low aggr
egate saving ratio (see Section
 4.2). In addition
, as the 
likelihood 
of becom
ing
 unemployed decreases also for low
-skilled
 workers who
 are 
already employed, 
the available 
evidence
 suggests that the
y should also increase 
their consumption.
153 A lower unemploy
ment rate not only increases income for 
those that find a job, but also increases 
the 
expected future income of those 
who
 are 
already employed (and face lower unemployment risk). All in all, this suggests that 
as long as the recovery in the labour market r
emains on track the underlying growth 
momentum of private consumption 
can be expected to continue.

 Property 
income
 Property income has remained weak since 2013, but the impact on private 
consumption growth seems limited.
 Together with the fall in economic activity and 
corporate profitability, property income and mixed income from self
-employment has 
fallen signi
ficantly since 2008. This is a normal phenomenon, as profits are strongly 
procyclical. It is also in line with evidence that income risk across the business cycle 
is concentrated in the left and the right tails of the income distribution.
154 Poorer 
household
s experience larger drops in income from job losses (see previous 
section), while richer households experience larger drops in property income. This is 
because aggregate asset holdings are concentrated at the top of the wealth 
distribution (see Chart
 16). 
In 2013 real mixed income (gross operating surplus) 
started to increase again, but most other components of property income have 
remained subdued (see Chart
 12). Firms have not yet started to distribute more 
profits to their shareholders. As richer househo
lds also tend to have a higher 
average saving ratio (see Chart
 11), the dampening effect on private consumption 
may have been contained (see also Box
 1).
155 Strong growth of labour income and 
weak growth of property income is also consistent with a subdued a
ggregate 
household saving ratio.

)  Sources: 
Eurostat
 and ECB calculations.
 Despite exceptionally low interest rates, house
hold net interest income has 
hardly been affected.
156 While interest earnings declined
 significantly
, interest 
payments have also decreased considerably. 
Between the third quarter of 2008 and 
the 
fourth
 quarter of 201
7 interest payments fell by about 
three 
percentage points 
relative to disposable income. The drop in interest earnings 
has been
 comparable to 
the drop in interest payments, 
meaning
 that the average euro area household™s net 
interest income has been largely unaffected. 
Lower interest rates have ma
inly 
redistributed resources from net savers to net borrowers. As net borrowers typically 
have a higher propensity to consume than net savers, this redistribution channel of 
lower interest rates supports aggregate consumption.
157 The n
et interest income of 
the household sector has remained fairly stable in 
Germany and France, but less so in Italy and Spain.
 Evidence from the sectoral 
accounts (see 
Chart
 13) shows that in Germany and France the drop in interest 
earnings and payments 
has been
 comparable, meani
ng that lower interest rates 
have had a minimal effect on the net interest income of the household sector as a 
whole. Conversely, in Italy, the drop in household interest earnings 
has been
 much 
larger, as 
Italian households hold a relatively large amount o
f interest
-bearing assets, 
whereas they are relatively less indebted. In Spain, the drop in interest payments 
has been
 significantly larger tha
n the fall in interest earnings
. The larger decline in 
interest payments in Spain is explained by both the high s
tock of household debt
 (see Section
 4) and the fact that 
a large share of mortgages have adjustable interest 
rates. This is an important factor in the transmission of monetary policy to private 
                                                                    156  See

 The 2014
-15 drop
 in oil pric
es In 
2014-15 l
ower energy prices contributed
 significantly
 to 
the expansion in 
private consumption.
 It was also in this period that professional forecasters made 
the largest upward revisions to their consumption growth forecasts (see Chart
 2). 
The overall
 decline in oil prices since the second half of 2014 has provided 
households with a windfall gain. Typically, from a
 historical
 perspective, consumption 
reacts with a lag to changes in oil prices.
 A model
-based forecast in the spirit of 
Edelstein and Kilian suggests that in 
2014-15 private 
consumption reacted more 
quickly to the oil price decline than 
it had 
in previous episodes of falling oil prices
 (see Chart
 14).159 This is also evidenced 
by the r
elatively muted response of the 
household saving ratio to the windfall gain. 
Since
 2016 the support from lower oil 
prices for consumption growth 
has faded. Going forward, the latest oil price increase 
between mid
-2017 and mid
-2018 is expected to dampen con
sumer spending
 somewhat.

 4 Developments in household wealth and debt
 The strength of the household sector™s balance sheet is a key determinant of 
private consumption.
 First, increases in household wealth make households richer 
and therefore also more inclin
ed to consume. This is the standard wealth effect (see 
also Box
 1).
160 Second, the strength of the household balance sheet also determines 
the availability of credit to households, and therefore their ability to smooth 
consumption over the business cycle. As
 balance sheets are typically weaker during 
recessions and stronger during expansions, there is a strong link between the 
strength of the balance sheet and consumption growth. This is the financial 
accelerator channel. Chart
 15 illustrates how banks™ credi
t standards have co
-moved 
with the growth of households™ net worth since 2003. Especially after periods of large 
increases in leverage, asset price falls can lead to large drops in net worth and 
generate significant deleveraging pressures that may persiste
ntly affect consumption 
dynamics.
161 This section provides more details about how changes in households™ 
assets and liabilities have affected recent consumption growth.

 4.1
 Household wealth
 House price changes can have significant accelerator effects on private 
consumption.
 The reason for this 
is that f
or most households the main residence is 
the
ir largest asset
 (see Chart
 16). 
Housing wealth also tends to be more evenly 
distributed than financial wealth, which is mainly held by the top quintile of the wealth 
distribution.
162 Moreover, housing is 
typically also an asset that is financed by debt 
(i.e.
 through leverage), so that house price changes can have even larger effects on 
households™ net worth. 
This may explain why
, over the business cycle, 
housing 
wealth is often found to be more important f
or private consumption than financial 
wealth, despite 
similar direct wealth effects
 (see also the short
-run elasticities 
reported in Box
 1).
163 As the euro area housing market is segmented across 
countries, cross
-country developments in housing wealth have b
een very 
heterogeneous.
                                                                     162  See

 4.2
 Household debt and saving
 Decreasing household indebtedness underscores the sustainability of the
 expansion in private consumption.
 It has been argued that the 
current economic 
expansion is less sustainable, as
 it is based on private consumption and the 
accumulation of new
 debt.164 This 
argument is
 mainly
 based on the presumption that 
consumption
-led re
coveries are always 
driven by an increase in household 
indebtedness. 
This does not apply to the current 
expansion
 in euro area 
consumption
. In contrast to the period before the crisis, 
steady 
euro area 
consumption growth has been coupled with a gradual dec
rease in household 
indebtedness, which in the euro area has now stabilised around its pre
-crisis level 
(see Chart
 18). Moreover, while certain countries have still seen some increases in 
household indebtedness towards the euro area average (e.g.
 France), c
ross
-country 
difference
s have significantly diminished on account of the strong decreases in those 
countries where the household sector was most indebted (e.g.
 Spain).
                                                                     164  See Kharroubi

 Private consumption and its drivers in the current economic expansion
 106 Since
 2013 household deleveraging has changed from ﬁactiveﬂ to ﬁpassiveﬂ, 
making the expansion in cons
umption more self
-sustaining.
 At the beginning of
 2013 the contribution of nominal disposable income to the change in the household 
debt ratio (as a percentage of gross disposable income) was still close to zero (see 
Chart
 20). Before the start of the curr
ent economic expansion, households™ real 
disposable income was still contracting and inflation falling. As lower asset valuations 
gave rise to deleveraging pressures, households had to repay loans and refrain from 
new borrowing (i.e.
 there was active delev
eraging). Once the economic expansion 
gained traction households™ nominal disposable income growth gradually 
accelerated, leading to further decreases in household indebtedness. H
igher nominal 
growth led to improvements in balance sheets and contribute
d to
 a self
-sustain
ing
 increase in spending and economic activity
 (i.e.
 passive deleveraging took place)
. 
Over the past few years, households have again been increasing their debt, although 
household indebtedness continued to fall
 relative to income. These 
higher debt flows 
reflected loans for house purchase as the recovery in the housing market gradually 
progressed, as well as higher demand for consumer credit as purchases of durable 
goods (e.g.
 cars) increased again.

 Private consumption and its drivers in the current economic expansion
 108 The APP has substantially reduced the unemployment rate in the lower part of the income 
distribution.
169 The 
upper chart above shows how the aggregate decline in the unemployment rate
 is distributed across various income groups of households. In particular, the chart displays the 
decrease in 
the 
unemployment rate across the five income quintiles, four quarters after the 
impact
 of the
 APP shock. The aggregate decline in 
the 
unemployment
 rate by about 0.7
 percentage point 
affects individuals very heterogeneously and is heavily skewed toward
s the 
households with 
incomes in 
the lowest 20%, whose unemployment rate falls by more than 2
 percentage points. 
By 
contrast,
 the unemployment rate in 
other income quintiles falls by less than 0.5
 percentage point. 
The key reason for this finding is that the level of unemployment is much higher in the lower parts of 
the income distribution.
 The decline in unemployment rates among households with lower in
comes reduces income 
inequality.
 Changes in unemployment rates substantially affect household income: 
incomes 
increase considerably as households start earning wage
s (instead of receiving unemployment 
benefits). Mean income in the lowest income quintile ri
ses by about 3%, while mean income in other 
parts of the distribution increases by about 0.5%. These changes reduce income inequality: 
the Gini 
coefficient, a common measure of inequality, is estimated to decline from 43.1% to 42.8%.
 The APP has modestly i
ncreased household net wealth across the wealth distribution.
 As 
shown in the 
lower
 panel of Chart
 A, the median net wealth among households in the lowest net 
wealth quintile increases by 2.5%, while in the other quintiles it rises by around 1%. House pric
es 
play a key role in these changes, as housing wealth makes up about 70
-80% of total
 household
 assets and this share is stable across the distribution (possibly with the exception of the very top 
tail). In addition, the response of stock prices is estimat
ed to be small and transitory. The increase in 
wealth among the lowest quintile is partly driven by the high leverage of these households. These 
changes only negligibly affect inequality in net wealth (as measured by the Gini coefficient).
 The developments
 in income and wealth 
are
 likely to affect consumer spending.
 A key 
factor
 determining how spending responds to changes in income is the 
MPC
, the response of spending 
to
 a transitory increase in income. Substantial empirical literature has documented that 
households 
with lower incomes and low liquid assets tend to 
act in a hand
-to
-mouth manner: they tend to 
be liquidity
 constrained and
 their consumption is highly sensitive to transitory changes in income. In the 
euro area almost 25% of households hold little liquid assets and live hand
-to
-mouth; these 
households have
 MPCs
 of around 0.3, while 
the remaining 
households with ample liquid a
ssets are 
well
 insured and have 
much 
lower MPCs, 
of 
around 0.1 or less.
 The response of aggregate consumption to monetary policy is disproportionately affected 
by constrained households.
 This happens for two reasons. First, as 
estimated
, incomes of 
househo
lds in the lower parts of the distribution are disproportionately stimulated by the APP.
 Second
, these households also tend to 
have substantially 
higher MPCs. The response of spending 
by these households is determined as a product of the two numbers and is
 consequently 
substantially stronger
 than that of
 households in the upper part of the distribution.

which is in turn dependent on their demographics (such as age, education, marital st
atus and the 
number of children they have). More specifically, we estimate a probit model with the employment 
status as the dependent variable, which captures some heterogeneity in the probability of employment 
across households. The model is then used to 
simulate which individuals become employed.

 Private consumption and its drivers in the current economic expansion
 109 employment and labour income, is stronger than 
the intertemporal substitution channel (which 
operates through households reducing saving and increasing spending following an interest rate 
cut). The indirect income channel accounts for around 80
-90% of the total effect of monetary policy 
on the spending
 of ﬁhand
-to
-mouthﬂ households and for a substantial part of the overall reaction of 
the remaining households. In the aggregate, the indirect channel makes up about 60% of the total 
effect. 
Finally, these calculations also imply that the
 APP compresses the
 distribution of consumer 
spending across households
, as the consumption of ﬁhand
-to
-mouthﬂ households is stimulated 
more strongly than that of well
-insured households
.  5 Conclusions
 Private consumption has been a main driver of the recent economic 
expans
ion, but there is still scope for further growth.
 In the euro area private 
consumption has clearly recovered from the losses during the financial crisis. While 
the growth of consumption has been low compared with previous expansions, since 
2013 it has exce
eded initial expectations. This has been largely driven by the 
recovery in the labour market, even though unemployment in some countries and for 
some groups of workers remains higher than before the financial crisis. 
Looking 
forward, as labour markets cont
inue to improve
, 
consumer confidence
 should remain 
elevated
 and private consumption should 
rise further (see 
Chart
 21). Chart

 The ECB™s accommodative monetary policy has contributed considerably to the 
expansion of private consumption.
 There is increasing evidence that monetary 
policy supports private consumption especially via financially constrained 
(e.g.
 unemployed or indebted) households. This highlights the role of heterogeneity in 
the transmission of monetary policy. At the same t
ime, accommodative monetary 
policies have also directly decreased income and wealth inequality. Finally, there is

 little evidence that low interest rates have led to generalised increases in household 
indebtedness, supporting the view that the overall econ
omic expansion is sustainable.
