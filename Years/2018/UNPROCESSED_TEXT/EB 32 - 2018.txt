 developments
 Overview
 At its monetary policy meeting on 13
 December, the Governing Council 
decided 
to end the net asset purchases in December 2018, while keeping the key ECB 
interest rates unchang
ed and enhancing the forward guidance on reinvestment
. While incoming information has been weaker than expected, reflecting softer external 
demand but also some country and sector
-specific factors, the underlying strength of 
domestic demand continues to un
derpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising
 inflation pressures. This supports 
the Governing Council™s 
confidence that the 
sustained convergence of inflation to 
its
 aim will proceed and will be maintained even 
after the end of 
the
 net asset purchases. At the same time, uncertainties related to 
geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets 
and financial market volatility remain prominent. 
Therefore, s
ignificant monetary policy 
stimulus is sti
ll needed to support the further build
-up of domestic price pressures and 
headline inflation developments over the medium term.
 The Governing Council™s
 forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the 
sizeable stock of
 acquired assets, continues to provide the necessary degree of 
monetary accommodation for the sustained convergence of inflation to 
its
 aim. In any 
event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as 
appropriate, to ensure that i
nflation continues to move towards 
its
 inflation aim in a 
sustained manner.
 Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 
13 December 2018
 While global economic activity has remained resilient, 
it
 has become more 
uneven a
nd signs of moderating momentum are emerging.
 The maturing global 
economic cycle, waning policy support across advanced economies and t
he impact of 
tariffs between the United States and China ar
e weighing on global activity. 
Global 
trade growth has deceler
ated somewhat, and uncertainties about fut
ure trade 
relations have risen. 
At the same time, financial conditions remain acco
mmodative in 
advanced economies, whereas 
they have tightened for some emerging markets. 
Looking ahead, global economic activity is e
xpected to decelerate in 2019 and remain 
steady
 thereafter
. Global inflationary pressures are expected to rise slowly as spare 
capacity diminishes.
 Long-term risk
-free rates have declined in the context of heightened 
geopolitical uncertainty and a perceive
d deterioration in the macroeconomic 
outlook since the Governing Council™s meeting in September
 2018. Euro area 
sovereign bond spreads have been largely stable, with the exception of those f
or 
Italy
, which have exhibited considerable volatility. Although c
orporate earnings expectations 
remain robust, some downward revisions, in addition to a repricing of risk, have led to

 equity and bond prices of euro area corporations. In foreign exchange markets, 
the euro has broadly weakened in trade
-weighted term
s. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 
2018, following growth of 0.4% in the previous two quarters
. The latest data and 
survey results have been weaker than expected, reflecting a diminishing contribution 
from 
external demand and some country and sector
-specific factors.
 While some of 
these factors are likely to unwind, this may suggest some slower growth momentum 
ahead. At the same time, domestic demand, also backed by 
the Governing Council™s
 accommodative mone
tary policy stance, continues to underpin the economic 
expansion in the euro area. The strength of the labour market, as reflected in ongoing 
employment gains and rising wages, still supports private consumption. Moreover, 
business investment is benefiting
 from domestic demand, favourable financing 
conditions and improving balance sheets. Residential investment remains robust. In 
addition, the expansion in global activity is still expected to continue, supporting euro 
area exports, although at a slower pace
. This assessment is broadly reflected in the December
 2018 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area.
 These projections foresee annual 
real GDP increasing by 1.9% in 2018, 1.7% in 2019, 1.7% in
 2020 and 1.5% in 2021. 
Compared with the S
eptember
 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the 
outlook for real GDP growth has been revised slightly down in 2018 and 2019. The 
risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly 
balanced. However, the balance of risks 
is moving to the downside owing to the 
persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, 
vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market vo
latility.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual 
HICP inflation declined 
to 2.0% in November
 2018, from 2.2% in October.
 On the b
asis of current futures 
prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decrease over the coming months. 
Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but domestic c
ost pressures 
are continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and 
tightening labour markets, which is pushing up wage growth. Looking ahead, 
underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by 
the ECB™s
 monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic ex
pansion and rising wage 
growth.
 This assessment is also broadly reflected in the December
 2018 Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, 
which foresee annual HICP 
inflation at 
1.8% in 2018, 1.6% in 2019
, 1.7% in 2020 and 1.8% in 2021.
 Compared 
with the September
 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, th
e outlook for HICP 
inflation has been revised slightly
 up for 2018 and down for 2019. 
HICP inflation 
excluding energy and f
ood is expected to rise from 1.0% in 2018 to 1.4% in 2019, 
1.6% in 2020 and 1.8
% in 20
21. 
 Broad money

asset purchases under

  4 growth, albeit with some signs of slowing down, mainly for loans to non
-financial 
corporations. At the same time, ban
k funding and lending conditions 
have 
remained 
very favourable. 
The pass
-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since 
June
 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and 
households, access to financing 
Œ in particu
lar for small and medium
-sized enterprises 
Œ and credit flows across the euro area.
 The euro area general government budget deficit is projected to have declined 
significantly in 2018 but to increase somewhat next year.
 The fall in 2018 was 
mainly the resu
lt of favourable cyclical conditions and declining interest payments. 
The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is expected to be broadly neutral in 
2018, to loosen in 2019 and 2020, and
 to turn neutral again in 2021.
 Monetary policy decisions
 Based on
 the regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council 
made the following decisions.
 The Governing Council 
decided to keep the ke
y ECB 
interest rates unchanged and 
continue
s to expect them to remain at their present 
levels at least through the 
summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary 
to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but 
close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding
 non-standard monetary policy 
measures, 
the Governing Council 
decided that
 net purchases under the asset 
purchase programme (APP) will end in December
 2018. At the same time, 
the 
Governing Council
 enhanced
 its 
forward guidance on reinvestment. Accordingly, 
the 
Governing Council
 intend
s to continue reinvesting, in ful
l, the principal payments from 
maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the 
date when 
the Governing Council
 start
s raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any 
case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable li
quidity conditions and an ample 
degree of monetary accommodation.

  5 1 External environment
 While global 
economic 
activity has remained resilient, 
it has become more uneven and 
signs of moderating momentum are emerging. The maturing global economic cycle, 
wan
ing policy support across advanced economies and the impact of tariffs between 
the United States and China 
are 
weigh
ing
 on global activity. At the same time, financial 
conditions remain accommodative in advanced economies
, while they have 
remained 
tight fo
r some emerging markets. Global trade growth has decelerated somewhat
, and 
uncertainties about future trad
e relations have risen. Looking ahead, global economic 
activity is expected to decelerate in 2019 and 
be steady 
over the following two years
, 
as polic
y support gradually diminishes and China transition
s to a lower growth path. 
Global inflationary pressures are expected to rise slowly as spare capacity diminishes. 
Risks to global activity are skewed to the downside.
 Global economic activity and trade
 While global 
economic 
activity has remained resilient, signs of moderating 
momentum are emerging.
 The global economy continued to expand at a steady 
pace in the second quarter of 2018
, supported by a rebound in activity in several 
advanced economies, inclu
ding the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. 
The 
growth rate
 for the third quarter in the United States still points to resilient activity
, 
while in the United Kingdom GDP growth was strong, partially reflecting an increase in 
government spending;
 the Japanese economy contracted
 in the same period, which 
was
 largely 
due to 
temporary factors related to natural disasters. Across emerging 
market economies (EMEs), the growth picture is more mixed. 
Economic a
ctivity held 
up in 
China in 
the third quarter
, 
but weakened substantially
 in EMEs
 that had been
 subject to financial turmoil earlier this year.
 Survey
-based evidence suggest
s that activity will decelerate in the near term.
 The global composite 
output Purchasing Managers™ Index (
PMI
) excluding the euro 
area 
has been gradually retreating since early 2018
, driven 
mainly 
by a continued 
deceleration in global manufacturing activity (Chart 1). The services sector 
performed
 better 
than manufacturing 
in the year to November, 
notwithstanding 
some volatility in 
the figures. Consumer confidence 
has recently 
declined, albeit from high levels.

-term averageﬂ refers to the period from January 1999 to November 2018.
 Financial conditions in 
advanced economies
 remain accommodative, while the 
picture for EMEs is relatively mixed.
 In China, financial conditions 
have 
eased 
owing to action by the People™s
 Bank of China reacting to the worsening outlook for 
activity, amid domestic imbalances and rising trade tensions. However, financial 
conditions in the EMEs that were among the hardest hit by the summer financial 
market turbulence 
Œ including Argentina and
 Turkey 
Œ remain tight and 
are 
weigh
ing
 significantly on their outlook for activity. Overall, global risk sentiment has not fully 
recovered since the summer months and financial investors have been discriminating 
against EMEs with significant imbalances, h
igh external financing needs and 
limited 
room for 
policy 
support
. Looking 
ahead, a further rise in US interest rates 
as the 
Federal Open Market Committee proceeds with its gradual policy normalisation, 
coupled with a stronger dollar
, could lead to a furthe
r tightening of fin
ancial conditions 
across EMEs.
 In the near term, the current cyclical momentum is expected to support global 
activity.
 Advanced economies continue to benefit from accommodative monetary 
policies and supportive financial conditions. A siz
eable procyclical fiscal stimulus in the 
United States, including lower taxes and increased expenditure, will also provide an 
impetus to global growth, amid a broader shift towards more expansionary fiscal 
policies among adva
nced economies.
 Looking 
further
 ahead, activity is projected to decelerate in 2019 and 
be steady 
in the following two years
. This
 reflects the projected cyclical slowdown across 
advanced economies and in China. Output gaps are already closed in many advanced 
economies, and spare capacit
y is expected to narrow across emerging market 
economies over the 
medium term
. The intensification of trade tensions between the 
United States and China 
should 
weigh on activity in both countries. While 
the
 global 
impact is still judged to be relatively limited, heightened uncertainty about future trade 
relations
 may adversely affect confidence and investment. Moreover, policy support

  7 likely to
 gradually diminish. 
For
 the United States, the baseline proje
ction 
is that
 the 
boost to growth from fiscal stimulus 
will
 peak in 2019; in Japan fiscal stimulus is 
already expected to fade this year. On the monetary policy side, a gradual tightening is 
expected
 in the United States
, as reflected in current financial 
market prices
, 
and should contribute to a modest tightening of global financial conditions. The 
expected 
path for global activity also reflects 
a recovery in several emerging market economies, 
especially those affected by the recent financial market turbul
ence. Overall, the pace 
of global expansion is expected to settle at rates
 below those seen before the 2007
-08 financial crisis
. Turning to developments across countries, in the United States activity is 
expected to remain resilient in the near term.
 Stron
g labour market conditions, 
solid corporate profits and still favourable financial conditions 
should 
support growth. 
The procyclical fiscal stimulus will 
continue to underpin
 the favourable growth outlook 
next year, while the bilateral trade conflict with 
China is expected to weigh somewhat 
on activity and investment. 
Moreover
, the mid
-term elections resulted in split control of 
Congress
, thereby increasing the likelihood of legislative gridlock.
 In Japan, activity 
is expected to
 rebound in the near term, 
but the pace of the 
economic expansion is projected to decelerate gradually thereafter.
 The adverse 
impact of a series of natural disasters weighed on activity in the third quarter
 of 2018
, 
although growth
 is expected to recover in the fourth quarter. Looki
ng ahead, activity 
will benefit from accommodative monetary policy, but increasingly binding capacity 
constraints are expected to weigh on growth. Wages are rising moderately, amid a 
tight labour market, which sho
uld support household spending.
 In the Unit
ed Kingdom, the outlook is for moderate growth
, as domestic 
demand remains subdued.
 Surprisingly solid activity in the third quarter 
was
 supported by several transitory factors. However, high uncertainty 
continued to
 weigh 
on business investment, which ext
ended its decline to three consecutive quarters. The 
near term outlook remains subject to considerable uncertainty due to the upcoming 
voting on the 
EU w
ithdrawal 
agreement
 in Parliament.
 In central and eastern European countries, GDP growth is projected t
o remain 
robust in the near term.
 Activity is supported by strong investment linked to EU 
funds, solid consumer spending and improvements in the labour market. Over the 
medium term, activity is expected to decelerate towards potential.
 Activity in China ha
s remained strong, supported by solid consumption, 
government policy support and 
robust
 exports, 
possibly
 due in part to
 frontloading of orders in anticipation of higher tariffs.
 However, in the near term a 
slowing housing market and the lagged effects of 
earlier deleveraging efforts 
should 
weigh on growth. Also, new trade tariffs implemented by the US 
Administration are 
expected to adversely impact activity. Their overall 
effect
 in China is assumed to be 
relatively contained, though, owing to the recently enacted policy stimulus measures. 
Over the medium term, progress on the implementation of structural reforms is 
expected to result in an orderly slowdown and some rebalancing of
 the Chinese 
economy.

  8 Economic activity is projected to strengthen in the large commodity
-exporting 
countries.
 In Russia, the economic recovery is expected to continue, supported by 
the past increase in oil prices, 
and improving domestic demand amid rising
 disposable 
income and credit. The recent fall in oil prices implies some downside risk to the 
outlook for the Russia economy. Over the medium
 term, growth is seen benefiting 
somewhat 
from
 the recently announced multi
-year government spending plan. In 
Braz
il, activity is expected to accelerate in the near term, as the impact of political 
uncertainties and the disruptions from the truckers™ strike fades away. Further ahead, 
an improved labour market and continuing monetary accommodation should support 
consum
ption, as inflationary pressures remain contained.
 Turkey is expected to undergo a difficult adjustment in the coming months.
 Despite t
he recent stabili
sation of the lira, financial conditions remain tight. 
Combined
 with high inflation and procyclical mone
tary and fiscal policies
, this is
 projected
 to 
weigh on economic activity.
 Global trade growth has moderated
 in 2018,
 following its strong momentum in 
2017. The volume of global merchandise imports has been 
relatively
 volatile this year. 
After stalling in 
the second quarter of 2018, trade
 increased by 1.5% in the third 
quarter on account of stronger EME imports. 
Indicators 
for subsequent periods 
provide mixed signals. While the new export order 
PMI 
would suggest more 
underlying weakness in global trade (Cha
rt 2), other
 indicator
s Œ such as 
global 
industrial production or the Tech Pulse index
 Œ suggest steady growth.
 Trade tensions between the United States and China have escalated.
 The US 
Administration has announced tariffs targeting an additional USD 200 b
illion of 
Chinese exports to the United States
, and China has retaliated 
with
 tariffs on an 
additional USD 60 billion of exports from the United States, both effective as of 24 
September 2018. This follows previously enacted tariffs targeting USD 50 billio
n of 
th
ese countries™ bilateral merchandise trade
, as well as
 tariffs targeting steel and 
aluminium 
exports
 to the Unites States and retaliation by China. 
These measures are 
expected to weigh on activity and trade in the United States and China, yet their 
global 
impact us expected to remain relatively contained.

 Note: The latest observations are for

. While the impact of 
tariffs remains contai
ned so far, it is expected to affect merchandise trade between the 
United States and China to a larger extent next year. Over the 
period 2020
-21, global 
trade is projected to grow
 broadly in line with activity.
 Global 
economic 
growth is projected to decele
rate next year and 
be steady 
in 
the following two years
. According to the December 2018 
Eurosystem
 staff 
macroeconomic projections, world real GDP growth (excluding the euro area) is 
expected to 
stand at
 3.8% this year before decelerating to 3.5% in 2019. 
Over the 
period 2020
-21, it is projected 
to be
 broadly steady. This projection path reflects the 
expected slowdown in the near term in some emerging economies
, as financial 
conditions have tightened. Further ahead, the expansion in advanced economies is 
projected to slow towards potential growth. 
Moreover
, the pace of expansion in China 
is expected to moderate gradually. Growth in euro area foreign demand is 
projected
 to 
decline from 4.3% this year to 3.1% in 2019, before rising slightly 
in the medium
 term.
 Compared with the September 2018 
ECB staff 
projections, global GDP growth has 
been revised slightly downwards for 2018 and 2019, reflecting the weaker outlook in 
some EMEs. Growth in euro area foreign demand has also been revised downwards
, 
for 2019 and 2
020, reflecting the effect of higher tariffs and weaker projected 
economic 
activity.
 Risks for global activity are on the downside. A further escalation of trade 
disputes could significantly weigh on global 
growth
. While the temporary truce 
between the United States and China sent a positive signal, there remains 
considerable uncertainty 
as to 
whether the talks will lead to a significant de
-escalation 
of US
-China trade tensions. Other downside risks relate to 
a fast
er than expected
 tightening of global financial conditions 
leading to
 broader stress in emerging markets, 
uncertainties regarding China™s reform process, and political and geopolitical 
uncertainties, including risks related to Brexit.

  10 Global price developm
ents
 Although very volatile, o
il prices have recently declin
ed significantly.
 Volatility in 
the oil price 
has largely 
reflect
ed news from the supply side of the market, 
although, 
more recently,
 expectations 
of lower global demand 
have 
weighed on the oil price. The 
Brent crude 
oil price peaked at
 USD
 86 per barrel in early October amid expectations 
of significantly lower oil exports 
from
 Iran 
owing
 to looming US sanctions and 
a decision by
 OPEC and Russia to keep their production steady.
 Since then, a 
confluence of positive news on the supply side, including declaration
s of sufficient 
spare supply capacity by Saudi Arabia and Russia
 and the announcement of 
temporary waivers from US sanctions for several large economies importing oil from 
Iran, have contributed to a
n oil price
 decline. More recently, expectations of lower 
global demand for oil 
have also pushed the price down
. Th
ese developments have 
meant that the oil price assumption underpinning the December 2018 
Eurosystem
 staff macroeco
nomic projections was about 5.8% lower 
for
 2019 and 
3.2% lower for 
2020 than in
 the previous projections. Since the cut
-off date for the projections, 
however, the price of oil has fallen further, reaching USD 
59 per barrel on 
12 December.
 Before the recent
 fall in oil prices, past increases put some upward pressure on 
global consumer price inflation.
 Annual
 consumer price index inflation 
in the 
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD) 
rose to 3.1% in October. Excluding 
food and energy, inflation 
was unchanged
 at 2.3%, 
pausing on a very moderate upward trend observed over the past year (Chart 3). At 
the same time, despite tightening labour markets across advanced economies, wage 
pressures remain relatively subdued.

  12 2 Financial developments
 Since the Governing Council™s meeting in September
 2018 global long
-term risk
-free 
rates have declined in 
the context
 of heightened geopolitical uncertainty and a 
perceived deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. Euro area sovereign bond 
spreads have been largely stable, with the exception of Italy 
where
 they have 
exhibited 
significant 
volatility. Although corporate 
earnings 
expectations 
remain 
robust, 
some downward revisions, in addition to a repricing of risk, have led to falls in 
the 
equity and bond prices of euro area corporat
ions
. In foreign exchange markets, the 
euro has broadly weakened in trade
-weighted terms.
 Long-term yields have declined in the euro area and in the United States.
 During 
the period under review (from 13
 September
 to 
12 December
 2018
), the euro area 
ten
-year risk
-free overnight index swap (OIS) rate 
fell overall to 0.72
% (
down 4 
basis 
points)
 and the GDP
-weighted euro area ten
-year sovereign bond yield 
fell to
 1.0
9% (down 1 
basis point). In the United States
 (see Chart 4),
 the ten
-year 
sovereign
 bond yield fell by 6
 basis points to 2.9
1%, while 
in the United Kingdom 
the ten
-year 
sovereign bond 
yield 
fell 
by 
22 basis points to 1.
28%. Intra
-period movements and the 
overall decline in global long
-term yields were driven by

 Euro area real GDP growth slowed further to 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third 
quarter of 2018, mainly as a result of sector
-specific 
developments. Looking ahead, 
the incoming information remains overall consistent with an ongoing economic 
expansion, albeit with increased downside risks. Euro area real GDP growth is 
supported primarily by growth in private consumption and investment. The
 December 
2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual 
real GDP increasing by 1.7% in 2019, 1.7% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021. Compared with 
the September 2018 projections, real GDP growth has been revised down slightly for 
2018 and 2019, mainly owing to the weaker data outturn in the third quarter of 2018 
and the associated lower carry
-over into 2019.
 Growth in the euro area moderated further in the third quarter of 2018, mainly 
owing to sector
-specific developments, but rem
ained resilient overall, despite a 
slight contraction in a few euro area countries.
 Real GDP increased by 0.2%, 
quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of this year, following growth of 0.4% in the 
previous two quarters (see Chart 10). The slowdown in the
 third quarter appears to 
have been mainly related to temporary bottlenecks in car production (mainly in 
Germany). For a more detailed discussion of the slowdown in growth in 2018, see Box 
3. Domestic demand continued to make a positive contribution to gro
wth in the third 
quarter of 2018, although it was smaller than in previous quarters. Changes in 
inventories also provided a further positive contribution, whereas net trade made a 
negative contribution. On the production side, economic activity in the thir
d quarter 
was again mainly supported by robust growth in the services and construction sectors, 
while value added in industry (excluding construction) contracted somewhat.

  18 Employment continued to increase in the third quarter of the year, rising by 
0.2%, quarter on quarter (see Chart 1
1).
 The level of employment currently stands 
2.6% above the pre
-crisis peak recorded in the first quarter of 2008. Employment 
increased in most euro area countries and the increase was also broadly based 
across sectors. With the latest increase, cumulative
 employment growth in the euro 
area since the trough in the second quarter of 2013 amounts to 9.6 million. While this 
increase is similar in magnitude to that seen in the five years before the crisis, its 
composition differs, particularly in terms of contr
ibutions by age group (see Box 4). 
Continuing employment growth in combination with the drop in GDP growth in 2018 
has translated into a moderation in productivity growth, following a modest pick
-up in 
2017. Short
-term labour market indicators have been we
aker recently, but still point to 
continuing employment growth in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 The euro area 
unemployment rate stood at 8.1% in October, unchanged from the third quarter of 
2018, and remains at the lowest level seen since November 2008. Surv
ey indicators 
have moderated somewhat from very high levels, but still point to continued 
employment growth in the fourth quarter of 2018. While indicators of labour shortages 
have moderated slightly in some sectors and countries, they remain at historical
ly very 
high levels.

 Despite some short

 Private

 displayed zero growth in 
the third quarter of 2018. Moreover, new passenger car registrations in October were 
more than 16% below the level recorded in the third quarter. However, these data are 
currently difficult to interpret owing to the temporary bott
lenecks in car production and 
sales. While crude oil prices are still far below the peaks recorded in 2012, they have

  19 been volatile recently, giving rise to heightened uncertainty about households™ 
purchasing power. From a longer
-term perspective, increasi
ng labour income 
continues to support the solid underlying momentum in consumer spending. In 
addition, the strengthening of households™ balance sheets remains an important factor 
behind steady consumption growth, particularly as households™ creditworthines
s is a 
key determinant of their access to credit.
 The ongoing recovery in housing markets is expected to continue to drive 
growth, albeit at a slower pace.
 Housing investment increased by 0.6% in the third 
quarter of 2018, reflecting the continuing recover
y in many euro area countries and in 
the euro area as a whole. Recent short
-term indicators and survey results point to 
positive, but decelerating, momentum. Construction production in the buildings 
segment 
increased by 0.8%, quarter on quarter, in the thi
rd quarter of 2018, 
decelerating from 0.9% in the second quarter
. 
The European Commission™s 
construction confidence indicators in the last few months point to positive, albeit 
weakening, momentum in the fourth quarter of 2018
. T
he Purchasing Managers™ 
Inde
x (PMI) for housing activity averaged 50.1 from September to November
. 
Confidence indicators from European Commission surveys also declined somewhat in 
November. However, both the PMI indicators and the European Commission 
confidence indicators remain clea
rly above their long
-run averages.
 Business investment (proxied by non
-construction investment) rose by 0.4%, 
quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2018, following the strong rebound in 
the previous quarter (1.7%).
 The slowdown was entirely due to th
e marked 
deceleration in the quarterly growth of the machinery and equipment component, 
which fell from 2.5% in the second quarter of 2018 to 0.5% in the third quarter. This 
was partly explained by the rather weak export performance, given that this 
compon
ent is highly trade
-intensive. Developments across countries also exhibited 
some disparities. While non
-construction investment increased at robust growth rates 
in France and Spain (1.9% and 1.5%, quarter on quarter, respectively), it grew more 
moderately 
in Germany and the Netherlands (0.6% and 0.3%, quarter on quarter, 
respectively), and in Italy it declined sharply (
-2.3%, quarter on quarter). Despite these 
recent developments, business investment is expected to remain supported by 
resilient domestic dem
and, profitability and favourable financial conditions in the 
period ahead. However, trade policy uncertainty and weakening global trade are 
factors that pose downside risks.
 After the recovery in the second quarter, total real euro area exports slightly 
contracted in the third quarter of 2018 in quarter
-on-quarter terms.
 The decline in 
exports was driven by goods exports (
-0.2%), whereas services exports slightly 
increased (0.2%). Data on trade in goods show that the weakness in goods exports 
primarily res
ulted from intra
-euro area export flows. Extra
-euro area export growth 
improved, but remained subdued, particularly exports to the United Kingdom, China 
and Turkey. Total real euro area imports increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the 
third quarter of
 2018. This led to a negative net trade contribution of 0.3 percentage 
point. Looking ahead, leading indicators confirm weak export performance in the near 
future, with survey results pointing to a small contraction in exports and hard data

  20 based on indust
rial orders outside the euro area pointing to a less pronounced 
deterioration
. The latest economic indicators and survey results, while somewhat weaker 
than expected, overall confirm ongoing broad
-based growth of the euro area 
economy.
 Industrial productio
n (excluding construction) increased slightly in October. 
However, outcomes were mixed across sectors and across the larger euro area 
countries. The European Commission™s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) declined 
in October and remained broadly stable in
 November, but remains well above its 
long
-term average. The composite output PMI decreased in October and November, 
while still remaining at levels suggesting continued growth.
 The ongoing broad
-based economic expansion is expected to continue.
 The ECB™s 
accommodative monetary policy continues to support domestic demand. 
Ongoing employment gains and rising wages should underpin private consumption. At 
the same time, business investment is supported by solid domestic demand, 
favourable financing conditions 
and improving balance sheets. Residential investment 
remains buoyant.
 The December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro 
area foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.7% in 2019, 1.7% in 2020 and 1.5% 
in 2021 (see Chart 12).
 Compared 
with the September 2018 projections, real GDP 
growth has been revised down slightly for 2018 and 2019. This reflects the weaker 
data outturn in the third quarter of 2018 and the associated lower carry
-over into 2019. 
At the same time, for both 2019 and 202
0, while slightly higher long
-term lending 
rates, lower stock prices and lower foreign demand growth will dampen activity, these 
effects are expected to be broadly offset by the favourable impact of lower oil prices, 
the weaker effective exchange rate of t
he euro and some additional fiscal loosening. 
The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly 
balanced. However, the balance of risks is moving to the downside owing to the 
persistence of uncertainties related to geopoli
tical factors, the threat of protectionism, 
vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility.

 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation declined to 
2.0% in November 2018, from 2.2% in October. While 
measures of underlying inflation 
continued to move sideways, domestic cost pressures continued to strengthen and 
broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking 
ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase gra
dually over the medium term, 
supported by the ECB™s monetary policy measures, the continuing economic 
expansion and rising wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the 
December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro a

 (flash estimate) for 
HICP excluding energy

 and October 2018
 for 
all 
the 
other measures
. The range of 
measures of

 consists of the following: HICP excluding energy; HICP excluding 
energy 
and unprocessed food; HICP excluding 
energy and

 and the

 Price pressures for 
non
-energy industrial goods in the 
HICP were
 largely 
unchanged
 in the later stages of the supply chain
. There were mixed signals in the 
recent data for the very early stages of the pricing chain: the annual rate of chang
e of 
oil prices in euro fell modestly in October and then 
substantially 
in November. 
In 
contrast
, global non
-energy producer price inflation 
was
 4.6
% in October, 
up considerably 
from
 its 
historical average of about 2.5% at the beginning of this year. 
Despi

 in recent months at about 0.8%
, import price inflation for non

consumer goods and
 for
 intermediate goods 
remained substantially higher than their

 earlier this year (see Chart
 15). Domestic producer price inflation for 
non-food consumer goods increased slightly to 0.8% in October, 
up from 0.7% in the 
previous three months and above its long
-term average of 0.6%. Overall, price 
pressures along the later stages of the supply chain remained broadly unchanged.

 Recent developments in wage growth signal a continued upward trend and 
support t
he notion of a gradual buil
d-up in domestic cost pressures.
 Annual 
growth in compensation per employee increased to 
2.5
% in the third quarter of 2018, 
compared with 
2.2
% in the second quarter of 2018. Compensation per employee 
growth now stands 
marked
ly hi
gher than in the first half of 2016. These developments 
are in line with increasing 
tightness in the labour market. Also, fa
ctors that were 
weighing on wage growth, including past low inflation and the ongoing impact of labour 
market reforms implemented in
 some countries during the crisis, continue to fade. 
While the early phase of strengthening 
compensation per employee growth was 
driven mainly by 
the 
wage drift
, most of the momentum in recent quarters
 came from 
the rise in the annual growth of negotiated 
wages
 (see 
the b

 Money and credit
  28 5 Money and credit
 In October
 2018 broad money growth picked up amid an ongoing shift towards more 
self
-sustained sources of money creation as the monthly net asset purchases under 
the asset purchase programme (APP) are reduced. Lending to the private sector
 continued to grow
 and remained the largest driver of broad money growth
, albeit with 
some signs of slowing down, mainly for loans to 
non-financial corporations (
NFCs
). At 
the same time, bank funding and lending conditions remained very favourable. 
In 
addition
, the net issuance of debt securities by NFCs strengthened considerably in the 
third quarter of 2018, benefiting from bond market conditions
 that were 
still
 relatively 
favourable.
 Broad money growth 
picked up
 in 
October, but remained below the level it
 had 
maintained until late 2017
. The annual growth rate of M3 
increased to
 3.9% in 
October 2018 from
 3.5% in 
September (see Chart 19). This development in part 
reflected a sizeable monthly flow and a base effect. Since late 2017, M3 growth has 
eased as the
 reduction 
in net asset purchases
 (from •80
 billion
 to •60
 billion
 in April
 2017, to •30
 billion
 in January
 2018, and then to 
•15 billion in 
October
 2018) meant 
that the APP had a smaller positive impact on M3 growth.
2 The narrow money 
aggregate M1, which includes the most liquid components of M3, continued to make a 
significant contribution to broad money growth, remaining stable at 6.8% in October. 
Money growth continued to receive support from sustained economic expa
nsion and 
the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid instruments in an environment of 
very low interest rates.

 Notes: Loans are adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling. The latest observation is for

 Overnight deposits 
remained 
the main 
contributor to
 M3 growth.
 The
 annual 
growth rate
 of overnight deposits remained at 7.3% in O
ctober, reflecting the steady 
expansion of overnight deposits held by households, while the annual growth of 
                                                                    2  See, for example, the article entitled ﬁ

  29 overnight deposits held by
 NFCs moderated. C
urrency in circulation
 grew steadily, 
thereby not pointing to any large
-scale substitution of
 cash for 
deposits in an 
environment of very low or negative interest rates. Short
-term deposits other than 
overnight deposits (i.e.
 M2 minus M1) continued to 
make
 a negative 
contribution
 to
 M3 growth, although
 the spread between the interest rates on short
-term tim
e deposits 
and overnight deposits 
has stabilised 
since late 2017
. 
Marketable instruments (i.e.
 M3 
minus M2)
, which are 
a small component of M3
, also had a negative impact on M3 
growth, given the currently low remuneration of these instruments.
 Credit to th
e private sector is the largest
 driver of broad money growth (see 
Chart
 20). From a counterpart perspective,
 the 
positive 
contribution
 to M3 growth from
 general government securities held by the Eurosystem
 decreased further 
(see the 
red
 parts of the 
bars i
n Chart
 20) in 
the
 context of 
the aforementioned
 reduction
 in monthly
 net 
purchases under the 
APP. 
This has been 
largely 
offset by a moderate
 increase in 
the contribution from credit to the private sector since late 2017
 (see the 
blue
 parts of 
the 
bars in 
Chart
 20). This marks an ongoing shift towards more self
-sustained 
sources of money creation, with credit to the private sector surpassing Eurosystem 
purchases of general government debt securities as the largest contributor to M3 
growth
 in October. 
By con
trast, government bond sales by euro area
 monetary 
financial institutions (MFIs)
 excluding the Eurosystem dampened M3 growth (see the 
light green parts of the
 bars in Chart 
20). Finally
, for the first time since 
June 
2015 the 
contribution from net external
 assets
 (see the yellow parts of the bars in Chart 20)
, 
which
 among other things 
reflects investors™ preferences for euro area assets, turned 
positive in October.

October
 the

 for euro area banks
 increased slightly,

 At the same time, the costs of deposit funding have remained broadly

 The repercussions
 of the increase in the
 cost of funding through the 
issuance of debt securities for the overall composite cost of funding for banks
 have 
been rather contained
, owing to the limited share of this type of funding in banks™

the pass
-through of the monetary 
policy measures put in place, improving borrowing conditions 
and financing 
requirements related to the hig
her number of mergers and acquisitions. At the same 
time, NFCs™ 
high retained earnings
 have 
reduced the need for external financing.
 In the third quarter of 2018 the n
et issuance of debt securities by NFCs 
strengthened considerably
, benefiting from bond ma
rket conditions that are 
still relatively favourable
. Issuance
 activity picked up in September after having 
been virtually flat over the first two months of the quarter. In terms of annual flows
 (see 
Chart 26), the net issuance of debt securities rebounded
 in September from a 
two
-year low in August, while the net issuance of quoted shares stabilised around the 
high levels recorded in 2015
-16. 
Market data suggest that the net issuance of debt 
securities moderated in October and November 2018
. The n
et issuanc
e of listed 
shares 
was marginally negative 
in 
the third quarter of 2018, possibly owing to 
the 
increase in the 
cost of equity financing

  35 6 Fiscal developments
 The euro area general government budget deficit is projected to have declined 
significantly in 2018 but to increase somewhat next year. The 
fall
 in 2018 was mainly 
the result of favourable cyclical conditions and declining interest payments. The 
aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is expected to be broadly neutral in 2018, 
to 
loosen in 2019 and 2020
, and to turn neutral again in 2021. 
Howeve
r, these 
fluctuations in the aggregate stance for the euro area mask significant differences 
across countries. For instance, in 2018 large windfalls in a few countries 
have 
compensate
d in the aggregate for procyclical fiscal loosening in vulnerable countri
es. 
In particular the countries with high debt levels would
, on the contrary
, benefit from 
additional consolidation efforts to set their public debt ratio firmly on a downward path.
 The euro area general government budget deficit is projected to have decli
ned 
significantly in 2018 but to increase somewhat next year. Based on the 
December
 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections
,3 the general 
government deficit ratio for the euro area is expected to fall from 1.0% of GDP in 2017
4 to 0.6% of GDP in 202
1, with a temporary worsening in 2019. The overall improvement 
in the fiscal outlook is mainly driven by lower interest payments and favourable cyclical 
developments. This is partly offset by a lower cyclically adjusted primary balance from 
2019 onwards
 (see Chart 27).
 The outlook for the euro area general government deficit for the next two years 
has deteriorated compared with the September 2018 ECB staff projections.
 The 
higher deficit is partly the outcome of a significant worsening of the projected 
budgetary balance in Italy due to the fiscal expansion 
included in the draft budgetary 
plan
, 
which would be 
in breach of the commitments under the 
Stability and Growth 
Pact 
(SGP
). For the euro area, this deterioration is reflected in a somewhat higher 
primary 
expenditure and a lower cyclic
al component.

 Notes: The data refer to the aggregate general government sector of the 
euro area.
 The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is expected to be broadly neutral 
in 2018, to loosen in 2019 and then to gradually return to neutral in 2021.
5 This 
profile is affected by discretionary measures which are projected to be 
expansionary 
both in 2018 and over the next two years. However, in 2018 large revenue windfalls 
due to buoyant direct tax collection in a few countries
 are expected to have more than 
compensated for this
. The decline in the euro area aggregate public debt
-to-GDP ratio is projected to 
continue.
 According to the December
 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections, the aggregate general government debt
-to
-GDP ratio in the euro area is 
expected to decline from 86.8% of GDP in 2017
6 to 79.0% of GDP in 2021.
 The 
projected reduction in government debt is supported by both the negative interest 
rate
-growth rate differential and primary surpluses (see Chart
 28). Deficit
-debt 
adjustments are expected to offset some of these effects. Over the projection horizon, 
the debt ratio should fall or broadly stabilise in all euro area 
countries
 but will continue 
to far exceed the reference value of 60% of GDP in a number of countries. Compared 
with the September
 2018 projections, the decline in the aggregate euro area 
debt-to
-GDP ratio is expected to be marginally more subdued due to a lower primary 
surplus path
.                                                                     5  The fiscal stance reflects the direction and size of the stimulus from fiscal policies 
to the economy, 
beyond the automatic reaction of public finances to the business cycle. It is measured as the change in 
the cyclically adjusted primary balance ratio net
 of government support 
to the financial sector
. For more

 Notes: The data re
fer to the aggregate general government sector of the euro area.
 Countries need to continue their fiscal efforts in full compliance with the 
SGP
. For high debt countries in particular, further consolidation efforts are essential to set 
the public debt rati
o firmly on a downward path, as their high debt levels render them 
vulnerable to any future downturns or renewed financial market instability. In 
the
 light
 of this
, it is of concern that compliance with the SGP is weakest for those countries that 
are most 
vulnerable to shocks. In fact, according to the European Commission
™s projections, most of the countries that have not yet reached sound budgetary positions 
missed their commitments under the SGP in 2018 and are at risk of doing so 
again
 in 
2019.7 It is pa
rticularly worrying that the largest deviation from existing commitments 
is in Italy, a country w
ith a markedly high debt ratio.

 1 Emerging market vulnerabilities
 Œ a comparison 
with
 previous 
crises
 
 Against the background of financial market volatility in some emerging 
market 
economies (EMEs) since April, this box reviews key vulnerabilities in EMEs. 
Specifically, it assesses 
their 
resilience to external shocks compared to previous crisis 
episodes.
 Since April many EMEs have been subject to bouts of financial market volatility 
amid expectations of faster US monetary policy tightening and a stronger US 
dollar, coupled with rising uncertainty related to global trade tensions.
 Acute 
stress has been limi
ted to Argentina and Turkey so far, but most EMEs have seen 
financial conditions tighten over the year. Fund flows data show that global investors 
have started to retrench from EMEs since April. At the same time, EME stock markets 
have declined sharply, un
winding the gains of the 2017 rally, and EME sovereign 
spreads have widened. There is
, however
, significant heterogeneity across EMEs
, and so far 
investors seem to have differentiated between countries based on their 
fundamentals.
 These developments have s
parked concerns about the outlook for EMEs and 
raised questions as to whether these countries may be subject to a repeat of 
previous crisis experiences
, such as the Asian crisis of the late 1990s.
 The 
Asian crisis, 
which was triggered by 
the devaluation of
 the Thai baht in July
 1997, 
resulted in a reappraisal of risk and rapid contagion to several other countries in Asia. 
Those economies faced sudden stops in capital inflows and severe recessions, 
representing one illustration of widespread balance
-of-payme
nts problems coupled 
with financial sector weaknesses. While the causes of the Asian crisis were varied, a 
common 
characteristic of 
many of the countries affected was reliance on short
-term 
external debt denominated in foreign currency coupled with pegged
-exchange rate 
regimes and financial sector fragilities. Historically, EME crises have tended to be 
accompanied by periods of US dollar appreciation which exposed countries to large 
unhedged currency mismatches between their US dollar
-denominated assets and
 liabilities (
see 
Chart
 A).8 Current circumstances, with ongoing US monetary policy 
normalisation and a strengthening US dollar, have heightened concerns that similar 
                                                                    8  For an i

  39 fragilities could leave some EMEs exposed to a repeat of such balance of payments 
concern
s. The potential risks for EMEs are important for the global outlook.
 Compared to 
two decades ago, EMEs play
, in aggregate,
 a significantly more prominent role in the 
global economy. They account for more than half of global GDP (at purchasing power 
parity
) and gross capital flows. Developments in these economies could therefore 
have a sizeable impact on other countries through a variety of channels, including 
trade, financial 
and confidence channels.

. Compared to twenty years ago, many EMEs have reduced their external 
vulnerabilities 
and improved their policy frameworks.
 Some EMEs have seen an 
improvement in their current account positions and some even run current account 
surpluses. Some oil exporting countries in particular have benefited from the oil price 
rise 
in the 2000s. 
Since 
the global 
financial 
crisis, however, current account positions 
have slightly widened again and there 
are still 
some countries with deficit positions 
(see 
Chart
 B). Policy frameworks have also evolved. A large proportion of EMEs have 
adopted inflation
-targe
ting monetary policy frameworks, which can help to anchor 
inflation expectations and stabilise business cycles. Most EMEs
 now 
also have more 
flexible exchange rate regimes. 
In addition, many EMEs accumulated reserves in the 
aftermath of the Asian crisis and 
have 
continued to do so 
since 
the 
global 
financial 
crisis. 
The 
IMF risk
-weighted metric of reserve adequacy, which benchmarks reserves 
not only against traditional metrics
 such as imports and short
-term external debt but 
also against broad money to take into account the risk of capital flight, suggest
s that

 as

), short and long
-term debt 
(as a measure of 
interest payments and rollover risk
) and broad money 
(as a measure of the scope for capital flight
). The measure accounts for the 
exchange rate regime and capital account openness. A metric between 100% and 150% indicates that reserves are adequate.

, however
, not overlook the costs of accumulating reserves. 
Traditionally
, these costs are 
related to 
the

cost

with

  41 Nonetheless, while most EMEs have reduced their reliance on foreign currency 
funding compared to the late 1990s, US 
dollar
-denominated liabi
lities in EMEs 
have increased since the Great Recession.
 EMEs
™ stock of US dollar
-denominated 
debt has risen over the past ten years as firms 
have taken 
advantage of favourable 
global financial conditions (
see 
Chart
 D).
10 To the extent that these positions 
are 
unhedged, this represents a financial stability concern in the event of a further 
strengthening of the US dollar. Indeed, there is evidence from financial markets that
, 
more recently,
 the 
growth 
in US dollar
-denominated liabilities also appears to have
 been associated with increased sensitivity of financial conditions in EMEs 
to 
US 
financial developments. In the late 1990s tighter financial conditions in the 
United 
States
 tended to be transmitted strongly to EMEs, whereas this sensitivity diminished

 Notes: 
The r
esponse
, given 
in basi

a 95% confidence interval
, is 
based on local projections using a 
fixed
-effects panel regression for

s index.

gentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, Malaysia, 
the 
Philippines, Russia, Turkey, and South Africa. 
The latest observation is for 
31 August
 2018. At the same time, domestic imbalances seem to have worsened in some EMEs, 
as illustrated by rising local currency 
debt issuance and shrinking policy space.
 While external vulnerabilities may have declined, other fragilities may have increased
, as illustrated, for instance, by higher local currency debt issuance, rising private sector 
leverage and deteriorating fiscal 
positions. Debt
-to
-GDP ratios have significantly 
increased compared to their levels twenty years ago. In particular, debt rose rapidly in 
the aftermath of the Global Recession 
as a consequence of 
favourable global financial 
conditions. The bulk of the incr
ease took place in the Chinese corporate sector. 
The 
credit
-to
-GDP ratio in China has risen to levels that may 
pose 
potential financial 
stability concerns.
11 In addition to the corporate sector, EME household leverage has 
risen, tripling compared to 
the 
mid
-1990s (
see 
Chart
 F).
12 Moreover, 
there is less 
fiscal and monetary policy 
room for manoeuvre,
 given that countries had to intervene 
with fiscal and monetary policy stimuli during the Great Recession. Fiscal space for 
commodity exporting countries deteriora
ted notably after commodity prices 
fell 
in 
2014. 
Policy 
room for manoeuvre may be even more constrained in those EMEs with 
large and unhedged foreign currency

 In order to assess whether EMEs are less prone to a severe crisis today, we 
compute the probability of a crisis occurring in 2018 and contrast it with the 
probability of a crisis occurring in 1997.
 The crisis probability captures the overall 
vulnerability 
of a country, summarising EME fundamentals in one single dimension 
encompassing the most relevant macro
-financial vulnerabilities, i.e.
 those helping 
predict severe systemic crises in EMEs and which are related to traditional 
balance
-of-payment risks as we

. More specifically, 
the parsimonious early warning model uses the best crisis predictors found in the 
early warning models literature, i.e.
 lagged values of GDP growth, inflation, current 
account to GDP, private credit t
o GDP, reserves to short
-term debt. The 
one-year
-ahead crisis probabilities are estimated with a binary logit model, where the 
dependent variable is a very severe crisis

 crisis)
 defined as in Laeven and Valencia (20
12).
14 That being said, early warning 
models have limitations. The accuracy of the model is dependent upon potential 
feedback effects of changes in polic
ies
 and expectations. Moreover, early warning 
models only incorporate indicators that were good predicto
rs of past crises
; they do 
not include new indicators that could be useful predictors of future crises. One such 
new 
indicator could be EME corporate sector leverage.
 Overall, the model suggests that, while the picture is mixed across countries, 
EME fundam
entals have broadly improved compared to the mid
-1990s.                                                                     14  The model uses a relatively long time sample of almost half of century, a well
-established definition of 
cri
sis in the literature as 
the 
dependent variable
 (see

) and a comprehensive 
country sample of 50
 systemically important countries. 
The crisis probability for 2018 is based on 2017 
data. 
The post
-crisis bias is dealt with by 
excluding 
the crisis years. The optimum cut

the

and 
non

 Emerging m
arket vulnerabilities 
Œ a comparison with previous crises
  44 Importantly, 
EMEs 
with sounder fundamentals account for a large share of the global 
economy. The empirical evidence suggests that 
the 
fundamentals of most EMEs have 
to some extent improved relative to
 1997, in particular for countries with an increasing 
weight in the global economy (
see 
Chart
 G). Overall, Asian EME fundamentals 
improved the most, suggesting that lessons 
had been learned 
after the 1997 crisis
.15 However, the model identifies Argentina an
d Turkey, which have recently experienced 
financial market turmoil, as 
being 
more vulnerable 
than in 
1997. 
In addition
, the 
example of China highlights the need to evaluate model results cautiously. The crisis 
probability predicted by the model for 2018 is relatively low because China has a 
moderate current account surplus, low inflation, strong growth, large foreign exch
ange 
reserves coverage and low levels of external debt. At the same time, China has seen a 
rapid rise in leverage 
over 
the past decade, a factor which might not be sufficiently 
picked up by the model.

 Notes: The probabilit
y of a crisis (currency
, sovereign or systemic banking crisis) occurring in 2018 
or 
1997 
is 
estimated with a binary logit 
model where the crisis dependent variable is defined as in Laeven and 
Valencia (2012). In the absence of historical data to estimate 
crisis probabilities in 1997 for China and 
South 
Korea, the chart shows crisis probabilities as of 1998 and 1999, respectively. For Russia, 
Brazil and Turkey, past crisis probabilities are as o
f 1998
 and 2001
, respectively, corresponding to the years these countries experienced 
crises. The optimal cut
-off for issuing a crisis signal is derived from Youden
™s J stat
istic
. The size
s of the country bubbles 
reflect 
the 
respective countries™ share in 
global GDP in 
purchasing power parity 
terms 
in 
2017. Overall, while most 
EMEs 
appear to have broadly sounder fundamentals and 
to 
be better placed today to withstand shocks than twenty years ago, risks remain.
 Although 
EMEs now 
have 
improved external positi
ons, domestic risks seem to have 
been building up
, in particular in the aftermath of the Global Recession. 
While 
some 
EMEs are still facing traditional balance
-of-payments problems, others may face 
financial instability stemming from an overleveraged domes
tic financial sector and
 shrinking policy space.
                                                                       15  The early warning model does not signal a crisis for 
South 
Korea and Malaysia in 1997, which 
tends to 
support the hypothesis of 
a non
-rational/non
-fundamental contagion 
of 
those countries 
at that time
. 16  Fragilities 
in China 
are heightened because 
fast
-rising credit has been accompanied by increased 
complexity and leverage in the financial system.

2018  45 2 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the 
period from 1
 August
 to 30
 October
 2018
 Prepared by Mª Carmen Castillo Lozoya and Elvira Fioretto
 This box describes the ECB™s monetary policy ope
rations during the fifth and 
sixth reserve maintenance periods of 2018, which ran from 1
 August
 to 
18 September
 2018 and from 19
 September
 to 30
 October
 2018 respectively.
 Throughout this period the interest rates on the main refinancing operations (MROs), 
the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility remained unchanged at 0.00%, 

publi
c sector securities, covered bonds, asset
-backed securities and corporate sector 
securities as part of its asset purchase programme (APP), with a target of •30
 billion of 
purchases on average per month until 
the 
end of 
September and •15
 billion as of 
Octob
er.
 Liquidity needs
 In the period under review, the average daily liquidity needs of the banking 
system, defined as the sum of net autonomous factors and reserve 
requirements, stood at •1,459.8
 billion, an increase of •32.3
 billion compared 
with the previo
us review period (i.e.
 the third and fourth maintenance periods of 
2018).
 This rise in liquidity needs was largely the result of an increase in net 
autonomous factors, which 
grew 
on average by •29.8
 billion to •1,333.1
 billion during 
the review period, whi
le minimum reserve requirements increased on average by 
•2.5
 billion to •126.7
 billion.
 The growth in net autonomous factors was mainly due to an increase in 
liquidity
-absorbing factors, partially offset by an increase in liquidity
-providing 
factors.
 Among
 liquidity
-absorbing factors, government deposits and banknotes in 
circulation accounted for the most 
significant 
changes, rising on average by •20
 billion 
to •259.4
 billion and by •16.6
 billion to •1,193.1
 billion respectively. 
These 
increase
s were
 partia
lly offset by 
increases in 
the liquidity
-providing factors, in particular net 
assets denominated in euro, which rose on average by •8.9
 billion to •200.1
 billion. 
Eurosystem liabilities to non
-euro area residents in euro decreased on average by 
•9.5
 billio
n, reflecting a less pronounced seasonal pattern than during the previous 
review period
17 and thus contributing positively to the 
(liquidity
-providing
) average net 
assets denominated in euro.
 The day
-to-day volatility of autonomous factors remained broadly 
unchanged 
from the previous review period.
 The daily fluctuations of autonomous factors came 
                                                                    17  Eurosystem liabilities to non
-euro area residents 
in euro mainly consist of euro
-denominated deposits in 
accounts held by non
-euro area 
central bank
s with the Eurosystem. Quarter
-ends, and to a lesser extent 
month
-ends, are typically affected by increases in these deposits, as commercial banks are more 
reluctant to accept cash, either in the unsecured or secured market, ahead of balance sheet reporting 
dates. On 30
 September
 2018 liabilities to non
-euro area residents denominated in euro increased 
to 
•301.7
 billion
, compared to an average of •264.7
 billion
 during the sixth maintenance period. This 
implied a less pronounced effect than that observed on 30
 June
 2018, when these liabilities increased to 
•348
 billion, compared to an average of •281.4
 billion in the fourth maintenance period.

 2018, which amounted to a total of •12.6
 billion. The average liquidity 
provided through MROs increased by •2.9
 billion to •4.8
 billion
, which 
was 
almost 
fully offset by a decline 
in 
liquidit
y provided through three
-month longer
-term 
refinancing operations (LTROs), which fell on average by •2.8
 billion to •4.6
 billion.
 Liquidity provided through the Eurosystem™s monetary policy portfolios 
increased by •67
 billion to •2,604.9
 billion on average
, on the back of ongoing 
net APP purchases.
 Liquidity provided by the public sector purchase programme, the 
third covered bond purchase programme and the corporate sector purchase 
programme rose on average by •63.6
 billion, •3.8
 billion and •9.5
 billion re
spectively. 
However, the asset
-backed securities purchase programme marginally declined on 
average by •0.2
 billion on account of net redemptions of security holdings. 
Redemptions of bonds held under the Securities Markets Programme and the 
previous two cov
ered bond purchase programmes totalled •9.7
 billion.
 Excess liquidity
 As a consequence of the developments detailed above, average excess 
liquidity increased slightly compared with the previous review period, rising by 
•20.8
 billion to •1,884.3
 billion (se
e Chart
 A).
 This increase reflects the liquidity 
provided through the APP purchases, which was only partially absorbed by higher net 
autonomous factors, mainly in the sixth maintenance period. In fact, while excess 
liquidity grew by •59.4
 billion in the fi
fth maintenance period, it declined again by 
•19 billion in the sixth maintenance period. This reversal was partly driven by the 
developments in net autonomous factors, which fell by •33.5
 billion before rising again 
by •43.9
 billion during the fifth and s
ixth maintenance period
s, respectively. Regarding 
the allocation of excess liquidity holdings between current accounts and the deposit 
facility, average current account holdings grew by •26.2
 billion to •1,358
 billion, while 
average recourse to the deposit
 facility marginally declined by •2.9
 billion to 
•653 billion.
 Interest rate developments
 Overnight unsecured and secured money market rates remained close to the 
ECB deposit facility rate, or slightly below it for specific collateral baskets in the 
secure
d money market segment.
 In the unsecured market, the euro overnight index

 2018. Regarding the 
secured market, the spread between the average overnight repo rates for the standard

slowdown in
 growth 
in 2018

 Growth 
in
 economic activity has moderated significantly
 in the euro area s
ince 
the end of 2017.
 Indeed,
 quarter
-on-quarter 
GDP growth 
in the euro area fell to 0.2% 
in the third quarter of 2018,
 down from 0.7% in 
the fourth quarte
r of 
2017. This box 
assesses the factors which 
are contributing to
 th
at slowdown
 and looks at whether
 it 
should be considered a surprise. In particular, it 
looks at whether
 the 
underlying 
factors are 
temporary or 
of a 
more permanent nature,
 whether they 
have 
originated 
within the euro area
 or externally, and 
whether
 the slowdown 
has been
 driven by 
a weak
ness in
 demand or 
a tighte
ning of
 supply conditions

 Recent output growth has been disappointing when compared 
with
 growth 
forec
asts
 in
 late
 2017, but not 
when 
compared 
with
 earlier expectations.
 The 
strong acceleration 
in growth in 2017 was a favourable development that came as a 
surprise to most professional forecasters (
see 
Chart
 A). 
That strengthening of growth, 
which coincided
 with 
world trade growth peak
ing
 at 5.2%, was 
driven 
mainly by net 
exports. Conversely, 
growth in 
domestic demand 
remained
 comparable 
to the levels 
seen
 in the first part of the economic expansion from 2014 to 2016 (
see 
Chart
 B). 
Since early 2018
, growth 
forecasts
 for 2018 and 2019 have gradually been revised 
down
wards, but
 annual GDP growth in 2018 is still expected to be 
stronger
 than was 
forecast
 at the beginning of 2017.

 The slowdown in 2018 has been driven largely by external factors, 
in particular 
the
 weakness in
 external demand.
 Indeed, m
uch like the 
strengthening of growth
 in 
2017, the 
slowdown
 in 2018 
has 
been driven by net exp
orts (
see 
Chart
 B). Trade 
dynamics ha
ve been normalising as global growth 
has fallen back
 towards potential
 levels
. As the main producer of tradable goods, the industrial sector has been most 
affected by the 
decline
 in net exports. 
Meanwhile, g
rowth 
in domestic demand 
has generally 
remained in line with 
the
 average contribution 
made 
since the start of the 
economic expansion. 
While in
 the third quarter of 2018 the
 temporary 
disruption to car 
production weighed on private consumption
, the robustness of domest
ic demand
 reflects the virtuous circle between employment, labour income and consumption. 
Available evidence suggests that this 
virtuous 
circle has not
, thus far,
 been disrupted 
by the recent loss of growth momentum.

 Several temporary factors have also weighed on the growth profile.
 In the first 
half of 2018, weathe
r conditions
, sickness and industrial action affected output in a 
number of countries.
19 In the third quarter
, there 
was also
 significant disruption 
to car 
production 
as a result of
 the introduction of new vehicle emissions standards on 
1 September (
see 
Cha
rt C). Production slowed as carmakers tried to avoid 
accumulating stocks
 of untested models, which weighed heavily on economies with 
large automobile sectors 
(such as Germany
). In
 fact
, the German economy actually 
contracted in the third quarter, re
ducing 
quarterly euro area growth 
by 
at least 
0.1
 percentage point. 
This
 effect
, however,
 is expected to be temporary. As the testing 
backlog clears, car production
 in the fourth quarter
 should gradually return to normal 
and the effect on output should dissipate.

a weak

 clear

 All in all, the recent slowdown
 in
 growth has 
not, thus
 far
, called into question 
the fundamentals of th
e current
 economic 
expansion.
 The moderation follows 
unexpectedly strong external demand in 2017 
and has been 
compounded by 
a number of
 temporary factors. 
In fact, a gradual slowdown in growth can even be 
considered normal as an expansion matures
. 
At the same time
, uncertainty about 
external developments has clearly increased the risks to the euro area
™s economic 
outlook. 
Consequently, t
he possible implications for domestic demand and the 
fundamentals of the expansion need to be monitored
 closely.

temporary disruption to car production is also regarded as a decline in 
demand.

 Compositional changes behind the growth in euro area employment during the recovery
  55 4 Compositional changes 
behind the
 growth in euro area 
employment during the recovery
 Prepared by Katalin Bodnár
 In the
 third quarter of 2018
 the total number of people in employment in the euro 
area was 9.6
 million higher than 
in the second quarter of 2013
 (when it fell to its 
lowest point during the crisis)
. The increase in employment 
over the course of
 the 
recovery 
has 
more than 
offset
 the 
decline observed
 during the crisis
. As a result, euro 
area employment is currently at its 
highest level ever
, standing at 158.3
 million
.22 This 
box describes the 
net 
employment growth 
in the euro area over the course of
 the 
recovery and
 compares 
it to
 the period
 from the first quarter of 
1999 to the first quarter 
of 
2008 (i.e.
 from the introduction of the euro to the start of the crisis
), which was also 
characterised by a continuous increase in employment across the euro area as a 
whole
. In the recent recovery, t
he country composition of employment growth has 
been somewhat different 
from that observed during
 the pre
-crisis period.
 The
 9.6
 million increase in the number of people employed in the euro area is similar 
to 
that seen in 
the five years before the crisis, 
during which
 an increase of
 10 million 
was recorded
.23 The main 
difference is
 that 
Germany now accounts for 
a significantly 
larger 
percentage
 of employment growth than 
it did 
before the crisis, while the relative 
share
s of 
the other large euro area countries
 Œ particularly Spain
 Œ have declined (see 
Chart
 A). This 
largely 
reflects the 
relative strength of the economic growth
 seen in
 th
ose countries over the two periods. 
On a related note, while Spain was the euro 
area™s main
 destination country for immigrants before the crisis, 
during the recovery 
Germany has been the country with the largest 
inflow 
of immigrants. 
Lithuania
, Austria
, Portugal
 and Slovakia 
have 
also 
increased their 
contribution
s to euro area 
employment growth 
during the recent recovery.
                                                                     22  The figures reported here are based on data from the national accounts. These allow developments in 
euro area employment to be broken down 
by countr
y and
 sector
. Data from t
he EU 
Labour Force Survey 
(LFS) 
are used
 for a detailed breakdown of employment on the basis of personal characteristics and 
types of contract
. While the dynamics of these two sets of statistics are similar, 
the
 resulting 
level
s of 
employment and cumulativ
e growth 
rates are somewhat different for methodological reasons. In the case 
of LFS data, for example, figures are based on a national concept, some sections of the population are 
not covered and employment data relate to the 15
-64 or 15
-74 age groups. In
 contrast, the national 
accounts data are based on a domestic concept, they contain an estimate of employment in the hidden 
economy and employment data cover people of all ages. Please see 
here
 for a detailed explanation. 
According to LFS
 data
, the number of people in 
employment 
increased by 8.9
 million between the first 
quarter of 2013 (its lowest point according to that dataset) and the second quarter of 2018 (th
e last 
available data point for those statistics)

 Market services drove 
employment growth 
in both periods
, although 
it 
accounted for a smaller
 percentage of total employment growth 
during the 
recent 
recovery.
 In both periods
, employment
 growth in market services 
was 
dominated by professional and administrative services and the trade and transport 
sectors. 
Meanwhile, t

 construction

By contras

. 
Finally, the public sector has 
accounted for about one
-fifth of cumulative employment growth during the 
recent 
recovery, much as it did in the pre
-crisis period.
 Employment growth has been 
fairly 
equally divided between men and women
 during the recent recovery (see Chart
 B). Before the crisis, women experienced 
very strong employment growth, in line with the
ir rising participation rate and reflecting 
increases in their level of education, labour market reforms and the growing

these trends, women™s share of the stock of employment has levelled off recently at

was seen in the second quarter of 2013).

 Compositional changes behind the growth in euro area employment during the recovery
  58 same time, the participation rate of older people has also risen considerably.
25 In the 
recent recovery, around one
-third of the increase in employment of people aged 55 to 
74 has been due to their increasing numbers, and two
-thirds has been explain
ed by 
their rising participation rate (see Chart
 C). One reason for the rising participation rate 
of the 55
-74 age group is the increase in their education level, which is positively 
correlated with the participation rate. 
However, 
that only explains a sma
ll percentage 
of the overall increase in the participation rate. It seems more likely that t
he 
main factor 
driving this increase in participation has been the fact that 
statutory
 and effective 
pension age
s have risen

 Employment growth

 Compositional chan
ges behind the growth in euro area employment during the recovery
  59 Part
-time employment rose throughout the
 crisis, and has continued to do so during 
the recovery, but its contribution to employment growth has recently declined while its 
share in total employment has flattened. This can be explained by a decline in the 
number of underemployed part
-time workers 
(i.e.
 people who would like to work more 
hours), while the contribution made to employment growth by non
-underemployed 
workers (i.e.
 people who are satisfied with their part
-time hours) has been similar to 
that observed before the crisis.
27 At the same time
, while employment growth is still 
concentrated in permanent positions, temporary employment now accounts for a 
larger percentage of employment growth, while self
-employment is falling (see 
Chart
 D).

 Recent developments in the wage drift in the euro area
  60 5 Recent developments in the wage drift in the euro area
 Prepared by 
Gerrit Koester and Justine Guillochon
 The w
age 
drift measures deviations between developments in actual wages and 
developments in negotiated wages.
 It is an important element in the 
macroeconomic analysis of employee compensation because
 it should be closely 
linked to cyclical developments in the labour market. In a tightening labour market, 
employers might be compelled to offer pay scales that are higher than those under 
collective agreements, to promote employees to higher bands within 
collectively 
agreed pay scales, or simply to pay bonuses on top of agreed wages as a way to 
reward and retain employees. Given recent protracted declines in unemployment and 
increasing signs of labour shortages, this box reviews the role of the wage drift 
in 
recent developments in employee compensation.
 Aggregate wage drift is not observable, and is here derived as the difference 
between growth rates of gross wages and salaries per employee and those of 
negotiated wages.
 This implies that headline wage grow
th as measured 
by compensation per employee can be broken dow
n into negotiated wage growth, the 
wage drift and the impact of changes in social security contributions
, where the latter is 
defin
ed as the difference between the annual rate of growth in compen
sation per 
employee and 
the annual rate of growth in
 gross wages and salaries per employee. 
The wage drift calculated in this way inevitably also picks up shifts in an economy™s 
employment structure, in the extent to which companies are bound by collective
 agreements and in average hours worked per person
 Œ thus, more than just the 
influence of labour market developments on pay premia
. Wage drift was the main driver of higher wage growth during the early phase of 
wage growth strengthening, but is now also s
upported by negotiated wages.
 From the second quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017, the 0.4
 percentage 
point change in the wage drift was the largest single contribution to the increase in the 
growth of compensation per employee, which rose from 1
.0% to 1.8% (see Chart
 A). 
Over that period growth in negotiated wages was largely flat, only starting to pick up in 
2018, when it increased from 1.5% in the last quarter of 2017 to 2.1% in the third 
quarter of 2018.The recent increase in compensation per 
employee growth from 1.9% 
in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 2.5% in the third quarter of 2018 was hence strongly 
supported also by growth in negotiated wages.

. Note: 
The l
atest observation 
is for the third quarter of 
2018.
 Changes in hours worked have not been decisive for the recent developments 
in the wage drift.
 Assuming that, on most occas
ions, growth in negotiated wages 
implicitly relates to remuneration per hour, the wage drift as calculated here can be 
affected by changes in average hours worked per employee, such as those resulting 
from overtime or 
shift
ing
 between full and part
-time em
ployment.
28 Comparing 
changes in the contribution of hours worked per employee to growth in compensation 
per employee with the wage drift shows that the substantial reductions in hours 
worked per employee in 2008
-09 and 2012-13 were
 Œ unsurprisingly
 Œ refle
cted in the 
strongly negative contributions of the wage drift to overall wage growth. Since
 2014, 
however, changes in hours worked per employee have been only loosely related to 
changes in the wage drift in the individual quarters, indicating that changes 
in hours 
worked play a limited role in developments in the aggregate wage drift.
                                                                     28  Assessing the wage drift is subject to a number of caveats. For example, euro area negotiated wage 
data, which are needed to calculate the wage drift, are
 computed 
based 
on non
-harmoni
sed country
-level 
data
. This 
could 
also 
affect the reliability of the calculated wage drift. 
Furthermore, 
the wage drift is 
computed as the difference between the annual growth rate of 
gross 
wages and salaries and 
the annual 
growth rate 
of negotiated wages
, rather 
than 
as 
the 
contribution of neg
otiated wages to overall wage 
growth. This results from the fact that negotiated wages are
 Œ unlike
 data on compensation
 Œ typically not 
available in levels.

drift to the cycle is in line with the use of bonuses and special pay in periods of the 
business cycle characterised by incr
easing productivity and profitability. However, it 
should be noted that the typical r
elationships between the wage drift and cyclical 
labour market developments were a lot less visible during the period of subdued wage 
growth from 2013 to 2016. During this
 period
, wage restraint seems to have 
also 
been applied to flexible wage elements like bonuses

 Recent develo
pments in the wage drift in the euro area
  63 Growth in negotiated wages is typically more persistent
 than the wage drift
. As 
such, it reacts less directly to changes in the unemployment rate but depends more on 
the level of that rate (see Chart D). In fact, in line with the broad signal that 
unemployment gives in respect of the state of the labour market
 and thus for the wage 
negotiation process, negotiated wages appear to react only to cumulative changes in 
the unemployment rate in one direction and therefore respond to cyclical labour 
market developments
 with a longer lag. Such a time lag and a higher p
ersistence of 
negotiated wage growth is in 
line with bargaining processes in major euro area 
countries, which often fix wages for periods longer than 
one year
. Moreover, 
overlapping calendars in sectoral wage negotiations imply that normally not all 
contra
cts are negotiated in the same year and that it may thus take some time for 
cyclical developments to be fully reflected in aggregate negotiated wage growth.

 Notes: The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2018. The right

 The higher persistence in negotiated wage growth bolst
ers confidence that the 
recent increase in wage growth will be sustained.
 Growth in negotiated wages 
reflects the fixation of pay developments for some time ahead and is thus a foundation 
for actual pay developments. This adds to a more confident outlook f
or wage growth 
than if the upturn were driven just by the wage drift, which reacts more quickly to 
changes in the labour market. While it is, in general, not impossible that the wage drift 
could even turn negative if unexpected adverse macroeconomic develo
pments were 
to materialise, their impact would also need to be unusually large to offset the positive 
effect of the recently higher growth in negotiated wages. L
ooking ahead, recent wage 
agreements and the broadening of wage growth across 
countries and 
sec
tors support 
the expectation of a further pick
-up in wage growth

 An assessment of draft budgetary plans for 2019
  64 6 An assessment of draft budgetary plans for 2019
 Prepared by Stephan Haroutunian, Sebastian Hauptmeier and Nadine 
Leiner
-Killinger
 On 2
1 November
 2018 the European Commission released its op
inions on the 
draft budgetary plans 
(DBPs) 
of euro area governments for 201
9, together with 
an analysis of the budgetary situation in the euro area as a whole.
 Each
 opinion 
include
s an assessment of
 the compliance of
 the 
relevant 
plan with the Stability an
d Growth Pact (SGP). 
This 
exercise
 is important 
as it assesses whether countries have 
incorporated into their plans the country
-specific recommendations for fiscal policies 
that were addressed to them 
under the 2018 European Semester, as adopted by the 
Eco
nomic and
 Financial Affairs Council on 13
 July
 2018.29 These recommendations 
propose, among other things, that countries with high ratios of government debt to 
GDP aim for a sufficiently fast reduction in indebtedness. This would raise their 
resilience in a
 future economic downturn.
30 The Commission opinions point to very heterogeneous fiscal developments 
across the euro area countries.
 On the one hand, based on its 2018 autumn 
economic forecast, the Commission considers ten of the draft budgetary plans
 Œ an unprecedented number
 Œ as compliant with the SGP.
 31 This refers to the plans of 
Germany, Ireland, Greece, Cyprus, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, 
the 
Netherlands, 
Austria and Finland (all under the SGP™s preventive arm
; see Chart
 A). These 
countries are proj
ected to record sound fiscal positions in 2019 as captured by their 
medium
-term budgetary objectives (MTOs).
32 The Commission 
also 
considers that 
the draft budgetary plans of a further three countries are ﬁbroadly compliantﬂ with the 
SGP.
33 This refers to th
e plans of Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia.
 On the other hand, the 
draft budgetary plans of those countries farthest from sound fiscal positions pose the 
largest risks of non
-compliance with the SGP. According to the Commission™s 
economic forecast, these coun
tries™ structural efforts are projected to fall significantly 
short of their SGP commitments (see Chart
 B). This holds, notably, for most of the 
countries that are projected to record high government debt ratios of above 90% of 
GDP in 2019 (see Chart
 A).
34 Specifically, t
he draft budgetary plans of 
five
 countries 
                                                                    29  See 
the 
country
-specific recommendations for fiscal policies under the 2018 European Semester
 for 
more information. 
For 
more 
background and further detail, see the box entitled ﬁCountry
-specific 
recommendations for fiscal policies under the 2018 European Semesterﬂ, 
Economic Bulletin
, Issue
 4, 
ECB, June
 2018.
 30  The review of draft budgetary plans inclu
ded Greece, which participated in this exercise for the first time 
after having exited its financial adjustment programme in August.
 31  This
 is four more than the number of countries whose plans were found to be fully compliant last year.
 32  Greece does no
t have an MTO yet, but its surplus is assessed by the Commission as exceeding a new 
target that is to be established. 
According to the Commission™s Vade Mecum on the Stability and Growth 
Pact, countries with a structural balance within the 0.25% of GDP mar
gin of tolerance of the MTO are 
considered as having achieved their MTO
. 33  For countries 
subject to
 the SGP™s preventive arm, draft budgetary plans are ﬁbroadly compliantﬂ if, 
according to the Commission™s forecast, the plan may result in some deviation f
rom the MTO or the 
adjustment path towards it, but the shortfall relative to the requirement would not represent a significant 
deviation from 
it. Deviations from the fiscal targets under the preventive arm are classified as ﬁsignificantﬂ 
if they exceed 0.5
% of GDP in one year or 0.25% o
f GDP on average in two consecutive years.
 34  Except for Slovenia, these countries are not expected to reduce their government debt towards the 
reference value of 60% of GDP, in line with the SGP™s debt rule, in 2019.

particularly serious risk of non

DBP for 2019 was considered by the Commission as being compliant with the SGP.
 The 
reas
ons why
 some
 countries 
do not make sufficient 
progress to
wards
 sound fiscal positions need to be addressed
. First, under the SGP™s corrective 
arm, this requires a review of the ﬁnominal strategiesﬂ. Under such strategies, 
countries subject to an EDP fall s
hort of their structural effort requirements while 
complying with their nominal headline deficit targets. Consequently, many countries 
exited their EDP after the crisis with still large structural deficits that make them 
vulnerable in a downturn. Second, u
nder the SGP™s preventive arm, 
the application of 
flexibility needs to be 
addressed
.38 According to the common position on flexibility, 
which was endorsed by the ECOFIN Council in early 2016
, budgetary adjustment 
requirements over the economic cycle can be 
modulated according to a matrix 
that
 specifies that larger (smaller) fiscal efforts are required for Member States in economic 
good (bad) times and/or with high (low) levels of 
government 
debt. It also allows 
reduced structural efforts in exchange for addi
tional structural reforms and investment. 
Both a
 special report by the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
in 2018 
on the 
preventive arm of the SGP as well as the 2018 Annual Report of the European Fiscal 
Board (EFB) 
stress that due to 
the cumulative effect
s of different forms of flexibility 
it is 
not ensure
d that Member States, especially high
-debt ones, converge toward their 
MTOs 
with
in a reasonable 
time frame.
 This can 
put them in a precarious position 
when
 the next recession
 comes.
                                                                     38  In May
 2018 the Commission published its review of the flexibility under the SGP that had been 
introduced in 2015. The analysis
 Œ which focuses on the design rather than implementation of rules
 Œ suggests that the modulation of fiscal effort accor
ding to the ﬁmatrix of requirementsﬂ does not reduce the 
standard pace of the necessary fiscal adjustment and therefore supports the achievement of a sound 
budgetary position over the medium term
, thus not weakening debt reduction. However, it also indicat
es 
that the actual fiscal effort of Member States has fallen short of the required 
effort.
