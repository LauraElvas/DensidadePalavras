 2 Economic and monetary
 developments
 Overview
 At its monetary policy meeting on 8 March 2018, the Governing Council
 concluded that an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for 
underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline 
inflation developments over the medium term.
 The information that has become 
available since the previous
 monetary policy meeting in January, including the new 
ECB staff projections, confirmed a strong and broad
-based growth momentum in the 
euro area economy, which is projected to expand in the near term at a somewhat 
faster pace than previously expected. Thi
s outlook for growth confirmed the 
Governing Council™s confidence that inflation will converge towards the inflation aim 
of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, measures of 
underlying inflation remained subdued and have yet to sh
ow convincing signs of a 
sustained upward trend. In this context, the Governing Council will continue 
monitoring developments in the exchange rate and financial conditions with regard to 
their possible implications for the medium
-term outlook for price sta
bility. The 
continued monetary support required for a sustained return of inflation rates towards 
levels that are below, but close to, 2% is provided by the ongoing net asset 
purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming 
reinvestm
ents, and by the forward guidance on interest rates.
 Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 
8 March 2018
 The global economy expanded at an even faster rate in the second half of 2017 
and is providing further impetu
s to euro area exports.
 Global economic activity is 
expected to remain strong going forward, although the pace of growth will gradually 
moderate. Global trade growth is expected to remain sustained in the near term, 
while inflation is expected to rise slow
ly as spare capacity at the global level 
diminishes.
 Amid the ongoing economic expansion, euro area sovereign bond yields have 
increased since mid
-December 2017.
 However, corporate bond spreads have 
remained broadly stable and average sovereign bond spread
s over the overnight 
index swap rate have decreased somewhat overall. Equity prices have declined in 
an environment of heightened volatility. In foreign exchange markets, the euro has 
appreciated in nominal effective terms.
 The euro area economic expansion
 continues to be strong and broad
-based 
across countries and sectors, with real GDP increasing by 0.6% quarter on 
quarter in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 Private consumption is supported by rising 
employment, which is also benefiting from past labour market
 reforms, and by 
growing household wealth. Business investment has continued to strengthen on the

 Overview
 3 back of very favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid 
demand, while housing investment has improved further over recent quart
ers. In 
addition, the broad
-based global expansion is providing impetus to euro area 
exports.
 This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2018 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP 
in the euro area 
increasing by 2.4% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.
 Compared with the December 2017 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic projections, 
the outlook for GDP growth has been revised up in 2018 and remains unchanged 
thereafter. Risks surrounding the growth outlook are assessed as broadly balanced. 
On the one hand, the prevailing cyclical momentum could lead t
o stronger growth in 
the near term. On the other hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to 
global factors, including rising protectionism and developments in foreign exchange 
and other financial markets.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, e
uro area annual HICP inflation 
decreased to 1.2% in February, from 1.3% in January.
 This reflected mainly 
negative base effects in unprocessed food price inflation. Looking ahead, on the 
basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inf
lation are likely to 
hover around 1.5% for the remainder of the year. Measures of underlying inflation 
remained subdued but are expected to rise gradually over the medium term, 
supported by the ECB™s monetary policy measures, the continuing economic 
expans
ion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth.
 The March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.4% in 2018, 1.4% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.
 Compared with the December 2017 E
urosystem staff macroeconomic projections, 
the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised down slightly for 2019 but 
remains unchanged for 2018 and 2020. Declines in HICP energy inflation in 2018 
and 2019 are expected to broadly offset a strength
ening in underlying inflation, with 
HICP inflation excluding energy and food rising from 1.1% in 2018 to 1.5% in 2019 
and 1.8% in 2020.
 The latest staff projections also foresee the euro area budget deficit declining 
further over the projection horizon, ma
inly as a result of favourable cyclical 
conditions and decreasing interest payments.
 The aggregate fiscal stance for the 
euro area is projected to remain on average broadly neutral in 2018
-20. Although the 
euro area government debt
-to
-GDP ratio will contin
ue to decline, it will still remain 
elevated. The current economic expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers.
 The monetary analysis showed broad money continuing to expand at a robust 
pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.6% in January 2018
 Œ unchan
ged from 
the previous month
 Œ reflecting the impact of the ECB™s monetary policy 
measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits.
 Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor 
to broad money gr
owth. At the same time, the recovery in loan growth to the private 
sector progressed. The pass

 Monetary policy decisions
 Based on the regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council 
confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to 
secure a sustained return of i
nflation rates towards levels that are below, but 
close to, 2%.
 The Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates 
unchanged and continues to expect them to remain at their present levels for an 
extended period of time, and well past the hori
zon of the net asset purchases. 
Regarding non
-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council 
confirmed that the net asset purchases are intended to run at the current monthly 
pace of •30 billion until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if nece
ssary, and in 
any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of 
inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The Governing Council also reiterated that 
the Eurosystem will continue to reinvest the principal payments from matur
ing 
securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of 
time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as 
necessary.

 The global economy 
expanded at an even faster rate
 in the 
second half of 2017.
 Global economic activity is expected to remain 
strong 
going forward
, although
 the
 pace 
of growth 
will gradually moderate. The outlook 
for
 advanced economies 
is for
 robust expansion, reinforced by the significant fiscal stimulus in the 
United States. 
For
 emerging market economies
, the outlook is supported by strengthening activity 
among
 commodity exporters. Global trade growth is seen 
to remain
 buoyant in the 
near term
, while 
inflation is expected to rise slowly as spare capacity at the 
global 
level diminishes.
 Global economic activity and trade
 The pace of global economic expansion strengthened in the second half of 
2017. Overall, data releases in this period surprised on the upside in both 
advanced economies and, to a lesser extent, eme
rging market economies 
(EMEs).
 Available GDP data across countries point to a sustained expansion of 
global economic activity in the final quarter of the year. Specifically, US real GDP 
growth proved resilient in the second half of 2017, shaking off the im
pact of the 
hurricanes. Economic activity in Japan also remained brisk, benefiting from policy 
support, solid job creation and recovering external demand. By contrast, real GDP 
growth in the United Kingdom remained relatively muted in 2017, in spite of a 
moderate rebound in the second half of the year. Activity across EMEs has been 
supported by resilient growth in India and China, while the recoveries from deep 
recessions in Brazil and Russia continued, albeit at a very gradual pace.
 Survey
-based indicators
 point to sustained global growth in the near term.
 The 
global composite output Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI), excluding the euro area, 
remained at a similar level in the last quarter of 2017 to that of the previous quarter
 Œ slightly above the first ha
lf of the year and close to the long
-run average
 Œ and improved marginally in January and February, suggesting that global activity 
continued to expand robustly into this year (Chart

 Notes: The latest observations are for February
 2018. ﬁLong
-term averageﬂ refers to the period from January
 1999 to February
 2018. Global financial conditions remain supportive of the global outl
ook but have 
tightened in recent weeks.
 Following a period of buoyant sentiment and large 
increases in equity market valuations, stock markets started to suffer sharp losses at 
the beginning of February, while volatility picked up. The financial market tur
moil 
remained concentrated in equity markets, and the correction, while large, only 
unwound the gains made since the start of the year. However, the market volatility 
came against the background of a steady rise in long
-term yields in the United States 
ove
r the past three months, amid increasing investor nervousness about the inflation 
outlook and potentially faster than expected monetary policy tightening. The Fed 
Funds futures curve has shifted upwards in recent weeks, following last December™s 
rate hike.
 Markets continue to anticipate a gradual tightening and now price in the 
next policy rate increase in March
 2018 and three hikes for the year as a whole
 Œ in 
line with the December projections of the Federal Open Market Committee. Interest 
rate expectatio
ns have also shifted upwards in the United Kingdom, following the 
hawkish tone of the Bank of England™s February Inflation Report. By contrast, the 
Bank of Japan has retained a very accommodative stance, holding ten
-year yields 
close to zero in line with i
ts yield curve control programme. In China, the People™s 
Bank of China sought to curb leverage in the financial system and contain financial 
stability risks with tightened financial conditions in the course of 2017, increasing the 
rates it charges on open
-market operations with a view to guiding interbank rates 
upwards. Among other EMEs, in particular Brazil and Russia, policy rates have been 
lowered further as inflationary pressures have subsided.
 Looking ahead, global economic activity growth is expected 
to remain resilient 
before moderating somewhat over the medium term.
 The outlook for advanced 
economies is for robust expansion, now reinforced by the additional fiscal impact 
emanating from the US tax reform and agreement on increased expenditure by the 
US Congress. However, growth is seen to slow going forward, as the recovery 
matures in some countries and output gaps become more positive. For EMEs, the

 7 outlook is supported by strengthening activity among commodity exporters like Brazil 
and, to a lesser e
xtent, Russia. At the same time, growth remains resilient in India, 
while activity continues to follow a gradual long
-term downward trend in China.
 The pace of global expansion is projected to remain below pre
-crisis levels, in 
line with lower potential gr
owth.
 ECB estimates suggest that the growth potential 
has declined across most advanced and emerging economies in recent years. In 
advanced economies, all components weigh on potential, although this is particularly 
true of labour and total factor producti
vity (TFP) contributions. Capital contributions 
also remain below historical averages, as weakened expectations of growth 
prospects and heightened uncertainty have delayed investment decisions. 
Investment has similarly moderated in EMEs, in commodity
-expor
ting countries in 
particular but also in China in response to its rebalancing process and policy drive to 
contain leverage. However, TFP was the main factor behind the decline in potential 
among EMEs. Overall, potential output growth is expected to remain 
broadly stable 
in advanced economies over the medium term, a slight increase in US potential 
growth in 
2019-20 notwithstanding, while it is expected to continue declining in 
EMEs.
 In the United States, activity is expected to remain robust on the back of s
olid 
domestic demand.
 The ongoing expansion is seen to proceed on the back of solid 
growth in investment and consumer spending, as tight labour market conditions 
gradually feed into higher wage growth and still favourable financial conditions boost 
wealth.
 The approval of tax reform legislation last December and the rise 
in the 
ceilings on government expenditure agreed in February are projected to
 further 
boost domestic demand.
 In the United Kingdom, real GDP growth is expected to remain subdued yet 
resilie
nt.
 Economic activity rebounded moderately in the second half of the 2017, 
having slowed markedly in the first half. Looking ahead, a boost from stronger net 
export growth over the coming quarters and a slight rebound in investment will 
underpin the resili
ence of real GDP growth in the United Kingdom.
 In Japan, the economic expansion is seen to gradually decelerate.
 Economic 
activity is projected to remain relatively solid over the short term, benefiting from the 
current positive momentum and accommodative 
monetary policy stance. Looking 
further ahead, however, growth is expected to gradually slow. Apart from diminishing 
support from fiscal policy and quickly contracting spare capacity, this deceleration 
also reflects a decline in the positive impact of infr
astructure investment related to 
the 2020 Olympics.
 In China, activity continues to expand at a robust pace, supported by strong 
consumption and a still thriving housing market.
 The near
-term outlook is 
dominated by the authorities™ focus on stable growth 
and the mitigation of financial 
risks. The assumption over the medium term is that continued structural reforms will 
gradually be implemented, leading to an orderly growth slowdown.
 Economic activity in central and eastern European countries will remain 
robust, albeit at a more moderate pace than in 2017.
 Economic activity in central

 8 and eastern European countries grew strongly in 2017, driven by a rebound in 
investment and solid private consumption. Looking forward, it is expected to remain 
supported by st
rong investment, linked to the absorption of EU funds, solid 
consumer spending and improvements in the labour market.
 Economic activity is gradually strengthening in the large commodity
-exporting 
countries.
 In Russia, leading indicators signal a temporary 
dip in economic activity 
in the last quarter of 2017, following robust growth in the first half of the year, as 
industrial production declined. Over the medium term, economic activity is expected 
to expand moderately, amid fiscal challenges weighing on the
 business environment, 
weak fixed investment and growth potential undermined by a lack of structural 
reforms. Activity in Brazil should continue recovering. Rising confidence, an 
improved labour market and continuing monetary accommodation should support 
consumption, against the backdrop of inflationary pressures remaining contained. 
Political uncertainty in this election year and a potential reversal of the benign 
external financial conditions are key risks to the country™s improving economic 
outlook.
 Glob
al trade growth prospects are expected to remain sustained in the near 
term.
 While global merchandise import growth momentum receded somewhat in 
December, available country data and leading indicators point to robust growth at the 
turn of 
2017-18. The volu
me of merchandise imports increased by 1% in December 
(in three
-month
-on-three
-month terms), down from 1.6% in the third quarter 
(Chart
 2). Trade activity picked up substantially in the United States, while 
weakening in Asia and central and eastern Europe.

 9 expansion of global trade
 Œ including trade liberalisation, reductions in tariffs and 
transportation costs and the expansion of global value chains
 Œ have waned since 
the financial crisis. Uncertainty about these longer
-term factors is clearly high and, in 
some instances
, data are scarce. But the available evidence would suggest that the 
projection for imports to grow in line with activity over the medium
 term remains a 
reasonable baseline
. Overall, global growth is projected to remain broadly stable over the projection 
horizon.
 According to the March
 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, world 
real GDP growth (excluding the euro area) is expected to 
increase 
from 3.8% in 
2017 to 4.1% in 2018 
before
 declin
ing
 to 3.9% and 3.7% in 2019 and 2020 
respectively
. 
This projection path reflects the anticipated slowdown in activity 
in advanced economies
 in general
, 
and the U
nited 
States
 in particular, partly offs
et by a 
modest gain in dynamism in EMEs
. Growth in euro area foreign demand is forecast 
to 
expand by 
4.7% in 2018, 4.1% in 2019 and 3.6% in 2020
. Compared with the 
December
 2017 projections, 
global GDP 
growth has been
 revised upwards 
for
 2017-19, while gro
wth in euro area foreign demand has been revised 
upwards 
over 
the whole projection horizon, in both cases 
mostly reflecting the impact of the 
additional fiscal stimulus in the United States
. Although on the upside in the short term, risks to the outlook fo
r global 
activity remain skewed to the downside in the medium term.
 On the upside, the 
broadening of the global recovery could lead to stronger investment and trade in the 
short term, while the US fiscal package could have a stronger impact on activity tha
n currently 
anticipated. 
Over the medium
 term, 
however, 
these factors are seen to be 
outweighed by 
downside risks
 such as an increase in trade protectionism, a sudden 
financial market correction
 Œ which would result in a tightening of global financial 
conditions
 Œ disruptions associated with China™s reform and liberalisation process, 
and political and geopolitical uncertainties
 associated with 
Brexit
-related risks
 in 
particular.
 Global price developments
 Global consumer price inflation has declined 
slightly of late, while wage 
developments have remained subdued.
 Following
 a slight increase in November
, 
annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area slowed in December
 and in 
January, to 2.2%
. This resulted from a slight deceleration in energy price
 rise
s, 
although 
still close to
 5%, while food price inflation 
remained stable
. Excluding food 
and energy, OECD annual inflation 
declined marginally to 1.8% (Chart
 3). 
Turning to
 wages, compensation per employee remained broadly unchanged at very low levels
 (rising 
1.5% year
-on-year)
, in spite of
 a further decline in the
 OECD unemployment 
rate in the third quarter (
to 
below 6%). Only hourly earnings in the manufacturing 
sector show a swift upward trend, more in line with the 
tightening
 of the 
labo
ur 
market.

 Note: The latest observation is for January
 2018. Brent crude oil prices have declined somewhat over the last few weeks, from 
USD
 70 per
 barrel on 23 January to USD
 66 on 22 February.
 This recent decline 
was underpinned by record US crude production, high compliance with the 
OPEC/non
-OPEC agreement to reduce supply and the end of the pipeline disruption 
suffered during December and January
 Œ notably including the return of the North 
Sea pipeline to full capacity. Oil futures suggest that oil prices will fall below current 
levels, to around USD
 65 per barrel in 2018 and USD
 61 per barrel in 2019. Non

ightly in recent weeks, with food prices 
rising by 3.5% and metal prices by 1.6%.
 Looking ahead, global inflation is expected to rise slowly.
 In the short term, 
inflation is seen to increase following the recent pick
-up in oil prices. Thereafter, the 
slowly diminishing spare capacity at the global level is projected to further support 
underlying inflation. However, the rise in inflation is seen
 to be moderated by a 
negative contribution from energy prices to inflation, as currently implied by an oil 
futures curve that anticipates falling oil prices over the medium term.

 11 2 Financial developments
 Since the Governing Council™s meeting in December 2
017 euro area sovereign bond 
yields have increased, against the background of the ongoing economic expansion. 
As inflation expectations have remained broadly stable, 
real 
interest 
rates
 have 
recorded a corresponding rise.
 Although corporate earnings expect
ations have 
improved, equity prices have declined in an environment of heightened volatility. At 
the same time, c
orporate bond spreads 
have remained broadly stable. Average 
sovereign bond spreads vis
-à-vis the overnight index swap (OIS) rate have 
decreased
 somewhat overall. 
In foreign exchange markets, the euro
 has appreciated 
in nominal effective terms
. Long-term government bond yields have increased on both sides of the 
Atlantic since mid
-December.
 During the period under review (from 
14 December
 2017 to 
7 March
 2018) the GDP
-weighted euro area ten
-year 
sovereign bond yield increased by 28
 basis points, to 1.13% (see Chart
 4). In the 
United States and the United Kingdom, long
-term government bond yields increased 
by 53
 basis points and 33
 basis points, to 
2.88% and 1.50% respectively. The euro 
area ten
-year OIS rate increased by 31
 basis points
 to stand at 0.90%,
 mainly driven 
by an increase in the long
-term real 
interest 
rate. Overall, bond market developments 
on both sides of the Atlantic reflect improvin
g market expectations of economic 
growth and inflation, as well as revisions to expectations regarding the associated 
monetary policy reaction.

 13 The EONIA 
recorded an 
average
 of -36 basis points during the review period.
 Excess liquidity increased by about •5
 billion to stand at around •1,885
 billion. 
Growth in net autonomous factors was more than 
offset by the liquidity provided 
through purchases under the Eurosystem™s asset purchase programme. Liquidity 
conditions are discussed in more detail in Box
 3. Equity market volatility increased towards the end of the review period.
 While 
equity prices inc
reased from mid
-December 2017 to the end of January 2018, a 
relatively sharp price correction and a spike in volatility 
were
 observed in early 
February (see Chart
 7). The correction was most likely triggered by market 
perceptions of rising inflation, espec
ially in the United States, and a corresponding 
adjustment in monetary policy expectations. Part of the decline in equity prices was 
subsequently reversed, but uncertainty following announcements regarding US trade 
policy triggered a renewed decline in sto
ck markets on both sides of the Atlantic in 
early March. Overall, in the review period the equity prices of euro area non
-financial 
corporations (NFCs) fell by 2.7%, while financial sector equities declined by only 
1.5%. In the United States, despite the c
orrection, both financial and non
-financial 
equity indices increased, gaining 6.4% and 3.1% respectively. Overall, euro area 
stock market
 development
s continued to be driven by solid earnings expectations, 
while higher risk

 equity risk premia weighed 
negatively on equity prices.

 The euro are
a economic expansion continues to be strong and broad
-based across 
countries and sectors. Real GDP growth is supported by growth in private 
consumption and investment as well as exports benefitting from the broad
-based 
global recovery. The latest survey re
sults and incoming data confirm strong and 
broad
-based growth momentum in the 
euro area economy, which is projected to 
expand in the near term at a somewhat faster pace than previously expected
. 
Compared with the December
 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomi
c projections, 
the GDP growth 
outlook for 
2018
 was revised upwards in 
the March
 2018 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections, 
while the outlook 
remain
ed unchanged 
for 
2019 and 
2020. Euro area real GDP is 
projected 
to grow by 2.5% in 2017, 2.4% in 2018, 1.9% 
in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.
 Growth remained robust in the fourth quarter of 2017and continued to be 
broad
-based across countries.
 Real GDP increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, 
in the fourth quarter of last year (see Chart
 10). Real GDP growth was driven by n
et 
trade
 and domestic demand, particularly fixed investment spending, whereas 
changes in inventories provided a negative contribution. The second release of GDP 
data left quarterly real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 unrevised, 
confirming that th
e preliminary flash estimate continues to be a reliable measure 
(see the box entitled ﬁThe reliability of the preliminary flash estimate of euro area 
GDPﬂ in this issue of the Economic Bulletin). Output growth in the fourth quarter led 
to a yearly rise in 
GDP of 2.3% in 2017 (2.5% in working day
-adjusted terms). 
Economic indicators suggest that the pattern of broad and robust growth has 
continued at the beginning of this year.

 17 Euro area labour markets continue to exhibit strong dynamics.
 Employment 
rose further, by 0.4%, quarter on
 quarter, in the third quarter of 2017, resulting in an 
annual increase of 1.7%. Employment currently stands 1.2% above the pre
-crisis 
peak recorded in the first quarter of 2008. Total hours worked also continued to 
recover, although average hours worked p
er person employed have remained 
broadly stable since the recovery started. Both full
-time and part
-time employment 
have risen during the recovery. In the case of part
-time employment, the increase 
has mainly been in non
-underemployed part
-time workers, wh
ile the number of 
underemployed part
-time workers has declined recently (see the box entitled 
ﬁRecent developments in part
-time employmentﬂ in this issue of the Economic 
Bulletin). The unemployment rate in the euro area stood at 8.6% in January
 2018, 
which
 is its lowest level since December
 2008 (see Chart
 11). The decline has been 
broad
-based across age and gender groups. Long
-term unemployment (the number 
of people who have been unemployed for at least 12 months expressed as a 
percentage of the labour for
ce) has also continued to fall, but remains well above its 
pre
-crisis levels. Survey information points to continued improvements in labour 
market conditions in the period ahead. At the same time, there are increasing signs 
of labour shortages in some coun
tries and sectors. Income growth remained strong 
in the third quarter of 2017.

 Improving labour markets continue to support income growth and private 
spending. Private consumption grew by 0.
2% in the fourt

leading to an annual increase of 
1.5
%. The ratio of household saving to 
disposable income remained low in the third quarter of 2017, reaching its lowest 
value since 1999, which continues to support private consumption. The ECB™s 
monetary
 policy measures, which have eased financing conditions, also remain 
supportive of household spending. Rising real incomes continue to support private 
consumption growth as compensation of employees remains the key component of 
private consumption growth (
see Chart
 12).

Consumption and disposable income are deflated with the consumption
 deflator. The latest observations are for the third quarter of 
2017. Growth in construction investment picked up strongly in 2017, and this 
recovery is expected to continue in 2018.
 Construction production plateaued in 
the fourth quarter of 2017, but incr
eased by 2.2% overall in 2017. Survey indicators 
on construction activity continue to signal robust growth momentum. Confidence in 
the building construction segment improved in December
 2017 and January
 2018. 
The construction Purchasing Managers™ Index (PM
I) for January came out at 57.0, 
up from 53.3 in December. This is the sharpest increase since February
 2011. At the 
same time, in January the European Commission survey indicator on labour 
shortages in the construction sector rose even further from an alr
eady high level.
 From a cyclical perspective, the level of housing investment still remains 
subdued.
 Employment in the construction sector and real residential investment fell 
sharply following their pre
-crisis peaks in the third quarter of 2007 (see Chart
 13), 
and, whilst residential investment has recovered somewhat (by 10% since the 
second quarter of 2015), the pick
-up in construction employment has been much 
weaker (up 2%). The relatively weak recovery in the volume of housing investment 
reflects pre
-crisis overinvestment in some euro area countries, as well as remaining 
deleveraging pressures on households. Looking forward, housing investment is 
expected to increasingly support GDP growth.

housing investment.
 Growth in non
-constru
ction investment picked up in the fourth quarter of 2017 
and this recovery is expected to have continued in early 2018.
 The gross 
operating surplus accelerated considerably in the third quarter of 2017, according to 
the sectoral accounts. This is particula
rly relevant for intangible assets, which rely 
more on internal financing. The European Commission survey also shows that 
perceived capacity utilisation in the capital goods producing sector reached close to 
all
-time highs both in the euro area and across 
the largest euro area countries in the 
first quarter of 2018 (see Chart
 14). According to the same survey, this feature is also 
reflected in increasing constraints on production in the capital goods producing 
sector related to both equipment and labour.
 In
 2018 as a whole, business investment is expected to continue contributing 
to output growth.
 Strong demand and earnings growth should continue to support 
business investment, despite recent volatility in equity markets. Looking more closely 
at recent equit
y price developments for euro area non
-financial corporations, the 
recent volatility appears to be related more to higher expected interest rates and risk 
premia than to a downward revision of earnings expectations. To the extent that a 
large part of inves
tment is financed with retained earnings, the immediate impact on 
business investment may not be very significant.

data.
 Overall, the latest economic indicators point to strong growth momentum in 
the euro area, which is projected to expand in the near term at a somewhat 
faster pace than previously expected.
 Industrial production (excluding 
construction) increased by 1.5%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
More recent survey data also signal solid growth dynamics in the near term. The 
European Commission™s
 Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) and the composite 
output PMI stood higher on average in the first two months of 2018 than in the fourth 
quarter of 2017, remaining well above long
-run average levels.
 The ongoing strong and broad
-based economic growth is
 projected to 
continue. The ECB™s monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the 
deleveraging process, continue to underpin domestic demand.
 Private 
consumption is supported by rising employment, which is also benefiting from past 
labour market refor
ms, and by growing household wealth. Business investment 
continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, rising 
corporate profitability and solid demand. Housing investment has improved further 
over recent quarters. In addition
, the broad
-based global expansion is providing 
impetus to euro area exports.
 The March
 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.5% in 2017, 2.4% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 
and 1.7% in 2020 (see Chart
 16). Compared with the December 2017 projections, 
real GDP growth has been revised up for 2018 and remains unchanged for 2019

The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are assessed as broadly 
balanced.

 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual
 HICP inflation declined to 
1.2% in February
 2018, from 1.3% in January
. 
Looking ahead, on the basis of 
current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover 
around 1.5% for the remainder of the year.
 Measures of underlying
 inflation 
remain
ed subdued 
but 
are expected to rise gradually over the medium term, 
supported by 
the ECB™s 
monetary policy
 measures
, the continuing economic 
expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth.
 This assessment 
is also broadly reflected in the 
March
 2018 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 
1.4
% in 2018, 
1.4
% in 2019 and 
1.7
% in 2020
, and HICP inflation excluding energy 
and food at 1.1%, 1.5% and 1.8% respe
ctively.
 Headline inflation decreased slightly in February.
 According to Eurostat™s flash 
estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation declined to 1.2% in February
 2018, from 
1.3% in January, remaining below the levels recorded at the end of 2017 (see 
Chart
 17). The February decline reflected mainly lower unprocessed food price 
inflation, driven largely by base effects.

 (annual percentage changes)

 Notes: The range of underlying measures consists o
f the following: HICP excluding energy; HICP excluding unprocessed food and 
energy; HICP excluding food and energy; HICP excluding food, energy, travel
-related items and clothing; the 10% trimmed mean; the 
30% trimmed mean;
 and the median of the HICP. The 
latest observations are for 
February
 2018 (HICP excluding food and energy
 Œ flash estimate) and 
January
 2018 (all other measures).
 Price pressures for non
-energy industrial goods in the HICP remained 
subdued overall. 
Global non
-energy producer price inflat
ion eased somewhat 
further in January but remained at an elevated level. Recent developments in both oil 
and raw materials prices in annual terms suggest also an easing 
of early stage price 
pressures going forward (see Chart
 19). Downward price pressures f
rom the euro™s 
appreciation are, however, so far mainly visible in lower import price inflation. For 
intermediate goods, import price inflation declined to 2.1% in December 2017 
Œ from 
3.1% in November
Œ while
, for non
-food consumer goods
, import price infl
ation 
remained at 
-0.8% 
Œ unchanged from November. In the case of domestic sales, 
developments in producer prices appear thus far unaffected by any appreciation 
impact associated with cheaper imported inputs. Notably, producer price inflation for 
non-food 
consumer goods increased from 0.4% in December
 2017 to 0.6% in 
January
 2018, its highest level since December
 2012. The same holds true at the 
level of consumer goods prices: despite downward pressures from lower price 
inflation for imported final goods, H
ICP non
-energy industrial goods inflation 
continued to increase. In February
 2018 it stood 
Œ according to Eurostat™s flash

. Recent developments support the notion of a gradual upward trend in wage 
growth and the notion of a gra
dual built
-up in domestic cost pressures. 
Annual 
growth in compensation per employee rose from a low of 1.1% in the second quarter 
of 2016 to 1.6% in the third quarter of 2017
2. This increase reflected mainly higher 
contributions from wage drift, which 
usually reacts to cyclical developments with a 
shorter lag than negotiated wages. Annual growth in negotiated wages increased 
only slightly to 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017, from 1.5% in the third quarter, but 
recent wage settlements in euro area coun
tries point to a pick
-up going forward. 
While recent developments in wage growth are in line with improving labour market 
conditions, they may still be weighed down by
 factors such as past low inflation, 
weak productivity growth and the ongoing impact of l
abour market reforms 
implemented in certain countries during the crisis.
 Both market
-based and survey
-based measures of longer
-term inflation 
expectations have remained stable.
 The five
-year forward inflation
-linked swap 
rate five years ahead stood at 1.71
% on 7
 March
 2018, broadly unchanged 
from
 mid
-December but slightly below the level observed at the end of January (see 
Chart
 20). The forward profile of market
-based measures of inflation expectations 
continues to point to a prolonged period of low inflat
ion, with only a very gradual 
return to levels below, but close to, 2%. The risk
-neutral probability of negative 
average inflation over the next five years, implied by inflation options markets, is 
negligible and hence suggests that markets currently consi
der the risk of deflation to 
be very small. According to the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the first 
quarter of 2018, measures of longer
-term inflation expectations have remained 
broadly stable, standing at 1.85%.

 Note: The latest observations are for 
7 March
 2018. According to t
he March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections
, HICP 
inflation 
is expected 
to rise
 only towards the end of the projection horizon.
 On 
the basis of the information available at mid
-February, the projections foresee euro 
area annual HICP inflation at 1.4% in 2018, 1.4
 % in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020 (see 
Chart
 21), implying a slight downward r
evision in 2019 compared with the December 
2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.
3 Declines in HICP energy 
inflation in 2018 and 2019 are expected to broadly offset a strengthening in 
underlying inflation, with HICP inflation excluding energy and
 food rising from 1.1% 
in 2018 to 1.5% in 2019 and 
to 
1.8% in 2020. Important factors behind the gradual 
pick
-up in underlying inflation are further improvements in euro area labour market 
conditions, with increasing labour market tightness and notable lab
our supply 
shortages in some parts of the euro area. Although the recent strengthening of the 
euro exchange rate is expected to have a downward impact on inflation, this should 
be counterbalanced to some extent by the current strong growth momentum in the 
euro area, given the related greater pricing power of euro area companies.

 In January
 2018 broad m
oney growth 
continued to expand
 at the 
robust pace
 generally 
observed
 since mid
-2015. 
At the same time, t
he recovery in loan growth to 
the private sector
 progressed
. 
The annual flow of total external financing to non
-financial corporations (NFCs) is estimated to have 
strengthened
 in the 
fourth
 quarter 
of 2017.
 Growth in broad money remained robust at 4.6% in Jan
uary
 2018, in line with 
the steady pace of monetary expansion since mid
-2015 (see Chart
 22).
 Money 
growth was supported by the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid 
instruments in an environment of very low interest rates, as well as by the impac
t of 
the ECB™s monetary policy measures. The most liquid components remained the 
main contributor to broad money growth, with the annual growth rate of M1 edging 
upwards to 8.9% in January (from 8.7% in December
 2017), following a decline in 
the preceding 
months.

 Notes: Loans are adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling. The latest observation is for
 January
 2018. Overnight deposits continued to be the main driver of M3 growth.
 Specifically, 
the annual growth rate of overnight deposits held by households and NFCs remained 
robust in January, though continued to moderate. By contrast, the volatile annua
l growth rate of overnight deposits held by non
-monetary financial institutions 
registered a strong increase in January, supporting M1 growth over the month. The 
annual growth rate of currency in circulation decreased slightly in January, thereby 
continuin
g to indicate no strong tendency on the part of the money
-holding sector to 
substitute deposits with cash in an environment of very low or negative interest rates. 
Short
-term deposits other than overnight deposits (i.e.
 M2 minus M1) continued to 
have a neg
ative impact on M3. The annual rate of change of marketable instruments 
(i.e.
 M3 minus M2)
 Œ a small component of M3
 Œ was again
 negative in this period. 
This development was driven by the small negative contribution of money market

 29 well as a further decline in monetary financial institutions™ (MFIs) issuance of 
short
-term debt securities.
 Domestic sources of money creation remained the main driver of broad money 
growth (s
ee Chart
 23).
 From a counterpart perspective, an increased contribution to 
M3 growth from an increase in credit to the private sector partly compensated for a 
decline in purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) as a result of the 
reduction in net
 purchases by the Eurosystem of •30
 billion per month as of 
January
 2018. The Eurosystem™s purchases of general government debt securities 
(see the red parts of the bars in Chart
 23), conducted mainly in the context of the 
ECB™s public sector purchase prog
ramme (PSPP), continued to contribute positively 
to M3 growth, while the ongoing recovery in credit to the private sector (see the blue 
parts of the bars in Chart
 23) increasingly supported M3 growth. The latter includes 
both MFI loans to the private secto
r and MFI holdings of debt securities issued by 
the euro area private non
-MFI sector. As such, it also covers the Eurosystem™s 
purchases of non
-MFI debt securities under the corporate sector purchase 
programme (CSPP). The persistent contraction in MFIs™ lo
nger-term financial 
liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) contributed positively to M3 growth 
(included alongside other counterparts in the dark green parts of the bars in 
Chart
 23). Government bond sales from euro area MFIs excluding the Eurosystem
 contributed to the negative annual growth of credit to general government by MFIs 
excluding the Eurosystem and thus dampened M3 growth (see the light green parts 
of the bars in Chart
 23). Finally, MFIs™ net external assets (see the yellow parts of the 
bars in Chart
 23) continued to weigh on annual M3 growth.

lending rates seen across the euro area since summer 2014 (notably owing to the 
ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy measures) and overall improvements in the 
supply of, and demand for, bank loans have supported these trends. In ad
dition, 
banks have made progress in consolidating their balance sheets and reducing non

and may continue to constrain financial intermediation.

since the ECB™s credit easing measures were announced in June
 2014. This signals 
an improvement in the pas
s-through of monetary policy measures to bank lending 
rates. The decrease in banks™ composite funding costs has supported the decline in 
composite lending rates. Between May
 2014 and January
 2018, composite lending 
rates on loans to NFCs and households fel
l by 126
 basis points and 108
 basis points 
respectively. The reduction in bank lending rates on NFC loans was particularly 
strong in vulnerable euro area countries, supporting a more homogeneous 
transmission of monetary policy to such rates across countrie
s. Over the same 
period, the spread between interest rates charged on very small loans (loans of up to 
•0.25
 million) and those charged on large loans 
(loans of above •1
 million)
 in the 
euro area narrowed considerably. This indicates that small and medium
-sized 
enterprises have generally benefited to a greater extent from the decline in bank 
lending rates than large companies.

 Notes: The indicator for the total cost of bank borrowing is calculated by aggr
egating short and long
-term rates using a 24
-month 
moving average of new business volumes. The cross
-country standard deviation is calculated using a fixed sample of 12 euro area 
countries. The latest observation is for 
January
 2018. The annual flow of tot
al external financing to euro area NFCs is estimated to 
have strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 This reflects further 
improvements in bank lending dynamics and base effects. Overall, the recovery in 
NFCs™ external financing, observed since early 2
014, has been supported by the 
strengthening of economic activity, further declines in the cost of debt financing, the 
easing of bank lending conditions and larger numbers of mergers and acquisitions. 
At the same time, NFCs™ record high
 Œ and increasing
 Œ cash holdings have reduced 
the need for external financing.
 Net issuance of debt securities by NFCs became more moderate in the fourth 
quarter of 2017.
 Although positive in October and November, net issuance was 
negative in December. However, market data suggest that issuance activity 
strengthened again in January and has remained at robust levels in February. Net 
issuance of listed shares by NFCs remain
ed subdued in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 NFCs™ cost of financing has increased slightly since January.
 The overall 
nominal cost of external financing for NFCs, comprising bank lending, debt issuance 
in the market and equity finance, edged up by around 15
 basis points to 4.6% in 
February, after remaining stable during the previous several months. Most of the 
increase since January
 2018 can be accounted for by the increase in costs of 
market
-based debt and equity financing. While the current cost of external
 financing 
is around 50
 basis points above the historic low of July
 2016, it remains lower than 
the level seen in mid
-2014 when market expectations of the introduction of the public 
sector purchase programme (PSPP) began to emerge.

 According to the March
 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, t
he euro area 
budget deficit is 
expected 
to 
decline
 further over the projection horizon (201
7-20). 
The improving fiscal outlook 
mainly result
s from
 favourable 
cyclical conditions and 
decreasing
 interest payments
, while discretionary consolidation measures are 
limited. T
he aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is projected to 
remain on 
average broadly neutral in 
2018-20. 
Although the e
uro area government debt
-to
-GDP ratio
 will continue to dec
line
, it will still remain elevated.
 In particular the 
countries with high debt levels would 
benefit from
 rebuilding fiscal buffers.
 The euro area general government budget deficit is projected to decline over 
the projection horizon.
 Based on the March
 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections,
5 the general government deficit ratio for the euro area is expected to 
decrease gradually from 1% of GDP in 2017 to 0.3% of GDP in 2020 (see Table
 1). 
The improvement in the fiscal outlook, which is slightly stronger 
than in the 
December
 2017 projections, is mainly driven by favourable cyclical conditions and 
declining interest payments.

 35 2019-20, as t
he expansionary measures 
on the revenue side are projected t
o be 
entirely offset by 
further restraint in government spending. 
This suggests that euro 
area countries do not envisage making use of the more solid and maturing economic 
expansion to build up fiscal buffers. As discussed in the box entitled ﬁ
Fiscal polic
y stance during past periods of expansion
ﬂ in this issue of the Economic Bulletin, fiscal 
policies during good economic times have generally been insufficiently 
countercyclical in the expansionary phase before the financial crisis.
 The high euro area gover
nment debt levels are expected to continue falling.
 The 
average 
euro area debt
-to
-GDP ratio, which peaked in 2014, 
is projected to 
decline from 86.7% of GDP in 2017 to 79.7% of GDP by the end of 2020
. The reduction in the average euro area debt ratio is su
pported
 by 
ongoing increases in 
primary surpluses and favourable interest rate
-growth rate differential
s on account of 
the overall favourable
 macroeconomic outlook
. Compared to the December 
projections, the outlook for the average debt ratio has improved, 
reflecting a 
downward base effect from 2017 and slightly higher contributions from the interest 
rate
-growth rate differentials. The behaviour of the average euro area debt
-to
-GDP 
ratio masks, however, important cross
-countries differences.
 While in 
the maj
ority of 
euro area countries
 the debt ratio is expected to decline
, 
it will increase in 
a few 
countries. 
In p
articular in the case of high
-debt countries,
 further consolidation 
efforts
 Œ in full compliance with the
 Stability and Growth Pact
 Œ are essential
 to set 
the debt ratio firmly on
 a downward path
 and to make public finances less
 vulnerable
 to any renewed financial market instability or a rapid rebound in interest rates.
 This is 
also supported by the analysis of the European Commission in its recently
 published 
ﬁDebt Sustainability Monitor 2017
ﬂ, which finds fiscal sustainability risks in several 
Member States in the medium to long term. In this respect, pension 
reforms are not 
only helpful for long
-term fiscal sustainability, but can generally also help to dampen 
the potentially adverse long
-term macroeconomic effects of ageing, as discussed in 
the article entitled ﬁThe economic impact of population ageing and pe
nsion reformsﬂ 
in this issue of the Economic Bulletin.

 the contributions of oil supply,

 A second, even more relevant factor 
driving
 the increase in oil prices is the 
effectiveness of the strategy adopted by OPEC and some non
-OPEC countries 
to curb their production
 of oil
. In November
 2016, OPEC and some non
-OPEC 
countries agreed to restrict t
heir oil production in an effort to put a floor under oil 
prices. The Declaration of Cooperation initially covered the period up to 
June
 2017 before being extended to 
March
 2018 in May
 2017 and to December
 2018 in 
November
 2017. The success of this strateg
y depends mainly on 
two
 factors: 
compliance with the agreement 
and the reaction of US oil production.
 Compliance with the agreement was 
fairly
 strong in the second half of 2017.
 Chart
 C shows the change in oil production for OPEC countries (dark blue bars)
 and non-OPEC countries participating in the agreement (red bars) together with the cuts 
they each agreed. Compliance was stronger during the second half of 2017, thus 
boosting the credibility of the agreement and helping to push up oil prices. The 
higher 
rate of compliance by OPEC and non
-OPEC participants over this period saw 
production cut by an additional 0.4
 mb/d compared with the level observed between 
January and June
 2017. Furthermore, recent developments suggest that these 
countries will persist wi
th their policy of curbing production, to the end of 2018 and 
possibly beyond.
 At the same time, oil production in the United States (light blue bars in 
Chart
 C) has picked up
, most noticeably in the second half of 2017
, partly 
offsetting the effect of stronger compliance with the agreement.
 Other countries 
have also increased their production since October
 2016.8 According to data from 
Rystad Energy, investment in the US shale oil industry rose in 2017 and is expected 
to
 continue growing over the coming years. As long as the oil price does not fall 
                                                                    8  In the November
 2016 agreement to cut production, October
 2016 levels are used as a reference base 
for the adjustment of crude oil production, except for Angola, for
 which the baseline is September
 2016.

 The persistent decline in 
inventories 
(see Chart
 D) suggests that oil markets 
are becoming tighter, putting further upward pressure 
on oil prices and 
explaining why the futures curve has shifted into backwardation
. When 
inventories are low, the convenience yield (i.e. the benefit of storing oil) is high, 
causing the spot price, all else being equal, to rise relative to the futures pric
e. This 
means that in a
 backwardation scenario 
the slope of 
the futures curve 
tends to be 
steeper when inventories are low
. Th
e crucial role 
played by
 inventories explains 
why markets react so strongly to surprises in inventory data, especially in the Unit
ed States. For instance, if inventories decline more than the markets anticipate, prices 
tend to increase owing to expectations of a rebalancing in the market, as occurred in 
the fourth quarter of 2017.

 Turning to the third factor affecting prices, a number of geopolitical events and 
production outages occurred in the second half of 2017
 that
 help
ed to push up 
oil prices.
 Political turmoil in Venezuela, together with a deteriorating oil networ
k and the imposition of US financial sanctions, led to a further decline of around 
0.4
 mb/d in the country™s production of oil in the second half of 2017 (see Chart
 E). 
Iran was also affected by political unrest in December. While this episode was short
-lived, and its impact on production was marginal, it raised concerns about the 
possibility of the United States taking a tougher political stance on Iran and re
-imposing sanctions in the medium term. In addition, summer maintenance work 
reduced oil productio
n in Russia, Mexico and the North Sea. Finally, a pipeline 
explosion in Libya led to a reduction of 0.1
 mb/d in oil production for one week in 
December, 
while
 the closure of the Forties pipeline in the North Sea for repairs 
reduced oil supply by about 0.25
 mb/d from mid
-December to mid
-January. These 
geopolitical factors and production outages, most of which are presumably 
temporary in nature, are reflected in the positive contribution of oil supply to the 
increase in oil prices shown in Chart
 B. Looking ah
ead, the uncertain geopolitical 
situations in Venezuela and Iran may affect oil prices and cause volatility to spike 
slightly in the short term.

 E OPEC oil production
 (monthly change in thousand barrels per day)
  Sources: IEA and ECB staff calculati
ons.
 Overall, while some of the drivers of the oil price increase since mid
-2017 appear to be temporary in nature, other factors are expected to have more 
lasting effects, in particular shale oil production and the agreement reached by 
OPEC and non
-OPEC pr
oducers to tighten the market.
 Oil prices declined slightly 
in February as temporary factors, such as the shutdown of pipelines and political 
unrest in Iran, receded. An unexpected increase in US crude oil inventories and an 
upward revision of projected US
 crude oil production for the next few years have cast 
doubt on the ability of demand to keep pace with increasing supply. Against this 
background, the success of OPEC™s strategy will depend on not only the 
commitment of its members, which proved to be pre
tty strong over the second half of 
2017, but also the speed with which oil production in non
-participating countries 
reacts. In particular, this concerns the United States, where the average break
-even 
price is around USD 50
 per barrel.

 41 2 Euro area sovereign bond market liquidity 
since the start
 of the PSPP
 Prepared 
by Linas Jurkıas, Daniel Kapp, Ken Nyholm and Julian Von 
Landesberger
 The liquidity of euro area sovereign bond markets is important for the transmission of 
the ECB™s monetary p
olicy. In particular, a high degree of liquidity fosters the link 
between the ECB™s monetary policy decisions, the yield curve, financial asset prices 
in general, and the overall cost and flow of finance in the economy. The liquidity of 
sovereign bond mark
ets 
needs to be monitored more closely
 since the 
implementation of the ECB™s public sector purchase programme (PSPP), under 
which a significant share of outstanding euro area sovereign bonds has been 
bought. Against this background, this box presents some 
of the market liquidity 
indicators that the ECB monitors regularly. Overall, the indicators suggest that 
liquidity conditions in sovereign bond markets have not deteriorated since the start of 
the PSPP (
on 9 March
 2015).
 A liquid market is typically charac
terised as one 
in which
 the execution of a 
standard transaction has a limited 
impact on 
price
s. In other words, a liquid 
market has ﬁdeepﬂ order books, which are quickly replenished once a trade has been 
executed. As a result, price changes following a trade would be minimal and 
temporary. Naturally, if an executed trade is believed to provide new i
nformation 
about the fundamental 
value
 of the asset being traded, there would be a 
commensurate adjustment in ask and bid prices, but the order book around the new 
levels would still remain deep.
 Market liquidity indicators commonly 
focus on
 one or more 
aspects of
 the 
cost 
of transaction
s, market depth and/or resiliency.
 The simplest indicator is the 
quoted bid
-ask spread, which provides information on how costly a transaction can 
be expected to be. More informative indicators can be constructed by combinin
g spread information with, for example, order book depth, which is a gauge for the 
volume of transactions that the market can absorb at a given point in time. Measures 
of market depth 
are 
typically 
based
 on information obtained from 
limit order book
s,10 whi
ch are
 the volume and price schedules available to traders. Resiliency is a 
function of market dynamics, such as how long it takes for order books to be refilled 
after a trade has been executed, i.e. 
it focuses on the time dimension of market 
liquidity.
 In
 this box we analyse euro area sovereign bond market liquidity based on 
three indicators: the Amihud indicator, an order book liquidity indicator and an 
execution
-based liquidity indicator.
 Although these three indicators are 
based on
 different 
sets
 of mar
ket data (respectively actual transactions executed in the market, 
limit order book
s and quotes), the
y mainly focus on 
the 
cost and depth dimensions of 
liquidity.
                                                                     10  A limit order

 Euro area sovereign bond market liquidity since the start of the PSPP
 42 The Amihud indicator is widely used. It works by comparing 
absolute 
price 
changes with traded
 volumes.
11 It 
is defined for a given bond as the ratio between 
the 
absolute 
price change and the 
traded
 volume over a certain interval of time. A 
practical 
problem encountered
 when applying the Amihud indicator to government 
bonds is that most trades take 
place in the over
-the
-counter (OTC) market, 
therefore,
 price and volume 
data on transactions are difficult to obtain, especially on 
an intraday basis. Moreover, the indicator does not account for the fact that bond prices 
may, of course, change for reasons
 other than a
 lack of liquidity. To overcome these 
issues
, for 
the variant 
considered in this box
 it is 
assume
d that the daily 
traded
 volume (on which data 
are
 readily 
available) is spread evenly 
throughout
 the day, 
and the observed 
absolute 
price change 
is adjusted to eliminate the effect of the 
general market trend. 
As this indicator focuses on two dimensions of liquidity (i.e. 
cost and depth), it is often useful for determining which aspect is the driver of liquidity 
developments in particular time peri
ods. 
The euro area aggregate indicator is 
calculated by 
first 
averaging the values of Amihud indicators 
for
 all PSPP
-eligible 
sovereign bonds 
of a
 particular country and 
then
 weighting
 the 
composite 
country 
indicators by 
the 
respective GDP sizes.
 The order
 book liquidity indicator is based on data on bid
-ask spreads and 
quoted quantities obtained from limit order books.
 There is 
thus
 no need 
for 
data 
on actual transactions
. However, this indicator is
 dependent
 on how representative 
the limit order
 book 
is o
f the market
. 
It
 is calculated for a particular bond as the sum 
of the five best quotes on 
both the ask side and the bid
 side of the order
 book, divided by the sum of the corresponding quoted volumes. This is illustrated 
by the 
following
 equation:

ﬁfrozen
ﬂ for calculation purposes, 
ﬁPﬂ is the price, and 
ﬁAsk
ﬂ and 
ﬁBid
ﬂ indicate 
on which side of the 
order book
 the 
price is observed. The variable 
ﬁQﬂ is the quantity that can be traded at a given 
quoted price and 
ﬁjﬂ denotes
 the 
order of 
priority of the offers in the limit order
 book 
(from 
the fir
st to 
the fif
th best 
ask and b
id price
s with
 the
 corresponding quantit
ies
). 
The indicator is calculated for 
the second
-most recently issued ten
-year sovereign 
bond of each country 
and the results are 
then 
weighted
 by 
the 
GDP sizes of 
the 
respective countries to 
obtain
 a euro area aggregate indi
cator.
 The execution
-based liquidity indicator uses information 
provided by quotes 
for
 transactions under the PSPP.
 When implementing PSPP trades in the OTC 
market, firm price
 and volume quotes 
are obtained 
from several counterparties. The 
differences betw
een these quotes contain information on the degree of market 
liquidity. 
For a given bond
, this indicator
 is defined as the spread between the two 
best quotes, divided by the duration of the bond. Only quotes that actually

overeign bond market liquidity since the start of the PSPP
 43 transactions are conside
red. A euro area
-wide indicator is calculated as a volume
-weighted average across all 
traded
 sovereign 
bonds.
 These three indicators suggest that the liquidity situation in euro area 
sovereign bond markets has not deteriorated since the start of the PSPP (
see Chart
 A).
 While all three indicators have displayed some volatility since the start of 
the PSPP, they have not 
recorded
 an upward trend, 
and the Amihud indicator 
has in 
fact
 tende
d to decline. 
This confirms that market liquidity has not deteriorated, 
despite
 the 
build
-up of PSPP
 holdings over time
. 
In the same vein, the
 indicators
 have not 
displayed 
a marked
 reaction to changes in the amount of monthly 
purchases
 under the PSPP
, 
with 
only the execution
-based indicator 
displaying

latest observation is for 20

 events 
associated with an expected deterioration in market liquidity.
 For instance, 
spikes 
were
 observed during the ﬁ
Bund tantrumﬂ period (
commencing on
 29 April
 2015) and 
in a period of
 heightened 
concern
 about a potential significant

were 
also marked
 by 
illiquidity

 (see Chart

Moreover, liquidity usually 
deteriorates during the summer and around the year

 peri

1 November 2017 to 30 January 2018
 Prepared by 
Alao
íshe Luskin
 and Olivier
 Vergote
 This box describes the ECB™s monetary policy operations during the seventh 
and eighth reserve maintenance periods of 2017, which ran from 1
 November 
to 19
 December 2
017 and from 20
 December 2017 to 30
 January 2018 
respectively.
 During this period, the interest rates on the main refinancing 
operations (MROs), the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility remained 
unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and 
-0.40% respective
ly.
 During this review period, the Eurosystem continued to purchase public sector 
securities, covered bonds, asset
-backed securities, and corporate sector securities 
as part of its asset purchase programme (APP), with a target of •60 billion of 
purchases o
n average per month until December 2017. The pace of purchases was 
reduced to •30 billion on average per month from January 2018, and will continue at 
this pace until September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, until the Governing Council 
sees a sustained adj
ustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.
 Liquidity needs
 In the period under review, the average daily liquidity needs of the banking 
system, defined as the sum of net autonomous factors and reserve 
requirements, stood at 
•1,272.7 billion, representing an increase of •60.3 
billion compared with the previous review period (i.e. the fifth and sixth 
maintenance periods of 2017).
 This increase in liquidity needs was attributable to 
an increase in average net autonomous factors,
 which rose by •59.3 billion to 
•1,149.5 billion during the review period, while minimum reserve requirements 
increased by •1 billion to •123.3 billion.
 The growth in net autonomous factors, which implies an absorption of 
liquidity, mainly resulted from a 
decrease in liquidity
-providing factors.
 The 
main contribution came from a decline in net assets denominated in euro, which fell 
by •54.4 billion to •251.8 billion on average in the review period. Average net foreign 
assets also decreased, by •2 billion co
mpared with the previous re
view period, to 
•635.0 billion.
 Liquidity
-absorbing autonomous factors increased slightly over the review 
period, adding to the growth in net autonomous factors.
 The main contribution 
came from banknotes in circulation, which inc
reased by •9.3 billion to •1,151.9 
billion, and other autonomous factors, which increased by •5.3 billion to •695.6 
billion. A decrease in government deposits of •11.8 billion had a counterbalancing 
effect on the level of liquidity
-absorbing autonomous fac
tors.

30 January 2018
 47 The 
day
-to-day 
volatility of autonomous factors remained elevated 
in the 
review period and was 
broadly unchanged from the previous review period.
 The volatility primarily
 reflected fluctuations in government deposits and net assets 
denominated in euro.
 Liquidity provided through monetary policy instruments
 During the review period, the average amount of liquidity provided through 
open market operations 
Œ both tender operat
ions and APP purchases 
Œ increased by •160.9 billion to •3,128.6 billion (see Chart A).
 This increase was 
fully attributable to the APP, while demand in tender operations decreased marginally 
further.

 (EUR billions)

. The average amount of liquidity provided through tender operations declined 
slightly over the review period, by •7.8 billion to •765.2 billion.
 This decrease 
was primarily due to a lower average 
outstanding amount of
 targeted longer
-term 
refinancing operations (
TLTROs
), which decreased by •4.1
 billion, 
largely 
as a 
consequence of voluntary early repayments of funds borrowed via those operations.
 The average liquidity provided through MROs decreased by 
•3.2 billion and
 the 
average amount of liquidity provided through 
three

operations (

 48 Markets Programme and the previous two covered bond purchase programmes 
totalled •
3.3
 billion.
 Excess liquidity
 As a consequence of the developments detailed above, average excess 
liquidity in the period under review rose by •100.6 billion compared with the 
previous period, reaching •1,855.8 billion (see Chart A).
 As mentioned above, 
the increase largely reflects the liquidity provided through the APP, with a monthly 
target of •60 billion until December 2017 and •30 billion as of January 2018. This 
was partially offset by an increase in liquidity needs coming mainl
y from autonomous 
factors. A more detailed analysis of the period under review shows that the 
dampening impact of autonomous factors on the rise in excess liquidity occurred 
mainly in the eighth maintenance period. In particular, the eighth maintenance per
iod 
saw a decrease in excess liquidity of •28.7 billion, as the liquidity injected via the 
APP was offset by lower liquidity
-providing autonomous factors arising from lower 
net assets denominated in euro, coupled with higher aggregate liquidity needs of th
e banking sector, mainly driven by a greater demand for banknotes. By contrast, in the 
seventh maintenance period, excess liquidity grew by •90.2 billion on account of the 
APP purchases and a modest decrease in liquidity
-absorbing autonomous factors, 
mainl
y as a result of lower government deposits.
 The increase in excess liquidity 
over the review period corresponded
 to 
higher 
average current account holdings, which rose by •
45.7 
billion to stand at •
1,293.7
 billion, while the a
verage recourse to the deposit facility increased 
by a further 
•55.8
 billion to stand at •
685.6
 billion.
 Interest rate developments
 Overnight money market rates remained close to the deposit facility rate, even 
falling below it for specific collateral bask
ets in the secured segments.
 In the 
unsecured market, the euro overnight index average
 (EONIA
) averaged 
0.35

 Recent developments in part

 50 4 Recent developments in part
-time employment
 Prepared by Katalin Bodnár
 In the euro area, there has been an increasing reliance on part
-time work.
 The 
share of part
-time workers is now about 22% of total employment, and part
-time 
work has account
ed for about one quarter of net employment growth over the euro 
area labour market recovery (starting in the second quarter of 2013). This box 
examines the latest developments and the characteristics of the two main groups of 
part
-time workers: underemploy
ed and non
-underemployed part
-time workers.
 The number of underemployed 
part
-time 
workers increased during the crisis, 
but has declined recently.
 In the European Union Labour Force Survey, it is 
possible to distinguish between part
-time workers who are 
seeking 
to work more 
hours and those who are not. The first group are called ﬁunderemployedﬂ.
13 Although 
those included in this group are employed, they are usually regarded as partly 
unemployed or underutilised, meaning that the number of hours that they w
ould like 
to work exceeds the number of hours demanded by their employers. 
Underemployment in the euro area increased both in the first phase of the Great 
Recession and in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis. It has been declining 
recently, but still rem
ains above its pre
-crisis levels (Chart
 A). This cyclical pattern is 
similar to that of unemployment.

 Recent developments in part
-time employment
 51 Non
-underemployed part
-time work increased both during the crisis and 
during the recovery.
 The second group, those part
-timers who are not seeking to 
work more hours, typically work in part
-time positions for family, health or other 
reasons (e.g. because they are students). This group makes up the largest share of 
part
-time workers: four in five part
-time workers in the eur
o area are satisfied with the 
hours they work. This category of part
-time employment has displayed no cyclical 
pattern in recent years; instead it has increased steadily over both the crisis and the 
recovery (Chart
 A). This pattern suggests that this categ
ory of part
-time work is 
influenced primarily by structural factors.
 The number of non
-underemployed part
-time workers has been increasing 
mainly in Germany, 
while
 the largest contributions to the changes in 
underemployment in the euro area are accounted f
or by Spain (Chart
 B).
 Among the four largest euro area countries, the share of part
-time work in total 
employment is highest in Germany. This is also the country where the highest share 
of part
-time workers are satisfied with the hours they work and where
 the recent 
increases in part
-time working have not been associated with underemployment. In 
contrast, underemployment increased particularly strongly in Spain and Italy
 during 
the crisis
. In Spain, there has been an inflow into underemployment from 
unempl
oyment, full
-time employment and non
-underemployed part
-time 
employment.
14 The considerable increase in underemployment during the crisis 
probably reflects changes in the regulation of part
-time work as well as the impact of 
the crisis on income and wealth 
during the downturn
, resulting in an increase in 
labour supply in terms of hours. In Italy, underemployment may have been 
influenced by the Government™s measures to support a reduction in hours. Despite 
having declined recently, underemployment remains abo
ve pre
-crisis levels in both 
Italy and Spain, while it is well below pre
-crisis levels in Germany.
                                                                     14  See also the box entitled ﬁAlternative measures of unemployment for the Spanish Economyﬂ,

 Both categories of part
-time work are more 
prevalent 
in the services sectors 
and among women.
 Part
-time workers in the euro area are concentrated in three 
sectors: 1)
 the public services sector
; 2) the trade, transport, accommodation and 
food sector
; and 3)
 the information and communication sector. As a consequence, 
both categories of part
-time work are also concentrated in these sectors (Chart
 C). In 
terms of personal characteristics, prime age and older women make up the vast 
majority of part
-time w
orkers (Chart
 D). The distribution of part
-time work between 
underemployed and non
-underemployed part
-time work is somewhat different across 
sectors and personal characteristics. Underemployed part
-time workers 
account for 
the highest share 
of 
total part
-time employment in other services (including arts, 
entertainment and recreation
, other service activities and activities of household and 
extra
-territorial organi
sations and bodies), followed by 
the 
construction, trade and 
transport and information and comm
unication sectors. 
Underemployed part
-time 
work 
is also high among prime
-age males and the 
young
. Finally, underemployed 
part
-time workers tend to work somewhat fewer hours than non
-underemployed part
-time workers.

-time work may thus be regarded as precarious in some 
cases. However, t
he extent to which underemployed part
-time workers are actually 
available to work more hours and ca
n thus be regarded as underutilised labour is 
also an open question.
17 At the same time, non
-underemployed part
-time work may 
be regarded as an opportunity for many to enter or stay in the labour market, and 
may frequently result in job satisfaction.
18 Part
-time workers in this category seem 
less likely to represent spare capacity or precarious work. All of this suggests that the 
recent declines in underemployed part
-time work and the continuing increase in non

enhancing overall welfare.

 Prepared b

 Timely and reliable statistics are essential for economic analysis.
 This box 
reviews and assesses the reliability of 
Eurostat™s
 preliminary flash estimate
 of 
quarterly GDP growth for the euro area, which
 was introduced at the beginning of 
2016. The 
euro area™s 
single monetary policy 
is dependent on
 timely, reliable and 
comparable indicators that 
accurately 
reflect economic developments. In this 
respect, national accounts provide a comprehensive and consistent picture of the 
economy
, making them
 a cornerstone of monetary policy analysis. The introduction 
of 
a preliminary 
GDP flash estimate
 was therefore a welcome development in 
terms 
of 
the continuous 
efforts
 to improve 
Europe™s
 statistical landscape. Importantly, 
however, increased timeliness should ideally be achieved without any loss of 
reliability
, which is defined here 
as the closeness of th
at initial
 estimate to 
subsequent estimates. Information about reliability can help 
us 
to interpret 
initial
 estimates in terms of uncertainty surrounding data release
s or 
help us to 
guess the 
direction of 
any 
future revisions. If econ
omic indicators provide misleading signals 
regard
ing
 economic developments, which are later 
corrected by
 revisions, this may 
have adverse consequences for economic analysis.
 The introduction of the preliminary flash estimate brought the euro area™s first 
GDP data release 
in respect of each reference period forward 
by some 15 
days, with initial estimates being produced 30
 Œ rather than 45
 Œ days after the 
end of the reference quarter.
 Eurostat, in cooperation with the EU Member States, 
introduced t
he prelimi
nary flash 
estimate
 of euro area and EU GDP on 29
 April
 2016 following a feasibility study
.19 In most countries
, estimates 
at t+30 
are 
largely 
based 
on the same 
methods
 that are
 used 
at t+45
. However,
 owing to limited availability of 
data sources,
 the third month 
of the quarter 
is usually estimate
d or partially
 estimated
 by applying statistical modelling techniques that make use of available 
monthly information (e.g.
 short
-term statistics, business surveys, price statistics and 
preliminary estimate
s of source data).
20 The preliminary flash 
estimate 
for the euro 
area is based on (
i) national estimates
 for six
 countries 
(Belgium, Spain, France, 
Latvia, Lithuania and Austria
 Œ which account for
 some 40
% of euro area GDP)
 which are publicly available at 
t+30
 and (
ii) national estimates 
for other countries 
that 
are provided 
to Eurostat 
on a confidential basis for the calculation of the
se European 
aggregates. 
Four
 euro area countries 
(Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and Slovenia
 Œ which account for almost 4
% of 
euro area GDP)

 (quarterly percentage changes)
  Source: 
Eurostat
. Notes:
 Eurostat™s first preliminary flash 
estimate was published on 29
 April
 2016 and referred to the first quarter of 2016. Preliminary 
flash estimates for earlier periods are taken from the Eurostat publication ﬁ
Euro area and European Union GDP flash estimates at 30 
days
ﬂ. For the purposes of this analysis, estimates to two decimal places are used. ﬁCurrent estimateﬂ denotes 
the most recent 
data
 available in the ECB™s Statistical Data Warehouse
 as at 7
 March
 2018. Flash estimates are based on the composition of the euro area 
at the relevant time, while the current estimate is based on the current composition of the euro area.
 The preliminary flash estimate (at t+30) has performed well in comparison with 
the flash estimate (at t+45).
 Looking at the period from the first quarter of 2012 to 
the fourth quarter of 2017, there is no difference, on average, between the 
preliminary flash estimate and the flash estimate (see Chart
 A). Furthermore, even 
looking at in
dividual quarters, there is no evidence of particularly large differences 
between the two estimates. This suggests that, despite the earlier release date, the 
reliability of the first estimate has been maintained. Ultimately, 
of course
, the 
preliminary fla
sh estimate and the flash estimate both need to be compared with
 the 
latest 
available GDP data, and the two perform equally well in this respect, with both 
estimates averaging 0.1
 percentage point less than the latest available figures. As 
one would expect
, the bulk of this revision stems from the five largest countries, 
given that they account for more than 80% of euro area GDP (see Chart
 B). 
However, smaller countries also have a role to play in this regard, either (i)
 as a 
result of revisions to their ow
n flash estimates, or (ii)
 because countries that do not 
produce any data until 60 days or more after the end of the reference quarter are 
included in the euro area aggregate. Indeed, the four smaller countries that do not 
produce estimates at t+30 or t+45
 made relatively large contributions to the revisions

 Note: The five largest countries in terms of GDP are Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands
. Euro area statistics have improved over 
the years, but a number of challenges 
still remain.
 The introduction of the preliminary GDP flash estimate at t+30 is one of 
the most significant improvements in the national accounts in recent years, bringing 
the first estimate forward without any losses 
in terms of reliability. The ECB regularly 
uses such estimates in its analysis and 
macroeconomic projections
, benefiting from 
the improved timeliness of data. Other euro area countries are expected to start 
publishing preliminary flash estimates of GDP
 in 
the coming years,
22 but the number 
of countries publishing national estimates or detailed expenditure breakdowns at 
t+30 may not, in the short term, be sufficient to support a more thorough analysis of 
macroeconomic developments at euro area level so soon a
fter the end of the 
reference quarter. In addition, 
the economic statistics 
that are used in conjunction 
with preliminary flash estimates are
 still less complete and 
less 
timely 
at euro area 
level 
than 
they are 
in a number of individual euro area countries
 and major trading 
partners outside the euro area 
(such as the United States
). It is therefore important 
that the development of 
relevant 
euro area
 and country
-level 
statistics
 continues and 
is prioritised accordingly.
 It is also important to enhance the q
uality of the source 
data that are
 used as inputs for preliminary flash estimates (e.g.
 short
-term statistics 
                                                                    21  The revisions for those quarters were largely caused by the incorporation of Irish data in the euro area 
aggregate. The very significant role that is played by multinational companies i
n Ireland and the way 
that their holdings in terms of intellectual property products (intangible assets) are recorded have led to 
increased volatility in GDP growth rates in recent years.

Istat™s release calendar

 Prepared by Eliza Lis and Mario Porqueddu
 Measures of underlying inflation 
provide a means of looking
 beyond short
-term volatility i
n price developments
. An example of this is the exclusion of the 
highly volatile food and energy components from the HICP. However, HICP inflation 
excluding food and energy can still be subject to short
-term volatility. This box 
reviews two possible source
s Œ changes in seasonality and idiosyncratic price 
changes (henceforth ﬁoutliersﬂ)
 Œ and assesses to what extent they can explain 
recent short
-term volatility in the profile of euro area HICP inflation excluding food 
and energy.
 Seasonal fluctuations in 
the 
euro area HICP 
excluding food and energy
 have 
become more pronounced over time.
 Seasonal fluctuations per se have no impact 
on annual inflation rates, but changes in the seasonal factor do. A considerable part 
of the increased seasonality is due to met
hodological changes, although some of it 
also appears to reflect a more general development.
24 The increased seasonality is 
visible in both the HICP for non
-energy industrial goods and the HICP for services 
(see Chart
 A).

)  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 Notes: The seasonal factor is calculated as the ratio between the non

A number above (below) 100 means a positive (negative) impact of seasonality on 
the 
euro area HICP for non
-energy industrial goods 
and services.
 The impact of seasonality on the HICP for non
-energy industrial goods and 
on the HICP 
for services is related mainly to prices for clothing and travel
-related 
services respectively.
 Seasonal sales of clothing usually take place in the winter 
months of January and February and in the summer months of July and August (see 
                                                                    24  For a definition of

25 An earlie
r (later) start to the sales period can then imply a stronger 
(weaker) month
-on-month price change than in the previous year and hence a 
strong, temporary decrease (increase) in the annual inflation rate. The seasonality 
impact on clothing prices 
has becom
e substantially larger since 2001, not least due 
to enhanced price collection, improvements in methods for compiling price changes 
in winter and summer clothing and, since 2010, the introduction of the regulation on 
the treatment of seasonal products.
26 Sea
sonality in the prices of travel
-related 
services (e.g.
 package holidays, accommodation and air transport) implies strong 
price changes mainly in the summer and winter months (see Chart
 C).
27 Given the 
relative high weight of clothing and travel
-related ser
vices in the HICP excluding food 
and energy (about 12%), deviations from the usual seasonal pattern can have a 
strong impact on annual inflation.

 France in the summer months and

 The impact of outliers on annual inflation rates is usually short
-lived.
 The 
impact of an unusual price change compared with the previous 
month will affect 
inflation rates for a period of one year, unless the impact is relatively quickly 
reabsorbed in the subsequent month(s), possibly then implying outliers in the other 
direction. One example is a very mild winter with 
no snow in the ski res
ort regions
, implying less demand for accommodation services and lower price increases 
compared 
with
 the usual profile. However, the frequency of price
-setting for most of 
the items considered 
in Chart
 D is usually low, especially for administered prices, 
making the outlier price change mostly a true level shift with an impact on inflation 
that disappears only after one year.
 Increasing seasonality and outliers raise the potential for inflation surprises.
 The detection and assessment of unusual changes in s
easonal patterns and outliers 
is important for short
-term forecasting in order to disentangle short
-lived shocks from 
cyclical fluctuations and medium to long
-term trends. In practice, owing to their 
unexpected and one
-off nature, outliers are often mechan
ically incorporated when 
updating the short
-term inflation forecast path
 Œ keeping the month
-on-month profile 
for subsequent months unchanged compared with the previous forecast. This bears 
the risk of overlooking that the outlier might be a first step in 
a change in trend, or 
that it might unwind very quickly via a countermovement.

 Fiscal policy stance during past periods of expansion
 63 7 Fiscal policy stance during past periods of expansion
 Prepared by Maria Grazia Attinasi, Alessandra Anna Palazzo and 
Beatrice Pierluigi
 Economic activity in the euro area and 
in most of its member countries has 
recovered to pre
-crisis levels and is currently expanding.
 Over the past four 
years the gradual move towards a broad
-based and self
-sustained expansion has 
been accompanied by a broadly neutral fiscal stance for the euro
 area aggregate. In 
other words, discretionary policies neither provided a significant impulse to the 
economy, nor did they act as a drag on growth for the euro area as a whole. As the 
expansion is becoming more solid and mature, a more countercyclical sta
nce 
may
 become appropriate for the euro area. Arguments in favour of a countercyclical fiscal 
policy put forward in the literature
30 essentially hinge on the need to improve fiscal 
positions during good economic times and to use the resulting fiscal space to 
support the economy during recessions, without hampering debt sustainability. In the 
euro area, the important role that automatic
 stabilisers play in ensuring 
counter
-cyclicality requires countries 
to 
conduct their policies in line with their 
commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). This will allow countries to 
rebuild fiscal buffers, reduce debt ratios and keep fiscal
 policies on a sustainable 
path.
 Against this background, this box looks at the fiscal policy
 stance
 during past 
expansionary periods and the extent to which good economic times have been 
used to build fiscal buffers.
 For the purposes of this box, an expan
sion is the 
period of time after the level of GDP 
has returned 
to its pre
-contraction peak and 
until it reaches the next peak
.31 This part of the cycle is often called an expansion, as 
opposed to the recovery phase, i.e., the period of GDP returning from a 
cyclical 
trough to the previous peak (see Chart
 A). An alternative metric used to characterise 
expansions consists of identifying periods where the output gap is positive and the 
pace of actual GDP growth is higher than the growth of 
potential GDP.
                                                                     30  See, among others, Taylor, John B., ﬁReassessing Discretionary Fiscal Policyﬂ,

European Commission

. Note
s: Expansionary periods denote 
the quarters after the level of GDP has returned to its pre
-contraction peak and until it reaches 
the next peak
. The annual average fiscal stance is calculated as the average annual change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance
 (CAPB)
. Since data for the CAPB are available as of 1995, and thus data on the fiscal stance as of 1996,
 the start of the fir
st 
expansionary 
phase is set to
 the first quarter of 
1996. However, real GDP for the euro area reached the pre
-crisis peak in the second 
quarter of 1994. The indicators refer to end
-of-year data, when the end of the expansion is dated from the third quarter onwards. 
For 
Germany
 and the euro area
, the 
CAPB
 in 1995 is corrected for the large one
-off impact of the inclusion, in the 
German 
Federal 
Budget
, of 
the
 Treuhandanstalt
 (i.e.
 a trust agency established to privati
se companies
 in the former German Democratic Republic
). In the period preceding the financial crisis
, the fiscal stance 
in the 
euro area 
was 
on average
 neutral.
32  Across countries, the fiscal stance
, defined as the 
change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance (CAPB),
 was broadly neutral in 
Spain, Italy and
 France, mildly contractionary in the Netherlands and more 
countercyclical in Germany
33 (see Table
 A). 
Given that GDP growth was also strong
, 
the debt ratio declined significantly in Spain and the Netherlands. By contrast, it 
increased in France not least o
n the back of a persistently negative 
CAPB
 over the 
entire expansionary period. It should be noted that Italy ran somewhat sizeable 
                                                                    32  The fiscal stance measures the effect of government policy on the budget bala
nce. The cyclically 
adjusted primary balance (i.e. the headline balance net of interest payments and the cyclical 
component) is the main metric used to measure this effect. It could nonetheless be an imperfect 
measure of government effort, given the uncert
ainty surrounding the measurement of the output gap 
and the fact that the metric itself could be influenced by factors outside the government™s control
. Such 
factors include 
government revenues and social contributions 
that 
depend on bases which often evol
ve 
somewhat differently from GDP
, such
 that standard tax elasticities do not hold. Recently, the 
assessment of fiscal effort has come to be supplemented by a ﬁbottom
-upﬂ analysis, which provides a 
more detailed quantification of government effort in terms 
of revenues and expenditure measures. For 
more details
, see 
the article entitled 
ﬁThe assessment of fiscal effortﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin
, ECB, 
October
 2014.
 33  A fiscal stance 
of 
between 
-0.2% and 0.2% of GDP is generally regarded as broadly neutral. The 
analy
sis carried out in this box uses ex post data. It should be noted that, compared with the real
-time 
data, ex post data show a deterioration in the 
CAPB
 in the euro area countries as a result of ex post 
downward revisions of potential output during the 1996
-2007 expansionary period. This means that 
real
-time data would have shown a more countercyclical stance than its ex post realisation.

 Fiscal policy stance during past periods of exp

 66 primary surpluses during the 
1996-2000 period of expansion, resulting in a 
substantial reduction in 
its
 debt ratio. However,
 this performance was not repeated in 
the subsequent expansionary period of 
2003-07, when average real GDP growth 
was slightly weaker and the size of the primary surplus was significantly lower. 
Germany stands out as the country with the consistently highe
st degree of counter
-cyclicality during expansionary phases.
 A simple ﬁfiscal reaction functionﬂ approach makes it possible to identify 
the
 major factors driving discretionary policies.
 According to the relevant literature
,34 when choosing which fiscal stan
ce to take, policymakers may be influenced by (i)
 the 
level of debt, as high debt ratios may call for consolidations to ensure sustainability; 
(ii)
 the starting level of the primary balance, as the higher the starting level of the 
primary surplus, the less
er is the need to build fiscal buffers; (iii)
 electoral 
considerations, as fiscal policies may be used to gain electoral support during 
elections; and (iv)
 the business cycle, as governments may build fiscal buffers during 
economic good times 
to counter th
e effects of a subsequent
 recession.
 The estimated fiscal reaction function appears consistent with the descriptive 
evidence presented in Table
 A. Chart
 B shows
 the relative impact on the predicted 
fiscal stance of the statistically significant explanatory
 variables, as obtained on the 
basis of the fiscal reaction function estimates
.35 They confirm the findings of the 
literature, namely that the overall fiscal stance has been influenced positively (i.e.
 in 
the sense of a tighter fiscal stance) by the level o
f debt
, and negatively (i.e.
 in the 
sense of a looser fiscal stance) by the starting level of the primary balance. 
Furthermore, 
Chart
 B shows that during periods of economic expansion, as defined 
in this box, the fiscal stance also tends to be relatively t
ighter.

 The mildly countercyclical or broadly neutral stance that prevailed during the 
expansionary phase before the financial crisis was not sufficient to build 
adequate buffers for the 
following
 recession.
 Within the EU fiscal governance 
frame
work, all EU countries need to achieve sustainable debt levels while ensuring 
that their budgets have enough room to manoeuvre and a safety margin against 
breaching the EU™s fiscal rules in the event of negative shocks
.36 During the very 
long expansionary p
eriod before the 
2008-09 financial and economic crises, the euro 
area 
failed to 
build sufficient fiscal buffers. This was because it recorded a 
persistently negative cyclically adjusted 
budget 
balance (i.e. the headline budget 
balance net of the cyclical c
omponent
 Œ see
 Chart
 C). The euro area entered the 
crisis with a cyclically adjusted 
budget 
balance of 
-2.8%
. In the subsequent 
2008-10 period the cyclically adjusted budget balance deteriorated further by almost 
3 percentage points of GDP (reaching 
-5.8% 
in 2010), and the debt
-to
-GDP ratio 
increased by almost 20
 percentage points of GDP, according to data from the 
European Commission. Based on this experience and in view of the legacy debt 
accumulated during the double
-dip recession, there seems to be good
 reason for the 
euro area countries to take advantage of the current favourable economic conditions 
to rebuild sufficient fiscal buffers, in line with the SGP. In this context, it is worthwhile 
recalling the Eurogroup™s observation in November
 2017 that th
e limited structural 
fiscal adjustment expected in 2018 in some Member States was 
a matter 
of concern, 
                                                                    36  Since 2005 this requirement has been operationalised by requiring that countries converge towards 
their medium
-term objective, that is, 
the
 budget 
needs 
to be in,
 or close to
, balance i
n structural terms. 
As this analysis starts before the introduction of the structural balance, the level of the cyclically 
adjusted budget balance at the end of each expansion is used as a proxy of the degree to which 
countries have built fiscal buffers.

 The European Commission™s 2018 assessment of macroeconomic imbalances and progress 
on reforms
 69 8 The European Commission™s 2018 assessment of 
macroeconomic imbalances and progress on reforms
 Prepared by Nico Zorell
 The European Commission™s 2018 assessment of macroeconomic imbalances 
and progress on reforms provides confirmation that greater efforts are needed 
in many EU Member States in order t
o advance economic growth and 
resilience on a more sustainable basis.
 The Commission™s assessment, published on 7
 March
 2018, is an integral part 
of the European Semester and its macroeconomic imbalance procedure (MIP).
 The European Semester provides a fra
mework for the coordination of economic and 
fiscal policies across the EU. Within this framework, the MIP aims to prevent the 
emergence of harmful macroeconomic imbalances in EU Member States and to 
correct them where they are assessed as excessive. Follow
ing a screening exercise 
in autumn each year on the basis of a standardised scoreboard, the European 
Commission conducts in
-depth reviews (IDRs) of the selected countries. If 
imbalances are found to exist, the Member State concerned receives policy 
recomme
ndations under the preventive arm of the MIP. For imbalances that are 
found to be excessive, the Commission may step up the procedure by initiating the 
excessive imbalance procedure (EIP) with a recommendation to the Council of the 
European Union. Under th
is corrective arm of the procedure, a corrective action plan 
must be provided by the Member State concerned and financial sanctions can be 
imposed.
 The Commission™s 2018 assessment points to a gradual unwinding of 
macroeconomic imbalances across EU Member 
States.
 The number of countries 
identified by the Commission as experiencing excessive imbalances has declined for 
the first time since the introduction of the MIP in 2011. Only three Member States 
(Croatia, Italy and Cyprus) now remain in this group (see 
Chart
 A). For the past three 
years Bulgaria, France and Portugal were also included; however, following 
improvements, they are now assessed by the Commission as experiencing 
imbalances (rather than excessive imbalances) (see Table
 A). The same 
classificati
on remains in place in respect of Germany, Ireland, Spain, the 
Netherlands and Sweden, despite recent progress in reducing some of the 
imbalances in these countries. In the case of Slovenia, the Commission has 
concluded that the imbalances identified last 
year no longer exist. Overall, the 
Commission has found no evidence of macroeconomic imbalances in 16 Member 
States, namely Slovenia and those that were not selected for an IDR in the first 
stage of the MIP.

 Notes
: The four countries highlighted are those in respect of
 which the European Commission improved the MIP classification in 2018 
(either from ﬁexcessive imbalancesﬂ to ﬁimbalancesﬂ or from ﬁimbalancesﬂ to ﬁno imbalancesﬂ). Greece is currently not subject
 to the 
MIP, as it is under an economic adjustment programme
. The recent improvement in macroeconomic imbalances has been partly 
cyclical, driven by the continued economic expansion in the EU.
 The stronger 
growth momentum has provided direct and indirect support to the correction of 
imbalances. Directly, it has fac
ilitated deleveraging by firms and households, as well 
as a decline in unemployment. Indirectly, it has helped to reduce stock imbalances, 
which are usually expressed in relation to national output. As a result, public, private 
and external indebtedness ha
ve continued to decline in the majority of EU Member 
States. Moreover, total (and in particular, youth) unemployment have continued to 
fall, facilitated in some countries by labour market reforms undertaken in previous 
years.
 Despite these improvements, 
the Commission has explicitly cautioned against 
the risks stemming from the prevailing high stock imbalances.

mmission™s 2018 assessment of macroeconomic imbalances and progress

 71 public, private and external indebtedness remain well above pre
-crisis levels in many 
Member States and are a source of vulnerabili
ty to adverse shocks going forward. 
This calls for continued close monitoring of such countries under the MIP, even 
where they are no longer assessed as experiencing excessive imbalances.
 Structural reforms are essential to enhance growth and resilience on
 a sustainable basis, yet over the past year the pace of reform implementation 
has remained rather limited in many EU Member States.
 This follows from the 
Commission™s annual review of the implementation of the country
-specific 
recommendations (CSRs). 
A CSR provide
s policy guidance tailored to 
an individual 
EU Member State
, and covering
 a period of around 12
 to 
18 months
, on how to 
enhance economic growth and resilience while maintaining sound public finances. 
The current set of CSRs was adopted by the Coun
cil of the European Union in 
July
 2017. Similarly to last year, the Commission has concluded that the 
overwhelming majority
 Œ more than 90%
 Œ of reform recommendations have been 
followed by only ﬁsomeﬂ or ﬁlimitedﬂ progress in implementation, while just on
e (of 
almost 80) of the CSRs has been substantially implemented, and none has been 
fully implemented (see Table
 B). Despite their greater vulnerability, the six countries 
identified last year as having excessive imbalances did not, on average, achieve 
sign
ificantly higher implementation rates than the average EU Member State. Th
is is 
also the case

 72 While
 the piecemeal implementation of the CSRs illustrates the difficulties of 
improving the implementation of reform using the preventive arm of the MIP
, the corrective arm of the procedure offers a well
-defined pr
ocess ensuring greater 
traction for implementation of the most needed macro
-critical reforms. This is 
particularly relevant for the most vulnerable Member States, in order to enhance their 
resilience and the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union. 
Overall, the MIP 
has so far been more successful in identifying macroeconomic imbalances than in 
correcting them. Applying all available tools
 Œ including the activation of the 
corrective arm of the procedure for countries with excessive imbalances
 Œ could
 increase the 
procedure™s 
effectiveness. 
(Such application has also been explicitly 
called for by the five Presidents in their 2015 report

 1 The real effects of credit constraints
 Prepared by Miguel García
-Posada
 This article reviews the existing literature on financial constraints and their effect on 
investment. It also provides 
new evidence on this issue using a large sample of firms 
from 12
 European countries for the period 2014
-17. 
The data come from the 
ECB 
and European Commission s
urvey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), 
which
 focuses specifically on
 small and medium
-sized enterprises (SMEs).
 The 
available evidence suggests that credit constraints play a crucial role in the 
investment decisions of
 non-financial corporations.
 1 Introduction
 Under certain assumptions, a firm™s financing structure does not influence 
its
 investment.
 The Modigliani
-Miller theorem
40, which is the cornerstone of the 
corporate finance literature, states that, under certain 
conditions, a firm™s capital 
structure is irrelevant to its value. This implies that, in perfect capital markets, a firm™s 
financing decisions are independent from its investment decisions. In th
at case, 
internal and external funds are perfect substitutes,
 and firms™ investment decisions 
are 
not affected by
 financial factors such as internal liquidity, debt leverage or 
dividend payments.
 In practice, however, several factors 
mean
 that external funds are generally 
more costly than internally generated cash f
lows.
 Factors such as transaction 
costs, tax advantages, costs of financial distress, agency costs and asymmetric 
information 
cause
 the Modigliani
-Miller theorem
 to break down
.41 In this context, 
internal and external funds are imperfect substitutes, which 
leads to the emergence 
of an external finance premium. Financial constraints may thus have important 
(negative) effects on real variables and, as a consequence, the availability of 
external finance may affect investment decisions.
 This article review

existing literature and provide

issue.

 2 Literature review
 This section summarises micro
-econometric evidence on the effects of credit 
constraints
 on the real economy
. It highlights the most noteworthy studies in the 
literature that follow a micro
-econometric approach
44 to provide a context for the new 
evidence presented in 
Section
 3. 2.1
 Early research: investment
-cash flow sensitivities and financial 
statement data
 Ear
ly research on financial constraints was based on firms™ financial statement 
data and indirect measures of financial constraints.
 In this literature, the 
standard approach was to use indirect measures of financial constraints such as 
dividend payout behavi
our, association with business groups, size, age, ownership 
form and credit ratings to test whether the sensitivity of investment to cash flows was 
greater in types of firm that were more likely to be financially constrained.
45 The seminal work of Fazzari e
t al.
46 found that investment was more sensitive 
to cash flows in financially constrained firms.
 According to the authors, low
-dividend firms were more likely to be financially constrained because firms might pay 
low dividends, when they require investment 
finance that exceeds their internal cash 
flows, in order to retain all of the low
-cost internal funds they can generate. 
The presence of financial constraints could be tested by analysing the sensitivity of 
investment to cash flows. The intuition is that, 
if the cost disadvantage of external 
finance is small (i.e.
 no financial constraints), firms can use external funds to smooth 
investment when internal finance fluctuates. By contrast, if the cost disadvantage is 
significant (i.e.
 financial constraints are 
relevant), firms may have no alternative low
-cost source of finance, and their investment 
is likely to
 be driven by fluctuations in 
cash flows. 
In line
 with this hypothesis, the authors found that investment 
by low
-dividend firms was more sensitive to fluc
tuations in cash flows than 
investment by
 high
-dividend firms.
                                                                     42  The regular reports on the 
SAFE
 survey can be found on the ECB™s website.

ies
 the effects of financial friction on long

composition of investment, credit constraints can lead to both higher output volatility and lower mean 
growth

 The real effects of credit constraints
 75 A standard criticism of
 this approach
 is that 
cash flows 
may proxy for other
, unobservable determinants of investment, such as
 investment opportunities
. Cash flows may capture the current and e
xpected profitability of investment: high 
cash flows signal that the firm has done well and is likely to continue doing well.
47 Thus, more liquid firms have better investment opportunities, and accordingly they 
tend to invest more. One way around this probl
em is to control for the expected 
profitability of investment when estimating investment
-cash flow sensitivities. This 
can be done by using Tobin™s average q
48 (the 
ratio of 
the 
market value of the firm to 
the replacement cost of its assets), as it contains
 forward
-looking information on 
profitability. Theory predicts that, if financial constraints are unimportant, Tobin™s q 
should be the only determinant of investment. However, Tobin™s q is difficult to 
measure in practice and may well differ from the margi
nal q
49, which is the relevant 
measure for firms™ investment decisions, unless very stringent conditions are 
satisfied. Hence, when Tobin™s q is not a good measure of investment opportunities, 
the significance of cash flow
s may simply reflect
 the fact
 that 
they
 contain 
information about future profitability.
 In addition, this strand of the literature has been challenged by Kaplan and 
Zingales
,50 who provide empirical evidence that a greater sensitivity of 
investment to cash flow
s is not a reliable measure of 
financing constraints.
 The authors undertake an in
-depth analysis of the low
-dividend firms that Fazzari et 
al. identify as financially constrained according to the investment
-cash flow criterion. 
In particular, they examine managers™ views on their firms™
 access to credit gleaned 
from comments
 on the firms™ annual reports or 
ﬁ10-Kﬂ reports
51, complemented 
by additional quantitative information. On this basis, they rank the extent to which the 
firms are likely to be financially constrained. Strikingly, firms
 classified as less 
financially constrained exhibit significantly greater investment
-cash flow sensitivity 
than those classified as more financially constrained, which implies that investment
-cash flow sensitivities do not
 always
 increas
e with the degree o
f financing 
constraints.
 Another study that highlights the limitations of these methodologies is 
by 
Farre
-Mensa and Ljungqvist.
52 The authors, using a large sample of US publicly
-listed firms 
for the period 
between 1989 and 2011, find that firms typically c
lassified 
                                                                    47  For instance, in Fazzari
 et al., op. cit., cash flows equal income after interest and taxes plus 
depreciation and amortisation, and it is divided by the capital stock. This variable is likely to be highly 
correlated with a return on assets ratio (net income over total assets).

 The real effects of credit constraints
 76 as constrained
53 do not actually behave as such. In particular, th
ese firms have no 
difficulty raising debt when tax rates increase (as an increase in tax rates raises the 
value of tax shields) and they use the proceeds from equity issues to incre
ase 
payouts to shareholders, which indicates that they do not face an inelastic supply of 
equity curve. According to the authors, traditional measures of credit constraints 
identify young and fast
-growing firms that obtain financing primarily from the equi
ty 
and loan markets, rather than capturing actual financial constraints.
 2.2
 Survey
-based indicators of financial constraints and firm 
performance
 Given the limitations of previous studies based on investment
-cash flow 
sensitivities and financial statement
 data, a new strand of the literature 
attempts to assess the impact of financial constraints on real variables using 
survey data.
 The key idea is to obtain direct measures of financial constraints by 
asking firms about problems in their access to credit ma
rkets.
 Campello et al.
54 use a worldwide survey to assess the impact of the 2008 
financial crisis on spending plans.
 They do so with a sample of very large 
corporations from the U
nited 
States
, Europe and Asia surveyed in 2008. They find 
that constrained firms planned, on average, deeper cuts in technology expenditure, 
capital expenditure, marketing expenditure and employment. The inability to obtain 
external funds also caused many constrained 
firms to 
forgo
 attractive investment 
opportunities.
 Ferrando and Mulier
55 analyse the effect of being a discouraged borrower 
(i.e.
 a firm that need
s external finance but do
es not apply for a bank loan 
because 
it
 fear
s that 
its
 application will be rejected) 
on firm investment and 
growth.
 They do so by combining the answers to the 
SAFE
 survey
 with financial 
statement data for nine euro area countries for 2010
-14. 
The d
iscouraged borrowers
 in the survey
 tend to be 
riskier and lower quality firms than non
-discou
raged 
borrowers, as suggested by
, among other things,

 The real effects of credit constraints
 77 the endogeneity between discouragement and investment (as discouraged 
borrowers ar
e likely to have worse investment opportunities) the authors show that 
discouragement has large negative effects on investment, employment and asset 
growth. The
y argue that this negative impact is due to the lack of access to bank 
finance implied by discou
ragement.
 A different approach is taken by Buca and Vermeulen,
58 who examine the 
negative impact of bank credit tightening on aggregate investment.
 They use 
information on banks™ credit standards (i.e.
 loan approval criteria) from the 
euro area 
bank lending
 survey
 to construct tightening 
indices
 for six European countries
59 for 
the period 2004
-09. Tighter credit standards are likely to lead to a higher proportion 
of credit
-constrained firms, and may thus have effects
 on the real economy
. In 
particular, the 
authors find that, following a tightening of bank credit, bank
-dependent 
borrowers (i.e.
 firms with a high percentage of bank debt over total assets) reduced 
investment 
to a 
much 
larger extent
 than non
-bank dependent borrowers. As 
tightening of bank credit
 standards was substantial in the last financial crisis, they 
argue that this phenomenon may explain a significant proportion of the drop in 
aggregate investment by non
-financial corporations during that period.
 Nevertheless, a caveat of all these studies 
is the potential endogeneity of 
financial constraints.
 The
 fact that the unobserved component of investment 
opportunities may be correlated with the indicator of credit constraints, and one can 
only control imperfectly for investment opportunities and inve
stment demand, 
undermines a causal interpretation of the estimates. 
For instance, firms with weak 
balance sheets may have both low investment opportunities and a high probability of 
being financially constrained, so the relationship between these two varia
bles may 
be endogenous.
 2.3
 The real effects of the sovereign debt crisis
 Finally, another strand of the literature studies the real effects of the sovereign 
debt crisis.
 In particular, the euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2010
-12 may have 
caused a credi
t crunch and have negatively affected firms™ investment and job 
creation through credit rationing by banks in difficulties because of the sovereign
-debt crisis, the so
-called sovereign
-bank nexus.
 Ferrando et al.
60 find that the euro area sovereign debt crisis caused a 
large
 reduction in credit access.
 The authors, who use data from the SAFE survey on 11 
countries for the period 2009
-12, find that the euro area sovereign debt crisis caused 
a large supply
-driven redu
ction in credit access because of the sovereign
-bank 
nexus. In particular, after the sovereign debt crisis started, and controlling for 
                                                                    58  Buca, A. and Vermeulen, P.,

 The real effects of credit constraints
 78 borrower quality, firms in stressed countries
61 became more likely t
o be denied 
credit
, to be credit
-rationed and to face
 higher loan rates.
 In addition, 
Acharya et al.
62 find that the European debt crisis had strong 
negative effects 
on the real economy 
through the bank lending channel.
 According to 
this
 study of the European syndicated loan market for the period 2006
--12, th
e credit crunch that followed the European debt crisis had strong negative 
effects
 on the real economy
, as the contraction 
in lending by
 banks affected by the 
crisis depressed the investment, job creation and sales growth of firms 
associated 
with these ban
ks. The
 authors™
 estimates suggest that the credit crunch explained 
between one
-fifth and half of the overall negative real effects suffered by European 
borrowing firms during the crisis. 
This was
 primarily associated with banks from 
distressed countries f
acing losses 
on their domestic sovereign debt holdings and
 the 
resulting incentives 
for
 weakly
-capitalised banks from those countries to engage in 
risk
-shifting behaviour by buying even more domestic sovereign bonds, 
which
 crowd
ed out corporate lending.
 3 The impact of financial constraints on investmen
t: new 
survey

 This section provides new evidence on the relationship between 
a firm
™s
 financial constraints and investment.
63 The findings suggest that financial 
constraints have a strong negati
ve impact on corporate investment.
 3.1
 Sample and descriptive statistics
 The analysis is based on data from the SAFE 
survey covering
 12 European 
countries for 2014
-17. The sample contains only non
-financial firms and excludes 
firms in agriculture
 and publi
c administration
. 
Most of the firms are interviewed only 
once
, but there is a small rotating panel of enterprises that are surveyed in 
successive
 rounds.
64 The sample is limited to rounds 11 to 16 of 
the survey
 (from 
April
-September
 2014 to October
 2016-Mar
ch 2017) because of the availability of 
some key variables. The sample has 7,506 observations corresponding to 4,863 
firms from 12 European countries.
65 The key variable is a measure of overall credit constraints.
 Credit constraints are 
assessed in bank fin
ancing (bank loans and credit lines), trade credit and other 
                                                                    61  Ireland, Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal.

 The real effects of credit constraints
 79 financing (equity and debt securities, leasing, factoring, intercompany loans, etc
.) A firm is considered to be financially constrained if it is constrained in any financing 
source. In particular
, the credit constraint variable equals 
1 if, for some type of 
financing, any of the following circumstances 
applies
: a)
 a firm™s application 
for
 external financing 
was
 rejected; b)
 a firm received 
only 
a limited part (i.e.
 less than 
75%) of 
the financing
 it applied for (i.e.
 quantity rationing); c)
 a firm refused the 
lender™s 
offer of
 external financing because the borrowing costs were too high (i.e. 
price rationing); d)
 a firm did not apply for external financing because it feared its 
application would b
e rejected (i.e.
 discouraged borrower).
66 The variable equals 
0 (i.e.
 unconstrained) if the firm successfully applied for external financing. 
Firms that 
did not apply for external financing are excluded from the sample. According to this 
indicator, 24
% of t
he sample firms are constrained in some source of financing.
67 The distribution of constrained firms differs across firm categories, 
highlighting the role of information asymmetries and credit risk.
 Charts
 1-3 show
 the percentage of constrained firms across
 several categories. 
In line
 with 
previous literature, there is a negative relationship between the probability of 
experiencing financial constraints and size (Chart
 1a).
68 Also in line with previous 
studies,
69 the proportion of mature firms (ten or more yea
rs) that are constrained is 
much lower than that of relatively young firms (less than five years), 
although the 
proportion of very young firms that are constrained is also slightly lower
 (Chart
 1b). 
Consistent
ly with the literature that suggests that belon
ging to a business group 
relaxes financial constraints
,70 the proportion of constrained f
irms among 
subsidiaries
 or branches is significantly lower than that 
among
 autonomous 
enterprises
 (Chart
 2a). Ownership structure also matters, as sole traders and fami
ly 
businesses are more likely 
to be
 constrained than publicly
 listed firms
 (Chart
 2b). 
There is also a significant proportion of constrained firms among those owned by 
venture capital enterprises, as venture capital tends to fund new and risky projects 
for
 which conventional finance is often not available. Exporting firms are less likely to 
be financially constrained than non
-exporting 
firms, 
because the former tend to be 
more competitive and productive
 (Chart
 3a).
71 Finally, the proportion of credit
-                                                                    66  Similar indicators have been construct
ed in previous literature but focused on bank credit only.

two reasons for the discrepancy. First, the indicator in the reports focuses on bank loans only. Second, 
it uses as a denominator all SMEs for which bank loans are relevant, while the indicator in this article 
uses as a deno
minator only the firms that applied for external financing.

 The real effects of credit constraints
 82 3.2
 Econometric analysis
 A more formal test of the effects of credit constraints
 on investment
 can be 
carried out
 through regression analysis.
 The analy
sis uses
 linear probability 
models.
 The dependent variable is 
investment
, a dummy variable that equals
 1 if 
investment has increased and 0 if it has decreased or remained unchanged.
 This 
variable is regressed on the credit constraint indicator, a large set
 of firm
-level and 
country
-level controls and country and time
-fixed effects.
 The key identification challenge is omitted variable bias.
 Firms with poor 
investment opportunities tend to invest less and are likely to have a higher probability 
of being credi
t-constrained. Hence, the coefficient on the credit constraint indicator 
may be 
affected by
 endogeneity.
 To tackle this problem, the analysis follows two approaches, one that uses 
proxies for investment opportunities and another that uses instrumental vari
able 
methods.
 The first approach relies on the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) and a 
large set of covariates to control for firms™ investment opportunities. 
The main measure 
of investment opportunities is an indicator for changes in the enterprise
-specific 
outlook, as in Ferrando and Mulier.
74 In particular, the firm is asked to assess the 
evolution of its own outlook, with respect to sales and profitability or
 business plan, 
over the past six months. The analysis also includes an indicator for changes in a 
firm™s turnover as a proxy for growth opportunities, as in Gomes.
 75 Regarding the 
remaining firm
-level controls, size and age, together with the firm™s secto
r of activity, 
are traditional determinants of investment opportunities (see Petersen and Rajan
76).
77 Nevertheless, as one cannot perfectly control for firms™ investment 
opportunities, instrumental variables are also used.
 The instrumental variables 
approach
 is aimed at removing any remaining correlation of the error term in the 
regression with the credit constraint indicator. The proposed instruments, 
adjusted 
credit standards
, are two variables that measure the level of (adjusted) credit 
standards in each c
ountry, as applied to large firms and SMEs respectively. The 
variables, which come from the euro area bank lending survey, measure the supply
-only component of banks™ credit standards (i.e.
 banks™ loan approval criteria), as 
influenced by factors such as t
heir cost of funds, competitive pressures and risk 
tolerance.
78 Adjusted credit standards should be uncorrelated with demand factors 
such as the macroeconomic and industry
-specific outlook, borrowers™ creditworthiness 
and risks related to the collateral dem
anded. 
However, to rule out the possibility that 
                                                                    74  Ferrando, A. and Mulier

 The real effects of credit constraints
 83 the instrument is just capturing the economic cycle and in turn the 
economy
-wide 
investment opportunities, macroeconomic controls have been included: real GDP, 
the 
consumer confidence indicator and the ten
-year government bond yield.
 The results suggest that financial constraints have a large effect on investment.
 Table
 1 presents the results of linear probability models estimated by OLS and two
-stage least squares (2SLS), in which the dependent variable is 
investment
.79 Column
 1, estimated by OLS, shows a negative and strong correlation between the 
endogenous regressor, 
constrained
, and the dependent variable 
investment
. However, 
to establish a causal relationship one needs to make use of the instrumental vari
ables. 
First, a single instrumental variable, the adjusted credit standards in loans to SMEs, is 
used (column
 2). According to these estimates, the presence of credit constraints 
reduces the probability of increasing investment by 67
 percentage points, but
 the effect 
is estimated imprecisely and is only statistically significant at 10%. 
To increase the 
precision of the estimates, 
a second instrumental variable is used, namely the adjusted 
credit standards in loans to large firms.
80 The result, displayed in c
olumn
 3, is a very 
strong and precise effect: credit constraints reduce the probability of an increase in 
investment by 92
 percentage points, and the coefficient is significant at 5%.

 The results are conservative me
asures of the total impact of

i.e. businesses that shut down because of a lack of credit and firms that do not enter

dertake their investment 
projects.
 4 Conclusions
 It is not clear 
a priori 
that credit constraints should 
affect 
corporate 
investment
. In frictionless perfect capital markets, the Modigliani
-Miller theorem 
implies that a firm™s financing decisions are indep
endent from its investment 
decisions because internal and external funds are perfect substitutes. In practice, 
however, several factors 
mean that they are
 imperfect substitut
es, so financial 
constraints may have important effects on corporate investment. This article 
has 
reviewed the existing literature and provided new evidence based on a large sample 
of European firms.
 The available evidence suggests that financial constraints
 have important 
effects on the investment decisions of non
-financial corporations, highlighting 
the important role 
of monetary policy
 in alleviating them
. In the face of the 
recent
 financial crisis, central banks around the globe took unprecedented measure
s to
 repair the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and thereby reduced the 
financial constraints faced by households and firms.
82 These actions, in turn, may 
have spurred investment through the credit channel and their effect on the external 
finance 
premium paid by firms. Nevertheless, 
conclusions on 
the macroeconomic 
implications of the above studies, 
which are 
based on micro
-econometric evidence, 
should be drawn with caution, as th
e studies rely on partial equilibrium analyses and 
often use qualitat
ive survey

 The economic impact of pop

 85 2 The economic impact of population ageing and pension 
reforms
 Prepared b
y Carolin Nerlich and Joachim Schroth
 This article examines the macroeconomic and fiscal implications of population 
ageing in the euro area and looks at how 
pension reforms can help to address these 
challenges. According to Eurostat™s latest projections, population ageing is set to 
continue and even intensify in the euro area over the next few decades. This 
ongoing process, which stems from increases in life e
xpectancy and low fertility 
rates, is widely expected to lead to a decline in the labour supply and productivity 
losses, as well as behavioural changes, and is likely to have an adverse effect on 
potential growth. Moreover, by causing increases in precauti
onary savings, ageing 
can be expected to have a dampening impact on interest rates over an extended 
period of time.
 Population ageing also entails changes in relative prices, mainly 
owing to shifts in demand, with demand for services rising. Furthermore, e
uro area 
countries are also projected to experience further upward pressure on public 
spending on pensions, health care and long
-term care as their populations age.
 Although many euro area countries implemented pension reforms following the 
sovereign debt 
crisis, further reforms appear to be necessary in order to ensure 
fiscal sustainability in the long run. In this respect, measures that increase the 
retirement age can be expected to dampen the adverse macroeconomic effects of 
ageing, as they will have a f
avourable impact on the labour supply and domestic 
consumption. In contrast, increasing the contribution rate or reducing the benefit ratio 
could have less favourable macroeconomic implications.
 1 Introduction
 Population ageing in the euro area poses a num
ber of economic challenges.
 This ongoing process is widely expected to exert downward pressure on potential 
growth, the labour supply and the equilibrium interest rate. At the same time, ageing 
economies are expected to face higher age
-related fiscal costs
, which could pose 
risks to fiscal sustainability. Since consumption patterns are likely to change as 
populations age, this could also affect relative prices 
Œ which could, in turn, have 
implications for the transmission of monetary policy. The combination
 of all of these 
various effects adds to the challenges for monetary policy.
 This article analyses a number of important macroeconomic implications of 
population ageing and looks at how pension reforms could help to cushion 
that impact.
 It starts by lookin
g at Eurostat™s latest demographic projections and 
their main drivers, before going on to discuss the macroeconomic implications of 
ageing for potential growth, looking specifically at the labour supply, capital formation 
and total factor productivity. The
 adverse impact on growth is also examined using a 
highly stylised model framework. The article also discusses the effect on fiscal 
balances and debt sustainability, while the impact on relative prices via changes in 
consumption patterns is discussed in a 
dedicated box. The final section looks at the

also discussed in a separate box.
 2 Demographic developments in the euro area
 Euro area countries are facing significant demographic challenges, which are 
expected to have major economic implications.
 The total population of the euro 
area is projected to r
ise from 340
 million in 2016 to around 352
 million in 2040, 
before falling to 345
 million in 2070, according to Eurostat™s 2015 population 
projections.
83 In addition, the age structure of the euro area™s population is also set to 
change, with population age
ing expected to continue and intensify further. Those 
developments will be driven mainly by low birth rates, as well as further increases in 
life expectancy, while net migration flows will, on average, only partially mitigate the 
impact of ageing populatio
ns. There will also be major cohort effects, with the whole 
of the ﬁbaby boomer generationﬂ (i.e. the significant numbers of people who were 
born in the 1950s and 1960s) entering retirement over the next 20 years. It should be 
noted, however, that populati
on ageing is not restricted to the euro area. Indeed, it is 
a worldwide phenomenon affecting advanced economies (and some emerging 
market economies) around the globe. Population ageing is most advanced in 
Japan.
84 Population ageing is being driven by a numb
er of demographic trends.
 The 
average fertility rate in the euro area currently stands at 1.
6, which is significantly 
below the natural replacement level (i.e. the level that is thought to be necessary in 
order to keep the total population constant), which
 is around 2.1. Although Eurostat 
expects birth rates to increase slightly, they are forecast to remain well below the 
replacement level on average. Consequently, young people are set to account for a 
smaller percentage of the total population in the futur
e (see Chart
 1). Life expectancy 
is expected to continue rising, albeit more slowly than in the last few decades.
85 By 
2070, remaining life expectancy at the age of 65 will average 23.6
 years for men and 
26.9
 years for women
 Œ i.e. around 5
 years more than 
today. Increases in life 
expectancy, combined with cohort effects due to the ageing of the baby boomer 
generation, will contribute to a strong increase in the size of the old
-age cohort 
(i.e.
 the number of people aged 65 or over), as shown in Chart
 1. The 
size of that 
old
-age cohort is expected to peak in absolute terms in around 2050. At the level of 
the euro area as a whole, net migration flows are projected to only partially offset the 
decline in the working
-age population. Their impact is expected to di
minish further 
                                                                    83  See 
Euros
tat™s 2015 population projections
. Eurostat™s projections for the euro area are comparable to 
the latest UN population projections, although the UN™s forecasts are slightly more adverse in terms of 
the degree of population ageing.
 84  See OECD, 
Pensions at 
a Glance 2017
, 2017. In the case of Japan, the fiscal adjustment that is 
needed to stabilise government debt is estimated at 30
-40% of total consumption. See also Hansen, G.

 Age cohorts in the euro area
 (as a percentage of the total population)

calculations.
 The euro area™s old
-age dependency ratio, which is defined as the number of 
people aged 65 or over as a percentage of the working
-age population 
(i.e.
 people aged 15 to 64), is projected to be significantly higher by 2070.
 On 
the basis of Eur
ostat™s 2015 projections, the average old
-age dependency ratio in the 
euro area is expected to increase strongly, rising from slightly above 30% in 2016 to 
around 52% by 2070 (see Chart
 2). An increase in this ratio means a decline in the 
number of workers
 that are potentially available to take care of each pensioner, in 
the absence of any changes to the statutory retirement age.
86 This will entail a 
significant fiscal burden for the countries concerned in terms of their public pension 
systems.
                                                                     86  The old
-age dependency ratio that is used in this article relates to demographic dependency. This is 
different from the concept of economic dependency, which also takes account of other factors, such as 
the employment of older workers and differences
 in income patterns across age cohorts. When 
interpreting this old
-age dependency ratio, it is important to bear in mind that a country™s effective 
retirement age may be higher or lower than 65.

 Œ for 2016 (blue dots) and 2070 (orange dots).
 While all euro area countries will experience population ageing, the size of that 
demographic challenge will vary considerably across countries.
 The countries 
with the highest old
-age dependency rat
ios are currently Germany, Greece, Italy, 
Portugal and Finland (see Chart
 2). Old
-age dependency ratios are projected to 
increase by more than 35
 percentage points by 2070 in Cyprus, Portugal and 
Slovakia, with Portugal ending up with a ratio of 67%
 Œ the 
highest in the euro area. 
Ratios of 60% or more are also projected for Greece, Italy and Cyprus. In contrast, 
Ireland is forecast to have the lowest ratio in the euro area by 2070, while Belgium, 
Spain and France are projected to experience the smallest in
creases.
 The projected drivers of population ageing also differ across countries.
 The 
question of whether
 Œ and to what extent
 Œ ageing is driven by low fertility rates 
and/or increases in life expectancy has important consequences for the dynamics of 
population ageing and its economic and fiscal implications. According to Eurostat, life 
expectancy is forecast to increase in all euro area countries. However, the expected 
increases tend to be larger in those countries where life expectancy is currently 
lower
, with the largest increases expected in Latvia and Slovakia. Moreover, Eurostat 
expects the fertility rate to improve slightly in all countries except France (which will, 
however, continue to have the highest rate in the euro area). Projections regarding 
net migration show a high degree of cross
-country heterogeneity. For a few 
countries, those projections even show net migration outflows, which can be 
expected to further amplify the ageing problem.
 That being said, caution is required when assessing long
-term demographic 
trends.
 Population projections are strongly dependent on the underlying 
assumptions regarding fertility rates, life expectancy and migration flows. While all 
three components are surrounded by a certain degree of uncertainty, the uncertain
ty 
relating to migration flows is by far the highest. Consequently, population projections

often complemented by sensitivity analysis.
88 3 The economic impact of ageing
 3.1
 Implications for potential growth
 Population ageing stemming from increases in life 
expectancy and low fertility 
rates has the potential to exert downward pressure on all components of 
potential growth.
 However, behavioural changes and public choices in relation to 
ageing could serve to counteract those effects to some extent.
 Ageing can 
be expected to reduce the labour supply over time, since fewer 
young workers will be entering the labour force and older workers will tend to 
have lower participation rates.
 Low fertility rates reduce the size of younger 
cohorts, which can ultimately be ex
pected to reduce the labour supply and GDP per 
capita.
89 Having fewer dependent children initially leads, in relative terms, to an 
increase in the working
-age population as a percentage of the total population. 
However, o
nce those smaller cohorts reach work
ing age, there will be a downward 
impact on the working
-age population, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of 
the total population. An increase in life expectancy will lead to larger numbers of 
people reaching retirement age, which will increase th
e old
-age dependency ratio.
90 Ageing
-related changes in the population structure also affect the labour component 
of potential output via differences in age
-specific participation rates. Indeed, in 2016 
the participation rate for ﬁprime
-agersﬂ in the euro a
rea (defined as people between 
the ages of 25 and 54) stood at around 85%, significantly higher than the equivalent 
rates for older people between the ages of 55 and 64 (around 60%) and younger 
people under the age of 25 (around 40%). The impact that these
 factors have on the 
aggregate labour supply is expected to vary over time and be strongly dependent on 
the population structure. In the euro area, large cohorts of prime
-agers are set to 
become older people over the next ten years and reduce their partici
pation, while 
small cohorts of young people will become prime
-agers (see Chart
 3). Consequently, 
                                                                    87  See Maddaloni, A. et al., ﬁMacroeconomic implications of d

speaking, declining mortality rates for working

impact on the working

 Œ i.e.

 The economic impact of population ageing and pension reforms
 91 The main characteristics of Baksa and Munkacsi™s model can be summarised as follows:
 The 
model is a dynamic general equilibrium OLG model with an infinite time horizon. It is a 
closed
-economy model with price and labour market rigiditi
es, and monetary policy is characterised 
by a Taylor rule.
 Demography and nature of the ageing shock:
 The total population in each period is the sum of 
the working
-age cohort (i.e.
 people between the age of 20 and the retirement age) and the 
pensioner coho
rt (i.e.
 people who have reached the retirement age).
92 The total population changes 
over time, with workers being born and pensioners passing away on the basis of certain 
probabilities, which follow a predetermined path. Ageing is introduced in the form of
 a permanent 
10 percentage point increase in the old
-age dependency ratio, phased in over a 
30-year period, 
after which fertility and mortality rates are assumed to remain constant. The increase in the old
-age dependency ratio is modelled in such a way tha
t the relative importance of the fertility and mortality 
rates as driving factors resembles Eurostat™s 
2015 population projections for the euro area (see 
Section
 2). The ﬁlong
-termﬂ steady state values discussed below relate to a 
50-year period.
 Household 
sector:
 Households™ economic activity is divided into two phases: the working phase 
and the retirement phase. During the working phase, households either work (in which case, they 
receive income and pay income tax) or are unemployed (in which case, they re
ceive unemployment 
benefits). They use their net incomes and benefits for consumption and precautionary saving. 
During the retirement phase, households do not work and instead receive pension benefits. 
Depending on the probability of dying in the next peri
od of the model, they will also spend some or 
all of their savings on consumption.
 Production sector and labour market rigidities:
 The model includes two types of firm, producing 
physical capital goods and consumption goods respectively. Those goods
-produc
ing firms hire 
workers and use physical capital, subject to an exogenous technological process (assuming a 
Cobb
-Douglas production function). Firms take account of price adjustment costs when setting 
prices. Moreover, the model assumes labour market rigidi
ties owing to hiring costs and wage 
bargaining, which influence the level of unemployment.
 Fiscal sector:
 The fiscal sector includes various kinds of public revenue (personal income tax, 
social security contributions, VAT, etc.) and public expenditure (pen
sion benefits, unemployment 
benefits and government consumption). In order to account for the diversity in euro area countries™ 
pension systems, it is assumed that three
-quarters of pension benefits are based on the 
pay-as-you
-go principle and one
-quarter 
is based on a fully funded scheme. In the initial steady 
state without population ageing, the pension system is assumed to be in balance. The government 
is able to issue bonds to balance the government budget.
 The long
-term results for the euro area sugges
t that ageing mainly affects the economy via 
the labour market and changes to consumption and savings.
 Table A presents the stylised 
long
-term steady state results of an ageing shock under the assumption that no consolidation 
measures are adopted to counte
ract that shock™s impact on public debt (reference scenario with no 
consolidation). Following that ageing shock (i.e.
 the 10
 percentage point rise in the old

graphic part of the model is 
based on Gertler, M., ﬁGovernment debt and social security in a life
-cycle economyﬂ,

-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy

youth model with life

as the probability of retiring and dying, which can be

 92 dependency ratio), the ratio of workers to pensioners declines. As comparatively fewer people 
are 
in work, the labour supply and employment decline. Moreover, private consumption per capita also 
declines, as workers in particular reduce their consumption. Instead, workers increase their 
precautionary savings by investing in government bonds, in ord
er to smooth their consumption over 
a longer period in retirement. Pensioners dissave more gradually in view of their rising life 
expectancy. Private investment declines only marginally. Overall, the ageing shock results in GDP 
per capita declining by 4.7%
. The real interest rate falls as the ratio of capital to labour increases on 
account of the shortage of labour supply. Total pension costs 
rise
 owing to an increase in the 
number of pensioners, while revenue from VAT declines on account of a fall in consu
mption. In the 
reference scenario, fiscal instruments are kept constant, so the additional spending on pensions is 
financed entirely via debt. Thus, the ageing shock results in the government debt
-to
-GDP ratio 
rising almost 60
 percentage points in the long
 run (reaching unsustainable levels in the absence of 
policy adjustments). Variations of this scenario will be discussed in Section
 4. Nonetheless, when interpreting these results, one has to remember that the model is based

mptions.
 It assumes, for example, that the economy is closed, 
that there are only two types of cohort and that only two types of good are produced. Moreover, this 
model looks at the euro area as a whole and does not, therefore, account for any cross
-countr
y heterogeneity. Thus, these results are not a suitable basis on which to make concrete 
recommendations at country level.

may also have an adverse effect on aggregate total factor productivity,

 Several studies have found significant negative 
effects on aggregate labour productivity as a result of an ageing workforce.

 The economic impact of population ageing and pension reforms
 93 effect of ageing could 
materialise via weaker growth in total factor productivity, which 
captures underlying productivity growth derived from more efficient production 
processes and technological progress. This may be explained by the hump
-shaped 
distribution of average producti
vity across cohorts that has been found by some 
studies, which may be related to a slowdown in the adoption of the latest technology 
as age increases (with statistics showing, for example, a reduction in workers™ 
participation in training with increasing a
ge) or a deterioration in the health of some 
older workers.
94 However, there may also be countervailing forces mitigating any adverse 
effects on productivity.
 Low fertility rates may, for example, allow for stronger 
investment in human capital per child. Fu
rthermore, the scarcity of labour could 
increase the return to investment in human capital and thus incentivise training in the 
course of a person™s working life (i.e.
 ﬁlifelong learningﬂ), particularly when 
accompanied by increases in the retirement age. 
Finally, for white
-collar 
occupations, the benefits of accumulated experience and expertise may continue to 
develop throughout a person™s working life. Thus, structural shifts towards 
knowledge
-based sectors, in which high productivity levels can be mainta
ined 
throughout people™s working lives, could limit the downward impact that ageing has 
on future productivity.
 The impact that ageing has on private savings can be expected to vary over 
time in line with the population structure, but it will also be depen
dent on how 
households and firms react to an ageing society.
 The life
-cycle hypothesis of 
savings states that people will smooth consumption over their lifetimes by 
accumulating savings during their working lives and then running those savings 
down during 
their retirement. Changes to the population structure will thus have a 
mechanical impact on aggregate savings via differences in age
-specific savings 
ratios. In the euro area, the expected increase in the number of pensioners as a 
percentage of the total p
opulation between now and 2070 implies a shift from savers 
to dissavers, which suggests that th
is will 
have
 a downward impact on aggregate 
savings in the long run. Over the next ten years, however, this effect on savings 
might not be visible as a result of
 the sizeable baby boomer generation becoming 
elderly workers. Since this age group is the one with the highest savings rate, per 
capita savings are likely to increase in the short term. In addition to these shifts in 
age cohorts, ageing may also cause hou
seholds to change their saving behaviour. 
As life expectancy increases, households may save more during their working lives, 
anticipating that those savings will have to see them through a longer period in 
retirement. This is also supported by the model re
sults in Box
 1. Low fertility rates 
may also have a positive effect on the savings of the working
-age population by 
                                                                    94  See, for example, European Commission,

, ﬁThe Impact of Wo
rkforce Aging on European 
Productivityﬂ,

and estimates that ageing may reduce aggregate total factor productivity growth in the EU by 
0.2
 percentage point per year over the
 next 20 years. The estimated drag on GDP growth varies across 
countries depending on the population structure. For example, it is small in Germany, where a series of 
large cohorts are about to retire, and it is large in Spain, where the number of prime
-ag
e workers is set 
to decline strongly over the next 20 years as a percentage of the total working
-age population.

 94 reducing consumption needs relating to the raising of children.
95 Fiscal policies and 
the type of underlying pension system may also have a r
ole to play by encouraging 
people to save more during their working lives.
 The impact on investment and capital accumulation will depend, inter alia, on 
the responsiveness of return rates, the openness of the economy and the 
relative ageing profiles of the
 various countries.
 The downward pressure that 
ageing exerts on the labour force can be expected to reduce the price of capital 
relative to labour. Assuming that capital and labour are substitutes (at least to some 
extent), this will lead to capital deepen
ing and result in investment being affected 
less negatively than the labour force (as can also be seen from the simulation in 
Box
 1). This could, for example, be a result of declines in the size of households as a 
consequence of ageing, which will see the 
number of households and the need for 
housing investment remaining 
broadly 
unchanged.
96 Such capital deepening will 
exert downward pressure on returns to capital. However, in open economies with no 
capital controls, savings do not have to be invested domest
ically and can be 
absorbed by capital exports, which will reduce the pressure on domestic returns to 
capital.
97 Indeed, several studies have found evidence of capital flows from ﬁolderﬂ 
countries to countries with more favourable demographics.
98 Box

-based discussion looking at the amount of downward pressure on the 
euro area™s equilibrium real interest rate that can probably be attributed to 
demographic factors and pension reforms for the period up to 2030.

 Fiscal balances
 and sustainability
 Population ageing will place further upward pressure on the already elevated 
levels of age
-related public spending.
 The European Commission™s 2015 Ageing 
Report anticipates public expenditure on pensions, health care and long

rising from 21% of GDP in 2013 to 23% of GDP in 2060 (see Chart

99 These

 Pay
-as-you
-go pension schemes will be particularly affected.
 As populations 
age, the number o
f beneficiaries of public pension schemes will increase, while the 
number of contributors is expected to decline, resulting in deficits unless parameters 
are adjusted. In fact, demographic effects alone are projected to raise pension 
expenditure by an aver
age of 
7.6%
 of GDP in the euro area over the period 
2013-60 (see Chart
 5). This effect is, however, expected to be almost entirely offset by 
changes to other important drivers of pension expenditure, such as declines in the 
coverage ratio or the benefit ra
tio.
100 While these changes reflect reform measures in 
a number of euro area countries, they are also driven by favourable underlying 
macroeconomic assumptions.
101 At euro area level, pension expenditure is projected 
to remain at its current high level of more
 than 12% of GDP in the long run, 
notwithstanding considerable cross
-country heterogeneity.
102                                                                     100  The coverage ratio is defined as the number of pensioners relative to the number of people aged 65 or 
over. The coverage ratio could, for example, be reduced by restricting eligibility for early retirement. The 
benefit ra
tio, meanwhile, is defined as the average pension relative to the average wage. The benefit 
ratio declines as pension entitlements become less generous.
 101  The projections in the 2015 Ageing Report are based on fairly optimistic underlying macroeconomic 
as
sumptions. For example, they assume that countries™ structural unemployment rates will converge 
with the EU average, which implies huge declines in some cases. Moreover, they also assume that 
annual growth in total factor productivity will rise to 1% of GD
P in all EU countries. For a critical 
assessment of those underlying assumptions, see the box entitled ﬁThe 2015 Ageing Report: How 
costly will ageing in Europe be?ﬂ, 
Economic Bulletin
, Issue
 4, ECB, 2015. The macroeconomic 
assumptions underlying the 2015 
Ageing Report are very different from those contained in the model 
that was presented in Box
 1.
 102  According to the 2015 Ageing Report, some countries, such as Germany, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia 
and Slovakia, are projected to experience significant press
ure on pension spending, while pressures 
are projected to weaken considerably in France, Italy and Latvia.

 Populati
on ageing will also increase spending on health care and long
-term 
care.
 According to the projections in the 2015 Ageing Report, spending on health 
care and long
-term care as a percentage of GDP is projected to rise by an average 
of 0.7 and 1.3
 percentage 
points respectively over the period 
2013-60 (see Chart
 6). 
Indeed, older people are more likely to make use of healthcare services, which in 
Europe are predominantly provided by the public sector. It should be noted, however, 
that population ageing is only
 one factor driving healthcare costs 
Œ and not 
necessarily the most important.
103 Meanwhile, spending on long
-term care is also 
expected to rise, as such care is increasingly being provided by professional 
suppliers, rather than via intra
-family support, par
tly as a result of increases in 
female labour market participation. Finally, public spending on education is expected 
to decline as the number of young people gradually falls as a percentage of the total 
population, partially offsetting the rising expendit
ure discussed above.
104                                                                     103  Healthcare costs are driven, inter alia, by technological progress, demand for higher

services and growth in GDP per capita (as
suming that the income elasticity of demand for healthcare 
services is higher than one). See also European Commission, ﬁ

es The economic impact of population ageing and pension reforms
 98 The impact of ageing on public revenues is inconclusive, owing to the different 
time profiles and the fact that the effects on the various tax bases partially 
offset one another.
 On the one hand, revenue from personal incom
e tax is likely to 
decline as the labour force shrinks, assuming that tax rates remain unchanged. 
Revenue from VAT is also expected to decline, as population ageing is likely to have 
an adverse impact on private consumption.
105 Moreover, as is pointed out in
 Box
 2 on relative prices, ageing may result in a shift towards higher demand for specific 
services. If these services benefit from tax exemptions, as is currently the case for 
healthcare services in several countries, revenue from VAT is likely to fall ev
en further as a result of ageing. On the other hand, an increased propensity to save 
owing to increases in life expectancy (or in the case of a shift towards fully funded 
pension systems) can be expected to boost revenue from capital taxes. The 
economic re
levance of changes to tax revenues caused by dissaving after retirement 
is, however, more difficult to predict and requires closer examination of 
country
-specific tax provisions.
 Overall, population ageing is expected to place a burden on fiscal 
sustainabi
lity.
 Higher age
-related primary deficits are expected to contribute to 
higher government debt
-to
-GDP ratios. Converting the projected additional 
age-related spending into a net present value provides an indication of the implicit 
liability that is caused 
by ageing and the fiscal adjustment that is needed in order to 
fulfil the intertemporal adjustment constraint.
106 In other words, additional public 
savings are needed in order to prevent government debt levels from increasing on 
account of ageing. Moreover, 
debt dynamics hinge crucially on the 
interest
-rate
-growth differential. To the extent that ageing has an unfavourable impact 
on real GDP growth, as was suggested in the previous section, public debt levels will 
become harder to sustain. If, however, ageing
 also contributes to a decline in the 
equilibrium real interest rate, as is suggested in Box
 4, this will, instead, help to 
support debt sustainability. Thus, the overall impact of ageing depends on which of 
these opposing effects prevails. Ageing could ma
ke it more difficult to ensure debt 
sustainability if interest rates decline by less than real economic growth.
 Box
 2  Population ageing and relative prices
 Prepared b
y Eliza Lis
 There is evidence that the consumption patterns of the elderly differ from th
ose of younger 
cohorts.
 Thus, population ageing has the potential to affect the relative prices of goods and 
services, particularly if changes in relative consumption demand do not result in corresponding 
changes in relative supply. Changes in relative pri
ces are typically regarded as steering the 
allocation of resources and may therefore play a key role in structural changes in the different 
sectors of the economy.
                                                                     105  See also Table
 A in Box
 1.
 106  According to the European Commission™s 
Debt Sustainability Monitor 2017
, eu
ro area countries require 
a structural adjustment totalling 0.4% of GDP per annum on account of population ageing in order to 
achieve a debt
-to-GDP ratio of 60% i
n the medium term (the ﬁS1 indicatorﬂ) and an adjustment totalling 
1.3% of GDP in order to ensure that public debt stabilises permanently at the current level (the 
ﬁS2 indicatorﬂ).

 99 Empirical evidence suggests that the elderly spend more, in relative terms, on services 
(par
ticularly non
-tradable services) than younger cohorts.
107 Chart
 A shows how the structure 
of household consumption expenditure differs across age groups in the euro area, showing that the 
elderly spend more on housing and healthcare services and less on clot
hing and transport.
108 109 Such changes in consumption patterns can reflect both passive consumption behaviour (for 
instance, if housing
-related expenditure remains unchanged post
-retirement and accounts for a 
larger share of consumption on account of a declin
e in disposable income) and active changes in 
consumption demand (for instance, if transport costs fall because a person is no longer commuting 
to work or if more health care is needed as a result of the ageing process itself). More generally, 
changes in t
he composition of consumption demand will depend on items™ income
-elasticities, which 
may well change as consumers get older. For instance, health care may become more of a 
necessity as people get older (reduction in elasticity), while transport may become
 more of a luxury 
(increase in elasticity).

 The economic impact of population ageing and pension reforms
 100 If agei
ng entails an increase in the overall consumption of services relative to goods, this 
could have an impact on the output prices of services sectors relative to industry.
 Indeed, the 
relative price of services will increase if supply does not rise in line w
ith demand. This, in turn, will 
depend on how elastic supply is in reacting to price changes, which will be determined, inter alia, by 
how readily available or mobile the necessary factors of production are. Ultimately, therefore, it will 
be the interactio
n between the age
-elasticity of demand and the price
-elasticity of supply that 
determines where relative prices end up.
 Looking purely at observed data, Chart
 B shows that the price of services relative to 
industry has increased on average since 1995 in mo
st euro area countries, following an 
increase in the share of services in total value added in those economies.
110 Chart
 C shows 
that increases in the output prices of the services sector relative to industry have coincided with 
increases in the old
-age depe
ndency ratio in some euro area countries. These simple correlations 
do not control for other factors, such as differential impacts on services and industry prices as a 
result of secular change and international competition, but they are in line with recent
 findings in the 
literature. Groneck and Kaufmann,
111 for example, control for various explanatory variables in their 
estimations and show that an increase in the old
-age dependency ratio leads to an increase in the 
relative price of non
-tradables.

 Notes: The price of servi
ces relative to industry is the ratio of the deflator for services to the deflator for industry excluding construction. Those

longer time series, output prices are used here. The same approach is adopted in other literature on 
this topic.

 The euro area has generally seen services prices in the HICP rise more rapidly than 
non-energy industrial goods prices over the last few decades.
 At the same time, services also 
account for a
 growing share of the economy. While there may be a number of reasons for these 
developments, such as differentials in terms of sectoral productivity trends or the impact of global 
competition, they may also reflect an increase in relative demand owing to 
population ageing.
112 With population ageing expected to intensify, these trends may strengthen in the years to come.
  4 The role of pension reforms
 4.1
 Pension reforms in the euro area
 Many euro area countries have implemented pension reforms in recent year
s. The sovereign debt crisis and rises in public debt levels have increased the need to 
reform public pension systems.
113 Pension reforms have been particularly substantial 
in countries that have been subject to adjustment programmes, such as Greece, 
Spain, 
Cyprus and Portugal. Those reforms have involved a wide range of 
measures, affecting pension system rules as well as pension parameters. In general, 
recent parametric pension reforms have sought mainly to lift the effective retirement 
age, while several co
untries have also reduced the generosity of their pension 
systems. For example, countries have introduced less generous valuation rules for 
                                                                    112  See the box entitled ﬁWhy is services inflation higher than goods inflation in the euro area?ﬂ,

 113  Public pension sys
tems comprise all schemes that are statutory in nature and administered by the 
general government sector, in line with the definition used in the Ageing Reports. Accordingly, public 
pension expenditure affects the national accounts.

 102 transforming pensionable earnings into pension entitlements, increased the required 
number of working years when cal
culating pensionable earnings, or shifted from 
wage to price indexation of pensions.
114 Some countries have also implemented 
automatic adjustment mechanisms linking key pension parameters to increases in 
life expectancy in order to make their public pension 
systems more sustainable. 
However, systemic pension reforms foreseeing a full or partial shift from 
pay-as-you
-go schemes to fully funded schemes have been fairly limited among euro 
area countries over the last decade.
115 Despite recent progress, there is a 
risk of complacency.
 Those recent reforms to 
public pension systems may not be sufficient to fully address euro area countries™ 
ageing
-related challenges. While they have certainly been helpful in terms of 
improving the financial sustainability of public p
ension systems, further efforts are 
indispensable in order to contain 
or further reduce 
the relatively high levels of 
pension expenditure in GDP terms. However, the pace of reform seems to have 
slowed of late. One possible explanation for this is the fact 
that, with an economic 
recovery under way and the impact of the sovereign debt crisis subsiding, 
governments are now under less pressure to implement pension reforms.
116 Indeed, 
there is empirical evidence supporting the view that business cycle developments
, 
rather than concerns about the financial sustainability of pension systems, are the 
most important drivers of pension reforms.
117 Because of the considerable political 
costs in the short term, governments seem to have less appetite for implementing 
pension
 reforms during economic good times. Against this background, countries 
would be well advised to give themselves a buffer. There is no room for complacency 
in this regard, as pension pressures could turn out to be stronger than expected
 Œ e.g.
 if economic 
developments turn out to be less favourable than pension cost 
projections assume (see also Section
 3.2). Thus, euro area countries should use 
today™s improved economic environment to implement better long
-term policies in 
order to address the challenges po
sed by population ageing.
118 The reform needs in the euro area vary considerably across countries.
 Differences relate both to the size of those reform needs and to the specific type of 
adjustment that is needed in each country. Identifying the reform measure
s that 
would be most appropriate for the various countries would involve taking account of 
the variety and complexity of countries™ pension arrangements and lies outside the 
scope of this article. Euro area averages could serve as a rough benchmark for 
                                                                    114  For a detailed overv

ividual measures. However, as the various pension parameters are strongly 
interlinked, it is important to adopt a much broader perspective when it comes to 
designing specific reforms. For example, reducing pension entitlements via cuts in 
pension valuation
 or indexation rules could be advisable in the case of a very 
generous pension system relative to the euro area average. However, such a policy 
could be less relevant if there are already other provisions seeking to ensure fiscal 
sustainability (e.g.
 a hig
h effective retirement age). It is clear, therefore, that the 
decision as to which type of pension reform is best is highly country
-specific. This 
also limits the usefulness of ranking such measures in terms of their potential impact 
on public finances whe
n making country
-specific recommendations.
 Political economy considerations highlight the role of social acceptance of 
pension reforms and the timing of their adoption.
 While the benefits of pension 
reforms will only become visible with a lag, their politi
cal costs have to be borne 
immediately. Thus, in order to ensure broad support for those reforms, countries are
 advis
ed not to place the 
full 
adjustment burden on 
a single
 feature
, but to carry out 
the necessary adjustment by combining several reform eleme
nts. If, for example, 
adjustment needs were met solely by means of abrupt cuts to pension entitlements, 
this could, in extreme cases, potentially endanger pension adequacy. By adopting a 
more balanced approach, adjustment costs can be spread more widely ac
ross 
society, allowing older and younger generations to share that burden more equally. 
Moreover, the political costs of pension reforms tend to increase the later they are 
implemented. As the median voter is ageing, the political cost of adopting pension 
reforms is likely to increase over time
119 Œ as will the adjustment burden for the 
younger generation.
 4.2
 The macroeconomic effects of pension reforms
 Pension reforms are not only necessary for long
-term fiscal sustainability, they 
can generally also help t
o dampen the adverse macroeconomic effects of 
ageing.
 The concrete impact that public pension reforms have on macroeconomic 
variables such as the labour force, employment or public debt is strongly dependent 
on the reform measures adopted. Consequently, it
 is possible to compare the various 
reform options on the basis of their respective macroeconomic implications, while 
ignoring country
-specific structural differences.

 The economic impact of population ageing and pension reforms
 104 a model simulation exercise with three different kin
ds of pension reform, which is 
based on the stylised model framework introduced in Box 1.
 Lifting the statutory and effective retirement ages, in line with increases in life 
expectancy, is expected to have a strongly positive impact on the labour 
supply 
and economic growth.
 Lengthening people™s working lives (for example, by 
reducing early retirement or increasing the statutory retirement age) effectively 
increases the size of the active labour force relative to the number of pensioners.
121 Moreover, if tha
t increase in the retirement age is complemented by appropriate 
labour market measures, the additional older workers will be unlikely to crowd out 
younger workers.
122 Longer expected working lives will also increase incentives for 
lifelong learning and the a
ccumulation of human capital, both of which are 
growth
-enhancing. Moreover, longer working lives can also be expected to reduce 
the financing pressures on public pension systems through increases in pension 
contributions. While this will also imply increas
ed pension entitlements for the next 
generation, it can be expected to contribute to improvements in pension adequacy.
 Increases in contribution rates are assumed to have less favourable economic 
implications.
 Raising contribution rates may improve the fin
ancing of pay
-as-you
-go pension systems. However, such measures actually have the potential to exacerbate 
the macroeconomic effects of population ageing, rather than dampening them. In 
particular, the distortionary effects of higher contribution rates on t
he labour supply 
and employment can result in weaker economic growth.
123 Likewise, cutting the benefit ratio is, ceteris paribus, also potentially less 
favourable than lifting the retirement age.
 Cutting pension entitlements can have 
detrimental macroeconomi
c effects via reductions in domestic demand. Pensioners 
are likely to respond to reduced pension transfers by cutting back on consumption. 
The working
-age population may, in turn, increase precautionary savings in view of 
the reduction in future pension en
titlements.

 To this end, Table

ageing shock and an absence of consolidation measures) in terms of the euro area average. The

reform measures is, ceteris paribus, determined by the objective of preventing 
population ageing from having an adverse impact on public debt, as established in Box

 The economic impact of populati
on ageing and pension reforms
 105 exercise seeks to provide a general indication of the potential long
-term macroecon
omic effects of 
three different kinds of public pension reform, assessing them one at a time. It does not, however, 
address the question of which type of reform measure is most appropriate for which euro area 
country, given that this issue is highly countr
y-specific. The three types of pension reform under 
assessment involve changes to the retirement age, the contribution rate and the benefit ratio. In 
addition, this exercise also considers an increase in personal income tax to compensate for the 
impact tha
t ageing has on public debt.
 The results of this exercise point to considerable differences in terms of the macroeconomic 
effects of the three pension reforms.
 These simulations suggest that raising the retirement age 
has the potential to considerably redu
ce the adverse impact that ageing has on growth. In concrete 
terms, this means that GDP per capita declines by 3.6% less than in the reference scenario (see 
Table
 A).
124 In contrast, simply increasing contribution rates or personal income tax
es result
s in th
e adverse macroeconomic impact strengthening, rather than weakening, relative to the reference 
scenario. This is driven largely by stronger negative effects on consumption per capita and 
employment. Finally, reducing the benefit ratio such that the ageing
-related adverse impact on debt 
is avoided results in GDP per capita falling only marginally less than in the reference scenario. 
Thus, on the basis of this stylised model framework, we can conclude that pension reforms that 
seek to prolong people™s working
 lives appear to be at least partly able to address the adverse 
macroeconomic effects of ageing.

125 Moving to a fully funded pension scheme 
would make pension shortfalls more transparent. This could encourage increases in 
domestic savings, whi
ch could also turn out to be beneficial for asset markets. 
However, a move towards higher levels of mandatory funding generally entails a 
double burden for those generations who are continuing to contribute to the 
pay-as-you
-go system for existing pensione
rs while simultaneously having to build 
up their own pension savings. Moreover, fully funded pension schemes can pose 
risks to household finances in an environment of low or negative asset returns, for 
example in the presence of low equilibrium interest ra
tes.
126 Administration costs and 
risky investment strategies can further erode the benefits of funded arrangements.
 Finally, forces relating to ageing and pension reforms can be expected to play 
a significant role in respect of monetary policy.
 As was stress
ed in previous 
sections, these forces will influence the euro area™s equilibrium real interest rate for 
the foreseeable future. Moreover, they may also affect central bank objectives. Box
 4 discusses aspects that are relevant from a monetary policy perspec
tive.
 Box 
4  Monetary policy implications of population ageing and pension reforms
 Prepared b
y Leopold von Thadden
 Forces relating to population ageing and the reform of pension systems matter for monetary 
policy from both a positive and a normative perspe
ctive, as they may affect the margin for 
interest rate changes, as well as the objectives of central banks.
 This box provides an overview 
of the various aspects that are relevant in this regard.
127 Forces relating to population ageing and pension reforms are
 a slow
-moving driver of the 
equilibrium real interest rate, a variable that is important when judging the monetary policy 
stance for any given inflation objective.
128 As various studies have pointed out, past and 
projected future demographic forces place sl
ow-moving downward pressure on the euro area™s 
equilibrium real interest rate, in line with the developments observed in many other jurisdictions. On 
the basis of a small
-scale New Keynesian model enriched with a demographic structure, Kara and 
Thadden off
er model
-based long
-term simulations for the euro area (starting in 2008 and running 
until 2030) which allow likely effects to be broken down into those attributable to ﬁpureﬂ 
demographic forces and those related to various pension system designs.
129 That st
udy confirms 
that two major demographic forces, namely the declining growth rate of the working
-age population 
and increases in life expectancy, are contributing independently to declines in the equilibrium real 
                                                                    125  See OECD,

 107 interest rate.
130 The first force is consisten
t with long
-term predictions by standard growth models,
131 while the second operates through life
-cycle effects on savings and consumption, as typically 
addressed by OLG models.
132 The study shows that the strength of the second force depends 
critically on how
 pension systems respond to demographic changes, since pension arrangements
 Œ both existing and expected future arrangements
 Œ interact directly with life
-cycle motives for 
savings. These insights are quantified in two polar scenarios.
133 First, the cumulati
ve long
-term 
effect on the equilibrium real interest rate will be most pronounced in a scenario in which the rise in 
the old
-age dependency ratio encourages additional private savings by workers, assuming an 
unchanged retirement age and a ceiling on the am
ount of tax
-financed redistribution from workers 
to pensioners. In this scenario (which strengthens privately funded elements), the cumulative 
decline in the period to 2030 totals around 110
 basis points. In contrast, this effect would be 
significantly red
uced in a second scenario where it was assumed that pensions would continue to 
be funded via a pay
-as-you
-go system, leading to an increase in tax
-financed redistribution from 
workers to pensioners. In this alternative scenario (which reduces, ceteris pari
bus, incentives for 
workers to save), the cumulative decline totals around 50
 basis points.
134 Besides forces relating to ageing and pension reforms, equilibrium interest rates are also 
affected by a wide range of other factors.
 Recent literature points to a
 number of complementary 
structural channels which can explain the decline in equilibrium interest rates from a general 
equilibrium perspective. The evidence documented in the literature emphasises, inter alia, 
productivity
-driven aspects of secular stagna
tion, slow balance sheet repair in the aftermath of the 
financial crisis, and the scarcity of safe assets. Moreover, the openness of an economy is relevant 
for the quantitative strength of all of these channels.
135                                                                     130  Given the focus on long
-term developments, the equilibrium interest rate is driven by changes in the 
ratio of capital to labour.
 131  In the same vein, the Solow growth model predicts that, in a steady
-state comparis
on, a decline in 
population growth will lead, ceteris paribus, to a decline in the equilibrium real interest rate.
 132  The second force tends to support a degree of recovery in the equilibrium interest rate when dissaving 
effects start to dominate, before f
ading away if demographic variables settle again at new stable 
long
-term values. Adopting a global perspective, this reversal effect was emphasised, in particular, in 
Goodhart, C. and Pradhan, M., ﬁDemographics will reverse three multi
-decade global trends
ﬂ, op. cit.
 133  The quantitative findings summarised in this box are similar in magnitude to those reported in:

these studies draw on OLG models in order to assess the combined effect of demographic changes

 134  The study also looks at intermediate policy options in terms of pension design. For example, in the first 
scenario, the effect would be mitigated if the retirement age were to increase, commensurate with the 
increase in life expectancy,
 offsetting the life
-cycle effect supporting additional private savings.

 The economic impact of population ageing and pension reforms
 108 The above
-mentioned cumulative impact on eq
uilibrium real interest rates will play out 
slowly over time, given the slow
-moving nature of demographic changes.
 Nevertheless, it is 
important that this impact is recognised by monetary policymakers. By way of illustration, Kara and 
Thadden consider an e
nvironment with sticky prices in which the reaction function of monetary 
policy is characterised by a Taylor rule. If that rule fails to incorporate the downward pressure on the 
equilibrium rate in a sufficiently timely manner, there is a risk of an overly
 tight monetary policy 
stance and downward pressure on inflation. However, in line with the long
-term neutrality of money, 
the study also shows that such pressure disappears in the presence of flexible prices, an 
assumption that is typically used when char
acterising the long
-term developments discussed in this 
box.
136 If equilibrium real interest rates were to stay at low levels for a protracted period of time, this 
would have implications for the conduct of monetary policy.
 With an unchanged inflation 
object
ive, monetary policy would be likely to face challenges arising from the lower bound constraint 
on nominal interest rates more often. This would naturally mean that other monetary policy tools, 
such as forward guidance and non
-standard measures, would have
 to complement the 
conventional interest rate channel more frequently than in the past.
137 Moreover, macro
-prudential 
tools could gain in importance in the event that frequently used non
-standard monetary policy tools 
were regarded as being conducive to risk
s to financial stability that needed to be contained.
 As regards normative aspects, a central bank™s objectives can be shaped by the age 
structure of the economy and its interaction with pension system design.
 It has traditionally 
been acknowledged that ﬁo
lderﬂ societies attach more weight to price stability than to the 
stabilisation of output and employment
 Œ both in terms of the preferred long
-term level of the price 
stability objective and in terms of the adjustment speed when returning to this level in 
response to 
shocks. This finding reflects the fact that cohorts may well express differing degrees of aversion to 
inflation over their lifetimes, for example because of age
-specific exposure to labour market 
incomes. More nuanced findings emerge if one als
o considers the role of cohort
-specific portfolio 
compositions and recognises that people typically rely more on returns from asset accumulation as 
they get older. Thus, ageing societies typically develop a more pronounced preference for financial 
                                                                    136  The study confirms that, consistent with the long
-term neutrality o
f money, downward pressure on 
inflation can emerge in an environment characterised by sticky prices (as opposed to flexible prices). 
Moreover, it will disappear if the central bank can correctly identify the decline in the equilibrium rate in 
real time. Th
e study shows numerically how, in the absence of such identification, that pressure can be 
addressed by responding more strongly to deviations of observed inflation from the central bank™s 
inflation objective. For details of related work which identifies a
 downward bias in inflation if central 
banks learn about the impact that demographic processes have on the equilibrium interest rate over 
time, see Bielecki, M. et al., ﬁThe demographic transition and monetary policy in a small open 
economyﬂ, mimeo, 2018. 
Moreover, a number of empirical studies have emerged more recently which, 
deviating from the long
-term neutrality of money, suggest that there might be links between ageing and 
inflation in the long run. However, these studies point in opposing directions 
in terms of the impact on 
aggregate inflation, depending on the country and time period in question. For instance, both

 The economic impact of population ageing and pension reforms
 109 stabilit
y, particularly where the ageing process has been accompanied by a strengthening of 
privately funded elements of pension systems.
138  5 Conclusions
 This article finds that population ageing will have major macroeconomic and 
fiscal implications for the euro 
area.
 In particular, ageing will lead to a decline in 
the labour supply and is likely to have adverse effects on productivity, while the 
implications for savings and investment will vary over time, depending on the relative 
size of the various cohorts and 
behavioural changes. Model simulations broadly 
support these findings. Population ageing will also entail changes to relative prices, 
mainly owing to shifts in demand, with demand for services rising. There will also be 
additional upward pressure on public
 spending on pensions, health care and 
long
-term care. This will make it challenging for euro area countries to reduce their 
sizeable debt burdens and ensure fiscal sustainability in the long run.
 Against this background, many countries implemented pension
 reforms 
following the sovereign debt crisis, although the pace of reform has slowed of 
late.
 Further reforms in this area would seem to be essential and should not be 
delayed, also in view of political economy considerations.
 While pension reforms will he
lp to contain the fiscal impact of population 
ageing, their precise macroeconomic implications may vary considerably 
depending on the specific nature of those reform measures.
 In particular, 
increasing the retirement age can be expected to reduce the adver
se 
macroeconomic effects of ageing, thanks to a favourable impact on the labour supply 
and domestic consumption. In contrast, reducing the benefit ratio will tend to do very 
little to tackle those macroeconomic effects, while increasing the contribution ra
te will 
actually tend to exacerbate them. These findings are supported by model 
simulations. That being said, these results are, by construction, merely a general 
assessment of the macroeconomic effects of pension reforms and do not allow 
conclusions to be
 drawn regarding the reform agendas of specific countries. At the 
same time, forces relating to population ageing and pension reforms are a 
slow
-moving determinant of the equilibrium real interest rate and need to be taken 
into account by a price stability
-oriented monetary policy.
                                                                     138  For a more detailed discussion, see Miles, D., ﬁShould moneta
