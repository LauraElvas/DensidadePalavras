  2 Update on economic and monetary 
developments
 Summary
 The incoming information that has
 become available since the Governing Council™s 
monetary policy meeting in September, while somewhat weaker than expected, 
remains overall consistent with an ongoing broad
-based expansion of the euro area 
economy and gradually rising inflation pressures. T
he risks surrounding the euro area 
growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. At the same time, risks 
relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market 
volatility remain prominent. Yet, the underlying streng
th of the economy continues to 
support the Governing Council™s confidence that the sustained convergence of 
inflation to its aim will continue in the period ahead and will be maintained even after a 
gradual winding
-down of the net asset purchases. Neverthe
less, significant monetary 
policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build
-up of domestic price 
pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. This support 
will continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the 
end of the year, by the 
sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by the 
Governing Council™s enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates. In any 
event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instru
ments as 
appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards
 its aim in a sustained 
manner.
 Survey indicators of global economic growth have weakened recently as the global 
economic cycle matures. The global trade momentum has moderated amid ong
oing 
actions and threats regarding trade tariff increases by the United States and possible 
retaliation by affected countries, but the near
-term outlook remains steady. Global 
financial conditions remain supportive for advanced economies
, while creating 
headwinds for emerging market economies.
 In the euro area, sovereign bond yields have risen amid an increase in global risk
-free 
rates and rising tensions in the sovereign debt markets of some euro area countries. 
Euro area equity prices have declined, refle
cting a deterioration in risk sentiment. By 
contrast, yield spreads on corporate bonds have remained broadly unchanged. In 
foreign exchange markets, the euro has been broadly stable in trade
-weighted terms.
 Euro area real GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on 
quarter, in both the first and the 
second quarter of 2018. Looking ahead, 
the incoming information remains overall 
consistent with the Governing Council™s baseline scenario of an ongoing broad
-based 
economic expansion
. However,
 some recent sector
-specific 
developments are having 
an impact on the near
-term growth profile. The ECB™s monetary policy measures 
continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is fostered by ongoing 
employment growth and rising wages. Business investment is supported by s
olid 
domestic demand, favourable financing conditions and corporate profitability. Housing

 Summary
  3 investment remains robust. In addition, the expansion in global activity is expected to 
continue supporting euro area exports, though at a slower pace.
 Euro area ann
ual HICP inflation increased to 2.1% in September 2018, from 2.0% in 
August, reflecting mainly higher energy and food price inflation. On the basis of current 
futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the 
current
 level over the coming months. While measures of underlying inflation remain 
generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic cost 
pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation 
and tightening labo
ur markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick 
up towards the end of the year and to increase further over the medium term, 
supported by the ECB™s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion 
and rising wage growth.
 The mon
etary analysis shows that broad money (M3) growth stood at 3.5% in 
September 2018, after 3.4% in August. The growth of loans to the private sector has 
strengthened further, continuing the upward trend observed since the beginning of 
2014. The euro area ban
k lending survey for the third quarter of 2018 indicates that 
loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand across all loan 
categories and favourable bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and loans 
for house purchase.
 Combining the 
outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the 
monetary analysis, the Governing Council concluded that an ample degree of 
monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence 
of inflation to levels that are b
elow, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
 On the basis of this assessment, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB 
interest rates unchanged and continues to expect them to remain at their present 
levels at least through the summer of 2019, and
 in any case for as long as necessary 
to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but 
close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding non
-standard monetary policy 
measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the Euro
system will continue to 
make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the new monthly 
pace of •15 billion until the end of December 2018. The Governing Council anticipates 
that, subject to incoming data confirming its medium
-term inflation
 outlook, net 
purchases will then end. The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal 
payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period 
of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as
 necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of 
monetary accommodation.

 Global survey indicators of economic growth have weakened recently as the 
global economic cycle matures.
 The global composite outpu
t Purchasing 
Managers™ Index (PMI) excluding the euro area declined further below its long
-term 
average in September (see Chart 1), 
reaching
 a two
-year low. The decline was driven 
by both the manufacturing and 
the 
services components. In quarterly terms, t
he average 
PMI 
for
 the third quarter of 2018 
declined from its level in 
the previous quarter. 
The composite output PMI decreased across most advanced economies
, including 
the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. In emerging market economies, 
it increased in India but 
weakened
 in China, Russia and Brazil, the latter 
country index 
remaining below the expansionary threshold.

 Notes: The 
latest observations are for September 2018. ﬁLong
-term averageﬂ refers to the period from January 1999 to September 2018.
 Risks to the global economy remain to the downside, amid ongoing actions and 
threats regarding trade tariff increases by the United St
ates and possible 
retaliation by the affected countries.
 The US administration implemented tariffs 
targeting an additional USD 200 billion of Chinese imports
 with effect from 24 
September 2018
, and China retaliated with tariffs targeting an additional USD 
60 billion of exports from the United States. Given the size of these latest measures, 
uncertainty 
as to 
their impact has increased, in particular as regards business 
sentiment and capital spending plans. Policy uncertainty also remains high. While the 
Uni
ted States is weighing additional tariffs on Chinese exports and an expansion of 
protectionist measures 
in the 
automotive
 sector, a new trade agreement between the 
United States, Mexico
 and Canada
 (USMCA) signals an easing of trade tensions. 
Overall, the r
isks to global growth from rising pr
otectionism remain significant.
 Global financial conditions remain supportive for advanced economies, while 
creating headwinds for emerging market economies.
 Overall, monetary policy in 
advanced economies remains accommo
dative.

  5 the Federal Open Market Committee increased policy rates in September amid solid 
growth, rising inflation and a tight labour market. Following the decision, the 
yield on 
10-year 
US government bonds
 reached 
its
 highest level since 2011, while international 
equity markets
 fell sharply
. In China, financial conditions eased 
following
 action by the 
People™s Bank of China 
responding
 to a weakening outlook for 
economic 
activity 
amid
 rising trade tensions. More broadly
, however, financial conditions in emerging market 
economies remain tight and weigh on the outlook for economic activity. Overall, global 
risk sentiment has not fully recovered over the past
 few
 months, and financial 
investors seem to increasingly discrimi
nate against 
emerging market economie
s with 
significant imbalances, high external financing needs and 
limited room for policy 
support
. Moreover, additional rate increases in the United States and the stronger 
dollar could lead to a further tightening of fi
nancial conditions ac
ross emerging market 
economies.
 The global trade momentum has moderated, but the near
-term outlook remains 
steady.
 Following very weak 
figures in the second quarter of the year
, global 
merchandise imports 
further 
recovered in 
August
 on account of stronger imports by 
emerging market economies (see Chart 2). The global PMI for new export orders 
decreased to below expansionary territory in September
; however, the average for the 
third quarter of the year
 remained above the neutral threshol
d. Other trade indicators 
give
 mixed signals. Overall, recent data point to moderate but steady growth in trade in 
the third quarter.

 Note: The latest observations are for

 Global inflation was stable 
in August.
 Annual consumer price inflation in the 
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD) 
was
 unchanged at 2.9% in August, while inflation excluding food and energy stood at 
2.1%. Looking ahead, global inflationary pr
essures are expected to remain contained. 
While upward pressures from oil 
prices 
should diminish in the medium term, the 
gradual decline in spare 
economic 
capacity is expected to support underlying inflation.

  6 Oil markets have been mainly affected by 
factor
s related to the
 US sanctions 
against Iran
. Brent crude oil prices increased from 
a low of USD 70
 per barrel 
in the 
summer
 to USD 86 per barrel on 3 October
 as the prospect of the sanctions started to 
affect Iranian oil exports and OPEC decided not to furt
her increase production. The
 more recent
 retreat in oil prices 
to USD 76 per barrel on October 23
 was driven by the 
announcements 
by Saudi Arabia and Russia that they could increase output if 
needed, coupled with a global stock market sell
-off and weaker f
orecasts for oil 
demand growth. Non
-oil commodity prices have decreased by around 
2% since 
end-July. While food prices 
fell
 slightly, metal prices increased
, mainly on account of 
iron ore
 prices
. In the United States, the outlook for economic activity rema
ins solid.
 Real GDP 
expanded at an annualised rate of 4.2% in the second quarter of 2018
, following 2.2% 
in the previous quarter
. Th
is marked
 acceleration was due in part to strong exports. To 
the extent that these exports were front
-loaded in response to 
expected future tariffs, 
the support from trade is not expected to persist. In addition, the further escalation of 
trade tensions between the United States and China may increasingly affect business 
sentiment and 
thus
 investment spending. Nonetheless, the 
near-term outlook remains 
strong
, supported by solid 
macroeconomic 
fundamentals
, as well as a large 
procyclical fiscal expansion. Meanwhile, the labour market continued to generate jobs 
at a 
robust
 pace 
in September, 
and the unemployment rate declined furt
her to 3.7%, 
the lowest rate since December 1969. Annual headline consumer price index (CPI) 
inflation slowed to 2.3% in September, while excluding food and e
nergy, inflation 
remained at 2.2%.
 In Japan, economic activity was robust in the second quarter, b
ut extreme 
weather conditions have raised uncertainty regarding the outlook.
 Following a 
mild contraction in the first quarter of the year, economic activity rebounded in the 
second quarter, supported by strong investment activity. However, the outlook 
con
tinues to be surrounded by growing uncertainty. Following the heavy rains and 
floods in western Japan in July, the impact of Typhoon Jebi and the Hokkaido 
earthquake in September are likely to weigh on 
economic 
activity. Looking further 
ahead, the Japanese
 economy is expected to return to moderate growth, albeit at a 
gradually slowing pace, as declining spare capacity and diminishing fiscal support 
may limit growth prospects in spite of accommodative monetary policy. In addition, the 
political uncertainty r
egarding trade policies remains significant, especially as regards 
potential tariffs on Japan™s automotive sector. Labour market indicators, meanwhile, 
point to a further tightening, while upward momentum in prices and wages remains 
limited. Annual headlin
e CPI inflation stood at 1.2% in September, while CPI inflation 
excluding food and energy remained close to zero.
 In the United Kingdom, real GDP growth rebounded modestly in the second 
quarter.
 Real G
DP grew by 0.4% 
quarter on quarter 
in the second 
quarter, after first 
quarter growth was revised down to 0.1%. Household consumption slowed, while the 
investment and trade expenditure components were revised heavily
 downwards, 
revealing contractions in both for two consecutive quarters. The latest PMI su
rvey data 
suggest

a similar rate in the third quarter, though

  7 optimistic outlook. This is in line with an environment of moderating global gro
wth, 
growing trade tensions and the heightened uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the 
negotiations on the country™s withdrawal from membership of the European Union in 
March 2019. Having picked up slightly over the course of the summer, inflation fell 
back to 2.4% in September, from 2.7% in August. The volatility seen over the summer 
months was in large part expected, reflecting earlier developments in oil prices and a 
slight weakening in 
the pound
 around the end of the second quarter of the year.
 In Ch
ina, GDP growth moderated only slightly in the third quarter of 2018, amid 
additional policy support.
 Real GDP grew at 6.5% in year
-on-year terms in the third 
quarter of 2018, supported by strong consumption, government policy support and 
a solid export pe
rformance. However, in the near term a slowing housing market and the 
lagged effects of earlier financial tightening may weigh on growth. Also, new tariffs 
implemented by the US administration targeting an additional USD 200 billion of 
Chinese exports to t
he United States are expected to adversely impact 
economic 
activity. In order to mitigate the impact, the Chinese authorities have announced a 
broad set of non
-tariff measures to facilitate trade growth and foster domestic 
investment. In 
addition,
 Chinese 
policymakers are set to lower the average tariff rate 
on imports from 9.
8% in 2017
 to 7.5% as of 1 November.
 Headline CPI inflation 
increased slightly in September to 2.5%, but core inflation declined to 1.7%.

 Broad indices of euro area equity prices 
declined.
 Equity prices of both euro area 
financials and 
non-financial corporations (
NFCs
) decreased by around 
7% over the 
review period on the back of an increase in the discount rate 
and in risk premia in 
the 
light of tensions in euro area sovereign bond
 markets. However, expectations of 
robust corporate profits continued to be supportive of euro area equity prices. The 
equity prices of US NFCs and financial firms also declined over the review period, by 
6% and 
7.5% respectively. In 
view
 of 
the 
declines, 
market expectations of future equity 
price volatility increased in both the euro area and the United States, where they stood 
on an annualised basis at 
21.5
% and 2
1% respectively. These levels remain 
comparatively low from a historical perspective.
 Yield 
spreads on bonds issued by euro area NFCs remained relatively insulated 
from tensions in sovereign debt and equity markets.

-35 and 
-37 basis 
points over the period under review.
 Excess liquidity declined
 by around •
37 billion 
to about •1,8
67 billion. This decli
ne was driven by an increase in net autonomous 
factors, the maturity of the first series of targeted longer
-term refinancing operations 
(TLTRO
-I) and some early repayments of funds borrowed under th
e second series 
(TLTRO
-II). At the same time, ongoing purchases under the Eurosystem™s asset

 The EONIA forward curve shifted slightly upwards over the review period. 
Market participants r

quarter of 2008. Since the trough recorded in the second quarter of 2013, cumulative 
employment growth in the euro area amounts to 9.2
 million persons. The strong 
growth in 
employment seen during 
this period of
 economic expansion was 
accompanied by broadly unchanged average hours worked, which primarily reflects 
the impact of several structural factors (
e.g.

 Household income continue
d to support growth in private consumption.
 Private 
consumption rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2018, following 
more dynamic growth in the p
revious quarter
. This slowdown appears to reflect, on the 
one hand, adverse temporary factors (such as the impact of strikes on 
transport
-related spending in France) and, on the other hand, the unwinding of 
positive temporary factors in the first quarter (
higher energy consumption due to the 
cold winter). On an annual basis, consumption rose by 1.3% in the second quarter of 
2018, which represents a slowdown from the first quarter
, when consumption rose by 
1.6%. At the same time, annual growth of households™
 real disposable income 
increased from 1.7% in the first quarter to 1.9% in the second quarter. Thus, the 
slowdown in consumption growth was mirrored by a rise in the annual rate of change 
in savings 
Œ from 3.4% in the first quarter to 5.9% in the second q
uarter. 
The household saving ratio 
rose
 to 12.0% in 
the 
second quarter, slightly above the record 
low of 11.9% 
in the previous three quarters.
 Private consumption is expected to display resilient growth 
in the coming 
quarters
. Recent data on the volume of retail sales and new passenger car 
registrations point to ongoing growth in consumer spending in the third quarter of this 
year. However, it should be noted that the link between new passenger car 
registrations and car purchas
es, which feed into private consumption, is in all 
likelihood distorted at the current juncture
, as it appears that a large part of the 
registrations in August were carried out by manufacturers/dealers rather than 
consumers. Other indicators also support t
he picture of continued robust consumption 
dynamics. 
For instance, 
households™ net worth continued to increase at robust rates in 
the second quarter, thus lending further support to private consumption.

  12 latest survey results signal further la
bour market improvements, which should 
continue to support aggregate income and thus consumer spending. 
In addition, 
although consumer confidence has declined
 in the course of 2018
, it still stands at an 
elevated level
 and we
ll above its long
-term average.
 Following the weak first quarter of 2018, investment growth rebounded in the 
second quarter.
 The quarterly 1.4%
 rise 
in investment in the second quarter of this 
year was brought about by an increase in investment in machinery
, equipment 
and, to 
a lesser extent, intellectual property products (Box 2 provides an overview of 
developments in investment in intangible assets in the euro area). At the same time, 
quarterly growth in construction investment 
increased
 to 1.1%. 
By contrast
, 
investment i
n transport equipment declined strongly in the same quarter. 
For
 the third 
quarter of 2018, short
-term indicators point to continued growth. 
Monthly data on 
capital goods production in July and August stood
, on average
, 0.7% above the
ir second quarter 
aver
age, when they 
rose
 by 0.8% on a quarterly basis. On the other 
hand, indicators such as capacity utilisation
 (slightly declining but still high
), confidence and orders 
(both lower) 
point to some downward risks to the growth 
momentum in non
-construction inv
estment. With regard to construction investment, 
monthly construction production data 
up to
 August point to continued 
Œ but moderating 
Œ growth in the third quarter of 2018.
 Investment is expected to continue to grow solidly, supported by robust 
domestic d
emand and favourable financing conditions.
 According to the euro 
area sectoral accounts for the second quarter of 2018, business margins (measured 
as the ratio of net operating surplus to 
net 
value added) have remained broadly 
unchanged since the end of 20
15 and continue to be close to 
long
-term averages
. 
However, uncertainties surrounding the future implementation of tariff increases may 
already be 
proving 
detrimental to investment decisions. As regards construction 
investment, households™ 
increasing
 inten
tions to buy or renovate, as well as 
constructors™ buoyant price and employment expectations, point to positive 
momentum in the construction sector over the short
-term horizon. However, as 
financing conditions are expected to become slightly tighter, alter
native long
-term 
investment opportunities may gradually emerge.
 Euro area trade growth remained moderate at the beginning of the third quarter 
of 2018.
 Based on information up to August, e
uro area nominal goods
 exports 
increased by 1.1% quarter on quarter,
 slightly below
 the figures registered in the 
second quarter of 2018 (1.3% quarter on quarter).
 In contrast, e
xtra euro area goods 
exports rebounded in August (
an increase of 2.1%
, after a contraction of around 1.1%
 in July
), suggesting some acceleration c
ompared 
with the second quarter
 in 
quarter
-on-quarter
 terms
. Euro area nominal imports fell by 0.2%, month on month, in 
August
, after 
increasing by
 0.9% in July. 
Using information up to August, extra
-euro 
area imports increased by 2.8% in nominal terms in 
the third quarter, reflecting an 
acceleration compared with the second quarter of 2018 (2.2% quarter on quarter). 
Survey indicators with leading properties
, such as the

  13 the beginning of the year. 
Hard data such as new manufacturing orders outsi
de the 
euro area 
rebounded in August after 
some deterioration in June and July
. Overall, the latest economic indicators
 suggest ongoing 
broad
Œbased 
growth.
 Industrial production (excluding construction) rebounded and 
recorded
 a relatively 
strong increase i
n August, following the sharp declines 
of the previous 
two 
months. 
Still, on average
, production in July and August stood 0.2% below the level seen in the 
second quarter of 2018, when it rose by 0.1% on a quarterly basis. This weakness 
partly relates to te
mporary bottlenecks in the production of cars triggered by the 
testing process following the introduction of the World
wide
 Harmonised 
Light Vehicle 
Test Procedure (WLTP) on 1 September. More timely survey data signal ongoing 
robust growth at rates 
similar 
to, or somewhat lower than, those recorded
 in the first 
half of 
the year
. The composite output PMI averaged 54.3 in the third quarter, 
compared with 54.7 in the second quarter, before declining in October to 5
2.7
. 
Meanwhile, the European Commission™s Econo
mic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) eased to 
112.5 in the third quarter
, from 114.0 in the second quarter (see Chart
 5). Both the 
PMI
 and the 
ESI continue to stand above their respective long
-term averages.
 The economic expansion is 
supported by domestic demand 
and continued 
improvements in the labour market.
 However, some 
recent sector
-specific 
developments are having an impact on the near
-term growth profile. The ECB™s 
monetary policy measures continue to underpin domestic demand. Private 
consumption is fostere
d by ongoing employment growth and rising wages. At the 
same time, business investment is supported by solid domestic demand, favourable 
financing conditions and corporate profitability. Housing investment remains robust. In 
addition, the expansion in glob
al activity is expected to continue supporting euro area 
exports, 
although at a slower pace.
 The results of the latest round of the
 ECB Survey 
of Professional Forecaste
rs, conducted in early October, show that private sector GDP 
growth forecasts were revised downwards for 2018 and 2019 compared with the 
previous round conducted in early July. The figure for 2020 remained unchanged.
 The risks surrounding the euro area gro
wth outlook 
are 
assessed as broadly 
balanced
. At the same time, risks relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging 
markets and financial market volatility remain prominent.

 Euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in September,
 up from 2.0% in August 
(see Chart
 7).
 This increase reflected slightly higher contributions from food and 
energy price inflation, while the contributions of services and non
-energy industrial 
goods price inflation were unchanged. Energy prices made a larg
e contribution to 
headline inflation over recent months. The contribution varies significantly across euro 
area countries, due partly to differences in the degree of pass

consumer energy prices (see the box entitled ﬁThe role of en

.2 This was the highest outturn since late 2012, 
marking a continuation in the pick
-up from the low of around 0.0% on average in 2016. 
Such resilie
nce to downward pressure from the strong appreciation 
of the 
euro in 2017 
may reflect the offsetting impact of strengthening domestic cost pressures. Price 
pressures remained strong in earlier stages of the supply chain; producer price 
inflation for interm
ediate goods 
was
 3.2% in August, the same rate as in July.
 Wage growth developments point to increasing domestic cost pressures.
 All the 
main sectors and most euro area countries contributed to the increase in annual 
growth in compensation per employee ove
r recent quarters. This broad
-based 
rise in
 wage growth, together with information on negotiated wage agreements covering the 
next one to two years, supports the expectation of a further pick
-up. Overall, recent 
developments in wage growth have followed th
e direction of improving labour market 
conditions, as other factors that have weighed on wage growth 
Œ including past low 
inflation and the impact of labour market reforms implemented in some countries 
during the crisis 
Œ continue to fade.
 Both market and 
survey

have remained stable (see Chart
 8).
 On 
24 October 
the five
-year inflation
-linked 
swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.67%. The forward profile of market
-based 
measures of inflation expectations c
ontinues to point to a gradual return of inflation to 
levels below, but close to, 2%. The risk
-neutral probability of deflation over the next 
five years implied by inflation options markets remains negligible. The results of the 
ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the fourth quarter of 2018
 show 
average 
headline 
inflation expectations 
of 
1.7% for each of 2018, 2019 and 2020.
 This 
is unchanged from the profile in the previous survey
. According to the SPF, average

 Broad money growth 
remained broadly stable
 in 
September
. The annual growth 
rate of M3 
interrupted the decline from its last peak (5.2%) in 
September
 2017, 
increasing
 to 3.5%
 in September
 from 
3.4% in 
August
 (see Chart
 9) owing to a
 significant inflow into overnight deposits
. Moreover, the reduction in net asset 
purchases (from •80
 billion to •60
 billion in April
 2017, and then to •30
 billion 
in 
January
 2018) 
has meant that the asset purchase programme (APP) is having 
a smaller positive impact on M3 growth. The annual growth rate of M1, which includes 
the most liquid components of M3, again made a significant contribution to broad 
money growth 
and increased
 to 6.
8% in 
September
 (up from 6.
4% in 
August
). Money 
growth continued to 
be bolstered by
 sustained economic 
expansion
 and the low 
opportunity cost of holding the most liquid instruments in an environment of very low 
interest rates.

s: Credit to the private sector includes monetary financial institution (MFI) loans to the private sector a

As such, it also covers the Eurosystem™s purchases of non
-MFI debt securities under the 
corporate sector purchase programme.
 The latest observation is for 
September
 2018. Domesti
c sources of money creation remained the main driver of broad money 
growth.
 From a counterpart perspective, 
there was a further decline in 
the positive 
contribution to M3 growth from general government securities held by the Eurosystem
 (see the red parts o
f the bars in Chart
 9), in the context of the aforementioned 
reduction in monthly net purchases under the APP. The dec
reasing
 contribution to M3 
growth from the Eurosystem™s asset purchases 
has been
 offset by a moderate 
increase in the contribution from cr
edit to the private sector since late 2017 (see the 
blue 
parts of
 the bars in Chart
 9). By contrast, government bond sales 
by euro area 
MFIs excluding the Eurosystem dampened M3 growth (see the light green 
parts
 of the 
bars in Chart

ve contribution from

 moderated

  18 The g
rowth of loans to the private sector 
strengthened further, continuing t
he 
upward trend
 observed since the beginning of 2014.
 The annual growth rate of 
MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional 
cash pooling) 
was stable 
in 
September
 at 3.4% (see Chart
 10). 
It
 benefitted from an 
increase
 in the annual growth rate of 
loans to non
-financial corporations (NFCs), 
which 
reached
 4.3% in September
, 
up from 4.
1% in 
August
. 
At the same time
, the 
annual growth rate of loans to households 
remained stable at
 3.1%. While the annual 
growth rate
 of loans to households for house purchase remained moderate from a 
historical perspective, 
loan origination was strong
. The recovery in loan growth has 
been supported by the significant decline in bank lending rates across the euro area 
since mid
-2014 (no
tably owing to the ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy measures) 
and by 
overall improvements in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans. In addition, 
banks have made progress in consolidating their balance sheets, although the 
volume
 of non
-performing loa
ns (NPLs) remains high in some countries and may cons
train

 Loans to the private sector
 (annual growth rate)
  Source: ECB.
 Notes: Loans are adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling. The latest ob
servation is for 
September
 2018. Loan growth continued to be supported by easing credit standards and 
increasing demand in the 
third
 quarter of 2018.
 According to
 the
 October
 2018 euro area bank lending survey
, 
the net easing of credit standards was driven mainly by 
competitive pressure and 
lower
 risk perceptions. Banks also reported incr
easing net 
loan demand across all loan categories
, which is largely due to
 the low general level of 
interest rates,
 fixed investment,
 inventories and working capital, merger and 
acquisition 
(M&A) 
activity, favourable housing market prospects and consumer 
confidence. 
With regard to the APP,
 banks 
stated
 that 
it had improve
d their liquidity 
position and market financing conditions, 
but that
 it 
had negative
ly affected
 their 
profitability owing to 
the
 squeez
e on net interest rate margins. 
The APP
 had an easing 
impact on credit terms and conditions across all loan categories.
 Moreover, it had a 
positive impact on banks™ lending volumes, but less than in the previous reporting

 Furthermore, the ECB™s negative deposit facility rate was said to be having a 
positive effect on lending volumes, while weighing on banks™ net interest income.
 Very favourable lending rates continued to support euro area economic growth.
 In August
 2018 the composite bank lending rate for loans to NFCs remained broadly 
stable at 1.65%,
 which 
is very close to its historical low 
seen 
in May
 of this year
. 
The composite bank lending rate for housing loans remained stable 
in August
 at 1.
81%, 
which 
is also close to its historical low 
from
 December 2016 (see Chart
 11). Composite 
bank lending r
ates for loans to NFCs and households have 
fallen
 significantly and by 
more than market reference rates since the ECB™s credit easing measures were 
announced in June
 2014. The reduction in bank lending rates on loans to NFCs, as 
well as on loans to small f
irms (assuming that very small loans of up to •0.25
 million 
are granted mainly to small firms), was particularly significant in those euro area 
countries that were most exposed to the financial crisis. This indicates a more uniform 
transmission of monetary
 policy to bank lending rates across euro area countries and 
firm sizes.

 Net issuance of debt securities by euro area NFCs declined in the first two 
months of the third quarter 
of 2018 
compared 
with
 the 
equivalent
 months in the

 The latest ECB data indicate that, on a net basis, the total flow of

 2018 remained marginally positive 
and in line with the typical seasonal patterns 
observed
 over the last 
few years. From a 
more medium

 perspective (
see C

continued to decline from the peaks

suggest 
there was

in the amount of
 debt securiti
es issued 
over the period 
from 
September 
to
 October
 2018. Total net issuance of 
quoted

purchase programme
 Prepared by

 This box analyses the impact of the Eurosystem™s asset purchase programme 
(APP) on the growing market 
for 
green bonds
4. It describes the composition of the 
Eurosystem™s green bond holdings and 
assesses developments in prices and 
outstanding volumes of gree
n bonds, before 
discuss
ing
 the 
extent 
to which these may 
have been 
affected by the 
APP.
 The
 APP 
aim
s to support a sustained adjustment in the p
ath of inflation that is 
consistent with the ECB™s 
primary objective of price stability, defined as an 
inflation 
rate below
, but close to
, 2% over the medium 
term
. Eligibility criteria for 
the APP are deliberately broad 
in order to provide 
a large 
range 
of 
purchasable 
securities. This supports the effectiveness of the programme and avoids distortions of 
specific mark
et segments. T
he implementation of the APP is 
guided
 by th
e principle of 
market neutrality
 and do
es not positively or negatively discriminate on the basis of 
environmental or 
any other 
criteria
. In the specific
 case of the 
corporate 
sector 
purchase 
programme (CSPP)
, which aims to
 further strength
en the pass
-through 
of 
the benefits of the asset purchases 
to financing conditions 
in 
the real economy
, the 
purchases of 
securities issued by non
-bank corporations 
reflect
 proportionally the 
market value of 
all eligible bonds
 in 
terms of sectors of economic activity 
and rating 
groups
. Despite the absence of an 
explicit 
environmental target in the APP
, ECB has 
purchased green bonds under both the CSPP and the 
public 
sector 
purchase 
programme (PSPP)
. The
se purcha
ses 
have contributed to the establishment of
 a well
-diversified
 portfolio.
 The term ﬁgreen bondﬂ refers to debt securities whose proceeds are used to 
finance investment projects with an environmental benefit.
 There are different 
approaches to defin
ing
 and certify
ing
 green bonds
, and no global market standard has 
emerged so far
.5 While many green bonds are self
-labelled, some jurisdictions h
ave 
developed their own certification framework and others rely on 
various different
 guidelines
.6 As well as reduc
ing transparency for investors, it is believed that the
 lack
 of standardised definitions
 and
 reporting requirements and the 
varying 
granularity of 
                                                                    4  In this box, ﬁgreen bondsﬂ are defined 
on the basis of 
the Bloomberg classification of the bonds™ use of 
proceeds, where proceeds are exclusively applied 
to 
new and existing 
green 
projects, defined as projects 
and activities that promote climate or other environmental sustainability purposes.

 The market for green bonds has developed rapidly in recent years
, 
with global 
issuance rising from less than 
•1 billion in 2008 to more than 
•120 billion in 
2017 (see 
Chart 
A, panel
 b). Euro
-denominated net green bond issuance has increased ten
-fold 
since 2013 (
see 
Chart 
A, panel
 a). During 
the period 
2013-2018, total net 
euro
-denominated green investment grade issuance in the euro area represented 
around 24% of global net green issuance. 
However
, despite the recent growth, in the 
same period green bonds 
still 
accounted for only 1% of the overall bond s
upply 
denominated in euro. Green bonds 
are not unlike other bonds in that they 
tend to 
price 
tig
hter than 
the 
initial price guidance
 and tend to be 
oversubscribed. They generally 
offer similar yields 
to comparable 
conventional bonds, but there is evidence 
that in 
some market segments issuers 
can 
borrow at lower rates than via conventional 
bonds, which is consistent with the interpretation that investors are 
prepared 
to forgo 
some 
income as a result of their self
-imposed 
investment constraints

 Since the CSPP announcement
 on 10 March 2016
, 
green 
corporate 
bond 
spreads have steadily 
declined, 
and 
a significant part of th
is effect can be 
attributed 
to the
 Eurosystem™s purchases
. In the industrial sector
, the evolution of 
the average corporate bond spread 
for 
CSPP
-eligible green bonds mirrors that 
for 
other 
CSPP
-eligible bonds (
see Chart C
). 
The 
change in spreads 
for 
eligible green 
bonds in the period after the 
CSPP 
announcement (
from 
10 March 2016 to the end of 
December 2017) 
was compared 
with that 
in the period 
prior to 
the announcement 
(1 
April 2015 to 9 March 20
16), controlling for other determinants that may 
affect 
corporate bond spread
s, such as bond
-specific credit risk.
 The 
CSPP accounted for a

 decline in spreads 
for 
eligible 
green 
bonds o
f 25 basis points
, which was 
almost the entire 
drop
 recorded a
fter
 the announcement of the program
me. Since the 
end of 2016, in conjunction with the simultaneous rapid growth in bond supply and the 
increase in green bond spreads globally, the gap between spreads of green bonds and 
those of the overall industrial se
ctor 
have 
gradually closed, 
and the yields of green and 
conventional bonds

 2016 and has been rising 
ever 
since.
 The ratio of the amount 
outstanding of green bonds to the total amount outstand

are consistent

 findings 
on the impact of the CSPP on
 overall bond issuance by non

.12 The
se findings
 are corroborated

 The geography of the euro area current account balance
  28 2 The geography of the euro area current account balance
 Prepared by Michael Fidora and Martin Schmitz
 The composition of the euro area current account balance in terms of its 
geographical counterparts has been 
fairly stable in recent years, with the euro 
area™s most important trading partners accounting for the largest part of the 
bilateral surpluses and deficits (see Chart A).
 Newly available data on the 
geographical breakdown of the euro area current account b
alance reveal that the 
largest share of the euro area™s external surplus of 3.5% of GDP in the year to the end 
of the second quarter of 2018 was accounted for by the United Kingdom and the 
United States, which contributed 1.4% and 1.0% of euro area GDP, re
spectively, 
followed by Switzerland (0.4% of euro area GDP). China, on the other hand, 
contributed negatively (about 
-0.6% of euro area GDP) to the current account balance 
of the euro area. At the same time, the impact of all other major trading partners f
or 
which a geographical breakdown is available was relatively limited, while a residual 
group of countries 
Œ including major oil producers 
Œ also contributed positively to the 
euro area™s external surplus (about 1.3% of euro area GDP).

 The bulk of the increase in the euro area™s current account surplus of about 1.2 
percentage points of GDP since 2013 was accounted for by improvements 
vis
-à-vis the euro area™s three largest trading partners (see Chart B).
 Over
 this 
period, the euro area™s current account surpluses vis

United Kingdom increased by 0.7 and 0.5 percentage point of euro area GDP, while

 The largest changes in the geographical breakdown of the euro area current 
account balances since 2013 were recorded for trade in goods and primary 
income (see Chart B).
 Improvements in the 
bilateral current account balances mostly 
reflected increases in balances of trade in goods and primary income balances, in 
particular in the cases of the United Kingdom and the United States. At the same time, 
decreases in the current account balances wer
e mostly due to a deterioration in 
bilateral primary income balances,
13 in particular vis
-à-vis Switzerland, Japan and the 
residual group of countries.
 Moreover, the euro area recorded an improvement in its 
secondary income balance
14 vis-à-vis the rest of the EU (excluding the United 
Kingdom) owing to a decline in contributions to the EU budget.
 Improvements in the balance of the euro area™s bilateral trade in goods since 
2013 were largely export
-driven in an environment of buoyant gl
obal demand, 
while imports also picked up overall (see Chart C).
 The largest increase in net 
exports was recorded vis
-à-vis the United States. This was due to a strong increase in 
exports to the United States, which exceeded a modest increase in imports in
to the 
euro area, reflecting stronger domestic demand in the United States and the 
appreciation of the US dollar against the euro. At the same time, net exports also 
increased significantly vis
-à-vis Russia as the result of a strong reduction in trade 
                                                                    13  Primary income represents the return that accrues to resident institutional units 
on 
their contribution to 
the production process or for the provision of financial assets and renting natural resources to 
non
-resident institutional units (e.g. compensation of employees, dividends and interest).
 14  Secondary income pertains to those current transfers between residents and non
-residents that directly 
affect the level of gross national disposable income and th
us influence the economy™s ability to consume 
goods and services (
such as 
international cooperation and workers™ remittances).

es, 
including
 a significant decline in euro area imports in the light of the 
depreciation of the Russian rouble and falling commodity prices. For the other trading 
partners, changes in net exports were less significant. In particular, net exports to 
other 
EU countries and China changed only marginally, reflecting a relatively 
balanced, robust expansion of trade with those trading partners. The strong expansion 
of bilateral trade with other EU countries was driven by the economic recovery in the 
EU and, in p
articular, the resurgence of value chains since the trade collapse triggered 
by the global financial crisis. At the same time, net goods exports to the United 
Kingdom and Switzerland increased slightly, partly on account of a decline in imports 
from those 
countries. The euro area recorded a slight worsening of net exports 
vis
-à-vis the residual group of other countries, reflecting an overall reduction in export 
and import values, the latter mostly related to the observed decline in commodity 
prices.

 Notes: The inverse of the change in imports of goods is shown on the chart, so a negative value d
enotes an increase and a positive value 
a decrease. ﬁOther EUﬂ comprises EU Member States and EU institutions outside the euro area, excluding the United Kingdom.
 Developments in bilateral primary income balances since 2013 were largely 
driven by income on
 foreign direct investment (FDI) 
Œ which evolved rather 
heterogeneously across geographical counterparts 
Œ and income on portfolio 
debt investment (see Chart D).
 The euro area™s FDI income balance is largely 
shaped by the operations of multinational enterp
rises (MNEs) resident inside and 
outside the euro area. In particular, MNEs™ investment decisions and profitability 
determine the evolution of FDI income. The largest improvement in the euro area™s 
FDI income balance was recorded vis
-à-vis the United State
s, followed by the United 
Kingdom. This mainly reflected a larger increase in FDI positions of euro area 
residents in the United States and the United Kingdom than in FDI positions of United 
States and United Kingdom residents in the euro area. Conversely,
 the euro area™s 
FDI income balance declined most significantly vis
-à-vis Switzerland, Japan and the 
residual group of countries. For the 
first 
two, this is in line with a relative increase in

 Investment in intangible assets in the euro area
  32 3 Inve
stment in intangible assets in the euro area
 Prepared 
by Malin Andersson and Lorena Saiz
 Investment in intangible assets 
enables productivity gains.
 Intangible assets
16 are non
-monetary assets without physical 
or financial 
substance
. They encompass a 
broad 
range of highly heterogeneous assets, including
 human capital, innovative 
products, brands, patents, software, consumer relationships,
 databases 
and distribution systems.
 Some of t
hese assets 
enable firms to 
obtain productivity gains 
and efficiencies from 
new technologies and
, as such, 
play
 a strategic 
role
 in a firm™s 
value creation.
 This box reviews the characteristics of intangibles and looks at a 
number of implications of their increasing importance.
 Investment in intangible assets 
has increased in impo
rtance
 in the euro area
, 
both in absolute terms and relative to tangible assets, 
with
 several 
factors 
contributing to that development.
 In euro area countries and other advanced 
economies
, investment in intangib
les 
has grown strongly
 in recent decades. Ove
r the 
last 20 years, growth in i
ntellectual property products
 Œ a group of intangible assets
 included 
in the national accounts
17 Œ has outpaced growth in
 tangible investment
 in 
the euro area (see
 Chart A
). Investment in those products has 
also
 made a signif
icant
 contribut
ion 
to
 annual 
growth in 
euro area 
non-construction investment over the 
last 
two decades
 (see Chart B)
. 
The fact that the
 growth 
rate of
 intangibles 
is higher than 
that of
 tangibles 
is being 
driven by factors such as 
the increase in
 global co
mpetition
, the 
sectoral 
shift from industry to services, the expansion of the digital economy, 
changing 
international
 specialisations in 
the area of 
production
, 
new business models
 (e.g. for tax optimisation purposes) 
and general technological 
advances
.                                                                     16 More specifically, intangibles comprise investment relat
ing
 to 
(i) comput
ing
 and computerised infor
mation 
(such as software and databases)
, (ii) innovative propert
ies and
 company competencies (such as 
scientific and non
-scientific R&D, copyrights, designs
 and
 trademarks)
, and 
(iii) economic competencies 
(including brand equity, firm
-specific human capit
al, networks 
linking
 people and institutions
 together
, organisational know
-how that increases efficiency, and aspects of advertising and marketing). The
se are 
sometimes referred to as 
ﬁintellectual assets
ﬂ, ﬁknowledge assets
ﬂ or 
ﬁintellectual capital
ﬂ. 17 In 2014 the current methodological standards 
for national accounts, SNA
 2008 and ESA
 2010, 
began 
regarding
 spending on
 purchased and own
-account R
&D as investment. As a result, intangible 
investment 
now 
includes 
spending on
 ICT equipment and 
intellectual 
property products. ESA
 2010
 defines
 intellectual property products
 as knowledge derived from
 R&D
, investigation
s or innovation which 
is restricted by law or other means of protection
 in terms of its use
. Intangible assets such as human 
capital, consumer re
lationships and distribution systems are 
not covered by
 the national accounts.

,18 with 
their scalability or 
non-rival nature, for instance, meaning
 that the
 benefits 
they 
provide to individual users are not dependent on the total number of 
users
. At the same time
, some 
intangibles have little market value and the cost of 
producing them is almost entirely a sunk cost, which makes them hard to 
trade,
19 more 
likely 
to be 
firm
-specific
, and associated with 
particularly 
high risk
s for firms 
undertaking such investment. Finally, they are productivity
-enhancing
, they are often 
more 
efficient 
when 
combined
 with other assets (e.g. training which helps workers to 
use software and compu
ters more efficiently), and
 they tend to 
generate positive 
spillovers and 
benefits for people 
other than those developing them
 (i.e. they are 
non-excludable)
. 
Such
 characteristics
 make them 
less 
easy to use as 
collateral
 and may therefore mean that they ar
e more reliant on internal financing (i.e. savings)
 than 
physical capital
.20 Overall, those features 
could lead 
firms to 
underinvest in 
such
 assets
.21 Analysis based on microdata for listed companies shows that intangible assets 
can explain part of the gap b
etween firms™ investment in tangible assets and 
Tobin™s Q.
22 Since the financial crisis, euro area firms™ investment in tangible assets 
has been weaker than one would expect on the basis of Tobin™s Q (see Chart
 C, panel 
a). 
This may indicate either 
underinvestment or overvaluation 
in equity markets.
 Two 
recent publications have shown that 
intangible assets
 are able to explain some of that 
gap in the United States.
23 Regression analysis conducted for the euro area shows 
that including intangible assets 
that are not capitalised (i.e. not included in the balance 
sheet as asset
s) in both investment and Tobin™s Q
24 reduces the size of the gap 
between the two (see Chart C, panel b). The sensitivity of investment to Tobin™s Q also 
increases, albeit in all cases
 Tobin™s Q explains only one
-third of total variation in 
investment.
                                                                     18 For more details, s

 19 In some cases, the value of an intangibl
e asset cannot be determined before it has generated value (i.e. 
there is 
low ex
 ante verifiability).

. 21 On the other hand, the 
potential to
 generat
e economies of scale that enhance market power provides 
incentives to invest in intangibles.
 22 Tobin
™s Q is the ratio 
of the
 market value 
of a firm™s assets 
to their
 replacement value. If Tobin
™s Q is 
greater than 1.0, this may suggest that the market value reflects some unmeasured or unrecorded assets 
held by
 the 
firm
. High 
values for 
Tobin
™s Q may encourage 
firms
 to invest more in capital 
assets 
because 
thei
r value exceeds the price they paid for them, and 
the opposite is true
 whe
re Tobin™s 
Q is lower than 
1.0.

 Note
s: Investment in tangible assets is defined as expenditure 
on property, plant and equip
ment over tangible fixed assets in the 
previous period. Tobin™s Q is defined as the firm™s market value plus total debt at book value minus cash and short
-term investments over 
total assets a
t book value. Investment in intangible assets is defined as R&D c
osts plus 30% of sales, general and administrative 
expenses. In the lower panel, investment in tangible and intangible assets and Tobin™s Q both have as a denominator tangible 
fixed 
assets at book value plus capitalised R&D costs and 30% of sales, general 
and administrative expenses, using the perpetual inventory 
method and the depreciation rates that were used by Peters and Taylor
25. The specific 
nature of
 intangible 
assets 
poses challenges as regards the 
measurement of 
activity,
 profits and
 capital stock, 
as well as
 the
 distribution
 of 
productivity across firms.
26 Measurement issues 
relating to activity stem from the 
fact that such assets
 are
 generally regarded as 
firm
-specific 
intermediate 
consumption 
rather than 
investment in firms™ balance sheets
, and they 
remain
 underreported in the 
national 
accounts
 to some extent.
27 Although 
the 
percentage
 of intangible 
assets that 
are r
eported in firms™ annual acco
unts
 is gradually i
ncreasing, particularly in the 
service sector 
(see Chart D), the underreporting 
of 
intangible assets
 could mean that 
real output is also being underreported. Moreover, t
he classification of intangibles as 
                                                                    25 ibid.

As regards measurement of capital stock
, 
whi
le estimates of depreciation rates 
are associated with considerable uncertainty, 
the increasing share of intangible assets
 presumably 
implies 
higher 
overall 
depreciation rates
. 
As a result, the amount of 
investment 
that is 
required to offset the consumptio
n of capital and 
keep
 the capital

is rising
. At the same time, it is possible that the
 capital stock 
remains underestimated owing to insufficient incorporation of intangible investment in 
the national accounts
 (see also 
the 
sectio
n on capital in the article on 
potential growth 
in the post

), which is particularly

  37 4 Digitalisation and its impact on the economy: insights
 from 
a survey of large companies
 Prepared by 
Catherine Elding and Richard Morris
 This box summarises the 
findings 
of an a
d hoc 
ECB 
survey of leading euro area 
companies
 looking at the impact that digitalisation has on the economy
.28 Digitalisation may be viewed as a technology/supply shock which affects the main 
economic aggregates, notably via competition, productivity and e
mployment effects, 
as well as through its interaction with institutions and governance. 
Digital t
echnologies 
are also 
changing the way
s in which
 firms do business and interact with their 
customers and suppliers
. Understanding 
digital transformation and the
 channels 
through which it i
nfluence
s the economy is therefore 
increasingly relevant for the 
conduct of monetary policy
. The main aim of the survey was to look at how digital transformation is 
affecting macroeconomic aggregates, as perceived by firms.
 The questionnaire 
asked companies about their take
-up of digital technologies and the main obstacles to 
the adoption of 
such
 technologies. It then asked about the 
various
 channels through 
which they saw digital transformation affecting their sales, prices
, productivity and 
employment, as well as the expected overall direction and magnitude of the impact 
over the next three years. Responses were received from 74 leading non
-financial 
companies, split equally between producers of goods and providers of servi
ces. 
Those companies were generally very large, accounting for a combined total of 
around 3.7% of output and 1.7% of employment in the euro area.
 The
 take
-up of digital technologies at those companies is very high, with big 
data and cloud computing being t
he most widely adopted (see Chart A).
 The 
take
-up of big data and cloud computing is pervasive 
across all sectors, as is the use 
of e
-commerce, which is crucial in business
-to
-consumer segments. In the 
manufacturing and energy sectors, artificial intellige
nce, the ﬁinternet of thingsﬂ, 
robotics and 3D printing are almost equally widespread, with respondents tending to 
report that the real impact comes when these technologies are combined. The main 
obstacles to the adoption of digital technologies are the di
fficulty of adjusting the 
organisation of the company and the need to recruit and retain highly skilled ICT staff. 
Regulation and legislation were not typically seen as a major obstacle, although some 
firms noted that, while not a hindrance, regulatory fra
meworks did need to evolve.
                                                                     28 This survey

technologies?ﬂ
 Overall, the vast majority of respondents see digitalisation as having a positive 
impact on their company™s sales (see
 Chart B).
 More than half expect the adoption 
of digital technologies to give rise to a ﬁslight increa
seﬂ in sales over the next three 
years, while around one
-third expect a ﬁsignificant increaseﬂ. 
To some extent, this 
positive view may reflect the relativ
e size and strength of the companies 
surveyed, as 
their high take
-up rate for digital technologies was in some cases seen as enabling 
them to gain market share.

--) to ﬁsignif

 Better access to customers is the main channel through which digitalisation 
supports sales growth.
 In particular, respondents stressed the role that digital 
technologies play in providing access to
 customer data
, which helps
 firms to 
understand their customers™ needs (
termed ﬁ
customer intimacy
ﬂ) and offer new or 
improved services and tailored solutions with higher 
levels of 
quality. This
, in turn
, supports improvements in the quality of existing products (in addition to purely 
technolo
gy-driven improvements). 
Easier access to markets is also widely viewed as 
important.
 Respondents also see digitalisation increasing their flexibility when it comes to 
price setting (see Chart C)
. Around half of the respondents said that the adoption of 
digital technologies had increased their company™s ability to adjust prices in relation to 
those of their competitors, over time and/or across markets. In particular, r

service providers (especially retailers) were more inclined to see the adoption of digital 
technologies by others as putting downward pressure on their sales prices.
 Respondents see digitalisation increasing 
productivity, driven by the ease of 
sharing knowledge and more efficient production processes (see Chart D).
 Virtually all respondents 
regarded
 the easier sharing of knowledge 
(especially 
within 
the company
) as being an important channel through which digi
talisation raises 
productivity, with around half considering 
that aspect
 to be 
very important. The role 
that
 digitalisation 
plays 
in making the production process more efficient via automation 
is almost equally
 as important. 
Many respondents emphasised tha
t

 amount of data and information 
that they 
collected
, both
 inside and outside of the 
organisation
, was helping them
 to satisfy 
their 
customers

. 
The overall effect on 
productivity was perceived to be overwhelmingly positive, with 
a stronger effect 
typically being reported in service sectors, particularly in business

 44 5 The role of energy prices in recent inflation outcomes: a
 cross
-country perspective
 Prepared by 
Ieva Rubene
 Euro area headline inflation is currently dominated by a strong contribution 
from energy prices.
 In the third quarter of 2018, energy prices contributed 0.9 
percentage point to the headline HICP inflation rate of around 2.0%, thus accounting 
for almost half. This large contribution mainly reflects past developments in crude oil 
prices, a factor that constitutes a common influence across euro area countries. 

However, the contribution of energy to HICP inflation depends both on the share of 
energy in consumption 
expenditure 
and on the degree of pass
-through of oil price 
developments to consumer energy prices. This box reviews the extent to which these 
features can help explain differences across euro area countries in the re
cent 

contribution of energy to overall HICP inflation.
30 The contribution of energy to HICP inflation currently differs significantly 

across euro area countries.
 For 
most large countries, in the third quarter of 2018 
the 
share of HICP inflation accounted for by the energy contribution was fairly close to the 
euro area average, i.e. up to half (see Chart A). However, for some smaller countries, 
this share ranged from very small (energy accounting for almost nothing in Malta) to 

very high (energy accounting for almost all of HICP inflation in Ireland). It should be 
noted that this cross
-country comparison is only indicative of the relative importance of 
energy, as headline HICP is also determined by developments in HICP 
inflation 
excluding energy.

 A Ener
gy inflation in HICP inflation in the third quarter of 2018
 (percentage point contributions; annual percentage changes in HICP)
  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 Note: ﬁOther energyﬂ includes liquid and solid fuels and heat energy.
 The weight of energy in the HICP differs across countries, but cannot 
fully 
explain current differences in contributions to headline inflation.
 Current 
contributions of energy prices to headline inflation are generally above what would 
be 
implied by the en
ergy weight in 
the 
HICP. These weights range from around 6% in 
Malta to almost 15% in Slovakia, while 
for 
the euro area as a whole 
the weight of 
energy in HICP is 
10% (see Chart B). 
On balance
, transport fuels account for roughly 
half of the energy weight
 (more than any other 
energy 
item)
, and fuel prices typically 
follow changes in crude oil prices in euro more closely than other energy components. 
This explains why, in all countries, fuel prices
 have historically been the main 
determinant of energy infla
tion dynamics.
32 At the same time, 
the 
differences in fuel 
price inflation across countries in the third quarter of 2018 
were 
larger than can be 
accounted for by 
the 
differences in weights. This suggests that other factors are also at 
work in determining th
e pass
-through.
                                                                     32  Over the period
 since 1999, the average (unweighted) contemporaneous correlation across euro area 
countries between annual rates of change in total energy and fuel prices has been 0.9, while for gas 
prices (at 0.5) and electricity prices (
at 
0.1) it has been significantl
y smaller.

 Note: ﬁOther energyﬂ includes liquid and solid fuels and heat energy. The relatively large weight of transport fuels 
in Luxembourg 
also 
reflects purchases by consumers who 
are not resident 
in Luxembourg
. The pass
-through of oil prices to fuel prices is not one
-to-one, as the final 
consumer price also depends on tax
es and the behaviour of margins.
 Changes 
in taxes
 (in parti
cular excise taxes)
 usually have a noticeable impact on fuel prices
,33 and the level of taxes 
affects 
the pass
-through
 of oil price changes
. 
The larger the 
share of excise taxes
 Œ a fixed amount per litre 
Œ is in a country™s fuel price, the s
maller 
the perc
entage change in fuel prices is for a given change in oil prices.
 By contrast, 
although differences in 
rates of 
value added tax 
(VAT) can partly explain differences in 
the level of the consumer price of fuel
, owing 
to the proportional nature of 
VAT,
 different
 VAT 
rates across countries cannot explain differences in the pass
-through of 
changes in oil prices to fuel prices
. In the case of petrol prices, the 
total 
tax share 
varies 
across countries from around 50% in Luxembourg, Malta and Spain to just 
above 60% in the Netherlands, Italy and Greece, thus partly helping to explain 
differences in the final level of the fuel price and the pass
-through of crude oil price 
changes to fuel prices (see Chart C). Costs and margins arising in the refining and 
distri
bution processes 
usually 
constitute a relatively small part of fuel prices (just 
above 10%). Over longer horizons it is unlikely that, for instance due to differences in 
technology or buffering practices, such costs and margins could account for major 
diff
erences across countries in the pass
-through of crude oil prices to fuel prices. 
However, over shorter horizons, for instance if margins were to react to seasonal 
boosts in demand, such differences might become relevant.
                                                                     33  For example, increases in excise taxes contributed to higher annual fuel price inflation in Estonia and 
Latvia in the third quarter of 2018
. Changes in excise taxes in France and Finland had smaller impacts.

 While the pass
-through of crude oil price
s to fuel prices is relatively 
straightforward and fast (almost complete within five weeks)
,34 the pass
-through 
to 
consumer gas and electricity prices is more complex and more limited. Consumer gas 
prices are driven 
largely 
by wholesale gas p
rices, which ov
er time have become less 
strongly linked to oil prices.
35 Electricity is generated in many different ways (hydro, 
solar, wind, nuclear, coal, etc.) and the frequency of price changes for electricity is 
different from that for fuel and gas. In all euro area 
countries,
 the link between oil 
prices and gas and electricity prices is more delayed and weaker than the link between 
oil prices and fuel prices, and the strength of the link also varies more across countries 
for gas and electricity than it does for fuel 
(see Chart D).
36 Moreover, in a number of 
euro area countries, gas and electricity prices (as well as heat energy) are fully or 
partly regulated, so they may respond to oil price changes with a delay or they may not 
respond at all.
37 Owing to this weaker link between gas and electricity prices and 
crude oil prices, euro area countries with a higher share of fuel in their energy basket 
have generally also had a higher contribution of energy to their inflation outcomes in 
recent months.

to a reduction in inflation dispersion. Looking forward, the small downward trend in 
crude oil futures prices imp
lies that energy price inflation should moderate 
somewhat
, reducing both its contribution to headline HICP inflation and cross

in headline inflation due to energy outcomes.

eriod
 Prepared by 
Malin Andersson
, Bela Szörfi, Máté Tóth and Nico Zorell
 Potential output is typically seen by economic analysts as the highest level of 
economic activity that can be sustained over the long
 term. Changes in potential 
output can be driven by factors such as labour supply, capital investment and 
technological innovation. Recent estimates by international institutions suggest that 
the euro area economy is currently operating close 
to 
its potenti
al. The ongoing 
economic expansion appears to have largely absorbed the spare capacity created by 
the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis. At the same time, the 
estimated rate of potential output growth also appears to have recovered most
 of its 
pre
-crisis momentum, underpinned mainly by an expansion of the labour force, a 
decline in trend unemployment and stronger productivity gains. Looking ahead, 
projections by international institutions suggest that actual euro area GDP growth will 
con
tinue to outpace potential growth in the near term. Hence, supply constraints are 
likely to become increasingly binding going forward, which would be conducive to a 
gradual strengthening of euro area inflation.
 1 Introduction
 Potential output is a key econ
omic concept as its evolution determines how 
fast an economy can grow in a sustainable way.
 It is 
typically
 thought of as the 
highest 
level of economic activity that can be sustained by means of the available 
technology and 
factors of production
, in partic
ular 
labour 
and capital
, without creating 
inflationary pressure
. I
nstitutions that facilitate and encourage innovation, 
factor
 accumulation
 and an efficient allocation of resources 
are particularly conducive to 
faster growth
 in potential output
. Therefore,
 sound structural policies 
play a key role in 
promoting sustainable growth.
 For central banks, potential output estimates can support the analysis of
 the 
state of the 
business 
cycle and the implications for the dynamics of wages and 
prices.
 If economic activity exceeds the level of potential output, the increased 
factor
 utilisation 
will typically 
put upward pressure on 
factor costs 
and ultimately
 on consumer prices. Similarly, such price pressures tend to recede if economic activity 
falls bel
ow the level of potential output. T
he output gap, 
defined as 
the percentage 
deviation of the actual level of output
 (i.e.
 real GDP)
 from the potential level, is 
therefore 
often regarded as an indicator of the state of the business cycle and possible 
inflat
ionary pressures.
 Potential output estimates also provide 
a basis for 
adjusting 
government budget balances for 
the effects of the business
 cycle 
and are included in 
analyses of 
the long
-term sustainability of public debt. 
Moreover, they are also used to 
gauge the impact of s
tructural reforms
.  ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 7 / 2018

 Potential output in the post
-crisis period
  50 As potential output is unobservable, it can only be estimated with uncertainty.
 There are various methods for estimating potential output on the basis of observed 
data. However, regardless of the method used, such esti
mates are subject to 
considerable uncertainty and often revised heavily over time. Therefore, they need to 
be treated with caution.
 Against this backdrop, t

output, while Sections

. 2 The concept of potential output and its measurement
 2.1
 Definition and determinants
 Potential output is 
typically
 defined 
as the
 highest
 level of economic activity 
that can be sustained by means of the available 
technology and 
factors of 
production without
 creating inflationary pressure.
38 Attempts to exceed this level 
of production 
will 
lead to rising levels of factor
 utilisation, 
thereby 
putting
 upward 
pressure on factor costs and
 ultimately on consumer price inflation. Starting from a 
neutral position in 
the economic cycle, a sustainable, non
-inflationary increase in 
output needs to be underpinned by an expansion of potential output.
 It is important to distinguish between the level and the rate of growth of 
potential output.
 If the 
level
 of potential outpu
t exceeds actual output, a negative 
output gap emerges. In such circumstances, the closing of a negative output gap 
would require actual growth to exceed potential growth for a period of time.
 Potential output 
is usually thought to be determined by supply
-side factors, 
highlighting
 the importance of sound structural policies for sustainable 
long
-term growth
. The 
supply
-side 
determinants include the state of technology and 
the available factors of production, most notably labour and capital.
 At a more 
fundam
ental level, the 
long
-term 
capacity of an economy to produce is shaped by 
its
 institutional framework
, including 
the structure of property rights
, regulations and the 
judicial 
and educational 
system
s. Economies 
with institutions that facilitate and 
encoura
ge innovation
, factor
 accumulation and 
an efficient allocation of resources 
can 
be expected to record faster growth in the long run
.39 Indeed, according to 
                                                                    38  Alternative concepts
 whereby 
potential output 
is defined 
as the level of output that could be obtained in 
the absence of price
-setting frictions or 
market inefficiencies 
(such as imperfect competition) also appear 
in the literature. However, the corresponding potential output series are highly dependent on the 
underlying model and the frictions assumed therein. See

 Potential output in the post

  51 Eurosystem estimates, the implementation of best institutional practices in euro area 
countries could significantly boost their potential 
growth
 rates.
40 The global financial crisis 
has led to suggestions that
 demand
-side factors 
might also have very persis
tent or even permanent impacts on output
.41 According to the 
ﬁhysteresisﬂ
 hypothesis, demand shortfalls can perpetuate 
themselves by adversely affecting the supply potential of the economy and thereby 
lowering the level of potential output or even its longe
r-term growth rate. For instance, 
a demand
-led recession may discourage workers from searching for jobs or lead to 
the erosion of their skills. Firms may refrain from undertaking investment decisions or 
cut their innovation budgets, which would lower the l
evel of production that can be 
sustained without stoking (dis
-)inflationary pressure. According to this view
, 
countercyclical policies could 
reduce the risks of hysteresis in times of crisis or reverse 
its effects ex post
, with lasting positive impacts on 
output.
42 Whether the hysteresis 
hypothesis is valid is ultimately an empirical question and may also vary across 
economies and over time.
 2.2
 Measurement
 Since potential output 
cannot be observed
 directly
, it 
has to be estimated
. Simple statistical m
ethodo
logies
 (ﬁunivariate filtersﬂ)
 Œ such as t
he Hodrick
-Prescott 
(HP) 
filter
 Œ derive potential output by smoothing out fluctuations in actual output. They 
mechanically split the observed output series into a trend component and a cyclical 
component. More soph
isticated statistical 
approaches 
(ﬁmultivariate filtersﬂ) also use
 information from 
other economic indicators
, such as inflation
, to disentangle the trend 
from the cycle. Another common approach, which is employed by the European 
Commission and the Organis
ation for Economic Co
-operation and Development 
(OECD), is based on 
a macroeconomic 
production function
, i.e.
 a simple model of the 
supply side of the economy
 relating 
potential output to
 the trend components of
 productivity and the available 
factor inputs
 (usually labour and capital
).43 Hybrid 
methods combine useful elements from both the statistical approach and the 
production function approach (see Box
 1). Other approaches are based on more 
complex structural economic models.
44 Importantly, all these metho
ds for measuring 
potential 
output have their limitations
. Therefore
, 
the analysis below will draw on a 
broad range of 
estimates 
based on alternative 
methodologies.
 Regardless of the method used, estimates of potential output are subject to 
considerable unc
ertainty.

 Potential output in the post
-crisis period
  52 always implies judgement and introduces uncertainty. Since models are simplifications 
of reality, not all information that is possibly relevant for estimating potential output can 
be processe
d. In addition, owing to the typically stochastic nature of these models, a 
degree of uncertainty inherently stems from the characteristics of the
ir shocks. 
The 
uncertainty also relates to the parameters of such models which can only be estimated 
with impr
ecision. 
Moreover, 
the data
 Œ both historical and projected
 Œ which 
are used 
to estimate 
the models are subject to revisions. Such modifications can result in 
significant revisions to the estimated path of potential output. Overall, 
owing 
to these 
differen
t types of uncertainty, any point estimate of the output gap has to be 
treated 
with a significant degree of caution.
 Box
 1  An unobserved components model for euro area potential output
 Prepared by M
áté Tóth The unobserved components model (UCM
-PF) introduced in this box combines a multivariate 
filter approach with a Cobb
-Douglas production function (PF) relating potential output to 
labour, capital and total factor productivity (TFP). 
This combination incorporate
s more economic 
structure 
than the
 traditional production function approach, 
in which 
production inputs are typically 
filtered individually with the help of univariate filters. A possible 
shortcoming 
of the latter approach is 
that the resulting potential output path may closely resemble a 
potential output path extracted with a 
univariate filter applied to the output series itself, 
thus 
providing little 
added value. The 
UCM-PF 
approach 
addresses
 this issue by estimating the trends of the relevant production inputs jointly in a 
system of equa
tions 
in which 
the trend
-cycle decomposition is subject to 
certain 
key, 
albeit 
reduced
-form
, economic relationships (see

 A). Figure

  53 The underlying model is a backward
-looking state
-space 
model that employs the Kalman 
filter to decompose four key observable variables (real GDP, the unemployment rate, a 
measure of core inflation and wage inflation) into trend and cyclical components.
 For this 
purpose
, it relies on several economic relationsh
ips, including a Cobb
-Douglas production function
, a wage and
 a price Phillips curve and an Okun™s law relationship. A number of additional variables enter 
the model as exogenously determined observables (e.g.
 the 
capital stock
 and the
 working age 
populati
on), while others (such as the labour force participation rate and average hours worked) are 
endogenously decomposed 
into cyclical and trend components
, 
with the latter serving as input 
into 
the embedded production function.
 In the model, a closed output g
ap is consistent with 
the absence 
of excessive 
price or wage pressures, namely inflation being on its long
-run trend and wage inflation 
being consistent with trend inflation and trend productivity growth.
 In the following sections, 
model
-based uncertainty 
bands generated by the UCM
-PF will be used to highlight the uncertainty 
surrounding point estimates of the output gap, potential growth and the trend unemployment rate (or 
non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment
 Œ NAIRU).
  3 Recent developments in 
potential output
 This section analyses 
recent 
developments in potential output in the euro area.
 It focuses on the 
post
-crisis 
period
 (2014
-18), but also briefly revisits the 
crisis 
years 
(2008
-13) and the pre
-crisis 
period 
(1999
-2007).45 The analysis is 
based on a broad 
range of estimates by the European Commission
, the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) and the 
OECD
, along with estimates based on the model presented in Box
 1. Potential growth 
in the euro area is estimated to have increased
 over recent 
yea
rs, 
although it is still 
weaker than before the global financial crisis.
 Prior to 
the crisis, potential growth was judged to be on a secular downward trend (see 
Chart
 1). 
Between
 1999 and 2007, 
the estimated rate of 
potential growth gradually 
declined 
from
 around 
2.3% to around 
1.7%. The outbreak of the global financial crisis 
seems to have led to a further 
decline in 
potential growth
 to below 1.0%
. However, 
available estimates indicate that potential output recovered in the post
-crisis period, 
reaching gro
wth rates close to 1.5%. Hence, the latest estimates for euro area 
potential growth are well above those for the crisis years, albeit still below those for the 
pre
-crisis period. All these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, as 
indicated by 
the shaded bands in Chart
 1. At the same time, they all point to an 
inverted J
-shaped path for euro area potential growth in the period between 1999 and 
2017. Moreover, estimates of the euro area aggregate mask significant heterogeneity 
across individual e
uro area countries
. The level of 
euro area 
potential output remains well below the path 
implied by 
the pre
-crisis trends
. This can be illustrated with a simple linear projection in which it 
is assumed that from 2007 onwards potential output steadily increa
sed at the pace 
recorded in that year. The European Commission™s latest estimate of potential output 
                                                                    45  For the crisis period, see

 Potential output in the post
-crisis period
  54 in 2017 is around 10% below the level implied by the linear projection (see Chart
 2). 
However, caution is warranted when using such gaps as a proxy for the
 impact of the 
crisis. Real
-time estimates of potential output are often subject to substantial 
revisions, especially in times of crisis. In fact, the potential output estimates for the 
euro area were widely revised downwards following the onset of the glo
bal financial 
crisis, before these revisions went into reverse more recen
tly.

 Potential output in the post

  55 apparently continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace than before the crisis. As a 
result, a negative output gap op
ened up, signalling slack in the euro area economy 
(see Chart
 3).
46 During the economic recovery, 
GDP growth consistently exceeded 
available estimates of potential growth
. Consequently, the negative 
output gap
 gradually declined and now seems to be close to
 zero. S
upply constraints are likely to 
become increasingly binding 
going forward, which 
would be conducive to a gradual 
strengthening of wage growth and underlying inflation.

 1 (with an uncert
ainty band of plus/minus two standard deviations around the 
point estimate). The UCM
-PF estimates for 2018 only incorporate data up to 
the second quarter of 2018
. The similarity in estimates by international institutions understates the 
uncertainty 
surrounding
 the 
current 
output gap
 in the euro area
. In particular, it 
has been argued that economic slack might still be larger than indicated by the 
consensus view of international institutions.
 This argument is often based on the 
observation that
 the un
derlying potential growth estimates and their revisions tend to 
co-move with economic activity.
47 This 
procyclicality 
could partly 
be a statistical 
artefact 
due to methodological issues, 
such as the well
-known end
-point problem of 
filtering procedures. 
There may therefore 
be reason to believe that the degree of 
economic slack in the euro area 
over recent years has been larger 
than indicated by 
the estimates of international institutions.
48 This could also help explain the relatively 
muted dynamics of underlyi
ng inflation over this period. However, the procyclicality of 
potential growth and output gap estimates may also stem from hysteresis, the 
downward rigidity of prices and wages, and other effects that pull down potential 
growth during economic downturns an
d gradually wane during upturns (see 
Section
 2.1).

 Potential output in the post

  56 4 Dissecting recent 
developments in potential output
 In an accounting sense, potential output is determined by the trend 
components of the factors of production
 Œ capital and labour
 Œ and total factor 
prod
uctivity (TFP).
 A macroeconomic production function can be used to decompose 
potential growth into the contributions from labour, capital and TFP (see Section
 2.2). 
TFP 
captures the overall efficiency of the use of the factors of production and its 
evoluti
on is therefore often seen as a rough indication of technological progress.
 In 
practice, TFP is not directly observable and is typically calculated as a residual term in 
a growth accounting exercise. Thus it cannot be considered a pure measure of 
productiv
ity.
 Both the decline in potential growth during the crisis and its subsequent 
recovery were largely driven by the contributions of capital and labour.
 Both 
contributions declined during the crisis, before recovering in the post
-crisis period (see 
Chart
 4). The latest estimates for 2017 indicate that the contributions of labour and 
TFP to potential growth are broadly in line with those in 2007. However, the 
contribution of capital is still weaker than before the crisis, explaining why potential 
growth has n
ot yet fully recovered.
 The downward trend in potential growth in the 
pre
-crisis period mainly reflected a secular decline in 
TFP growth.

 While the inverted J
-shaped path of potential growth found in the euro area has 
also been observed in other major advanced 
economies
, there are notable 
cross
-country differences in the underlying driving forces
. Box
 2 illustrates this 
for the United States
 and Japan. Moreover, from a long
-term perspective, potential 
growth in the euro area has fallen short of that in other major advanced economies, in 
particular the United States.

 2  Potential output developments in the United States and Japan
 Prepared 
by Ana
-Simona Manu and Marcel Tirp
ák Similarly
 to developments in the euro area, estimated potential output in the United States 
and Japan has recovered since 2013 along with economic activity.
 At the same time
, 
the 
current 
pace 
of potential growth 
in the 
US economy remains well
 below the growth rates recorded prior to the 
global financial crisis
, while it is broadly comparable 
to pre
-crisis rates 
in the case of Japan. 
According 
to
 a broad range of estimates, including from national sources and internationa
l institutions
, potential 
growth is currently estimated 
at 
close to 2% in the United States and around 1% in Japan (see 
Chart
 A).

 An increasing stock of capital, reflecting strengthening investment activity in this period, was 
a key 
contributory 
factor 
in 
the r
ecovery in potential output in both countries.
 While investment 
activity plummeted
 in the aftermath of the 
global financial crisis
, the ensuing demand recovery
 Œ supported by economic policies
 Œ helped stimulate investment spending amid gradually declining
 spare capacities (see Chart
 B). By contrast, the contribution of the labour component to potential growth in the United States 
and Japan differed
, owing to secular trends observed in these two countries.
 In the United 
States, 
the labour contribution has 
remained positive and broadly unchanged since the 
global 
financial crisis,
 as slower growth 
in 
the potential labour force was counteracted by a gradual decline in 
the 
trend 
unemployment
 rate
. The latter could reflect 
the 
gradual 
waning of 
hysteresis effects
 and also shifts in the composition of 
the 
workforce
, which in turn may
 reflect, for example, the fact that 
older and more educated workers tend to have lower unemployment rates. In Japan, the contribution 
of labour to potential growth turned positive in 2
013, following a prolonged period of strong negative 
readings
. Demographic developments, leading to a shrinking workforce, are 
the 
main factor that led 
to labour having acted as a drag on potential output. 
Recent 
measures taken 
by the Japanese 
government 
to encourage the 
participation of women in the labour market, the increasing willingness 
of retired workers to remain active amid rising longevity, 
and more flexible working contracts 
offered 
by 
Japanese 
firms 
have all 
helped to increase labour

 TFP growth contributed positively to potential output in both countries, although it 
has 
show
n diverging pa
tterns over the recent past.
 In the United States, the 
contribution from 
TFP 
growth 
has 
remained broadly stable during the post
-crisis period. In Japan, the estimated positive 
contribution of TFP growth has roughly halved over the same period, which 
can 
be attributed to 
an ageing capital stock and delays in the introduction of new technolog
ies.
50 However, 
the increasing 
implementation of 
technological advances
, especially in sectors currently facing acute labour 
shortages
, could strengthen underlying product
ivity growth over the longer
 term
.51 Looking ahead, demographic developments present both countries with a challenge that 
needs to be resolved to avoid weakening their potential growth.
 In Japan, progress in 
implement
ing
 the government™s growth strategy, in
cluding regulatory and institutional reforms, further 
increases in labour 
force 
participation, 
and continued efforts 
by firms 
to increase productivity are 
expected to tackle this and contribute to gradually accelerating potential growth over the next 
few 
years.
52 In the United States, the recent changes in income taxes could encourage more people 
to 
enter the labour force, 
thereby 
limiting the negative impact on potential growth stemming from 
population ageing.
53 Also, 
the reduction in 
corporate income tax could boost investment and 
thereby 
contribute to higher potential output, whereas recent policies 
aimed 
at reducing immigration could 
have an opposite effect 
by 
further weakening 
the 
growth of 
the 
labour force.

 Potential output in the post

  59 5 A closer look at the 
factors driving potential output
 This section takes a closer look at 
some of
 the
 underlying 
factors
 driving recent 
developments in potential output in the euro area
. In particular, it seeks to answer 
the question of why the contributions of labour and TFP 
to potential growth have 
broadly returned to their pre
-crisis levels, while the capital contribution remains 
subdued. The section concludes by looking at the longer
-term outlook for potential 
growth.
 5.1
 Labour
 The contribution of labour to potential growt
h can be traced back to trends in 
the labour force, the unemployment rate and hours worked per employee
. The labour force includes all those in work 
or 
seeking 
work
. Changes in the labour force, in 
turn, can 
be decomposed into 
changes in 
the 
working age po
pulation 
(15
-74 years of 
age) and the labour force 
participation rate
 (i.e.
 the 
percentage 
of the working
 age population
 participating in the labour force).
 The enlargement of the working age population on account of immigration has 
supported potential gro
wth over recent years.
 Following a contraction between 
2009 and 2015, the working age population has been increasing over recent years. 
These developments reflect two countervailing forces (see Chart
 5). On the one hand, 
ﬁnaturalﬂ population growth has bee
n negative for some time now, since the 
ﬁbaby-boom
erﬂ
 generation 
is reaching 
retirement 
age and fertility rates are low
. On the 
other hand, there has been a net inflow of people of working age, in particular from 
other EU Member States.
54                                                                     54  It should be noted that the decomposition of changes in the working age population by citizenship is only 
an imperfect proxy of mig
ration flows.

 15 to 74
 holding citizenship of an EU Member State

2010) and 
France (first quarter of 2014). The chart is based on four

ages.
 Labour force participation has continued to increase during the recovery, 
underpinned 
by 
increased participation of the older generations and 
women
.55 While t
he euro area labour force is ageing, more people are remaining economically 
active later in l
ife.
 In line with this longer
-term trend, the participation rate of those 
aged 55 to 7
4 has continued to increase
 during the recovery. This reflects increases
 in 
the 
pension age in 
many euro area 
countries, as well as other factors, 
most notably 
rising 
education level
s. 
In addition, 
the 
labour force 
participation of women
 has 
continued to increase, which is also partly due to rising education levels.
56 All these 
structural changes have contributed to a steady increase in the participation rate over 
recent ye
ars (see Chart
 6). Coupled with a growing working age population, this trend 
has led to an expansion of the labour force during the ongoing economic recovery. 
However, the rate of growth of the labour force still remains below that recorded in the 
pre

is period.

 6 Labour force participation rate by gender and age
 (percentages)
  Source: Eurostat.
 Notes: The total participation rate is defined as 
the labour force 
as a percentage of 
the working age population
. The latter comprises 
those aged between
 15 and 74. The participation rates for individual groups (i.e.
 women, men and older people) only relate to the 
relevant parts of the labour force and the population.
 A decline in the trend unemployment rate 
is estimated to be 
another important 
driver of t
he post
-crisis recovery in potential growth.
 The trend 
unemployment 
rate
 broadly corresponds to the unemployment rate that 
is consistent with 
non-accelerating wage
 (or price)
 inflation
.57 Available estimates overall suggest that 
the trend unemployment rate
 in the euro area 
increased 
in 
the crisis
 period, partly due 
to hysteresis effects, before declining to around 8.0
-9.5% more recently (see Chart
 7). To some extent, these developments reflect transitory factors. Since 
wages 
tend to 
adjust slowly to
 shocks
, 
the 
macroeconomic 
adjustment partly 
operates 
through 
persistent 
changes in the unemployment rate.
 However, the post
-crisis decline in the 
estimated trend unemployment rate is also likely to be driven by structural factors, 
most notably the labour market re
forms undertaken in some euro area countries.
                                                                     57  An alternative concept

the second quarter of 2018
. Hours worked per employee have continued to decline over recent years, 
although 
the

.58 The longer

in average hours worked per employee mainly reflects secular changes in the 
composition of euro area employment. Most importantly, the shares of part

workers and the services sector (where hours worked are typically low
er than in other 
sectors) in overall employment have increased over the past decade.

 Capital
 The c
apital stock 
is
 another
 essential 
determinant of potential output
, but data 
are not easy to obtain
. The g
ross capital stock 
is the physical capital availa
ble in 
the 
private and public sectors of the 
economy for production
 processes
.59 The true 
potential capital stock is not directly measurable but can be calculated using the 
ﬁperpetual inventoryﬂ method.
 The current net capital stock is then derived from the
 past capital stock, subtracting depreciation and adding new investment. Such capital 
stock data come with a long publication lag.
60 The real capital stock also depends on 
price trends of capital goods. These trends could be very different from those of 
int
ermediate and consumer
 goods. Over the past two decades, the investment 
deflator

as supported the capital
-output ratio in real terms.
61 The 
rising share of intangible investment increases capital consumption and 
poses challenges to measuring the 
capital stock
. The capital stock in the 
construction sector generally depreciates very slowl
y, while the business sector capital 
stock, particularly intangibles, depreciates much faster.
62 Aggregate depreciation 
rates 
are likely to increase 
gradually 
as countries™ 
income
 levels rise,
 assuming that 
the share of assets with shorter lifespans (such a
s intangible 
assets) 
grows
 in 
economically more advanced countries
. As a result, the 
amount of investment 
required 
to offset the consumption of capital and to maintain 
the 
capital stock at a 
constant level increases. At the same time, it is possible that t
he size of the capital 
stock remains underestimated owing to insufficient incorporation of intangible 
investment
63 in the national accounts (s
ee also 
the box entitled ﬁ
Investment in 
intangibles in the euro area
ﬂ in this issue of the Economic Bulletin).
64 Intangible 
investment 
has long been considered 
largely 
as intermediate consumption
 Œ as 
opposed to investment
 Œ on the balance sheets of firms, reflecting the fact that such 
investment was thought to exclusively benefit firms themselves. Available estimat
es 
suggest that 
GDP (and gross saving and investment rates) 
in Europe would be 
5 to 
10 percentage points higher 
if all 
intangibles 
were 
classified as investment
.65 The 
cyclical 
recovery
 in o
verall investment since the crisis
 has given 
some 
positive impetus to 
the 
capital stock 
in the euro area, alt
hough 
its contribution 
to the capital stock has been lower than in the 
pre
-crisis 
period
. Increasing 
demand, low financing costs and better access to finance as a result of the ECB™s 
accommodative 
monetary policy have supported the recovery in investment.
66 As a 
result
, capital stock growth rates have accelerated in the euro area in the period since 
the crisis
 (see Chart
 8). However, lower than pre
-crisis growth rates of investment
67 have weighed on c
apital stock contributions to potential growth in the recovery period 
(see Chart
 4). There are a number of factors behind the lower growth rates. First, it 
took time to unwind excess capacity accumulated during the crisis in the construction 
sector
 Œ parti
cularly in housing, but also in commercial and industrial construction
 Œ which resulted in underutilised capital and excess capacity. Second, recent years have 
still been characterised by persistently high uncertainty, slowing growth expectations 
related p
artly to population ageing, and remaining deleveraging needs, both in the 
                                                                    61  For evidence on Germany, see the ar

 Total factor productivity
 In the decade leading up to the global financial crisis, 
TFP 
growth was on a 
downward trend
 in the euro area and 
in other advanced economies
. Between
 1999 and 2007, t
rend TFP growth 
gradually slowed from 1.0% to 0.5%, 
according to European Commission estimates (see Chart
 9). Several explanations 
have been proposed for this deceleration, some of which are complementar
y.69 Mismeasurement 
problems, for instance with regard to in
tangible investments
, may 
have led to an underestimation
 of TFP growth. More fundamentally, recent 
innovations 
might have been 
less pervasive 
than 
earlier 
technological advances,
 such as the 
railwa
ys and 
electricity.
 Moreover, there is evidence that it takes longer for 
technological innovations by pioneering firms to be 
incorporated into the production 
processes of 
other
 firms.

 9 Total factor productivity growth
 (percentage changes)
  Source: 
European Commission.
 Note: The trend is based on estimates by the European Commission.
 The 
global financial crisis
 exacerbated the 
decline in TFP growth.
 In fact, TFP 
growth is even estimated to have turned negative during the crisis, albeit largely driven
 by its cyclical component. Firm
-level evidence indicates that bank f
orbearance and 
inadequate insolvency regimes lock
ed capital into
 firms with low levels of productivity, 
weakening 
the cleansing effects typically associated with recessions.
70 Following th
e unwinding of macroeconomic im
balances in euro area countries, structural rigidities 
may have hampered the necessary reallocation of resources 
towards more productive 
sectors and firms. Moreover
, protracted private sector balance sheet repair 
has 
weaken
ed investment, thereby potentially limiting technological innovation.
 TFP 
growth has increased 
during the 
ongoing economic 
recovery
, broadly 
returning to its pre
-crisis rates
. The adverse effects of the crisis on TFP growth, for 
instance through disruptions 
in financial intermediation, cuts in research and 
development budgets and subdued spending on public infrastructure, have started to 
wane. There is also evidence that the crisis has ultimately led to a reallocation of 
resources towards more productive firm
s (e.g.
 through the elimination of unviable 
businesses). Moreover, it may simply take some time for innovations in the field of 
digitalisation to be widely adopted throughout the economy. Sustained i
mprovements 
in educational attainment 
also continue to 
support 
TFP 
growth
. 5.4
 Longer
-term outlook
 Euro area potential growth will remain broadly stable over the coming years, 
according to the projections by international institutions.
 On average, the 
European Commission, the IMF and the OECD envisage potential 
growth of 1.4% in

 While the longer
-term outlook for potential growth is more uncertain, 
population ageing looks set to exert increasing downward pressure
.71 According to projections by Eurostat, the 
euro area™s old
-age dependency 
ratio
 (i.e.
 the number of people aged 65 or over as a percentage of the working age 
population
) will increase 
from 
around 
30% 
at present 
to around 50% by 20
50 and the 
working age population 
will 
decline
 by around 23
 million over the same period (see 
Chart
 10). This forecast already takes into account net immigration of around 
800,000
 persons per year
. 
The expected decline in the working age population could 
be partly offset by further increases in 
the overall participation rate 
on the back of 
previous pensi
on reforms and 
rising 
education levels. 
However, on the basis of these 
projections, the euro area l

 The impact of population ageing on potential growth could be partly offset by 
other factors.
 In particular, automa
tion and digitalisation could support TFP growth 
(see Box
 3). However, 
when and 
to 
what 
extent this 
will 
happen is highly uncertain.
 With regard to
 the capital stock
, it
 could be expected to continue growing
 and 
to contribute positively to potential growth
. International institutions also expect 
capital stock growth to accelerate further in the next few years. The reasons for 
continued capital accumulation include sustained cyclical demand, near
-full capacity 
utilisation in the capital goods
-producing secto
r and a continued need to replace and 
upgrade capital in order to face the challenges posed by globalisation and the digital 
economy. I
n the longer term
, expectations of further advances in technology
 Œ and the 
resulting changing composition of the capital
 stock
 Œ point to an accelerating need for 
capital accumulation to keep up with rising overall depreciation rates. R
ecent
 research 
has 
also 
found that the
 capital stock of intangible assets adjusts more slowly to 
fluctuations in the economy than tangible i
nvestment,
72 given the irreversible nature of 
intangible investment. T
his could result in a capital stock that is becoming less 
sensitive to the business cycle.

 Potential output in the post

  68 productivity and 
employment effects.
73 One a
spect of this is the digitalisation of production and 
supply chains, involving automation, robotisation and artificial intelligence.
 This tends to change 
relative prices and the allocation of work across factors of production, 
for
 instance
 between 
labour 
and capital
 or between
 routine and non
-routine jobs, and thereby affect productivity. 
Another 
aspect 
of digitalisation is digital and mobile communication and connectivity, encompassing the internet
, social media, cloud computing and big data analysis. 
These have an 
impact on competition by 
altering relative prices and market shares 
between
, 
for instance, 
digital and non
-digital firms or small 
and large firms (the 
ﬁwinner takes all
ﬂ phenomenon). The t
hird aspect of digitalisation is new goods 
and services, both 
information technology (
IT
)-related 
and non
-IT
-related
, which may lead to changes 
in price
s and/or
 consumer 
preferences.
 While 
some aspects of 
digitalisation 
are 
more advanced than others, it se
ems to be 
progressing relatively steadily for the EU as a whole.
 This can be s
een, for example, from the 
European Commission™s Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), as displayed in Chart
 A for the 
EU for the sample between 2014 and 2018.
 It is importan
t to note
, however,
 that many of the major 
milestones of digitalisation occurred before the sample covered in 
Chart
 A, 
such as early 
research on 
artificial intelligence in the 1950s, the first computer networks in the 1960s, the first email in the 
1970s, t
he first driverless car in the 1980s, the world
-wide web, the internet of things 
and 
search 
engines in the 1990s, and social media in the 2000s. As a result, digitalisation is perhaps best 
described as a succession of supply shocks occurring, and impac
ting
 on the economy, over time.

. Digitalisation may affect all the contributions to potential output
 Œ namely labour, capital and 
TFP.
 Digital production and supply chains, for example, may raise TFP, because of the greater 
efficiency (in terms of ti
me and/or quality) of digitally

(e.g.
 just
-in-time) production technology.
 Digital

 TFP, by enabling 
the 
faster collection and evaluation of data. 
At the same time, there have been

  69 suggestions that some
 digital and mobile communication 
applications 
could act as a distraction 
from 
productive activity
. 
While
 it is unclear how the TFP contribution has been
 or 
is going to be 
affect
ed by 
digital technolog
y, it 
seems
 likely that the 
overall 
effect 
would
 be supportive of potential growth.
 It is 
also 
likely that 
the 
TFP contribution of digital technologies has been supportive of potential growth in 
the past, although it 
is noteworthy that this 
has not been su
fficient to offset the decline in trend TFP 
growth.
 While digitalisation may support potential output via the TFP contribution, the effects via the 
contributions from labour and capital are more uncertain.
 Digital production and supply chains 
may lead to 
an increased need for
 labour for non
-repetitive, non
-routine tasks, digital skills and 
professions, or other skills and professions for the digital work environment (such as openness to 
change and/or adaptability to new technologies). At the same time, 
howe
ver
, they may entail a 
reduced requirement
 for 
lower skilled labour for more 
routine tasks
 and a corresponding 
shift to more 
(IT) capital. Although th
ese effects might be expected to be broadly offsetting, it is also conceivable 
that the labour contributio
n to potential output may be pushed up or pulled down somewhat
 in ways 
that are difficult to predict
. The same might be 
true of 
the capital contribution. While substantial 
investments in digital technology might be expected, the effect on the 
overall 
physi
cal capital stock 
might be limited, 
particularly if the new technologies increase the intensity with which capital assets 
can be used.
 How the effects 
of 
digitalisation on potential output 
might 
unfold depends on a number of 
factors, and 
is 
therefore diffi

 It is noticeable
, however,
 that some economies are 
more advanced than others

certain aspects of digitalisation

economies with an environment conducive to research and innovation are likely to see faster 
adoption and implementation of digital technologies and 
thus al
so 
a fast

  6 Conclusions
 Available es
timates indicate that 
euro area 
potential 
growth 
has increased over 
recent years, although it 
remains 
weaker than before the global financial crisis.
 Following a 
significant
 slowdown during the crisis, potential growth is estimated to 
have recovered since 
the start of the ongoing economic recovery
. 
Over recent years, 
potential growth has been underpinned by an expansion of the labour force, a decline 
in trend unemployment 
and stronger productivity gains
. While capital formation has 
also accelerated over rec
ent years, it remains weaker than before the crisis
. Supply constraints 
are expected to 
become increasingly binding 
going forward, 
which would be conducive to 
a gradual strengthening 
of wage growth and 
underlying 
inflation
. During the ongoing economic recovery, real GDP growth has 
consistently exceeded available estimates of potential growth. This has led to a 
gradual shrinking of the output gap that opened up during the crisis. The economy now 
seems to be operating close to
 its potential
. It should be noted, however, that 
estimates of potential output and the output gap are fraught with uncertainty.
 Given the imminent challenges arising from population ageing, well
-designed 
structural policies with a focus on enhancing produ
ctivity are essential to boost 
potential growth.
74 Population ageing is expected to exert downward pressure on 
euro area potential growth over the coming decades. This could be offset 
at least 
partly 
by sound structural policies for 
labour, product and serv
ices markets that can be 
expected to raise the labour or TFP contribution to potential growth
. T
o exploit the full 
potential of digitalisation
, the euro area economy needs
 improvements in the quality of 
the digital infrastructure and 
the availability of 
digital skills.
 The deepening of the 
Single Market and c
ompetition
-enhancing product market reforms, 
in particular in the 
services 
sector, would also foster productivity growth
. In addition, the cutting of red 
tape would facilitate 
firm entry and exit
 and th
e efficient 
reallocation of resources 
across firms
. L
abour force and employment growth
 could be supported by policies that 
help 
the long
-term unemployed, migrants and other groups whose participation rates 
remain low to enter or return to the labour market
, or 
to 
find jobs that better match their 
skills
.                                                                       74  See

 The state of the housing market in the euro area
  71 2 The state of the housing market in the euro area
 Prepared by Niccolò Battistini, Julien Le Roux, Moreno Roma and 
John
 Vourdas
 The housing market has important macroeconomic and 
macroprudential implications 
for the euro area economy. In view of the duration of the ongoing upturn in euro area 
house prices and residential investment, which started at the end of 2013, analysing 
the state of the housing market is particularly informat
ive. 
This
 article discusses the 
ongoing housing market upturn, from a chronological and fundamental perspective. It 
also explores a selected set of indicators that can potentially inform on the state of the 
housing market, elaborating on the demand and sup
ply factors underpinning the 
current upturn, as well as their relative importance.
 1 Introduction
 Understanding and monitoring the state of the housing market is important 
because of its macroeconomic and macroprudential implications.
 Housing 
market develo
pments affect investment and consumption decisions and can thus be a 
major determinant of the broader business cycle. They also have wealth and collateral 
effects and can thus play a key role in shaping the broader financial cycle. 
The housing 
market™s
 piv
otal role in the business and financial cycles makes 
it a regular subject of 
monitoring and assessment for monetary policy and financial stability 
considerations.
75 This is especially relevant given that housing markets can be the 
source of booms and busts
, with severe and long
-lasting consequences for economic 
and financial development. Such episodes tend to reflect a decoupling of expectations 
over housing market tendencies from their fundamental determinants.
 The housing market has a price and a volume di
mension.
 Residential property 
prices (
hereafter
 ﬁhouse prices
ﬂ) and residential investment are relevant dimensions 
and are the main focus of this article. They can be seen, in a broader context, as 
outcomes determined by the interaction of different supply
 and demand factors. Price 
and volume developments are not necessarily synchronised, so that possible 
misalignments between them can be an additional source of information
. However,
 they can also make the overall assessment of the state of the housing mark
et more 
challenging. For the euro area, this assessment is subject to the caveat that there is 
considerable heterogeneity across housing markets and their developments across 
countries
. In addition, disentangling developments 
that
 could be associated with 
past 
boom/bust episodes, with a period of accommodative monetary policy 
or with 
changes 
in structural factors add
s to the complexity of the analysis.
 The state of the housing market is, by nature, unobservable but can be 
assessed from different perspective
s. From a chronological perspective, the state 
of the market can be characterised by the length of its upturns or downturns, in 
particular, 
in comparison with the
 average durations of such phases. From a 
                                                                    75  For an earlier discussion, see the article entitled ﬁ

  72 fundamental perspective, it can be assessed by the p
osition of key indicators relative 
to benchmarks, for instance to determine possible house price overvaluation or 
unsustainably high activity in construction. The set of indicators that can potentially 
inform on the state of the housing market is large and
 the discussion in this article 
therefore
 needs to be selective.
76 It aims 
to
 distinguish broadly between demand and 
supply factors, although even this 
distinc
tion
 may be difficult given the nature of some 
of the indicators.
 Against this background, this ar
ticle has two main sections. 
Section
 2 puts into 
perspective the recent developments in house prices and residential investment 
in 
relation to
 the business cycle. Unless otherwise stated, these two indicators are 
expressed in nominal and real terms respect
ively. 
Section
 3 elaborates on the demand 
and supply factors underpinning the current upturn in the housing market, as well as 
their relative importance.
 2 The state of the euro area housing sector: a look at 
residential investment and house prices
 The 
upturn in the 
euro area housing market is in its fourth year.
 Measured in 
terms of annual growth rates, house prices started 
to pick up 
at the end of 2013, while 
the pick
-up in residential investment 
started 
somewhat later
, at the end of 2014. The 
latest a
vailable data (first quarter of 2018) indicate annual growth rates above their 
long
-term averages (see 
Chart
 1, left
-hand panel)
 for both indicators
. This is more 
evident for residential investment 
(where the upturn in growth rates has levelled off
) than f
or house prices 
(where it 
has 
continued
). The timing of the start of the upturn is 
broadly the same when measured in terms of the levels of the two indicators. At the 
same time, the level perspective highlights that residential investment is still 
consider
ably below earlier peaks, while house prices have recovered 
from 
the 
declines 
recorded
 during the financial crisis (see 
Chart
 1, right
-hand panel). In the 
aftermath of the financial crisis, residential investment declined 
sharply 
by 25%, bottoming out
 in 2
014. Thus far 
it has 
only partially recovered 
and in early 2018 
was 
still 
15% below its pre
-crisis level. 
House prices, o
n the other hand, contracted by only
 6% between peak and trough, and in early 2018 were standing
 5% above their 
pre
-crisis level (although in real terms
 Œ deflated by the HICP
 Œ they were
 5% below 
their pre
-crisis
 level).
                                                                     76  In this respect, the article does not discuss some indicators that regularly feature in other assessments of 
the housing market, such as household b
alance sheet positions. For additional indicators see, for 
instance, ﬁMethodologies for the Assessment of Real Estate Vulnerabilities and Macroprudential 
Policies

with 
different magnitudes (

 The state of the housing market in the euro area
  74 From a chronological perspective, at the aggregate euro area level, the length of the 
current upturn 
in both 
residential investment and house prices of about
 4 year
s amounts to the average duration of 
historical 
upturns 
in residential investment and half 
the 
duration
 of 
historical upturns in
 house prices (
see 
Table
 1). For the purpose of this 
article, an upturn exceeding half 
the
 average duration 
of previous upturns 
shall be 
considered relatively mature. It 
should
 be borne
 in mind that turning point analys
is is surrounded by considerable uncertainty, especially at the end of the sample, and that 
there is no unique way of dating the economic phases. Notwithstanding these caveats, 
if we consider
 the five largest 
euro area 
countries, the residential investment
 cycle has 
reached a mature phase in Germany and the Netherlands, while it is still at an early 
stage in France, Italy and
, to a lesser extent
, Spain. According to this metric, the house 
price cycle is 
likewise 
advanced in Germany, while it is still 
at a 
rather 
preliminary 
stage
 in the other countries. In Italy, the formal turning point analysis does not yet 
suggest
 an upturn in house prices.
77 The maturity of the upturn can also be related to 
the strength of the recovery, with more mature cycles generally e
xhibiting lower rates 
of growth compared 
with
 those recorded at an early stage of the cycle.
 The current euro area upturn is stronger than historical averages for residential 
investment but weaker for house prices.
 If cycles 
were to 
evolve around an 
unchan
ged trend, the relatively strong upturn in residential investment can be related 
to the relatively large fall in the aftermath of the crisis: during the ongoing upturn, euro 
area residential investment has increased at an annual average rate of 3.5%, clear
ly 
above the average of 1.9% recorded for the same duration in previous upturn phases 
(see 
Table
 1). For euro area house prices
, the corresponding comparison suggests a 
relatively muted upturn, with an annual average rate of increase of 2.7%
 Œ below the 
historical average of 6.3%. For house prices, this relatively muted pattern is 
common
 across the largest euro area countries
, whereas
 in the case of residential investment 
the outcomes are mixed: the Netherlands and France exhibited higher than average 
upturns, while the opposite was true for Germany, Spain and Italy. This metric is an 
additional gauge for assessing the state of the hou
sing market, but it comes with the 
caveat that the relative strength of the upturn may look ﬁartificiallyﬂ low in countries 
where the historical averages are influenced by unsustainable booms in the housing 
market. To this end, assessments against fundamen
tal values are also needed.
                                                                     77  A visual inspection of the series would ins
tead suggest a trough around the first quarter of 2015, after 
which house prices have been broadly stable.

of change of real residential investment and nominal house prices over th

Q1 1980-Q1 2018. Only completed phases are 
included in the computation of average durations and growth rates.
 (*) In Italy, where house prices have not yet 
bottomed out
, data refer to downturn phases.
 Assessing hous
e prices and 
residential 
investm
ent against fundamentals also 
provides insights on the state of the cycle.
 Chronologies of the housing cycle can 
only provide a partial gauge for assessing the state of the housing market, although, 
empirically, being out of tune with fundamentals often co
incided with the state of the 
cycle being relatively more advanced and having seen a relatively strong magnitude of 
adjustment. Benchmarking against fundamentals can take several forms, such as 
simple ratios, deviations from model
-explained values, or synt
hetic combinations of 
such metrics. In the case of house prices, valuation estimates are regularly applied in 
financial stability assessments
78 and currently point to a slight overvaluation for the 
euro area as a whole, as well as for Germany and France (
see Chart
 3). In the case of 
residential investment, this article introduces a synthetic indicator constructed from 
different (standardised) ratios for output and employment in the construction sector. 
For both the euro area and the largest euro area countri
es, this indicator suggests that 
the residential investment cycle is close to its historical norm, somewhat above for 
Germany and somewhat below in the case of Italy.
                                                                     78  Valuation estimates are surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty, while their interpretation may be 
complicated at the country level, given nati
onal specificities like fiscal treatment or structural factors 
(e.g.
 tenure status).
 Moreover, 
developments are
 heterogeneous 
not only 
across countries 
but 
in some 
cases across regions within a country

 2015.  Overall, the state of the euro area housing market is relatively mature but
 is not
, 
so far, 
characterised by disproportionate residential investment activity or 
house price dynamics.
 The analysis shown in this section suggests more strength 
and maturity 
in the euro area residential investment cycle than in the house price 
cycle. However, measured
 against underlying fundamentals, the former does not 
appear, so far, 
to be 
above 
its 
historical norm. Given that the housing sector can be an 
important driver of the business cycle and that residential investment and house prices 
can have leading indicato
r properties for future economic activity, the current state 
does not herald imminent risks of a move towards 
a contraction in the economic cycle 
(see

 Fluctuations in the housing market are an important factor affecting business cycle dynamics 
and
 macroeconomic expectations.
79 While
 residential investment is a relatively small component 
of the economy 
(accounting
, in nominal terms,
 for 6% 
of GDP 
between the first quarter of 1997 and 
the first quarter of 2018), it exhibits 
greater
 volatility 
than the
 other expenditure components
 of GDP
. 
Residential investment 
is an expenditure component in 
its own right but 
can also have significant 
implications in terms of consumption expenditures in durable goods as new or 
refurbished
 housing
 is equipped.

 The st
ate of the housing market in the euro area
  77 affected by
 aggregate variables such as demographic transitions and credit and financing conditions, 
thus acting as an important propagating mechanism of underlying shocks. 
Consequen
tly
, residential 
investment developments
 can
 have
 a wider impact on the economy. In particular, residential 
investment developments have 
been found to 
lead 
developments in
 GDP
, especially before 
recessions.
80 In addition, house price developments have also been found to carry important 
information for subseq
uent recessions, especially when triggered by exuberant expectations and 
excessive credit growth. This box illustrates how residential investment and house prices can 
contribute to the estimation of short
-term probabilities of future prolonged contractions
 in economic 
activity.
 The specific hypothesis that housing market dynamics can predict prolonged contractions 
can be formally tested on the basis of a panel logit model on euro area data.
81 Following 
Kohlscheen et al. (2018),
82 the panel logit model regress
es a binary indicator of a prolonged (at least 
two
-quarter) contraction in real GDP occurring within the following four quarters on
 (1)
 the slope of the 
yield curve and
 (2)
 the number of quarters with a negative quarterly growth rate in the current and the
 previous three quarters of the two housing market indicators of interest.
83 In order to benchmark the 
predictive power of residential investment and house prices
, the 
latter 
metric is also constructed for 
other GDP components: non
-residential investment, t
otal consumption and the trade balance.
84 The model confirms a statistically significant predictive power of housing market variables 
for future prolonged contractions.
 All specifications in 
Table
 A confirm that the slope of the yield 
curve
 Œ except when considered alone in 
column (1)
 Œ provides useful information for forecasting the 
start of a prolonged contraction.
85 Columns
 (2)
 and (3)
 show that residential investment and house 
prices
, respectively,
 significantly increase the predictive power
 of the model (from 3% to 
within 
16-18%, 
broadly in line with
 the estimates presented in Kohlscheen et al., 2018, with a similar model). 
Furthermore, as shown in 
column
 (4)
 of Table
 A, including both indicators at the same time further 
improves the predict
ive power (up to 21%). Columns
 (5)
 and (6)
 show that total consumption has a 
statistically significant predictive power 
both 
on its own (as do non
-residential investment and the 
trade balance, 
which are

s excluding relatively small countries joining the euro area in 
the late 2000s and (former) programme countries (Ireland, Greece and Portugal). Results for housing 
variables (investment and prices) are robust to the inclusion of the latter countries.

y contribute to the prediction of imminent 
economic contractions 
beyond what can be inferred 
from
 the slope of the yield curve.
 At the 
same time, housing market variables alone cannot fully predict future economic contractions and 
other indicators
, such as
 financial variables
, may further improve on their predictive power. At the 
current juncture, the analysis presented in this 
box does not raise significant concerns of an imminent 
economic contraction
 as a result of housing market dynamics

 3 Supply and demand factors behind the current state of the 
housing market
 House prices and residential in
vestment can be seen, in a broader context, as 
outcomes determined by the interaction of supply and demand factors. Such 
underlying factors can thus shed additional light on the state of the housing market. 
However, corresponding indicators are scarce, oft
en lagging, and 
are 
not always easy 
to interpret in
 terms of
 whether they provide information unequivocally on the demand 
or 
the 
supply side. This section makes a selective approach to discussing some of 
these indicators.

 During the current upturn of the housing cycle,

 Notes: Data are standardised so as to have zero mean and unit standard deviation 
from

 The rising demand for housing has been supported by developments in income 
and financing conditions.
 The current euro area housing upturn has b
een accompanied by an expansion in real disposable income. In addition, financing 
conditions remained favourable, 
as 
reflected in composite bank lending rates for 
house purchase that have 
declined
 by more than
 130 basi
s points since 2013 and by 
easing cred
it standards. This 
has given
 rise to 
a higher demand for loans for house 
purchase and a substantial strengthening in new mortgage lending (
see 
Chart
 5). The 
expansion in loans for house purchases net of repayments 
has been
 rather
 moderate
 and thus suggests
 that the upturn in the housing market came with more moderate 
increases in mortgage indebtedness. However, gross loan origination suggest
s, at the 
same time
, that the actual availability of credit for the purpose of purchasing and 
building houses 
is more 
than 
ample.
88 In this respect, the growth in mortgage loan 
origination in the euro area has been more synchronised with 
the growth
 in house 
prices. From a cross
-country perspective, loan origination is currently at historical 
highs in Germany and France, cl
ose to its historical average in Italy, while it remains 
subdued in Spain.

 Housing demand is likely to have been supported also by investment motives.
 The relative attractiveness of housing as an investment class has increased during the 
recent housing upturn. Estimates of the return on housing
-related investment are 
surrounded by considerable uncertainty but suggest an increase in 
the 
relative 
attracti
veness of investment in residential property vis
-à-vis alternative asset 
classes
 Œ such as government bonds, deposits and equities
 Œ since 2013 (see 
Chart
 6).89 Private and institutional investors, both domestically and globally based, 
searching for yield m
ay thus have contributed to additional housing demand.
90 One 
expression of this search is portfolio reallocation and flows into real estate funds
, which have increased steadily for the euro area as a whole since the beginning of 
2013, also as a share of res
idential investment (
see 
Chart
 7). While too small in terms 
of size to account for substantial shifts in overall demand for real estate properties 
(some of which could also be directed to commercial real estate or outside the euro 
area jurisdictions)
, thes
e funds can nevertheless indicate additional housing demand 
for investment purposes.
                                                                     89  The first estimate
 Œ the gross rental yield
 Œ is computed as the ratio of actual and imputed rents over the 
gross housing capital stock and is meant to be a broad, macroeconomic measure of rental yield. The 
second estimate of housing return is from the MSCI
 Quarterly Research 
Database and reflect
s residential property portfolios for institutional investors. These portfolios are likely to invest predominantly 
in the prime or close
-to-prime market, a sector which is likely to have a different dynamic 
from the entire 
residential 
market; this estimate is therefore narrower in scope.
 90  See Chapter
 3 of the IMF™s 
Global Financial Stability Report
, April
 2018, documenting an increase in real 
estate investments by private equity firms and real estate investment trusts in advanced econ
omies.
 This 
is also supported by the considerable increase in the size of the professionally managed real estate 
investment market globally and in several euro area countries in 2017, with the German market replacing 
China as the fourth largest market glob
ally. For a discussion, see ﬁReal Estate Market Size

 2  Explaining homeownership ratios making use of micro data
 Prepared by Julien Le Roux
 The degree of homeownership can be a 
structural factor determining housing demand and 
thus house price dynamics.
 For instance, wealth effects associated with owning a house can 
stimulate economic growth and thereby house prices. Moreover, homeowners can use capital gains 
to ﬁtrade upﬂ in the 
housing market, thus enhancing house price dynamics. The higher the 
homeownership ratio, the more potential there may be for increasing the dynamics, volatility and 
excessiveness of house price dynamics. An indicative although causally not exhausting relat
ionship 
is that existing between the level of the homeownership ratio and the average growth in house prices 
across euro area countries (see Chart
 A).This box investigates the main determinants of 
homeownership making use of micro data.
                                                                     91  Monnet, E

measured when looking only at
 the evolution of the age group relevant for household formation, all other 
age groups being held constant.

-axis: annual average of nominal house price changes over the period 2000
-17)
 Sources: EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU

ations.
 Notes: Changes in homeownership appear to be a slow
-moving process: from 2010 to 2016, the ownership rate decreased from 66.8% to 66.4% at the euro area 
level. Thus, looking only at the level of ownership appears to be still meaningful.
 Results of 
the Household Finance and Consumption Survey indicate that both 
household
-specific and structural characteristics are important drivers of homeownership.
92 They indicate that the probability of owning the main residence is positively linked to the age of th
e households, to having previously received inheritances, to being married and having children, and to 
net wealth. In addition, households that experienced higher aggregate consumer price inflation in the 
past are more likely to own their home. This also h
olds when considering aggregate house price 
inflation and can be reconciled with a desire to hedge against inflation and acquire real assets. 
Furthermore, low real mortgage interest rates experienced in the past are also a driver of ownership, 
but only amo
ng households that experienced the highest cost of borrowing. All in all, these results are 
broadly consistent with findings in the literature.
93 Overall, micro data can be usefully employed in the analysis of housing developments, as 
they provide 
complementary information to macro data.
 This is typically the case the more house 
price dynamics have been affected by structural factors. While conjunctural factors can be sufficiently 
assessed with aggregate indicators, as presented in Sections
 2 and 3 
of this article, structural 
characteristics are better explored on the basis of micro data. Among the structural characteristics of 
the housing market is homeownership, a preference that is important to understand for assessing 
housing market prospects. In
 the coming years, as the population gets older and past experiences of 
macroeconomic conditions move
 over time
, shifts in ownership across countries might occur, 
spawning effects on housing markets.
                                                                     92  The

 Supply factors
 This section analyses how the volume of houses has evolved in recent years and the 
extent to 
which there are factors which constrain housing supply.
 Housing completions in the euro area have remained substantially below their 
average level since the start of monetary union.
 This indicator can be viewed as a 
measure of the flow of new houses suppli
ed to the market. In Germany and France 
this flow has recently been close to 
the
 average levels observed since the start of 
monetary union, whereas in Spain, Italy and
, to a lesser extent
, the Netherlands it 
has

 The lack of building permits can be a constraint to housing supply.
 In central 
locations and cities

 the number of issued permits may fall short of actual 
demand due to the scarcity of building land. A relatively low number of permits then 
pose a constraint on the supply of new homes. In central locations

 Survey data on the percentage of construction firms

a lack of workers suggest that labour

 Note
s: A number of the observations are negative due to seasonal adjustment of the data. These observations are shown to illustrat
e the 
true evolution of 
labour shortages.
 Labour shortages may affect the prices in the housing market in different ways.
 On the one hand, shortages may lead to gradually higher wages in the construction 
sector
, which, in a situation of sufficient demand, will then be passed thro
ugh to 
construction output prices. On the other hand, shortages may constrain or delay the 
supply of new houses in relation to demand and then imply a rise in house prices that 
does not necessarily come with higher construction output prices. Thus far, the
 marked rise in construction costs since 2014 has been increasingly fuelled by rising 
labour costs (despite their lower weight in the overall index), indicating growing labour 
shortages, and has been accompanied by strong momentum in house price growth, 
signalling buoyant demand (

 3.3
 The relative importance
 of housing demand and supply
 Assessing the relative importance of housing demand and supply factors is 
intrinsically challenging
, as data mainly refer to equilibrium outcomes.
 For 
example, rising house prices may reflect an increase in demand for housing or a 
reduced supply of houses. With this caveat in mind, this subsection reviews available 
survey evidence and model
-based results to assess the relative contribution of supply
 and demand factors 
to
 the state of euro area housing markets.
 Survey data point to an increasing relative importance of supply factors in 
determining the dynamics of prices and investment in the housing market.
 The 
proportion of construction firms
97 indica
ting constraints to their production has 
hovered between 50% and 60% since 2014. However, the composition between 
reported demand
-side and supply
-side constraints has varied significantly: the share 
of firms reporting insufficient demand as a factor limiti
ng production has decreased 
substantially, with opposite developments for 
firms
 reporting supply
-side constraints 
(see 
Chart
 13). Recently, 
there has been 
approximately
 a 10-perc
entage point 
increase in the number
 of respondents not
ing
 supply
-side
 rather t
han demand
-side
 constraints limiting production. This suggests that constraints on construction 
producers™ output 
have recently 
mainly c
ome from the supply side. This evidence is 
confirmed through the lenses of a 
stylised 
model with residential investment 
and house prices (
see 
Box
 3).                                                                     97  The European 
Commission™s Construction Survey sample also includes firms that operate in commercial 
real estate and civil engineering. However, as the factors affecting output in the residential construction 
sector are similar to those affecting the construction sector
 as a whole, the survey is informative of factors 
affecting production in the residential real estate sector.

demand nor no constraints (i.e.

the 
percentage of respondents reporting insufficient demand).
 The relative importance of housing demand and supply factors can also be 
assessed 
by means of
 information 
concerning
 the composition of h
ouse 
prices.
 The more demand 
outpaces
 supply
, the more prices of existing 
dwellings
 should be expected to rise as the competition for housing extends to existing 
properties. Whether 
the 
prices

 rise faster than those of new

 also 
naturally depends on whether there are bottlenecks in the supply of 
new

 and on the responsiveness of construction output prices. It is thus 
conceivable that 
the 
prices of existing 
dwellings
 reach 
a larger amplitude at the peaks 
of the cycle c
ompared 
with
 the 
prices of new

. Indeed, over recent years, the 
contribution of prices of existing

 to overall house price growth 
has risen 
sharply

 Œ but on a declining path
 Œ over the last year (
see 
Chart
 14). At 
the same time, the increase in the contribution of prices of new 
dwellings
 since late 
2016 (although still subdued) may confirm a tightening housing market
, with 
increasingly binding supply
-side constraints: amid buoyant housing demand, new 
dwellings
 cannot be provided fast enough and their prices tend to rise more rapidly.

 The analysis presented in this section suggests an increasing role for 
supply
-side constraints in determining dynamics in the euro area housing 
market.
 During the early sta
ge of the upturn, a significant positive adjustment in 
residential investment was accompanied by relatively smaller house price increases. 
Over the most recent quarters, as the upturn in the housing market continues, buoyant 
demand amid increasing supply c
onstraints has been associated with moderating 
residential investment growth and continued rising growth in house prices.
 Box
 3  The relative importance of demand and supply factors in driving housing market 
developments
 Prepared by Kyriacos Lambrias
 Indiv
idual indicators of demand and supply factors can be inconclusive about their relative 
importance in driving residential investment and house prices.
 This relative importance can be 
better captured, assessed and quantified through the lenses of economic mo
dels. This box presents 
a rather stylised, two
-variable Bayesian Vector Auto
-Regression (BVAR) model with residential 
investment and house prices. The relative importance of supply and demand factors is assessed by 
identifying demand and supply shocks and 
by 
measuring their relative contribution in driving 
fluctuations in these two variables. This practice
 Œ typically referred to as historical decomposition
 Œ is 
rather standard in the empirical economics literature. Shocks are identified by imposing (sign) 
restrictions to the reaction of the underlying variables in response to these shocks: a demand shock 
leads to a positive co
-movement between residential investment and house prices, and a supply 
shock to a negative co
-movement.
98 Naturally, this identificat
ion restriction is rather general and 
                                                                    98  Restrictions are imposed for four periods (one year).

 The state of the housing market in the euro area
 92 encompasses a rather broad range of ﬁdemand shocksﬂ and ﬁsupply shocksﬂ but illustrates a 
possibility to disentangle supply and demand ﬁforcesﬂ, broadly defined.
99 In the interpretation of the model, demand is the main driver of aggregate movements in the 
housing market.
 The relative importance can be assessed in terms of ﬁforecast error variance 
decompositionﬂ, where demand shocks explain approximately 65% of the movements in resid
ential 
investment and as much as 80% of those in house prices.
 Consistent with the overall dominance of demand factors in driving the housing cycle,
 model 
evidence suggests that demand buoyancy has more than compensated for lacklustre supply 
in the housing
 sector over the last few years.
 On the 
volume
 side, residential investment growth 
has been growing positively and above average since the third quarter of 2015. According to the 
BVAR model, during this period residential investment growth has been supported by both supply and 
demand shocks, 
turning
 positive following a long period of subdued demand that dates back to the 
Great Recession (see Chart
 A, left
-hand panel). On the 
price
 side, house prices have been increasing 
above average since 2016. 
As with
 the volume
 side, this reflects primarily a strong positive 
contribution from demand factors, which turned positive, having persistently contributed to lower 

house prices since the second quarter of 2008 (see Chart
 A, right
-hand panel). Strong demand over 
thi
s period has outweighed positive supply
-side developments that have otherwise contributed to 
lower house
-price growth. Finally, focusing on developments over this last year, the relative 
contribution of supply factors to both residential investment and hou
se-price growth has been steadily 
decreasing, whereas the relative importance of demand factors has increased. This evidence is 

consistent with the presence of increasing supply
-side bottlenecks and demand
-side momentum 
behind the expansion of the housing cycle at the current juncture.

For example, the broad category of demand shocks in the context of this simple model would also include 
monetary policy shocks and government spen
ding shocks, e.g.
 incentives to families to buy a house. 
Supply shocks, on the other hand, would encompass, inter alia, oil
-price shocks, which would contribute 
to higher production costs, as well as labour
-supply shocks, e.g.
 changes in collective agreeme
nts 
between employers and trade unions active in the sector. A more elaborate model would be needed to 

further disentangle these broadly defined categories.

 The state of the housing market in the euro area
 93 4 
Conclusions
 The euro area housing market has been in an upturn since the end of 2013 and 
is in a relatively advanced state of the cycle in terms of duration.
 House prices 
have surpassed their pre
-crisis peaks, while residential investment is still significantl
y below. The
 state of the euro area housing market is, so far, not characterised by 

generalised investment activity or house price levels above their fundamentals. 
However, considerable heterogeneity in developments across and within countries 
makes the overall assessment more challenging.
 The housing market upturn is expected to continue but 
at a more 
moderate 
pace
. This reflects expectations in currently available forecasts and projections that 
the euro area economic expansion will continue, reflecting the favourable impact of 
the very accommodative stance of monetary policy, improving labour market 
conditions and stronger balance sheets. This context generates income and financing 
conditions conducive to housing demand. Lending to households for house pur
chase 
is also expected to remain dynamic in the coming years. Nevertheless, in line with the 
expected slowdown in the pace of economic activity, the rate of expansion in the 
housing market is also expected to moderate. A moderation in residential investmen
t 

might also emerge from the increasing presence of supply
-side constraints in some 
euro area countries, which may currently be more binding than in the 
respective 
economies
 as a whole. These constraints could however mitigate the envisaged 
moderation in house prices.
 Monitoring a broad set of housing
-related indicators is key to assess
ing
 the 
macroeconomic and macroprudential implications of the housing market.
 To 
fully assess the state of the housing market it is necessary to look at both the major 

demand
 and supply determinants and their interactions. Moreover, given the extended 
interactions between real and financial variables, a broader set of indicators
 Œ 
some of 
which were discussed in this article
 Œ 
that
 goes beyond house prices and residential 
inve
stment (such as loan developments, house price valuation, household balance 
sheets, etc.) should be continuously monitored to fully understand the macroeconomic 
and macroprudential implications of the ongoing housing upturn.
