FOREWORD
Economic growth in Europe has peaked in 2017. The European economy grew at its fastest pace in a
decade last year, but growth has moderated since and the outlook is now less favourable. Barring major
shocks, GDP should continue to grow at a moderate pace. The road ahead is however fraught with
uncertainty and numerous, interconnected risks.
Last year’s exceptionally benign global environment helped to underpin economic activity and
investment in the euro area. Although economic momentum has softened this year, mostly as a result of
weaker external trade, domestic demand growth has remained sufficiently strong to support robust job
creation. Over the next two years we expect GDP in the euro area to decelerate in line with a further
slowing momentum of foreign trade as the global economy has entered more choppy waters.
Domestically, the pick-up in inflation will weigh on household real income growth even though wages
are finally increasing more visibly. The emergence of labour supply shortages in some Member States
will make it more difficult to maintain the current pace of job creation over the coming years. However
the euro area economy does not display real signs of overheating that could put an untimely end to
growth. All in all, this is still a benign projection in which GDP growth gradually eases towards potential
and the unemployment rate falls further.
That said, some of the risks identified earlier are materialising, e.g. trade tensions or turmoil in emerging
markets. Further downside risks are growing and interconnected; they could lead to a significantly worse
outcome than projected. Trade tensions continue to run high, even though so far they mostly concern USChina trade. Should extensive new tariff and non-tariff barriers emerge and spread, the negative impact
on international trade and global growth would be sizeable. In a context of high corporate leverage, a
combination of tighter-than-expected US monetary policy and an abrupt unwinding of the fiscal stimulus
in 2020 could well provoke a brisk slowdown in the US that would spill over and weaken economic
growth prospects in many parts of the world, including Europe. Many financial assets look vulnerable to a
reversal of investor risk perceptions. A general and sharp retreat from risky assets would be detrimental to
highly-indebted firms in advanced and emerging market economies and cause broader spillovers. In
Europe, uncertainty about the outlook for public finances in Italy has led to higher interest spreads, and
the interaction of sovereign debt with the banking sector is still of concern. Finally, the risk of a no-deal
Brexit would entail abrupt changes in trade relations between the UK and the EU after April 2019 and
harm the economies on both sides of the Channel. Under any scenario, the impact is expected to be much
larger on the UK than on the EU27.
These risks could reinforce one another. Addressing them requires policy action on three fronts. At the
global level, there is a need to improve the rules-based multilateral order that has underpinned world trade
so far and that has, in particular through the G20, contributed to strengthening international financial and
macroeconomic stability. In Europe, decisive progress needs to be made on EMU deepening, in particular
through the completion of the Banking Union, to reduce uncertainty and enhance financial stability.
Economic policy at this juncture needs to focus on strengthening fundamentals and enhancing resilience
to less favourable circumstances. We need to continue to frontload reforms that foster potential growth
and resilience and at the same time improve the equality of opportunity for all. The EU can facilitate
structural reform, but the bulk of the effort must inevitably come from national authorities. Member
States, particularly those with high debt levels, need to run prudent fiscal policies to ensure the
sustainability of public finances and re-build policy space while prioritising expenditures that increase
fairness and medium-term growth prospects.

OVERVIEW:

LESS DYNAMIC GROWTH AMID HIGH
UNCERTAINTY
Interrelated external and domestic risks are clouding
the outlook

The European
economy has moved
into lower gear…

The EU economy is entering its sixth year of uninterrupted growth and all
Member States are expected to grow over the forecast horizon. But the
moderation of momentum since the start of the year and leading indicators
both suggest that economic growth has peaked in 2017. The extraordinary
impulse from the rebound in global growth and trade enjoyed by the
European economy last year is already wearing off, as the outlook for global
growth is weakening and trade tensions have risen.

…amid still robust
domestic
fundamentals.

The strength of Europe’s domestic growth drivers should however be
sufficient to allow activity to continue growing and unemployment falling.
The improving labour market, slightly stronger wage growth and
expansionary fiscal measures in some Member States, should help to sustain
consumption next year. In addition, investment should enjoy the continued
support of still favourable financing conditions, even assuming the gradual
normalisation of monetary policy. The outlook, however, is clouded by the
presence of a number of interrelated downside risks.

GDP growth is set to
continue at a slower
pace.

From 2.4% in 2017, euro area GDP growth is forecast to moderate to 2.1%
this year and 1.9% in 2019, slightly below the growth rate projected back in
the summer. It is then expected to ease smoothly to 1.7% in 2020. Exogenous
factors, such as fading world trade growth, rising uncertainty and higher oil
prices should have a dampening effect on growth in general, while economic

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

activity should also weaken as labour market improvements slow, slack
diminishes, and supply side constraints become more binding in certain
Member States.

2

Global growth
increasingly diverges
as some risks partly
materialised…

After rising in synchronised fashion, GDP growth across the world is set to
become more divergent, especially within emerging markets, as previously
identified risks related to trade protectionism and financial vulnerabilities in
emerging markets have begun to materialise. Global growth, however, is
forecast to remain robust in the near-term as economic activity in advanced
economies will benefit from buoyant momentum in the US boosted by a procyclical fiscal stimulus, strong labour markets and sentiment. Over the next
two years, GDP growth in advanced economies (excluding the EU) is
expected to moderate, as the economic cycle matures and less support comes
from monetary and fiscal policies. In the US, the positive effect of the fiscal
stimulus in 2019 is set to be partly offset by the negative effect of higher
tariffs, and GDP growth is now expected to be moderately weaker than
forecast in the spring.

…and the outlook is
for a deceleration
next year…

Global growth (excluding the EU) is now forecast to peak at 4.0% this year
before settling down to rest at 3.8% in both 2019 and 2020. This downward
revision since the spring, particularly for next year, is largely due to a
deterioration in the growth outlook for a number of emerging market
economies, which have been hit by tightening financial conditions,
geopolitical tensions and domestic policy uncertainty. Rising oil prices cast
an additional shadow on the outlook for oil importers but imply an
improvement for several oil-exporting countries. Recent US tariff measures
are expected to dent China’s GDP growth, although their impact should be
partly offset by domestic macroeconomic policy measures.

…surrounded by
acute downside risks…

Under the central scenario, economic growth in the US is expected to fall
gently below the economy’s estimated potential growth rate in 2020. It also
assumes the absence of a further escalation of trade disputes beyond the
measures already adopted and firmly announced. Finally, it assumes that
financial markets will continue to differentiate between emerging markets,
thus containing broader contagion. These benign assumptions, however,
imply that the global growth outlook is subject to significant downside risks.

…while global trade is
set to ease more
markedly amid rising
trade tensions.

Global trade growth is expected to decrease markedly over the forecast
horizon in light of weakening global activity and trade tensions. Having
peaked at 5.5% last year, non-EU world import growth began losing
momentum in the first half of the year and is expected to slow to 4.8% this
year and 4.0% in 2019 (about ¼ and ½ percentage points below what was
expected back in the spring). It is forecast to ease further to 3.7% in 2020,
amid lower trade in investment goods as the boost to investment from the US
stimulus package diminishes and the Chinese economy moves further away
from investment-led to consumption-driven growth.

Financial market
sentiment has
softened…

In recent months, increased trade tensions and rising global interest rates,
driven mainly by the rapid pace of monetary tightening in the US and
somewhat lower than expected corporate earnings, have weighed on financial
market sentiment. Stock markets have recently fallen in Europe, the US and
Asia, while global benchmark bond yields are more mixed, still on the rise in
the US and little changed elsewhere.

Overview

…while there is so far
no contagion from
higher Italian yields.

European equity indices have trended downward mainly due to concerns
related to US trade policy and the turmoil in some emerging economies. The
European banking sector has underperformed as a result of shocks, including
the crisis in Turkey, money laundering scandals and the increase in Italian
yields. The outlook for public finances in Italy has pushed Italian sovereign
yield spreads significantly higher in recent months. So far, no contagion to
other Member States has been observed.

The euro strengthened
against emerging
market currencies…

The euro has appreciated slightly in nominal effective terms in recent months
due to a strengthening against a range of emerging market currencies. At the
same time, it has weakened rather substantially against the US dollar,
reflecting the different pace of monetary policy normalisation as well as
uncertainty related to trade tensions. The euro’s nominal effective exchange
rate is assumed to appreciate by about 5% on average this year and by
another 0.6% next year.

…and market-based
funding costs slightly
increased.

Net lending to households and non-financial corporations (NFCs) in the euro
area is expected to continue increasing over the forecast horizon under the
combined effect of relatively supportive bank credit conditions and strong
demand. However, in most Member States, financing costs for NFCs have
risen slightly from very low levels in recent months, reflecting higher
corporate bond yields and lower equity prices. Financing costs have risen the
most in Italy due to substantial increases in market-based funding costs.

Domestic demand
should be the main
driver of growth…

Lower momentum in the first half of this year compared to 2017 is largely
attributable to the lack of contribution of net trade to growth. With external
demand set to weaken further, GDP growth in Europe will depend mainly on
domestic fundamentals.

…with private
consumption
increasingly fuelled by
wages rather than by
job creation…

Private consumption growth also moderated in the first half of the year, in
line with decreasing consumer confidence. It is however forecast to remain a
main growth driver supported by solid fundamentals. Labour markets should
continue to improve, with wage increases contributing more towards
household nominal disposable income growth than rising employment. Low
interest rates should also help to sustain asset prices and household wealth.
However, the increase in inflation is set to have a dampening effect on
household purchasing power this year and next. Overall, private consumption
in the euro area is forecast to increase this year by 1.6%, the same pace as last
year, and to pick up to 1.8% in 2019 partly due to fiscal measures in some
Member States. In 2020, as lower inflation should offset the impact of a
further moderation in the pace of job creation, private consumption is set to
fall back to 1.6%.

…and investment set
to be dampened by
fading external
demand…

Last year’s exceptionally benign global environment helped support
investment in the euro area, which continued to grow significantly faster than
GDP in the first half of 2018. Still favourable financing conditions, high rates
of capacity utilisation in manufacturing and a positive earnings outlook are
set to continue to support equipment investment. However, in a context of
strong linkages between exports and the business investment, rising trade
tensions and trade policy uncertainty have started to dent business sentiment,
which combined with growing supply constraints should entail a moderation
in the next two years. Residential investment should be supported by the
continued dynamism in real house prices and positive income prospects. Yet
with the expected steepening of the yield curve, new mortgages should
progressively become somewhat more costly and make alternative

3

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

investments relatively more attractive. Overall, investment in the euro area is
projected to lose some momentum over the forecast horizon.

4

…which should lead
to a neutral
contribution of net
trade to growth…

In the first half of 2018, the growth of euro area exports was less than half the
average pace of the previous year. In line with the weaker outlook for global
trade, and the lagged impact of the euro's past appreciation, expectations for
euro area exports have been lowered significantly since the spring, although
in some Member States this also reflects the reality of more binding supply
constraints. As a result, net trade, which made a sizeable contribution to
growth in 2017, is projected to contribute less this year before turning neutral
in 2019 and 2020.

…and a decline of the
euro area current
account surplus.

The euro area’s current account surplus (as a percentage of GDP) peaked in
2017 and is set to recede somewhat this year before settling down to around
3.6% in 2019 and 2020. The main contributors to the surplus remain
Germany and the Netherlands but their combined share is expected to
decline, as smaller euro area Member States are forecast to add increasingly
to the aggregate surplus.

Labour market slack
has meaningfully
receded…

Labour market conditions in the euro area continued to improve in the first
half of 2018 with employment improving steadily despite the slower pace of
growth. The unemployment rate continued to fall while the decline in broader
measures of underemployment (e.g. involuntary part-time work) suggests that
slack has also been reduced further and that the pool of further potential
workers is shrinking. The situation in individual Members States, however,
continues to differ significantly. Over the next two years, employment
creation should continue to benefit from the economic growth as well as
structural reforms and specific policy measures in some countries. Yet job
creation is projected to be dampened by increasing labour shortages and the
more moderate pace of economic growth. Net job creation in the euro area is
projected to slow from 1.4% in 2018 to 1.1% in 2019 and 0.9% in 2020. This
slowdown, combined with almost steady growth in the labour force, means
that the unemployment rate is likely to fall less than in previous years.

…but the passthrough of higher
wages to inflation is
set to be only gradual.

Euro area headline inflation rose slightly above 2% in the third quarter of
2018, driven mainly by the rise in energy prices. As oil prices are assumed to
peak in the last quarter of this year before falling marginally, strong positive
base effects are expected for up to the first quarter of 2019. Despite some
pick up in wage growth, core inflation, which excludes energy and
unprocessed food prices, has been rather muted so far this year. The passthrough of higher wage growth into underlying price pressures is expected to
be gradual and to take longer than previously expected. Over the course of
the next two years, however, core inflation is expected to become the main
driver of headline inflation, as labour markets progressively tighten further,
wages rise more strongly and the output gap remains positive. Due to the
upward revision of assumed oil prices, the forecast for euro area headline
inflation in 2018 and 2019 has been revised up to 1.8%. It is then expected to
recede to 1.6% in 2020, reflecting also the expected further slowdown in
activity.

The reduction in the
euro area headline
deficit should come to
a halt next year…

The euro area's general government deficit as a share of GDP is projected to
decline further in 2018 thanks to a reduction in interest expenditure but its
decline is set to come to a halt next year for the first time since 2009 due to
looser discretionary fiscal policies. The euro area's general government
deficit is expected to increase from 0.6% of GDP in 2018 to 0.8% in 2019
and to decline to 0.7% in 2020, based on a no-policy-change assumption.

Overview

Debt-to-GDP ratios are projected to fall in almost all Member States. In the
euro area, the deleveraging is supported by a debt-decreasing primary surplus
as well as nominal GDP growth outpacing the interest rate paid on
outstanding debt. Based on a no-policy-change assumption, the euro area
debt-to-GDP ratio is set to fall to 82.8% in 2020.
…as the euro area
aggregate fiscal
stance is set to turn
slightly expansionary.

The fiscal policy stance for the euro area, as measured by the change in the
structural balance, is expected to turn slightly expansionary in 2019. The
assumed gradual monetary policy normalisation by the ECB, continued
growth and strengthening core inflation should combine to add some upward
pressure on nominal rates over the forecast horizon. Nonetheless, real short
and long-term rates should remain clearly negative.

Downside risks to the
outlook are rising and
interconnected

The EU economy is facing a very high level of uncertainty, mainly with
respect to economic and trade policies in the US. At the same time, the
downside risks surrounding the central scenario are highly interconnected.
The materialisation of any of these risks could amplify the others and
magnify their impact on the EU economy.
Overheating in the US fuelled by the sizeable pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus
could result in a faster-than-assumed monetary tightening that could alter the
risk attitude of investors with detrimental effects to the US economy, given
the high level of corporate leverage. This would also affect emerging market
economies where financial turmoil and reverse capital flows could spill over
more widely than they have so far. This would impact negatively on growth
and financial stability in advanced economies as well. As a relatively open
economy with strong trade links and banks exposed to emerging markets, the
EU would suffer. Additionally, the expected deterioration of the US current
account could lead to a further escalation of trade disputes. This could
particularly hit China with its relatively high and rising corporate debt that is
increasing financial fragilities. More globally, a further escalation of trade
tensions would sharply and more permanently increase uncertainty, weigh on
confidence, investment, global trade and global growth. Given its high
integration in global value chains, Europe would be particularly vulnerable to
such external shocks.
The materialisation of any of these risks is more likely to occur in 2020. An
abrupt end to fiscal stimulus in the US in 2020 could lead to a sharper
slowdown in the US with spillovers to its major trade partners (including the
EU), while Chinese authorities’ attempt to shore up growth could increase
debt and heighten the risk of a disorderly adjustment.
In some high-debt euro area countries, most notably Italy, disruptive
sovereign-bank loops could also re-emerge in case of doubts about the
quality and sustainability of public finances, which in an environment of
overall risk repricing and increasing financing costs, could raise financial
stability concerns and weigh on economic activity. Finally, risks related to
the outcome of the Brexit negotiations also remain. In case of a no deal
scenario, the impact is expected to be much larger on the UK than on the
EU27 overall.

EA and EU outlook

LESS DYNAMIC GROWTH AMID HIGH UNCERTAINTY
Interrelated external and domestic risks are clouding the outlook
The EU economy is entering a period of less dynamic expansion after five years of continuing growth. A
high degree of uncertainty and interrelated external and domestic risks are clouding the economic
outlook. After shifting down a gear from 2017’s record levels in the first quarter in 2018, economic
growth held steady in the second quarter. This reflects the lower, but by historical standards, still high
readings of survey indicators and the favourable labour market situation, which has allowed the euro
area unemployment rate to fall to levels last seen about a decade ago. While wages have picked up
somewhat in the first half of the year, headline inflation in the euro area remains mainly driven by
developments in energy prices.
With global growth set to slow and become less synchronous, economic activity in Europe will come to
depend almost entirely on the fundamentals behind private consumption and investment: continued
employment growth; favourable financing conditions; rising profitability; and the steady outlook for
domestic demand. In the near term, economic growth is expected to continue at about the same pace as
in the first half of the year, resulting in euro area growth of 2.1% in 2018. The waning momentum of
foreign trade due to weakening global economic activity and growing trade tensions, slower
employment growth and increased uncertainty impacting on investment, are factors behind less dynamic
growth forecast in the coming two years. Increasingly binding supply constraints and diminishing
tailwinds from favourable financing conditions are further factors that suggest less dynamic growth in
2019 and in 2020, when euro area GDP is forecast to expand by 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively. With oil
prices falling slightly towards the end of the forecast horizon, domestic price pressures should gradually
take over as main determinants of headline inflation. Economic growth is set to remain sufficient to
gradually diminish remaining pockets of slack in the labour market and slowly push up core inflation
via a pick-up in wage growth. Overall, HICP inflation in the euro area is projected to rise from 1.5% in
2017 to 1.8% in 2018 and in 2019 before moderating to 1.6% in 2020.
The balance of risks to the growth outlook is tilted to the downside. Interrelated external and domestic
risks are clouding a rather benign economic outlook. Such risks are more likely to materialise in full
force in 2020. An overheating in the US fuelled by a pro-cyclical fiscal stance could result in a fasterthan-assumed monetary tightening by the Fed, which could alter the risk attitude of investors with
detrimental effects to the US economy given the high level of corporate leverage, and to emerging
market economies, resulting in negative spillovers to advanced economies. The deterioration of the
current account in an overheating US economy could also lead to a further escalation of trade disputes.
This could particularly hit China with its relative high and rising corporate debt that is increasing
financial fragilities. Attempts to shore up growth via domestic policies could raise debt and further
heighten the risk of a disorderly adjustment. Such shocks would negatively impact global trade and
activity, and disrupt cross-border supply chains. As a relatively open economy with strong trade links
and banks exposed to emerging markets, the EU would suffer. Disruptive sovereign-bank loops could
also re-emerge in some high-debt euro area countries, which in an environment of risk repricing and
increasing financing costs, could raise financial stability concerns.

PUTTING
THE
FORECAST
PERSPECTIVE: TRADE

INTO

The euro area’s substantial openness to trade
allowed net exports to act as a cyclical buffer
during the crisis. Similarly, the euro area economy
has benefitted from the recent acceleration in
global activity and trade. With global growth now
expected to slow and trade tensions on the rise,
however, euro area growth is likely to feel a chill.
This introductory section examines the euro area’s
trade linkages with the rest of the world and their
bearing on the business cycle. It argues that the
integration in global value chains has increased the
exposure to partners outside the EU beyond what
gross export and import trade figures suggest.
Model simulations highlight the transmission of
global developments to domestic demand. Finally,
the impact of the trade restricting measures so far
adopted between the US and China is analysed and
compared to the impact of a generalised increase in
protectionism.
The golden era of global trade…

Over the past few decades trade has become
increasingly important for the global economy.
This has been facilitated by a conducive trade and
investment policy environment, the integration of
China into the world economy and several waves
of EU enlargement. Broad-based liberalisation
coupled with technological advances that pushed
down transport and communication costs, fuelled
relocation of manufacturing and led to the
proliferation of regional and global value chains.
Consequently, global trade grew steadily and
increased its share of global GDP threefold from
around 10% in the early 1960s to over 30% in the
run-up to the economic and financial crisis of 2008
(see Graph I.3).

and roughly four times higher than the
corresponding share for the US (Graph I.3). While
caution is needed when making such direct
comparisons due to the weight of intra-EU trade in
the euro area aggregate, an outsize share of exports
in its GDP is a testimony to the importance of
trade for euro area economies.

for

area

Given its high openness to trade, it is unsurprising
that trade developments have a substantial bearing
on the euro-area business cycle as well as its trend
GDP growth. The direct contribution from net
exports for instance was instrumental to euro area
growth during the early 2000s, as global demand
provided a much-needed cushion to the collapse in
domestic demand, and subsequently during the
euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2011-2013. More
recently, net exports staged a strong cyclical
revival in 2017 when an investment-driven
rebound in world trade benefitted EU exporters
and contributed three-quarters of a percentage
point to euro area GDP growth (see Graph I.4).

…supported by a marked rise in EU openness.

EU Member States played an active part in this
process, benefitting from the creation and
subsequent enlargements of the EU single market,
the introduction of the euro, and opportunities
created by the expansion of the manufacturing
base in China and other emerging markets. This
has driven the share of exports in euro area GDP
up from below 20% in early 1960s and 25% in the
early 1990s to over 45% in 2017, with roughly
two-thirds representing intra-EU trade. This is
more than double the analogous figure for China

EA and EU outlook

However, the importance of trade for the euro area,
(and for any other economy) goes far beyond the
direct contribution of net exports. Export demand
boosts investment, which in turn stimulates
imports, (1) thus setting in motion a positive and
self-reinforcing virtuous circle of investment,
consumption and trade. This benefit comes on top
of medium-to-long term gains linked to a wellestablished role of trade in spreading innovation,
boosting productivity and, ultimately, upgrading
economies’ long-term growth potential. (2) In fact,
a recent IMF cross-country analysis shows that a
one percentage point increase in trade openness
tends to raise real per capita income on average by
3% to 5% in the long run (even if this effect may
have been weakened by the financial crisis). (3) At
the same time, the distributional impact of trade
openness very much depends on accompanying
measures, including tax policy, education and
welfare systems.
Model analysis confirms that external demand
constitutes an important cyclical source of growth
and was a key factor behind the good performance
of the euro area economy in 2016 and 2017. With
world growth set to slow, this positive contribution
is now expected to turn negative. Simulations (4)
show that a one-percentage-point drop in world
demand dampens euro area GDP growth by
roughly half a percentage point. The effect on
investment growth is even stronger, with the
analogous shock to world demand slowing
investment growth by around ¾ of a percentage
point. (5)

Investment typically has the highest import content of all
GDP demand components, see for example M. Bussière, G.
Callegari, F. Ghironi, G. Sestieri, and N. Yamano (2013).
‘Estimating trade elasticities: Demand elasticities and the
trade collapse of 2008-09’. American Economic Journal:
Macroeconomics 5:3, pp. 118-51.
See e.g. OECD (2018). ‘Productivity and Jobs in a
Globalised World’.
Cerdeiro, D. and A. Komaromi (2017). ‘Trade and Income
in the Long Run: Are There Really Gains, and Are They
Widely Shared?’. IMF Working Paper 17/231.
Two models were used: (1) the GM General equilibrium,
multi-region structural macroeconomic model (see
Albonico, A., L. Calès, R. Cardani, O Croitorov, F Ferroni,
M Giovannini, S. Hohberger, B. Pataracchia, F. Pericoli, R.
Raciborski, M. Ratto, W. Roeger and L. Vogel (2017).
‘The Global Multi-Country Model (GM): an estimated
DSGE model for the euro area countries’. European
Commission, JRC Working Papers in Economics and
Finance 10) and (2) Large Bayesian VAR (Bańbura, M., D.
Giannone and M. Lenza (2014). ‘Conditional forecasts and
scenario analysis with vector autoregressions for large
cross-sections’. European Central Bank, ECB Working
Paper 1733).
Results are nevertheless sensitive to the nature of the shock
hitting the economy as well as its position in the cycle.

High integration in global value chains fostered
productivity but also increased Europe’s
vulnerability to external shocks

Gross data on imports and exports, however, do
not provide the full picture of trade integration and
the geographical distribution of added value. The
expansion of global value chains (GVC) in the two
decades preceding the economic and financial
crisis meant that increasingly, intermediate goods
crossed multiple borders before being consumed or
exported as a final good, boosting gross trade
flows amid a steady increase in the share of
intermediate goods in total trade.
European countries have been very active in the
process of international fragmentation of
production since the 1990s and Europe is now
among the regions most integrated in
manufacturing value chains, with much of this
coming from close intra-EU links. Based on some
standard metrics, such as import content of exports
or the share of re-exported intermediate goods in
imports, the importance of value chains for the
euro area economy has grown steadily in the last
two decades and is now well above Japan’s or the
United States’ and roughly comparable with that of
China (Graphs I.5 and I.6).

While a very high degree of participation in global
value chains has enabled euro area companies to
exploit comparative advantages down the
production chain, boosting productivity and
profits, it has also increased the exposure of
producers and exporters to developments in other
countries and regions. It made them more

disruptions (6), but also to changes in prices,
exchange rates, tariffs and non-tariff barriers.
Consequently, the current escalation of trade
tensions, so far largely contained to the US and
China, may impact the euro area economy
considerably more than a simple analysis of euro
area trade links with these two countries would
suggest.

Moreover, investigating the structure of euro area
exports based on value-added rather than on gross
flows reveals a higher relative importance of nonEU economies, such as China and the US. This is
so because tight supply chain integration within
the EU single market ‘nets out’ many EU/euro area
gross trade flows, leaving countries outside the
single market with a higher share of EU/euro area
value added exports. Notably, the EU accounted
for nearly two-thirds of all the euro area’s gross
exports in 2014, but only roughly one-half of
exported value added. This aspect of a high
participation in GVCs further increases the
exposure of the EU economy to developments in
third countries, including those currently affected
by rising trade tensions.
The trend of trade liberalisation has come to a
halt

Intense trade liberalisation in the early 1990s,
culminating in the Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the
creation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)
in 1995, and China’s accession to the organisation
in 2001, created a supportive environment in
which trade thrived amid ever-decreasing tariff and
non-tariff barriers. Import tariffs applied by

advanced economies were falling continuously
since the early 1990s until the early 2010s, with
the average tariff lowered from around 5% in the
early 1990s to around 2.5% in 2013. Reductions in
emerging markets were considerably sharper with
the average applied tariff reduced from nearly 40%
to around 8% over the same period. (7)
Average tariffs remained largely stable after the
economic and financial crisis but have started to
edge up in advanced economies in recent years.
Given the deadlock at the WTO following the
collapse of the Doha Development Round, trade
liberalisation efforts moved towards bilateral or
regional trade deals in the 2010s. Over the past
couple of years, however, the apparent shift in
sentiment against trade liberalisation and the rise
in anti-globalisation rhetoric have slowed trade
reforms and led to a sustained rise in non-tariff
barriers which increased six-fold between 2010
and 2016. (8) Recent WTO reports on G20 trade
measures (9), as well as Global Trade Alert (10)
confirm this trend, revealing a rising trend in
implementing trade-restricting measures by G20
countries and discriminatory state interventions,
respectively.
Recent shifts in US trade policy have started to
affect the outlook…

In this context, the recent shifts in US trade policy
add greatly to concerns over the future of trade
liberalisation. One of the first decisions of the
current US Administration was to withdraw from
the Trans-Pacific Partnership and trade talks with
the EU (Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership), as well as force a renegotiation of the
North American Free Trade Agreement under the
threat of withdrawal from the agreement. Trade
tensions escalated to new level in late 2017 and
early 2018. As of late October, the US imposed
tariffs on goods worth USD 306 bn or 13% of its
imports, and put an additional USD 268 bn under
review (see table I.1).

The macroeconomic impact of these measures
remains difficult to establish at this point. While
the goods affected so far represent around 2.5% of
world merchandise trade, the magnitude of the
impact and the list of countries affected may be
considerably larger once complex manufacturing
value chains are taken into account. Furthermore,
risks associated with a further escalation of trade
tensions are high, and relate closely to broader
concerns about the future of the multilateral and
rules-based trading system. If these were to
materialise, they would have the potential to
sharply and more permanently increase
uncertainty, weigh on confidence, investment,
trade and growth.
The European Commission’s QUEST model has
been used to assess the economic impact of two
scenarios. Scenario 1 takes into account all
imposed (and announced) tariffs enacted by 22
October, the cut-off date (see Table I.1).
Scenario 2 represents a hypothetical escalation in
trade tensions exemplified by a global multilateral
2pps. increase in tariffs by all countries (11). For
each scenario, simulations are made assuming (i) a
direct effect via the traditional channel of impact
(negative supply shock), (ii) impact via a
(11)

confidence channel (30 bp. increase in risk
premia), and (iii) impact via a confidence and
productivity channel, with the latter shock
proportional to the reduction in trade volumes.
Confidence and productivity shocks were
considered to supplement the simulation with more
realistic and complex channels of indirect impact.
They were chosen to mirror the increase in
uncertainty and risk associated with the tariff hikes
and current trade tensions that weigh on
investment and consumption decisions, and
eventually also on total factor productivity, leaving
permanent scars on potential growth.
Simulations show that the already implemented
tariffs have the potential to weigh on EU GDP in
the short term, with a negative impact of around
0.2 pps. in the first year (12), when confidence and
productivity shocks are taken into account. The
effect turns largely neutral in the long run, as
Europe benefits from trade diversion away from
the US and China; while lower prices, thanks to a
stronger euro, generate a positive supply shock. On
the other hand, the US and China, mired in a trade
conflict, unsurprisingly lose market shares and
experience a much more severe hit to their

Largely due to the appreciation of the EUR (as US and CN
currencies weaken reflecting falling demand for their
exports).

Except for EU countries that do not raise tariffs against one
another, but only against third countries.

to -0.2 pps. on impact, with the loss increasing to
roughly -⅓ pps. in the long run when all impact
channels are considered. The impact on the US and
rest of the world (RoW) economy is comparable,
while that on China is roughly double in size
compared to other regions, reaching 0.6 pps. in the
long run. Confidence and productivity effects are
quite significant in all cases (see Graph I.7).
All in all, as the escalation of trade tensions so far
remains largely contained to China and the US, it
is these countries that are expected to experience
the most negative impact on their economies
(scenario 1). However, should the tensions rise
further and spill over to other countries and
regions, affecting global trade flows more broadly,
the effect would be much more severe, entailing a
marked hit to global growth (scenario 2). These
findings are broadly in line with estimates by other
international institutions. For the October’s World
Economic Outlook, the IMF ran an equivalent
scenario to QUEST scenario 1 described above
and came to the conclusion that “the impact of the
tariffs that have been imposed to date is small, but
Even if the USD depreciation reflecting falling demand for
US exports, provides a temporary boost to the US economy
in the short term.

material, with the United States and China bearing
the brunt of the costs.” (14) The IMF warns,
however that, if tariffs are imposed on additional
products and the tit-for-tat continues, leading firms
to curtail investment and provoking global
financial tightening, the output losses could be
much deeper and more universally spread. (15) The
risk of reverting to protectionism has also been
emphasised by the World Bank. In its 2017
report (16), the authors show that “a worldwide
increase in tariffs up to legally allowed bound rates
coupled with an increase in the cost of traded
services would translate into annual global real
income losses of 0.8 pps. relative to the baseline
after three years”. (17) A full-blown trade conflict
would likely lead to raising tariffs beyond the
legally allowed bound rates, resulting in an even
larger welfare loss.
While model simulations such as described above
capture the various channels through which tariff
hikes may affect the real economy (including
confidence and productivity), the resulting
estimates should be treated as the lower bound of
the possible impact. This is so because the
channels considered may in fact turn out much
stronger, while other, unknown and unpredictable
negative feedback loops may emerge. This is very
likely given the sharp increase in the importance of
trade for the world economy in recent decades,

of the effects to an extent that is not yet clear at

A hit to trade and growth is also likely to provoke
various policy responses to counter the slowdown,
including in China where additional stimulus could
aggravate imbalances and financial instability
concerns. This would in turn further exacerbate the
balance of risks to the short to medium-term
outlook (see section I.10).
2.

EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

The outlook for global economic growth remains
robust in the near term but more uneven and much
less synchronised. Short-term economic activity in
advanced economies is benefitting from strong
growth in the US, which is expected to exceed
potential this year and next. The growth outlook
for emerging markets is weaker than in the spring
with significant divergence across countries and
regions. The outlook for emerging Asia is still
solid even though growth prospects in China have
slightly deteriorated due to recent US tariff
measures. Rising oil prices, as well as tighter
financing conditions, cast a shadow on the outlook
for oil importers. Growth prospects have
deteriorated sharply in several other emerging
markets, most notably in Argentina and Turkey, as
financing conditions have tightened and
geopolitical tensions have risen.
Amid high uncertainty, risks to the global growth
outlook are skewed to the downside and are
closely interconnected. In the US, the highly procyclical fiscal loosening risks overheating the
economy, which could trigger a faster-thanexpected tightening of financing conditions in the
US and globally, with negative repercussions for
the world economy. Rising leverage in the US
corporate sector and many emerging markets has
increased their vulnerability to higher interest
rates. Moreover, trade tensions have continued to
increase and further escalation would have a
material impact on growth and trade flows, not
only in the US and China, but also globally. Rising
trade protectionism also aggravates the longstanding risks of a disorderly adjustment in China.

Divergence in global growth becomes more
accentuated

Global growth remained robust overall in the first
half of 2018 but the performance of different
regions and countries has become increasingly
divergent. Moreover, some previously identified
risks related to trade protectionism and financial
vulnerabilities in emerging markets have started to
materialise. Global growth picked up slightly to
1.0% (q-o-q) in the second quarter of 2018 on the
back of stronger activity in the US, Japan and
emerging Asia. At the same time, growth in
several emerging markets outside Asia (e.g.
Argentina, Mexico and South Africa) fell short of
expectations.
Recent high frequency indicators signal a gradual
softening of global output growth as well as further
divergence across countries and regions. The
Global Composite PMI eased again in the third
quarter to a two-year low of 52.8 in September, on
the back of a moderate deceleration in both
advanced and emerging economies (see Graph I.3).
While global manufacturing PMIs have been
losing momentum since the beginning of this year,
reflecting broad-based softening in global output
and new export orders, service sector PMIs have
shown greater resilience and only began to
decelerate in the third quarter. Composite PMIs in
both advanced and emerging economies are now
around the levels seen in late 2016 but continue to
signal expansion.

emerging economies. Economic activity in
advanced economies will benefit from strong
growth momentum in the US in the near term and
then moderate over the forecast horizon. Growth in
emerging markets as a whole is expected to remain
broadly stable over the forecast horizon but to
show greater divergence across countries and
regions. The recent tightening of financial
conditions, currency turmoil, as well as
geopolitical developments, have led to significant
downward revisions in the growth outlook for a
number of emerging markets (e.g. Argentina,
Turkey, Iran and Venezuela). Growth prospects
have also weakened in Brazil, South Africa and
several other countries that struggle with sizeable
macroeconomic imbalances coupled with domestic
policy uncertainty. By contrast, the outlook has
improved slightly in several oil-exporting
countries where higher oil prices should boost
exports and improve current account balances and
fiscal
positions.
Recent
tariff
measures
implemented and announced by the US are likely
to have a noticeable negative impact on GDP
growth in China, which will, however, partially be
offset by a weaker Renminbi and domestic policy
measures.
The central scenario is based on several important
assumptions, including a ‘soft landing’ for the US
economy. The pro-cyclical fiscal loosening in
2018-2019 is not expected to ignite the kind of

16

price pressures that could lead to a faster pace of
monetary policy tightening than assumed in the
central scenario. As a result, monetary policy is
expected to normalise gradually and slow growth
to only slightly below potential. In 2020, a
Congressional agreement to extend current
expenditure levels in the US is assumed, implying
a growth-neutral fiscal stance. Second, on the trade
side no further escalation of trade protectionism
beyond what has already been adopted (and
announced) is factored in (see Section I.1). It is
also assumed that any negative confidence and
productivity effects from the current trade tensions
will remain relatively limited. Finally, the central
scenario assumes that the recent financial market
turbulence in some emerging markets will not lead
to broader contagion or a significant slowdown in
emerging market growth overall. These benign
assumptions imply that the global growth outlook
is subject to significant downside risks (see the risk
section below).
Advanced economies: growth to continue
beyond peak amid mounting risks

Economic activity in advanced economies has
remained solid, with recent GDP data from the
second quarter confirming robust growth in the US
and Japan after a soft patch in the first quarter.
Overall, economic growth in advanced economies
excluding the EU is expected to remain stable at

EA and EU outlook

2.6% in 2018, supported by strong labour markets,
high consumer and business sentiment and an
expansionary fiscal stance in the US, before
decelerating in 2019 and further in 2020. The
gradual growth moderation after 2018 reflects an
outlook for a progressively maturing cycle across
most advanced economies combined with
withdrawal of monetary (US, Canada, and
Australia) and fiscal (Canada, Australia, and
Japan) policy support and continued uncertainties
surrounding global trade relations.
GDP growth in the US is forecast to remain strong
at 2.9% and 2.6% in 2018 and 2019, respectively,
supported by strong consumer and business
sentiment, a tightening labour market and fiscal
stimulus. Corporate tax cuts are already providing
a considerable tailwind to private investment and
personal income tax cuts are boosting household
consumption. (18)
The recent decision to raise tariffs on USD 200 bn
worth of Chinese goods imports (adding to earlier
trade policy measures) and retaliatory measures by
China, are expected to have only a limited direct
impact on consumer prices and real activity.
Nonetheless, these additional tariffs will
marginally weigh on the economy’s buoyant
momentum (19) and slightly offset the benefits
provided by tax cuts. This contributes to
marginally weaker GDP growth (-0.1 pps.) in 2019
than predicted in the spring forecast. For 2020,
growth is expected to moderate more noticeably to
below 2%, slightly below potential growth
estimates, as supply-side constraints limit the pace
of economic growth and macroeconomic policy
support fades.
Monetary policy in the US is assumed to continue
tightening gradually, in line with the Federal
Reserve’s forward guidance. This implies that the
(18)

(19)

In the US, the 2017 tax act permanently lowered the top
corporate income tax rate (to 21%), changed the way that
companies’ foreign income is taxed, lowered individual
income tax rates, and broadened the base of income subject
to tax through 2025. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018
increased the caps on discretionary funding for 2018 and
2019 and provided substantial funding for emergency
assistance. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018
provided appropriations for all discretionary accounts for
2018.
In the US, already in mid-July 2018 a survey conducted by
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that announced
tariffs or retaliation has caused one-fifth of firms to
reassess their capital expenditure plans. See D. Altig, N.

federal funds rate should reach a broadly neutral
level over the course of 2019 before turning
slightly contractionary thereafter. At the same
time, a gradual increase in longer-term borrowing
costs among corporates is assumed in a context of
already high corporate leverage, which reached
74% of GDP in the first quarter of 2018 (from 66%
in 2012). (20) On the fiscal side, the growth impulse
provided by the stimulus package is expected to be
largely exhausted by the end of 2019, with the
fiscal stance assumed to turn broadly neutral
thereafter.
In Japan, GDP growth should drop to a level of
around 1% in 2018 and 2019 (down from 1.7% in
2017), driven by tighter labour market conditions
and lower net exports, although monetary policy
conditions are expected to remain accommodative.
The growth profile, however, could turn more
volatile in the second half of 2019, reflecting frontloaded expenditure ahead of a planned
consumption tax hike. In 2020, the pace of growth
is expected to slow to 0.5% on the back of
retrenchment in private consumption following the
planned future fiscal consolidation.
A differentiated growth outlook in emerging
markets amid localised pressures

The acceleration of economic activity in emerging
markets that has been going on since 2015 (see
Graph I.9), continued over the first half of 2018
amid still benign financing conditions and rising
oil prices. Since then however, it has become more
differentiated across countries, as the impact of
higher interest rates, a stronger US dollar and
increasing trade tensions have started to hit some
countries more than others. On aggregate, growth
in emerging economies is forecast to inch up to
4.7% in 2018 and to remain stable over the rest of
the forecast horizon. This implies a downward
revision of 0.3 pps. in both 2018 and 2019
compared to the spring forecast. Economic activity
is expected to be driven by growth in advanced
economies, which remains robust, and firming
commodity prices, which should benefit
commodity exporters. Recent financial market
turmoil in Argentina and Turkey, as well as
renewed US sanctions against Iran will, however,
weigh heavily on the regional outlook of these
economies. On the policy front, fiscal space to
support demand is limited amid existing
vulnerabilities, while several emerging markets

Financial conditions in emerging markets
tightened materially between February and
October 2018. This tightening, which was
triggered by a reappraisal of US growth and
inflation prospects, has been driven by higher
global long-term interest rates and a decline in
emerging market equity prices. Long-term yields
have also risen and sovereign spreads have
widened, reflecting lower capital flows to
emerging market economies (see Graph I.10),
though markets appear so far to differentiate
between countries, as spreads have widened more
for those with greater external financing needs.
Nevertheless, tighter global financial conditions,
reflecting factors such as the ongoing
normalisation of monetary policy in the US, are
likely to limit growth prospects in emerging
markets as a whole going forward.
Regional divergences in the growth outlook are
increasing. In Latin America, the Middle East,
Turkey and South Africa, growth is expected to be
weaker than forecast in the spring, as financing
conditions have tightened and geopolitical tensions
have risen. Argentina and Turkey experienced
severe currency turmoil over the summer and are
expected to slip into recession, recovering slowly
in 2020. Growth in other Latin American countries
is forecast to pick up over the forecast horizon
from the protracted slowdown in recent years, even
though political uncertainty and more restricted
access to foreign financing will dampen the
recovery.
In the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, higher
oil prices should support economic activity among
oil exporters, though US sanctions will weigh

18

heavily on economic activity in Iran and the
outlook for South Africa is clouded by the ongoing
land reform debate and financial pressures.
Emerging Asia is set to continue growing at a solid
pace, even though activity in China is expected to
moderate somewhat as domestic investment
continues to slow and export growth drops after a
very buoyant 2017. Regarding the impact of
current trade tensions with the US, China has
already started to pre-emptively loosen monetary
and fiscal policy to cushion the impact of tariffs.
Together with a weaker Renminbi, which has lost
almost 10% of its value since the beginning of the
year on the back of trade concerns and the broadbased strength of the US dollar, these policy
support measures are expected to limit the impact
of the recently-announced tariffs on headline
growth.
In India, growth has shaken off temporary
disruptions from demonetisation and the sales tax
reform and should remain buoyant, though the
economy remains vulnerable to higher oil prices
and tighter global financial conditions. Economic
activity in Russia is set to moderate over the
forecast horizon as the effects of higher oil prices
cannot fully counterbalance the impact of longterm growth bottlenecks and increased uncertainty
related to the recent wave of US sanctions.

Accordingly, emerging market currencies came
under pressure across the board, and particularly in
Turkey and Argentina (see Graph I.11). As a
result, higher bank funding costs and more
restrictive bank lending standards are likely to
weigh on the outlook of emerging markets, though
to varying degrees.

Global trade still robust overall in 2018 but
poised to slow down amid trade tensions

Following a strong rebound in 2017, world trade
growth started to lose momentum in the first half
of 2018. Trade still received support from the
steady growth of global demand and in particular
from solid manufacturing production and
investment at the beginning of 2018 but began to
decelerate thereafter. The abrupt turnaround was
felt across most regions of the world with, the US,
China and Japan, in particular all recording a
considerable slow-down in import growth in the
first half of the year (see Graph I.12).

The slowdown in trade growth is also visible in
leading trade indicators such as the WTO’s World
Trade Outlook Indicator (WTOI). The significant
decline in its latest reading (August), led by a dip
in export orders and, to a slightly lesser extent, air
freight and container shipping, suggests that trade
growth is likely to continue to slow in the coming
months.

In line with leading indicators, world imports
(excluding the EU) are expected to expand at 4.8%
in 2018, 0.7 pps. below the 2017 growth rate and
0.3 pps. below the value predicted in spring. Trade
this year is set to benefit from the relative strength
of global demand, with across-the-board positive
contributions from advanced and emerging
economies (Graph I.8). Import growth in particular
is expected to be sustained in the US, where the
positive effect of fiscal stimulus will likely more
than offset the negative effect of higher US tariffs.
On the other hand, several countries with large
current account deficits, in particular Turkey and
Argentina, which were affected by turbulence in
international financial markets, are expected to
reduce their import demand sharply this year.
Beyond 2018, non-EU global import growth is
expected to slow to 4.0% in 2019 and 3.7% in
2020, reflecting primarily the weakening of
economic activity but also, to a more limited
degree, the impact of growing trade tensions.

The elasticity of global imports of countries
outside the EU (non-EU imports) with respect to
non-EU GDP growth increased sharply to 1.4 in
2017 (see Graph I.14), the highest level since
2011. This is largely reflecting a strong rebound in
investment, the most trade-intensive component of
GDP, following several years of weak global
capital spending. The trade elasticity is expected to
moderate gradually over the forecast years,
reflecting the waning effects of the US stimulus on
investment both in the US and in other regions.
The ongoing rebalancing from investmentintensive growth to consumption in China and
current trade tensions (see Section I.1) are
expected to weigh on global trade elasticity and
bring it towards 1.

Oil prices increase amid rising uncertainties

Upward pressure on oil prices eased in early
summer 2018 as OPEC raised production levels
but intensified again in September with Brent
crude rising to 86 USD/bbl as renewed worries
about US sanctions on Iran and optimism over
global economic growth propelled the market
higher. Furthermore, the current increase in oil
prices has been driven by supply disruptions in
Venezuela and Libya and fears that increased
output from Saudi Arabia and Russia might not be
enough to fully compensate for these supply
shortfalls. Over the forecast horizon, upward price
pressures are expected to be held down by growing
oil production in Canada and the US, although
additional supply from the US is likely to reach
international markets only in the second half of
2019 due to pipeline capacity constraints. A
moderation in global oil demand growth in line
with slowing global economic growth, as projected
by the International Energy Agency, is also
expected to weigh on prices. Substantial
uncertainties around this scenario relate to the
scale of the reduction in Iranian crude exports, the
willingness and ability of Saudi Arabia to bridge
this gap, the volatility of Libyan and Venezuelan
production as well as the evolution of demand
should trade tensions intensify.
The assumptions for Brent oil prices (see
Graph I.15) are revised upwards to an average of
75.1 USD/bbl in 2018, 80.6 USD/bbl in 2019 and
76.7 USD/bbl in 2020, or up by 11% in 2018 and
26.1% in 2019 compared to the spring forecast
(see also Box I.5). Given the annual average of
54.8 USD/bbl in 2017, this implies a rebound of
38% in 2018, following an increase of about 21%
in 2017. The upward revisions since the spring
forecast are even higher in euro terms, amounting

The prices of other commodities are gradually
stabilising. After a robust recovery in 2017, metal
prices have declined this year by about 12% from
their peak in February, pulled down by weaker
demand from China following changes to
environmental regulations and tighter credit
conditions. They are expected to increase modestly
in 2018 before declining again in 2019 due to trade
tensions and lower growth in China. Food prices
are expected to increase moderately in both 2018
and 2019, as adverse weather conditions have
boosted prices for some (e.g. wheat) while trade
tensions cloud the price outlook for others (e.g.
soybeans).
A complex web of downside risks building up

Risks to the outlook for the external environment
are skewed to the downside and are closely
interconnected (see also Section I.10). In the US,
the highly pro-cyclical fiscal loosening risks
adding further impetus to price and wage growth,
which could accelerate the process of monetary
policy normalisation and trigger a stronger-thanassumed increase in long-term interest rates that
would weigh on domestic demand. This could also
cause a rise in risk aversion and portfolio
adjustments, which in a context of high corporate
leverage, could have a negative impact on firms’
ability to borrow and invest, dampening business
activity. The current fiscal stimulus is projected to
erode policy buffers available for offsetting
adverse shocks in the future, which adds to
concerns over US fiscal sustainability and elevated
debt levels (both public and private). Over the
medium term, a lack of firepower to deal with
future shocks could result in a deeper or more

EA and EU outlook

prolonged downturn when the cycle eventually
turns. In the absence of Congressional agreement
on spending levels, an abrupt tightening of fiscal
policy in 2020 is also a downside risk for the US.
Moreover, an escalation of trade tensions could
imply a negative supply-side shock and add to
inflationary pressures more strongly than expected,
which could trigger faster-than-assumed monetary
tightening. Faster-than-expected monetary policy
normalisation and a more pronounced slowdown in
the US would have a negative impact on the
outlook for the rest of the world and on the
situation in emerging markets in particular.
In emerging markets, direct contagion from the
recent currency sell-off in Turkey and Argentina
has so far been broadly contained. At the same
time, rising leverage (including in foreign
currencies) in many emerging markets has
increased their vulnerability to external shocks. An
escalation of financial market turmoil – triggered
for instance by higher interest rates in the US would entail sharper-than-expected tightening of
financial conditions across emerging markets,
accelerate deleveraging and result in restrictive
macroeconomic policies that would dampen
growth in emerging markets and constrain global
economic prospects. An additional downside risk
for emerging markets in 2020 stems from the fact
that most major global economies are currently
projected to slow down that year in a rather
synchronised way, which would make it very
challenging for emerging markets to sustain their
expansion paths.
Some of the previously identified trade-related
risks have partly materialised, as trade tensions
have continued to increase since the spring. In
September, the announcement of additional tariffs
on selected imports from China worth USD 200 bn
and the announced increase in tariff rates as of
January 2019 has heightened the risk of a further
escalation of the trade dispute between China and
the US beyond retaliatory measures already
announced. A sharper-than-projected slowdown in
global growth resulting from additional
protectionist measures represents a downside risk
to the forecast, particularly if confidence effects,
disruption of global value chains and the impact on
inflation in the US prove to be larger than
expected.

important for political reasons and China has
already started to loosen policy to counteract the
impact of US tariffs. But a return to more domestic
stimulus may come at the cost of impeding
domestic deleveraging, aggravating macrofinancial risks in the future.
All these downside risks are closely tied. For
example, the fiscal stimulus in the US is expected
to boost domestic demand and imports, widening
the US current account deficit in the near term.
This could reinforce the calls for more
protectionist US trade policies. Additional tariffs
imposed by the US could also result in higher
inflationary pressures which would further
aggravate the risk of tighter financing conditions
for emerging markets. Also, China’s policy
response to the trade measures adds to the
concerns about financial stability and may imply a
weaker Renminbi, which in turn would aggravate
trade tensions with the US.
3.

FINANCIAL MARKETS

Since spring, rising global interest rates and
increased global trade tensions have weighed on
financial market sentiment. However, continued
economic growth and low inflation combined with
very gradual normalisation of monetary policies
across the globe have helped to maintain financial
market volatility at rather low levels. Shocks that
came along with the tightening cycle were mostly
visible in bond markets and less so in stock
markets with exceptions in February and October.
Overall, financial market conditions have remained
supportive of growth in the EU economy.
Further rate hikes are assumed in the US, but
global monetary policy is set to remain rather
accommodative. Even so, the aggregate liquidity
provided by the major central banks may have
peaked in the middle of this year. Crises in some
emerging market economies (e.g. in Turkey and in
Argentina) have impacted markets domestically
with repercussions on exchange rates. The outlook
for public finances in Italy has pushed Italian
sovereign yield spreads significantly higher in
recent months. So far, no contagion to other
Member States has been observed.

Rising trade protectionism also aggravates the
long-standing risks of a disorderly adjustment in
China. China’s domestic growth targets remain

21

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

Monetary policy normalisation is proceeding
at different paces in major regions

In the US, the Federal Reserve tightened further its
monetary policy in a widely-expected move in
September, raising its main policy rate in for the
eighth time since the tightening cycle started in
December 2015. The 25 basis point increase in
September lifted the target range for the Federal
funds rate to between 2.00% and 2.25%. In
addition, the removal of language characterising
monetary policy as ‘accommodative’ in its
statement signalled that the funds rate was
considered as having moved into neutral territory.
Moreover, the Fed indicated that further interest
rate hikes may be required over the forecast
horizon (2018-2020).
In the euro area, monetary policy normalisation
has so far mainly affected the size of net asset
purchases and the details of the ECB’s forward
guidance. Starting in October this year, the ECB
reduced the amount of its monthly purchases under
the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) to EUR
15bn. At its September meeting, the ECB
Governing Council reiterated its intention to end
its net asset purchases at the end of the year,
subject to incoming data confirming its
medium-term inflation outlook. Despite this, the
ECB’s
monetary
policy
remains
very
accommodative and will continue to provide
significant monetary stimulus even after the end of
net asset purchases. This stimulus will be provided
by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the
associated reinvestments, as well as by the ECB’s
enhanced forward guidance introduced in June
2018. According to the latter, the ECB expects key
policy rates to remain at their current levels ‘at
least through the summer of 2019, and in any case
for as long as necessary to ensure the continued
sustained convergence of inflation to levels that
are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term’.
As for the reinvestments, the ECB forward
guidance states that the Eurosystem intends to
reinvest the ‘principal payments from maturing
securities purchased under the APP for an
extended period of time after the end of … net
asset purchases, and in any case for as long as
necessary to maintain favourable liquidity
conditions and an ample degree of monetary
accommodation’.
Outside the euro area, some central banks in the
EU have also maintained an accommodative
monetary policy stance but opened the door to
some degree of monetary policy normalisation by

22

the end of this year or over the course of next year
(e.g. Sweden and Hungary). At the same time, a
number of other non-euro area central banks in the
EU have continued to further normalise their
monetary policies (e.g. in the UK and in the Czech
Republic).
Meanwhile, monetary policy has also been kept
accommodative or has been eased further by other
major central banks around the world. Having been
obliged to repeatedly cut its inflation forecast, the
Bank of Japan has maintained an accommodative
stance and introduced new forward guidance at the
end of July 2018. (21) The Bank of Japan also
revised the formulation of its long-term interest
rate target to accommodate for a possible degree of
fluctuation depending on the changes in economic
and inflation conditions. China’s central bank has
eased its monetary policy stance since mid-April
this year to cushion a domestic growth slowdown
and any materialisations of the possible negative
impact of US tariffs. China’s central bank has
mainly cut the rate on the reserves that commercial
banks are required to keep in order to maintain
‘reasonable and sufficient liquidity’ to help supply
credit to smaller businesses and ‘optimise the
liquidity structure’ of commercial banks.
Strengthening of euro mainly against emerging
market currencies

The euro has appreciated slightly in nominal
effective terms in recent months. This has been
largely due to a strengthening of the euro against a
range of emerging market currencies, while at the
same time, it has weakened rather substantially
against some major currencies such as the US
dollar, the Japanese yen and more recently the
pound sterling. These developments largely
reflected the different pace of monetary policy
normalisation in the euro area on the one hand and
in the US and the UK on the other hand. However,
they were are also associated with policy
uncertainties relating to local and global factors
(e.g. fiscal policy-related worries in some euro
area Member States and trade tensions at the
global level). As regards the pound sterling, more
optimistic investor perception surrounding the
outcome of Brexit negotiations might have also
contributed to the recent rebound of the pound
sterling against the euro.
(21)

According to this new forward guidance, the Bank of Japan
expects that short- and long-term interest rates will stay at
their current low levels for an extended period of time.

EA and EU outlook

Sovereign yields have resumed their upward
trend…

Benchmark sovereign bond yields have been on
the rise since late August after a period of
stabilisation or slight decline. 10-year US
sovereign bond yields have recently broken the 3%
threshold and are currently around 3.2% amid
strong growth data and the tightening labour
market. Following the US, the yield on German
10-year Bunds also increased somewhat, reaching
around 0.55%, also supported by a positive, though
softening, growth outlook and the confidence
expressed by the ECB that inflation is likely to
converge towards its target in the medium term.
UK 10-year yields have been most of the year
below 1.5%, but recently broke that ceiling again,
and are currently close to 1.7% (see Graph I.16).

…with the largest spread widening in Europe
related to domestic policy issues.

Euro area sovereign bond spreads have moved in
different directions against the German Bund in
recent months. After widening in May in the wake
of general elections, Italian sovereign bond spreads
began widening further in late September reaching
300 basis points on investor concerns about the
governments budget plans (see Graph I.17). While
on previous occasions, such as during the euro area
sovereign debt crisis in 2011-2012, there were
strong spillovers from developments in one
country on other countries’ bond markets, the
contagion from the current sell-off of Italian bonds
has been limited (see Box I.2). Despite some minor
contagion to other Member States during the first
stress episode in May, spillovers to others recently
have been almost inexistent. (22) Spain’s sovereign

spreads have remained at around 100 basis points
for most of the year, while Greece’s sovereign
spreads have even narrowed this year.

Global stock markets have diverged

Despite price corrections in early October, the
S&P 500 Index, tracking the US stock market, has
risen this year, supported by strong corporate
earnings and equity buybacks. In Japan, the
Nikkei 225 was also on the rise. Conversely,
equities in the EU and especially China have
underperformed significantly. European equity
indexes have trended downwards since spring (see
Graph I.18), mainly on concerns related to the
impact of US trade policy on export perspectives,
but also in relation with the turmoil in some
emerging economies (in particular Turkey). The
European banking sector has underperformed the
wider index in response to various shocks,
including the increase in Italian yields (see
Box I.2), the crisis in Turkey, and several moneylaundering scandals. A number of other factors,
however, may also be weighing on European
banking stocks including low profitability and still
high levels of non-performing loans in some
Member States.
Due to a deteriorated economic outlook, emerging
market stock indexes fared worse, with the Hang
Seng index showing significant losses since its
peak in January, mainly due to growing trade
tensions.

Bank lending remains strong in the euro area…

The accommodative monetary policy in the euro
area has been transmitted through the banking
sector to interest rates on loans to households and
non-financial corporations (NFCs). The resulting
low interest rates have pushed the growth of net
lending flows to the private sector, which stood in
August at an annual rate of 3.4%. At 4.2%, the
pace of net lending growth to NFCs exceeds the
pace of lending to households which stood at
3.1%. Despite the increase, the annual growth rate
of loans to households for house purchases
remains low from an historical perspective. This
masks, however, stronger origination of new loans
and a high level of repayments resulting from the
boom period in mortgage markets before the
financial crisis.
Loan growth continues to be supported by low or
declining bank lending rates across the euro area
and increases in the supply and demand for bank
loans. Interest rates for new loans in Italy and
Spain marginally increased in August. However, at
the time of the cut-off date of the autumn forecast,
it is too early to conclude at a trend attributable to
the increase in Italian sovereign yields since May.

The results of the ECB Bank Lending Survey,
published in July, were consistent with a steady
recovery of bank lending volumes in the euro area.
Banks reported a further easing of credit standards
for all loan categories as well as rising demand for
loans. Banks expected that the net easing of credit
standards for all loan categories would extend into
the third quarter of 2018, while net demand was
expected to increase further. The main drivers
behind the easing of credit standards were
increasing competitive pressure and lower risk
perception. Terms and conditions on new loans
continued to ease across all loan categories, driven
mainly by narrower margins. The net percentage
share of rejected loan applications increased
slightly for loans to NFCs, and remained
unchanged for housing loans, while it decreased
further for consumer credit and other loans to
households.
Overall, lending growth to households and NFCs is
expected to continue increasing over the forecast
horizon under the combined effect of relatively
supportive credit terms and conditions by banks
and strong demand (see Table I.3).
…while market funding is also expanding.

Market funding has continued to expand in the
euro area in 2018. Bond issuance by NFCs has
shown steady net growth despite slightly wider
corporate bond spreads compared to earlier this
year. The rise in spreads concerns all investment
grade ratings and even more so the sub-investment
category. Patterns in individual euro area
countries, however, have varied over the last few
months, with Italian firms in particular seeing a
rise in yields (see Box I.2). There have also been
signs of fragile market liquidity. Bid-ask spreads
even for relatively highly-rated European
corporate bonds rose late in spring and over the

EA and EU outlook

summer, and have remained at elevated levels
since.
Higher market-based funding costs (resulting from
higher corporate bond yields and lower equity
prices) has also translated into somewhat higher
composite financing costs for NFCs (CFCIs) even
though bank lending rates have declined in most
euro area Member States compared since the end
of last year. While composite financing costs for
NFCs have moved higher from historically-low
levels in most euro area Member States this year,
financing costs rose the most in Italy as a result of
substantial increases in market-based funding costs
in recent months.
All in all, despite some significant headwinds,
financial markets have continued pricing credit and
interest rate risks at relatively low levels, and
spillover effects from country-specific risks have
remained contained. Market participants expect a
further gradual increase in risk-free interest rates,
which would support further price adjustments in
some of the more risky and highly-priced market
segments globally.

continued

The economic expansion in the euro area has
strengthened the debt-servicing and lossabsorption capacities of households, non-financial
corporations and the financial sector. Lower credit
losses and credit risks have contributed to a further
improvement in the profitability of the banking
sector. This is evident from the increase in the
aggregate return on equity of the biggest euro area
institutions, which had increased in 2017 to around
6% from 3.5% in the year before, and stood at
6.6% in the first quarter of 2018 (latest available
data).
…but going forward profitability is facing
important challenges.

In 2018, the slower formation of non-performing
loans bodes well for a further improvement in the
profitability in the euro area banking sector. (23)
However, the stock of non-performing loans
remains high in some Member States, suggesting
that these stocks remain a significant challenge to
the profitability and viability of certain EU banks.
(23)

For a discussion of the profitability and the vulnerabilities
of the banking sector in the euro area, see ECB (2018).
Financial Stability Review. May.

Other key determinants of future profitability
include the pass-through of higher interest rates,
the pace of changes in the yield curve, and the
composition of assets and liabilities in bank
balance sheets. The possible re-emergence of the
sovereign-bank nexus points to the remaining
importance of country-specific characteristics,
such as the share of holdings of bonds issues by
the domestic sovereign (see also Section I.10).

GDP AND ITS COMPONENTS

The EU economy is entering a period of less
dynamic growth after five years of uninterrupted
increases in economic activity. The EU economy is
still doing quite well overall, continuing to expand
for the sixth year in a row. But growth is expected
to be at rates that are lower than last year and the
speed looks unlikely to increase again soon.
Growth achievements in the past decade
have been muted…

In the 10 years since the economic and financial
crisis burst into the open with the collapse of
Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the EU
economy has made substantial progress in
removing the scars of the crisis (see
Graph I.19). (24)

In April 2018, the current economic expansion,
which began as a subdued recovery in the second
quarter of 2013, entered its sixth year. At the time
of publication, economic growth has lifted GDP
and its domestic components above the levels seen
10 years ago. But the post-crisis growth record
signals that the results were overall rather limited
in terms of the accumulated growth of GDP,
private consumption and investment. With this
aggregate picture hiding a lot of heterogeneity
across Member States, it is clear that in some
economies improvements in living standards over
the past decade were very small or even nonexistent. Between the first quarter of 2008 and
mid-2018, real per capita GDP in the euro area
(see Graph I.20) has only increased by 4.0%. The
continuation of the economic expansion is
therefore a necessary condition for raising living
standards in all Member States markedly above the
2008 level.

…raising questions about the expected length
and strength of the economic upswing…

The initial relative weakness of the recovery raises
questions about how long the current period of
growth can continue. The euro area’s position in
the cycle as well as domestic growth drivers point
to a ‘soft landing’ rather than a cyclical downturn.
However, this benign outlook is challenged by
recent disruptive developments outside and within
the euro area and subject to major downside risks
(see Section I.10).
Output gaps in the EU and the euro area are
estimated to have closed in 2017 and 2018

respectively, which suggests that output could be
expected to gradually converge towards potential
levels, which would imply actual growth rates
falling below the growth rate of potential output.
However, several of the mechanisms that could
potentially lead to this outcome look rather
unlikely. Signs of overheating might constitute a
risk in the US given its advanced position in the
cycle (see Sections I.2 and I.10) but can hardly be
seen in recent growth patterns in Europe. The
mechanism of a build-up of high private debt and
stretched asset price valuations that could raise
default concerns and thereby widening corporate
spreads and slowing economic growth, appears
also to be a distant possibility in the euro area. The
over-accumulation of capital after strong
investment growth that causes a cyclical weakness
is also hard to expect given the observed weakness
of investment in the euro area after the economic
and financial crisis.
Another approach is to look closer at cyclical
patterns. Comparisons with previous recoveries are
of limited use since structural differences distort
the comparability of cyclical phases over time. (25)
The relatively long-lasting and very subdued
recovery has indeed provided evidence of the
limited comparability of cyclical patterns after a
(25)

See European Commission (DG ECFIN) (2017). ‘European
Economic Forecast: Autumn 2017’. Institutional Paper 63,
pp. 26–28.

severe economic and financial crisis. (26)
Acknowledging these limitations puts the focus on
two questions: first, are there signs that the
economy has already passed a turning point in
terms of economic growth rates? Second, what
could bring the expansion to an end or even cause
a recession? While the former question requires
looking at developments in short-term indicators
(see below), the second one calls for an evaluation
of risks (see Section I.10).
…which might have already peaked in terms
of economic growth rates…

Has economic growth in the euro area already
peaked? The moderation in economic growth that
was observed in the first quarter when GDP
growth fell in the euro area to 0.4% (q-o-q) from at
least 0.7% in each of the five quarters before and
the continuation of the expansion at an unchanged
pace in the second quarter could suggest that
growth has peaked.
(26)

Features characterising the economic development since
the end of the ‘Great Recession’ in 2008-2009 have been
discussed in various forecast documents. These discussions
related to the initial contribution by Reinhart and Rogoff
(see Reinhardt, C. M. and K. S. Rogoff (2009). ‘This time
is different: eight centuries of financial folly’. Princeton
University Press 2009) but also to subsequent empirical
work (see e.g. Fernald, J. G., Stock, J. H., Hall, R. E. and
M. W. Watson (2017). ‘The disappointing recovery of
output after 2009’. Brookings Papers on Economic
Activity, Spring, pp. 1–81).

The extraordinary impact of the rebound in the
global environment last year may have provided an
additional stimulus that cannot be expected to
occur again. In fact, the growth contribution of net
exports in 2017 (0.8 pps. in the euro area, 0.6 pps.
in the EU) was the highest since the start of the
recovery in 2013. Thus, the pull-back from the
levels of growth seen in 2017 can be associated
with the smaller growth contribution of net exports
in the first half of the year. In addition, a number
of domestic factors have weighed on growth in
some Member States such as strikes, extraordinary
weather conditions not captured by seasonal
adjustment, higher tax burdens for consumers, and
unusually high levels of sick leave.
In the near term, leading indicators seem to
suggest that growth rates have entered a downward
trend. Survey indicators continue to signal
expansion but have retreated from the levels seen
at the beginning of the year. As regards companies
in the euro area, this applies to the Commission’s
Economic Sentiment Indicator but also to the
Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (see Graph I.21).
As regards households, consumer confidence has
also been falling since the start of 2018
(Graph I.22).

A closer look at the manufacturing sector
reinforces the suggestion that growth is unlikely to
pick up again soon. Abstracting from rather
volatile short-term movements (month-on-month),
industrial production has gained very little overall
this year, which is in line with the more moderate
level of economic growth observed in the first half
of the year (see Graph I.23).

…and will eventually depend on the interplay
of demand and supply constraints.

A number of factors are expected to come to the
fore over the coming months, some of which will
be supportive of growth, while others will have a
dampening effect. In terms of the latter, a
significant factor is that past tailwinds have been
fading. This includes the boost to the economy
from the decline in oil prices (from mid-2014 to
2016), the highly synchronised uptick in global
growth (2016-2017), the improvement in funding
conditions (especially after the introduction of

28

EA and EU outlook

quantitative easing in 2015), (27) and the
depreciation of the euro (in parallel to the
introduction of quantitative easing). Having been
in a position of high unemployment, the euro area
has also substantially benefited from a high rate of
job creation (job-rich recovery) that eventually will
decline. Another tailwind unlikely to come back
soon given the context of rising trade tensions, is a
revival of strong global economic growth. The
expected moderation of growth in the external
environment in 2019 and 2020 points to the
growing importance of domestic factors.
On the demand side, household real disposable
income growth will be constrained by the rise in
consumer price inflation. What may even be more
important for demand is the expected slowdown of
employment growth in an environment where
cyclical unemployment has diminished (see
Section I.6). Linked to that, on the supply side, a
relatively high number of companies are reporting
labour shortages as a limiting factor of production
and thus as a possibly growth-limiting factor.
Growth momentum has diminished since the
start of the year…

Looking at recent GDP developments in greater
detail, the first half of 2018 saw GDP growth
shifting down a gear compared to the exceptional
levels of 2017. Real GDP growth in the EU and
euro area came in at 0.4% (q-o-q) in the first and
the second quarter, following five quarters with
rates of at least 0.6%. Half year-on-half year, it
expanded by 0.9%, in line with the average
observed between the second half of 2013 and
2016. Despite the growth moderation, GDP
increased in all Member States for which data are
available.
As some of the factors that pushed growth higher
in 2017 have since faded, GDP growth has slowed
somewhat in the first half of 2018. Weaker foreign
demand has coincided with a shift in growth
sources from higher net exports towards higher
(27)

According to ECB staff estimates, the impact of all policy
measures taken between since mid-2014 and October 2017
on inflation and real GDP growth in the euro area between
2016 and 2020 is 1.9 pps.; see M. Draghi (2018).
‘Monetary policy in the euro area’. Speech at ‘The ECB
and Its Watchers XIX Conference’, Frankfurt am Main, 14
March 2018. For an overview of empirical studies on the
impact of unconventional monetary policy in the euro area,
see table 1 in G. Dell’Ariccia, Rabanal, P. and D. Sandri
(2018). ‘Unconventional Monetary Policies in the Euro
Area, Japan, and the United Kingdom’. Journal of
Economic Perspectives 32:4, pp. 147–72.

domestic demand contributions. In terms of
growth, for both euro area exports and imports, the
first half of 2018 was the weakest half year since
the start of the recovery in 2013. In the case of
exports, a lower impulse from global trade has
been compounded by the lagged impact of the
euro’s appreciation. At the same time, private
consumption grew at its slowest pace since the first
half of 2014, whereas investment expanded at its
highest rate since the second half of 2016.
…with survey indicators signalling more easing
in late 2018…

Incoming data on activity and sentiment provide
evidence that euro area activity in the third quarter
did not pick up from the first quarters of the year.
The Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator
(ESI) for the euro area reinforced this message by
declining for the ninth consecutive month this
year. It fell in September from 111.6 to 110.9
(112.5 in the second and 114.0 in the first quarter
of 2018), despite remaining at a high level by
historical standards and consistent with almost
steady economic growth (see Graph I.24).
Economic sentiment in the euro area has been
weighed down by lower confidence among
consumers and industry, while services, retail and
construction have remained buoyant. Furthermore,
the final Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index
showed the pace of growth slowing to one of its
lowest in two years. While remaining at a
relatively high level, it came in at 54.1 in
September, a deterioration on August’s 54.5 and
lower than the average reading of 54.7 in the
second quarter of 2018 (57.0 in the first quarter).

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

Although experts’ assessments of the current
situation only deteriorated slightly, their
expectations dropped to their lowest level since the
end of 2012.
…consistent with available ‘hard’ data for the
third quarter.

Recent data releases of monthly indicators paint a
similar picture of moderating economic growth.
• In August, industrial production in the euro
area rebounded (1.0% m-o-m) following
declines of 0.7% in each of the two months
before. In July, at 0.3% the annual rate of
change had been the lowest since January
2017. Given industry’s direct and indirect
exposure to tariffs, and the expected weakening
of global trade, developments in industrial
production are the focal point of attention, but
one has to keep in mind that recent European
readings were blurred by some exceptional
factors, mainly in the car industry, which
reported an strong decline in the production of
motor vehicles in July and August
(Graph I.25). The sharp decline in the durablegoods component of industrial production
(-2.3% y-o-y in July and -1.1% in August) is
related to the weakness in motor vehicle
production (-3.0% and -19.2% y-o-y) due to
problems with the certification of cars under
the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle
Test Procedure (WLTP), (28) which has
particularly hit German car producers (-4.8%
and -22.3% y-o-y in July and August).
(28)

Since 1 September 2018 all newly built cars must be
certified according to the WLTP test procedure. While its
predecessor determined test values based on a theoretical
driving profile, WLTP was developed using real-driving
data. And while previously car producers could just have
tested one model of a line, under the new regulation all
variants of a line, and all combinations of its body and
gearing, have to be tested. There is evidence that some
carmakers which were not able to meet the deadline on
WLTP certification, had to suspend the sale of some car
types and thereby slowed car production, for example by
introducing part-time work and/or four-day weeks in some
factories. The delays in switching production to WLTP
compliant cars is also reported to have caused car
deliveries to fall behind.

2018-Q3 versus 2018-Q2
2018-Q3 vs. average in the four preceding quarters
Note: 2018-Q3 is calculated on the basis of data for July and August.

• New industrial orders in the euro area fell in all
but one month this year. In July, they
contracted by 0.9% m-o-m, with the 3m-o-3m
growth rate at -0.2%.
• In August, the euro area retail trade volume fell
0.2% m-o-m, driven by a 0.6% decline in fuel
sales which can be partly related to price
increases in preceding months, as well as by a
0.3% decline in sales of food, drinks and
tobacco. The less volatile 3m-on-3m rate stood
at 0.1% (0.8% in June).
• In August, the production in construction in the
euro area decreased further (-0.5% m-o-m),
which suggests that growth in the third quarter
will be lower than in the second (1.5% q-o-q).
The average production level in July and
August stood 0.3% higher than on average in
the second quarter.
Notwithstanding
some
sector-specific
developments (e.g. in the car industry) that are
expected to affect the profile of economic growth
in the near term, recent developments suggest that
growth should on average continue at a moderate
rate in the second half of the year. All in all, with
the moderation of growth in the first half of the
year expected to persist, but a relatively high
carry-over from 2017, the forecast for GDP growth
in the euro area in 2018 remains at 2.1%,
unchanged from the summer interim forecast.
More moderate economic growth in 2019 and
in 2020…

The fundamentals for the continuation of the
growth of economic activity remain in place.
Domestic demand is expected to benefit from a
slightly expansionary fiscal stance in 2019; the

EA and EU outlook

continued transmission of growth-supportive
monetary conditions, with low financing costs for
corporates and governments alike, despite the
gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus;
favourable labour market conditions that allow for
slightly higher wage increases; and improving
corporate and household balance sheets which
create lower deleveraging pressures.
Moreover, the current expansion is still shorter in
length and smaller in size when compared to other
historical episodes. (29) Although structural
changes may limit the comparability of different
business cycle phases across different economic
expansions, economic growth is still rather
moderate when compared to what has been
observed in previous recoveries. (30) While
assessing how advanced the economic upswing is,
a comparison with the economic recovery in the
US suggests that there is still some way to go, with
room for an exceptionally long expansion and
lower concerns regarding a maturing business
cycle.
With the scope for further labour market
improvements more limited amid binding supply
constraints in several Member States and
diminishing slack elsewhere, employment gains
are expected to be more moderate. As such, absent
further drops in business sentiment, rising labour
utilisation should lead firms to focus on additional
capital spending in order to increase supply. Even
though tighter labour markets in a number of
Member States may limit the pace of employment
growth, they are also likely to spur investment in
technology and training, thus supporting
productivity growth.
The expected normalisation of monetary policy in
the euro area is set to gradually raise financing
costs for both companies and households and
thereby affect their spending decisions. At the
same time, waning foreign trade momentum, and
the lagged impact of the strengthening of the euro
are set to weigh. How firms reassess their
investment plans in light of rising and intensifying
trade tensions is also a source of uncertainty.
Besides raising input costs and reducing the
attractiveness of some investments, an uncertain
outlook can also lead companies to postpone

behaviour, particularly in capital-intensive sectors
such as manufacturing. (31)
Overall, real GDP growth is now forecast at 1.9%
in the euro area and at 2.0% in the EU27 in 2019,
slightly less than expected in the summer interim
forecast. Economic growth is projected to continue
moderating further in 2020. Real GDP is forecast
to grow by 1.7% in the euro area and by 1.9% in
the EU27, with the difference between the fastest
and slowing growing economies diminishing
(Graph I.26). In several Member States, growth is
expected to fall below its potential rate, resulting
in a gradual closure of the positive output gap.

Potential output in the euro area is estimated to
have expanded at increasing rates, starting from
¼% in 2012 to almost 1½% in 2017, supported by
increasing contributions from labour and total
factor productivity (Graph I.27). The larger
contribution from labour reflected a declining
Non-Accelerating Wage Rate of Unemployment
(NAWRU), which fell from its latest peak of 9.4%
in 2012 to 8.4% in 2017, and the continued
increase in trend labour participation rates. The

Strong economic growth over the past four years
has helped to narrow the negative output gap in
both the euro area and the EU. With economic
growth in both areas expected to remain at an
annual rate of around 2% in 2018, the output gap is
projected to turn slightly positive (¼% of potential
output in the euro area, ½% in the EU). This
implies that the cyclical upturn should have been
strong enough to lead the economy towards full
capacity utilisation.
In 2019 and 2020, GDP growth is set to be less
dynamic in the euro area and in the EU27, with the
pace of growth gradually settling back towards its
potential rate. At more moderate growth rates in
2019 and in 2020, the positive output gap is
projected to widen less than in the past. In all three
forecast years, strong employment growth in the
euro area is expected to allow the unemployment
rate falling below the estimated Non-Accelerating
Wage Rate of Unemployment (NAWRU). The
NAWRU is projected to continue to decline to
about 8% in 2019 and 2020. However, as estimates
of potential output and output gaps are inherently
uncertain, these results should be interpreted with
caution. (33)

The slowing of economic growth is expected to
include all Member States…

All Member States are expected to see growing
economic activity in the forecast years, but in most
of them the pace of economic growth in 2019 and
in 2020 is set to fall behind the pace registered on
average in 2017 and 2018 (see Graph I.28). In
most cases, the strongest performers in recent
years are set to continue to outperform and the
weaker performers will continue to perform below
average. Among the larger EU economies, Poland,
Spain, and the Netherlands are expected to be
economic outperformers, with real GDP growth
rates above the EU average, whereas Germany is
expected to grow slightly below the average in
2019 and in line in 2020. Italy, the UK and France
are set to lag in both years. In 2020, all EU27
Member States except Italy (1.3%) and Belgium
(1.4%) are projected to grow by more than 1.5%,
but for a large majority of Member States,
economic growth will likely be lower than in 2019.

According to the Commission’s estimates, the
growth rate of potential GDP in the euro area is

remain almost constant in 2019 and in 2020.

increase (from 1.8 pps. to 1.9 pps.), driven by a
pick-up in private and public consumption, while
the contribution from net exports is set to turn
neutral (from +0.3 pps. in 2018). A lowering of the
positive contribution to growth from domestic
demand (to 1.7 pps.) explains the annual growth
moderation expected in 2020 (see Graph I.29).

Private consumption

Given the ongoing negotiation over the terms of
the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, projections for
2019 and 2020 are based on a purely technical
assumption of status quo in terms of trading
relations between the EU27 and the UK. This is for
forecasting purposes only and has no bearing on
the talks underway in the context of the Article 50
process.
The growth of private consumption slowed in
the first half of the year…

Private consumption growth has been the main
driver of the current economic expansion. (34) In
the last two years, consumer spending has been
resilient due to strong employment growth. But in
the second quarter of 2018, private consumption
growth moderated, with a weakening to 0.2%
q-o-q (euro area) and 0.3% (EU) (from 0.5% in the
first quarter of 2018 in the euro area and 0.6% in
the EU). Half year-on-half year, it stood at 0.8% in
the euro area (0.9% in the EU), unchanged
compared to the second but lower than in the first
half of 2017. Weaker private consumption growth
is one of the reasons for the moderation of growth
this year. Private consumption growth has
moderated in line with the decrease in consumer
confidence but despite steady employment growth
(34)

See M. Dossche, Forsells, M., Rossi, L, and G. Stoevsky
(2018). ‘Private consumption and its drivers in the current
economic expansion’. ECB Economic Bulletin 5, pp. 86–
109.

and a reduction in the euro area household saving
rate (which stood at 12.0% in the first quarter of
2018, the same as in the fourth quarter of 2017 and
at its lowest since 1999).
A look at the breakdown of private consumption
shows that the slowdown in the first half of the
year is explained by lower momentum in the
consumption of durable goods. Growth in durable
goods consumption fell from a half-year-on-half
year rate of 2.1% in the second half of 2017 to
1.4% in the first half of 2018; while non-durable
consumer goods and services consumption picked
up marginally from 0.5% to 0.6%. With spending
on durable goods usually being more sensitive to
the business cycle than spending for other types,
the observed change in the pace could be
associated with economic growth shifting to a
lower gear. Moreover, the pent-up demand for
durables might have been exhausted after several
years of economic expansion. (35)
The slowdown in the second quarter was
broad-based across the largest euro area
economies, with France posting a contraction for
the first time since the third quarter of 2016, driven
by a fall in the consumption of non-durable goods
and services. This was partly related to temporary
factors (e.g. strikes) but also to the unwinding of
factors that supported private consumption in the
first quarter (e.g. strong energy consumption
related to unfavourable weather conditions).
Significant differences between countries were
apparent in the first half of the year. Private
consumption picked-up in Germany (from 0.6% to
0.8%), Italy (from 0.4% to 0.5%) and the
Netherlands (from 1.4% to 1.7%) and remained
strong in Spain (at 1.2% from 1.5% in the second
half of 2017). Only in France did it decelerate.
…is expected to remain moderate in the
second half of the year…

The short-term indicators of private consumption
are consistent with consumer spending growth
returning to the levels seen before the
exceptionally weak second quarter.

Indicator declined in September to its lowest
level since May 2017 (Graph I.30), but

decline was mainly driven by consumers’ less
favourable outlook over the next 12 months for
their financial and for the general economic
situation and the more pessimistic assessment
of risks of becoming unemployed. By contrast,
households’ intentions for major purchases
over the next 12 months have been quite stable
until September 2018, which sends a positive
signal for a possible rebound in private
consumption growth after the slowing in the
second quarter.

• Consumers’ views on the current and the future
economic situation have deteriorated in recent
months and the gap between both assessments
has closed (Graph I.31). Since expectations that
situations will improve in the future are seen as
an incentive to advance spending in an attempt
to smooth consumption, the closing of the gap
does not bode well for an acceleration of
private consumption growth. However, as for
several other survey indicators, it has to be
noted that the level of the expectations is still
relatively high by historical standards.

• New passenger car registrations in the euro
area fell markedly in September 2018 (-37%

misleading because the introduction of a new
emissions test for new cars (WLTP) at the
beginning of the month caused an exceptional
surge in August (20% m-o-m) when car
producers registered vehicles manufactured
under the old testing rules in order to be able to
sell them without having to apply the new

EA and EU outlook

June, close to its highest growth rate since late
2006.
All in all, while the recent data releases could
question the near-term outlook for private
consumption, it is important to recognise that a
broad set of household fundamentals has remained
favourable when assessing the prospects for 2019
and 2020.
…but to continue delivering the largest growth
contribution in the next two years.

Over the forecast horizon, the expansion of private
consumption should get support from the
acceleration of nominal disposable income, which
is also supporting consumer confidence. The
growth of labour incomes is expected to benefit
relatively more from wage and salary increases
than in the past and less from increases in
headcount employment, as employment growth in
the euro area is expected to slow. Private
consumption will thus lose one of its most
important push factors.
With slowing employment creation, the
momentum in consumer spending will depend on
both the extent to which wages move higher and
on changes in non-labour incomes (Graph I.33).
Gross wages and salaries in the euro area are
expected to increase by 4.0% in 2018 (from 3.6%
in 2017), moderating to 3.7% in 2019 and 3.5% in
2020. At the same time, non-labour incomes
should grow more moderately. All in all,
household nominal gross disposable income is
forecast to expand by 3.2% in 2018 (up from 2.9%
in 2017), peaking at 3.6% in 2019.

Note: Forecast figures are annual data.

In some Member States, the development of
nominal incomes is strongly affected by fiscal
policy measures. This includes Germany, where

households are set to benefit in 2019 from new
measures (see Section II.5). Moreover, some
technicalities affect the growth of employee
compensation. In France, for example the CICE
(Tax Credit for Competitiveness and Employment)
(see Section II.10), which is recorded as a subsidy
to firms until the end of 2018, is due to be replaced
by a permanent reduction in social security
contributions in 2019. This is set to reduce the
contribution of employers in total compensation
but not the wages and salaries component; thus it
should not have an impact on the take-home pay of
households per se.
Taking into account the expected acceleration in
annual consumer price inflation in both 2018 and
2019, household real disposable income in the euro
area is forecast to pick-up to 1.5% in 2018 (1.3%
in 2017) and 1.9% in 2019. In 2020, real
disposable income is projected to grow more
moderately (1.6%), driven by lower nominal
disposable income growth and a slowdown in
consumer price inflation.
There are several factors that matter for the link
between the projected increases in real disposable
incomes and the outlook for private consumption.
First, the composition of income growth is
expected to be less favourable for consumer
spending because growth will be increasingly
driven by wages rather than employment, which
usually implies a lower impact. Second, beyond
the negative impact on the purchasing power of
households, the increase in energy prices could
contribute to higher uncertainty about future prices
and lead consumers to postpone purchases of
durables and increase precautionary savings. (36)
Households intending to finance spending via
consumer credit should continue to benefit from
favourable lending conditions, as reported in the
ECB Bank Lending Survey. However, in an
environment of rising financing costs, the
normalisation of monetary policy will also affect
the debtors among households. But the impact of
higher interest rates on households is not clear cut.
Although it remains low by historical standards, in
a perfectly symmetric set-up, higher interest
expenditure would be mostly offset by higher
(36)

Moreover, empirical studies suggest that the impact of an
increase in oil prices is stronger in an environment with
elevated uncertainty; see A. Evgenidis (2018). ‘Do all oil
price shocks have the same impact? Evidence from the
euro area’. Finance Research Letters 26, pp. 150-55.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

household incomes from savings. (37) As net savers
are less inclined to spend out of a rise in income
than net borrowers, rising interest rates tend to
depress spending overall. Moreover, higher
interest rates could also increase the attractiveness
of saving versus spending, all else being equal.
The quantitative relevance of these arguments
depends on the strength of household balance
sheets in the euro area, which differ across
countries.
The aggregate household balance sheet remains in
solid shape, amid a rise in households’ net worth,
due in part to rising house prices and past stock
market gains. Households’ net worth (including
both financial wealth and non-financial assets) is
close to its highest level as a percentage of GDP
since the end of 2010 and remains close to its
all-time peak as a percentage of gross disposable
income. The household debt service burden is low,
reflecting both the extended period of low interest
rates in Europe and declining household
indebtedness. Household’s debt-to-income ratio
reached 93.7% in the second quarter of 2018,
down from a peak of 99% in the fourth quarter of
2010.
The dampening effects of rising interest rates are
likely to be strongest in countries with higher
household debt and a predominance of floatingrate loans. By contrast, in countries where fixedrate household loans are more common,
households could see their returns from financial
assets grow faster than their liabilities. That being
said, the increase in long-term interest rates is
assumed to be rather modest over the forecast
horizon. At the same time, still low interest rates
should also continue to support asset prices and
household wealth, including in housing, with
moderate
positive
effects
on

Doubts about the symmetric movements of deposit rates
could be related to the observed reluctance of banks to pass
on negative rates to depositors. See F. Heider, Saidi, F. and
G. Schepens (2018). ‘Life below zero: Bank lending under
negative policy rates’. CEPR Discussion Paper 13191.
Nocera and Roma (2017) found only a modest housing
wealth effect in the euro area, with the exception of Ireland
and Spain, where a housing demand shock, in terms of a
1% increase in real house prices, is associated with a
significant increase of real private consumption of 0.15%,
but even this is substantially below the 0.47% estimate
recently presented by Aladangady (2017) for the US
economy. See A. Nocera and M. Roma (2017). ‘House
prices and monetary policy in the euro area: evidence from
structural VARs’. ECB Working Paper Series 2073; A.
Aladangady (2017). ‘Housing wealth and consumption:

With growing real incomes, the number of
households with precautionary savings (39) is likely
to increase. Indeed, given a still-high level of
household indebtedness in some Member States
and continued increases in life expectancy,
precautionary saving motives have an important
role in making households (40) more sensitive to
income changes due to e.g. concerns related to
unemployment risks and having adequate income
during retirement. This is consistent with
consumption-smoothing behaviour and – amid a
gradual monetary policy normalisation - should be
reinforced by the diminished impact of persistently
low interest rates on the propensity to save,
particularly among financially constrained
households.
On aggregate, the household saving rate in the
euro area is expected to remain stable between
2018 and 2020, although the situation in individual
countries differs considerably. An almost equal
number of economies are expected to see saving
rates decrease compared to those expected to see
saving rates increase or remain unchanged.
Furthermore, any increase in uncertainty, even if
unrelated to existing economic fundamentals,
could have a lasting affect consumer sentiment and
subsequently the economic outlook. (41)
All in all, private consumption growth in the euro
area is forecast to remain stable in 2018 at 1.6%. It
is then expected to pick up to 1.8% in 2019, partly
due to fiscal measures in some Member States,
before moderating, as employment growth, to
1.6% in 2020 as employment growth slows.

Precautionary savings theory shows that savings also serve
as insurance against contingencies, mostly those affecting
income, e.g. unemployment and liquidity constraints.
Households thus save not only to buffer lower future
income but also to insure against different types of risks.
On the measurement of the risk to income see Antonin, C.
(2018). ‘Measuring precautionary savings related to the
risk of unemployment’. Sciences Po OFCE Le Blog. June.
In particular highly indebted households are more sensitive
to income changes because of borrowing and liquidity
constraints, highlighting the importance of looking into the
heterogeneity of debt burdens. See Nakajima, J. (2018).

EA and EU outlook

Germany, also driven by supportive fiscal
measures, while a gradual softening is forecast in
the Netherlands and Spain. In both France and
Italy, private consumption growth is forecast to
strengthen in 2019 and to remain stable thereafter.
Public consumption growth has moderated in
the first half of the year…

In the first half of the year, government
consumption expanded by 0.4% in both the euro
area and the EU (0.7% in the second half of 2017),
its slowest pace since the second half of 2013.
According to the sectoral breakdown available up
to the first quarter of 2018, the slowdown in that
quarter appears to be driven by relatively weaker
growth in the acquisition of goods and services,
which were not compensated by a small uptick in
public spending on compensation of employees
(see Graph I.34).

Following its steep fall during the economic and
financial crisis, it took investment (gross fixed
capital formation) many years to return to
pre-crisis levels. After several years of weak
dynamics, as the economic recovery that started in
2013 gained traction, investment began to grow at
rates of at least 3%. This exceeds the growth rate
of GDP but remains moderate for a highly cyclical
component during an upswing.

These projections mask some divergence among
Member States (see Section I.8) with differing
consolidation needs and economic situations. In
2019, government consumption growth is forecast
to accelerate in the Netherlands, Germany, and
Italy, while remaining steady in France and
slowing in Spain, whereas the projected softening
in 2020 is broad-based, except in Italy where it is
forecast to pick-up marginally.

expenditure. In 2019, public consumption growth
is projected to pick-up, before moderating in 2020
(1.6 and 1.3%, respectively). The modest slowing
projected in 2020 is associated with a
no-policy-change assumption, in which measures
are only factored into the forecast if they have
been adopted and presented to national parliaments
or are known in sufficient detail to be taken into
consideration.

20

In the second quarter, government consumption
rebounded (to 0.4% q-o-q, from 0.1%), posting a
positive contribution to growth following two
consecutive quarters of neutral contributions. This
pick-up was broad-based across the larger euro
area economies, with a particularly strong rise in
Germany (from -0.3% to +0.6%), with the
exception of the Netherlands, where there was a
slowdown.
…but is projected to pick up in 2019 before
moderating again.

Taking into account the outturn of the first half of
the year, aggregate government consumption is
expected to grow slightly more than in 2017,
increasing by 1.3% (1.2% in 2017) in the euro
area, on the back of stronger compensation of
employees
and
intermediate
consumption

In the first half of 2018, investment was 1.6%
higher than in the second half of 2017, but the
marginal increase in the pace of growth (from
1.5% in the second half of 2017) can be attributed
to the rebound of investment in Ireland after a
sharp contraction in the second half of 2017
(investment growth in the euro area excluding
Ireland fell from 2.3% in the second half of 2017
to 1.5% in the first half of 2018). While investment
rose markedly in Germany and Spain, it slowed
substantially in France and Italy and less markedly
in the Netherlands.
Looking at quarterly developments in the euro
area, the pick-up in the second quarter was much
stronger than the one in the first (1.4% q-o-q after
0.1% q-o-q). These developments lifted the
investment-to-GDP ratio to 21%, which is still
about one full percentage point lower than the
average in the period 2000-2005. However, the
aggregate ratio hides substantial differences in the
ratios for equipment and for construction
investment, with only the former fully recovering.

37

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

Differences also persist between investment in the
public and in the private sector. While public
investment remained in 2017 at the all-time low of
2.6% of GDP that it had arrived the year before,
private investment has increased steadily since
2013 to 18.2% of GDP, which is the highest rate
since 2008.
In both 2018 and 2019, public investment in the
euro area is expected to grow at rates of 3.3% and
3.0% respectively, which translates into a share of
2.7% of GDP. The projected growth of public
investment by 3.0% in 2020 is set to lift this share
to 2.8%.
In the private sector, increases in the business
investment rate are set to be supported by an
above-average marginal value of capital, as
measured by the equity-to-net worth ratio. As
regards the financing of investment spending, bank
lending to firms and other funding for companies
should continue to be supported by relatively low
though increasing interest rates and favourable
credit standards (see also Section I.3). In the
second quarter of 2018, the leverage ratio of
non-financial companies, i.e. the ratio of debt and
total financial assets, decreased to its lowest level
since 2000, while other leverage measures show
less sizeable adjustments.

investment
between
and slower demand

Equipment investment has continued to grow on
the back of very favourable financing conditions,
rising corporate profitability and solid demand. In
the first half of 2018, the acceleration in
investment rested on developments in equipment
investment, which increased by 2.0% compared to
the second half of 2017. On a quarterly basis,
equipment investment had even contracted in the
first quarter of 2018 (-0.6% q-o-q), but rebounded
in the second quarter (2.6%).

Against the background of the weak first quarter
and a less favourable demand outlook, investment
growth has been revised down from the spring
forecast. In 2018, investment growth in the euro
area is now forecast to pick-up from 2.6% last year
to 3.3% (0.9 pps. less than in the spring), with
investment returning to its pre-crisis peak level
reached in 2007.

While the first half of the year was less dynamic
than the second half of 2017, several short-term
indicators continued to signal solid equipment
investment growth in the near term. Capacity
utilisation in manufacturing in the euro area fell in
the third quarter (survey conducted in July) by 0.2
points to 84.1% but remains above the average
since 1990 (81.0%), and capacity utilisation in
services increased by 0.4 points to 90.6%, which is
above the average since the start of the series 2011
(88.7%). Confidence in all sectors surveyed by the
European Commission (manufacturing, services,
construction, and retail sectors) has been
moderating in 2018 but in September was still well
above long-term averages. As regards profitability,
earnings
expectations
remain
favourable;
according to the euro area sectoral accounts for the
second quarter of 2018, business margins
(measured as the ratio of net operating surplus to
value added) remain close to their highest level
since early 2009. Furthermore, August saw the
strongest annual growth of loans to non-financial
corporations (adjusted for sales and securitisation)
since May 2009, boding well for business
investment spending. The demand outlook though
still favourable has been clouded by interrelated
downside risks.

Further ahead, investment should continue to grow
but at declining pace. In both 2019 and 2020
investment is expected to grow by 3.0% in the euro
area, in line with less buoyant external demand.
The year 2019 is also expected to be the first since
2007 in which investment increases in all EU
Member States. The continued strength of

Less favourable signals come from the production
of capital goods. Monthly data on capital goods
production in the euro area stood on average in
July and August 0.2% below the average level in
the second quarter of 2018, when they increased
by 0.1% q-o-q (2.3% y-o-y). And increased
uncertainty, trade tensions, and increasing input

Investment has also continued to benefit from the
support provided by the Investment Plan for
Europe (“Juncker Plan”). As of October 2018,
operations approved under the Investment Plan for
Europe (EUR 67.3 bn.) were expected to trigger
EUR 344bn. in investments, with around 793,000
small and medium-sized businesses benefitting
from improved access to finance.

investment implies strong growth contributions
and increases in capital deepening which further
support cyclical improvements in labour
productivity.

EA and EU outlook

prices are not conducive to equipment investment
growth.
Towards 2019, the outlook for equipment
investment (see Graph I.35) is expected to
continue benefitting from
still favourable
financing conditions, rates of capacity utilisation
that remain above the long-term average, falling
but still decent business confidence and a
favourable earnings outlook. The impact of these
supportive factors, however, is likely to be partly
offset in the short term by rising supply hindrances
(particularly on the labour market), which in some
Member States are constraining the recruitment
required to expand capacities. Another impediment
to investment growth is related to uncertainty
regarding the external environment, through both
its direct impact on current demand, as well as on
future demand prospects. (42) Elevated economic
uncertainty has been shown to significantly impact
corporate decision making, particularly with
respect to investment decisions and cash holdings,
even in an environment of historically low interest
rates. (43) Finally, similarly to previous forecast
rounds, pending challenges related to the still high
stock of non-performing loans in some countries
are expected to continue to weigh on investment
but to a lesser extent, as volumes of nonperforming loans are gradually receding.
All in all, euro area equipment investment is
forecast to grow by 5.5% in 2018, and to moderate
thereafter to 3.5% in 2019 and 3.1% in 2020. A
lower growth path is expected in all but five EU
Member States.
(42)

(43)

Uncertainty arises when economic agents cannot
reasonably assess the likelihood of all possible future states
of nature or characterise the probability distribution of their
possible impacts. The real options channel suggests that the
option value increases with uncertainty in the case of
irreversible investment or consumption decisions. See ECB
(2016). ‘The impact of uncertainty on activity in the euro
area’. Economic Bulletin 8, pp. 55–74.

…and construction investment benefitting from
the recovery in housing markets.

The construction sector is set to register its fourth
consecutive year of recovery in 2018. Over the
first half of the year, it continued to expand,
though more slowly than equipment investment.
The expansion was particularly strong in Spain, the
Netherlands and Germany (2% or above) while
losing some pace in France and Italy. Overall, in
the second quarter of 2018, construction
investment registered its twelfth consecutive
quarter of positive growth.
House prices have been particularly dynamic.
Eurostat’s House Price Index rose at an annual rate
of 4.3% (y-o-y) in the euro area in the second
quarter of 2018, after reaching its highest rate in 11
years the quarter before. Similarly to previous
quarters, the slower increase in household real
disposable income suggests a decline in the
average affordability of housing. (44) At the euro
area aggregate level, there is growing evidence that
the gap between the level of residential investment
and the level implied by real disposable incomes is
closing.
Taken together, most signals seem positive for
future construction investment. On the one hand,
the current positive momentum is reflected in
increasing confidence in construction sector
surveys, such as in the Commission’s Construction
Confidence Indicator, which reached its highest
historical level in the third quarter of 2018. The
number of building permits in the second quarter

increased by 1.1% (q-o-q), after growing by 0.4%
for two consecutive quarters, and reached its
highest level since early 2011. Furthermore, the
annual growth rate of loans for house purchases
stood at 3.2% in August, close to its highest since
September 2011.
While net loan flows (newly originated loans
adjusted for the repayment of previously granted
loans) suggest that mortgage lending remains
relatively subdued compared to the pre-boom
period, the current level of loan origination is
estimated to be close to its average since 2001. (45)
These developments are in line with both the
previously mentioned buoyant house price growth
and messages from the Bank Lending Survey on
both credit standards and loan demand.
Construction investment should continue to enjoy
the support of low interest rates but, new
mortgages should progressively become more
costly, making alternative investments relatively
more attractive. Interest rate increases have been
shown to have an asymmetric impact on residential
investment, having a more sizeable effect than
interest rate decreases, particularly when the share
of residential investment in GDP is rising strongly,
which is not the case at the moment. (46) The
continued dynamism in real house prices and
favourable income prospects should further
support residential investment, despite the
challenges posed by demographic factors.
In 2018, growth in construction investment is
expected to reach 3.3% in the euro area, after
peaking at 3.8% in 2017, with its share of GDP
(about 10%) still below its peak, which was
reached in 2007. It is projected to lose some
momentum towards 2020 as capacity constraints in
the construction sector become more binding in
some Member States (2.8% in 2019 and 3.0% in
2020) with all Member States participating in the
expansion. The relatively steady growth path at the
aggregate level masks different trends in some
Member States. For example, growth is expected

Global factors are weighing on exports and
imports…

Strong export growth (goods and services) has
been a key factor behind the ongoing economic
expansion in the euro area. In 2017, strong growth
in export markets (4.7%) pushed euro area exports
up 5.2%, which, in combination with slightly less
dynamic import growth (3.9%), led net exports to
make a strong growth contribution to growth (0.8
pps.). In the first half of 2018, the growth of euro
area exports (goods and services) was less than
half as strong as it was in the previous year and
weaker than at any time since the first half of
2013. On a quarterly basis, the first quarter of 2018
was the first since 2013 in which euro area exports
contracted.
The slowdown in export growth over the first half
of the year was widespread among the largest euro
area economies with Italy registering a sizeable
contraction. While most saw a contraction in the
first quarter of 2018, exports either completely or
partly rebounded in the second quarter, with the
exception of Spain where exports expanded
strongly in the first quarter but contracted in the
second. For the euro area, international trade data
shows that the rebound in exports resulted from an
uptick in intra-euro area exports (to rates in line
with those observed over the second half of 2017),
whereas extra-euro area exports remained
unchanged. The slowdown in extra euro area
export growth was mostly driven by manufactured
products, particularly machinery and transport
goods, as well as energy products.

EA and EU outlook

As regards the near-term outlook, most indicators
suggest that euro area export growth is likely to
remain subdued:

quarter of 2018 with the component for new export
orders falling in September below the no-growth
threshold of 50 for the first time since June 2016.

• Export expectations in manufacturing as
measured by the Commission’s quarterly
survey, have been steadily moderating since
late 2017 and fell to their lowest level since the
second quarter of 2017 in the third quarter of
this year.

Overall, these signals suggest that euro area export
growth remains slower than in the past, which is
also mirrored in the projected annual forecast of
3.3% in 2018, down from 5.2% in 2017.

• The monthly assessment of export order books
in the Commission’s manufacturing survey has
fallen from the post crisis high reached in
January 2018. In the third quarter of this year,
the indicator averaged its lowest since the third
quarter of last year.

In 2019 growth in euro area export markets is
forecast to remain broadly stable at 3.9% (3.8% in
2018) and to slow to 3.6% in 2020, rates that are
somewhat lower than they have been for most of
the years of the current expansion. Another
important dampening factor concerns the
composition of euro area exports, which are
usually closely linked to global investment growth.
Increased economic policy and trade policy
uncertainty is projected to slow the momentum of
global investment growth (see also Section I.2)
with a negative impact on euro area exporters.

• In September, the index of new export orders
in the Manufacturing PMI fell below the noexpansion threshold of 50 for the first time
since June 2013, after having fallen in the two
preceding months. The decline in new export
orders was widespread across the largest
Member States and substantial over time and
with respect to the peaks observed since the
start of the recovery in the second quarter of
2013 (see Graph I.37).

quarter).
These more negative signals for the euro area
outlook come on top of other negative signals from
the external environment (see also Section I.2).The
Global Composite PMI declined in the third

…and are dampening the export outlook…

At the current juncture, the direct impact of
protectionist measures elsewhere is expected to
remain low and the outlook for trade in goods and
services is based on the assumption that trade
disputes will not escalate any further. What is
expected to weigh on trade flows is the impact of
the uncertainty generated by implemented,
announced and threatened trade measures. This
also relates to investment, which is an important
determinant of export volumes and where delayed
or modified global spending decisions are set to
weigh slightly on euro area export volumes. An
escalation of trade tensions is a substantial
downside risk (see Section I.10) as it would hurt
both trade and investment through confidence
channels, if it were to materialise.
All in all, several factors are expected to dampen
export growth. In addition to the projected
moderation in world trade and increased
uncertainty with respect to trade policies, the
lagged impact of the euro’s appreciation, mainly
against a range of emerging market currencies, is
deteriorating the price competitiveness of euro area
companies and constraining their ability to gain
market share. Moreover, in some countries and
sectors, increasingly binding supply constraints
limit the room for further increases in export
volumes, particularly where companies tend to
prioritise domestic customers. Accordingly, euro
area export growth is forecast to remain at around

…but also clouding the import outlook…

Euro area imports of goods and services also grew
more moderately in the first half of the year, in line
with the more subdued growth of final demand.
Import growth declined by a quarterly rate of 0.5%
in the first quarter and rose by 1.2% q-o-q in the
second quarter. According to international trade
data, extra euro area import growth slowed across
product categories, with the exception of energy
products which increased on a half-year-on-half
year basis.
The impact of import tariffs implemented by the
EU in response to US tariffs on steel and
aluminium is expected to be very small due to the
small share of import goods affected. Going
forward, the assumption of no further escalation of
trade disputes applies.
Imports of goods and services are thus expected to
grow by 3.0% this year compared to 3.9% in 2017,
in line with the moderation in exports. A pick-up is
expected in 2019 due to a positive carry-over
effect from the rise between the first and second
half of 2018. Further out, robust domestic demand
this year and continued export growth are set to
remain important determinants behind the

42

expansion in imports. Euro area imports are
projected to grow by 3.6% in 2020.
…altogether turning the growth contribution of
net exports neutral.

Reflecting the weakening of export momentum in
the first half of 2018, the contribution of net
exports to GDP growth turned broadly neutral and
thus lower than in the second half of 2017 when it
made up 0.6 pps. of GDP growth as compared to
the first half of the year.
Although export growth is projected to slow more
than import growth in 2018 (-1.9 pps. vs. 0.9 pps.),
exports are still expected to grow faster than
imports. As a result, net exports should continue to
contribute to GDP growth (0.3 pps., down from 0.8
pps. in 2017). As domestic demand is expected to
remain relatively strong in the euro area, import
growth is expected to overtake export growth in
2019 and 2020, leading to a broadly neutral growth
contribution from net exports.

THE CURRENT ACCOUNT

In 2017, the current account surplus of the euro
area continued to rise and reached a historically
high level of 4.0% of GDP on the back of a surge
in the surplus from the trade in services and an
increase in the net primary income surplus. Also,
the adjusted current account (47) surplus remained
unchanged at its historical highs of 3.2% of GDP
in both 2016 and 2017. Looking ahead, the current
account surplus as a percentage of GDP is
expected to recede somewhat and remain at a high
level, largely on account of a decreasing surplus in
the merchandise trade balance and a melting
primary income surplus.
The current account surplus reached a new
high in 2017…

Last year’s peak was preceded by a long period of
gradually rising current account surpluses, which
started after the global financial crisis with the
support of several factors. The sharp decline in
commodity prices in 2014-2015, gains in price
competitiveness due to the lower external value of

EA and EU outlook

the euro and the sluggish momentum of investment
spending coupled with high private sector savings,
all contributed to the steady increase of the
surplus. Most of these supportive factors, however,
weakened in recent years due to a rebound of oil
prices and an appreciation of the nominal effective
exchange rate of the euro. In parallel, domestic
demand has strengthened albeit to a lesser extent.
Despite these developments, the strength of global
growth and the rise in net primary income
continued to power the euro area current account
surplus to a new record in 2017.
The adjusted merchandise trade balance peaked in
2016, in parallel with the fall in the oil-trade deficit
to an all-time low that was driven by plunging in
oil prices (Graph I.39). As oil prices picked up
relatively quickly in 2017, the euro area’s terms of
trade deteriorated for the first time after four years
of steady improvement on the back of falling
import prices. Rising oil prices and a higher
external value of the euro began weighing on the
merchandise trade surplus in 2017 and resulted in a
drop of the adjusted merchandise trade balance
from 3.4% of GDP in 2016 to 3.0% in 2017. This,
however, was counterbalanced by a surge in the
services balance in 2017, which picked up
substantially (about +0.5 pps. of GDP) and lifted
the current account surplus.

Over the forecast horizon, global economic
activity is expected to slow down, while global
import elasticity is expected to moderate gradually
from high levels in tandem with abating
investment growth globally. Euro area export
markets are projected to grow at 3.9% in 2019 and
3.6% in 2020, surpassing economic growth outside
the euro area in 2019, but lagging slightly behind it
in 2020. As increases in export prices in 2019 and
2020 broadly match the increases in import prices,
the euro area’s terms of trade should remain
broadly neutral over the next two years, with a
slight deterioration in 2019 and a marginal
improvement in 2020. Deteriorated price
competitiveness, as measured by the real effective
exchange rate based on unit labour costs, is set to
weigh on the euro area’s export performance.
The broad stabilisation of the current account
surplus over the forecast horizon is expected to be
the result of different developments in the
saving/investment relationships in the private
sector and in the public sector that broadly offset
each other. Private sector net lending is expected
to continue slowly receding in 2019 and 2020, as
investment levels remain robust and gross saving
increases only marginally. Net borrowing by the
public sector has been falling thanks to the
increasing public sector saving rate and is set to be
broadly balanced by the end of the forecast period.

The euro area current account surplus is set to

In the past few years, a growing number of
Member States have contributed to the euro area’s
current account surplus. In 2017, 15 euro area
Member States posted positive balances. However,
the main contributors to the surplus remain the
Netherlands and Germany, which together
accounted for about 80% of the euro area’s overall
current account surplus (see Graph I.40). Over the
forecast horizon, their combined share is expected
to decline as smaller euro area Member States are
forecast to contribute more to the current account
surplus in both relative and absolute terms.

a short period of rebalancing (e.g. Latvia,
Lithuania, Portugal), while Malta, the Netherlands,
Germany and Slovenia are forecast to maintain
large current account surpluses of at least 5% of

Belgium and Finland are expected to improve and

Labour market conditions improved further in
2018…

Labour market conditions have continued to
improve in the first half of 2018. Employment has
been rising further, both in terms of the number of
persons and the number of hours worked. The
unemployment rate has been declining further and
broader indicators show that underemployment
(e.g. involuntary part-time work) also has been
receding.
In the four quarters up to mid-2018, employment
in the euro area increased by 1.6% from the four
preceding quarters and thus at the same pace as in
2017. Despite slower GDP growth in the first half
of 2018, headcount employment continued to
expand robustly at an unchanged rate of 0.4%
quarter-on-quarter in both the first and the second
quarter of 2018. Reflecting the ongoing rapid
improvement in labour market conditions, the
number of people employed in the euro area in the
second quarter of 2018 stood 2.4% above the precrisis peak recorded in the first quarter of 2008.
Employment reached a new record level with more
than 158 million people in work. The recent

Employment has been rising uninterruptedly since
2013, benefitting from the ongoing economic
expansion, modest wage growth, structural reforms
and specific policy measures in some countries. In
terms of the number of hours worked, however, the
current economic expansion has been less
impressive (Graph I.43). Hours worked per person
employed increased by 0.3% in the second quarter
of this year and even declined in the first. The
average hours worked during the expansion have
remained broadly stable so far while total hours
worked remain below pre-crisis levels. This can be
explained by the large share of part-time workers
in total employment as well as changes in the
sectoral composition of employment.

At the same time, labour supply has expanded
rapidly over the past few years. This is mainly
thanks to increasing participation rates, but
migration within the EU towards Member States
with low unemployment and net migration into the
EU, have also contributed. (49) The labour force in
the euro area and the EU grew strongly in 2017
(+0.5% and +0.6% respectively) compared to the
rise in the total population, which lifted the activity
rate further. The rise in labour market participation
rates now evident for over a decade, mainly
reflects increased activity among older people
(55-64) and a parallel decline in the share of
younger cohorts (15-24). In 2017 the participation
rate hit 77.3% (76.6% in the EU).

More recently, the strength of employment growth
has brought the multiyear rise in the share of parttime employment to a halt (see Graph I.44).

…and the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year
low in the summer 2018.

Driven by the rise in employment, unemployment
in the euro area and the EU fell further over the
summer to 8.1% and 6.8% respectively, their
lowest levels since 2008.
(49)

For example, the Institute for Employment Research (IAB),
the Research Institute of the Federal Employment Agency
in Germany, reports a total net migration into Germany
between 2014 and 2017 of 3.1 million of which net
migration from non-EU countries was 1.8 million.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

Between January and August 2018, unemployment
rates fell for men and women of all age groups. In
August 2018, the youth unemployment rate fell to
16.6% in the euro area and 14.8% in the EU, their
lowest since end-2008. In parallel, long and verylong-term unemployment (those unemployed for a
year or more; or for at least two years) have
continued decreasing, benefiting from the
favourable labour market developments and the
ongoing economic expansion. The share of longterm unemployed in total unemployment is still
high (43% in the first quarter of 2018 in the EU,
47.3% in the euro area respectively) but is slowly
decreasing.
Meanwhile in the euro area, economic slack in the
labour market, as measured by broader measures
of unemployment (i.e. involuntary part-time,
people who do not search actively, or who are not
available to take a job within two weeks), has
diminished further (see Graph I.45). After five
years of economic expansion, fewer and fewer
workers are available on the side-lines. Yet, the
euro area aggregate masks some large disparities
among Member States.

…while an adjustment of job creation to the
pace of economic growth appears to be
underway…

Labour market conditions are projected to improve
further over the next two years, but at a more
moderate pace than in the previous two.
Employment creation should continue to benefit
from growing economic activity and wage growth
levels that, though higher than recent years, remain
moderate. In some countries, structural reforms
and labour market policies will also play an
important role. The pace of job creation over the
next two years, however, is projected to moderate
as labour shortages increase and GDP growth
slows.

The short-term outlook remains favourable…

The Commission’s quarterly surveys indicate that
firms are facing challenges from a tightening
labour market. The share of euro area and EU
firms mentioning the availability of labour as a
factor limiting production in the industry, the
services and construction sector stood at
(construction) or close (manufacturing and
services) has almost steadily increased in recent
years (see Graph I.47).

Short-term indicators pointed to continuing
strength in the labour market at the end of the third
quarter of 2018, even if a slight but noticeable
decline has been registered since the beginning of
2018. The hiring intentions of firms remained well

Additional evidence of binding labour shortages
comes from the unmet demand for labour, as
expressed by the job vacancy rate. It has broadly
risen since late 2014 in the euro area and reached
its highest value since 2006 at 2.1% in the first

In some countries (e.g. in Germany, Belgium and
the Netherlands) and sectors (e.g. construction in
Germany), the availability of labour has already
become a concern for companies and labour
shortages have risen up the list of factors that
constrain further economic growth.

job vacancies rate and the decrease in
unemployment could also be linked to increased
mismatches, i.e. an outward shift of the Beveridge
curve (see Box I.4).

The labour market situation has improved in all

apparent (see Graph I.48).

Following its cyclical pattern, labour productivity
is projected to rebound only slightly in the euro
area and the EU as the economic expansion
remains job-rich. Labour productivity should grow

compared to 0.6% and 0.8% respectively in 2018.

…the unemployment rate should continue to
recede but more slowly…

The labour force is expected to continue expanding
over the next two years, though its growth should
moderate slightly from 0.6% in 2018 to 0.4% in
2020 in the euro area, and from 0.5% in 2018 to
0.4% in the EU. The increase in the labour force is
set to be supported by the net immigration of
workers in regions with strong job opportunities,
the expected integration of refugees, and ongoing
increases in labour market participation rates.
Reflecting the slowdown in the pace of job
creation and the continued growth of the labour
force at strong rates, unemployment should
continue to decline but more slowly than in recent
years. With job creation increasing twice as
quickly as the labour force, unemployment rates in
both the euro area and the EU should fall towards
their pre-crisis troughs and below the NAWRU
level. In the euro area, the unemployment rate is
forecast to fall to 7.5% in 2020 after 7.9% in 2019
and 8.4% in 2018.

energy inflation are expected to remain until the
first quarter of 2019 before slowly tapering off.

INFLATION

Inflation in the euro area, as measured by the
Harmonised Index of Consumer prices (HICP),
averaged 2.1% in the third quarter of 2018, its
highest level since the fourth quarter of 2012 and
slightly more than forecast in the summer
(Graph I.49). Headline inflation has been driven
mainly by the continued rise in energy prices,
which topped 9% during the summer months when
oil prices rose. Elevated food price inflation which
averaged 2.5% (food, alcohol and tobacco
category) in the third quarter, also played a role.
Although the effect of energy prices was to some
extent expected, given base effects compared to
last year’s energy price levels, the continued rise in
oil prices and the drop in the euro exchange rate
against the US dollar since mid-April, have added
further upward pressure on inflation. These
developments largely explain the upward revision
in headline inflation for 2018 and the first half of
2019. Core inflation, which excludes energy and
unprocessed food prices, by contrast, has remained
subdued and the pass-through of higher wage
growth to underlying price pressures is expected to
be gradual and to take longer than previously
expected.

Inflation rose above 2% in the summer, driven

HICP inflation this year has been rising and
exceeded 2% in the third quarter. It is expected to
remain at similar levels at least until the end of the
year. From an average of 1.3% in the first quarter,
it increased to 1.7% in the second and jumped to
2.1% in the third quarter. Energy prices continue to

Brent oil prices seem to have stabilised and moved
in a narrow range over the summer. Recently,
however, they rose again slightly above 80 USD
/bbl (at the cut-off date of 22 October), the highest
levels recorded this year. As a result, oil price
assumptions have been revised higher since the
summer and so too their expected impact on
headline inflation. According to the revised
technical assumptions, the price of Brent oil is
expected to peak in the last quarter of 2018 but
should remain relatively stable in 2019 before
falling marginally in 2020 (see Section I.2). The
revisions are larger in euro terms due to the
depreciation of the euro against the US dollar,
which is the main currency used for trading oil
(see Graph I.50). Given the high share of USDdenominated oil imports in the euro area, the
depreciation of the euro against the dollar is likely
to drive import prices in the euro area further
upwards, even though the picture varies quite a lot
from country to country. These two factors largely
explain the upward revision for headline inflation
in 2018 and the first half of 2019, while in 2020
the technical assumptions lead to a phasing out of
base effects in energy inflation.

Following past episodes of substantial oil price
increases between 2007 and 2008 and between
2009 and 2011, the increase in energy inflation
was followed by a notable acceleration in
processed food prices and, to a smaller extent,
service prices (which contains sub-components
like transport services which are sensitive to oil
price movements). The impact of progressively
higher oil prices on non-energy industrial goods
inflation appears less uniform, even if oil prices

more relevant factor for this category. In the case
of unprocessed food inflation, the determining
factor may be supply factors, especially weather
and harvesting conditions, given that this category
is usually a staple of household demand and
perishable goods (see Box I.1).

…yet core inflation remains subdued…

Despite the notable increase in the headline rate,
core inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed
food prices) has been rather muted and moved only
little so far this year. It has also been weaker than
expected in the summer interim forecast despite
the uptick in wages and the projected closure of
the output gap in most euro area economies. Core
inflation averaged 1.2% in the third quarter,
broadly the same as in the first and second
quarters.
Services inflation - the main component of
domestic price pressures with a weighting of
around 55% in the core consumption basket and
usually correlated with wage growth – has been
relatively contained, rising by only about 1.3%
since the beginning of the year. In September, it
fell again to slightly below 1.3%, from 1.4% in
July and 1.3% in August. Thus the average for the
third quarter stood at similar levels to the second,
and slightly below the first quarter. Somewhat
puzzlingly, service prices related to housing (with
a weight of around 10% in the consumption
basket), have been stable since 2016 (see
Graph I.51). This is despite the fact that actual
house prices have been on an upward trend for at
least the past five years and have increased by
around 4% in the euro area in 2017 alone, and
even more in some regions with risks of
overheating. An increase in house prices tends to
shift demand towards renting due to declining
affordability, consequently putting upward
pressure on rents. So far, the reported growth in
house prices is not having the expected impact on
this component of inflation, because rising

…and pipeline pressures remain modest.

Likewise, non-energy industrial goods inflation
has not registered any discernible trend. In 2018 it
has hovered around last year’s average rate of
0.4%, suggesting competitive pricing pressures
along domestic supply chains despite a context of
rising oil prices and generally high capacity
utilisation across the euro area, as reported by
corporate survey respondents. Industrial producer
prices excluding energy have also remained
modest overall, with some differences within the
categories. Non-durable consumer goods inflation
slowed during the year to zero in August, while
durable consumer goods and intermediate goods
inflation firmed to 1.3% and 3.2%, respectively.
Total industrial producer prices increased to 4.2%
in the same month, driven disproportionally higher
by energy producer prices (12%) (see Graph I.52).
Industrial import prices have firmed throughout the
year, standing at 5.5% in August - reflecting
mainly the steep increase in the energy category
and the decline of the euro against the US dollar –
but have so far had only a limited pass-through on
domestic pipeline price pressures.

On the other hand, processed food inflation
including alcohol and tobacco (considered as part
of core inflation in the European Commission’s
analysis) peaked at 3% in April, before moderating
to 2.3% in September. While the processed food
category is less volatile than unprocessed food
inflation because of the latter’s perishability and
higher sensitivity to weather and harvesting
conditions, it demonstrates rather strong and
lagged correlation with energy inflation (see
Graph I.53).

Further out, underlying inflation in the euro area is
expected to become the main driver of headline
inflation. Over the course of 2019 and 2020, it is
set to gradually gather pace as labour markets
progressively tighten further, wages rise more
strongly and the output gap remains in positive
territory. While the increase in wage growth in the
first half of 2018 (Graph I.54) was broadly
expected with tighter labour markets clearly
evident in some economies and industries (see
Section I.6), the pass-through to domestic prices
has so far been rather weak.

Inflation to remain close to 2% in the short
term…

The near-term outlook for inflation remains under
the influence of base effects in energy in line with
commodity price assumptions and to a smaller
extent in food prices until the first half of 2019
where headline inflation is projected to stay at
levels close to 2%. The impact of higher oil prices
on headline inflation is expected to gradually taper
off next year as base effects fade away. However,
the strong upward trend in oil prices in 2018 is

into higher core inflation looks delayed.

expected to have some lagged impact on the other
components of inflation sensitive to oil prices, as
producers respond to higher input costs and
capacity constraints. Moreover, in 2019, changes
in taxes and administered prices in some countries
are also expected to influence the quarterly
inflation pattern. On average, headline inflation in
the euro area is forecast at 1.8% both in 2018 and
in 2019.

Negotiated wages

Hourly compensation (swda)
Compensation per employee (swda)

This can be seen, for example, in the growing gap
between the growth of compensation per employee
– which increased noticeably in the first half of
2018, standing at 2.3% in the second quarter - and
recent service inflation. Historically, the two are
closely correlated, since the part of wages in
overall service costs is large (see Graph I.55).
Growth in compensation per employee in the euro
area is projected at 2.0% in 2019, a decline
compared to a robust 2.3% increase in 2018. The
forecast for 2019, however, is strongly affected by
the replacement of the CICE (Tax Credit for
Competitiveness and Employment) in France (see

EA and EU outlook

Section II.10) - which is recorded as a subsidy to
firms until the end of 2018- by a permanent
reduction in social security contributions in 2019.
Accordingly, the change reduces the contribution
of employers in total compensation but not the
wages and salaries component; thus it should not
have an impact on the take-home pay of
households per se. In the rest of the euro area (i.e.
the euro area excluding France), compensation per
employee is expected to increase by around 2½%
next year. In 2020, compensation per employee is
projected at 2.4% in the euro area as a whole. The
growth of real compensation of employees, after
deducting for inflation, should remain positive
throughout the forecast horizon.

Inflation expectations

indicators

stabilised

After increasing in line with developments in oil
prices earlier this year, market-based measures of
inflation expectations have been moving sideways
despite inflation data coming in above expectations
over the summer. This suggests that markets
expect the current rate of energy inflation to be
temporary. At the cut-off date of this forecast,
inflation-linked swap rates at the one-year forward
one-year-ahead horizon stood at 1.4% (see
Graph I.56). Swap rates at the three-year forward
three-years-ahead horizon imply an average
inflation of 1.5%. On a longer horizon, the widely
watched five-year forward five-years-ahead
indicator suggests inflation of 1.7%, slightly below
the ECB’s definition of price stability in the
medium term.

As a result of the increase in compensation per
employee growth this year, unit labour cost growth
in the euro area is expected to increase
substantially to 1.6% in 2018. In 2019, a decrease
to 1.2% is projected that can be associated with the
CICE measure in France. In 2020, unit labour costs
are projected to increase by 1.5%. These rates
essentially bring unit labour cost growth to levels
similar to those observed before the crisis, 10 years
ago. Labour productivity growth in the euro area is
expected to remain relatively stable at around ¾%
over the forecast horizon.
The outlook for inflation will therefore hinge in
part on the extent to which further wage growth
translates into higher domestic underlying
inflation, especially after the projected impact of
oil price base effects has run its course in the first
quarter of 2019. This translation is expected to
happen gradually with the impact of higher wages
on inflation becoming more pronounced only
towards late 2019. Thus, headline inflation in the
euro area is expected to average 1.6% in 2020,

Survey-based measures of inflation expectations
have continued to trend slowly upwards.
According to the Commission’s surveys, selling
price expectations in manufacturing edged up
higher in the third quarter of 2018 while that for
services stabilised, with both indicators standing
above their long-term average. Consumers also
reported higher price trends over the past twelve
months. Price expectations in the construction
sector remain high. Euro area PMI indexes for
October show price pressures building up along
the supply chain, consistent with a gradual increase
in inflation. The assessment of average selling
prices in both the manufacturing and services
sectors suggest inflation at a more solid clip.
The monthly mean of market forecasters calculated
by Consensus Economics stood in October at 1.7%
for both 2018 and 2019. The results of the ECB

51

expectations at 1.7% in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2023)
remained at 1.9%.

Inflation differentials to narrow

Aggregate HICP inflation rates continue to mask
substantial differences across euro area Member
States (Graph I.57). While temporary inflation
differentials are usually not seen as a matter of
concern, persistent inflation differentials have been
among the factors behind the build-up of past
imbalances (e.g. price and cost imbalances) in the
euro area. By contrast, the narrowing of inflation
differentials helps to make financial conditions, as
measured by real interest rates, more similar across
euro area countries.

and Member States (2016-2020)

%

Outside the euro area, inflation differentials are
more pronounced; by the fourth quarter of 2020,
headline inflation rates are projected to range from
1.5% in Croatia to 3.3% in Romania.
PUBLIC FINANCES

In 2017, the aggregate public deficit of the euro
area continued to fall, supported by robust
economic growth and low interest rates. The
decline in the aggregate deficit is projected to
continue in 2018 before coming to a halt in 2019,
for the first time since 2009. Following a slight
improvement in 2017, the structural balance (50) of
the euro area is expected to stabilise in 2018 and to
worsen slightly in 2019 (see Graph I.58). Debt-toGDP ratios are projected to fall in almost all
Member States over the forecast period, driven by
primary surpluses and nominal GDP growth
outpacing interest payments on outstanding debt.

In each period, the bars for all 19 euro area economies are ranked by size.

By the fourth quarter of 2020, HICP inflation rates
at or above the euro area annual average of 1.6%
are projected in all euro area economies, except
Italy, Ireland, Greece and Cyprus. In 2020, seven
euro area Member States are expected to
experience inflation at or above 2%; mostly those
small euro area countries which are growing
strongly and still converging towards average price
levels. With most countries projected to record
inflation rates within a narrower range, the
dispersion of inflation rates, as measured in terms
of the unweighted standard deviation, is expected
to decline further. The spread between the highest
and lowest inflation rate across the euro area is
also set to fall to a post-crisis low.

Continued economic growth and low interest
rates continue to support public finances…

In 2017, the aggregate general government balance
improved by more than half a percentage point of
GDP in the euro area and in the EU, to -1.0% of
GDP in both (Table I.8). The aggregate budget
balance is projected to further improve in 2018
to -0.6% of GDP in the euro area and -0.7% in the
EU respectively, thanks to a reduction in interest
expenditure. This compares with budget balance
projections of -5.8% of GDP in the US and -3.3%
in Japan.
(50)

The structural balance corrects the headline balance for
both cyclical, one-off and temporary budgetary factors, and
hence isolates the impact of discretionary government
policy action and interest expenditure.

European Commission.

The forecast for 2019, which for euro area
Member States takes into account the measures
announced in the Draft Budgetary Plans in October
2018, points to a slight decline in the aggregate
budget balance (to -0.8% of GDP in the EU
and -0.8% in the euro area), which implies the first
deterioration in the headline budget balance since
2009. Nevertheless, budget balances are now
considerably lower than 10 years ago, as in 2009
they had reached a trough of -6.6% of GDP in the
EU and -6.2% in the euro area.
In 2020, the aggregate budget deficit is set to
decline again slightly, based on a no-policy-change
assumption. Looking at the drivers of the change
in the aggregate budget balance of the euro area
(see Graph I.59), the change in the cyclical
component of the budget is set to remain positive
over the entire 2018-2020 forecast period, since
actual economic growth is forecast to outpace
potential growth. (51) A positive contribution is also
expected from falling interest expenditure in 2018.
Conversely, the change in the structural primary
balance is projected to contribute negatively in
2019, due to looser discretionary fiscal policies.(52)
Finally, one-off measures are set to have a
negative impact on the aggregate budget balance in
2019 but to have a positive impact in 2020.(53)
(51)

(52)
(53)

More specifically, the change in the cyclical component is
set to give a positive contribution of around 0.3 pps. of
GDP in 2018, 0.1 pp. in 2019 and 0.1 pp. in 2020.
The aggregate structural primary balance is projected to
deteriorate by 0.3 pps. in 2019 and stabilise in 2020.
In 2019, sizeable negative one-offs are expected to affect
the budget balance in France (see Section II.10 for more
details). Examples of typical one-offs include revenues
from tax amnesty and from sales of non-financial assets,
and expenditure related to short-term emergency costs or to
the financial crisis (for more information on one-off
measures see European Commission (DG ECFIN). (2015).

Paper 14).

Budgetary outcomes are forecast to be mixed
among individual Member States. While around
half of EU Member States are expected to keep
their budget balance in surplus over the forecast
period, some Member States are projected to
maintain rather large public deficits. Among them,
Romania is set to post a deficit of over 3% of GDP
in 2018 and 2019 and over 4% in 2020; Italy is
expected to run a deficit close to 3% of GDP in
2019 and over 3% in 2020, under a no-policy
change assumption. A deficit greater than 2% of
GDP is expected in Spain and France in 2018 and
2019.
Over the forecast period, both revenue and
expenditure ratios are set to decline at aggregate
level in the EU and the euro area (see Table I.8). In
particular, the aggregate expenditure-to-GDP ratio
of the euro area is projected to fall by 0.9 pps.
(from 47.0% in 2017 to 46.1% in 2020). The
decline is partly explained by lower interest
expenditure, which is set to fall from 2.0% of GDP
in 2017 to 1.8% in 2020. In addition, labour
market developments are expected to reduce
spending on unemployment benefits (see also
Section I.6). The remainder of the fall in the

The revenue-to-GDP ratio of the euro area
aggregate is projected to decline by 0.6 pps. over
the forecast period (from 46.1% in 2017 to 45.5%
in 2020), mainly reflecting the projected fall in
social contributions. This decline is largely due to
the impact of discretionary measures taken by
governments,
while
underlying
revenue
developments appear to be in line with the
projected increase in nominal GDP. (56)

(55)

In terms of the quality of public spending, the
aggregate public investment-to-GDP ratio in the
euro area is projected to increase marginally, from
2.6% in 2017 to 2.7% in 2018-2019 and 2.8% in
2020, which is still below its pre-crisis average
(3.2% of GDP over 2000-2007). (55) Public
investment is expected to benefit from the
implementation of the 2014-2020 programming
period of EU funding, as well as from the
Investment Plan for Europe. Positive cyclical
developments are set to reduce the weight of social
transfers as a share of total general government
expenditure in the euro area aggregate by 2020,
despite additional discretionary spending in some
Member States. The weight of the wage bill on
public expenditure is set to stabilise by 2020 (see
Graph I.61).

(54)

0.3

By comparison, the primary expenditure ratio of the euro
area is set to remain broadly stable over 2017-2020 when
computed in terms of potential GDP.
By 2020, the fall in public investment relative to the precrisis period would remain sizeable in Spain and Portugal
(about -2 pps. of GDP), Ireland and Malta (about -1.5 pps.),
Greece and Italy (about -1 pp.).
For further details on expenditure and revenues elasticities
see Mourre, G., C. Astarita and S. Princen (2014).

…with the debt ratio remaining on a declining
path.

The aggregate general government debt-to-GDP
ratio of the euro area has been on a declining path
since 2014 (see Table I.9), when it reached a peak
of 94.2% (88.1% in the EU). In 2017, the debt
ratio fell to 88.9% (83.2% in the EU) and is
projected to fall further over the forecast period to
reach 82.8% in 2020 (77.6% in the EU), under a
no-policy-change assumption. In the euro area, the
deleveraging of the government sector is supported
by low interest rates paid on debt and robust
nominal GDP growth, implying a debt-decreasing
snowball effect. (57) Over the forecast period,
positive cyclical conditions should also help to
keep a debt-decreasing primary surplus of around
1.0% of GDP for the euro area aggregate on
average (see Graph I.62). Over 2018-2020, the
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase only in
Romania, due to a large primary deficit. The debt
ratio is now forecast to remain relatively stable in
Italy, where the snowball effect is projected to
provide a debt-increasing contribution.
The debt-to-GDP ratio in 2020 is expected to
remain above 100% in three Member States
(Greece, Italy, and Portugal), and above 90% in
four others (Belgium, Spain, France and Cyprus).

EU methodology’. European Commission (DG ECFIN),

The snowball effect is the impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio
provided by the difference between nominal growth and
the implicit interest rates paid on debt. Specifically, in the
euro area aggregate, nominal GDP growth is projected to
average 3.6% over 2018-2020 and thus outpace the average
interest rate paid on debt, which is set at 2.2%. As a result,
the snowball effect is expected to help reduce the debt
ratio.

THE

Monetary conditions in the euro area remain very
accommodative, overall. Based on the standard
technical assumptions, (58) short-term money
market rates will remain unchanged for the
remainder of 2018 before increasing gradually in
2019 but they should remain very low overall in
both nominal and real terms. In addition, a further
gradual
increase
in
long-term
inflation
expectations should keep real long-term financing
costs negative. As regards the fiscal policy stance,
as measured by the change in the structural budget
balance, it turned broadly neutral in 2015 and is
expected to remain so in 2018. In 2019, the
aggregate fiscal policy stance of the euro area is
set to become slightly expansionary.
(58)

The interest rate assumptions underlying the forecast are
market-based; nominal exchange rates are assumed to
remain constant with respect to a given base period. For
details, see Box I.5.

Monetary conditions are expected to remain
accommodative

The assumed gradual pace of monetary policy
normalisation by the ECB, in conjunction with
continued economic growth in the euro area and
gradually strengthening core inflation should put
some upward pressure on nominal rates over the
forecast horizon. Nonetheless, given that rates are
low at present and that the rate of normalisation is
expected to be only very gradual, financing
conditions in the euro area should remain very
loose by historical standards. Accordingly,
nominal long-term rates, which have decreased
somewhat since the spring, started to pick up again
in August and September and are expected to
continue to trend up modestly. The high stock of
assets purchased under the Expanded Asset
Purchase Programme (EAPP) in the Eurosystem’s
balance sheet, in combination with the continued
reinvestment of maturing securities, should ensure
that nominal long-term rates stay low, overall. (59)
On the short end of the yield curve, high excess
liquidity should keep short-term money market
rates at very low levels and support favourable
lending conditions further on. Indeed, in the
money market, the overnight rate (EONIA) has
continued to trade only slightly above the ECB’s
deposit facility rate in recent months, reflecting the
high and still-growing excess liquidity in the
banking system. Similarly, the three-month
Euribor has stayed near its record lows since
spring.
In real terms, short-term rates have decreased
considerably since the end of the first quarter of
2018, reflecting the rise in headline inflation since
(59)

Empirical evidence suggests that the portfolio rebalancing
effect of asset purchases on bond market yields works
predominantly via the size of the stock of purchased assets
rather than the size of the monthly flows.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

May (see Graph I.63). (60) Real long-term interest
rates, which have been negative since mid-2014,
decreased somewhat in the second quarter before
edging higher again in August and September.
This behaviour mirrors the developments in
nominal rates that were amplified somewhat by
opposite movements in longer-term inflation
expectations.

The transmission of these developments to
nominal financing conditions in the non-financial
private sector is captured by the composite credit
cost indicators (CCCI) (61) for non-financial
corporations and households (see Graph I.64), for
which developments at the long end of the term
structure typically dominate. In line with the
gradual changes in nominal money market rates,
developments in credit costs have been rather
muted since the spring. While credit costs have
decreased marginally in net terms for households
on account of slightly lower rates on housing
loans, the CCCI for non-financial corporations has
edged up marginally from very low levels,
reflecting both an increase in corporate sector bond
yields and somewhat higher bank lending rates for
medium-term loans.

Looking ahead, overnight rates are assumed to
remain close to current levels until the second
quarter of 2019 and to increase rather gradually
thereafter, as suggested by EONIA forward rates.
At the time of writing, markets had fully priced in
a 10 bp. rate hike only for autumn 2019. This is
broadly in line with the ECB Governing Council’s
forward guidance, according to which interest rates
are expected to remain at present levels at least
through the summer of 2019. As inflation is
expected to remain at its current level for the
remainder of the year and decrease somewhat over
the course of 2019 and 2020, this should lead to a
roughly flat profile for real short-term interest rates
for the remainder of 2018, and a gradual increase
in the following years. Nonetheless, real short-term
rates should remain clearly negative. At the same
time, forward rates suggest a continued gradual
rise in nominal long-term rates over the forecast
horizon, which should also translate into higher,
but still negative, real long-term rates, as long-term
inflation expectations increase at a much slower
pace.

Fiscal policy broadly neutral in 2018 and
slightly expansionary in 2019

Following the strong consolidation achieved
between 2011 and 2014, the fiscal policy stance in
the euro area has been neutral overall since 2015
and is expected to remain broadly so in 2018. In
2019, the euro area fiscal policy stance is projected
to become slightly expansionary (see Graph I.65).

The discretionary fiscal effort, (62) an alternative
indicator to assess the fiscal policy stance shows a
slightly expansionary fiscal stance between 2018
and 2020. The negative fiscal effort mainly reflects
discretionary revenue cuts, also visible in the
reduction in the structural revenue ratio (see

to increase more than medium-term potential

The policy mix in the euro area in 2018 reflects the
interplay between financing conditions and fiscal
policy (see Graph I.69). On the monetary side, the
additional measures taken by the ECB since the
end of 2014 have exerted a significant downward
pressure on nominal long-term rates in recent years
and real long-term interest rates are anticipated to
remain in negative territory over the forecast
horizon. However, monetary easing has only been
partially transmitted to real rates, as long-term
inflation expectations also declined over the same
period and only started to pick up towards the end
of 2016. Meanwhile, the continued appreciation of
the euro in recent years has had a slight tightening
effect on broader monetary conditions in the euro
area.

For 2018, average real long-term rates (derived
from the 10-year swap rate deflated by inflation
expectations) are expected to be only slightly
higher than in the previous year. They are expected
to increase further in 2019 in the context of
monetary policy normalisation, albeit at a gradual
pace. Thus, overall financing conditions should
remain very supportive. At the same time, the
overall fiscal policy stance is expected to remain
slightly supportive for growth.
RISKS

The EU economy is facing a very high level of
uncertainty, including with respect to economic
policies and future trading relationships. At the
same time, the downside risks surrounding the
central scenario are characterised by a high degree
of interconnectedness, which could magnify their
impact on the EU economy. These risks are more
likely to materialise in 2020 than before. Overall,
risks to the growth outlook are skewed to the
downside.
Increasing uncertainties could weigh more
heavily on economic growth

Uncertainties have increased since the start of the
year, mainly with respect to trade policies and the
future of multilateralism. The latter is evident in
the US where trade policy uncertainty has
substantially increased as trade rhetoric escalated
and trade tensions intensified in 2018 (see
Graph I.70). Furthermore, the upcoming electoral
cycles in the US create some uncertainty with
regard to the US fiscal policy stance in 2020.

Economic policy uncertainty

These uncertainties are already weighing on
economic growth in the euro area, but it cannot be
excluded that the effects could turn out to be
stronger than currently expected.
Uncertainty affects various segments of the
economy, including investment where it could lead
companies to delay or reduce investment spending,
and private consumption, where consumers could
increase precautionary savings. The negative
impact of uncertainty on investment could lower
the efficient allocation of resources as the most
productive firms abstain from expanding; market
entry of new firms is delayed; or production
chains, particularly cross-border chains, are
reconsidered in anticipation of distortionary trade
policy decisions, for example.
While the central scenario takes into account all
effects that are sufficiently assessable, uncertainty
about the magnitude and timing of further
protectionist measures and counter measures
means that not all potential effects are
incorporated. Thereby the elevated uncertainty
adds to the margin of errors that is unavoidably
involved in all macroeconomic forecasts.
Downside risks are highly interconnected…

Since the forecast in spring, some risks have fully
or partly materialised and entered the central
scenario, such as the introduction of additional
protectionist measures. Nevertheless, in autumn,
the risks to the GDP growth forecast are wider
than before and they remain tilted to the downside.
The main downside risks to the economic growth
forecast are closely interconnected, and could
amplify each other.

EA and EU outlook

Risks to the growth projections originate from
several major sources: (a) In the US, an
overheating in the near-term and a faster monetary
tightening as well as an abrupt reversal of fiscal
policy in 2020, could lead to a sharper deceleration
of the economy; (b) In emerging markets financial
turmoil could spill over more widely if a sharp
tightening of global financial conditions were to
raise debt servicing costs and increase refinancing
risks, particularly in countries with large dollardenominated debt, which could lead to capital
outflows that would damage growth and financial
stability with possible contagion effects to Europe;
(c) Across countries, a further escalation of trade
conflicts could weigh on trade flows and distort
cross-border production links; (d) In China, several
triggers could derail the economic rebalancing
towards a more services and consumption-based
growth model, including the effects of trade
tensions and political instability linked to a further
increase in debt in a context of already high public
and corporate debt; (e) In the euro area, there are
risks from financial tensions linked to the
resumption of sovereign-bank loops; and (f) In
Europe, the outcome of the Brexit negotiations
could lead to a more disruptive impact on the EUUK trade relationship than currently envisaged
under the purely technical assumption on trade
relations after the UK’s exit from the EU.
These areas are closely related and the risks,
should they materialise, could not only trigger the
materialisation of other risks, but could also
amplify each other (see Graph I.71). With
vulnerabilities in a number of EU Member States
linked to high levels of public and private debt,
and in some cases, impaired bank balance sheets,
the impact on economic growth could be large.

For example, overheating in the US could lead the
Fed to tighten monetary policy faster than
assumed. This could alter the risk attitude of
investors with detrimental effects on the US
economy given the high level of corporate
leverage. It would also hit emerging market
economies and result in negative spillovers to
advanced economies. The ensuing deterioration of
the US current account could also lead to a further
escalation of trade disputes. This could particularly
hit China, where high and rising corporate debt
represents a financial fragility, which could be
further aggravated if Chinese authorities respond
by carrying out domestic stimulus or depreciate the
currency in response to foreign trade
protectionism. The attempt to shore up growth via
domestic policies would heighten the risk of a
disorderly adjustment. Such shocks could add up
and negatively impact on global trade and activity,
disrupting cross-border supply chains.
As a relatively open economy with strong trade
links and banks exposed to emerging markets, the
EU would suffer. A key transmission channel from
the US to Europe could operate via term premia,
which are usually highly correlated across
sovereigns. While the US monetary tightening
cycle has so far seen a compression of term premia
to the lowest levels in a decade, a sudden rise in
US term premia could also impact on long-term
interest rates in Europe and thereby negatively
affect interest-rate sensitive spending decisions in
Europe.
As regards rising protectionism and the retreat
from multilateralism, the central scenario of the
forecast assumes that a further escalation of trade
disputes will be avoided. But tariffs in place so far
may only be the tip of the iceberg relative to those
under review or threatened. Non-tariff trade
barriers (e.g. rules on the production of goods) and
the size of tariff rates come to mind, and even
threatened tariffs can have a negative impact. They
would challenge the international production
fragmentation that has been one of the most
important features of globalisation in recent
decades. (63) Additionally imposed tariffs or higher
tariff rates would not only have a direct impact on
global growth, they could also exert negative
effects via secondary transmission channels that
amplify the negative impacts of an escalation in a
(63)

Empircial studies of the quantitative impact of supply chain
disruptions are rare; some are related to natural disasters,
e.g. A. Kondo (2018). ‘The effects of supply chain
disruptions caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake on
workers’. Japan and the World Economy 47, pp. 40–50.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

tit for tat trade war. Such secondary transmission
channels via global supply chains have the
potential to substantially amplify negative drags
from tariffs, even if the nominal amounts are low.
In the euro area, overly expansionary fiscal
policies insufficiently addressing potential growth
objectives could create doubts about fiscal
sustainability in high-debt countries. Concerns
about sovereign debt paths risk fuelling a
decompression of risk premia and could lead to a
more general repricing of risks that could hit
sovereigns and spread through the banking
system. (64) Such a risk reappraisal could cause
sovereign-bank loops (65) between vulnerable
banks, indebted sovereigns and weak economies to
take hold in some high-debt euro area countries,
most notably Italy, as financing costs for the
banking sector would increase and the repair of
bank balance sheets would be hampered. Although
unconventional monetary policy in the euro area
has altered the link between fundamentals and
spreads, (66) sovereign-bank loops could hurt the
real economy via higher interest rates and reduced
credit supply due to increased leveraging needs for
banks. Moreover, such events could hurt economic
sentiment, which would further weigh on
economic activity and could imply that measures
taken with the aim of stimulating economic
activity could actually have an adverse impact.
Given the ongoing negotiations on the terms of the
UK’s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019, and
a proposed transition period until the end of 2020,

Empirical studies found an asymmetric causality from
sovereign bonds to other bonds; see P. Augustin et al.
(2018). ‘Sovereign to corporate risk spillovers’. Journal of

analysis including the largest euro area economies, see M.

A recent analysis concluded that correlation between banks

completion of Banking Union; see Bank of Finland (2018).
‘How has the feedback loop between banks and sovereigns
changed since the crisis?’. Bank of Finland Bulletin 1,
pp. 38–43.
The ECB’s unconventional monetary policy has been
found to have reduced the responsiveness of spreads to
their fundamental determinants, see e.g. A. Afonso et al.

the forecast for 2019 and 2020 is based on the
purely technical assumption of status quo in terms
of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK.
The uncertainty around the future status of the UK
outside the EU is expected to weigh on UK
growth. There are large downside risks to the
forecast, particularly in the case of a no deal
scenario. The results of relevant studies generally
show that Brexit is a lose-lose situation
economically. As there is no frictionless trade
outside the EU customs union and single market,
trade between EU27 Member States and the UK
will be affected by Brexit. Under any scenario, the
impact is expected to be much larger on the UK
than on the EU27 overall. The EU27 is preparing
for any scenario. (67)
…widens the range of possible outcomes…

In addition to the aforementioned strong downside
risks that surround the global outlook, including
the euro area outlook, a number of risks identified
in previous forecast rounds remains in place. They
include heightened geopolitical tensions (e.g.
Syria, Iran, Ukraine), which could be enhanced by
the strict imposition of secondary sanctions on
EU-based companies in the cases of Russia and
Iran.
Moreover, some of the technical assumptions
underlying the forecast also constitute risks. Oil
prices, for instance, could rise stronger than
assumed due to export declines in some oil
producing countries, for example Iran, in response
to US sanctions and secondary sanctions against
Europe.
There are fewer elements that could cause an
upside surprise. Labour market reforms and
migration might have expanded labour supply
more than currently estimated, which would widen
the scope for employment growth and make labour
shortages a less binding supply-constraint than
currently expected in the central scenario. The past
increase in capacity utilisation rates could also
have a stronger impact on investment than
currently expected. Moreover, a reduction of trade(67)

With views to mitigating the consequences of Brexit, the
Commission has issued more than 70 notices inviting
stakeholders to prepare for the consequences of Brexit.
Furthermore, on 19 July 2018, the European Commission
adopted a Communication on preparing for the UK’s
withdrawal from the EU which explains the possible
consequences of a no-deal scenario and the importance of
contingency planning. See https://ec.europa.eu/info/brexit/

EA and EU outlook

related uncertainties could release stronger growth
momentum than currently envisaged. The recent
agreement on a successor to NAFTA, the USMexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA)
provided evidence that a reduction of trade
tensions is a possibility that cannot excluded.

The very high degree of uncertainty of the central
projection is reflected by the large width of the fan
chart, most notable in 2020, and the depicted skew
of the distributions of the forecasts illustrates the
balance of risks of the forecasts, which is seen on
the downside.

…and implies that risks to growth are tilted to
the downside.

…whereas risks to the inflation outlook appear
broadly balanced.

To assess the importance of risks the possible
impact of their materialisation is crucial. In that
regard, the more than five years of uninterrupted
economic growth and the improvements made to
the architecture of the EU and the euro area have
raised the resilience of the economy against
shocks. Gauging against this background the
aforementioned upside and downside risks, two
results emerge: the dominance of downside risks
and the relatively wide band of possible outcomes
surrounding the central scenario. This is visualised
in the fan chart (Graph I.72), which shows the
uncertainty around the central scenario for euro
area GDP growth with different confidence
intervals.

Risks to the inflation outlook have changed since
spring, but their balance is considered to be
roughly even. Some of the formerly identified
upside risks have already partly materialised (e.g. a
sharper increase of oil prices) and thus entered the
central scenario, whereas other risks have become
more pronounced, such as the price pressures from
tariffs.

Downside risks relate to the impact of less
dynamic economic growth, which could negatively
affect the expected pick-up of wages and slow the
build-up of domestic price pressures more than
incorporated in the central scenario. The complex
web of downside risks surrounding the economic
outlook could, if they materialise, dampen the
upward movement of energy and commodity
prices, which would reduce import prices and keep
a lid on external price pressures.

On the upside, a faster-than-expected recovery, or
substantially higher oil prices, which could come
from geopolitical tensions in the Middle East or
new sanctions against oil-exporting countries,
could push HICP inflation in the EU beyond the
forecast levels. A faster pick-up of inflation could
also originate from bottlenecks in the labour
market that push wages much higher.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

Box I.1: How resilient is the economy to oil price shocks?
Oil prices have increased substantially since the
publication of the spring forecast in May 2018. The
impact of price fluctuations, which may be
substantial over a relatively short period of time,
matter for the euro area outlook as oil prices affect
the economy through several channels. (1) This box
overviews the developments on the oil market over
the last decade, focussing on the emergence and
effects of shale oil production. The response of
conventional oil producers to the new source of
competition, as well as the outlook for oil prices
also are discussed. Finally, an analysis of the
impact of an oil price shock (which broadly
matches the magnitude of the increase in oil prices
since the spring forecast) on euro area GDP growth
and inflation is presented. Understanding oil price
movements and their effects on macroeconomic
variables in the recent past has important lessons
for forecasters as it should allow them to better
assess the impact of future shocks.
The rise of unconventional oil and OPEC’s
response

A prolonged period of high oil prices between 2010
and mid-2014 led to a surge in oil production and
some redistribution of oil market share among
producers, most notably towards unconventional
oil (2) producers in the US and Canada. The US, the
world’s largest oil consumer, almost doubled crude
oil production from 5.6 million bbl/day in 2010 to
10.5 million bbl/day in 2018, while in the same
period, production in Canada rose from 2.9 million
bbl/day to 4.1 million bbl/day. Altogether, the two
countries have increased their combined market
share of global oil production from 11% in 2010 to
18% in 2018, and the US now rivals Saudi Arabia
and Russia as the world’s top global oil producer
(see Graph 1). The increase in shale oil (and gas)
production since 2010 has had a lasting effect on
the US energy mix and resulted in growing US oil
exports (which until 2015 had been prohibited for
national security reasons).

The rise of unconventional oil in North America
influenced OPEC’s decisions on whether to target
price stabilisation or market share. In 2014, OPEC
producers agreed to defend their market share by
increasing output, which combined with easing of
geopolitical supply disruptions, led to a period of
lower oil prices, despite robust global demand.
However, advances in technology led to significant
reductions in shale oil and gas production costs to
an average of USD 25/bbl in 2016. This
significantly boosted the competitiveness of the
sector (see Graph 2). As a consequence, high-cost
production of conventional oil in some non-OPEC
countries (e.g. UK, Brazil, Nigeria) declined.
Production of shale oil also proved more flexible
than that of conventional oil due to its lower initial
investment that allowed producers to react more
quickly to changing prices.

reduce their fiscal break-even prices (3) were not as
effective and remained mostly above USD 70/bbl.
This led to a return to a price stabilisation strategy
and OPEC producers together with eleven nonOPEC oil producers led by Russia, agreed to cut
output (OPEC+ agreement). The deal, together with
a broad-based upswing in the global economy,
helped oil sustain prices above USD 50/bbl.
Reasons for the recent surge in oil prices

Since mid-2017, oil prices have been increasing
due to a combination of factors, including a robust
growth of global demand, compliance with the
OPEC+ agreement, growing tensions in the Middle
East, unplanned supply outages in Angola, a
sustained plunge of supply from Venezuela, and the
US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, which
raised concerns about the future Iranian oil
suppliesfuture supply from Iran. Most recently,
Brent prices rose above USD 80/bbl, as OPEC
producers agreed not to increase output soon and as
severe weather conditions were threatening to
disrupt production in the Gulf of Mexico. At the
same time, the US is not yet in a position to turn on
the oil tap when the global economy needs it. Only
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait
(OPEC), and Russia currently hold enough spare
production capacity to offset shortfalls from major
lasting supply disruptions.

second half of 2019 when new pipelines catch up
with surging production in the area. (4)
Rising oil prices have also affected gas prices,
which globally have picked up over the last six
months. In Europe, however, the link between oil
prices and gas prices has weakened due to the
significant shift away from oil-indexation and
towards hub prices: the share of oil-indexation in
gas price formation has decreased from 78% in
2005 to 28% in 2017. (5)
Who benefits and who loses from higher oil
prices?

A sustained recovery in oil prices above USD
70/bbl would most benefit conventional oilexporting countries, where higher oil prices are
associated with higher exports and improving
current accounts and fiscal positions. Elevated oil
prices would also support the medium-term
expansion of US shale producers and necessary
upstream investments. In particular, US shale
producers need prices above USD 65/bbl for
further output expansion to be profitable. (6)

Question marks about the sustainability of the US
shale boom have also helped sustain higher prices.
Increasing costs due to labour and material
shortages have started to weigh on the economic
viability of the sector. A tightening US labour
market means that trucking and labour shortages in
the Permian Basin are increasingly raising producer
cost pressures. In addition, growing costs for the
immense amounts of sand and water needed for
fracking is also weighing on the profitability of the
sector. Infrastructure constraints in the Permian
Basin are also making it difficult to get barrels out
of the US, as output has overwhelmed pipelines
that connect the Texas desert to markets along the
Gulf Coast and abroad. As a result, US local prices
are declining due to accumulating land-locked
shale oil, increasing the spread between the WTI
(the main price benchmark for US oil) and Brent. It
is likely that additional oil supplies from the US
could reach international markets only from the

By contrast, the impact of higher oil prices on the
rest of the world (oil importers) is expected to be
negative. In general, higher oil prices affect oilimporting economies through higher inflation,
which reduces household real disposable incomes
and consumption, as well as through higher
production costs in energy-intensive sectors of the
economy, potentially putting pressure on corporate
profit margins and affecting investment. Energy
taxes (or subsidies) may put a wedge between the
import price and the domestic price and thereby
reduce the domestic price swings. The impact of
higher prices also varies considerably depending on
the energy efficiency of an economy. In some
vulnerable oil importing emerging markets, recent
currency depreciations against the US dollar
amplify the impact and further widen their current
account deficits. This is particularly the case in
India and South Africa and to some extent
Indonesia and the Philippines, where higher oil
prices accentuate the risks related to the funding of
their current accounts and put further pressure on
their currencies. In others, governments face
difficult policy choices, such as whether to
subsidise the higher fuel price at the expense of

The outlook for oil prices

Over the forecast horizon, upward price pressures
are expected to be tempered by growing oil
production in Canada and the US and moderating
demand as global growth is slowing. However,
additional supply from the US is likely to reach
international markets only in the second half of
2019 due to pipeline capacity constraints and will
therefore not be a mitigating factor until then.
Moderating global oil demand growth, in line with
slowing global economic growth, is also expected
to weigh on prices. Substantial uncertainties and
possible price fluctuations around this scenario
relate to the scale of the reduction in Iranian crude
exports, the willingness and ability of Saudi Arabia
to bridge this gap, the volatility of Libyan and
Venezuelan production, as well as the evolution of
demand for oil as trade tensions intensify and
growth in emerging markets softens. Beyond 2020,
additional upward price pressures could arise if
investment into replacing reserves of conventional
oil production does not pick up over the forecast
horizon.
In the long-term, most of the net growth in oil
demand should come from emerging and
developing markets outside the OECD, but the
overall growth rate of oil demand will slow.
Growing populations and rising income levels in
emerging and developing countries will be the
main driving factor behind oil demand in the
future, as advanced economies reduce their
dependence on fossil fuel energy in line with
environmental policies, the rapid deployment and
falling costs of renewable energy, and increased
energy efficiency (see Graph 3).
%

Impact of oil price increases on the euro area

As a net oil importer, the macroeconomic impact of
higher oil prices on the euro area is negative. The
costs of industries that use oil and petroleum
products as inputs are will rise, which in turn may
affect product margins or be transferred to final
consumers through higher prices, leading to
upward pressure on inflation. In parallel, the
increase in fuel prices is weighing on the real
disposable income of households.
The magnitude of the direct effects of increasing oil
prices may be quantitatively estimated by structural
macroeconomic models or more flexible vector
autoregressive ones. Simulations of a 20%
cumulative increase (7) in Brent oil prices (8) over
the forecast horizon (9) suggest a relatively limited
dampening of growth and a relatively limited boost
to inflation.

aggravated fiscal positions (as they have in Brazil
and Malaysia) or let elevated oil prices take a hit on
domestic demand.

A 20% cumulative increase lifts the assumed oil
prices so that the difference between the assumption
in the forecast and the oil prices used in the
simulation reach 20% by the end of the forecast
horizon (see Graph 4).
A 20% increase in Brent oil prices until 2020
corresponds approximately to the increase in the
assumed oil prices between the spring and autumn
forecasts.
For the simulation, a large scale Bayesian vector
autoregressive (BVAR) model is used, developed for
conditional forecasting on euro area developments.

The dampening effects on GDP mainly take place
through private consumption. (10)
Second, the estimates suggest that rising production
costs, together with the direct effect of higher oil
prices on consumer prices would translate into only
a marginal rise in euro area HICP inflation rates of
about 0.1 pps. in 2019 and 0.2 pps. in 2020 (see
Graph 6).

US supplies coming on stream in late 2019.
Beyond 2020, additional upward price pressures
could arise if investment into oil production fail to
pick up in the coming years. In the long-term, the
rise of efficiency improvements and clean power
sources in the global energy mix, as well as
population and income growth will be the main
factors determining oil demand.

The results of the above simulation exercise match
the impact of the oil price shock estimated with the
Global Multi-country model. (11) Across different
specifications of the structural macroeconomic
model, the impact on inflation for both 2019 and
2020 ranges between 0.1 and 0.2 pps. For GDP, the
profile of the negative impact is different, with
2019 being affected more than 2020, but the
magnitude is broadly the same across the different
models and specifications.
In conclusion, over the past several years, the
emergence of shale oil production in North
America led to shifts in OPEC’s output strategy
and that has been a key factor behind oil price
fluctuations. The most recent surge in oil prices
reflects strong demand and tightening supplies, the
latter also driven by geo-political factors in the
Middle East. In the short-term, oil prices are
expected to peak and then gradually decline on the
back of moderating global demand and additional
(10)

The model does not capture second round effects that
might take place through exports to emerging market
economies or other advanced economies, which are
as well affected by the oil price increase.
The Global Multi-country model (GM) is an
estimated multi-country DSGE model developed by
the European Commission. For further details, see
Albonico, A., L. Calès, R. Cardani, O. Croitorov, F.

Roeger and L. Vogel (2017). ‘The Global MultiCountry Model (GM): an estimated DSGE model for
the euro area countries’. JRC Working Papers in
Economics and Finance 10.

The impact of the oil price shock on euro area GDP
growth, according to simulation results, is
relatively limited but not negligible. The size of the
simulated impact on inflation, which is rather on
the low side, (12) may be partially explained by the
gradually increasing nature of the assumed oil price
shock. (13) Also, despite not being captured in these
frameworks, the lower (14) and increasingly
nonlinear (15) sensitivity of euro area GDP growth
and inflation to oil price volatility compared to
earlier decades may play a role in explaining its
smaller-than-expected effect on these variables.

(15)

For 2019, the simulation implied 0.1 pps. increase in
the pace of annual inflation is somewhat lower than
the 0.2 pps. upward revision in the forecast compared
to spring. Though, the oil price assumptions
increased more (by 26% in USD terms from the
SF18) for 2019 than assumed in the simulation.
A sudden, frontloaded oil price shock where oil
prices increased by 20% at the beginning of the shock
and remain broadly at that level over the next two
years, would affect more 2019 than 2020.
The structural factors include a long-term reduction
in the energy and oil intensity of global production as
well as in the OECD countries (see e.g. Key World
Energy Statistics 2017). This reflects advances in
technology, conservation efforts, energy and fuel
efficiency.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

Box I.2: Implications of higher yields for the banking sector
and private sector funding in the euro area
The European economy has enjoyed very low
funding costs over the last several years, with both
the public and the private sector benefiting from a
very accommodative monetary policy environment
and low levels of risk aversion. However, this
situation cannot continue forever as funding costs
are bound to rise as monetary policy tightens or
pockets of risk aversion emerge. The consequences
on the real economy would vary considerably
according to the nature of the rise in sovereign
yields.
In the absence of risk aversion and still sustained
nominal economic growth in the euro area, the
gradual normalisation of monetary policy signalled
by the ECB’s intention to end asset purchases this
year and possibly start raising rates next year
should have a rather modest impact on real interest
rates and the real economy. A rise in risk aversion
in particular countries, however, could also cause
sovereign yields to rise. If this were to happen
without any improvement in macroeconomic
conditions and/or higher inflation, then the ensuing
rise in real interest rates would be more likely to
have a significant adverse impact on the economy.
Indeed, higher sovereign yields could raise funding
costs for the entire economy if they spread to the
private sector via banks or directly via bond
markets.
During the 2011/2012 euro area sovereign debt
crisis three interrelated contagion channels were
observed. The first operated between sovereigns
and their respective national banking systems (the
co-called ‘sovereign bank doom loop’), which led
eventually banks to charge higher interest rates and
reduce lending to the private sector. The second
concerned the bond markets, with higher sovereign
yields leading to higher yields for corporate debt.
The third ran cross-country and led to higher
funding costs for sovereigns and private sector
borrowers in other vulnerable euro area Member
States.
Following the sovereign market jitters this year
triggered mainly by Italy’s budgetary plans, this
box examines the state of these contagion channels
today and assesses the extent to which the current
episode differs from the one in 2011/2012.
The sovereign-bank nexus

The sovereign-bank nexus that prevailed during the
euro area crisis has been widely documented in the

academic literature. (1) The Bank of International
Settlements (2) in 2011 identified four channels
through which a higher sovereign risk has a
negative impact on financial institutions: (i) losses
on holdings of government debt which are mostly
national; (ii) lower value of the collateral banks can
use to raise wholesale funding and central bank
liquidity; (iii) lower ratings for banks following
sovereign downgrades; (iv) reduced funding
benefits that banks derive from implicit and explicit
government guarantees. At the same time, the
implicit guarantee offered by governments to
national banks produced the reverse causality from
banks to sovereigns. (3) There is empirical evidence
of both causalities playing a role with variations in
time and across countries. Bank bailout events can
be a turning point in this causal relationship. Quite
intuitively, implicit government guarantees mean
that higher credit spreads for banks in trouble lead
to higher spreads for sovereign before bailouts
while after bailouts, the opposite causality
prevails. (4) Overall, credit default swaps (CDS)
data for banks and sovereigns over longer periods
tend to show that bank risks generally led sovereign
risks prior to the crisis while the causality reversed
after 2010, when sovereign risks became the main
source of bank risk. (5)
The interdependence between banks and sovereigns
has gone through several phases. Before the 2007
crisis, there was no significant correlation between
banks and sovereigns. After the 2008/2009 global
financial crisis, correlations started to emerge and
become positive (6) overall. After 2010, during the
sovereign debt crisis, banks and sovereigns became

highly and positively correlated. Such correlations
reflect the fundamental-based contagion due to the
presence of links through the financial sector or the
real economy. A decomposition of the sovereignbank CDS correlation between common risk factors
and domestic or idiosyncratic factors reveals a
growing importance of the latter in euro area
periphery countries after 2010. (7)

Graph 1 takes the example of the two closest and
most representative countries in the euro area
periphery in terms of bank sovereign
interdependence: Italy and Spain. It confirms that
sovereign-bank correlation started to increase
rapidly after 2008 and peaked in 2010 at above 0.8.
It then followed a progressive decline before May
2018 when a significant bounce occurred in Italy
alone. The two countries have hence broken a long
history of similarity on this issue with Italy now
taking a different path from all other euro area
countries, as a result of domestic, idiosyncratic
factors.

One factor still underpinning the strong link
between banks and their sovereigns is the domestic
bias in banks’ sovereign debt holdings. The
exposure of banks to their sovereigns has, overall,
increased in the euro area’s ‘peripheral countries’
since 2008. Italy and Spain have experienced
similar trends, with home biases peaking in 2014
and declining slightly since then. This year,
however, the two countries have diverged: Italian
banks have increased their holdings of domestic
sovereign debt in a context of rising yields (see
Graph 2), while Spanish banks have decreased
theirs.

A small increase in yields has only limited
implications for bank capital ratios. In Italy, for
example, a 100 bps. increase in yields leads to an
average loss of 4% on banks’ sovereign holdings,
which account for about 10% of their total assets.
This would dent bank capital ratios by about 0.4%.
However, a more significant increase in yields and
a rising exposure to their national debt would lead
to more significant losses. At the same time, a rise
in banks’ holdings of domestic sovereign debt
could take place at the expense of other assets,
including loans (substitution effect), as the return
on new acquisitions of sovereign debt improves
and continues to benefit from the regulatory
advantage of zero risk weighting. Such increase in
banks’ domestic sovereign exposures in response to
increases in sovereign yields is no new
phenomenon and in fact was widespread during the
sovereign debt crisis. It does, however, suggest that
banks may have distorted incentives that affect
their responses to changes in their own sovereigns’
risk. (8)
The bank-sovereign nexus during the euro area
sovereign debt crisis led to higher bank interest
rates for companies and households as well as
lower lending volumes. While demand for loans
played a role during the subdued economic growth
during the crisis period, the banking sector’s
capacity and willingness to lend was clearly
constrained in the most vulnerable Member States.
Banks in these countries required higher interest
rates not only because of the higher riskiness of
borrowers but also due to their own balance sheet

pressures in the context of tensions in the sovereign
debt markets. (9)
So far, the current tensions on the Italian sovereign
debt market and the ongoing interplay between the
country’s sovereign and domestic banks have not
led banks to raise interest rates and/or restrictions
on loans to households and companies. (10) During
the crisis, higher sovereign and bank CDS spreads
were rapidly transmitted to retail lending rates. (11)

This may be because there are a number of
significant differences between the present
situation and the situation in 2011/2012. First, retail
interest rates since the crisis have declined far more
slowly than the Italian two-year sovereign yield.
This suggests that banks have maintained decent
interest margins on retail loans and may explain a
possible lag in the substitution effect from bank
lending to better-yielding sovereign bonds (12).
Second, while risk premia emerged on banks’
equity and bond markets, interest rates on deposits
remained

confidence in the Italian banking sector (see

Latest ECB data for August show broadly unchanged
bank interest rates and still rising bank lending
volumes in all euro area countries. The latest July
2018 Bank Lending Survey from the ECB also shows
no effect from sovereign tensions with ongoing
loosening of credit standards in Italy and in the euro
area as a whole.

on bond financing, leading to a more limited
impact from current tensions. Third, the whole euro
area economy enjoys currently a robust economic
growth, whereas in 2012 it was still reeling from
the 2009 economic downturn. This should limit
banks’ risk perceptions on their lending portfolios
to the private sector. Fourth, the ECB’s asset
purchase programmes for sovereign bonds and
corporate bonds have contributed to lower longterm yields in all euro area countries. Also, the
ECB’s targeted longer-term refinancing operations
(TLTROs) are still running. The programme offers
long-term funding at attractive conditions to banks
in order to ease private sector credit conditions and
stimulate bank lending to the real economy. Fifth,
European banks, including in Italy, are currently in
a far stronger position than they were during the
crisis. They are overall much better capitalised and
have more stable funding sources, which makes
them able to absorb greater losses. Non-performing
loans are still high in the most vulnerable Member
States but have been on a declining trend for
several years. Last but not least, the institutional
framework has also changed, with deep regulatory
reforms for the European banking sector aimed at
addressing the bank sovereign nexus. Europe’s
banking union has from the outset been politically
driven by the need to sever the bank-sovereign
vicious circle and allow for the effective
transmission of monetary policy. However, while
the first two pillars (13) of the banking union have
been implemented, the European banking union is
not yet complete (14). To achieve a fully functional
banking union, the first two pillars need to be
complemented by a credible common backstop to
guarantee the credibility of the Single Resolution
Mechanism. A European deposit insurance scheme
(EDIS) is also needed to further weaken the link
between banks and their sovereigns by ensuring
that the level of depositor confidence in a bank
would not depend on the bank’s location.

Sovereign-corporate bond market contagion

Yield patterns in the euro area’s corporate bond
markets suggest a contagion from the Italian
sovereign to the corporate bond markets. Italian
investment grade corporates have faced rising
yields over the last few months leading to much
higher yields for Italian corporations compared
with corporations in other euro area countries (see
Graph 5). This suggests an immediate reaction of
bond investors who connected the Italian private
sector with the country’s sovereign. This contrasts
with the inertia currently noticeable in the
intermediation process of the banking sector.
However, corporate bond markets and bank lending
are not completely independent, as larger nonfinancial corporations can chose between the two.
Rising funding costs on corporate bond markets
should increase corporate demand for bank loans
and, ceteris paribus, push lending rates higher.
Such substitution effects between bank lending and
bond markets have taken place since the crisis, with
corporates issuing bonds at lower funding costs
during periods of higher bank interest rates in
several euro area member states.

Cross country contagion

A particular feature of the recent developments in
euro area sovereign debt markets is the absence so
far of contagion from the Italian sovereign to other
Member States. Looking back, it appears that
previously well-integrated bond markets in the euro
area have fragmented along national lines during
the crisis. Overall, core countries have benefited
from flights to quality while peripheral countries
have seen rising sovereign yields. When looking
only at the euro area periphery, cross-country
correlation picked up in 2010 reflecting the upward
co-movement in sovereign yields. Since the crisis,
the interdependence between the two most similar
euro area countries, Italy and Spain, has further
increased reflecting the joint reduction in yields,
also helped by ECB policy (15) (see Graph 6).

Following the results of Italy’s election earlier this
year, a significant decorrelation has taken place
between the two sovereigns. At the same time, the
high and rising correlation between banks’ CDS
spreads in the two countries suggests that the
perceived riskiness of their respective banking
systems remains closely linked. In fact, inter-bank
CDS correlations have stayed high since 2008,
reflecting the dense network of connections among
banks, common risk factors, and the systemic risk
of the euro area banking system as a whole. (16) In
such a context, a risk factor, even if localised only
in one euro area country, has the ability to provoke
a more generalised risk aversion in the euro area
banking sector.

Conclusion

The re-emergence of risk aversion for the Italian
sovereign debt this year has revealed a number of
features as regards the potential contagion effects.
While the bank sovereign nexus re-appeared clearly
in Italy there is not yet full transmission of the
sovereign stress to the private sector bank funding.
The numerous differences with the situation that

70

prevailed during the euro area sovereign debt crisis
do not allow us to conclude whether this
transmission may be prevented or simply delayed.
For the moment, the contagion to the non-financial
sector appears only via bond markets with higher
yields for Italian corporates while the contagion
from the Italian sovereign to other euro area
sovereigns has not operated.

EA and EU outlook

Box I.3: Euro area GDP growth drivers in 2019 – analysis using a structural model
The real GDP of the euro area is forecast to grow
by 1.9% in 2019. This box presents a
decomposition of the growth forecast using a
structural macroeconomic model. (1) The model
features two regions, the euro area and the rest of
the world (RoW), and it has been estimated using
quarterly data for the period from the first quarter
of 1999 to the second quarter of 2018. Estimation
of a structural model allows for the identification of
shocks, i.e., the exogenous factors that drive the
short- and medium-term deviations of the
endogenous variables from their long-run trends
(including GDP, inflation, domestic demand, and
trade), and it provides an interpretation of the
dynamics from the perspective of economic
theory.(2)
Model-based forecast decomposition

The model-based analysis proceeds in three steps.
In the first step, the model is estimated on historical
data. The data set is then extended by the European
Commission’s autumn 2018 forecast until 2019 for
the set of the available variables. The final step
recovers the shocks (3) that are necessary for the
model to replicate the forecast values given the
estimated model parameters and historical shocks.
Using a detailed structural model to decompose
macroeconomic dynamics has the advantage that
the model can exploit the rich information provided
by the data. In particular, a detailed model allows
for the driving forces to be identified on the basis
of restrictions imposed by the model equations, i.e.
by economic theory, across variables and over
time. The sign and size of the different domestic
and foreign demand and supply shocks, including
financial, commodity price, productivity, and
policy shocks, is determined by the ability of these
shocks to fit not only GDP, but also other observed
(1)

(2)

(3)

These results are based on the Global Multi-Country
(GM) DSGE model developed by DG ECFIN and the
Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.
A detailed description of the GM model can be found
in: Albonico, A., L. Calès, R. Cardani, O. Croitorov,
F. Ferroni, M. Giovannini, S. Hohberger, B.

Roeger and L. Vogel (2017). ‘The Global MultiCountry Model (GM): an Estimated DSGE Model for
the Euro Area Countries’. Working Papers 2017-10,
Joint Research Centre, European Commission.
The model is a structural macro-model in the NewKeynesian tradition with rigorous microeconomic
foundations derived from utility and profit
optimisation and including frictions in goods, labour
and financial markets.
The different types of domestic and foreign shocks on
the demand and supply side are discussed below.

variables in the model, such as consumption,
investment, trade, employment, and their comovement.
The various drivers (the model includes 29 types of
exogenous shocks) are summarised into seven
distinct groups of factors, namely: (1) shocks to
euro area productivity; (2) euro area labour and
goods market adjustment as captured by wage and
price mark-up shocks; (3) oil price shocks; (4) euro
area domestic demand shocks, i.e. changes in
consumption and investment demand in the euro
area that are not explained by fundamentals such as
household income, interest rates and return
expectations on physical capital and financial
assets; (5) euro area monetary policy shocks that
capture deviations of short-term interest rates from
the estimated policy rule; (6) euro area exchange
rate shocks, which affect the exchange rate of the
euro independently of the monetary policy stance;
and (7) shocks to world demand and international
trade, which include foreign demand and supply
shocks and deviations of trade volumes and prices
from the estimated export and import demand and
pricing equations. The remaining shocks and the
effect of initial conditions are summarised as
‘others’. The groups (1) to (3) act mainly on the
euro area economy’s supply side, whereas (4) to (7)
predominantly affect demand for goods and
services in the euro area in the short and medium
term. The model-based decompositions presented
below identify the importance of each of these
groups of shocks.
Domestic demand drives GDP growth…

Graph 1 displays the model-based decomposition
of annual real GDP growth. The solid black line
shows the historical data, and the dashed line
represents the European Commission’s forecast for
2018 and 2019. The coloured bars show the
contribution of the groups of driving forces to
deviations of GDP growth from its long-run trend
of approximately 1.4%, i.e. the value at which the
(solid) horizontal axis intersects the vertical axis.
Bars above (below) this horizontal axis indicate
positive (negative) contributions to GDP growth in
a given year. The sum of positive and negative
contributions matches the data (black solid line) for
any point in time.
The decomposition of real GDP growth in Graph 1
points to domestic demand as the main driver of
above-trend growth in 2019. The positive growth
contribution by domestic demand is attributed by

the model mostly to private consumption. In
addition, monetary policy remains expansionary
compared to the model’s monetary policy rule
(targeting a positive output gap and consumer price
inflation close to 2%), which is reflected in
negative shocks attributed by the model to the
policy rate. The negative shocks to the policy rate
support euro area GDP growth by stimulating
interest-sensitive components of domestic demand
(such as investment and durable consumption
goods) and by strengthening net exports via
depreciation of the euro’s nominal effective
exchange rate. Regarding supply-side drivers,
Graph 1 indicates a small positive contribution
from productivity (TFP) growth, whereas
increasing oil prices in 2019 have a dampening
impact on growth (increase by about 7% in USD
terms relative to 2018 in the forecast assumption
based on future prices). According to the model,
the positive contribution from world demand and
international trade peaked in 2017, diminishes in
2018 and turns slightly negative in 2019.

to closing the output gap in recent years, the
contribution of domestic demand factors to the
output gap is still negative. By contrast, reflecting
its positive contributions to growth since 2016, the
contribution from world demand and international
trade to the level of GDP is still positive in 2019
(but smaller than in 2018). Also, Graph 2 points to
a positive contribution of monetary policy to the
closing of the output gap and its move into positive
territory over the forecast horizon, in line with the
positive 2019 growth effects in Graph 1.

…but remains still below long-run levels…

While domestic demand, in particular private
consumption, appears as the dominant positive
contributor to growth in 2019 (see Graph 1), the
legacy of weak domestic demand still affects the
level of euro area activity negatively, compared to
its long-run trend. This is illustrated by the
decomposition of the output gap as the percent gap
between actual GDP and potential GDP in Graph 2.
Downward pressure from weak domestic demand
on output levels has subsided in recent years in line
with a deceleration of post-crisis deleveraging in
the private sector. Its negative impact on the level
of economic activity is estimated to decline further
according to the forecast, in line with the positive
contribution of domestic demand factors to GDP
growth in 2019 (see Graph 1). Despite the gradual
recovery of domestic demand and its contribution

The fact that domestic demand still hovers below
the historical average in the forecast also affects
euro area inflation and net exports. Inflation, as
measured by the annual growth of the private
consumption deflator, is expected to rise
moderately in 2019 (Graph 3), but the inflation rate
remains below the ECB’s definition of price
stability, which is close to but below 2%.
According to the decomposition from the estimated
model, depressed levels of domestic demand
remain the main reason for the still subdued pace of
annual inflation. Its contribution dominates the
positive contribution from the monetary policy
stance and from cost-push factors, among which
the projected increase in oil prices has the largest
effect. As explained above, the contribution of
‘monetary policy’ only reflects the deviation of
interest rates from a Taylor rule. Unconventional
monetary policy measures are not explicitly
considered but may be partially captured by
exchange rate fluctuations and additional domestic
demand. This explains the relatively small size of
monetary policy shocks over time according to the
model.

…and the trade surplus is forecast to persist.

The subdued momentum of domestic demand,
which dampens the demand for imports, explains
around 1.0% of GDP of the euro area’s trade
surplus projected for 2019. The forecast
incorporates world demand and trade factors, as the
other important driver of the surplus in 2019
(contribution of 1.4% of GDP). In addition, the
decomposition in Graph 4 points to a minor
positive contribution from expansionary monetary
policy to net exports in 2019 and small negative
contributions from the nominal appreciation of the
euro and the rise in oil prices, which are part of the
forecast assumptions for 2019. (4)

Taken together, the model-based decomposition
presented in this box attributes above-trend euro
area real GDP growth in 2019 to continued
domestic demand growth and to an accommodative
monetary policy stance. Domestic demand levels
remain below the historical average, however,
implying a still negative (although diminishing)
contribution to the level of economic activity.
Below-average levels of domestic demand also
explain low levels of inflation in the euro area and
a significant part of the trade balance surplus
incorporated in the European Commission’s
forecast for 2019.

Box I.4: Labour market slack in the euro area
The euro area’s economic recovery since the Great
Recession has been particularly job-rich. The
picture at present, however, is somewhat complex,
as indicators point to evidence of both
underemployment and labour market tightening
occurring at the same time. This box examines
different concepts of labour-market slack both at
the level of the euro area and at the level of
Member States. Its aim is to present a granular
picture of the degree of un(der)utilised labour
potential and its geographical distribution by
looking at key country-specific labour-market
indicators that go beyond headline unemployment
rates.

After more than five years since the beginning of
the recovery, the unemployment rate in the euro
area is gradually returning to its pre-crisis level and
the number of employed persons stands at a record
high. In a majority of euro area countries, the
unemployment rate is below its long-term average
(see Graph 1), but the situation varies considerably
between Member States. With supply constraints
now apparent in a number of Member States and
sectors, a careful monitoring of emerging tensions
in labour markets could help to assess the possible
emergence of ‘speed limits’ to GDP growth.
Considering the robust rate of employment growth
since the start of the recovery and recent signs of
labour-market tightening, wage dynamics have
been remarkably subdued (1). This observation
extends beyond the euro area, in a phenomenon
labelled ‘wageless’ economic growth (2). Many

The movement of workers from countries with
higher unemployment to countries in need of
workers could play an important role in cushioning
negative labour demand shocks and in smoothing
the adjustment process. Yet, despite significant
improvements (5), cross-border labour mobility
plays a weaker role in the EU than it does in the
US. This is likely to result from differences in
language and culture, as well as and institutional
factors hindering labour mobility. The result,
however, is that isolated labour demand shocks
tend to have stronger and more persistent effects in
the EU than in the US (6). Such findings highlight
the need for a more detailed assessment of the
cyclical position of national labour markets.

available to work but not seeking; and seeking but not immediately

This definition however, makes a rigid distinction
between employment and unemployment status,
depending on a rather narrow definition of
unemployment, which includes only those currently
without work, available to begin work within two
weeks, and actively seeking work (7). More
recently, greater focus has been placed on wider
measures of underemployment, which also consider
(i) those that are not employed or unemployed but
still marginally attached to the labour force (8) as
well as (ii) those employed part-time but wishing to
work more hours, also named as underemployed
part-timers. (9)Despite improving since the start of
the recovery in 2013, such measures show that
underemployment is still higher than it was 10
years ago in a majority of euro area countries,
despite being broadly unchanged for the euro area
as a whole (see Graph 2).
Although they provide a richer framework than
traditional labour status measures, these
survey-based figures should be read with
caution. (10) They may be subject to cyclical as well
as structural developments, or may depend on
factors other than labour-market demand, which
complicates their interpretation in terms of
labour-market slack. For example, they may depend

on the ability of underemployed part-timers to
increase the number of hours worked and the
willingness of those currently inactive to
participate, given expected lower job-finding
probabilities and job-search intensities. In many
countries, this additional slack is mostly driven by
changes in the number of part-time workers
wishing to work additional hours. (11)
As for underemployed part-time work, the picture
varies considerably between Member States. It
currently represents about a fifth of all part-time
workers in the euro area, ranging from about 7% of
overall part-time employment in Estonia and 12%
in Germany, to close to 60% in Cyprus, 70% in
Greece and about 50% in Spain. While sizeable in a
number of countries, the current share of
underemployed part-time workers is already close
to or below 2013 levels in the majority of the cases
but still significantly above 2008 levels (year for
which quarterly data starts to be available) in
Cyprus, Greece, Portugal and Spain. All in all, in
the euro area, the increase in the share of
underemployed part-time workers has been partly
reversed and is now about 0.4 pps. higher than in
2008 (see Graph 3).

such estimates highlight that inflationary pressures
are expected to start building up at comparatively
lower levels of unemployment. Notable exceptions
are Greece and Spain, where estimates are higher
and still above average, as well as Cyprus and Italy,
where previously below-average estimates have
increased and are now higher than the euro area
aggregate.

According to these estimates, the labour market
response to the crisis reached its lowest point in
terms of underutilised labour potential in 2013 (see
Graph 4). Nearly 90% of the labour market slack in
2013 was due to the unemployment gap – i.e. the
difference between the observed unemployment
rate and the estimated non-accelerating wage rate
of unemployment (NAWRU) (12) - with the
remaining 10% due to the hours worked and
participation rate gaps.

Although the euro area unemployment gap can be
seen as slightly negative, the same cannot be said
for all its members (see Graph 5). As of 2017, it
was estimated to be negative and below average in
five euro area countries, and most significantly in
Greece, Cyprus and Italy. At the same time,
positive gaps of about 1 pp. are signaled in
Lithuania, Slovakia and Ireland.

The estimates also suggest that after four years of
above-potential average GDP growth rates in the
euro area, the crisis-related slack in the labour
market has been broadly removed, with the labour
gap close to zero. Compared to the US, labour
supply in the euro area is thus converging to its
potential level with a three- year delay, offering a
preview into a possible cyclical path for the euro
area labour market.
One important insight is that the euro area
NAWRU is estimated to be lower than in the

While a majority of countries does not show a large
reservoir of untapped labour potential, it emerges
that the euro area gap is being weighed down by a
sizeable unemployment gap in Greece (which
stands out at around -6 pps.), followed by Cyprus,
Italy, Finland and Spain (close to -1 pp.).
According to the Autumn Forecast, in 2018 the
distribution is expected to look more skewed due to
rapidly closing gaps in both Cyprus and Spain, with
only three countries showing unemployment rates
above their estimated NAWRUs (notably Greece,
Italy and Finland). This assessment confirms the
view that any remaining pockets of slack in the
labour market are set to shrink in both number and
size.

‘Hours worked’ is another measure of labour
supply and of the ‘intensive’ use of labour in the
production process. Changes in the number of
hours worked can be explained by the share of
part-time work (see Graph 6), employment creation
in sectors with fewer than average hours worked, or
changing working patterns (i.e. maximum weekly
hours).

positive or negative deviations being very limited
in size across countries (around 0.5 pps. or less).
The responsiveness of participation to slack usually
follows stylized mechanisms . Job search is
determined, among other factors, by job security,
with a lower job-loss risk (typical of a tightening
labour market) stimulating those outside the labour
force to look for jobs. At the same time, increasing
flows into unemployment and rising job scarcity
discourages non-active working-age individuals
from engaging actively in the market. (14)
Nevertheless, participation gaps are estimated to
have been rather limited during the crisis years –
having a low impact on labour underutilisation.

For the euro area as a whole, average hours worked
per employee remain below its pre-crisis level.
According to Commission’s estimates, trend hours
worked have stabilised over recent years, with no
indication that its secular decline will be reversed
anytime soon. Hours worked have fluctuated
around a declining trend – with economic upturns
linked to a stabilisation of the trend, not an upward
movement. A shift-share decomposition of changes
in hours worked confirms the role of some
structural factors – namely employment creation in
sectors with below-average working hours and an
increasing share of part-time employment (see
Graph 7). All in all, in 2018, hours worked per
person employed are estimated to be close to trend
in the euro area and across most Member States.

Crisis legacies weigh on prime-age workers…

One of the usual critiques of methodologies such as
the one employed in the previous analysis, is that
they do not consider possible participation and
unemployment gaps emerging from different age
cohorts, skill groups, or gender groups, as they rely
on average headline figures. The employment rate
has the advantage of offering the same degree of
granularity as the unemployment rate, while taking
into account the impact of participation rates of
specific groups of workers by comparing
employment against the working age population,
not the labour force (see Graph 8). (15)
The unemployment rate of young cohorts (15-24)
typically show a higher sensitivity to changing
cyclical conditions. Between 2007 and 2013, the
euro area youth unemployment rate increased at
twice the pace as the overall unemployment rate.
This higher pro-cyclicality reflects a lower level of
job-specific skills, lower job security and other
social considerations, reflected in a higher
proportion of temporary and part-time contracts.
Despite declining as the economic expansion
progressed, (16) the youth unemployment rate in
2017 was still above pre-crisis levels in around 2/3

…with those with lower skill levels struggling to
catch up…

At the same time, the euro area youth employment
rate stood at 32.3% in 2017, above the trough of
30.8% reached in 2015 but below the peak of
37.7% in 2007. When unrelated to higher
participation in education, prolonged out-of-work
periods can have lasting impacts on skills and
incomes due to hysteresis effects eroding human
capital. (17) It is also costly to productivity through
lower innovation, as highly-productive firms tend
to expand while hiring younger people, and on
knowledge diffusion, through lower mobility and
job-switching.

The crisis-impact on prime-age employment rates
has also been heterogeneous across skill-levels (18)
(see Graph 9). Taking a closer look at the data
shows that by 2017, those with less than lower
secondary education had an employment rate
around 6 pps. lower than by 2007 – which
compares with around -1 pp. for those with higher
skill levels. At the same time, the impact for
low-qualified males has been more than twice as
large as that for females (around -10% and -4%,
respectively). Evidence of remaining gaps in
low-qualified prime-age male employment rates
can be found in most countries (see Graph 10),
ranging from -18% in Greece, -17% in Cyprus and
-13% in Spain to around 10% in Ireland, Italy,
France, Belgium, Netherlands, Austria or Finland.
Notable exceptions include Slovakia (+15%),
Estonia (+6%), and Germany (broadly unchanged).

The impact of the crisis has been particularly hard
on younger people with less than upper secondary
education for whom the employment rate has
stabilised at a lower level since 2014 (around -10
pps.). Only for those with higher levels of
education has the employment rate being edging up
to, or neared pre-crisis levels.
Prime-age cohorts (25-54) are particularly relevant,
as their labour market participation remains mostly
unaffected by their schooling and retirement
decisions. Contrary to the overall employment rate,
the euro area prime-age employment rate is still
slightly below its 2007 level, but continues to
increase, amid differentiated developments
between males and females. Despite recovering
since 2013, the employment rate of males is still
3.3 pps. below its 2008 level, whereas it is 0.8 pps.

The impact of such gaps is non-negligible – primeage males with lower education levels account for
around 8% of euro area total employment.
Nevertheless, it is still unclear the extent to which
such gaps will prove to be structural in nature.
Much depends on the geographical and skill
matching efficiency of the labour market. (19)
Indeed, with the dispersion across euro area
countries on a declining trend since at least 2005,
the employment rate may tend to stabilise at a
lower level compared to the pre-crisis period.

…with evidence of a lower matching efficiency.

As the unemployment rate has trended lower,
labour market shortages have also begun to appear
in some countries and industries. This has been
particularly evident in survey-based measures
where participants detail the factors limiting their
production output. In general, assessments of
labour shortages decline during recessions and
recover during expansions, showing high
cyclicality and correlation across sectors.
Estimates of the Beveridge curve, however, hint at
an outward shift and higher steepness of the curve
over 2013-2017 and a deterioration of matching
mechanisms (see Graph 11). Such evidence is
testament to the possibility of shortages arising at
higher levels of unemployment and under intense
recruitment needs. (20) Such pressures may prevent
the reabsorption of those displaced from some
permanently downsized sectors and create
incentives for increasing working hours of those
already employed.
(20)

Labour as limiting factor (%)

The number of employed individuals aged 55-64
was broadly unaffected by the crisis years, and has
followed an upward trend, with the employment
rate rising from 34.1% in 2000 to 57.1% in 2017.
This has been driven by a rising participation rate,
as older people extend their working lives in line
with reforms introduced in pension systems (e.g.
rising pension ages) and improving educational
levels. Indeed, it emerges that net employment
gains since 2008 can be almost entirely attributed
to individuals in this age group.

All in all, the outward shift of the euro area's
Beveridge curve during the sovereign debt crisis
can be plausibly explained by the magnitude of job
destruction in some countries combined with
reduced job-finding rates and longer spells of
unemployment. At the same time, the sizeable
downsizing of the construction and real estate
sectors likely contributed to lower skill and
geographical matching efficiency. (21) Indeed, the
skills of workers employed in these sectors may not
be easily adaptable to the labour demand emerging
in other growing sectors – increasing the need for
retraining and activation policies, a medium-term
challenge which creates short-term frictions.
Overall, it is arguable that, despite possible
measurement uncertainty, most evidence shows a
diminishing and relatively limited degree of slack
at the aggregate level. Despite the expected closure
of the unemployment gap, there remain some
important ‘pockets’ of untapped capacity (be it at
country, gender, age or skill level) as exemplified
by still-high youth unemployment. The lower level
of working hours compared to the pre-crisis period
does not necessarily reflect slack, and is not
expected to be reversed, as it has to be seen as part
of a long-term downward trend. The observed
outward shift of the Beveridge curve since 2008 is
consistent with evidence of labour shortages (as
reported in surveys) arising at comparatively higher
levels of unemployment due to lower matching
efficiency (e.g. skills mismatch). Such shortages
are also compatible with the prevalence of lower
employment rates than before the crisis among
those with lower skills, which together with lower
matching efficiency, amplifies frictions in
job-to-job transitions between different sectors.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

Box I.5: Some technical elements behind the forecast
Given the ongoing negotiations on the terms of the
UK withdrawal from the EU, projections for 2019
are based on a purely technical assumption of status
quo in terms of trading relations between the EU27
and the UK. This is for forecasting purposes only
and has no bearing on the talks underway in the
context of the Article 50 process.
The cut-off date for taking new information into
account in this European Economic Forecast was
22 October 2018. The forecast incorporates
validated public finance data as published in
Eurostat’s news release 163/2018 of 22 October
2018.
External assumptions

This forecast is based on a set of external
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions
from possible volatility during any given trading
day, averages from a 10-day reference period
(between 4 and 17 October) were used for
exchange and interest rates, and for oil prices.
Exchange and interest rates

The technical assumption regarding exchange rates
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption
leads to an implied average USD/EUR rate of 1.18
in 2018 and 1.15 both in 2019 and in 2020. The
average JPY/EUR is 130.74 in 2018 and 130.10 in
both 2019 and 2020.
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based.
Short-term interest rates for the euro area are
derived from futures contracts. Long-term interest
rates for the euro area, as well as short- and
long-term interest rates for other Member States are
calculated using implicit forward swap rates,
corrected for the current spread between the
interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no
market instrument is available, the fixed spread
vis-à-vis the euro area interest rate is taken for both
short- and long-term rates. As a result, short-term
interest rates are assumed to be -0.3% in
2018, -0.2% in 2019 and 0.2% in 2020 in the euro
area. Long-term euro area interest rates are
assumed to be 0.5% in 2018, 0.7% in 2019 and
0.9% in 2020.
Commodity prices

Commodity price assumptions are also based on
market conditions. According to futures markets,

prices for Brent oil are projected to be on average
75.12 USD/bbl in 2018; 80.64 USD/bbl in 2019
and 76.68 USD/bbl in 2020. This would correspond
to an oil price of 63.44 EUR/bbl in 2018,
69.96 EUR/bbl in 2019 and 66.52 EUR/bbl in
2020.
Budgetary data and forecasts

Data up to 2017 are based on data notified by
Member States to the European Commission before
1 October and validated by Eurostat on 22 October
2018. (1)
Eurostat is maintaining the reservation on the
quality of the data reported by Hungary in relation
to the sector classification of the foundations
created by the Hungarian National Bank. Eurostat
considers that these foundations, including their
subsidiaries, should be classified inside general
government. This would lead to an estimated
increase in government deficit in 2015 by 25.3 bn
HUF (0.1% of GDP), in 2016 by 54.0 bn HUF
(0.2% of GDP) and in 2017 by 33.7 bn HUF (0.1%
of GDP). The debt figures would remain
unchanged.
Eurostat is withdrawing the reservation on the
quality of the data reported by France in relation to
the sector classification of the Agence Française de
Développement. Eurostat is also withdrawing the
reservation on the treatment of the capital injection
into AREVA with an impact on the deficit, for an
amount of €2.5 bn (0.1% of GDP) in 2017. In the
October 2018 EDP Notification the recording has
been changed and is now treated as a capital
transfer.
The public finance forecast is made under the ‘nopolicy-change’ assumption, which extrapolates past
revenue and expenditure trends and relationships in
a way that is consistent with past policy
orientations. This may also include the adoption of
a limited number of working assumptions,
especially to deal with possible structural breaks.
The forecast reflects all fiscal policy measures that
imply a change to these past policy orientations on
the condition that they are sufficiently detailed as
well as adopted or at least credibly announced. For
2019 in particular, draft budgets presented before
the cut-off date of the forecast are taken into
consideration.

EU and euro area aggregates for general

published on a non-consolidated basis (i.e. not
corrected for intergovernmental loans, including
those made through the European Financial
Stability Facility). To ensure consistency in the
time series, historical data are also published on the
same basis. For 2017, this implies an aggregate
debt-to-GDP ratio which is somewhat higher than
the consolidated general government debt ratio
published by Eurostat in its news release 163/2018
of 22 October 2018 (by 2.1 pps. in the EA19 and
by 1.5 pps. in the EU).

The current forecast is based on the ESA 2010
system of national accounts for all Member States,
the EU and the euro area aggregates.

Calendar effects on GDP growth and output
gaps

The number of working days may differ from one
year to another. The Commission’s annual GDP
forecasts are not adjusted for the number of
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.
However, the working-day effect in the EU and the
euro area is estimated to be limited in 2018 and
2019, implying that adjusted and unadjusted annual
growth rates differ only marginally (by up to
±0.1 pps.). In 2020, this difference will be close to
¼ pps. in the euro area.
Estimations of potential GDP and output gaps are
not adjusted for working days. Furthermore, since
the working-day effect is considered temporary, it
is not expected to affect cyclically-adjusted
balances.

PART II
Prospects by individual economy

Member States

1. BELGIUM
Weaker growth momentum, slower public debt reduction
Economic growth is expected to ease to 1.5% in 2018 and 2019 as the rise in domestic demand is offset
by weakening world trade. With the headline general government deficit forecast to deteriorate slightly
throughout the forecast horizon, the pace of debt reduction is expected to slow down.
Economic growth in Belgium slowed slightly to
1.4% (y-o-y) in the first half of the year and is
expected to continue broadly at the same pace in
the rest of 2018. Despite positive net exports,
weaker household and public consumption growth
are forecast to weigh on GDP growth, which
should decline compared to 2017 but remain
robust (1.5% in 2018). Continued improvements in
labour market conditions as well as sustained
investment are paving the way for domestic
demand to remain a strong growth engine over the
forecast horizon.
Soft and hard indicators remained high in
September but have deteriorated since the end of
2017, suggesting that Belgium’s economic growth
momentum is abating, in parallel with the euro
area in general. Overall, real GDP growth is
expected to stabilise to 1.5% in 2019 and to slow
down gently to 1.4% in 2020.

Investment to continue supporting demand

Investment’s contribution to growth is expected to
moderate slightly. Business investment is set to
slow down gradually, on the back of lower
capacity utilisation and weakening exports.
Housing investment is projected to increase
moderately amid a relatively benign interest rates
environment. The regional and national electoral
cycle, together with the start of large infrastructure
works are expected to drive public investment
growth markedly over the forecast horizon. All in
all, total annual investment growth is forecast to
slow slightly from 2.6% in 2018 to 2.0% in 2020.
The contribution of net exports to growth is
projected to become slightly negative in 2020 as
growing domestic demand supports import levels,
while exports growth weakens.
Downside risks to the outlook are mainly external,
Belgium being a small open economy. They
include potential impacts on the economy from a
slow-down in demand in Belgium’s main trading
partners.

Strong labour market to underpin private

The job market should continue developing
favourably, as employment growth is forecast to
remain strong at 1% in 2018 and to decelerate
gradually in 2019 and 2020. Amid growing labour
shortages, unemployment in Belgium is expected
to fall slightly below 6% in 2020. Household
consumption is expected to slowdown in 2018, due
to sustained inflation and lower confidence.

However, both rising disposable income, thanks to
labour market developments and wage indexation,
and a slight weakening of households’ savings rate
should support stronger private consumption
growth in 2019 and 2020.

Inflation to stabilise and converge with euro
area at the end of the forecast horizon

Headline inflation is forecast to remain high at
2.3% in 2018 and 2.1% in 2019, before falling to
1.6% in 2020. This should notably stem from the
rapid transmission of rising fossil fuel prices into
retail energy prices, and from the assumed impact
of temporary electricity supply bottlenecks on
wholesale prices. Sector-specific administrative
measures and weak competition in some business
and professional services sectors are also expected
to contribute to higher core inflation in 2020,
which will be reflected in automatic wage
indexation. The inflation gap with the euro area is
expected to narrow gradually and close in 2020.

Deficit expected to edge up again

In 2018, the headline deficit is projected to widen
slightly to 1.0% of GDP, from 0.9% of GDP in
2017. This deficit corresponds to a decrease in
revenue and expenditure of 0.3 and 0.2 percentage
point of GDP respectively. Additional reductions
in personal income taxation (-0.3 pps. of GDP.)
and social security contributions (-0.2 pps. of
GDP) largely explain the decline in the revenue-toGDP ratio, as in 2018 the second phase of a
planned “tax shift” to reduce the tax burden on
labour kicks in. By contrast, taxes on consumption
and on corporate income are expected to increase
each respectively by 0.2 pps. and 0.1 pps. of GDP.
Specifically, advanced corporate income tax
payments are expected to remain strong, fostered
by higher penalties associated with insufficient
prepayments. Primary expenditure is expected to
decrease only marginally (-0.04 pps. of GDP),
therefore most of the decrease in public spending
is expected to stem from lower interest payments
(-0.1 pps. of GDP). Despite a broadly neutral
structural effort, the structural balance is forecast
to improve to -1.3% of GDP in 2018 due to a
rounding effect.

In 2019, the headline deficit is expected to widen
to 1.1% of GDP, as already specified tax cuts will
not be fully offset by revenue-increasing or
expenditure-decreasing measures. Specifically,
further reductions in personal income taxation and
social security contributions (the last phase of the
“tax shift”) explain a decline in the revenue-toGDP ratio of 0.3 pps. whereas expenditure is
expected to decrease by only 0.1 pps. of GDP. The
structural budget balance is expected to remain
stable at -1.3% of GDP. In 2020, under a nopolicy-change assumption, the headline deficit is
expected to further widen to 1.3% of GDP. The
structural balance is estimated to deteriorate by
about ½ pps. of GDP.
The debt ratio is projected to continue its
decreasing path, from 103.4% of GDP in 2017 to
98.7% of GDP in 2020. It is forecast to decrease
by 2 pps. of GDP in 2018, mainly thanks to a
snowball effect (as nominal growth outpaces
interest payments), although this dynamic is
softened by some upward stock-flow adjustments.

2. BULGARIA
Robust growth ahead
Bulgaria’s growth momentum is expected to remain strong, mainly thanks to solid domestic demand,
with private consumption supported by real wage growth. High demand, increased capacity utilisation
and EU funding are set to boost investment, while imports should outpace exports, leading to a further
reduction in the current account surplus. Energy prices and domestic demand increases are expected to
lift inflation. The government balance is set to remain positive and public debt should continue falling.
Steady, robust growth

Real GDP growth in Bulgaria is expected to reach
3.5% this year, driven by strong domestic demand
dynamics as seen in the first half of this year.
Private consumption growth is supported by
positive developments in the labour market,
increased real disposable income and positive
consumer sentiment. Capacity utilisation has
continued to increase, which bodes well for
investment. Both private and public investment
remain strong, enjoying the support of the low
interest rate environment and EU funding.

Investment is set to contribute further to the
economy's growth, as more projects co-financed
by the EU get underway or progress. The
contribution of the external sector to growth is
forecast to be less negative in 2019 and 2020 as
exports are expected to rebound, while import
growth is set to moderate somewhat. The positive
output gap is projected to widen.
Risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the
downside. These mainly concern external demand,
which could be hampered by political and
economic risks in some major trading partners. On
the positive side, a tightening labour market could
lead to higher-than-expected increases in wages
and income, which in turn could have a stronger
positive impact on private consumption.

Overall, headline inflation has further increased
and is projected to reach 2.6% on average in 2018.
This is due to the rise in energy prices passing
through to service prices, while strong domestic
demand and increases in unprocessed food prices
due to a lower harvest over the summer added to
inflationary pressures. Over the remaining forecast
period, inflation is expected to decrease somewhat
to 2.0% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020 as a result of
base effects, despite the support of strong demand
and high wage growth.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Export growth in 2017 has been significantly
revised upward. This strong base effect, as well as
some one-off events and a decline in exports to
Turkey, led to a slow-down of export growth in
2018. At the same time, strong domestic demand is
set to keep import growth above that of exports,
resulting in a negative contribution of net export to
GDP growth.
In 2019 and 2020, real GDP growth is forecast to
increase slightly to 3.7% and 3.6%, respectively.
Domestic demand is expected to remain the engine
of growth in both years. In 2019, public
consumption is set to accelerate due to additional
rises in public sector wages and intermediate
consumption. Strong consumer confidence and

88

increases in real disposable income will continue
to support private consumption, although
somewhat more moderately than in 2018.

Record low unemployment

The unemployment rate in Buglaria came close to
its pre-crisis low in 2017, thanks to strong
employment growth. The unemployment rate is set
to reach 6.0% in 2018 and to further declice to
5.7% by 2020. Labour shortages and planned
government wage increases are expected to drive
wage growth above productivity growth over the
forecast period.

Member States, Bulgaria

Sustained positive budget balance

The supportive macroeconomic environment and
an overall prudent approach to fiscal policy should
lead to sustained budget surpluses over the forecast
period. The general government surplus is
expected to narrow slighty from 1.1% of GDP in
2017 to 0.8% of GDP in 2018 due to more
dynamic public investment and public sector pay
rises. At the same time, revenues are expected to
increase significantly as transfers from EU funds
accelerate and tax collection improves thanks to
both macroeconomic conditions and tax
compliance measures.
In 2019 and 2020, the general government surplus
is forecast to decrease a bit more to 0.6% of GDP
mainly due to the government plans to further
increase public sector wages and capital spending
from national resources. Strong GDP growth and
higher wages in the economy are expected to boost
tax revenue and balance the expected current

expenditure increases. At the same time, EU funds
are set to continue finance a large part of public
investment growth.
The budget forecast is subject to some uncertainty,
particularly as regards the nationally funded
component of the public investment. A large
investment in the railway sector, which depends on
a yet-to-be-contracted Sofia airport concession and
some announced military procurement could have
a significant impact on budget balances in the next
few years, but for both cases the time schedule is
not clear as yet.
The structural budget surplus is set to decrease
over the forecast period from around 1% of GDP
in 2017 to around ¼% in 2020, reflecting the
changes in the headline balance and the positive
output gap. Meanwhile, interest spending is
reducing and public debt is forecast to drop to
below 20% of GDP by 2020.

3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC
GDP growth to remain solid amid downside risks
After a strong 2017, economic growth in the Czech Republic is expected to moderate in 2018 and
continue declining towards potential growth over the next two years. Domestic demand looks set to be
the main driver of GDP growth, with labour shortages and dependence on the external sector seen as
potential downside risks for the economy. Inflation is forecast to gradually stabilise at around the 2%
target rate. The government budget surplus is expected to decline but remain positive over the forecast
horizon.
Domestic demand driving GDP growth in 2018

The Czech economy is expected to grow by 3.0%
in 2018, somewhat less than in 2017, when GDP
expanded at its second-highest rate in a decade
(4.3%). Domestic demand, excluding inventories,
propelled GDP growth in the first half of 2018.
Investment gained momentum boosted by the
automation needs in manufacturing and the surge
of public investment supported by EU funds. Wage
dynamics and consumer confidence boosted
private consumption, while raises in public salaries
lifted public expenditure. Conversely, net exports
and inventories contributed negatively to year-onyear growth. These dynamics are forecast to
continue in the second half of 2018. Overall,
domestic demand, excluding inventories, is
expected to remain the principal driver of annual
GDP growth, while inventories and, to a lesser
extent, net exports will depress growth in 2018.

GDP growth converging towards potential in
the medium term

GDP growth is expected to slow slightly in 2019
and 2020 (2.9% and 2.6%, respectively) towards
estimated potential growth rates. Household
consumption will benefit from rapid wage growth
and social transfers, while their savings will
recover to a rate of close to 11% of gross

90

disposable income. Investment growth is set to
moderate after peaking in 2018, although both the
private and the public sector will continue to
support investment activity, especially in
machinery. Likewise, the moderation in
investment growth is expected to lead to a slight
deceleration in import growth due to the relatively
high import content of Czech investment. As a
result, the contribution of net exports to GDP
growth is forecast to be neutral in 2019 and
slightly positive in 2020.
External environment and labour shortages
remain the main downside risks

As a small open economy, the Czech Republic is
highly dependent on the external sector. In the first
half of 2018, weak external demand coupled with
exchange rate appreciation weighed on economic
growth. These two factors pose a risk in the near
term.
Moreover, the competitiveness of Czech exports
could be affected by rising real unit labour costs,
which are forecast to grow strongly in the short
term (around 5% in 2018) and moderate later (to
about 2½% in 2019 and 1% in 2020). On the one
hand, the combination of very low unemployment
and a low ratio of job seekers per vacancy (both
the lowest in the EU) should stoke wage pressures.
On the other hand, there seems to be a lag in the
realisation of productivity gains from investment
in automation that may persist in the near term.
Gradual return to inflation target supported by
monetary policy normalisation

HICP inflation is forecast at 2.1% in 2018, down
from 2.4% in 2017. Price dynamics will accelerate
at the turn of 2018-2019, influenced by base
effects and higher energy prices. Headline inflation
is expected to gradually return to the Czech
National Bank's (CNB) 2% target in the second
half of 2019 and remain close to it in 2020. Annual
HICP inflation is forecast at 2.2% in 2019 and

Member States, The Czech Republic

1.8% in 2020. While pro-inflationary factors (in
particular wage growth and oil prices) are still
prevailing, the ongoing normalisation of the CNB's
monetary policy rates – there have been six rate
hikes since August 2017 – should temper
inflationary pressures.
General government surplus to decrease

In 2018, the general government budget surplus is
expected to reach 1.4% of GDP (down from 1.5%
in 2017), driven by almost equal rises of around
7% in both revenues and expenditures. The central
and the local government balances and the social
security funds are all expected to stay in surplus.
The public wage hike and the higher indexation of
pensions will most likely be fully offset by strong
tax and non-tax revenue increases. Recent
measures to address tax avoidance seem to have
been successful in increasing VAT receipts, while
the buoyant economy and rising wages are likely
to bring in additional revenue from income taxes.
Although some increases have been postponed to
2019, public wages are expected to grow by
double digits in 2018.

In 2019, the headline budget surplus is expected to
fall to 0.8% of GDP due to higher public wage
growth and discretionary pension measures. While
revenues are expected to grow in line with the
economy, expenditures are expected to increase
significantly. Public wage hikes and recently
adopted pension increases are expected to raise
expenditure by around ½% of GDP. In 2020, the
headline budget surplus is expected to remain
broadly steady at around 0.7% of GDP. As the end
of the current EU funding cycle is approaching,
public investment is expected to grow faster than
GDP over the forecast horizon. Interest payments
are also expected to increase somewhat over the
forecast horizon.
The structural balance remained in surplus in 2017
at around 1% of GDP and a similar value is
expected for 2018. Nonetheless, as the headline
balance is expected to decrease, the structural
balance is also expected to narrow. The debt-toGDP ratio is set to decrease steadily from 34.7% of
GDP in 2017 to 31.2% of GDP in 2020.

4. DENMARK
Temporary slowdown
Economic growth in Denmark is forecast to remain solid despite a temporary slowdown in 2018.
Private consumption supported by fiscal measures is set to become the main driver of growth. The
general government nominal headline position is expected to remain close to balance.
Volatile figures

Domestic demand remains robust

After reaching a decade high of 2.3% in 2017, real
GDP growth in Denmark is forecast to abate to
1.2% in 2018. This slowdown is primarily due to
temporary factors. A large payment for the use of a
Danish patent (recorded as a service export) lifted
real GDP growth by 0.4 pps. in 2017, but causes a
similar slowdown in 2018. In addition, weather
conditions have negatively affected agricultural
production further dragging down economic
developments this year. Real GDP is projected to
expand at a rate of 1.8% and 2019 before slowing
down to 1.6% in 2020 due to the weakening of
growth in Denmark’s main export markets.

Private consumption was temporarily suppressed
in 2017 by uncertainties related to changes in car
taxation in 2017-Q3, which resulted in a 1.6%
growth rate last year. In addition, robust
employment growth, steadily rising disposable
incomes and a number of fiscal measures are also
expected to boost household incomes. The latter
include payments to households from the reform of
the voluntary early retirement scheme in 2018 and
the repayment of excessively-collected property
taxes at the end of 2019. As a result, private
consumption is projected to grow at a rate of
around 2.3% over the forecast horizon, becoming
the main engine of economic growth.

GDP (y-o-y%)

Labour market remains strong

Despite a gradual tightening of the labour market,
employment growth is expected to remain robust
in the coming years. The labour force, which is
projected to continue expanding largely thanks to
past pension and labour market reforms, should
help sustain the trend. Over the forecast horizon,
employment growth is expected to outpace the
growth of the labour force, so the unemployment
rate should continue to fall gradually from 5.7% in
2017 to 4.7% in 2020. Low unemployment and
increasing labour shortages in several sectors are
projected to fuel wage growth.

92

Investment is set to jump by 8.2% in 2018, partly
due to a large import of ships in the second
quarter, which is set to swell both equipment
investment and imports this year. This temporary
lift will have a negative base effect on investment
next year, resulting in a relatively low growth rate
of 1.4% in 2019, before rising again to 2.6% in
2020. Excluding this temporary factor, the
underlying investment growth remains robust.
Rising housing prices have now spread outside the
main urban areas, and are expected to support a
further strong increase in residential property
investment. Machinery and equipment investment
remains solid but is set to gradually weaken
towards 2020, in line with expected developments
in Denmark’s main trading partners.
Fall in the current account surplus

The above mentioned temporary factors also add
to the volatility in Denmark’s foreign trade figures.
Exports are forecast to grow by a mere 0.6% this
year due to the negative base effect of last year’s
patent exports. On the other hand, imports have
been lifted by the large import of ships in
2018-Q2. As a result of these transactions, the
current account surplus is projected to fall from
7.8% of GDP in 2017 to 6.1% in 2018, without
indicating
a
deterioration
in
Danish
competitiveness. Over the forecast horizon,
exports and imports are expected to resume their

Member States, Denmark

steady trend growth, albeit at a weaker pace than
growth in Denmark’s export markets. With
imports boosted by robust private consumption and
investment, the current account surplus is set to
hover around 6% of GDP.
Slowly increasing inflation

Notwithstanding rising oil prices, solid economic
growth and a tightening labour market, HICP
inflation is forecast to decline from 1.1% in 2017
to 0.8% in 2018, below the euro area average. This
is mainly due to taxation changes and the slow rise
of food prices so far this year. Rising energy prices
are expected to lift consumer price inflation to
1.5% in 2019, while increasing wage growth is set
to lift it up further to 1.7% in 2020.
Solid public finances

After turning out at 1.1% of GDP in 2017, the
general government headline surplus is projected
to fall to 0.2% of GDP in 2018. The estimated
decline of the surplus is primarily the result of an
expected fall in the pension yield tax revenue from
the high level reached in 2017. While the
continuously strong labour market is set to

increase current taxes on income and wealth,
slowing economic growth is putting downward
pressure on corporate tax revenue. The reform of
the voluntary early retirement scheme has led to a
reimbursement of DKK 4 bn (0.2% of GDP) to
households in early 2018.
The budget balance is projected to deteriorate
further to -0.1% of GDP in 2019 due to a one-off
repayment of DKK 15.5 bn (0.7% of GDP) of
excessively-collected property taxes to households
and companies, even though the underlying
position is improving. Accordingly, the balance is
projected to improve again in 2020 to an estimated
surplus of 0.6% of GDP.
The structural balance is expected to decline to
½% of GDP in 2018 due to the transfers associated
with the reform of the voluntary early retirement
scheme. For the remainder of the forecast horizon,
it is projected to stabilise at around 1% of GDP.
Public gross debt is projected to fall from 36.1% of
GDP in 2017 to 30.5% in 2020 due to positive
primary balances, low interest rates and stable
growth.

5. GERMANY
Domestic demand set to continue driving growth
Germany’s economy has entered its sixth year of expansion. The strong labour market and ample fiscal
capacity are expected to support domestic demand and sustain growth momentum. At the same time, the
external environment is becoming less supportive for German exporters. Business investment growth is
likely to weaken due to the increase in uncertainty surrounding global trade and the automotive sector.
Solid momentum amid growing concerns

GDP growth in early 2018 was driven by domestic
demand, while export growth weakened. Private
consumption growth improved after stagnating in
the second half of last year. Public consumption
resumed growth in the second quarter after
declining in the first, due to the prolonged process
of forming a government after the elections. In
response to the favourable financing conditions
and high capacity utilisation, housing and business
investment were quite dynamic in the first quarter
and increased further in the second, albeit at a
slower pace.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Forward looking indicators point to a cooling of
sentiment and weakening foreign demand. In the
third quarter extraordinary sectoral factors are
likely to weaken growth significantly. However, a
rebound is expected in the last quarter. More
generally, while considerable order backlogs in
manufacturing and construction should sustain
growth in the short run, the escalation of
protectionism and rising financing costs in a
number of countries could affect German exports
by constraining investment demand. Domestic
investment is expected to weaken due to
uncertainty about global trade and the future of key
industries linked to the automotive sector.
However, aggregate demand should benefit from a
strong labour market and rising incomes over the

94

forecast horizon, not least due to fiscal support.
Supply constraints due to a slower expansion of
the labour force and tight capacity are forecast to
weigh on growth, although activity is expected to
be boosted by a calendar effect of about 0.3 pps. in
2020. Overall, real GDP is expected to increase by
1.7% this year, 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.
Strong labour market to support consumption

Employment growth is set to lead to further
declines in the unemployment rate, which stood at
a post-unification low of 3.4% between May and
August. Inflows of foreign workers could help
sustain employment growth, but most probably
less than in recent years. Recently arrived refugees
account for about 0.2 pps. of mid-year
employment growth in 2018 (1.3%), which
indicates that progress is being made in their
integration into the labour market. Although this
trend is expected to continue improving marginally
over the forecast horizon, significant unused
potential is likely to remain. The relative scarcity
of labour seems to be having an impact on wage
settlements and is expected to boost wage growth
over the forecast horizon. With inflation at
moderate levels, this should be positive for
household purchasing power. The fiscal support
for households envisaged in the Coalition
Agreement, coming into effect in 2019, should
provide an additional boost to disposable income.
These developments are expected to sustain
consumption growth, while allowing households to
maintain their high saving rate.
Investment growth subject to uncertainty

Business investment growth is expected to weaken
in the coming quarters as export prospects
deteriorate and capacity expansion is reconsidered.
At the same time, some manufacturers, e.g. in the
automotive sector, may need to make significant
investments to overhaul their product range.
Housing investment may face supply constraints,
while demand remains strong, judging from order
levels and a pick-up in building permits.

Member States, Germany

The large external
declining moderately

surplus

to

continue

Solid domestic demand is expected to lead to a
further increase in the import-to-GDP ratio. In
addition, export growth may prove weaker than in
recent years given the increasingly protectionist
policies of some of Germany’s main trading
partners and a probable reshuffling of value chains.
As a result, the current account surplus is forecast
to continue declining in the coming years.
Inflation to remain moderate

Core inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed
food) is expected to remain at 1.5% in 2018 and
gradually increase to 1.8% in 2020 in a context of
robust consumption and wage growth. Headline
inflation is expected to pick up to 1.8% in 2018
and 1.9% in 2019 in line with rising energy prices.
In 2020, energy prices are projected to ease
slightly, bringing headline inflation down to 1.6%.
Budget surpluses reaching new heights

The budget balance is expected to peak in 2018 at
1.6% of GDP and to stay above 1% of GDP

thereafter. The above-average increase in tax
revenues, backed by rising wages and private
consumption, is driving government revenues up
in 2018. At the same time, the budget for 2018 was
only adopted in the middle of the year, leading to
restrained government expenditure. Nevertheless,
public investment is expected to increase strongly
in 2018, helped by the good financial situation of
some municipalities.
The budget surplus is expected to decrease in 2019
as measures outlined in the March 2018 Coalition
agreement start to have effect. The reductions in
personal income taxes together with higher family
benefits are set to dampen government revenues,
while additional spending for pensions and
security are projected to increase expenditure.
The positive structural balance is projected to peak
in 2018 at about 1½% of GDP and to deteriorate
thereafter by around half a percentage point.
Government debt is projected to fall to the 60%
Maastricht-threshold at the end of 2018 and to
continue decreasing to about 57% of GDP by 2019
and 54% of GDP by 2020.

6. ESTONIA
Flexible labour market supports growth in the short term
Both cyclical factors, including external demand, and structural factors, such as a flexible labour
market, have supported Estonia’s economic growth in recent years. Employment growth, which
continued to be rapid in 2018 even though employment and participation rates were high, is projected
to slow over the forecast horizon. The budget is expected to turn to a surplus from 2018 onwards, but
the underlying structural fiscal position is estimated to remain in deficit.
External and domestic demand contribute to a
balanced growth outlook

Estonia's economy is forecast to expand by 3.5%
in 2018. Growth has been broad based, with the
export sector contributing strongly alongside
domestic demand. This reflects buoyancy in export
markets as well as the sustained competitiveness of
industrial manufacturing and, most notably, the
ICT services sector. Capacity constraints have
been alleviated by the flexibility of the labour
market, with labour supply being sustained
through inward migration. Borrowing by
households has remained stable, with saving rates
close to the EU average.
Strong private consumption growth of over 4%,
driven by the rise in disposable incomes, which
reflects high employment and participation rates, is
the main driver of domestic demand. Investment
growth is set to fall back to 2.6% in 2018 after
12.7% in 2017, when a number of important oneoff projects coincided with peak absorption of EU
structural funds. Output growth is expected to be
particularly strong in the manufacturing, ICT
services, transport and logistics, and construction
sectors. The energy production sector also stands
to benefit from high oil prices. Corporate profit
margins, however, are likely to decrease as the
tight labour market has pushed up wages and unit
labour costs, while productivity growth has
slowed.
In 2019 and 2020, domestic demand is expected to
be tempered by more moderate employment and
wage growth. Investment, however, is forecast to
make a bigger contribution to growth, as
companies need to invest to overcome capacity
constraints
and
maintain
competitiveness.
Industrial exports, by contrast, are expected to
weaken, in line with the outlook for foreign
demand. Overall, GDP growth is expected to slow
to 2.8% in 2019 and 2.6% 2020, slightly below the
economy’s estimated long-term potential growth
rate.

In 2018, HICP inflation is forecast to reach 3.5%,

impact given the relatively large share of energy in
in Estonia inflation basket compared to other
Member States. At the same time, the pass-through
of higher wages on to services prices has been
relatively moderate in recent quarters. Inflation is
expected to moderate over the coming years to
3.3% in 2019 and 2.5% in 2020, in line with
commodity price trends. Also, the inflationary
impact from sharp increases in consumption taxes
prior to 2018 will fade over 2019 and 2020.
Labour market surprises on the upside

Employment is projected to grow by about 1% in
2018 and to slow substantially thereafter, under the
influence of negative demographic factors. High
labour demand and successful labour market
policies minimised the negative effect on the
employment rate of the Work Ability Reform,
introduced in recent years, which incentivised
people outside the labour force to seek work.
Many people with limited capacity to work have
been able to find a job after having re-entered the
labour market. Scarcity of labour supply was also
alleviated somewhat by greater use of EU labour

Member States, Estonia

mobility provisions, such as the Posted Workers
Directive, which helped to address labour needs in
the growing construction and manufacturing
sectors. Estonia’s labour market is expected to
operate at close to full capacity over the forecast
horizon, feeding wage pressures and eroding
competitiveness in some sectors of the economy,
such as export-oriented manufacturing.
Public expenditure grows rapidly but budget
remains in nominal surplus

The general government recorded a deficit of 0.4%
of GDP in 2017. This is projected to turn into a
surplus of 0.5% of GDP in 2018, in spite of several
new expenditure programmes in healthcare,
education, social funding and in financing local
government mergers. The stronger fiscal balance
emerges from better-than-expected tax revenues,
as a result of rapid employment and wage growth,
as well as cyclically buoyant consumption and
construction activity, which boosted VAT
revenues. Also, the fiscal cost of the 2018 personal

income tax reform appears to have partly shifted
from 2018 to 2019, due to the timing effects of tax
allowances.
The fiscal surplus is forecast to remain fairly stable
at around 0.5% of GDP in 2019 before abating to
0.2% of GDP in 2020. While the outlook for
revenues is expected to remain favourable over the
forecast horizon, expenditures are expected to rise.
In particular, social expenditures are set to grow
relatively rapidly due to an indirect link to overall
wage growth.
Given that the economy is operating well above its
potential, the structural fiscal position is expected
to remain in a deficit of about ¾% of GDP in 2018
and to stay at that level over the forecast horizon.
Public debt is forecast to remain low and to fall to
below 8% by 2020.The main negative risks to this
fiscal projection pertain to the broader
macroeconomic risks, which could erode the
revenue base, while expenditure is set to grow at a
relatively rapid pace.

7. IRELAND
Strong labour market and investment supporting domestic growth
GDP growth in Ireland is expected to be strong this year, driven largely by the activities of
multinational companies, but the pace is projected to moderate. The positive performance of the labour
market and construction investment are expected to support the domestic economy in the near term. The
government deficit is projected to turn slowly into a surplus, but risks to the fiscal outlook remain.
Domestic economy expected to grow at a
solid pace…

Ireland reported 9.1% GDP growth in the first half
of the year, a level well above the euro area
average but distorted by the activities of
multinational companies. The economy is forecast
to expand by 7.8% this year but growth should
moderate to 4.5% in 2019 and 3.8% in 2020.
Modified domestic demand, a measure of domestic
activity that strips out some of the effects of
multinationals, grew by 6.3% (y-o-y) in the first
half of 2018. It is projected to expand at an
average rate of over 4.0% between 2018 and 2020.

Moderate inflation to support consumption

HICP inflation remained subdued in the first half
of 2018 but accelerated in the third quarter as
global oil prices rose. HICP inflation is projected
to increase by 0.7% in 2018, driven by higher
energy and services prices and is forecast to reach
1.2% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020, as service prices
rise in line with strong domestic demand. The
modest inflation outlook is expected to remain
favourable to the purchasing power of households.

0

Trade developments remain highly volatile

-2

Through the first half of 2018, total exports
increased by 8.7% (y-o-y), driven largely by trade
in pharmaceutical goods while exports of services
grew only modestly. Over the same period, total
imports declined by 3.7% (y-o-y) mainly due to a
strong fall in imports of services related to research
and development by multinationals. By contrast,
imports of goods increased by 7.2%.
Consequently, net exports are expected to
contribute considerably to GDP growth in 2018. In
2019 and 2020, net exports are expected to
contribute positively to GDP growth, although
significantly less than in 2018. However, headline
trade figures will likely continue to be influenced
by the activities of multinationals.

Investment
Net exports

…supported by employment and investment

Employment, in particular full-time employment,
increased strongly in the first half of 2018. Both
the employment rate and participation rates, which
remain below pre-crisis peaks, are expected to
continue trending upward. The unemployment rate
stood at 5.4% in September 2018 and is forecast to
drop below 5% in 2020. Household earnings also
grew, driven by robust job creation and moderate
increases in hourly wages. The tightening of the
labour market is expected to put upward pressure
on wages and thus support household disposable
income over the forecast horizon.

98

Construction activity was strong in the first half of
2018 and is expected to maintain momentum,
driven by persistent supply shortages. Over the
same period, investment in machinery and
equipment picked up, partly matched by an
associated increase in imports in this category, and
is projected to expand by 15.7% in this year.
However, headline investment declined by 16.5%
(y-o-y) mostly due to a slowdown in imports of
intellectual property, with a neutral effect on GDP.

External risks to the outlook on the downside

Ireland’s economic outlook is subject to significant
uncertainties related, inter alia, to changes in the
international taxation and trade environment. A
large degree of unpredictability remains linked to

Member States, Ireland

the activities of multinationals, which could drive
headline growth either up or down.
Public finances supported by buoyant tax
revenues

The headline government balance is projected to
improve to -0.1% of GDP in 2018. Cash returns
for the first three quarters of 2018 were broadly in
line with government projections, notwithstanding
some expenditure slippages, particularly in the
health area. Tax revenues increased by 6.6% over
the twelve months to September, partly
compensating for strong expenditure growth.
Ireland's 2019 Draft Budgetary Plan includes new
spending measures and reductions of personal
income tax of around 0.5% of GDP. These
expansionary measures are partly financed by
revenue raising measures of 0.2% of GDP.

Including
the
pre-committed
expenditure
increases, the balance is expected to stay
unchanged in 2019 and, based on a no-policy
change assumption, register a surplus of 0.2% of
GDP in 2020. The main risks to the fiscal outlook
remain on the downside, reflecting uncertainty as
regards the economic outlook, the sustainability of
the current level of some sources of government
revenue (notably corporate income taxes) and
over-spending within the health sector.
After remaining steady in 2018, the structural
balance is expected to deteriorate in 2019 before
improving in 2020. The general government debt
ratio is projected to decline to 63.9% of GDP in
2018 and to fall further to 61.1% and 56.0% of
GDP in 2019 and 2020 respectively. This is
contingent on continued stable medium-term
economic growth and positive primary balances.

8. GREECE
Programme exit amid strengthening recovery
Greece has exited its European Stability Mechanism programme and economic growth is taking hold,
though vulnerabilities remain. Sustaining the reform momentum will be instrumental in underpinning
investment and convergence. Employment is recovering and exports are expected to perform well by
historical standards. Solid growth, in combination with low borrowing needs and high primary fiscal
surpluses should help to reduce significantly the debt-to-GDP ratio.
The forecast is based on a no-policy-change fiscal
scenario for 2019-2020 with implications for the
macroeconomic outlook and as such, it is not
directly comparable with the previous forecasts.
Once the fiscal package to reach the 3.5% of GDP
primary surplus target is finalised, the forecast
will be duly adjusted.
Sustained growth

After a strong first quarter of 2.5% (y-o-y) growth,
real GDP growth in Greece decreased in 2018-Q2
to 1.8% (y-o-y), corresponding to 0.2% (q-o-q, in
seasonally adjusted terms).
Private consumption grew dynamically for the
second consecutive quarter, increasing by 0.6%
(q-o-q) in 2018-Q2. Exports recorded a strong
3.9% quarterly growth, driven mainly by services.
Imports, however, rebounded strongly from the
contraction in the previous quarter, so the overall
impact of net exports on growth was negative.
Investment remained flat, while government
consumption decreased.
Commitment to reforms is key to further growth

The current forecast rests on an assumption of no
policy change for fiscal policy in 2019 and 2020.
This is projected to result in a primary surplus of
3.9% of GDP (ESM programme definition).
Negotiations for the 2019 budget are ongoing, and
it is expected that the final package of measures
will lead to a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP for
2019. In this event, real growth rates would be
higher and could reach 2.3% of GDP in 2019-20,
which is in line with earlier Commission forecasts.
For 2018, GDP growth is slightly revised to 2.0%,
up from 1.9% earlier, on the back of improved
consumption dynamics. Investment is expected to
contract this year, as the rebound in construction is
seen as insufficient to balance the contraction in
equipment investment. Greece’s export shares
have started to increase after several years of
decline. Due to falling investment, imports have
been markedly lower than anticipated. Net exports

100

are therefore expected to be the main contributor to
growth this year.
Based on the no-fiscal-policy-change assumption,
growth is forecast to remain at 2.0% in 2019 and
2020. Investment is expected to become an
important driver of growth as structural reforms
start to bear fruit, provided that post-programme
reform implementation is strong. Imports are
expected to rise as investment rebounds and net
exports thus turn negative.
The
labour
market
recovery
continues.
Employment is expected to grow by 1.8% in 2018,
bringing unemployment below 17% by 2020.
HICP inflation is forecast to reach 0.8% this year,
and to accelerate further in 2019 as the output gap
closes and energy prices rise. With the expected
decline in oil prices in 2020, inflation is set to
decrease. Real wages are expected to rise
gradually, in line with productivity gains.

The forecast also assumes that reform momentum
will be maintained, providing credibility and a
good investment climate. Downside risks include:
domestic policy slippages as well as adverse
external developments related to international
financial markets and geopolitical developments
Public debt is set to decrease rapidly

The general government balance is projected to
record a surplus in 2018, the third year in a row.

Member States, Greece

Building on the fiscal adjustment achieved in
recent years, the outcome for 2018 is also expected
to benefit from solid growth in the macro bases, a
broad-based recovery in taxable profits and higher
energy prices. As usual, the forecast assumes a full
utilisation of spending ceilings. Underspending
would improve the 2018 outturn over and above
what is projected at present.
Under a no-policy-change assumption, Greece is
set to over-achieve the primary surplus targets
agreed in June this year in 2019 and 2020.(68) The
main drivers of the emerging fiscal space are the
still large output gap, the growing benefits of past
pension reforms and ceilings on healthcare
spending and new hirings, which help to keep
expenditure dynamics in check.
The no-policy-change forecast assumes the
implementation of the post-programme package
legislated in 2017 to enter into force in 2019 and
2020, in a fiscally broadly neutral manner. The
authorities have reiterated their commitment to
achieve the primary surplus target of 3.5% of GDP
(68)

The primary balance monitored under the Enhanced
Surveillance excludes inter alia SMP and ANFA revenues,
revenues from the sale or lease of real estate, bank
recapitalisation costs and migration-related expenditure.

agreed with the Eurogroup in June 2018. At the
same time, Greece’s Draft Budgetary Plan
indicated the government’s intention to replace the
measures pre-legislated for 2019 by an alternative
policy package. The size and the design of the
compromise package are still under discussion and
it has not been included in the current projection.
While continued improvements in the collection of
tax debt represent an upside, there are also
important downside risks, such as ongoing court
cases that could trigger a partial reversal of earlier
reforms and give rise to fiscal liabilities.
Additional pressure could arise from new policy
initiatives affecting the public wage bill.
Overall, under the no-policy-change assumption,
the general government balance is expected to
remain stable at 0.6% of GDP over the forecast
horizon. In view of the projected narrowing of the
output gap, the structural balance is forecast to
gradually decline from around 4.0% of GDP in
2018 to 1.5% of GDP in 2020. Greece’s public
debt is expected to peak at 182.5% this year and to
decline to 167.4% of GDP by 2020 on account of
the recovery of growth and the high primary
surpluses forecast.

9. SPAIN
Growth to decelerate as private consumption eases
Growth is expected to remain robust but decelerate as households restrain consumption to increase
their savings. Unemployment is forecast to continue its decline despite decelerating job expansion, and
wage growth is expected to pick up. Steady decline in the government deficit is set to keep the debt ratio
on a moderate downward path.
Growth has been robust but lower than
expected in the first half of the year

Now in its fifth year of expansion, Spain’s
economy started to show signs of a mild
deceleration in the first half of the year. According
to the revised national accounts, real GDP growth
stood at 0.6% q-o-q in both Q1 and Q2, slightly
lower than anticipated. Together with a downward
revision of growth estimates for 2017, this implies
a lower growth momentum for 2018 as a whole.
The composition of growth has also been
somewhat different than anticipated, with a lower
contribution of net exports. The pace of economic
activity is projected to remain broadly stable in the
second half of 2018, as the entry into force of the
measures contained in the 2018 budget is set to
support an otherwise moderating private
consumption. Overall, GDP growth for 2018 is
now projected at 2.6%, 0.2 pps. lower than in the
summer interim forecast.

102

expected to gradually slow down but remain
dynamic over the forecast horizon.
Net exports should support growth again

After a weak start to the year, exports are expected
to accelerate in H2-2018 and 2019 and then
stabilise, as export markets recover, costcompetitiveness gains continue, and the impact of
the appreciation of the euro fades away. After
growing more strongly than expected in 2017,
imports are set to slow over the forecast horizon as
final demand moderates. As a consequence, the
contribution of net exports to growth is expected to
be negative in 2018, before turning positive again
next year. The terms of trade are forecast to
deteriorate further this year and then become
broadly neutral. These factors should result in a
decline of the current account surplus in 2018 and
2019, before improving slightly in 2020.

Growth is expected to decelerate further, to 2.2 %
in 2019 (also 0.2 pps. lower than in the summer
interim forecast) and 2.0% in 2020. The
deceleration is mainly driven by a slowdown in
private consumption, as oil prices increase further
and pent-up demand is absorbed. However, still
robust job expansion and accelerating wage growth
– also due to the planned increase in the minimum
wage - should continue to support disposable
income growth over the forecast horizon. As a
result, the saving rate, which is expected to reach a
historic low in 2018, is projected to rebound in
2019 and increase slightly further in 2020.

Unemployment set to continue falling

Investment is expected to accelerate this year,

Equipment investment, which has surprised by its

Employment growth is expected to slow down as a
consequence of the deceleration of final demand,
as well as the dampening impact of the planned
increase in the minimum wage. Still,
unemployment is set to continue falling, to 13.4%
in 2020, its lowest level since 2008. Wage growth
is expected to peak in 2019, also under the impact
of the increase of the minimum wage, and

moderate but still grow at a rate above inflation in
2020. As labour productivity is forecast to grow
moderately over the forecast horizon, this will lead
to increases in nominal unit labour costs. After
reaching 2% in 2017, HICP is expected to
gradually moderate over the forecast horizon to
1.5% in 2020, driven by base effects in oil prices.
This is despite the gradual increase in core
inflation, which is expected to reach 1.7% in 2020,
as the output gap widens and wages increase.
Budget deficit set to continue narrowing

After decreasing by 1.4 pps. to 3.1% of GDP in
2017, the general government deficit is expected to
decline and reach 2.7% of GDP in 2018, thanks to
still robust economic growth. The somewhat
slower pace of deficit reduction is due to measures
included in the 2018 budget law, namely the
higher revaluation of pensions, the pay hike for
public employees and, to a lesser extent, the tax
cut for low-income earners. The headline deficit is
set to decline further in 2019, to 2.1% of GDP, on
the back of continued firm economic growth and
the net impact of measures in the 2019 draft
budgetary plan. The latter include higher revenues
from environmental taxes and corporate and
household income taxes, as well as new taxes on

digital services and financial transactions. Higher
expenditure on items such as pensions, long-term
care and paternity leave are also included and
partly offset the impact of revenue-raising
measures. In 2020, at unchanged policies, the
deficit is expected to narrow to 1.9% of GDP.
This forecast is based on a cautious assessment of
the measures included in the 2019 budget plan. In
particular, there is uncertainty regarding the yield
of some of the new tax measures, as well as the
fiscal impact of the planned increase of the
minimum wage. In addition, some of the planned
expenditure measures may not be fully executed.
Regarding downside risks, compensation payments
due following the Supreme Court decision of
February 2018 to declare void the ATLL water
concession in Catalonia may add to the deficit
forecast.
Spain’s structural deficit is expected to deteriorate
by about ¼% of GDP in 2018 to reach about 3% of
GDP, before stabilising around that level over the
2019-2020 period. The general government debtto-GDP ratio is expected to decrease slightly to
95.4% by 2020, as a result of strong nominal GDP
growth and the narrowing budget deficit.

10. FRANCE
Continued solid growth despite short-term volatility
Economic activity is forecast to accelerate in the second half of 2018. Private consumption is set to gain
momentum, which should somewhat compensate for the slight slowdown in investment expected in 2019
and 2020. Net trade should support GDP growth in 2018 and turn neutral afterwards. Unemployment
continues to decrease. The public deficit is forecast to fall below 2% of GDP as the structural balance is
set to improve sightly.
After five strong quarters, GDP growth in France
slowed markedly to 0.2% in the first two quarters
of the year. Temporary factors, such as the school
holiday calendar, strikes and unusually warm
weather partly explain this slowdown.
As these factors fade away, economic activity
should rebound in the third quarter when
consumption is expected to bounce back. Positive
fiscal measures (a decrease in social contributions
and a cut in the housing tax) should also support
consumption at the end of the year. Investment is
forecast to remain dynamic, in line with business
climate indicators, which remain high. Net trade is
expected to make a strong contribution to growth,
helped by large exports from the aeronautic sector.
As a result, GDP growth is expected to remain
robust at 1.7% in 2018 before cooling marginally
to 1.6% both in 2019 and 2020 (69), as spare
capacities in the economy are reabsorbed and the
external environment becomes less supportive.

Investment growth is forecast to remain buoyant in
2018 before cooling down in 2019 and 2020.
Public investment is expected to rebound in 2018
and 2019, before local elections. By contrast,
housing investment is projected to slow down
markedly after very high growth in 2017, while
corporate investment is also expected to ease,
albeit more gradually.
Export growth to decrease but remain robust

After a strong increase in 2017, exports are set to
slow down somewhat in the coming years, as
global demand growth loses momentum, external
uncertainty rises, and past euro appreciation makes
itself felt. Import growth, by contrast, should
decrease sharply on average in 2018, as service
imports contracted in 2017 and at the beginning of
2018. Imports are set to be back in line with final
demand afterwards. As a result, net exports are
expected to make a positive contribution to growth
in 2018 only, and to be neutral in 2019 and 2020.
Unemployment to continue falling

Consumption to pick up gradually, while
investment growth cools

Unemployment should continue to fall, although
by somewhat less than in 2017. Employment
growth is set to moderate as the effects of past cuts
to the labour tax wedge fade. Inflation is forecast
to increase to 2.1% in 2018, from 1.2% in 2017,
boosted by higher oil prices and increases in excise
duties. In 2019, price pressures should moderate,
reaching 1.7% as those effects wear out. Core
inflation is estimated to increase gradually.

Private consumption growth is forecast to pick up
gradually, as rising nominal wages boost

disposable incomes and prices slow down. Fiscal
measures should provide further support to
purchasing power and private consumption at the
end of 2018. Net property income is set to
accelerate in 2018 and should contribute to an
increase in the saving rate.

precautionary savings in light of the introduction
of the withholding of the income tax and the
planned lower indexation of pensions in 2019 and
2020. A prolonged decline in business sentiment
could also end up translating into a steeper decline
in growth.
Budget deficit to fall below 2% of GDP by 2020

The deficit for 2017 was revised to 2.7% of GDP,
0.1 pps. higher than in the April notification, due
to the inclusion of the recapitalisation of AREVA
NewCo/Orano, following Eurostat's reservation,
and the reclassification of SNCF Réseau under the
general government from 2016. These deficitincreasing effects are partly offset by updated
information on social security and energy
transition accounts. The headline deficit is
currently forecast to amount to 2.6% of GDP in
2018, 0.3 pps. higher than in the spring forecast.
This revision is mainly explained by the
deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and
the deficit of SNCF Réseau that adds 0.1pps. of
GDP to the general government deficit. Revenues
are set to remain strong despite the tax cuts
amounting to 0.3% of GDP. In turn, public
expenditure in nominal terms and net of tax credits
is expected to rise by 1.8%, which, once the effects

of higher inflation are netted out, reflects a decline
in real terms by 0.3%. The structural balance is
projected to remain broadly flat in 2018.
In 2019, the headline deficit is expected to increase
to 2.8% of GDP, due to the one-off deficitincreasing impact of 0.9% of GDP stemming from
the replacement of the CICE (crédit d'impôt pour
la compétitivité et l'emploi) by a permanent cut in
social contributions. Without it, the headline
deficit ratio would be 1.9% of GDP. Revenue
growth is set to remain robust as cyclical
conditions remain favourable. Tax cuts
implemented in 2019, including the second cut in
housing tax and a decrease in social contributions
are partially offset by the increase in tobacco and
environmental taxes of around 0.2% of GDP.
Public expenditure in nominal terms and net of tax
credits is expected to rise by 1.9%. The structural
balance is set to improve by around ¼ of GDP.
At unchanged policies, the deficit is set to decline
to 1.7% of GDP in 2020, mainly due to positive
cyclical conditions. Both the revenue-to-GDP and
the expenditure-to-GDP ratios are projected to
decline, by 0.3 pps. and 1.3 pps., respectively. The
debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline from
98.7% in 2018 to 97.2% in 2020.

After closing 2017 on a weak quarterly reading,
real GDP growth regained momentum in the first
half of the year, posting a 1.1% q-o-q rate in the
second quarter. Household consumption shows no
sign of losing steam, bolstered by positive trends
in employment and wages. The pace of export
growth for both goods and services slowed down
in the first half of the year and is set to moderate
further in the second half. At the same time,
imports of goods and services, while slowing
somewhat, continue posting high growth rates.
Overall, real GDP growth in Croatia is forecast at

main growth driver over the forecast horizon, as
disposable incomes benefit from rising wages and
employment, as well as steadily increasing tourist
receipts and remittances. Furthermore, the
purchasing power of households will be supported
by subdued inflation, thanks to the planned
reduction in VAT rates in 2019 and 2020, and
consumer credit at low interest rates. Also private
investment is set to benefit from continued

the forecast horizon.
by steadily increasing
trend in participation
expected to keep the

favourable financing conditions, while public
investment is projected to intensify as the currently
lagging absorption of EU funding picks up toward
the end of the programming period.
External demand for Croatian goods is expected to
remain solid. However, the pace of exports' market
share gains is likely to have peaked, and growth of
goods exports is projected to continue moderating.
Similarly, after years of record-setting numbers,
revitalised competition in the Mediterranean is
expected to have a dampening impact on the
expansion of tourism services exports. Goods
imports are projected to continue increasing
steadily on account of strong domestic demand,
while growth of imports of services is expected to
slow down. As a result of these developments, the
trade balance is set to progressively deteriorate, but
remain positive. In turn, the current account
surplus would edge down to below 2% of GDP by
2020, also thanks to higher profits in the banking
sector owing to the absence of temporary effects,
such as the Agrokor-related provisioning of last
year.
Overall, real GDP is forecast to grow by 2.8% in
2019, when it will finally exceed pre-crisis levels,
and by 2.6% in 2020, as the economy moves closer
in line with its potential output.
Core inflation set to pick up

Job creation is expected to reach 2.3% this year,
before moderating over the next two years. Wage
growth is also expected to peak this year, under the
impact of the stipulated increase in public wages.
With unemployment falling rapidly and demand
for labour intensifying in some sectors, wage
pressures in the private sector are expected to grow
stronger in 2019 and 2020. As the labour market
continues improving, migration outflows are
expected to ease and the negative trend in
participation rates is expected to turn positive.
The expected rise in energy prices this year and the
next will push up HICP inflation. Conversely, the

Member States, Croatia

VAT rate reduction on several unprocessed food
products in 2019 and the reduction of the general
VAT rate by 1 pp in 2020 are expected to exert
downward pressure on prices. Overall, the inflation
rate is projected to rise up to 1.6% in 2018 and
moderate thereafter, with core inflation picking up
toward the end of the forecast period.
Downside risks to the forecast come from the
external side. A slowdown in some of Croatia's
main EU trading partners could dampen goods
exports, while tourism could suffer more severely
than expected from intensified competition in the
Mediterranean. Positive risks may come from
investment, should there be a more substantial
pick-up in the absorption of EU funding.
Government surplus declining as contingent
liabilities materialise

After recording a first-ever surplus (0.9% of GDP
in 2017), Croatia’s public finances remain in good
shape in 2018. Revenues are growing strongly on
the back of positive labour market developments
and retail spending. Expenditure is pushed up by
rising public sector wages, partly offset by
declining
debt
servicing
costs
and
lower-than-anticipated public investment. The

materialisation
of
contingent
liabilities
(government guarantees to the shipyard industry)
in excess of 1% of GDP is expected in 2018-2019.
Largely due to this, the surplus is set to drop to
0.2% of GDP in 2018.
In 2019, revenue is expected to grow slower than
nominal GDP due to the effects of the forthcoming
tax reform, which will cut VAT, personal income
taxes and social contributions. Expenditure growth
should remain contained, largely due to the strong
base effect of the rising wage bill and capital
transfers in 2018. The surplus is thus expected to
increase to 0.4% of GDP in 2019 and fall again to
just above balance in 2020, largely on account of
public investment growth. In structural terms, the
general government balance is projected to fall
into negative territory this year and deteriorate
thereafter.
Driven by surpluses and GDP growth, the debt
ratio is set to continue declining strongly, to 68.2%
of GDP in 2020.
Risks to this forecast include the possibility of a
greater-than-expected capital transfers to distressed
companies.

12. ITALY
Italian economy and public finances at a crossroads
After solid growth in 2017, Italy’s economy slowed down over the first half of this year as exports and
industrial production weakened. A recovery in exports and higher public spending are expected to
support growth moderately over the forecast period. However, the associated rise in the government
deficit, coupled with higher interest rates and substantial downside risks, endangers the reduction of
Italy’s high debt-to-GDP ratio. Inflation is set to accelerate slightly in line with higher energy prices.
Italy’s economy is going through a soft patch

After reaching 1.6% in 2017, real output expansion
decelerated on the back of a weakening
manufacturing sector and flagging exports in the
first half of 2018. Economic activity stalled in the
third quarter, partly due to the slowdown in the
automotive sector, and is expected to remain
muted in the very near term. Real GDP growth in
2018 is forecast at 1.1%. Investment is likely to be
the main growth driver supported by tax incentives
and on average still favourable financing
conditions despite financial market turbulences.
External and internal demand support growth

In 2019, a recovery of exports and higher public
spending will help lift real GDP to 1.2%, while the
output gap is expected to close. However,
implementation
lags
and
administrative
bottlenecks are expected to delay the moderate
growth impact of policy measures over the forecast
period. The recovery of private investment is
forecast to slow down as tailwinds such as
accommodative monetary policy and tax
incentives wane and firms face tighter financing
conditions, linked to the impact of higher
sovereign spreads on the supply of credit. Private
consumption is set to continue growing at steady
albeit moderate rates thanks to moderately growing
wages and employment as well as increases in
social transfers. However, higher oil prices will
likely weigh on consumer spending.
In 2020, which has two additional working days,
real GDP growth is forecast at 1.3%, supported by
investment, especially in construction. Exports are
set to grow broadly in line with export markets,
while Italian exporters are set to keep their
competitive position, thus containing market share
losses incurred in 2018.
The growth outlook is subject to high uncertainty
amid intensified downside risks. A prolonged rise
in sovereign yields would worsen banks’ funding
conditions and further reduce credit supply, while

108

public spending could crowd out private
investment. Envisaged policy measures might
prove less effective, having a lower impact on
growth. Uncertainty about government policies
might affect sentiment and domestic demand.
Finally, the planned rollback of structural reforms
bodes ill for employment and potential growth.

Labour market is improving only slowly

Employment is expected to grow by about 1%
annually in 2018-2020, in line with economic
activity and supported by hiring incentives. The
unemployment rate is set to fall to 10% by 2020.
Wage growth accelerated in 2018 on the back of
pay rises in the public sector. However, the slack
in the labour market implies that wage pressures
and the increase in unit labour costs are likely to
remain moderate over the forecast period.
Consumer prices are set to rise moderately

The headline HICP index is expected to increase
by 1.3% this year and by 1.5% in 2019, largely
driven by higher oil prices. Headline inflation
should moderate to 1.4% in 2020, while core
inflation is forecast to rise gradually to 1.4%. The
GDP deflator is set to increase by 1.3% this year,
partly due to higher public sector wages, and to
grow broadly at this rate over the forecast period.

Member States, Italy

balance is expected to deteriorate to -3% of GDP.

Government deficit expected to increase

After stabilising at 2.4% of GDP in 2017 due to
extraordinary costs to support the banking sector,
the government deficit is set to decline to 1.9% of
GDP in 2018. Public wages were slightly raised,
and the reduction of corporate tax rates introduced
in 2017 had a delayed negative impact on
revenues. Social security contributions benefitted
from the end of the temporary reduction for newly
hired employees. The structural balance is
projected to remain around -1¾% of GDP.
In 2019, the government deficit is expected to
increase to 2.9% of GDP due to the planned
measures. Public spending will significantly
increase following the introduction of a minimum
income scheme, higher flexibility for early
retirement and increased funds for public
investment. Partial financing is provided by a
spending review and several changes in the tax
regime, especially for firms, which will
temporarily support revenues. The previously
budgeted simplified tax regime for small firms
(IRI) and the tax incentives for firms’ capital
uplifts (ACE) will be replaced by the extension of
a simplified tax regime for the self-employed and a
reduction of corporate tax rates for firms
increasing investment or hiring. The structural

In 2020, the government deficit is projected to
reach 3.1% of GDP. This forecast does not
consider the increase in VAT rates legislated as a
safeguard clause, given past systematic repeals.
The delayed impact of the tax cuts planned for
2019 and higher funds for public investment are
expected to be only partially offset by strengthened
provisions for electronic invoicing and temporary
revenues from a new tax amnesty. The structural
balance is projected to further deteriorate to -3½%
of GDP.
Risks to the deficit projections include higher risk
premia on sovereign yields, lower-than-expected
savings from the spending review and higher
spending due to the possible renewal of public
wage contracts. Conversely, the possible activation
of the safeguard clause in 2020 and potential
underspending related to the new measures
represent upward risks to the fiscal projections.
Due to the fiscal deterioration, coupled with
downside risks to nominal growth, Italy’s large
debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to remain stable at
around 131% over the forecast period.

13. CYPRUS
Strong growth momentum continues
Economic activity is forecast to remain strong, driven by domestic demand. Unemployment is expected
to continue its rapid decline, while headline inflation is projected to pick up only moderately. Robust
economic growth is expected to support sustained budget surpluses and a decline in public debt from
2019 onwards, although the banking support measures in 2018 shifted public debt upwards and are
likely to have deficit-increasing effects.
Strong growth set to continue

Economic growth in Cyprus remained strong in the
first half of 2018, backed by solid private
consumption, investment and exports, with real
GDP growing by 4%. The recent revisions to GDP
data paint a more pronounced V-shaped picture of
Cyprus’ economic recovery since the crisis. For
2016, real GDP has been revised up by 1.4 pps., to
4.8%; and for 2017 by 0.3 pps. up to 4.2%. Going
forward, growth is expected to remain fairly strong
and above potential, albeit decelerating from 3.9%
in 2018 to 2.9% in 2020.
Growth is expected to become more domestic
demand-driven. Private consumption accelerated
in the first half of the year and is expected to
remain fairly strong, as unemployment keeps
rapidly declining, wages gradually increase and
inflation remains low, further supporting real
incomes. Private investment is set to remain
buoyant, reflecting the upbeat business sentiment
and the many large scale projects already in the
construction phase. Public consumption and
investment are also in the recovery mode.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Exports are expected to continue performing
strongly in 2018, due to the sizable ship deregistration in the first quarter of the year (which
statistically had the effect of increasing goods

110

exports), but to weaken thereafter. The underlying
gradual softening stems from the tourism sector,
which has been a driving force behind service
sector exports in recent years. It is now confronted
with increasing competition from neighbouring
countries, where safety concerns are abating, and
the lower purchasing power of some tourists
(predominantly British and Russian) as a result of
currency depreciations. Meanwhile imports, due to
their significant content in final demand, are
projected to outweigh exports, thus leading to an
overall negative contribution of net exports to real
GDP growth, and to a further widening of the
current account deficit.
With robust employment creation

Positive labour market dynamics, with a rapid
employment expansion since 2016, have
continued, bringing the unemployment rate down
to 8.1% by mid-2018, the lowest level in eight
years. The strong expansion of the economy, and
in particular the construction sector, provided
employment opportunities also for the most
vulnerable groups – young and long-term
unemployed – reducing their unemployment rates
to 19% and 2.5%, respectively. Employment
expectations in key sectors are positive, signalling
a bright outlook in the short term. Wage growth
has remained contained, but recent increases in
public wages and diminishing slack in the
economy are expected to encourage wage rises in
the private sector as well.
Amid subdued inflation

Headline annual HICP inflation is forecast to
remain low, at 0.8% in 2018. During the first three
quarters of the year, non-energy industrial goods
experienced a period of declining prices amid
increasing competition, while higher oil prices
were transmitted into energy prices with a lag.
Going forward, inflation is expected to pick up
moderately as the tighter labour market translates
into higher wages.

Member States, Cyprus

The budget balance is set to remain in surplus,
excluding the impact of the banking support
measures in 2018, yet to be determined

The government’s fiscal performance remains
remarkably strong, with the primary surplus being
among the highest in the euro area. The budget
surplus is expected to increase and remain high
over the forecast horizon, although the projection
for 2018 does not yet include the potential
deficit-increasing impact of banking support
measures related to the Cyprus Cooperative Bank
(CCB), which is subject to a decision by the
statistical authorities.
The general government surplus is forecast to
improve to 2.8% of GDP in 2018. Buoyant tax
revenue growth underpinned by strong underlying
economic growth will outpace government
expenditure growth. In particular, taxes on
products are projected to benefit from strong
consumption, while income taxes and social
contributions are expected to be supported by
improving labour market conditions. Expenditure
is projected to increase somewhat at a slower pace
than revenues, mainly due to public sector pay
rises and social transfers.

In 2019, the headline surplus is forecast to slightly
increase to 3.0% of GDP, mainly due to a rise in
social security contributions and despite the public
wage growth and the introduction of the Estia
scheme (i.e. State support for loan repayment of
eligible borrowers with NPLs backed by primary
residences). In 2020, under a no-policy change
scenario, the headline surplus is projected to
somewhat decline in line with the projected growth
moderation. The structural surplus is forecast to
increase to 1.7% of GDP in 2018 and to narrow in
2019 and 2020 as the positive output gap widens.
Risks to the fiscal outlook are tilted to the
downside, linked to the uncertainties on the
potential 2018 deficit-increasing impact and
contingent liabilities from the banking sector, the
possible introduction of new taxation reforms in
2019 and the potential additional costs of the
national health system reform.
Public debt to resume its declining path

Public debt is expected to register an upward levelshift by around 9 pps. of GDP in 2018 to 105.0%,
due to banking support measures related to the
CCB. However, public debt is projected to steadily
decline thereafter, reflecting the projected primary
surplus and strong real GDP growth.

14. LATVIA
Balanced growth ahead
Economic growth in Latvia was stronger than expected in the first half of the year, but is set to cool in
the second half and thereafter as investment growth slows. Inflation is set to remain elevated at around
3%, driven by energy prices. The labour market is expected to tighten further, as the labour force
continues to shrink and employment rises. The government deficit is expected to increase to 1.0% of
GDP in 2019, before declining in 2020.
2018 growth better than expected

Latvia’s GDP grew by a stronger-than-expected
rate of 4.6% (y-o-y) in the first half of the year,
boosted by investment, which has grown at
double-digit rates (y-o-y) for five consecutive
quarters. Private consumption growth also
improved compared with last year. Exports held up
better than projected given the expected decline in
financial services and transit services. In the
second half of 2018, however, economic growth is
expected to slow, as investment growth appears to
have peaked and the impact from the winding
down of the non-resident banking sector are
expected to finally pass through to the economy.
As a result, GDP growth in Latvia is expected to
reach 4.1% in 2018.

Slower but more balanced growth forecast in
2019 and 2020

Latvia's growth momentum is expected to continue
over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slower pace,
with GDP growth projected at about 3% in both
2019 and 2020. Solid wage growth and continued
consumer optimism are set to drive private
consumption growth. Following the remarkable
surge in 2017 and 2018, investment growth is
forecast to slow down considerably but remain
positive, as pent-up demand for office space and

112

housing is forecast to drive construction
investment over the coming years. Limited fiscal
space is expected to weigh somewhat on public
consumption growth in 2019. Weakening external
demand is set to slow overall export growth over
the projection horizon. In addition, the structural
decline in financial and transit services are
expected to further dent the outlook for export
growth, slowing down the underlying positive
growth momentum. The current account is set to
remain balanced, as historically high and
increasing savings easily cover current investment
needs.
Investment growth supports employment

Employment is set to increase, thanks in particular
to rapid growth in construction investment. The
strong demand for labour in the economy has
attracted previously inactive people into the labour
force and led to a softening of the ageing-driven
decline in labour supply. The unemployment rate
is set to decline further. The tight labour market
should continue to support wage growth over the
coming years, although it is somewhat mitigated
by slower demand growth and a stable minimum
wage.
HICP inflation is set to hover just below 3% in
both 2018 and 2019, driven mainly by energy and
service prices, before moderating in 2020 as the
pressure from energy prices fades out.
The risks to the forecast are balanced. On
the positive side, credit growth recovery and
increased labour supply could help sustain the
investment boom beyond 2018 and therefore
reinforce consumption and export growth. On the
negative side, adverse developments in the
external environment could dampen domestic
optimism and undermine overall economic growth.
Fiscal deficit set to increase in 2019

The government deficit is forecast at 0.8% of GDP
in 2018, better than expected in the spring.

Member States, Latvia

Corporate income tax revenue exceeded
expectations in the first half of the year, while
revenues from the personal income taxes
underperformed and VAT receipts were broadly in
line with consumption growth. (70) Dividends
received by the government also surprised on
the upside. The government’s capital spending is
expected to be stronger than planned earlier while
spending on goods, services and interest
expenditure are set be somewhat below
expectations.

Under a no-policy-change assumption, the
government deficit is projected to decrease to 0.7%
of GDP in 2020. This is linked to an expected
resumption of tax revenue growth in line with
economic developments, as the effect of the
adopted tax-cutting measures is estimated to be
lower than in 2018-2019. Public expenditure
growth is expected to remain strong, particularly
for social spending and public sector wages.
Latvia’s structural deficit is forecast to decrease
from 1¾% of GDP in 2018 to 1¼% by 2020.

For 2019, the government deficit is projected at
1.0% of GDP. This includes the effect of
previously adopted tax reform measures as well as
the pension expenditure increases adopted in
summer of 2018. Social payments and public
sector wages are expected to be the main drivers of
the expenditure growth, while public investment
expenditure is set to stabilise after a surge in the
last two years.

Government debt, which was an estimated at 40%
of GDP in 2017, should decline to 36% of GDP by
2020, as nominal GDP growth outpaces
the government’s net borrowing. In 2018-2019,
a reduction in the cash reserves should lower
the gross debt ratio, but increase it in 2020 ahead
of a large debt redemption in early 2021.

(70)

For the time being, the forecast includes revenue collected
under the VAT reverse charge mechanism for domestic
supplies of consumer electronics and electrical household
appliances (0.1% of GDP). However, the European
Commission has objections concerning this measure
because it violates EU VAT rules. Without prejudice to the
final decision on this measure, it is assumed as part of the
forecast as a technical assumption.

15. LITHUANIA
Domestic demand to drive GDP growth
Consumption and investment were strong in the first half of the year and are expected to continue
supporting GDP growth over the forecast horizon. After peaking in 2017, inflation is expected to slow,
as upward pressures from indirect taxes dissipate. The labour market is tightening and will continue to
put pressure on wages. Lithuania is expected to maintain a general government surplus over the
forecast horizon and a debt level well below 60% of GDP.
Growth momentum maintained

Domestic factors expected to support growth

The strong momentum which propelled GDP
growth in Lithuania to 4.1% in 2017 continued in
the first half of 2018. The main drivers were
private consumption and a robust increase in
investment that was also supported by greater use
of EU funding. Export growth slowed down to
average levels due to a strong base effect (in 2017,
exports grew by 13.6%, the highest in the EU) and
weakening foreign demand. Contrary to 2017, reexports, mainly to non-EU partners, almost came
to a halt.

In 2019 and 2020, economic growth is expected to
moderate to 2.8% and 2.5% respectively, driven by
private consumption and, to a lesser extent, by
investment. While wage growth is set to be
somewhat slower than in 2018, private
consumption should get an additional boost from
the tax and social security reforms that were
adopted this summer. At the same time, investment
growth is expected to remain buoyant, boosted by
a greater use of EU funds and spurred by capacity
constraints in the context of increasing labour
shortages.

Dom. demand, excl. inv.
Inventories

Private consumption remains supported by high
employment and rising real wages, which
increases disposable income. After gaining
momentum in 2017, investment continues to
flourish, with productive investments, like
machinery and intellectual property, growing at a
faster pace than non-productive investments. From
the beginning of 2018, inflation started slowing as
the effect of last year's excise duty hikes and a
one-off increase in air passenger transport prices in
2017 waned. Overall, the economy should remain
strong in 2018 and grow at a rate of 3.4%.

After an exceptional trade performance in 2017,
both imports and exports are expected to grow
more slowly over the forecast horizon due to base
effects and cooling economic activity in important
trading partners. Domestic demand for capital
goods as well as strong private consumption are
expected to continue driving import growth.
Service exports, especially in transport, ICT and
manufacturing services are set to remain an
important determinant of export growth resulting
in a trade surplus in services. However, as this is
unlikely to offset the trade deficit in goods, the
overall net export contribution to GDP growth is
expected to be slightly negative in the coming
years.
Persistent tightness in the labour market

In the first half of 2018, the unemployment rate
fell to 6.6%, which is approximately 1 pp. lower
compared to the same period in 2017. The record
high employment rate signals a shrinking labour
force and strong labour demand. Due to increases
in minimum wages and labour shortages, salaries
grew by approximately 10% in the first six months
of this year.
On the labour supply side, contrary to previous
years, preliminary data points to an improving
migration balance. However, more immigrants and

114

Member States, Lithuania

the increasing temporary employment of workers
from neighbouring non-EU countries cannot fully
offset labour shortages. As labour demand is
expected to remain strong, the unemployment rate
is set to decline to 6.3% by 2019. Tightness in the
labour market is also expected to continue exerting
upward pressure on wages over the forecast
horizon.
Inflation slowing down

After peaking at 3.7% in 2017, HICP inflation is
expected to drop to 2.6% in 2018, 2.2% in 2019
and 2.1% in 2020. A significant slowdown in the
inflation rate in 2018 reflects the fading away of
excise duties hikes and other one-off effects. These
factors are expected to offset the upward pressures
stemming from higher oil prices and strong wage
growth in 2018. In 2019 and 2020, inflation is
forecast to further moderate in line with the
expected stabilisation of oil prices.
Fiscal loosening ahead

Tax collection, helped by tax-rich economic
growth and contained government spending,

enabled Lithuania to achieve a general government
surplus in 2016 and 2017. As these developments
continue in 2018, the general government balance
is expected to stand at 0.6% of GDP in 2018.
However, the surplus is expected to narrow over
the forecast horizon with the implementation of the
reform package adopted in 2018. Adjustments to
the tax and social security systems are set to result
in lower tax revenues and increased spending.
Subsequently, the general government balance is
expected to stand at 0.4% in 2019 and fall to 0.1%
of GDP in 2020.
The structural deficit is expected to fall from ¾%
in 2018 to ½% of GDP in 2020, due to a
decreasing output gap.
Following the downward trend since 2015,
Lithuania's debt-to-GDP ratio is set to decline
further in 2018. It should reach 34.8% thanks to a
bond redemption at the beginning of the year. As
the government will have to secure the
pre-financing of 2020 bond redemptions in 2019,
the general government debt is set to increase to
37.9% of GDP in 2019 before settling to 37.6%
in 2020.

Growth momentum begins to fade
GDP growth in Luxembourg is forecast to rise to an annual average rate of 3.1% in 2018. The economy
is largely driven by domestic demand, which is benefiting from improving labour market conditions. But
growth is set to moderate in 2019 and 2020 as domestic demand wanes. Inflation is set to average 2.0%
in 2018 and 2019 before cooling to 1.8% in 2020. The headline budget surplus is forecast to remain
high.
Growth regained momentum in 2018…

After slowing to 1.5% in 2017, economic growth
in Luxembourg is showing regained momentum.
GDP growth is forecast to average 3.1% in 2018,
driven mainly by private consumption and
investment, with less support expected from the
external environment. However, historical figures
need to be taken with caution given the frequent
and substantial revisions to Luxembourg's national
accounts data.

first half of 2018, compared to 3.4% in 2017 and
unemployment continued to fall. Private
consumption should benefit from the improvement
in the labour market, including stronger resident
employment creation, while disposable income is
set to receive a boost from taxation reforms and a
new wage indexation applied from August. Private
investment should receive support from continuing
corporate tax reductions, favourable financing
conditions and high levels of capacity utilisation.
The international financial sector, traditionally
Luxembourg’s main growth engine, was still
profitable, despite subdued growth and recent
developments in global financial markets. Bank
lending dropped in the first quarter of 2018 and net
investment inflows to the funds industry slowed in

116

the second quarter. While growth is set to
continue, the moderation in the external
environment has weakened growth prospects for
financial services, as well as for the economy as a
whole.
…but is expected to lose steam.

Several factors suggest slightly less dynamic
economic growth over the forecast horizon. With
the momentum of foreign trade losing dynamism,
economic growth is set to be supported mainly by
domestic demand. In time, as employment gains
become smaller and the impact of tax reforms fade
away, domestic demand will also lose some of its
lustre. GDP growth is expected to moderate to
3.0% in 2019 and 2.7% in 2020.
As a small open economy with strong trade and
financial links in international markets,
Luxembourg remains exposed to materialising
risks. Heightened trade and political tensions, and
any escalation of the financial turmoil that may
ensue, could result in a less benign outcome for
Luxembourg’s economy. Overall, at the current
juncture, uncertainty has increased and risks
remain tilted to the downside.
Progressive shift of inflation drivers

HICP inflation bounced up to 2.1% in 2017 from
zero in 2016, mainly as a result of oil price
movements. Higher oil prices are expected to
continue feeding into higher headline inflation in
2018 and 2019, although their effect should
gradually ease. Downside factors, such as
subsidies for child and healthcare services
introduced in November 2017, are expected to
reduce inflation at 2.0% in 2018. As these effects
dissipate, domestic price pressures, including from
past wage increases, will reassert their influence
and headline inflation should fall from 2.0% in
2019 to 1.8% in 2020.

Member States, Luxembourg

In 2019, the general government surplus is
expected to decline to 1.2% of GDP. Revenue
growth will remain buoyant, in line with strong
underlying economic growth, although it will be
outpaced by growth in government expenditure

The general government surplus will slightly
decline

The general government surplus is projected to
marginally decline to 1.3% of GDP in 2018,
compared to 1.4% in 2017. Revenues should
remain buoyant underpinned by both direct and
indirect taxes. A moderate increase in corporate
income tax revenues is expected to be
accompanied by a stronger increase in payroll
taxes. In addition, VAT revenues should show
strong growth in line with the expected
acceleration of private consumption.

Based on a no-policy-change assumption, the
general government surplus is projected to decline
further in 2020 as growth slows. The projection
includes the purchase of a military plane, for a cost
estimated at around 0.3% of GDP, the delivery of
which is planned in 2020.
The structural surplus is expected to decline over
the forecast horizon, but remain comfortably in
positive territory.

In 2018, planned increases in government
expenditure growth are expected to outpace
revenue growth. Intermediate consumption is
expected to bounce back after having remained
almost flat over the previous year. Public
investment, which is already high, is expected to
expand further. In addition, the implementation of
a multilingual education plan, a childcare voucher
scheme and a reform of parental leave, are all
projected to add to the increase in expenditure
growth.

Luxembourg’s debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 23%
in 2017. It is expected to decline over the forecast
horizon, even if new debt has to be issued to
finance the deficit of the central government, as
the surplus of the social security sector cannot be
used for this purpose.

17. HUNGARY
The maturing of the cycle brings slower growth and rising inflation
Economic growth is set to slow down after a strong 2018 as the domestic business cycle matures, fiscal
stimulus gradually moderates, and headwinds from the global economy strengthen. Fuel and food prices
have driven inflation up, but underlying inflation is also gathering momentum. After peaking at 2.4% of
GDP in 2018, the budget deficit is set to fall below 2% in 2019.
Economic growth accelerates further in 2018…

Hungary’s broad-based, cyclical upswing is
continuing, supported by pro-cyclical fiscal and
monetary policy. GDP growth accelerated to 4.9%
(y-o-y) in the second quarter of 2018, but survey
indicators suggest slower growth ahead as the
short-term boost from public spending earlier in
the year fades while the manufacturing sector
remains in the doldrums.

…but is forecast to slow in 2019 and 2020.

GDP growth is set to moderate from 4.3% in 2018
to 3.4% in 2019 and to 2.6% in 2020. The key
factor behind the slowdown is the moderation in
investment growth, expected as a result of capacity
constraints in the construction sector. These
bottlenecks are already manifesting themselves in
building costs: the construction price index rose by
9.8% (y-o-y) in August 2018. After increasing by
almost 2 pps. between 2017 and 2019, the public
investment ratio will stabilise in 2020 at a historic
high level. Residential investment is also set to
peak in 2019, before the preferential VAT rate on
new housing expires in January 2020. Corporate
investment continues to benefit from strong
demand and accessible financing. The central bank
extended favourable credit conditions by renewing
its lending programme for small enterprises. In

118

addition, several major FDI-related projects are in
progress in the manufacturing sector.
Household consumption is set to decelerate in
2019 as employment growth moderates and the
impact of past administrative wage increases fades.
The recovery of the housing market has reignited
mortgage lending, which will gradually reduce
households’ net financial savings.
Exports will be partly shielded from the slowdown
of trade partners as large new export capacities
gradually enter into production. However, import
demand is set to outpace exports in 2019, and
Hungary’s terms of trade will worsen as imported
energy prices rise. Consequently, the current
account surplus is set to diminish.
Commodity prices hasten the rise of inflation

Employment growth is projected to slow as
unemployment has already fallen to historically
low levels. Additional labour demand will be
partially met by the mobilisation of existing
reserves, including the reallocation of workers
from the public sector, and the continuing rise of
the participation rate. Real wage growth is forecast
to remain high owing to the tight labour market.
Inflation has risen rapidly since the spring due to
rising fuel and unprocessed food prices, as well as
the depreciation of the forint. HICP inflation
climbed to 3.7% in September, exceeding the
central value of the (3% ±1 pp.) tolerance band of
the Hungarian National Bank. Average annual
inflation is set to increase from 3.0% in 2018 to
3.3% in 2019 on the back of higher commodity
prices and tobacco duty increases. While cost-side
factors should fade in 2020, strong wage and
consumption growth will continue to build the
underlying inflation momentum. As a result, HICP
inflation is forecast to remain at 3.0% in 2020.
Risks to the forecast are balanced. The tight labour
market may sustain rapid real wage growth,
leading to faster consumption growth and higher
inflation. Downside risks are related to the

Member States, Hungary

evolution of international trade due to the strong
integration of Hungary into global value chains.
The fiscal stance is set to tighten after 2018

The general government deficit is forecast to peak
at 2.4% of GDP in 2018, affected by the loss of
previous one-off and temporary receipts. Revenues
have also been reduced by tax measures, including
a 2.5 pps. decrease in the employer social
contribution rate. However, the effect of tax cuts
remains largely dampened due to the fast growth
of major tax bases. While the revenue outlook
improved significantly since the spring, it is set to
be matched by extra spending, mainly on public
wages and investments. Nonetheless, the growth of
government expenditure, excluding increased
spending from EU transfers, is forecast to slow
down notably compared to 2017.
In 2019, the headline deficit is expected to
decrease to 1.9% of GDP. The forecast
incorporates an additional 2 pps. cut in social
contributions as of next July. The remaining
elements of the 2019 tax package are estimated to
be revenue neutral overall. While investment
expenses are forecast to continue expanding,
current expenditure, particularly the public wage

bill and social transfers, are set to increase
moderately relative to GDP growth, driving the
deficit-reduction. In 2020, under a no-policychange assumption, the nominal deficit is
projected to decrease further, to 1.8% of GDP.
The main budgetary risks stem from the rapid
growth of public investments planned over
2018-2019. Capacity constraints may slow the
execution of projects, but also lead to cost
inflation, leaving the overall impact on the deficit
uncertain.
The structural balance is estimated to deteriorate
further in 2018 by about ½ percentage points to
around -3¾% of GDP. After 2018, the impact of
past fiscal expansion is expected to be gradually
reversed and the structural balance should improve
to about -3¼% of GDP in 2019 and -3% in 2020.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is set to decrease only
modestly in 2018, to 72.9% from 73.3%. This
reflects sizeable below-the-line effects mainly due
to the pre-financing needs of EU-funded projects
and the weakening of the exchange rate.
Thereafter, the debt ratio is projected to decline at
accelerated speed, falling below 69% by the end of
2020 thanks to the improving budgetary position
and the high rate of nominal GDP growth.

18. MALTA
Sustained economic growth
Malta’s strong GDP growth is set to continue as domestic demand replaces net exports as the main
engine of economic activity. The internationally oriented services sector continues to underpin the large
current account surplus. Inflation is expected to pick up as wage pressures start gaining pace. The
government balance is projected to moderate but remain in surplus.
Good economic performance in the first half of
2018

Malta’s economic growth is projected to remain
robust. Real GDP rose by 6.7% in 2017, driven by
strong growth in net exports. In the first half of
2018, real GDP growth slowed moderately
compared to 2017. Private consumption growth
accelerated, while net exports declined as a result
of rapid import growth in the second quarter.
Business and consumer confidence indicators
remain high and real GDP growth is expected to
average 5.4% in 2018.

Domestic demand expected to drive growth

Growth is expected to gradually ease over the
forecast horizon to an annual average rate of 4.9%
in 2019 and 4.4% in 2020. Domestic demand is set
to be the main driver of growth, supported by
strong investment growth. Various investment
projects co-financed by EU structural funds have
started and will boost public investment in the
second half of 2018. In 2019, the onset of largescale projects in the health, tourism and real estate
sectors is expected to boost private investment.
Private consumption is set to remain dynamic, on
the back of increasing labour market participation
and disposable income.

120

Export growth is expected to slow down over the
forecast horizon from the high growth rates
registered in recent years, in line with the projected
moderation in global demand, while imports are
expected to rise, driven by investment growth. The
current account balance is set to remain at
historically high levels, underpinned by the large
external surplus of the internationally oriented
services sector.
Strong labour market performance to lift wages
and prices

Employment growth is expected to remain strong,
but to moderate over the forecast horizon as
economic growth eases. Increasing labour supply
has helped to keep wage pressures contained
despite strong employment growth and low
unemployment, which is projected to remain
around 4% in the next two years. As a result of the
tighter labour market, wage pressures are expected
to strengthen and lead to higher growth in
compensation per employee. As a result, growth in
unit labour costs is projected to rise to 1.9% in
2018 and to remain broadly stable over the forecast
horizon.
Following a period of moderate price pressures,
headline inflation began to accelerate in the second
quarter of 2018, partly reflecting an increase in the
weight of accommodation services in the price
index, as well as the rise in international oil prices.
Inflation is set to progressively rise over the
forecast horizon on the back of wage growth, and
should reach around 2% in 2020.
Broadly balanced risks to the outlook

Risks to the macroeconomic outlook appear
broadly balanced. As Malta’s trade-to-GDP ratio
stands at around 250%, further escalations in
global trade tensions would imply particular
downside risks to Malta’s growth projections. On
the upside, domestic demand may exceed growth
expectations, if investment rises faster than
anticipated and employment growth surprises on
the upside, pushing up households’ consumption.

Member States, Malta

Fiscal surplus expected to decline

In 2018, the government surplus is projected to
decrease to 1.3% of GDP, from 3.5% in the
previous year. Tax revenue growth is expected to
be lifted by high nominal GDP, supported by
favourable macroeconomic and labour market
conditions, high corporate profits and consumer
demand. An expected fall in the proceeds from
Malta’s citizenship scheme compared to last year
should contribute to a decrease in the fiscal
surplus. Current expenditure is projected to be
dynamic in almost all components, only partly
mitigated by decreasing interest expenditure.
Public investment net of EU funding is projected
to increase only slightly, while the implementation
of investment projects co-financed by the EU is
expected to accelerate. Capital expenditure will
increase also on the back of a capital transfer to
Air Malta related to the purchase of landing rights
(equivalent to around 0.5% of GDP).
In 2019, after incorporating the expected impact of
the measures introduced with the 2019 budget, the
fiscal surplus is expected to decline marginally to
1.2% of GDP. In line with still robust but
moderating macroeconomic conditions, and
despite the reduction in taxation (worth 0.2% of

GDP), growth in tax revenues is expected to slow
down somehow towards the growth rate in
nominal GDP. Also, the proceeds from the
citizenship scheme are expected to be lower
compared to the previous year. In spite of
increases in social spending related to the budget
measures, current expenditure growth is projected
to weaken and interest expenditure is set to
marginally decrease. Net public investment is
forecast to increase marginally, as the
implementation of investment projects co-financed
by the EU is forecast to remain dynamic, while
other capital expenditure is expected to decrease
following the base effect from the previous year.
In 2020, under a no-policy-change assumption, the
fiscal surplus is expected to further decrease to
0.7% of GDP, on account of slightly lower
proceeds related to the citizenship scheme and
higher public investment.
The structural balance has reached a surplus of
around 3% of GDP in 2017. It is estimated to
decrease but to remain in surplus at slightly below
1% of GDP in the period 2018-2020. The
government debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to
decline further from 50.9% of GDP in 2017 to
42.1% in 2020.

19. THE NETHERLANDS
Household and public spending drive growth as cycle matures
Economic growth in the Netherlands is expected to moderate but remain solid. Unemployment is low
and wages are projected to rise. The structural budget balance is expected to hover around zero over
the forecast horizon, while the debt ratio should continue to fall. The Netherlands’ very high external
trade surplus is expected to only gradually decline.
Continued growth momentum

There was strong growth momentum in the
Netherlands in the first half of the year. GDP
growth rose slightly from 0.6% (q-o-q) in the first
quarter to 0.8% in the second. At the same time
however, leading indicators and a weaker external
environment suggest that the pace of growth is
likely to moderate. GDP growth is forecast to be
above potential in both 2018 and 2019, driven
primarily by domestic demand, but the pace of
expansion is expected to ease from 2.8% to 2.4%.
In 2020, growth is expected to slow to 1.8%, as
supply constraints become more binding.

Labour market developments have been favourable
and consumer confidence has remained elevated
since the start of the year. Together with higher
energy consumption due to weather conditions,
this led to a surprisingly strong increase in private
consumption in the first half of 2018. Increasing
household disposable income, on the back of rising
employment and wages, is set to drive solid but
somewhat lower consumption growth over the
forecast horizon.
The industrial capacity utilisation rate exceeded its
pre-crisis level in the first half of the year and
financing costs remain low. Under these
favourable conditions, investment is forecast to
increase by 5½% in 2018. In line with the slower

122

expected pace of economic expansion and the
decline in business sentiment since the start of the
year, corporate investment growth is expected to
moderate in the coming years. While house prices
are still increasing rapidly, a decline in transactions
and labour shortages in the construction sector are
expected to lead to lower residential investment
growth than in previous years.
Export growth is expected to be below recent
trends but remain solid over the forecast horizon,
in line with demand in main trading partners. In
this phase of the economic cycle, robust domestic
demand growth is causing imports to grow
somewhat faster than exports. This should lead to a
slight decline in the trade balance. The current
account surplus, which peaked at historically high
10.5% of GDP in 2017, is set to gradually decline
but remain high.
Robust
employment
growth
moderate wage developments

alongside

Employment grew rapidly in the first nine months
of 2018. The increased vacancy rates, high
reported labour shortages by employers and the
low unemployment rate of 3.7% in September are
signs of a tight labour market. At the same time,
the labour force expanded markedly in recent
months, suggesting there is still scope for solid
employment growth in the short term. The
unemployment rate is forecast to decline somewhat
to 3.6% in 2019 and remain flat in 2020. Despite
the tight labour market, wage growth has so far
been moderate. Recent wage agreements point to
an increase in contractual wages of just below
2.5%, although wage costs are expected to increase
at a faster rate due to increasing social
contributions. Lower-than-expected wage growth
would be a downside risk for the economic
outlook, as it would hold back private
consumption.
Inflation is increasing

HICP inflation is expected to pick up from 1.3% in
2017 to 1.6% this year. This increase is driven by

Member States, The Netherlands

both higher energy prices in line with the rise in oil
prices and an upward pressure on wages and prices
due to supply constraints, the latter being
particularly visible in service prices. In 2019,
inflation is expected to increase further to 2.5%, as
the increase in the reduced VAT-tariff kicks in at
the start of the year. In 2020, this effect disappears
and energy prices are expected to moderate,
leading to an inflation rate of 1.7%.

two steps, the number of tax brackets will be
reduced from four to two, a base rate of 37% for
all incomes up to EUR 68,600 and a marginal top
rate at 49.5% for all income above this threshold.
This is only partly financed by an increase in
indirect taxes (VAT and energy).
In structural terms, the government deficit is
expected to deteriorate from a surplus of ¾% of
GDP in 2017, to ¼% of GDP in 2018 and to a
deficit of ¼% in 2019, illustrating an expansionary
fiscal policy stance in 2018 and 2019.

Stable headline surpluses ahead

The headline budget balance is set to record a
surplus of 1.1% of GDP in 2018, compared to
1.2% in 2017. For the current year, this is slightly
higher than expected at the start of the current
government's term, as some of the planned
expenditures in the area of defence and
infrastructure
encounter
substantial
implementation lags. The budget balance is
expected to remain in surplus at around 1% of
GDP over the forecast horizon, as strong and taxrich economic growth is combined with an
expansionary fiscal policy stance. Next to
expenditure measures in the field of education,
defence and health care, a lowering of personal
income tax rates is planned for 2019 and 2020. In

The government debt-to-GDP ratio is declining at
a relatively fast pace, on the back of budget
surpluses and nominal GDP growth. In 2019, the
debt level is expected to fall below 50% of GDP.
A further reprivatisation of financial institutions
could lead to faster debt reduction.
Risks to the fiscal outlook come mainly from the
macroeconomic side. A worsening of the
economic climate or lower-than-projected wage
growth could affect income taxes. Lower-thanplanned expenditures may entail upside risks for
the budget deficit in the short run.

20. AUSTRIA
Positive growth dynamics continue
Economic growth in Austria is expected to remain strong in 2018 but to moderate in 2019 and 2020.
Domestic demand is set to remain the main driver of growth, while support from foreign demand is set
to gradually diminish. Robust tax revenue growth is expected to further improve the government
headline balance, leading to a balanced budget in 2019.
Conditions remain positive for growth

Data from the first half of this year suggest that the
strong economic growth momentum experienced
by Austria in 2017 has continued into 2018. GDP
is forecast to grow by 2.7% this year, compared to
2.6% in 2017. Domestic demand remains the main
driver of growth, thanks to a rise in private
consumption due to favourable labour market
developments and increasing wages, as well as
solid investment linked to high capacity utilisation
in the business sector. In addition, after several
years of subdued growth, the construction sector
rebounded in 2017 and has remained firm in the
first half of 2018. Despite less dynamic growth in
international markets, export growth has so far
remained strong and contributed positively to
growth.
Growth to slow down but remain robust

In the second half of the year, however, GDP
growth is expected to moderate somewhat, mainly
due to a less favourable external environment.
Thanks to a strong first half of the year, exports
but also equipment investment in 2018 are
expected to grow at a similar pace as in 2017,
while construction investment is expected to
decrease somewhat. Private consumption is set to
increase to 1.8%.

In 2019 and 2020, GDP is forecast to grow more
moderately at 2.0% and 1.8%, respectively. Strong
increases in disposable income support the outlook
for solid private consumption growth. High
capacity utilisation and business confidence
suggest that equipment investment growth will
remain firm but decrease gradually as the
economic expansion slows. After strong increases
in 2017 and 2018, construction activity is expected
to decelerate but remain at robust levels, as
population growth and rising housing and rental
prices support demand for new housing. The
contribution to growth of net exports is expected to
decrease, in line with the lower growth expected in
Austria’s main trading partners.
Sturdy labour market and steady decline in
unemployment

Strong dynamics in the first half of 2018 indicate
robust figures for annual employment growth and
a considerable decrease in unemployment. These
positive dynamics are set to continue but to
moderate somewhat in 2019 and 2020 along with
the
economic
slowdown.
Overall,
the
unemployment rate is expected to fall to 4.8% in
2018 and to 4.4% in 2020.
HICP inflation increasingly driven by core
prices

In 2018, the increase in oil prices is expected to
keep headline inflation at slightly over 2%. In
2019 and 2020, increasing wages and strong
domestic demand should lead to higher domestic
price pressure, mainly in the service and industrial
goods sector. Overall, rising core inflation is
expected to keep headline inflation at 2.1% in
2019, while a further decrease in energy prices
should see inflation ease down to 2.0% in 2020.
Public finances continue to improve due to the
favourable economic environment

Having improved to 0.8% of GDP in 2017 on the
back of the economic upswing, the government
headline deficit is expected to further narrow to

Member States, Austria

0.3% of GDP in 2018. The improvement is due to
higher-than-expected revenues from personal and
corporate income taxes, which benefit from the
better employment and demand conditions.
Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP
is expected to fall from 49.2% of GDP in 2017 to
48.7% of GDP in 2018, mainly due falling interest
payments, lower unemployment benefits, and the
discontinuation
or
reduction
of
several
expansionary measures adopted in 2017
(employment bonus, investment premiums, etc.).
However, higher-than-expected federal transfers to
compensate for the abolished recourse to assets of
people in inpatient long-term care (Pflegeregress)
should prevent the expenditure ratio from
declining further.

comprehensive reform of personal and corporate
income taxation is planned for that year, there is no
sufficient information so far to estimate the
budgetary impact.

In 2019, the headline balance is expected to turn
from deficit to neutral as tax revenues remain high,
despite the tax relief provided by the new Family
Bonus plus. On the expenditure side, the impact of
previously adopted expansionary measures fades
away. In 2020, the general government balance is
expected to achieve a surplus of 0.1% of GDP,
under a no-policy-change-assumption. While a

favourable development of interest expenditures
and the successful divestment of impaired assets.

21. POLAND
Domestic demand to support growth
Private consumption is set to remain the key growth driver but its dynamics will gradually fade as
employment gains slow and higher inflation weighs on real disposable income. Public investment
activity is projected to remain strong, supported by EU funds, while private investment is set to
strengthen. The headline fiscal balance is forecast to remain broadly stable.
Strong growth expected in 2018…

Economic growth in Poland is expected to reach
4.8% in 2018, on par with growth in 2017. As in
2017, private consumption is projected to be the
main growth driver, fuelled by favourable labour
market developments and strong consumer
confidence. Positive growth contributions are also
forecast from investment, where the utilisation of
EU funds is accelerating and leading to a rise in
public investment.

growth. At the same time, employment gains are
forecast to slow from 1.4% in 2017 to 0.1% in
2020, given the limited pool of economically
inactive and unemployed people with skills sought
in the labour market. The employment rate (among
15-74 year olds) is projected to exceed 56% over
the forecast period, an all-time high. The
unemployment rate is expected to average 3.3% in
2018 and to fall further to 2.8% in 2020.

…but expansion set to slow gradually.

GDP growth is forecast to slow to 3.7% in 2019
and 3.3% in 2020 as private consumption growth
cools due to the negative effect of rising inflation
on real disposable income and the limited room for
further employment gains. Investment growth is
projected to remain strong in both 2019 and 2020
as high capacity utilisation levels, low interest
rates and a favourable demand outlook spur an
increase in private investment following a
prolonged period of weak activity. This is expected
to make up for the slowing, but still positive
dynamics of public investment being supported by
EU funding.
Poland is expected to continue gaining export
shares in its key markets. Consequently, in the
context of slower world trade dynamics, Poland’s
exports are projected to continue rising over the
period 2019-2020, though at a slower pace. This,
coupled with strong domestic demand, in
particular the investment recovery, is set to
translate into higher import demand. As a result,
the contribution of net exports to GDP growth is
expected to turn slightly negative in 2019 and
2020, after what is forecast to be a marginally
positive contribution this year.
Rising wages and record low unemployment

The demand for labour is projected to remain
strong, resulting in some acceleration of wage

Labour market pressures and energy prices to
translate into higher inflation

Inflation has stabilised at low levels since mid2018, as slower food price increases counteracted
the effects of rising energy prices. Inflation is
forecast to remain subdued in the last quarter of
2018, due to base effects, but should gradually
increase in 2019 and 2020. Faster wage growth is
expected to be the main factor behind rising prices,
especially in service sectors. Higher electricity
prices are also expected to contribute to inflation,
both directly through electricity bills paid by
households and indirectly through the prices of
energy-intensive consumer goods. In turn, strong
competition in the markets for consumer goods
and services, the rising importance of e-commerce,
and the assumed path of global oil prices, are
forecast to constrain inflation growth.

Member States, Poland

Balanced risks

The uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook
relates primarily to the external environment and
the extent to which possible disruptions in
international production chains will affect Polish
producers. On the domestic demand side, there is a
chance that investment could rise more than
expected, if projects co-financed by the EU are
rolled out more quickly or if business sentiment
improves. However, there is also a chance that
concerns about the institutional quality of Poland’s
justice system could negatively affect investment
decisions sooner or more severely than assumed.
Stable nominal fiscal deficit

The headline fiscal deficit is forecast to decrease
from 1.4% of GDP in 2017 to 0.9% of GDP in
2018. A strong increase in tax revenue, particularly
from personal and corporate income taxes and
social contributions are set to be the main driver of
growing revenue. This strong performance is
mostly explained by the favourable labour market
developments. The robust macroeconomic
environment and, to a lesser extent, new measures

to improve collection support the outlook for
indirect tax revenue. Public investment is expected
to be the fastest growing expenditure item, driven
by an increasing utilisation of EU funds and the
election calendar.
In 2019 the headline fiscal deficit is expected to
remain stable as a share of GDP. In 2020 – under a
no-policy-change scenario – it is projected to
increase slightly, to 1.0% of GDP. Tax revenue as
well as investment and other expenditure items are
expected to see lower dynamics than in 2018. At
the same time, the labour market situation is
expected to remain favourable, which should
support strong growth in social contributions.
The structural deficit is forecast to reach 2% of
potential GDP in 2018 and 2019 before declining
to around 1¾% of potential GDP in 2020.
General government debt is set to continue its
descending path, falling from over 50% of GDP in
2017 to around 47% of GDP in 2020, supported by
relatively low deficits and strong nominal GDP
growth.

22. PORTUGAL
Slower growth in the face of external challenges
Domestic demand remains strong but GDP growth in Portugal is expected to slow down in 2019 and
2020 as net exports weaken. Job creation is also set to weaken amid some improvement in labour
productivity. The general government deficit is expected to remain below 1% over the forecast horizon
while the structural balance, following some improvement in 2018, is forecast to remain broadly stable
thereafter. The gross public debt-to-GDP ratio is set to continue decreasing to around 117% by 2020.
Economic growth to ease in coming years

Real GDP in Portugal rose by 2.3% (y-o-y) over
the first half of 2018, mainly driven by strong
domestic demand and in line with the summer
interim forecast. The Commission’s Economic
Sentiment Indicator eased further in the third
quarter but still remains above its long-term
average. Industrial production and foreign trade
confirmed the soft patch, while retail trade
remained robust. GDP growth is forecast to
moderate somewhat in the second half of the year
mainly because of the slowdown in external
demand. Overall, GDP is now forecast to grow by
2.2% this year, down from 2.8% in 2017.

The moderation in job creation points to some
slowdown in household demand, which would be
only partly offset by the expected increase in wage
growth. Private consumption growth is therefore
forecast to weaken slightly in 2019 and 2020. The
household saving rate, which deteriorated in
2018-Q2 amid further improvements in the
financial situation of households and still very low
interest rates, is expected to remain stable.
Investment is set to rebound in 2019, as the
implementation of certain projects supported by
EU structural funds scheduled for 2018 were
postponed. Net external trade is expected to
continue to weigh on growth, reflecting weaker

128

export demand and strong import growth in line
with final demand. GDP growth is forecast to slow
to 1.8% in 2019 and to 1.7% in 2020. Risks to the
forecast appear broadly balanced as the uncertainty
in external markets could be compensated by a
more positive performance in domestic demand.
External balance worsens

The external balance has deteriorated somewhat
since the start of the year, influenced by
weaker-than-expected exports of goods and a
slowdown in tourism. Oil prices have also
adversely affected terms of trade and thus the
nominal trade balance. Imports are set to continue
outperforming exports, resulting in some
deterioration in the current account balance. Larger
dividend payments to foreign shareholders put
additional pressure on the current account while
the projected increase in absorption of EU
structural funds and lower interest costs for
domestic borrowers are having a positive impact.
Employment growth moderates

Employment growth moderated somewhat in the
summer months of 2018 and monthly
unemployment stabilised at rates close to the euro
area average. Employment growth is projected to
moderate further, reflecting increasing signs of
supply constraints in some market segments and
the maturing economic cycle. Accordingly, the
average annual rate of unemployment is set to
decrease at a slower pace to 6.3% in 2019 and
5.9% in 2020. This is set to spur labour
productivity while wages are projected to
gradually accelerate, supported by the unfreezing
of career progressions in the public sector and a
reduction in labour market slack.
Inflation remains low

Despite the increase in energy prices, the annual
rate of inflation is forecast to remain relatively low
at 1.5% in 2018 before creeping up to 1.6% in
2019 and 2020. Apart from the impact of energy

Member States, Portugal

markets, inflation experienced significant volatility
in 2018 driven by accommodation prices, due to
calendar effects as well as methodological changes
affecting the time horizon of hotel bookings. Core
inflation remained below the overall average in
2018 but the situation is expected to gradually
reverse over the forecast period, as service prices
are expected to pick up in line with more dynamic
wage developments. House prices meanwhile rose
by 11.2% (y-o-y) in the second quarter of 2018 but
are set to slow down over the forecast horizon due
to moderate supply growth.
Public finances benefitting from domestic
demand and lower interest expenditure

The general government headline deficit is
projected to decrease to 0.7% of GDP in 2018,
helped by higher cyclical-related revenue,
decreasing
interest
expenditure
and
lower-than-budgeted public investment but
negatively impacted by the activation of the Novo
Banco contingent capital mechanism (0.4% of
GDP). Excluding this and other one-off operations,
the deficit net of one-offs is set to improve to 0.3%

of GDP. The structural balance is projected to
improve by about ¼ pps. of GDP. The headline
deficit is set to decrease to 0.6% of GDP in 2019
while the deficit net of one-offs is set to improve to
0.2% of GDP. As the impact of discretionary
measures, savings in interest expenditure and
higher property income is expected to be broadly
neutral in 2019, the structural balance is projected
to remain broadly stable. Under a no-policychange assumption, the headline deficit is set to
improve to 0.2% of GDP in 2020 while the
structural balance is set to remain broadly
unchanged. The structural primary balance is
forecast to worsen by about ¼ pps. of GDP over
the forecast horizon. Risks to the fiscal outlook are
tilted to the downside, linked to uncertainties
surrounding the macroeconomic outlook and the
potential further deficit-increasing impact of
banking support measures.
After falling by 4.5 pps. to 124.8% in 2017, the
gross public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to
further decline to 121.5% in 2018, 119.2% in 2019
and 116.8% in 2020, mainly due to primary budget
surpluses and high nominal GDP growth.

23. ROMANIA
Strong growth set to decelerate
Romania’s economic boom is cooling down as private consumption growth slows and the negative
contribution of net exports to growth worsens further. GDP is forecast to grow more moderately over
the forecast period and the labour market looks set to remain tight. Inflation peaked in spring 2018 and
is expected to progressively slow down. The budget deficit is forecast to continue increasing, mostly due
to significant increases in public wages and pensions.
Growth is set to slow but remain robust

Romania’s economic boom has started to cool
down in 2018. Real GDP growth slowed from
4.3% to 4.2% between the first and second quarters
of the year and is expected to slow further. For the
year overall, real GDP growth is forecast at 3.6%.
Private consumption, the main contributor to
growth, appears clearly to be weakening. This
stems from persistently high inflation, mainly due
to energy prices, and the fading out of public
policies directed at increasing disposable income.
Investment is expected to remain subdued for the
rest of 2018. Import growth remains dynamic,
despite softening private consumption, while
exports are slowing, rendering net exports a drag
on real GDP growth.

In 2019 and 2020, private consumption is forecast
to slow down further as nominal wage growth
moderates and inflation continues to weigh on real
disposable income. It will nonetheless remain the
main driver of growth. Investment is expected to
increase its contribution to growth on the back of
an increase in non-residential construction.
Overall, real GDP growth is projected to amount to
3.8% in 2019 and 3.6% in 2020. The output gap,

130

which turned positive in 2017, is expected to
narrow over the forecast horizon.
Imports are projected to continue rising at a higher
pace than exports in 2019 and 2020. Accordingly,
net exports will again make a negative contribution
to real GDP growth. The current account deficit is
set to continue increasing steadily as the trade
balance widens from 3.7% in 2018 to 4.5% in
2020.
The labour market continues to tighten

Unemployment in Romania fell to a new historical
low of 4.3% in spring 2018 and is set to stay at a
broadly similar level over the forecast horizon. The
tight labour market conditions suggest that wages
should continue to grow, with some expected
spillovers from the public to the private sector, but
the pace will likely slow. This should reduce
pressure on unit labour costs, which are
nonetheless forecast to rise moderately in 2019 and
2020. Real wage growth, however, is expected to
moderate significantly in 2018, due to higher
inflation.
Inflation is set to rise

Headline inflation continued to grow at a strong
pace in spring 2018 as the effect of a cut to
standard VAT rates and excise duties on fuel,
made in January 2017, faded away. The decision to
reverse those cuts in October 2017, added further
fuel to the figures. For 2018 as a whole, inflation is
forecast at 4.3%, while in 2019 and 2020 it is
expected to fall to 3.5% and 3.3% respectively on
account of weakening domestic demand.
Risks tilted to the downside

A main risk to the forecast is that wage growth
could continue to outpace productivity growth,
causing Romania’s economic competitiveness to
decline further and weaken export growth.
Furthermore, volatile food prices and persistently
high international commodity prices could cause

Member States, Romania

the current account deficit to widen even further.
Uncertainty regarding the government’s policies,
with potential negative repercussions on the
business environment, and the challenge of
budgetary deficit targets could hamper investment
decisions. On the other hand, an improved
absorption of EU funds represents a positive risk
for GDP growth in 2019 and 2020.
Public deficit set to increase

In 2018, the general government deficit is
projected to increase to 3.3% of GDP, from 2.9%
in 2017. Gross wages in the public sector were
raised by 25% with even higher increases in the
health and education sectors. The fiscal cost of
these increases to gross wages was partially
compensated for by a shift in the burden of social
security contributions from employers to
employees (from 22.75% and 16.5% to 2.25% and
35% respectively). The flat personal income tax
(PIT) rate was cut from 16% to 10%. Moreover,
public investment is projected to rebound slightly
from a record low in 2017.
The general government deficit is projected to
increase to 3.4% of GDP in 2019 and 4.7% in
2020. This projection is mostly driven by plans to

significantly increase the pension point (the main
parameter used for pension indexation), included
in the governing programme and implemented
through the pension law recently adopted by the
government. The pension point is set to increase
by 15% in September 2019 and 40% in September
2020.
As a consequence of these policy developments,
Romania’s structural deficit is projected to
increase from around 3½ % of GDP in 2017 to
around 4½ % in 2020. The debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to increase from 35.1% of GDP in 2017
to 38.2% in 2020.
A positive risk to the 2018 budget balance forecast
comes from possibly lower than budgeted public
investment. A possible freeze in public wages and
potential changes to the draft pension law
represent a positive risk for 2019 and beyond. On
the other hand, a potential rebound of public
investment from its record-low levels represents a
negative risk to the general government balance
projection in 2019 and 2020 via increased
expenditure.

24. SLOVENIA
Solid growth over the forecast horizon
Economic growth reached 4.9% in 2017 and has remained strong also in the first half of 2018.
Investment and exports have increased, while private consumption growth has been somewhat weaker.
Growth is projected to continue at slightly lower pace in 2019 and 2020. Under a no-policy-change
scenario, the public finances are expected to remain in surplus but to worsen in structural terms.
Fast growth continued over the first half of 2018

In the first half of 2018, Slovenia’s economy grew
by 4.6% compared to the first half of 2017 (1.9%
compared to the previous six months). Domestic
demand expanded thanks to investment, while
private consumption grew somewhat more slowly
despite relatively strong growth in households'
disposable income. Investment growth was
particularly strong in non-residential construction
(14%) but also investment in machinery and
equipment grew by 7.2% in the first half of the
year compared to the first half of 2017. Residential
construction investment increased by 5.4%.
Exports grew by 9.9%, slightly below import
growth, which stood at 10.2%. While remaining at
a high level, economic sentiment indicators point
to some weakening in the growth momentum over
the second half of this year. Taking into account
some expected slowdown in Slovenia’s main
export markets, economic growth in the second
half of the year is forecast to lose some momentum
compared to the beginning of the year. All in all,
real GDP growth is forecast to reach 4.3% in 2018,
below the 4.7% growth that was forecast in spring.

Growth to remain robust in 2019 and 2020

Economic growth is forecast to slow down to 3.3%
in 2019 and to 3.0% in 2020. Growth composition
is expected to shift more towards domestic

132

demand, with a negative contribution from net
exports expected by 2020. Private consumption is
projected to continue to enjoy the support of
growing employment and rising wages. Investment
is expected to be driven by high capacity
utilisation rates and a tightening labour market. It
is forecast to weaken somewhat in 2019 in the
private sector but to pick up in the public sector,
supported by an increased use of EU funds. In a
context of high income growth, elevated household
saving and rapidly increasing residential real estate
prices, residential investment growth is forecast to
remain strong over the forecast horizon.
Growth of unit labour costs is expected to pick up
between 2018 and 2020. Together with lower
export demand, this is set to contribute to
somewhat slower export growth. Nevertheless,
Slovenia’s export market shares are expected to
continue improving in 2019 and to remain stable in
2020. Imports are forecast to grow faster than
exports due to the strengthening domestic demand.
Slovenia’s current account surplus is projected to
reach 7.5% of GDP in 2018 and slowly decline to
6.7% by 2020.
Negative risks to the growth outlook are mainly
external in nature. Were export demand to fall
faster than expected, that would weigh on both
exports and business investment, compounding its
negative impact on economic sentiment. On the
upside, households have room to increase
consumption, particularly in light of improving
credit conditions and a relatively high saving rate.
Labour market tightens

In 2018, employment is set to grow by 3.0% and
the unemployment rate to decrease from 6.6% in
2017 to 5.6%. The unemployment rate is expected
to fall further, reaching 5.1% in 2020. An inflow of
foreign workers and a rising participation rate
should help to alleviate labour supply constraints
to some extent but wage pressures are nevertheless
expected to increase. Compensation per employee
is forecast to continue growing well above 3%
over the forecast horizon.

Member States, Slovenia

Inflation is expected to reach 2.0% in 2018 and to
increase to 2.3% in 2019. Inflation is driven by
energy prices and the expected wage growth. Core
inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2018
but should reach 1.8% in 2020.
Structural budget balance deteriorates

In 2017, the general government surplus stood at
0.1% of GDP, mainly due to high revenues and a
strong decline in interest expenditure driven by
active public debt management and favourable
financial market conditions.
In 2018, the general government surplus is
expected to improve to 0.5% of GDP. The
revenues from taxes and social contributions are
projected to accelerate further in line with the
strong labour market performance. Compensation
of employees and social transfers are expected to
drive growth in government expenditure due to the
ending of previously taken temporary restrictive
measures.
In 2019, under a no-policy-change budget, the
surplus is forecast to slightly decrease to 0.4% of
GDP. Although revenues are projected to rise
strongly, both compensation of employees and

social benefits are projected to increase as a result
of negotiations with labour unions and further
relaxation of temporary measures. Under a nopolicy-change assumption, the general government
surplus is expected to recede to 0.2% of GDP in
2020. Along with a higher absorption of EU funds,
the growth of government expenditure is forecast
to outpace the revenue growth.
The main downside risks to public finances over
the forecast horizon stem from considerable
expenditure pressures, particularly on wages and
social benefits. The implementation of measures
announced in the coalition agreement of the new
government could potentially lead to further fiscal
expansion.
Slovenia’s structural deficit is forecast to worsen
by about ½ percentage points of GDP in 2018. As
the projected output gap is positive, a deteriorating
structural deficit would imply a pro-cyclical fiscal
policy.
The debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at 82.6% in 2015,
but decreased to 74.1% of GDP in 2017. Supported
by economic growth and active public debt
management, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
decline steadily to 62.6% of GDP in 2020.

25. SLOVAKIA
Growth strengthens thanks to investment and exports
Slovakia’s economic expansion is expected to strengthen. Private consumption should continue to drive
overall growth, backed by solid real wage increases and further employment gains. Exports are
expected to replace investment as the second pillar of growth in 2019. The economic expansion is likely
to ease in 2020 as export growth slows. Consumer price inflation is expected to be fuelled by buoyant
wage increases and robust private demand. The government deficit is projected to decrease further.
Growth nears its peak

Slovakia’s economy expanded by 3.2% in 2017,
driven principally by domestic demand. Real GDP
growth is forecast to reach around 4% in 2018 and
to accelerate slightly further in 2019, when the
current business cycle is likely to peak. Further
improvements in the labour market are likely to
make private consumption a key contributor to
GDP growth over the forecast horizon, as was
already the case in 2017. Expanding export
capacities in the large automotive sector will
significantly boost economic activity from 2019
onwards. At the same time, mounting labour
shortages are leading to an acceleration of wage
growth and pose a risk towards further expansion
in affected sectors.

Wages outpace productivity growth

Employment growth is likely to decelerate over the
forecast horizon as unemployment falls to
historical lows and labour shortages become more
acute in many sectors. While the positive effect
from job creation on disposable income growth is
expected to fade, accelerating wage growth will
take over as a key source of household income
growth. In the context of low unemployment risk
and supportive financial conditions, consumers are
likely to keep spending and invest in the housing
market. At the same time, the tight labour market
is expected to push wage growth above
productivity growth. If sustained, the resulting
growth in unit labour costs risks will likely erode
the economy’s external competitiveness.

Inventories
Dom. demand, excl. inv.

Investment boosts export capacities in the
automotive industry

A surge in investment activity in the first half of
2018 is expected to be followed by muted
investment growth in the second half, which will
nonetheless allow investment growth in 2018 to
reach double-digit rates. This investment spending
is partly directed at the construction of a new car
factory, which is expected to be completed by end2018. In 2020, the approaching end of the current
programming period of EU funding and a number
of large public investment projects are likely to
revive public investment.

134

The positive effect of new investment on
Slovakia’s export capacities and trade performance
is expected to be built over the forecast horizon.
The new car factory will help significantly
accelerate export growth, despite an expected
slowing in foreign demand. This should result in
substantial export market share gains. Ongoing
expansion in domestic supply chains should further
lift the contribution of net trade to GDP growth.

Demand pressures will drive inflation

Although the highpoint in consumer price inflation
is likely to have already been passed in the second
quarter of 2018, HICP inflation is set to remain
somewhat elevated over the forecast horizon.
Service price inflation in particular is expected to
rise over the forecast horizon owing to rapid wage
cost growth. Moreover, higher oil prices should
lead to an increase in regulated energy prices in
2019. Food prices are likely to continue growing at
recent trend rates of around 2.5% - close to the rate
of overall HICP inflation expected for 2020.
Public finances to benefit from growth

The general government deficit declined to 0.8%
of GDP in 2017. The government headline deficit

Member States, Slovakia

is expected to continue declining and should be
close to 0.6% of GDP in 2018, underpinned by the
favourable macroeconomic situation and positive
developments in the labour market. However, the
main part of these gains is expected to be spent as
investment at the local level in the run-up to
municipal elections and
as government
consumption. Revenues from personal income
taxes and social contributions are expected to
expand markedly. At the same time, revenues from
corporate income taxes are increasing thanks to the
growing profitability of companies and a better
corporate tax settlement for 2017. Revenues from
value-added taxes are likely to benefit from
improved tax collection, reflected in a rising
effective tax rate. Public expenditure is expected to
contract by 0.2 pps. of GDP more than revenues.
In 2019, the headline deficit is projected to fall to
0.3% of GDP. In line with robust real GDP growth
and a strong labour market, tax revenues are
expected to continue growing. Expenditure growth
should slow in spite of high indexation of public
wages and the impact of the introduction of
government expenditure measures – including e.g.

free lunches for schoolchildren, Christmas bonuses
for pensioners and financial support for spa cures.
The general government revenue and expenditure
ratios are expected to decrease to 38.9% and
39.3% of GDP, respectively.
In 2020, the headline deficit will be almost
negligible with total expenditure and revenue
levels falling by 0.6 and 0.3 pps. of GDP,
respectively. Buoyant private consumption and
favourable labour market conditions are likely to
ensure steady growth in revenues, particularly
from income taxes, social contributions and VAT.
Marked increases in public wages are also planned
in 2020. Use of EU funding for investments is
expected to increase slightly as the end of the
programming period approaches. The main
downside risk to the fiscal forecast is the possible
spending of windfall government revenues.
The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is
expected to decline to 46.4% of GDP by 2019 and
to 44.2% of GDP in 2020, driven by expected
primary surpluses and robust nominal GDP
growth.

Growth set to moderate
Economic growth is expected to remain strong and broad-based this year, before moderating in 2019
and 2020. Unemployment is forecast to reach close to its structural level while inflation is expected to
accelerate but remain just below 2% in 2020. Economic growth will support improvement in the

Finland's GDP is expected to reach 2.9% in 2018.
Growth in 2018 is expected to be broad based,
driven mainly by private consumption and
investment. After a strong first quarter
(1.2% q-o-q) and a moderation in the second
(0.3% q-o-q), high-frequency indicators suggest
that growth should pick up in the second half of
the year.
Private consumption increased strongly on the
back of rising employment and rising household
disposable income. The strong investment growth
of 2017 continued in 2018, mainly due to the
strength of construction investment. On the back of
increased foreign demand, exports are set to
outpace imports, which remain subdued. These
drivers are expected to contribute to strong GDP
growth in 2018, at similar pace as in 2017, and it
appears likely that growth may be reaching a
cyclical peak.
…set to moderate in 2019 and 2020.

Private consumption is forecast to become the
dominant growth driver over 2019 and 2020,
supported by the rise in household disposable
income, rising employment and high consumer
confidence. The rise in income is forecast to
outpace the rise in spending, which should help the
household saving rate to recover slightly, although
it is expected to remain at an historically low level.

exports and decelerating private consumption. As a
result, the current account surplus is forecast to
continue rising from 0.6% in 2017 to 1.6% of GDP
in 2020.
The labour market continues to improve and
inflation remains moderate

Employment has risen strongly in 2018, with more
than half of new workers coming from inactivity.
This trend is set to continue in 2019 and 2020 but
at a slower pace. As the unemployment rate
reaches close to its structural level, supply-side
constraints are set to emerge. Following the
implementation of the ‘Competitiveness Pact’,
wage growth has been modest in 2018 but is
forecast to pick up moderately in 2019 and 2020,
which should support households’ purchasing
power.
Inflation has remained below the euro area average
but is set to accelerate with higher labour costs and
increases in fuel prices. As a result, headline
inflation is forecast to gradually accelerate to close
to 2% in 2020.

Investment growth is forecast to slow down
compared to 2018. Construction investment in
particular should come down from exceptionally
high levels as demand for residential property
decreases. On the other hand, increased corporate
profits, high capacity utilisation and low interest
rates should all encourage business investment,
particularly in machinery and equipment.

could

Public debt ratio falls below 60%

The favourable economic cycle is helping to
further consolidate Finland’s public finances.
Taxes on production and imports are expected to
increase strongly in 2018, slowing down gradually
in 2019 and 2020 in line with the economy. The
increase in employment and the expected wage
rises will boost revenue from taxes on income in
both 2019 and 2020. Accordingly, lower payments
of unemployment benefits will help contain
government expenditure.
Despite the economic expansion, temporary factors
are expected to have a negative impact on the
government balance in 2018. The end of one-off
revenues from corporate taxes in 2017, the tax
refunds and changes in the system of VAT levies
on imports will lower government revenues.

Furthermore, in the wake of the reforms under the
Competitiveness Pact, taxes on income will also
grow more moderately. On the expenditure side,
the government is expected to continue spending
on large-scale investment projects. Hence, despite
favourable cyclical conditions, the general
government headline balance in 2018 is forecast to
deteriorate to -0.8% of GDP. In 2019, as some of
the investment projects come to an end and owing
to the general fiscal consolidation policy, the
general government finances are projected to
improve to -0.2% of GDP.
Due to the above factors, Finland’s structural
balance is estimated to worsen in 2018 to about
¾% of GDP, before improving to ½% of GDP in
2019.
The decline in Finland’s general government debtto-GDP ratio continues. It is projected to fall
below the 60% benchmark already in 2018.

27. SWEDEN
Moderating growth and strong public finances
Economic growth in Sweden is expected to remain solid this year on the back of strong domestic
demand but is forecast to slow in 2019 as residential investment declines. Unemployment is set to fall in
2018 and stabilise just above 6% in 2019 and 2020. Inflation is forecast to reach the Riksbank’s target
of around 2% in late 2018 before receding to 1.6% in 2020. The general government surplus is
projected to decline to around 1% of GDP while the debt-to-GDP ratio is set to fall further.
Growth to shift down a gear

Real GDP in Sweden is set to grow by a solid
2.4% this year before cooling down to a below
potential rate of 1.8% in 2019 and 2020, as
domestic demand growth wanes and the external
environment provides only limited support.

Slowing domestic demand growth

Domestic demand growth is set to decrease from
2.2% in 2018 to 1.7% in 2020, mainly due to
falling residential investment. Following two
decades of strong growth, house prices declined in
Q4-2017 and have broadly stabilised. As a
consequence, after a strong outcome in the first
quarter of 2018, housing investment fell back in
the second quarter and is expected to decline
further.
In addition, investment in equipment is expected to
lose speed as trade-related uncertainty weighs on
external demand and business sentiment. Overall,
gross fixed capital formation is likely to grow by a
mere 2% in 2019 and 2.1% in 2020, compared to
6.1% in 2017.
Private consumption was strong in the first half of
2018, mainly driven by advanced car purchases
ahead of a tax hike introduced in July. With

138

employment growth set to decline in the next two
years and subdued wage increases, real disposable
income growth is set to slow. Private consumption
is thus projected to expand moderately by around
2.1% in 2020, compared to 2.4% in 2018.
General government consumption is set to increase
by 1.1% in 2018 based on the 2018 budget bill,
before slowing to 0.9% over 2019 and 2020 on a
no-policy-change assumption. Most of the
additional spending in the coming years is
expected to be undertaken by local authorities to
hire staff and improve infrastructure in view of a
growing and ageing population.
Net exports hardly contribute to growth

Goods exports rose by 5% in 2017, driven by
machinery and transport equipment, and growth
remained solid in the first half of 2018. Imports,
however, also rose vigorously, due to the country's
deep integration into global value chains and
Sweden's industry specialisations. As a result, net
exports reduced GDP growth. Sentiment among
Swedish exporters has been dampened by ongoing
trade tensions and expectations of slowing growth
in the US. Exports of goods and services are likely
to expand by only 3.2% in 2019 and by 3% in
2020. Net trade contribution to growth is set to
remain broadly neutral.
Unemployment to stabilise

Economic growth is expected to bring
unemployment down to 6.3% in 2018. Shortages
of skilled labour and skill mismatches are set to
prevent the unemployment rate from falling much
further in 2019 and 2020. Employment is likely to
grow at a more benign rate than in 2017 and in line
with labour force expansion over the forecast
horizon.
Inflation slowing down

Headline inflation is forecast to increase to 2.1% in
2018 and to edge down to 1.9% in 2019. Import

Member States, Sweden

prices are expected to go up in 2018 as a result of
the Swedish krona’s depreciation and the rise in oil
and unprocessed food prices (caused by unusually
dry weather). However, as these temporary factors
are projected to fade away and wage growth is
assumed to remain muted, HICP inflation should
retreat to 1.6% by 2020.
Risks tilted to the downside

As a small open economy, Sweden remains
vulnerable to an escalation in trade disputes. While
the recent decline in house prices seems to have
come to a halt, a renewed fall could reduce further
residential construction activity with repercussions
on consumer confidence, private consumption, and
ultimately growth.

2016, mainly as a result of stronger-than-expected
revenues. As revenues are forecast to revert to
more normal performance, a smaller surplus of
around 1% of GDP is expected in 2018. This
surplus is set to gradually decline to 0.8% of GDP
in 2020, as economic growth is slowing down. The
structural surplus is projected to fall by around half
a percentage point of GDP in 2018 implying a
mildly expansionary fiscal stance that should be
broadly neutral in 2019-2020. This would be above
the adopted new medium-term fiscal surplus target
of 0.33% of GDP with effect from 2019.
Sweden’s general government gross debt is
expected to remain on a declining path, on the
back of economic growth and primary budget
surpluses. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
fall from 40.8% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2020.

Slightly declining surpluses

Sweden’s general government balance had a
surplus of 1.6% of GDP in 2017, up from 1.1% in

28. THE UNITED KINGDOM
Outlook remains subdued as slowdown persists
UK GDP growth is currently subdued and expected to remain so over the forecast horizon. Private
consumption growth is forecast to remain weak as real wages grow modestly and households look to
maintain savings. Heightened uncertainty means that business investment growth is likely to remain
constrained. The net trade contribution to growth is projected to decrease in-line with a moderation in
external demand. Employment growth is expected to slow significantly, leading to a modest rise in
unemployment. Inflation should ease as the impact of sterling’s 2016 depreciation unwinds.
Weather related effects have impacted the
pace of growth in 2018

The pace of UK economic growth this year has
been uneven to date, partly due to weather-related
effects. GDP growth slowed significantly to 0.1%
(q-o-q) in 2018-Q1, down from 0.4% in 2017-Q4.
This slowdown was in part due to severe bad
weather disruption in March. While the pace of
GDP growth in Q2 (0.4%) was in-line with recent
trends, growth in the first part of Q3 was boosted
by strong private consumption (retail sales) due to
warmer than usual summer weather. High
frequency indicators suggest that both GDP and
private consumption growth will ease back
towards the subdued underlying growth rates
recently seen.

Business investment growth was negative in both
2018-Q1 (-0.7%) and 2018-Q2 (-0.5%). Various
business surveys indicate that this subdued
performance is largely due to ongoing uncertainty
over the UK’s future trading relationship with the
EU.
The contribution of net exports to GDP growth has
also reduced in 2018, as the impacts of the 2016
depreciation of sterling faded and external market
growth moderated. Net trade made a negative

Moderate increase in domestic demand to
offset slower external demand in 2019 and
2020

Given the ongoing negotiation over the terms of
the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, projections for
2019 and 2020 are based on a purely technical
assumption of status quo in terms of trading
relations between the EU27 and the UK. This is for
forecasting purposes only and has no bearing on
the talks underway in the context of the Article 50
process.

contribution in Q1 (-0.1 pps.) and Q2 (-0.6 pps.).
The large decrease in goods exports in Q2 was
mainly due to lower car exports. The most recent
official trade data suggests that net trade made a
positive contribution to growth in Q3. GDP growth
over 2018 as a whole is expected to be 1.3%, down
from 1.7% in 2017.

Consumer confidence surveys suggest that savings
intentions of consumers are high, reflecting weak
overall consumer confidence. Private consumption
growth is therefore assumed to remain weak in
2019 as households take the opportunity from
modest real wage growth to maintain savings.
Business investment growth is projected to
rebound slightly in 2019 but to remain relatively
subdued following a prolonged period of
heightened uncertainty. The net trade contribution
to growth is expected to deteriorate further
alongside slowing external demand. Reflecting
these factors and the technical assumption, GDP
growth is expected to remain weak at 1.2% in
2019, marginally lower than in 2018. GDP growth
is expected to be stable at 1.2% in 2020.
As this purely technical assumption implies a
relatively benign scenario, the risks to the 2019
and 2020 baseline forecast are large and
predominantly to the downside.

Member States, The United Kingdom

Employment growth expected
alongside easing inflation

to

slow

Over the forecast horizon employment growth is
expected to slow in a context of subdued GDP
growth. This is projected to lead to a modest rise in
the unemployment rate to 4.7% in 2020. As the
impact of sterling’s earlier depreciation on
consumer prices unwinds fully, inflation is
expected to ease to 2.0% in 2019 and to 1.9% in
2020.
General government deficit to stabilise over
the forecast horizon

For the current fiscal year (2018-2019) to date,
borrowing has been significantly lower than
official projections. This over-performance is due
to both lower spending as well as higher revenues.
Consequently the general government deficit is
now projected to fall to 1.3% of GDP in 2018-19
as a whole. The structural deficit is expected to fall
to around 1¾ % of GDP in 2018-2019.
Since the last Budget in November 2017, there
have been notable public policy spending
announcements, including additional funding for

the National Health Service. In the absence of
compensatory revenue measures, these will have a
significant impact on the deficit over the forecast
horizon. The UK authorities have announced that
the 2018 Budget will be released on 29 October.
Based on the publicly available information at the
cut-off date for this forecast (22 October 2018) and
under our no-policy-change assumption, over the
forecast horizon the general government deficit is
projected to stabilise at 1.2% of GDP in both 20192020 and 2020-2021. The structural deficit is
expected to fall and stabilise close to 1½% in
2019-2020 and in 2020-2021, reflecting slightly
below-trend GDP growth in both years. As
additional spending and/or compensatory revenue
measures may yet be announced in the Budget, the
risks to the forecast seem balanced. The general
government debt ratio is projected to fall from
85.0% of GDP in 2018-2019 to 83.7% of GDP in
2019-2020 and to 82.0% of GDP in 2020-2021.

29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Economic recovery depends on improving investment outlook
Output growth was driven by the strong pickup in exports in the first half of the year, off-setting a drop
in investment. The recovery is expected to gain traction in 2019 and 2020, but at a slower pace than
projected earlier, and to be increasingly driven by strengthening investment and a sizeable fiscal
stimulus. The public debt ratio is set to continue to rise.
Export boom carries the economy in 2018

Price pressures likely to remain mild

The economy picked up in the second quarter,
following stagnation in 2017 and early 2018. In the
first two quarters of the year, real GDP increased
by an average of 1.6%, compared to the same
period one year earlier, mainly carried by net
exports. Export growth accelerated sharply, with
the bulk of the increase coming from established
foreign companies, which account for 53% of total
exports. Import growth slowed, largely reflecting
muted investment, which dropped by 10%.

Consumer prices rose by an average of 1.5% y-o-y
in the first nine months of 2018. The increase in
food prices was halted over the summer, but
energy prices kept on rising, and spilled over in
particular to the transport sector. These dynamics
are likely to continue, lifting up core inflation
somewhat as spill-over effects persist.

Growth drivers set to change

In the next two years, gross fixed capital formation
is expected to provide an increasing contribution to
economic growth. The investment climate is
improving, amidst firming corporate credit and
sizeable public subsidies to companies. The
government is determined to address deficiencies
in the business environment and to clear the path
for EU membership. Transport projects, which
were stalled in the summer, are expected to resume
before end-2018. Companies' liquidity is expected
to benefit from the clearance of government
arrears, the funding of which has been raised
through the October budget rebalancing. Export
growth is projected to remain strong, but
decelerate somewhat after peaking in 2018, due to
emerging capacity constraints in manufacturing.
Import growth is set to increase with the expected
pick-up in investment. Net exports may detract
from growth in 2019 and 2020.
A further boost to disposable income over the
forecast horizon is expected to sustain household
spending. Job creation and wage growth are likely
to continue at a robust pace. Social transfers have
risen by 8% y-o-y in the first eight months of the
year and the government has raised wages for
public health and education workers by 5% as of
September 2018. Furthermore, household credit
growth, at 9.8% y-o-y average in the first eight
months, is likely to remain strong.

144

Labour market sustained by public subsidies

The labour market improved further in the first
half of the year, with employment increasing at a
steady rate, and gains being broader-based. Job
creation will be further supported by the
government's employment subsidies, but slow
down somewhat, in particular in manufacturing
sectors dominated by foreign investors which are
impacted by an acute shortage of skilled labour.
Structural problems continue to impact the
employment situation, in particular the persistently
low participation rate, at some 65%.

Downside risks to forecast prevail

Risks to the baseline scenario are mainly on the
downside. Domestically, they relate to the
possibility of political uncertainty, providing a
renewed dent to investor confidence and
postponing the expected pick-up in investment.

Candidate Countries, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

Fiscal risks may jeopardise consolidation and the
execution of growth-enhancing capital projects. On
the external side, lower than expected external
demand and escalating global trade tensions pose
additional downside risks to the forecast.
Public finances remain on shaky grounds

Supported by a strong rise in taxes and
contributions (7% y-o-y), the budget deficit
remained on course, in the first eight months, at
38% of the full-year target. This came (again) on
the back of capital spending, which dropped by
46% y-o-y, reaching only 23% of the annual
budget plan. The government is committed to
fiscal consolidation, planning to reduce the general
government budget deficit to 2% by 2021 from
2.7% in 2017. But it has still not adopted measures
to cut expenditure or raise revenue, while raising
transfers and subsidies. The ongoing overhaul of
social protection to provide a minimum guaranteed
income also adds a risk to the government's plans.
Given its optimistic GDP and revenue forecast,
deficit targets may prove overly confident.

loan disbursements for public sector construction,
resulting from the new government revising
previously budgeted projects as well as from
technical problems. The expected imminent
resumption of these projects is likely to impact
debt levels in 2019 and 2020. Rising interest
payments, sustained primary budget deficits and
fundraising for post-2020 rollover needs may
cause a more significant rise in debt over the
forecast horizon than projected by the government.

30. MONTENEGRO
A rebalancing of growth drivers on the horizon
Over the forecast horizon, the composition of growth is expected to be altered by the completion of two
important infrastructure projects which are set to lead to a significant deceleration of investment. At the
same time, the resulting contraction of construction-related imports, along with capacity-increasing
projects in the export sector, are expected to turn the contribution of net exports to growth positive,
compensating for the projected slowdown in domestic demand.
Growth expectations revised upwards

In the first half of 2018, the economy continued to
grow at a robust pace (4.7% y-o-y), driven by a
sustained surge in public and private investment.
In spite of stagnating wages, households'
consumption recovered in the second quarter of
2018, supported by stronger bank lending and
tourism. Public consumption also supported
growth in the first half of 2018, driven by an
increase in government expenditure on goods and
services. Despite favourable export performance,
imports also grew fast, leading to a negative
contribution of net exports to GDP.

with Italy will help boost electricity exports.
Overall, the reduction of imports and new
production capacities are set to reverse the
negative contribution of net exports in 2020.
Private and public consumption are forecast to
remain subdued in 2019 as a result of announced
fiscal consolidation measures aimed at curbing
public employment and wage growth. This trend
could however reverse to some extent in the run-up
to the general election due in October 2020.
Overall, GDP growth is forecast to slow down in
2019, and to slightly rebound in 2020.
There are, however, some downside risks to the
growth outlook. The growth contribution from
exports of services could moderate as some
tourists might return to other Mediterranean
destinations like Turkey, Egypt or Tunisia. In
addition, a possible slowdown in world trade,
stemming from tensions between the US and its
trade partners, could hinder exports of the local
metal industry.

Limited impact on growth from the completion
of large investment projects

The expected completion of two important
infrastructures, namely the interconnection power
cable with Italy and the first section of the
Bar-Boljare highway between 2019 and 2020, are
set to dampen investment, and therefore its
contribution to GDP growth. At the same time,
investment-related imports are forecast to decline
as these large projects are completed. Moreover,
new investments in the production of aluminium as
well as in new renewable energy plants (wind and
solar), are projected to reinforce export capacity.
In addition, the undersea interconnection cable

The increase of VAT and excise duties at the
beginning of 2018 had a lasting impact on two key
drivers of inflation: tobacco and fuels, accounting
together for more than one percentage point of the
overall increase in the consumer price index.
Average inflation peaked at 3.9% y-o-y in March,
easing thereafter in spite of strong seasonal
demand during the summer tourism season for
food, restaurants and accommodation services.
Overall, annual inflation is estimated to average
around 3% in 2018, and is forecast to decline
slightly afterwards, so long as wage growth
remains contained.
Gradual improvement in the labour market

Notwithstanding seasonal fluctuations, the
unemployment rate further improved in the second
quarter to 14.7%, down from 15.3% a year before.
Unemployment is expected to continue the regular
seasonal pattern, further declining in the third

quarter during the summer tourism season, to
rebound again in the last quarter. So far, the
outlook is for a gradual improvement of the labour
market. However, the implementation of the public
administration reform may have some negative but
temporary effects on unemployment. The expected
downsizing in the public sector, estimated at some
three thousand jobs until the end of 2020; is
equivalent to 1.3% of total employed persons in
the country.

annual highway costs are fully accounted for at the
end of the year. Moreover, additional expenditure
for severance payments related to the
reorganisation of the public administration could
also weigh on the budget balance. In 2020, once
the highway works are completed, the budget is
expected to swing to a significant surplus.
However, possible cost overruns and delays
remain important downside risks. Moreover,
additional public expenditure pressures may
materialise in the context of the general elections
to be held in 2020.

A turning point for public finances

In 2017, the government adopted a series of
reforms to strengthen the budget and to stabilise
public debt over the medium term. The reform
package included, among others, the increase in
2018 of VAT rates and excise duties, as well as a
new debt management strategy. Consequently, and
thanks also to strong economic growth, the budget
deficit contracted significantly in the first seven
months of 2018. Revenues increased substantially,
boosted by VAT receipts, income taxes and social
security contributions. However, by the end of
2018, the budget deficit is expected to exceed the
government's full-year target of 2.2% of GDP,
since capital spending has so far underperformed
compared to the plan, but could pick-up once the

Public debt is expected to peak in 2018 due to two
major financial operations: an emission of
Eurobonds; and a credit arrangement with
commercial banks to finance current liabilities and
to form a reserve to reduce medium-term
refinancing risks. The impact from tighter global
financing conditions is expected to be rather
limited, as a significant part of public debt was
issued on concessional terms or fixed interest rates
with long maturities. Overall, the public
debt-to-GDP ratio should be put on a downward
path as of 2019 thanks to fast nominal GDP
growth and the conclusion of the debt-financed
highway section.

Forging ahead
Economic growth shifted up a gear to nearly 5% (y-o-y) in the first half of 2018. The outlook appears
strong and growth should remain vibrant despite the forecast slight moderation. Investment is expected
to be robust and domestic consumption to receive a further boost from rising employment and income.
Financing conditions and fiscal policy are forecast to be supportive of growth. Strong domestic demand
and worsening terms of trade, however, are set to push up inflation and external imbalances.
Growth shifts up a gear

GDP growth shifted up a gear in the first half of
2018, approaching nearly 5% (y-o-y). Domestic
demand was very strong, supported by rising
private and public consumption, but also by
changes in inventories and double-digit investment
growth. On the supply side, growth was sustained
across all sectors. Construction activity grew by
more than 20%, reflecting both base effects and
the ongoing pickup in investment, while a good
agricultural season boosted the sector to
double-digit growth. External trade dynamics also
were strong, although growth of both exports and
imports has eased. High domestic demand took a
toll on external imbalances and the merchandise
trade deficit widened. The increase in the current
account deficit was contained only due to a
positive but likely temporary spike in worker's
remittances and lower investment income
outflows.
Short-term indicators have sent mixed signals
about economic activity in the third quarter of this
year. On one side, the growth of domestic
consumption is likely to have strengthened further,
as retail trade expanded strongly in July and
August. However, industrial production entered a
soft patch, falling 4.3% (y-o-y) in August.
Domestic demand to set the tune

Economic growth is forecast to moderate slightly
but to remain vibrant. Domestic demand, in
particular, should continue being strong and is
expected to level out in 2019 and 2020,
determining the pace of economic expansion. After
a long period of restraint, consumers have regained
confidence, which, together with benign labour
market conditions and growing incomes and
transfers, is forecast to support higher household
consumption growth. With fiscal performance on a
more sustainable footing, public consumption
should also provide steady support for growth.

148

Investment surprised on the upside in the first half
of 2018. Due to base effects, however, it is
expected to moderate over the forecast horizon.
Export growth should slow down towards the end
of the period as external demand, particularly from
the EU, weakens.
The growing economy is expected to stimulate
further employment gains and unemployment is
forecast to fall to its lowest level in decades. These
conditions, in conjunction with negative terms of
trade developments, are forecast to push inflation
up slightly, closer towards the midpoint (3%) of
the central bank’s target band. The same factors
are also set to contribute to the expected widening
of external imbalances.
Risks are broadly balanced

There are upside risks to investment and export
performance as financing conditions remain
supportive, fiscal space for public investment has
increased, and a number of large FDI projects are
in the pipeline.

On the other side, a significant slowdown or halt to

impact on investor confidence. In addition, the
forecast scenario could be easily derailed by large
external shocks coming from international trade or
geopolitical tensions.

Candidate Countries, Serbia

The forecast has not taken into account the latest
revision of Serbia’s 2015-17 annual national
accounts data. The revision lifted real and nominal
GDP and changed all GDP components but
remained incomplete as it did not cover quarterly
profiles or data in base year prices.

Remaining fiscally strong

government budget surplus. This strength has
allowed the government to start unwinding
temporary pension cuts, which were introduced at
the height of the crisis.
Part of the fiscal space in 2019 is planned to be
used to increase public wages and boost capital
expenditure. While the budgetary stance is
projected to be supportive of growth, the overall
budget deficit is nevertheless forecast to remain
close to balance. This would ensure further
reduction of government debt to levels
approaching 50% of GDP by the end of 2020.
The good fiscal performance is expected to be
further supported by the implementation of
long-standing reforms of the tax and public
administration, and by completing the restructuring
and privatisation of major state-owned enterprises.
These and other key structural reforms, including
strengthening of the system of fiscal rules, are also
at the centre of Serbia’s new agreement with the
IMF.

Serbia’s acute fiscal challenges are now in the past
and 2018 is projected to end with another general

32. TURKEY
Risks materialising
The high economic growth of recent years came with sizable risks that are now materialising. Turkey’s
economy is expected to go through a recession in the second half of 2018 and early 2019 before it
returns to growth as net trade picks up, confidence improves, and private consumption recovers.
Turkish economic growth is expected to be less credit-fuelled following the recession. The transition to
this more sustainable economic growth comes with sizable risks as a consequence of the vulnerabilities
that built up over the years.
Vulnerabilities exposed

Economic growth in Turkey was high until the
start of the third quarter of 2018 but there are
increasing signs that the economy has fallen into a
recession as a result of the rapid deterioration in
external conditions. Vulnerabilities had built up
over the years such as a high current account
deficit, increasing foreign liabilities (both in
foreign and domestic currency), high and
increasing
inflation,
stubbornly
high
unemployment, and a deteriorating business
climate. The change in investor sentiment towards
emerging market economies together with rising
interest rates in developed markets and policy
uncertainty triggered by political developments
brought these vulnerabilities to the tipping point,
with the Turkish lira falling some 35% against the
euro since the beginning of the year.

Credit crunch leading to a recession

The credit-fuelled economy has suffered from a
strong deterioration in credit conditions with
interest rates rising and real credit supply shrinking
at the same time. The supply of credit is expected
to stay weak until mid-2019 as bank stocks have
fallen, companies are starting to slip on loan
repayments, and the real value of assets is being

150

eroded by high inflation. Turkey’s economy also
has large external financing needs.
The corporate sector is by far the most exposed to
the changes in financing conditions. Investment in
the construction sector, which has been an
important growth driver in recent years, will see
the biggest impact, as large infrastructure projects
have been put on hold by the government. Housing
construction will suffer as households are finding
it increasingly difficult to finance house purchases
and over-development in recent years means that
many properties risk being either sold at heavy
discounts or not sold at all. In the manufacturing
sector, the investment that was needed to address
historically high capacity utilisation rates is now
likely to be postponed. Exports are expected to
compensate for part of the drop in domestic
demand and to provide some support to the
balance sheets of indebted companies. The nonconstruction corporate sector is expected to start
recovering in 2019, as it adapts to the new, more
stringent financing conditions and tighter credit
supply. The financing conditions and credit supply
are expected to normalise in 2019 below levels
prevailing up to the lira crash. This leads to
investment growth gradually picking up in 2019 in
the manufacturing sector and in 2020 in the
construction sector.
Consumers are less exposed to changes in foreign
financing conditions than corporates in Turkey.
Still, in the short run the deteriorating credit
conditions and depreciation of the lira affect
consumer demand, as evidenced by the recent
sharp drop in car sales. High inflation (25% in
September) and the drop in consumer confidence
to the lowest level since the 2008 crisis are putting
further pressure on private consumption. After this
initial shock, however, private consumption is
expected to pick up again with consumer
confidence returning, support to disposable income
through increases of (minimum) wages and
through debt burdens partly being inflated away.
The labour market is expected to improve towards

Candidate Countries, Turkey

the latter part of 2019 mostly on the back of a
rebound in external and private consumption
demand.
Transition risks

The forecast assumes appropriate policy action and
a smooth transition to a more sustainable growth
path with lower credit growth, in particular to the
construction sector. The risks of an uncontrolled
unwinding of imbalances, however, are sizable and
the functioning of the market economy is under
pressure as a consequence of policy makers
interfering in the price-setting process. There is
also a risk that that monetary policy will not be
sufficiently tight to bring down inflation, impeding
competitiveness and private demand. Another risk
is a deterioration of banks’ balance sheets to a
level necessitating bail-out as a consequence of
increasing non-performing loans, high inflation
and difficulties with external funding of the
domestic savings gap.
Inflation firmly into double digits

The sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira raises
the inflation rate further from already elevated
levels. Inflation is forecast to reach 17.5% on

average this year before levelling off as both
exchange rate and demand pressure subside.
Lowering inflation permanently, however, has
become increasingly costly because of the
confidence lost in monetary policy, increasing
inflation expectations, and the indexation of
minimum wages. The inflation rate is, thus,
expected to register double digits in the coming
two years.
The fiscal anchor and its price

The government’s vow to adopt some fiscal
tightening has helped to restore a degree of
investor confidence in public finances and in
policy making more generally. To maintain this
anchor, however, the government has little option
but to continue with a pro-cyclical fiscal policy
stance as the economy enters a recession.
Moreover, the government’s focus on expenditure
cuts implies that it chooses the fiscal policy
channel with the highest multiplier. The benefit of
this will be to limit the risk premium that investors
demand on Turkish government bonds. All in all,
while fiscal policy is likely to help win back some
confidence, it will be a drag on economic growth
in 2019.

33. ALBANIA
Growth set to continue at a solid pace
Economic growth is expected to remain solid, driven mainly by private consumption. It is, however
forecast to soften in 2019 as electricity production is unlikely to continue at the exceptional level of
early 2018. The strengthening Albanian currency is likely to weigh on export growth. The high level of
public debt as a share of GDP is forecast to continue its gradual decline.
Favourable weather drives strong expansion
early 2018

The upturn of the Albanian economy continued in
the first half of 2018 with annual GDP growth
exceeding 4% (y-o-y) as very favourable weather
conditions pushed agricultural and hydroelectricity
production in addition to a good tourist season. On
the demand side, private consumption strengthened
its solid growth to 3.2% (y-o-y) over the first half
of 2018, being the main growth driver, whereas
government consumption shrank by 0.6% (y-o-y)
in the same period. Exports were supported by
solid external demand in particular for
commodities. GDP growth is expected to soften in
2019 and 2020 to 3.9%, mainly on account of
lower electricity production and the completion of
two large energy projects.
Growing employment and increasing wages
continue supporting domestic demand

Household spending is expected to remain the
main driver of growth, still benefitting from
favourable financial conditions, moderate inflation
and from growing employment in combination
with moderate wage growth. Employment was 5%
higher early 2018 than one year earlier and solid
job creation is set to continue, bringing down the
unemployment rate (15-64 years) to below 11% by
2020. In line with fiscal consolidation, public
consumption is set to remain constrained with an
average growth of 2.5% over 2018-2020. On the
investment side, public investment is planned to
grow 5% annually, and the government is hoping
to mobilise private investment into a number of
infrastructure projects. Private investment is set to
be driven by FDI into tourism, health and
education facilities and into renewable energy.
Decelerating exports and imports lower the
trade deficit only slightly

Electricity exports and higher oil prices are
boosting exports value in 2018. At the same time,
robust domestic demand and the stronger lek are
holding up imports growth. The contribution of net

152

exports to growth is set to be still slightly negative,
albeit less than in 2017. The recent real
appreciation of the Albanian currency weighs on
price competitiveness and the export industries’
margins, but a negative effect on exports is likely
to appear only in 2019 when new investment
decisions and contracts will be made.
In 2019 and 2020, export growth is forecast to
decelerate partly on account of the lagged
appreciation effect, but mainly because of lower
oil and electricity exports. Import growth, which
has been driven by some large energy projects in
recent years, is expected to slow down further in
2019 as these projects near completion. The
current account deficit is set to continue narrowing
over the forecast horizon to 6% of GDP supported
by a slightly improving trade deficit, the currency
appreciation, and increased transfers, in particular
remittances and official transfers.

The monetary easing has been enhanced with the
Bank of Albania reducing its policy interest rate
further by 0.25 pps to the record low of 1% in
June. It has also stated that the monetary stimulus
will not weaken before the 2019-Q2. This is
explained by lower-than-expected inflation, which
has edged up to 2.2% (y-o-y) by mid-2018 but still
undershoots the 3% target. Recently, the marked
appreciation of the Albanian lek against the euro

Candidate Countries, Albania

has weighed on the inflation rate. The central bank
halted the pace of the appreciation in mid-2018
with euro purchases. Though, inflation is likely to
pick up only moderately over the forecast horizon.
The public debt ratio continues its gradual
decline

The fiscal deficit in 2018 is set to remain within
the 2.0% of GDP target. The government’s current
fiscal strategy envisages a decline of the deficit to
1.7 % and 1.2 % of GDP for 2019 and 2020,
respectively and for the public debt-to-GDP ratio a
fall from 70% at the end of 2017 to 63.5% at the
end of 2020. This entails containing expenditure
growth to around 5% and increasing tax revenue
(by up to 6.5% and 7.5% annually) and higher
social insurance contributions. Slower-thanexpected tax revenue growth, not yet quantified
contingent fiscal liabilities and ad-hoc social
expenditure items constitute a negative risk to this
projection.
Public financing conditions improved further and
markets confirmed Albania’s positive development
in October 2018 when a 500 million EUR 7-year
Eurobond achieved a 3.55% interest rate,
2.2 points below the last 5-year issuance in 2015.

Slowing down of reforms and public debt
reduction pose downside risks to the outlook

A slower than announced reduction of public debt
would undermine financial markets’ new
confidence and put infrastructure investments at
risk which are key for sustaining growth and
energy supplies. A slowdown of reforms could
dampen the private demand while exports could
suffer from lower than projected growth of
Albania’s major trade partner Italy.

34. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Buoyant near-term outlook but downside risks are mounting
Burgeoning fiscal stimulus, against the backdrop of already-strong momentum and a tightening labour
market, is set to push US GDP growth to 2.9% and 2.6% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In 2020,
growth is expected to moderate towards 2% in line with the fading support provided by macroeconomic
policies. The outlook is subject to significant downside risks related to overheating, a sharp tightening
in financial conditions, adverse trade policy shifts and an abrupt contraction of fiscal policy in 2020.
Economic momentum set to remain robust

The US economy gathered momentum during the
first half of 2018, with real GDP growth
accelerating to 1% (q-o-q) in 2018-Q2 (from 0.5%
q-o-q in 2018-Q1). This reflects strong consumer
spending due to high sentiment and a strong labour
market, as well as the initial impact of personal
income tax cuts. Business fixed investment also
remains strong following corporate income tax
cuts and wider incentives to increase capital
spending. Somewhat unexpectedly, net exports
have also made a significant positive contribution
to growth throughout the first half of 2018,
although this may reflect a temporary frontloading
of foreign demand in anticipation of trade tariffs in
some sectors and is expected to unwind in the
remainder of 2018.
Going forward, the impulse provided by the fiscal
stimulus should continue to carry the US economy
above its potential. The direct impact of the
announced trade tariffs on real activity is expected
to be limited in the near term given the economy’s
buoyant underlying momentum. Overall, the US
economy is expected to grow by 2.9% in 2018 and
2.6% in 2019, before moderating to around 2% in
2020 in line with the gradual tightening of
monetary policy and the fading support from the
fiscal stimulus.
Fiscal stimulus drives labour market tightening

Employment growth continued to strengthen in
2018, pushing the unemployment rate below 4%
for the first time during this cycle and drawing
further workers from inactivity. The labour market
is expected to tighten further as tax cuts across
personal and corporate incomes as well as agreed
increases in defence and non-defence spending
underpin a robust outlook for consumer spending
business fixed investment, and government
consumption over the course of 2018 and 2019.
Recent rises in oil prices also underpin a stronger
outlook for the energy sector. As the growth
impulse from the tax cuts is expected to fade

156

towards the end of the forecast horizon,
employment growth is forecast to slow, albeit
sustaining the unemployment rate at 3.5% in 2020.

Monetary policy to contain price pressures…

Inflationary pressures have continued building on
the back of rising energy and housing costs. Core
inflation has hit the Federal Reserve’s 2% target
for the first time since 2012 and wage growth has
picked up, but without any signs of sharp
acceleration as yet. Upward price and wage
pressures are set to remain in place as fiscal
stimulus pushes output beyond potential,
underpinning further tightening in monetary policy
throughout the forecast horizon. It is anticipated
that gradual rises in the federal funds rate –
reaching a neutral level already during the course
of 2019, before turning slightly contractionary
thereafter – will be sufficient to prevent a large
overheating of the economy.
…but path for fiscal policy highly uncertain.

The budgetary impact of the fiscal stimulus is
heavily frontloaded as falling revenues lead to a
sizeable deterioration in the fiscal position already
in 2018. In this regard, the general government
deficit is forecast to rise to 5¾% and 6% of GDP
in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, the US

Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America

fiscal policy will go from very expansionary to
very contractionary unless the Congress finds an
agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff. In this regard,
the upcoming midterm elections will have a major
bearing on the outlook for federal government
spending in future years. This forecast assumes a
continuation of the expenditure ceilings from
earlier years implying a broadly growth neutral
fiscal stance in 2020. In tandem with the fading
growth impulse from the tax cuts and the gradually
rising interest rates, the macroeconomic policy
stance will likely become markedly less supportive
towards the end of the forecast horizon.
US dollar strengthening, widening imbalances

The steady progression of monetary policy
normalisation is set to feed through to tighter
financing conditions. In recent weeks, the yield on
10-year US Treasuries has risen above 3% and the
US dollar has appreciated once again (overall by
around 6% in nominal effective terms since the
beginning of 2018). A strong US dollar, combined
with the robust outlook for domestic demand, is set
to place pressure on external imbalances. The
current account deficit, although having narrowed
due to temporary factors so far in 2018, is expected

to grow, reaching almost 3% of GDP in 2020.
Downside risks are mounting

Downside risks related to the overheating of the
economy and trade protectionism remain
prominent and interconnected. A fiscal expansion
at this late stage in the cycle could result in a sharp
rise in wages and prices that requires a more
aggressive tightening of monetary policy. This
would weigh on domestic demand, including the
housing sector in the US, and potentially lead to
re-pricing of financial market risks which could
expose vulnerabilities in some highly leveraged
companies. The fiscal stimulus is also set to
increase the general government debt level,
aggravating the existing concerns regarding fiscal
sustainability and limiting the policy space to
respond to future downturns. Moreover, trade
tensions with China have continued to escalate and
any further adverse developments – reinforced by
the expected deterioration of the US trade balance
– could add inflationary pressures and also lead to
sharp monetary policy tightening. In 2020, the
outlook remains highly uncertain as an abrupt
contraction of fiscal policy could lead to a sharper
deceleration of the economy.

35. JAPAN
Growth slows as fiscal consolidation goes ahead
Real GDP growth is set to remain stable in 2019 supported by continued monetary accommodation,
tight labour market conditions, and front-loaded demand ahead of the October 2019 consumption tax
hike. In 2020 the pace of growth is expected to decelerate reflecting near-term volatility in the wake of
planned fiscal consolidation.
Slowdown after continued stable growth

GDP growth is expected at 1.1% in 2018 and
should remain stable in 2019 reflecting tight labour
market conditions and accommodative monetary
policy. In 2020 the pace of growth is expected to
decelerate to 0.5% on the back of retrenchment in
domestic demand following planned fiscal
consolidation. After eight consecutive quarters of
output expansion, near-term growth turned more
volatile over 2018-H1, with real GDP growth of
0.7% (q-o-q) in Q2, rebounding from -0.2%
(q-o-q) in Q1. Private non-residential (business)
investment and private consumption were the main
growth drivers in Q2, with private residential
investment and net exports weighing on growth.
Leading indicators point to deceleration in Q3. In
August industrial production rebounded more
weakly than expected after three m-o-m
contractions, and in September business sentiment
declined for the third straight quarter. Consumer
confidence has been on a moderate downtrend
since January, but consumption activity has
remained rather resilient so far despite adverse
weather conditions over the summer. On the
positive side, core machinery orders, a leading
indicator for business investment, recorded strong
growth in July and August, and the new-job-offersto-applicant ratio hovers at the highest levels ever.
Heightened near-term volatility expected

Near-term growth is expected to remain stable
over the coming quarters, and turn more volatile in
2019-H2 reflecting front-loaded expenditure ahead
of planned fiscal consolidation. Labour market
conditions should remain very tight, with the
unemployment rate at well below 3% over the
forecast horizon reflecting sustained labour
demand amid increasingly severe labour supply
shortages. Private consumption is set to grow at a
stable pace over the coming quarters, accelerate in
the run-up to the October 2019 consumption tax
hike, and contract immediately thereafter. A robust
labour market and loose financial conditions
should underpin gradual private consumption
recovery in the wake of the tax hike. Investment

158

conditions should remain broadly favourable
domestically, reflecting continued monetary
accommodation and capital deepening stemming
from labour shortages. Planned fiscal consolidation
is however expected to entail heightened volatility
also in private investment components over the
second half of 2019, with near-term contraction in
the fourth quarter. Solid labour market
performance, extended monetary support and
construction investment associated to the 2020
Tokyo Olympics should buttress investment
recovery in 2020.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Export performance is expected to decline
gradually over the forecast period reflecting
deceleration in global and regional trade growth.
Import dynamics should turn increasingly volatile
in 2019 reflecting fiscally-induced front-loaded
demand, and stage a gradual recovery thereafter in
line with domestic demand. Net exports are
expected to remain broadly neutral, with increased
monetary policy divergence and the Tokyo 2020
Olympics underpinning a slightly positive
contribution towards the end of the forecast
horizon.
Planned fiscal consolidation goes ahead

Fiscal consolidation has made steady progress in
recent years, with the primary balance estimated to
have narrowed to around 3.0% of GDP in 2017,

Other non-EU Countries, Japan

down from 7.0% in 2013. At the same time
Japan’s new medium-term fiscal plan postponed
the target year to achieve a primary balance from
FY 2020 to FY 2025. In the absence of new
structural fiscal measures, the plan assumes that
real and nominal GDP growth are lifted to and
sustained at around 2% and 3% respectively,
which would entail additional structural efforts to
lift potential growth. Over the forecast period
fiscal performance should continue improving on
the back of resilient economic activity and the
implementation of the planned October 2019
increase in the consumption tax rate from 8% to
10%, with the primary balance expected to
gradually narrow to around 2% of GDP.
Continued monetary accommodation

In July the Bank of Japan allowed for additional
flexibility in the 10-year yield around the
benchmark 0% level, and provided forward
guidance to maintain interest rates at currently low
levels for an extended period of time. Monetary
policy is expected to remain accommodative
throughout the forecast horizon in line with the
Bank of Japan’s forward guidance. With the Bank

of Japan’s share of Japanese government securities
having expanded to 35.8% of outstanding
government debt in September 2018 and rising,
policy deliberations around eventual Quantitative
and Qualitative Easing exit will warrant close
monitoring.
Risks

The balance of risks has gradually shifted to the
downside, in particular on the external front.
Further heightening of global trade tensions
remains an important risk reflecting exposure to
the Chinese and US economies – Japan’s main
export destinations – and integration into Asian
supply chains. Disorderly tightening of global
financial conditions may trigger safe haven flows
towards yen-denominated assets, with detrimental
exchange rate effects. Domestically, upside risks
may entail stronger than expected wage growth
stemming from increasingly tight labour market
conditions in conjunction with implementation of
equal-pay-for-equal-work reform, while additional
offsetting fiscal measures may mitigate the nearterm growth and volatility impact of planned fiscal
consolidation.

36. CHINA
Solid growth but key structural challenges remain
China’s growth performance remained fairly strong in the first half of 2018 but China is expected to
decelerate going forward amid moderating consumption growth, weaker export growth and a slowdown
in the property sector. The impact of trade tariffs imposed by the US is likely to be mitigated by domestic
policy easing and weaker currency but associated downside risks to the outlook are increasing.
GDP grew strongly in 2017 and early 2018

China grew surprisingly strongly in 2017 and early
2018, with growth of 6.9% in 2017, 6.8% in 2018
Q1 and 6.7% in 2018 Q2. The economy slowed to
in Q3 to 6.5% and recent high frequency data
confirm some loss of momentum, but growth for
2018 is expected to be fairly healthy at 6.6%.
Growth in 2019 and 2020 is forecast to fall slightly
more than anticipated in past forecasts, with some
impact from trade disputes, but with any slowdown
softened by policy easing. In sum, growth is
projected to fall to 6.2% in 2019 and 5.9% in 2020.
Risks to the outlook however are elevated, with
increased constraints on Chinese domestic policy,
the possibility of further deterioration on the trade
front, and the potential for weaker domestic
demand if the housing market slows more than
expected.
China's strong growth in 2017 was down to a
combination of external and domestic factors.
Global and regional trade picked up sharply, with
China's net exports adding 0.6 pps. to GDP in
2017. Consumption also remained very buoyant,
adding 4 pps. to growth while investment grew
somewhat less rapidly than in previous years.
Positive momentum carried over into early 2018
but with a marked shift in the composition of
spending towards domestic demand. Consumption
proved very strong in 2018-H1, adding over 5 pps.
to growth. Net exports turned negative (-0.6 pps.)
as strong import growth outpaced exports. Private
investment picked up in early 2018 and the real
estate sector remained very buoyant, despite
widespread expectations that the current property
market cycle was running out of steam.
This solid growth performance was accompanied
by a stabilisation of China's corporate debt-to-GDP
ratio in 2017 at around 165%. This was due in
large part to a substantial spike in the GDP
deflator, rather than much slower credit growth.
But policies to clamp down on the financial sector
did prove effective, with a sharp reduction in

160

lending by non-bank financial intermediaries, with
only limited effect on growth.

Recent data has been softer, but with no sharp
slowdown evident

Recent months have seen some softening in some
high frequency data, including retail sales and
fixed asset investment. Export growth has also
proved more tepid than in 2017. But other
indicators remain buoyant, including PMIs.
Growth is expected to moderate somewhat in
2018-H2, but not dramatically.
Looking ahead, China faces a number of growthdampening factors. Firstly, the growth of
household consumption is unlikely to maintain the
unusually high pace of early 2018 as households
incomes are growing no faster than GDP.
Secondly, the current forecast factors in the impact
of trade tariffs imposed on USD 250 billion worth
of Chinese exports to the US, including the
expected increase in the tariff rate from 10%
currently to 25% as of January 2019. Further
increases in tariffs also cannot be excluded.
Thirdly, the current property cycle has been
unusually extended, with some slowing expected
already in 2018. Slower growth in this sector is
therefore anticipated in 2019 and 2020 amid
significant downside risks.

Other non-EU Countries, China

Policy easing has started, but faces constraints

China has already instituted some policy easing,
with several cuts in required reserve ratios for
banks, some targeted credit measures, and tax cuts
for the corporate sector. Nevertheless, China faces
a number of policy constraints. Much looser
monetary policy would put pressure on the RMB
which has already fallen sharply this year. With
rising US rates a further loosening would risk
igniting capital outflows, forcing China to choose
between further reserve depletion and a more
uncontrolled float. Fiscal loosening is a more
flexible option, and fiscal support may come in
part via some reversal of the wind-down in state
investment and infrastructure spending seen in
2017. But this in turn risks a return to rising
leverage ratios and would cut across needed
structural reforms in the state sector. Further fiscal
measures are therefore expected to be data
dependent and targeted, with larger stimulus likely
only if clear signs of a sharp slowdown emerge.
Risks are elevated and policy dependent

The trade outlook is highly uncertain. Export
growth moderated in 2018, in part reflecting the
outperformance in 2017, but there is little evidence
so far of direct impact from current trade disputes.
However, as tariffs gain some traction, a gradual

impact on export growth is to be expected, and the
additional US tariff hikes in January 2019 are set
to have a material impact. The weakening of the
RMB in recent months can however be expected to
provide some support for exports and to help
moderate import growth.
Downside risks exist for consumption, which has
been surprisingly buoyant for several years, driven
by a falling savings rate and higher borrowing.
Household debt levels remain low by developed
economy standards, but are no longer low by
emerging market standards. Finally, risks exist
linked to the property market. Real estate
investment remains a major driver of overall
investment and has partly compensated for weak
investment in other sectors over the past 2 years. A
housing downturn would provide a further major
challenge to current growth objectives. Private
investment has been weak for some time, but there
are some signs in 2018 of a revival in
manufacturing and this is an upside risk. In the
heavy industrial sectors, where state firms are
more present, profits have increased sharply due to
capacity control measures and this could also spur
some expansion. A more aggressive return to state
led-infrastructure spending is likely should the
broader outlook worsen noticeably.

37. EFTA
Sound outlook amid still-elevated risks
EFTA countries are currently enjoying strong growth, benefitting from a broadly supportive external
environment and solid domestic demand. At this relatively late stage in the cycle, labour markets have
continued to tighten and capacity constraints are becoming binding, prompting some signs of
inflationary pressures, and a gradual removal of policy supports is anticipated, even as external risks
remain elevated.
Switzerland

Output growth remained strong in the first half of
2018, benefiting from strong external and domestic
demand. However, during this period, the sources
of growth shifted from the export oriented sector
and from services, to domestic demand. This
pattern was re-enforced by special factors, such as
the 2018 football world championship, which due
to the Swiss residence of the key organiser, the
FIFA, resulted in a significant boost of value
added in the Swiss service sector. Overall, real
GDP decelerated, from 1.0% growth (q-o-q) in the
first three months, to 0.7% (q-o-q) during AprilJune. Inflation accelerated during the year,
reaching 0.9% during the first nine months of
2018, reflecting increasing oil prices but also
delayed effects of the Swiss franc's depreciation
during mid-2018. The federal government has
recorded a small surplus in the first half of the
year, which is in line with the still strong position
in the business cycle and the statutory debt brake.

Net exports are likely to remain an important
source of growth, partly as important export
markets for machinery, chemistry and precision
tools are expected to register solid growth.
Investment in equipment is expected to be another
important driver of growth, as due to the currently
high capacity utilisation, companies are expected
to expand their production capacities. Furthermore,
the currently low interest rate level supports the
financing of fixed investment and construction.
This growth supportive monetary stance is
expected to remain in place during the forecasting
period. Private consumption is set to expand
slightly on the back of gradual improvement in the
labour market. As underlying price pressures
remain weak, inflation is projected to continue at
around 1 % over the forecast period. The
underlying strong growth will help to keep public
sector accounts close to balance. This forecast does
not incorporate any assumption for future reforms
of corporate taxation and the pension system
following their rejection in a referendum in 2017.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside and
mainly related to the external environment.
Geopolitical turbulences and renewed volatility in
financial markets could lead to safe haven capital
inflows which would put an upward pressure on
the exchange rate. Further downside risk relates to
the uncertain global trade outlook.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Going forward, real GDP growth is forecast to
reach about 3% in 2018 and to slow down towards
2% by 2020, which however will still be above the
10-year average growth (about 1½% annually).
The main factors for the deceleration are related to
a declining stimulus from external demand, but
also lower growth of disposable income due to

Norway

Real GDP growth in Norway accelerated to 0.4%
(q-o-q) in 2018-Q2 (from 0.2% q-o-q in 2018-Q1),
underpinned by a robust labour market as
registered unemployment fell further to precommodity price downturn levels and wage
growth is accelerating; while higher oil prices and
rebounding fixed investment in the energy sector
have offset weakness in residential construction.

Other non-EU Countries, EFTA

Going forward, these dynamics are set to remain in
place throughout the forecast horizon, and present
a broadly benign outlook: sentiment indicators
remain elevated and surveys point to continued
solid employment growth; while the bright outlook
for mainland demand and continued rises in energy
prices provide the basis for further strengthening
business fixed investment. As a corollary to robust
domestic demand, however, net exports are
expected to place substantial drag on growth in the
near term. Overall, real GDP growth is forecast at
1¾% in 2018, before accelerating modestly to
under 2% in both 2019 and 2020.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

A number of estimates point to the economy
already performing broadly at potential, while
tightening labour market conditions are beginning
to place sustained upward pressure on wage
growth and core inflation (at 1.9% y-o-y in
September) has steadily gathered momentum over
recent months. As a result, Norges Bank raised its
key policy rate by 25 basis points (to 0.75%) at its
September meeting, while also signalling that
further tightening is anticipated already in the near
term. Monetary policy accommodation therefore,
while remaining highly supportive at the current
juncture, is set to be gradually removed in the
coming years, with this complementing the shift in
fiscal policy towards a neutral stance.
Recent budgetary proposals anticipate a neutral
fiscal impulse in 2019, resulting in a stable non-oil
structural balance (at 7.5% of mainland GDP) and
spending of oil revenues equivalent to 2.7% of the
sovereign wealth fund (Government Pension Fund
Global). This remains well within the parameters
set by the fiscal rules, as well as providing for
modest growth in public spending and a slight fall
in the general corporate tax rate to 22% (from 23%
at present). In the absence of materialising risks, it

is assumed that a similarly prudent fiscal stance
will be adopted in 2020 also.
Residential investment underwent a marked
contraction in the first half of 2018, reflecting
earlier modest price declines. Although house
price growth has turned positive once again in
year-on-year terms, a recovery in residential fixed
investment is expected to be only gradual given
several concurrent headwinds, including: modest
population growth; previously-introduced macroprudential measures; and the expected gradual rise
in interest rates.
Domestic risks to the outlook stem primarily from
uncertainties facing the property market and, in the
context of high household debt levels (over 100%
of GDP), the potential for a sharp reversal in prices
following large appreciation in earlier years.
Nonetheless, the moderation in price growth over
the past year has constrained a further build-up of
debt levels and financial stability concerns are
offset by high profitability and capital adequacy
levels. Concerning the external environment,
energy prices present upside and downside risks;
while a shift towards protectionism among
Norway's main trading partners would weigh
materially on growth.
Iceland

Following deceleration towards the end of 2017,
GDP growth has rebounded to 5.5% (y-o-y) in the
first half of 2018. Positive impetus came from
private consumption and housing investment while
the growth of exports decelerated to 0.2% (y-o-y)
in the second quarter, driven by the slowdown of
tourism exports. The pace of economic expansion
is projected to moderate in the second half of the
year in line with decelerating growth of tourist
arrivals and contracting business investment,
following the completion of large energy intensive
projects.
Going forward a more sustainable pace of GDP
growth is projected over the forecast horizon. The
historically strong krona weighs on exports of
tourism and manufactured goods while the
expansion of housing investment is set to
decelerate given an increasing supply of new
houses. Private investment is projected to remain
weak. Growth will be supported by investment in
public infrastructure and robust private
consumption on the back of increasing wages and
immigration.

163

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

driven by higher prices of petrol, housing and
some services, in particular airfares. As the
inflation-dampening effect of the krona’s past
appreciation is fading, rising wages are likely to
support inflation over the coming years.

The 2019 budget proposal expects increases of
funds allocated to healthcare, social affairs,
housing benefits and infrastructure. On the revenue
side the draft budget envisages the reform of the
tax system, which is set to reduce the tax burden
on lower-income groups and increase the reference
limits for child benefits. Taking into account the
proposed measures, the fiscal surplus is set to
decline in 2019.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

The rate of unemployment stood at 3.6% in Q2
which is slightly above (0.2 percentage points) the
same quarter of 2017. The inflow of foreign
workers has remained strong, with net migration
reaching 1.7% of the population in the first half of
the year. Given strong labour supply and
decelerating GDP growth, unemployment is
forecast to increase moderately in 2019-20.

The balance of risks is tilted to the downside. Key
domestic risk relates to potentially large wage
increases resulting from the ongoing collective
bargaining which would damage competitiveness
and fuel inflation. External risks stem from global
trade tensions which could hurt aluminium export
prices.

Inflation has accelerated in the course of 2018

38. RUSSIAN FEDERATION
Higher oil revenues and public investments support growth
The economic recovery has been progressing gradually as authorities were pursuing tight monetary and
fiscal policies and using the more benign external environment to rebuild buffers and increase resilience
to macroeconomic shocks. This is likely to change going forward, as fiscal and structural reforms are
being introduced and the government is more likely to use the current oil price surge to boost public
spending and economic activity.
Recovery in the oil market buoys growth

Economic activity in Russia rebounded marginally
after a weak end of 2017, with real GDP growth
rising from 0.9% (y-o-y) in 2017-Q4 to 1.9%
(y-o-y) in 2018-Q2. Domestic demand edged down
as recent bouts of US sanctions undermined
investor confidence and investments, though
private consumption remained resilient driven by
rising disposable incomes and increasing credit
supply.

Going forward, higher oil prices are set to boost
domestic demand. At the same time increasing oil
output and depreciating currency should support
foreign trade, though increased uncertainty and
higher financing costs related to the deteriorating
geopolitical situation and ongoing turmoil in
emerging markets are likely to undermine the scale
of the recovery. All in all, real GDP is forecast to
increase by 1.7% in 2018 and growth is expected
to edge down to 1.6% in 2019, reflecting an
increased tax burden, subdued productivity growth
and growing disintegration from global value
chains and financial markets. Economic activity is
set to rebound towards the end of the forecast
horizon, with real GDP growth accelerating to
1.8% in 2020, reflecting higher infrastructure
spending and a positive, albeit marginal, pension-

reform-driven
growth.

improvement

in

the

potential

Public spending boosts investments

Higher consumption taxes, rising retirement age
and limited increases in pensions and public sector
wages are likely to dent private consumption
outlook, despite rising real wages in the private
sector. Higher corporate credit growth is likely to
support private investment outlays, though
increased uncertainty related to the sanctions and
declining global investors' risk appetite cloud the
outlook. However, significant public investments
into transport and energy infrastructure are likely
to materialise in the second half of 2019 and
thereafter boosting overall investment growth
rates.
On the external side, import growth is likely to
decelerate rapidly from double digit growth in
2017 reflecting much weaker currency, before
recovering somewhat in the outer year of the
projection amid a pick-up in public investments.
Export growth is set to remain robust as oil
production cuts agreed with OPEC have been
relaxed and oil and gas production is booming.
All-in-all, the contribution of external trade to real
GDP growth is forecast to turn marginally positive
over the forecast horizon.
Rapid fiscal consolidation is over

Headline inflation increased to 3.4% in September
2018, driven by rebounding food prices and
weakening currency. Going forward, inflation is
expected to pick up to around 5% in 2019 on the
back of VAT rate hike, weaker currency and
increasing inflation expectations, before subsiding
to the central bank target of 4% in 2020.
Heightened uncertainty about sanctions, elevated
inflation expectations and a planned increase in the
VAT rate prompted the central bank in September
2018 to raise the key policy rate by 25 bps to
7.5%.

165

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2018

On the fiscal side, higher oil and gas revenues are
set to result in an improvement from a deficit of
1.5% of GDP in 2017 to a surplus of 1.8% of GDP
in 2018. Rapid fiscal consolidation is likely to end
in the outer years of the forecast horizon as
additional spending into infrastructure, human
capital and social support kicks in in 2019. Higher
expenditures are projected to be partly funded by
increased VAT rates and some relaxation of the
fiscal rule allowing for higher market borrowing.
The increase in the pension age to 65/60 for
men/women should also bring some fiscal savings
already in 2019. All in all, the fiscal balance is
likely to remain in surplus of around 1.5% of GDP
towards the end of the forecast horizon.
Current account surpluses boom amid higher
oil and gas revenues

Current account surplus is set to improve
significantly from 2.2% of GDP in 2017 to 5.6%
of GDP in 2018 amid increasing oil and gas
exports, booming oil prices and higher exports of
other commodities (e.g. wheat, metals). It is set to
gradually shrink over the forecast horizon to 4.9%
of GDP in 2020, as a pick-up in public investments
is expected to support imports.

Structural reform agenda progresses but major
challenges are still unaddressed

Despite the recent rise in the retirement age and
the announced increases in infrastructure and
human capital spending, which should boost
potential growth, the prospects of a significant
acceleration in long-term growth are bleak. They
are impeded by rapidly aging population, shrinking
labour force, extreme geographical and social
inequalities limiting the size of the domestic
market, increasing reach of the State, heavy
concentration in many sectors and a policy aimed
at decoupling from the external world.
Global risks remain at the front

Risks to the forecast are broadly balanced. High
geopolitical uncertainty and the prospect of further
intensification of economic sanctions remain key
downside risks to the outlook. In addition,
domestic financial conditions might be affected by
the stronger USD and outflows of foreign capital if
the ongoing turmoil in emerging markets deepens.
The major risks on the upside relate to higher oil
prices and higher-than-assumed fiscal multipliers
from the announced public investment spending
surge.

Statistical Annex

Note on concepts and sources
1. The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG ECFIN)
produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fully-fledged economic
forecasts in Winter, Spring and Autumn.These forecasts cover the
principal macroeconomic aggregates for the Member States, the
candidate countries,the European Union as a whole, the euro area and
the international environment.
2. Data for 2018, 2019 and 2020 are forecasts. The source for all tables is the
European Commission, unless otherwise stated. Historical data for the
Member States are based on the European System of Accounting (ESA
2010). Most Member States have now introduced chain-linking in their
national accounts to measure the development of economic
aggregates in volume terms. For the USA and Japan the definitions are as
in the SNA.
3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively,
present data including inventories.
4. In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for USA
and Japan.

aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates. Tables
49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area "adjusted" balances.
Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area vis-à-vis third countries
should be identical to the sum of the balances of the individual countries
in the EU or the euro area. However, intra-EU or intra-euro-area balances
are non-zero because of reporting errors. The creation of the internal
market in 1993 reduced border controls and formalities, and accordingly
the scope and precision of intra-EU trade coverage. Typically, intra-EU
imports are underestimated compared to intra-EU exports, leading to an
overestimation of the surplus. For the past the "adjusted" balances are
Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB estimates for the euro area. For the
future, they are ECFIN's forecasts based on the extrapolation of the
discrepancies observed in 2017.

9. Geographical zones are defined as follows :
Euro area :
EA19 (BE, DE, EE, IE, EL, ES, FR, IT, CY, LV, LT, LU, MT, NL, AT, PT, SI,
SK and FI).
European Union :

5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential output
as estimated via a production function, where the increase in the capital
stock and the difference between actual unemployment and the
NAWRU play a key role.
6. Employment data used in tables 23-29 and 32-33 are based on full-timeequivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain, France, Italy, and
the Netherlands report FTE data. In the absence of FTE data, employment
is based on numbers of persons. In the calculation of EU and euro-area
aggregates, priority is given to FTE data, as this is regarded as more
representative of diverse patterns of working time.

EU28 (EA19, BG, CZ, DK, HR, HU, PL, RO, SE and UK).
EU27 (EU28 excluding UK).
Candidate countries :
Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Montenegro, Serbia, and Albania.
Potential candidates :
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Advanced economies :
EU, candidate countries, USA, Canada, Japan, Korea, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland,
Australia and New Zealand.
MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :
Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq,
Iran, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait, and Qatar.
Emerging and Developing asia :

7. Source: National Accounts (ESA 2010), except for US current-account in
tables 50, 52, and 61 (Balance of Payments). Discrepancies with balance
of payments statistics may arise due to methodological differences and
revision schedules.
8. EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates. World
GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS). In the tables
on world trade and international payments, the

All countries in that region except the ones included in the
Advanced economies and the Asian MENA countries.
Latin America :
All countries in that region.
Sub-Saharan Africa :
All countries in that region except the African MENA countries.
