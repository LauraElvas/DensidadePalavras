viEconomic activity continued to expand in the ˜rst half of 2018, albeit at a slower-than-expected pace, 
mainly in advanced Europe. Domestic demand, supported by stronger employment and wages, remains 
the main engine of growth. However, the external environment has become less supportive and is 
expected to soften further in 2019 owing to slowing global demand, trade tensions, and higher energy 
prices. Tighter ˜nancial conditions in vulnerable emerging market economies and maturing business 
cycles are also weighing on activity. Accordingly, growth is projected to moderate from 2.8 percent in 
2017 to 2.3 percent in 2018 and 1.9 percent in 2019. ˚at said, it is expected to remain above potential 
in most countries in the region. 
Risks to the outlook have increased. In the short term, escalating trade tensions and a sharp tightening 
in global ˜nancial conditions could undermine investment and weigh on growth. In the medium 
term, risks stem from delayed ˜scal adjustment and structural reforms, demographic challenges, rising 
inequality, and declining trust in mainstream policies. Also, a ﬁno-dealﬂ Brexit would lead to high trade 
and non-trade barriers between the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union with negative 
consequences for growth.
Policymakers should seize the opportunity o˛ered by continued above-potential growth to implement 
structural reforms and rebuild room for ˜scal policy. Countries with signi˜cant vulnerabilities should 
seek to reduce high levels of public debt and rebuild ˜scal bu˛ers to ensure they have policy space to 
cope with future shocks. In contrast, countries with ample ˜scal space and stronger-than-warranted 
external positions should raise public investment to lift the potential of their economies and promote 
external rebalancing. 
Monetary policy priorities di˛er across countries. In emerging Europe, where in˝ation pressure is 
generally building, central banks should gradually normalize monetary policy in a well-communicated 
manner to ensure a smooth adjustment. In advanced European economies, where underlying in˝ation 
pressures are generally subdued, monetary policy should remain supportive to ensure durable increases 
in in˝ation toward targets. Structural and ˜nancial sector reform priorities remain unchanged from 
those discussed in previous 
Regional Economic Outlook
 reports for Europe.
Well-targeted macroprudential policies can be useful in addressing speci˜c ˜nancial stability risks. As 
discussed in Chapter 2, such policies have mainly aimed at building ˜nancial resilience, containing 
house price increases and credit growth. ˚e analysis suggests that borrower-side measures, supported 
by lender-side measures, helped reduce the share of riskier mortgages, thereby contributing to improved 
˜nancial resilience. Evidence is more mixed when it comes to the ability of macroprudential policies 
to contain house price and overall credit growth in the context of monetary policy that remains 
accommodative.
Executive Summary

Activity
 continued to expand in the ˜rst half of 2018, but at a slower-than-expected pace, mainly 
in advanced Europe. ˚e external environment 
has become less supportive, with slowing global 
demand, escalating trade disputes, and higher fuel prices. Tighter ˜nancial conditions in vulnerable 
emerging market economies and maturing 
business cycles act as additional headwinds. With 
weakening forward-looking indicators, growth 
is now projected to slow from 2.8˛percent in 
2017 to 2.3˛percent in 2018 and 1.9˛percent 
in 2019, down from respective projections of 
2.6˛percent and 2.2˛percent in the May 2018 
Regional Economic Outlook: Europe
. Near-term 
risks to the outlook have shifted to the downside. 
As growth is expected to continue to exceed 
potential, policymakers should continue to focus on structural reforms and rebuilding policy bu˝ers 
to prepare for the next downturn.
The Pace of Economic 
Expansion Has Slowed in Many European Economies
Europe has seen strong growth over the past 
couple of years, as many downside risks have 
not materialized. On the back of supportive 
macroeconomic policies, economic activity 
continued to expand in the ˜rst half of 2018, driven by domestic demand. However, there are 
signs of softening in Romania, Turkey, and the 
United Kingdom. Also, in the euro area, GDP 
growth cooled further to 0.2 percent in the third 
quarter (quarter-on-quarter, annual rate), from 
0.4 percent in each of the ˜rst two quarters. ˚e 
˚is chapter was prepared by a sta˝ team composed of Vizhdan 
Boranova, Kamil Dybczak, and Sylwia Nowak, with input from 
Raju Huidrom and Nemanja Jovanovic. ˚e team was led by Emil 
Stavrev under the general guidance of Jörg Decressin. Laura Papi 
provided useful advice and comments. Nomelie Veluz provided 
administrative support. ˚e chapter re˙ects data and developments as 
of October 15, 2018.
deceleration was mainly due to weaker external 
demand (especially for goods), special factors (inclement weather, car production), and base 
e˝ects in the ˜rst quarter of 2018. In most 
Central, Eastern, and Southeastern European 
(CESEE) countries, the expansion remained 
robust thanks to a higher absorption of EU funds 
and strong private consumption growth on the 
back of increasingly tight labor markets. Nordic 
and Baltic economies, the Czech Republic, and 
Switzerland also continued to perform well. With 
most con˜dence indicators down to pre-2017 
levels (Figure˛1.1), forward-looking indicators 
suggest moderation of growth. Only a few 
indicators hint at stronger growth in the second 
half of 2018.Euro area: new orders PMI(deviations from 50, right side)Advanced Europe: economic sentimentsEmerging Europe: economic sentimentsŒ6Œ4Œ2024Œ3Œ2Œ10123456786810121416Jan. 2014Jul. 15Jan. 17Sep. 18Sources: Haver Analytics; IMF, World Economic Outlook; and IMF staff calculations.Note: PMI = purchasing managers™ index.Figure 1.1.

Several Headwinds Are at Play˚e external environment has become less 
supportive. European exporters enjoyed 
exceptionally strong export growth in the fourth 
quarter of 2017. Global imports of European 
goods and services grew by 7.5˛percent in 2017, 
up from 3˛percent a year earlier. However, foreign 
demand for European exports moderated in 
2018 and is expected to remain soft in 2019 
(Figure˛1.2). In the 
euro area
, the slowdown of 
exports is driven by intermediate and capital 
goods, which account for two-thirds of goods 
exports from the 
euro area
 to the rest of the world. 
Also, some of the slowdown in the third quarter 
re˙ects lower car production, notably in Germany, 
as carmakers adapt to comply with new pollution 
tests. Trade tensions are another factor. ˚us far, 
the direct impact of already-implemented US 
tari˝s on steel and aluminum has been limited, given low exports of these items from Europe to 
the United States,
 but there are concerns that they 
could weigh appreciably on growth ahead (see 
risks below).
Higher energy prices have dampened real incomes 
in most of Europe. Commodity prices have 
increased 7˛percent since the spring of 2018, as 
oil prices climbed to $79 a barrel in September, 
the highest level since 2014. ˚is increase in fuel 
prices has lifted headline in˙ation by an average 
of about ½˛percentage point across Europe. For 
Norway
 and Russia
, the terms-of-trade windfall gains are estimated at about 1.5˛percent of GDP 
each year (Figure˛1.3). In the rest of Europe, 
higher fuel prices have dampened real disposable 
incomes by up to 0.7˛percentage point of GDP, a 
worsening of about a third of a percentage point 
of GDP compared with the April 2018 
World 
Economic Outlook
 estimates. In the 
newer EU 
member states, the impact of higher energy prices has been o˝set by the increased absorption of EU 
funds and strong wage growth. ˚e increase in 
fuel prices is also expected to further strengthen 
current account surpluses for oil exporters.
Additional headwinds come from maturing 
business cycles. Output gaps are estimated to be 
mostly closed or positive. Production capacity

constraints and labor shortages are becoming 
more binding, mostly in 
emerging Europe
, but also in selected advanced European economies 
(Figure˛1.4). Accordingly, in several 
CESEE countries, these tight labor market conditions 
have translated into continued fast wage growth, 
exceeding 10˛percent annually in the ˜rst half 
of 2018. Wage growth has also moved upward 
in the euro area
, but much more slowly than in 
the CESEE countries, consistent with a ˙atter wage Phillips curve as discussed in the May 2018 
Regional Economic Outlook: Europe
. ˚e current 
manufacturing expansion is one of the longest in the past two decades (Figure˛1.5). Bank credit to 
the private sector is growing at moderate rates, 
but there are signs of asset price overvaluations in 
selected markets, especially in housing markets 
(for example, the Czech Republic
 and some of the Nordics;
 see Chapter˛2). Policy rates have been adjusted upward in some 
economies to o˝set the potential in˙ationary 
impact of the exchange rate depreciation (
Turkey
, Russia
) and high wage growth (
Czech Republic, 
Romania
). Yet in most countries core in˙ation 
has remained low for now, with the notable 
exception of 
Turkey
.Financial conditions have tightened somewhat, 
especially in vulnerable countries. Financial 
conditions remain accommodative in 
advanced 
Europe
 and tightened only moderately in most of emerging Europe 
due to higher interest rates 
in the United States 
and the appreciation of the 
US dollar. However, in 
Turkey,
 concerns over 
economic policy credibility and geopolitical 
tensions have, alongside a worsening of 
sentiment toward emerging markets, led to a 
sharp lira depreciation by about 40˛percent since 
the beginning of the year
. In 
Italy
, sovereign 
bond yields jumped to a four-year high due to 
diˆculties in forming a government and policy 
uncertainties. So far, spillovers to other markets 
have been fairly contained, but there is appreciable 
uncertainty, and contagion from future stress 
could be notable, especially for economies with weaker macroeconomic fundamentals and limited 
policy bu˝ers.Advanced EU: capacity utilization (deviation from mean)Emerging EU: capacity utilization (deviation from mean)Advanced EU: labor shortages (right scale)Emerging EU: labor shortages (right scale)Œ12Œ8Œ4048010203040502007:Q109:Q111:Q113:Q115:Q117:Q118:Q3Sources: European Commission, Quarterly Business and Consumer Survey; Haver Analytics; IMF, World Economic Outlook; and IMF staff calculations.1Percent balance equals percent of respondents reporting an increase minus the percent of respondents reporting a decrease.

Outlook: Slower but above 
Potential Growth with 
Increased Downside RisksReal GDP growth in Europe is expected to 
moderate from 2.8˛percent in 2017 to 2.3˛percent 
in 2018 and 1.9˛percent in 2019 (Figure˛1.6, 
panel 1; Table˛1.1), but to remain above potential 
in most countries in the region. Domestic demand 
will continue to be the main engine of growth, 
supported by rising employment and wages. 
Growth has been revised downward in about 
half of the countries compared with projections 
in the May 2018 
Regional Economic Outlook: 
Europe
. ˚e downward revisions re˙ect mainly 
weaker external demand and higher energy prices 
(Figure˛1.6, panel 2). In 
advanced Europe,
 growth 
is revised down by 0.3˛percentage point in 2018 
and 0.1˛percentage points in 2019, compared 
with the previous forecast. ˚e downward revision 
to Germany™s
 growth in 2018 is particularly large 
at 0.6˛percentage point, re˙ecting disappointing 
exports and historical revisions. In 
emerging European countries excluding Turkey,
 growth 
projections are unchanged in 2018 and are 
revised up by 0.2˛percentage point in both 2019 
and 2020. Macedonia,
 Romania,
 and Turkey
 saw large downgrades of about 1˛percentage point 
each in 2018. In 
Turkey
, growth is expected to 
weaken further from 3.5˛percent in 2018 to only 
0.4˛percent in 2019 before recovering in 2020, 
as the weaker lira, higher borrowing costs, and 
elevated uncertainties weigh on investment and 
demand. Headline in˙ation is expected to increase across 
European countries on the back of higher 
energy prices and positive output gaps. In 
advanced Europe, 
in˙ation has been revised up by 
0.1˛percentage point in both 2018 and 2019 to 
1.8˛percent. In 
emerging Europe
, the revisions have 
been much larger, at 0.8˛percentage point in 2018 
and 2˛percentage points in 2019. ˚e new forecast 
primarily re˙ects the worsened in˙ation outlook 
for Turkey
, due to sizable pass-through from the 
lira depreciation, higher energy prices, high wage 
growth, and unanchored in˙ation expectations. 
In 2019, the IMF sta˝ also expects a pickup in 
in˙ation in Russia

increase in the main value-added-tax rate and 
additional debt-˜nanced infrastructure spending.
˚e balance of risks is tilted to the downside 
both in the short term and beyond. Escalating 
trade tensions and the potential shift away from 
a multilateral, rules-based trading system could 
disrupt supply chains, with a signi˜cant impact 
on growth, notably if con˜dence is a˝ected, as 
illustrated by market jitters over potential US 
tari˝s on car imports. As discussed in Scenario 
Box˛1 in the October 2018 
World Economic 
Outlook,
 escalating trade tensions could impact global economic activity through a˛combination 
of higher trade costs, lower business con˜dence, 
weaker private sector investment, and tighter 
˜nancial conditions. Given Europe™s trade 
openness and deep integration into global value chains (Figure˛1.7), an intensi˜cation of 
trade tensions could have a signi˜cant impact, 
especially if accompanied by tighter ˜nancial 
conditions.1 A sharp tightening in global ˜nancial conditions would expose existing vulnerabilities, 1IMF sta˝ estimates suggest that an increase in trade policy 
uncertainty could appreciably reduce investment in the euro area, 
with a higher impact on countries more deeply integrated into global 
value chains (Ebeke and Siminitz, forthcoming).
dent con˜dence, and weigh on investment and 
growth. Separately, the possibility of a ﬁno-dealﬂ 
Brexit raises the risk of a disruptive exit and of 
high trade and nontrade barriers between the 
United Kingdom
 and the rest of the European 
Union (IMF 2018). In the medium-term, risks 
stem from the possibility of shifts in policy 
agendas and the implementation of politically popular but unsustainable macroeconomic 
policies, delays of structural reforms, demographic 
challenges, rising inequality, and declining trust in 
mainstream policies. 
Policy Priorities
˚e policy stance should be tailored to the 
maturing cyclical positions. ˚e procyclical ˜scal 
stance, prevailing in many European countries, 
should be scaled back. Policymakers should seize 
the opportunity of above-potential growth and low 
unemployment to advance growth-friendly policies 
to reduce high levels of public debt and rebuild 
˜scal bu˝ers to facilitate coping with future 
shocks. Countries should prioritize measures that 
reduce ˜scal de˜cits toward their medium-term 
targets and lower debt. ˚e urgency is greater in

countries with signi˜cant vulnerabilities, such as Italy
 and Turkey
. In contrast, countries with ample 
˜scal space and stronger-than-warranted external 
positions (Germany, Netherlands
) should use available space to raise potential output through 
more public investment and promote external 
rebalancing.
Monetary policy priorities di˝er across countries. 
As core in˙ation has picked up and headline 
in˙ation has reached or is approaching targets 
in emerging Europe
, central banks should gradually normalize monetary policy in a 
well-communicated manner to ensure a smooth 
adjustment. In countries where underlying 
in˙ation pressures remain subdued (mostly 
advanced Europe
) monetary policy should remain 
supportive to ensure durable increases in in˙ation 
toward targets. In the
 euro area
, as asset purchases 
come to an end, forward guidance on interest rates 
becomes more important in order to keep policy 
rates at their current, extraordinarily low levels at 
least through next summer.
Regarding ˜nancial sector policies, targeted 
macroprudential measures can be particularly 
useful in addressing speci˜c ˜nancial stability 
risks. As discussed in Chapter˛2, borrower-based 
measures can be e˝ective in containing the 
share of high-risk loans. Also, further progress is 
needed in cleaning bank balance sheets, including continued reduction in nonperforming loans. 
In the 
euro area
, the increased debt in corporate 
balance sheets warrants close monitoring, especially among lower-rated companies.
As capacity constraints are becoming more 
binding on the back of weaker productivity 
growth, countries are urged even more than 
before to implement policies to boost labor force 
participation and foster higher potential growth. 
Structural reform priorities remain unchanged 
(May 2018 
Regional Economic Outlook: Europe
). In 
advanced Europe
, countries should introduce 
further reforms of labor and product markets to 
boost competitiveness and improve productivity at 
the national level. In 
emerging Europe
, enhancing institutions (November 2017 
Regional Economic 
Outlook: Europe
), improving the investment 
environment and boosting labor participation 
by women and the elderly remain top policy 
priorities. In 
Russia
, further steps should be 
taken to continue to improve the investment 
climate, boost infrastructure investment and 
human capital, and improve the eˆciency of 
goods markets.
To help increase the 
euro area™s
 resilience to 
future shocks, architectural reforms should 
be implemented to further reduce risks and 
improve risk sharing. Completing the banking 
union, with common rules and backstops, and 
advancing the capital markets union would 
support private cross-border risk diversi˜cation. 
Equally important is the pressing need for ˜scal 
institutional reforms. A˛central ˜scal capacity 
that supports macroeconomic stabilization, and 
that embeds strong safeguards against permanent 
transfers and moral hazard, should be developed 
in conjunction with a revamping of ˜scal rules to 
make them simpler and easier to enforce. While 
all likely Brexit outcomes will entail costs, an 
agreement that minimizes the introduction of new 
tari˝ and nontari˝ barriers would best protect 
growth and income in the 
United Kingdom 
and the EU. Separately, the 
European Union
 and its partners should work together constructively to 
reduce trade barriers and, whenever possible, to 
resolve disagreements through the World Trade 
Organization.

˜is chapter documents the increasing use of 
macroprudential policies (MaPPs) in Europe in 
recent years to build ˚nancial resilience, contain 
general and sectoral credit growth, and limit 
house price increases. Considering these objectives 
and drawing from case studies, the chapter ˚nds 
evidence that borrower-side measures, supported 
by lender-side measures, helped limit the share 
of riskier mortgages, thereby building resilience. 
Evidence is more mixed as to the ability of MaPPs 
to contain house price and overall credit growth 
against the backdrop of a still-accommodative 
monetary policy and other factors.
Macroprudential Measures in European Countries˜e recent reacceleration in house prices has 
prompted the adoption of MaPPs in several 
European countries. ˜ough credit and house 
price concerns are not yet generalized, house prices 
have increased substantially in several European 
countries over the past few years (Figure˛2.1).
1,2 In most of these countries, higher house prices 
have been accompanied by rising household debt 
(Figure˛2.2) and rapid household credit growth 
(Figure˛2.3). 
To contain the buildup of systemic risks, 
especially in the residential housing market, 
many European countries have strengthened their

guidance of Jörg Decressin and Enrica Detragiache. Laura Papi pro

Égert and Mihaljek (2007), Kholodilin and Ulbricht (2015), and 
Geng (2018).
MaPPs (Figure˛2.4). While MaPPs have been 
implemented across Europe, countries with larger 
postcrisis increases in house prices and household 
debt tended to adopt more MaPPs (Figures 
2.5, 2.6). ˜e main objectives of the recently introduced 
MaPPs, as stated by country authorities, were 
improving ˚nancial stability, building ˚nancial 
resilience, and containing general and sectoral 
credit growth. Within these broader objectives, 
policies were generally focused on protecting 
borrowers, strengthening banking systems, and 
slowing down house price increases (Figure˛2.7). 
˜e latter was an objective in most economies, 
but particularly in the 
Czech Republic, Estonia, 
Norway
, and Sweden
.In some countries (
Estonia, Norway, Switzerland
), the relaxation of lending standards was a major 
concern. Constraining the rise in the share of loans 
denominated in foreign currency was a prominent 
goal in Hungary
. ˜e various capital bu˝ers 
adopted beginning in 2013, in line with the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV), were 
aimed at containing not only housing sector imbalances, but also credit cycle swings.
Re˙ecting these objectives, various 
macroprudential measures, with di˝erent design 
and calibration, were implemented across 
countries (Figure˛2.8): 
Ł Loan-to-value (LTV) caps. In response to 
the fast growth of mortgage lending, several 
countries introduced LTV caps ranging from 
35˛to 100˛percent, but mostly between 60 and 
95˛percent. Caps are often di˝erentiated, with 
less binding ceilings on primary residences 
(Cyprus
), for ˚rst-time buyers (
Finland
, Ireland
), or for mortgages with collateral, 
guarantees, or insurance (Estonia
, Latvia, Poland, Romania
). Mortgages in foreign 
currencies (
Hungary, Poland, Romania
) or for nonprimary residences in the capital city

(Norway
) are subject to more stringent caps. 
Since their initial adoption, LTV caps have 
been tightened in several countries (
Czech 
Republic, Netherlands,
 Norway, Poland, the 
Slovak Republic
).Ł Debt-to-income (DTI)/loan-to-income 
(LTI) and debt service-to-income (DSTI) 
caps. To contain potential vulnerabilities in 
households™ balance sheets, many countries 
have introduced either DTI/LTI or DSTI 
caps (the Slovak Republic
 adopted both LTI 
and DSTI caps). DSTI caps vary by borrower 
income level (
Czech Republic
, Hungary
, Poland
, Portugal
, the Slovak Republic
, Slovenia
), currency of denomination (
Cyprus
 and Hungary
), LTV level (
Lithuania
), or interest ˚xing period/debt service frequency 
(Hungary
 and Slovak Republic
). Romania™s
 DSTI caps are determined by scenario analysis 
that considers currency, interest rate, and 
income risks. In the 
Czech
 Republic
, Ireland
, Norway
, the Slovak Republic
, the DTI/LTI 
caps were introduced as a complement to LTV 
caps. In the 
United
 Kingdom, only LTI caps 
have been implemented.
Ł Capital Requirements. So far, half of the 
EU countries have adopted the full Basel 
III capital conservation bu˝er (CB) of 
2.5˛percent of risk-weighted assets, while 
others are phasing it in gradually. All countries 
have introduced the countercyclical capital 
bu˝er (CCB), but only the Czech
 Republic, 
France, Iceland, Norway
, the Slovak Republic, 
Sweden, Switzerland
, and the United
 Kingdom have nonzero bu˝ers. A total of 13˛countries 
have adopted the systemic risk bu˝er (SRB).
3 Some countries have also imposed sectoral 
risk-weight ˙oors on commercial real 
estate (Croatia
, Finland
, Ireland
, Norway
, Romania
, Sweden
) and residential mortgages 
(Belgium
, Croatia
, Norway
, Slovenia
, Sweden
). Among this group, 
Norway
 and 3In July 2017, Hungary introduced a systemic risk bu˝er for 
banks with large portfolios of nonperforming commercial real estate 
loans. At the end of 2017, only two banks were a˝ected, and cur
-rently only one bank is subject to this charge. ˜e initiative had been 
announced to give banks time to reduce their exposure.

What We Learned from 
Country Experiences˜oroughly assessing the e˝ectiveness of MaPPs 
is challenging. A simple before-after comparison 
suggests that the introduction of borrower-based 
MaPPs, supported by lender-based measures, 
in˙uenced the dimensions directly targeted by the 
measures, while their impact on house prices and 
overall credit growth was mixed. ˜at said, a more 
conclusive evaluation of the e˝ects of these policies 
has to await the completion of a full economic and ˚nancial cycle. In addition, country experiences 
indicate that circumvention needs to be addressed.
In this section, we draw on eight case studies 
to assess the MaPPs™ e˝ectiveness by analyzing 
the evolution of the speci˚c target variables 
these measures were meant to a˝ect, as well 
as the dynamics of house prices and credit. 
Analysis of the relative e˝ectiveness of di˝erent 
macroprudential instruments/measures is beyond 
the scope of this chapter.

The ratios were 5 percentage points higher on loans for residential leasing. The LTV caps on retail mortgage loans have since been adjusted to, respectively 80 percent, 50 percent, and 35 percent. Regarding ˜nancial leases, 5 percentage points higher LTV limits can be applied.After limits on LTV ratios were imposed, the share of mortgage loans with LTVs exceeding these limits has decreased in the Czech Republic, Israel, Norway, Slovak Republic, Sweden, and Switzerland.14REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EURO

Impact on Riskier MortgagesMacroprudential measures had some e˝ects on 
reducing high-LTV mortgage loans to households 
(Figure˛2.9):
4Ł Czech Republic.
 Macroprudential measures 
included lender-based measures (CB at 
2.5˛percent, CCB at 1˛percent, and SRB 
ranging within 1 to 3˛percent) in place since 
2014, as well as a tightening of the maximum 
recommended LTV ratio in the second 
quarter of 2017. ˜eir implementation was 
followed by a clear decline in the share of new 
mortgages with LTVs above 80˛percent and an 
increase in those with an LTV between 70 and 
80˛percent. ˜is outcome, however, should 
be assessed carefully as it may have been 
partly o˝set by a more favorable valuation 
of collateral. Meanwhile, debt-servicing 
and loan-to-income ratios did not show a 
meaningful improvement over the period.
Ł Denmark.
 Restrictions on the borrowing 
capacity of households relative to their 
disposable income and their interest rate 
sensitivity have been in e˝ect since 2014. A 
consumer protection clause was introduced 
in 2015 mandating at least a 5˛percent 
down payment for residential real estate 
purchases, translating into a 95˛percent 
maximum LTV. After these measures, the 
share of new borrowers with LTV above 
95˛percent declined markedly, while the 
share of borrowers with LTV between 80 
and 90˛percent declined slightly. ˜ese 
measures were supplemented by guidelines 
on good business practices for housing credit 
(2017), which helped increase the resilience 
of borrowers, for instance by promoting a 
higher share of ˚xed-rate mortgages, and by 
limiting excessive leverage by households with 
lower incomes.
Ł Hungary. 
Since the global ˚nancial crisis, the 
authorities have been implementing a variety 
of borrower-based MaPPs. In March 2010, 
4˜e de˚nitions of LTV, DTI, and DSTI vary widely within the 
European Union.
75/60/45˛percent maximum LTV ratios were 
adopted for mortgage loans denominated in, 
respectively, local currency, euros, and other 
currencies. In early November 2014, the 
central bank and the banks™ association agreed 
on a fast and orderly conversion of foreign 
exchange mortgage loans to local currency, 
in order to reduce the exposure of household 
balance sheet to exchange rate risk. Beginning 
in 2015, the maximum LTV ratios were, 
respectively, 80, 50,˛and 35˛percent and were 
complemented with payment-to-income ratios (PTIs, akin to DSTIs). For borrowers with a 
net monthly income below Ft 400,000 (about 
•1,250), the PTI ratios are 50/25/10˛percent. 
For borrowers with a higher income, the ratios 
are 60/30/15˛percent. E˝ective October 2018, 
and to be further tightened beginning in July 
2019, the PTI ratios have been modi˚ed 
to encourage longer interest rate ˚xing 
periods.˛In April 2017, the mortgage funding 
adequacy ratio was introduced to ensure stable 
long-term funding for long-term mortgage 
lending. ˜e above measuresŠtogether with 
the central bank certi˚ed consumer-friendly 
housing loans introduced in 2017Šhave 
likely helped the quality and sustainability of housing loans. ˜e share of new housing 
loans with an LTV ratio over 70˛percent more 
than halved, to about 30˛percent in the ˚rst 
half of 2017, compared with 2009. Also, the 
authorities™ assessment is that ﬁthe regulations 
contribute to preventing excessive household 
indebtedness and to mitigating banks™ future 
lossesﬂ (MNB 2017, page 11).
Ł Norway
. In response to high house 
prices and growing household debt, the 
authorities implemented higher capital and liquidity requirements (CB, CCB, SRB, 
domestically systemic important institutions 
[D-SIISs]), leverage ratios in 2013Œ17, and 
borrower-based measures targeted to the 
mortgage market (LTV limit, DTI limit, 
amortization requirements). Following the 
implementation of the LTV cap, the share of 
new loans with an LTV ratio above 85˛percent 
has declined. ˜e DTI measure that went

into e˝ect at beginning of 2017 also led to a decline of about 7˛percentage points in the 
share of new mortgages with a DTI cap of 
more than 500˛percent in 2016. ˜is share 
was 2˛percent in 2017.
Ł Israel
. Measures included LTV caps adopted 
in November 2012 (75˛percent for ˚rst-time 
buyers and 50˛percent for mortgages for 
investment properties) and an increase in 
risk weights adopted in March 2013 (to 
50˛percent for those with an LTV ratio of 
45Œ60˛percent, and to 75˛percent for those 
with an LTV ratio above 60˛percent). ˜e 
measures appear to have been e˝ective, as the 
proportion of new mortgages with an LTV of 
more than 75˛percent declined from 6˛percent 
in October 2012 to 0.5˛percent by February 
2014, and the proportion of mortgages with 
an LTV between 60 and 75˛percent also 
declined modestly. A signi˚cant drop in the 
latter in 2016 likely related to new regulatory 
requirements fully implemented in 2015 
and to ˚scal measures that aim to discourage 
investor demand.
Ł ˜e Slovak Republic
. Several MaPPs have 
been introduced to contain increasing 
household indebtedness, high concentration of residential mortgages in bank portfolios, 
and rapidly growing house prices. LTV 
measures implemented in 2014 and the 
recent decision to set the CCB to 0.5˛percent 
have helped to improve lending standards 
and credit quality. Speci˚cally, the share of 
new loans with an LTV ratio of more than 
90˛percent fell to below 20˛percent by the 
second quarter of 2015 and continued to 
decline to 6.3˛percent by the third quarter of 
2016. ˜e proportion of new mortgages with 
an LTV ratio of 80 to 90˛percent initially 
increased but has since come down noticeably.
Ł Sweden
. To counteract unhealthy lending 
practices and strengthen consumer protection, 
the authorities introduced a mortgage cap 
in 2010, mandating that new mortgage 
loans not exceed 85˛percent of the value 
of the home. ˜e share of high-LTV 
mortgages declined after these measures. In 
addition, a study by the authorities using 
a di˝erence-in-di˝erences approach found 
that households limited by the mortgage cap 
borrowed approximately 13˛percent less and 
purchased homes that were approximately 
10˛percent less expensive than they would 
have otherwise (Finansinspektionen 2017). 
˜e mortgage cap has had the greatest e˝ect 
outside the metropolitan regions.
Ł Switzerland
. Facing strong and prolonged 
growth in house prices, risk weights were 
raised for the part of a residential mortgage 
in excess of an 80˛percent LTV ratio at the 
beginning of 2013. ˜e proportion of new 
mortgages with an LTV ratio higher than 
80˛percent declined by about 5˛percentage 
points in 2013. In addition, 
Switzerland
 was the ˚rst country in Europe to activate the 
CCB in 2013, targeting mortgage-backed 
positions secured by residential property. 
˜e bu˝er was set at 1˛percent initially 
and raised to 2˛percent in 2014. Following 
these measures, capital-constrained or 
mortgage-intensive banks raised their 
mortgage rates, and as a result, new mortgage 
loans were shifted to better-capitalized and 
less-mortgage-intensive institutions.
Impact on House Prices and Credit GrowthOur assessment, however, provides a more 
mixed picture of the impact of macroprudential 
measures on house prices and overall credit growth 
(Figure˛2.10). In some countries (for example 
Denmark
), house price growth on a national 
level was not accompanied by rapid growth 
in bank credit. ˜us, measures that targeted 
mortgage credit were not likely to a˝ect house 
price dynamics in these countries. In addition, 
circumvention may have played a role in some 
cases (see next section). In 
Switzerland
, following several macroprudential 
measures, real estate price growth and the pace 
of mortgage lending have gradually eased. In

Among other factors, measures in 2014Œ15 may have contributed in moderating credit growth.Growth rate of house prices has decelerated since late 2016, re˜ecting changes in the regulatory requirements since 2015 and some ˚scal measures ...... while the impact of measures in the Slovak Republic on credit growth seems to have been limited.Sweden™s amortization requirement measures seem to have dampened house prices at least initially, but other factors such as prospects for increased housing supply may have also played a role.MaPPs have had a lasting moderating effect on the level of household debt, but only a transitory impact on the level of house prices in Switzerland.House price growth in Hungary appears to have stabilized, following the measures.Dec. 2005Dec. 07Dec. 09Dec. 11Dec. 13Dec. 15Dec. 172012:Q113:Q114:Q115:Q116:Q117:Q118:Q1Œ20Œ15Œ10Œ5051015202530Œ30Œ25Œ20Œ15Œ10Œ5051015202010:Q111:Q112:Q113:Q114:Q115:Q116:Q117:Q12010:Q111:Q112:Q113:Q114:Q115:Q116:Q117:Q118:Q1Œ505101520Œ10Œ505101520Dec.2013June14Dec.14June15Dec.15June16Dec.16June17Dec.172008:Q110:Q112:Q114:Q116:Q118:Q15.05.25.45.65.8Œ4Œ202468172.

contrast, house prices in the Czech
 Republic
, Hungary
, and the Slovak Republic
 continued to grow rapidly after macroprudential measures 
were introduced, though the measures may have 
helped to contain faster increases. In 
Israel
, credit 
to households continued to rise gradually relative 
to GDP, even as MaPP succeeded in reducing 
the share of risky loans. House pricesŠwhich 
were not a MaPP target in this caseŠcontinued 
to rise, partly re˙ecting low interest rates and 
housing supply impediments. A deceleration in house prices observed since late 2016 re˙ects 
a combination of proposed ˚scal measures to 
discourage investor demand, a rise in mortgage 
interest rates linked to capital surcharges on 
mortgage lending, and market uncertainty 
associated with the Buyer™s Price program. In 
Norway
, the impact on house prices appears to have been only transitory. ˜is is also in line 
with the recent experience of 
Sweden
, where 
amortization requirements and LTV requirements 
curbed credit growth, but had less of an impact on 
house prices. Amortization requirement measures 
seem to have dampened house prices at least 
initially, but other factors, such as prospects for 
increased housing supply, may have also played 
some role.
5While a simple before-after analysis shows that 
in a number of cases house prices and credit 
growth trends did not appear to change after 
the implementation of MaPP measures, a 
deeper assessment using counterfactual analysis 
indicates that macroprudential measures may 
have contributed to contain household credit 
and house price growth in 
Norway
 and Sweden
 (Box˛2.1), although counterfactual paths are 
imprecisely estimated.
Further Considerations for Effectiveness: Circumvention and Interaction with Other Policies˜ere is evidence that macroprudential measures 
were partly circumvented by nonbank ˚nancing 
5Næss-Schmidt and others (2017).
and other avenues in some countries.
 For instance 
Dimova, Kongsamut, and Vandenbussche (2016) 
show that some measures imposed on banks in 
Bulgaria
 and Romania
 to contain credit growth 
before the global ˚nancial crisis were partly 
circumvented through loan booking with nonbank 
˚nancial institutions.More recently, in 
Switzerland
, mortgage loans by 
pension funds and insurance companies, albeit small, are growing faster than bank mortgage 
loans, warranting careful monitoring. In the 
Czech
 Republic
, consumer credit may have substituted for 
mortgages. Fortunately, jurisdictions are seeking 
to broaden the application of MaPPs to avoid 
circumvention. Recently, 
Iceland
 introduced a 
binding LTV for new mortgage loans applicable to 
all institutions providing mortgages (July 2017). 
˜e Slovak Republic
 also introduced binding 
limits on the DSTI ratio (80˛percent) and on 
the maturity (eight years) for new consumer 
loans, which apply to all providers, whether 
domestic or foreign.
Cross-border loans have also been an avenue 
for circumvention.
6 For instance, 
Estonia
 implemented several macroprudential measures 
in the mid-2000s during the ˚nancial upswing, which are believed to have been less e˝ective due 
to cross-border circumvention (Kang and others 
2017; and Sutt, Korju, and Siibak 2011). ˜is led 
to the creation of networks among the authorities 
in the region to, among other objectives, counter 
circumvention (for example the Nordic-Baltic 
Macroprudential Forum [Farelius and Billborn 
2016]). Currently, within the countries that 
belong to the European Systemic Risk Board 
(ESRB) there is a framework to ensure that 
the macroprudential instruments envisioned 
under the European CRR/CRD IV directive 
are reciprocated, and indeed reciprocation 
6Kang and others (2017) ˚nd evidence of cross-border circum
-vention in European countries. Also, Cerutti, Claessens, and Laeven 
(2015), Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey (2015), Reinhardt and 
Sowerbutts (2015), and Buch and Goldberg (2017) broadly ˚nd that 
macroprudential tightening is associated with lower domestic credit 
but often with higher cross-border borrowing. Choi, Kodres, and 
Lu (2018) document unintended consequences of macroprudential 
measures in a cross-country setup.

has occurred in several instances.
7,8 However, 
reciprocity of other instruments, including LTV 
and DTI limits, remains voluntary.
Supplementing MaPPs with other policies could 
also help their e˝ectiveness. MaPPs have a stronger 
e˝ect when reinforced by monetary policy 
(Gambacorta and Murcia 2017), but monetary 
policy needs to target price stability. ˜erefore, 
it may not be always available to support MaPPs 
and, at times, may even operate in the opposite 
direction. Nonetheless, several policy instruments 
in addition to MaPPs a˝ect the housing market 
and have been used in the countries under study. 
For instance, in 
Hungary
, covered bond funding 
was restricted to low-LTV loans after the crisis to 
improve the stability of banks™ funding sources 
(IMF 2011). Similarly, the reduction in the scope 
of mortgage interest tax deductibility planned in 
Denmark
, Finland
, Netherlands
, and Sweden
 will help contain imbalances in the housing market.
9 Taxes on real estate ownership or transactions 
can be also used to pursue policy goals like those of MaPPs. For instance, in 
Israel
, a proposed tax 
on owners of more than two apartments likely 
resulted in a decline in housing transactions 
in 2017 (Baudot-Trajtenberg, Tzur-Ilan, and 
Frayberg 2018).
Conclusions and Policy LessonsWith monetary policy remaining accommodative 
in most countries and house prices on the rise, many European countries have stepped 
up the implementation of MaPPs. Among the 
7˜e ESRB goes beyond CRR/CRD IV to recommend the recip
-rocation of bu˝er rates higher than 2.5˛percent (ESRB 2018).
8In terms of implementation, 14 member states reciprocated the 
Estonian risk bu˝er in 2016. Nine member states reciprocated the 
Belgian national ˙exibility measure in 2016 (5˛percentage point 
risk weight add-on applied to Belgian mortgage loan exposures of 
credit institutions using the internal ratings based [IRB] approach). 
Also, in late 2017, the Finnish national ˙exibility measure (a 
credit-institution-speci˚c average risk weight ˙oor of 15˛percent 
for IRB banks, at the portfolio level, of residential mortgage loans 
secured by housing units in Finland) was recommended by the ESRB 
for reciprocation. See ESRB (2018).
9See IMF (2018a) for Denmark, IMF (2018b) for the Nether
-lands, and IMF (2017a) for Sweden, for discussions on mortgage 
interest deductibility.
most-used measures are borrower-side measures 
(LTVs, DTIs/LTIs, stepped-up amortization 
requirements) as well as bank capital requirements 
(countercyclical capital bu˝ers, systemic risk 
bu˝ers, systematically ˚nancial institution bu˝ers, ˙oors on risk weights). While some countries 
have introduced a comprehensive set of measures, 
potential leakages and circumvention seem to pose 
challenges, as even borrower-based measures are 
not always applied to all types of loans.˜ere is evidence that borrower-side measures, 
supported by lender-based measures, help limit the 
share of riskier mortgages, which makes economies 
more resilient. Speci˚cally, in most countries 
following the introduction of MaPPs, the growth 
of high-LTV mortgages slowed down, suggesting 
that the measures may have been helpful. But 
whether MaPPs can contain the formation of 
house price and credit bubbles as monetary 
policy remains accommodative is more diˆcult 
to establish. In some countries, household credit 
and house price growth slowed down following 
the introduction of borrower-based measures, but 
in other cases they did not. Implementation of 
MaPPs is recent, and most countries have not gone 
through a full economic and ˚nancial cycle, so a 
comprehensive evaluation of the e˝ects of these 
policies is still premature. Another open question 
is to what extent countries should rely on MaPPs 
rather than on complementary policy instruments 
(that is, tax policy, mortgage interest deductibility, 
zoning, construction, and planning restriction), 
which can also have strong e˝ects on the housing 
and credit markets. ˜e answer, presumably, 
should be a function of the speci˚c forces that are 
driving excessive lending and house price increases.

To assess the e˝ectiveness of macroprudential policy (MaPP) measures, counterfactual analysis is used to 
gauge the impact of MaPPs speci˚cally targeted at the housing market on containing household credit in 
Norway
 and Sweden
. Following Price (2014), we estimated the e˝ectiveness of these measures by projecting 
counterfactual growth rates of household credit and house prices using data from the ˚rst quarter of 2003 for 
Norway
 and from the ˚rst quarter of 1981 in the case of 
Sweden
. ˜e estimation proceeded in two steps. First, 
a vector autoregression model was estimated consisting of housing-speci˚c variables (household credit growth, 
house price growth, housing starts/completions, house sales) and macroeconomic variables (household income 
growth, output gap, net immigration rate, population growth, mortgage interest rate) using data prior to 
the implementation of the measures. Second, based on model predictions, the dynamics of housing-speci˚c 
variables were projected conditional on the actual behavior of macroeconomic variables in the periods after the 
measures became e˝ective.

˜e analysis suggests that household credit growth would have been higher without the measures, but 
statistical signi˚cance is borderline. Actual credit growth paths are found to remain below counterfactuals in 
both cases, with the di˝erence becoming statistically signi˚cant at the 95˛percent con˚dence level in 
Norway
 starting several quarters after the introduction of MaPPs. In 
Sweden
, actual credit growth is close toŠbut still 
withinŠthe lower bound of the con˚dence interval. Not surprisingly, MaPPs appear to a˝ect house prices and 
household credit with delays, so over time the mitigating impact may become larger. Turning to house prices, 
counterfactuals are above actual values in 
Sweden
, but not signi˚cantly so. In 
Norway
, the di˝erence is positive 
only in 2017, and the estimated con˚dence interval is very large. While these results are suggestive of some 
e˝ect on household credit, they should be interpreted with care, bearing in mind the relatively short time 
since the implementation of some measures and the well-known empirical challenge in isolating˛the˛impact of 
policy changes from that of other intervening factors
