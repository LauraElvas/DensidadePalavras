expansion continued in 2018, albeit at a more moderate pace as external demand 
weakened and some country and sector
-specific factors dampened growth. At the 
same time, the underlying drivers of domestic demand remained in place. Further 
improvements in the labour markets supported private consumption, while business 
investment continued to benefit from favourable financing conditions and improving 
balance sheets. The ongoing expansion and tightening of labour markets also 

translated into a continued strengthening and broadening of domestic cost pressures. 
At the same time, measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted. 
However, looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the med
ium 
term, supported by the ECB™s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic 

expansion and rising wage growth.

On the grounds of substantial progress towards a sustained adjustment in inflation, 
together with the underlying strength of the euro area economy and 
well
-anchored 
inflation expectations, the monthly pace of net asset purchases under the asset 
purchas
e 
program
me (APP) 
was gradually reduced throughout 2018 and the net 
purchases finished at the end of the year. Nevertheless, monetary policy remained 

patient, prudent and persistent and retained the ample degree of accommodation that 
was still needed to ensure the continued convergence of inflation to levels below, but 
close to, 2% 
over
 the medium term. Accommodation was provided
 by the
 residual
 net 
asset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated 
reinvestments, and by forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates
, which 
remained at 
historical
 lows
. At the end of 2018 monetary policy assets accounted for 
72% of the Eurosystem™s balance sheet. The size of the balance sheet reached a 

historical high of •4.7 trillion. Risks related to the large balance sheet continued to be 
mitigated by the ECB risk management framework.

The risk environment confronting the euro area
 financial sector bec
ame more 
challenging during
 2018. On the one hand, several factors support
ed the financial 
stability environment
, includ
ing
 a growing economy and improving banking sector 
resilience. On the other hand, increasing downside risks to growth, not least due to 
increas
ing trade protectionism, and rising political and policy uncertainty
, weighed
 on the
 financial stability environment
 in 2018
. 
Strong risk
-taking in financial and real 
estate 
markets continue
d 
to fuel the build
-up of asset price vulnerabilities
, while risks 
continued to build up in the growing non
-bank financial sector
. In this environment
, 
euro area countries, in consultation with the ECB, implemented a number of 
macroprudential measures to mitigate and build up resilience to systemic risks.
In 
addition,
ECB Banking Supervision took microprudential actions and continued to 
contribute to a stable European banking sector and a level playing field for all banks in 

the euro area
. 
Ten years after the outbreak of the global financial crisis, the main 
regulatory reforms that have contributed to building a more resilient financial sector 

are close to completion. However, while substantial progress has been made, 
more 
needs to be done
. In this regard, in 2018 the ECB continued to contribute to the 

ongoing discussions on completing the banking union and 
the 
capital markets union
, 
and also 
highlighted 
the importance of developing tools to mitigate risks in the 
non-bank financial sector.

Occasional Paper Series

















The 
Eurosystem plays a central role in developing, operating and overseeing the 
market infrastructure that ensures
 the free flow of 
payments
, securities and collateral 
across Europe. Since the launch of the euro in 1999, it has greatly contributed to 
reshaping and consolidating the infrastructure for
 large
-value payments, 
for 
post
-trading services for financial instruments and, most recently, for instant 
retail 
payment services
. Furthermore, the Eurosystem monitors the evolution of the digital 
transfor
mation process to ensure 
that 
the safety and efficiency of financial market 
infra
structures are maintained
. 



































































































































































































































































































































































































































In response to increasing concerns regarding the viability of the euro overnight index 
average 
(EONIA
), in 2017 the ECB started developing a 
new 
reference interest rate
, the euro short
-term rate (
•STR
), 
based entirely on money market statistical reporting 
(MMSR) data. The 
•STR
 methodology was published in June
 2018 after receiving 
broad support in two public consultations and was subsequently recommended by the 
working group on euro risk
-free rates as a replacement for EONIA. As a result, 
the 
•STR
 is expected to become one of the main reference rates in euro area markets.
 The ECB is responsible for the administration of various financial operations on behalf 
of the EU. It also has an overall coordinating role in relation to the Eurosystem 

Reserve Management Services framework.
 In order to promote the integrity and effective functioning of the wholesale f
oreign 
exchange market
, a set of principles of good practice has been developed (see Box
 5 
at the end of this 
chapter
). 








































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































The ECB and the euro area NCBs are responsible for issuing euro banknotes within 
the euro area and for maintaining confidence in the currency. The number and value of 
euro banknotes in circulation have been rising since their introduction in 2002, and at a
 faster pace than economic growth in recent years. Owing to a combination of factors, 
including enhanced 
security features in the new Europa series, cooperation with law 
enforcement, and communication and training efforts at European and national level, 

th
e number of counterfeits has further decreased to a very low level. The introduction 
of the new •100 and •200
 banknotes with their new, innovative security features on 
28 May
 2019 will complete the Europa series.
 



















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































The ECB
 Œ 
assisted by the NCBs and, for tasks
 related
 to the Single Supervisory 
Mechanism (SSM)
, by the NCAs
 Œ 
develops, collects, compiles and disseminates a 
wide range of statistics which are needed to support the monetary policy of the euro 
area, the supervisory functions of the ECB, financial stability and various other tasks of 
the ESCB and the tasks of the 
ESRB
. These statistics are also used by public 
authorities, financial market participants, the media and the general public, 
contributing to the fulfilment of the ECB™s transparency objective. The ESCB 
deepened further its cooperation with the
 European Statistical System, in particular in 
the reflections and initiatives on measuring globalisation and the activities of 
multinational enterprises. In 2018 the ESCB continued to provide regular euro area 
statistics in a smooth and timely manner. In addition, it devoted considerable effort to 
fulfilling new 
requirements
 for high
-quality and more granular statistics at the country, 
sector and instrument level.
 









































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Research priorities at the ECB are regularly reviewed and adjusted with 
the
 aim of 
providing
 sound analytical foundations for addressing the challenges faced by ECB 
policymakers. Collaboration across the ESCB is fostered by the 
ongoing 
activities of 
three research clusters and two research networks.
 In an environment 
characterised 
by negative policy rates, the transmission of non
-standard monetary policy 
measures 
and the interplay between monetary policy, financial stability and the real sectors of the 

economy remained at the core of the 2018 research priorities. Studies assessed the 
effects 
of non
-standard measures in counterbalancing the economic consequences of 
adverse financial shocks by reducing market uncertainty and improving access to 

bank finance for small and medium
-sized firms. With the macroprudential policy 
framework in place, a new research task force was set up to study the interaction 

between monetary and macroprudential policies and their optimal coordination. Other 

priorities were the role played by
 financial factors in firm and household behaviour in 
the euro area, price and wage
-setting dynamics, and the design of institutional and 
policy arrangements to strengthen EMU. The
 role of financial frictions in the 
propagation of monetary policy and economic shocks
 feature
s 
prominently in
 a new 
version of the ECB™s Area
-Wide Model and the further development of 
multi
-countr
y 
models used for forecasting and monetary policy analysis
. 










































































































































































































This chapter deals with the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union 
concerning the ECB, reports on ECB opinions and cases of non
-compliance with the 
obligation to c
onsult the ECB on draft legislation falling within its fields of competence, 
as well as monitoring compliance with the prohibition of monetary financing and 
privileged access.
 





















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































In 2018 the ECB maintained its close dialogue with 
various 
European fora and 
institutions, including the European Council, the ECOFIN Council, the Eurogroup, the 
European Parliament and the European Commission. The economic outlook, 
deepening EMU and 
matters 
related to the EU fiscal and economic governance 
framework 
were among 
the 
topics 
discussed at 
European Council, Eurogroup and 
ECOFIN Council meetings in which the President of the ECB and other members of 
the 
Executive Board took part.

Occasional Paper Series





















































Over the past years central bank communication has increasingly become a core 
element of monetary policy, even becoming a policy tool in itself. By clearly signalling 
its intentions and communicating policies, especially to the financial markets and 

expert audiences, the ECB has successfully enhanced the effectiveness of its policies. 
In the past year the ECB further strengthened its efforts to reach out beyond its 
traditional audiences. The aim is to engage with wider civil society and have a 

conversation with and listen to the broader public, using new platforms and formats. 
Unlike communication with markets and experts, this type of engagement
 often deals 
with underlying questions about what the ECB does, why it does it, and how it is 
relevant to individual people and their communities. By reaching out to a wider 
audience and engaging in a genuine two
-way dialogue, the ECB is seeking to 
enhance
 understanding of its role and policies and also to build trust in the ECB as an 
institution.
 





















































































































































































Strengthening its reputation as a world
-class institution and inspiring, developing and 
engaging its people are two of the ECB™s strategic priorities.
 In 2018 these priorities 
guided the ECB in its efforts to
: (i)
 create 
organisational excellence through a more 
diverse and inclusive culture and enhanced integrity, transparency and accountability 

to EU citizens
; (ii)
 build up resilience in the face of technological threats through an 
enhanced capacity to defend
 the ECB and the financial ecosystem from cyberattacks
; 
and (iii)
 ensure a strong environmental performance through a continuous reduction of 
the ECB™s ecological footprint.

first operation following the date indicated. The change on 18 September 2001 was effective on that same day. From 10 March 2004 the date refers both to the deposit and

marginal lending facilities, and to the main refinancing operations (with changes effective from the first main refinancing operation following the Governing Council decision),

unless otherwise indicated.2) On 22 December 1998 the ECB announced that, as an exceptional measure between 4 and 21 January 1999, a narrow corridor of 50 basis points would be applied between the
interest rates for the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility, aimed at facilitating the transition to the new monetary regime by market participants.
3) On 8 June 2000 the ECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem would be conducted as
variable rate tenders. The minimum bid rate refers to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids.4) As of 9 October 2008 the ECB reduced the standing facilities corridor from 200 basis points to 100 basis points around the interest rate on the main refinancing operations. The
standing facilities corridor was restored to 200 basis points as of 21 January 2009.5) On 8 October 2008 the ECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 15 October, the weekly main refinancing operations would be carried out through a
fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment at the interest rate on the main refinancing operations. This change overrode the previous decision (made on the same day) to cut

by 50 basis points the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations conducted as variable rate tenders.1 Financial and monetary developmentsS 3 ECB Annual Report 2018 - Statistical section1.2 Eurosystem monetary policy operations allotted through tender procedures(EUR millions; interest rates in percentages per annum)1.2.1 Main and longer-term refinancing operations 1), 2), 3)  Main refinancing operations    Date ofBidsNumber ofAllotmentFixed rate tender   Variable rate tenderRunning for

Source: ECB.1) Only the last ten operations of 2018 are displayed in each category.
2) With effect from April 2002, split tender operations (i.e. operations with a one-week maturity conducted as standard tender procedures in parallel with a main refinancing
operation) are classified as main refinancing operations.3) On 8 June 2000 the ECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem would be
conducted as variable rate tender procedures. The minimum bid rate refers to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids. On 8 October 2008 the

ECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 15 October 2008, the weekly main refinancing operations would be carried out through a fixed rate tender

procedure with full allotment at the interest rate on the main refinancing operations.  On 4 March 2010 the ECB decided to return to variable rate tender procedures in the

regular three-month longer-term refinancing operations, starting with the operation to be allotted on 28 April 2010 and settled on 29 April 2010.
4) In liquidity-providing (absorbing) operations, the marginal rate refers to the lowest (highest) rate at which bids were accepted.

5) For the operations settled on 22 December 2011 and 1 March 2012, after one year counterparties have the option to repay any part of the liquidity that they have been allotted
in these operations, on any day that coincides with the settlement day of a main refinancing operation.6) Targeted longer-term refinancing operation. Further information can be found in the ````Monetary Policy'''' section of the ECB's website (https://www.ecb.europa.eu) under 
````Instruments'''' then ````Open market operations''''.
7) In this longer-term refinancing operation, the rate at which all bids are satisfied is indexed to the average minimum bid rate in the main refinancing operations over the life of the
operation. The interest rates displayed for these indexed longer-term refinancing operations have been rounded to two decimal places. For the precise calculation method,
