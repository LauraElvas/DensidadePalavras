At its monetary policy meeting on 13
 September, the Governing Council 
concluded that the incoming information, including the September
 2018 ECB 
staff projections, broadly confirms the Governing Council™s previous 

assessment of an ongoing bro
ad-based expansion of the euro area economy 
and gradually rising inflation.

































While the global economy maintained a steady pace in the first half of 2018, 
momentum is expected to moderate.













In financial markets, e
uro area
 long
-term ri
sk-free rates have been
 broadly 
unchanged
 since the Governing Council™s meeting in June
 2018.












The latest economic indicato
rs and survey results confirm ongoing 
broad
-based growth of the euro area economy
, d
espite some moderation 
following the strong growth performance in 2017
.










The Septe
mber
 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.0% in 2018, 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 
2020.










According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation 
was
 2.0% in August
 2018, down from 2.1% in July.













This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September
 2018 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP 

inflation at 
1.7
% in 2018, 2019 and 2020
.





The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is
 projected to be broadly neutral 
in 2018, mildly expansionary in 2019
, and 
broadly neutral 
again
 in 2020.











Broad money 
(M3) 
grow
th moderated in the context of reduced monthly net 
asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP).






























Based on the regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council 
made the following decisions.















































While the global economy maintained a steady pace in the first half of 2018, 
momentum 
is expected to 
moderate amid 
mounting risks and uncertainties
 related to 
rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility
. Advanced economies continue
 to benefit from accommodative monetary policies and 

the US fiscal stimulus
, while
 activity 
among 
commodity exporters has also been 
bolstered by the recovery in commodity prices over the past year. 
However, financial 
conditions have tightened, particularly
 for some emerging markets. Moreover, g
lobal 
trade growth has slowed and uncertainties about future trading relations
 have risen
. Over the medium
 term, global economic activity is expected to expand at a pace close 
to potential growth. Output gaps are already closed or closing in most advanced 

economies
, policy support will gradually diminish
 and China 
is transitioning
 to a lower 
growth path.
 Global i
nflation
ary pressures are expected to rise slowly as spare 
capacity diminishes.
 Risks to global activity are
 skewed to the downside.
 
Despite mounting risks and uncertainties, the global economy continued to 
expand at a steady pace in the first half of 2018.














Surveys suggest global activity 
momentum
 might moderate somewhat
.

Further tariff increases and uncertainties about future trading relations are 
likely to weigh on global economic momentum
 going forward
.








































A mix of concerns over trade, the gradual normalisation of monetary policies in 

advanced economies, and policy uncertainties in 
some 
EMEs have led to 
heightened tensions in financial markets
 in recent months.





































































In the near term, global economic momentum is expected to moderate.



















Over the medium
 term, global economic activity is expected to expand at a pace 
close to potential growth.














Turning to developments across countries, i
n the United States
 activity is 
expected to remain strong this year.
















In Japan, the economic expansion is projected to decelerate gradually.










In the United Kingdom, the outlook is for moderate growth as domestic demand 

remains subdued.







In central and eastern European countries
, GDP growth is projected to remain 
robust in the near term
.



Recent data suggest that activity in China is decelerating in the near term.















Economic activity is 
projected to strengthen moderately
 in the large 
commodity
-exporting countries.





























Turkey
 is expected to undergo a difficult adjustment in the coming months
.













After strong growth in 2017, global trade indicators point to a deceleration in 

the first half of this year.

Since the Governing Council™s meeting in June
 2018, euro area long
-term risk
-free 
rates have remained broadly unchanged. Sovereign bond spreads have been volatile 
against a background of 
sustained 
political uncertainty in Italy
. Although corporate 
earnings remain robust, equity and bond prices of euro area financial corporations 

have declined amid geopolitical uncertainty and rising volatility in emerging markets. 

In foreign exchange markets, the euro
 has broadly strengthened in trade
-weighted 
terms
. Long-term yields remain broadly unchanged in the euro area and in the United 
States.

Despite some moderation following the strong growth performance in 2017, the lat
est 
economic indicators and survey results overall confirm ongoing broad
-based growth 
in the euro area economy. Euro area real GDP growth is supported 
primarily 
by growth in 
private consumption and investment. 
The September

pro
jections for the euro area
 foresee annual real GDP increasing by 
2.0
% in 2018, 
1.8
% in 2019 and 
1.7
% in 2020. Compared with the 
June
 2018 E
urosystem
 staff 
macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down
 slightly
 for 2018 and 2019, mainly due to a somewhat weaker contribution from foreign 
demand.
 Growth moderated in the first two quarters of 2018, but remained broad
-based 
across euro area countries.

According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation declined 
slightly to 2.0% in August
 2018, from 2.1% in July.
 While measures of underlying 
inflation
 remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. 
Domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of 
capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, which is pushing up wage 

growth.
 Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of 
the year and thereafter to increase gradually over the medium term, supported by 
the 
ECB™s
 monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion and rising wage 
growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September 2018 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 
1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020
 Œ 
unchanged from the June 2018 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections

Headline inflation decreased slightly in August.

remained close to the favourable levels recorded at 

the beginning of the year
.
































The euro area budget deficit is projected to 
decline
 further over the projection horizon 
(201
8-
20), 
mainly as a result of 
favourable
 cyclical conditions and de
clining
 interest 
payments
 as high
-cost debt continues to be replaced by new debt issued at lower 
interest rates
. 
The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is 
expected
 to be 
broadly 
neutral in 2018 and then mildly expansionary in 2019 before returning to broadly 
neutral levels in 2020. Although the euro area government debt
-to
-GDP ratio
 will 
continue to decline, it will remain elevated.
 In particular the countries with high debt 
levels would benefit from
 additional consolidation efforts to set their public debt ratio 
firmly on a downward path.
The euro area general government budget deficit is projected to decline further 
over the project
ion horizon 
(2018-20).

Cumulative change

























Prepared by Allan Gloe Dizioli and Björn van Roye
 The global trad
ing
 landscape has 
changed rapidly 
in recent months. 
Announcements of tariffs by the US 
Administration and re
taliation 
by 
its trading 
partners 
have 
raised concerns about a possible ﬁtrade warﬂ and, potentially, a 
broader reversal of globalisation.



































This box 
looks at the possible impact 
on the global economy 
of a hypothetical 
escalation in trade tensions.






















In the near term, t
he direct effects of higher 
trade 
tariffs on economic activity 
in 
the country imposin
g the tariffs 
depend on two main channels: the expenditure 
switching channel
 Œ 
with a positive impact on GDP
 Œ 
and the aggregate income 
channel
 Œ 
with 
a negative impact.








































Economic Modelling























IMF Working Paper
s


















Indirect negative effects arising from 
a deterioration in business and consumer 
confidence could ampli
fy the 
impact on economic 
activity.


































The protectionist measures taken so far 
will have 
only 
a marginal effect on 
global economic ac
tivity
, 
as the targeted products represent 
only 
a small part of 
world trade.










However, an escalation of trade tensions could have significant adverse global 
effects
, as shown in 
a hypothetical scenario
 in whi
ch the United States raises 
tariffs on all imports by 10
 percentage points and its trading partners 
retaliate 
with a 10
 percentage points tariff increase on their US imports.









































In our simulations, we also make some important modelling choices.




























Finally, 
in all scenarios the assumed form of retaliation is critical to spillove
rs.

























This scenario design suggests significant negative effects on the United States.






















By contrast, 
in China 
the trade effect on GDP is initially slightly positive
, although the gains diminish over time.
















The deterioration in confidence
 has significant adverse effects on global 
activity.

 As financial markets became progressively more integrated internationally over the 
past decades, economists wondered to what extent policymakers can isolate 
domestic financial conditions from external factors. This
 article reviews the terms of 
this debate and provides fresh evidence on the co
-movement in capital flows and 
stock prices across a panel of 50
 advanced and emerging economies. In particular, 

the article focuses on the relative importance of global risk and US monetary policy for 
the global financial cycle and touches upon the implications for the exchange rate 

regime. Global risk aversion emerges as a significant driver of capital flows and stock 
returns and its impact is amplified by capital account openness, but not necessarily by 
the exchange rate regime, which matters only for asset prices, not for capital flows. 

The quantitative relevance of US monetary policy and the US dollar exchange rate 
seems to be episodic. In particular, the correlation between US interest rates and 
capital flows throughout the crisis is positive, rather than negative as the theory would 

predict, indicating the need for further empirical analysis of the role of US monetary 
policy as the driver of the global financial cycle. The article also finds that financial 
market tensions have been typically synchronised between the euro area and the 

United States but that financial conditions in the two areas 
 have often decoupled. 
Overall, this confirms that the effectiveness of the ECB™s monetary policy has not been 
impaired by the global financial cycle.
 

Over the past decades, financial markets have become progressively more 
integrated internationally.








According to the literature, increasing financial integration has led to the 
emergence of a ﬁglobal financial cycleﬂ, strongly influenced by US monetary 
policy.


































Such a global financial cycle, if present, would limit the potential benefits of 
financial integration.












The 
existence
 of a global financial cycle would also have implications for 
policymakers and the choice of the exchange rate regime.

The most recent period is characterised by a decline in 
the 
synchronisation of 
capital flows and asset prices.





















Overall, there is strong evidence of a common cycle in risky asset prices and 
some support for the presence of a common pattern in capital flows across the 
globe.













The economic literature has identified two main potential drivers of the global 
financial cycle: US monetary policy and global risk aversion.























Figure
 1 





















A global factor shaping the co
-movement of risky asset prices is closely related 
to global risk aversion, which has been identified as one of the main drivers of 
the global financial cycle.


















A second central driver of the global financial cycle identified throughout the 

literature is the role of US monetary policy, which drives asset prices, both 

domestically and globally.

Given its prominence in international markets,
 the US dollar 
also 
play
s 
a catalytic role, reinforcing the transmission channels of US monetary policy to 

cross

The econometric evidence partly supports the presence of a dilemma
 in the 
transmission of global risk to capital flows and stock markets
 (see Box

with a specific characteristic (e.g.
 Open or Peg) suggests that the countries possessing that 
feature are more
 affected by global risk.





















Summing up, global risk aversion emerges as a significant driver of capital flows and stock 

returns and its impact is amplified by capital account openness, but not necessarily by the 

exchange 
rate regime, which matters only for asset prices when the capital account is open, 

not for capital flows.

3.2
 US monetary policy and the global financial cycle
 Empirically, there is a broad consensus that monetary policy actions of large 
central 
banks
, suc
h as the Federal Reserve System, spill over to global 
financial markets.


















However, 
there does not seem to be a stable relationship between the US policy 
rate, the value of the US dollar
 and global capital flows.























The value of the US dollar is negatively correlated with capital flows, even 

though the relationship is clearly driven by the cycle in the run
-up to the global 
financial crisis.

 Summary of the empirical evidence
 Overall, the evidence reviewed 
here 
suggests that capital

and risky asset 
prices have been influenced by global risk factors in the past decades.








Wh
ile
 the central role of US monetary policy and the presence of a US dollar

cycle for the global economy.















The euro area is not an island:
 p

euro naturally exposed to changes in global financial conditions

interesting to focus on the relationship

 Private sector inflation expectations are a key component of a broad range
 of 
indicators that the ECB considers when determining the appropriate monetary policy 
stance for achieving its price stability objective. Inflation expectations can not only 
affect inflation itself through the wage and price
-setting processes, but also se
rve as a 
useful cross
-check on the ECB™s and the Eurosystem™s own projections.
 This article focuses on market
-based measures of longer
-term inflation expectations, 
which are timely indicators derived from the prices of instruments that are traded in 

financ
ial markets and linked to future inflation outcomes. It reviews recent 
developments in the information that can be extracted from different types of 
market
-based indicator, starting from the period leading up to the ECB™s 
announcement of its expanded asset
 purchase programme (APP).
 The fall in market
-based indicators of longer
-term inflation expectations between 2014 
and mid
-2016 was consistent across major jurisdictions, possibly reflecting global 
concerns about weak aggregate demand and associated disinflationary pressures. 
Their subsequent recovery has been driven by a partial dissipation of these concerns 

and, in particular, a significant improvement in the euro area macroeconomic 
environment. The lion™s share of the movement in longer
-term inflation exp
ectations 
over the past few years has stemmed from the inflation risk component of these 
indicators, suggesting that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook has been one of 
the main drivers. Indeed, information extracted from the prices of inflation 
options 
implies that the risk
-neutral probability of deflation increased noticeably in late 2014 
and early 2015, before declining more recently.
 

Inflation expectations play a central role in the ECB™s monetary policy, as its 
primary and overriding objective is to maintain price stability in the euro area.































The ECB therefore closely monitors private agents™ inflation expectations in the 
form of both survey
-based and market
-based mea
sures.



























This
 article reviews recent developments in market
-based measures of euro 
area inflation expectations, in particular the shift in the balance of risks to the 

inflation outlook since 2014.




























This section reviews recent developments in investors™ longer
-term inflation 
expectations by analysing the evolution of inflation
-linked swap (ILS) rates.












Monthly 
Bulletin






















ILS rates provide a cleaner measure of longer
-term inflation expectations than 
bond-derived break
-even inflation rates (BEIRs).















However, ILS rates still contain risk premia as compensation for inflation risk 

exposure.






















During the period from 2014 to mid
-2016, ILS rates fell significantly across 
major jur
isdictions (see Chart
 1).














































































Chart
 1 








Consistent with these observations, econometric analysis suggests that global 
factors have increasingly influenced the euro area 5y5y ILS rate.




















Spillovers to longer
-term inflation expectations rose substantially in 2015, 
possibly reflecting global concerns about weak 
aggregate demand and 
associated disinflationary pressures (see Chart
 2).













Economic Journal








































































Chart

The inflation risk premium entered into negative territory towards the end of 

2015, as deflation rather than excessive inflation became the key concern and 

investor appetite for inflation
-linked instruments fell (see Chart

The inflation risk premium fell around the same time as the balance of risks to

Since mid
-2016 measures of longer
-term inflation expectations have trended 
upwards.
























Model

reflected a dissipation of perceived downside risks to the inflation outlook amid 
a broad

Chart

 be larger than the

the notion that investors require risk premia for the associated inflation events.




















Although option
-implied probabilities need to be interpreted bearing in mind the above 
considerations, tra
cking their evolution over time does convey important information on 

changes in investors™ assessment of the euro area inflation outlook.
















Market
-based indicators of euro area inflation expectations have recently 
recovered 
on the back of a significant improvement in the domestic 
macroeconomic outlook, following a marked decline between 2014 and 
mid
-2016.





































The recent developments in longer
-term market
-based indicators have been 
due primarily to the inflation risk premium, which changed in line with the shifts 
in the balance of risks to the i
nflation outlook.















Market
-based indicators also suggest that the spectre of deflation in the
 euro 
area has steadily receded following the ECB™s launch of the APP and is now 

regarded as negligible by investors.
