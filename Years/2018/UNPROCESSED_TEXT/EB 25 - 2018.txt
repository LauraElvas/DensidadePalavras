 Summary

conomic and monetary
 developments
 Summar
y 
The information 
that has become available since the Governing Council
™s last
 meeting of the year 2017 confirms a robust pace of economic expansion, which 
accelerated more than expected in the second half of 2017.
1 The strong cyclical 
momentum, the ongoing reduction of economic slack and increasing capacity 

utilisation strengthen
ed further 
the Governing Council
™s confidence that inflation will 
converge towards 
its
 inflation aim of below, but close to, 2%.
 The risks surrounding 
the euro area growth outlook are broadly balanced. On the one hand, the prevailing 

strong cyclical momentum could lead to further positive growth surprises in the near 

term. On the other hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors, 

including developments in foreign exchange markets.
 The global economy is continuing to expand at a solid rate, with increasing signs of 

synchronisation. Activity is benefiting from favourable global financial conditions and 

strong sentiment. Rising oil prices have contributed t
o increasing
 global inflation, but 
inflation excluding food and energy prices has remained more stable.
 Amid 
this 
improved economic sentiment
, euro area yields and equities have risen
 since
 the 
Governing Council
™s meeting in 
December. In foreign exchange markets, 
the euro appreciated 
overall 
in trade
-weighted terms, in particular against the US 
dollar
. This 
recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty 
which requires monitoring with regard to its po
ssible implications for the 

medium
-term outlook for price stability.
 The economic analysis based on the latest economic data and survey results 
indicate
s 
continued strong and broad
-based growth momentum at the turn of the 
year. Private consumption is supported by rising employment, which is also 
benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. 
Business investment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable 
financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. Housing 

investment has improved further over recent quarters.
 In addition, the broad
-based 
global expansion is providing impetus to euro area exports.
 Euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.4% in December
 2017, down from 1.5% in 
November, mainly reflecting developments in energy prices. Looking ahead, on the 

basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to 
hover around current levels in the coming months. Measures of underlying inflation 
remain subdued
 Œ 
in part owing to special factors
 Œ 
and have yet to show convincing 
signs of a sustained upward trend.
 Looking forward, they are expected to rise 
                                                                    1

 Sum
mary
 3 gradually over the medium term, supported by 
the ECB
™s
 monetary policy measures, 
the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack 
and rising wage growth.
 The monetary analysis confirms that broad money growth continued to expand at the 

robust pace generally witnessed since mid
-2015. The recovery in loan growth to the 
private sector also 
continued
. The euro area bank lending survey for the fourth 
quarter of 2017 shows that loan growth was still supported by increasing loan 

demand and the easing of credit standards for loans, in particular
 to households. 
Moreover, financing costs for euro area non
-financial corporations (NFCs) have 
remained favourable, with bank lending rates for NFCs being close to their historical 

lows.
 Considering 
the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the 
monetary analysis, the Governing Counci
l 
confirmed the need for an ample degree 
of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards 
levels that are below, but close to, 2%.
 While t
he Governing Council
™s confidence 
that inflation will converge
 towards
 its inflation 
aim has strengthened, domestic price 
pressures remain muted overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a 

sustained upward trend.
 Therefore
, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains 
necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build
 up and support 

headline inflation developments over the medium term.
 Accordingly, the Governing Council decided to keep the
 key ECB interest rates
 unchanged and continues to expect the
m 
to remain at their present levels for an 
extended period of time, and
 well past the horizon of the net asset purchases
. 
Regarding
 non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council
 confirmed
 that the
 net asset purchases, at the new monthly pace of •30
 billion
 in 
place since January, are intended to run until the end of September
 2018, or beyond, 
if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained 
adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. Moreover, the 
Governing Council reconfirmed
 that if the outlook becomes less favourable, or if 
financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained 

adjus
tment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council 
stand
s 
ready to increase 
the asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. Finally,
 the Governing Council reiterated that the Eurosystem will reinvest the principal 

payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme
 for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any 
case for as
 long as necessa
ry.

 Global growth has continued to firm up.
 Following solid global GDP growth in the 
third quarter of 2017, survey indicators point to sustained global growth momentum 
in the final months of last year. The global 
comp
osite output 
Purchasing Managers
™ Index (
PMI
) 
increased to 54.4 in December, from 54.0 in the previous month. The 
strong performance in December reflected ongoing robust expansion in advanced 

economies and a pick
-up in emerging economies, driven by China and India
 in 
particular. 
The latest data are consistent with indications of an ongoing broad
-based 
and synchronised global economic recovery (see Chart
 1).

countries where the three
-month 
average annual 
change in industrial 
production is higher than the previous three
-year average annual 
change
. 
Survey indicators point to continued strong global trade momentum in the 
final quarter of 2017.
 Global goods import growth slowed in the first month
s 
of the 
fourth quarter, with the volume of merchandise imports increasing by 0.8% in three
-month
-on-three
-month terms in 
November
, following growth of 1.6% in the third 
quarter
 (see Chart
 2). The decline was driven by a moderation in imports in Asia and 
in 
a number of advanced economies. However, trade indicators have been more 

resilient, suggesting that in the fourth quarter world imports expanded at a pace 
similar to that seen in the third quarter. 
Global PMI new export orders rose to 53.8 in 
December, from 53.7 in the previous month, 
whi
ch is 
above its long

Note: 
The latest observations are for November
 2017 for g
lobal merchandise imports
 and December
 2017 for
 the PMIs.
 Global inflation picked up in November.
 Annual consumer price inflation in the 
OECD area increased to 2.4% in November, from 2.2% in October, reflecting 
acceleration in energy and food prices. However, excluding food and energy, inflation 

remained stable at 1.9%.
 Oil prices have continued to 
increase in recent weeks.
 Brent crude oil prices 
rose from around USD
 64 per barrel in mid
-December to over USD
 69 per barrel. 
Higher oil prices during this period partly reflect supply disruptions, notably the 
closing of the Forties pipeline in the North Sea for repairs, and political unrest in the 
Middle East. Strong demand for crude oil imports in China and increased US refining 

activity that drew more crude from inventories 
were 
also factors driving the recent oil 
price rise. Non
-oil commodity prices have also increased in recent weeks, driven 
particularly by increases in metal prices. Rising metal prices are related to supply 

disruptions in non
-ferrous metal industries following the introduction of environmental 
regulation in China and to rising demand for iron ore.
 The cyclical upswing has continued in the United States.
 After solid third
-quarter 
GDP growth at an annualised rate of 3.2%, growth is expected to have remained 

robust in the fourth quarter of last year. Activity is supported by accommodative
 financial conditions and buoyant confidence as well as the temporary boost 
associated with the reconstruction efforts after the hurricanes in the autumn. In line 

with robust economic activity, the labour market continued to tighten
, with a gain in 
non-far
m payroll 
employment of 148,000 in December, while the unemployment rate 
stayed unchanged at 4.1%. Notwithstanding tight labour market conditions, annual 
wage growth remains subdued
, with a slight increase to 2.
5% in December. Annual 
headline CPI inflation
 declined to 2.1% in December on account of lower energy 

price inflation, but CPI inflation excluding food and energy firmed, rising to 1.8% on 

an annual basis in December, from 1.7% in the previous month. The Federal Open 
Market Committee (

 6 by raising the target range for the federal funds rate to 1.25
-1.50% in December. The 
US administration has also reached agreement on tax reform. The Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act, which took effect on 1
 January
 2018, permanently lowers corporate taxes, 
provides relief to small businesses, temporarily lowers personal income taxes and 
broadens the tax base. The resulting revenue loss from lower taxes is expected to 
be partially offset by additional taxes charged on income
 earned abroad by US 

multinationals. Overall, the fiscal stimulus provided by the reform 
is likely to 
boost US 
economic 
activity, although it could also exacerbate fiscal imbalances.
 In Japan, economic activity remains strong and the labour market continue
s to 

tighten.
 Real GDP grew by 0.6% quarter
-on-quarter in the third quarter of 2017 and 
recent economic indicators continue to point to firm growth in the final quarter of last 
year. The labour market continues to tighten, with the unemployment rate falling to 
2.7% in November, close to the levels of the early 1990s. Nonetheless, wage 

pressures remain modest, with total nominal cash earning
s 
rising by 0.9% in year
-on-year terms in November. Annual headline CPI inflation picked up in November to 
0.6%, but inflation excluding food and energy remained close to zero. Moreover, the 

latest Tankan survey of inflation expectations suggests that firms remain cautious 

about further price increases.
 In the United Kingdom, economic activity rebounded slightly, having sl
owed 
markedly in the first half of 2017.
 Real GDP growth slightly accelerated to 0.4% in 
the third quarter according to the final estimate. Recent indicators point to a 
continuation of growth at similar rates around the turn of the year. Survey indicators 
suggest a buoyant performance for export business, with the PMI Export Climate 

Index 
and data on 
new 
export 
orders from the manufacturing sector remaining at 
high levels in the final quarter of
 2017. By contrast
, indicators suggest that services 
activity growth has moderated. Annual CPI inflation marginally decelerated to 3.0% 

in December
 2017, from 3.1% in November, 
but is expected to continue to weigh on 
disposable income.
 In China, economic activity indicators point to resilient growth.
 GDP expanded 
by 6
.8% in year
-on-year terms in the fourth quarter of the year. Overall in 2017, 
output was 6.9% higher than 
in 
the previous year, above the government
™s target of 
6.5%. Consumer price inflation registered a slight increase in December, rising to 

1.8% from 1.7% in the previous month. A fall in mining and raw material price 

inflation pushed producer price inflation down to 4.9% in December
, from 5.8% 
in the 
previous month. The December Central Economic Work Conference, an annual 

meeting which sets the national agenda for the Chinese economy, confirmed that 
the 
authorities see high
-quality growth, further supply
-side reforms and mitigating 
financial risks as the main priorities for 2018.

 Euro area government bond yields have risen since 
mid

Chart

 In the period under review (from 14
 December to 
24 January), the GDP
-weighted euro area ten
-year sovereign bond yield increased by 
18 basis points to 
1.0
4%. These developments reflect improving market expectations for euro area 
economic growth and 
markets

revisions to the future course of monetary policy. 
The euro area ten
-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate increased by 
21 basis points to
 currently stand at 
0.8%.
 Thus the spread between the GDP
-weighted yield and the 
OIS rate increased slightly
 during the review period. This development masks 
diverging movements in the yield curves of individual countries
. For Germany, the 
ten
-year yield spread vis
-à-
vis 
the 
risk
-free OIS rate became somewhat less 
negative, possibly reflecting 
lower 
scarcity premia, while in Italy it widened amid 
market perceptions of increased political uncertainty. In contrast, the yield spreads 
on Portuguese and Spanish sovereign bonds continued their downward trajectory 

amid improvements in macroeconomic fundamentals. In the United Kingdom, the 
ten
-year 
gilt 
yield 
increased by 
23 basis points to stand at 1.
41%, 
while in the United 
States the passage of the tax reform contributed to a

 8 the case of euro area bank equities. Favourable corporate profit expectations and 
reduced equity risk compensation, both fuelled by the positive macro environment, 
more than compensated for the dampening effect stemming from higher yields. The 

equity prices of US NFCs and banks also increased over the review period, by 
7.1
% and 6.7
% respectively. Market expectations of equity price volatility in the euro area 

remained constant,
 whereas they 
increased 
in the United States. Both are still 
quoted at levels (
12.4%
 and 11.5%
 respectively) which are comparatively low from a

The

 Excess liquidity declined by around •9

for medium

 Market sentiment regarding the course of monetary 
policy in 2018 remained unchanged. Beyond that horizon, market participants 

increased their interest
 rate expectations.
 In foreign exchange markets, the euro appreciated 
overall

On an annual basis, consumption rose by

regards the fourth quarter, continued favourable conditions in the capital goods 
sector
, such as 
increasing
 capacity utilisation, rising orders, 
as well as 
stronger 
confidence and 
demand, 
signal 
overall 
a 
continuation of the dynamic 
investment 
momentum
. Monthly data on capital goods production up to November also suggest 
rising business investment in the near term. With regard to construction investment, 
monthly construction production data until No
vember 
point to
 somewhat slower 
growth in the 
fourth 
quarter of 2017 compared with the third quarter
. However, 
survey indicators on the demand situation and the assessment of order books in the 
sector
, as well as the number of building permits
 issued,
 are in line with 
positive 
growth momentum around the turn of the year. In some countries, however, there are 
growing indications of capacity constraints in construction related to labour 

shortages.
 Investment is expected to remain an important contributor
 to output growth in 
the period ahead
. Investment should continue to be supported by very strong 
business confidence
 and lower uncertainty
, higher 
capacity utilisation, 
accommodative 
financing conditions, stronger 
corporate 
profits and the 
widespread 
need to modernise the capital stock.
 According to the euro area sectoral accounts, 
the corporate gross operating surplus 
increased in 
the third quarter of 2017 at a 
higher year
-on-year rate than in the previous quarter. Furthermore, 
earnings 
expectations
 for li
sted companies in the euro area continue to register high levels. 
As 
regards construction investment, 
features 
such as 
households
™ rising disposable 
income and very favourable
 lending conditions should underpin demand in the 
construction sector. 
At the sam
e time, some factors are expected to continue to 
weigh on the outlook for investment, including expectations of weaker growth 
over 
the medium term
. 
Export
 growth
 remained strong
 in the third quarter of 2017
 and
 trade 
indicators point to sustained momentum 
going forward.
 Total euro area exports 
rose by 1.5% in the third quarter
 on account of
 strong 
goods exports, continuing the 
robust growth pattern seen earlier in 2017. M
onthly 
trade in goods data up to 
November 
suggest that
 extra
-euro area export
s 
will continue to show positive growth 
in the fourth 
quarter
 of 2017, in line with the recovery in foreign demand
. Exports in 
October seem to have been
 supported
 mainly 
by 
demand from outside the EU, with 
positive contributions also from EU economies.

 The ECB

consumption is supported by rising employment, which is also benefiting from past 

labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. Business investment 
continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, rising 
corporate profitability and solid demand. Housing investment has improved further 

over recent quarters. In addition, the broad
-based global expansion is providing 
impetus to euro area exports.
 The results of the latest round of the

The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are assessed as broadly 
balanced.
 On the one hand, the prevailing strong cyclical momentum could lead to 
further positive growth surprises in the near term. On the other hand, downside risks 
continue to relate primarily to global factors, including developments in foreign 
exchange markets.

 14 producer price inflation for non
-food consumer goods remained broadly stable at 
0.3%.
 Recent data confirm the upward s
hift in wage growth from its low in 
the 
second quarter of 
2016. Annual growth in compensation per employee was 1.7% in 
the third quarter of 2017, unchanged from the previous quarter but up from a low of 
1.1% in the second quarter of 2016. The increase since then stems mainly from 
higher contributions 
from 
wage drift, which usually reacts to cyclical developments 
with a shorter lag than negotiated wages. Annual growth in negotiated wages 
increased slightly from 1.5% in September
 2017 (which was also the average of the 
third quarter
) 
to 1.6% in October
 2017. While recent developments in wage growth 
are in line with improving labour market conditions, they may still be weighed down 

by factors such as past low inflation, weak productivity growth and the ongoing 
impact of
 labour market reforms implemented in certain countries during the crisis.

th 
rate of M3 remained broadly unchanged at 4.9% in November
 2017
, fluctuating 
around th
e 
level observed 
since mid
-2015 (see Chart
 9). The low opportunity cost of 
holding liquid deposits in an environment of very low interest rates and the impact of 
the EC
B™
s monetary policy measures again lent 
support 
to 
M3 growth. The most 
liquid components remained the main contributor to broad money growth, with the 

annual growth rate of M1 standing at 9.1% in November (compared with 9.4% in 

October).

 Notes: Credit to the private sector includes MFI (monetary financial institution) loans to the private sector and MFI h
oldings of 
securities issued by the euro area private non
-MFI sector. It thus includes the Eurosystem
™s holdings of debt securities in the context of 
the corporate sector purchase programme. The latest observation is for November
 2017.
 Domestic counterpart
s of M3 
remained the main driver of broad money 
growth.
 From a counterpart perspective, the Eurosystem
™s purchases of government 
bonds (see the red p
arts 
of Chart
 9), conducted mainly in the context of the public 
sector purchase programme (PSPP), had a 
positive 
effect on 
M3 growth. In addition, 
the ongoing recovery in credit to the private sector (see the blue p
arts 
of Chart
 9) continued to support M3 growth. This includes both MFI loans to the private sector 
and MFI holdings of securities issued by the euro area private non
-MFI sector. As 
such, it also covers the Eurosystem
™s purchases of non
-MFI debt securities under 
the corporate sector purchase programme. The persistent contraction in 
MFIs
™ longer
-term financial liabilities (excluding capital and reserves), presented together 
with other counterparts (see the dark green parts of Chart
 9), again 
made a positive 
contribution to M3 growth.
 The annual rate of change of such liabilities has been 
negative since the second quarter of 2012, partly owing to the impact of the ECB
™s targeted long
er-term refinancing operations, which may have acted as a substitute 
for longer
-term market

 MFIs
™ net external assets 
again 
weighed
 on annual M3 
growth (see t
he yellow 
parts of Chart
 9).
 Although
 the annual flow of net external assets remained negative 
in November
 2017, capital outflows from the euro area, which are partly explained by 
PSPP-related sales of euro area government bonds by non
-residents, have decl
ined 
over recent months. This has helped to ease the related downward pressure on M3 
growth. Non
-residents, while 
still 
among the main sellers of securities eligible for the 
asset purchase programme, may have moderated the rebalancing of their portfolios 
away from other euro area assets.
 The gradual recovery in loan growth 
continued
. The annual growth rate of MFI 
loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash 

pooling) increased to 2.9% in November (see Chart
 10). Acro
ss sectors, the annual 
growth rate of loans to non
-financial corporations 
rose
 to 3.1% in November (from 
2.9% in October)
. Mean
while
, the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at
 2.8% (compared with
 2.7% in October). The significant decrease in bank lending 

rates seen across the euro area since mid
-2014 (
notably owing
 to the ECB
™s non-standard monetary policy measures) and overall improvements in the supply of, 
and demand for, bank loans have supported these trends. In addition, banks have 

made progress in consolidating their balance sheet
s, although the level of 
non-performing loans remains high in some countries and may constrain financial 
intermediation.

 18 The 
January
 2018 
euro area bank lending survey
 suggests that loan growth 
continued to be supported by increasing loan demand by enterprises and 
households
, and easing credit standards for loans to households.
 In the fourth 
quarter of 2017, credit standards for loans
 to 
households for house purchase eased 
while they remained unchanged for loans to enterprises. Competitive pressure and 

reduced risk perceptions related to the improving economic outlook were important 

factors 
behind these developments. Banks also reported increasing net loan demand 
across all loan categories. Growth in fixed investment, merger and acquisition 
activity, the low general level of interest rates and favourable housing market 

prospects were significant drivers of
 loan demand. In additio
n, euro area banks 
continued to 
respond 
to regulatory
/supervisory actions in the second half of 2017 by 
further strengthening their capital positions.
 Euro area banks also reported a broadly 
neutral impact of these measures on credit standards across all loan categories, 
except 
in the case of consumer credit and other lending to households, where a 
slight tightening effect
 was observed
. 
Bank lending rates for NFCs and households remained at or close to their 

historical lows.
 In November
 2017 the composite bank lending rate for loans
 to 
NFCs
 reached a new historical low of 1.71%. 
The composite 
bank 
lending rate for 
housing loans remained broadly unchanged at 1.87% in November, 
which compare
s 
with the 
historical low of 1.78% 
reached 
in December
 2016 (see Chart
 11). 
Composite bank 
lending rates for loans to NFCs and households have decreased
 by 

more than market reference rates since the ECB
™s credit easing measures 
were 
announced 
in June
 2014. Between May
 2014 and November
 2017, the composite 
lending rates 
for l
oans to NFCs and households fell by 122 and 105
 basis points, 
respectively. The reduction in bank lending rates on NFC loans was 
particularly
 strong in vulnerable euro area countries, indicating a more homogeneous 
transmission of monetary policy to 
such rates across 
the euro area. Over the same 
period, the spread between interest rates charged on very small loans (loans of up to 
•0.25
 million) and those charged on large loans (loans of above •1
 million) in the 
euro area narrowed substantially. This indicates that small and medium
-sized 
enterprises have generally benefitted to a greater extent from the decline in bank 

lending rates than large companies.

 Note
s: Composite bank lending rates are calculated by aggregating short and long

-month moving average of 
new business volumes. The latest observation is for November
 2017. Net issuance of debt securities by euro area NFCs is estimated to 
have 
declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 The latest ECB data 
indicate that, 
on a net basis,
 the total 
flow of debt securities 
issued 
by NFCs 
in October and 
November 
was marginally 
lower
 than during the third
 quarter of 2017. 
Furthermore, 
accor
ding to market data, debt securities issuance activity weakened considerably in 
December
 2017, in line with historical regularities. 
Net issuance of listed shares by 
NFCs 
was again in positive territory, with the strengthening of October and 
November rever
sing the negative trend of the third quarter of 2017.
 Financing costs for euro area NFCs remain
ed favourable.
 The overall nominal 
cost of external financing for NFCs, comprising bank lending, debt issuance in the 
market and equity finance, is estimated to have stabilised at around 4.4% in the last 
quarter of 2017 and stayed at the same level in the first half of January
 2018. The 
cost of financing 
thus now

some 34
 basis points above 
the 
historical low of 
July
 2016, but it is still considerably 
below 
the levels observed in summer 2014
 and in line with the 
ECB
™s monetary policy stance. Recent developments in the 
overall 
nominal cost of financing reflect the fact that a slight increase 
in the cost of 
market
-based debt is being offset by further declines in the estimated cost of bank 
lending. Consequently
, the cost of debt, expressed as the weighted average of the 
cost of bank lending and the cost of market
-based debt, 
continues to fluctuate 
around 
its 
historical low 
of

 2017. T

 The macroeconomic impact of the US tax reform
 20 Boxes
 1 The macroeconomic impact of the US tax reform
 By Ursel Baumann and Allan Gloe Dizioli
 Following the passing of legislation on the US tax reform towards the end of last 
year, this box summarises its main features and assesses the channels via which the 
reform may affect the US macroeconomy. It also discusses possible spillovers and 

implications from a European perspective.
 In a major legislative achievement, US President Donald 
Trump signed into law 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 22
 December
 2017. This tax reform, which took 
effect on 1
 January
 2018, entails a major overhaul of the US tax system. The reform 
involves a large number of changes, with some of its main provisions being:
4 (i)
 a permanent reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, while allowing the 

full deduction of investment from the corporate tax base for five years, after which 

this will be phased out; (ii)
 a temporary simplification of and reduction in indi
vidual 
income taxes, as well as an increase in the child tax credit; (iii)
 lower income taxation 
for small business owners; and (iv)
 elimination of the taxation of most foreign 
corporate income of US corporate shareholders, implying a move to a 
ﬁhybrid
ﬂ te
rritorial system with a one
-time transition tax on untaxed profits of 15.5% on liquid 
and 8% on non
-liquid assets. The territorial system is complemented 
by 
base 
erosion measures and a minimum tax on some of the foreign operations of US 

companies.
 The tax burden on US corporate income will fall significantly to a level close to 
that in a number of euro area economies.
 Chart A shows the corporate tax rate 
(combined for central and sub
-central governments) of the United States before and 
after the reform as compared to the large euro area economies.  Prior to the reform, 

the US corporate tax rate stood above the rates of all large euro area 
countries, 
while
, after the reform, it is closer to the lower end of rates in those countries.
                                                                     4  
The Tax Policy Center provides a

 of the main changes entailed in the tax reform 
compared with the 2017 status quo.

the 
calculated rate
 after t
he reform in the United States.
 Overall, the reform will provide a significant fiscal stimulus to the US economy 
over the next decade.
 The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the static net 
fiscal stimulus for individuals and corporations at around 
USD
 1.46
 trillion over ten 
years
, or 0.7% of GDP per year on average
 (see Chart
 B). The largest revenue 
effects occur in the period up to 2025, largely because most of the provisions 
affecting individuals expire after 2025. The revenue effects from the provisions 

affecting domestic corpor
ations also diminish over time, partly owing to the gradual 
phasing out of bonus depreciation for investment. The main direct revenue generator 

of the reform stems from the one
-off tax on foreign income of US multinationals on 
which tax payments had been 
deferred until repatriation to the United States.

 Note: Fiscal revenue estimates are converted into calendar year estimates and divided by nominal GDP as estimated by the 
Congressional Budget Office.
 The reform is expected to boost US domestic demand and raise US real GDP 
in the near term.
 Lower individual income tax rates will raise household disposable 
income and boost consumption, especially among liquidity
-constrained households. 
Part of the increase in after
-tax income will also raise savings, in particular for 
wealthier individuals. In addition, lower corporate taxes should boost household 

wealth via higher asset prices and dividends, thereby also raising consumption and 
savings. Higher corporate profits may also lead to higher wages as workers bargain 
for a share of the increased profits,
5 which will in turn raise consumption. Finally, cuts 
in 
corporate taxes and the full deductibility of investment for five years will lower the 
after
-tax cost of investment, thereby raising demand as a result of 
increased 
incentives to invest.
 In addition, some positive impact on the
 economy
™s production capacity can 
be expected.
 Income tax cuts for individuals increase the after
-tax rate of return on 
labour, which may strengthen incentives for workers to increase their participation in 
the labour market.
6 Moreover, by increasing the 
after
-tax rate of return on capital, 
lower corporate taxes and the full deductibility of investment should increase 
investment and the economy
™s capital stock. A higher capital stock should, in turn, 
increase the economy
™s potential output and boost labour
 productivity. Some 
simplification of the tax code 
and the elimination of tax distortions for different 
corporates
™ financing strategies might also raise productivity by reallocating capital to 
more efficient sectors.
 However, in a mature stage of the business cycle, fiscal multipliers tend to be 
smaller than when there is a large output gap.

                                                                    5

 The macroeconomic impact of the US tax reform
 23 is that fiscal multipliers
 (i.e. the additional growth effect generated by a change in 
fiscal revenues as 
a percentage of GDP resulting from the policy change) are lower if 
the economy is close to or above its potential output.
7 8 Moreover, tax multipliers 
tend to be smaller than government spending multipliers, which also implies a rather 
limited positive demand effect from the tax re
form.
9 Available estimates suggest that the impact of the tax reform on US GDP will 

be positive in the short term, while the long
-term effects are much more 
uncertain.
 A number of institutions have performed model simulations of the 
macroeconomic effect of the tax reform (see Table
 A). A common finding across 

these institutions is that the reform will lead to a moderate boost in the level of US 

real GDP in the range of 0.5 to 1.3% over the next three years. However, the wide
-ranging estimates of the impact by 2027 suggest that the long
-term effects on the US 
economy are highly uncertain.
10 The long
-term effects depend to a large extent on 
how the tax reform will be financed and the impact of a higher deficit on sovereign 

debt costs. The lower cost of capital due to the tax reform should initially raise 
investment and the capital stock, thereby positively influencing the supply side of the 

economy. However, if the reform is
 assumed to be deficit
-financed, the growing fiscal 
deficit could eventually lead to higher long
-term interest rates, thereby raising the 
cost of capital and counterbalancing some of the positive supply
-side effects. By 
contrast, the overall impact on the capacity of the US economy can be expected to 
be more positive if the tax reform is financed by reduced spending or by raising other 
less distortionary taxes.

 Consumption of durable goods in the ongoing economic expansion
 25 2 Consumption of durable goods in the ongoing 
economic 
expansion
 By Maarten Dossche
 and Lorena Saiz
 Household spending on durable goods is the part of private consumption that 
is most sensitive to the business cycle.
 Private consumption encompasses 
services, non
-durable goods, semi
-durable goods and durable goods. Durable goods 
typically
 have an expected lifetime of more than three years, whereas semi
-durables 
and non
-durables have a shorter lifetime.
12 Households do not derive utility directly 
from spending on durable goods in the current period, but rather from the flow of 

services they provide over their lifetime. As a result, 
the 
consumption of durable 
goods is more sensitive to the business cycle. Households may temporarily reduce
 these purchases when their income falls, without any great
 reduction in utility
 in the 
short term.
 When
 th
eir income recovers, they can then resume their purchases again 
in order to offset earlier losses in their stock of durables
.13 In addition, durable goods 
also 
have a greater tendency to be 
financed using
 credit
, owing
 to their high unit 
value and their longer lifetime. The high unit value of durable goods 
means
 that 
current income may not be sufficient
, so households 
may
 need credit to finance 
them. Moreover, owing to their longer lifetime
, some durable goods can be used as 
collateral, which makes them easier to finance 
using
 credit. However,
 as credit 
standards are usually tighter during economic downturns and looser during 
expansions, this also makes them more sensitive to the business cycle.
14 As a result, 
even though durable goods only account for around
 10% of
 total consumption, they 
explain up to 20% of total variation in consumption growth
 owing to their 
greater
 variability.
 Growth 
in the consumption of durable goods 
has been
 very strong in recent 
years.
 During the financial crisis, durable goods consumption contracted sharply 
(see Chart
 A), although the car scrappage schemes in several euro area countries 
provided some relief by encouraging purchases of new cars (e.g. in 2009). Since 
2013, durable goods consumption has again grown vigorously, pushing up growth in 

overall consumption. The recovery 
observed 
in real disposable income
s 
and the 
easing of financing conditions have 
both 
boosted households
™ appetite for durable 
goods, particularly in those euro area countries that were more affected by the 
financial crisis.
                                                                     12

. 
Another factor supporting durable goods consumption 
is
 pent
-u
p demand.
 The 
sharp drop in durable goods consumption during the crisis also resulted in
 a decline 
in the effective stock of durables and a commensurate increase in its average age 
(see Chart
 B). In the countries that were more affected by the financial cr
isis 
(e.g.
 Italy
 and Spain), the increase in the average age of the stock of durable goods 
was much stronger, which gave rise to pent
-up demand as soon as economic 
conditions improved. As the economic recovery 
has 
progressed, households 
have 
been able to increase spending on durable goods and offset earlier losses in their 
stock of durables. Consequently, the average age of the stock of durable goods 
has 
been falling
 since 2015 
and the upward impact of pent
-up demand for durables has 
been declining. This is
 also confirmed by model
-based evidence from Spain.
15 Following a long catch
-up phase 
for
 private consumption, this can be regarded as
 a normalisation.

 Recent house price increases and housing affordability
 29 3 Recent house price increases and housing affordability
 By 
Julien Le Roux and Moreno Roma
 Euro area residential property price dynamics gained further momentum in 
2017. In the third quarter, the annual rate of change in the ECB
™s residential property 
price indicator
 was 4.4%, up from 3.9% in the previous quarter (see Chart
 A). This 
acceleration is fairly broad based across euro area countries, 
albeit
 at different 
levels
 of house price growth
, with
 two countries still exhibiting negative annual rates of 
change in the third quarter and 
another two 
with
 rates of more than 10%. The
 house 
price increases 
over the past few years may have implications
 for housing 
affordability. 
This box discusses some selected indicators of affordability.

The notion of affordability varies
 for
 different groups of households.
 Affordability essentially concerns
 housing costs relative to income. 
Whether these 
costs are affected by house price increases typically depends on how a household 

describes itself, be it as
 a buyer, an owner, or a tenant
. 
At the aggregate level, house 
prices have recently increased slightly faster than household disposable income, 

suggesting a worsening of average affordability (see Chart
 B). However, this would 
apply in the first instance to those who have recently
 bought
, or plan to buy, a house 
or 
a flat at the higher prices.

 Note
s: Income refers to household gross disposable income. The latest observations are
 for the third quarter of 2017.
 Affordability for homeowners depends to a large extent on whether they have 
debt servicing obligations.
 At the aggregate level, the debt servicing burden can 
be gauged by the ratio of interest payments to disposable income.
16 Reflecting
 low 
interest rates, this ratio has gradually decreased in the past 
few 
years across euro 
area countries (see Chart
 C). 
The effect of higher house prices has thus been 
alleviated by lower interest burdens. For households 
that
 already own
 a home
, the 
rise
 in house prices may even have increased affordability if the higher collateral 
value of the property 
reduces
 borrowing costs 
when
 housing loans
 are renegotiated
.                                                                     16  
The ratio of interest payments to disposable income disregards subsidies and tax allowances, which 
can have the effect of reducing the cost of housing.

). This suggests that, thus far, 
tenants
 have on balance experienced an 
improvement in housing affordability. However, over time, owners who have bought 
their houses and flats 
for letting out
 will want to 
recover
 the higher 
purchase price
 or 
the higher costs
 for repair and maintenance that may 
arise in
 a tightening 
housing 
market
. The recent increase in house prices may hence yet negatively impact the 
housing affordability of 
tenants
 when they enter into a new 
tenancy agreement
 or 
their existing 
leases
 are re
negotiated. Furthermore, euro area housing affordability 
for 
tenants
, 
measured by 
the share 
of 
income 
devoted to rental expenditures,
 hovered around 4% between 2013 and 2016 (

, at a time 
when the rent

the effects of

 Labour supply and employment growth
 35 Article
 1 Labour 
supply and employment growth
 By 
Katalin Bodnár
 This article examines the main factors behind the recent changes in euro area labour 
supply and how they have influenced employment developments. It finds that the 
increasing supply from older people and women, as well as immigration, have had a 

significant influence on employment growth during the economic recovery. Both 
migration and the numbers of older people and women in or seeking work have been 
driven by long
-term trends and structural changes, while migration has also been 
affected by several cyclical factors. In the medium to longer
 term, labour supply is 
expected to decline as the population ages. This calls for policies to support labour 

force and employment growth, for example by helping the long
-ter
m unemployed, 
migrants and other groups whose participation rates remain low
, to enter or return to 
the labour market, or find jobs that better match their skills.
 1 
Introduction
 Labour supply in the euro area has been increasing and its composition 
changing.
 Although labour supply growth in the euro area slowed down after the 
start of the financial crisis, the labour force is now 2% larger than before the crisis 
(see 
Chart 1). Three main factors have contributed to the increase in the euro area 
labour supply in the last few decades: an increasing number of older people and 

women seeking or in work, and immigration.
19 These changes have been influenced 
by several structural factors, for example the rising pension age, the increasing 
educational level of the population and the opening of the labour markets to 
migrants, coupled with strong labour demand in some euro area countries.
                                                                     19

 The changes are also reflected in the composition of recent euro area 
employment growth.
 Over the recovery, which has created a significant increase in 
employment, three
-quarters of the employment growth in the euro area has been 
provided by older workers. As far as the gender composition is concerned, more than 

half of the employment growth is accounted for by women. In some countries, 
immigration has also provided a considerable proportion of employment growth. 

These changes in the composition of employment coincide with a strong reliance on 
part
-time contracts
20 and increasing employment of the highly skilled (
see 
Chart 2).

 Labour supply and employment gro
wth
 37 This article considers the degree to which the developments in employment 
are driven by labour supply.
 A better understanding of the linkages between labour 
supply and employment is important for assessing employment growth over the 
recovery period, while it can also help in projecting future employment 
developments. The rem
ainde
r of the article is organised as follows. Section 2 
focuses on the reasons behind the increasing share of older workers among the 
employed, as well as the characteristics of the older workers. Section 3 describes 
the differences between male and female employment and the driving factors. A box 
explores the channels through which the changing composition of employment 

affects wage developments. Section 4 focuses on the drivers of part
-time 
employment, which is linked to both ageing and gender issues. This is
 followed by 
an examination of recent trends in migration in the euro area and the conclusions.
 2 
Older workers
 The composition of the working age population is changing, with the share of 

people over 55 rising.
 As life expectancy is increasing and fertility rates are very 
low, the share of older people in the overall population is growing. The number of 
those already in retirement 
is on the rise 
Œ 
as reflected in increasing old age 
dependency ratios, i.e. the ratio of people over 65 to those of active age.
 In the 
working age population too, the share of older people (those who are above 55) has 

been increasing in all euro area countries as the baby boom generations have 
entered this category.

 38 The labour market participation rate of older people is also increasing very 
strongly.
22 The participation rate of those above 55 is following a steady upward 
trend (see Chart 3). Increasing life expectancy as well as sustainability 
considerations after the start of the financial crisis led pension reforms to be 
implemented in several euro area countries: Germany and France before th
e crisis, 
and Italy and Spain after the crisis.
23 These reforms increased the statutory pension 
age or made early retirement difficult and thus had an upward
 impact on the 
participation rates of older people.
24 Increasing life expectancy also influences the 
length of active life through other factors, as people may decide to stay longer 
in work to avoid very long inactive periods and protect themselves against the risk of 

poverty in old age. Finally, participation rates are increasing with the level of 
educat
ion. As the share of older people with higher education is rising, compositional 

effects are also playing a role in driving up the participation rate of older people (
see 
Chart 4).

 Note: 
Prime age: 25
-54 years, older: 55
-74 years.
 Rising participation rates and demographic changes are the primary drivers of 

increasing employment
 among the older population.
 For those aged 55
 and over
, the increasing participation rate explains most of the employment increase both 
before and after the crisis; a further, considerable portion of the increase is due to 

population changes (see Charts 5
 and 6). However, the employment to labour force 

ratio is still below its pre
-crisis level in most age groups, including the over 55s, 
                                                                    22  
The participation rate is defined as the sum of the employed and the unemployed divided b
y the 
working age population.

The statutory pension age has increased in all of the largest euro area countries. The effective pension 

age, however, has only increased significantly in Germany, from 59 years in 1996 to 62.7 years in 2014 

(OECD statistics).

 39 despite a general increase since 2013. To sum up, pension reforms, the increasing 
educational level among older people
 and the growing 
number
 of older people are 
the main explanatory factors behind the strong rise in employment in this age group. 
These results do not necessarily mean, however,
 that employment of the older 
population is driven exclusively by increasing labour
 supply, as the participation rate
, 
at least,
 may 
also 
increase as a response to rising labour demand.

 40 differently. Patterns have differed from country to country. In Germany, the 
unemployment rate of older people was well above the prime
-age unemployment 
rate before the crisis, but the gap between the two rates had started to decline at the 
end of the 1990s
 and has closed in recent quarters. The unemployment rate of older 
people was kept high in part by the generous benefit system, while its decline has 

reflected the impact of several pension and labour market ref
orms.
25 In other large 
euro area countries, the unemployment rate among
 older 
people was well below that 
of the prime
-age group before the crisis. One explanation for the 
generally 
low 
unemployment rates of older people relative to other groups is that 
olde
r people
 tend 
to 
move between employment and inactivity rather than employment and 

unemployment. As a consequence, labour supply and employment move even more 
closely together in this 
age group than in other
s.

 Older workers are more likely to be employed in less cyclical sectors and 
positions than others.
 The older generations are more concentrated in public 
services, particularly in health and social services and in public administration, and 

are represented to a lesser extent in most market services sectors
, than prime
-age workers
 (see Chart 8). At the same time, the share of older workers increased in all 
of the sectors in the last decade. Older workers, 
especially
 women, are more likely to 
work in part
-ti
me positions than prime
-age workers (see Chart 9), and they account 
for the bulk of the increase in part
-time employment over the recovery period (see 
also Section 4).Temporary employment
27 is less likely for older than for prime
-age workers, and employment
 growth in the older age category over the recovery has 
been primarily driven by permanent contracts. Together these factors suggest that 
older workers are more likely
 to work in less cyclical sectors and positions than other
 worker
s. Furthermore, some of the differences may also be related to the skills 
demanded
: in some fast
-growing services sectors 
the
 need for skills 
in up-to
-date 
technologies 
is greater than in public services. An important question
 here
 is the 
relationship 
between the increasing employment of older workers and the 
employment
 of younger 
ones. There is no evidence that older workers crowd out 
younger workers in the longer term, 
while
 the employment of older workers may help 
to replace the declining labour supply in the younger age groups
.28 Moreover
, the 
                                                                    27  
Temporary employment means work under a fixed
-term contract, as against permanent work, where 
there is no end date.
 28  
The empirical literature finds no evidence of older workers crowding out younger workers in the 
longer 
term. See for example the box entitled

 Labour supply and employment growth
 42 ageing of the population has an indirect 
upward 
impact on overall employment 
growth through an increasing demand 
for
 services.
29 Finally, it is very likely that, with 
working lives becoming longer,
 older workers are staying
 longer in their 
positions 
than previously. Policy measures also support this in some countries. This may also 
have important implications for the wage development of this age group, as those 
entering a new position at older ages have different wage levels, wage growth and
 
wage bargaining power from those who remain in their positions. See also the box 
entitled

 Looking ahead, the changing age composition of the euro area population will 
imply a decline in the labour supply.
 While until now increasing participation rates 
have been able to
 counterbalance the declining numbers entering the labour force, 

this will not be the case in 
the 
future. Labour supply is projected to decline in the 
medium term (
see 
Chart 10). This, together with the increasing share of the 
population already retired, will be a major challenge. While there is room for further 

policy measures to help groups still with low participation rates to enter or stay in the 

labour market, these may also primarily be the older age groups, 
which
 may result in 
a further increase 
in 
the share of older 
people
 in the labour supply.

Gender composition of recent employment growth
 The share of female workers in the euro area has risen to a historically high 
level.
 The gap between male and female employment rates (the 
ratio
 of the 
employed to the working age population) has narrowed considerably in the last two 

decades. This was driven primarily by 
a 
strong increase in the female employment 
rate (the ratio of employed women to the female working age population), and to a 
smaller extent by a declining employment rate for men (the ratio
 of employed men to 
the male working age population) over the crisis
 period
 (see 
Chart 11). As a 
consequence, the share of women in total employment is now close to 50%.

 Female employment is influenced by several structural factors.
 The increasing 
employment of 
women
 is closely linked to the
ir rising labour market participation over 
the last 
few 
decades. This, in turn, reflects the strongly increasing educational level 
of women, policy measures to increase female employment as well as the 
greater
 role 
played by
 part
-time employment, which is discussed in the next section. Policies 
that 
have been
 found to be related to the participation of 
women
 include providing 
childcare services to working parents with small children, tax changes and leave 
policies.
30 Female
 participation rates are also influenced by cyclical factors, namely 
discouragement (
i.e. 
when the unemployed give up searching for work because they
 think that they 
will
 not find any) and the 
ﬁadded worker
ﬂ 
effect (the tendency for 
women to enter the labour market when their male partner loses his job or withdraws 

from participation), but these have had a smaller impact on female labour 
supply and 
employment 
in the euro area than structural fact
ors.
 Cyclical factors have a larger influence on male employment.
 The male 
participation rate is already very high at 70%
 in the euro area, compared with 59% 
for 
women
, and has remained broadly flat at that level in the last two decades with 
only a minor i
mpact overall 
from the crisis.
31 The dynamics of male employment are
 thus influenced 
primarily 
by demographics 
Œ 
the increasing number of older male 
workers and declining number of younger workers 
Œ 
and cyclical labour demand (as 
measured by the ratio of employment to the labour force)
, to a larger degree than the 
employment of women (
see 
Chart 12).
                                                                     30

This is different from the developments seen in the United States, where the participation rate of 
prime-
age men has declined in the last six decades. This is found to be explained by reductions in the 

demand for labour, mainly for the low
-skilled. See

 Looking ahead, the older generations are likely to continue to be the main 
source of further employment growth for both genders.
 A trend
-cycle 
decomposition of employment levels by gender suggests that the trend component 

for older female workers has been increasing much more steeply than that for older 

male workers (see Charts 1
3 
and 1
4).32 This is due to differences in educational
 level: the level
 of education is increasing more
 steeply for older 
women
 than for older 
men; thus, labour market participation and employment are also increasing faster for 

women. The rise in prime
-age female employment has already come to a halt, 
however, so further increases in female employment may come primarily from older 

women in the future.

Changes in employment composition and their impact on wage growth: an example 
based 
on age groups
 By Maarten Dossche and Gerrit 
Koester
 Changes in the composition of employment can have knock
-on effects on average wage 
growth.
 This is most evident in case of sectoral shifts, which change the employment shares of 
sectors that have different wage levels and/or dynamics. For example, 
in some services sectors 
wages tend to be lower and to grow more slowly than in industry. But other compositional changes, 
such as those related to the personal characteristics of employees, can also have an effect.

 47 One important factor for wage growth is 
the age composition of the workforce.
 Data from the 
structure of earnings survey
33 show that wages tend 
Œ 
on average 
Œ 
to be higher for older 
employees, and to increase particularly strongly in the early years of a career, and less so in the 
later phases. Different vintages of the survey indicate that this relationship between age and salary 
has been relatively stable over the last 15 years. Changes in the age structure of employment can 
therefore have substantial effects on wage growth. The main channel for
 such effects seems to be 
the different wage levels, given that the average hourly wage of an employee who is 60 or older 
(see Chart A) is more than 50% higher than 
that
 of an employee under 30. The fact that wage 
growth tends to decrease with age
 works in
 the opposite direction. However, this effect tends to be 
more gradual and is therefore often less important 
Œ 
especially in times of large cyclical fluctuations 
in participation rates or employment across age groups.
 Chart A
 Mean hourly earnings by age gr
oup (left
-hand scale: wage levels in euro; right
-hand scale: percentage changes versus the preceding age group)

 Notes: The lines refer to the left
-hand scale and show hourly earnings (in euro) for different age groups across different vintages (2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014) 
of the structure of earnings survey. The bars refer to the right
-hand scale and reflect the percentage difference in hourly earnings versus the preceding age 
bracket across the different vintages of the survey.
 In the euro area, the steady increase in the share of older employees before and after the 
crisis has supported average wage growth.
 The ageing of the baby boom generation and the 
strong increase in the participation rates of older 
people
 (see the discussion in 
Section
 2 of the 
main text) have pushed up the share of older workers in employment, and, as these are typically in 

higher wage categories, average wage growth as well. However, especially in recent years, 
the 
upward effect of an increase in the share of employees above 50 has been more muted as it has to 

a large extent reflected just the ageing of employees previously in the 40
-49 age group (see Chart 6 
in the main text), which has a wage level very similar
 to those of the age groups above 50.
34                                                                     33  
The structure of earnings survey is a four
-yearly enterprise survey on the structure of earnings in the 
EU (2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014). It provides information on the link between the level of gross 
earnings and the individual characteristics of employees (gender, age, occupation, educational leve
l). It 

also includes information about employers (economic activity, size of the enterprise, etc.). Gross 

earnings refer to the gross wages and salaries earned by full
-time and part
-time employees per hour in 
the reference month (October).

 48 Additionally, there was a cyclical decrease in the share of younger employees during the 
crisis.
 This initially had an upward effect on wage growth
: during the crisis the young and typically 
less well
-paid workers were the first to be laid off 
Œ 
which
 pushed
 up average wages. In countries 
such as Spain this effect was relatively pronounced. Since 2013, however,
 the reduction in 
employment of the younger age groups in the euro area has been reversed (see Chart 7 in the 
main text), leading to negative effects on average wage growth. This downward impact on wage 

growth is likely to persist for some time as the share of young people in employment can be 

expected to rise further.

 49 education, skills, gender, nationality and type of employment, which all have an influence on 
individual wages. This requires granular data and is complicated by the fact that the distributions of 
these characteristics are often correlated. This can be illustrated, for example, by the fact that the 

wage gap between men and women tends to increase with age (see Chart B). 
It
 also increases with 
education (see 
Chart C). To avoid a biased assessment of the total compositional effect of 
employment on wage growth requires an econometric estimation of the marginal effect of each of 

these different characteristics.
35 In the literature, one important approach aimed at making 
a comprehensive assessment of compositional effects is
 based on micro data, such as the EU 
statistics on income and living conditions, which allows the link between a broad range of personal 

characteristics and wage developments to be analysed

Labour supply 
factors
 behind part
-time employment
 One
-fifth o
f employment in the euro area is now part
-time.
 Part
-time employment 
is following a long
-term upward trend, which did not stop during the crisis but 
moderated somewhat in the subsequent recovery (see Chart 15). Increases have 
been seen in virtually all euro area countries, for both genders and all broad age 
groups. This change is also reflected in the declining trend of average hours 

worked.
37 Over the recovery, almost a third of employment growth has come from
 part
-time positions, contributing to the strong
 dynamics of headcount employment. 
To better understand developments in headcount employment as well as changes in 

hours worked, it is important to examine the factors behind the dynamics of part
-time 
employment.
                                                                     35

 Cohort effects have a major influence on the dynamics of part

employment.
 Before the crisis, prime
-age female workers made the largest 
contribution to the increase in part
-time employment, but this contribution declined 
considerably over the recovery, and growth in prime
-age female employment is now 
being driven by full
-time positions. Older workers are making a large contribution to 
the increase in part
-time employment, which is thus used as a way to stay in the 
labour market when close to or beyond the statutory retirement age.

 Note: The data are influenced by structural breaks in 2003 in France, in 2004 in Italy and in 2005 in Spain.
 Part
-time 
employment is closely linked to the increasing supply of female and 
older workers.
 In theory, the drivers of part
-time employment may be cyclical or 
structural, and both can be related to labour demand or labour supply.
39 The most 
important structural facto
rs are
, on the demand side,
 the increasing share of market 
and public services in the economy (as these sectors have a higher propensity for 
part
-time employment), and, on the supply side,
 the increasing participation of 
women and older workers. All of
 the
se factors have followed similar increasing 
trends in the euro area (
see 
Chart 17). However, it is difficult to find the direction of 
causality among them, as they 
may
 reinforce each other. While these structural 
factors, together with labour market measures to 
promote
 flexible forms of 
employment, are likely to have played a major role, cyclical factors have also 

contributed during 
both 
the crisis and the recovery. Indeed, in a recession, 
companies frequently use part
-time employment (i.e. by reducing the hours worked 
by incumbent workers) to hoard labour. They can thus decrease their firing, rehiring 
and training costs over the business cycle and prevent erosion of 
the 
skills of their 
employees. Labour hoarding indeed played a role in increasing part
-time 
employment during the crisis
.40 Finally, part
-time labour supply also changes with the 
business 
cycle. When the unemployment rate is high, finding any job may become 
more important than finding a full
-time job. Indeed, the numbers of unemployed 
looking only
 for full
-time work decreased after 2008, while the numbers of those who 
had no clear preference increased substantially (see Chart 18).
 Overall, the rise in 
part
-time employment from 2008 was primarily demand rather than supply
-driven
, as 
                                                                    39

The impact of migration on employment developments
 The analysis of
 migration suffers from several methodological and data 
issues.
 First of all, it is not clear how migrants should be defined.
42 In this article, 
migrants are defined by citizenship, while the time spent in a country and the degree 
of assimilation are not taken into account. Second, data on migration are not always 
comparable across countries,
 and time series are generally short and published with 
a significant lag. Third, an additional problem with stock variables (as opposed to 
flows) is that calculating the number of immigrant workers or the size of immigrant 
labour supply for the euro area as a whole is virtually impossible. This is due to 
the 
lack of detailed statistics on the origin of people with a migration background. In the 
light of these caveats, data on migration must be assessed with caution.
 A major part of the recent population growth in several euro area countries can 
be linked to developments in migration.
 Immigration, as measured in terms
 of 
people with foreign citizenship, has had an upward impact on
 the growth of, 
particularly, the youth and prime
-age population in the largest euro area countries 
(see Chart 19). This reflects the fact that net immigration flows have been positive in 

the euro area since data have been available (see Chart 20).
 The pattern of 
migration in the euro area has changed considerably in the last decade. Before the 
crisis, Spain was the main destination country, but recently Germany has 
received
 the largest numbers of immigrants. Several other large countries are net de
stination 
countries, while some smaller countries tend to be net senders of migrants.
                                                                     42  
Place of birth or citizenship are not necessarily the right indicators to identify those who move between 
countries. For example, some people with a foreign passport or place of birth may have moved to the 

country as a child and be very similar to nationals. At the same time, people who have left their home 

country may return after a while and may be different from both those who had remained in the country 

as
 well as foreign migrants in terms of the characteristics important for the labour market. While the 
time spent in a country and the degree of assimilation would be important to take into account, data on 

these are usually scarce.

 Migration in the euro area has been influenced by three main factors in the last 

decade.
 First, the enlargements of the EU in 2004 and 2007 resulted in a large 

inflow of workers from the new to the existing Member States; the destination 
countries included the largest euro area countries, primarily Italy and Spain.
 The 
inflow at the euro area
 level continued after the start of the crisis, owing to a large 
degree to the opening up of the German and Austrian labour markets in 2011 and 
2014 (for nationals of the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and in 2007,

 55 respectively). Second, the impact of the crisis on labour markets triggered 
large
-scale outward migration from some countries. The largest contribution came 
from Spain, which witnessed large
-scale immigration before the crisis which then 
became
 emigration, partly by pre
-crisis immigrants. I
n other countries, emigrants 
were primarily nationals, whose destination was in many cases Germany, owing to 
high labour demand in th
at country. Third, the refugee crisis has resulted in a 
considerable increase in immigration flows into
 Germany, Italy and Austria, but the 

impact on the labour force has so far remained limited.
 Immigrants in the largest euro area countries have a lower average age and 

slightly lower average educational level than nationals.
 In the largest euro area 
countries, a larger share of foreign citizens than of nationals are in the working age 
population (15
-64) (see Chart 21). This also suggests that the increase in the share 
of older workers in the working age population would have been even more 
pronounced without the recent migration flows. The average education
al level of 
foreign citizens is lower than that of nationals in all countries (
see 
Chart 22).

 Immigration in the largest countries also contributes to the growth of 
employment.
 A major part of the immigration into the euro area is aimed at finding 
employment. Participation and employment rates of immigrants
 are relatively hi
gh, 
but they tend to remain lower than for
 nationals. 
While 
those coming from EU 
countries have employment rates 
similar 
to 
or higher than those of nationals, those 
coming from outside the EU have lower employment rates
 (see Chart 23). This at 
least partially reflects differences in educational and skill levels as well as difficulties 

with
 the recognition of qualifications. According to the available data or, in the 
absence of data, estimations on the basis of the population by citizenship and the 
employmen
t rates, immigration 
has 
contributed considerably to recent employment 
growth in the euro area.

Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The working age population refers to ages 15
-64. The 
labour market situation of immigrants in Europe is less favourable than 
that of nationals.
 Immig
ration in Europe is frequently associated with down
-skilling 
Œ 
i.e. immigrants work in occupations for which a lower educational level is needed 
than they possess. This is usually explained by their lack of country
-specific skills 
and experience, as well as 
the 
time required for qualification recognition. With time, 
the difference between the skill distribution
s 
of nationals and immigrants declines, 

but gaps 
usua
lly 
remain.
43 The less favourable labour market situation
 of immigrants 
has been found to be reflected in several other indicators (for example, the share of 

temporary wo
rk is higher (
see 
Chart 24), income is lower, and living conditions and 
children
™s scor
es in the PISA knowledge and skills survey are worse). Differences 
between nationals and immigrants in terms of the degree of labour market 

integration have been found to be inherited by or in some cases enlarged for the 

descendants of immigrants in Europe
44 but not in the United 
States.
45 This suggests 
that there is 
room
 for improvement in the labour market integration of immigrants in 
the European countries.

 Immigration has influenced labour markets in the euro area through several 
channels.
 Immigration has two main impacts: first, it influences the composition of 

total employment, and second, it impacts the labour market situation of nationals. 
Empirical papers frequently find that immigrants complement nationals in the labour 
market,
46 which results in an improvement of nationals
™ labour market situation and 
wages. 
Empirical 
studies in both 
Europe and the United States
 have mostly shown 
that 
immigrants bring complementary skills, ideas and connections, and fill important 

niches in both fast
-growing and declining sectors of the economy.
47 Also, 
cross
-country evidence in OECD countries 
points 
to overall positive effects from 
immigration.
48 The complementarity of immigrants may also help nationals
 to 
increase their labour market participation, hours worked or their skill level.

Conclusions
 Labour supply in the euro area has changed considerably in the last 
few 
decades in 
terms of both quantity and composition. The changes have been complex and 
affected the age, gender and skill composition of the labour force.
 These developments have also impacted employment and unemployment over the 
recovery period. The continuation of the longer
-term trends in 
the 
labour market 
participation of older people and women, as well as recent waves of net immigration, 
have helped to meet the rising labour demand. 
The increasing employment of these 
groups also explains, at least partially, the recent developments in part
-time and 
temporary employment. Compositional effects in employment have
 also had
 an 
impact on wage dynamics.
 A reversal of the recent increase in labour supply is expected in the medium term, 
owing to the ageing of the population. Thus, policy measures will be needed to 
boost
 labour supply and employment of all age groups, to foster productivity growth despite 
the ageing workforce
, and to further enhance flexible forms of employment that give 

access to the labour markets to groups with still low participation rates.
