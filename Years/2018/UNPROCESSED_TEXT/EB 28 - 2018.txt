At its monetary policy meeting on 14
 June
 2018, the Governing Council 
concluded that progress towards a sustained adjustment in inflation had been 
substantial so far.



























































Despite a slight softening of momentum, the near
-term global outlook remains 
essentially solid, supported by accommodative monetary policies in advanced 
economies and significant fiscal stimulus in the United States.















Since the Governing Council™s meeting in March
 2018, euro area long
-term 
risk
-free rates have decreased.













The euro area economic expansion remains solid and broad
-based across 
countries and sectors, despite recent weaker than expected data and 
indicators.





























The June
 2018 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.1% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 
2020.



According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation 

increased to 1.9% in May 2018, from 1.2% in April.




















This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June
 2018 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP 
inflation at 1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020. 





The monetary analysis showed broad money 
growth 
gradually declining in the 
context of reduced monthly net asset purchases, wi
th an annual rate of growth 
of M3 at 3.9% in April 2018, after 3.7% in March and 4.3% in February.


























Based on the regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council 

made the following decisions.





















































While the global economic expansion has continued, recent data point to a slight 
softening of momentum. 
Global 
financial conditions
 have remained supportive but 
have tightened 
in some 
emerging economies. The increase in oil price
s, 
a reflection 
of still resilient global demand
 but also concerns about future supply 
in view of 
current
 geopolitical tensions, has dampened prospects in oil
-importing economies. 
Nonetheless, the near
-term global outlook remains essentially solid, supported by 
accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies 
and significant
 fiscal 
stimulus
 in the United States
. Further ahead, global activity is expected to slow
, as output is close to potential in many advanced e
conomies
. Moreover, although a 
further recovery in some commodity
-exporting economies is envisaged, 
China™s 
anticipated 
transition to a lower growth path
 should 
weigh on the outlook. 
Global 
inflation
ary pressures are expected to rise slowly as spare capaci
ty diminishes.
 Global trade growth is 
foreseen 
to remain
 resilient 
in the near
 term
. However, the 
implementation of higher trade
 tariff
s 
and the possibility of wider protectionist 
measures 
represent a 
key 
risk to global 
growth momentum.
 Indeed, the balance
 of 
risks for global activity 
and trade in the short term has worsened recent
ly, with risks 
remaining 
skewed to the downside in the medium term.
 
Following a year of strong and highly synchronised growth, global momentum 

slowed somewhat in the early part of 2018.





















In the near term, the global economic expa
nsion is expected to rebound.


















The implementation of higher trade tariffs, amid ongoing discussions of 

further protectionist measures, represents a risk to the global economic 
outlook.

The global outlook continues to be supported by 
accommodative but 
somewhat tighter monetary policies.











































Despite continued monetary accommodation, global financial conditions have 
tightened in recent weeks, particularly in emerging market economies.































































Oil prices have risen sharply in the past two months, although they have seen 

a moderation more recently.

Looking 
ahead
, broad
-based cyclical momentum is expected to support global 
activity
 in the near term
.























Over the medium term, however, the positive momentum is expected to slow 
as cyclical forces wane.












Economic Bulletin























Tur
ning to developments across countries, in the United States, activity is 
expected to rebound this year.









In the United Kingdom, economic prospects remain relatively subdued aga
inst 
the background of uncertainties related to the process of the country leaving 
the European Union.











In Japan, the economic expansion is projected to decelerate gradually.












Economic activity in central and eastern European countries is foreseen to 
remain robust.




In China, activity is projected to decelerate moderately.













Economic activity is gradually strengthening in the large commodity
-exporting 
countries.
































Recent indicators suggest a slight softening of global trade momentum in the 
near term.

Further ahead, global imports are projected to slow gradually, consistent with 

the projected cyclical deceleration in global activity.

























Overall, global growth is projected to remain broadly stable over the projection 
horizon.











































































The balance of risks for global activity has worsened in recent weeks, with 
risks judged to be 
balanced in the short
 term but skewed to the downside in 
the medium
 term.






















Global consumer price inflation has been broadly stable
 in recent months.














Looking ahead, global inflation is expected to rise in the near term.

Since the Governing Council™s meeting in March
 2018, euro area long
-term risk
-free 
rates have decreased. An uptick in market
-based measures of long
-term inflation 
expectations was balanced by a decrease in real rates. Sovereign bond spreads 
have exhibited considerable volatility since the
 second half of May, against a 
background of political uncertainty in Italy. The fluctuations in government bond 

markets have spilled over into other market segments to some extent and stock 
market volatility has increased. Equity and bond prices of euro area financial 
corporations have declined, while the impact on other market segments has 

remained limited. At the same time, stock prices of euro area non
-financial 
corporations (NFCs) have risen, reflecting a robust corporate profit outlook. In 
foreign exchange markets, the euro has depreciated in nominal effective terms.
 Long-term government bond yields have increased in the euro area and in the 
United States

Despite recent weaker than expected data and indicators, the euro area economic 
expansion remains
 solid and broad
-based across countries and sectors
 after a 
period of growth rates well above potential growth
. 
Euro area real GDP growth is 
supported pr
imarily 
by growth in private consumption and investment. The latest 
survey results and incoming data point to more moderate but
 still solid 
growth 
momentum in the near term. 
The June
 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections for the euro area
 foresee
 annual real GDP increasing by 2.1% in 2018, 
1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the March
 2018 ECB staff 

macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down 

for 2018 and remains unchanged for 2019 and 2020.
 Growth mod
erated in the first quarter of 2018, but remained solid and broad
-based across euro area countries.

The ongoing solid and broad

The June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area

2020 (see Chart
 13).










Chart

According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 
1.9% in May
 2018, from 1.2% in April. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, 
annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the current level for the 
remainder of the year. While measures of underlying inflation remain generally 
muted, they have increas
ed from earlier lows. Domestic cost pressures are 
strengthening amid high levels of capacity utilisation, tightening labour markets and 
rising wages. Uncertainty 
about the inflation outlook is receding. Looking ahead, 
underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and thereafter 
to increase gradually over the medium term, supported by the 
ECB™s 
monetary policy 
measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of 

economic slack and rising wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in 

the June
 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which 
foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020
, and HICP inflation 
excluding energy and food at 1.1%, 1.6% and 1.9% respectively.
 Headline inflation increased considerably in May.

Since the fourth quarter of 2017, broad money growth has been gradually declining 
in the context of reduced monthly net asset purchases under the asset purc
hase 
programme. At the same time, loan growth to the private sector remained on a path 
of moderate expansion, significantly supported by the pass
-through of the monetary 
policy measures put in place since June
 2014. The annual flow of total external 
financ
ing to non
-financial corporations (NFCs) is estimated to have moderated 
somewhat in the first quarter of 2018.

NFCs™ cost of financing has retur
ned to the favourable levels recorded at the 
beginning of the year.






















According to the latest 

, SMEs in 
the euro a
rea continued to signal further improvements in the availability of 
external sources of finance. They attributed these improvements mainly to 
banks being more willing to extend credit.












































The euro area budget deficit is projected to decline further over the projection 
horizon (2018
-20), mainly as a result of favourable cyclical conditions and declining 
interest payments. The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is expected to be 
mildly expansionary in 2018 and broadly neutral in 2019
-20. Although the euro area 
government debt
-to
-GDP ratio will continue to decline, it will remain elevated. In 
particular the countries with high debt levels would benefit from additional 
consolidation efforts to set their public debt ratio firmly on a downward path.
 The euro area general government budget deficit is projected to decline further 

over the projection horizon (2018

second reserve maintenance periods of 2018, which ran from 
31 January to 
13 March
 2018 and from 14
 March

 May
 2018 respectively.























In the period under review, the average daily liquidity needs of the banking 
system, defined as the sum of 
net 
autonomous factors and reserve 
requirements, stood at •

with the previous review period (i.e.
 the 
seventh
 and eighth 
maintenance 
periods of 
2017).













The 
growth
 in 
net 
autonomous factors
, which implies absorption of liquidity, 
resulted from a decrease in liquidity
-providing factors and an increase in 
liquidity
-absorbing ones.

























The day

 Exchange rate developments can play an important role in shaping the outlook 
for HICP inflation.


















The exchange rate pass

channels.


































Of the components making up the HICP excluding energy and food, 
non-energy industrial goods (NEIG) prices are the most sensitive to

effects of the exchange rate appreciation.

 The relevance of foreign direct investment (FDI) as a source of economic activity has 
increased rapidly over the last decade. Between 2000 and 2016 the share of FDI 
stock in global GDP increased from 22% to 35%. Following a decline during the 
Great Recession, mergers and acquisitions (M&As), the most dynamic component of 

FDI, have recovered, reaching a record value of USD
 1.2
 trillion in the first quarter of 
2018. The intensification of FDI activity has important implications for both origin and 

destination countries in terms of, for example,
 economic growth, productivity, wages 
and employment. Moreover, the expansion of multinational enterprises (MNEs) has 
been accompanied by the creation of complex cross
-border production chains, which 
also has important implications.
 This article presents several findings regarding the main developments in and 
determinants of FDI over the past decade, at both global and EU level. Since the 
beginning of the 2000s there has been a gradual shift in the global FDI landscape, 
with emerging market economies (EMEs) gaining in prominence both as a source of 

and as a destination for such investment.
 EMEs have attracted a growing share of 
FDI flows, reaching more than 50% of the world™s total inward FDI in 2013. In 

addition, FDI flows are dominated by a relatively small number of M&As. In 2016 

M&As with a value in excess of USD 1 billion accounted for
 only 1% of all FDI 
projects, but they generated 55% of total FDI flows. Moreover, evidence suggests 

that FDI and exports are not competing but complementary strategies for serving 

foreign markets. Finally, since 2008 EU countries are no longer the world™s
 main FDI 
investors and recipients. Nevertheless, econometric analysis shows that belonging to 
the EU dramatically boosts FDI flows in member countries.
 

The last decade has witnessed a surge in FDI.






Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6)












FDI has the potential to bring several benefits to the recipient country.












Trad
itionally, advanced economies have played a major role as both the 
source and destination of FDI.







Since 2008 there has been a dramatic change in the global FDI landscape.





This article provides an overview of the main FDI trends and drivers.

First, by investing abroad, companies may seek access to promising new 
markets.



Second, asset
-seeking FDI is driven by access to new, complementary 
resources and capabilities.








Third, FDI flows may also be driven by the desire for access to natural 

resources.

















Fourth, efficiency
-seeking FDI is mainly driven by lower labour costs and 
higher productivity.

Research confirms the important role played by institutional quality i

Finally, macroeconomic stability is another relevant driver of 
inward FDI.




Emerging countries™ MNEs (EMN
Es) have specific motivations when investing 
abroad.

























The internationalisation of EMNEs
 is affected by the policies of their national 

governments, which are often pursued via state

enterprises.

 Based on real economy indicators, such as foreign activity, the biggest MNEs still originate 

predominantly from large, advanced economies and the manufacturing sector, although 

EMNEs and the services sector are growing in importance.










The world™s largest MNEs according to the UNCTAD classification play a prominent role in 
terms of employment, sales and assets in the host countries in which they operate.













Comparing the 92 biggest MNEs from advanced economies with the 100 biggest EMNEs, on 
average the former recorded 4% higher sales per employee than the latter in 2015.

Total global FDI is dominated by a relatively small number of very large deals.

















When serving a foreign market, FDI and exports have traditionally been seen 
as substitutes.












In reality, MNEs often complement their exports by owning subsidiaries 

abroad.















Handbook of International Economics
































































First, by means
 of vertical FDI, MNEs distribute and optimise their production 

across borders.










Second, FDI can also serve as a tool for enhancing the market penetration of 

exports.






Third, MNEs also invest abroad in order to supply the host country and third 
countries directly with their products.

types of FDI

 Equity capital is among the main sources of funding for euro area non
-financial 
corporations (NFCs), making it an important factor in the transmission of monetary 
policy. From a central bank perspective, improving the measurement and 

understanding of
 the cost of equity is therefore essential.
 Unlike the cost of debt, which has declined substantially in recent years, the cost of 

equity has remained relatively stable at elevated levels. Results from the analysis 

performed in this article suggest that a persistently high 
ﬁequity risk premium
ﬂ 
(ERP) 
has been the key factor underpinning the high cost of equity for euro area NFCs. In 

fact, since the start of the global financial crisis, increases in the 
ERP
 have largely 
offset the fall in the yield of risk
-f
ree assets.
 This article argues that the widely used workhorse model to derive the cost of equity 
and the 
ERP
, namely the three
-stage dividend discount model, can be improved 
upon. In particular, incorporating short
-term earnings expectations, discounting 
payouts to investors with a discount factor with appropriate maturity
, and considering 
share buy
-backs 
all yield
 beneficial refinements. This in turn would strengthen the 
theory and basis of
 the model and improv
e 
the robustness of its estimates. Most 
notab
ly, share
 buy-back activity seems to matter, specifically for the level of the 
ERP
. 
Notwithstanding such improvements in the modelling approach, estimating the 
ERP
, 
particularly its level, remains subject to considerable uncertainty. Ultimately, such 
uncer
tainty advocates the use of a variety of models and survey estimates
, as well 
as a focus on the dynamics, rather than on the level, of the 
ERP
. From an applied perspective, the article demonstrates that cost of equity modelling 

can be used to disentangle the different drivers of changes in equity prices. This is 

helpful from a monetary policy perspective
, as changes in equity prices can contain 
important information about the economic outlook and warrant monitoring for 
financial stability purposes. Moreover, the article shows that adding an international 

perspective to the analysis of the 
ERP
 for the overall market may provide valuable 
insights for policymakers. For instance, the greater reliance on
 share buy
-backs 
among companies
 in the United States than those in the euro area
 appears to be 
behind some of the recent steeper decline in the 
ERP
 in the United States when 
compared 
with the ERP in
 the euro area.
 

While equity provides a substantial source of funding for euro area NFCs, 
calculating 
the actual cost of raising equity financing is challenging.




















From the viewpoint of a central bank, improving estimates of the cost of equity
 are de
sirable, 
primarily for three, partly inter
-related, reasons:
 The cost of equity is part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.


















Changes in the determinants of the cost of equity can reveal 
the 
views of
market participants about the economic outlook, which explains why

central banks
 use such changes
 as an indicator of the (expected) st
ate o
fthe economy.









Equity prices and
, by implication
, the cost of equity need to be monitore
dfrom a financial stability perspective.












Against this background, this article examines various methods for estimating 
the cost of equity for euro area corporations
, with a particular emphasis on the 
ERP which is the most difficult component to estimate.








































2.1
 The role of equity financing for euro area NFCs
 Various forms of equity financing have con
sistently provided a significant part 

of the funding structure of euro area NFCs.























Turning to the procurement of new funding by euro area NFCs, equity also 
constitutes a substantial source, albeit not always
 in the form of listed shares.

2.2
 Euro area NFCs™ cost of equity
 In contrast to
 the cost of

has
 to be 
estimated.

A persistently elevated

 has been the key factor underpinning the high 
cost of equity for euro area NFCs.

Unlike the credit risk premium, the 
ERP
 by its nature cannot be observed
, 
meaning that it 
has
 to be estimated on the basis of 
a 
model and by making a 
series of assumptions.





















The 
cyclically 
adjusted 
price/e
arnings
 (CAPE) 
ratio suggested by Shiller only 
provides indirect
 and imprecise information on the ERP.























Working Paper Series

Economic Policy Review













































One proposal for estimating
 the ERP 
is the Fed model, where 
the longer
-term 
risk
-free yield 
is subtracted from the inverse CAPE ratio
 Œ 
resulting in the 
so-called Fed
 spread (
see Chart
 4).











Chart

The Fed
 spread however is subject to some practical and theoretical 
shortcomings.




























The origin of a forward
-looking approach to equity valuation can be found in 
the Gordon 
growth 
model (
see Chart
 5).



future




















expectations
 








 As such, the Gordon 
growth 
model is the foundation and the simplest form of 
the class of DDMs
 Œ 
which 
link
 equity prices to expected future shareholder 
payouts, risk
-free interest rates and an additional compensation for risk.













To the extent that expected dividends, long
-term risk
-free interest rates and 
equity prices can be observed via financial market data, the 
ERP
 can be found 
by equating the discounted sum of future cash flows to the prevailing stock 
prices.



One common refinement to the Gordon 
growth 
model is the three
-stage DDM, 
which assumes that the expected dividend growth rate varies over the course 
of different phases and converges to a constant long
-term value.
























The Investment, 
Financing, and Valuation of the Corporation














This workhorse model allows for an easy estimation of the 
ERP
, which can be 
readily obtained from observed dividend yields and the risk
-free rate
.

=+
=[(1+
)+(
)]+Since short to 
medium
-term earnings expectations are often higher than 
longer
-term economic growth estimates, the resulting ERP from the 
H-m
odel approximation is higher compared 
with
 that resulting from the 
simple Gordon 
growth 
model (
see Chart
 5).











In practice, gauging estimates of expected future dividend growth is 

difficult and 
using
 aggregated analysts™ forecasts to capture shorter
-term 
growth expectations 
seems 
questionable.

From a historical perspective, and despite some decline over the past
 few
 years, the current estimate for the 
ERP
 from the H
-m
odel in the euro area 
remains fairly elevated (
see 
Chart
 5), indicating that equities are not 
particularly highly valued relative to bonds.












Chart

As demonstrated in the previous section, part of the 
appeal
 of the H
-m
odel 
derives from the possibility 
of dissecting
 drivers of changes in equity prices.


























By decomposing
 changes since early 2017 with the help of the H
-m
odel
, it can 
be observed
 that price increases in
 euro area equities mainly reflect 
improvements in earnings growth expectations for euro area firms, despite 
some bouts of volatility in recent months
 (see Chart

 Although
 the 
dividend discount model (
DDM
) 
is often implemented by approximating
 via the 
H-model, refinements are possible, as
 demonstrated in this box.
First, instead of solving the model via the H
-model 
approximation as shown in the main text, 
a more demanding yet more precise approach is to find the implied
 equity risk premium
 (ERP
) 
to minimise the difference between the model
-implied equity price and the observed 
market price.

The second modification is based on the notion that very short
-term earnings expectations 
should 
also 
be reflected in the DDM.

Third, all expected future dividends s
hould be discounted along the yield curve to match the 
discount factor with the respective timing of the expected payout.









The impact of these refinements is very small (
see Chart
 A, left
-hand side
).





The 
impact on the estimated ERP 
is greater 
if payouts to shareholders, in addition to 
dividends, also include share buy
-backs (
see Chart
 A, 
right
-hand side
).





















Although from a theoretical perspective it is important to include share buy
-backs, doing so 
is relatively complex
.







































Turning to a comparison of developments in the ERP 
in the 
United States
 and 
the euro ar
ea, the H
-m
odel suggests 
they 
moved roughly in tandem prior to 
the financial crisis, and diverged 
afterwards
 (see Chart
 7a).

Estimating the ERP with the help of the refined model
, which includes
 share 
buy
-backs
, leads to a somewhat different picture, highlighting the 
relevance
 of 
share buy
-backs
, particularly
 in US equity markets 
(see 
Chart
 7b).











































Overall, it must be emphasised
 that the estimation, especially of the level of 
the ERP, remains subject to modelling and data uncertainties.

 Headline inflation can be noisy, blurring the signal on the medium
-term inflationary 
pressure relevant for monetary policy. To help distinguish signal from noise in the 
data, central banks monitor measures of underlying inflation. As there are many 
ways of measuring underlying inflation, it is important to understand the properties of 

the various indicators and what factors may account for any divergence
 between 
them. This article describes in detail the measures of underlying inflation typically 
used at the ECB and evaluates them against a set of empirical criteria.
 

Central banks should be mainly concerned with persistent sources of 
inflat
ionary pressure and less so with short
-lived, reversible movements in the 
inflation rate.
















The central bank faces the problem of distinguishing in real time the ﬁsignalﬂ 
on medium
-term inflationary pressure contained in the HICP inflation data fr
om the ﬁnoiseﬂ stemming from temporary or idiosyncratic factors.





































The assessment of developments in measures of underlying inflation requires 
an appreciation of their respective properties a
nd needs to be followed up by 
an examination of the economic forces driving inflation.
















Against this background, this article discusses the measures of underlying 

inflation used at the ECB and evaluates their properties against a set of 

empirical criteria.

 The Supercore goes beyond a purely statistical basis by making an explicit link to 

macroeconomic conditions.










Table A
 


An item is assessed as being sensiti
ve to the output gap if the inclusion of the output gap 
improves the out
-of-sample forecast performance for that item, according to the procedure 
described below, relative to an AR(1) model.
 The methodology is implemented in the following steps.

Second, for each item, the root mean squa
red forecast error (RMSFE) is calculated as the 
average over one to four quarters ahead.













Third, the ARMSFE of the three 
alternative PC specifications is compared with the AR(1) 
ARMSFE and, if one of the PC specifications improves on the latter, then the item is included 

in the Supercore.


In the final step, the items deemed suitable for inclusion are aggregated using rescaled HICP 
weights.




It is worth noting that the Supercore series may be revised over time because of: (i)
 a change in the selection of items; (ii)
 possible changes in the relationship of the different 
items with the o
utput gap (captured by the expanding window methodology); and (iii)
 the 
sometimes very large revisions in the estimates of the output gap.




Tracking the behaviour of an index comprising those items that do not appear in the 
Supercore can also be instructive.

Further along the spectrum of econometric complexity is another frequency
-based measure referred to as the Persistent and Common Component of 

Inflation 
(PCCI), which filters out and averages the medium
-term component of 
the HICP components of individual euro area countries.

 The PCCI is a frequency exclusion measure of underlying inflation that uses time
-series 
smoothing and exploits cross
-sectional information across items and countries.

































The indicator is constructed as follows:
























The PCCI is finally obtained by aggregating all the low
-frequency common components 
using the weights of the single items in the total HICP.







The main advantage compared with exclusion measures, such as HICPX, is that the PCCI 
also includes the impact of medium
-term shocks affecting food and energy, to the extent 
that they have common effects, and, at the same ti
me, it excludes short
-term fluctuations in 
prices that are considered as ﬁcoreﬂ in the traditional exclusion measures (such as services 

prices).





Chart
