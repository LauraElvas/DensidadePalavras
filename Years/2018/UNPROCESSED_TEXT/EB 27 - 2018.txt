 Œ Update on economic and monetary developments
 Prices and costs
 16 Recent wage growth data points to a continued upward shift from a trough in 
the second quarter of 2016.
 Annual
 growth in
 compensa
tion per employee
 was 
1.8% in 
the fourth quarter of 
2017, up from 1.6% in 
the previous quarter, although
 still below its long
-term average of 2.1%. 
More recently, a
nnual growth in negotiated 
wages also increased 
further to 1.7% in January 2018
, from 1.6% i
n December
. 
While recent developments in wage growth 
are in line with 
improving labour market 
con
ditions, they may still be 
weighed 
down 
by factors such as 
previous
 low inflation
 rates
, weak productivity growth and the on
going impact of 
labour market refor
ms 
implemented in some countries during the crisis.
 Both market and survey
-based measures of long
-term inflation expectations 
remain broadly unchanged (see Chart 8).
 On 
25 April 2018, the five
-year inflation
-linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.7
1%. The forward profile of market
-based measures of inflation expectations continues to signal a gradual return to 
inflation levels below, but close to, 2%. 
These
 market
-based measures continue to 
suggest that deflation risk remains well contained. Accordin
g to the ECB Survey of 
Professional Forecasters for the second quarter of 2018, longer
-term inflation 
expectations for the euro area 
remained stable at 1.9%.

 Notes: Realised HICP data are included up to 
March
 2018. The market
-based measures of inflation ex
pectations are derived from 
HICPx (euro area HICP excluding tobacco) zero coupon inflation
-linked swaps. The latest observations are for 
25 April 
2018. Residential property prices in the euro area continued to accelerate in the 
fourth quarter of 2017.
 Acco
rding to the ECB™s residential property price indicator, 
the prices of houses and flats in the euro area increased by 4.6% year on year in the 
fourth quarter of last year, up from 4.2% in the previous quarter, confirming a further 
strengthening and broaden
ing of the house price cycle.

This article establishes stylised facts about convergence and analyses the sources 
of economic growth in central, eastern and south
-eastern European (CESEE) 
economies within and outside the European Union (EU).
 It also compares the 
performance across countries and identifies the challenges that these economies 

face on the way to further advancing convergence. Although all CESEE economies 
have converged towards the most advanced EU economies since 2000, progress 

has been heterogeneous. While some countries have experienced fast economic 
growth and a speedy catching
-up, for others the catching
-up process has been 
rather slow. Economic convergence has been much faster in the CESEE countries 
that became members of the EU (including those which later joined the euro area) 
than in the Western Balkan countries that are currently EU candidates or potential 
candidates. Convergence was particularly rapid before the global financial crisis, but 
slowed
 down thereafter.
 The article identifies several factors that are common to the most successful 
countries in the region in terms of the pace of convergence since 2000. These 
include (inter alia) improvements in institutional quality, external competitiveness and 

innovation, increases in trade openness, high or improving levels of human capital, 
and relatively high investment rates. Looking ahead, accelerating and sustaining 
convergence in the region will require further efforts to enhance institutional quality 

and innovation, reinvigorate investment, and address the adverse impact of 
population ageing. For EU candidates and potential candidates, EU accession 
prospects might constitute an anchor for reform momentum 
Œ 
in particular, but not 
exclus
ively, in the key area of enhancing institutional quality 
Œ 
and thus support the 
long
-term growth prospects and real convergence of these countries.

This article reviews the impact of the ECB™s corporate sector purchase prog
ramme 
(CSPP) on corporate bond markets and the financing of euro area non
-financial 
corporations (NFCs). It finds that the CSPP has led to a significant easing in 

financing conditions for euro area NFCs, including declines in corporate bond 

spreads, improved supply conditions in the corporate bond primary market and 
increased bank lending to NFCs that do not have access to bond
-based financing. 
The operational set
-up of the CSPP, in particular its flexibility and adaptability, 
minimises any impact that coul
d be detrimental to the functioning of the corporate 
bond market

orate bond

 Owing to the narrowing of corporate bond spreads since March
 2016, credit 
risk premia in the financial sector and in the NFC high
-yield segment have 
diminished.
 By contrast, for the investment

ent, which is covered 
by the CSPP, the ﬁexcess bond premiumﬂ (defined as the model
-based deviation of 
corporate spreads from historical regularities, taking into account their risk 
characteristics)

 Excess bond premia in the euro area by sector
 (percentages per annum)
  Sources: Thomson Reuters, Merrill Lynch and ECB calculations.
 Notes: The excess bond premium 
is the deviation of corporate bond spreads relative to the credit risk of the issuer.
 The latest 
observations are for 26
 January
 2018. Over and beyond the intended impact on corporate bond spreads, the CSPP 
also appears to have had some wider effects on N
FC financing conditions (see 
Chart
 4).
 The estimated decline in corporate bond spreads that can be directly linked 
to the CSPP implies only a few basis points decline in the weighted average cost of 
financing for NFCs, as the debt securities market account
s for only 19.2% of NFCs™ 
outstanding debt and 10.6% of their external financing volume. However, 
consideration should be given not only to the direct effect of the CSPP in lowering 
corporate bond spreads, but also to its indirect effects on other elements
 of NFCs™ 
cost of financing. An indirect metric capturing the cost of financing for corporations is 
financial conditions indices (FCIs), which are aimed at summarising information 
about the future state of the economy contained in current financial variabl
es. 
Empirical analysis suggests that FCIs are strongly influenced by changes in 
corporate bond spreads, even in cases where corporate bond spreads themselves 
do not form part of an FCI (see Chart
 5).
67                                                                     67  Two FCIs are considered. The Goldman Sachs FCI and an

This article discusses the concept of risk sharing, which generally refers to the notion 
that economic agents, such as households and firms, attempt to insure their 
consumption streams against fluctuations in the business cycle of their country, 
i.e.
 they try to ﬁsmooth outﬂ changes in their consumption resulting from economic 
shocks. The article then considers what proportion of an economic shock in the euro 
area can be smoothed, and compares this with the situation in the United States. 
While a comparison of the degree of risk sharing between
 the euro area and the 

United States needs to be seen against the background of different institutional and 
political architectures, it nevertheless offers potentially interesting economic insights. 
The article shows that, while in the euro area around 80%
 of a shock to GDP growth 
in a given country remained unsmoothed over the period 
1999-2016, thus resulting 
in sizeable differences in consumption growth across countries, in the United States 

at most 40% of a shock to state
-specific GDP was unsmoothed over
 the same 
period. The article also evaluates the relative importance of the main risk sharing 
channels, i.e.
 the credit, capital and fiscal channels, as well as the role of European 
institutions. It shows that, in the euro area, risk sharing takes place mainly via the 
capital channel, i.e. through cross
-border holdings of financial assets. Finally, the 
article puts the empirical results into the perspective of the ongoing debate on 

enhancing the institutional architecture of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). It 

calls for euro area countries to make their economies, banking sectors and public 
finances less vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. The article explains how efficient 
and integrated financial markets are a core prerequisite for effective private risk
 sharing in the euro area. It also shows how the euro area would benefit from a 
central fiscal stabilisation function to support national economic stabilisers in the 
presence of large economic shocks and thereby make EMU more resilient.
