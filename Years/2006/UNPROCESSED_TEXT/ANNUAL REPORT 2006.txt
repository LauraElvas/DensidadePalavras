10ECB Annual Report
2006On 1 January 2007 Slovenia became the 13th 
Member State to adopt the euro, and Banka 

Slovenije became the 13th NCB to join the 

Eurosystem. I would like to extend a very warm 

welcome to the Slovenian citizens and to praise 

Slovenia for its good economic performance 

thanks to the implementation of stability-
oriented macroeconomic policies over recent 

years. The currency changeover from the 

Slovenian tolar to the euro proceeded in a very 

smooth and efficient manner: 94.5 million 

banknotes were introduced, starting with a 

frontloading phase in late November 2006, and 

the period of dual circulation of both the euro 

and the tolar lasted for two weeks, after which 

time the single currency had completely 

replaced the Slovenian currency. Against this 

background, the euro was received with great 

enthusiasm by the Slovenian population.   
***The ECB™s monetary policy continued to anchor 

medium and long-term inflation expectations at 

levels broadly consistent with price stability. 

This in particular reflected the credibility of the 
ECB in conducting its monetary policy in strict 

compliance with its primary objective of 

maintaining price stability over the medium 

term. The solid anchoring of longer-term 

inflation expectations is a prerequisite for 

monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution 

towards supporting sustainable economic 

growth and job creation in the euro area. In 

2006 average annual HICP inflation was 2.2%, 

unchanged compared with the previous year. 

This is above the ECB™s definition of price 

stability of below, but close to, 2%. Although it 

reflects the oil and commodity price shocks, 

there is no room for complacency. 
Risks to price stability continued to be clearly 
on the upside throughout 2006. Notable among 

these risks were the possibility of a stronger 

than anticipated pass-through of past oil price 

increases, unanticipated increases in 

administered prices and indirect taxes, and 

renewed oil price rises. More fundamentally, 

given the very favourable economic environment 

in 2006, with an ongoing reduction in 

unemployment and a further improvement in 

labour market performance, the prospect of 

stronger than expected wage developments 

continued to pose substantial upside risks to 

price stability. In this context, and in particular 

in view of the upcoming 2007 wage rounds, the 

Governing Council stressed that wage 

agreements should take into account the still 

unacceptably high level of unemployment in a 

number of countries, as well as their present 

price competitiveness positions and yearly 

labour productivity developments.The Governing Council™s assessment that risks 
to price stability prevailed was confirmed by 

cross-checking with the monetary analysis. The 

marked dynamism of monetary and credit 

growth in 2006 reflected a continuation of the 

persistent upward trend in the underlying rate 

of monetary expansion in the euro area that has 

been observed since mid-2004, adding further 

to liquidity accumulation. Following several 

years of robust monetary growth, liquidity in 

the euro area remained ample by all plausible 

measures. In a context of continued strong 
11ECB Annual Report
2006monetary and credit growth, this pointed to 
upside risks to price stability over the medium 

to longer term.To address the upside risks to price stability 
identified by the ECB™s economic and monetary 

analyses throughout the year, the Governing 

Council adjusted the monetary policy stance in 

2006 by raising the key ECB interest rates on 

five occasions by a total of 125 basis points. As 

a result, the minimum bid rate in the main 

refinancing operations of the Eurosystem rose 

from 2.25% in January 2006 to 3.50% in 

December 2006. 
In 2006 the euro area economy expanded 
robustly. Notwithstanding the impact of high 

and volatile oil prices, real GDP rose by 2.8% 

in 2006, compared with 1.5% in 2005. The 

economic recovery gradually broadened in the 

course of the year, and the nature of the 

economic expansion became increasingly self-
sustaining, with domestic demand acting as the 

main driver. In 2006 real GDP growth was, on 

average, significantly above potential. The 

euro area continued to benefit from the 

strong expansion of the world economy, while 

substantial gains in corporate profits and an 

extended period of very favourable financing 

conditions supported investment growth and 

employment.Against this background, the Governing Council 
was of the view that, also after the rate 

adjustments in 2006, the ECB™s monetary policy 

stance remained accommodative and that firm 

and timely action continued to be warranted to 

ensure price stability over the medium term.***Fiscal developments in the euro area were 

relatively favourable in 2006. According to the 

updated stability programmes, the average 

fiscal deficit for the euro area stood at about 

2.0% of GDP, compared with 2.4% in 2005. 

However, this budgetary improvement was 

largely the result of strong output growth and 

revenue windfalls and was only in small part 
due to effective fiscal consolidation measures. 

Against the background of the current economic 

good times, it remains of the essence to sustain 

the momentum of improving public finances 

and to accelerate the pace of budgetary 

consolidation so that all countries of the euro 

area achieve their medium-term objective of a 

sound fiscal position as soon as possible. In this 

respect, it is crucial to set out additional 

concrete and credible fiscal consolidation 

measures and to ensure their swift 

implementation. Such measures have the best 

chance of success when they are based on a 

credible and comprehensive medium-term 

strategy, with a focus on reducing expenditure 

rather than increasing revenues. This helps to 

strengthen confidence in a fiscal policy that is 

both sustainable and supportive of growth and 

employment.***With regard to structural reforms, euro area 

countries have become increasingly aware over 

recent years of the necessity to adjust to the 

challenges of increased global competition, 

ageing populations and accelerating 

technological change. The importance of 

adjusting to these challenges is highlighted by 

the relatively low growth of labour productivity 

in the euro area when compared with that of the 

United States: the average annual growth of 

labour productivity between 1999 and 2006 

stood at 1.1% in the euro area and 2.2% in the 

United States. This situation requires in 

particular the very active implementation of 

structural reforms in the domain of research 

and development, education and training, and 

the completion of the Single Market. It is also 

to be noted that the reforms undertaken by a 

number of Member States in the labour market 

have started to create more job opportunities. 

As a result both of these reforms and of wage 

moderation, the euro area has seen significant 

employment growth over the recent period. 

Notably, employment in the euro area has risen 

by more than 12 million persons in the eight-
year period since the start of Stage Three of 

EMU. This compares favourably with the 
12ECB Annual Report
2006increase of little more than two million recorded 
for the same group of countries in the eight 

years before 1999. Stronger employment growth 

has also contributed to reducing unemployment 

over the last few years. While still high at a 

rate of 7.5%, towards the end of 2006 the 

standardised unemployment rate reached its 

lowest level since the series began in 1993. 

However, structural impediments continue to 

exist in the euro area and help to explain why 

unemployment rates are still unacceptably high 

and participation in the labour market is still 

low by international standards. It is therefore 

essential for each euro area country to minimise 

market distortions induced by national 

regulations and for the euro area as a whole to 

remove remaining barriers to market integration. 

This requires, in particular, sufficient wage 

differentiation, greater labour mobility and 

more flexible product, labour and financial 

markets. Further reforms will enhance the 

adjustment capacity of the euro area, foster 

economic growth and create additional 

employment opportunities.***In addition to fiscal discipline and structural 

reforms, the smooth functioning of EMU also 

rests upon European financial integration. 

By helping to promote the development of 

European financial systems, financial integration 

contributes to increasing the potential for 

economic growth. It also enhances the smooth 

and effective transmission of monetary policy, 

supports the efficient operation and smooth 

functioning of clearing and payment systems 

and contributes to financial stability. Last but 

not least, an integrated financial system plays a 

decisive role as a shock absorber in the event of 

asymmetric shocks within the euro area. The 

ECB report on indicators of financial integration, 

published in September 2006, provides a 

detailed and comprehensive analysis of the 

progress made in the various segments of the 

financial system. The ECB and the Eurosystem 

also act as catalysts for private sector initiatives 

fostering financial integration. For example, 

the ECB and nine NCBs will contribute to the 
labelling of short-term debt instruments under 

the Short-Term European Paper (STEP) 

initiative, and the ECB will regularly provide 

statistics on yields and volumes in the STEP 

market. The Eurosystem also strongly supports 

the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project, 

and fully encourages all parties concerned to 

launch the SEPA by the beginning of 2008 and 

to reach a critical mass of SEPA transactions by 

the end of 2010. The Eurosystem is providing 

assistance to the banking industry with regard 

to the design and preparation of the new SEPA 

instruments and frameworks and is urging the 

market to proceed with the timely adaptation of 

retail payment systems for processing the SEPA 

instruments.    
The Eurosystem also contributes to financial 
integration by providing infrastructures for 

payment and settlement. The TARGET2 project 

is well under way and will go live before 

the end of 2007, as scheduled. Technical 

preparations were undertaken in 2006, and the 

ECB communicated detailed information on the 

pricing scheme and on the different ways of 

participating in TARGET2. In July 2006 the 

Eurosystem decided to evaluate opportunities 

to provide settlement services for securities 

transactions. The objective of this project Œ 

called TARGET2-Securities Œ for which 

synergies with TARGET2 would be sought, is 

to allow the harmonised settlement of securities 

in euro in central bank money.
The Eurosystem continued to contribute to the 
stability of the financial system in the euro area 

and in the EU by monitoring and assessing 

major sources of risk and vulnerability, 

contributing to policy discussions at the 

European and international levels on the main 

regulatory and supervisory issues, and 

enhancing its framework and operations for the 

management of possible financial crises.***The total number of budgeted staff positions for 

2006 was 1,343 full-time equivalent (FTE) 

positions. This compares with 1,369 FTE 
13ECB Annual Report
2006positions for 2005. In September 2006 the first 
six participants in the ECB™s Graduate 

Programme, which is aimed at recent graduates 

with a broad educational background, joined 

the Bank on the basis of two-year 

non-convertible contracts.In 2006 the ECB introduced general principles 
for mobility, which encourage members of staff 

to change position after every five years of 

service. Internal mobility represents an 

opportunity for staff to broaden their expertise 

and a means to increase synergies across 

business areas. In 2006 more than 80 members 

of staff moved internally to other positions. 

With staff from the 27 EU Member States, the 

ECB has integrated diversity management into 

its human resources practices, launching a 

diversity policy in 2006. 
In addition to promoting mobility, the human 
resources strategy continues to focus on the 

development of ECB staff and management. 

Managerial and leadership skills continued to 

be strengthened through training and individual 

coaching. Following the launch of the diversity 

strategy, a specific training course for managers 

on ﬁdignity at workﬂ was implemented. 
At the level of the Eurosystem, the Human 
Resources Conference, which was established 

in 2005 with the aim of further promoting the 

cooperation and team spirit among Eurosystem/
ESCB central banks in the field of human 

resources management, further extended its 

work in 2006, in particular as regards different 

aspects of staff training and development.
***Progress continued to be made in the planning 

of the ECB™s new premises. Following the 
Frankfurt am Main, March 2007Jean-Claude Trichet
architects™ optimisation of their design, the 
project moved into a planning phase in 2006. 

The City of Frankfurt, in collaboration with the 

ECB, continued to prepare a legally binding 

land use plan for the new premises. The process 

of submitting a request for the building permits 

is expected to be finalised by the end of October 

2007, as scheduled. Construction is envisaged 

to start in early 2008, with finalisation foreseen 

by the end of 2011. A memorial and information 

space to commemorate the Grossmarkthalle™s 

role in the deportation of Jewish citizens will 

also be constructed.***In 2006 the ECB earned a surplus of •1,379 

million, compared with a surplus of •992 

million in 2005. As in 2005, an amount 

equivalent to the surplus was set aside in a 

provision against foreign exchange rate, interest 

rate and gold price risks, leaving no net profit. 

The provision will be used to cover losses 

arising from the exposure to these risks, in 

particular valuation losses not covered by the 

revaluation accounts. The size of the provision 

will be reviewed annually.
CHAPTER 1ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS ANDMONETARY POLICY
16ECB Annual Report
2006KEY ECB INTEREST RATES INCREASED FURTHER 
IN 2006In the course of 2006 the Governing Council 

increased the key ECB interest rates to address 

upside risks to price stability identified on the 

basis of both its economic and monetary 

analyses. This withdrawal of monetary 

accommodation took place in an environment 

of robust economic growth, strong money and 

credit expansion and ample liquidity in the euro 

area. In a series of 25 basis point rate increases, 

the Governing Council raised the minimum bid 

rate of the main refinancing operations of the 

Eurosystem by a total of 125 basis points, from 

2.25% in January 2006 to 3.50% at the end of 

the year (see Chart 1).As regards price developments, average annual 
HICP inflation was 2.2% in 2006, unchanged 

compared with 2005. The headline inflation 

rate fluctuated over the course of the year and 

was strongly influenced by movements in the 

price of oil. Until August it followed an 

increasing trend, remaining significantly above 

the ECB™s definition of price stability of below, 

but close to, 2%. This was mainly owing to 
substantial increases in energy prices, but also 

partly to rises in administered prices and 

indirect taxes. In the remaining months of 2006, 

by contrast, the annual inflation rate fell below 

2%, largely as a result of the significant decline 

in oil prices and base effects. Notwithstanding 

the favourable momentum of real GDP growth 

and positive signs from labour markets, the 

development of labour costs in the euro area 

remained moderate throughout 2006, in part 

reflecting strong global competition, particularly 

in the manufacturing sector. This helped to 

dampen inflationary pressures. Longer-term 

inflation expectations remained solidly 

anchored at levels broadly consistent with price 

stability. Nonetheless, the risks to price stability 

remained clearly on the upside, in particular 

risks of a stronger than anticipated pass-through 

of past oil price rises, additional increases in 

administered prices and indirect taxes beyond 

those already announced, and the possibility of 

renewed oil price increases. More fundamentally, 

the prospect of stronger than expected wage 

developments and potential second-round 

effects in wage and price-setting behaviour in 

the wake of past oil price increases continued 

to pose substantial upside risks to price stability,

2006especially given the very favourable economic 
environment and improving labour market 

performance.As regards economic activity, the euro area 
economy expanded robustly during 2006. 

Following a gradual and still moderate economic 

recovery in the second half of 2005, the 

expansion of economic activity in the euro area 

gained momentum in the first half of 2006. 

Economic growth gradually became more 

broadly based and increasingly self-sustaining, 

with domestic demand Œ in particular fixed 

investment Œ as the main driver. In 2006 on 

average, real GDP growth was above potential. 

Throughout the year, the external environment 

supported a sustained economic expansion. 

Euro area exports benefited from the continued 

strong expansion of the world economy, 

especially in the economies of the euro area™s 

main trading partners. Investment growth 

became increasingly dynamic in the course of 

the year, benefiting from the extended period of 

very favourable financing conditions, corporate 

balance sheet restructuring and considerable 

gains in profits. Consumption growth in the 

euro area also strengthened in the course of 

2006, in line with developments in real 

disposable income as employment growth 

recovered and the unemployment rate declined. 

Overall, notwithstanding the impact of high 

and volatile oil prices, real GDP rose by 2.8% 

in 2006, compared with 1.5% in 2005 and 1.8% 

in 2004. Short-term risks to the outlook for 

economic growth remained broadly balanced 

for most of the year, while medium to longer-

term risks continued to lie on the downside 

throughout 2006, relating mainly to possible oil 

price rises, global imbalances and potential 

protectionist pressures. 
Monetary and credit growth remained very 
robust over the course of 2006, mainly reflecting 

the stimulative effects of the low level of 

interest rates in the euro area and the strength 

of economic activity. Viewed from a medium-

term perspective, the marked dynamism of 

monetary and credit growth in 2006 reflected a 

continuation of the persistent upward trend in 
the underlying rate of monetary expansion 

observed since mid-2004 and added further to 

the accumulation of liquidity. Indeed, following 

several years of robust monetary growth, 

liquidity in the euro area remained ample by all 

plausible measures, which in an environment of 

continued strong monetary and credit growth 

pointed to upside risks to price stability over 

the medium to longer term. 
To contain the upside risks to price stability, 
as identified through both the economic and 

monetary analyses of the ECB, the Governing 

Council adjusted the monetary policy stance in 

2006 by raising the key ECB interest rates on 

five occasions. It stressed that, also after these 

rate increases, the ECB™s monetary policy 

stance remained accommodative, with interest 

rates remaining at low levels, money and credit 

growth strong, and liquidity ample by all 

plausible measures. The Governing Council 

expressed the view that acting in a firm and 

timely manner was warranted to ensure price 

stability over the medium term. The anchoring 

of medium to long-term inflation expectations 

which results from such a commitment is a 

prerequisite for monetary policy to make an 

ongoing contribution towards supporting 

sustainable economic growth and job creation.In the course of 2006 the communication of 
both the Governing Council™s decisions and its 

broader assessment of the economic situation 

had an impact on market expectations as regards 

the outlook for short-term interest rates. The 

Governing Council clearly communicated 

throughout the year that future policy actions 

remained conditional on its regular assessment 

of risks to price stability and on the confirmation 

of its main scenario. Financial markets seem to 

have fully understood this message. Thus, in 

line with the macroeconomic data released, 

which on balance confirmed the Governing 

Council™s scenario, market expectations for 

short-term interest rates adjusted gradually 

upwards over the year as it became clearer to 

the market that the initial rate increase in 

December 2005 would be followed by a gradual 

withdrawal of monetary accommodation. 
18ECB Annual Report
2006Market uncertainty decreased further in 2006, 
with volatility declining to fairly low levels, 

notwithstanding a temporary rise over the 

summer period in the context of a global 

repricing of risk. Overall, compared with 

longer-term historical averages, market 

uncertainty relating to future monetary policy 

decisions reached a relatively low level.MONETARY POLICY DECISIONS IN GREATER 

DETAIL
At the start of 2006 economic conditions were 

relatively favourable. Real GDP growth had 

started to strengthen and broaden in the second 

half of 2005. Although quarter-on-quarter real 

GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2005 was 

considerably lower than that recorded for the 

third quarter, sentiment indicators suggested 

that the underlying trend of economic growth 

was relatively robust. In fact, the data available 

at the beginning of 2006, in particular survey 

data, confirmed the Governing Council™s 

assessment that the expansion of economic 

activity was progressively strengthening and 

broadening and would continue to do so in the 

first few months of the year, supported in 

particular by stronger domestic demand.The outlook for economic growth remained 
relatively favourable, owing mainly to a very 

strong recovery in investment growth and 

gradually improving labour market conditions. 

In March 2006 the ECB staff macroeconomic 

projections for economic growth were 

consequently revised upwards in comparison 

with the December 2005 Eurosystem staff 

projections, predominantly reflecting a 

somewhat stronger outlook for private 

investment over the projection horizon. Average 

annual real GDP growth was projected to be in 

a range between 1.7% and 2.5% in 2006 and 

between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2007. Forecasts by 

international organisations and private sector 

institutions gave a broadly similar picture.As regards the development of prices, annual 
HICP inflation was above 2% at the start of 
2006 and was expected to remain so in the short 

run, the precise levels depending largely on 

future energy price developments. Beyond the 

short term, announced changes in indirect taxes 

and the indirect effects of past oil price increases 

were expected to have a significant upward 

impact on inflation, despite the assumption that 

wage moderation would continue. In March 

2006 the ECB staff macroeconomic projections 

for inflation were revised slightly upwards 

compared with the December 2005 Eurosystem 

staff projections. Average annual HICP inflation 

was projected to be between 1.9% and 2.5% in 

2006 and between 1.6% and 2.8% in 2007. 

Risks to this outlook for price developments 

remained on the upside, relating in particular to 

possible second-round effects of past oil price 

rises.Given the strength of monetary growth in an 
environment of ample liquidity in the euro area, 

the monetary analysis confirmed the signals 

from the economic analysis that upside risks to 

price stability prevailed. Notwithstanding signs 

of a resumption of the unwinding of past 

portfolio shifts into monetary assets, the annual 

growth rate of the monetary aggregate M3 

remained robust and, looking through the short-
term effects generated by such portfolio 

behaviour, the underlying trend of monetary 

expansion remained strong, reflecting the 

stimulative impact of the low level of interest 

rates. Moreover, as regards the counterparts of 

M3, credit expansion strengthened further, with 

borrowing by households Œ especially loans for 

house purchase Œ and non-financial corporations 

rising at a marked pace.Overall, against the background of upside risks 
to price stability over the medium term, as 

indicated by both the economic and monetary 

analyses of the ECB, the Governing Council 

further adjusted the accommodative stance of 

monetary policy by raising the key ECB interest 

rates by 25 basis points on 2 March 2006. The 

Governing Council took the view that, by acting 

in a timely fashion, it was helping to keep 

medium and long-term inflation expectations 

solidly anchored at levels consistent with price 
19ECB Annual Report
2006stability and thereby making an ongoing 
contribution to sustainable economic growth 

and job creation. In particular, it emphasised 

that interest rates across the maturity spectrum 

remained at very low levels in both nominal 

and real terms and that the ECB™s monetary 

policy remained accommodative. 
In the following months, notwithstanding a 
temporary rise in market volatility in May in 

the context of a global repricing of risk, 

incoming information confirmed the Governing 

Council™s view that an adjustment of the ECB™s 

accommodative stance in March had been 

warranted to address upside risks to price 

stability. With real GDP growing by 0.6% on a 

quarter-on-quarter basis in the first quarter 

(which was later revised upwards to 0.8%), 

incoming data confirmed the view that growth 

was broadening and becoming more sustained. 

At the same time, HICP inflation rose to 2.5% 

in May, mainly as a result of energy price 

developments. Inflation rates were projected to 

remain above 2% in 2006 and 2007. In the June 

Eurosystem staff projections, the range for 

HICP inflation in 2006 was revised slightly 

upwards compared with the March ECB staff 

projections, to between 2.1% and 2.5% from 

between 1.9% and 2.5%, with risks to the 

outlook for price developments remaining on 

the upside.The monetary analysis also continued to point 
to upside risks to price stability over the medium 

to longer term. In a context of further 

acceleration of monetary and credit growth, the 

annual growth rate of loans to the private sector 

reached double-digit levels. In particular, 

borrowing by households Œ especially in the 

form of mortgage loans Œ and by non-financial 

corporations continued to grow very strongly. 

These developments further confirmed that the 

stimulative impact of low interest rates remained 

the dominant factor behind the high underlying 

rate of monetary expansion. 
Overall, a cross-check of the outcome of the 
economic analysis with that of the monetary 

analysis confirmed that upside risks to price 
stability over the medium term prevailed. Thus, 

the Governing Council decided to increase the 

key ECB interest rates by a further 25 basis 

points on 8 June. The Governing Council 

emphasised that a further withdrawal of 

monetary accommodation remained warranted 

if its assumptions and baseline scenario were 

confirmed. 
In June and July 2006, incoming data further 
confirmed the Governing Council™s assessment 

that economic growth had both regained 

momentum and become more broadly based in 

the first half of the year. Sentiment indicators 

remained very strong and employment growth 

robust. Furthermore, the conditions continued 

to be in place for real GDP in the euro area to 

grow at around its potential rate. At the same 

time, inflation rates remained significantly 

above 2% in June and July and were projected 

to be above that level on average in both 2006 

and 2007, with risks to this outlook continuing 

to be on the upside. Given the ongoing 

strong dynamism of monetary growth in an 

environment of already ample liquidity, signals 

from the monetary analysis confirmed the 

outcome of the economic analysis that upside 

risks to price stability prevailed over the 

medium term. In order to contain these risks 

and preserve the firm anchoring of longer-term 

inflation expectations, the Governing Council 

decided on 3 August 2006 to increase the key 

ECB interest rates by another 25 basis points. It 

also stressed the need to further monitor very 

closely all developments so as to prevent the 

risks to price stability from materialising.In the course of the third quarter, incoming 
data on economic activity in the euro area 

confirmed that a significant acceleration in the 

economic expansion had taken place over the 

previous quarters. On the basis of revised data, 

economic activity had grown at an average 

quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.7% from the third 

quarter of 2005 to the second quarter of 2006, 

which was well above most estimates of the 

potential rate. In addition, the unemployment 

rate had been on a declining trend, employment 

growth had strengthened and employment 
20ECB Annual Report
2006expectations derived from business surveys had 
remained favourable. Available indicators for 

the third quarter of 2006 further supported the 

assessment that economic activity would 

continue to expand at a robust pace, while 

possibly moderating from the very strong 

growth rates seen in the first half of the year. 

Overall, the conditions remained in place for 

the euro area economy to grow at solid rates 

around potential. Accordingly, in the September 

2006 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, 

the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 

2006 and 2007 were again revised upwards 

compared with the preceding Eurosystem staff 

projections, to between 2.2% and 2.8% in 2006 

and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2007, reflecting 

mainly the stronger than anticipated growth 

recorded in the first half of the year.
HICP inflation rates remained at levels above 
2% in July and August, and in the September 

ECB staff macroeconomic projections average 

annual inflation was projected to lie between 

2.3% and 2.5% in 2006 and between 1.9% and 

2.9% in 2007. These projections represented 

upward revisions. The range for 2006 moved 

into the upper part of the range published in the 

June Eurosystem staff projections and the range 

for 2007 also shifted slightly upwards, reflecting 

mainly the upward revision of the projection 

assumption for oil prices. Later in September 

the picture changed somewhat as a result of a 

significant decline in oil prices in August and 

September and favourable base effects. This led 

to a marked decline in headline inflation rates, 

to below 2% from September onwards. However, 

the view continued to prevail that inflation was 

likely to rise again to levels above 2% towards 

the end of 2006 and in early 2007, mainly due 

to the impact of higher indirect taxes and, to a 

lesser extent, unfavourable base effects. The 

Governing Council thus took the view that a 

considerable degree of short-term volatility in 

the annual HICP inflation rate was likely, but 

that, on average, inflation would remain at 

levels above 2% in 2006 and 2007. Risks to 

price stability were seen clearly on the upside, 

a view confirmed by the cross-check with the 

monetary analysis.All in all, these developments led the Governing 

Council to decide on 5 October 2006 to raise 

the key ECB interest rates again by 25 basis 

points. The Governing Council stressed that it 

would remain warranted to further withdraw 

monetary accommodation if its baseline 

scenario was further confirmed.Incoming information, in particular strong 
survey indicators for the fourth quarter of 2006, 

underpinned the reasoning behind the Governing 

Council™s decision to increase interest rates in 

October. It also further confirmed the assessment 

that economic activity was continuing to expand 

robustly, with domestic demand remaining the 

main driver in the third quarter. This confirmed 

the anticipated broadening of the economic 

recovery and pointed to a more self-sustaining 

nature of economic expansion in the euro area. 

Looking ahead to 2007, the conditions remained 

in place for the euro area economy to grow at 

solid rates around potential. While some 

volatility in the quarterly growth rates seemed 

likely to emerge around the turn of the year, 

associated with the impact of changes in indirect 

taxes, the medium-term outlook for economic 

activity remained favourable. This outlook was 

also reflected in the December 2006 Eurosystem 

staff macroeconomic projections, which 

embodied upward revisions compared with the 

September ECB staff projections, mainly 

reflecting the assumption of lower energy prices 

and their impact on real disposable income. 

Average annual real GDP growth was projected 

to be between 1.7% and 2.7% in 2007 and 

between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008.As regards price developments, annual HICP 
inflation remained below 2% in the last quarter 

of 2006. Given the downwardly revised 

assumptions for energy prices, the range for 

HICP inflation in 2007 in the December 

Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections 

was somewhat lower than in the September 

ECB staff projections. Average annual HICP 

inflation was projected to be between 1.5% and 

2.5% in 2007 and between 1.3% and 2.5% in 

2008. The outlook for price developments 

remained subject to upside risks. In addition, a 
21ECB Annual Report
2006cross-check of the outcome of the economic 
analysis with that of the monetary analysis 

continued to support the assessment that upside 

risks to price stability prevailed over the 

medium to longer term.Against this background, the Governing Council 
decided to increase the key ECB interest rates 

by another 25 basis points on 7 December 2006. 

It said that, also after this rate increase, the 

ECB™s monetary policy stance remained 

accommodative, with the key ECB interest 

rates remaining at low levels, money and credit 

growth strong, and liquidity in the euro area 

ample by all plausible measures. The Governing 

Council therefore expressed the view that it 

would be warranted to act in a firm and timely 

manner to ensure price stability over the 

medium term. It also said that it would monitor 

very closely all developments so that risks to 

price stability over the medium term did not 

materialise.22ECB Annual Report
20062.1 THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC 
ENVIRONMENT
WORLD GROWTH MODERATED BUT REMAINED 
ROBUST
In 2006 the global economy continued to 

expand at a robust pace, despite some gradual 

moderation in the growth momentum. Strong 

growth in all major regions in the first half of 

the year was followed by some deceleration in 

the second half, notably in the United States 

(see Chart 2). Overall, however, world growth 

remained at levels very close to those reached 

in 2004 and 2005, benefiting in particular from 

continued favourable financing conditions, a 

healthy profit situation and significant 

improvements in corporate balance sheets 

throughout most of the world™s economies. In 

addition, robust growth in some large emerging 

economies, coupled with strong trade activity, 

contributed to the robust pace of the global 

expansion. Even though growth became more 

balanced across the major industrialised 

economies, international external imbalances 

tended to increase further, mainly as a result 

of the energy-trade surpluses of oil-exporting 

countries.Oil prices remained at elevated levels in 2006. 
After a historical high of USD 78 per barrel 

in early August, the price of Brent crude oil had 

retreated by December to around USD 60, the 

level prevailing at the end of 2005. In 2006 

headline consumer price inflation, largely 

mirroring developments in energy prices, 

peaked during the summer and subsequently 

declined. Underlying inflationary pressures 

remained overall relatively contained in 2006 

in most countries. In general, global inflation 

rates remained very close to levels reached in 

2004 and 2005. For the countries of the OECD, 

annual headline CPI inflation was 2.6% for the 

year as a whole, and annual inflation excluding 

food and energy was 2.0%. 
In the United States, the annual rate of growth 
in real GDP for 2006 as a whole stood at 3.3%. 

In the course of the year, however, economic 

activity decelerated, with GDP growth falling 
below its potential rate. This slowdown stemmed 

largely from a decline in residential investment, 

while growth in private consumption was 

resilient. While household spending was 

negatively affected by the slowdown in the 

housing market and high energy prices, it was 

supported by robust labour income growth and

2006favourable financing conditions. Non-residential 
business investment grew robustly, buttressed 

by favourable financing conditions and high 

levels of corporate profitability. The contribution 

of net trade to growth in 2006 was zero. 
The external balance deteriorated during 2006 in 
comparison with 2005. The widening of the 

goods deficit accounted for the bulk of the 

deterioration, reflecting solid growth in household 

consumption. Nevertheless, export activity 

showed some signs of improvement, reflecting 

the strength of economic growth in the rest of the 

world as well as the depreciation of the real 

effective exchange rate of the US dollar. 
In the United States the annual rate of change 
in the CPI for 2006 as a whole was 3.2%. 

Consumer price inflation rose in the first half of 

the year on account of high resource utilisation, 

significant increases in energy prices and an 

acceleration in the owner-equivalent rent 

component of the CPI. After reaching a peak in 

the summer, inflationary pressures subsequently 

receded, with annual CPI inflation standing at 

2.5% in December. The annual rate of inflation 

excluding energy and food followed a broadly 

similar pattern, reaching a ten-year high of 

2.9% in September and subsequently recording 

a gradual moderation. Lower inflation rates 

towards the year™s end may have reflected the 

easing of underlying price pressures as a result 

of more subdued aggregate demand growth as 

well as lower energy prices. 
In the first half of 2006 the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve 

System increased the federal funds rate target 

by a total of 100 basis points in four consecutive 

25 basis point steps. This increase brought the 

target for the federal funds rate to 5.25% on 

29 June. While keeping the target for its policy 

rate constant throughout the remainder of the 

year, the FOMC repeatedly noted in its 

statements that some inflationary risks 

remained, although any additional tightening of 

the policy stance would depend on the evolution 

of the macroeconomic outlook. As regards 

fiscal policy in the United States, the federal 
budget deficit declined in the fiscal year 2006 

compared with 2005, primarily owing to 

increased corporate and personal tax revenues. 

According to estimates by the Congressional 

Budget Office, the federal budget deficit stood 

at 1.9% of GDP in the fiscal year 2006. 
In Japan, the economic recovery continued 
in 2006, with real GDP growing at 2.2% 

after 1.9% in 2005. GDP growth remained 

above potential for the third consecutive year. 

Economic activity was supported by a rapid 

expansion in private non-residential investment 

and the continuing strength of exports. The 

robustness of non-residential investment mainly 

reflected favourable financing conditions, 

rising corporate profits and strong business 

confidence. All in all, the domestic demand 

recovery was resilient, notwithstanding a 

significant slowdown in private consumption 

growth in 2006 as compared with the previous 

year. Export activity benefited from the 

stimulating effect of the weaker yen and 

stronger demand for machinery and equipment. 

Reflecting the improvement in the balance 

sheets of Japanese banks and their restored 

risk-taking capacity, as well as the effects of the 

ongoing recovery, bank lending increased in 

2006 for the first time in ten years. 
Deflationary concerns eased further in Japan in 
2006. The annual rate of change in consumer 

prices returned to positive territory in the course 

of the year. Inflation remained subdued, 

however, owing to persistent downward 

pressures, especially on wages. For the year as 

a whole, the annual rate of change in consumer 

prices was 0.3% after -0.3% in 2005. In March 

2006 the Bank of Japan ended its quantitative 

easing policy, which had been in place since 

March 2001, and in July raised its target for the 

uncollateralised overnight call rate from zero to 

0.25%. In 2006 the Bank of Japan withdrew 

excess liquidity from the banking sector, and 

the level of current account balances held at the 

Bank of Japan by Japanese private banks 

decreased significantly, from JPY 31 trillion in 

March to around JPY 10 trillion at the end of 

the year. 
24ECB Annual Report
2006In emerging Asia, growth remained strong in 
2006 owing to resilient domestic demand, 

especially in the region™s largest economies, 

despite decelerating external demand in the 

second half of the year. Price pressures were 

contained by monetary policy tightening 

measures across most of the region and, after 

the summer, by falling oil prices. Exchange rate 

developments were divergent: in real effective 

terms, the currencies of Korea, Thailand and 

Indonesia appreciated during 2006, whereas the 

currencies of other emerging Asian countries 

either depreciated (e.g. Hong Kong SAR and  

Taiwan, Province of China) or remained broadly 

unchanged (China, India and Malaysia). At the 

same time, foreign exchange reserves continued 

to grow in several economies in the region.Focusing on China, the economy continued to 
grow strongly in 2006. Economic activity 

accelerated in the first half of the year on the 

back of a rebound in manufacturing, real estate 

and local government investment coupled with 

strong exports. Fixed capital investment and 

industrial value added growth moderated 

slightly in the second half of 2006 as a result 

of monetary policy tightening, including 

administrative measures, but overall GDP 

growth was almost unaffected. Inflationary 

pressures remained low but strengthened 

towards the end of the year. Following the 

introduction of a more flexible exchange rate 

regime in 2005, the Chinese renminbi continued 

to appreciate gradually but steadily against the 

US dollar in 2006, whereas it depreciated 

against the euro. The current account surplus 

exceeded the previous record level reached in 

2005, contributing to the increase in China™s 

foreign exchange reserves, which reached a 

cumulative level of more than USD 1 trillion. 
In Latin America, economic growth remained 
dynamic, supported by the continued favourable 

external environment (including high prices for 

the commodities exported by the region) and 

robust domestic demand. Among the major 

economies in Latin America, Argentina 

continued to post high real economic growth 

rates, although persistently high inflation posed 
a challenge to the authorities. The pace of 

economic expansion in the region™s leading 

economies, Brazil and Mexico, was more 

moderate albeit still robust, especially in the 

latter case, while inflation was contained. Many 

Latin American economies continued to take 

advantage of the still benign international 

financing conditions to engage in active debt 

management operations, in part through outright 

buybacks as well as swaps, in a bid to reduce 

debt servicing costs and improve maturity 

profiles. Coupled with improved economic 

fundamentals, this helped to bring about a 

further reduction in financial vulnerability 

across the region. 
COMMODITY PRICE DEVELOPMENTS IN 2006Oil prices rose sharply for most of 2006 (see 

Chart 3), with the price of Brent crude oil 

reaching a new historical high of USD 78 per 

barrel at the beginning of August (approximately 

35% higher than at the start of the year). 

However, they subsequently declined 

substantially and, amid considerable volatility, 

reached USD 61 at the end of the year. The 

average price of Brent crude oil was USD 65 in 

2006, which is approximately 20% above the 

average of the previous year.

25ECB Annual Report
2006Global oil demand growth, which had led to 
capacity constraints throughout the oil supply 

chain since mid-2003, eased somewhat during 

2006 compared with the previous years. This 

was mainly due to weaker oil demand from 

OECD countries, which partly offset the 

increase in demand from non-OECD countries, 

in particular China. However, prices were 

pushed up by other factors that emerged on the 

supply side. In particular, the surge in oil prices 

over the first seven months of the year reflected 

mainly supply disruptions and heightened 

concerns over the security of future oil supplies 

at a time when oil market fundamentals were 

already tight. Such fears were aggravated by 

the continuing geopolitical tensions in the 

Middle East Œ in particular with respect to 

Iran™s nuclear stand-off and the outbreak of 

fighting between Israel and Lebanon. 
After their early-August peak, however, oil 
prices declined substantially as the receding 

threat from hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, a 

noticeable moderation in geopolitical tensions 

and an easing of petrol market tightness took 

some pressure off oil markets. The fall in prices 

prompted the Organization of the Petroleum 

Exporting Countries (OPEC) to announce in 

October a 1.2 million barrel per day output cut 

from November, which was followed by the 

decision in December to further cut supply by 

0.5 million barrels per day from February 2007. 

However, an unusually mild start to the winter 

in most parts of the northern hemisphere, which 

had a dampening effect on demand for heating 

fuels, and limited compliance by OPEC with 

the announced cut exerted some downward 

pressure on prices towards the end of 2006 and 

particularly in early January 2007. Prices 

rebounded in the second half of January, 

reflecting colder weather conditions in the 

northern hemisphere and resultant higher 

demand, lower OPEC supply and increased 

geopolitical concerns.The prices of non-energy commodities increased 
considerably throughout 2006, amid some 

volatility. Non-energy commodity prices as 

measured by the Hamburg Institute of 
International Economics aggregate index (see 

Chart 3) soared in the first half of the year, 

supported mainly by surging metals prices. 

Solid demand from emerging Asian economies, 

in particular China, high energy prices, limited 

production growth and low inventory levels 

pushed most industrial metals prices higher. 

After reaching a peak in May, non-energy 

commodity prices subsequently declined 

somewhat but remained at elevated levels by 

historical standards. Higher agricultural prices 

also contributed to a high non-energy commodity 

price level towards the end of the year. In 

aggregate terms, non-energy commodity prices 

(denominated in US dollars) increased by an 

average of approximately 26% in 2006 compared 

with the previous year. In early 2007 the prices 

of non-energy commodities continued to 

increase, with the total price index reaching a 

new nominal high towards the end of February.
2.2 MONETARY AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS 
M3 GROWTH CONTINUED TO RISE, MAINLY 
DRIVEN BY THE LOW LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES 

AND THE STRENGTHENING OF ECONOMIC 

ACTIVITY 
In 2006 monetary growth continued to rise, 

reaching at the end of the year the highest 

annual rate recorded since the start of Stage 

Three of EMU. Strong M3 growth was mainly 

driven by the low level of interest rates and the 

strength of economic activity in the euro area, 

which also supported vigorous private sector 

credit expansion. At the same time, rising 

interest rates started to affect monetary 

developments over the course of the year, 

although largely through substitution among 

the components of M3 rather than by curtailing 

overall M3 growth. Overall, the continued 

strengthening of monetary growth contributed 

further to the already ample liquidity situation 

and, in conjunction with strong credit expansion, 

pointed to upside risks to price stability over 

the medium to longer term. 
After having declined in the fourth quarter of 
2005, M3 growth accelerated in the first months 
26ECB Annual Report
2006of 2006, with the annual rate of growth reaching 
8.6% in the second quarter. Annual M3 growth 

moderated temporarily in the third quarter, 

before strengthening again to 9.0% in the fourth 

quarter. The December outturn of 9.8% 

represented the highest annual growth rate 

recorded since the start of Stage Three of EMU. 

Generally, developments in annual M3 growth 

were characterised by a rather high degree of 

volatility in 2006. The high variation was also 

visible in shorter-term dynamics of M3 (i.e. the 

annualised one-month, three-month and six-
month rates of growth), implying that the 

variability of the annual rate was not mainly 

related to base effects. 
As regards developments in the components of 
M3, in the first half of 2006 the largest 

contribution to annual M3 growth came from 

the expansion of overnight deposits contained 

in the narrow monetary aggregate M1, as had 

been the case in 2005. By contrast, in the second 

half of the year time deposits (which are 

included in the wider aggregate M2, but not in 

M1) made the largest contribution. Turning to 

the counterparts of M3, the strength of monetary 

expansion in 2006 was driven by the robust 

growth of MFI credit to the private sector, 

which, however, started to moderate slightly at 

the end of the year. At the same time, the 

pronounced declines in the net external asset 

position of MFIs observed up to the end of 2005 

faded away in the first months of 2006. Towards 

the end of the year significant increases in the 

flow of net external assets were recorded, which 

appeared to have contributed to the further rise 

in annual M3 growth. 
Overall, developments in 2006 suggest that the 
observed vigorous monetary growth was mainly 

driven by the low level of interest rates and the 

strength of economic activity in the euro area. 

These dynamic developments can be seen as a 

continuation of the upward trend in money 

growth witnessed since mid-2004, which 

reflected the steady rise of the annual rate of 

growth of loans to the private sector (see 

Chart 4). This suggests that the factors behind 

the strong M3 growth in recent years, including 
2006, differ from those underlying the strong 

M3 growth observed between 2001 and early 

2003. In the latter case, portfolio shifts into 

monetary assets stemming from the heightened 

geopolitical, economic and financial uncertainty 

prevailing at that time were the main factor 

driving monetary expansion, while private 

sector loan growth was subdued. Viewed in this 

light, the current strength of M3 growth may be 

of greater concern in terms of the assessment of 

risks to price stability than that observed 

between 2001 and early 2003. 
DIFFERING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MAIN 

COMPONENTS OF M3 
On the components side, the annual growth rate 

of M1 declined significantly in 2006, despite a 

small increase at the end of the year, from 

10.3% in January to 7.5% in December (see 

Chart 5). Although the contribution to annual 

M3 growth fell to 3.5 percentage points at the 

end of 2006, it remained significant. Among the 

liquid assets contained in M1, the annual growth 

rate of holdings of currency in circulation was 

11.1% in December, down from 13.5% in 

January, in line with expectations of a

adjustment of holdings of banknotes and coins 

following the euro cash changeover in January 

2002. However, the main factor underlying the 

significant decline in M1 growth, especially in 

the second half of the year, was the markedly 

lower annual growth in overnight deposits, 

which stood at 6.9% in December 2006 after 

9.7% in January. 
By contrast, the annual growth rate of short-term deposits other than overnight deposits 

(M2-M1) strengthened markedly over the 

course of 2006, from 6.4% in January to 11.8% 

in December. The contribution of these other 

short-term deposits to annual M3 growth 

increased to 4.3 percentage points at the end of 

2006, making them the most important 

contributor. This higher contribution more than 

offset the lower contribution from M1 and 

reflected a significant rise in the annual growth 

rate of short-term time deposits (i.e. deposits 

with an agreed maturity of up to and including 

two years), which grew by 27.3% in the year to 

December, by far the highest growth rate of this 

component of M3 since the start of the series in 

1998. By contrast, the annual growth rate 

of short-term savings deposits (i.e. deposits 
redeemable at notice of up to and including 

three months) declined strongly during the 

year.
The divergent developments in the dynamics of 
the short-term deposits included in M3 in 2006 

were, to a large extent, explained by the 

widening spreads between the remuneration of 

time deposits (which has increased broadly in 

line with money market interest rates since late 

2005) and that of overnight deposits (which, in 

line with historical patterns, reacted more 

slowly and more modestly to the increase in 

market rates) (see Chart 6). This prompted a 

shift out of overnight deposits into time 

deposits, thereby reducing M1 growth while 

having little impact on the growth of M3 as a 

whole. Overall, these developments showed 

that the rises in key ECB interest rates since 

December 2005 had a noticeable impact on 

monetary developments in 2006, although 

mostly in the form of substitution among the 

components of M3 rather than by constraining 

M3 growth. 
The annual growth rate of marketable 
instruments (M3-M2) also increased strongly in 

2006, standing at 12.4% in December after

20063.2% in January (see Chart 5). As a result, 
the contribution of these instruments to 

the annual growth rate of M3 rose markedly 

to 1.7 percentage points at the end of 2006, 

although this concealed quite different 

developments in the sub-components. The 

annual growth rate of money market fund 

shares/units was slightly negative in the first 

half of 2006, before turning positive in the 

second half of the year. The strengthening of 

growth in money market fund shares/units over 

the course of the year might reflect a partial 

normalisation of demand for these instruments 

after a prolonged period of exceptionally low 

growth as the portfolio shifts (which had 

resulted in excessive holdings of these assets 

between 2001 and early 2003, a period of 

heightened economic and financial uncertainty) 

unwound, with investors shifting to more liquid 

instruments. 
Demand for debt securities with a maturity of 
up to two years increased markedly in 2006, 

accounting for most of the rising contribution 

to annual M3 growth from marketable 

instruments. The elevated growth rates of these 

short-term debt securities were related, in part, 

to the rises in short-term interest rates over the 

course of the year. Short-term debt securities 

are predominantly issued at floating rates, a 

feature which permits investors to benefit from 

interest rate increases before the maturity of the 

security.
1 The annual growth rate of repurchase 
agreements also strengthened somewhat 

between the first and the second half of 2006, 

amid considerable short-term volatility. 
A sectoral breakdown of short-term deposits 
and repurchase agreements (i.e. the broadest 

aggregation of M3 components for which 

reliable information is available by holding 

sector) reveals that households remained the 

main contributors to the strong monetary growth 

in 2006. This reflects the household sector™s 

large share of the total stock of these short-term 

deposits. The annual growth rate of households™ 

money holdings has been on a steady uptrend 

since early 2004 (see Chart 7), despite strong 

returns on competing assets (such as equities 
and housing) over the recent years, but has 

remained markedly lower than the growth rates 

of the other money-holding private sectors. 
In 2006 the annual growth of non-financial 
corporations™ money holdings was close to 

10%, accounting for around one-quarter of the 

vigorous growth in short-term deposits and 

repurchase agreements. Strong profitability, 

robust business investment and high merger 

and acquisition (M&A) activity were the main 

factors behind the strong corporate demand for 

liquid assets.2The relatively high degree of volatility 

in overall M3 growth in 2006 was 

mostly attributable to developments in the 

deposit holdings of non-monetary financial 

intermediaries other than insurance 

corporations and pension funds (i.e. the 

ﬁother financial intermediaryﬂ or OFI sector). 

OFIs have become significantly more important

This development is related to financial 

deregulation and liberalisation and the 

associated development of deeper and more 

liquid securities markets. The growing 
importance of OFIs has been particularly 

visible since mid-2004 (see Box 1 for a 

discussion of the increased role of OFIs in 

shaping monetary dynamics). 
Box 1
THE ROLE OF OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES IN MONETARY DYNAMICS
Money held by non-monetary financial intermediaries has become significantly more important 

in the analysis of monetary developments over the past decade.1 This is particularly true for the 
ﬁother financial intermediaryﬂ (OFI) sector, i.e. non-monetary financial intermediaries other 

than insurance corporations and pension funds. In part, the increased importance of this sector 

for monetary analysis reflects financial liberalisation and innovation and the associated 

development of deeper and more liquid securities markets. The growing significance of the OFI 

sector has been particularly visible since mid-2004, as reflected in its contributions to the 

annual growth rate of short-term deposits including repurchase agreements (referred to here as 

M3 deposits) Œ the broadest aggregation of M3 components for which a breakdown by sector 

is available. In 2006 the OFI sector™s contribution to the 8.1% average annual growth rate 

amounted to 1.8 percentage points. Against this background, this box considers the role of OFIs 

in monetary dynamics in the past few years. 
The nature of the OFI sector and its demand for money
OFIs typically provide financial services to households and non-financial corporations and/or 

trade in financial markets on their own behalf. The OFI sector also includes institutions created 

by MFIs to facilitate the securitisation of loans on the MFI balance sheet. The OFI sector is 

thus heterogeneous, consisting of a range of very different entities, such as investment funds; 

corporations engaged in lending, leasing and factoring; financial vehicle corporations (FVCs); 

and securities and derivatives dealers. This heterogeneity has implications for the financial 

relationship between OFIs and MFIs, and thus for the pattern of money holdings across OFIs. 

While leasing companies are more likely to be net borrowers from the MFI sector, investment 

funds and factoring firms will typically be net depositors. For other institutions belonging to 

the OFI sector, such as FVCs, the net position with MFIs is less clear-cut.
OFI demand for money appears to reflect portfolio motives and is thus determined by the 
relative rates of return available on money, bonds, equities and real assets (such as physical 

capital, commodities and land). Moreover, OFI transaction demand for money is likely to be 

closely related to the need to settle financial transactions, rather than to the purchase of goods 

and services.1 See the article entitled ﬁSectoral money holding: determinants and recent developmentsﬂ in the August 2006 issue of the ECB™s
 Monthly Bulletin.30ECB Annual Report
2006OFI holdings of MFI deposits and loans 
In order to assess how the nature of OFIs and their motives for holding money are reflected in 
monetary developments, it is instructive to look at their contributions to developments in the 

components of M3 (short-term deposits and repurchase agreements) and in the counterparts of 

M3 (longer-term deposits and MFI loans). 
Looking first at the components of M3, the close link between OFI deposit holdings and capital 
market developments is reflected in the sizeable share of repurchase agreements (repos) in 

OFIs™ overall M3 deposit holdings. Repos account for around one-quarter of the OFI sector™s 

total M3 deposit holdings, a much larger share than observed for the non-financial private 

sector. Repurchase operations are undertaken in order to borrow securities and/or to procure 

liquidity. Many strategies in the modern financial engineering employed by institutional 

investors would be difficult to implement without their use. 
However, the significant contribution of repos to the annual growth rate of OFI M3 deposits in 
2005 (see Chart A) also reflects, in part, the migration of credit institutions™ money market 

activities from direct interbank trading to electronic trading platforms. Several of these trading 

platforms are operated by securities clearing houses and thus form part of the OFI sector.
2 From an economic perspective, transactions previously undertaken over the counter between 

MFIs but now conducted via an OFI-owned platform remain interbank business. From a 

statistical perspective, however, they now give rise to asset and liability positions with OFIs

When it comes to assessing the implications of monetary growth for macroeconomic 

developments, a correction should clearly be made for such distortions.More recently, OFI holdings of M3 deposits have been driven to a greater extent by their 
holdings of short-term time deposits (deposits with an agreed maturity of up to and including 

two years). This development is also visible for the deposit holdings of the non-financial 

private sector and is likely to reflect a shift of funds from overnight deposits with a low yield 

into increasingly well-remunerated short-term time deposits with only a slightly longer maturity. 

In the case of OFIs, there is some evidence that the increase in these deposit holdings may be 

linked to MFIs™ anticipation of the ﬁBasel IIﬂ framework, in the sense that MFIs have been 

conducting additional synthetic securitisations using FVCs which parked funds as time deposits 

during the transaction.Looking at the counterparts of M3, the growth of OFI holdings accounts for most of the annual 
growth of MFI longer-term deposits (around 90% in 2006; see Chart B) and thus explains an 

important share of the developments in MFI longer-term financial liabilities (excluding capital 

and reserves), which consist of MFI debt securities issued with a maturity of over two years 

and deposits with an agreed maturity of over two years or redeemable at notice of over three 

months. The strong growth in longer-term deposits reflects factors related to changes in the 

nature of financial intermediation.The growing use of securitisation Œ a process in which FVCs are crucially involved Œ is an 
example of such factors. When a securitised loan is removed from an MFI balance sheet and 

transferred to an FVC balance sheet (i.e. a ﬁtrue saleﬂ securitisation takes place), there is 

typically no immediate impact on developments in MFI longer-term financial liabilities. 

However, when the securitised loan remains on the MFI balance sheet (i.e. synthetic 

securitisation), the risk is transferred to the FVC, which issues asset-backed securities and 

typically invests the proceeds in safe assets most likely including MFI longer-term deposits or 

MFI longer-term debt securities (for which no sectoral holding information is available).
3 Regulatory changes, for example related to the introduction of the International Accounting 

Standards, and tax changes in euro area countries have encouraged MFIs to undertake more 

synthetic securitisation in recent years and have hence triggered more OFI-held MFI longer-

term financial liabilities. 
On the counterparts side, OFIs also influence monetary developments through their demand 
for loans. The contribution of OFIs to the annual growth of loans to the private sector increased 

from ½ percentage point in mid-2004 to 1¼ percentage points in the second half of 2006. OFIs™ 

demand for loans has been mainly centred on maturities below one year and to a lesser extent 

on maturities above five years (see Chart C). The short-term nature of OFIs™ borrowing suggests 

that, in part, the loans have been taken out in order to bridge a financing gap. In the process of 

synthetic securitisation, for example, such short-term loans may be used to balance cash flows 

between the acquisition of the assets and the finalisation of the longer-term financing. A second 
3 Whether this implies a net impact on monetary aggregates depends on who the acquirer of the asset-backed security is and how 
the 
purchase is financed. For instance, if the asset-backed security is purchased by a non-resident, this will in the first instance result 
in an increase of deposits of the OFI sector and an improvement in the MFI net external asset position. However, if for instanc
e the 
asset-backed security is purchased by an insurance corporation which finances the acquisition with short-term deposits, and the FVC 
keeps the funds in safe and highly liquid assets, then the impact would be neutral on aggregate monetary developments.32ECB Annual Report
2006source of strong demand for short-term loans 
by OFIs has resulted from the migration of 

direct interbank trading to electronic trading 

platforms. The interposition of an electronic 

trading platform results in the separation of 

a repo operation into two independent 

transactions: the original repurchase agreement 

and an offsetting transaction (a ﬁreverse 

repurchase agreementﬂ), which in effect 

represents a short-term loan by an MFI to the 

trading platform. 
OFI demand for longer-dated loans probably 
reflects the activities of financial corporations 

engaged in lending to the non-financial sector, 

although in some cases FVCs involved in 

securitisation may also have borrowed funds 

with maturities of over five years.Implications of OFI money holdings for 

risks to price stabilityOFI money holdings tend to be of a somewhat different nature to those of households or non-

financial corporations. Hence, the impact of OFI money holdings on economic activity and 

prices may be less obvious. However, the OFI sector cannot be disregarded altogether in the 

analysis of inflationary risks stemming from monetary developments, as OFIs affect 

developments in the economy through their financial linkages with other sectors, to the extent 

that they enable firms or households to modify their spending and saving patterns. In that 

respect, OFI money holdings are very likely to contain information relevant in the medium to 

longer term that would be overlooked if the money-holding sector were analysed without this 

group.The information content of monetary aggregates rests on the fact that they subsume the complex 
substitution processes which occur among a large variety of assets and have an impact 

on unobservable liquidity and risk premia. These premia affect the ability of households 

and firms to borrow or lend, i.e. to bring forward or delay expenditure. Owing to their 

professional risk management, OFIs may undertake transactions, for instance providing 

liquidity by buying mortgage and corporate loan portfolios or through factoring, which are 

deemed too risky by non-specialised investors. To a certain extent, the recent growth in deposits 

and loans of OFIs may reflect a one-off structural adjustment in the working of the financial 

system. However, cyclical effects related to the low level of interest rates Œ inducing a search 

for yield Œ may be reinforcing the attractiveness of certain liquidity-providing investments 

by OFIs. 
Empirical evidence suggests that the developments in deposit holdings of OFIs increase the 
short-term volatility in monetary growth and may thus complicate the assessment of underlying 

monetary dynamics. Moreover, the broader sectoral coverage of the monetary aggregate reduces 

the closeness of the co-movement between trend money growth and inflation. However, the

2006evidence also indicates that the underlying developments in a broader monetary aggregate 
including OFI deposit holdings allow turning-points in inflation to be identified earlier.
4 This 
finding suggests that OFI deposit holdings may contain information not provided by other 

sectors and which may be relevant for the assessment of the risks to price stability.
To conclude, over the past decade, OFIs have become significantly more important for monetary 
developments. The deepening of global financial markets in conjunction with the ongoing 

processes of financial integration and innovation in the euro area suggest that their importance 

will rise further. OFI money demand therefore needs to be analysed and assessed carefully, in 

order to extract in real time the signal from monetary developments that is relevant for assessing 

risks to price stability. On the basis of the data provided by MFIs, this analysis and assessment 

is not fully possible. More comprehensive data are in the process of being compiled.

GROWTH OF MFI CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR 

STRENGTHENED FURTHER
On the counterparts side, monetary dynamics in 

2006 mainly reflected the strong growth in MFI 

credit to the private sector (see Chart 8). In 

particular, the annual growth rate of MFI loans 

to the private sector increased significantly at 

the start of 2006 and then hovered around a rate 

of somewhat more than 11% for most of 2006. 

Towards the end of the year, private sector loan 

growth started to show some signs of 

moderation, albeit at still vigorous rates. The 

continued strong demand for loans was 

supported by the low level of interest rates, 

favourable credit supply conditions as reported 

in the Eurosystem™s bank lending survey, 

stronger economic activity and robust property 

market developments in many parts of the euro 

area. The slight deceleration of loan growth at 

the end of the year suggests that the rises in key 

ECB interest rates may have started to gradually 

influence borrowing dynamics. 
The strong dynamism of MFI loans to the 
private sector was broadly based across the 

main money-holding sectors, although the 

sectoral developments exhibited somewhat 

different patterns during the year. In the first 

half of 2006 the largest contribution to private 

sector loan growth reflected demand from the 
household sector. However, the growth of loans 

for house purchase moderated from May 2006 

onwards as mortgage rates rose and housing 

markets cooled in some parts of the euro area,

M334ECB Annual Report
2006while loans to non-financial corporations 
accelerated further, possibly associated with 

the continued strength of business investment 

and M&A activity (for more details, see the 

sub-section below regarding the demand for 

external financing of non-financial 

corporations). As a result, in the second half of 

the year, the largest contribution to loan growth 

came from the non-financial corporate sector. 
Among the other counterparts of M3, the annual 
growth of MFI longer-term financial liabilities 

(excluding capital and reserves) remained 

strong in 2006 and even strengthened towards 

the end of the year.
The annual flow in the net external asset 
position of MFIs fluctuated in a relatively 

narrow band around zero during the first three 

quarters of 2006, implying that the dampening 

effect from the pronounced declines in the net 

external asset position of MFIs on annual M3 

dynamics observed in the second half of 2005 

faded away. Balance of payments data suggest 

that the broadly neutral developments in the 

net external asset position of MFIs in the first 

three quarters of 2006 concealed a gradual 

strengthening in both net portfolio investment 

and foreign direct investment in the euro area. 

This was mostly linked to an improved economic 

outlook for the euro area since the beginning of 

the year, the appreciation of the euro exchange 

rate relative to the US dollar, and the narrowing 

of the interest rate differential between the 

United States and the euro area at the short end 

of the yield curve over the course of the year. 
Towards the end of 2006 the annual flow in the 
net external asset position of MFIs turned 

strongly positive and appeared to have exerted 

an upward impact on annual M3 growth in the 

last two months of the year. The strong rise in 

capital inflows into the euro area towards the 

end of 2006 may have partly reflected the 

prevailing expectations of a strengthening of 

the euro exchange rate. 
LIQUIDITY REMAINED AMPLE
The continued strong growth of M3 over the 

course of 2006 added to the already ample stock 

of liquidity in the euro area. Available indicators 

of the liquidity situation continued to rise (see 

Chart 9). Both the nominal money gap, which 

is defined as the difference between the actual 

level of M3 and the level of M3 that would have 

resulted from constant M3 growth at its 

reference value of 4½% since December 1998, 

and the real money gap, which corrects the 

nominal money gap for the excess liquidity that 

has been absorbed by past price developments 

(i.e. the cumulated deviation of inflation rates 

from the ECB™s definition of price stability), 

rose markedly further in 2006. At the end of the 

year both measures stood at their highest levels

to some extent arbitrary.

and did not show any clear signs of levelling 

off. 
The ECB has also regularly published money 
gaps constructed on the basis of an adjusted M3 

series, which attempts to correct for the 

estimated impact of portfolio shifts into 

monetary assets triggered by the heightened 

economic and financial uncertainty seen 

between 2001 and 2003.3 As there was no sign 
of a further unwinding of past portfolio shifts 

following the temporary resumption in the 

fourth quarter of 2005, these adjusted measures 

continued to move in parallel with the 

corresponding money gaps based on the official 

M3 series also in 2006. Nevertheless, the money 

gap measures derived from the corrected series 

remained significantly lower than those based 

on the official M3 series. When assessing these 

indicators of the liquidity situation, it should be 

kept in mind that they are only estimates and 

thus inevitably imperfect and should, therefore, 

be treated with caution. 
Notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding 
individual estimates, the overall picture painted 

by these indicators points to further accumulation 

of liquidity in 2006, tending to confirm the 

view that liquidity is ample. 
MONEY MARKET RATES INCREASED, FOLLOWING 

THE RISES IN KEY ECB INTEREST RATES 
During 2006 money market rates rose across 

the entire maturity spectrum, in line with the 

increases in key ECB interest rates which took 

place during the year. The smooth evolution of 

money market interest rates, together with their 

generally low level of volatility, suggests that 

monetary policy actions were well anticipated 

by market participants, reflecting the 

transparency and predictability of the ECB™s 

policy decisions. 
After two and a half years of maintaining key 
ECB interest rates at historically low levels, in 

December 2005 the Governing Council raised 

key interest rates by 25 basis points. During 

2006 the Governing Council increased the key 
ECB interest rates in steps of 25 basis points on 

five further occasions. In line with these 

increases in key ECB interest rates, money 

market interest rates across the entire maturity 

spectrum rose steadily over the course of the 

year. On 2 March 2007 the one and twelve-

month interest rates stood at 3.79% and 4.05% 

respectively, i.e. 139 and 119 basis points 

higher than in early January 2006. 
Looking more closely at developments during 
the course of 2006, money market rates at 

longer maturities rose until the beginning 

of November (see Chart 10). In November 

longer-term money market interest rates 

declined slightly, reflecting expectations of 

some deceleration in the Governing Council™s 

withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation. 

However, money market interest rates increased 

again in December, in particular after the 

last Governing Council meeting of 2006, and 

broadly stabilised after the turn of the year. In 

contrast with these developments, shorter-term 

interest rates increased continually throughout 

the year, not showing any temporary reversal of 

this upward trend. 
Between January and mid-May 2006 the slope 
of the money market yield curve, as measured 

by the difference between the twelve-month 

and one-month EURIBOR, steepened, to reach 

71 basis points on 12 May. The slope then 

flattened, stabilising at around 50 basis points 

over the period from July to October 2006. A 

marked further flattening of the curve was also 

observed from the first week of November 2006 

until the days preceding the Governing Council 

meeting on 7 December 2006, as the twelve-
month rate temporarily declined. Following the 

7 December Governing Council meeting, the 

slope of the money market yield curve steepened 

progressively and stabilised at around 45 basis 

points after the turn of the year, before declining 

to around 30 basis points at the beginning of 

March 2007. 
36ECB Annual Report
2006The interest rates implied by three-month 
EURIBOR futures give a broadly similar 

picture. These rates increased steadily between 

January and November 2006, with the only 

exception being the period between mid-May 

and the end of June 2006 (see Chart 11). In 

November 2006 these rates declined, but 

then rose again markedly in December. On 

2 March 2007 the three-month futures interest 

rate for the June 2007 contract stood at 3.97%, 

i.e. 81 basis points higher than at the beginning 

of January 2006. 
During 2006 the implied volatility derived from 
options on three-month EURIBOR futures was 

generally subdued. Implied volatility declined 

progressively between January and December, 

suggesting a high degree of predictability of the 

ECB™s monetary policy decisions to money 

market participants. The only two exceptions 

were the slight rise in volatility seen in May 

and a broad stabilisation observed between the 

end of October and the beginning of December 

associated with the above-mentioned uncertainty 
surrounding future moves of key interest rates 

ahead of the December meeting of the ECB™s 

Governing Council. After this meeting, implied 

volatility declined steadily following a negative 

trend which was reversed only a few days prior 

to the March 2007 meeting of the Governing 

Council. 
EURO AREA LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS 

REBOUNDED IN 2006In 2006 long-term bond yields in the euro area 

continued to rebound from the historically low 

levels seen in late 2005. Overall, euro area ten-
year government bond yields increased by 

70 basis points in 2006 towards 4.0% at the end 

of the year (see Chart 12). This rebound in 

long-term interest rates seemed to mainly 

reflect increasing optimism by investors as 

regards the growth outlook for the euro area 

economy. Supporting this view, the yield on 

index-linked government bonds maturing in 

2015 Œ a measure of long-term real interest 

rates Œ picked up by 60 basis points between the 

end of 2005 and end-December 2006. By

2006contrast, ten-year break-even inflation rates, 
which measure market participants™ inflation 

expectations and related risk premia, changed 

little overall in that period. 
In the first half of 2006 long-term bond yields 
rose sharply on both sides of the Atlantic. In 

both the euro area and the United States, bond 

yields with ten years™ maturity increased by 

about 80 basis points between end-December 

2005 and end-June 2006. Apart from the usually 

strong international interest rate linkages, the 

upturn in euro area long-term interest rates also 

reflected market reactions to data releases on 

economic activity and business sentiment, 

which investors generally interpreted as 

pointing to improving euro area growth 

prospects. Consistent with such an interpretation, 

the relatively strong rebound in nominal bond 

yields in the first half of 2006 was mainly 

driven by an increase in the real interest rate 

component. Towards the end of June, however, 

the general upward trend in US and euro area 

bond yields came to an end. 
The subsequent drop in long-term bond yields 
in the third quarter, which again proceeded in a 
highly synchronised fashion on both sides of 

the Atlantic, was partly related to the 

international stock market turmoil that started 

in May and led global investors to turn 

temporarily to the relative safety of liquid fixed 

income products. In addition, the strong increase 

in oil prices in the light of geopolitical tensions 

in the Middle East might have affected the 

global outlook for growth. At the same time, it 

is likely that emerging signs of a slowdown in 

the US economy, which were pushing US 

interest rates markedly down across the entire 

maturity spectrum, also affected euro area long-

term bond yields to some extent through the 

usually strong international transmission of 

bond market shocks. Towards the end of 2006 

euro area long-term bond yields rebounded 

amid favourable data releases on economic 

activity in the euro area.  
Despite the overall increase in euro area long-term bond yields, the euro area yield curve 

flattened in 2006. This is reflected in a 

corresponding decline of the ﬁterm spreadﬂ, 

measured by the difference between the yield 

on a ten-year government bond and the three-
month EURIBOR. The euro area term spread 

declined by some 50 basis points in the course 

of 2006 and reached the relatively low level of 

about 30 basis points by the end of the year. The 

flattening of the euro area yield curve in 2006 

proceeded in a gradual fashion along with the 

five consecutive increases in key ECB interest 

rates. Historically, a low Œ and particularly a 

negative Œ term spread (an ﬁinverted yield 

curveﬂ) has often heralded a subsequent 

slowdown in economic activity or even a 

recession. However, the flattening of the euro 

area yield curve in 2006 has to be interpreted in 

the light of risk premia included in long-term 

bond yields. Bond market risk premia seem to 

have reached extraordinarily low levels over 

the last two years. When taking into account the 

low levels of bond market risk premia, the term 

spread at end-2006 no longer appears to be very 

low.

38ECB Annual Report
2006In 2006 market participants™ long-term inflation 
expectations and related risk premia, as 

reflected in break-even inflation rates, seemed 

to remain broadly unchanged overall and stable 

across horizons at levels slightly above 2% per 

annum. Information about inflation expectations 

and related risk premia at specific horizons can 

be obtained from the decomposition of ten-year 

break-even inflation rates into five-year break-
even rates and five-year implied forward rates 

five years ahead extracted from estimated term 

structures of break-even inflation rates (see 

Chart 13).5 The decomposition shows that 
relatively stable medium to long-term inflation 

expectations, reflected by the sideward 

movement of five-year implied forward break-
even rates five years ahead, were associated 

with more volatile developments in short to 

medium-term inflation expectations. In fact, in 

the first half of 2006 short to medium-term 

inflation expectations measured by the five-
year break-even inflation rate increased by 

some 30 basis points. This increase in short to 

medium-term inflation expectations in the 

context of a rise in oil prices was almost 

compensated for by a corresponding decline in 

the second half of 2006. Consequently, in the 

second half of 2006 the euro area break-even 

inflation curve flattened considerably (see 

Chart 13). 
Euro area implied bond market volatility 
increased somewhat in May and June 2006 and 

then declined steadily in the second half of the 

year. The temporary increase in implied bond 

market volatility in May and June seemed to 

reflect an increase in market participants™ 

uncertainty about future interest rate movements 

in view of the stock market turbulence at this 

time. In the last quarter of 2006 euro area 

implied bond market volatility declined to 

historically low values, indicating a rather low 

level of market participants™ uncertainty 

regarding near-term developments in long-term 

bond yields. 
In the first two months of 2007 euro area long-term bond yields remained broadly unchanged 

overall and stood at 4% on 2 March. During 
that period, euro area long-term bond yields at 

first increased further to about 4.2% by mid-
February and experienced a decline thereafter. 

US long-term bond yields also declined in the 

second half of February. These developments 

seemed to result, to a large extent, from ﬁflight 

to safetyﬂ portfolio shifts towards long-term 

government bonds in the light of the turmoil on 

the global stock market at the end of February.
EURO AREA STOCK PRICES INCREASED STRONGLY 

IN 2006Euro area stock prices, despite some fluctuations, 

increased strongly in 2006, thereby continuing 

the upward trend that began in early 2003 (see 

Chart 14). The Dow Jones EURO STOXX index 

ended the year with a gain of 20% with respect 

to the end of 2005, and thereby outperformed 

both the Standard & Poor™s 500 index and 

the Nikkei 225 index. The strong performance 

of the euro area stock market relative to the US 

and Japanese stock markets has to be seen in

2006the light of a relatively strong appreciation of 
the euro against the US dollar and Japanese yen 

in 2006. The dampening effect of the euro 

appreciation on the profit outlook for euro area 

firms in export-sensitive sectors appears to 

have been more than offset by the robustness of 

actual and expected earnings growth of euro 

area companies against the background of a 

strongly improving economic outlook for the 

euro area economy. The recent period of fast-

growing stock prices differs from the second 

half of the 1990s as price-earnings ratios have 

remained closer to their long-run average 

values.The strong overall performance of the euro area 
stock market in 2006 masks a temporary but 

marked decline in stock prices in the second 

quarter of the year. Following the double-digit 

increase in stock prices in the first four months 

of the year, euro area stock prices started to 

decline at the beginning of May and depreciated 
by about 13% over the next month in the wake 

of global stock market turmoil. Indicating 

turbulent market conditions, implied stock 

market volatility in the United States and the 

euro area increased significantly in May and 

June to levels not seen since 2003 and 2004 

respectively (see Chart 15). In addition to the 

increase in perceived stock market uncertainty 

as indicated by implied volatility, market 

participants also appeared to have reduced their 

risk appetite during the period of market 

turbulence. In the absence of significant 

deteriorations in fundamentals, changes in 

investors™ risk appetite and risk perceptions 

therefore seem to be the most likely explanation 

for the temporary drop in stock prices seen in 

the second quarter of 2006. This view is 

consistent with the fact that the sharp corrections 

in euro area stock prices occurred despite 

upward revisions of analysts™ earnings 

expectations in the second quarter of 2006. In 

the second half of the year, implied stock market

2006volatility fell back to historically low levels 
and investors™ appetite for risk seemed to 

recover. The resulting decline in equity premia, 

together with a persistent outlook for solid 

growth in corporate earnings, seemed to support 

the strong rebound in euro area stock prices 

over the second half of 2006. 
Turning to a sectoral breakdown, the utilities 
sector was the best-performing sector in 2006, 

with a stock price increase of more than 30%. 

This strong performance was probably due 

to intensive M&A activity in the light of 

consolidation in the euro area utilities sector. 

Supported by the improved business sentiment 

in the euro area, the industrial sector also 

outperformed the overall index significantly. 

Contrary to the developments in 2005, the oil 

and gas sector underperformed the overall index 

in 2006. The developments in oil prices might 

have contributed to the comparatively weak 

performance of this sector. The health sector, 

where earnings are usually less dependent on 

the position in the business cycle, also 

underperformed in 2006. 
In early 2007 global stock prices initially 
continued to increase at a pace comparable to 

that recorded over the second half of 2006. The 

upward trend in stock prices halted on 

27 February 2007 when stock prices, triggered 

by a sharp fall in Chinese equity prices, declined 

significantly across the globe. The Dow Jones 

EURO STOXX and the Standard and Poor™s 

500 indices both fell by about 5% in a few days. 

The sharp declines in stock prices wiped out the 

increases in the first eight weeks of the year 

and, by 2 March 2007, both stock market indices 

stood at slightly lower levels than at the end of 

2006. Moreover, by early March, implied 

volatility surged on all major stock markets, 

probably signalling a significant reassessment 

of stock market risks.CONTINUED STRONG HOUSEHOLD FINANCING
Household borrowing remained strong in 2006, 

underpinned by favourable financing conditions, 

strong housing market dynamics and improved 

consumer confidence. Households™ demand for 
MFI loans accelerated in the first months of the 

year, peaking at an annual rate of 9.8% in the 

spring, and then gradually moderated to stand 

at an annual rate of 8.2% in December. The 

latest available data from the euro area 

quarterly financial accounts, which are 

available until the third quarter of 2006, indicate 

that the annual growth rate of the debt of 

the household sector owed to non-monetary 

financial institutions (non-MFIs), comprising 

OFIs and insurance corporations and pension 

funds, remained fairly stable in 2006, hovering 

around 8% during the year. 
Looking at the breakdown of MFI loans to 
households by purpose, the strength of 

household borrowing continued to be explained 

mainly by the robust demand for loans for house 

purchase (see Chart 16). The ongoing strength 

of mortgage borrowing was facilitated by the 

low level of interest rates across the euro area 

and buoyant housing market developments in 

many regions which created high financing 

requirements (see Section 2.3 of this chapter). 

Furthermore, the results of the Eurosystem™s 

bank lending survey indicate that the continued 

strong growth in loans for house purchase was 

also related to an easing of credit standards that 

banks applied in the approval of loans. Banks 

reported competition from other banks and non-Chart 16

2006banks and a perception of lower risks in terms 
of expectations regarding general economic 

activity as the main factors behind the easing of 

credit standards. The changes in credit standards 

were mostly implemented by reducing margins 

on average loans and by lengthening 

maturities.In the spring of 2006 the annual growth rate of 
MFI loans to households for house purchase 

started to moderate slightly from rates of more 

than 12%, to stand at 9.5% in December. This 

development was in line with the increase in 

mortgage lending rates over the course of the 

year from the very low levels seen in previous 

years (see Chart 17), in the context of rises in 

key ECB interest rates and market rates. The 

lending rates on new housing loans were 

between 50 and 120 basis points higher in 

December 2006 than at the end of November 

2005 before the ECB started to raise key interest 

rates in December 2005. Rates on loans with a 
shorter period of initial rate fixation rose more 

strongly than those on loans with a longer 

period of initial rate fixation. The results of the 

Eurosystem™s bank lending survey suggest that 

demand for housing loans was also dampened 

by less optimistic housing market prospects 

in the second half of 2006, as also reflected 

in some weakening of house price growth 

and housing market activity in some parts of 

the euro area which had previously shown 

strength. 
Similar to loans for house purchase, although at 
a somewhat lower level, the annual growth rate 

of consumer credit strengthened further until 

around mid-year, before decelerating slightly in 

the second half of the year and standing at 7.8% 

in December. According to the results of the 

Eurosystem™s bank lending survey, the demand 

for consumer credit was mostly driven by an 

improvement in consumer confidence and an 

increase in spending on durable consumer 

goods, although the importance of the latter 

factor declined towards the end of the year. 

In addition, credit standards applied to the 

approval of consumer credit were eased 

significantly in 2006, implying that loan supply 

conditions improved during the year. 
HOUSEHOLD INDEBTEDNESS ROSE FURTHER
Reflecting the continued strong borrowing 

dynamics, the ratio of household debt to 

disposable income increased further in 2006 

(see Chart 18). However, the level of household 

indebtedness in the euro area remained below 

that seen in the other main industrialised 

countries, notably the United States, the United 

Kingdom and Japan. The household sector debt 

servicing burden (the ratio of interest payments 

plus principal repayments to disposable income) 

increased somewhat in 2006, owing to the still 

vigorous loan growth and the modest rise in 

bank lending rates. 
The continued rise in households™ indebtedness 
has increased their exposure to changes in

2006consolidated household sector and vary 
markedly across euro area countries as well as 

across households. In this respect, the debt 

level and debt servicing burden are, for instance, 

higher if analysis is restricted to those 

households that actually have a mortgage 

outstanding. In addition, debt levels and the 

debt servicing burdens vary with different 

levels of income: while in absolute terms the 

bulk of debt is held by households with high 

income levels which may be more resilient to a 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions 

and/or higher interest rates, the debt servicing 

burden is clearly higher for low-income 

households. Finally, some uncertainty relates to 

the fact that the share of existing mortgage debt 

exposed to changes in prevailing interest rate 

conditions depends on the specific features of 

the underlying mortgage contracts, which differ 

significantly across the euro area. 
CONTINUED LOW REAL COST OF EXTERNAL 

FINANCING FOR NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS 
Financing conditions for non-financial 

corporations in the euro area remained 

favourable in 2006 and were thus supportive of 

economic growth. This was reflected in both a 

low cost of financing and ready access to 

sources of financing. Non-financial corporations 

increased in particular bank borrowing, whereas 

their issuance of market-based instruments was 

more subdued. Despite the recent pick-up of 

debt ratios and net interest payments, the 

financial situation of non-financial corporations 

remained favourable in 2006, mainly on account 

of strong profitability in combination with a 

still low cost of financing. 
Following the rise in key ECB interest rates, 
the overall real cost of external financing of 

non-financial corporations increased but

based on their respective amounts outstanding and deflated by 

inflation expectations (see Box 4 in the March 2005 issue of the 

ECB™s Monthly Bulletin). The introduction of harmonised MFI 

lending rates at the beginning of 2003 led to a break in the

2006remained low by historical standards throughout 
2006 (see Chart 19).6 Regarding the components of the cost of 

financing, interest rates on MFI loans to non-
financial corporations increased in the course 

of 2006 in both real and nominal terms (see 

Chart 17). The rise in money market interest 

rates Œ amounting to 155 basis points between 

September 2005 and December 2006 in the case 

of the three-month EURIBOR Œ has been 

broadly passed on to MFI loans. MFI interest 

rates on loans with a floating rate and an initial 

rate fixation of up to one year increased by 

around 125 to 155 basis points over the same 

period, although it should be kept in mind that 

some cross-country dispersion remains (see 

Box 2). The majority of long-term MFI interest 

rates have also followed the upward movements 

observed in market interest rates of a comparable 

maturity. These increases Œ ranging from around 

60 to 135 basis points Œ have broadly followed 

the movements in long-term market interest 

rates, thereby maintaining the bank spreads at 

low levels. 
The real cost of market-based debt for non-financial corporations, although increasing 

more than the cost of bank-based debt in 2006, 

has also remained relatively low. BBB-rated 

corporate bond spreads fluctuated around an 

average of approximately 75 basis points in 

2006. The low level of spreads is likely to reflect 
low credit risk, supported by low asset price 

volatility and the strength of corporate profits.7 Despite the relatively benign performance in 

2006, looking forward, caution may be warranted 

given some signs of deterioration in the general 

corporate environment and the credit market. In 

fact, there are indications that the increasing 

number of debt-financed mergers and 

acquisitions and of leveraged buyouts, share 

buybacks and special dividend payouts may 

have an adverse impact on the sustainability of 

corporate debt levels.8 The real cost of quoted equity of non-financial 

corporations underwent some fluctuations in 

the course of 2006, but overall stood at levels 

comparable to those in 2005, in spite of the 

rebound in stock prices. The cost of equity 

financing remains significantly higher than that 

of other forms of financing, although Œ also 

owing to the increase in the cost of debt 

financing in 2006 Œ the cost differential has 

narrowed somewhat. 
6 The real cost of external financing of non-financial corporations 
is calculated by weighting the different external financing 
sources on the basis of their amounts outstanding (corrected for 

valuation effects). For a detailed description of this measure, 

see the box entitled ﬁA measure of the real cost of the external 

financing of euro area non-financial corporationsﬂ in the March 

2005 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.

INTEREST RATE DISPERSION IN RETAIL BANKING MARKETS ACROSS EURO AREA COUNTRIES
Despite the remarkable convergence of interest rates that took place in the run-up to the 
completion of EMU, MFI interest rates on deposits from and loans to households and non-
financial corporations still differ across euro area countries. Retail banking markets are among 

the most fragmented within the euro area financial system.1 The purpose of this box is to 
illustrate the cross-country differences and outline a few of their causes. Understanding these 

differences provides additional background for interpreting euro area developments and 

assessing the potential impact of monetary policy decisions on the various euro area economies. 

Banks play a key role in the financial system and therefore influence the savings, financing and 

spending decisions of households and non-financial corporations.1 See, for example, ﬁIndicators of financial integration in the euro areaﬂ, ECB, 29 September 2006.
44ECB Annual Report
2006Much of this analysis is based on a report that was prepared by the Monetary Policy Committee 
and the Statistics Committee of the Eurosystem and published in September 2006.2 Since then, 
country-by-country interest rates for a group of selected MFI interest rates have also been 

released jointly on the websites of the ECB and the euro area NCBs. On the basis of this 

selection, the comparison in this box is made mainly for the ten MFI interest rates that relate 

to new business, as they are compiled for the same reference period across countries.  
The table above provides an overview of the relative dispersion in the level of MFI interest 
rates across countries, as measured by the coefficient of variation. The level of dispersion is 

highest for interest rates on overnight deposits and considerably lower for deposits with an 

agreed maturity of up to one year. As regards loans, bank overdrafts and loans to households 

for consumption show the greatest cross-country differences, while the dispersion of interest 

rates on loans to non-financial corporations and on housing loans is lower. Moreover, in most 

categories, the dispersion for new loans with a floating rate and an initial rate fixation of up to 

one year tends to be somewhat higher than that for new loans with longer periods of initial rate 

fixation.There are many possible explanations for the differences in MFI interest rates across countries, 
including market competition, various risk premia (e.g. for credit risk or prepayment risk),

2006bank characteristics and cyclical determinants, such as the economic cycle, the evolution of 
deposit supply and credit demand, or house price dynamics. Recent analysis suggests that 

interest rates differ because national banking products are different or because they are 

differentiated by national factors.
3 Differences in average periods of initial rate fixation is one 
possible explanation for dispersion of MFI interest rates that cuts across several loan categories. 

Moreover, when comparing individual national MFI interest rates, it should be kept in mind 

that business volumes vary greatly across countries and that in some countries certain markets 

are very small or virtually non-existent.4 In such cases, underlying new business volumes may 
be very volatile and interest rates may reflect occasional transactions granted under atypical 

conditions. 
The rest of this box looks in more detail at the various market segments, focusing in particular 
on the influence of product heterogeneity, institutional differences arising from the regulatory 

and fiscal frameworks, and measurement issues. 
MFI interest rates on deposits from households
Cross-country differences in MFI interest 

rates on deposits from households may often 

be associated with differences in product 

characteristics, such as the degree of liquidity 

and the return structure of deposits, market 

regulation and business practices. Further 

important factors arise from differences in the 

fiscal framework (such as tax-preferred 

accounts in some countries), although it is 

difficult to establish a direct causal link.
The differences in interest rates on overnight 
deposits are particularly pronounced. In some 

countries MFIs essentially do not remunerate 

these deposits, while in other countries 

depositors may receive, on average, more than 

1.30% on their current account balances (see 

Chart A). This substantial dispersion may be 

caused by the fact that banks use different 

strategies for pricing current accounts and 

related services. For example, some banks 

may pay higher overnight interest rates but 

charge high fees for current account services or, conversely, some may pay lower rates and 

charge lower fees. Data collected by the European Commission in its sector inquiry on retail 
3 National differences can be partially explained by variables reflecting the characteristics of domestic depositors and borrow
ers and 
by the characteristics of the banking systems (see M. Affinito and F. Farabullini, ﬁAn empirical analysis of national differenc
es in 
the retail bank interest rates of the euro areaﬂ, Temi di Discussione No 589, Banca d™Italia, May 2006). A detailed cross-count

ﬂ, 
European Commission, 17 July 2006.4 For instance, the ECB report cited in footnote 2 above documents the cross-country differences in the prevalence of floating 
rate 
loans or loans with different periods of initial rate fixation.

2006banking show that this could be the case in some euro area countries, although in some countries 
low deposit rates are associated with high fees.5 Furthermore, the increasing popularity in some countries of both internet accounts and other 

high-yield deposits, which enable funds to be withdrawn within one day but cannot be used for 

payment purposes, may result in a tendency to raise interest rates on overnight deposits.6The notable exception to the pronounced cross-country differences in household deposit rates 

relates to deposits with an agreed maturity of up to one year, which are more homogeneous 

across countries.MFI interest rates on loans to households for consumption purposes
As regards interest rates on loans, rates on 

loans to households for consumption show the 

highest level of dispersion. In particular, 

interest rates on bank overdrafts vary 

considerably, ranging from less than 7.00% to 

13.50% or more (see Chart B). The cross-

country differences for other types of loans 

for consumption are less pronounced but 

remain sizeable.Large differences exist not only in the size of 
the consumer credit market but also in the 

range of products on offer (including collateral 

practices), in the use of credit card credit, in 

the market environment, particularly in terms 

of the influence of specialised lenders, as well 

as in the periods of initial rate fixation.7 In 
general, such factors may also be reflected, at 

least in part, in the cross-country differences 

in MFI interest rates. For example, differences 

in the statistical treatment of credit card credit 

in the current data may have an effect because 

the interest rates on such credit are typically significantly higher than those on other consumer 

loans. Furthermore, characteristics of bank overdrafts and loans granted through credit lines 

differ across countries.

2006suggests that the dispersion of mortgage rates across US regions is lower than that between 
euro area countries.8 Recent reviews of the European mortgage markets emphasise the large 
differences in the product ranges and in the fiscal and regulatory frameworks, factors that are 

likely to explain much of the observed differences in MFI interest rates on loans to households 

for house purchase.9One important factor is linked to the differences in the period of initial rate fixation, which 

renders observed loan rates sensitive to the slope of the yield curve. The prevalence of dedicated 

housing finance schemes in some countries may also play a role. The fiscal and regulatory 

frameworks in a country are likely to have more of an impact on mortgage loans (than on other 

types of loan) owing to the importance usually attached to home ownership.10Moreover, as most loans to households for house purchase are secured by real estate, interest 

rate differences may partly be related to differences in the expected development of the real 

estate market. The differences in the evolution of residential property prices may have affected 

the value of the collateral for loans. 
Finally, the funding practices in the euro area also remain rather fragmented, varying from 
deposit funding to covered bonds and mortgage-backed securities, in comparison with the US 

mortgage market, which revolves around the mortgage agencies. 
MFI interest rates on loans to non-financial corporations
The level of dispersion in interest rates on 

bank overdrafts to non-financial corporations 

is one of the highest (and higher than in those 

on bank overdrafts to households), as 

illustrated in Chart C. The dispersion in 

interest rates on other corporate loans is 

considerably lower and is indeed among the 

lowest of all types of loan, although in some 

cases it is somewhat higher than for housing 

loans. The main reasons for these cross-

country differences include various facets of 

product heterogeneity and the specific 

business environments in which the non-
financial corporations operate (e.g. depending 

on the firm size). 
Differences remain in collateral practices, not 
only for loans, but also for bank overdrafts. 

In some countries bank overdrafts are usually 

unsecured, while in others they are often

2006FURTHER RISE IN THE DEMAND FOR EXTERNAL 
FINANCING BY NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS 
Non-financial corporations increased their 

demand for external financing further in the 

course of 2006. 
The demand for external financing increased 
despite abundant internal funds. The profitability 

of listed non-financial corporations in the euro 

area remained strong in 2006 as indicated, for 

example, by the ratio of net income to sales (see 

Chart 20).9 Profit ratios increased particularly 
in the transportation and communications 

sector, while the rise in profits in the wholesale 

and retail trade sectors remained below the 

average increase for all listed non-financial 

corporations. The latter development may 

reflect the relatively moderate growth of private 

consumption in the euro area. 
At the end of 2006 the real annual growth rate 
of financing of non-financial corporations rose 

to 4.5%, from 1.2% at the end of 2004. This 

development was mainly driven by a strong 

increase in the contribution of loans granted by 

MFIs, whereas the rise in the contributions of 

debt securities and quoted shares was more 

modest (see Chart 21). 
The robust growth in MFI loans across the 

maturity spectrum continued in 2006, and in 

December 2006 MFI loans to non-financial 

corporations grew at an annual rate of 13.0% in 

nominal terms. While such levels of the annual 

growth rate have not been seen since the 

introduction of the euro in 1999, it should be 

kept in mind that the dynamics of bank loans to 

non-financial corporations have also been 

robust in other main economies, notably in the 

United States which has experienced even 

stronger bank lending growth over the past few 

years. According to the assessment of banks, as 

explained in the Eurosystem™s bank lending 

survey, financing needs related to real economic 

activity Œ namely for inventories, working 

capital and fixed capital investments Œ have 

gradually increased in importance in explaining 

the continued strengthening of loan demand in 

the euro area in 2006. However, other factors of 

a more financial nature, such as financing needs 

for M&A activity, have also continued to 

contribute to net loan demand. A relaxation of 

bank loan supply conditions over the past few 
secured (e.g. with invoices or part of the firm™s portfolio). Moreover, a high interest rate on 

bank overdrafts may reflect their being unauthorised and the inclusion of a penalty in the 

interest rate. Banks may also perceive recourse to this type of credit to be a sign of weak cash 

management on the part of the firm, and thus charge a higher rate to compensate for the 

perceived higher risk. 
Furthermore, for loans (other than bank overdrafts) there are differences in the average period 
of initial rate fixation within an instrument category. Given that the yield curve is normally 

upward sloping, interest rates are likely to be higher in those countries in which the average 

period of initial rate fixation is closer to the upper band of a given instrument category. A 

related issue is the potential impact of the aggregation method on interest rates on new business, 

as loans with shorter maturities tend to be granted more frequently than those with longer 

maturities.Finally, other important factors are likely to include some specific features of the market 
environment for loans to non-financial corporations, in particular firm size, access to non-bank 

financing, types of lender and relationship banking.

of listed non-financial corporations in the euro areaﬂ in the June 
2006 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.
49ECB Annual Report
2006years may have acted as an additional driver of 
current corporate credit developments. 
In contrast to the strength of bank-based 
corporate financing, market-based financing Œ 

through both debt and equity Œ remained 

relatively low. The annual growth rate of debt 

securities issued by non-financial corporations, 

standing at around 4.0% on average in 2006, 

remained relatively modest, as was the case in 

preceding years. Likely explanations for the 

moderate growth are the stronger increase in 

the cost of market-based debt in comparison 

with bank-based debt in 2006 and the 

substitution of debt securities by loans to 

finance mergers and acquisitions. There is 

indeed some evidence that the increased M&A 

activity is predominantly being financed by 

syndicated bank loans rather than debt 

securities, which were employed more 

extensively for such transactions in earlier 

episodes. 
The annual growth rate of quoted shares issued 

by non-financial corporations showed some 

tendency to increase throughout 2006, but 

remained subdued overall. The overall modest 

contribution of the net issuance of quoted shares 

to the net financing of the euro area corporate 

sector is probably related to the significantly 

higher real cost of equity than the real cost of 

debt financing. This low growth may also be 

explained by the continuing popularity of share 

buyback programmes. At the same time, gross 

issuance has been rising somewhat over the 

recent past, supported by the development of 

both initial and secondary public offerings. 

Generally, the recovery of gross equity issuance 

by non-financial corporations is likely to be 

related to the pick-up in economic growth in the 

euro area.10 Chart 20

2006RISING CORPORATE DEBT
As regards the development of the balance 
sheet position of non-financial corporations in 

the euro area, the significant rise in the sector™s 

debt financing led to a continuation of the 

increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2006. After 

a period of consolidation, the debt ratio of non-
financial corporations is currently higher than 

that recorded at the previous peak in 2003, 

which had followed a sharp increase in debt in 

the second half of the 1990s. 
Net interest payments of non-financial 
corporations on their MFI loans and deposits as 

a percentage of GDP declined significantly in 

the first half of the 1990s and reached a 

relatively low level in 2005. The recent debt 

developments, together with interest rate 

developments, have led to a significant increase 

in the interest burden of non-financial 

corporations in the course of 2006.2.3 PRICE AND COST DEVELOPMENTS
Overall HICP inflation was 2.2% on average in 

2006, unchanged from 2005. Despite this broad 
stability, annual inflation rates showed 

considerable volatility over the year, related, to 

a large extent, to developments in energy prices. 

There remained some additional pipeline 

pressures associated, in particular, with the 

sharp increase observed in global non-energy 

commodity prices. In line with this, intermediate 

goods price inflation rose significantly in 2006. 

Further down the production chain, some 

upward movement in the producer prices of 

consumer goods may signal the emergence of 

potential indirect effects of past commodity 

price increases. So far, these effects have 

remained contained. Finally, moderate 

developments in labour costs in 2006 continued 

to contribute to overall subdued inflationary 

pressures, while the appreciation of the euro 

had a similar effect. 
HEADLINE INFLATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY 

INFLUENCED BY ENERGY PRICE DEVELOPMENTSShort-term fluctuations in oil prices and base 

effects from past energy price developments 

contributed strongly to the profile of overall 

HICP inflation in 2006 (see Chart 23).
The average price (in euro) of a barrel of Brent 
crude oil increased by around 20% in 2006, 

compared with an increase of around 45% in 

2005 (see Table 1). Oil prices also showed 

considerable volatility in 2006, rising in the 

first half of the year to reach historically high 

levels in August, before decreasing sharply. 

This decline in crude oil prices was accompanied 

by a rapid fall in oil-related energy prices at the 

consumer level. Moreover, the impact on prices 

appeared to have been reinforced by a significant 

decline in the refining margin of petrol.
11 The 
contribution of energy price increases to the 

overall HICP inflation rate, which was 

particularly strong in the first half of 2006, 

declined substantially in the second half of the 

year (see Chart 24). The strong energy price 

increases which occurred in 2005 resulted in

2006.12The contribution of unprocessed food prices to 

the overall inflation rate was considerably 

stronger in 2006 than in previous years, owing 

to particularly strong developments in the third 

and fourth quarters. This was notably due to 

the weather conditions experienced over the 

summer in most parts of Europe, which affected 

the supply of fruit and vegetables. Moreover, 

the contribution of meat prices also increased 

over the course of the year. 
The annual growth rate of the HICP excluding 

energy and unprocessed food stood at 1.5% on 

average in 2006, broadly unchanged from 2005. 

However, a slight increase in inflation was 

observed over the course of the year for the 

HICP excluding energy and unprocessed food, 

which rose from 1.4% in the first quarter to 

1.6% in the fourth quarter. This upward pattern 

was due mainly to the increase observed in the

likely reflected a gradual pass-through to 

consumers of previous increases in energy and

inflation remained broadly stable at around 

2.0% during 2006, despite some short-term 

volatility on account of some sub-components, 

such as the price of package holidays, which 

were affected by the shift in the timing of the 

2006 spring holidays. Overall, in 2006 domestic 
price pressures appeared contained, and the 

pass-through of past increases in oil and non-
oil commodity prices remained limited at the 

consumer price level. 
Despite significant inflationary shocks in 
2006, particularly as a result of energy price 

developments, and headline inflation being

LONGER-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS IN THE EURO AREA
The primary objective of the ECB™s monetary policy is to maintain price stability. To this end, 
the Governing Council of the ECB aims to keep the annual rate of increase in the euro area 

HICP below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The stabilisation of the longer-term 

inflation expectations of economic agents in the euro area at levels consistent with price 

stability is a prerequisite in order for monetary policy to be efficient. While shocks outside the 

control of monetary policy, such as oil price hikes, may have an impact on headline inflation 

in the short term and may therefore affect short-term inflation expectations, longer-term 

inflation expectations should reflect the extent to which agents believe that the ECB will 

achieve its price stability objective. A credible monetary policy helps to anchor longer-term 

inflation expectations to the objective. This box reviews the various measures of longer-term 

inflation expectations which can be used to gauge the credibility of monetary policy in the euro 

area and looks at developments in those measures since 2001. 
53ECB Annual Report
2006Various measures of longer-term inflation expectations
Information on the longer-term inflation expectations of euro area economic agents is available 
from two types of measure: survey-based and financial market-based. These differ as regards 

the type of measure (direct versus indirect), the category of agent involved and the time horizon 

used.1 Survey-based information on long-term inflation expectations is currently available at 
the euro area level from three sources. First, the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) 

has reported on a quarterly basis since 2001 the five-year-ahead inflation forecasts of a panel 

of experts from both financial and non-financial institutions based in the EU.2 Second, twice a 
year Consensus Economics publishes long-term forecasts (six to ten years ahead) provided by 

experts from banks and other financial institutions for euro area consumer prices. Finally, the 

Euro Zone Barometer provides forecasts for inflation up to four years ahead on a quarterly 

basis.Longer-term inflation expectations can also be derived from financial market instruments. 
Information on financial market participants™ average inflation expectations over the remaining 

maturity of a bond can be calculated as the spread between the yield on a standard bond and 

that on an inflation-linked bond of the same maturity. This measure is commonly referred to as 

the break-even inflation rate. Another financial market-based measure of long-term inflation 

expectations can be extracted from inflation-linked swaps with corresponding maturities. All 

of these financial market measures have the 

advantage of being available in real time for a 

wide range of possible horizons. However, 

they are generally not direct measures of 

inflation expectations, as they are likely to 

incorporate unobservable risk premia (in 

particular an inflation risk premium and a 

liquidity premium) and may at times also be 

distorted by technical market factors. This 

notwithstanding, market-based indicators are, 

compared with surveys, more closely linked 

to actual economic behaviour. Overall, as 

there are only imperfect indicators of longer-

term inflation expectations available, it is 

preferable to base analysis on a combination 

of these measures, cross-checking the 

information from various sources.Developments in longer-term inflation 

expectations since 2001Chart A presents the above-mentioned 

measures of longer-term inflation expectations. 

Despite their different time horizons, the 

measures convey relatively similar messages. 
1 For more details, see the article entitled ﬁMeasures of inflation expectations in the euro areaﬂ in the July 2006 issue of th
e ECB™s 
Monthly Bulletin.2 In 1999 and 2000 longer-term inflation expectations were available only on an annual basis.

2006In particular, survey measures of longer-term 
average inflation expectations generally show 

remarkable stability, standing at levels below, 

but close to, 2%. Break-even inflation rates 

have been more volatile, reaching levels above 

2%, but this could be linked to the fact that 

they not only reflect inflation expectations, 

but also include a positive, but time-varying, 

premium for inflation risks. 
The stability of average survey measures of 
inflation expectations is striking. However, it 

masks regular revisions to individual forecasts, 

which have offset each other. For example, as 

illustrated in Chart B, the results of the SPF 

have been showing a gradual shift in 

the frequency distribution of expectations 

since 2001, leading to a lower standard 

deviation across individual responses and a 

higher proportion of respondents quoting 

1.9% and 2.0% as their longer-term inflation 

expectations. At the same time, the percentage 

of respondents expecting inflation to be 1.6% 

or below has decreased since 2001.A central bank™s ability to anchor inflation 
expectations can be assessed on the basis of 

the extent to which long-term inflation 

expectations respond to changes in very short-
term inflation expectations. Chart C plots the 

individual revisions in short-term inflation 

expectations (i.e. one year ahead) and longer-

term expectations (i.e. five years ahead) 

between two survey rounds, as provided by 

SPF participants. It suggests that there is 

indeed little correlation between movements 

in short-term inflation forecasts and 

movements in long-term expectations. Despite a number of short-term price shocks on the 
upside (for example, surges in oil prices, weather and food-related shocks, and unforeseen 

increases in administered prices and indirect taxes), combined with a persistent downward bias 

in the short-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters, no impact is visible on 

longer-term inflation expectations. The resilience of longer-term inflation expectations suggests 

that economic agents believe that the ECB will ensure that such short-term shocks will not 

affect medium to long-term price developments.

2006Movements in probability distribution as 
an indication of perceived risks to price 

stabilityIn the SPF, participants are also asked to 

assign a probability distribution to their 

forecast. This distribution, expressed as a 

percentage, provides information on the 

probability of the future outcome being within 

a specific range. On an aggregated level, it 

helps to assess how, on average, survey 

respondents gauge the risk of the actual 

outcome being above or below the most likely 

range. Given the quantitative definition of the 

ECB™s price stability objective, the probability, 

as reported in the SPF, of longer-term inflation 

standing at 2% or above might be used as a 

further indicator to assess the risks to price 

stability perceived by survey respondents. 

The probability, as reported by SPF 

participants, that in the longer term (i.e. five years ahead) inflation will stand at or above 2% 

increased gradually from around 35% in 2001 to around 40% in 2003. Over recent years it has 

stabilised somewhat, fluctuating within the 40-45% range. As the mean of SPF longer-term 

inflation expectations has remained unchanged at 1.9% since early 2002, these shifts in 

probability seem to reflect changes in survey respondents™ risk assessment. This view is 

confirmed by Chart D, which suggests some co-movement between the probability that inflation 

five years ahead will stand at or above 2% and a measure of the ten-year break-even inflation 

rate, which incorporates an inflation risk premium. 
ConclusionOverall, an analysis based on cross-checking the various measures of longer-term inflation 

expectations suggests that, despite increases in actual inflation and in short-term inflation 

expectations owing to recent shocks, longer-term inflation expectations have shown considerable 

resilience and have generally remained well anchored at levels consistent with the ECB™s aim 

of keeping inflation below, but close to, 2%. At the same time, there is no reason for complacency, 

as the perceived risk of inflation standing at or above 2% in the longer term has increased over 

time. While this calls for ongoing vigilance, overall the evidence on long-term inflation 

expectations nevertheless supports the view that the ECB™s monetary policy is considered 

credible by economic agents in the euro area.Chart D

INDIRECT EFFECTS REMAINED LIMITED AT LATER 
STAGES OF THE PRODUCTION CHAIN
The overall annual growth rate of industrial 

producer prices (excluding construction) in the 

euro area rose, on average, from 4.1% in 2005 

to 5.1% in 2006 (see Chart 25). Although this 

increase was driven mainly by energy prices, 
the annual growth rate of industrial producer 

prices excluding construction and energy also 

followed an upward trend in 2006, reflecting 

strong pressure from non-energy commodity 

prices and the indirect effects of higher oil 

prices. 
56ECB Annual Report
2006The annual rate of growth of intermediate goods 
prices accelerated significantly in the first half 

of 2006, rising from 1.9% in December 2005 to 

6.4% in August 2006. This was the highest rate 

of increase observed in over a decade and was 

due largely to an upsurge in the prices of 

industrial raw materials, in particular metal 

prices. In addition, the indirect effect of the 

increase in oil prices also contributed, albeit to 

a lesser extent, to upward pressure on 

intermediate goods prices. In the second half 

of 2006 intermediate goods price inflation 

remained high. However, its short-term 

dynamics slowed towards the end of the year, 

probably as a result of some easing in the 

growth of non-energy commodity prices, as 

well as the decline observed in oil prices and 

the appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the US 

dollar. 
Further down the production chain, producer 
price inflation was more muted, although annual 

growth in capital and consumer goods prices 

continued the upward trend observed since 

mid-2005. These developments largely reflected 
the upward impact associated with the indirect 

effects of past commodity price increases. In 

the case of consumer goods, some deceleration 

could be observed after August owing to the 

combined impact of two special factors (related 

to the prices of tobacco and health-related 

items). Excluding the effect of these factors, 

the underlying pattern indicated that firms were 

partly able to pass on higher input costs to 

consumers. 
Overall, by the end of 2006 the pass-through of 
previous commodity price increases appeared 

limited at the producer level, possibly being 

mitigated by declines in oil prices after August 

and the appreciation of the euro over the fourth 

quarter. Low labour cost pressures may have 

also played a role in dampening the effect of 

external price pressures. Nevertheless, there is 

an upside risk to inflation going forward in that 

higher non-wage input costs in some sectors 

could be passed on to consumers, should the 

pricing power of companies strengthen in line 

with the improving economic outlook. 
DEVELOPMENTS IN LABOUR COSTS REMAINED 

MODERATE
The annual growth rate of compensation per 

employee increased moderately in 2005 and 

2006. It rose to 2.1% on average over the first 

three quarters of 2006, recovering from a 

substantially lower average level (1.6%) in 

2005 (see Table 2). 
Since growth in total hourly labour costs was 
relatively stable over the same period, the 

upward profile of the growth rate of 

compensation per employee is likely to have 

reflected an upward adjustment in hours worked 

per employee in line with the gradual recovery 

in economic activity.
13 The same developments 
were observed at the sectoral level in 2006, 

with growth in compensation per employee 

being somewhat more dynamic and volatile in 

the industrial sectors than in the services sector 

(see Chart 26). Such variations in the number

2006of hours worked per employee also have an 
upward impact on labour productivity per 

employee, implying that they are neutral as 

regards developments in unit labour costs. 
Overall, available labour cost indicators 
confirmed a picture of continued moderate 

wage developments in 2006, although the 

situation varied greatly from country to country. 

The increase in the growth rate of those 

indicators observed in the second quarter 

appears to have been of a temporary nature, 

owing to the impact of one-off payments in 
specific countries. Negotiated wage growth 

continued to be moderate in 2006 (standing at 

2.2% on average, compared with 2.1% in 2005), 

despite volatility in the course of the year. 
The annual growth rate of unit labour costs 
remained stable at 0.8% in the first three 

quarters of 2006, at levels below those observed 

in 2005 and previous years. Overall, labour 

costs have continued to contribute to subdued 

domestic inflationary pressures in the euro area. 

Hence, the strengthening of economic activity 

and improvements in labour market conditions 

in 2006 do not appear to have resulted in a 

significant accumulation of wage pressures 

over the course of the year. This probably 

reflected the impact on wage negotiations of 

certain factors, such as the threat of relocation 

in a context of strong global competitive 

pressures, especially in the manufacturing 

sector, and an enhanced awareness of the 

need to preserve cost competitiveness. Other 

elements might also have played a role, such as 

the favourable effects on inflation expectations 

of a credible monetary policy, the reduced 

membership of labour unions and the larger 

share of part-time and short-term labour 

contracts. Related to this, labour market reforms 

might have played a role in the continuation of 

labour cost moderation. 
Moderate wage growth and increased economic 
activity supported profit developments in the 

euro area in 2006. The indicator of overall 

profit mark-up, measured by the difference 

between the GDP deflator and unit labour costs,

SIGNS OF MODERATION 
Euro area residential property prices, which are 

not included in the measurement of the HICP, 

showed signs of a further gradual deceleration 

in 2006 (see Chart 27). Based on the information 

available, their annual growth rate is estimated 

to have declined to 6.8% in the first half of 

2006, from 7.3% in the second half of 2005 and 

8.0% in the first half of 2005. At the country 

level, some moderation in residential property 

price developments, compared with the second 

half of 2005, could be observed in Belgium, 

Spain, France and Italy. In the other euro area 

countries, growth rates remained broadly 

stable, with the exception of Ireland, where 

they increased significantly. The information 

available suggests that residential property 
price developments continued to show 

considerable diversity across the euro area in 

2006. In particular, the protracted weakness of 

the German housing market stands in contrast 

with developments in most other euro area 

economies.

ECONOMIC GROWTH REBOUNDED IN 2006
Having stood at 1.5% in 2005, real GDP growth 

in the euro area increased strongly in 2006, 

to 2.8% (after adjusting for the number of 

working days), a level which exceeded available 

estimates of potential output growth and which 

constituted the strongest growth witnessed 

since 2000. Economic activity, which had 

started to improve in the second half of 2005, 

gained further momentum in the first half

2006of 2006, slowing down only marginally 
thereafter. This strong performance was 

partly unexpected, and reflected, in particular, 

a significant strengthening of business and 

consumer confidence, together with substantial 

improvements in labour market conditions, 

while the second half of the year saw the effect 

of past adverse shocks (in particular oil price 

increases) diminish significantly. 
Indeed, the euro area economy rebounded in 
2006 after a prolonged period of subdued 

growth, which had begun in 2001. Despite the 

strong expansion of the global economy, the 

disappointing pace of activity before 2006 was 

related to a number of factors, in particular the 

lack of resilience to various shocks such as 

very strong oil price increases. The sluggishness 

of domestic demand during that period may also 

have reflected private agents™ uncertainty about 

their future income. The cyclical downturn 

which began in 2001 was also associated with a 
sharp downward adjustment in financial asset 

prices and a pressing need for corporations to 

restructure their balance sheets, which limited 

investment and job creation. As the process of 

balance sheet restructuring made significant 

progress at the firm level and business confidence 

improved, in a context of continued favourable 

financing conditions, investment and, to a lesser 

extent, labour demand picked up, leading to 

robust domestic demand in 2006. Meanwhile, 

solid world growth supported exports. However, 

the external sector made a broadly neutral 

contribution to economic growth (see Chart 28), 

which was attributable, in particular, to stronger 

domestic economic momentum boosting imports 

from the rest of the world. 
As regards the domestic components of growth, 
total investment growth rebounded vigorously in 

2006, to reach 4.3%, its highest level since 2000, 

as compared with 2.7% in 2005 (see Table 3). 

This acceleration was particularly noticeable in

2006the construction sector, but was also seen in the 
non-construction sector. Benefiting from a 

favourable external environment, investment 

growth was further supported by high and 

increasing profit rates, a positive demand outlook 

and low costs of external financing. In addition, 

construction investment was strong, both in 

housing and, in particular, in other construction. 
Private consumption growth increased from 1.5% 
in 2005 to 1.8% in 2006. In the context of a sharp 

improvement in consumer confidence, the modest 

acceleration of household expenditure in 2006 is 

likely to have been positively affected by higher 

real disposable income growth. Real income 

gains in 2006 were achieved mainly through 

strong employment growth and non-labour 

income growth, and occurred in spite of the 

negative impact that elevated energy costs had on 

household purchasing power. Real compensation 

per employee, by comparison, increased only 

marginally. These effects were not offset by 

higher household savings. The positive impact on 

the saving ratio stemming from some 

consumption-smoothing behaviour Œ in a context 

of increasing income growth, as well as higher 

interest rates over the entire maturity spectrum 

Œ was more than compensated for by a reduction 

in precautionary savings stemming from labour 

market developments and, possibly, the strong 

dynamics in households™ net wealth. 
From a sectoral perspective, the acceleration of 
activity in 2006 was most pronounced in the 

industrial (excluding construction) sector, 

while value added growth in the market services 

sector increased more moderately. Such 

developments are consistent with the significant 

improvements in industrial confidence recorded 
since the second half of 2005, while the 

improvements in services confidence have been 

less pronounced (see Chart 29). 
Various dispersion measures indicate that the 
degree of divergence of real GDP growth rates 

among euro area countries declined slightly in 

2006 (see Box 4). Compared with the year 

before, average annual real GDP growth 

increased in most euro area countries in 2006 

and remained stable in the remaining 

countries.

OUTPUT GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS ACROSS THE EURO AREA COUNTRIES 
In any monetary union, there are differences in the economic developments experienced by its 
members. This box presents a brief overview of the size of output growth differentials between 

the euro area countries and how they have evolved over time.  In addition, some factors behind 

these differences are mentioned, and policy implications are discussed. 
61ECB Annual Report
2006The dispersion of real GDP growth rates 
across the euro area countries, as measured by 

the unweighted standard deviation, has been 

fluctuating around a level of 2 percentage 

points and, overall, shown no apparent 

upward or downward trend over the past 

35 years (see the chart). The same pattern also 

applies to the weighted dispersion of output 

growth, although the standard deviation 

in this case has been fluctuating around 

1 percentage point. However, since the start of 

Stage Three of EMU in 1999, the unweighted 

dispersion has declined among the euro area 

countries, while the weighted dispersion has 

been broadly stable. The difference between 

these two measures reflects the fact that in 

some smaller euro area economies real GDP 

growth has moved closer to the euro area 

average since 1999. 
In some euro area countries, real GDP has consistently grown above or below the euro area 
average in recent years. In particular, output growth in Greece, Spain, Ireland, Luxembourg 

and Finland has exceeded the euro area average every year since the mid-1990s. By contrast, 

in Germany and Italy real GDP grew by less than the euro area average every year from the 

mid-1990s to 2005. These persistent differentials appear to indicate that the dispersion of real 

GDP growth rates across the euro area countries largely reflects structural growth differences 

and, to a lesser extent, cyclical differences.
1 Some differences in the output growth performances of the euro area countries are natural and 

desirable. This is the case, for example, where such differences reflect catching-up effects of 

lower-income countries or differing demographic trends. Furthermore, there may be temporary 

differences between countries™ output growth rates, for instance on account of an equilibrating 

adjustment process in the monetary union following a shock. However, persistent differences 

in output growth rates may also reflect: inappropriate national economic policies; structural 

inefficiencies and rigidities; or a malfunctioning adjustment mechanism in or between some 

countries, reflected in increasing internal imbalances and diverging developments in 

competitiveness. 
The single monetary policy cannot influence output growth differentials across the euro area 
countries. Weak trend output growth performances must be tackled by means of properly 

designed national policies addressing fiscal and structural matters. Such policies need to focus, 

in particular, on enhancing the capacity of national economies to adjust to shocks and, in the 

countries experiencing slower growth, on fostering high levels of productivity and labour 

utilisation, as well as on further enhancing the Single Market, while maintaining stable 

macroeconomic conditions.Dispersion of real GDP growth across the euro

2006ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LABOUR 
MARKET 
Labour market conditions in the euro area 

improved significantly in 2006, with 

employment growing at a rate of 0.3% to 0.5% 

quarter on quarter (see Table 4) and the level of 

employment increasing by more than two 

million. This performance seems to be in line 

with the pattern of economic growth, contained 

real labour costs and the likely impact of recent 

labour market policy measures which have 

facilitated the expansion of part-time work and 

self-employment. In addition, since part of the 

cyclical adjustment of labour input during the 

last downturn took place via a decline in hours 

worked per employee (both part-time and full-
time employees), labour has also been supported 

by a rebound in hours worked over the recent 

past. From a sectoral perspective, employment 

rose strongly in the services and construction 

sectors, while the protracted decline in industry 

(excluding construction) came to an end.  
The unemployment rate, which began to decline 
in mid-2004, decreased further in 2006, reaching 

a level of 7.5% in the fourth quarter of the year 

(see Chart 30). It should be noted that this is the 

first time that such levels have been achieved 

since the beginning of the series in 1993. 
Although this clearly indicates a cyclical 

rebound in labour market conditions in 2006, 

part of the decrease in the unemployment rate 

can be assessed as being of a structural nature, 

reflecting the impact of labour market reforms 

in some euro area countries. While several 

countries have made significant progress 

towards making their labour markets more 

flexible, more ambitious reforms are still 

needed in many countries. 
Labour productivity growth for the whole 
economy accelerated further in the course of 

2006. The acceleration in labour productivity 

was mainly driven by the industrial (excluding 

construction) sector, whereas productivity 

growth in the services sector remained stable at 

a level significantly below productivity growth 

for the industrial sector (see Chart 31). 
The pick-up in labour productivity was partly 
attributable to the cyclical rebound in the euro 

area economy recorded in 2006. However, euro 

area productivity growth remains disappointing, 

and structural factors also explain this weak 

performance. The slowdown in productivity 

growth witnessed since the mid-1990s may, in 

part, have been driven by the transitory effects 

of a structural increase in the utilisation of

DEVELOPMENTS IN EURO AREA PRODUCTIVITY AND THE NEED FOR STRUCTURAL REFORMS
Productivity improvements are a key determinant of economic growth and increases in real 
income per capita in the medium to long run. Against this background, this box reviews the 

main developments in euro area labour productivity over the past fifteen years and discusses 

the need for policies that contribute to increasing productivity growth in the future. Productivity 

is measured in terms of labour productivity, which is defined as real output per unit of labour 

input. Labour input, in turn, is measured in two ways, namely in terms of either the total hours 

worked or the number of persons employed.1 1 It is worth mentioning that, while the use of total hours worked is the preferred option from an economic point of view, esti
mates 
of hours worked are subject to measurement errors. While the data convey relevant information in terms of comparing trends over
 time, they are unsuitable for cross-country comparisons of the level of hours worked in any given year.
64ECB Annual Report
2006Over the past ten years the development of euro area productivity has been disappointing. A 
decline in euro area labour productivity growth vis-à-vis the United States can be observed, 

irrespective of whether labour input is measured per hour worked or per person employed.2 Average annual labour productivity growth per hour worked declined from 2.1% in the period 

1990-1995 to 1.3% in the period 1996-2005.3 This contrasts with an increase, from 1.1% to 
2.4%, in US labour productivity growth per hour worked over the same period (see Chart A). 

Measured in terms of persons employed, euro area labour productivity growth declined from 

1.7% in the period 1990-1995 to 0.8% in the period 1996-2005, while the corresponding US 

indicator rose from 1.3% to 2.1% (see Chart B).4 There has thus been a turnaround in labour 
productivity growth (both per hour worked and per person employed), with the euro area having 

been overtaken by the United States over the past ten years. While these developments may, in 

part, have been influenced by cyclical factors, the role played by structural factors cannot be 

ignored. 
The slowdown observed in the growth of euro area labour productivity is partly attributable to 
higher labour utilisation. One factor behind the latter development may have been the specific 

labour market reforms implemented in some euro area countries, such as a reduction of tax 

wedges and the implicit tax on early retirement5, as well as a relaxation of employment 
protection legislation (especially in the 1990s) and support for the development of part-time 

work. These measures, which were all aimed at increasing employment opportunities, in 

particular for low-skilled, female, young and older workers, have had a clear positive effect on 

employment rates (see Table A). 
2 Owing to the trend decline in average hours worked, euro area labour productivity growth tends to be lower when measured per 
person employed.3 See also the article entitled ﬁLabour productivity developments in the euro area: aggregate trends and sectoral patternsﬂ in 
the July 
2004 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin, and the box entitled ﬁDevelopments in euro area labour quality and their implications
 for 
labour productivity growthﬂ in the October 2005 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.

2006Nevertheless, taxes and benefits, as well as 
the level of employment protection legislation, 

remain significantly lower in the United 

States. As a result, the overall employment 

rate in the euro area is clearly below that 

recorded in the United States (see Table A). 

The need to raise employment levels in the 

euro area will, to some extent, continue to put 

pressure on euro area labour productivity 

growth. However, this apparent trade-off 

between employment and productivity is 

likely to be temporary. It does, however, add 

emphasis to the crucial importance of 

implementing the appropriate institutional 

setting for the euro area to enhance innovation 

and its diffusion in order to boost labour 

productivity growth. 
Another important factor behind the diverging 
developments in labour productivity growth 

in the euro area and the United States is the higher increase in capital intensity (capital services 

per hour worked) in the latter country, reflecting stronger investment in information and 

communications technology (ICT) equipment, in particular in the services sector (see 

Table A). When looking at sectoral developments, it appears that euro area productivity has 

lagged behind that of the United States primarily in the field of ICT-using services, including 

the retail and wholesale trade sectors and the financial intermediation sector (see Table B). In 

addition, the role of the ICT-producing sector in the euro area has been limited on account of 

its relatively small share in real GDP. Only in traditional non-ICT sectors has productivity 

growth in the euro area been higher than in the United States, but this lead has clearly been 

eroded over the past ten years. The structural characteristics of the US economy Œ a more 

flexible labour market, a higher degree of competition in product markets and lower barriers 

to entry for new firms, as well as a more efficient capital market Œ have apparently been more 

conducive to exploiting the opportunities provided by new technologies.6 Over the past fifteen years, the euro area has made significant and steady progress in easing 

product market regulation and creating a more business-friendly economic environment. 

Moreover, the adoption of the Services Directive by the European Parliament in December 

2006 will undoubtedly contribute to improving the situation in this field. Nevertheless, the 

extension and deepening of the internal market remain a priority, since the existing regulatory 

environment in the euro area is still overly complex, in particular by comparison with the 

United States, thus posing an obstacle to innovation and labour productivity gains. This may, 

in part, explain why the levels of R&D and venture capital investment Œ two important driving 

forces behind innovation Œ are still significantly below those observed in the United States.

2006In order to take full advantage of a more 
efficient regulatory environment, however, 

these measures need to be accompanied by 

efforts to improve the labour force™s level of 

education and expertise. Technological 

advancement results in jobs shifting from low 

to high-skilled workers through a process of 

ﬁcreative destructionﬂ. Thus, measures to 

promote improvements in skills and lifelong 

learning contribute to innovation and facilitate 

the use of advanced technologies. Thus far, 

investment in human capital in Europe has 

been inadequate for a ﬁknowledge-intensiveﬂ 

economy. In 2004, for instance, only 23% of 

25-64 year-olds in the euro area attained a 

tertiary level of education, as compared with 

39% in the United States. 
To sum up, the regulatory environment plays a major role in explaining labour productivity 
developments. All in all, despite significant progress in some areas, structural reforms in the 

euro area have not been far-reaching enough, and their implementation has been too slow to 

foster the emergence of a ﬁknowledge-based economyﬂ aimed at boosting labour productivity 

growth and enhancing job creation. Both the challenges and the solutions have been clearly 

identified, in particular in the context of the renewed Lisbon strategy. The challenge now is to 

step up the overall pace of reform.Table B

2.5 FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS 
BUDGETARY IMPROVEMENTS IN 2006
Fiscal developments in the euro area were 
relatively favourable in 2006, against a 

background of strong output growth and revenue 

windfalls. According to the euro area member 

countries™ updated stability programmes, the 

average general government deficit ratio stood 

at about 2.0% of GDP, down from 2.4% in 2005 

(see Table 5). With regard to the five countries 

with an excessive deficit procedure in 2006, it 

is estimated that Germany, Greece and France 

have brought down or maintained their fiscal 

deficits below the reference value of 3% of 

GDP, albeit thanks to significant deficit-

reducing temporary measures in the latter two 

countries. Two countries, Italy and Portugal, 
continued to report deficits of well above 3% of 

GDP. In the case of Italy, according to more 

recent estimates, the deficit reached 4.4% of 

GDP (well below the figure reported in 

the updated stability programme); excluding 

deficit-increasing temporary effects it would 

have amounted to 2.4%. Significant budgetary 

imbalances, albeit below the deficit ceiling of 

3% of GDP, have also remained in Luxembourg 

and Austria, while balanced or surplus budgetary 

positions are estimated for Belgium, Ireland, 

Spain, the Netherlands and Finland. 
When comparing the budgetary targets for 2006 
in the latest stability programme updates with 

those released at the end of 2005 and in the first 

half of 2006, the euro area deficit was lower by 

an average of about 0.2 percentage point of 
67ECB Annual Report
2006GDP. This reflects significantly better than 
expected outcomes for Germany (where the 

deficit is estimated to have been brought below 

the reference value of 3% of GDP a year earlier 

than planned) and for a number of euro area 

countries already in a sound budgetary 

position. 
Against this background, the euro area public 
debt ratio declined in 2006, for the first time 

since 2002, to slightly below 70% of GDP. This 

in turn reflects declines in debt ratios in the 

majority of countries, with the more notable 

exceptions of Italy Œ which has become the 

country with the highest debt ratio Œ and 

Portugal. 
These budgetary developments were mainly the 

result of strong output growth and revenue 

windfalls and, only to a small extent, effective 

fiscal consolidation. The improvement in the 

structural budget balance (cyclically adjusted 

balance excluding one-off and other temporary 

measures), estimated to have been about 0.4% 

for 2006, may partly reflect the above-mentioned 

windfall revenues and could therefore overstate 

the underlying effective pace of consolidation. 

The buoyancy of public revenues may stem 

from a number of factors, including higher 

corporate profits, the strong performance of 

equity markets and, in some countries, rising 

house prices or an increased effectiveness of 

tax administration. These factors have pushed 

up tax revenues on income and wealth, but the 

exact contribution of each of these factors is

developments mask substantial differences 

across euro area countries, notably among those 

with excessive deficits or significant budgetary 

imbalances. Greece and Portugal reported 

sizeable structural balance improvements, 

while progress is also expected to have been 
made in Germany and, to a lesser extent, in 

France. By contrast, the structural balance of 

Luxembourg worsened considerably. Budgetary 

developments were also reflected in the volume 

of issuance of general government debt 

securities (see Box 6). 
Box 6
DEVELOPMENTS IN GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES ISSUANCE AND BOND YIELD SPREADS IN THE 

EURO AREA 
Issuance of general government debt securities declined, as did deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios, 

for most countries in the euro area in 2006, in an environment of strengthening economic 

activity. Indeed, the 2006 updates of the stability programmes indicated, for that year, the first 

decline in the public debt ratio in the euro area since 2002, to slightly below 70% of GDP. In 

net terms, euro area general government borrowing grew by 2.1% in 2006, against 4.1% in 2005 

(see Table A)
1.An analysis of the structure of outstanding general government debt securities reveals 

that government debt issuance is predominantly undertaken by central government, which 

accounted for 93.5% of outstanding debt securities in 2006. The other general government 

sector was responsible for the remaining 6.5%. However, this sector has become more active. 

Between 1999 and 2006 the share of debt securities issued by central government declined 

steadily, while the share of debt securities issued by other general government roughly 

doubled. 
An important factor making the issuance of long-term debt securities by governments more 
attractive than that of short-term debt in 2006 was the narrowing of the spread between long-
term and short-term interest rates. Accordingly, although the annual growth rate of long-term 

debt securities fell from 4.9% in 2005 to 3.1% in 2006, the annual growth rate of short-term

2006debt securities declined more strongly and actually turned negative in 2006, reflecting net 
redemptions of short-term debt securities. 
Hence, euro area countries continued to have a long-term orientation in their debt management. 
In fact, long-term debt accounted for around 92.9% of outstanding debt securities in 2006, 

i.e. slightly above 2005, while the share of short-term debt securities was only 7.1% (see Table B). 

Table B indicates that the largest proportion of long-term general government debt securities 

was issued at a fixed rate. Despite the small increase in 2006, the share of floating rate issues 

decreased over time, from 10.6% in 1999 to 8.0% in 2006. Overall, recent trends in the structure 

of government financing reflect the significant benefits that have arisen in conjunction with 

the move to more stability-oriented economic 

policies over the last decade, which have in 

turn contributed to the low level of long-term 

interest rates reached in recent years. The 

most visible benefit is the significantly lower 

proportion of the government budget spent on 

interest payments. 
In terms of cross-country differences, German 
ten-year government bond yields have thus far 

been the lowest among euro area countries on 

average, primarily on account of these bonds™ 

higher liquidity and corresponding benchmark 

status. The chart shows the cumulative changes 

in government bond yield spreads for the 

countries that were under the excessive deficit 

procedure at the end of 2006, against German 

bonds.

yields across euro area countries reflect 

differences in liquidity and credit risk. For the 

countries that were not under the excessive

elections in the spring amid uncertainty surrounding the outcome. In the second half of 2006, 

the Italian and Greek spreads declined, albeit not returning to the levels seen at the beginning 

of the year. 
Sovereign debt ratings in the euro area were unchanged in 2006, with the exception of the 
rating for Italy. Indeed, in October Standard & Poor™s lowered its rating notation on Italian 

sovereign debt from AA- to A+, while Fitch decreased its own rating assessment from AA to 

AA- (see Table C).

PROSPECTS FOR PUBLIC FINANCES IN 2007
The updated stability programmes of end-2006 

point to a further decline in the average 

euro area deficit for 2007, to 1.4% of GDP, 

reflecting a structural improvement of about 
0.4 percentage point. For the euro area as a 
whole, planned budgetary consolidation is 

based on both revenue measures and expenditure 

restraint. However, both revenue and 

expenditure projections are higher than in the 

previous round of stability programmes, 

suggesting that revenue windfalls are at least 

partly anticipated to be of a permanent nature 

and are earmarked for additional spending. The 

euro area average public debt ratio is expected 

to decline further to 68% of GDP, mainly driven 

by the primary surplus. 
Budgetary consolidation in the euro area in 

2007 is expected to be, to a large extent, a result 

of the adjustment efforts in Germany and Italy. 

In Germany, continued expenditure restraint 

and indirect tax increases are contributing to 

fiscal adjustment. Italy™s deficit is projected to 

fall back to just below 3% of GDP, in line with 

the deadline imposed by the corresponding 

Council recommendation; this can be largely 

explained by the mainly tax-based consolidation 

package in the 2007 budget and by the 

dissipation of deficit-increasing temporary 

factors. Portugal, the other country with a 

deficit above 3% in 2006 but whose deadline 

for the correction of its excessive deficit is 

2008, plans to continue its adjustment efforts, 

although it is nevertheless targeting a deficit 
71ECB Annual Report
2006significantly above the reference value of 3% 
of GDP in 2007. In most countries with fiscal 

imbalances, planned consolidation towards 

medium-term budgetary objectives is modest. 
FISCAL STRATEGIES NEED TO FOCUS ON 

STRENGTHENING CONSOLIDATION EFFORTS
While the 2006 updates of the stability 

programmes generally indicate that governments 

plan to proceed towards sound budgetary 

positions, there are also indications that budget 

targets do not always imply sufficient 

consolidation or that concrete and credible 

measures have not yet been specified in detail. 

This entails risks for the future. With a 

favourable impetus from economic growth and 

buoyant revenues for the fiscal outlook in most 

countries, fiscal strategies need to guard against 

complacency and focus on strengthening 

consolidation efforts. The prospect of continued 

ﬁgood timesﬂ in the near future must be fully 

exploited to attain sound fiscal positions and a 

rapidly declining debt ratio as soon as possible, 

also in view of demographic challenges to fiscal 

sustainability. It is important that commitments 

under the revised Stability and Growth Pact are 

fully met in all countries, so that the credibility 

of the EU™s fiscal framework is enhanced. 
Past experience confirms that complacency is 
the main risk to fiscal policies in an upswing. 

As was the case in the early years of EMU, 

revenue windfalls during upturns can tempt 

governments to introduce unfinanced tax cuts 

and/or relax expenditure restraint. In order to 

avoid a repetition of past mistakes and to 

prevent the emergence of macroeconomic 

imbalances, it is essential that all countries 

refrain from engaging in pro-cyclical fiscal 

loosening and aim to achieve sound budgetary 

positions in the current upswing. Otherwise, 

there would be limited scope to let automatic 

stabilisers work in the next downturn, once 

again resulting in the need to tighten fiscal 

policies in a pro-cyclical manner. Insufficient 

progress with consolidation could also put 

renewed strains on the implementation of the 

Stability and Growth Pact in the next 

downturn. 
Member countries with fiscal imbalances which 

are not in an excessive deficit situation should 

step up fiscal consolidation efforts with the 

help of credible measures and attain their 

medium-term objectives sooner than planned in 

the updates of stability programmes. In fact, as 

postulated in the revised Stability and Growth 

Pact, the current economic environment calls 

for the 0.5% adjustment benchmark to be 

exceeded. 
Countries with deficits above the reference 
value of 3% of GDP must take all necessary 

measures to correct the situation as soon as 

possible, supported by a rigorous implementation 

of the Council recommendations. The improving 

fiscal outlook raises the prospect of the 

abrogation of excessive deficit decisions in 

several countries in the near future. In this 

regard, it is essential that excessive deficits are 

corrected in a sustainable manner through 

permanent and credible consolidation measures. 

Thereafter, rapid further progress towards 

countries™ medium-term objectives needs to be 

made so that there is room for manoeuvre to 

prevent renewed breaches of the deficit ceiling. 

In countries where forecasts point to risks of a 

breach of commitments, greater efforts are 

needed to attain targets and to prevent further 

steps being taken in the countries™ excessive 

deficit procedures. 
Member countries that have already achieved 
sound fiscal positions should maintain these or 

seek to consolidate them further. In a few cases, 

where fiscal positions are already in surplus 

while economic demand is buoyant, a tighter 

fiscal stance could help to reduce the risks of 

overheating. 
High-quality statistical data and sound statistical 
reporting remain essential in order to correctly 

assess the budgetary situation and the need for 

adjustment measures. 
Finally, it is worth recalling that fiscal 
consolidation should be undertaken as part of 

comprehensive expenditure-based structural 

reform programmes in line with the Lisbon 
72ECB Annual Report
2006strategy. This will not only help to mitigate 
adverse demand effects of consolidation through 

growing confidence, but also contribute to fiscal 

sustainability, output growth and employment 

in the euro area.2.6 EXCHANGE RATES AND BALANCE OF 
PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS
THE EURO APPRECIATED IN 2006 IN EFFECTIVE 

TERMSThe upward trend of the euro nominal effective 

exchange rate started in the fourth quarter of 

2005 and intensified throughout 2006. The euro 

appreciation was fairly broad-based in the 

first half of 2006, reflecting primarily its 

appreciation vis-à-vis the US dollar, the 

Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi and several 

Asian currencies formally or de facto linked to 

the US currency. In the second half of the year, 

the euro initially underwent a spell of broad 

stabilisation to subsequently resume its ascent 

at the end of October. By the end of the year it 

was Œ in nominal effective terms Œ nearly 5% 

stronger than its level at the beginning of 

January and 2.5% above its average level in 

2005. 
The strength of the euro throughout most of 
2006 seemed to stem from, among other factors, 

the markets™ perception that overall economic 

developments were becoming more favourable 

in the euro area. While further evidence of a 

widening US current account deficit presumably 

supported the euro against the US dollar at the 

beginning of the year, the markets™ attention 

gradually turned towards the differences in the 

business cycle and the future evolution of the 

monetary policy stance in the two economic 

areas. This shift stemmed primarily from an 

improving economic outlook in the euro area, 

contrasting with market concerns that US 

economic activity could experience a significant 

slowdown. Towards the end of the year, fresh 

evidence of a decelerating US business cycle, 

amid more moderate increases in US consumer 

prices and a weaker housing market, led to 
a further narrowing of the interest rate 

differentials vis-à-vis euro-denominated assets 

and to a renewed appreciation of the euro 

against the dollar. 
The Japanese yen depreciated progressively 
against the euro throughout 2006 in spite of 

continued economic growth in Japan over the 

same period. One factor accounting for the 

weakness of the Japanese currency seems to 

have been related to the wide interest rate 

differential of Japanese assets vis-à-vis the 

assets of other main economies, which 

reportedly encouraged substantial volumes of 

ﬁcarry tradeﬂ transactions against a background 

of low implied exchange rate volatility.
14 On 29 December 2006 the euro stood at 

USD 1.32 and JPY 156.93, respectively 11.4% 

and 12.4% higher than at the beginning of the 

year. The euro also appreciated considerably 

against the Canadian dollar (11.2%), the Hong 

Kong dollar (11.7%) and the Chinese renminbi 

(about 8%), and more moderately, by around 

3% on average, against the Australian dollar, 

the Swiss franc, the Norwegian krone and most 

other Asian currencies. Such gains were partly 

counterbalanced by the euro™s depreciation 

against the pound sterling (2.2%) and a number 

of EU Member States™ currencies, especially 

the Slovak koruna (nearly 9%) and the Czech 

koruna (5.3%). 
In the first two months of 2007 the exchange 
rate of the euro remained broadly unchanged in 

nominal effective terms. 
The real effective exchange rates of the 
euro Œ based on different cost and price 

measures Œ also appreciated during 2006 by 

approximately the same amount as the nominal 
14 The term ﬁcarry tradeﬂ refers to a trading strategy that aims to

currency areas by borrowing in a currency with a lower interest 

rate and investing in a currency with a higher interest rate, 

thereby earning ﬁcarryﬂ. Such strategies are profitable, as long 

as the higher-yielding currency does not depreciate against the

2006effective exchange rate (see Chart 32). In the 
last quarter of 2006 the real effective exchange 

rate of the euro based on consumer prices was 

about 3% above the level observed one year 

before. 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT 

IN 2006 
In 2006 the current account of the euro area 

recorded a deficit of •16.2 billion (or 0.2% of 

GDP), compared with a deficit of •6.8 billion 

in 2005 (or 0.1% of GDP). The slightly higher 

deficit resulted primarily from a lower goods 

surplus (by •20.3 billion), as goods imports 

grew faster than goods exports in value terms 

(16.1% and 13.8% respectively in 2006). The 

decline in the goods surplus, as well as a slightly 

higher deficit for current transfers, was only 

partly offset by a smaller deficit for income, 

while the surplus for services remained broadly 

unchanged (see Chart 33). 
Extra-euro area trade in goods expanded 
robustly in 2006. On the imports side, import 

volumes accelerated during the course of 2006, 

reflecting the pick-up in euro area economic 

activity and the appreciation of the euro. 

However, higher oil and non-oil commodity 

import prices were the major factors behind the 

increase in import values and, therefore, the 

decline in the goods surplus (see Chart 34).

74ECB Annual Report
2006Although the effect of rising oil prices on the 
euro area™s trade balance was partly offset by 

the appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the US 

dollar, the oil trade deficit continued to rise and 

stood at •181 billion (over 2% of GDP) in the 

12-month cumulated period up to October 2006, 

•39 billion higher than a year earlier. On a more 

positive note, the euro area appears to have 

benefited from oil revenue recycling Œ via 

increased demand from oil-exporting countries 

Œ compensating for some of the wealth transfer 

resulting from higher import prices. 
On the exports side, increases in both export 
prices and export volumes contributed to the 

growth in export values in 2006. Euro area 

export volumes rose robustly during the year, 

mostly owing to the strength of foreign demand. 

Exports to Asia (especially China) and the new 
EU Member States were particularly dynamic, 

amid strong economic activity in these regions. 

Export prices rose less than in the previous 

year, mainly owing to smaller price increases 

for capital goods. Meanwhile, the appreciation 

of the euro in 2006 represented a decline in 

price and cost competitiveness and may have 

contributed to a further loss in euro area export 

market shares. 
The declining trend in euro area export market 
shares was also related to structural factors of 

the global economy, such as the growing 

importance of new global players in the world 

export markets. Box 7 describes in more detail 

how the euro area is adjusting to an increasingly 

global and competitive economic environment. 
Box 7 
GLOBALISATION AND THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE EURO AREA
1 While globalisation is not a new phenomenon, there is growing consensus that its impact is 

fundamentally changing world patterns of production and trade. 
This box evaluates the recent changes in the export structure of the euro area and other major 
economies against the backdrop of globalisation.2 Using the Balassa index of revealed 
comparative advantages (see table), which shows a value greater than 1 if a country™s exports 

in a given sector are higher than the world average, it appears that over the period 1993-2004 

the euro area had a relatively diversified export structure, specialising in exports of predominantly 

capital and research-intensive, as well as labour-intensive, goods. The euro area™s partial 

specialisation in labour-intensive production is, at first sight, surprising, as the capital-labour 

ratio of the euro area is high in relation to many developing economies. Consequently, the 

results in the following table may be subject to some caveats. First, the Balassa index, which 

is not adjusted for imported intermediate goods, is somewhat misleading, as comparative 

advantages are likely to be related to processes and activities carried out within each domestic 

industry. Second, the classification into the four groups of goods in the table relies on relatively 

broad categories of exports.3 1 This box is based on U. Baumann and F. di Mauro, ﬁGlobalisation and euro area trade: interactions and challengesﬂ, ECB Occasi
onal 
Paper No 55.2 The aggregate picture for the euro area masks significant differences in the trade structure and performance of individual eu
ro area 
countries.3 For an alternative measure of relative export specialisation, see ﬁRelative export structures and vertical specialisation: a 
simple 
cross-country indexﬂ, Banco de Portugal Working Papers, January 2007.
75ECB Annual Report
2006By contrast, the three main developed competitor economies Œ Japan, the United Kingdom and 
the United States Œ have no revealed comparative advantages in labour-intensive exports; 

instead they are more heavily specialised in research-intensive products. Moreover, Japan is 

also specialised in predominantly capital-intensive goods, reflecting its high capital stock. 

Unsurprisingly, China, other Asian economies (referred to here as dynamic Asian economies 

(DAEs)4) and central and eastern European countries (CEECs)5 specialise in labour-intensive 
goods, reflecting their relative factor intensities. The DAEs, despite their comparative advantage 

in labour-intensive activities, also specialise in research-intensive products to a greater extent 

than the euro area. The CEECs, whose lack of revealed comparative advantage in research-

intensive goods clearly reflects low levels of R&D investment6, have a relatively high level of 
specialisation in raw material-intensive goods. 
The euro area and other developed countries™ export specialisations in research-intensive 
sectors show little change over time as compared with some major emerging economies, such 

as China, which are rapidly moving into these sectors (see Chart A1).
7 Similarly, there have 
not been major changes in the specialisation of developed economies in labour-intensive goods, 

which, in the case of the euro area, remains relatively high (see Chart A2). 
While its main focus is on medium-tech products, such as machinery and equipment, motor 
vehicles, chemicals and electrical goods, the euro area, on average, also specialises in some of 

the fast-growing sectors of world demand, such as pharmaceuticals, medical, precision and 

optical instruments, as well as aircraft and spacecraft. However, its specialisation in some 

slower-growing sectors, such as non-metallic mineral products, is also quite strong. Overall, 

the euro area does not specialise heavily in one particular sector but is relatively diversified in 

its export structure compared with other industrialised economies. This possibly shelters euro

 2.6% in the United States and 3.2% in Japan (source: OECD Science, Technology and Industry: Scoreboard 2005 and Eurostat, 

Structural Indicators Database).7 While these developments could be influenced by the large relative weight in overall production of advanced versus emerging 
economies, they might also reflect technological catching-up in emerging countries.
76ECB Annual Report
2006area aggregate production from periods of weak world demand in any single sector. Despite 
the fact that, overall, the euro area™s export specialisation in research-intensive sectors shows 

little change over time, more disaggregated data show that euro area exporters have nevertheless 

increased their specialisation in some of the high-tech sectors (such as pharmaceuticals and 

medical, precision and optical instruments as well as the information and communications 

technology (ICT) sectors), where world demand is growing robustly. By contrast, other 

developed countries, such as Japan or the United States, have been decreasing their specialisation 

in this field, possibly owing to intense competition from emerging Asia and the bursting of the 

ICT bubble in 2000. 
A positive impact on the development of euro area export competitiveness might also come 
from other factors. Recent surveys, empirical studies and theoretical models suggest that firms 

benefit from investing abroad. Therefore, the strong foreign direct investment activity of euro 

area firms might contribute to raising euro area overall productivity.
8 Looking ahead, while the emerging economies have thus far specialised in low and medium-

low-tech sectors and selected high-tech sectors, it appears likely that they will increase their 

specialisation in medium-high-tech sectors in the future, which would expose some of the euro 

area™s traditional stronghold sectors, such as motor vehicles, machinery and equipment, to 

more competition and potentially large adjustments. Indeed, there are signs that this is already

2006happening, with the export specialisation of 
the CEECs, China and the DAEs having 

started to increase over the past decade in the 

medium-high-tech sectors, including motor 

vehicles and transport equipment as well as 

other machinery and equipment. 
This initial assessment of the export 
performance of the euro area should be 

complemented by an explicit consideration of 

the import side, since globalisation has also 

had a large impact on import penetration and 

the composition of imports across countries. 

Trade liberalisation and the expansion of 

international production networks have 

contributed to a sharp increase in import 

penetration for the largest industrialised 

economies over the past decade. Between 

1991 and 2005, the ratio of imports of goods 

and services to GDP in real terms more than 

tripled in the United States and almost doubled 

in Japan, while developments in the euro area 

and the United Kingdom were somewhere in- 

between. Moreover, the general increase in 

import penetration has been accompanied by 

a large increase in imports from developing 

countries. For the euro area, this has implied a relative shift from intra-euro area trade partners 

and other industrial economies to emerging, lower-cost countries as providers of manufacturing 

goods (see Chart B). Such a shift has been particularly noticeable for intermediate and capital 

goods. This clearly signals that emerging economies are gaining importance as providers of 

inputs for production processes. This trend is associated with the more general tendency 

towards a higher import content of euro area exports. 
In sum, while the euro area is already facing increased competition from emerging countries, 
further adjustments are still to come. In comparison with the United States, which appears to 

be moving more decisively towards research-intensive products, the euro area remains partly 

specialised in labour-intensive goods. Moreover, emerging countries are gaining importance as 

export competitors not only in low-tech and labour-intensive industries Œ as their relative factor 

endowments would suggest Œ but also increasingly in technology and capital-intensive goods. 

At the same time, the euro area is losing ground in some traditional stronghold sectors, including 

machinery and equipment. This is corroborated by evidence of a strong rise in imports of 

capital goods from the new EU Member States, which appear in part to be displacing intra-euro 

area imports. 
Successful further adjustment to structural change will not be achieved by increased 
protectionism since this would lead only to more drawn-out periods of adjustment. Successful 

adjustment is more likely to be achieved by ensuring that the necessary structural change takes

2006place in an environment that allows transitional welfare losses (such as temporary increases in 
unemployment) to be kept to a minimum and promotes a flexible transfer of resources to new 

and expanding areas. This is the best way an economy can respond to the challenges of 

globalisation. This again requires structural reforms in the euro area, as well as increased 

spending on R&D, to facilitate the necessary innovation to develop new, promising areas of 

specialisation.NET INFLOWS IN COMBINED DIRECT AND 

PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN 2006 
In the financial account, the euro area 

experienced net inflows of •109.2 billion in 

combined direct and portfolio investment in 

2006, compared with net outflows of •45.4 

billion in 2005. This was mainly the result of 

substantially lower net outflows in direct 

investment and larger net inflows in portfolio 

investment in both equity securities and debt 

instruments (see Chart 35). 
Excluding the effects of a single large 
transaction associated with the restructuring of 

a large euro area firm in 2005, the rising deficit 

in direct investment in 2006 was due to an 

increase in direct investment abroad by euro 
area residents, mostly in the form of equity 

capital investment in the new EU Member 

States as well as in the United Kingdom and the 

United States. At the same time, direct 

investment inflows into the euro area more than 

doubled compared with the low levels recorded 

in 2004 and 2005, possibly reflecting, in part, 

market expectations of an improved economic 

outlook for the euro area. 
Again excluding the effects of the above-
mentioned restructuring, the rise in net inflows 

in portfolio investment in 2006 emanated from 

an increase in net purchases of euro area equity 

securities by non-residents, backed by the 

favourable earnings growth performance of 

euro area companies and higher equity returns

2006in the euro area than in the United States. 
Growing evidence of an improving economic 

outlook in the euro area in the course of the 

year may have been a key underlying factor 

accounting for these developments. 
As for fixed income activity, net inflows in debt 
instruments amounted to •79.2 billion (as 

opposed to •8.7 billion in 2005), owing to a 

marked increase in purchases of euro area bonds 

and notes by non-residents. 
Turning to the geographical breakdown of 
portfolio flows, based on cumulated flows over 

the first three quarters of 2006, the United 

States, offshore financial centres and non-Japan 

Asia were the main recipients of euro area 

equity portfolio investment. Euro area investors 

were also large net purchasers of debt 

instruments issued by these regions, as well as 

by the United Kingdom. Euro area manufacturing 

firms may have continued to relocate part of 

their production in the new EU Member States 

in particular, as foreign direct investment 

flows towards these countries (when measured 

as a share of these countries™ GDP) have 

been increasing in the last four years (see 

Chart 36). 
INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION 

DETERIORATED FURTHER IN 2006 
Data on the international investment position 

(i.i.p.) of the euro area vis-à-vis the rest of the 

world, available up to the third quarter of 2006, 

indicate that the euro area recorded net liabilities 

of •965 billion (representing 11.5% of euro 

area GDP), compared with •811 billion (10.1% 

of GDP) at the end of 2005 (see Chart 37). The 

higher net liabilities in 2006 largely resulted 

from an increase in the net liability positions in 

portfolio investment (by •145 billion) and other 

investment (by •83 billion), which were only 

partly offset by an increase in the net asset 

position in direct investment (by •70 billion) 

and reserve assets (by •5 billion). 
Given that the current account deficit of the 
euro area amounted to only •20 billion in 2006, 

the increase in the euro area™s net international 
liability position was largely driven by 

revaluation effects resulting from asset price 

changes and movements in exchange rates.

80ECB Annual Report
2006ECONOMIC ACTIVITYReal GDP growth in the non-euro area EU 
Member States accelerated notably in 2006 

(see Table 6).
15 While this pattern of stronger 
economic activity was widely observed across 

countries, annual growth rates differed 

considerably. Among the countries that joined 

the European Union in May 2004, output growth 

was highest in Estonia and Latvia, where it 

stood at or above 11.4%. In the Czech Republic, 

Lithuania and Slovakia, real GDP growth was 

also very strong at between 6.1% and 8.3%. 

Real GDP growth was lowest in Malta. In the 

other countries, namely Denmark, Sweden and 

the United Kingdom, growth accelerated 

compared with 2005 and was close to or above 

the euro area level in 2006. 
In most non-euro area EU Member States, 
economic activity was driven by domestic demand. 

Private consumption was spurred by increasing 

gains in real disposable income, associated with 

robust wage growth and declining unemployment, 

and by buoyant house prices. Growth in gross 

fixed capital formation accelerated, benefiting 

inter alia from an extended period of favourable 

financing conditions, improvements in the business 

environment and, in some countries, significant 
foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. In the 

majority of countries, rapid credit growth, partly 

resulting from favourable financial conditions, 

also contributed to robust growth in domestic 

demand. 
Export growth accelerated in many countries, 
supported by strong demand in key trading 

partners and sizeable FDI inflows in recent years. 

However, in most countries import growth kept 

apace due to robust domestic demand and the 

relatively high import content of exports in many 

of them. As a result, the contribution of net 

exports to real GDP growth in 2006 was broadly 

neutral for the non-euro area EU Member States 

as a whole, and significantly positive only in 

Hungary, Malta, Slovakia and Sweden. The high 

growth rates of imports and exports in many 

countries suggest that, although well advanced, 

the process of trade integration in the countries 

that joined the EU in May 2004 is still ongoing. 
Along with the stronger economic activity, the 
labour market situation continued to improve in

20062006 in many non-euro area EU Member States. 
Significant differences exist, however, across 

countries. While unemployment remained very 

high in Poland and Slovakia, in other countries, 

such as Denmark, the Baltic States and the 

United Kingdom, labour market conditions 

became rather tight. In most of the countries 

that have been EU Member States since May 

2004, employment growth remained more 

subdued than rapid output growth would 

suggest. This was because real GDP growth 

was mainly driven by the adoption of new 

technologies and strong productivity growth 

stemming, inter alia, from the sizeable FDI 

inflows received in recent years. Structural 

bottlenecks, such as skill and geographical 

mismatches between labour supply and demand, 

continue to exist in many of the countries that 

joined the European Union in May 2004. Together 

with migration flows, which contributed to a 
tightening of labour markets, these bottlenecks 

threaten to become a drag on growth in countries 

where labour shortages have emerged. 
PRICE DEVELOPMENTSHICP inflation increased significantly in almost 

all non-euro area EU Member States in 2006 

(see Table 7). Inflation remained highest in the 
fast-growing Baltic States, Hungary and 

Slovakia, and stood close to or moderately 

above the euro area average in the other 

non-euro area EU Member States. Average 

inflation was below 2% in Denmark, Poland 

and Sweden, while in the Czech Republic it did 

not exceed 2.1% in 2006. 
The upward trend in inflation in the non-euro 
area EU Member States in 2006 was partly 

attributable to changes in administered prices 

and indirect taxes in a number of countries such 

as the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, 

Hungary, Malta and Slovakia. Moreover, the 

significant rebound in energy prices was largely 

responsible for the rise in inflation in the 

summer of 2006. In a number of countries, 

inflation trends were also influenced by 

increases in food prices, which began growing 

at a faster rate in 2006, following the very 

subdued rises or declines of 2005. In the 

majority of countries, however, rapid growth in 

domestic demand contributed to underlying 

inflationary pressures. 
In countries that allow for a significant degree of 
exchange rate flexibility, currency appreciation 

had a broadly dampening impact on import prices

2006of 2005. However, in many cases, this was due 
to the better starting position at the end of 2005 

and buoyant tax revenues, which in turn can be 

partly explained by faster GDP growth than 

initially expected. Progress in structural fiscal 

consolidation seems to have stalled in most 

countries. Only Malta is estimated to have 

achieved a positive change in the cyclically 

adjusted budget balance of at least 0.5% of 

GDP (net of one-off and other temporary 

measures). By contrast, in a number of countries 

the fiscal stance was even loosened in a pro-
cyclical way, despite strong output growth. 
At the end of 2006 the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and the 

United Kingdom were subject to excessive 

deficit procedures. According to the 2006-07 

updates of their respective convergence 

programmes, the deficit ratio decreased in all 

of these countries Œ except in Hungary and 

Slovakia Œ in 2006, falling below 3% of GDP in 

Malta and the United Kingdom. In Poland, as 

was the case in 2005, a deficit ratio below the 

reference value was recorded. However, 

excluding the statistical derogation on the 

taking into account of mandatory funded public 

pension schemes within the general government 

sector (which expires in 2007), the deficit ratio 

would have exceeded the 3% threshold. 
With respect to the main decisions of the 
ECOFIN Council concerning the excessive 

deficit procedure in 2006, Cyprus received an 

abrogation in July after reporting a deficit ratio 

below the reference value of 3% of GDP in 

2005. By contrast, the Council initiated a 

procedure in the case of the United Kingdom in 

January 2006 and called for the excessive 

deficit to be corrected by the financial year 

2006/07 at the latest. In September 2006 

Hungary presented an adjusted convergence 

programme Œ requested by the Council in 

January Œ projecting a deficit of 10.1% of GDP 

in 2006, substantially above the initial target. In 

the Council™s recommendation of October 2006, 

the deadline for the correction of Hungary™s 

excessive deficit was extended by one year to 

2009. In relation to Poland, the Council adopted 
a decision in November 2006 stating that the 

action taken by the Polish authorities was 

proving inadequate to correct the country™s 

excessive deficit by the 2007 deadline. 
The government debt ratio remained 
substantially below 60% of GDP in 2006 in 

most non-euro area EU Member States. In 

Cyprus and Malta, the debt ratio remained 

above the 60% reference value, despite falling 

in 2006, while in Hungary it rose steeply to 

above 67% of GDP. In most of the other 

non-euro area EU Member States the debt ratio 

declined or remained broadly unchanged. 
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS 
The combined current and capital account of 

the non-euro area EU Member States continued 

to vary considerably across countries in 2006 

(see Table 9), although the overall picture 

showed a deterioration in comparison with 

2005. While Denmark and Sweden reported 

sizeable surpluses, the United Kingdom and the 

countries that joined the European Union in 

May 2004 all recorded deficits. Compared with 

2005, these deficits increased in most of the 

countries and particularly in Latvia, where the 

deficit level in 2006 stood at around 20% of 

GDP. Estonia and Lithuania registered deficits 

of more than 10% of GDP. In the Czech 

Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, Malta and Slovakia 

the deficit stood between 4% and 8% of GDP, 

and in the remaining countries more moderate 

deficits were recorded. 
In many of the countries that joined the 
European Union in May 2004, these deficits 

can be partly explained as a corollary of the 

catching-up process, to the extent that they 

reflect investments in productive capacity that 

would not have been possible solely on the 

basis of domestic savings. However, large 

current and capital account deficits in some 

non-euro area EU Member States could signal 

risks to the sustainability of external positions, 

particularly if driven by buoyant public or 

private consumption, high credit growth or 

residential investments. 
84ECB Annual Report
2006In comparison with 2005, net FDI inflows in 
2006 rose in most of the non-euro area EU 

Member States. Overall, while net FDI inflows 

continued to constitute an important source of 

financing in a number of non-euro area EU 

Member States, these inflows were often Œ 

particularly in the Baltic States Œ not sufficient 

to cover the combined current and capital 

account deficit. At the same time, net portfolio 

inflows remained negative or broadly neutral in 

all non-euro area EU Member States, with the 

exceptions of Hungary and Slovakia. In these 

two countries, net portfolio investment inflows 

were driven by higher net debt inflows Œ in some 

cases partly related to yield differentials Œ 

although net equity inflows also played a role. 

Other investment flows were largely positive in 

most of the countries that joined the European 

Union in May 2004, reflecting mainly loans from 

parent banks to their subsidiaries in the region. 
EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTS
Exchange rate developments in the non-euro 

area EU Member States in 2006 tended largely 
to reflect the exchange rate regimes of the 

individual countries. The currencies of 

Denmark, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, 

Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia all participated in 

ERM II with a standard fluctuation band of 

±15% around their central rates against the 

euro, except for the Danish krone where a 

narrower band of ±2.25% applied. The 

agreements on participation for the countries 

whose currencies joined ERM II in 2004 and 

2005 (i.e. all the countries listed above except 

Denmark) were based on a number of policy 

commitments by the respective authorities, 

relating, inter alia, to the pursuit of sound fiscal 

policies, the promotion of wage moderation and 

wage developments in line with productivity 

growth, the containment of credit growth and 

the implementation of further structural 

reforms. ERM II entry was also linked, in some 

cases, to unilateral commitments on the part of 

the countries concerned to maintain narrower 

fluctuation bands. These unilateral commitments 

placed no additional obligations on the ECB. In 

particular, it was agreed that the Estonian kroon

2006and the Lithuanian litas could join ERM II with 
their existing currency board arrangements in 

place. The Maltese authorities stated their 

intention to maintain the exchange rate of the 

Maltese lira at its central rate against the euro 

and the Latvian authorities that they would 

maintain the exchange rate of the lats at the 

central rate against the euro with a fluctuation 

band of ±1%. 
Participation in ERM II has been relatively 
smooth in the case of most of the participating 

currencies. The Danish krone, the Estonian 

kroon, the Cyprus pound, the Latvian lats, the 

Lithuanian litas, the Maltese lira and the 

Slovenian tolar were very stable against 

the euro in 2006. In early 2007 and until 

2 March 2007 these currencies Œ excluding the 

Slovenian tolar that converted irrevocably to 

the euro following euro area enlargement on 

1 January 2007 Œ traded continuously at, or 

very close to, their central rates. Only the 

Slovak koruna experienced a relatively high 

degree of volatility (see Table 10). Following 

parliamentary elections in Slovakia and a period 

of turbulence on international capital markets, 

the koruna came under downward pressure in 

the course of July and temporarily traded, for 

the first time, at a level lower than its ERM II 

central rate. However, supported by interventions 

by Národná banka Slovenska, renewed market 

confidence in the new government™s economic 

policy, sound macroeconomic developments 

and an improvement in global risk appetite, 
the currency appreciated from mid-July 

onwards. On 28 December 2006 Národná banka 

Slovenska intervened in the foreign exchange 

market to alleviate appreciation pressures. 

However, at the beginning of 2007, the Slovak 

koruna continued to appreciate and, on 2 March 

2007, traded 10.7% above its ERM II central 

rate. 
Turning to the currencies of the non-euro area 
EU Member States that were not participating 

in ERM II, developments varied across 

countries (see Chart 38). In 2006 the Czech 

koruna and the Swedish krona gradually 

appreciated against the euro but lost some 

ground at the beginning of 2007, respectively 

standing 3.0% and 1.1% stronger against the 

euro on 2 March 2007 than at the beginning of 

2006. Despite some fluctuation in the second 

half of 2006, the pound sterling strengthened 

from the beginning of July 2006 onwards, 

supported by positive economic developments 

in the United Kingdom and the expectation of 

higher interest rates. On 2 March 2007 the 

pound stood 1.4% above its January 2006 level. 

During the same period, the Hungarian forint 

and the Polish zloty depreciated slightly and 

experienced some exchange rate volatility. In 

the first half of 2006, both currencies depreciated 

strongly against the euro in reaction to rising 

global risk aversion towards emerging markets. 

In Hungary, downward pressure on the national 

currency may have also reflected the fiscal 

situation and market concerns about the

2006country™s external imbalances. From the 
beginning of July 2006, however, the forint and 

the zloty started to strengthen against the euro, 

supported by improvements in global risk 

appetite and, in the case of Hungary, by 

increased policy rates and the implementation 

of a fiscal consolidation plan. By 2 March 2007, 

the Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty had 

become broadly stable against the euro 

compared with the beginning of 2006. 
FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTSBetween January 2006 and February 2007, the 

evolution of long-term government bond yields 

in most of the non-euro area EU Member States 

was similar to the euro area, with an increase in 

the first part of the year followed by a slight 

decrease from June 2006 onwards. In February 

2007 long-term interest rates in the non-euro 

area EU Member States were, on average, 

around 60 basis points higher than at the 

beginning of 2006. The largest increase took 

place in Latvia (around 150 basis points), 

largely reflecting the deterioration in the 

inflation outlook. In the other non-euro area EU 

Member States, long-term interest rates rose 

less than in the euro area. Compared with euro 

area rates, government bond yield spreads in 

the non-euro area EU Member States in February 

2007 were, on average, lower than at the 

beginning of 2006. The long-term interest rate 
differential remained comparatively large in 

Hungary where, in February 2007, it stood at 

around 285 basis points. In this country, fiscal 

developments and external imbalances tended 

to keep long-term bond differentials high.
Stock markets in most non-euro area EU 
Member States performed favourably between 

January 2006 and February 2007. Stock markets 

rose most in Estonia, Cyprus and Poland, 

where they clearly outperformed the average 

stock price developments in the euro area as 

measured by the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 

index. However, the stock markets in all of 

the non-euro area EU Member States reacted 

negatively to the turbulence on the global 

market at the end of February.
In 2006 growth in credit to the private sector 
remained high in all non-euro area EU Member 

States (at an annual average of 24% year on 

year for the non-euro area EU Member States 

as a whole). Towards the end of 2006, annual 

credit growth appeared to decelerate or stabilise 

in many countries, although often at relatively 

high levels. A possible explanation for this 

development may be the interest rate increases 

implemented by the ECB and the majority of 

the non-euro area national central banks in 

2006 (see below), and the resulting tightening 

of the monetary policy stance. Credit expansion 

was the most dynamic in the fast-growing 

Baltic States (in Latvia close to 60% at the end 

of 2006) (see Chart 39). In the Czech Republic, 

Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, the 

annual growth of credit to the private sector 

increased to a level of 20% or above at the end 

of 2006. Rapid credit expansion in these 

catching-up economies needs to be seen in the 

context of financial deepening. Indeed, the 

ratios of credit to the private sector to GDP in 

all the countries that joined the European Union 

in May 2004, with the exceptions of Cyprus and 

Malta, remain well below the euro area average. 

Nevertheless, rapid credit expansion also poses 

a risk in terms of overheating and excessive 

external and internal imbalances. The large, 

rising share of foreign currency-denominated 

borrowing is of particular concern. In Denmark,

MONETARY POLICY
The primary objective for monetary policy in 

all non-euro area EU Member States is price 

stability. Monetary policy strategies, however, 

differ considerably from country to country 

(see Table 11). 
In 2006 the monetary policy and exchange rate 
regimes of the non-euro area EU Member States 

remained largely unchanged, although some 

refinements were made to monetary policy 

frameworks in a few countries with a view to 

future monetary integration. 
With regard to monetary policy decisions 
between January 2006 and February 2007, most 

central banks participating in ERM II adopted 
measures to tighten monetary policy conditions. 

These often mirrored moves by the ECB, which 

in 2006 raised the minimum bid rate on the 

main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem 

by a total of 125 basis points to 3.5%. In mid-
February 2006 Danmarks Nationalbank 

increased its key policy rate by 10 basis points 

to 2.5% on account of capital outflows earlier 

in the month stemming, inter alia, from 

purchases of foreign shares and other securities 

by Danish institutional investors. Subsequently, 

the national central bank followed the 

movements in the key ECB interest rates and 

increased its own main policy rate from 2.5% to 

3.75%. Eesti Pank and Lietuvos bankas, which 

have no official policy rates given their currency 

board arrangements, automatically adopted the 

changes in the ECB™s monetary policy stance. 

In addition, Eesti Pank adopted a number of 

precautionary financial sector policy measures, 

including increasing its reserve requirement 

ratio from 13% to 15% to address potential 

financial stability risks related to continuing 

strong credit growth, particularly in the form of 

mortgages. The Central Bank of Cyprus 

increased its key policy rate by 25 basis points 

to 4.5%, against the background of a tightening 

of monetary policy by the ECB and rising 

inflationary pressures. In a further attempt to 

tighten the liquidity conditions of the economy, 

Latvijas Banka increased its key interest rate in 

two steps, from 4% to 5%, and expanded the 

minimum reserve base to include banks™ 

liabilities with a set term of over two years. The 

Central Bank of Malta increased its central 

intervention rate three times Œ by a total of 

75 basis points Œ to 4.0%, against the background 

of the narrowing of the short-term interest rate 

differential vis-à-vis the euro in favour of the 

Maltese lira. Národná banka Slovenska 

increased its main policy rate in four different 

steps, from 3.0% to 4.75%, reflecting mainly 

upward revisions in its inflation forecasts due 

to higher energy prices. Finally, Banka 

Slovenije, which had to align its key policy rate 

(the 60-day tolar bill interest rate) with the euro 

area level prior to the adoption of the euro on 

1 January 2007, gradually lowered its main 

policy rate in the first half of 2006, keeping

Narodowy Bank Polski was the only non-euro 
area EU central bank outside ERM II to lower 

its key policy rate Œ in two steps, from 4.5% to

inflation outlook.CHAPTER 2CENTRAL BANK 
OPERATIONS
AND ACTIVITIES92ECB Annual Report
20061.1 MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS
The operational framework for the 
implementation of the single monetary policy1 continued to work efficiently in 2006, 

confirming the overall positive experience with 

the new features introduced into the framework 

in March 2004. The EONIA continued to 

register very low levels of volatility in 2006: 

the standard deviation of the spread between 

the EONIA and the minimum bid rate stood at 

5 basis points in 2006, the same level as in 2005 

and 4 basis points lower than in 2004. This low 

volatility in short-term money market interest 

rates contributed to a clear signalling of the 

monetary policy stance. Notwithstanding the 

generally stable money market conditions, the 

spread between the EONIA and the minimum 

bid rate continued to widen in 2006. In order to 

contain this widening spread, the ECB allotted 

more than the benchmark amount2 in the 
relevant main refinancing operations (MROs). 
Developments in 2006 provided the opportunity 
to further test the capability of the operational 

framework to neutralise within a maintenance 

period the impact of changes in expectations 

regarding the key ECB interest rates3. In all 
maintenance periods that preceded an increase 

in interest rates in 2006, the average spread 

between the EONIA and the minimum bid rate 

was between 7 and 8 basis points, with the 

exception of the maintenance period ending on 

8 August, when it stood at 5 basis points. These 

spreads were comparable with those observed 

in maintenance periods which were not followed 

by an increase in key ECB interest rates, where 

the average spread stood at 8 basis points. 

Compared with the situation before the 

framework was changed in March 2004, when 

the average spread in maintenance periods with 

a rate increase amounted to 17 basis points Œ 

much larger than the spread typically observed 

Œ the experience in 2006 suggests that the 

amended framework has significantly helped to 

shield short-term money market interest rates 

from the impact of changes in interest rate 

expectations. 
ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY 

CONDITIONSThe Eurosystem™s liquidity management relies 

on the daily assessment of the liquidity 

conditions in the euro area banking system in 

order to determine the liquidity needs of the 

system and thus the volume of liquidity to be 

allotted in the weekly MROs, and potentially 

through other open market operations such as 

fine-tuning operations. The liquidity needs of 

the banking system are defined by the sum of 

reserve requirements imposed on banks, by 

funds held in excess of these requirements on 

credit institutions™ current accounts with their 

NCBs (excess reserves) and by autonomous 

factors. The latter are a set of items on the 

Eurosystem™s balance sheet which have an 

impact on banks™ liquidity needs but are 

not normally under the direct control of 

the Eurosystem™s liquidity management

required to establish balanced conditions in the short-term 

money market, given the ECB™s complete liquidity forecast. The 

published benchmark allotment is rounded to the nearest •500 

million.3 Changes in the key ECB interest rates are, under the amended 
framework of March 2004, implemented only at the start of the 

new maintenance period.Chart 40

2006(e.g. banknotes in circulation, government 
deposits and net foreign assets). 
In 2006 the daily liquidity needs of the euro 
area banking system amounted to •422.4 billion 

on average, representing an increase of 12% 

compared with 2005. On average, reserve 

requirements stood at •163.7 billion, excess 

reserves at •0.7 billion and autonomous factors 

at •257.9 billion. Among the autonomous 

factors, banknotes in circulation rose by 12% in 

2006, as compared with an annual growth rate 

of around 15% in 2005. Banknotes reached an 

all-time high of •629.2 billion on 28 December 

2006. 
MAIN REFINANCING OPERATIONS
MROs are weekly liquidity-providing operations 

with a maturity of one week, conducted as 

variable rate tenders with a minimum bid rate 

following the multiple rate auction procedure. 

They are the most important open market 

operations conducted by the Eurosystem as 

they play a pivotal role in steering interest 

rates, managing the liquidity situation in the 

market and signalling the stance of monetary 

policy through the level of the minimum bid 

rate. 
To help credit institutions to prepare their bids 
in the MROs, the ECB continued in 2006 to 

publish a forecast each week of the average 

daily autonomous factors and the benchmark 

amount. The purpose of this communication 

policy is to avoid misperceptions in the market 

as to whether or not the allotment decisions in 

MROs aim to balance liquidity conditions. 
In 2006 the amounts allotted in MROs ranged 
from •280 billion to •338 billion. The average 

number of bidders was 377, showing a slight 

increase in the participation level since the 

implementation of the new framework in March 

2004. The liquidity provided through MROs 

represented, on average, 73% of the overall net 

liquidity supplied by the Eurosystem through 

monetary policy operations. The average spread 

between the marginal rate and the minimum bid 

rate amounted to 5.5 basis points, compared 
with 5.3 basis points in 2005 and 1.6 basis 

points in 2004. 
Having observed an upward drift in the spread 
between the marginal rate and the minimum bid 

rate, in October 2005 the ECB initiated a policy 

of allotting •1 billion more than the benchmark 

amount in all except the last MRO of a 

maintenance period. Subsequently, between 

October 2005 and March 2006, the spread 

stabilised at 5 basis points on average. However, 

it started to rise again in April 2006, reaching 

9 basis points at the end of the month. In 

response, the ECB again communicated its 

uneasiness with regard to such a drift, as it had 

done in October 2005, and increased the 

allotment in excess of the benchmark amount 

from •1 to •2 billion. The measure was extended 

to the last MRO of a maintenance period, with 

the ECB still aiming for balanced liquidity 

conditions at the end of the reserve maintenance 

period. This policy reduced the spread and the 

ECB therefore gradually returned to the 

benchmark allotment in September 2006. When 

the spread rose again in October, the ECB 

allotted •1 billion more than the benchmark 

amount and continued this policy until 

December 2006, when it gradually increased 

the allotment further above the benchmark in 

order to foster smooth conditions in the short-
term money market during the holiday season 

and around the turn of the year. 
FINE-TUNING OPERATIONS
As a consequence of the changes to the 

operational framework implemented in March 

2004, the number of days between the last MRO 

allotment and the last day of a maintenance 

period increased, leading to a greater risk of 

errors in the Eurosystem™s forecast of 

autonomous liquidity factors and thus to 

potentially larger liquidity imbalances. The 

absolute difference between the forecast and 

the actual outcome over eight days reached, on 

average, •7.21 billion in 2006. In order to 

prevent these errors from triggering significant 

recourse to standing facilities, and to avoid 

large spreads between the overnight rate and 

the minimum bid rate, the Eurosystem carried 
94ECB Annual Report
2006out fine-tuning operations on the last day of the 
reserve maintenance period whenever it 

expected a notable liquidity imbalance. In total, 

eleven fine-tuning operations were carried out 

in 2006, five of them liquidity-providing 

(17 January, 7 February, 11 April, 10 October 

and 12 December) and six liquidity-absorbing 

(7 March, 9 May, 14 June, 11 July, 8 August and 

5 September). 
LONGER-TERM REFINANCING OPERATIONS
Longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) 

are liquidity-providing operations conducted 

on a monthly basis. They are usually allotted on 

the last Wednesday of the month and have a 

three-month maturity, thereby giving banks the 

opportunity to cover their liquidity needs for a 

longer period of time. In contrast to MROs, 

LTROs are not used to signal the Eurosystem™s 

monetary policy stance. They are conducted as 

pure variable rate tenders with a pre-announced 

allotment volume, and the Eurosystem therefore 

acts as a rate-taker. 
On average, LTROs represented 27% of the 
total net liquidity provided through open market 

operations in 2006. The ECB allotted the 

intended volume in all LTROs of 2006. The 

allotment volume in each operation was 

increased from •30 billion to •40 billion in 

January 2006 and to •50 billion in January 

2007. 
STANDING FACILITIES
The two standing facilities offered by the 

Eurosystem, i.e. the marginal lending facility 

and the deposit facility, provide and absorb 

overnight liquidity at interest rates which form 

a corridor for the interbank overnight rate. In 

2006 the width of the corridor remained 

unchanged at 200 basis points, centred around 

the minimum bid rate of the MROs. In the 

course of the year the marginal lending and 

deposit facility rates were both raised by a total 

of 125 basis points, ending the year at 4.50% 

and 2.50% respectively. 
In 2006 the average daily recourse to the 
marginal lending facility amounted to •126 
million, while the average daily recourse to the 

deposit facility amounted to •171 million. The 

low recourse to the standing facilities in 2006 

was in line with previous years and reflects the 

high efficiency of the interbank market, as well 

as the lower liquidity imbalances observed on 

the last day of the reserve maintenance periods. 

This reduction in liquidity imbalances is 

consistent with the recourse to fine-tuning 

operations in the event of notable liquidity 

forecast errors. 
MINIMUM RESERVE SYSTEM
Credit institutions in the euro area must hold 

minimum reserves on accounts with the NCBs. 

The minimum reserves amount to 2% of a credit 

institution™s reserve base, which is determined 

in relation to elements of the institution™s 

balance sheet. The minimum reserve obligation 

must be fulfilled on average over a reserve 

maintenance period. The system has two 

functions: first, to stabilise short-term money 

market rates through the averaging provision, 

and second, to enlarge the liquidity deficit, 

i.e. banks™ overall need for refinancing from the 

Eurosystem. The amount of required reserves 

gradually increased in 2006, reaching •174.3 

billion during the last maintenance period of 

the year, compared with •153.3 billion in the 

corresponding period one year earlier. 
ELIGIBLE ASSETS FOR MONETARY POLICY 

OPERATIONS 
The Eurosystem is required to conduct its credit 

operations based on adequate collateral. This 

requirement aims to protect the Eurosystem 

from losses and to ensure that sufficient 

collateral is available for potential counterparty 

use. Credit operations must also be conducted 

in an efficient and transparent manner and allow 

equal access by Eurosystem counterparties. For 

these reasons, the Eurosystem accepts a broad 

range of assets as collateral. 
In 2006 the average amount of eligible 
marketable collateral increased by 6% compared 

with 2005, to a total of •8.8 trillion (see 

Chart 41). General government debt, at •4.5 

trillion, accounted for 52% of the total, with the 
95ECB Annual Report
2006remainder taking the form of credit institution 
covered (i.e. Pfandbrief-style) or credit 

institution uncovered bonds (•2.6 trillion, or 

29%), corporate bonds (•0.8 trillion, or 9%), 

asset-backed securities (•0.5 trillion, or 6%), 

and other bonds, such as those issued by 

supranational organisations, (•0.3 trillion, or 

4%). The average value of marketable assets 

deposited by counterparties as collateral against 

Eurosystem credit operations stood at •930 

billion in 2006, compared with •866 billion in 

2005 (see Chart 42).Chart 43 illustrates the difference between the 
assets eligible to be used as collateral (but not 

necessarily their weight on counterparties™ 

balance sheets) and those actually put forward 

as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations, 

broken down by asset type. Government debt 

accounted for 52% of the available marketable 

collateral, but only 28% of collateral put 

forward. However, credit institution uncovered 

bonds accounted for 16% of available 

marketable collateral, but for 32% of the amount 

of collateral put forward. Asset-backed 

securities accounted for 6% of available 

collateral, but for 12% of the collateral used. 
The Eurosystem continued to enhance its 

collateral framework in 2006. In particular, the 

preparatory work for the gradual introduction 

of a single framework for eligible collateral 

(also referred to as the ﬁsingle listﬂ), common 

to all Eurosystem credit operations, was 

finalised in line with the timetable announced 

by the Governing Council in February 2005. 
The first step of this gradual introduction, 
involving marketable assets, was completed in 

2005. The preparatory work for the second step 

was completed in 2006, and on 1 January 2007 

a distinct asset class, namely non-marketable 

assets, including in particular credit claims 

(also referred to as bank loans), was introduced.4 The two-tier collateral system that has been in 

place since the start of Monetary Union will be 

completely replaced by the single list as of 

31 May 2007. 
The single collateral framework has been 
introduced in response to the drawbacks of the

2006two-tier collateral framework against the 
background of an increasing degree of financial 

market integration in the euro area. It is intended 

to promote a level playing-field in the euro 

area, further ensuring equal treatment for 

counterparties and issuers, and increasing the 

overall transparency of the collateral framework. 

The single collateral framework also takes into 

account the rising demand for collateralisation 

in private wholesale markets and the increased 

use of collateral by the Eurosystem. More 

generally, by increasing the liquidity of an 

entire asset class, such as credit claims, the 

single collateral framework promotes the 

smooth functioning of the euro area financial 

system and more closely reflects the assets side 

of counterparties™ balance sheets. 
The Eurosystem has defined specific eligibility 
criteria and a credit assessment framework 

which are applicable to non-marketable assets 

across the euro area. They ensure that these 

assets comply with collateral standards similar 

to those for marketable assets. For credit claims, 

an interim period until 31 December 2011 is 

foreseen, in which a limited number of eligibility 

and operational criteria will continue to differ 

across the euro area. In particular, during this 

interim period, the NCBs may set the minimum 

size threshold for credit claims eligible for 
domestic use and may decide whether a handling 

fee should be applied for their use. Tier two 

assets that do not qualify under the eligibility 

criteria for the single framework will be phased 

out by 31 May 2007. 
New eligibility criteria for asset-backed 
securities have been applied since May 2006. 

The new criteria restrict eligibility to ﬁtrue 

saleﬂ types of instrument and thereby mainly 

aim to exclude both funded and unfunded asset-
backed securities for which the credit risk has 

been transferred synthetically using credit 

derivatives. In addition, only non-subordinated 

tranches5 are eligible. Asset-backed securities 
which had previously been eligible but did not 

fulfil the new criteria remained eligible until 

15 October 2006. Units of French fonds 

communs de créances will remain eligible for a 

transitional period until the end of 2008. 
In September 2006 the Eurosystem decided that 
the Short-Term European Paper (STEP) market 

would be accepted as a non-regulated market 

for collateral purposes in Eurosystem credit 

operations, as soon as the STEP statistics on 

yields were published on the ECB™s website. 

Notes issued under STEP-compliant programmes 

will have to comply with the general eligibility 

criteria for marketable assets. 
Furthermore, in order to qualify as eligible 
collateral, international debt securities in global 

bearer form must, since 1 January 2007, be 

issued in the form of New Global Notes and 

must be deposited with a common safekeeper. 

International debt securities in global bearer 

form that were issued in the form of classical 

global notes prior to 1 January 2007 will remain 

eligible until maturity.

that tranche (or sub-tranche) is given priority (post-enforcement) 

over other tranches or sub-tranches in respect of receiving

2006RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUESThe Eurosystem™s collateral framework aims, 
among other things, to translate the statutory 

requirement of adequate collateralisation into 

concrete tools and procedures that guarantee 

sufficient mitigation of the financial risks in 

reverse transactions. For this goal to be 

achieved, the collateral accepted in each 

transaction must be of a quality and quantity 

such that, in the event of a counterparty default 

and a subsequent realisation of the collateral in 

the market, the Eurosystem is very likely to be 

able to recover the full amount of its claim. 
Risk mitigation in the framework of the 
Eurosystem™s liquidity-providing reverse 

operations is based on three elements: 
Œ The Eurosystem uses assets of a high credit 
quality to collateralise its operations. The 
Eurosystem credit assessment framework 

(ECAF) defines the procedures, rules and 

techniques which ensure that all eligible 

assets in the single list of collateral meet the 

Eurosystem™s high credit standards. For the 

collateral eligible for Eurosystem credit 

operations, the credit quality threshold is 

defined in terms of a ﬁsingle Aﬂ credit 

assessment.6 The ECAF ensures the 
consistency, accuracy and comparability of 

the four credit assessment sources7 on which 
it relies. In preparation for the launch of the 

single list of collateral on 1 January 2007, 

the Eurosystem finalised the ECAF during 

2006 so that it would encompass both 

marketable and non-marketable assets. 
Œ Collateral needs to be valued accurately and 
on a daily basis. In the absence of a valid 

market price for a particular asset on the 

business day preceding the valuation date, 

the Eurosystem defines a theoretical price. 

In April 2006 two Eurosystem valuation 

hubs started operations to provide theoretical 

valuations: one operated by the Deutsche 

Bundesbank for the valuation of complex 

fixed income debt instruments and one 

operated by the Banque de France for the 

valuation of asset-backed securities. 
Œ To address market and liquidity risks, risk 
control measures are applied to the collateral 

after it has been valued. While protecting 

the Eurosystem from financial risks in its 

operations, these measures aim to avoid 

penalising counterparties and to allow them 

to use eligible assets efficiently. In 2006 the 

Eurosystem therefore defined a unified 

methodological framework for deriving 

haircut schedules for both marketable and 

non-marketable eligible assets, again in 

view of the launch of the single list on 

1 January 2007. 
1.2 FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS
In 2006 the ECB did not undertake any 

interventions in the foreign exchange market 

for policy reasons. Its foreign exchange 

transactions were exclusively related to 

investment activity. Furthermore, the ECB did 

not undertake any foreign exchange operations

The standing agreement between the ECB and 
the IMF to facilitate the initiation of special 

drawing right (SDR) transactions by the IMF 

on behalf of the ECB with other SDR holders 

was activated on three occasions in 2006. 
1.3 INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES 
The ECB™s investment activities are organised 

in such a way as to ensure that no insider 

information about central bank policy actions 

may be used when making investment decisions. 

A set of rules and procedures, known as the 

Chinese wall, separates the business units 

involved in operational investment activities 

from other business units. 
FOREIGN RESERVE MANAGEMENT
The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio reflects 

transfers of foreign reserves from the euro area 

NCBs to the ECB, as well as past foreign 

exchange and gold operations of the ECB. The 

main purpose of the ECB™s foreign reserves is 

to ensure that, whenever needed, the Eurosystem 

has a sufficient amount of liquid resources for 

its foreign exchange policy operations involving 

non-EU currencies. The objectives for the 

management of the ECB™s foreign reserves are, 

in order of importance, liquidity, security and 

return. 
The ECB™s portfolio consists of US dollars, 
Japanese yen, gold and SDRs. Gold and SDR 

holdings were not actively invested in 2006. 

The ECB carried out gold sales amounting to 

around 80 tonnes of gold in total in the course 

of the year. These sales were in full conformity 

with the Central Bank Gold Agreement 

published on 8 March 2004, to which the ECB 

is a signatory. The total proceeds of the gold 

sales were added to the Japanese yen 

portfolio. 
The value of the ECB™s net foreign reserve 
assets8 at current exchange rates and market 
prices decreased from •43.5 billion9 at end-2005 to •42.3 billion at end-2006, of which 

•32.0 billion was in foreign currencies Œ the 

Japanese yen and the US dollar Œ and •10.3 

billion was in gold and SDRs. Applying the 

exchange rates of end-2006, US dollar-

denominated assets represented 83% of the 

foreign currency reserves, while those 

denominated in Japanese yen accounted for 

17%. The change in the value of the portfolio 

during 2006 mainly reflected the depreciation 

of the US dollar and the Japanese yen vis-à-vis 

the euro, which was only partially compensated 

for by the appreciation of gold and by the 

positive net returns (comprising capital gains 

and interest income) generated by portfolio 

management activities. 
The new operational framework for the ECB™s 
foreign reserve management was implemented 

smoothly in January 2006. Each NCB may now 

as a rule manage only one portfolio (i.e. either 

a US dollar or a Japanese yen portfolio), with 

two NCBs currently managing two.10 This 
change was aimed at increasing the efficiency 

of the decentralised execution of investment 

operations within the Eurosystem. 
In 2006 work continued on extending the list of 
eligible instruments in which foreign reserves 

can be invested. Foreign exchange swaps for 

investment purposes and US STRIPs11 were 
added to this list. Progress was also made in the 

work on the introduction of interest rate swaps, 

with the internal testing of systems almost 

complete. A pilot project has been set up to 
8 Net foreign reserve assets are calculated as official reserve 
assets, plus deposits in foreign currency with residents, minus 
future predetermined net drains on foreign currency holdings 

owing to repos and forward transactions. For detailed information, 

see www.ecb.int/stats/external/reserves/templates/html/index.

en.html9 The amount quoted in the Annual Report 2005 (•41.0 billion) 
was based only on official reserve asset figures. This publication 

applies a refinement of the definition of net reserve assets, 

which is explained in footnote 8.10 For more details, see the article entitled ﬁPortfolio management 
at the ECBﬂ in the April 2006 issue of the ECB™s Monthly 

Bulletin.11 STRIP stands for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and

2006establish an automatic securities lending 
programme (ASLP), and the ECB will appoint 

a contractor to supply an ASLP for the US 

dollar portfolio. 
OWN FUNDS MANAGEMENT 
The ECB™s own funds portfolio consists of the 

invested counterpart of the ECB™s paid-up 

capital, as well as amounts held from time to 

time in its general reserve fund and its provision 

against foreign exchange rate, interest rate and 

gold price risks. The purpose of this portfolio is 

to provide the ECB with income to help to 

cover its operating expenses. The objective of 

its management is to generate returns over the 

long term in excess of the average main 

refinancing rate of the ECB. The portfolio is 

invested in euro-denominated assets. 
The value of the portfolio at current market 
prices grew from •6.4 billion at end-2005 to 

•7.5 billion at end-2006. Most of the increase 

in market value was due to the investment in 

the own funds portfolio of the provision against 

foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 

price risks established by the ECB in 2005. 

Investment returns also contributed positively 

to the increase in market value. 
In the course of the year, zero coupon bonds 
and high-quality commercial paper issued by 

entities already eligible for the investment of 

own funds were added to the investment options 

available for the management of this portfolio. 

Furthermore, the list of eligible issuers of 

covered bonds and senior unsecured bonds was 

expanded. 
RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUESThrough its investment activities, the ECB is 

exposed to financial risks, such as market, 

credit and liquidity risks. These risks are 

managed through strict policies and procedures, 

a comprehensive limit structure and the daily 

monitoring of compliance with the limits.12 The 
ECB™s risk management framework for 

investment operations was further enhanced 

during 2006. As regards the management of 

interest rate risk, binding relative Value-at-Risk 
(VaR)
13 limits for portfolios vis-à-vis 
benchmarks were introduced, replacing duration 

limits. 
The dominant risk to which the ECB is exposed 
is market risk. A breakdown of the VaR of the 

ECB™s investment portfolios reveals that, at 

any conventional confidence level, more than 

nine-tenths of the market risk is due to currency 

and gold price risk, with the rest stemming from 

interest rate risk. VaR estimates of the ECB™s 

credit risk are even lower than those of the 

interest rate risk, as credit risk is mitigated 

through strict eligibility criteria and limits on 

countries, issuers and counterparties. 
Financial risks are largely determined by the 
size and currency composition of the ECB™s 

foreign reserves and, to a lesser extent, by the 

asset allocation within the different currency 

portfolios. However, the low interest rate risk 

also reflects the relatively low modified 

duration of the ECB™s investment portfolios.

that will be exceeded at the end of horizon T with probability

difficult and subject to more assumptions than the calculation 

of market risk VaR figures.
100ECB Annual Report
2006The Eurosystem has the statutory task of 
promoting the smooth operation of payment 

systems. Its main instrument for carrying out 

this task Œ besides the oversight function (see 

Section 4 of Chapter 4) Œ is the provision of 

facilities to ensure efficient and sound clearing 

and payment systems. To this end, the 

Eurosystem created the Trans-European 

Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express 

Transfer system, known as TARGET, for large-

value payments in euro. Work is already well 

advanced on the development of a second-
generation system, TARGET2. It is envisaged 

that the first group of countries will migrate to 

TARGET2 on 19 November 2007. 
With regard to securities settlement, the 
Eurosystem and the market offer a number of 

channels to facilitate the use of collateral across 

national borders. In addition, the Eurosystem is 

evaluating opportunities to provide securities 

settlement services in central bank money to 

CSDs on the Single Shared Platform with 

harmonised procedures that will be used for 

TARGET2 payment services (TARGET2-

Securities). 
2.1 THE TARGET SYSTEM
The present TARGET system is a ﬁsystem of 

systemsﬂ made up of the national real-time 

gross settlement (RTGS) systems of 17 EU 

Member States, the ECB payment mechanism 

(EPM) and an interlinking mechanism that 

enables the processing of payments between the 

linked systems. 
In 2006 TARGET continued to contribute to the 
smooth functioning of the euro money market 

and, because the Eurosystem™s credit operations 

are processed via this system, continued to play 

an important role in the implementation of the 

single monetary policy. Since TARGET offers 

a real-time settlement service in central bank 

money and broad market coverage, it also 

attracted a variety of other payments. TARGET 

functioned smoothly and successfully in 2006 

and continued its trend of settling an increasing 
number of large-value euro payments. This is in 

line with the Eurosystem™s policy objective of 

promoting settlement in central bank money as 

a uniquely safe means of payment. In 2006, 

89% of the total turnover of large-value 

payments in euro was executed via TARGET. 

TARGET is available for all credit transfers in 

euro between connected banks, without any 

upper or lower value limit. Such transfers may 

be made both between banks in the same 

Member State (intra-Member State traffic) and 

between those in different Member States 

(inter-Member State traffic). 
A survey conducted in 2006 revealed that as 
at 31 December 2005 there were 10,564 

participants in TARGET. Overall, around 

53,000 institutions, in particular branches of 

participants, can be addressed through TARGET 

using a Bank Identifier Code (BIC). 
Following its decision not to join TARGET2, 
in 2006 Sveriges Riksbank prepared for 

the disconnection of its TARGET component, 

E-RIX, effective as of 2 January 2007. 
TARGET OPERATIONS
In 2006 the daily average of payments processed 

by TARGET increased by 10% both in volume 

and in value. Table 12 provides an overview of 

the payment traffic in TARGET in 2006, 

comparing it with the traffic in the previous 

year. In 2006 the overall availability of 

TARGET, i.e. the extent to which participants 

were able to use TARGET during its business 

hours without incident, reached 99.87%. 

96.75% of inter-Member State payments were 

processed within five minutes. 
2 PAYMENT AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT 
SYSTEMS
101ECB Annual Report
2006CONTINGENCY MEASURES FOR SYSTEMICALLY 
IMPORTANT PAYMENTS IN TARGET
Owing to the TARGET system™s pivotal role in 

the market and its broad market coverage, 

suitable protection against a wide range of 

threats is essential for the reliable and smooth 

functioning of the system. It is of the utmost 

importance that systemically important 

payments Œ i.e. those that could cause a systemic 

risk if not processed when due Œ be carried out 

without delay, even in abnormal circumstances. 

The Eurosystem has established contingency 

measures to ensure that such payments are 

processed in an orderly manner, even in the 

event of TARGET malfunctioning. In 2006 a 

number of further trials were carried out by 

central banks (often involving commercial 

banks), and these proved the effectiveness of 

the TARGET contingency measures. They 

confirmed that the Eurosystem is in a good 

position to ensure that payment systems and 

financial markets can continue to function 

smoothly in a crisis situation. 
TARGET CONNECTION FOR THE NCBs OF THE 

MEMBER STATES THAT JOINED THE EU IN 2004
In October 2002 the Governing Council decided 

that, following EU enlargement in 2004, the 

NCBs of the new Member States would be 

allowed Œ but not obliged Œ to connect to the 

current TARGET system. Given the limited 

remaining lifetime of the current TARGET 

system, and in order to save costs, the 

Eurosystem developed alternatives to full 

integration which allow the NCBs of the 

Member States which joined the EU in 2004 to 

connect their systems to the current TARGET 

system. 
Following Narodowy Bank Polski™s connection 
to TARGET via the Banca d™Italia™s RTGS 

system in 2005, on 20 November 2006 Eesti 

Pank™s euro RTGS system was also connected 

to TARGET via the Banca d™Italia™s system. 

Slovenian banks have been able to use TARGET 

since July 2005 by means of remote access to 

the German TARGET component. With regard 

to Slovenia™s entry into the euro area in January 

2007, Banka Slovenije decided, for efficiency 

reasons, not to develop its own euro RTGS 

system, but to use the RTGS system of the 

Deutsche Bundesbank to connect to TARGET. 

Banka Slovenije commenced operations as a 

member of the Eurosystem on 2 January 2007. 
RELATIONS WITH TARGET USERS AND RTGS 

SYSTEM OPERATORS OF OTHER CURRENCY AREAS
The ESCB maintains close relations with 

TARGET users in order to ensure that their 

needs are given due consideration and receive 

an appropriate response. In 2006, as in previous 

years, regular meetings were held between the 

NCBs linked to TARGET and the national 

TARGET user groups. In addition, joint 

meetings of the ESCB™s Working Group on 

TARGET2 and the TARGET Working Group of 

the European banking industry were held to 

discuss TARGET operational issues. Strategic 

issues were addressed in the Contact Group on 

Euro Payments Strategy, a forum in which the 

senior management of commercial and central 

banks is represented. The Eurosystem, as

RTGS system operators of other key currency 

areas in 2006. Increasing interrelations, such as 

those stemming from Continuous Linked 

Settlement (CLS) operations, have created the 

need for joint discussions on operational 

issues. 
2.2 TARGET2 
On 21 July 2006 the Governing Council released 

a ﬁCommunication on TARGET2ﬂ which 

explained the slight amendments to the 

TARGET2 core pricing scheme, described the 

basic elements of the pricing for ancillary 

system services, and provided information on 

the different ways of participating in TARGET2. 

The communication also specified the new 

pricing scheme for the optional liquidity pooling 

service and some other new pricing elements. 

These specifications ensure that the pricing of 

TARGET2 covers all types of access to the 

system. 
In addition, on 22 November 2006 the Governing 
Council released its third progress report on 

TARGET2. This report updated market 

participants on the Eurosystem™s decisions on 

the outstanding pricing and legal issues, as well 

as on contingency procedures and the 

forthcoming testing and migration activities. It 

also reported that the preparatory work was 

proceeding as envisaged and confirmed 

19 November 2007 as the starting date for 

TARGET2. The dates of the two subsequent 

migration waves, after which all central banks 

and TARGET users will have migrated to 

TARGET2, were also confirmed (18 February 

and 19 May 2008). 
With respect to the core pricing scheme, the 
Governing Council decided to add an additional 

volume band to the degressive fee structure of 

12.5 euro cent for every payment in excess of 

100,000 payments per month. This change to 

the core pricing scheme was made possible by 
an upward revision of volume expectations 

after an analysis of past volume trends in the 

current TARGET system suggested higher 

sustainable growth than initially foreseen. 
The Governing Council also decided on the 
three elements of the ancillary system pricing 

scheme. First, a fixed fee of •12,000 per year 

will be charged to each ancillary system that 

settles in central bank money, irrespective of 

whether it settles in the RTGS system or in the 

central bank™s local home accounts. A second 

fixed fee of between •5,000 and •50,000 per 

year will be charged to ancillary systems on the 

basis of their underlying gross value. Third, 

ancillary systems will be charged a transaction 

fee for which they can choose between a flat fee 

and a degressive fee (both of which will also 

have a fixed-fee element). 
It was also decided to lower the price of liquidity 
pooling in order to make it more attractive for 

banks.14 Liquidity pooling is considered to be a 
useful function since it makes it possible to 

overcome the liquidity fragmentation inherent 

to the decentralised holding of accounts with 

the Eurosystem. Furthermore, group pricing 

will apply within a group of accounts, which 

means that the degressive transaction fee will 

be applied to all payments of the group as if 

they were sent from one account. 
In terms of participation, TARGET2 provides 
for the ﬁclassicﬂ options of direct and indirect 

participation. Participation can also be 

organised through ﬁmulti-addressee accessﬂ, 

meaning that a direct participant can authorise 

its branches and/or subsidiaries, if they are 

located in the EEA and belong to the group, to 

channel payments through its RTGS account 

without its involvement. Moreover, any client 

of a direct participant which has a BIC can send 

payment orders or receive payments through its 

direct participant in TARGET2 (ﬁaddressable 

BIC accessﬂ). From a technical and operational 

point of view, addressable BIC access is similar 
14 For further information, see the ECB™s ﬁCommunication on 
TARGET2ﬂ, published on 21 July 2006 (http://www.ecb.int/
pub/pub/paym/html/index.en.html).103ECB Annual Report
2006to indirect participation, with the difference 
that, in the latter case, the indirect participant 

is recognised by the system and therefore 

benefits from the protective provisions set out 

in the relevant national law implementing the 

Settlement Finality Directive, provided that the 

scope of that law extends to indirect 

participants. 
In addition to the technical development of the 
Single Shared Platform (SSP), work in 2006 

focused on the legal framework for TARGET2, 

the development of internal operational 

procedures and the definition of user testing 

activities. It is envisaged that the user testing 

activities will start in May 2007, while the first 

group of countries will migrate to TARGET2 on 

19 November 2007. A user-focused project 

plan was provided to the banking community 

on 11 July 2006 to give an indication of the 

major milestones in the TARGET2 project. 
Relevant and updated information is regularly 
published on the ECB and NCB websites 

dedicated to TARGET2, for example: 
Œ On 17 February 2006 the Eurosystem 
provided information on the overlap between 
the TARGET2 migration and the SWIFTNet 

Phase 2 migration. It was recommended that 

the SWIFTNet Phase 2 migration be 

completed prior to the TARGET2 migration, 

although there is no technical dependency 

between the two migrations. 
Œ The national migration profiles were 
regularly updated between April and 

November 2006. These profiles show, for 

each central bank, which SSP modules will 

be used and how ancillary systems will 

settle from the first day after migration to 

TARGET2. As a complement to these 

profiles, an overview of the use of 

proprietary home accounts by central banks 

was published on 30 October 2006. 
Œ A final version of the user handbook for the 
Information and Control Module of the SSP 

was published on 7 December 2006, while 
intermediate updates of User Detailed 

Functional Specifications book 4 on XML 

messages and their corresponding XML 

scheme files were published throughout the 

year.
Œ A preliminary version of the TARGET2 user 
testing guide, outlining test procedures and 

certification scenarios for participants, was 

published on 7 November 2006. In addition, 

a web-based application was made available 

online on 31 January 2007 to provide future 

TARGET2 participants with test-related 

information. 
2.3 TARGET2-SECURITIES
On 7 July 2006 the ECB announced that the 

Eurosystem was evaluating opportunities to 

provide settlement services for securities 

transactions in euro which are settled in central 

bank money. 
Under the current arrangements, euro area 
central securities depositories (CSDs) settle the 

central bank money leg of securities transactions 

in euro through the local RTGS component of 

the TARGET system. For this settlement 

procedure to be possible, CSD participants 

must also participate in the national RTGS 

system of the country where the CSD is located, 

i.e. institutions participating as a settlement 

member in more than one CSD need to maintain 

a settlement account in each TARGET 

component concerned. 
With the introduction of TARGET2, it will 
become technically possible for each TARGET2 

participant to settle, through a single TARGET2 

account, transactions effected via any CSD that 

provides settlement in central bank money in 

euro. The possibility provided by TARGET2 to 

centralise the cash settlement in a single account 

is likely to increase the market demand for also 

centralising the securities settlement through a 

single securities account. This would enable 

TARGET2 participants to optimise their 

liquidity management for collateralised and 
104ECB Annual Report
2006uncollateralised money market transactions 
and, therefore, to fully exploit the benefits 

of TARGET2. The option for TARGET2 

participants to manage their securities portfolio 

in an integrated way with the TARGET2 cash 

account will be provided if a common 

Eurosystem service for the settlement of 

securities transactions is implemented. This 

platform would only provide settlement services 

to CSDs, while the other CSD functions (such 

as corporate actions, custody functions, 

safekeeping and administration) would continue 

to be offered by the CSDs. Synergies for the 

market with other facilities operated by the 

Eurosystem will be sought, in particular in 

connection with the TARGET2 system. 
A potential new service, called TARGET2-
Securities, was announced by the Eurosystem, 

and subsequent discussions were held at the 

national and the European level with CSDs and 

other market participants. On 28 September the 

preliminary market feedback on TARGET2-

Securities was published on the ECB™s website. 

While the whole industry requested further 

details from the Eurosystem on this initiative, 

banks generally saw more potential opportunities 

than CSDs. The project received firm backing 

from the European Commission. 
On 20 October 2006 the ECB announced that 
the Governing Council had invited its Payment 

and Settlement Systems Committee to prepare 

a detailed feasibility study to examine the 

operational, economic, legal and technical 

viability of TARGET2-Securities. As part of 

the preparations for the Governing Council™s 

decision on whether to launch the TARGET2-

Securities project, the ECB established contacts 

with market participants and infrastructures to 

present the main technical options envisaged 

for TARGET2-Securities. From mid-December 

2006 a number of meetings were held with 

various stakeholders to discuss a wide range of 

issues related to the initiative. 
The implementation of the TARGET2-Securities 
facility, which would be fully owned and 

operated by the Eurosystem, would potentially 
lead to large cost savings as a result of the high 

level of efficiency and technical harmonisation 

that it would provide for market participants, 

particularly in the field of cross-border business. 

TARGET2-Securities would represent a major 

step towards a single Eurosystem interface with 

the market. In addition, it could also become 

the interface with the Eurosystem collateral 

management system and thereby facilitate pan-
European liquidity management. Synergies 

with other facilities operated by the Eurosystem 

Œ in particular TARGET2 and solutions for the 

cross-border use of collateral Œ could be 

expected. 
2.4 SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES FOR COLLATERAL 
Eligible assets may be used across national 

borders to collateralise all types of Eurosystem 

credit operation by means of the correspondent 

central banking model (CCBM) or through 

eligible links between euro area securities 

settlement systems (SSSs). The CCBM is 

provided by the Eurosystem, while eligible 

links are a market-led solution. 
The amount of cross-border collateral held by 
the Eurosystem increased from •444 billion in 

December 2005 to •514 billion in December 

2006. Overall, at the end of 2006 cross-border 

collateral represented 52.3% of the total 

collateral provided to the Eurosystem. In 2006, 

for the first time, cross-border use of collateral 

exceeded the domestic use of collateral. These 

figures confirm the trend observed in previous 

years of increasing integration of financial 

markets in the euro area and the growing 

willingness of counterparties to hold in their 

portfolios assets located in another euro area 

country. 
THE CORRESPONDENT CENTRAL BANKING MODELThe CCBM has remained the main channel for 

transferring collateral across borders in 

Eurosystem monetary policy and intraday credit 

operations. It accounted for 39.7% of the total 

collateral provided to the Eurosystem in 2006. 

Assets held in custody through the CCBM 
105ECB Annual Report
2006increased from •353 billion at the end of 2005 
to •414 billion at the end of 2006. 
Work on the review of the CCBM™s technical 
and operational setting, which took into account 

the implementation of the new Eurosystem 

collateral framework approved by the Governing 

Council in July 2005, was finalised in 2006. 

The CCBM framework has also been revised in 

order to allow for the integration of new euro 

area countries. In this context, the CCBM 

Agreement with Banka Slovenije was signed on 

21 December 2006. 
As there is no comprehensive market alternative 
to the CCBM service, which was originally 

designed as an interim arrangement in the 

absence of a market solution throughout the 

euro area, the Governing Council decided on 

3 August 2006 to continue its service beyond 

2007. The ECB is also analysing possible ways 

to harmonise the operational framework for 

collateral management in the Eurosystem. 
ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITIES 

SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS
National SSSs can be linked by means of 

contractual and operational arrangements to 

allow the cross-border transfer of eligible 

securities between systems. Once eligible 

securities have been transferred via such links 

to another SSS, they can be used through local 

procedures in the same way as any domestic 

collateral. 59 links are currently available to 

counterparties, of which only a limited number 

are actively used. Furthermore, these links only 

cover part of the euro area. Links become 

eligible for Eurosystem credit operations if 

they fulfil the Eurosystem™s nine user 

standards.15 The Eurosystem assesses any new 
links or updates of eligible links against these 

standards. In 2006 three existing eligible links 

were updated and positively assessed. In 

addition, the potential use of some relayed 

links, i.e. where more than two CSDs are 

involved, is under assessment. 
Collateral held through links increased from 
•91 billion in December 2005 to •99 billion in 
December 2006, but represented only 10.5% of 

the total collateral (cross-border and domestic) 

held by the Eurosystem in 2006.15 ﬁStandards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in

COINS AND THE HANDLING OF CURRENCY
DEMAND FOR EURO BANKNOTES AND COINS
At the end of 2006 the number of euro banknotes 
in circulation stood at 11.3 billion, with a value 

of •628.2 billion, which represented an increase 

of 9.5% in terms of volume and 11.2% in terms 

of value compared with the levels at the end of 

2005 (10.4 billion banknotes with a value of 

•565.2 billion). The value of banknotes in 

circulation has continued to rise since the euro 

cash changeover in 2002, albeit at a diminishing 

annual growth rate (see Charts 44 and 45). It is 

estimated that, in value terms, between 10% and 

20% of the euro banknotes in circulation are 

held by non-euro area residents, who continue 

to generate demand for euro banknotes, mainly 

as a store of value or as a parallel currency. 
The dynamic growth of the number of •50, 
•100 and •500 banknotes in circulation 

continued in 2006, with rates of 12.5%, 9.6% 

and 13.2% respectively. The number of the 

other denominations in circulation rose at rates 

of between 2.7% and 8.2% (see Chart 46). 
In 2006 the total number of euro coins in 
circulation (i.e. the net circulation excluding 

stocks held by NCBs) grew by 10.4% to 69.5 

billion, while the value of coins in circulation 

rose by 7.4% to  •17.9 billion. The comparatively 

strong increase in the number of coins was 
mainly due to the continuing strong demand for 

low-value coins resulting from relatively high 

loss rates and hoarding. 
BANKNOTE HANDLING BY THE EUROSYSTEM
Euro banknote issues and withdrawals continued 

to follow the slight upward trend observed in 

previous years. In 2006 the euro area NCBs 

issued 32.5 billion banknotes, while 31.5 billion 

banknotes were returned to them. The return 

frequency16 of banknotes in circulation fell 
slightly from 3.17 in 2005 to 3.03 in 2006. All 

euro banknotes returned from circulation to the 

euro area NCBs are authenticated and checked 

for circulation fitness using fully automated 

banknote-processing machines in order to 

maintain the quality of the banknotes in 

circulation. In this process, some 5.2 billion 

banknotes (an increase of 26.2% compared with 

the previous year) considered to be unfit for 

circulation were replaced by the NCBs.

2006occurred in 2006. Chart 47 shows the trend in 
counterfeits removed from circulation, with 

figures taken at half-yearly intervals since the 

euro banknotes were launched. The total number 

of counterfeits received by National Analysis 

Centres17 in 2006 was around 565,00018. A 
significant development in 2006 was the change 

in the denominational split of counterfeits 

detected. Before 2006 the •50 banknote was the 

counterfeiters™ biggest target. However, the 

proportion of counterfeit •50 banknotes 

detected has fallen sharply, with a corresponding 

rise in both the number of counterfeit •20 

banknotes and, to a much lesser extent, the 

number of counterfeit •100 banknotes (see 

Table 13). As a result, the total face value of 

counterfeits removed from circulation, and 

therefore the potential financial damage caused 

by counterfeiting, diminished in 2006. 
The public can be confident in the security of 
the euro: it is a well-protected currency, in 
terms of both the sophistication of its security 

features and the effectiveness of European and 

national law enforcement authorities. However, 

this confidence should never give rise to 

complacency, and the ECB™s advice to the 

public is to be alert and to remember the ﬁfeel-
look-tiltﬂ test.19 COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCEThe Eurosystem continued in 2006 to work 

closely with Europol and the European 

Commission (in particular the European Anti-

Fraud Office, OLAF) in the fight against 

counterfeiting of the euro. The Eurosystem is 

active, both in the EU and beyond, in training 

professional cash handlers in the recognition 

and handling of counterfeit banknotes. 
The International Counterfeit Deterrence Centre 
continues to support the Central Bank 

Counterfeit Deterrence Group (a group of 27 

central banks cooperating under the auspices of 

the G10) and acts as the technical centre for all 

members. Its main role is to provide technical 

support and to operate a centralised 

communication system serving all parties 
17 Centres established in each EU Member State for the initial 
analysis of counterfeit euro banknotes at the national level.18 This figure is subject to a very slight correction on account of

3.3 BANKNOTE ISSUANCE AND PRODUCTION
FRAMEWORK FOR THE DETECTION OF 
COUNTERFEITS AND FITNESS SORTING  
The Banknote Recycling Framework (BRF) 

covers the detection of counterfeits and fitness 

sorting by credit institutions and other 

professional cash handlers. It establishes a 

common policy for the recirculation of euro 

banknotes within the credit sector and defines 

uniform rules and minimum standards for 

banknote processing which are to be followed 

by credit institutions and other professional 

cash handlers. Following a decision taken by 

the Governing Council in December 2004, all  

except two of the euro area NCBs have 

now transposed the BRF into national 

arrangements. 
Credit institutions and other professional cash 
handlers will have a transitional period until the 

end of 2007 to adapt their banknote handling 

machines to the new requirements. In view of 

the significant differences in national cash-

handling infrastructures, the Governing Council 

decided in December 2006 to extend the one-
year transitional period in some euro area 

countries. The transitional period will be 
extended by two years for France, where it will 

expire at the end of 2009, and by three years for 

Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal, 

where it will finish at the end of 2010. 
A central element of the BRF is the requirement 
to check banknotes to be dispensed by automated 

teller machines for authenticity and circulation 

fitness using staff-operated machines which 

comply with Eurosystem standards. Customer-

operated cash deposit and cash recycling 

machines must also comply with certain 

technical standards regarding the verification 

and subsequent handling of banknotes. Most of 

the euro area NCBs have provided machine 

manufacturers with tests for their equipment. In 

addition, the ECB has established a webpage 

listing all machines which have passed the 

Eurosystem™s common test procedure and are 

thus suitable for recycling purposes. 
In July 2006 the Governing Council decided 
on a transitional regime for the future 

implementation of the BRF in new euro area 

countries. It requires the NCBs of those Member 

States adopting the euro before 2010 to 

implement the BRF at the latest within 12 

months of joining the euro area. There will then 

be a one-year transitional period for credit 

institutions and other professional cash 

handlers. The NCBs of Member States entering 

the euro area from 2010 will have to implement 

the BRF before joining, but credit institutions 

and other professional cash handlers will still 

have a one-year transitional period to adapt 

their equipment. 
By adapting their operations in accordance with 
the BRF, credit institutions and other 

professional cash handlers will strengthen their 

ability to detect potential counterfeit euro 

banknotes. This will effectively contribute to 

their compliance with the legal obligation to 

remove potential counterfeits from circulation 

immediately and to make them available to law 

enforcement authorities for further investigation. 

Furthermore, it will ensure that credit 

institutions supply customers with banknotes 

that are in good physical condition, thus helping

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EXTENDED 

CUSTODIAL INVENTORY PILOT PROGRAMME
The Governing Council decided in 2006 to 

launch an Extended Custodial Inventory (ECI) 

pilot programme in Asia. An ECI is a cash depot 

maintained by a private bank (ECI bank) that 

holds currency on a custodial basis. The 

Eurosystem expects the ECI programme to 

facilitate the international distribution of euro 

banknotes and to improve the monitoring of 

their circulation outside the euro area. Since 

between 10% and 20% of the total value of euro 

banknotes in circulation is estimated to be held 

outside the euro area, the Eurosystem deems it 

useful to obtain better information on these 

banknotes. Following an open tender procedure, 

two large commercial banks active in the 

wholesale banknote market have been selected 

to operate one ECI each; one ECI will be 

established in Hong Kong and the other one in 

Singapore. The Deutsche Bundesbank will be 

the logistical and administrative counterpart for 

the ECI banks. Both ECIs will become 

operational in the first half of 2007. The ECI 

pilot programme will be used to assess the 

functioning of ECIs, their contribution to the 

information on euro banknotes in circulation 

outside the euro area, and their impact on the 

wholesale banknote market. On the basis of this 

pilot programme, the Governing Council will 

decide in 2008 whether to continue with the 

ECI programme. 
DIALOGUE WITH THE EUROPEAN PAYMENTS 

COUNCIL AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE 

CASH CYCLE
Information about the user requirements of 

different stakeholders Œ the banking industry 

being the main counterpart of the NCBs Œ is 

important for the smooth functioning of the 

euro cash cycle and the delivery of appropriate 

cash services by the Eurosystem. Topical cash 

issues, such as overall cost reductions, are 

discussed with European stakeholders in various 

fora, such as the Euro Cash User Group and the 
European Payments Council™s Cash Working 

Group. 
The organisation of the cash supply chain 
differs from one country to another, in view of 

the different national environments (e.g. the 

structure of the central bank and commercial 

banking systems, the legal regime, the payment 

behaviour of the general public, the cash-
in-transit infrastructure and geographical 

considerations). As a consequence, a ﬁone-size-

fits-allﬂ model for cash supply in the euro area 

is not desirable. However, the Governing 

Council decided in September 2006 that a 

timetable and roadmap should be established 

with the aim of achieving greater convergence 

in NCB cash services in the medium term. 
PRODUCTION ARRANGEMENTS 
A total of 7.0 billion euro banknotes were 

produced in 2006, compared with 3.63 billion 

in 2005. The lower production volume in 2005 

was caused to a considerable extent by the use 

of the banknote surpluses accumulated since 

2002, as the uncertainties surrounding the 

introduction of the euro warranted high 

production volumes for the initial supply. 
The rise in production growth in 2006 reflected 
the following factors: i) an increase in 

circulation, ii) a rise in the number of unfit 

banknotes, iii) the depletion of the NCBs™ stock 

levels and iv) the decision to produce in 2006 a 

part of the future banknote requirements. 
The allocation of euro banknote production 
continued to be based on the decentralised 

production scenario with pooling adopted in 

2002. Under this arrangement, each euro area 

NCB is responsible for the procurement of an 

allocated share of the total requirement for 

certain denominations (see Table 14).
110ECB Annual Report
2006THE SECOND SERIES OF EURO BANKNOTES
Following a preparatory phase in which the 
requirements for the new series of banknotes 

were established and an inventory was made of 

possible technical improvements, the Governing 

Council in 2006 approved the overall project 

plan for the development of the new series and 

the start of the industrial validation phase. This 

phase involves testing different security features 

to assess their performance and to identify 

potential problems in a large-scale production 

environment. The majority of the industrial 

validation activities are carried out by paper 

mills and printing works accredited by the ECB 

for the production of the current series. On the 

basis of the results of the industrial validation 

phase, the general specifications for the new 

series of banknotes will be defined and work on 

the design will start. 
The design of the new banknotes will be based 
on the ﬁages and stylesﬂ theme of the first 

series, and a number of design elements from 

that series will be used in the new design. A 

designer has been chosen to redesign the present 

series. 
The first banknote in the new series is expected 
to be issued in a few years™ time. The exact 

timing and sequence of issuance will, however, 

depend on the progress made in the development 

of new security features and on the counterfeiting 

situation. The different denominations of the 

new series will be launched over a period of 

several years.Table 14

2006The ECB, assisted by the NCBs, develops, 
collects, compiles and disseminates a wide 

range of statistics which support the monetary 

policy of the euro area and various tasks of the 

ESCB, as well as being used by the financial 

markets and the general public. As in previous 

years, in 2006 the provision of statistics Œ 

including those related to the preparations for 

the enlargement of the euro area and the EU in 

2007 Œ proceeded smoothly. An important 

milestone in the ECB™s medium-term strategy 

for statistics was reached at the end of May, 

with the first joint ECB/Eurostat publication of 

a set of annual integrated non-financial and 

financial accounts for the institutional sectors 

of the euro area. The dissemination of euro area 

statistics was also substantially improved, 

following the launch of the ECB™s new online 

data delivery service for statistics, the Statistical 

Data Warehouse. In addition, the ECB, in close 

collaboration with the ESCB Statistics 

Committee, continued to contribute to the 

further harmonisation of statistical concepts in 

Europe and to the review of core global 

statistical standards. 
4.1 NEW OR ENHANCED EURO AREA STATISTICS
At the end of May 2006 the ECB and Eurostat 

jointly published, for the first time, a set of 

annual integrated euro area non-financial and 

financial sector accounts for the years 1999-
2004. These euro area accounts can be 

considered as ﬁnational accountsﬂ for the euro 

area. Among other things, they allow 

comprehensive analysis of the links between 

financial and non-financial developments in the 

economy and of the interrelations among the 

different sectors of the economy (households, 

non-financial corporations, financial 

corporations and government) and between 

these sectors and the rest of the world. These 

annual accounts have paved the way for the 

publication of a full system of quarterly 

integrated euro area sector accounts by mid-
2007. The Eurosystem is preparing these 

statistics together with Eurostat and the national 

statistical institutes (NSIs). 
In September 2006 the first monthly statistics 

on outstanding amounts of Short-Term European 

Paper (STEP) were released on the ECB™s 

website. In the course of 2007, these should be 

supplemented by daily statistics on volumes 

and yields (see Section 3 of Chapter 4). 
The legal framework for the collection of 
monetary statistics was enhanced with a new 

Regulation addressed to post office giro 

institutions that receive deposits and are part of 

the non-financial corporations sector. The 

Governing Council also made refining 

amendments to the ECB Guidelines on quarterly 

financial accounts and on government finance 

statistics. Following its established practice of 

supplementing ECB legal acts with practical 

compilation guides, the ECB also published a 

ﬁGovernment Finance Statistics Guideﬂ. 
Work is under way in several areas to further 
improve the euro area statistics in the coming 

years. In particular, the Eurosystem continued 

in 2006 to develop a framework for the 

collection of harmonised statistics on non-MFIs 

which are important players in financial 

markets, such as investment funds and financial 

vehicle corporations. Substantial progress has 

been made in this respect, and an ECB regulation 

on the statistical reporting requirements for 

investment funds is now under preparation. In 

addition, the Eurosystem is exploring the need 

for and the feasibility of enhancing statistical 

data on insurance corporations and pension 

funds. The regulatory framework for MFI 

balance sheet statistics and MFI interest rate 

statistics is also under review, with the aim of 

accommodating new user demands as well as 

financial and economic developments. Euro 

area balance of payments and international 

investment position statistics have been 

integrated into one framework, whereby 

developments in end-period positions are 

described not only by transactions, but also by 

valuation changes resulting from price and 

exchange rate changes and other adjustments. 
When compiling the euro area statistics required 
by internal and external users, the ESCB pays 
4 STATISTICS
112ECB Annual Report
2006utmost attention to keeping the reporting burden 
to a minimum. In this context, the ESCB 

continued to work in 2006 on the development 

of a Centralised Securities Database (CSDB), 

the effects of which should become visible in 

the coming years. The CSDB, an ESCB-wide 

statistical project with stakeholders at both the 

ECB and the NCBs, is a single database with 

benchmark information on all individual euro 

area securities that are relevant for the statistical 

purposes of the ESCB. It is intended to be used 

as a tool to compile and enhance the quality of 

a wide range of ESCB financial statistics. 
In January 2007 the ECB published for the first 
time harmonised competitiveness indicators for 

the euro area countries, based on consumer 

price indices. These indicators were constructed 

using the same methodology and data sources 

as for the real effective exchange rate of the 

euro. 
Finally, estimates of the euro area capital stock 
and euro area households™ housing wealth have 

been included in the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin. 
4.2 OTHER STATISTICAL DEVELOPMENTS
In September 2006 the ECB launched on its 

website a more user-friendly and comprehensive 

online data delivery service for ESCB statistics, 

the Statistical Data Warehouse.
20 It features 
easy-to-use interfaces that allow users to 

quickly find, display and download euro area 

data, including national breakdowns in some 

cases. Moreover, additional tables of euro area 

statistics, together with the corresponding 

national data, are now available on the websites 

of both the ECB and the NCBs. One such 

example are the tables of harmonised MFI 

interest rates on deposits from, and loans to, 

households and non-financial corporations. 
Since November 2006 users of euro area 
statistics have also had access to a comprehensive 

description of data and metadata on the IMF™s 

Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.21 The 
descriptions of euro area statistics were prepared 
by the ECB and Eurostat, with the assistance of 

the IMF. The euro area page of the Dissemination 

Standards Bulletin Board also provides access 

to an advance release calendar and to euro area 

statistics for various data categories. 
As in previous years, the ECB released a number 
of publications on statistics, such as ﬁECB 

statistics: an overviewﬂ; the proceedings of the 

third ECB conference on statistics (ﬁFinancial 

statistics for a global economyﬂ, 4-5 May 

2006); and ﬁDifferences in MFI interest rates 

across euro area countriesﬂ. An ECB Occasional 

Paper entitled ﬁRevision analysis for general 

economic statisticsﬂ provided a detailed 

assessment of the reliability of key euro area 

macroeconomic statistics. 
Other ECB publications have been enhanced 
with more comprehensive statistical information, 

such as the statistical addendum to ﬁPayment 

and securities settlement systems in the 

European Union and in the acceding countriesﬂ 

(known as the Blue Book). Following a 

comprehensive review of the data collected, 

enhancements were made to the definition and 

collection of data on payments and securities, 

which also led to an improvement in the 

timeliness of the publication of several months. 

The range of financial integration indicators 

included in the semi-annual ECB report entitled 

ﬁIndicators of financial integration in the euro 

areaﬂ has also been extended (see Section 3 of 

Chapter 4). 
In February 2007 the ECB published its third 
annual quality report on the euro area balance 

of payments and international investment 

position statistics. The report includes 

qualitative assessments and quantitative 

indicators which may help users in the analysis 

of these statistics.22 The ECB continued to cooperate closely with 

Eurostat and other international organisations

2006and was actively involved in the ongoing update 
of global statistical standards (the System of 

National Accounts (SNA 93) and the IMF 

Balance of Payments Manual), as well as the 

reviews of the OECD Benchmark Definition of 

Foreign Direct Investment and the ISIC 

nomenclature23. It also supports and implements 
a number of global technical standards for data 

exchange24. 4.3 PREPARING FOR EURO AREA ENLARGEMENT 
Statistics also play an important role in 

monitoring the convergence of EU Member 

States that do not yet belong to the euro area 

and, hence, in the preparation of the convergence 

reports (see Section 1.2 of Chapter 5). 
The statistical data needed to assess the progress 
made by Member States in fulfilling the 

convergence criteria on price stability, fiscal 

positions, exchange rates and long-term interest 

rates are provided by Eurostat. The ECB, 

together with the NCBs of the Member States 

concerned, assists Eurostat with the provision 

of long-term interest rate statistics and collects 

and compiles additional statistical data which 

supplement the four primary convergence 

indicators. 
Since the assessment of the convergence process 
is highly dependent on the quality and integrity 

of the underlying statistics, the ECB closely 

monitors developments in the compilation and 

reporting of these statistics, particularly 

government finance statistics. The ECB 

welcomes the initiatives of the European 

Commission regarding the implementation of a 

Code of Practice for Eurostat and the NSIs. 

Adherence to this code is expected to reinforce 

the independence, integrity and accountability 

of these institutions, which are crucial for the 

production of high quality and reliable statistics 

in the EU.23 International standard industrial classification of all economic 
activities.24 For example, the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange 
(SDMX), an initiative supported by the BIS, the ECB, Eurostat, 
the IMF, the OECD, the United Nations and the World Bank in 

order to foster global standards for the exchange of statistical 

information.114ECB Annual Report
2006The objective of economic research at the ECB, 
as well as in the Eurosystem as a whole, is to 

provide a strong conceptual and empirical basis 

for policy-making. Economic research in the 

Eurosystem thus focuses on increasing 

knowledge of the functioning of the euro area 

economy and providing analyses, models and 

other tools relevant to the conduct of the euro 

area™s monetary policy and the fulfilment of 

other tasks of the Eurosystem. 
5.1 RESEARCH PRIORITIES
At the ECB economic research is mainly 

conducted by the Directorate General Research, 

but also by other business areas, in particular 

the Directorate General Economics. A Research 

Coordination Committee (RCC) coordinates 

the research, setting priorities and bringing 

together the business areas which are involved 

in economic research either on the demand or 

on the supply side. Following a new mandate 

agreed upon in 2006, the RCC adopts an annual 

forward-looking research Priorities Report and 

a backward-looking Annual Review of ECB-

wide research activities, both of which are 

approved by the Executive Board. The Priorities 

Report highlights the current knowledge gap 

for each priority area, defines deliverables and 

lays down the division of labour between 

different business areas. The Annual Review 

monitors research outcomes in terms of both 

academic quality and policy relevance, 

measuring the results against the deliverables 

defined in the previous Priorities Report. 
The 2006 research agenda consisted of the 
following six main areas: forecasting and model 

development; monetary policy analysis; the 

transmission mechanism of monetary policy; 

financial stability; the efficiency of the 

European financial system; and international 

issues. A selection of these priority areas are 

briefly discussed below. 
With respect to forecasting and model 
development, two noteworthy lines of research 

were pursued in 2006. First, the new area-wide 
model, a state-of-the-art dynamic stochastic 

general equilibrium model for the euro area, 

was further developed and will soon face its 

first tests with regard to forecast performance. 

Second, dynamic factor models were 

successfully implemented to produce short-
term (current and next quarter) forecasts for 

GDP. A quasi-real-time evaluation of their 

forecast performance demonstrated that these 

models perform very well by comparison with 

more traditional approaches. 
Given the prominent role of monetary analysis 
in the ECB™s monetary policy strategy, the 

development of models and tools used to extract 

information content from monetary aggregates 

was thoroughly analysed. The results of this 

and other related research were discussed in 

November 2006 at the Fourth ECB Central 

Banking Conference, which was devoted to 

ﬁThe role of money: money and monetary 

policy in the twenty-first centuryﬂ. A publication 

containing the papers presented and a summary 

of the conference discussions will be released 

in summer 2007. 
Following a request by the heads of research of 
the Eurosystem central banks, the Governing 

Council in February 2006 approved the creation 

of a research network on wage dynamics. 

Researchers from 20 EU NCBs and the ECB 

participate in this network, which has a horizon 

of two years. The network™s work is organised 

along four lines of research. The first line 

explores the empirical characterisation of 

aggregate, country and sectoral dynamics in 

wage and other (non-wage) labour costs in the 

euro area, as well as the structural analysis of 

their determinants and their interaction with 

inflation dynamics. The second line of research 

involves the use of micro-data on wages and 

aims to determine the nature and magnitude of 

possible wage and other labour market rigidities 

across countries and sectors in the euro area, as 

well as the link between wage and price-setting 

at the company level. The third line of research 

explores the launch of an ad hoc survey on 

wages, other labour costs and price-setting 

behaviour at the company level. The fourth area 
5 ECONOMIC RESEARCH
115ECB Annual Report
2006of study focuses on an overarching analysis 
which combines the results of the network™s 

other areas of work, with the intention of 

drawing policy implications for the euro area. 

The results of all lines of research are expected 

to be communicated to the decision-making 

bodies of the ECB by mid-2008. 
At the request of the Finnish EU Presidency, 
the ECB contributed a paper to a discussion at 

the informal ECOFIN meeting in Helsinki on 

28-29 September 2006. The paper, entitled 

ﬁThe role of financial markets and innovation 

for productivity and growth in Europeﬂ, 

recognised the significant progress made with 

European financial integration and its beneficial 

effects for productivity and economic growth. 

It also suggested, however, that policies 

pursuing financial integration could usefully be 

complemented by policies fostering the 

modernisation of the financial system, i.e. by 

improving the general framework conditions 

for financial markets. Such modernisation 

would involve promoting financial innovations 

as well as institutional and organisational 

improvements to enhance the efficiency of the 

financial system, for instance by reallocating 

capital to industries with the best growth 

prospects. The paper found that the framework 

conditions in Europe could be improved, for 

example with respect to specific aspects of 

corporate governance, the efficiency of some 

legal systems in resolving financial conflicts, 

and structural features of some European 

banking sectors, including concentration 

tendencies in local retail markets and the extent 

of public bank ownership. The ECB™s paper 

also lent support to follow-up work on venture 

capital financing and trends towards 

securitisation. 
As part of the second stage of the Research 
Network on Capital Markets and Financial 

Integration in Europe run by the ECB and the 

Center for Financial Studies (CFS), two 

conferences were held in 2006. The seventh 

conference on financial system modernisation 

and economic growth in Europe, hosted by the 

Deutsche Bundesbank, took place in Berlin in 
September. One of the findings of the conference 

was that economies with larger capital markets 

were more reactive and adapted more quickly 

to technological innovations. This effect related 

to the size of capital markets continued to be 

relevant even after the share of public bank 

ownership and the efficiency of the legal system 

were taken into account. Furthermore, 

inadequate securities laws affected the 

development and liquidity of stock markets. 

The network™s eighth conference dealt with 

financial integration and stability in Europe and 

was hosted by the Banco de España in Madrid 

in late November. A noteworthy conclusion of 

this conference was that the correlation between 

individual banks™ risks in Europe appeared to 

have increased recently, in particular with 

regard to large banks. In addition, for industrial 

countries, some evidence was found that cross-
border bank mergers, as opposed to domestic 

mergers, may increase the acquiring banks™ 

level of risk. At the same time, however, 

available estimates suggested that greater bank 

competition may actually increase financial 

stability. 
In February 2006 the Governing Council, 
following a proposal from the heads of research 

of the Eurosystem central banks, authorised the 

creation of a task force to explore the need for 

and feasibility of collecting survey data on 

household finance and consumption. In 

December the task force submitted a report to 

the Governing Council explaining the usefulness 

of such survey data for analysis and policy 

formulation for major Eurosystem policy 

functions, notably monetary policy, financial 

stability and payment systems. The survey 

would provide new insights, inter alia, into the 

vulnerability of the household sector to asset 

prices; the propensity to consume out of wealth; 

the effects of financial integration and 

innovation; and the impact of ageing and 

pension reforms on household savings and 
116ECB Annual Report
2006consumption patterns. Surveys on household 
finance and consumption are already conducted 

in some euro area countries, but comparable 

data for the whole euro area do not exist at 

present. The Governing Council decided to 

establish a network that would prepare a fully-
fledged proposal concerning the survey, 

including a complete specification of the 

questionnaire to be used as well as the modalities 

for its implementation. This proposal will form 

the basis of a final cost-benefit analysis which 

will allow the Governing Council to determine 

whether the survey will be conducted. 
5.2 PUBLICATIONS AND CONFERENCES
Most of the results of the research activities 

carried out at the ECB, or in cooperation with 

ECB staff, are presented in the ECB™s Working 

Paper series and Œ to a lesser extent Œ the ECB™s 

Occasional Paper series, as well as at various 

conferences and workshops. 137 ECB Working 

Papers were published in 2006. Of these, 87 

were written with the involvement of ECB staff, 

while 50 were written by non-ECB staff in the 

context of research visitor programmes, 

Eurosystem research networks or conferences 

organised by the ECB. Hard copies of each 

Working Paper are produced and distributed 

mainly to libraries and institutions, but the 

main channel of dissemination for the series is 

the ECB™s website, with nearly 280,000 

downloads of Working Papers per month in 

2006. 
In addition to such measures of the demand for 
Working Papers, the quality of the series can 

also be assessed in other ways. Working Papers 

are intended to stimulate discussion on research 

output prior to final publication in journals or 

books. The final publication outlet of a paper is, 

however, an important indicator of its academic 

quality. Of the Working Papers that were 

released in the period 1999-2002, about 50% 

were published in an academic, refereed journal 

and 13% in edited volumes. The impact of the 

Working Paper series can also be gauged from 

the number of references to these papers in 
other work. According to statistics based on the 

Research Papers in Economics database, each 

ECB Working Paper is cited on average 3.4 

times in academic publications. 
Since November 2004 the ECB™s Directorate 
General Research has produced a Research 

Bulletin which has been made publicly available 

since the fifth issue in December 2006. The 

purpose of this 12-page Bulletin is to inform a 

wide audience of experts and non-specialists 

about research carried out by ECB staff, or in 

cooperation with ECB staff, addressing topics 

of relevance to central banks. While the Working 

Paper series mainly addresses specialists, the 

articles in the Research Bulletin, which reflect 

the views of individual authors, aim to 

communicate the results of state-of-the-art 

research in a concise and accessible form. 
In addition to the publications and events 
mentioned above, the ECB interacted with the 

academic community throughout the year by 

hosting a number of research conferences and 

workshops, such as a colloquium held in March 

in honour of the then member of the Executive 

Board Otmar Issing on ﬁMonetary policy: a 

journey from theory to practiceﬂ; a conference 

on ﬁIssues related to central counterparty 

clearingﬂ in April; a workshop on ﬁCorporate

117ECB Annual Report
20066.1 COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITIONS 
OF MONETARY FINANCING AND PRIVILEGED 
ACCESS 
Pursuant to Article 237(d) of the Treaty, the 

ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring 

the compliance of all EU NCBs and the ECB 

with the prohibitions implied by Articles 101 

and 102 of the Treaty and Council Regulations 

(EC) Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93. Article 101 

prohibits the ECB and the NCBs from providing 

overdraft facilities or any other type of credit 

facility to governments and Community 

institutions or bodies, as well as from purchasing 

debt instruments directly from them. Article 

102 prohibits any measure, not based on 

prudential considerations, which establishes 

privileged access by governments and 

Community institutions or bodies to financial 

institutions. In parallel with the Governing 

Council, the European Commission monitors 

Member States™ compliance with the above 

provisions. 
The ECB also monitors the EU central banks™ 
secondary market purchases of debt instruments 

issued by both the domestic public sector and 

the public sector of other Member States. 

According to the recitals of Council Regulation 

(EC) No 3603/93, the acquisition of public 

sector debt instruments in the secondary market 

must not be used to circumvent the objective of 

Article 101 of the Treaty. Such purchases should 

not become a form of indirect monetary 

financing of the public sector.
In 2006 the Governing Council identified two 
cases of non-compliance with the above Treaty 

requirements and the associated Council 

regulations. The Banca d™Italia and the Deutsche 

Bundesbank reported primary market purchases 

of debt instruments issued by the European 

Investment Bank (EIB). On 10 January 2006 

the Banca d™Italia bought USD-denominated 

EIB bonds amounting to USD 50 million for 

the purpose of foreign exchange reserve 

management. As part of test operations 

conducted with the aim of gaining operational 

experience with debt instruments issued by 
supranational institutions, the Deutsche 

Bundesbank carried out three transactions in 

the primary market (on 9 January 2006 for USD 

50 million, on 20 April 2006 for USD 15 million 

and on 16 May 2006 for USD 10 million), 

acquiring USD-denominated EIB bonds 

amounting to a total of USD 75 million. Since 

the EIB is a Community body, such purchases 

constitute a breach of the monetary financing 

prohibition according to Article 101 of 

the Treaty and Council Regulation (EC) 

No 3603/93. In the case of the Banca d™Italia, 

the EIB debt instruments purchased in the 

primary market were sold on 8 March 2006. 

The Deutsche Bundesbank sold the EIB debt 

instruments purchased in the primary market on 

6 September 2006. Moreover, both NCBs took 

immediate measures to avoid the occurrence of 

such events in the future.6.2 ADVISORY FUNCTIONS
Article 105(4) of the Treaty requires that the 

ECB be consulted on any proposed Community 

or national legislation falling within its fields 

of competence.25 All ECB opinions are published 
on the ECB™s website. 
The ECB adopted 62 opinions in 2006: 10 in 
response to consultations by the EU Council 

and 52 in response to consultations by national 

authorities. This compares with 61 consultations 

in 2005. A list of the opinions adopted in 2006 

is annexed to this Annual Report. 
Following a decision by the ECB™s decision-
making bodies in 2005, the format and structure 

of ECB opinions on proposed Community 

legislation has been streamlined to make the 

opinions more user-friendly and enhance their 

effectiveness. 
6 OTHER TASKS AND ACTIVITIES
25 The United Kingdom is exempt from the consultation obligation, 
pursuant to the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, annexed 

to the Treaty (OJ C 191, 29.7.1992, p. 18).
118ECB Annual Report
2006The following five ECB opinions on proposed 
Community legislation are particularly 

noteworthy. 
Following the abrogation of Slovenia™s 
derogation in accordance with the procedure set 

out in Article 122(2) of the Treaty, the ECB was 

consulted on a proposal for a Council regulation 

amending Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the 

introduction of the euro and on a proposal for a 

Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) 

No 2866/98 on the conversion rates between 

the euro and the currencies of the Member 

States adopting the euro.26 In its opinion on a proposal for a directive of 

the European Parliament and of the Council on 

payment services in the internal market and 

amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2000/12/EC and 

2002/65/EC,27 the ECB welcomed this initiative 
to establish a comprehensive legal framework 

for payment services in the EU, facilitate 

implementation of the Single Euro Payments 

Area, and lead to harmonisation of access rules 

for the market for payment services. At the 

same time, the ECB noted certain points 

requiring further consideration, such as the 

receipt and holding by payment institutions of 

funds having similar economic and legal 

characteristics to deposits or e-money, certain 

shortcomings in the envisaged regulatory and 

supervisory regime, the need for better 

protection of payment services users™ funds, the 

absence of capital requirements and certain 

ambiguities in the list of permitted activities. 
The ECB was also consulted and provided 
an opinion28 on a proposal for a directive of 
the European Parliament and of the Council 

amending Council Directive 92/49/EEC29 and Directives 2002/83/EC30, 2004/39/EC31, 2005/68/EC32 and 2006/48/EC33 as regards 
procedural rules and evaluation criteria for the 

prudential assessment of acquisitions and 

increase of shareholdings in the financial 

sector34 (see Section 2.2 of Chapter 4). 
The ECB issued an own-initiative opinion35 on 
a draft Commission directive implementing 
Council Directive 85/611/EEC on the 

coordination of laws, regulations and 

administrative provisions relating to 

undertakings for collective investment in 

transferable securities (UCITS)36 as regards the 
clarification of certain definitions37. This was 
the first opinion issued by the ECB on draft 

implementing measures adopted under the 

comitology procedure. The ECB advised on the 

provisions on the eligibility of money market 

instruments for UCITS investment purposes, 

suggesting in particular that the same disclosure 

and information requirements be applied to 

regulated financial institutions and to corporate 

issuers of money market instruments in order 
26 CON/2006/36. The ECB was also consulted by the Slovenian, 
Estonian, Cypriot and Maltese authorities on national legislation 
facilitating the future introduction of the euro in those Member 

States (see CON/2006/4, CON/2006/10, CON/2006/17,

Finally, on 15 February 2007 the ECB adopted 
an opinion38 on proposals to amend eight 
directives in the financial sector in order to 

introduce a new ﬁregulatory procedure with 

scrutinyﬂ into the comitology procedures of 

these directives and repeal the provisions that 

provide for a time limit on the delegation of 

implementing powers to the Commission. In its 

opinion, the ECB underlined the fact that 

Lamfalussy Level 2 implementing acts 

constitute ﬁproposed Community actsﬂ within 

the meaning of Article 105(4) of the Treaty on 

which the ECB should be consulted.39The ECB continued to be consulted by national 

authorities on issues pertaining to the NCBs, in 

particular on amendments to the statutes of the 

Belgian, Czech, French, Italian, Cypriot, 

Latvian, Luxembourg, Hungarian, Maltese, 

Dutch, Polish and Slovenian NCBs,40 as well as 
on national legislation facilitating the future 

introduction of the euro41. The ECB was 
consulted by Latvia on a draft law amending 

the Latvian Constitution to confirm Latvijas 

Banka™s status in the Constitution. While 

welcoming the draft law, the ECB emphasised 

the importance of ensuring that the proposed 

amendments did not entail any changes to 

Latvijas Banka™s status and functions, but only 

restated its position in the hierarchy of different 

institutions at the constitutional level. The ECB 

was also consulted by Finland on a reform of 

the Law on emergency powers.
42 As in its 
previous opinion on matters relating to 

emergency powers
43, the ECB recommended 
amending the draft law so that the powers that 

fall within the ESCB™s exclusive competence 

may not be exercised by national authorities in 

the absence of one of the emergency situations 

provided for in Article 297 of the Treaty. 
In the area of monetary policy, the ECB was 
consulted on the minimum reserve regime by 

Estonia, Latvia and Slovenia.44 In its opinions, 
the ECB emphasised the benefits of gradually 
achieving consistency with the ECB™s minimum 

reserve system. In this context, the ECB noted 

that, following the introduction of the euro, 

credit unions in Latvia would be subject to the 

ECB™s reserve requirements. The ECB was also 

consulted by national authorities on issues 

pertaining to the introduction of a single list of 

collateral, in particular on amendments to the 

statutes of the Nationale Bank van België/
Banque Nationale de Belgique.45 Concerning financial supervision, the ECB 

issued its first own-initiative opinion on draft 

national legislation in relation to the failure of 

the Dutch Finance Minister to consult the ECB 

on the second part of a draft law introducing a 

functional supervision model.46 The ECB also 
issued an opinion on a Polish draft law 

establishing a new institutional framework for 

the supervision of banking, capital markets, 

insurance and pension funds in Poland.47 In line 
with past ECB opinions on banking and financial 

supervisory reforms, the opinion favoured the 

involvement of central banks in prudential 

supervision, positively assessed the existing 

supervisory model and stressed the need to 

maintain banking and financial expertise under 

the new supervisory framework. In a later 

opinion, the ECB recommended that Narodowy 

Bank Polski be expressly allocated the task of 

overseeing securities settlement and clearing 

systems, on the grounds that such oversight 

function is inherent in central banks™ task of 

promoting sound market infrastructure, in order 

to safeguard the effectiveness of monetary

LENDING OPERATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN 

COMMUNITYIn accordance with Article 123(2) of the Treaty 

and Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) 

No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002, the ECB 

continues to have responsibility for the 

administration of the borrowing and lending 

operations of the European Community under 

the Medium-Term Financial Assistance 

mechanism. In 2006 the ECB did not perform 

any administration tasks. There was no 

outstanding balance at the end of 2005 and no 

new operations were initiated during 2006. 
6.4 EUROSYSTEM RESERVE MANAGEMENT 
SERVICES
In 2006 a comprehensive set of services 

continued to be offered under the framework 

established in January 2005 for the management 

of Eurosystem customers™ euro-denominated 

reserve assets. The complete set of services Œ 

which is available to central banks, monetary 

authorities and government agencies located 

outside the euro area, as well as to international 

organisations Œ is offered under harmonised 

terms and conditions in line with general market 

standards by individual Eurosystem central 

banks (the Eurosystem service providers) acting 

as dedicated service providers. The ECB 

performs an overall coordination role, ensuring 

the smooth functioning of the framework. The 

number of customers maintaining a business 

relationship with the Eurosystem in 2006 

remained stable by comparison with 2005. With 

respect to the services themselves, there was a 

small increase in customers™ total cash balances 

and/or securities holdings.48 CON/2006/53.CHAPTER 3ENTRY OF SLOVENIA
INTO THE EURO AREA 
124ECB Annual Report
2006On 11 July 2006 the ECOFIN Council adopted 
a decision allowing Slovenia to join the euro 

area and to adopt the euro as its currency as 

from 1 January 2007. The Council™s decision 

was based on the convergence reports published 

by the ECB and the European Commission in 

May 2006, an opinion of the European 

Parliament and a proposal from the European 

Commission. On the same day, the ECOFIN 

Council adopted a regulation fixing the 

irrevocable conversion rate between the 

Slovenian tolar and the euro. The conversion 

rate was set at SIT 239.640 to the euro, the 

central rate agreed on 28 June 2004 when the 

tolar entered ERM II. The tolar had stayed close 

to its central rate against the euro during the 

whole period of its participation in ERM II and 

was trading at that rate on the day when the 

conversion rate was set. 
Looking back over the past ten years, Slovenia 
has made remarkable progress in achieving low 

inflation rates. Starting from a high of 8.3% in 

1997, consumer price inflation decreased 

gradually to stand at 6.1% in 1999. After a 

temporary interruption owing to, among other 

things, the introduction of a value added tax, a 

surge in domestic demand, strong wage 

increases and a jump in import prices, inflation 

started to fall again after 2000, reaching 2.5% 

in 2005. In 2006 average HICP inflation 

remained at 2.5%, despite the relatively high 

volatility stemming from oil prices. On balance, 

the non-energy industrial goods component has 

dampened recent inflationary developments, 

while the energy and services components have 

had the strongest upward impact. 
The decline in inflation should be seen against 
the backdrop of robust economic growth. Over 

the last decade real GDP growth has averaged 

4.1%, above the euro area average. While real 

GDP growth was somewhat subdued between 

2001 and 2003, it has picked up again since 

2004. In 2006 the rate of real GDP growth was 

5.2%, compared with 4.0% in 2005 (see 

Table 15). This has led to significant progress 

in real convergence, with Slovenia™s GDP per 

capita (in purchasing power parity terms) rising 
from 65% of the euro area average in 1997, 

which was the highest level among the central 

and eastern European countries which joined 

the EU in May 2004, to 78% in 2006. As regards 

external developments, Slovenia has on average 

reported a current and capital account deficit of 

1.6% of GDP over the past ten years. In 2006 

the current and capital account deficit increased 

to 3.4%, from 2.4% in 2005. 
Labour market conditions have remained fairly 
stable over the last decade, with the 

unemployment rate fluctuating around 6-7%. In 

line with the strengthening of economic activity 

during 2006, employment growth also increased, 

to 0.6% (from 0.3% in 2005). At the same time, 

the unemployment rate decreased to 6.0% (from 

6.5% in 2005). As a result of structural 

adjustments in the labour market during the 

past few years, employment has increased in 

the services sector, while it has declined in 

manufacturing. There is an increased mismatch 

in the labour market between the demand for 

high-skilled workers and the supply of low-
skilled workers. 
The convergence process was supported by 
fiscal policy. From 2000 (the first year for 

which comparable government deficit data are 

available) to 2005, the deficit-to-GDP ratio fell 

from 3.8% to 1.4%. In 2006 the general 

government deficit ratio of 1.6% was broadly in 

line with the deficit contained in the 2005 

update of the convergence programme, despite 

higher than expected growth and a more 

favourable deficit outcome in 2005. The 

government debt ratio is estimated to have 

increased slightly to 28.5% in 2006, from 28.0% 

in 2005. According to the updated stability 

programme, the total expenditure ratio 

continued to decline in 2006 by more than 0.5% 

of GDP. Pension expenditure, at 10.9% of GDP 

in 2005, is quite high compared with other EU 

countries and is expected to increase sizeably 

until 2050, with the long-term budgetary impact 

projected to be among the largest in the EU. 
Convergence was also fostered by monetary 
policy. In 2001 Slovenia adopted a new 
1 ECONOMIC AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS 
IN SLOVENIA
125ECB Annual Report
2006monetary policy framework, and the primary 
objective of price stability was enshrined in the 

new Banka Slovenije Law. The previous 

intermediate target for monetary growth was 

abandoned and a two-pillar monetary policy 

framework introduced, covering both monetary 

and real economic developments. At the same 

time, monetary policy was complemented by an 

exchange rate policy guided by uncovered 

interest rate parity considerations. This led to a 

gradual decline of the tolar vis-à-vis the euro, 

which enabled Banka Slovenije to maintain 

sufficiently high interest rates to support 

disinflation. After 28 June 2004, when Slovenia 

joined ERM II, monetary policy was aimed at 

maintaining exchange rate stability vis-à-vis 

the euro. 
During 2006 the monetary policy of Banka 
Slovenije continued to be geared towards the 

achievement of price stability within the 

framework of ERM II while maintaining 

exchange rate stability vis-à-vis the euro. At the 

same time, Banka Slovenije gradually reduced 

interest rates to ensure a smooth transitiontowards euro adoption. In January 2006 the 

60-day tolar bill interest rate stood at 4.0%. By 

July, when the ECOFIN Council confirmed that 

Slovenia had fulfilled the necessary conditions 

to adopt the single currency, Banka Slovenije 

had lowered the 60-day tolar bill interest rate to 

3.25%. In August Banka Slovenije increased its 

interest rates by 25 basis points, mirroring the 

rise in key ECB interest rates in that month. 

The 60-day tolar bill interest rate was left 

unchanged for the rest of the year. Following 

the increases in key ECB interest rates in 

October and December, the 60-day tolar bill 

interest rate was aligned by the end of the year 

with the minimum bid rate on the main 

refinancing operations of the Eurosystem. 
During 2006 the Slovenian three-month money 
market interest rate moved in line with the 

official central bank interest rates. The gradual 

convergence of short-term interest rates in 

Slovenia to the euro area level was essentially 

completed by October. Long-term interest rates, 

by contrast, had already been close to euro area 

levels since mid-2004. This reflected market

126ECB Annual Report
2006confidence in general economic and fiscal 
developments in Slovenia and the credibility of 

Slovenian monetary and exchange rate policy. 
Following its adoption of the euro, the main 
challenge for Slovenia is to ensure the conduct 

of appropriate national policies in order to 

sustain robust economic growth and secure a 

high degree of sustainable convergence. Given 

that Slovenia can no longer use independent 

monetary and exchange rate policies to achieve 

its economic objectives, the appropriate conduct 

of structural and fiscal policies has now become 

even more important. In this context, it is 

crucial to address the remaining structural 
rigidities in the labour market and to improve 

product market flexibility. It is desirable that 

wages lag behind labour productivity growth 

in order to safeguard the economy™s 

competitiveness, and the remaining indexation 

of wages and certain social transfers must be 

eliminated. Pursuing an ambitious fiscal 

consolidation path will play a central role in 

preventing the emergence of possible demand-

induced inflationary pressures in the coming 

years. Furthermore, in view of the ongoing 

deepening of financial markets in Slovenia, 

which is associated with fast credit growth, 

among other things, effective financial 

supervision will be required. 
Box 8
STATISTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE EURO AREA TO INCLUDE SLOVENIA 
The enlargement of the euro area to include Slovenia as of 1 January 2007 is the second 

occasion on which statistical series for the euro area have had to be amended in order to include 

an additional member country. The preparation of statistics for the enlarged euro area has been 

coordinated, where necessary, with the European Commission.
Slovenia™s entry means that residents of Slovenia have become residents of the euro area. This 
affects statistics for which euro area aggregates are not a simple sum of national data, such as 

monetary, balance of payments and international investment position statistics, as well as 

financial accounts, because transactions between Slovenian and other euro area residents must 

now be consolidated. 
From January 2007 Slovenia was thus obliged to meet all the statistical requirements of the 
ECB, i.e. to provide fully harmonised and comparable national data.1 Since the preparation of 
new statistics requires a long lead time, Banka Slovenije and the ECB started the statistical 

preparations well before Slovenia joined the EU. Banka Slovenije intensified its preparations 

to fulfil the requirements of the ECB after becoming a member of the ESCB and was therefore 

ready to meet the statistical obligations covering monetary, banking, balance of payments and 

other financial statistics on joining the euro area. In addition, Banka Slovenije had to carry out 

the necessary preparations for the integration of Slovenian credit institutions into the ECB™s 

minimum reserve system and to fulfil the relevant statistical requirements.For the data reporters and NCBs of the existing euro area countries, the enlargement of the euro 
area meant that from January 2007 they had to report transactions (or flows) and positions with 

residents of Slovenia as part of the euro area data, rather than as transactions and positions with 

non-euro area residents. 
1 The statistical requirements of the ECB are summarised in the document ﬁECB statistics: an overviewﬂ, April 2006.
127ECB Annual Report
2006In addition, Slovenia and the other euro area countries all had to provide backdata with sufficient 
geographical and sectoral detail, dating back at least as far as 2004, the year Slovenia joined 

the EU.Regarding the publication of euro area statistics, the ECB has granted users online access to 
two sets of time series, one containing data for the current euro area (i.e. including Slovenia) 

as far back as available, and one linking the various compositions of the euro area, starting with 

the 11 countries in 1999.
128ECB Annual Report
2006Pursuant to Article 122(2) of the Treaty, the 
ECB reviewed Banka Slovenije™s statutes and 

other relevant Slovenian legislation for 

compliance with Article 109 of the Treaty. The 

ECB made a favourable assessment of the 

compatibility of Slovenian legislation with the 

Treaty and with the Statute of the ESCB, as 

stated in its Convergence Report on Lithuania 

and Slovenia published in May 2006. 
The ECB and Banka Slovenije put in place a 
number of legal instruments with a view to 

ensuring the integration of Banka Slovenije 

into the Eurosystem on 1 January 2007. The 

Eurosystem™s legal framework was adapted as 

a consequence of the decision taken by the 

ECOFIN Council on 11 July 2006 to abrogate 

Slovenia™s derogation
1. The introduction of the 
euro in Slovenia and the integration of Banka 

Slovenije into the Eurosystem also required 

changes to some Slovenian legal instruments. 

On 30 March 2006 Banka Slovenije™s statutes 

were brought into line with recommendations 

in the ECB™s Convergence Report 2004. 

Slovenia had consulted the ECB on the draft 

amendments to Banka Slovenije™s statutes on 

13 March 2006. The ECB adopted an opinion 

proposing further changes, which were reflected 

in the final version of Banka Slovenije™s 

statutes.2 In the course of 2006, the ECB was 
also consulted on amendments to other 

Slovenian legislation, governing areas such as 

banking3, minimum reserve requirements4 and 
collateral5. The ECOFIN Council™s decision of 11 July 

2006 triggered amendments to Council 

Regulation (EC) No 974/98 to enable the 

introduction of the euro as Slovenia™s currency
6, and the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) 

No 1086/2006 amending Regulation (EC) 

No 2866/98, which determined the irrevocably 

fixed exchange rate of the Slovenian tolar 

vis-à-vis the euro7. The Council consulted the 
ECB on proposals for both these regulations, on 

which the ECB adopted an opinion8. To facilitate the introduction of the euro as 

Slovenia™s currency, the ECB adopted two 

guidelines. Guideline ECB/2006/10 ensured 

that tolar banknotes could be exchanged for 

euro banknotes and coins in all euro area 

countries.9 Guideline ECB/2006/9 enabled the 
supply of euro banknotes and coins prior to the 

cash changeover.
10 The ECB was also consulted 
on the preparations for national legislation on 

the euro cash changeover.
11 As regards legal preparations for integrating 

Banka Slovenije into the Eurosystem, the ECB 

adopted the necessary legal instruments to 

provide for the paying-up of the remaining 

capital and the transfer by Banka Slovenije of 

foreign reserves to the ECB. Pursuant to 

Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the 

Governing Council adopted a recommendation 

on Banka Slovenije™s external auditors for the 

annual accounts starting from the financial year 

2007.12 The ECB also reviewed its legal 
framework and introduced, where necessary, 

amendments resulting from Banka Slovenije™s

legal framework for monetary policy and 

TARGET. Slovenian counterparties were 

consequently able to participate in the

2006Following the ECOFIN Council™s decision of 
11 July 2006 on Slovenia™s adoption of the euro 

on 1 January 2007, the ECB conducted technical 

preparations with a view to fully integrating 

Banka Slovenije into the Eurosystem. In line 

with the provisions of the Treaty, Banka 

Slovenije joined the Eurosystem with exactly 

the same rights and obligations as the NCBs of 

the EU Member States that had already adopted 

the euro. 
The technical preparations for the integration 
of Banka Slovenije into the Eurosystem were 

conducted in close cooperation with Banka 

Slovenije and, where appropriate, in a 

multilateral manner with the 12 NCBs of the 

euro area. These preparations covered a wide 

range of areas, notably financial reporting and 

accounting, monetary policy operations, foreign 

reserve management and foreign exchange 

operations, payment systems, statistics and 

banknote production. In the field of operations, 

preparations involved extensive testing of the 

instruments and procedures for the 

implementation of monetary policy and foreign 

exchange operations. 
3.1 MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS
Slovenia™s adoption of the euro on 1 January 

2007 meant that credit institutions located in 

Slovenia became subject to the Eurosystem™s 

reserve requirements as from that date. 

However, as 1 January 2007 fell almost in the 

middle of the regular Eurosystem reserve 

maintenance period running from 13 December 

2006 to 16 January 2007, transitional provisions 

had to be made for the application of minimum 

reserves in Slovenia during this maintenance 

period. Transitional provisions were also 

needed for the calculation of the reserve base of 

the Slovenian counterparties. The list of the 27 

Slovenian credit institutions subject to the 

Eurosystem™s reserve requirements was 

published on the ECB™s website for the first 

time on 29 December 2006. 
The accession of Slovenia to the euro area 

increased the aggregate reserve requirements of 

euro area credit institutions by •0.3 billion. The 

autonomous liquidity factors in the balance 

sheet of Banka Slovenije contributed, on 

average, an overall liquidity provision of •3.5 

billion in the period from 1 to 16 January 2007. 

In order to obtain a full picture of the liquidity 

effects of the accession of Slovenia, account 

had to be taken of the fact that some of the 

monetary policy operations conducted by Banka 

Slovenije in 2006 would not mature until 2007. 

These included some fixed-term deposits 

collected from counterparties and debt 

certificates issued by Banka Slovenije. The 

average value of these instruments amounted to 

•2.3 billion in the period from 1 to 16 January 

2007. The net average liquidity surplus 

contributed by Slovenia to the euro area in this 

period, therefore, amounted to •0.9 billion. 
The ECB took account of the impact on euro 
area liquidity conditions by adjusting the 

allotment amounts in its main refinancing 

operations already at the beginning of 2007. 
On 1 January 2007 Banka Slovenije also 
adopted the single collateral framework of the 

Eurosystem and reported eligible Slovenian 

assets of •6.3 billion. These assets had been 

added to the list of eligible assets published on 

the ECB™s website on 29 December 2006, and 

became eligible for Eurosystem credit 

operations as of 1 January 2007. 
3.2 CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECB™S CAPITAL, 
RESERVES AND FOREIGN RESERVE ASSETS 
On joining the ESCB on 1 May 2004, Banka 

Slovenije paid up 7% of its share of the 

subscribed capital of the ECB as a contribution 

to the ECB™s operational costs. In accordance 

with Article 49 of the Statute of the ESCB, 

Banka Slovenije paid up the remaining part of 

its subscription on 1 January 2007. Banka 

Slovenije™s total subscribed share amounts to 

•18.4 million, equivalent to 0.3194% of the 
3 OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE INTEGRATION OF 
BANKA SLOVENIJE INTO THE EUROSYSTEM 
131ECB Annual Report
2006ECB™s subscribed capital of •5.761 billion as at 
1 January 2007. 
At the beginning of 2007, in accordance with 
Articles 30 and 49.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, 

Banka Slovenije transferred foreign reserve 

assets (of •191.6 million) to the ECB in 

proportion, based on its share in the ECB™s 

subscribed capital, to the foreign reserve assets 

already transferred to the ECB by the other euro 

area NCBs. Of the total contribution, 15% was 

made in gold and 85% in US dollar-denominated 

assets. Banka Slovenije and the Banque centrale 

du Luxembourg manage this US dollar-

denominated portfolio as agents of the ECB, 

thus forming the ECB™s first pooled foreign 

reserve portfolio. In connection with the transfer 

of foreign reserve assets to the ECB, Banka 

Slovenije was credited with a euro-denominated 

claim on the ECB.132ECB Annual Report
2006On 1 January 2007 euro banknotes and coins 
were put into circulation in Slovenia. After a 

dual circulation period of two weeks, they had 

fully replaced the Slovenian tolar banknotes 

and coins. 
In preparation for this event, the Governing 
Council on 14 July 2006 adopted a guideline on 

certain preparations for the euro cash changeover 

and on frontloading and sub-frontloading of 

euro banknotes and coins outside the euro 

area.16 This guideline, which largely mirrors the 
legal framework adopted for the cash changeover 

in 2002, formed the basis for Banka Slovenije™s 

national cash changeover framework. 
Banka Slovenije established the legal framework 
for parties involved in the frontloading and 

sub-frontloading of euro banknotes and coins in 

Slovenia. Procedures and methods were also 

put in place for the exchange of tolar banknotes 

and coins for euro banknotes and coins, and the 

conditions for transport, storage, security, the 

provision of collateral and statistical monitoring 

were set out. 
To prepare for the cash changeover, as well as 
to cover the estimated national demand for the 

whole of 2007, the Eurosystem provided Banka 

Slovenije with a total of 94.5 million euro 

banknotes, with a face value of •2,175 million, 

from its stocks. For geographical and logistical 

reasons, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank 

performed the physical delivery on behalf of 

the Eurosystem. Following a public tender, 

Slovenia™s euro coins were produced by Mint of 

Finland. A total of 296.3 million euro coins 

were minted, with a face value of •104 

million. 
Banka Slovenije began frontloading euro coins 
to credit institutions on 25 September 2006 and 

euro banknotes on 29 November 2006. 

Sub-frontloading, i.e. the delivery of euro 

banknotes and coins to professional third parties 

(such as retailers and the cash-operated machine 

industry) by credit institutions, took place in 

the course of December. In parallel, 150,000 

euro coin starter kits for retailers, each worth 
•201, and 450,000 euro coin kits for private 

households, each worth •12.52, were prepared 

in order to ensure the widespread distribution 

of coins before the launch. By the end of 2006 

Banka Slovenije had frontloaded to banks 100% 

of the euro banknotes and coins needed for the 

cash changeover, paving the way for a smooth 

and rapid changeover. 
Another factor contributing to the efficiency of 
the cash changeover was the quick conversion 

of automated teller machines (ATMs) and point-

of-sale (POS) terminals: all publicly accessible 

ATMs and all POS terminals were converted on 

the first day of the changeover. The conversion 

of vending machines was completed within 15 

days. 
Article 52 of the Statute of the ESCB requires 
the Governing Council to take the necessary 

measures to ensure that banknotes denominated 

in currencies which are irrevocably fixed to the 

euro be exchanged by the euro area NCBs at par 

value. In line with this requirement, and 

following the adoption on 24 July 2006 of 

Guideline ECB/2006/10 on the exchange of 

banknotes after the irrevocable fixing of 

exchange rates in connection with the 

introduction of the euro17, the euro area NCBs 
ensured that, for the first two months of 2007, 

banknotes denominated in tolar, up to a value 

of •1,000 for any one party/transaction on a 

given day, could be exchanged for euro at par 

value in at least one location in their respective 

countries. Banka Slovenije will redeem tolar 

banknotes for an unlimited period and tolar 

coins for ten years.THE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN ON THE 

INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO
In 2006 the ECB, in cooperation with Banka 

Slovenije, organised an information campaign 

in preparation for the introduction of the euro 

in Slovenia on 1 January 2007. The objective of

17 OJ L 215, 5.8.2006, p. 44.
133ECB Annual Report
2006the information campaign was to familiarise 
cash handlers and the general public with the 

visual appearance and security features of the 

euro banknotes and coins, as well as the cash 

changeover procedures. As part of the campaign, 

more than 700,000 information leaflets 

produced by the ECB on the euro banknotes 

and coins, together with a calculator provided 

by Banka Slovenije, were sent to Slovenian 

households. Posters and a credit card-sized 

leaflet depicting the security features of the 

euro banknotes were distributed, as were guides 

for people who regularly handle cash at work. 

Furthermore, the Slovenian business community 

was provided with first-hand information on 

the visual appearance and security features of 

the euro banknotes and coins to be used in its 

own information material. A two-day seminar 

for representatives of the Slovenian media 

was held at the ECB and provided in-depth 

information about the organisation, 

responsibilities and activities of the ECB and 

the Eurosystem. Subsequently, a ﬁ• Conference 

Slovenia 2007ﬂ was organised by Banka 

Slovenije in cooperation with the ECB in order 

to provide a forum to exchange experiences and 

foster dialogue on the economic impact of the 

euro introduction and on the cash changeover. 

The conference, which was held on 15 January 

2007, was attended by representatives from the 

business community, public authorities and the 

media.CHAPTER 4FINANCIAL STABILITY 
AND INTEGRATION 
136ECB Annual Report
2006The Eurosystem contributes to the smooth 
conduct of policies pursued by the competent 

national authorities relating to the prudential 

supervision of credit institutions and the 

stability of the financial system. It also offers 

advice to these authorities and the European 

Commission on the scope and implementation 

of Community legislation in these fields. 
1.1 FINANCIAL STABILITY MONITORING 
The ECB, in collaboration with the ESCB™s 

Banking Supervision Committee (BSC), 

analyses risks to financial stability in order to 

assess the financial system™s shock-absorbing 

capacity.
1 Banks are the main focus of 
monitoring activities, as they are still the 

primary intermediaries of funds and thus also 

the main potential conduit for risk in the 

financial system. At the same time, the 

increasing importance of other financial 

institutions and markets and their linkages with 

banks requires vulnerabilities in these 

components of the financial system to be 

monitored by the ESCB. 
CYCLICAL DEVELOPMENTS
In 2006 the financial condition of euro area 

financial institutions continued to improve, 

consolidating upon the improvements witnessed 

since 2003. Financial institutions have benefited 

from benign macroeconomic and financial 

conditions, despite the incipient tightening of 

global liquidity supply, and in the case of 

insurance companies, from the absence of 

major natural disasters. The vulnerability of 

the euro area financial institutions to adverse 

developments has diminished considerably on 

account of sustained positive results, and the 

outlook remains positive; however, some 

risks remain. Despite some rebalancing of 

international growth patterns and recent 

declines in oil prices, large global financial 

imbalances remain a source of medium-term 

risk; moreover, the potential for an adverse 

turn in the credit cycle may have increased, as 

might the potential for an abrupt unwinding 

of leveraged speculative positions. At the same 
time, euro area banks™ exposure to credit risk 

has grown following the expansion of bank 

lending, although banks have used credit risk 

transfer products to shed risk. Some banks have 

also become increasingly exposed to short-term 

leveraged financing, especially in relation to 

private equity deals, where competition for 

increasingly large deals may have put pressure 

on banks™ credit standards. Finally, the 

persistently low volatility in the financial 

markets may also have encouraged banks to 

expand their positions in various asset classes, 

thereby increasing their exposure to market 

risk. In this context, banks™ increasing use of 

new and complex financial instruments in the 

wholesale market has given rise to new 

counterparty risks related to legal and 

reputational issues. 
The profitability of large euro area banks 
strengthened further in 2006. Although the 

uneven transition to the International Financial 

Reporting Standards (IFRS) across the euro 

area affects the current assessment, the 

comparability of key performance indicators 

has been broadly preserved, and profitability 

figures signal a broad-based improvement. The 

high profitability was mostly driven by strong 

lending growth both to households and to the 

non-financial corporate sector, although net 

interest income growth was subdued by 

persistently compressed interest rate margins 

and the flat yield curve. Fees and commission 

income as well as trading revenues also 

supported income growth. In addition, profits 

were supported by continued cost-containment 

measures and impairment charges which 

reached new historic lows as a result of 

improved risk management by banks and a very 

benign credit environment. Looking ahead, 

although several banks expect a deterioration in 

the credit cycle in the short run, most large euro 

area banks are in a comfortable position to 
1 FINANCIAL STABILITY 
1 Since the end of 2004 the ECB has published a biannual report 
on the stability of the euro area financial system entitled 
ﬁFinancial stability reviewﬂ. In 2006 it also published the fifth 

editions of the reports on ﬁEU banking sector stabilityﬂ and ﬁEU 

banking structuresﬂ. These publications present the main 

findings of the regular monitoring by the BSC of banking sector 

structure and stability, and are available on the ECB™s website.
137ECB Annual Report
2006absorb the ensuing gradual increase in 
impairment charges. 
The solvency ratio of euro area banks decreased 
slightly in 2006, owing to a strong increase in 

risk-weighted assets; however, their solvency 

levels remained strong and comfortably 

exceeded regulatory requirements. This was the 

result of sustained growth in income over the 

previous three years, which has supported 

substantial internal capital generation, and the 

retention of profits. 
According to the latest assessment by European 
insurance supervisors, profitability in the euro 

area insurance industry continued to rise in 

2006, extending the improvement in the sector™s 

financial conditions since 2004. The recent 

growth in total real premiums has been stronger 

for life than for non-life insurance undertakings. 

The positive performance of life insurance 

undertakings has been supported by strong 

sales of unit-linked products against a 

background of rising equity prices and by 

increasing sales of other, more traditional 

products. The substantial structural 

transformation of the euro area life insurance 

market, which is being driven mainly by 

ongoing tax reform and a longer-term rise in the 

penetration rate of insurance in the economy, 

has also supported premium growth. In the non-
life sector, premium rate hikes, which drove 

premium growth in previous years, have slowed 

down recently, largely reflecting intense 

competition in the sector. The financial position 

of pension funds improved further from 

previous years, but continued to be negatively 

affected by low bond yields in 2006. 
The global hedge fund and private equity 
industries continued to grow in 2006. Following 

net outflows from the hedge fund industry 

during the final quarter of 2005, aggregate net 

inflows recovered in the first half of 2006, 

rising to levels close to the peak observed 

during 2004. Some hedge funds, especially 

those with directional strategies (i.e. based on 

expectations of the direction of market changes), 

endured financial losses, mainly as a 
consequence of turbulence in financial markets 

during May and June 2006 and adverse 

developments in the natural gas market in 

August and September. Nevertheless, the 

industry as a whole continued to deliver positive 

returns. 
STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
Structural developments occurring in the 

banking industry may affect the nature and 

stability of the wider financial system. The 

long-term trends in consolidation, integration 

and internationalisation in the EU banking 

sector continued throughout 2006. These 

developments can benefit customers through 

increased competition, better service quality 

and innovation, but at the same time they carry 

the risk of facilitating the spread of financial 

disturbances across borders. Although the 

observed trends are common to most Member 

States, there are significant differences among 

them, in particular regarding consolidation, 

which is most prevalent in the more mature 

economies. 
Consolidation, as reflected in the decrease in 
the number of credit institutions, took place in 

parallel with a pick-up in cross-border mergers 

and acquisitions (M&As) in the EU banking 

sector during 2005 and the first half of 2006. 
138ECB Annual Report
2006The completion of several large deals and 
the higher level of M&A activity may indicate 

an end to the declining trend observed from 

2000. Recent cross-border M&A activity 

has also increasingly involved retail market 

intermediaries. 
The sustained growth in banking assets has 
been accompanied by disintermediation, as the 

assets of non-bank financial intermediaries 

(such as insurance companies and investment 

and pension funds) have also grown 

considerably. Banks appear to be adjusting to 

this trend by expanding their fee-earning 

activities, including investment banking and 

asset management. The resulting diversification 

of income sources may contribute to lowering 

banks™ risks and to stabilising their profits. 

However, channelling risks away from banks to 

other, often less regulated, financial 

intermediaries may also increase the overall 

level of risk uncertainty. 
Important demographic changes are occurring 
in the EU which may also have an impact on the 

banking sector. Changes in life expectancy, 

fertility rates and migration may result in 

downward pressure on banks™ intermediation 

ratios and on the demand for consumer credit 

and mortgages, thus reducing net interest 

income. Banks may respond by offering new 

products tailored to older customers as well as 

asset management and advisory services, 

leading to an increase in non-interest income. 

They may also diversify internationally, 

becoming more active in emerging market 

economies with different demographic 

structures. 
The funding base of EU banks continues to be 
largely made up of customer deposits, although 

these have become more diversified, both at the 

sectoral and the geographical level. The 

increasing commercialisation of more complex 

deposit instruments to a wide investor base may 

expose banks to reputational risks. There has 

been a slight shift towards (mainly short-term) 

market funding, while banks have become 

increasingly reliant on instruments such as 
mortgage bonds and securitisation. Such 

instruments offer scale advantages but are more 

expensive than funding via deposits. A growing 

centralisation of intra-group liquidity 

management has also been observed, which has 

clear advantages in terms of the efficiency of 

internal capital flows, but can also result in 

higher intra-group and cross-border contagion 

risks. 
1.2 COOPERATION IN FINANCIAL CRISIS 
SITUATIONS
The arrangements for handling financial crises 

between the authorities responsible for 

safeguarding financial stability at the EU level 

were further enhanced in the course of 2006. 

The Capital Requirements Directive, which 

was adopted in June 2006, transposes the 

revised capital requirements for credit 

institutions and investment firms into EU 

legislation and sets out a number of provisions 

that have a direct bearing on emergency 

situations. In particular, it specifies the 

information flows between the authorities 

potentially involved in cross-border crises, 

including supervisors and central banks. 
The BSC and the Committee of European 
Banking Supervisors (CEBS) made significant 

progress in identifying central banking and 

supervisory practices regarding information 

exchange and cooperation in the event of a 

financial crisis at the cross-border level. The 

aim of this work was to enhance the operational 

effectiveness of the existing arrangements and 

to identify areas where further progress is 

needed. 
In order to enhance understanding of the 
practical implementation of the EU 

arrangements, several financial crisis simulation 

exercises were organised. In April 2006 an EU-

wide simulation exercise took place under the 

aegis of the Economic and Financial Committee 

with the aim of testing the Memorandum of 

Understanding (MoU) that had been concluded 
139ECB Annual Report
2006in 2005.2 The ESCB contributed to the 
preparation and running of the exercise. 
The central banks of the euro area also carried 
out financial crisis simulation exercises to test 

the ability of the Eurosystem to address 

effectively a financial crisis with the potential 

for cross-border systemic implications. The 

most recent exercise took place in May 2006 

and involved the conduct of monetary policy 

operations, the oversight and operation of 

market infrastructures, and the safeguarding of 

financial stability. Given the high degree of 

financial integration within the euro area, the 

exercise placed particular emphasis on the 

interlinkages between financial institutions, 

markets and market infrastructures, both on a 

national and a cross-border basis. The exercise 

confirmed the preparedness of the Eurosystem 

for dealing with potentially systemic events 

that might affect the euro area financial 

system.

2005, pp. 120-121.140ECB Annual Report
20062.1 GENERAL ISSUES
On 5 December 2005 the European Commission 
released its White Paper on Financial Services 

Policy 2005-2010. The document, which will 

shape the Commission™s medium-term policy 

programme in the field of financial services, 

aims to support further integration in the EU 

financial sector by dynamically consolidating 

the regulatory framework already set in place by 

the Financial Services Action Plan. The overall 

objective of the White Paper was broadly 

supported by the Eurosystem in its contribution 

to the Commission™s public consultation on the 

document.3 In view of the fact that the White 
Paper is now being implemented, the ECB will 

continue to cooperate with the Commission and 

monitor its policy agenda, as well as ensuring 

the timely involvement of the Eurosystem in its 

fields of competence. The ECB will also provide 

technical support for the Commission™s actions 

that may have a bearing on financial stability 

and on the integration of European financial 

markets. 
As regards the Lamfalussy framework4, the 
Commission and the European Parliament 
agreed on a revision of the comitology 

procedures (the system of committees through 

which Community legislation is adopted) which 

grant the Parliament scrutiny powers over the 

measures adopted by the Commission to 

implement Level 1 framework legislation. This 

will enable the Lamfalussy committees to 

continue to contribute effectively to the process 

for EU financial services legislation.5 The 
adoption by the ECOFIN Council of 

recommendations made by the Financial 

Services Committee6 will result in the further 
development of some existing supervisory tools 

in order to fully exploit the Lamfalussy 

framework. In this context, CEBS continued its 

work on the implementation of the Capital 

Requirements Directive with a view to 

delivering supervisory convergence in practice. 

The Committee of European Securities 

Regulators (CESR) also focused on delivering 

effective supervisory convergence in the 

securities sector (Level 3). 
On 23 October 2006 the ECB published a report 

providing an overview of recent changes in the 

supervisory structures of the then 25 EU 

Member States and two acceding countries.7 The report identified the following trends. First, 

there is a move towards consolidation among 

supervisory authorities at the national level, 

with the aim of enhancing efficiency and 

effectiveness. The reasons for the unification of 

supervisory responsibilities may include the 

blurring of demarcation lines  between financial 

sectors or the existence of a relatively small 

financial market. However, not all Member 

States use the same supervisory model, as the 

institutional structure chosen depends on the 

specific national setting. Second, central banks 

play a role in nearly all national supervisory 

systems. In some cases, they have direct 

supervisory responsibilities or have concluded 

cooperation arrangements with the national 

supervisors according to which they undertake 

certain supervisory tasks. In a number of 

countries, the search for increased efficiency 

has led to arrangements under which resources 

are shared between central banks and 

supervisors. Finally, nearly all Member States 

are moving towards formal agreements to 

ensure cooperation and the sharing of 

information between central banks and banking 

supervisors. Arrangements involving main

the ECB™s Annual Report 2003, p. 111. The Lamfalussy 

approach is a four-level process for approving securities, 

banking and insurance legislation. Level 1 consists of framework 

principles, in the form of directives or regulations, to be adopted 

by normal EU legislative procedures. Level 2 arranges for the 

implementation of detailed measures following the Level 1 

framework principles. Level 3 consists of enhanced cooperation 

and networking among EU supervisors to ensure a consistent 

and equivalent transposition of Level 1 and Level 2 legislation. 

Level 4 consists of strengthened enforcement, notably with 

action by the Commission to enforce Community law, 

underpinned by enhanced cooperation between Member States, 

their regulatory bodies and the private sector.

finance ministries. 
2.2 BANKINGThe ECB continued to contribute in 2006 to the 

work of CEBS and the Basel Committee on 

Banking Supervision (BCBS) through its 

participation in the main committees and some 

of their substructures. Following the definition 

of the conceptual elements of the revised 

framework for the ﬁInternational Convergence 

of Capital Measurement and Capital Standardsﬂ 

(ﬁBasel IIﬂ), the BCBS agreed in May 2006 to 

keep the quantitative parameters unchanged 

and thereby finalised the revised framework. 

This decision was supported by the results of 

the fifth Quantitative Impact Study (ﬁQIS 5ﬂ), 

a data collection exercise organised by the 

BCBS to assess the impact of the revised capital 

rules on banks. CEBS played a prominent role 

in carrying out the QIS 5 at the EU level. 

Overall, the QIS 5 results proved to be consistent 

with the incentive structure built into the 

framework for credit institutions to move 

towards the more advanced approaches for 

calculating their capital requirements. 
The Capital Requirements Directive was 
adopted in June 2006, transposing the revised 

capital rules into Community law. The 

legislative process with regard to Basel II is, 

therefore, complete at the EU level, and the 

revised capital framework, including the use of 

the more advanced approaches, will be fully 

operational in the EU from January 2008. As of 

January 2007 credit institutions may already 

adopt the less advanced approaches for 

calculating the capital requirements for credit 

and operational risk. The transitional 

arrangements for the scheduled implementation 

of the framework in the United States differ 

from those in the EU, with the United States 

intending to make only the most advanced 

methods available to its banks, with a one-year 

delay. The ECB continues to monitor these 

developments in order to assess the possible 

impact for the EU banking sector. 
On 18 December 2006 the ECB issued an 

opinion on the Commission proposal to amend 

the existing framework for the prudential 

assessment of acquisitions and increases 

of qualifying shareholdings in financial 

institutions.8 The proposal aims to clarify the 
applicable procedure and assessment criteria. 

The ECB welcomed the proposal as an important 

measure to ensure that such assessments follow 

strictly prudential criteria, are transparent vis-
à-vis market participants and are implemented 

consistently across countries. At the same time, 

the ECB raised a number of concerns regarding 

certain elements of the proposal. In particular, 

the ECB proposed that the assessment criteria 

be aligned more closely with the criteria 

considered during the authorisation process and 

that it be clarified that the target institution is 

expected to comply with all applicable 

prudential requirements. Moreover, the ECB 

suggested that the Commission reconsider, in 

close cooperation with supervisory authorities, 

the proposed time limits to ensure sound and 

reasoned decisions. 
2.3 SECURITIESThe new regulatory framework for the securities 

sector provided for by the Financial Services 

Action Plan was completed in 2006 with the 

adoption of the outstanding Level 2 

implementing measures concerning the Markets 

in Financial Instruments Directive and the 

Transparency Directive. Furthermore, in early 

2007 the Commission adopted a Level 2 

directive with a view to clarifying certain 

provisions of Council Directive 85/611/EEC 

prescribing the assets which are eligible for 

investment by undertakings for collective 

investment in transferable securities (UCITS). 

This will ensure the consistent implementation 

and interpretation of the UCITS legislation 

across the EU. Given the importance of these 

measures for the integration of European 

financial markets and the enhancement of 

financial stability, the ECB has closely followed, 
8 CON/2006/60.142ECB Annual Report
2006and contributed to, the work in this area through 
its participation in the European Securities 

Committee. 
The Eurosystem regularly assessed whether the 
Level 2 implementing measures to be adopted 

by the Commission were within the ECB™s 

advisory competence, thereby potentially 

triggering a formal ECB opinion. An ECB 

opinion was adopted on the above-mentioned 

Directive concerning the eligible assets for 

UCITS, since the draft directive contained 

provisions that might affect the functioning of 

European money markets, which is of 

importance to the implementation of the euro 

area™s monetary policy. 
Finally, following the European Commission™s 
public consultation in 2005 on a Green Paper 

Œ to which the Eurosystem contributed Œ and 

the work by market expert groups, in which the 

ECB also participated, the Commission 

published a White Paper on the enhancement of 

the EU framework for investment funds in 

November 2006. It identified a package of 

measures designed to simplify the operating 

environment for investment funds. Such 

measures will include targeted adjustments to 

the UCITS Directive to simplify the existing 

rules allowing investment funds to be marketed 

across borders in the EU, to expand the freedoms 

available to UCITS funds and their managers, 

and to enhance supervisory cooperation. The 

objectives and actions envisaged by the 

Commission™s White Paper are broadly 

supported by the ECB. 
2.4 ACCOUNTINGThroughout the year, the ECB continued to 

contribute to work being carried out in the area 

of accounting via its participation in the 

accounting subgroups of the BCBS and in 

CEBS, as well as in the Standards Advisory 

Council of the International Accounting 

Standards Board. 
Following its mandate to assess regulatory and 

supervisory developments from a financial 

stability perspective, the BSC produced a report 

on the assessment of accounting standards.9  The report focuses on the recent introduction in 

Europe of a new accounting framework, based 

on the IFRS, analysing its possible consequences 

for the banking sector and other financial firms 

and its appropriateness from a system-wide 

financial stability perspective. The underlying 

premise is that accounting is relevant for 

financial stability and should, when possible, 

effectively contribute to further strengthening 

it. The report presents ten general benchmark 

criteria for assessing accounting standards. 

Based on an analysis of the extent to which the 

IFRS meet these criteria, the report identifies 

the positive aspects of certain features of the 

IFRS, as well as concerns and possible areas for 

improvement from a financial stability 

perspective. These proposals focus on three 

main areas, namely the reliability of ﬁfairﬂ 

values, the economic basis for hedge accounting 

and the provisioning regime for credit risk.9 The report is available on the ECB™s website.
143ECB Annual Report
2006The Eurosystem has a keen interest in financial 
integration in Europe, as a well-integrated 

financial system enhances the smooth and 

effective transmission of monetary policy 

impulses in the euro area and has implications 

for the Eurosystem™s task of safeguarding 

financial stability. Financial integration also 

supports the efficient operation and smooth 

functioning of clearing and payment systems. 

Furthermore, financial integration Œ a priority 

Community objective Œ can help to promote the 

development of the financial system, raising 

the potential for economic growth. 
The Eurosystem distinguishes between four 
types of activity through which it contributes 

to enhancing European financial integration: 

i) raising awareness of and monitoring financial 

integration, ii) acting as a catalyst for private 

sector activities by facilitating collective action, 

iii) giving advice on the legislative and 

regulatory framework for the financial system 

and direct rule-making, and iv) providing 

central banking services that also foster 

financial integration. The ECB continued its 

activities in all four areas throughout 2006. 
RAISING AWARENESS OF AND MONITORING 

FINANCIAL INTEGRATION 
In September 2006 the ECB published a report 

on indicators of financial integration for the 

main segments of the euro area financial 

system.10 This report extended the scope of the 
analysis provided in 2005, in particular by 

including additional indicators relating to banks 

and financial infrastructures. The analysis of 

banking markets has been enhanced by adding 

indicators on the cross-border presence of euro 

area banks and on corporate banking. The 

indicators related to financial infrastructures 

are allocated to the main financial market 

served by the respective infrastructure, in 

recognition of the fact that financial 

infrastructures play a significant role in the 

integration of financial markets. Furthermore, 

quantity-based indicators of financial 

integration have been systematically computed 

for the main market segments. As further 

advances are made in research and economic 
analysis and more statistics become available, 

the range of indicators is expected to be further 

extended, for example with indicators on the 

integration of insurance markets. Taking a 

broader perspective, the ECB will use the 

quantitative indicators to monitor progress in 

financial integration, to identify the areas where 

integration is lacking, and to underpin its 

analysis of topical, policy-relevant issues in the 

field of financial integration. 
In 2006 the ECB continued its involvement in 
the Research Network on Capital Markets and 

Financial Integration in Europe, which it runs 

with the Center for Financial Studies. The 

network continued its series of conferences 

with academics, market participants and policy-
makers with the active participation of NCBs. 

Its seventh conference, hosted by the Deutsche 

Bundesbank on 28-29 September 2006, focused 

on ﬁFinancial system modernisation and 

economic growthﬂ. The eighth conference on 

ﬁFinancial integration and stability in Europeﬂ, 

hosted by the Banco de España, took place on 

30 November-1 December 2006. 
In the context of the network, the ECB each 
year awards five ﬁLamfalussy Fellowshipsﬂ to 

young researchers. One of the reasons for the 

ECB™s interest in promoting research in this 

area is that financial integration is expected to 

have implications for the development of the 

financial system and for economic growth. The 

ECB™s work on financial integration is therefore 

closely linked to its wider analysis of factors 

supporting the adequate functioning of financial 

systems. Work in this area continued in 2006, 

with the aim of setting out a conceptual 

framework for measuring financial system 

performance. 
On 20 September 2006 the ECB published a 
report on differences in MFI interest rates 

across euro area countries, which was prepared 

by the Monetary Policy Committee and the

website at http://www.ecb.int/stats/finint/html/index.en.
html 144ECB Annual Report
2006Statistics Committee. As a follow-up to the 
report, the Eurosystem now releases tables 

providing an overview of 15 types of average 

deposit and lending interest rates in each euro 

area country. By making available detailed and 

comprehensive information on average MFI 

interest rates, the Eurosystem aims to ensure 

that comparisons across countries are made on 

a well-informed basis. On 25 October 2006 the 

ECB published its annual report on EU banking 

structures (see also Section 1.1 of this 

chapter). 
Finally, in addition to the MFI statistics, the 
ESCB also develops statistical information on 

non-MFIs as institutional investors (e.g. 

investment funds). These statistics are relevant 

from a monetary policy perspective and also 

assist in the monitoring of the financial 

integration process. An ECB regulation on the 

statistical reporting requirements for investment 

funds is under preparation. Work is also under 

way to assess the need for and feasibility of 

enhancing the available statistical information 

on insurance corporations and pension funds, 

focusing on ways to improve the availability of 

intra-annual (mainly quarterly) financial data. 
ACTING AS A CATALYST FOR PRIVATE SECTOR 

ACTIVITIES 
Progress in European financial integration 

depends to a large extent on private sector 

initiatives to make use of the existing 

opportunities for cross-border business. Public 

authorities support such private coordination 

efforts. In 2006 the Eurosystem acted as a 

catalyst for two such initiatives: the Short-Term 

European Paper (STEP) initiative and the Single 

Euro Payments Area (SEPA) initiative. 
The ECB has supported the STEP initiative 
since its inception in 2001. The STEP initiative 

aims to foster the integration of the European 

markets for short-term paper through the 

convergence of market standards and practices. 

On 11 July 2006 the ECB held a press conference 

together with ACI Œ The Financial Markets 

Association and the European Banking 

Federation to mark the official launch of the 
STEP market. The Eurosystem™s contribution to 

the STEP market focuses on two activities. 

First, the ECB and nine euro area NCBs will, 

until June 2008, provide technical assistance to 

the STEP Secretariat in the STEP labelling 

process, whereby the ultimate responsibility for 

granting and withdrawing the STEP label rests 

with the STEP Secretariat. Second, the ECB 

will regularly produce statistics on yields and 

volumes in the STEP market and publish them 

on its website. 
The STEP statistics are expected to play an 
important role in fostering the integration of 

this market by creating greater market 

transparency. Following a gradual approach, 

the ECB first published STEP statistics on 

monthly outstanding amounts, with full 

coverage, from September 2006 and 

subsequently prepared for the publication of 

STEP statistics on volumes and yields on a 

daily basis with selected data providers. It is 

planned that daily statistics for all data providers 

will be published from 2008. On 14 September 

2006 the Governing Council decided that the 

STEP market would be accepted as a non-

regulated market for collateral purposes in the 

Eurosystem credit operations as soon as the 

STEP statistics on yields were published on the 

ECB™s website. 
The SEPA project was launched in 2002 by the 
European Payments Council (EPC) with the 

aim of achieving a fully integrated market for 

retail payment services in the euro area, and the 

Eurosystem has played a catalyst role since the 

project™s inception. In 2006 the ECB provided 

an updated overview of the progress achieved 

in completing the SEPA and specified its 

expectations for the period ahead.11 On 4 May 
2006 the ECB and the European Commission 

issued a joint statement laying down their vision 

of the SEPA and stating their intention to 

collaborate closely on the realisation of the 

SEPA. In particular, the European banking 

industry and the other relevant stakeholders 
11 ﬁTowards a Single Euro Payments Area Œ Objectives and 
Deadlines (Fourth Progress Report)ﬂ, February 2006.145ECB Annual Report
2006were encouraged to create the conditions for 
the realisation of the SEPA by the beginning of 

2008, and to reach a critical mass of SEPA 

transactions by the end of  2010. The Eurosystem 

organised a number of meetings in 2006 with 

different stakeholders, i.e. SEPA high-level 

meetings with the banking industry as well as 

meetings with end-users and infrastructure and 

card providers. The ECB also sponsored the 

SEPA congress during Euro Finance Week in 

November 2006. In addition, the ECB 

participated as an observer in EPC plenary 

meetings and working groups. Throughout 2006 

the Eurosystem continued to provide assistance 

to the banking industry with regard to the design 

and preparation of the new SEPA instruments 

and frameworks, such as the creation of a 

common set of rules for the SEPA credit transfer 

and SEPA direct debit instruments, detailed 

guidance for the banking industry concerning 

card payments12 and technical standards and 
implementation guidelines to ensure the smooth 

and secure functioning of the different schemes. 

With regard to infrastructures, the Eurosystem 

urged the market to proceed with the timely 

development of retail payment systems which 

are able to process the SEPA instruments and 

are fully interoperable. It also recommended 

that market infrastructures exploit economies 

of scale and use modern technology to reduce 

costs. The Eurosystem also contributed to the 

preparations for the implementation of and 

migration to the SEPA and continued to support 

the SEPA project through its communication 
tools (such as press releases, reports, speeches 

and, more recently, the SEPA brochure). 
ADVICE ON THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY 

FRAMEWORK FOR THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND 

DIRECT RULE-MAKINGThe ECB and the Eurosystem regularly 

contribute to the development of the EU 

legislative and regulatory framework by 

providing advice on the main policy 

developments and initiatives under way. 
Activity with regard to the EU framework for 
financial supervision focused in 2006 on 

safeguarding the effective implementation of 

the revised institutional framework (see also 

Section 2 of this chapter). The European 

Commission™s White Paper on Financial 

Services Policy 2005-2010, to which the 

Eurosystem contributed, and the Financial 

Services Committee™s ﬁReport on financial 

supervisionﬂ, to which the ECB contributed, 

identify adequate policy measures in this 

regard. As part of its advisory role in accordance 

with Article 105(4) of the Treaty, the ECB 

regularly provides advice on Commission 

proposals for Level 2 legislation (see 

Section 2). 
The ECB continued its work on the integration 
of European mortgage markets following the 
12 For more details, see ﬁThe Eurosystem™s view of a ‚SEPA for 
cards™ﬂ, 20 November 2006.146ECB Annual Report
2006Eurosystem™s contribution at the end of 2005 to 
the European Commission™s Green Paper on 

this subject.13 The further integration and 
development of mortgage (and other retail 

banking) markets is relevant for monetary 

policy transmission in the euro area. 

Furthermore, financial integration can have 

important financial stability implications. 

Following its Green Paper consultation, the 

Commission is expected to publish a White 

Paper in May 2007. The ECB contributes to 

integration in this field, among other things, 

through its participation in the Commission™s 

expert group on mortgage funding and in the 

context of the European Financial Markets 

Lawyers Group (EFMLG) regarding legal 

obstacles to cross-border securitisation in the 

EU. 
Finally, in the field of financial infrastructure, 
the ECB provided input on issues related to the 

integration of securities settlement systems and 

of payment systems. The current fragmentation 

of the EU securities clearing and settlement 

infrastructure presents a major obstacle to the 

further integration of European bond and equity 

markets. In July 2006 the European Commission 

highlighted the importance of market-led 

initiatives in this area and suggested that the 

clearing and settlement industry should work 

on a code of conduct for best market practice. 

This ﬁEuropean Code of Conduct for Clearing 

and Settlementﬂ was signed on 7 November 

2006. It aims to foster competition and improve 

efficiency, for example by ensuring transparency 

of prices and services. At the same time, public 

policy efforts to reduce legal and fiscal barriers 

continued. The ECB is closely involved in this 

work through its participation in the Clearing 

and Settlement Advisory and Monitoring Expert 

Group and in the Legal Certainty Group. The 

ECB also monitors the work of the Clearing and 

Settlement Fiscal Compliance Expert Group, 

which provides advice to the Commission on 

possible ways of overcoming the tax-related 

barriers to cross-border clearing and settlement 

in the EU. With respect to integration in 

payment services, the technical and business 

barriers are being addressed in the context of 
the SEPA project (see above), while the ECB 

issued an opinion on the Commission™s proposal 

for a directive on payment services in the 

Internal Market which aims to remove the legal 

barriers.14 The ECB welcomed the proposed 
directive to the extent that it would establish a 

comprehensive legal framework for payment 

services in the EU. It considered that the 

harmonisation of regulatory requirements for 

payment services would provide legal certainty 

for the extended cross-border provision of such 

services, and that timely adoption and 

transposition of the directive would support the 

efforts of the banking industry to establish the 

SEPA. The ECB pointed out that non-bank 

payment service providers should be subject to 

regulation in proportion to the scope of their 

activities. The adoption of the proposed 

directive should not be delayed because the 

introduction of SEPA-compliant national 

schemes on 1 January 2008 and full migration 

to such schemes by 2010 could be put at risk. 

In this regard, Titles III and IV of the proposed 

directive are crucial as they introduce a 

harmonised set of rules regarding information 

requirements, authorisation, execution time and 

liability in respect of payment transactions. 
PROVIDING CENTRAL BANKING SERVICES WHICH 

FOSTER FINANCIAL INTEGRATION
On 21 October 2005 the Eurosystem confirmed 

that TARGET2 would start operations on 

19 November 2007. The Eurosystem continued 

its work on the new system in 2006 (see 

Section 2.2 of Chapter 2). 
With a view to reaping the full benefits of the 
establishment of the TARGET2 system, the 

Eurosystem started to explore the possibility of 

providing settlement services in central bank 

money to CSDs for securities transactions in 

euro. The possibility provided by TARGET2 to 

centralise the cash settlement in a single account 

is likely to increase the market demand for also 

centralising the securities settlement through a 
13 ﬁThe European Commission™s Green Paper on mortgage credit 
in the EU Œ Eurosystem contribution to the public consultationﬂ,

14 COM(2005) 603 final.
147ECB Annual Report
2006single securities account. The objective of this 
new service, called TARGET2-Securities, will 

be to provide a common technical infrastructure 

for the euro settlement of securities transactions 

in central bank money by CSDs and to process 

both securities and cash settlements on a single 

technical platform (see Section 2.3 of 

Chapter 2). 
On 20 October 2006 the ECB announced that 
the Governing Council had discussed market 

reactions to the informal consultation on the 

proposal to offer such a service and had asked 

the Payment and Settlement Systems Committee 

to prepare a feasibility study on the project. 
With regard to the Eurosystem™s collateral 
framework, the Eurosystem specified in 2006 

the eligibility criteria for non-marketable assets 

to be included in the single list of collateral. 

These criteria were set out in ﬁThe 

implementation of monetary policy in the euro 

area: General documentation on Eurosystem 

monetary policy instruments and proceduresﬂ, 

which was published on 15 September 2006. 

The inclusion of non-marketable assets in the 

single list since 1 January 2007 marks the final 

step in the gradual replacement of the 

Eurosystem™s two-tier collateral system. 
Finally, the Governing Council decided on 
3 August 2006 to extend beyond 2007 the 

correspondent central banking model for the 

cross-border transfer of collateral within 

the Eurosystem (see also Section 2.4 of 

Chapter 2).148ECB Annual Report
2006Payment systems oversight is one of the 
Eurosystem™s main tasks. By overseeing 

payment systems, in particular those that are 

systemically important15, the Eurosystem 
contributes to the safety and efficiency of 

financial infrastructures and, consequently, to 

the efficiency of payment flows for goods, 

services and financial assets in the economy. 

The close relationship between payment 

systems and securities clearing and settlement 

systems means that central banks in general and 

the Eurosystem in particular also take a strong 

interest in securities clearing and settlement. 

The overall aim pursued by the Eurosystem is 

to minimise systemic risk. 
4.1 OVERSIGHT OF LARGE-VALUE EURO 
PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURES 
The Eurosystem oversees all payment systems 

and infrastructures which process and/or settle 

euro transactions, including those managed by 

the Eurosystem itself. The Eurosystem applies 

the same oversight standards to both its own 

systems and those that are privately operated. 

These standards are the Core Principles for 

Systemically Important Payment Systems, 

defined by the G10 Committee on Payment and 

Settlement Systems (CPSS) and adopted by the 

Governing Council in 2001. In 2006 the 

Governing Council adopted business continuity 

expectations for systemically important 

payment systems. These now form an integral 

part of the Eurosystem™s oversight framework 

and help to ensure a sufficient and consistent 

level of resilience across all systemically 

important payment systems which are located 

in the euro area and operate in euro. 
TARGET 
In accordance with the common TARGET 

oversight framework and objectives, the ECB 

and the NCBs perform regular and change-
driven oversight activities with regard to the 

national RTGS systems which participate in or 

are connected to TARGET, as well as with 

regard to the ECB payment mechanism (EPM). 

When substantial changes are made to the 
TARGET system, the relevant aspects are 

subject to an oversight review before becoming 

operational. In accordance with its common 

oversight policy, the Eurosystem in 2006 carried 

out an in-depth oversight assessment of the 

impact of connecting Eesti Pank™s euro real-

time gross settlement (RTGS) system to the 

existing TARGET system via the Banca 

d™Italia™s RTGS system. It concluded that the 

connection would not have an adverse impact 

on the smooth functioning of TARGET. With 

regard to Slovenia™s entry into the euro area, 

Banka Slovenije decided not to develop its own 

euro RTGS system, but to use the RTGS system 

of the Deutsche Bundesbank. As a result, an 

oversight review was not considered necessary 

as no new infrastructure was being introduced 

in TARGET. 
The future TARGET2 system will have to 
observe the Eurosystem™s oversight standards 

in the same way as any other systemically 

important euro payment system in the euro area 

and is therefore subject to an oversight review. 

Following the implementation of the general 

organisational framework for TARGET2 

oversight, the ECB has been leading and 

coordinating TARGET2 oversight activities. 

The NCBs are primarily responsible for 

performing the oversight activities relating to 

the local features of the system, whenever such 

features are only relevant for the national 

environment. They also contribute to the 

oversight activities in relation to the central 

TARGET2 features. As TARGET2 is still in its 

design phase, the TARGET overseers made a 

preliminary oversight assessment in 2006 of the 

design of the system. The overseers continue to 

monitor the development of the TARGET2 

system and will perform a comprehensive 

assessment before it goes live. 
EURO1 
EURO1 is the largest privately operated 

payment system for euro credit transfers 
4 OVERSIGHT OF MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES
15 A payment system is considered systemically important if a 
disruption within it could trigger or transmit further disruptions 
among participants and, ultimately, in the wider financial 

system.149ECB Annual Report
2006operating in the euro area. It is operated by the 
clearing company of the Euro Banking 

Association, EBA CLEARING. EURO1 works 

on a multilateral net basis. The end-of-day 

positions of EURO1 participants are ultimately 

settled via the TARGET system. In 2006 the 

ECB™s oversight activities focused on the 

assessment of a new liquidity management 

feature, the ﬁliquidity bridgeﬂ, prior to its 

implementation. The liquidity bridge aims to 

allow participating banks to move payment 

capacity to and from EURO1 on an intraday 

basis, enabling them to adapt their processing 

capacity in EURO1 to their individual payment 

needs. The oversight assessment of the liquidity 

bridge did not reveal any adverse impact on 

EURO1™s observance of the Core Principles. 

The ECB will continue to monitor the 

functioning of this feature and any further 

developments in EURO1. 
CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEM 
The Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) 

system provides settlement services for foreign 

exchange transactions in 15 major currencies 

around the world. Run by CLS Bank, it 

eliminates a significant amount of foreign 

exchange settlement risk by settling the two 

currency legs involved in foreign exchange 

trades simultaneously, i.e. on a payment-versus-

payment basis, and only when sufficient funds 

are available. The continuous safety and 

efficiency of CLS is of prime importance to the 

Eurosystem, because the CLS system is, in 

terms of value, the largest payment system 

settling euro transactions outside the euro area. 

Within the CLS cooperative oversight 

arrangement under the lead of the Federal 

Reserve System, the ECB is the primary 

overseer for the settlement of euro 

transactions.In December 2006 CLS settled an average of 
290,000 foreign exchange transactions per day 

with an average daily settlement value 

equivalent to •2.6 trillion.16 With a share of 
19% of all transactions settled in CLS, the euro 

has continued to be the most important currency 

for settlement after the US dollar (46%). The 
average daily value of CLS transactions settled 

in euro was •489 billion. 
In 2006 the Eurosystem took part in a study 
conducted by the BIS among major foreign 

exchange market participants in order to 

identify the risk mitigation methods they use to 

reduce foreign exchange settlement risk. The 

results of this study will be available in 2007 

and will form the basis of a central bank 

assessment of the G10 strategy to reduce foreign 

exchange settlement risk, as defined in the 1996 

BIS report entitled ﬁSettlement risk in foreign 

exchange transactionsﬂ. 
BUSINESS CONTINUITY 
In May 2006 the Governing Council approved 

the ﬁBusiness continuity oversight 
expectations for systemically important 

payment systems (SIPS)ﬂ report. The report 
aims to establish a harmonised oversight 

framework for business continuity in the euro 

area, thus promoting a level playing-field. It 

provides oversight guidance to SIPS operators 

in order to achieve sufficient and consistent 

levels of resilience by sustaining market efforts 

to improve recovery and resumption capabilities. 

It outlines specific expectations with regard to 

the implementation of a fully operational 

secondary site and emphasises the need to 

regularly test and train staff who maintain 

critical functions. Tests should be based on a 

variety of plausible scenarios and their results 

should be shared with other relevant 

stakeholders. Finally, the report outlines the 

need for SIPS i) to establish clear crisis 

management and communication procedures to 

respond to crisis events, ii) to have alternative 

means of communication for sharing information 

after a crisis and iii) to ensure that they have 

adequate channels of communication with the 

relevant authorities. Some of the expectations 

have an impact on critical participants in SIPS 

and the SIPS™ third-party providers of 

outsourced critical services. The oversight 
16 Each foreign exchange trade consists of two transactions, one 
in each currency involved. Thus, in December 2006 CLS settled 
trades with an average daily value equivalent to around •1.3 

trillion.150ECB Annual Report
2006expectations should be implemented and tested 
by SIPS by June 2009 and by their critical 

participants and third-party providers of critical 

services by June 2010. The Eurosystem will 

perform regular reviews until June 2009 in 

order to measure the progress made by SIPS in 

implementing the expectations and to assess the 

risk of any possible delays. 
In September 2006 the ECB organised a 
conference in order to share information and 

experience in this area and to discuss business 

continuity issues in an integrated euro area. It 

was attended by representatives of EU and non-
EU central banks, financial institutions, and 

payment and securities market infrastructure 

operators. 
SWIFT 
SWIFT is not itself a payment or settlement 

system and, as such, is not a regulated entity. 

However, because of its systemic importance 

for the global financial market, the G10 central 

banks were of the opinion that SWIFT should 

be subject to cooperative oversight by central 

banks, with the Nationale Bank van België/
Banque Nationale de Belgique acting as lead 

overseer. The oversight of SWIFT focuses on 

the objectives of security, operational reliability, 

business continuity and resilience of the SWIFT 

infrastructure. To ascertain whether SWIFT is 

pursuing these objectives, overseers regularly 

assess whether SWIFT has put in place 

appropriate governance arrangements, 

structures, processes, risk management 

procedures and controls to enable it to 

effectively manage the potential risks it may 

pose to financial stability and to the soundness 

of financial infrastructures. The oversight of 

SWIFT is currently based on widely accepted 

principles and common market practices. They 

provide the basis for a risk-based oversight 

methodology which is applied to SWIFT 

business activities of relevance for financial 

stability. In the context of its participation in 

the cooperative oversight of SWIFT, the ECB 

worked with the G10 central banks in 2006 to 

establish a set of high-level oversight 

expectations that would be suitable for the 
assessment of SWIFT, taking into consideration 

SWIFT™s existing structure, processes, controls 

and procedures. The oversight expectations are 

expected to be finalised and integrated into the 

oversight group™s risk-based oversight 

methodology during 2007 (see also Section 2 of 

Chapter 6). 
4.2 RETAIL PAYMENT SERVICES
The Eurosystem™s oversight also covers retail 

payment systems. In 2006 the ECB continued 

to monitor the smooth functioning of the first 

pan-European automated clearing house for 

bulk payments in euro, STEP2, which is 

managed and operated by EBA CLEARING. 

Since oversight assessments of retail payment 

systems falling within the scope of the 

Eurosystem™s oversight were completed in 

2005, it was not considered necessary to conduct 

a new round of coordinated assessments in 

2006. 
4.3 SECURITIES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT
The Eurosystem has a strong interest in the 

smooth functioning of securities clearing and 

settlement systems because failures in the 

clearing, settlement and custody of collateral 

could jeopardise the implementation of 

monetary policy, the smooth functioning of 

payment systems and the maintenance of 

financial stability. 
The Eurosystem assesses the compliance of 
securities settlement systems (SSSs) in the euro 

area, as well as links between those SSSs, with 

the ﬁStandards for the use of EU securities 

settlement systems in ESCB credit operationsﬂ 

(known as ﬁEurosystem user standardsﬂ). 
The ECB contributed in 2006 to the work 
undertaken by the European Commission and 

the EU Council on the review of the Settlement 

Finality Directive and the debate on whether 

the Community should sign the Hague Securities 

Convention. The ECB also contributed to a 
151ECB Annual Report
2006report under preparation by the CPSS on 
clearing and settlement arrangements for over-

the-counter derivatives.17 In April 2006 the 
ECB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 

co-organised a conference in Frankfurt on 

central counterparty clearing issues. 
ASSESSMENT OF SECURITIES SETTLEMENT 

SYSTEMS AGAINST USER STANDARDS
In 2006 a new arrangement was implemented 

for the issuance, safe-keeping and settlement of 

international debt securities. Such securities, 

issued jointly in the two international central 

securities depositories (ICSDs), Euroclear Bank 

(Belgium) and Clearstream Banking 

Luxembourg, account for a significant 

proportion of securities eligible for Eurosystem 

credit operations. In the new structure, which 

has been assessed by the Eurosystem, a new 

form of global bearer certificate Œ the ﬁNew 

Global Noteﬂ (NGN) Œ represents the securities 

issue. International debt securities in global 

bearer form issued through the ICSDs after 

31 December 2006 will only be eligible as 

collateral for Eurosystem operations if the NGN 

form is used. Securities issued before or on that 

date will continue to be eligible for use as 

collateral throughout their lifetime. 
The annual assessment of the SSSs in the euro 
area and an ad hoc assessment of the links 

between these SSSs confirmed that the overall 

level of compliance with the standards is high, 

and that the SSSs have maintained their efforts 

to enhance compliance further. 
In preparation for Slovenia™s entry into the euro 
area on 1 January 2007, the Governing Council 

assessed the Slovenian SSS (KDD). The detailed 

analysis revealed that the Slovenian system was 

eligible for use in Eurosystem monetary policy 

and intraday credit operations. 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE STANDARDS FOR 

SECURITIES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT IN 

THE EUROPEAN UNION
The Governing Council approved a framework 

for cooperation on securities clearing and 

settlement systems between the ESCB and 
CESR in 2001. An ESCB-CESR working group 

drew up a draft report on ﬁStandards for 

securities clearing and settlement in the 

European Unionﬂ in 2004 with the aim of 

adapting the CPSS-IOSCO recommendations 

for SSSs to the EU environment. In the following 

two years the ESCB-CESR working group 

continued to work in this field in order to 

develop an ﬁassessment methodologyﬂ which 

would provide guidance on the effective 

implementation of the standards. A number of 

open issues were analysed in close cooperation 

with market participants and banking 

supervisors, such as the specific requirements 

for CSDs with a banking licence and the 

cooperation between relevant authorities. 

However, little progress was made in this field 

in 2006. 
On 11 July 2006 the European Commission 
invited the industry to reduce the cost of 

clearing and settlement in the EU. To this end, 

a code of conduct was signed on 7 November 

2006 by representatives of the Federation of 

European Securities Exchanges, the European 

Association of Central Counterparty Clearing 

Houses and the European Central Securities 

Depositories Association, as well as the member 

institutions of these groups. The code aims to 

foster competition and improve the efficiency 

of clearing and settlement in the EU by ensuring 

price transparency, rights of access, 

interoperability between infrastructures, service 

unbundling and accounting separation. 

However, it does not focus on financial stability 

and regulatory harmonisation, so the need for 

the ESCB-CESR standards remains.17 http://www.bis.org/press/p060213b.htm
CHAPTER 5EUROPEAN AND 
INTERNATIONAL 
RELATIONS
154ECB Annual Report
20061 EUROPEAN ISSUES 
In 2006 the ECB continued to have regular 
contact with European institutions and fora, in 

particular with the European Parliament, the 

ECOFIN Council, the Eurogroup and the 

European Commission (see Chapter 6). The 

President of the ECB participated in meetings 

of the ECOFIN Council when matters relating 

to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB were 

discussed, as well as in the meetings of the 

Eurogroup. The President of the Eurogroup and 

the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary 

Affairs attended meetings of the Governing 

Council when they deemed it appropriate. 
1.1 POLICY ISSUES
THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT 
In 2006 five euro area Member States (Germany, 
Greece, France, Italy and Portugal) and seven 

non-euro area Member States (Czech Republic, 

Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and 

the United Kingdom) were the subject of 

ongoing excessive deficit procedures. The 

existence of an excessive deficit in the United 

Kingdom was confirmed by the ECOFIN 

Council in January 2006. By contrast, the 

procedures for Cyprus and France were brought 

to an end in June 2006 and January 2007 

respectively, following confirmation that these 

countries had brought their deficits below the 

3% of GDP reference value in a credible and 

sustainable manner. 
In March 2006 the ECOFIN Council gave notice 
to Germany, in accordance with Article 104(9) 

of the Treaty, to take measures to reduce its 

deficit. This was only the second time that the 

ECOFIN Council had taken such a step, and the 

first time since the revision of the Stability and 

Growth Pact in March 2005. In this context, the 

Council decided to extend the deadline for 

Germany to correct its excessive deficit to 

2007. In October 2006 the ECOFIN Council 

issued a revised recommendation to Hungary, 

which, in view of a deterioration in the 

budgetary situation in that country, extended 

the deadline for Hungary to correct its excessive 

deficit from 2008 to 2009. In November 2006 
the Council adopted a decision in accordance 

with Article 104(8) of the Treaty, stating that 

the action taken by Poland was proving to be 

inadequate to correct its excessive deficit by 

2007. 
In all other cases, assessments of the action 
taken by Member States in response to the 

recommendations and notices they had received 

did not give rise to further procedural steps. 

Nonetheless, in some countries (notably Italy 

and Portugal), shortfalls in terms of compliance 

with intermediate consolidation targets and/or 

risks to planned consolidation paths were 

identified, calling for continued close 

monitoring. In February 2007 the German 

statistical office confirmed that Germany™s 

deficit was well below 3% of GDP in 2006, 

while latest indications suggest that Greece, 

Malta and the United Kingdom are also likely 

to report deficits of below 3% of GDP for 2006. 

However, such outcomes still need to be 

confirmed and their sustainability assessed 

before the excessive deficit procedures for 

these countries can be concluded. 
Further progress was made in 2006 in assessing 
the long-term sustainability of public finances 

in EU Member States. In February the EU™s 

Economic Policy Committee (EPC) and the 

European Commission published a report 

examining the fiscal impact of population 

ageing.1 The report, which updated the EPC/
Commission ageing reports of 2001 and 2003, 

presented estimates of the ageing-induced 

fiscal burden for EU Member States based 

on commonly agreed assumptions regarding 

the behaviour of key demographic and 

macroeconomic variables. For the euro area, 

and for the EU as a whole, the study indicated 

that an improvement in the structural budgetary 

position of around 3½% of GDP compared with 

the level in 2005 would be required in order to 

achieve a sustainable position. However, the 
1 ﬁThe impact of ageing on public expenditure: projections for the 
EU25 Member States on pensions, health care, long-term care, 
education and unemployment transfers (2004-2050)ﬂ, European 

Economy Special Report No 1/2006, Economic Policy 

Committee and European Commission.155ECB Annual Report
2006updated calculations are strongly dependent on 
the assumptions used, thus highlighting the 

importance of further refining existing 

methodologies. The estimates contained in the 

report served as input for subsequent analyses 

of long-term fiscal sustainability in EU Member 

States, both in the context of the examination of 

stability and convergence programmes and in 

the Commission™s first ﬁsustainability reportﬂ, 

published in November 20062. In this context, 
work also continues on developing an 

appropriate methodology to take into account 

implicit liabilities when calculating Member 

States™ medium-term budgetary objectives. 
THE LISBON STRATEGY 
In autumn 2006 Member States submitted 

progress reports on their 2005-08 national 

reform programmes in accordance with the 

European Council™s 2005 conclusions on the 

review of the Lisbon strategy, the EU™s wide-

ranging programme of economic, social and 

environmental reform, and its new governance 

framework.3 The programmes set out Member 
States™ structural reform strategies and review 

the progress they have made so far in meeting 

their commitments. These include ensuring the 

sustainability of public finances (in particular 

through the reform of pension and healthcare 

systems), reforming labour and product markets 

and social security systems, investing in 

research and development and innovation, and 

improving the regulatory environment of 

businesses (see also Chapter 1). 
The progress reports on the national reform 
programmes were assessed by the ECOFIN 

Council, with the assistance of the EPC, as well 

as by the European Commission, which 

published its second ﬁAnnual Progress 

Report on Growth and Jobsﬂ in December 

2006. The ECB attaches great importance 

to the implementation of structural reforms 

and welcomes the determination of 

the Commission and the Member States to 

implement the Lisbon strategy at the Community 

and national levels. It is particularly important 

that the euro area countries apply comprehensive 

reform measures, as they have a shared 
responsibility for ensuring the smooth 

functioning of EMU. 
THE DIRECTIVE ON SERVICES IN THE INTERNAL 

MARKETAs part of the objective to complete the Internal 

Market, the European Commission proposed a 

directive in January 2004 which would remove 

the legal and administrative barriers to the 

cross-border provision of services. Following 

substantive revisions during the legislative 

process, the European Parliament and the EU 

Council reached an agreement on the directive 

on 15 November 2006. The directive was 

adopted on 12 December 2006. 
If properly implemented, the directive will 
yield clear benefits for both service providers 

and users. The directive will prohibit certain 

restrictions on the provision of cross-border 

services and establish clear criteria for the 

requirements which Member States are allowed 

to impose on service providers from other EU 

countries. The directive will also facilitate the 

ﬁfreedom of establishmentﬂ by making it easier 

for service providers to set up business in other 

Member States. 
The directive should allow the EU to exploit the 
untapped potential for economic growth and 

employment expansion in the services sector, in 

particular by boosting cross-border competition 

and reducing the cost of doing business. As a 

result, the directive is expected to foster labour 

productivity and output and employment growth 

in the medium to long run, and to contribute to 

lower prices in the services sector, thereby 

benefiting consumers. Other parts of the 

economy which use services as an input into 

their production process are also likely to 

benefit.4 2 ﬁThe long-term sustainability of public finances in the European 
Unionﬂ, European Economy No 4/2006, European Commission.3 See the ECB™s Annual Report 2005, pp. 140-141.

156ECB Annual Report
20061.2 INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
CONVERGENCE REPORTS 
Following requests from Lithuania and 
Slovenia, the ECB and the European 

Commission, in line with Article 122 of the 

Treaty, each prepared a convergence report on 

the progress made by these two countries in 

meeting the conditions to join the euro area. On 

the basis of these convergence reports, which 

were published on 16 May 2006, and a proposal 

from the Commission, the ECOFIN Council 

adopted a decision on 11 July 2006 allowing 

Slovenia to introduce the euro as its currency 

from 1 January 2007 (see Chapter 3). On 

5 December 2006 the ECB and the European 

Commission published their regular convergence 

reports, which are prepared every other year, 

examining the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, 

Latvia, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and 

Sweden. None of these Member States met the 

conditions for adopting the euro. 
Following a discussion in the ECOFIN Council, 
the European Commission and the ECB clarified 

the interpretation and application of the price 

stability criterion in relation to enlargement of 

the euro area. On 10 October 2006 the ECOFIN 

Council reaffirmed that the reference value for 

price stability is to be calculated as the average 

inflation rate of the three best performing EU 

Member States plus 1.5 percentage points. 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL TREATY
In 2006 the ECB continued to follow the 

ratification process of the Treaty establishing a 

Constitution for Europe (Constitutional Treaty), 

as a number of its provisions are of relevance to 

the ESCB. The ECB took note that the ratification 

process continued despite the rejection of the 

Constitutional Treaty in France and the 

Netherlands in 2005. The number of Member 

States which have ratified the Constitutional 

Treaty or are very close to formal completion of 

the ratification process has reached 18: Belgium, 

Bulgaria, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, 

Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, 

Hungary, Malta, Austria, Romania, Slovenia, 

Slovakia and Finland. 
The ECB supports the objectives of the 

Constitutional Treaty, which aims to clarify the 

legal and institutional framework of the EU and 

to increase the Union™s ability to act at both the 

European and the international level, as well as 

confirming the existing monetary policy 

framework. The discussion on further progress 

in the institutional reform of the EU will  

continue under the German and Portuguese EU 

presidencies in 2007. 
EXTERNAL REPRESENTATION
Since the start of Monetary Union, the ECB has 

established itself as a key partner at the 

international level and is represented in relevant 

international institutions. 
In the field of economic affairs, arrangements 
for the external representation of EMU reflect 

the fact that economic policies have remained 

largely the competence of Member States. 

However, some progress towards a more unified 

representation has been achieved over recent 

years. 
The Eurogroup and the ECOFIN Council have 
recently considered proposals to strengthen the 

representation on EMU issues at the international 

level and to improve internal coordination in 

this regard. In particular, they endorsed a more 

comprehensive involvement of the President of 

the Eurogroup in G7 meetings and participation 

of the European Commission in international 

bodies such as the G20. 
REFORM OF THE EU™S COMITOLOGY PROCEDURES
In July 2006 the EU Council, the European 

Parliament and the European Commission 

agreed on a reform of the committee system 

through which Community legislation is 

adopted, known as the comitology procedures. 

The main element of the reform is the 

introduction of a ﬁregulatory procedure with 

scrutinyﬂ, which substantially strengthens the 

European Parliament™s powers over 

implementing measures. 
The reform is of particular importance for the 
Lamfalussy framework for the financial sector, 
157ECB Annual Report
2006a key feature of which is the delegation of 
implementing powers to the Commission. It 

will allow the Lamfalussy process to continue 

to play an important role in facilitating and 

speeding up financial integration in the EU (see 

also Chapter 4). 
1.3 DEVELOPMENTS IN AND RELATIONS WITH 
EU ACCEDING AND CANDIDATE COUNTRIES
The ECB intensified its cooperation with the 

central banks of the acceding and candidate 

countries with the aim of ensuring a smooth 

monetary integration process in the EU. This 

cooperation developed in parallel with the 

overall institutional dialogue between the EU 

and these countries. 
Following the signing of the Accession Treaty 
by Bulgaria and Romania on 25 April 2005, the 

governors of Banca Naional a României and 

 
 
 (Bulgarian National 
Bank) took part, as observers, in the meetings 

of the General Council of the ECB from 

16 June 2005, and experts from the two central 

banks were involved as observers in the 

meetings of ESCB committees. In addition, 

high-level meetings with Banca Naional a României and 
 
 
 (Bulgarian National Bank) took place in 

Frankfurt on 15 November and 6 December 

2006 respectively. In October 2006 three euro 

area NCBs (the Banque de France, the Banca 

d™Italia and De Nederlandsche Bank) completed 

their technical cooperation with Banca 

Naional a României in the form of an EU-financed twinning programme which had started 

in early 2005. A similar scheme was put in place 

with 
 
 
 (Bulgarian 
National Bank) in October 2006. 
On 26 September 2006 the European 
Commission concluded that Bulgaria and 

Romania had achieved solid progress in their 

preparations to join the EU. The Commission 

proposed some additional measures to further 

monitor the implementation of EU requirements 

in a limited number of areas, none of which, 
however, concerned the monetary sphere. 

Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU on 

1 January 2007 and their central banks became 

full members of the ESCB. 
After opening accession negotiations with 
Turkey on 3 October 2005, the Commission 

started negotiations on the individual chapters 

of the acquis communautaire
 on 12 June 2006. 
On 29 November 2006 the Commission 

presented its recommendations on the 

continuation of Turkey™s accession negotiations. 

It recommended that the chapters for which the 

technical preparations had been completed 

should remain open, while the start of 

negotiations on eight other chapters should be 

suspended until Turkey fulfilled its 

commitments. The European Council, at its 

meeting on 14-15 December 2006, decided to 

follow the Commission™s recommendations. 

The ECB continued its long-standing high-level 

policy dialogue with the Central Bank of the 

Republic of Turkey, which included an 

Executive Board-level visit to the ECB on 

28 June 2006. The discussions focused on 

recent macroeconomic and financial 

developments in Turkey, the transition of the 

Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey™s 

monetary policy to a fully-fledged inflation-
targeting regime, and the economic and 

monetary situation in the euro area. 
After the EU Council™s decision to open 
accession negotiations with Croatia on 

3 October 2005, the first phase of the 

negotiations began in June 2006. The ECB 

strengthened its bilateral relations with the 

Croatian National Bank, hosting its Governor 

in Frankfurt for the first high-level 

pre-accession dialogue in October 2006. 
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
was granted candidate status in December 2005. 
158ECB Annual Report
2006However, the European Council decided that 
negotiations would not be opened until a 

number of conditions were met, including the 

effective implementation of the Stabilisation 

and Association Agreement signed with the EU. 

In 2006 contacts intensified between the ECB 

and the National Bank of the Republic of 

Macedonia, as reflected in, among other things, 

the provision of technical assistance by the 

ECB in addition to that provided by a number 

of NCBs. 
159ECB Annual Report
20062 INTERNATIONAL ISSUES 
2.1 KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM 
SURVEILLANCE OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES IN 
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 
The Eurosystem plays an important role in the 

process of international multilateral surveillance 

of macroeconomic policies, which takes place 

mainly at the meetings of international 

organisations such as the IMF, the OECD and 

the BIS, as well as in fora such as the G7 and 

G20 finance ministers and central bank 

governors. In all relevant institutions and fora, 

the ECB has been granted either member status 

(for example, at the G20) or observer status (for 

example, at the IMF). The ECB assesses 

international economic policy developments 

with a view to contributing to a stable 

macroeconomic environment and sound 

macroeconomic and financial policies. 
The international economic environment in 
2006 continued to be dominated by the 

persistence of large global current account 

imbalances.5 In the United States, the current 
account deficit reached almost 6.6% of GDP, 

compared with 6.4% in the previous year; the 

United States now absorbs around 75% of 

global net savings. The main counterparts of 

the US deficit are to be found in Asia and in 

oil-exporting countries. In Asia, current account 

surpluses remained substantial, reaching around 

4.3% of GDP on average, which is around the 

same as in 2005. In particular, current account 

surpluses reached more than 7.2% in China, 

around 3.7% in Japan and 2.7% in the group of 

ﬁother Asian emerging countriesﬂ. Oil-exporting 

countries on average ran a substantially higher 

current account surplus in 2006 (18.2% of 

GDP) than in 2005 (15.1%).6 Certain Asian and 
oil-exporting economies also continued to 

accumulate considerable amounts of reserve 

assets. The accumulation of reserves was 

particularly large in the case of China, where 

the level of foreign exchange reserves reached 

around USD 1 trillion. 
The Eurosystem continued to stress, on various 
occasions, the risks and uncertainties related to 
the continuation of such imbalances, and 

maintained its full support for a cooperative 

approach on this issue, as outlined in the G7 

communiqués of 21 April and 16 September 

2006. All key economies should endeavour to 

contribute to a progressive and orderly 

adjustment of the imbalances in order to 

preserve and strengthen the prospects for global 

growth and stability. The international policy 

agenda includes policies: i) to increase private 

and public savings in deficit countries, ii) to 

implement further structural reforms in mature 

economies with relatively low potential growth, 

as well as in emerging market economies with 

a need to increase domestic absorption and 

improve the allocation of capital, and iii) to 

foster exchange rate flexibility in major 

countries and regions that lack such flexibility. 

Although several developments and policy 

measures went in the right direction in 2006, 

including the fact that the Chinese renminbi 

was allowed greater intraday volatility from the 

beginning of the year, further adjustments are 

needed if global imbalances are to be 

significantly reduced. 
Finally, the euro area itself is subject to 
international policy surveillance exercises. 

Both the IMF and the OECD™s Economic and 

Development Review Committee conducted 

their regular reviews of the euro area, as a 

complement to their reviews of the individual 

euro area countries. The reviews examined the 

monetary, financial and economic policies of 

the euro area. The Article IV consultations of 

the IMF and the review by the OECD™s 

Economic and Development Review Committee 

provided an opportunity for useful discussions 

between these international organisations and 

the ECB, the Eurogroup presidency and the 

European Commission. Following these 
5 2006 estimates in this section are based on the projections 
contained in the IMF™s September 2006 ﬁWorld Economic 
Outlookﬂ.6 Expressed as a percentage of world GDP, the corresponding 
figures for 2006, based on IMF data, were a deficit of around 

1.8% for the United States, and surpluses of about 0.4% for 

China, 0.35% for Japan, 0.2% for the group of ﬁother Asian 

emerging countriesﬂ and 1.2% for the oil-exporting countries.
160ECB Annual Report
2006discussions, both the IMF and the OECD 
produced a report assessing the euro area 

policies.7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE
The IMF is making progress in its work on a 

strategic review which aims to set medium-
term priorities and improve the efficiency of 

the Fund™s operational instruments. The ESCB 

is monitoring and contributing to the ongoing 

discussions which take place not only within 

the IMF itself, but also in various international 

fora, such as the G7 and the G20. Important 

areas covered in the review include IMF 

surveillance, the IMF™s role in emerging market 

economies, and governance issues such as 

quotas and voice in the IMF.  
The reform of the IMF™s surveillance framework 
is taking shape. There is broad agreement 

among the Fund™s members that surveillance 

should cover financial and capital market issues 

in more detail. In addition, placing greater 

emphasis on multilateral issues and international 

spillovers from national policy measures has 

been identified as an important step for the 

future. In June 2006 the IMF launched a new 

process, the multilateral consultation, to provide 

a forum for debate among parties to a common 

economic issue characterised by linkages 

among these parties and other economies. 

Supplementing the IMF™s bilateral surveillance, 

the first multilateral consultation focuses on the 

implementation of policies to unwind global 

imbalances in an orderly fashion while 

sustaining global growth. The five parties to the 

consultation are the United States, Japan, 

China, Saudi Arabia and the euro area, with the 

latter being represented by the Eurogroup 

presidency, the European Commission and the 

ECB. In addition, to improve the effectiveness 

of surveillance, IMF members continue to 

reflect on whether the legal underpinnings of 

Fund surveillance should be amended. Finally, 

discussions are proceeding on how exchange 

rate issues should be treated in the context of 

the IMF™s surveillance activities. 
As concerns the role of the IMF in emerging 

market countries, the Fund™s members are 

discussing the establishment of a new liquidity 

instrument, and its design features, for countries 

that have access to international capital markets 

and pursue strong economic policies. 
Progress has also been made with regard to 
strengthening IMF governance, a subject that 

has been widely discussed over the past year. 

The aim is to ensure a fair and adequate voice 

for all members of the IMF. More specifically, 

the distribution of quotas should be 

commensurate with countries™ relative positions 

in the world economy, and the voice of 

developing and transition countries should be 

enhanced. At its Annual Meetings in September 

2006, the IMF™s members agreed on an ad hoc 

increase in the quotas of four countries (China, 

Korea, Mexico and Turkey). Work will continue 

on the issue of quotas and voice, including on a 

new quota formula, a second round of ad hoc 

increases in quotas Œ to be based on the new 

formula Œ for a broader range of countries, and 

an increase in basic votes so as to enhance the 

voice and participation of low-income and 

transition countries in the IMF. This set of 

reforms is to be completed no later than the 

2008 Annual Meetings. With respect to the 

IMF™s finances, in May 2006 the Managing 

Director appointed a committee to make specific 

recommendations for the sustainable long-term 

financing of the IMF™s running costs in the face 

of sharply declining lending-based income and 

the structural shortcomings of the current 

financing model. The committee presented its 

findings in the first quarter of 2007. 
Finally, the promotion of crisis prevention and 
orderly crisis resolution has been on the agenda 

of the international community for several 

years. The Principles for stable capital flows

consultationﬂ, IMF, June 2006, and ﬁEconomic survey of the

need to accelerate the pace of structural reform in the euro 

area. 
161ECB Annual Report
2006and fair debt restructuring in emerging markets, 
which were endorsed by the G20 in 2004, are 

gaining international support, with ongoing 

work now focusing on implementation issues. 

The aim of these market-based and voluntary 

principles is to provide guidelines for the 

behaviour of sovereign issuers and their private 

creditors regarding information-sharing, 

dialogue and close cooperation. To date, over 

30 issuing countries have voiced support for the 

principles and expressed particular interest in 

advancing their implementation. On the investor 

side, an increasing number of financial 

institutions have backed the principles. These 

ongoing efforts were welcomed by the G20 

finance ministers and central bank governors at 

their meeting in Melbourne on 19 November 

2006. The process of implementing the 

principles is based on the work of the Principles 

Consultative Group, which consists of senior 

finance and central bank officials from emerging 

markets and senior representatives of the private 

financial community. A Group of Trustees, 

comprising senior leaders in global finance, 

was established to guide the implementation 

and evolution of the principles. At its inaugural 

meeting in Singapore in September 2006, the 

Group of Trustees focused its discussions on a 

review of the principles and their implementation 

within the framework of the international 

financial architecture. 
2.2 COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES OUTSIDE 
THE EUAs part of its international activities, the 

Eurosystem continued to develop its contacts 

within the central banking community outside 

the EU, mainly through the organisation of 

seminars and workshops. The objective of such 

contacts is to gather information and exchange 

views on economic and monetary developments 

in different regions of the world with a potential 

bearing on the global economic environment 

and the euro area. In this context, technical 

cooperation has become an important tool in 

supporting institution-building, strengthening 

capacity and enhancing effective compliance 
with European and international standards. The 

Eurosystem has deepened cooperation with 

central banks in its neighbouring regions, and 

the ECB assigns a small number of staff to the 

task of coordinating Eurosystem technical 

assistance. 
The Eurosystem held its third bilateral high-level seminar with the Central Bank of the 

Russian Federation (Bank of Russia) in October 

2006 in Dresden, which was jointly organised 

by the Deutsche Bundesbank and the ECB. The 

purpose of the seminar was to strengthen 

dialogue and enhance relations between the 

Bank of Russia and the Eurosystem, which have 

intensified over recent years. Seminar 

participants exchanged views on the current 

challenges for monetary and exchange rate 

policy in Russia, as well as on the role of fiscal 

rules in the euro area and Russia, and discussed 

long-term growth prospects for the Russian 

economy. Similar events will continue to be 

organised on a regular basis, with the next 

seminar to be held in Moscow in autumn 

2007. 
The third high-level Eurosystem seminar with 
governors of central banks of the EU™s Euro-

Mediterranean partners took place in Nafplion 

on 25 January 2006, while the fourth will be 
162ECB Annual Report
2006held in Valencia on 28 March 2007. Discussions 
in Nafplion focused on, among other things, the 

capital account liberalisation process and 

progress in the modernisation of monetary 

policy operational frameworks. The third high-

level Eurosystem seminar with Latin American 

central banks took place on 4 December 2006 

in Madrid. The main topics discussed were the 

monetary and financial implications of 

globalisation, monetary policy management 

and foreign exchange reserve accumulation. 

Finally, the third high-level Eurosystem seminar 

with central banks in the East Asia-Pacific 

region took place in Sydney on 21 November 

2006, focusing, among other things, on global 

imbalances and financial stability, as well as 

regional financial integration. 
On 1 February 2007 the Eurosystem held a 
high-level seminar with the central banks of 

western and central Africa
8 in Paris, which was 
jointly organised by the Banque de France and 

the ECB. The seminar provided a fruitful 

platform for the discussion of experiences with 

regional economic and monetary integration, 

the impact of commodity price developments 

on monetary and fiscal policies in the region 

and issues of central bank governance. 
The ECB, together with four NCBs (the 
Deutsche Bundesbank, the Bank of Greece, the 

Banque de France and the Banca d™Italia), 

continued its cooperation with the Central Bank 

of Egypt through a technical assistance 

programme which is funded by the EU through 

its framework for Mediterranean aid (MEDA). 

The programme was launched on 1 December 

2005 with an horizon of two years and aims to 

support the Central Bank of Egypt™s 

comprehensive banking supervision reform. 

The programme has focused on the introduction 

of new procedures and tools for banking 

supervision, which are being jointly developed 

and implemented by the Eurosystem and the 

Central Bank of Egypt. It also aims to develop 

the Central Bank of Egypt™s capabilities in the 

area of macro-prudential supervision, regulation 

and training. In addition, the ECB seconded an 

expert to the Central Bank of Egypt, who, under 
the aegis of the IMF, helped to reform the 

monetary policy operational framework. 
The ECB continued to deepen its relations with 
countries in the western Balkans. An ECB 

conference on ﬁMonetary policy and financial 

stability in south-east Europeﬂ took place in 

Frankfurt on 10-11 April 2006. The conference 

was attended by senior central bank experts 

from all south-eastern European countries, as 

well as by representatives from the European 

Commission, international organisations and 

academia. 
On 16 February 2007 the ECB, on its own 
behalf and on the behalf of eight partner NCBs 

(the Deutsche Bundesbank, Eesti Pank, the 

Bank of Greece, the Banco de España, the 

Banque de France, the Banca d™Italia, the 

Oesterreichische Nationalbank and Banka 

Slovenije), signed a tripartite protocol with the 

Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 

the Delegation of the European Commission to 

Bosnia and Herzegovina, paving the way for 

closer cooperation between the parties. Over a 

period of six months from March 2007, the 

ECB and its eight partners will carry out a needs 

assessment to identify areas where the Central 

Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina will need to 

make progress over the coming years in order 

to advance operational preparations for the 

implementation of standards in line with 

those adopted by the ESCB. The needs 

assessment programme is funded by the 

European Commission through the Community 

Assistance for Reconstruction, Development 

and Stabilisation programme (CARDS) and 

coordinated by the ECB. 
8 The seminar was attended by representatives from the central 
banks of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
the Gambia, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, São Tomé and 

Príncipe, Sierra Leone, the Central Bank of West African States 

(the central bank of the monetary union comprising Benin, 

Burkina Faso, Côte d™Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, 

Senegal and Togo) and the Central Bank of Central African 

States (the central bank of the monetary union comprising 

Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, 

Equatorial Guinea and Gabon). 
163ECB Annual Report
2006Albania signed a Stabilisation and Association 
Agreement with the EU in June 2006, following 

the completion of negotiations that started in 

2003. The ECB participated, together with 

other international institutions and central 

banks, in a dialogue with the Bank of Albania 

on how best to introduce an inflation-targeting 

strategy for monetary policy. 
In February 2006 the Cooperation Council for 
the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC), whose 

members are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, 

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, 

approached the ECB with a request for 

assistance with regard to the establishment of a 

monetary union among the GCC Member 

States, including the creation of an appropriate 

institutional framework. The ECB agreed to 

this request and delivered a staff document 

identifying the main legal and operational 

features to be considered by the relevant 

authorities in the GCC when developing an 

institutional framework for a monetary union. 
CHAPTER 6ACCOUNTABILITY 
166ECB Annual Report
20061 ACCOUNTABILITY VIS-À-VIS THE GENERAL PUBLIC 
AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
For an independent central bank, accountability 
is widely understood as the obligation to explain 

and justify its decisions to citizens and their 

elected representatives, thus enabling them to 

hold the central bank responsible for achieving 

its objectives. As such, it is an important 

counterpart to central bank independence. 
The ECB has always fully acknowledged the 
fundamental importance of being accountable 

for its policy decisions and to this end has 

maintained a regular dialogue with EU citizens 

and the European Parliament. The ECB exceeds 

the statutory reporting requirements which are 

laid down in the Treaty, for instance by 

publishing a Monthly Bulletin rather than the 

required quarterly report. It also holds a press 

conference following the first Governing 

Council meeting of the month. The ECB™s 

commitment to the principle of accountability 

is further illustrated by the numerous ECB 

publications released and the large number of 

speeches delivered by the members of the 

Governing Council during 2006, explaining the 

ECB™s policy decisions. 
At the institutional level, the European 
Parliament Œ as the body which derives its 

legitimacy directly from the citizens of the EU 

Œ plays a key role in holding the ECB to account. 

In line with the provisions of Article 113 of the 

Treaty, the President presented the ECB™s 

Annual Report 2005 to the plenary session of 

the European Parliament in 2006. In addition, 

the President continued to report regularly 

on the ECB™s monetary policy and its other 

tasks during his quarterly hearings before the 

Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. 

The President was also invited to a hearing 

at the European Parliament to explain the role 

of the ECB in the oversight of SWIFT (see 

Section 2 of this chapter). 
Other members of the Executive Board were 
also invited to appear before the European 

Parliament on a number of occasions. The Vice-

President presented the ECB™s Annual Report 

2005 to the Committee on Economic and 

Monetary Affairs. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell 
appeared twice before the Committee to explain 

the ECB™s views on payment systems issues 

and on recent developments in the field of 

securities clearing and settlement. 
As in previous years, a delegation of the 
Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs 

visited the ECB to exchange views with the 

members of the Executive Board on a number 

of issues. The ECB also continued its voluntary 

practice of replying to written questions from 

members of the European Parliament on issues 

related to the ECB™s fields of competence. 
Article 112 of the Treaty states that the European 
Parliament must give its opinion on nominees 

to the Executive Board prior to their 

appointment. To this end, the Parliament invited 

Jürgen Stark to appear before the Committee on 

Economic and Monetary Affairs to present his 

views and answer questions from Committee 

members. Following this hearing, the Parliament 

endorsed his appointment. 
167ECB Annual Report
2006During the various exchanges of views between 
the European Parliament and the ECB, a wide 

range of issues were addressed. The key issues 

raised by the European Parliament during these 

exchanges of views are outlined below. 
THE CONTRIBUTION OF MONETARY POLICY 

TO THE GENERAL ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE 

COMMUNITYThe contribution of monetary policy to the 

general economic policies of the Community 

was one of the issues raised during the 

President™s  appearances before the European 

Parliament. The President pointed out that price 

stability was both a precondition for and a 

means to enhance sustainable economic growth 

and welfare. By credibly pursuing price stability 

and by solidly anchoring inflation expectations, 

the ECB was making the best possible 

contribution to creating an environment 

conducive to economic growth and employment. 

In its Resolution on the ECB™s Annual Report 

2005, the European Parliament commended the 

ECB for concentrating on the maintenance of 

price stability and urged it to continue its policy 

of solidly anchoring inflation expectations at 

levels consistent with price stability. 
INFLATION AND OUTPUT GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS 

BETWEEN EURO AREA COUNTRIES
The members of the European Parliament 

addressed the inflation and output growth 

differentials between euro area countries. In its 

Resolution on the ECB™s Annual Report 2005, 

the European Parliament considered that these 

differentials ﬁconstitute a major threat to the 

EMU in the long termﬂ. 
The President explained that the existing 
inflation and output growth differentials 

between euro area countries remained moderate, 

and were not unusual when compared with 

those of other large currency areas. The 

differentials may have been the result of 

catching-up processes, differences in 

demographic trends, or ongoing adjustments 

leading to a more efficient allocation of 

resources. However, the persistence of inflation 

and growth differentials over longer periods of 
time, if induced by structural rigidities or 

misaligned policies, may indeed be worrisome. 

Against this background, the President stressed 

the need for appropriate structural reforms and 

expressed his support for governments that 

were embarking on such reforms (see Box 5). 
FINANCIAL INTEGRATION AND REGULATION
The European Parliament and the ECB also 

continued their close dialogue on matters 

concerning financial integration and stability. 

The Parliament placed particular importance on 

the strong growth of the hedge fund industry. In 

its Resolution on the ECB™s Annual Report 

2005, the Parliament expressed its concerns in 

this regard and called upon the ECB to deepen 

its analysis in this area. 
The President recalled the beneficial role of 
hedge funds in enhancing market liquidity and 

fostering financial innovation. At the same 

time, he noted the potential risks for financial 

stability stemming from their very rapidly 

growing presence in the financial system (see 

Section 1 of Chapter 4), and the consequent 

intention of public authorities, including the 

ECB, to continue monitoring developments 

closely. He also explained that any improvements 

to the existing regulatory framework would 

need to be agreed at the international level. 
The ECB also informed the European Parliament 
about the ongoing activities in the field of 

payment systems and securities clearing and 

settlement systems, including the progress 

made in the development of TARGET2. 

Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell appeared before the 

Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs 

to explain the ECB™s views on the proposed 

directive on payment services in the Internal 

Market, the creation of a Single Euro Payments 

Area (SEPA), and the standards on securities 

clearing and settlement jointly developed by 

the ESCB and the Committee of European 

Securities Regulators. She also informed the 

Parliament about the possible establishment 

of a Eurosystem infrastructure for the provision 

of securities settlement services in central 

bank money, called TARGET2-Securities. The 
2 SELECTED TOPICS RAISED AT MEETINGS WITH 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
168ECB Annual Report
2006European Parliament expressed its support for 
the implementation of TARGET2 and the SEPA. 

The Parliament also took note of the possible 

creation of a TARGET2-Securities system and 

called upon the ECB to establish a proper 

governance framework prior to the introduction 

of such a system. 
THE ROLE OF THE ECB IN THE OVERSIGHT 

OF SWIFTOn 6 July 2006 the European Parliament 

adopted a ﬁResolution on the interception of 

bank transfer data from the SWIFT system by 

the US secret servicesﬂ in which it called upon 

the European Commission, the EU Council and 

the ECB to explain the extent to which they 

were aware of any agreement between SWIFT 

and the US government. On 4 October 2006 the 

President of the ECB was invited to a public 

hearing organised by the Parliament on this 

issue. The President explained that SWIFT was 

neither a credit institution nor a payment 

system. However, in view of the systemic 

importance of SWIFT as a global financial 

messaging system, the G10 central banks 

and the ECB had decided Œ with SWIFT™s 

agreement Œ to set up an Oversight Group (see 

Section 4.1 of Chapter 4). The mandate of this 

Oversight Group is to ensure that SWIFT has an 

appropriate governance framework in place to 

avoid systemic risks. It monitors SWIFT™s 

activities only insofar as they are relevant to the 

smooth functioning of payment systems and 

financial stability. The Oversight Group has no 

authority to supervise SWIFT with regard to 

compliance with data protection laws, which 

lies within the competence of data protection 

authorities. The Oversight Group was made 

aware of the US Terrorist Finance Tracking 
Program relating to SWIFT. It was also informed 

that SWIFT had obtained proper US and EU 

legal advice. The Oversight Group considered 

that SWIFT™s compliance with the US subpoenas 

would not have financial stability implications, 

and thus fell outside the remit of its oversight 

role. Moreover, as the ECB is subject to a strict 

confidentiality regime, it is not allowed to use 

the information it receives in the context of the 

oversight framework for other purposes, or to 

share such information with data protection or 

law enforcement authorities. 
CHAPTER 7EXTERNAL 
COMMUNICATION 
172ECB Annual Report
20061 COMMUNICATION POLICY 
Communication at the ECB aims to enhance the 
public™s understanding of the ECB™s decisions. 

It is an integral part of the ECB™s monetary 

policy and of its other tasks. Two key elements 

Œ openness and transparency Œ guide the ECB™s 

communication activities. Both contribute to 

the effectiveness, efficiency and credibility of 

the ECB™s monetary policy. They also support 

the ECB™s efforts to give full account of its 

actions, as explained in more detail in 

Chapter 6. 
The concept of real-time, regular and 
comprehensive explanations of the monetary 

policy assessment and decisions, which was 

introduced in 1999, represents a uniquely open 

and transparent approach to central bank 

communication. Monetary policy decisions are 

explained at a press conference immediately 

after the Governing Council has taken them. 

The President delivers a detailed introductory 

statement at the press conference, explaining 

the Governing Council™s decisions. The 

President and the Vice-President are then at the 

media™s disposal to answer questions. Since 

December 2004 decisions taken by the 

Governing Council other than those setting 

interest rates have also been published every 

month on the websites of the Eurosystem central 

banks. 
The ECB™s legal acts are made available in all 
official languages of the EU, as are the 

consolidated financial statements of the 

Eurosystem.1 The ECB™s other statutory 
publications Œ the Annual Report, the quarterly 

issue of the Monthly Bulletin and the 

Convergence Report
2 Œ are also made available 
in the official EU languages.
3 For the purposes 
of public accountability and transparency, 

the ECB also publishes other documentation in 

all official languages, in particular press 

releases on monetary policy decisions, staff 

macroeconomic projections and policy positions 

of relevance to the general public. The 

preparation, publication and distribution of 
the national language versions of the ECB™s 

key publications are undertaken in close 

collaboration with the NCBs. 
1 A derogation is in effect for Irish.
2 In the case of the Convergence Report, only the introduction and 
the executive summary are available in all languages. 
3 The temporary derogation applying to Maltese will be lifted in 
May 2007.173ECB Annual Report
20062 COMMUNICATION 
ACTIVITIESThe ECB needs to address a variety of audiences, 
such as financial experts, the media, 

governments, parliaments and the general 

public, with varying levels of knowledge of 

finance and economics. Its mandate and 

decisions are therefore explained through a 

range of communication tools and activities 

which are constantly being refined in order to 

make them as effective as possible. 
The ECB publishes a number of studies and 
reports, such as the Annual Report, which 

presents a review of the ECB™s activities in the 

previous year and thus helps to hold the ECB 

accountable for its actions. The Monthly 

Bulletin provides regular updates of the ECB™s 

assessment of economic and monetary 

developments and the detailed information 

underlying its decisions, while the Financial 

Stability Review assesses the stability of the 

euro area financial system with regard to its 

ability to absorb adverse shocks. 
In order to strengthen the Eurosystem™s identity 
and its public perception, the Governing 

Council in 2006 approved the implementation 

of a common Eurosystem signature in line with 

the Eurosystem mission statement4. By January 
2007 the ECB and all the euro area NCBs had 

incorporated the word ﬁEurosystemﬂ into their 

corporate logo. 
All members of the Governing Council directly 
contribute to enhancing public knowledge and 

understanding of the Eurosystem™s tasks and 

policies by giving testimonies before the 

European Parliament and national parliaments, 

delivering public speeches and granting 

interviews to the media. In 2006 the President 

of the ECB appeared six times before the 

European Parliament. The members of the 

Executive Board delivered around 200 speeches 

in 2006 and granted numerous interviews, as 

well as having articles published in journals, 

magazines and newspapers. 
The euro area NCBs play an important role in 
ensuring the dissemination at the national level 

of Eurosystem information and messages to the 
general public and interested parties. They 

address a variety of national and regional 

audiences in their own languages and 

environments. 
The ECB contributes to the dissemination of 
research findings by publishing Working Papers 

and Occasional Papers and by organising 

academic conferences, seminars and workshops. 

In 2006 the Fourth ECB Central Banking 

Conference was held. The conference brought 

together central bankers, academics, market 

participants and the media from all over the 

world to debate on ﬁThe role of money: money 

and monetary policy in the twenty-first centuryﬂ 

(see Section 5.2 of Chapter 2). 
In 2006 the ECB, in cooperation with Banka 
Slovenije, organised an information campaign 

in preparation for the introduction of the euro 

in Slovenia on 1 January 2007. The information 

campaign, which was similar to that organised 

for the first euro cash changeover in 2002, 

aimed to familiarise cash handlers and the 

general public with the visual appearance and 

security features of the euro banknotes and 

coins, as well as with the cash changeover 

procedures (see Chapter 3). 
The ECB welcomed around 10,000 visitors to 
its premises in Frankfurt in 2006. The visitors 

received first-hand information in the form of 

lectures and presentations given by ECB staff. 

University students and professionals from the 

financial sector made up the majority of 

visitors. 
All documents published by the ECB and its 
various activities are presented on the ECB™s 

website. Around 90,000 public enquiries 

involving requests for information on different 
4 The mission statement was published on 5 January 2005.
174ECB Annual Report
2006aspects of the ECB™s activities were handled in 
2006. 
The ECB holds an annual Cultural Days 
programme which aims to bring the cultural 

diversity of the EU Member States closer to the 

public as well as to the ECB™s and Eurosystem™s 

own employees. Each year this initiative 

highlights the richness of the culture of one EU 

country, thus fostering a better understanding 

of the nations in the EU. In 2006 the Cultural 

Days programme focused on Austria, following

CHAPTER 8INSTITUTIONALFRAMEWORK,
ORGANISATION AND
ANNUAL ACCOUNTS
179ECB Annual Report
2006The Eurosystem is the central banking system 
of the euro area. It comprises the ECB and the 

NCBs of the EU Member States whose currency 

is the euro (13 since 1 January 2007). The 

Governing Council adopted the term 

ﬁEurosystemﬂ in order to facilitate understanding 

of the structure of central banking in the euro 

area. The term underlines the shared identity, 

teamwork and cooperation of all of its 

members. 
The ESCB is composed of the ECB and the 
NCBs of all EU Member States (27 since 

1 January 2007), i.e. it includes the NCBs of 

the Member States which have not yet adopted 

the euro. 
The ECB is the core of the Eurosystem and the 

ESCB and ensures that their respective tasks 

are carried out either through its own activities 

or via the NCBs. It has legal personality under 

public international law. 
Each NCB has legal personality according to 
the law of its respective country. The euro area 

NCBs, which form an integral part of the 

Eurosystem, carry out the tasks conferred upon 

the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules 

established by the ECB™s decision-making 

bodies. The NCBs also contribute to the work 

of the Eurosystem and the ESCB through 

their participation in the Eurosystem/ESCB 

committees (see Section 1.5 of this chapter). 

They may perform non-Eurosystem functions 

on their own responsibility, unless the

GOVERNANCE OF THE ECB
1.1 THE EUROSYSTEM AND THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF CENTRAL BANKS
180ECB Annual Report
2006Governing Council finds that such functions 
interfere with the objectives and tasks of the 

Eurosystem. 
The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed by 
the decision-making bodies of the ECB: the 

Governing Council and the Executive Board. 

The General Council is constituted as a third 

decision-making body of the ECB, for as long 

as there are EU Member States which have not 

yet adopted the euro. The functioning of the 

decision-making bodies is governed by the 

Treaty, the Statute of the ESCB and the relevant 

Rules of Procedure1. Decision-making within 
the Eurosystem and the ESCB is centralised. 

However, the ECB and the euro area NCBs 

jointly contribute, strategically and 

operationally, to attaining the common goals of 

the Eurosystem, with due respect to the principle 

of decentralisation in accordance with the 

Statute of the ESCB. 
1.2 THE GOVERNING COUNCIL
The Governing Council comprises the members 

of the Executive Board of the ECB and the 

governors of the NCBs of the Member States 

which have adopted the euro. Its main 

responsibilities, as laid down in the Treaty, 

are:Œ to adopt the guidelines and take the decisions 
necessary to ensure the performance of the 
tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem; 
Œ to formulate the monetary policy of the euro 
area, including, as appropriate, decisions 

relating to intermediate monetary objectives, 

key interest rates and the supply of reserves 

in the Eurosystem, and to establish 

the necessary guidelines for their 

implementation. 
The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twice 

a month at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurt am 

Main, Germany. It conducts, inter alia, an in-

depth assessment of monetary and economic 

developments and takes related decisions 
specifically at its first meeting of the month, 

while the second meeting usually focuses on 

issues related to other tasks and responsibilities 

of the ECB and the Eurosystem. In 2006 two 

meetings were held outside Frankfurt: one was 

hosted by the Banco de España in Madrid and 

the other by the Banque de France in Paris. 
When taking decisions on monetary policy and 
on other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem, 

the members of the Governing Council do not 

act as national representatives, but in a fully 

independent personal capacity. This is reflected 

by the principle of ﬁone member, one voteﬂ 

applied within the Governing Council.

1.3 THE EXECUTIVE BOARD
The Executive Board comprises the President 
and the Vice-President of the ECB and four 

other members appointed by common accord 

by the Heads of State or Government of the 

Member States which have adopted the euro. 

The main responsibilities of the Executive 

Board, which as a rule meets once a week, are:Œ to prepare the meetings of the Governing 
Council;Œ to implement the monetary policy of the 
euro area in accordance with the guidelines 
and decisions laid down by the Governing 
Council and, in doing so, to give the 

necessary instructions to the euro area 

NCBs;Œ to manage the current business of the ECB;

Œ to exercise certain powers delegated to it by 
the Governing Council, including some of a 

regulatory nature. 
The Executive Board is assisted by a 

Management Committee in matters relating to 

the ECB™s management, business planning and 

annual budget process. The Management 

Committee is composed of one Executive Board 

member, who acts as Chairman, and a number 

of senior managers.

for the photograph1.4 THE GENERAL COUNCIL
The General Council is composed of the 
President and the Vice-President of the ECB 

and the governors of the NCBs of all EU 

Member States. It mainly carries out those tasks 

taken over from the EMI which still have to be 

performed by the ECB on account of the fact 

that not all the Member States have adopted the 
euro. In 2006 the General Council met six 

times. Since January 2007 the governors of 


 
 
 (Bulgarian National 
Bank) and Banca Naional a României have 
been members of the General Council. 

Following the signing of the Accession Treaty 

in April 2005, they had attended the meetings 

of the General Council in an observer 

capacity.

Human Resources Conference (HRC)
Koenraad De GeestThe Eurosystem/ESCB committees have 
continued to play an important role in assisting 

the ECB™s decision-making bodies in the 

performance of their tasks. At the request of 

both the Governing Council and the Executive 

Board, the committees have provided expertise 

in their fields of competence and have facilitated 

the decision-making process. Membership of 

the committees is usually restricted to staff of 

the Eurosystem central banks. However, the 

NCBs of the Member States which have not yet 

adopted the euro take part in the meetings of a 

committee whenever it deals with matters that 

fall within the field of competence of the 

General Council. Where appropriate, other 

competent bodies, such as national supervisory 

authorities in the case of the Banking 

Supervision Committee, may also be invited. 

At present there are 12 Eurosystem/ESCB 

committees, all of which were established under 
Article 9 of the Rules of Procedure of the 

ECB. 
The Budget Committee, which was established 
under Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure, 

assists the Governing Council in matters related 

to the ECB™s budget. The Human Resources 

Conference was established in 2005 under 

Article 9a of the Rules of Procedure as a forum 

for the exchange of experience, expertise and 

information among Eurosystem/ESCB central 

banks in the field of human resources 

management. 
1.6 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
In addition to the decision-making bodies, the 

corporate governance of the ECB encompasses 

a number of external and internal control layers, 
186ECB Annual Report
2006three codes of conduct and rules concerning 
public access to ECB documents. 
EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERS
The Statute of the ESCB provides for two 

layers, namely the external auditor, which is 

appointed to audit the annual accounts of the 

ECB (Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB), 

and the European Court of Auditors, which 

examines the operational efficiency of the 

management of the ECB (Article 27.2). The 

annual report of the European Court of 

Auditors, together with the ECB™s reply, is 

published on the ECB™s website and in the 

Official Journal of the European Union. In 

order to reinforce public assurance as to the 

independence of the ECB™s external auditor, the 

principle of audit firm rotation is applied.3INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERS
The internal control structure of the ECB is 

based on a functional approach. Each 

organisational unit (section, division, directorate 

or directorate general) is responsible for its 

own internal control and efficiency. In this 

respect, organisational units implement 

operational control procedures within their area 

of responsibility and determine the acceptable 

level of risk. For example, a set of rules and 

procedures Œ known as a Chinese wall Œ is in 

place to prevent inside information originating 

in the areas responsible for monetary policy 

from reaching the areas responsible for the 

management of the ECB™s foreign reserves and 

own funds portfolio. In addition to the controls 

implemented by each organisational unit, 

different divisions within the Directorate 

General Human Resources, Budget and 

Organisation monitor the control process and 

make proposals to improve the effectiveness of 

risk identification, assessment and mitigation 

in the ECB as a whole. 
Independently from the control structure and 
risk monitoring of the ECB, audit missions are 

performed by the Directorate Internal Audit 

under the responsibility of the Executive Board. 

In accordance with the mandate defined in the 

ECB Audit Charter
4, the ECB™s internal auditors 
evaluate, on an ad hoc basis, the adequacy and 

effectiveness of the ECB™s system of internal 

control as well as the ECB™s performance in 

carrying out assigned responsibilities. The 

ECB™s internal auditors are guided by the 

International Standards for the Professional 

Practice of Internal Auditing and the Code of 

Ethics established by the Institute of Internal 

Auditors. 
A Eurosystem/ESCB committee, the Internal 
Auditors Committee, which is composed of the 

heads of internal audit at the ECB and the 

NCBs, is responsible for the coordination of 

audit coverage for Eurosystem/ESCB joint 

projects and operational systems. 
In order to further strengthen the governance 
framework of the ECB and the Eurosystem, the 

Governing Council decided to create an ECB 

Audit Committee as of April 2007 which will 

be composed of three of its members.CODES OF CONDUCTThere are three codes of conduct in place at the 

ECB. The first is for the members of the 

Governing Council and reflects their 

responsibility to safeguard the integrity and 

reputation of the Eurosystem and to maintain 

the effectiveness of its operations.
5 It gives 
guidance to, and sets ethical standards for, the 

members of the Governing Council and their 

alternates when exercising their functions as 

members of the Governing Council. An adviser 

has also been appointed by the Governing 

Council to provide guidance to its members on 

some aspects of professional conduct. The 

second code is the Code of Conduct of the ECB, 

which gives guidance to, and sets benchmarks 
3 Following a tender procedure in 2002, KPMG Deutsche 
Treuhand-Gesellschaft AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft 
was appointed as the ECB™s external auditor with a five-year 

mandate covering financial years 2003 to 2007.4 This Charter is published on the ECB™s website to foster the 
transparency of audit arrangements in place at the ECB.5 See the Code of Conduct for the members of the Governing 
Council, OJ C 123, 24.5.2002, p. 9, its amendment, OJ C 10, 

16.1.2007, p. 6, and the ECB™s website.
187ECB Annual Report
2006for, the staff of the ECB and the members of the 
Executive Board, all of whom are expected to 

maintain high standards of professional ethics 

in the performance of their duties.6 In accordance 
with the Code of Conduct™s rules against insider 

trading, the ECB™s staff and the members 

of the Executive Board are prohibited from 

taking advantage of inside information when 

conducting private financial activities at their 

own risk and for their own account, or at the 

risk and for the account of a third party.
7 The 
third code is a Supplementary Code of Ethical 

Criteria for the members of the Executive 

Board.8 It complements the other two codes by 
further detailing the ethical regime applicable 

to members of the Executive Board. An Ethics 

Adviser appointed by the Executive Board 

ensures a consistent interpretation of these 

rules. 
ANTI-FRAUD MEASURESIn 1999 the European Parliament and the EU 

Council adopted a regulation9 to step up the 
fight against fraud, corruption and any other 

illegal activity detrimental to the Communities™ 

financial interests. The regulation provides 

inter alia for the internal investigation of 

suspected fraud by the European Anti-Fraud 

Office (OLAF) within the Community 

institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. 
The OLAF Regulation foresees that each of the 
latter adopt decisions in order for OLAF to be 

able to carry out its investigations within each 

of them. In June 2004 the Governing Council 

adopted a decision10 concerning the terms and 
conditions for investigations by OLAF of the 

ECB, which entered into force on 1 July 2004. 
PUBLIC ACCESS TO ECB DOCUMENTS
The ECB™s Decision on public access to ECB 

documents11 adopted in March 2004 is in line 
with the objectives and standards applied by 

other Community institutions and bodies with 

regard to public access to their documents. It 

enhances transparency, while at the same time 

taking into account the independence of the 

ECB and of the NCBs and ensuring the 
confidentiality of certain matters specific to the 

performance of the ECB™s tasks.
12In 2006 the number of public access requests 

remained limited. 
6 See the Code of Conduct of the European Central Bank in 
accordance with Article 11.3 of the Rules of Procedure of the 
European Central Bank, OJ C 76, 8.3.2001, p. 12, and the ECB™s 

website.7 See Part 1.2 of the ECB Staff Rules containing the rules on 
professional conduct and professional secrecy, OJ C 92, 

16.4.2004, p. 31, and the ECB™s website.

of the Executive Board, OJ C 230, 23.9.2006, p. 46, and the

a new ﬁArchivesﬂ section was added to the ECB™s website in 

2006, providing access to historical documentation.188ECB Annual Report
20062 ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
2.1 HUMAN RESOURCES 
STAFFING 
The total number of budgeted staff positions for 
2006 was 1,343 full-time equivalent (FTE) 

positions.13 This compares with 1,369.5 FTE 
positions for 2005, a reduction of 26.5 FTE 

positions resulting from the zero-based 

budgeting assessment conducted in 2005. 
All external recruitment to fill permanent 
positions was carried out on the basis of fixed-
term contracts of five years for managerial 

positions and three years for all other positions. 

Fixed-term contracts offered for permanent 

positions may be converted into unlimited 

contracts, subject to a review procedure that 

takes into account organisational considerations 

and individual performance. 
In 2006 the ECB offered 99 short-term contracts 
of less than one year (as compared with 106 in 

2005) in order to fill temporary staffing needs 

(replacement for staff on maternity, parental or 

unpaid leave, for example). 
The ECB also offered 93 short-term contracts 
to experts from NCBs (including 
 
 
 (Bulgarian National Bank) and 
Banca Naional a României), other EU 
institutions and international organisations. 

This compares with 80 such contracts in 2005. 

Such short-term assignments provide an 

opportunity for ECB and NCB staff to gain 

from each other™s experience, thus fostering an 

ESCB-wide team spirit. They also continued to 

contribute to the integration of 
 
 
 (Bulgarian National Bank) and 
Banca Naional a României into the ESCB. 
In September 2006 the first six participants in 

the ECB™s Graduate Programme, which is aimed 

at recent graduates with a broad educational 

background, joined the Bank on the basis of 

two-year non-convertible contracts. 
The ECB also offered internship opportunities 
to students and graduates with backgrounds in 

economics, statistics, business administration, 
law and translation. 173 internships were 

provided across the ECB in 2006. 
The ECB also offered two fellowships as part 
of the Wim Duisenberg Research Fellowship 

Programme, which is open to leading 

economists, and five fellowships to young 

researchers in the context of its Lamfalussy 

Fellowship programme. 
INTERNAL MOBILITYInternal mobility represents an opportunity for 

staff to broaden their expertise and a means to 

increase synergies across business areas. In this 

respect, the internal recruitment policy, which 

places emphasis on broad competencies, aims 

to further facilitate internal staff mobility. Other 

initiatives, such as exchanges between staff and 

temporary internal transfers to cover for the 

absence of colleagues, also support internal 

mobility. In 2006 more than 80 members of 

staff, including 15 managers and advisers, 

moved internally to other positions, either on a 

temporary or on a long-term basis. 
In 2006 the ECB introduced general principles 
for mobility, which encourage members of staff 

to change position after every five years of 

service. 
EXTERNAL MOBILITYThe ECB™s external work experience scheme 

facilitates the secondment of staff to the 

27 NCBs or to relevant international financial 

institutions (e.g. the IMF and the BIS) for 

periods of two to twelve months. 24 members 

of staff were seconded under the scheme in 

2006. In addition, the ECB granted unpaid 

leave, for up to three years, to 29 members of 

staff who took up employment at NCBs, EU 

institutions or international organisations. 
13 The actual number of FTE positions as at 31 December 2006 
was 1,367. This discrepancy was mainly due to the fact that 
fixed-term contracts were awarded to replace staff members 

who were absent for a period of more than 12 months, and to the 

existence at the end of the year of a small restructuring surplus 

resulting from the zero-based budgeting exercise. 
189ECB Annual Report
2006DIVERSITY STRATEGY
With staff from the 27 EU Member States, the 
ECB has integrated diversity management into 

its human resources practices to ensure that the 

individual competencies of staff are recognised 

and fully utilised in achieving the ECB™s 

objectives. The diversity policy initiated by the 

ECB in 2005 was officially launched in 2006. 

The management of diversity at the ECB seeks 

to ensure that all members of staff are treated 

with respect and that they are managed on the 

basis of merit. 
STRENGTHENING HUMAN RESOURCES 
In addition to promoting mobility, including 

managerial rotation, the human resources (HR) 

strategy continues to focus on the development 

of ECB management. Managerial and leadership 

skills continued to be strengthened through 

training and individual coaching. Training for 

managers concentrated on the enhancement of 

leadership skills, performance management and 

leading organisational change. Following the 

launch of the ECB diversity strategy in 2006, a 

specific training course for managers on 

ﬁdignity at workﬂ was implemented. 
In addition, managers participated in an annual 
mandatory multi-source feedback exercise in 

which direct reports, peers and external contacts 

identify areas for managers™ personal 

development. This feeds into the managers™ 

annual performance assessment. Individual 

coaching is provided based on the results of the 

multi-source feedback. 
In 2006 the ECB introduced an Advisory 
Positions Framework which provides a parallel 

career structure to the traditional managerial 

structure. The role of an adviser is to provide 

high-level technical or policy expertise, cross-
organisational coordination and/or management 

advice on a wide range of topics. 
The six ECB common values (competence, 
effectiveness and efficiency, integrity, team 

spirit, transparency and accountability, and 

working for Europe) were further embedded in 

the human resources policies in order to translate 
them into day-to-day behaviour and performance. 

HR tools and processes (e.g. performance 

management, recruitment and selection, training 

and development) will continue to be further 

aligned with these values. 
The continuous acquisition and development of 
skills and competencies remains a cornerstone 

of the ECB™s HR strategy. As a basic principle, 

learning and development are a shared 

responsibility between staff and institution. 

The ECB provides the budgetary means and 

training framework, managers define the 

training needs to ensure that staff maintain the 

high level of professional knowledge and skills 

required for their current position, and staff 

have the primary responsibility for learning and 

development. In addition to several in-house 

training opportunities, staff continued to take 

up external training opportunities to address 

individual specific training needs of a more 

ﬁtechnicalﬂ nature. They also benefited from 

training opportunities organised as common 

ESCB programmes or offered by the NCBs. 
The ECB granted unpaid leave for study 
purposes to 10 members of staff and, in the 

context of the Secondary Training Policy, 

provided 14 others with support to acquire 

a qualification that would increase their 

professional competence beyond the 

requirements of their current position. 
THE HUMAN RESOURCES CONFERENCE AND THE 

FOLLOW-UP TO THE EUROSYSTEM MISSION 

STATEMENT
With the aim of further promoting the 

cooperation and team spirit among Eurosystem/
ESCB central banks in the field of human 

resources management, the Governing Council 

established a Human Resources Conference 

(HRC) in 2005, thus formalising the long-
standing cooperation between the heads of 

personnel of the central banks of the EU. 
The HRC™s activities in 2006 covered different 
aspects of staff training and development, 

including opportunities for common training 

activities, career policies, performance appraisal 
190ECB Annual Report
2006systems, secondment policies and selection 
procedures. The HRC™s work in this field will 

extend to developing measures to foster staff 

exchange. 
The HRC also exchanged information on staff 
costs and, together with ECCO, proposed a 

comprehensive framework to address the main 

topics covered by the Eurosystem mission 

statement, the strategic intents and the 

organisational principles in shared Eurosystem/

ESCB staff induction programmes. 
2.2 NEW ECB PREMISES
Progress continued to be made in the planning 

of the ECB™s new premises. Following COOP 

HIMMELB(L)AU™s optimisation of its winning 

design on the basis of the reviewed functional, 

spatial and technical requirements, as well as a 

lower target for building costs, the project 

moved into a planning phase in 2006. This 

phase involves: 
Œ preparing and implementing the necessary 
tender procedures to award service contracts 
to the planners, experts, architects, engineers 
and construction companies that will be 

involved in the planning and construction of 

the premises; 
Œ submitting the plans to the authorities of the 
City of Frankfurt in order to obtain the 

necessary building permits and review all 

plans for compliance with the applicable 

building regulations, e.g. the building code, 

fire protection and health and safety 

standards; 
Œ preparing an updated cost calculation in 
order to confirm the overall cost framework 

(•500 million for building costs and 

•850 million total investment costs, based 

on 2005 prices); 
Œ developing detailed plans for the design 
based on the building specifications and on 

continuous value engineering. 
Accordingly, the architects submitted a 

preliminary design proposal which included 

several adaptations in relation to the optimised 

design. First, the skyscraper and the entrance 
191ECB Annual Report
2006building which will connect the Grossmarkthalle 
to the skyscraper were moved slightly to the 

west, following the specifications of the historic 

preservation authorities. Second, the envisaged 

functions of the Grossmarkthalle were 

reorganised on the basis of historic preservation 

and space requirements. Third, the facade of 

the skyscraper has been made more energy-

efficient by improving the solar protection. The 

landscape design of the site has also been 

redefined and specifies the incorporation of 

security measures. Finally, the top of the 

skyscraper has been changed in shape, with a 

new slanted roof improving the overall shape 

and clarity of the building in its urban context. 
The City of Frankfurt in collaboration with the 
ECB continued to prepare a legally binding 

land use plan for the new premises. In this 

context, various meetings with the city 

authorities were held in the course of the year. 

The process of submitting a request for the 

building permits is expected to be finalised by 

the end of October 2007, as scheduled. 

Construction is envisaged to start in early 2008, 

with finalisation foreseen by the end of 2011. 
A memorial and information space to 
commemorate the Grossmarkthalle™s role in the 

deportation of Jewish citizens will also be 

constructed. A task force consisting of 

representatives of the City of Frankfurt, the 

Frankfurt Jewish Community and the ECB is 

currently preparing an international competition 

for the design of the memorial and information 

space. The competition is expected to be 

launched in 2007.192ECB Annual Report
2006The ESCB Social Dialogue is a consultative 
forum involving the ECB and employee 

representatives from almost all central banks of 

the ESCB and from European trade union 

federations14. Its purpose is to provide 
information and an exchange of views on issues 

that may have a major impact on the employment 

situation at the central banks of the ESCB. 
Meetings of the ESCB Social Dialogue were 
held in June and December 2006. In addition to 

issues relating to banknote production and 

circulation, payment systems (TARGET2) and 

financial supervision, which are topics regularly 

addressed by the Social Dialogue, discussions 

dealt with the implementation of the measures 

related to the Eurosystem mission statement, 

strategic intents and organisational principles 

and with their implications for the day-to-day 

work of Eurosystem staff. The employee 

representatives were also informed of the work 

being carried out by the HRC. 
The ECB continued to issue a biannual 
newsletter to keep employee representatives 

informed of the latest developments with regard 

to the above topics. 
Additional means to enhance the ESCB Social 
Dialogue were discussed at the December 

meeting and agreed between the ECB and the 

European trade union federations. A mechanism 

was established through which employee 

representatives can be informed, at an early 

stage, of the issues to be addressed by the 

Governing Council which are relevant to the 

Social Dialogue. 
At the invitation of the trade union federations, 
the ECB also participated in two seminars on 

industrial relations and corporate culture, which 

were mainly aimed at employee representatives 

from the NCBs of the Member States which 

joined the EU in May 2004 and in January

3 KEY RESOURCES, RISKS AND PROCESSES
GOVERNANCE OF THE ECB
Information relating to the governance of the 
ECB is given in Chapter 8. 
MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD
The members of the Executive Board are 

appointed from among persons of recognised 

standing and professional experience in 

monetary or banking matters by common accord 

of the governments of the Member States at the 

level of the Heads of State or Government, 

upon a recommendation from the EU Council 

after it has consulted the European Parliament 

and the Governing Council. 
The terms and conditions of members™ 
employment are determined by the Governing 

Council, based on a proposal from a Committee 

comprising three members appointed by the 

Governing Council and three members 

appointed by the EU Council.EMPLOYEES
The average number of staff (full-time 

equivalent) employed on permanent or fixed-
term contracts by the ECB rose from 1,331 in 

2005 to 1,360 in 2006. At the end of that year 

1,367 staff were employed. For further details, 
see the notes on the Profit and Loss Account 

and Chapter 8, Section 2, which also describes 

the ECB™s human resources strategy.
INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The ECB™s foreign reserves portfolio consists 

of foreign reserve assets transferred to it by the 

euro area NCBs in accordance with the 

provisions of Article 30 of the Statute of the 

European System of Central Banks and of the 

European Central Bank, and the income thereon. 

It serves to fund the ECB™s operations in the 

foreign exchange market for the purposes set 

out in the Treaty.
The ECB™s own funds portfolio reflects the 
investment of its paid-up capital, the counterpart 

of the provision against foreign exchange, 

interest rate and gold price risks, the general 

reserve fund and income accumulated on the 

portfolio in the past. Its purpose is to provide 

the ECB with income to contribute to the 

coverage of its operating expenses.The ECB™s investment activities and its 
management of the associated risks are 

described in greater detail in Chapter 2.THE BUDGET PROCESS
The Budget Committee (BUCOM), composed 

of ECB and euro area NCB experts, is a key 

contributor to the ECB™s financial governance 

process. In accordance with Article 15 of the 

Rules of Procedure, BUCOM supports the 

Governing Council by providing a detailed 

evaluation of annual ECB budget proposals and 

requests for supplementary budget funding by 

the Executive Board, prior to their submission 

to the Governing Council for approval. Spending 

against agreed budgets is monitored regularly 

by the Executive Board, taking into account 

the advice of the ECB™s internal controlling 

function, and by the Governing Council with 

the assistance of BUCOM.195ECB Annual Report
20064 FINANCIAL RESULT 
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTSUnder Article 26.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
the Annual Accounts of the ECB are drawn up 

by the Executive Board, in accordance with 

the principles established by the Governing 

Council. The accounts are then approved by 

the Governing Council and subsequently 

published.PROVISION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, 

INTEREST RATE AND GOLD PRICE RISKS 
Since most of the ECB™s assets and liabilities 

are periodically revalued at current market 

exchange rates and security prices, the ECB™s 

profitability is strongly affected by exchange 

rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, interest 

rate exposures. These exposures stem mainly 

from its holdings of foreign reserve assets held 

in US dollars, Japanese yen and gold, which are 

predominantly invested in interest-bearing 

instruments. 
In 2005, taking into account the ECB™s large 
exposure to these risks and the size of its 

revaluation accounts, the Governing Council 

decided to establish a provision against foreign 

exchange rate, interest rate and gold price risks. 

Consequently, as at 31 December 2005, an 

amount of •992 million was recorded in this 

provision. As at 31 December 2006, an additional 

amount of •1,379 million was recorded, 

increasing its size to •2,371 million and, as in 

2005, reducing net profit to exactly zero. 
This provision will be used to cover realised 
and unrealised losses, in particular valuation 

losses not covered by the revaluation accounts. 

Its size and continuing requirement is reviewed 

annually. 
FINANCIAL RESULT FOR 2006
Had the provision against foreign exchange 

rate, interest rate and gold price risks not been 
increased in 2006, the ECB would have reported 

a net profit of •1,379 million. 
In 2006, the appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis 
the Japanese yen resulted in write-downs 

in the euro value of the ECB™s holdings of 

yen-denominated assets of some •0.6 billion, 

which were expensed in the Profit and Loss 

Account. 
In 2006 net interest income increased to 
•1,972 million from •1,270 in 2005, owing 

mainly to (a) an increase in euro banknotes in 

circulation and in the marginal rate for the 

Eurosystem™s main refinancing operations, 

which determines the remuneration that the 

ECB receives on its share of euro banknotes in 

the Eurosystem; and (b) a rise in US dollar 

interest rates.Net realised gains arising from financial 
operations rose from •149 million in 2005 to 

•475 million in 2006. The depreciation of the 

euro vis-à-vis gold, in conjunction with 

increased volumes of gold sales in 2006, 

resulted in greater realised gains. These sales 

were conducted in accordance with the Central 

Bank Gold Agreement of 27 September 2004, 

of which the ECB is a signatory.
Total administrative expenses of the ECB, 
including depreciation, increased from 

•348 million in 2005 to •361 million in 2006. 
Staff costs rose primarily owing to an increase 
in the average number of staff employed during 

the year and an increased pension charge in 

2006. The emoluments of the Executive Board 

amounted to a total of •2.2 million (2005: 

•2.1 million).196ECB Annual Report

Jean-Claude Trichet
President
199ECB Annual Report
2006ACCOUNTING POLICIES1FORM AND PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
The financial statements of the European 

Central Bank (ECB) have been designed to 

present fairly the financial position of the ECB 

and the results of its operations. They have 

been drawn up in accordance with the following 

accounting policies2, which the Governing 
Council considers to be appropriate to the 

nature of central bank activity. 
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe following accounting principles have been 

applied: economic reality and transparency, 

prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet 

events, materiality, the accruals principle, going 

concern, consistency and comparability.
RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
An asset or liability is only recognised in the 

Balance Sheet when it is probable that any 

associated future economic benefit will flow to 

or from the ECB, substantially all of the 

associated risks and rewards have been 

transferred to the ECB, and the cost or value of 

the asset or the amount of the obligation can be 

measured reliably.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The accounts have been prepared on a historical 

cost basis, modified to include market valuation 

of marketable securities, gold and all other 

on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet assets 

and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. 

Transactions in financial assets and liabilities 

are reflected in the accounts on the basis of the 

date on which they are settled. 
With effect from 1 January 2007, the basis for 
recording foreign exchange transactions, 

financial instruments denominated in foreign 

currency and related accruals in the accounts of 

Eurosystem central banks has changed. Early 

application was permitted, and the ECB 

introduced the change as at 1 October 2006, 
with the following effects. With the exception 

of securities, transactions are now recorded in 

off-balance-sheet accounts on the trade date. 

At settlement date the off-balance-sheet entries 

are reversed and transactions are booked on-
balance-sheet. Purchases and sales of foreign 

currency affect the net foreign currency position 

on the trade date, rather than on the spot 

settlement date as has been the case hitherto, 

and realised results arising from sales are also 

calculated on the trade date. Accrued interest, 

premiums and discounts related to financial 

instruments denominated in foreign currency 

are calculated and booked daily, and the foreign 

currency position is also affected daily by these 

accruals instead of changing only when interest 

cash flows actually occur, as was the case 

previously. Retrospective application of this 

change in accounting policies to earlier periods 

is not practicable. 
GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND 

LIABILITIESAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign 

currency are converted into euro at the exchange 

rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. 

Income and expenses are converted at the 

exchange rate prevailing on the recording date. 

The revaluation of foreign exchange assets 

and liabilities, including on-balance-sheet and 

off-balance-sheet instruments, is performed on 

a currency-by-currency basis.Revaluation to the market price for assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currency is 

treated separately from the exchange rate 

revaluation. 
Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at 
the year-end. No distinction is made between 
1 The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in 
Decision ECB/2002/11, OJ L 58, 3.3.2003, p. 38, as amended. 
With effect from 1 January 2007, this Decision has been 

repealed and replaced by Decision ECB/2006/17, OJ L 348, 

11.12.2006, p. 38.
2 These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 
of the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised 

approach to the rules governing the accounting and financial 

reporting of Eurosystem operations.200ECB Annual Report
2006the price and currency revaluation differences 
for gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is 

accounted for on the basis of the price in euro 

per fine ounce of gold, which, for the year 

ending 31 December 2006, was derived from 

the exchange rate of the euro against the 

US dollar on 29 December 2006.SECURITIES 
All marketable securities and similar assets are 

valued at the mid-market prices prevailing at 

the Balance Sheet date on a security-by-security 

basis. For the year ending 31 December 2006, 

mid-market prices on 29 December 2006 were 

used. Non-marketable securities are valued at 

cost. 
INCOME RECOGNITIONIncome and expenses are recognised in the 

period in which they are earned or incurred. 

Realised gains and losses arising from the sale 

of foreign exchange, gold and securities are 

taken to the Profit and Loss Account. Such 

realised gains and losses are calculated by 

reference to the average cost of the respective 

asset.Unrealised gains are not recognised as income 
but are transferred directly to a revaluation 

account.Unrealised losses are taken to the Profit and 
Loss Account if they exceed previous 

revaluation gains registered in the corresponding 

revaluation account. Unrealised losses in any 

one security, currency or in gold are not netted 

against unrealised gains in other securities, 

currencies or gold. In the event of an unrealised 

loss on any item at the year-end, the average 

cost of that item is reduced to the year-end 

exchange rate and/or market price.Premiums or discounts arising on purchased 
securities are calculated and presented as part 

of interest income and are amortised over the 

remaining life of the assets.REVERSE TRANSACTIONSReverse transactions are operations whereby 

the ECB buys or sells assets under a repurchase 

agreement or conducts credit operations against 

collateral.Under a repurchase agreement, securities are 
sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement to 

repurchase them from the counterparty at an 

agreed price on a set future date. Repurchase 

agreements are recorded as collateralised 

inward deposits on the liability side of the 

Balance Sheet and also lead to an interest 

expense in the Profit and Loss Account. 

Securities sold under such an agreement remain 

on the Balance Sheet of the ECB. 
Under a reverse repurchase agreement, 
securities are bought for cash with a 

simultaneous agreement to sell them back to the 

counterparty at an agreed price on a set future 

date. Reverse repurchase agreements are 

recorded as collateralised loans on the asset 

side of the Balance Sheet but are not included 

in the ECB™s security holdings. They give rise 

to interest income in the Profit and Loss 

Account.Reverse transactions (including security lending 
transactions) conducted under an automated 

security lending programme are recorded on the 

Balance Sheet only where collateral is provided 

to the ECB in the form of cash over the maturity 

of the transaction. In 2006 the ECB did not 

receive any collateral in the form of cash over 

the maturity of such transactions.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTSCurrency instruments, namely foreign exchange 

forward transactions, forward legs of foreign 

exchange swaps and other currency instruments 

involving an exchange of one currency for 

another at a future date, are included in the net 

foreign currency position for the purpose of 

calculating foreign exchange gains and losses.

2006Interest rate instruments are revalued on an 
item-by-item basis. Daily changes in the 

variation margin of open interest rate futures 

contracts are recorded in the Profit and Loss 

Account. The valuation of forward transactions 

in securities is based on a generally accepted 

valuation method using observable market 

prices and the discount factors from the 

settlement date to the valuation date. 
POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTS
Assets and liabilities are adjusted for events 

that occur between the annual Balance Sheet 

date and the date on which the Governing 

Council approves the financial statements, if 

such events materially affect the condition of 

assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date. 
INTRA-ESCB BALANCES/INTRA-EUROSYSTEM 

BALANCESIntra-ESCB transactions are cross-border 

transactions that occur between two EU central 

banks. These transactions are processed 

primarily via TARGET Œ the Trans-European 

Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express 

Transfer system (see Chapter 2) Œ and give rise 

to bilateral balances in accounts held between 

those EU central banks connected to TARGET. 

These bilateral balances are then assigned to 

the ECB on a daily basis, leaving each NCB 

with a single net bilateral position vis-à-vis the 

ECB only. This position in the books of the 

ECB represents the net claim or liability of 

each NCB against the rest of the ESCB. 
Intra-ESCB balances of the euro area NCBs 
with the ECB (except for the capital of the ECB 

and positions resulting from the transfer of 

foreign reserve assets to the ECB) are described 

as intra-Eurosystem claims or liabilities and are 

presented in the Balance Sheet of the ECB as a 

single net asset or liability position. 
Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the 
allocation of euro banknotes within the 

Eurosystem are included as a single net asset 

under ﬁClaims related to the allocation of euro 
banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ (see 

ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on 

accounting policies).Intra-ESCB balances of non-euro area NCBs 
(Danmarks Nationalbank and the Bank of 

England) with the ECB, arising from their 

participation in TARGET, are disclosed under 

ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area residents 

denominated in euroﬂ. On 31 December 2006, 

Sveriges Riksbank ceased to participate in 

TARGET.
TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETS
Fixed assets, with the exception of land, are 

valued at cost less depreciation. Land is valued 

at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-
line basis, beginning in the quarter after 

acquisition and continuing over the expected 

economic lifetime of the asset, as follows:Computers, related hardware and 
software, and motor vehicles4 years
Equipment, furniture and plant in building10 years

Capitalised building and refurbishment 
expenditure25 years
Fixed assets costing less than •10,000Written off 
in the year of 
acquisitionThe depreciation period for capitalised building 
and refurbishment expenditure relating to the 

ECB™s existing premises has been reduced in 

order to ensure that these assets are completely 

written off before the ECB moves to its new 

premises. 
THE ECB™S RETIREMENT PLAN AND OTHER 

POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The ECB operates a defined benefit scheme for 

its staff. This is funded by assets held in a long-

term employee-benefit fund. 
BALANCE SHEETThe liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in 

respect of the defined benefit plans is the 

present value of the defined benefit obligation 
202ECB Annual Report
2006at the Balance Sheet date, less the fair value of 
plan assets used to fund the obligation, adjusted 
for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the 

projected unit credit method. The present value 

of the defined benefit obligation is determined 

by discounting the estimated future cash flows, 

using interest rates of high-quality corporate 

bonds that are denominated in euro and have 

similar terms of maturity to the term of the 

related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses can arise from 
experience adjustments (where actual outcomes 

are different from the actuarial assumptions 

previously made) and changes in actuarial 

assumptions.PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
The net amount charged to the Profit and Loss 

Account comprises: 
(a) the current 
service cost of the benefits 
accruing for the year; 
(b) interest at the discount rate on the defined 
benefit obligation;(c) the expected return on the plan assets; and 

(d) any actuarial gains and losses recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account, using a ﬁ10% 
corridorﬂ approach.ﬁ10% CORRIDORﬂ APPROACH
Net cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains 

and losses which exceed the greater of (a) 10% 

of the present value of the defined benefit 

obligation and (b) 10% of the fair value of plan 

assets, are to be amortised over the expected 

average remaining working lives of the 

participating employees. 
PENSIONS OF EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS AND 

OTHER POST-RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
Unfunded arrangements are in place for the 

pensions of members of the Executive Board 

and disability benefit provisions for the staff. 

The expected costs of these benefits are accrued 

over the Executive Board/staff members™ terms 

of office/employment using an accounting 

approach similar to that of defined benefit 

pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses are 

recognised in the same manner as outlined 

above. 
These obligations are valued annually by 
independent actuaries to establish the 

appropriate liability in the financial 

statements.BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION
The ECB and the 12 euro area NCBs, which 

together comprise the Eurosystem, issue euro 

banknotes.3 The total value of euro banknotes 
in circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem 

central banks on the last working day of each 

month in accordance with the banknote 

allocation key4. The ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of 

the total value of euro banknotes in circulation, 

which is disclosed under the Balance Sheet 

liability item ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ. The 

ECB™s share of the total euro banknote issue is 

backed by claims on the NCBs. These claims, 

which bear interest,5 are disclosed under the 
sub-item ﬁIntra-Eurosystem claims: claims 

related to the allocation of euro banknotes 

within the Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁIntra-ESCB 

balances/intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the 
3 Decision ECB/2001/15 of 6 December 2001 on the issue of euro 
banknotes, OJ L 337, 20.12.2001, p. 52, as amended.

from taking into account the ECB™s share in the total euro 
banknote issue and applying the subscribed capital key to the 

NCBs™ share in that total.

monetary income of the national central banks of participating 

Member States from the financial year 2002, OJ L 337, 

20.12.2001, p. 55, as amended.203ECB Annual Report
2006notes on accounting policies). Interest income 
on these claims is included within the item ﬁNet 

interest incomeﬂ. Until 2005, this income was 

distributed separately to the NCBs in the form 

of an interim distribution after the end of each 

quarter.
6 For 2006 onwards, the Governing 
Council has decided that this income is due to 

the NCBs in the financial year in which it 

accrues, but is to be distributed on the second 

working day of the following year.
7 It is 
distributed in full unless the ECB™s net profit 

for the year is less than its income earned on 

euro banknotes in circulation and subject to any 

decisions by the Governing Council to make 

transfers to a provision for foreign exchange 

rate, interest rate and gold price risks and to 

charge costs incurred by the ECB in connection 

with the issue and handling of euro banknotes 

against this income.OTHER ISSUES
Taking account of the ECB™s role as a central 

bank, the Executive Board considers that the 

publication of a cash flow statement would not 

provide the readers of the financial statements 

with any additional relevant information.In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute of 
the ESCB, and on the basis of a recommendation 

of the Governing Council, the EU Council has 

approved the appointment of KPMG Deutsche 

Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft 

Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the external 

auditors of the ECB for a five-year period up to 

the end of the financial year 2007.6 Decision ECB/2002/9 of 21 November 2002 on the distribution 
of the income of the European Central Bank on euro banknotes 
in circulation to the national central banks of the participating 

Member States, OJ L 323, 28.11.2002, p. 49.

204ECB Annual Report
20061 GOLD AND GOLD RECEIVABLES 
As at 31 December 2006 the ECB held 20.6 
million ounces of fine gold (2005: 23.1 million 

ounces). The reduction was due to gold sales 

in accordance with the Central Bank Gold 

Agreement of 27 September 2004, of which the 

ECB is a signatory. The decrease in the euro 

value of this holding due to these sales was 

partially compensated by a significant rise in 

the price of gold during 2006 (see ﬁGold and 

foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the 

notes on accounting policies).2 CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA AND EURO 
AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN 

CURRENCYRECEIVABLES FROM THE IMF 
This asset represents the ECB™s holdings of 

special drawing rights (SDRs) as at 31 December 

2006. It arises as the result of a two-way SDR 

buying and selling arrangement with the 

International Monetary Fund (IMF), whereby 

the IMF is authorised to arrange sales or 

purchases of SDRs against euro, on behalf of 

the ECB, within minimum and maximum 

holding levels. The SDR is defined in terms of 

a basket of currencies. Its value is determined 

as the weighted sum of the exchange rates of 

four major currencies (euro, Japanese yen, 

pound sterling and US dollar). For accounting 

purposes, SDRs are treated as a foreign currency 

(see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and 

liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies).

206ECB Annual Report
2006The increase in ﬁLand and buildingsﬂ at cost is 
due mainly to the acquisition of a new official 

residence for Presidents of the ECB in December 

2006. The original residence, purchased in 

2001, was sold in January 2007.The increase in the category ﬁAssets under 
constructionﬂ relates mainly to initial works at 

the site of the new ECB premises. Transfers 

from this category to the relevant fixed asset 

captions will occur once the assets are in use.OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS

(a) Securities denominated in euro and reverse 
repurchase agreements in euro constitute 
the investment of the ECB™s own funds (see 

note 12, ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ). The increase in 

securities held was due mainly to the 

investment in the own funds portfolio of the 

counterpart of the ECB™s provision against 

foreign exchange, interest rate and gold 

price risks established by the ECB in 2005.(b) The ECB holds 3,211 shares in the BIS, 
which are included at the acquisition cost of 

•41.8 million.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS REVALUATION 

DIFFERENCES 
This item is composed of valuation changes in 

foreign exchange swap and forward transactions 

that were outstanding on 31 December 2006 

(see note 19, ﬁForeign exchange swap and 
forward transactionsﬂ). These differences arise 

from the conversion of such transactions into 

euro equivalent at the exchange rates prevailing 

on the Balance Sheet date, compared with the 

euro values at which the transactions are carried 

in the accounts (see ﬁGold and foreign currency 

assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies).ACCRUALS AND PREPAID EXPENSES
In 2005, accrued interest receivable on the 

ECB™s claims related to the allocation of euro 

banknotes within the Eurosystem (see 

ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on 

accounting policies) was reported on a gross 

basis under ﬁAccruals and prepaid expensesﬂ 

and ﬁAccruals and income collected in advanceﬂ. 

This interest is now disclosed on a net basis 

under ﬁAccruals and prepaid expensesﬂ in order 

better to reflect economic reality. For 

comparison purposes, •412,341,791 has been 

reclassified from the 2005 balance shown under 

ﬁAccruals and income collected in advanceﬂ to 

ﬁAccruals and prepaid expensesﬂ, reducing the 

balance of both these positions accordingly. 
Also included under this item is accrued 
interest, including the amortisation of discounts, 

on securities and other financial assets.SUNDRY 
This item includes a claim against the German 

Federal Ministry of Finance in respect of 

recoverable value added tax and other indirect 

taxes paid. Such taxes are refundable under the 

terms of Article 3 of the Protocol on the 

privileges and immunities of the European 

Communities, which applies to the ECB by 

virtue of Article 40 of the Statute of the 

ESCB. 
7 BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION 
This item consists of the ECB™s share (8%) of 

the total euro banknotes in circulation (see

RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN EURO 
This item comprises deposits by members of 

the Euro Banking Association (EBA) which are 

used in order to provide the ECB with collateral 

in respect of the EBA™s payments settled through 

the TARGET system.
9 LIABILITIES TO NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN EURO 
These liabilities principally represent balances 

held at the ECB by non-euro area NCBs arising 

from transactions processed via the TARGET 

system (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/intra-
Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies).10 LIABILITIES TO NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY 
This position consists of repurchase agreements 

conducted with non-euro area residents in 

connection with the management of the foreign 

currency reserves of the ECB.11 INTRA-EUROSYSTEM LIABILITIES 
These represent the liabilities to the euro area 

NCBs that arose from the transfer of foreign 

reserve assets to the ECB when they joined the 

Eurosystem. No adjustments were made in 

2006.These balances are remunerated at the latest 
available marginal rate for the Eurosystem™s 

main refinancing operations, adjusted to reflect 

a zero return on the gold component (see note 

20, ﬁNet interest incomeﬂ).

13 PROVISIONS 
Taking into account the ECB™s large exposure 
to foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 

price risks, and the size of its revaluation 

accounts, the Governing Council deemed it 

appropriate to establish a provision against 

these risks. Consequently, as at 31 December 

2005, an amount of •992 million was recorded 

in this provision. As at 31 December 2006, an 

additional amount of •1,379 million was 

recorded, increasing its size to •2,371 million 

and, as in 2005, reducing net profit to exactly 

zero.The provision will be used to fund future 
realised and unrealised losses, in particular 

valuation losses not covered by the revaluation 
209ECB Annual Report
2006accounts. The size and continuing requirement 
of this provision is reviewed annually, based on 

the ECB™s assessment of its future exposure to 

foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 

price risks. This assessment is based on 

generally accepted methods for estimating 

financial risks.An appropriate provision against the contractual 
obligation of the ECB to restore its current 

premises to their original condition when they 

are vacated and the ECB moves to its final site 

is included in this item, together with other 

miscellaneous provisions.  
14 REVALUATION ACCOUNTS 
These accounts represent revaluation reserves

CHANGES TO THE ECB™S CAPITAL KEY

BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Article 29 of the ESCB Statute, the 
shares of the NCBs in the ECB™s capital key are 

weighted according to the shares of the 

respective Member States in the EU™s total 

population and GDP in equal measure, as 

notified to the ECB by the European 

Commission. These weights are adjusted every 

five years and whenever new Member States 

join the EU. Based on Council Decision 

2003/517/EC of 15 July 2003 on the statistical 

data to be used for the adjustment of the key for 

subscription to the capital of the European 

Central Bank, the NCBs™ capital key shares 

were adjusted on 1 January 2007, upon the 

accession of Bulgaria and Romania as new 

Member States, as follows:From

ENTRY OF SLOVENIA INTO THE EURO AREA
Pursuant to Council Decision 2006/495/EC of 
11 July 2006, taken in accordance with Article 

122(2) of the Treaty, Slovenia adopted the 

single currency on 1 January 2007. In accordance 

with Article 49.1 of the Statute of the ESCB 

and the legal acts adopted by the Governing 

Council on 30 December 200610, Banka 
Slovenije paid up an amount of •17,096,556 as 

at 1 January 2007, representing the remainder 

of its capital subscription to the ECB. On 2 and 

3 January 2007, in accordance with Article 30.1 

of the Statute of the ESCB, Banka Slovenije 

transferred foreign reserve assets with a total 

value equivalent to •191,641,809 to the ECB. 

The total amount transferred was determined by 

multiplying the euro value, at the exchange 

rates prevailing on 29 December 2006, of the 

foreign reserve assets already transferred to the 

ECB by the ratio between the number of shares 

subscribed by Banka Slovenije and the number 

of shares already paid up by the other NCBs 

without a derogation. These foreign reserve 

assets comprised amounts of US dollars in the 

form of cash, and gold, in proportions of 85 to 

15 respectively. 
Banka Slovenije was credited with a claim in 
respect of the paid-up capital and foreign 

reserve assets equivalent to the amounts

The enlargement of the European Union through 
the accession of Bulgaria and Romania and the 

concomitant change in the subscribed capital 

and capital key of the ECB, in conjunction with 

Slovenia joining the euro area, resulted in an 

increase of •37,858,680 in the ECB™s paid-up 

capital.NCBS™ CLAIMS EQUIVALENT TO THE FOREIGN 

RESERVE ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO THE ECB
The change in NCBs™ weightings in the ECB™s

foreign reserve assets increased the NCBs™ 

claims by •259,568,376. 
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS17 AUTOMATIC SECURITY LENDING 
PROGRAMME

funds, the ECB has concluded an automatic 

security lending programme agreement, 

whereby an appointed agent enters into security 

lending transactions on behalf of the ECB with 

a number of counterparties, designated by the 

ECB as eligible counterparties. Under this 

agreement, reverse transactions with a value of 

•2.2 billion (2005: •0.9 billion) were 

outstanding as at 31 December 2006 (see 

ﬁReverse transactionsﬂ in the notes on 

accounting policies). 
18 INTEREST RATE FUTURES

denominated assets. 
INTEREST INCOME ARISING FROM THE ALLOCATION 

OF EURO BANKNOTES WITHIN THE EUROSYSTEM 
This item consists of the interest income relating 

to the ECB™s share in the total euro banknote 

issue. Interest on the claims of the ECB in 

respect of its share of banknotes is earned at 

the latest available marginal rate for the 

Eurosystem™s main refinancing operations. The 

increase in income in 2006 reflected both the 
general increase in euro banknotes in circulation 

and the increases in the ECB™s main refinancing 

rate. This income is distributed to the NCBs as 

described in ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the 

notes on accounting policies. 
Based on the ECB™s estimated financial result 
for 2006, the Governing Council decided to 

withhold distribution of the whole of this 

income. 
REMUNERATION OF NCBS™ CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF 

FOREIGN RESERVES TRANSFERRED 
Remuneration paid to euro area NCBs on their 

claims on the ECB in respect of the foreign 

reserve assets transferred under Article 30.1 of 

the Statute of the ESCB is disclosed under this 

item.OTHER INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER INTEREST 

EXPENSEThese items include interest income of 

•2.5 billion (2005: •1.6 billion) and expenses 

of •2.4 billion (2005: •1.5 billion) on balances 

arising from TARGET. Interest income and 

expenses in respect of other assets and liabilities 

denominated in euro are also shown here.21 REALISED GAINS/LOSSES ARISING FROM

end-of-year exchange rate, following the 

depreciation of this currency against the euro 

over the year.

on current accounts and in connection with the 

execution of foreign currency interest rate 

futures (see note 18, ﬁInterest rate futuresﬂ).24 INCOME FROM EQUITY SHARES AND 
PARTICIPATING INTERESTS 
Dividends received on shares in the BIS (see 

note 6, ﬁOther assetsﬂ) were previously included 

under ﬁOther incomeﬂ (•853,403 in 2005), but 

are now shown under this heading. 
25 OTHER INCOME 
Other miscellaneous income during the year 

arose principally from the transfer of unused 

administrative provisions to the Profit and Loss 

Account. 
26 STAFF COSTS 
Salaries, allowances, staff insurance and other 

miscellaneous costs of •133.4 million (2005: 

•127.4 million) are included under this heading. 

Staff costs of •1.0 million incurred in connection 

with the construction of the new ECB premises 

have been capitalised and are excluded from 

this item. No staff costs were capitalised in 

2005.The emoluments of the Executive Board 
amounted to a total of •2.2 million (2005: 

•2.1 million). Transitional payments are made 

to former members of the Executive Board for 

a period after the end of their terms of office. In 

2006 these payments amounted to •0.3 million 

in total (•0.4 million in 2005). Pension payments 

of •0.1 million were made to former members 

of the Executive Board or their dependents 

during the year (•0.1 million in 2005).Salaries and allowances, including the 
emoluments of holders of senior management 

positions, are modelled in essence on, and are 

comparable with, the remuneration scheme of 

the European Communities.Also included under this item is an amount of 
•27.4 million (2005: •25.6 million) recognised 

in connection with the ECB™s retirement plan 

and other post-employment benefits (see note 

12, ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ). 
At the end of 2006 the ECB employed the 
full-time equivalent of 1,367 staff on permanent 

or fixed-term contracts, of whom 138 held 

managerial positions. The change in the number 

of staff during 2006 was as follows:

as at 31 December 2006, the ECB employed the 

full-time equivalent of 70 staff (2005: 57) on 

short-term contracts to replace staff on unpaid/

parental and maternity leave. 
The ECB also offers the possibility to staff 
from other central banks of the ESCB to 

undertake temporary assignments at the ECB. 

61 ESCB staff participated in this programme 

as at 31 December 2006 (2005: 46) and their 

cost is included within this caption.27 ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
These cover all other current expenses relating 

to the renting and maintenance of premises, 

goods and equipment of a non-capital nature, 

professional fees and other services and 

supplies, together with staff-related expenses 

including recruitment, relocation, installation, 

training and resettlement.28 BANKNOTE PRODUCTION SERVICES 
This expense relates to costs arising from cross-
border transportation of euro banknotes between 

NCBs to meet unexpected fluctuations in 

demand for banknotes. These costs are borne 

centrally by the ECB. 
215ECB Annual Report
2006NOTE ON PROFIT DISTRIBUTION/
ALLOCATION OF LOSSES
This note is not part of the financial statements 
of the ECB for the year 2006.INCOME RELATED TO THE ECB™S SHARE OF TOTAL 

BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION
In 2005, following a decision by the Governing 

Council, income of •868 million earned on the 

ECB™s share of total banknotes in circulation 

was retained to ensure that the ECB™s total 

profit distribution for the year did not exceed 

its net profit for the year. Similarly, in 2006 an 

amount of •1,319 million was retained. Both 

amounts represented the full income earned on 

the ECB™s share of total euro banknotes in 

circulation in the years in question.PROFIT DISTRIBUTION/COVERAGE OF LOSSES
Pursuant to Article 33 of the Statute of the 

ESCB, the net profit of the ECB shall be 

transferred in the following order:(a) an amount to be determined by the Governing 
Council, which may not exceed 20% of the 
net profit, shall be transferred to the general 

reserve fund subject to a limit equal to 100% 

of the capital; and 
(b) the remaining net profit shall be distributed 
to the shareholders of the ECB in proportion 

to their paid-up shares.In the event of a loss incurred by the ECB, the 

shortfall may be offset against the general 

reserve fund of the ECB and, if necessary, 

following a decision by the Governing Council, 

against the monetary income of the relevant 

financial year in proportion and up to the 

amounts allocated to the NCBs in accordance 

with Article 32.5 of the Statute.
1In 2006 the funding of the provision against 

foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 

price risks for the amount of •1,379 million had 

the effect of reducing net profit to exactly zero. 

Consequently, as in 2005, no transfers to the 
general reserve fund or profit distribution to the 

shareholders of the ECB took place. There was 

also no requirement to offset a loss.
1 Under Article 32.5 of the Statute of the ESCB, the sum of the 
NCBs™ monetary income shall be allocated to the NCBs in 
proportion to their paid-up shares in the capital of the ECB.218ECB Annual Report

November 2006.239ECB Annual Report
2006GLOSSARY
This glossary contains selected terms that are used in the Annual Report. A more comprehensive 
and detailed glossary can be found on the ECB™s website.
Balance of payments (b.o.p.): a statistical statement that summarises, for a specific period of 
time, the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world. The transactions 

considered are those involving goods, services and income; those involving financial claims 

on, and liabilities to, the rest of the world; and those (such as debt forgiveness) that are 

classified as transfers.Benchmark portfolio: in relation to investments, a reference portfolio or index constructed on 
the basis of the objectives for the liquidity and risk of, as well as the return on, the investments. 

The benchmark portfolio serves as a basis for comparison of the performance of the actual 

portfolio.Bond market: the market in which longer-term 
debt securities are issued and traded.Candidate countries: countries for which the EU has accepted an application for EU membership. 
Accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey began on 3 October 2005, while those with the 

Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have not yet started. 
Central counterparty: an entity that interposes itself between the counterparties to trades, 
acting as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.
Central government: the government as defined in the European System of Accounts 1995 
but 
excluding regional and local governments (see also general government).Central securities depository (CSD): an entity that holds and administrates securities and 
enables securities transactions to be processed by book entry. Securities can be held in physical 

(but immobilised) or dematerialised form (i.e. so that they exist only as electronic records). In 

addition to the safekeeping and administration of securities, a CSD may incorporate clearing and 

settlement functions.Collateral: assets pledged or otherwise transferred (e.g. by credit institutions
 to central banks) 
as a guarantee for the repayment of loans, as well as assets sold (e.g. by credit institutions to 

central banks) under repurchase agreements
.Consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector: a balance sheet obtained by netting out inter-
MFI positions (e.g. inter-MFI loans and deposits) in the aggregated MFI balance sheet. It provides 
statistical information on the MFI sector™s assets and liabilities vis-à-vis residents of the 
euro 
area
 not belonging to this sector (i.e. general government and other euro area residents) and 
vis-à-vis non-euro area residents. It is the main statistical source for the calculation of monetary 

aggregates, and it provides the basis for the regular analysis of the counterparts of M3.Corporate governance: rules, procedures and processes according to which an organisation is 
directed and controlled. The corporate governance structure specifies the distribution of rights 

and responsibilities among the different participants in the organisation Œ such as the board, 

managers, shareholders and other stakeholders Œ and lays down the rules and procedures for 

decision-making.240ECB Annual Report
2006Corporate profitability:
 a measure of the earnings performance of corporations, mainly in 
relation to their sales, assets or equity. There are a number of different corporate profitability 
ratios based on company financial statements, such as the ratio of operating income (sales minus 

operating expenses) to sales, the ratio of net income (operating and non-operating income, after 

tax, depreciation and extraordinary items) to sales, the return on assets (relating net income to 

total assets) and the return on equity (relating net income to shareholders™ funds). At the 

macroeconomic level, the gross operating surplus
, based on national accounts, for instance in 
relation to GDP or value added, is often used as a measure of profitability.
Cost of the external financing of non-financial corporations (real):
 the cost incurred by non-financial corporations when taking up new external funds. For euro area
 non-financial corporations, 
it is calculated as a weighted average of the cost of bank lending, the cost of debt securities and 
the cost of equity, based on the amounts outstanding (corrected for valuation effects) and deflated 

by inflation expectations.Counterparty: the opposite party in a financial transaction (e.g. any party transacting with a 
central bank).Credit derivative:
 a financial instrument which separates the credit risk from an underlying 
financial transaction, enabling the credit risk to be priced and transferred separately.
Credit institution:
 i) an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable 
funds from the public and to grant credit for its own account; or ii) an undertaking or any other 

legal person, other than those under i), which issues means of payment in the form of electronic 

money.
Credit risk:
 the risk that a counterparty will not settle an obligation at full value, either when 
it becomes due or at any time thereafter. Credit risk includes replacement cost risk and principal 

risk. It also includes the risk of settlement bank failure.Debt security: a promise on the part of the issuer (i.e. the borrower) to make one or more payments 
to the holder (the lender) at a specified future date or dates. Such securities usually carry a specific 

rate of interest (the coupon) and/or are sold at a discount to the amount that will be repaid at 

maturity. Debt securities issued with an original maturity of more than one year are classified as 

long-term.Deposit facility: a standing facility of the Eurosystem
 which counterparties may use to make 
overnight deposits, remunerated at a pre-specified interest rate, at an NCB (see also key ECB 
interest rates
).Direct investment:
 cross-border investment for the purpose of obtaining a lasting interest in an 
enterprise resident in another economy (assumed, in practice, for ownership of at least 10% of the 

ordinary shares or voting power).ECOFIN Council: the EU Council meeting in the composition of the ministers of economy and 
finance. 
Economic analysis: one pillar of the European Central Bank
™s framework for conducting a 
comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability, which forms the basis for the Governing 
241ECB Annual Report
2006Council™s monetary policy decisions. The economic analysis focuses mainly on the assessment 
of current economic and financial developments and the implied short to medium-term risks to 
price stability from the perspective of the interplay between supply and demand in goods, services 

and factor markets at those horizons. Due attention is paid to the need to identify the nature of 

shocks affecting the economy, their effects on cost and pricing behaviour and the short to medium-

term prospects for their propagation in the economy (see also monetary analysis).Economic and Financial Committee (EFC): a consultative Community body which contributes 
to the preparation of the work of the ECOFIN Council and the European Commission. Its tasks 
include reviewing the economic and financial situation of the Member States and of the Community, 

and budgetary surveillance. 
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): the process that led to the single currency, the euro, and 
the single monetary policy in the euro area
, as well as to the coordination of the economic 
policies of the EU Member States. This process, as laid down in the Treaty, took place in three 

stages. Stage Three, the final stage, started on 1 January 1999 with the transfer of monetary 

competence to the European Central Bank
 and the introduction of the euro. The cash changeover 
on 1 January 2002 completed the process of setting up EMU. 
Effective exchange rate (EER) of the euro (nominal/real):
 weighted average of bilateral euro 
exchange rates against the currencies of the euro area
™s important trading partners. The 
European 
Central Bank publishes nominal EER indices for the euro against two groups of trading partners: 
the EER-24 (comprising the 14 non-euro area EU Member States and 10 main trading partners 

outside the EU) and the EER-44 (composed of the EER-24 and 20 additional countries). The 

weights used reflect the share of each partner country in euro area trade and account for competition 

in third markets. Real EERs are nominal EERs deflated by a weighted average of foreign, relative 

to domestic, prices or costs. They are thus measures of price and cost competitiveness.
EONIA (euro overnight index average):
 a measure of the effective interest rate prevailing in the 
euro interbank overnight market. It is calculated as a weighted average of the interest rates on 

unsecured overnight lending transactions denominated in euro, as reported by a panel of 

contributing banks. 
Equities: securities representing ownership of a stake in a corporation. They comprise shares 
traded on stock exchanges (quoted shares), unquoted shares and other forms of equity. Equities 

usually produce income in the form of dividends.Equity market: the market in which equities are issued and traded. 
ERM II (exchange rate mechanism II): the exchange rate arrangement that provides the 
framework for exchange rate policy cooperation between the euro area
 countries and the non-euro area EU Member States.EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate):
 the rate at which a prime bank is willing to lend funds 
in euro to another prime bank, as reported by a panel of contributing banks, computed daily for 

interbank deposits with different maturities of up to 12 months.
Euro area:
 the area encompassing those Member States which have adopted the euro as the single 
currency in accordance with the Treaty 
and in which a single monetary policy is conducted under 
242ECB Annual Report
2006the responsibility of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank
. The euro area 
currently comprises Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Finland. 
European Central Bank (ECB):
 the ECB lies at the centre of the Eurosystem
 and the European 
System of Central Banks (ESCB) and has its own legal personality in accordance with the 
Treaty
 (Article 107(2)). It ensures that the tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem and the ESCB 
are implemented either through its own activities or through those of the NCBs, pursuant to the 

Statute of the ESCB. The ECB is governed by the 
Governing Council and the Executive Board, and, as a third decision-making body, by the 
General Council. European Monetary Institute (EMI): 
a temporary institution established at the start of Stage

 a comprehensive and integrated system of 
macroeconomic accounts based on a set of internationally agreed statistical concepts, definitions, 

classifications and accounting rules aimed at achieving a harmonised quantitative description of 

the economies of the EU Member States. The ESA 95 is the Community™s version of the world 

System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 93). 
European System of Central Banks (ESCB):
 composed of the European Central Bank (ECB)
 and the NCBs of all 27 EU Member States, i.e. it includes, in addition to the members of the 
Eurosystem
, the NCBs of those Member States that have not yet adopted the euro. The ESCB is 
governed by the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the ECB, and, as a third decision-making body of the ECB, by the General Council. Eurosystem:
 the central banking system of the euro area
. It comprises the European Central 
Bank and the NCBs of the Member States that have adopted the euro. 
Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF):
 the framework that defines the procedures, 
rules and techniques which ensure that all eligible assets meet the Eurosystem
™s high credit 
standards.Excessive deficit procedure:
 the provision set out in Article 104 of the 
Treaty
 and specified in 
Protocol No 20 on the excessive deficit procedure requires EU Member States to maintain 

budgetary discipline, defines the criteria for a budgetary position to be considered an excessive 

deficit and regulates steps to be taken following the observation that the requirements for the 

budgetary balance or government debt have not been fulfilled. Article 104 is supplemented by 

Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the 

implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (as amended by Council Regulation (EC) 

No 1056/2005 of 27 June 2005), which is one element of the Stability and Growth Pact
. Executive Board: one of the decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank (ECB)

markets and market infrastructures Œ is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of 
financial imbalances, thereby mitigating the likelihood of disruptions in the financial intermediation 

process which are severe enough to significantly impair the allocation of savings to profitable 

investment opportunities.Fine-tuning operation: an open market operation executed by the Eurosystem
 in order to deal 
with unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market. The frequency and maturity of fine-tuning 

operations are not standardised.Foreign exchange swap:
 simultaneous spot and forward transactions exchanging one currency

security funds. Excluded are government-owned entities that conduct commercial operations, 

such as public enterprises.Governing Council: the supreme decision-making body of the European Central Bank (ECB)
. It comprises all the members of the Executive Board of the ECB and the governors of the NCBs 
of the Member States that have adopted the euro.Gross operating surplus:
 the surplus (or deficit) on the value of output of production activities 
after the costs of intermediate consumption, compensation of employees and taxes less subsidies 

on production have been deducted, but before payments and receipts of income related to the 

borrowing/renting or owning of financial and non-produced assets have been taken into 

account. 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP):
 a measure of consumer prices that is compiled 
by Eurostat and harmonised for all EU Member States.Implied volatility: the expected volatility (i.e. standard deviation) in the rates of change of the 
price of an asset (e.g. a share or a bond). It can be derived from the asset™s price, maturity date 

and exercise price of its options, as well as from a riskless rate of return, using an option pricing 

model such as the Black-Scholes model.International investment position (i.i.p.): the value and composition of an economy™s outstanding 
net financial claims on (or financial liabilities to) the rest of the world. 
Key ECB interest rates:
 the interest rates, set by the Governing Council, which reflect the 
monetary policy stance of the European Central Bank
. They are the 
minimum bid rate on the 
main refinancing operations
, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility and the interest 
rate on the deposit facility. 244ECB Annual Report
2006Liquidity risk: the risk that a counterparty will not settle an obligation at its full value when 
due but on some unspecified date thereafter. 
Lisbon strategy: a comprehensive agenda of structural reforms aimed at transforming the EU into 
ﬁthe most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the worldﬂ, launched in 2000 
by the Lisbon European Council.Longer-term refinancing operation:
 a regular open market operation executed by the 
Eurosystem
 in the form of reverse transactions
. Such operations are carried out through a 
monthly standard tender and normally have a maturity of three months.M1: a narrow monetary aggregate that comprises currency in circulation plus overnight deposits 
held with MFIs and central government (e.g. at the post office or treasury).
M2: an intermediate monetary aggregate that comprises M1 plus deposits redeemable at a period

an agreed maturity of up to and including two years (i.e. short-term time deposits) held with MFIs and central government.M3: a broad monetary aggregate that comprises M2 plus marketable instruments, in particular 
repurchase agreements
, money market fund shares/units, and debt securities with a maturity

Maintenance period: the period over which credit institutions
™ compliance with reserve 
requirements
 is calculated. The maintenance period begins on the settlement day of the first 
main 
refinancing operation
 following the meeting of the Governing Council at which the monthly 
assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled. The 
European Central Bank
 publishes 
a calendar of the reserve maintenance periods at least three months before the start of the year. 
Marginal lending facility: a standing facility of the Eurosystem
 which counterparties may use 
to receive overnight credit from an NCB at a pre-specified interest rate against eligible assets (see 

also key ECB interest rates
). 
Market risk: the risk that the value of an investment will decrease owing to moves in market 
factors. There are generally considered to be four market risk factors: equity risk, interest rate 

risk, currency risk and commodity risk. 
MFIs (monetary financial institutions): financial institutions which together form the money-issuing sector of the euro area
. These include the 
Eurosystem
, resident credit institutions
 (as 
defined in Community law) and all other resident financial institutions whose business is to 

receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from entities other than MFIs and, for their

group consists predominantly of money market funds. 
245ECB Annual Report
2006MFI credit to euro area residents:

 residents (including 
general government and the private sector) and MFI holdings of securities (shares, other equity 
and debt securities) issued by non-MFI euro area residents.MFI interest rates:
 the interest rates that are applied by resident credit
 institutions and other 
MFIs, excluding central banks and money market funds, to euro-denominated deposits and loans

market fund shares/units and debt securities issued by MFIs with a maturity of up to and 
including two years).Minimum bid rate: lower limit to the interest rates at which counterparties may submit bids in 
the variable rate tenders of the main refinancing operations
. This is one of the 
key ECB interest 
rates reflecting the stance of monetary policy. 
Monetary analysis: one pillar of the European Central Bank
™s framework for conducting a 
comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability, which forms the basis for the Governing 
Council™s monetary policy decisions. The monetary analysis helps to assess medium to long-term 
trends in inflation, in view of the close relationship between money and prices over extended 

horizons. The monetary analysis takes into account developments in a wide range of monetary 

indicators including M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and various measures 
of excess liquidity (see also economic analysis).Monetary income: income accruing to the NCBs in the performance of the Eurosystem
™s 
monetary policy function, derived from assets earmarked in accordance with guidelines established

reverse transactions
 are the main open market instrument of the Eurosystem and can be employed 
in all four categories of operations. In addition, the issuance of debt certificates and outright 

transactions are available for structural operations, while outright transactions, foreign exchange 
swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits are available for the conduct of fine-tuning 
operations. 
246ECB Annual Report
2006Option: a financial instrument that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell 
specific assets (e.g. a bond or a stock) at a predetermined price (the strike or exercise price) at or 
up to a certain future date (the exercise or maturity date). 
Other financial intermediary (OFI): 
a corporation or quasi-corporation (other than an insurance 
corporation or pension fund) that is engaged mainly in financial intermediation by incurring 

liabilities in forms other than currency, deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from 

institutional entities other than MFIs. OFIs include in particular corporations engaged primarily 

in long-term financing, such as financial leasing, securitised asset holdings, other financial 

holdings, securities and derivatives dealing (on their own account), venture capital and development 

capital.Portfolio investment: euro area
 residents™ net transactions and/or positions in securities issued 
by non-residents of the euro area (ﬁassetsﬂ) and non-residents™ net transactions and/or positions 

in securities issued by euro area residents (ﬁliabilitiesﬂ). Included are equity securities and debt 
securities (bonds and notes, and money market instruments), excluding amounts recorded in 
direct investment
 or reserve assets. 
Price stability: the maintenance of price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem
. The Governing Council defines price stability as a year-on-year increase in the 
Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices
 for the euro area 
of below 2%. The Governing Council has also made 
it clear that, in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 

2% over the medium term.Primary balance: government net borrowing or net lending excluding interest payments on 
consolidated government liabilities.Projections:
 the results of exercises conducted four times a year to project possible future 
macroeconomic developments in the euro area
. Eurosystem
 staff projections are published in 
June and December, whereas 
European Central Bank (ECB)
 staff projections are published in 
March and September. They form part of the 
economic analysis pillar of the monetary policy 
strategy of the ECB and are thus one of several inputs into the Governing Council™s assessment 
of the risks to price stability. Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system: 
a settlement system in which processing and 
settlement take place on an order-by-order basis (without netting) in real time (continuously) (see 

also TARGET
).Reference value for M3 growth:
 the annual growth rate of M3 over the medium term that is 
consistent with the maintenance of price stability. At present, the reference value for annual M3 
growth is 4½%.Repurchase agreement:
 an agreement whereby an asset is sold while the seller simultaneously 
obtains the right and obligation to repurchase it at a specified price on a future date or on demand. 

Such an agreement is similar to collateralised borrowing, with the difference that ownership of 

the securities is not retained by the seller.
 247ECB Annual Report
2006Reserve base: the sum of the eligible balance sheet items (in particular liabilities) that constitute 
the basis for calculating the reserve requirement
 of a credit institution
.Reserve ratio: the ratio defined by the central bank for each category of eligible balance sheet 
items included in the reserve base
. The ratio is used to calculate 
reserve requirements
.Reserve requirement:
 the minimum amount of reserves a credit institution
 is required to hold 
with the Eurosystem
. Compliance is determined on the basis of the average of the daily balances 
over a maintenance period.Reverse transaction: an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under a 
repurchase agreement
 or conducts credit operations against collateral.Securities settlement system (SSS): a system which permits the holding and transfer of securities, 
either free of payment or against payment (delivery versus payment) or against another asset 
(delivery versus delivery). It comprises all the institutional and technical arrangements required 

for the settlement of securities trades and the safekeeping of securities. Such a system can operate 

on a real-time gross settlement, gross settlement or net settlement basis. A settlement system 

allows for the calculation (clearing) of the obligations of participants.Settlement risk: a general term used to designate the risk that settlement in a transfer system will 
not take place as expected. This risk may comprise both 
credit
 and liquidity risk.Stability and Growth Pact:
 the Stability and Growth Pact is intended to serve as a means of 
safeguarding sound government finances in Stage Three of 
Economic and Monetary Union in 
order to strengthen the conditions for price stability and for strong, sustainable growth conducive 

to employment creation. To this end, the Pact prescribes that Member States specify medium-term 

budgetary objectives. It also contains concrete specifications on the excessive deficit procedure
. The Pact consists of the Resolution of the Amsterdam European Council of 17 June 1997 on the 

Stability and Growth Pact and two Council Regulations, namely i) Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 

of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance 

and coordination of economic policies as amended by Regulation (EC) 1055/2005 of 27 June 

2005, and ii) Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the 

implementation of the excessive deficit procedure as amended by Regulation (EC) 1056/2005 of 

27 June 2005. The Stability and Growth Pact is complemented by the ECOFIN Council™s report 

entitled ﬁImproving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pactﬂ, which was endorsed 

by the Brussels European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005. It is also complemented by the new 

Code of Conduct entitled ﬁSpecifications on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact 

and Guidelines on the format and content of stability and convergence programmesﬂ, which was 

endorsed by the ECOFIN Council on 11 October 2005. 
Standing facility: a central bank facility available to counterparties on their own initiative. The 
Eurosystem
 offers two overnight standing facilities: the 
marginal lending facility and the deposit 
facility.Straight-through processing (STP):
 the automated end-to-end processing of trades/payment 
transfers including the automated completion of generation, confirmation, clearing and settlement 

of instructions.248ECB Annual Report
2006Systemic risk: the risk that the inability of one institution to meet its obligations when due will 
cause other institutions to be unable to meet their obligations when due. Such a failure may cause 
significant liquidity or credit problems and, as a result, could threaten the stability of or confidence 

in markets.TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system):
 the 
real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system
 for the euro. It is a decentralised system consisting of 
17 national RTGS systems, the ECB payment mechanism (EPM) and the interlinking 

mechanism. 
TARGET2:
 a new generation of the TARGET
 system in which the current decentralised 
technical structure will be replaced by a single shared platform offering a harmonised service 

with a uniform pricing scheme.Treaty:
 refers to the Treaty establishing the European Community (ﬁTreaty of Romeﬂ). The Treaty 
has been amended on several occasions, in particular by the Treaty on European Union (ﬁMaastricht 

Treatyﬂ) which laid the foundations for
