xOverview - 1 - 
Economic activity accelerated strongly in the first half of 2006 both in the 
EU and in the euro area.  Real GDP growth rose to 0.8% quarter-on-
quarter in the first quarter and 0.9%
 in the second quarter of 2006.  
Although the upturn is partly explaine
d by temporary factors (such as the 
football World Cup), this was the strongest pace of expansion since the 
second quarter of 2000 and well ab
ove potential. Output growth is 
expected to reach 2.8% in the EU and 2.6% in the euro area in 2006.  This 
would be more than 1 percentage point 
(pp.) above last year's growth and 
½ pp. higher than forecast in the spring.  
Over the forecast period, economic growth is expected to moderate to a 
rate close to potential. This easi
ng reflects mainly a softer world economy 
and the temporary impact of the budgetary policy measures in Germany. 
GDP in 2007-2008 is projected to grow by 
2.4% in the EU, while in the 
euro area growth is forecast to reach 2.1% in 2007 and 2.2% in 2008. 
The main factors behind this outlook include a tighter macroeconomic 
policy mix compared with previous y
ears, continued benign financial 
conditions, higher profit margin
s and, despite a certain slowdown, the still-
solid expansion of the world economy. 
Economic growth is being driven by robust growth in domestic demand. 
Investment, which saw a remarkable acceleration in the first half of 2006, 
should maintain a solid momentum over the forecast period. Business 
investment, in particular, is set to continue its brisk pace, while 
construction investment is likely to
 soften amid an exp
ected cooling of 
housing markets in some Member States. 
Private consumption, 
which also  
firmed in 2006, albeit more moderately, 
is projected to continue its gradual 
acceleration in line with the turnaround in the labour market.  
Economic activity is also being supported
 by a positive, albeit small, net 
contribution from the external sector.  Indeed, the better-than-expected 

outcome in the first half of this year 
is largely explained by a continued 
strong expansion of the world econom
y, despite high oil prices. World 
GDP growth is now estimated at mo
re than 5% this year, marginally below 
the record high attained in 2004. Gl
obal growth will ease somewhat 
towards the end of this year, predominantly due to a projected slowdown in 
the United States. World GDP growth is 
thus set to moderate slightly in 
2007-2008, to a 
rate just above 4½%.  
Growth in the United States has 
started to slow down this year. Higher 
energy prices, increases in interest rates and a decline in house price 
inflation have all started to weigh 
on domestic demand.  Residential 
construction, in particular, has started 
to fall (-2.8% q-
o-q in 2006Q2).  
The cooling of the housing market
 is likely to also
 curb private 
consumption in the period ahead.  GDP growth is thus poised to ease from 
3.4% this year to 2.3% in 2007, before recovering to 2.8% in 2008.  Owing 
to the slowdown in the gr
owth rate of private consumption the households 
saving rate is expected to move back
 into positive territory, 
but not enough 
to lead to any marked improvement in
 the current account (which is 
projected to stabilise 
at around -6½% of GDP).

11Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 - 2 - 
The recovery in Japan is becoming 
increasingly broad-based, with GDP 
growing by 3.0% in the first half of 2006. Rising confidence and an 
improved employment outlook are supporting consumption, while healthy 
profits and a turnaround in bank credit boosted investment. Growth is 
likely to reach a robust 2.7% this year before easing gradually to 2.3% and 
2.1% in the coming two years.  A
lthough the Japanese economy is slowly 
overcoming deflation, a recent rebasing
 of consumer prices to reflect a 
revised consumption basket has brought
 down price increases to ¼% in 
July. In fact, on the new basis and 
excluding energy and food prices, 
consumer prices continued to decline in August.   
Growth in the rest of Asia is set to
 remain strong, although moderating 
somewhat to around 8% in both 2007 and 2008.  Asia is thereby gradually 
becoming an important driving force of global growth (partly 
compensating for the slowdown in the 
United States). For China, growth 
projections have been revised upwards 
in view of booming exports and the 
picking-up of investment spending.  
Over-investment in some sectors and 
strong credit expansion are sources of concern for the Chinese authorities, 

who have recently introduced measures to
 rein in investment and tighten 
domestic liquidity conditions. These m
easures should help dampen output 
growth, which should nevertheless remai
n very solid in the period ahead. 
Slowing economic growth in China and
 in India will be offset by an 
acceleration of output growth in other parts of the region.   
Among the other emerging regions, economic growth is forecast to slow 
down to 5-5.5% a year in the Middle East and North Africa and to decline 

gradually to 3¾% in 2008 in 
Latin America, while rebounding in Sub-
Saharan Africa to 6% next year on 
the back of higher export growth.  
Better-than-foreseen growth in world out
put in the first half of this year 
also boosted world trade, 
which is estimated to rise 
by 9% in 2006, 
although growth rates have started to decelerate in recent months. Over the 
forecast period, world trade growth is projected to decline to a rate of 7% 
in 2008, reflecting mainly lower output growth. 
Commodity prices are expected to remain relatively high over the forecast 
period.  Compared with 2005, 
most commodity prices continue to rise, 
particularly base metals and fuels, refl
ecting strong demand growth.  
Overall, commodity prices are set to increase by more th
an 20% in 2006 
for the third year in a row. Oil prices reached a new record high at 
the beginning of August, with a 
barrel of Brent crude oil costing almost 80 USD. They fell back 
significantly thereafter as the risk of an extended conflict in the Middle 
East receded, tensions over Iran lessened, global demand for oil decreased 
and stocks in the US increased.  In fact, oil prices are now lower than they 
were at the beginning of 2006.  
However, a still relatively tight balance 
between supply and demand coupled with ongoing geopolitical risks 
suggests that prices could remain hi
gh.  Based on futures prices, oil is 
assumed to cost USD 65.8 per barrel in 
the second half of this year, before 
increasing gradually to around USD 68
.0 per barrel in the beginning of

2008 and stabilising thereafter.  This leads to an average of USD 65.6 per 
barrel for this year, USD 66.3 per barrel in 2007 and USD 68.0 per barrel 
in 2008.  This corr
esponds to an annual average increase of 21% this year 
and around 1% and 2½%, respectively, in 2007 and 2008. 
Liquidity remains ample by all pl
ausible measures. Both financial market 
and financing conditions continue 
to be favourable, supporting economic 
growth, although to a lesser degree than in 2005.  This follows from a 
global upturn in long-term bond yields since October 2005 and a 
tightening of monetary policy, with
 the ECB, for example, having hiked 
interest rates by 25 basis points five 
times since December last year.  
However, global long-term bond yiel
ds have declined somewhat since the 
summer, reflecting, in particular, concerns 
about the economic outlook for 
the United States.  The differential between the US and euro-area bond 
yields has gradually narrowed to sligh
tly below 100 basis points.  In the 
euro area, the yield curve has also flattened markedly, from a peak in May 
this year of around 120 basis points to above 30 basis points at present.  In 
the past, an inverted yield curve was a g
ood predictor of recessions, 
notably in the US. At th
e current juncture this predictive power is 
questioned by financial market particip
ants as the flattening of the yield 
curve is also driven by exceptionally 
low long-term rates, which could be 
attributed to the increased 
credibility of monetary policy.  
The low interest rates in past years have led to a strong growth in 
borrowing by the household sector, cont
ributing to a rapid accumulation of 
debt.  Looking ahead, this may give ri
se to concerns about
 whether current 
lending dynamics are sustainable.  Th
is, in turn, will crucially depend on 
future interest rate and housing price de
velopments. It is also important to 
take into account the sizeable differences that exist across Member States, 

both in terms of lending patterns, the 
share of variable-interest-rate loans, 
the degree of loan-to-value ratios etc. Based on mechanical extrapolations, 
there is little evidence of 
a sustainability problem fo
r the euro area as a 
whole, where household debt could rise from 60% of GDP in 2006 to 66% 
in 2008.  In some Member States, however, where debt starts from a higher 
level and rises at a faster pace (i.e. Sp
ain, Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal), a slowdown of credit gr
owth appears desirable.  
Growth differences across Member States, although remaining sizeable, 
narrowed in the first half of this year, particularly for euro-area Member 
States. However, differences between the recently acceded Member States 
and the EU-15 continue to be pr
onounced, largely due to the former's 
ongoing catching-up process in terms of GDP 
per capita
.  Among the 
larger Member States in the euro area, Spain posted the highest average 
quarterly growth rate in the first half of
 2006 (0.9%), followed by 
Germany, France and the Netherlands (0.8%) and Italy (0.6%).   
As a result of the pick-up in the fi
rst half of this year, the gap noted earlier 
between "hard" statistical data and the 
more optimistic "soft" survey data 
seems to have closed.  This is also ex
plained by a more mixed picture of 
recent survey indicators, following the general and strong upward trend 
from mid-2005 until July this year.  In most recent months, some indicators

have fallen (PMI services, ZEW), while others have remained broadly 
stable (the Commission's services confidence indicator, PMI 
manufacturing, NBB) or have recovered from a decline during summer 

(the Commission's industrial
 confidence indicator, IF
O).  Nevertheless, in 
view of the high levels across survey 
indicators, several of which are at or 
above their last peaks reached in 2000, the outlook is for a continued 

economic expansion (albeit more moderate).  
The Commission's investment survey suggests investment growth of some 
7% in 2006 in the euro-area manufacturing sector, which would be the 
highest rate in 7 years.  Consum
er confidence remain
ed largely unchanged 
over the summer, but points to increased spending for durable goods 

(except cars).  Retail confidence is 
currently at the same level as its 
previous all-time high (of June 2000) in the EU.  
The economic recovery, which remained subdued in its earlier phase, is 
now showing a marked acceleration, driven by domestic demand.  
Following the recent surge in invest
ment spending, the strength of 
investment growth has become more sim
ilar to a typical recovery.  The gap 
in the euro area between investment growth
 during this recovery and that 
during previous recoveries has narrowed from 5 pps. one year ago to 2 pps. 

by mid-2006.  In addition to favour
able financing conditions, wide profit 
margins and sound corporate balance sheets, steady increases in capacity 
utilisation rates should contribute to continued robust investment activity 
ahead. Consumer spending had initially been more moderate. In 2005, private 
consumption rose by 0.3% on average (q
uarter-on-quarter) in both the EU 
and the euro area.  Consumer spending accelerated to 0.7% (quarter-on-

quarter) in the first quarter of this year, mirroring an improved 
performance on the labour market. However, this pick-up was not 
sustained in the second quarter when consumption growth was halved.

This reflects, above all, a contraction in Germany (-0.4%) and a weak 
performance in Italy (0.2%) following 
the exceptionally strong first quarter 
outcome (+1.1% in Germany and +0.9% in Italy).  Information on e.g. 

household credit growth and retail trade data suggest that consumer 
spending continued to improve in the second half of this year. 
Export growth declined in 2005, reflecting an easing in the growth of 
global GDP and trade after the record high attained in 2004. However, 
more subdued export grow
th was also explained by a loss of market shares 
owing to the appreciation of the euro in real effective terms in the 
preceding years.  Following a reversal of the euro appreciation in 2005 and 
better-than-expected global growth, export
s grew more strongly in 2006. 
The contribution of net exports to GDP growth turned positive again in the 
first half of this year in both 
the EU and the euro area.  
In the light of positive su
rvey data it appears that 
the economies of the EU 
have taken significant momentum into
 the second half of 2006, leading to 
a sizeable carry-over for 2007. However, a large part of this statistical 

overhang will be offset in the first qu
arter of 2007 when quarterly growth 
will dwindle to ¼% under the impact 
of a drop in German output growth 
by 0.9%. The latter results mainly from 
the pay-back for the assumed 
spending spree by German households ahead of the VAT hike on 1 January 
2007. Net of the German VAT effect ou
tput growth in the first quarter of 
2007 would be only ma
rginally lower than in the last quarter 
of 2006.  This 
is also reflected in a marked difference in German survey data at present 
between the assessment of the current situation, which remains 

exceptionally upbeat, and expectations, 
which have generally declined.  
The forecast implies that underlying economic activity will ease slightly at 
the turn of the year, th
ough remaining at or sli
ghtly above potential 
throughout the forecast period. This deceleration must be seen in the light 
of the slight weakening
 of the world econo
my, reflecting mainly a 
slowdown in the United
 States, which will act to da
mpen export growth in 
the EU and the euro area. 
Net exports will nevertheless continue to give a 
small positive contribution to 
GDP growth, as import growth will decline 
in step with weaker growth in domestic demand.  
Growth of domestic demand is projected to ease slightly from its 
remarkable performance in 2006. In 20
07, this is almost exclusively due its 
decline in Germany, while it holds up
 well in most other countries. In 
2008, a moderate slowdown is proj
ected for a majority of countries, with 
domestic demand in Germany rebound
ing. Investment growth will slow 
down somewhat in 2007-2008. The cont
ribution of private consumption to 
overall growth in the euro area will remain around 1% throughout the 

forecast period, in line with the longer-term average (1¼% in the EU) .  
Compared with the recent past, the driving forces of domestic demand in 
the period ahead remain essentially unchanged. In particular, business 
investment will be supported by continued benign financing conditions, a 

healthy profit situation, increasingl
y stretched sp
are capacities and persistently high demand expectations. Ho

hold up well, although an incipient
 cooling of the housing markets in 
several Member States should slow do
wn housing starts later in the 
forecast period. Private consumption will be supported by reinvigorated 

household confidence, underpinned by
 a better outlook for disposable 
income due mainly to robust empl
oyment growth. Moreover, with the 
saving rate of households remaining 
essentially unchanged over the past 
couple of years, the improv
ed labour market situation, as reflected by a 
declining unemployment rate, togethe
r with a brighter medium-term 
outlook for public finances, should encourage consumers to increase 

spending beyond the rise in disposable income.  
The economic recovery has at last reached the labour market, leading to a 
strong upturn in employment growth to 
1.4% this year. This is the highest 
rate since 2000 and correspond
s to 2.9 million new jobs in the EU (1.9 
million in euro area). While easing somewhat, employment growth should 

remain robust at rates close to 1% 
per annum in the next two years. Job 
creation will be supported by an impr
oved production outlook together 
with a moderate increase in unit 
labour costs. In real terms, unit labour 
costs are expected to fall, continuing the trend of previous years.    
The fall in real unit labour costs over the forecast period is due to both 
moderate wage rises and a pick-up 
in labour productivity. Labour 
productivity growth is expected to average 1.1% during the forecast period 
in the euro area, double the rate observed on average in the period 2002-
2005 (a recovery is also proj
ected for the EU as a whole). While a 
significant part of this recovery is 
of a cyclical nature, a breakdown by 
sectors and countries indicates that a part of the acceleration is also due to 
longer-term factors such an increase in total factor productivity. 
The higher rate of job creation has 
had positive effects on unemployment. 
In the second quarter of this year, the unemployment rate in the euro area 
fell below 8%, for the first time in al
most 5 years, and was 8% for the EU

as whole. Unemployment is set to
 drop further to an average of 7.7% in 
2007 and 7.4% in 2
008 in the euro area 
(7.6% and 7.3% in the EU). The 
cyclical improvement of the labour market is the main factor behind this 

development, although a decline in 
the structural unemployment rate as 
measured by the euro-area NAIRU (from about 8%
 in 2005 to 7½% in 
2008) is also expected to contribute to lower unemployment.    
Driven by marked increases in energy prices headline inflation has 
remained above 2% in 2006, for the fifth year in a row as regards the euro 

area. Core inflation, on the other hand, has remained steady at a rate of 
around 1.5%, indicating that, so far, 
there have been very limited indirect 
and second-round effects of rising energy prices. However, some 
inflationary pressures have surface
d in producer prices, which have 
increased to almost 6% in mid-2006 from around 4% one year earlier. 
While most of this increase can be attributed to the energy component, 

other components such as intermediat
e goods and consumer goods have 
also seen rises during this period. In contrast, labour cost indicators 
continued to signal overall wage moderation, although a slight increase 

was observed in the second quarter of 2006.  
Despite lower inflationary impulses 
from commodity prices and a broadly 
unchanged output gap in 2006-2008, headline inflation in the euro area is 
expected to remain sligh
tly above the ECB’s inflation target in 2007, 
before dropping below this threshold in 2008. This profile is mainly due to 
the planned VAT increase in Germany which pushes the German headline 
inflation up in 2007. Th
e projections for the 
EU show headline inflation to 
be just above that of the euro area in both years. Divergence among 
Member States' inflation rates remains large, despite a projected narrowing 
over the forecast period, with the relativ
e position of high and low-inflation 
countries remaining 
basically unchanged.         
The forecast confirms a shift towards 
a generally brighter public finance 
outlook in the EU. 
In 2006, the budget deficit for the euro area is projected 
to be at 2% of GDP, down from 2.4% in 2005, mainly on the back of a 
strong and higher than previously ex
pected inflow of tax revenues. Based 
on the usual no-policy-change assumption, the deficit is set to remain on a 
declining path in the next two years reaching 1.5% in 2007, chiefly thanks 
to expenditure restraints, and 1.3% of GDP in 2008. Essentially the same 

profile is projected for the EU as a whole. 
In the euro area, the budgetary correction net of cyclical factors and one-
off and other temporary measures is estimated to be in line with the 
nominal improvement of about ¼ pp. in 2006 and ½ pp. in 2007. The 
estimated structural improvement 
for the EU is basically the same. 
Although the structural improvement in both the euro area and the EU 
proved relatively sound in 2006, Member States do not seem to have taken 
full advantage of the robu
st growth rate coupled with high tax elasticities 
this year.  Of the countries currently in ex
cessive deficit only Italy is expected to post 
a deterioration of the budgetary situation in 2006. The apparent

777Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 - 8 - 
deterioration is due to a recen
t ruling of the Eu
ropean Court of Justice 
which gives rise to sizeable tax refunds. Thanks to the mostly temporary 
effects of the ruling, higher-than-expected revenues and the projected 

impact of the 2007 draft budget, the deficit is estimated to decline 
marginally below the 3%-of-GDP threshold 
in 2007. Further measures will 
be needed to consolidate the result in 2008. In Greece, current policies are 
expected to halve the deficit this year from 5.2% of GDP in 2005 and to 
keep it below the 3%-of-GDP threshold over the forecast horizon. Portugal 
is likely to see a large improvement in
 the deficit in 2006
-2007, but present policies would not lead to a deficit below the 3%-of-GDP threshold by 
2008. Conversely, a consistent drop below 
the deficit limit of the Treaty is 
projected to take place in Germany and France. Among the other euro-area 

economies, Spain and Ireland are forecast to experience a noticeable 
decline in their nominal budget surp
lus. The same trend is visible in 
structural terms, although somewhat more subdu
ed in the case of Ireland. 
In Belgium, the projected deterioration of the nominal budget balance 
masks an improvement in structural terms. 
Outside the euro area, budgetary trends are somewhat more heterogeneous. 
Starting with the excessive deficit countries, there are only three out of six 
countries, namely Malta, Poland and the 
United Kingdom, for which the 
general government deficit is exp
ected to stay or fall below the 3%-of-
GDP threshold in 2006
. Under current policies the correction is projected 
to be relatively clear and lasting in the United Kingdom. As regards 
Poland, the deficit figures do not include the pension reform costs. The 
country benefits from the transitory period concerning the sectoral 

classification of second-pillar pension schemes. The re-classification of 
these schemes out of the governme
nt sector by April 2007 will lead to a 
significant deterioration 
in the deficit. In Slovakia, current policies are 
expected to further increase 
the deficit in 2006 and 
to bring it below the 
3%-of-GDP threshold only in 2008. In the Czech Republic, the deficit is 
projected to stay on a downward pat
h, but to remain above 3% of GDP 
throughout the forecast period. Current policies are forecast to lead to a 
further significant deterioration of the 
fiscal position in Hungary this year. 
The deficit is projected to climb above 10% of GDP in 2006, from 7.8% of 

GDP in 2005. Assuming that the recently announced budgetary measures 
are implemented in 2007 and produce part 
of their effect in 2008 the deficit 
will go down again to 5.6% of GDP in 2008.  
In the non-excessive deficit countries, th
e deficit in Cyprus is projected to 
stay below 2% of GDP throughout the forecast period. The budgetary 

projections for Denmark and Sweden point to continued surpluses, also 
including pension reform costs. 
In the Baltic countries, current policies are expected to keep the fiscal position 
within the marg
ins sufficient to 
safeguard against the risk of breachi
ng the 3%-of-GDP threshold.  
Following an increasing trend in recent years the debt ratio for the euro 
area is now expected to embark on a gradual downward path. Over the 
forecast period, the debt ratio is projected to decline by around 3.7 pps. to 

slightly below 67% of GDP in 2008. A similar development is forecast in 
8Overview - 9 - 
the EU, where the debt ratio is expected to come close to the 60%-of-GDP 
reference value.  
The downward trend for the euro area and the EU masks a few notable 
exceptions. In Hungary, on the back of the 
very high deficit projections, 
the debt ratio is expected to rise well above 70% of GDP in 2008, from 

around 62% of GDP in 2005. The debt
 ratio in Portugal is expected to 
climb to similar levels. In the case of
 Italy, the impact of the tax refunds 
mentioned above is expected to further increase the debt ratio to around 

107% of GDP in 2006, before corrective measures likely to reverse the 
trend take effect.  
Summing up, the economic outlook
 in the EU and the euro area is for a 
return to potential growth 
while inflation will gradually decline to 2% or 
slightly below by 2008. However, there are several risk factors to this 
outlook that need to be considered. 
On the external side, risk
s relate to world trade. 
While the US economy is 
slowing, there are few signs of a deceleration in Asia. In the event of a 
further re-composition of growth towards domestic demand, Asia might be 
in a better position to withstand a slow
down in the US than in the past, 
which could give an ad
ditional boost to growth in European export 
markets. On the other hand, importan
t global imbalances continue to 
prevail and risks of a disorderl
y unwinding have not abated.  
Furthermore, oil prices have come down by almost USD 20/barrel since 
their peak in early August. Chances are that oil prices could fall further 
over the forecasting period, which w
ould evidently be beneficial for the 
purchasing power of households and profit margins in the corporate sector. 

While slowing demand is expected to
 improve the supply-demand balance 
in the near term, in th
e current geopolitical envir
onment the possibility of 
tensions reigniting cannot be ruled out, thereby constituting an upward risk 

to oil prices. 
On the domestic side, 
upside risks are primarily linke
d to developments on 
the labour market. Continued po
sitive surprises on the labour market 
would have a direct effect on privat
e consumption via higher labour 
incomes but also boost consumer confidence, thereby strengthening the 

propensity to consume.  
A further upside risk is related
 to productivity developments. While part of 
the recent increase in labour produc
tivity growth is of a cyclical nature, 
ongoing reform efforts 
combined with rising inve
stment in ICT may also 
have led to structural improvement
s. As continued high productivity 
increases would boost the EU's attr
activeness for investors, gross fixed 
capital formation may continue 
to surprise on the upside. 
Inflation could turn out less benign th
an projected. In particular, with the 
labour market becoming tighter, wa
ges, which up to now have been 
surprisingly contained, ma
y start growing faster. 
Wage claims were on the 
rise in the first half of 2006 and may continue to be so in the near term. 
Upside and downside 
risks to the forecast 
999Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 - 10 - 
Higher wages could translate into higher consumer prices, which may 
prompt a response from monetary authorities that goes beyond what is 
assumed in the forecast. On the other hand, the effects of higher wage 

claims on inflation may be partly offse
t by the observed increase in labour 
productivity. Furthermore, despite a certain cooling
 in 2006, housing
 markets continue 
to be richly valued in a number of
 Member States and in the event of 
further interest hikes, a sign
ificant correction may occur. 
Overall, risks seem to be fairly balance
d, with upside risks slightly 
dominating in 2006, but downside 
risk becoming more pronounced further 
ahead. Most importantly, underlying th
e above baseline scenario is the 
assumption that the US economy will see 
a soft landing. There is, however, 
a risk of a more marked correction of the US housing market causing a 

sharper-than-assumed economic sl
owdown. Such a "harder-landing" 
scenario would in itself lower world ou
tput growth, but could have wider 
implications via a correction in 
asset prices, confidence linkages and 
possible downward pressure on the dollar. Based on simulations using the 
Commission's macroeconomic model, a harder landing in the US (lowering 
GDP growth in 2007-2008 by a cumulative 2½ pps. compared to the 

baseline scenario) could reduce GDP growt
h in the EU, depending on the 
assumption made, by between 0.3 and 
0.8 pp. over the same period. 
However, even if a harder landing of the US economy were to occur, the 
spill-over effects on the EU are likely to be
 milder than 
in 2001-2002, 
since the EU economy appears more resilien
t today than at the start of the 
decade.  This can be explained by several factors. First, the importance of 
the US as a destination for EU exports has declined in recent years, while 

export shares for the recently-acceded Member States, the oil-exporting 
countries and Asia, particularly China, have increased. Second, the 
recovery in the EU is increasingly based on domestic demand, with 
inter 
alia
 the long-term adjustment of the German 
construction sector having 
come to the poin
t where it may no longer constitute a drag on growth. 
Finally, in contrast to the downturn in 2001-2002, which was caused by a 

common shock following the bursting of the dot-com bubble, there is no 
reason to assume that, barring sizeable financial stress, a country-specific 
downturn in one housing market 
should spill over into others. 
Strong economic growth and substantial current account imbalances will 
remain the main features of both acceding and candidate countries during 

the forecast period. Improving consumer and business confidence is likely 
to translate into strong growth
 in private consumption and investment, 
while FDI inflows and workers remittan
ces will facilitate the financing of 
the significant current account deficits. The currently high energy and 
commodity prices are expected to lead to a temporary acceleration in 
inflation in most countries, wh
ich is likely to revert ho
wever in 2007 and 
2008. Public finances are likely to remain under control.  
In the candidate countries, output gr
owth will either remain relatively 
stable in Croatia (at around 4½% an
nually) and Turkey (6-6½%) or 
Acceding and candidate 
countries 101110Overview - 11 - 
accelerate in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (from 3¾% to 
5½%). In Turkey, the impact of the emerging markets crisis in mid-2006 
and the resulting increase in 
inflation and interest rates will reduce 
economic growth from more than 7% in
 the first half of 2006 to around 6% for the year as a whole. However, th
e positive impact of the depreciation 
on the price competitiveness of Turk
ish exporters will help to bring 
economic growth back to around 6½% during 2007-2008. In the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a relatively weak first half of 2006 is 
likely to keep economic growth below 4% this year. However, the 

improving business climate and measures ta
ken by the new government to 
stimulate growth should help the country to better realise its growth 
potential.  
The acceding countries appear to have entered a faster growth trajectory at 
above 5%, benefiting from accession-related investment and improving 

consumer confidence.  
Inflation is forecast to continue to decline in most countries, after higher 
energy prices, price liberalisations and one-off tax measures led to 
relatively strong increase in 
prices in 2006. In Tu
rkey, the depreciation of 
the currency will bring inflation back
 to above 10% in 2006. However, 
consumer price inflation will decelerate towards 6% by 2008. In Bulgaria, 
strong output growth and increasing 
bottlenecks in the 
labour market are 
likely to translate in stronger price rises by 2008.  
Unemployment is likely to decline in
 all five countries. Based on strong 
output growth, a considerable number of new jobs will be created. 
However, in view of the ongoing restru
cturing process, many jobs will be 
lost, resulting in a relatively low net 
increase of employment. As a result, 
unemployment is likely to decline, but only at a moderate pace. A stronger 
reduction in unemploymen
t is only expected in 
the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, albeit from a very high level. 
Public finances benefit from strong
 growth. General 
government deficits 
are likely to decline sligh
tly in Croatia, while in Turkey general elections 
in 2007 are expected to temporarily raise 
the deficit above 3% of GDP. In 
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Mace
donia planned tax reforms might 
lead to a temporary increase in the deficit above 1% of GDP. In Romania 

public finances are expected to deter
iorate towards 3% of GDP.  In 
Bulgaria, the public sector will continu
e to register surpluses, which will 
decline however from 3¼% of GDP in 2006 to 1¾% in 2008.  
Current account deficits are expected to remain significant, reflecting 
strong domestic demand, rising energy 
prices and strong capital inflows. 
This is particularly the case for the two acceding countries, where the 
current account deficit might be above 
12% of GDP by 2008. In Turkey 
and Croatia, the current account deficit is seen to reach 7% of GDP in 
2008, while in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia the widening 
of the external imbalance is expected to remain limited, at some 4% of 

GDP in 2008.  
111111Chapter 1 The world economy  13131. Rebalancing of global growth 
- 15 - 
The outlook for the global 
economy remains positive. 
After several years of strong
 growth, supported by a 
buoyant housing market, the 
US economy is slowing. 
However, growth in other regions, in particular 
emerging Asia, is set to remai
n robust.  All in all, the 
world economy is expected 
to slow slightly, from 
5.1% growth in 2006 (in purchasing-power-adjusted 
terms) to 4.6% in 2
007 and 4.7% in 2008. 
The outlook for a soft landing
 in the US coupled with 
continued robust growth momentum in other regions 

is supported by most survey indicators and financial 
indicators.  Recent gains in stock markets, following a 
correction in May, are indicative of a healthy financial 

position of corporations and continued positive 
growth expectations.  Th
e positive outlook has also 
been supported by the recent fall in energy prices, 

following the dramatic run-up
 in prices in the summer 
due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle-East.  The 
fall in long-term interest 
rates since July reflects the slowing of the US economy and the fact that 
inflationary expectati
ons remain contained. 
Robust world growth despite US slowdown 
While the indications are that the US economy is 
slowing, the recent data shows continued strong 
momentum in the global economy. The global 
manufacturing PMI indicator, which is normally a 

good indicator of world trade growth, suggests 
continued robust growth in the second half of the 
year.  Indicators of output growth and of the inflow of 

new orders seem to be stabilising at levels more in 
line with trend growth in
 the fourth quarter of 2006.

 However, the projected easing in global activity is 
mainly attributable to th
e slowdown of the US economy, related, in pa
rticular, to the effects of a 
cooling housing market on residential construction 
and consumer spending. Business indicators for Asia 
and Europe remain strong, suggesting some 

rebalancing of growth away from the US. While the 
slowdown of the US economy is likely to dampen 
world growth somewhat, other regions are not likely 

to experience a similar 
slowdown, in contrast to the 
global slowdown at the start of the millennium. 
Growth in global imports 
of goods and services (excl. 
the EU) is set to average 8.
8% in 2006, moderating to 
8.2% in 2007 and 7.7% in 2008.  The contribution of 
the US to global imports growth (excl. the EU) is set 
to decline from 1.7 pp in 2006 to 1.2 pp in 2007, 

while the contribution of Japan and the rest of Asia is 
projected to remain constant.

 Broader indices, however, 
such as the S&P 500 index, 
remain some way from their all-time highs. The 
positive trend in equity 
markets reflects the healthy 
financial position of co
rporations and continued 
positive growth expectations
, with the US economy 
expected to stage a soft landing. A caveat to the 

positive outlook may be th
at the vulnerability seen in 
May could be indicative of predominantly downside 
risks, as risk premiums incorporated in asset prices 

continue to be at 
historically low levels. Support from the recent fall in oil prices  
Oil prices continued to 
surge over the summer reaching a new record of just below 80 USD/bl. in 
early August. The surge was 
driven by geopolitical 
tensions in the Middle-East, 
with fears of possible 
severe supply disruptions along with supply 
disruptions in Alaska. With the easing of these 

tensions, combined with downward adjustments in the 
demand growth projections by the International 
Energy Agency, a milder than usual hurricane season 
in the Gulf of Mexico, and higher-than-expected oil 
stocks in the OECD countrie
s, the price of oil has 
dropped significantly, to below 60 USD/bl. in 
October.  Oil prices are nevertheless expected to remain 
relatively high over the forecast period, in view of the 

still-tight balance between supply and demand, and 
additional supply coming 
on-stream only slowly. The 
forecast assumes, based on futures prices, the price of 
a barrel of Brent to average 65.6 USD/bl. in 2006, 
66.3 USD/bl. in 2007 and 68 USD/bl. in 2008.  
Compared with the spring forecast assumption the oil 

price assumption for 2007 
is about 4.7 USD/bl. lower.

However, following the evidence of a deceleration of 
the US economy long-term bond yields have come 
down. This results from the 
increasing likelihood that 
the US Federal Reserve is close to the end of the 
tightening cycle, with the weight of the US economy 
in the global economy
 causing spill-over effects to 
yields in other bond markets. The yield curve 
(depicting yields of bonds 
of different maturities) has 
become increasingly inverted in the US as long-term 

interest rates have fallen while short-term interest 
rates have continued to rise
. This could suggest that 
financial markets believe 
that the US economy will 
achieve a soft landing with receding inflationary 
pressures, allowing the Federal Reserve to begin 
easing interest rates. A
nother, less sanguine, 
interpretation could be that
 the US economy is bound 
for a harder landing, as an inverted yield curve is 
normally seen as a recession indicator.

 The euro has appreciated against major currencies 
The beginning of monetary tightening, in line with an 
improved growth outlook in the euro area, has seen 
the exchange rate of the euro appreciate against the 
major currencies.   
Against the Japanese yen in particular, the euro has 
continued to appreciate, which contrasts with what 
real exchange rate indicators would suggest. Despite 
some turbulence in a few emerging market currencies, 

following the jitters in 
global equity markets, 
emerging market economies continue to benefit from 
easy financial conditions supporting the positive 

growth outlook.

 Risks are tilted to the downside 
While the general outlook
 for the world economy 
continues to be positive, risks are tilted to the 
downside. The slowdown in the US economy, in 

particular, could prove harder than expected. 
Considering the importance 
of US financial markets 
and global current account imbalances, this could 

have implications for the risk preferences of investors 
and lead to a correction in asset prices, possibly 
similar to the developme
nts seen in May this year.  
Outlook by region 
Despite high oil prices, GDP growth in the first half 
of 2006 was surprisingly strong. This should lead to 
an annual growth figure of around 5% for the year as 

a whole, which is almost half a percentage point 
higher than foreseen in the spring forecast. The 
upward revision is mainly
 explained by stronger than 
expected growth in the US, 
Asia (excl. Japan) and the oil-exporting countries. While th
e US economy is 
likely to experience a period of slower growth over 

the forecast period, growth in the rest of the world is 
expected to keep up well, thus contributing to a 
rebalancing of global growth. As a result, the world 

economy is projected to expand at a rate slightly 
above 4½% in 2007-08. 
In line with the slight 
moderation in the pace of global economic growth, 

world trade is also expected to gradually decelerate 
from an expected annual rate of around 8% in 2006 to 
around 7% in 2007-08. 
The US economy
, which has been one of the main 
engines of global growth in recent years, is expected 
171717Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 - 18 - 
to lose some of its steam over the forecast period.  
The slowdown is already evident in the cooling 
housing market.  Residen
tial investment is already 
contracting sharply and the spill-over to consumer 
spending is expected to 
become evident towards the 
end of this year.  Moderate employment growth and 

rising disposable income
s should, however, provide 
some offsetting support to consumer spending.  These 
developments are expected to translate into an annual 

GDP growth rate of 2.3% in 2007, before the 
economy recover
s to 2.8% in 2008. 
The Japanese economy
 expanded briskly in the first 
half of 2006, driven main
ly by domestic demand. 
Consumption was supported by rising confidence and 
better employment prospects while buoyant profits 
and a turnaround in bank credit have triggered an 

increase in investment.  This should lead to GDP 
growth of around 2.7% in 2006 as a whole.  Although 
risks remain, in particular on
 the external side, the 
economy is expected to continue to expand steadily 
over the forecast period, with GDP growth exceeding 
2% in both 2007 and 2008. 
Economic growth in the 
rest of Asia
 is expected to 
continue on a strong footing over the forecast period. 
Real GDP is expected to increase by 8.4% in 2006, 

before moderating to around 8.0% in 2007 and 2008. 
This is in line with decelerating growth in the US, and 
the impact of past oil price increases. However, the 

aggregated regional growt
h figures mask variations 
across the different economies.  
China's
 economic growth continues to be very strong 
in 2006. After a growth rate of 10.2% in 2005, GDP 

growth accelerated to 10.9% year-on-year in the first 
half of 2006. Key factors behind this higher-than-
expected growth were net merchandise exports and a 

reacceleration of investment spending. China's 
economic growth slightly slo
wed in the third quarter, 
to 10.4% yoy, reflecting a 
tightening of investment 
rules and monetary policy. Ch
ina's economic growth 
is expected to ease in th
e last quarter of 2006 and in 
2007, reflecting earlier policy measures to rein in 
investment growth as well 
as likely further tightening 
moves, alongside an expected moderation in external 

demand. As a result, GDP growth is likely to average 
10.4% in 2006, before slowing to about 9¾% in 2007 
and 2008.   The trade and current account surpluses are set to 
exceed last year's record in 2006 and to grow in the 
coming years, although stabilising at slightly above 
7½% of GDP. 
Growth in 
India is also projected to gradually ease 
over the forecast period, from 8.1% in 2006 to 7.4% 

and 7.3% in 2007 and 2008, respectively.  The 
sustained momentum in the economy and high oil 
prices have led to a tightening of monetary conditions 

by the authorities which should have an impact over 
the latter part of the forecast horizon.  Whilst 
Korea and Singapore
 are also forecast to slow modestly 
over the forecast period, economic growth in the 
ASEAN-4
 is projected to accelerate, owing in part to 
buoyant export growth to China and strengthening 

intra-regional trade linkages.  
Economic growth in the 
EFTA countries is expected 
to remain robust over the forecast period. Growth in 
Norway
 is set to reach 3% in 2006, before moderating 
somewhat to below 2½% in 
2007 and 2008. Domestic 
activity should continue to be the main driver of 
growth, supported by strong private consumption and 

high investment spending in
 the offshore oil and gas 
sector. Switzerland's
 economy is expected to grow 
by 2.7% in 2006, due to strong external demand. In 
2007 and 2008, moderated export growth would 
prompt a return to GDP growth under 2%. 
Economic growth in the Cand
idate Countries is set to 
remain strong.  Turkey is lik
ely to have weathered the 
financial market turbulen
ce in the spring with GDP 
growth set to reach about 6% in 2006. In 2007 and 

2008 Turkey should experie
nce growth around 
potential, with improved price competitiveness 
benefiting exports growth.  In 
Croatia
 and the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
, GDP 
growth is likely to be at around 4-5½%, driven by 
strong domestic demand growth, especially private 

consumption and investment. Strong domestic 
demand is likely to translate into substantial external 
imbalances, which however are expected to be largely 

covered by capital inflows, in particular by FDI, and 
by workers' remittances. 
The CIS region
 is expected to remain the second-
fastest-growing region, with economic growth likely 
to exceed 7% in 2006 and projected to remain at 
around 6¾% in 2007-08. Economic growth in 
Russia
 is expected to reach 6.7% in 2006 thanks to the 
continued increase in energy prices and robust growth 
in domestic demand. The upward revision of growth 

is limited by the reduced c
ontribution to growth of net 
181918Chapter 1 The world economy 
- 19 - 
exports, and in 2007 
and 2008 growth
 is predicted to 
decelerate to slightly less than 6½%. Economic 
growth in the 
other CIS
 countries is expected to 
rebound to 8.1% in 2006, having slowed down to 
6.4% in 2005 from 11% in 2004. The strengthening of 
growth in the region reflects primarily 
Ukraine's
 recovery from last 
year's slowdown. 
Economic growth in 
Latin America is expected to 
reach 4¾% in 2006, after a strong first half of the 
year. With domestic demand relatively strong and 

external conditions 
remaining relatively favourable 
(strong global demand, high commodity prices and 
benign financing conditions), growth in the region is 

expected to be between 3¾-4% over the forecast 
period. The resilience of some economies have 
increased, partly due to improved fiscal management, 

but the region remains vulnerable to external shocks, 
such as an unexpectedly sharp slowdown in Asia or 
the US and variations in commodity prices.  
The MENA region
 is expected to grow strongly over 
the forecast period, with real GDP growth of 5½% in 
2006 and remaining above 5% in 2007 and 2008. In 
Saudi Arabia and the Un
ited Arab Emirates (UAE), 
buoyant domestic demand is underpinned by 
strengthened oil export 
revenues, which finance 
significant increases in pub
lic spending.  The negative 
impact of the considerable stock market slides across 
the region in the first half 
of 2006 should be modest, 
due to the relatively limited market capitalisation.  

The economic impact of
 ongoing geopolitical 
uncertainties and regional conflicts remain uncertain.  
If stability improves, however, a period of higher 

growth is to be expected, 
but risks and uncertainty 
continue to be high. 
 In 2006, growth in 
sub-Saharan Africa
 is likely to 
decelerate slightly to 4.6%, due to slower export 
growth. Oil production in this region is likely to 
stagnate in 2006 due to tem
porary technical problems 
and delays in the introduction of new facilities. 
However, high external demand for other 
commodities should
 support growth
. In 2007, exports 
are set to pick up strongly, as capacity constraints in 
the oil sector are progressively eased, leading to a 
marked pick-up of growth in the region in 2007, with 
GDP forecast to reach 6%. In 2008 growth should 
decelerate slightly, to 5½%, following the expected 

moderation of global growth.

Growth is finally accelerating– 
After the protracted period of slow recovery between 
mid-2003 and end-2005 with an average annual GDP 
growth rate of 1.3% in the euro area and 1.7% in the 

EU, the pace of economic expansion changed gear at 
the beginning of 2006 in both regions. Quarter-on-
quarter GDP growth rose from 0.3% in the last quarter 
of 2005 in the euro area (0.5% in the EU) to 0.8% in 
the first quarter in both regions, strengthening further 
to 0.9% in the second quarter. It was the highest pace 

of expansion since the second quarter of 2000 and a 
better outturn than projected in the Commission 
services' spring 2006 forecasts. As a result, the 

carryover for annual GDP growth in 2006 increased to 
2.2% in the euro area and 2.3% in the EU.  
GDP growth in the first half of 2006 was well above 
potential. The underlying growth momentum, as 

measured by the year-on-year rate of change in GDP, 
rose in the euro area from 1.8% in the last quarter of 
2005 to 2.6% in the second quarter of 2006 (from 

2.1% to 2.8% in the EU), the best reading since early 
2001.  As a result of this robust performance, the gap 
between upbeat survey data and mixed hard data, 
which was observed at the beginning of the year, 
seems to have largely closed by now.

  However, some uncertainties abou
t the strength of the 
upturn in the first half of 2006 remain. Particularly, 
varying calendar factors have created doubts about 

whether the underlying growth momentum is 
accurately depicted by the profile of quarterly output 
growth. High volatility of 
inventory building has 
added to the difficulties in interpreting the data. In 
addition, special factors bo
osted growth in the second 
quarter: the football World Cup, for example, as well 

as the second-quarter correction in construction 
following depressed constructi
on activity in the first 
quarter due to bad weather conditions. Nonetheless, 
there has been an impressive acceleration of 
underlying economic growth since the summer 2005.  
–and appears more broadly based and well-
rooted The heightened growth momentum was accompanied 
by an encouraging broadening of the recovery. The 
breakdown of euro-area GDP by demand component 
shows that domestic demand (excluding inventories) 

was a significant stimulus in 
the pick-up of activity in 
the first half of 2006 with an average (quarter-on-
quarter) contribution of 0.7 
pp. compared to 0.4 pp. in 
2005. Net trade accounted for a smaller fraction (0.2 
pp.) of growth, but had still strongly improved 

compared with last year's negative performance.

Outside the euro area, GDP expanded by 1.1% in 
Poland, 0.9% in Hungary and 0.7% in the UK. In 
addition, variations in GDP growth rates have 

somewhat decreased in recent quarters, particularly 
among the four largest euro-area Member States. In 
the first half of 2005, 
the difference in growth 
between the best- and the worst-performing country 
amounted to almost 1 full pp. By the second quarter 
of 2006, this gap had 
reduced to 1/3 pp.  
The upturn is underpinned by robust 
investment– Domestic demand was primarily dr
iven by a surge in 
investment spending. Gross 
fixed capital formation, 
which on average increased at a quarter-on-quarter 

rate of 0.8% in the euro area in 2005, accelerated to a 
rate of 2.1% in the second quarter, up from 1% in the 
first quarter. In a cyclical perspective, one year ago 

the gap between the cumulative investment growth in 
this recovery and the previo
us (four) euro-area 
recoveries amounted to 5 pps. 
By now, this gap has 
narrowed to around 2½
 pps. With steady increases in 
capacity utilisation rates, reported at 84% in the fourth 
quarter (exceeding the long-term average of 82% by a 
significant margin), the near-term outlook remains 
favourable.

 Buoyant corporate capital spending in the first half of 
2006 is confirmed by the Commission's bi-annual 
investment survey, which poi
nts to growth rates last 
seen at the end of the nineties, and in line with the 

elevated levels of business confidence. The rising 
trend in gross fixed cap
ital formation came hand in 
hand with an strong turnaround in corporate 
profitability during the last two years, owing to 
moderate increases in labour costs and, more recently, 

to a remarkable rise in labour productivity growth.

Labour productivity and real unit labour costs,
                    euro area 
 Developments in real unit 
labour costs, which may be 
interpreted as an inverted m
easure of profit margins, 
have been conducive to investment growth in recent 
years, with an almost uninterrupted decline since mid-

2003. This trend continued in
 the first half of 2006, 
when real unit labour costs fell by almost 1% (year-
on-year). As discussed in section 4, labour costs have 
benefited from a substantial moderation of wage 
dynamics. The annual growth rate in compensation 

per employee in nominal terms was 2% last year 
(down from 2.4% in 2004) and a similar moderate 
pace of growth is estimated for the first half of 2006. 

While there is evidence of a mild acceleration of 
wages in specific sectors of the euro area economy, 
this pick-up has to be assessed against the recent 

rebound of labour productivity which is having a 
dampening effect on labour costs. Labour productivity 
in the euro area rose at an annualised pace of about 

2% in the first half of 2006. This is significantly 
above the average annual growth of 0.7% for the 
previous five years.  
On the financial side,
 credit to non-financial 
corporations rose at an annual rate of almost 11% 
(year-on-year) in the second quarter of 2006, the 
highest growth since 2001. Refinancing conditions in 

the corporate sector remain growth-supportive despite 
the upward movement in interest rates. The ECB's 
latest Bank Lending Survey showed broadly 
242524Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
- 25 - 
unchanged credit standards for loans to enterprises in 
the first half of 2006. Credit standards for loans are 
expected to remain unchanged also in the third 

quarter. While the real cost of equity-based financing 
increased somewhat in the second half of 2006, 
largely reflecting adverse st
ock market developments, 
the overall cost of 
external financing remains low by 
historical standards and is currently estimated at 
below 4%. 
–signs of awakening for consumption and–  
Private consumption increased on average by just 
0.3% (quarter-on-quarter) in 2005 in both the euro 
area and the EU. However, consumer spending 
accelerated to a quarterly rate of 0.7% in the first 

quarter of 2006 in both regions, the strongest growth 
rate since 2001. This pick-up was not confirmed in the 
second quarter when private consumption growth fell 

back to 0.3%. Hence, evidence of a sustained pick-up 
in private consumption is 
still not very robust.  However, the slowdown in 
the second quarter should 
be interpreted with caution
 as it was mainly the result 
of a significant contractio
n of household spending in 
Germany (-0.4%) and a weak performance in Italy 

(0.2%). In contrast, consumption accelerated in Spain 
(0.8%), remained resilient in
 France (0.7%) and 
bounced back in the Netherlands (0.4%). The 

weakness of consumption in Germany and Italy in the 
second quarter might have b
een a correction to the 
strong pick-up in the fi
rst quarter (of 1.1% in 
Germany and 0.9% in Italy). 
In addition, consumption 
in Germany has tended to 
be rather volatile in the last 
few quarters, possibly affected by unaccounted 

seasonal factors.  
Accordingly, for an assessment of recent consumption 
developments in the euro area it seems best to look at 
the first two quarters of 20
06 jointly. Indeed, when 
looking at growth of private consumption in the first 
half of 2006 a significant acceleration vis-à-vis 2005 
can be observed from an annual pace of 1.4% to an 

annualised rate of 1.9%.  
The strengthening of private 
consumption in the euro 
area owes much to the improved performance of the 
labour market. Compared to a growth rate of just 
0.7% last year (0.9% 
in the EU), employment 
accelerated at an annual pace of 1.5% in the first half 

of 2006, the strongest increase since the second half 
of 2000. In parallel, employment expectations have 
improved substantially since the summer of last year 
and the outlook for employment based on survey data 
points to robust job creation also in the second half of 

2006.  0.0

. At the same time, the une
mployment rate declined to 
7.9% in the second quarter of 2006, the lowest rate 
since late 2001. These developments had a very 
positive effect on households' unemployment 

expectations, which 
declined markedly 
over the past 
12 months. With unemploym
ent expectations being a 
component of the overall consumer confidence 
indicator this has contributed to a strengthening of 
consumer sentiment. Visibly more optimistic 

household expectations should have a positive impact 
on the propensity 
to consume. 
Indeed, consumer spending in the first half of 2006 
seems to have been supported by a decline in the 

saving rate. Lack of quart
erly data on disposable 
income for the euro area as a whole prevents a 
comprehensive assessment of cyclical movements in 

income and savings. Neverthe
less, indirect evidence 
suggests that consumption growth outpaced (labour) 
income growth in the 
first half of 2006. Private 
consumption expanded by 1.9% (annualised) 
compared to a 1.5% pick-up in employment and 
slightly declining real co
mpensation per head. 
The recent decline in th
e saving rate contrasts with 
developments observed at the beginning of this 
decade. The longer-term trend of a declining saving 
rate started to reverse in 2000, and the saving rate 
peaked at around 15% of disposable income in 2002. 
252525Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 - 26 - 
In the following two years it remained broadly 
unchanged. This was a reflection of several factors, 
including distortions in
 inflation perceptions 
following the introduction of 
the euro and concerns 
about the sustainability of public pensions and 
healthcare systems. These factors more than offset the 

downward pressure on savi
ngs exerted by EMU via 
lower interest rates and financial liberalisation. Last 
year, however, the saving rate declined by around 

½ pp. and a further decline is envisaged for 2006. 
Sustained improvements in consumer confidence may 
be a factor behind this decline. In addition, structural 

reforms may start to have a positive effect on 
households' confidence, thereby affecting 
consumption in a growth-supportive manner.

 The acceleration of private consumption growth in the 
first half of 2006 was accompanied by a continued 
high level of liquidity and robust credit growth in the 
euro-area economy. The annual growth rate of loans 

to the household sector rose by 9.7% in the second 
quarter of 2006. The main
 contribution to this 
expansion came from lending to households for house 

purchases, which grew at an annual rate of 12%. 
However, consumer credit growth also ran at an 
annualised pace of more than 8%. These 

developments can be seen as a response to the 
historically very low level of interest rates. In some 
Member States, consumpti
on benefited from rising 
property markets. However, as argued in section 2, in 
an environment of rising interest rates, there are some 
concerns about possibl
e adverse effects on 
consumption (and investment), particularly in 
Member States where variable-interest-rate mortgages 
predominate. 
–softening, but still supportive contribution from 
foreign demand 
After having reduced output growth during the second 
half of 2005, the contribution of net exports turned 
positive in the first quarter of 2006 in both the euro 

area and the EU (at 0.5 and 0.3 pp. respectively). In 
the subsequent quarter, however, the growth rate of 
exports decelerated, outpacing the weakening of 

imports. This reduced the net contribution of foreign 
demand to just 0.1 pp. in both the euro area and the 
EU.  The slowdown of exports in
 the second quarter should 
be interpreted with caution 
as trade data tend to be 
volatile and frequently revised in subsequent releases 
of National Accounts. The underlying trend, as 

measured by the year-on-year rate of growth, showed 
a pick-up of euro-area exports by 9.7% (annualised) 
in the first half of 200
6, well above last year's 
performance. Robust export growth was consistent 
with growth in world trade wh
ich ran at an annualised 
pace of 7.1% during the same period. In line with the 
strengthening of final dema
nd, the underlying trend of 
import growth also rose in the 
first half of 2006 (8.1% 
compared with 5.3% last year). 
Nonetheless, signs of moderation in world GDP 
growth in key industrial countries have emerged 
recently, particularly in the US (see chapter 1). Survey 

data generally point to an easing of growth in the 
short-term. The Quarterly World Economic Survey 
indicates a deterioration 
in expectations for world 
growth in the second half of the year. Similarly, the 
indicator for world export
s in the Global Purchasing 
Managers' Index declined at the beginning of the third 

quarter of 2006. In addition, in the euro area export 
growth is likely to be reduced
 by lagged effects of the 
(moderate) appreciation of the euro since the 

beginning of the year, which has affected the cost 
competitiveness of 
euro-area exporters. However, even though the support from the global 
economy to euro-area GDP 
growth is likely to be 
more limited in the coming quarters compared with 
the recent past, the outlook for a continuation of 

economic growth looks solid as it appears less 
dependent on external demand. 
2627262. Patterns of non-financial private sector 
lending and house price dynamics: are 
they sustainable? - 27 - 
Although interest rates have risen in recent months, 
borrowing by households and non-financial 
corporations remains brisk. High credit demand 

reflects in part an acceleration of economic activity 
and higher spending outlays, thus supporting domestic 
demand. Another factor behind recent credit growth is 

the dynamism in house price developments in some 
euro-area Member States. Ever higher house prices in 
such countries are propelling household sector credit 

growth. Dynamic housing activity is also fuelling loan 
demand by non-financial corporations, notably in the 
construction sector. Risi
ng M&A activity is another 
driver of corporate borrowing. However, if interest 
rates rise and household sector fundamentals 
deteriorate buoyant patterns of debt growth and 

related dynamic house pri
ce developments might 
become increasingly unsustainable.   
Households are accumulating debt– 
While the euro area as a whole is experiencing a 
robust pace of household sector borrowing, lending 

growth is spread unevenly across Member States. 
Overall household sector borrowing (including bank 
and non-bank lending) was advancing at close to 10% 
y-o-y in the beginning of 2006, slightly below the 
previous peak in the late 1990s. When measured 

against GDP, though, the 4-qu
arter moving total debt 
growth has already slightly surpassed its previous 
1999 peak level, running at above 5% of GDP.

 Data on bank lending (m

institutions, excluding the eurosystem
) suggest that 
the trend of strong growth is persisting, although the 
rate of credit growth has come down from the 
elevated levels recorded earlier in the year. However, 
the euro-area average masks important differences at 

country level. While y-o-y ra
tes are running at 20% or

Germany is below 1%.

ECB, Commission services calculations 
 The fundamental drivers of household sector 
borrowing are increasing house prices and ever higher 
loans to finance their purchase, making banks' profits 
increasingly dependen
t on this loan category. 
Mortgage lending, traditionally the most important 
lending component of household sector borrowing, 
has reached about 70% of all bank lending to the 

household sector in 2006, up from around 60% in 
1999, and constitutes more 
than 32% of overall bank 
lending to euro-area residents (up form 26% in 1999).  
Households have been able to finance increasing 
house prices owing to changes in conditions since the 
mid-1990s. First, the adoption of the euro 
 over and 
above favourable global liquidity conditions 
 was 
associated with a very
 substantial downward 
convergence in interest 
rates and risk premia, 
allowing several Member States (notably Greece, 

Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal) to gain increasing 
access to external bank lending. Second, above- 
average inflation rates in some Member States have 
lowered real interest rates, provid
ing an additional 
boost to credit demand. This pro-cyclical effect of real 

interest rates may have been reinforced by the mutual 
interaction between real interest rates and house 
prices (low real interest rates fuel demand for 

housing, leading to a ri
se in house prices which 
272727Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 - 28 - 
pushes up growth and inflation via wealth effects and 
further depresses real interest rates). Third, 
demographic developments have been more 

supportive of demand for housing and mortgages in 
some Member States than others due, for instance, to 
significant immigration fl
ows (e.g. Ireland and Spain) 
or faster population growth in household formation 
cohorts (e.g. Ireland, Spain, 
the Netherlands and 
France). Fourth, the increase in household borrowing 

for house purchase may reflect differences and 
changes in Member States' mortgage markets, which 
have offered households expanded access to credit 

through (i) longer repayment periods, (ii) higher loan-
to-value ratios, (iii) an in
creasing share of variable-
interest-rate loans, (iv) equ
ity withdrawal possibilities 
in some Member States, while, furthermore, (v) 
mortgage bonds and debt
 securitisation have allowed 
financing institutions to
 receive additional funding. 
Fifth, the current lending bo
om is also supported by 
bank competition and easing credit conditions in line 
with subdued levels of defaults on mortgage loans, 
thus adding an element of pro-cyclicality. 
–but its sustainability is an issue 
There are increasing doubts concerning the 
sustainability of current lending patterns and house 

price dynamics, specifically in those countries, where 
these dynamics have been particularly strong in recent 
years. These concerns are related to
 the outlook of 
rising interest rates and 
to current debt dynamics. 
While for the euro area as a whole rising interest rates 
do not seem to pose an imme
diate risk, household 
sectors in countries where variable-interest-rate 

mortgages dominate will be strongly affected by 
rising financing costs. Dat
a provided by the ECB 
suggests that over 90% of mortgage loans are 
variable-rate contracts in Po
rtugal and Finland and 
over 80% in Spain, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg and 
Italy. In contrast, loans 
linked to short-term rates are 
less common in Belgium, Germany, France and the 

Netherlands. Table 2.2

 Another concern relates to 
household debt dynamics. 
While it may be difficult to determine the point at 
which a given amount of debt becomes impossible to 

service, extrapolating current trends in accumulation 
of debt suggests that several Member States are facing 
an unprecedented additional debt burden on the part 

of households.  
Based on mechanical extrapolations, household debt 
to GDP will increase until e
nd-2008 to about 140% of 
GDP in the Netherlands, ab
out 125% of GDP in 
Ireland, and about 100% of GDP in Spain and 
Portugal. In contrast, the increase in debt ratios will 
remain relatively limited in Belgium and in France 

(roughly 50%) and in Italy (41%). Germany and 
Luxembourg are the only 
countries, where the 
household debt ratios 
will decline (slightly) in that 
period. When measured against
 gross disposable 
income, the household sector debt ratio is projected to 

reach about 290% in the Netherlands, 230% in Ireland 
and 160% in Spain at the end of 2008. Debt to 
disposable income will ri
se to about 100% in Austria

In sum, the analysis sugg
ests that, in a number of 
Member States, current trends are hardly sustainable. 
Indeed the growth of credit has slowed down recently: 

since March 2006, when the current peak in euro-area 
household credit was measured, annual y-o-y growth 
rates have come down, some
times significantly, in 
almost all euro-area Member States. It remains to be 
seen if the slowdown 
is sustained.   The risks of buoyant lending and house price 
dynamics have increased and 
a possible slowdown 
might affect growth. A slowdo
wn in current trends 
would affect activity via two 
main channels: (i) a 
slowdown in private consump
tion and (ii) a slowdown in residential construction
. Lower lending demand 
would likely also affect 
bank profitability. Moreover, highly indebted households may face the risk of 

severe financial distress in case of a sharp increase in 
interest rates.  Non-financial corporations are accumulating new 
debt in the face of rising interest rates 
Demand for external funding in the euro-area 
corporate sector is accelerating, but remains well 
below the levels recorded in the late 1990s. Recent 

data suggest a quickening in
 non-financial corporate 
sector borrowing, which is consistent with the 
evidence of a recovery in private investment. The 

determinants of rising dem
and for external funding 
among firms are increasingly broad-based, as 
indicated in the ECB ban
k lending survey for July. 
Among the factors cited are the need to fund M&A 
activity and corporate rest
ructuring, inventory 
accumulation, and, increasingly, the need to finance 

new fixed investments. Housi
ng-related developments 
are also likely to fuel the borrowing boom in the 
corporate sector, notably in
 construction related 
activities. However, aggregate data for the euro area 
hide substantial differences 
at the Member-State level. 
August bank lending da
ta suggest that the y-o-y 
growth in credit extended to the corporate sector is 
especially strong in Irelan
d (34%) and Spain (29%), 
but has remained rather weak in Germany (3%).  
This recent increase in demand for external funding is 
set to push corporate debt
 levels to new highs, raising 
questions about the adequacy of balance-sheet 

consolidation in earlier 
years. Data releases for 2006-Q1 indicate that the accumulated debt of the euro-area 
non-financial corporate sect
or is now equivalent to 
about 65% of GDP and evidence suggests a further 
rise in the course of 2006. 
Coming after a prolonged 
period of largely constant debt levels, the recent 
upward trend in the debt-to-GDP ratio raises 
questions about the effects on
 investment outlays in 
the event of a sharper-than-expected hike in interest 
rates. Net interest payments in the euro-area corporate 
sector moved above 1.6% of GDP in the second 

quarter of 2006, reversing a downward trend that had 
lasted several years.

 As interest rates rise, the cost of rolling over the still 
substantial portion of short-term and maturing longer-
term corporate debt rises correspondingly. It may be 
argued that the efforts towards increasing 
liberalisation, integration and innovation in the EU 
financial sector in recent years have allowed for a 

higher equilibrium level of 
corporate debt. If this is 
correct, it would seem unlikely that a moderate rise in 
interest rates will impact significantly on investment 

decisions in the period ahe
ad, given the expected 
momentum of the recovery. However, in the event of 
a sharper-than-expected rise in interest rates, possibly 

combined with a housing market correction affecting 
the construction sector, the 
implications of high debt 
levels could be of greater concern in some euro-area 

Member States. 
292929Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 - 30 - 
Box 2.1:
  Some specificities behind the forecasts  
 Exchange rates 
For currencies in ERM II as well as for Bulgaria, constant 
nominal exchange rates are assumed. This means that the 
central rate of these currencies against the euro will remain 
constant over the forecast period. The ERM currencies are: 
the DKK (Danish krone), the EEK (Estonian kroon), the 
CYP (Cyprus pound), the LVL (Latvian lats), the LTL 
(Lithuanian litas), the MTL (Maltese lira) and the SKK 
(Slovakian koruna). Constant real effective exchange rates 
(that is, nominal rates adjusted for changes in GDP deflators) 
are assumed for all the other countries/areas, i.e. the euro, the 
CZK (Czech koruna), the HUF (Hungarian forint), the PLN 
(Polish zloty), the SEK (Swedish krona), and the GBP 
(sterling), and for non-EU currencies.  
The reference period used for the exchange rate constancy 
assumption is the fourth quarter of 2006, calculated on the 
basis of the average of a two-week reference period (2 to 16 
October 2006). This technical assumption yields the average 
USD/EUR rate 1.26 and the average JPY/EUR rate 149.8. 
This, in turn, leads to implied average USD/EUR rates of 
1.25 in 2006, 1.27 in 2007 and 1.27 in 2008, and average 
JPY/EUR rates of 145.5 in 2006, 147.6 in 2007 and 144.6 in 
2008.  Interest rates 
Short-term interest rates are set in order to reflect the price 
stability objective of monetary policy. Long-term interest 
rate assumptions are based on developments in short-term 
rates and an assessment of economic conditions. Attention is 
paid to international financial linkages, market expectations 
and budgetary developments. 
Commodity prices 
Commodity prices are forecast taking into account market 
conditions. In the case of oil prices special attention is paid 
to futures prices. Prices for Brent oil are, accordingly, 
projected to be 65.6 USD/bl in 2006, 66.3 USD/bl in 2007 
and 68.0 USD/bl in 2008. Prices of primary commodities, 
excluding fuels, are assumed to increase by 23.2% in 2006, 
by 1.2% in 2007 and to decline by 3.7% in 2008.  In both 
2006 and 2007, the prices of most groups are expected to 
increase compared to 2005. 
Chain linking In order to improve the accuracy of GDP growth estimates, 
National Accounts have moved to ‘chain linking’ in most 
Member States to incorporate more up-to-date price weights. 
Chain-linking uses previous year’s prices (instead of prices 
from a given base year) which are then ‘chained’ together.  
Budgetary data Data for 2006 are based on government debt and deficit data 
reported by Member States to the Commission in October 
2006. In publishing these data, Eurostat has withdrawn its earlier reservations on the quality of the data in certain 
Member States. However, Eurostat has amended the deficit 
and debt data for 2005 reported by Belgium and has kept the 
former GDP series for Greece (see Eurostat's news release 
no. 139/2006 of 23 October 2006).  
For 2007, budgets adopted or presented to parliaments and 
all other measures known in sufficient detail are taken into 
consideration. For 2008, the "no-policy change" assumption 
used in the forecasts implies the extrapolation of revenue and 
expenditure trends and the inclusion of measures that are 
known in sufficient detail at the time of the completion of the 
forecast. 
The government balances reported by Member States to the 
Commission may be slightly different from those published 
in the national accounts because of the recording of swap- 
and FRA-related flows. While these are usually recorded as 
financial transactions, Regulation N
o 2558/2001 establishes 
recording them as interest for the purposes of the excessive 
deficit procedure (EDP).  
According to the Eurostat decision of 2 March 2004, funded 
defined-contribution pension schemes should be classified in 
the financial sector and not in government. Such a decision 
should be implemented by all Member States until the end of 
a transitory period which ends in April 2007. Currently, three 
Member States (DK, PL and SE) benefit from this transitory 
period (see Box 2.2). 
Calendar effects on GDP
 growth and output gaps 
The number of working days may differ from one year to 
another. For example, 2004 was a leap year with 2.8 more 
working days than an average year. This translated to an 
estimated impact of 0.24 pp. on the GDP growth rate for the 
euro area. On the other hand, for 2005, the effect was 
negative, yielding an impact of -0.13 pp. For 2006, the 
impact is estimated at -0.1 pp.  
Annual GDP figures are not adjusted for the number of 
working days, while most quarterly figures are. The 
calculation of potential growth and the output gap does not 
involve any adjustment for working days.  
3031303. Three years of economic growth at or 
above potential - 31 - 
Three years at or above potential  
The autumn forecast projects economic growth to 
accelerate from 1.4% in 2005 to 2.6% in the euro area 
and from 1.7% in 2005 to 2.8% in the EU in 2006. 

This represents an upward revision of 0.5 pp. 
compared to the spring forecast. The revisions are 
principally the result of the stronger-than-expected 

outcome for the first half of 2006. 
In addition, during the second half of 2006 and the 
first half of 2007, quarterly growth rates are, on 
average, foreseen to be slightly 
stronger than in the 
spring projection. The economy will thus enter 2007 
with fairly strong momentum, leading to an upward 
revision of GDP growth in 2007 of 0.3 pp. for the 

euro area (to 2.1%) and of 0.2 pp. for the EU (to 
2.4%). While output growth will temporarily slow at 
the beginning of 2007 as a consequence of the VAT 

rise in Germany, it is projected to re-accelerate, from 
the second quarter on, to a rate close to or above 
potential.  
In 2008, GDP growth is pr
ojected to be slightly 
higher than in 2007, partly because the growth 
deceleration in Germany at the beginning of 2007 will 

have a positive echo-effect at 
the beginning of 2008. 
For the year as a whole, growth is projected to be 
2.2% in the euro area and 2.4% in the EU. Growth 
will thus be at or above potential for three years in a 
row. 
The optimistic outlook for growth
 in the period ahead 
is underpinned by survey
 evidence. Most Commission 
confidence indicators are at their highest level since 
summer 2001. However, some indicators have 
receded from their peak, following a re-assessment of 

expectations.  Optimistic expectations have been responsible for a 
part of the apparent gap between soft and hard data in 
the recent past. Following recent upward revisions of 

National Accounts data, however, it appeared that the 
first releases of hard data underestimated the 
economic upturn. Since expectations have come down 

somewhat in the meantime, the gap between hard and 
soft data seems to have largely closed. The 
assessment of the current 
situation in survey data, 
which has tracked developments of (revised) hard 
data rather well, points 
to continued strong 
momentum in the European economy at the end of 

2006. The robust performance in 2006-2008 is the result of 
reinvigorated growth of domestic demand combined 

with a small positive contribution from net foreign 
trade. Domestic demand in the euro area is expected 
to grow by 2.5% in 2006 (2.8% in the EU). While

slowing somewhat thereafter, 
the growth rate will stay 
above 2% in 2007-08 in both areas.  
Domestic demand should be powered by buoyant 
investment, which is projected to grow at around 

3½% in 2007-08 in the EU, after 4.9% in 2006. 
Investment growth will be
 only slightly lower in the 
euro area, at around 3% in 2007-08, after 4.3% in 

2006. The most dynamic investment component will be 
investment in equipment, which should be supported 
by several factors. First, 
production is meeting 
capacity constraints, while demand prospects remain 
fairly bright. For instance, the capacity utilisation rate 
in manufacturing rose to 84% in the fourth quarter of 

2006, which is 2 pps. above the long-term average 
and the highest level sin
ce the first quarter of 2001. 
Secondly, the growth differential between the GDP 

deflator and nominal unit labour costs, which should 
be closely related to profit margins, is projected to 
remain at an elevated level during the forecasting 

period. Finally, while financing conditions are 
becoming less benign than in previous years, they are 
still relatively favourable.  -2-1012

 The evolution of construction investment is partly 
explained by the increase in the German VAT rate in 
2007, which is expected to bring forward part of the 

German housing investment from 2007 to 2006. Net 
of the effects of the German VAT increase, the 
apparent turnaround of the German construction 

sector removes a substantial drag from the European 
overall investment performance. A certain cooling of 
housing markets on the ba

financing conditions is expected to reduce the 
dynamism of housing construction in a number of

Forecast
 In 2006, rising capacity 
utilisation rates together with 
optimistic demand expectations gave a strong boost to 
employment growth. The clear turnaround in the 

evolution of employment, which
 started in the first 
half of 2006, is expected to steady over the 
forecasting period, with employment growth rates 

close to 1% annually. Nominal compensations per 
head are projected to accelerate, from 2.1% in 2006 to 
2.5% in 2008 in the eu
ro area (and to remain stable 
around 3.0% annually in the 
EU). As labour incomes 
will improve in the pro
cess, private consumption is 
expected to continue its gradual revival, with the 
growth rate in the EU averaging 2.1% over the period 
2006-08, while remaining somewhat more moderate 

in the euro area.  Over the forecast period, the contribution of net 
exports to growth will be pos
itive, reaching 0.3 pp. in 
2006 and 0.2 pp. in 2007 in the euro area (0.2 pp. in 

both years in the EU), coming down to 0.1 pp. in 
2008. Exports and imports are expected to see a 
certain growth deceleration in 2007-08. The 

deceleration of export growth will parallel the 
evolution of world trade. However, EU export 
markets are projected to
 grow by a still-respectable 
rate of 6.8% in 2008, after 
7.2% in 2007 and 9.8% in 
2006.  The solid EU export performance in 2006 seems 
artificially boosted by unusually 
strong figures for the 
United Kingdom, which appear to be significantly 
distorted by intra-community VAT fraud. 
Market share losses for the euro area are limited to 
about 1 pp. annually. This average evolution masks, 
however, relatively large differences between the 
performance of individual Member States, as a result 

of diverging competitiveness developments and 
differences in the composition of export sectors and 
markets.

 3333334. Remarkable labour market 
performance - 34 - 
Employment is finally growing faster... 
Owing to the recent improvement in the growth 
scenario, labour markets have performed distinctly 
better in 2006 than projected in the spring forecast. 

Employment grew by 0.7% in the euro area last year 
(0.9% in the EU) and accelerated to an annual pace of 
around 1¼% in the first half of 2006, the strongest 

increase since 2000. Euro-area employment growth 
picked up markedly in the first half of 2006, to 0.3% 
in the first quarter and to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in 

the second quarter. Overall in 2006, employment is 
foreseen to grow at an annual pace of 1.4% in both the 
euro area and the EU. 
–and growth appears broad-based across sectors 
The improvement in the first half of the year was 
broad-based across sectors; in particular employment 
growth in industry is no longer negative, which 
indicates a clear improvement in developments in that 

sector. Table 2.6

(Annual and quarterly percentage change, seasonally adjusted)
 Sectoral data for the larger Member States in the 
second quarter of 2006 indicate that the pick-up in job 
creation is mostly attributed to 
the private business 
sector, such as financial services and also wholesale 
and retail trade. Labour markets in both the euro area and the EU 
have proved resilient  In the early years of this decade (2001-2003), the 
economic downturn led to 
lacklustre performance on 
the labour market. Employment growth was very 
slow. Furthermore, it appears to have picked up only 

gradually during the current recovery, until very 
recently. Although the euro-area economy has created 
more than 5 million jobs in the past five years, three 

years after the beginning of 
the recovery the level of 
employment is still growing at an average pace of 
1.5 pp. lower than in previous
 upswings. Spain, Italy, 
and the United Kingdom have made the largest 
contributions to the number of jobs created, partly due 
to record net immigration, which constitutes a step 

increase in the labour supply.

 The unemployment rate in the euro area peaked at 
8.9% in the second quarter of 2004. Since then, it has 
been on a continuous downward trend, dropping 
below 8% in the second quarter of 2006.  
Employment expectations point to a sustained 
improvement  On the basis of data 
for the larger euro-area 
economies, expectations for th
e third quarter of 2006 
show that employment growth should accelerate. 
Employment prospects as reported in the 
Commission's business and consumer surveys (BCS) 
suggest that employment creation will continue 
throughout the year. This could be an indication of 

stronger GDP growth in the coming quarters. 
Moreover, employment and unemployment 
expectations have improved since the second half of 

2005, which could point to a gradually increasing 
propensity to consume.  
Employment outlook for 2007-08 
Employment in the euro area is foreseen to grow by 
1.4% in 2006, 1.2% in 2007 and 1.1% in 2008 (up by 
0.5 pp. for 2006 and 0.4 pp. 
for 2007 compared to the 
spring forecast). For the EU, the forecast points to 

employment growth rates of 1.4% in 2006, 1.1% in 
2007 and 0.9% in 2008.  
343534Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
- 35 - 
At Member-State level, buoyant job creation is 
expected for 2006 notably in Ireland, Spain and 
Luxembourg (above 3% y-o-y), and also in the 

Netherlands and Italy. Job creation has also been 
better than expected in Denmark, the United 
Kingdom, Slovakia and Poland; in addition, the 

outlook for Germany, France, and Portugal has been 
revised upwards compared 
to the spring forecast. 
A deceleration of employment growth is foreseen in 
2008 due to economic activity returning to potential 

and labour-intensive sectors such as construction 
cooling. Yet above-average employment growth 
should still characterise the labour markets in Greece, 

Spain, Ireland, and Luxembourg. Employment growth 
in 2008 is expected to be slightly higher in the euro 
area (+1.1%) than in the EU as a whole (+0.9%). 
Encouraging downward unemployment trend– 
The standardised unemploy
ment rate has been on a 
continuous downward trend 
since the second half of 
2004. It stood at or below 8% in the second quarter of 
2006 both in the euro area and in the EU, its lowest 
level since November 200
1. In August 2006, the 
unemployment rate stood at 7.9% in the euro area, 

compared to 8.5% a year earlier. Unemployment is set 
to drop further, declining from an annual average of 
8% this year to 7.7% in 
2007 and 7.4% in 
2008 for the euro area.  
This rosier performance for euro-area unemployment 
in 2006 was driven by
 the larger Member States. The 
unemployment rate in Spain fell by 1.0 pp. from 

January to August 2006, while the French and 
German rates also dropped by
 0.6 pp. However, the 
situation continues to be disparate in the euro-area 

Member States, with the unemployment rate ranging 
from around 4% in Ireland 
and the Netherlands to 
around 9% in France, Germany and Greece for 2006 

as a whole. 
Turning to the EU as a whole, unemployment is 
expected to fall in a similar way as in the euro area, to 
8% in 2006, 7.6% in 2007 and 7.3% in 2008. This 

additional improvement 
at EU level mainly stems 
from decreases in the unemp
loyment rate in Poland 
and Slovakia. Slovakia will feature the highest 
unemployment rate in the 
EU at 14.3% in 2006, while 
the Polish unemployment rate (at 13.9% in 2006) has 

been dropping extremely fast. In contrast, increases in 
the unemployment rate were recorded notably in the 
United Kingdom, and slight increases in Hungary and 
Cyprus. 
In spite of falling unemployment overall, long-term 
unemployment continues to
 be a source of concern, 
with around 45% of job-seekers having been 
unemployed for more than a year. 
...but employment rates are still low 
The employment rate remains low by international 
standards at 63.5% in the euro area, pointing to an 

under-utilisation of the EU's potential, although it has 
increased more markedly in the past three years (+0.5 
pp. between 2004 and 2005). In both the US and 

Japan, the employment rate st
ands at around 70% of 
the working-age population. Moreover, the overall 
employment rate is still far 
from the agreed Lisbon 
targets. The share of so-called ‘flexible’ jobs continues to 
grow, especially in the services sector in Germany, 
Spain and Italy. In the euro area in 2005, 19% of 

workers were part-time (and 16% on temporary 
contracts); this represents a significant increase over 
previous years, the share of part-time work for 
example having risen from around 16% of total 
employment in 2000. Women's share in part-time 

employment is over 70% and can partly explain this 
increase, as female participation rates have improved 
in the past few years. The expansion of part-time 

work has contributed to between 60 and 65% of 
employment creation since 2000.  
Still moderate wage developments in 2006– 
The annual growth rate in
 compensation per employee 
stood at 2% in 2006Q1 in the euro area, unchanged 

compared with the previous quarter. Although 
stabilising at around 2% in 20
05 and 2006, wage 
growth should accelerate somewhat (to 2.2% in 2007 

and 2.5% in 2008) due to new wage agreements being 
implemented in some 
of the larger Member States.  
Wage growth is expected to range from 0.4% in 
Germany to nearly 6% in Greece in 2006, mostly 

reflecting local labour market conditions and 
agreements. In the recently acceded Member States, 
the catch-up process is triggering higher-than-average 
wage growth, notably in Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, 
and Lithuania. This mi
rrors their high GDP growth, 
though the situation app
ears worrisome in Hungary 
because it appears to have come at the expense of 
353535Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 - 36 - 
slow employment growth. In the case of Portugal and 
Italy, where GDP is growing below the euro-area 
average, wage developments are less benign; this may 

dampen cost competitiven
ess and thus further slow 
down economic activity. 
–and labour productivity picking up 
Compared to previous economic recoveries, the pick-
up in labour productivity since the second half of 

2003 has been sluggish. Yet recent developments are 
closing the gap. The quarterly profile of labour 
productivity growth confirms a recent acceleration. 

Labour productivity growth in th
e euro area
 reached 
an annualised pace of 2.2% in the first half of 2006, 
significantly above the 0.8%, observed as an average 

for the previous ten years.  
A breakdown by sector shows labour productivity 
now growing faster than the long-term average (0.8%) 
in private business services (all sectors but agriculture 

and public services) as well as in industry. Among the 
larger Member States, productivity 
gains in industry 
have been particularly large in Germany and France. 
The acceleration of productivity growth, if sustained, 
could hint at a more prono
unced recovery of euro-area 
GDP. 
For the time being, labour productivity is expected to 
grow at 1.2% (annual) in th
e euro area in 2006, and at 
around 1% in both 2007 and 2008. Above-average 

growth is forecast in Belgium, Germany, Greece, 
France, Luxembourg, Austria, Slovenia, and Finland

 in 2006, while a sharp 
decline is expected in Germany 
in 2007 (-1.3 pps). The forecast projects a relatively 
mild pick-up in productivity 
growth over the forecast 
horizon. Nevertheless, 
cyclical developments since 
2003 seem to have ended the declining trend of the 
1990s.         
Together with harmonised wag
e indicators pointing to 
a relative moderation for the euro area in the past five 
years, especially in Germany, the recent pick-up in 
labour productivity is turning into a boost to 

competitiveness. Germany, 
the Netherlands, and 
Austria, remain well-placed in terms of 
competitiveness in 2006, while Greece, Spain, and 

Italy are not.   Table 2.7

- 37 - 
Headline inflation stayed above 2% due to higher 
energy prices–  
Headline HICP inflation in the euro area and the EU 
remained above 2% (y-o-y) during the first eight 

months of 2006. This was largely the result of higher 
energy prices driven by the continued sharp increases 
in oil prices. Energy price in
flation in the euro area 
was at an elevated level, fluctuating between 10 and 
14%, throughout the first half
 of the year. Over this 
time, energy price inflation c
ontributed about 1 pp. to 
overall inflation.  
In September, however, headline inflation in the euro 
area declined markedly, from 2.3% in the previous 
month to 1.7%. This was 
the lowest annual inflation 
rate registered in 2½ years and the first time in 20 
months that inflation was below 2.0%. About 0.3 pp. 
of the decline can be explained by favourable base 

effects stemming from the sharp increase in energy 
inflation last year related to the Katrina oil price hike.  
Much of the rest of the decline can be attributed to the 

recent and ongoing substantial fall in oil prices. 
Having dropped below 10% in July, annual energy 
price inflation in the euro area eased further to just 
1.5% in September, the lowest rate since March 2004.

 Developments in unprocessed food prices were 
another source of upward pressure on headline 

inflation in recent months. Owing to extremely warm 
weather conditions during
 the summer, unprocessed 
food inflation increased more than threefold, from 
about 1% in the spring to just above 4½% in August, 
the highest inflation rate for this component in three 

years. –but underlying inflation remained at around 
1½% 
In contrast, core inflation (HICP excluding energy and 
unprocessed food)
, although edging up slightly, has 
remained fairly subdued so far this year, hovering 
around 1½%. Core inflation was 1.5% in September, 
unchanged from August. The continued relative 

stability of core inflation, de
spite the substantial gap with headline inflation, 
which amounted to close to 
1 pp since mid-2005, suggests that the oil price hike 

has not had significant indi
rect effects on the non-
energy part of the HICP so far.  Given the recent 
sharp fall in headline inflation,
 the gap is now nearly 
closed. However, indirect
 effects might not be entirely absent.  
Inflation in at least tw
o of the three main components 
of core inflation had eased in 2005 to some of the 

lowest rates of the last four years, but has since edged 
up somewhat. In particular, 
annual inflation in the 
non-energy industrial good
s, although still fairly 
contained, picked up from around 0.1% in mid-2005 
to 0.8% in August 2006. Inflation in processed food 
also picked up, from abou
t 1½% in mid-2005 to just 
above 2% in August 2006, 
before easing to 1.8% in 
September. However, in
flation in services, the third 
major component of core 
inflation, has been more 
stable, fluctuating closely around 2% from the 
beginning of the year, to stand at 2.0% in September. 
Some signs of pipeline inflationary pressures have 
also emerged at the production stage. Overall 
producer price inflation (e
xcluding construction) has 
edged up, from around 4% in 
mid-2005 to close to 6% 
in August 2006. This deve
lopment mostly reflects the 
influence of sharp rises in the energy component, 
which remained at levels between 20% and 15% until 

July of this year, but also of a strong acceleration in 
intermediate goods inflation, 
from around 2% at the 
beginning of the year to 6½% in August 2006. Annual 

inflation in the consumer goods components, which 
are the most immediately relevant for consumer 
prices, while still remaining relatively subdued, have 
also picked up somewhat 
(from around 1.5% at the 
beginning of the year to nearly 2% in August 2006). 
The inflationary pressure exerted by the energy 
component on overall producer prices has recently 
begun to weaken, as it has in the case of consumer 
prices. This reflects a combination of base effects 

from last year's hikes and the slide in oil prices since 
373737Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 - 38 - 
mid-August. The annual rate of increase in producer 
energy prices fell to about 
13% in August, resulting in 
a decline in total producer prices inflation to 5.7%.

input cost in some industries, there are also additional 
explanatory factors.  Commodity prices in general and 

import prices have also risen 
sharply. Among primary 
commodities, food prices are estimated to have 
increased by 14% in 2006, after about 4% last year.  

Minerals and metals' prices increased by an estimated 
50% in 2006, compared to 24% in 2005. This is 
estimated to have led total primary commodities 

(excluding fuels) to increase by 23% this year, 
compared to around 8% in 2005. On the side of 
imports, prices are estimated to have increased by 

about 5% (4½%) in the euro area (EU) this year, after 
4% (3½%) in 2005.  It coul
d also be that leading 
inflation indicators are alread
y responding to the 
strong domestic gr
owth observed this year. On the wage side, as mentioned in the previous 
chapter, labour cost indicators suggest continued 

overall moderation so far. Annual growth in 
compensation per employee in the euro area, which is 
the most prominent indicat
or, was unchanged at 2.0% 
in the first quarter of this year, suggesting little sign 
yet of significant second-round effects from the oil 
price hike. However, other indicators point to a 

modest acceleration in the following quarter. The 
ECB's indicator of negotiated wages moved up from 
2.1% in the first quarter of 2006 to 2.3% in the second 
quarter. Eurostat's hourl
y labour cost index and DG 
ECFIN's wage indicator also moved up, showing 
annual growth rates of about 2.3%-2.4% in the second 

quarter of this year. For the year as a whole, it 
estimated that compensation per employee should 
grow by 2.1%, after 2.0% last year. 
Whether the likely acceleration in compensation in 
recent quarters translates into higher price pressure 
depends critically on developments in productivity.  
The marked increase in labou
r productivity observed 
in the first half of this 
year means that growth in unit 
labour costs has remained cont
ained. It is estimated 
that productivity should rise by 1.2% this year in the 

euro area, compared to 0.6% last year. Accordingly, 
growth in unit labour costs is estimated to ease from 
1.3% in 2005 to 0.9% in 2006.  
On the side of inflation expectations, short-term 
inflation expectations in the euro area, based on the 
Commission's consumer surveys, reached a four-year 
high in August, but declined in September. This was 

the first decline since this indicator surpassed its 
historical average in June. Long-term inflation 
expectations in the euro area derived from French 
government inflation-indexed bonds also declined 
slightly for the fourth consecutive month in 

September to 2.1%, from 2.3% in May.  
Inflation set to decline gradually to below 2% in 
2008 
Looking ahead, headline HICP inflation in the euro 
area and the EU is projected to gradually ease over the 

forecast horizon. In the case of the euro area, HICP 
inflation should decline from 2.2% this year to 2.1% 
in 2007 and 1.9% in 2008. In the EU, inflation should 

average 2.3% this year and in 2007, before declining 
to 2.0% in 2008.  Inflation in the euro area is expected 
to cross the 2% mark in the first quarter of 2008 and 

to remain below that thresho
ld for the rest of the year. 
Compared to the spring, the new estimates for 
inflation in 2006 are unchanged for the euro area and 
include a slight upward revi
sion for the EU (0.2 pp). 
For 2007, the autumn forecasts include a slight 
downward revision in the case of the euro area 
(-0.1 pp.), and a slight upward revision for the EU 
(also 0.1 pp.).   
Overall, the new profile fo
r inflation is supported externally by lower inflationary impulses from

expected developments in commodity and import 
prices and domestically by the expected continued 
moderate unit labour cost gains as well as a broadly 

unchanged output gap. The annual rate of increase in 
total primary commodity pr
ices (including fuels) is projected to plunge from 21% this year to merely 1% 

in 2007 and to remain essentially flat in 2008. 
Excluding fuels, primary commodity prices are 
actually expected to
 decline by close
 to 4% in 2008. 
The annual rate of increase of import prices in the 
euro area is projected to ease from nearly 5% this year 
to about 1½% in 2008.  
On the domestic side, gr
owth in unit labour costs in 
the euro area is expected to accelerate, from 0.9% this 
year to 1.3% in 2008. Th
is profile is explained chiefly 
by the projected acceleration in compensation per 

employee (from 2.1% this year to 2.5% in 2008), 
while productivity gains remain broadly unchanged 
over the forecast horizon at around 1%.  
Inflation prospects across Member States 
Among the euro-area Member States, inflation in 
Germany is expected to increase from 1.8% this year 
to 2.2% in 2007, before easing to 1.2% in 2008, the 

lowest rate in the euro area. This profile is 
significantly influenced by
 the planned VAT increase 
in January 2007, which should result in a jump in 

inflation of about 1 pp. at
 the turn of the year, from 
about 1½% in the last quarter of 2006 to close to 2½% 
in the first quarter of 2007
. As the effect of the VAT 
rise drops out of the calculation of annual rates in 
2008, inflation in Germany sh
ould ease to just above 
1% in the first quarter of 
2008 and remain at around 
that level for the rest of the year. 
In France, annual average inflation is projected to 
slow to just below 2% already in 2007, while in Italy, 
which starts at a higher level, this should occur a year 
later. Spain, although main
taining a differential of 
roughly 1 pp. with the euro area, is expected to see a 
decline in inflation from close 
to 3½% in 2006 to 
somewhat above 2½% in 2008. This would leave 

Spain with the second highest inflation rate in the area 
in 2008, when the highest inflation rate is expected to 
be registered in Greece. In the other Member States, 

except the Netherlands, Finland, Greece and Slovenia, 
inflation is expected to ease over the forecast horizon. 
In the Netherlands, inflation is projected to accelerate 

from 1.6% this year to 2.3% in 2008, while in Finland 
it accelerates less markedly, from 1.3% this year to 
1.6% in 2008.  In Greece and Slovenia, inflation is set 

to remain broadly unchanged, at close to 3½% in the 
former and 2½% in the latter. 
Outside the euro area, where inflation is generally 
higher, the picture is more mixed, with only half of 

the Member States showing inflation easing over the 
forecast horizon. Inflation in the Czech Republic is 
projected to rise from 2½% this year to nearly 3% in 
2008. In Hungar
y, reflecting furt
her increases in 
administered prices, inflation should rise from close to 

4% this year to almost 7% in 2007, before easing back 
to just below 4% in 2008, th
e third highest rate in the 
EU. Inflation will also increase in Poland and 

Sweden, from about 1½% this year in both countries 
to nearly 3% in 2008 in Poland and to just below 2% 
Sweden. The Baltic countries are expected to continue 

registering some of the hi
ghest inflation rates in the 
EU in 2008: about 5½% 
in Latvia, 4½% in Estonia 
and 3½% in Lithuania.  In the UK, inflation is 

expected to decline from close to 2½% this year to 
2% in 2008, while in Den
mark it should ease slightly 
to just below 2% in 2008.

buoyant tax revenues - 40 - 
Gradual improvement of budgetary situation 
confirmed Following a relatively long series of negative 
surprises, the forecast confirms a shift towards a 

generally brighter public finance outlook in the EU. A 
gradual improvement in the budgetary situation is on 
the cards. Starting with the headline figu
res, in 2006 the budget 
deficit for the euro area is projected to be at 2% of 
GDP, down from 2.4% in 2005. Based on the usual 
no-policy-change assumptio
n, the deficit is set to 
remain on a declining path in the next two years, 
reaching 1.5% in 2007 and 1.3% of GDP in 2008. A 
marginally smaller decline is foreseen for the EU. 
Although the spring 2006 forecast already pointed to 
an imminent improvement in the budgetary situation, 
its public finance projections were decidedly more 
cautious. The deficit in the euro area and the EU was 

expected to merely stabilise 
in 2006 and to start 
declining only from 2007.  
But the upward revision of economic growth by 
around ½ a percentage point and better-than-expected 
revenues have led to a brighter public finance outlook 
for 2006. The revenue ratio is expected to reach 

45.2% of GDP in both the euro area and the EU, ¼ of 
a percentage point higher compared to the forecast for 
2006 of six months ago. The decline in the 

expenditure ratio resu
lts from essentially stable 
expenditure levels coupled with higher-than-expected 
GDP. 
The current buoyancy of tax revenues has gone hand 
in hand with a sharp
 recovery of tax elasticities in 
2005 and 2006, as illustrated
 in Graph 2.16. In 
particular, the apparent tax elasticity (the observed relative change of current tax revenues with respect to 
the relative change of nominal GDP) for the euro area 
fell well below the average estimate of slightly above 

1 during the past economic
 slowdown. Apparent tax 
elasticities also include the effect of discretionary 
revenue measures. However, few of them were 

implemented in 2005 and few are expected to be 
implemented in 2006, at least in the large Member 
States. Consequently, the currently high tax 
elasticities are likely to reflect a number of other 
factors such as a steep recovery of corporate profits, 

rising oil prices, a recovery of tax-rich domestic 
demand components, i.e. consumption expenditure, a 
positive performance of equity markets until the 
beginning of 2006 and
, in some countries, still rising 
house prices. By major categories, data reveal a 

particularly large swing in taxes on income and 
wealth which include 
the particularly volatile corporate income tax. In 2006, revenues from taxes on 
income and wealth in the euro area as a whole are 
expected to increase by more th
an 7% on th
e previous year, against an expected increase in nominal GDP of 

4.5%. This compares with a situation between 2002 
and 2003 when taxes on income and wealth declined 
in the face of slow yet positive economic growth.

Graph 2.16: 
Euro-area tax elasticity with respect to GDP
 In 2007, based on the no-policy-change assumption, 
which on the revenue side amounts to the idea that tax 
elasticities will move towards standard values, the 

projected budgetary improvement in the euro area is 
forecast to result from significant expenditure 
restraints. The expected decline in the expenditure 
ratio for individual co
untries mainly reflects 
projections for the large euro-area economies 

currently in excessive deficit, notably Germany, 
France and Italy. Unchanged policies are expected to 
lead to a further though sm
aller decline in expenditure 
ratio for the euro area, and in
 turn of the deficit, in 
2008. A similar development is expected for the EU. 
The projected decline in the apparent tax elasticity in 

2008 shown in Graph 2.16 reflects both the effect of 
some discretionary tax measures included in current 
policies as well as a slight fall of the labour share in 

income. 
In the euro area, the budgetary correction net of 
cyclical factors and one-off and other temporary 
measures is estimated to be
 essentially in line with the 
404140Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
- 41 - 
nominal improvement in both 2006 and 2007 on the 
back of essentially stable cyclical conditions. As 
shown in Table 2.10, the structural budget balance is 

expected to improve by around a ¼ of a percentage 
point in 2006 and by ½ a percentage point in 2007. 
The estimated structural improvement for the EU is 

basically the same. Although the structural 
improvement in both the euro area and the EU proved 
relatively sound in 2006, Member States do not seem 

to have taken full advantage of the high growth rate 
coupled with high tax elasticities this year. Euro area: Progress towards correction of 
excessive deficits continues 
At the country level, the projected improvement of 
public finances in 
the euro area reflects a relatively 
broad based trend in 2006 followed by a somewhat 
more heterogeneous picture in 2007.  
Among the countries currently in excessive deficit 
only Italy is expected to post a deterioration of the 
budgetary situation in 2006. The apparent 
deterioration is due to a recent ruling of the European 
Court of Justice which gives rise to sizeable tax 
refunds. Thanks to 
the mostly temporary effects of the 
court ruling coupled 
with higher than expected revenues and the projected impact of the 2007 draft 
budget the deficit is estimated to return to just below 

the 3% of GDP threshold in 2007. Further measures 
will be needed to consolid
ate the result in 2008.  
In Greece, current policies are expected to halve the 
deficit this year compared to 5.2% of GDP in 2005 
and to keep it below the 3% of GDP threshold over 

the forecast horizon. While Portugal is likely to 
achieve a relatively large de
cline in 2006, the deficit 
is not expected to fall belo
w the 3% of GDP threshold 
over the forecast period due to the high starting level 
of 6% of GDP recorded in 2005. By contrast, a lasting 
reduction of the deficit to 
below the Treaty limit is 
projected to take place in the two largest countries of 
the euro area. In Germany, current policies are 
projected to trim the deficit down to 2.3% of GDP in 

2006, from 3.2% in the previous year, and produce 
further reductions in 2007 and 2008. The decline is 
expected to be somewhat
 more gradual but still 
permanent in France.  
Among the other euro area economies, Spain and 
Ireland are forecast to experience a measurable 
decline in the nominal surplus over the forecast 

period. The same trend is visible in structural terms, 
although somewhat flatter in the case of Ireland. In 
Belgium, a projected deterioration of the nominal 
budget balance masks an improvement in structural 
terms. 
Heterogeneous trends exist outside the euro area 
Outside the euro area, budgetary trends are more 
heterogeneous. Starting with the excessive deficit 
countries, in three out of six
, namely Malta, Poland, 
and the United Kingdom, the general government

 care. 414141Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 - 42 - 
deficit is expected to fall or stay below the 3% of 
GDP threshold in 2006. 
Under current policies the 
decline is projected to be relatively clear and lasting 

in the United Kingdom, 
while in Malta the deficit is 
likely to stay close to the threshold from below 
throughout the forecast period. As regards Poland, 

deficit figures do not incl
ude the costs of pension 
reform. This country benefits from the transitory 
period concerning the sectoral classification of the 

second-pillar pension 
schemes. The re-classification 
of these schemes in the corporate sector by April 2007 
will lead to a level shift in the deficit. A more detailed 

discussion of this issue is presented in Box 2.2. In 
Slovakia current policies are expected to further 
increase the deficit in 2006 a
nd to bring it marginally 
below the 3% of GDP threshold only in 2008. In the 
Czech Republic, although the deficit is projected to 
stay on a downward path throughout the forecast 

period, it is likely to stay above 3% of GDP. Current 
policies are forecast to lead to a further significant 
deterioration of the fiscal positio
n in Hungary this 
year; there the deficit is projected to soar to above 
10% of GDP, up from 7.8% of GDP in 2005. 

Assuming that the recently announced budgetary 
strategy is largely implemented in 2007 and produces 
parts of its effects in 2008 the deficit would decline 

again to 5.6% in 2008.  
Turning to the non-ex
cessive deficit countries, the 
deficit in Cyprus is projected to stay below 2% of 
GDP throughout the forecast period. The budgetary 

projections for the two Scandinavian countries, 
Denmark and Sweden, po
int to a relatively save 
surplus position, also including pension reform costs 

(see Box 2.2) In the Baltic 
countries, current policies are expected to keep the fiscal position well within the 
margins safeguarding against th
e risk of breaching the 
3% of GDP threshold. 
Debt expected to embark on downward trend  
Following an increasing trend in recent years, with a 
peak of 70.6% of GDP in 2005, the debt ratio for the 
euro area is now expected to embark on a gradual 
downward path. Over the forecast period the debt 
ratio is projected to decline 
by around 3½ percentage 
points, to slightly below 67% in 2008. A similar 
development is forecast in the EU, where the debt 
ratio is expected to come close to the 60% of GDP 

reference value.  
The downward trend for the euro area and the EU 
masks a few notable exceptions. In Hungary, on the 
back of the very high deficit projections, the debt ratio 

is expected to rise well above 70% of GDP in 2008, 
from around 62% of GDP in 2005. The debt ratio in 
Portugal is expected to climb
 to similar levels.  
In the case of Italy, the impact of the tax refunds 
mentioned above is expected to further increase the 
debt ratio to around 107% of GDP in 2006, after 
which corrective measures are likely to reverse the 

trend.

Box 2.2:
  Recording of pension reform costs
 According to ESA95 rules and the Eurostat decision of 2 
March 2004, funded defined-contribution (DC) pension 
schemes should be classified in the financial sector and not 
in government. Therefore when a government creates a new 
funded DC pension scheme and shifts to this new scheme a 
share of the social contributions that were previously 
collected by social security, government revenue falls. On 
the other hand, the pensions that will be paid by the new 
pension scheme will not count as government expenditure. 
This usually leads to a medium-term deterioration in the 
government deficit (often known as the pension reform cost) 
to be offset by an improvement in the future. 
The Eurostat decision on the sectoral classification of 
pension schemes should be implemented by all Member 
States until the end of a transitory period which ends in April 
2007. Currently, Denmark, Poland and Sweden benefit from 
this transitory period. By April 2007, the government deficits 
(surpluses) and debts in these countries will have to be revised upwards (downwards) (see Tables 2.11 and 2.12).

 Data reported by the Hungarian statistical office (KSH) and 
published by Eurostat (Eurostat press release n° 139/2006 of 
23.10. 2006) will also have to be revised in April 2007. 
However, deficit figures in the most recent update of the 
Hungarian convergence programme (September 2006) 
already include the pension reform costs. For consistency 
with the convergence programme, the Commission forecasts 
for Hungary already include the pension reform costs and are 
therefore not directly comparable to data published by the 
KSH and Eurostat. Slovakia also used to benefit from the transitory period. 
However the most recent government deficit figures 
published by the Slovak statistical office and Eurostat 
include the pension reform costs. To reflect this change the 
Commission services' forecast for the budget balance and the 
debt is inclusive of pension reform costs as well.

 4343437. Risks to the forecast 
- 44 - 
As always, the outlook is subject to upside and 
downside risks. 
On the external side, risks relate 
to the outlook for 
world trade. While the US econo
my is slowing, there 
are few signs of a growth deceleration in Asia. In the 
event of a further re-composition of Asian growth 
towards domestic demand, Asian economies might be 

in a better position to withstand a slowdown in the US 
than in the past. This could give an additional boost to 
growth in world trade, in general, and with Asia 

gaining importance as a Eu
ropean export destination, 
to growth in European export
 markets in particular.   
On the other hand, a sharpe
r-than-expected slowing of 
the US economy also poses significant downside risks 

to the outlook for 
world trade.  In 
addition, important 
global imbalances continue to prevail and risks of a 
disorderly unwinding have
 not abated in recent 
months. Added to this comes the suspension of the 
Doha trade round which coul
d reignite protectionist 
tendencies and encourage moves towards bilateralism. 
Oil prices have decreased by almost $20/barrel since 
their peak in early August. Lower demand, increasing 
stocks and the recent easing of geopolitical tensions 

have contributed to a strong downward correction of 
oil prices. For the first time
 in several years, assuming 
no disruptive hurricanes or a rekindling of 

geopolitical tensions, the 
chances are that oil prices 
could fall even further over the forecasting period. 
This would evidently be beneficial for the purchasing 

power of households and profit margins in the 
corporate sector. On the other hand, oil prices could 
also rise again, thereb
y constituting a downside risk to 
growth. In particular, while slowing demand is 
expected to improve the supply-demand balance in 
the near term, in the cu
rrent geopolitical environment 
it cannot be ruled out th
at tensions flare up again, 
thereby quickly raising risk premiums on oil prices. 
On the domestic side, 
upside risks are primarily 
linked to developments on the labour market. 

Recently, the unemployment rate has fallen to its 
lowest level since 2001
. Continued positive surprises 
on the labour market would have a direct effect on 
private consumption via higher labour incomes. 
Moreover, it is likely to boost consumer confidence, 

thereby strengthening the propensity to consume. As 
there has been little consumption smoothing since the 
downturn in 2001-2002, households could increase 
their consumption levels without dipping strongly into 
their savings. 
A further upside risk is related to recent productivity 
developments. There are indi
cations that labour 
productivity in Europe has increased substantially 
over recent quarters. While a large part of this is of a 
cyclical nature, ongoing reform efforts in combination 

with rising investments in ICT may also have led to 
structural improvements. 
Continued strong 
productivity increases would, via their effect on 

corporate profitability, boost Europe's attractiveness 
as a place to invest and gross fixed capital formation 
may continue to surprise on the upside in the near-

term future. 
Downside risks are related to 
the inflation outlook. With labour markets tight
ening, wages, which up to 
now have been surprising
ly contained, may grow 
more than expected. Wage claims have risen in the 
first half of 2006 and may c
ontinue to do so in the 
near term. Higher wages could translate into higher 

consumer prices, which may prompt a response from 
monetary authorities that goes beyond what is 
assumed in the forecast. On the other hand, the effects 
of higher wage claims on inflation may be partly 
offset by the observed in
crease in labour productivity. Furthermore, despite a 
certain cooling in 2006, 
housing markets continue 
to be richly valued in a 
number of Member States. In the event of further 
interest hikes, an abrupt downward correction may 

occur, impacting negatively on construction 
investment and private consumption. 
Overall, risks seem to be fairly 
balanced, with upside 
risks slightly dominating in 2
006, but downside risk 
becoming more pronounced further ahead. 
Underlying the above risk scenario is the assumption 
that the US economy will
 see a soft landing. There is, 
however, a non-negligible probability of an 

alternative scenario where the 
US slowdown will be 
more pronounced than assumed. Such a "harder-
landing" scenario would not only have a negative 

effect on world output growth 
in itself, but most likely 
also have wider implications via a correction in asset 
prices and a downward pressure on the dollar. A 
significant correction in 
US financial asset prices 
would impact on the performance of European 

households, companies and 
financial intermediaries, 
as a result of the deterior
ation in the balance sheets. 
444544Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
- 45 - 
Moreover, a sharp appreciation of the euro in 
combination with financ
ial-market turbulence could be expected to feed back into the real sector via 

reductions in the level of
 investment and household 
spending. 
There are, however, some safety valves which would 
come into play in the ev
ent of such
 an alternative 
scenario of a significant co
mpression of demand in 
the United States. First, weak global demand would 
curb commodity prices and pu
t downward pressure on 
producer prices. Second, the appreciation of the euro 
would help contain inflati
onary pressures in the EU, 
providing monetary policy 
with a larger margin of 
manoeuvre. 
Moreover, even if a harder landing of the US 
economy were to occur, its impact on the EU 
economy is likely to be milder than, for instance, in 

2001-2002. This can be expl
ained by several factors. 
First, the euro-area recovery is increasingly based on 
domestic demand, where 
inter alia
 the long-term 
adjustment of the German construction sector has 
come a long way and may no longer constitute a drag 
on growth. Second, the importance of the US as a 
destination for euro-area ex
ports has diminished in 
recent years, with increasing exports shares directed 

to the recently-acceded Member States, to oil-
exporting countries and to
 Asia, particularly China. 
Finally, in contrast to the recession in 2001-2002 that 

was a common shock following the burst of the dot-
com bubble, there is no reason to assume, barring 
sizeable financial stress, that a country-specific 

downturn in one housing market should spill over to 
others. 
Box 2.3 in this document discusses in greater detail 
whether US house prices appear overvalued, how a 

harder landing of the US could play out and the 
transmission channels through which the EU could be 
affected. It also gives some indications of the 

quantitative impact based on different simulations 
using the Commission's macroeconomic QUEST 
model. A harder landing in the US would clearly 
affect other countries through 
the direct and indirect 
trade effect; the impact on confidence and through 

financial linkages. Depending on the assumptions 
used in the different scenarios, the more pronounced 
slowdown in the US housing sector, which could 

cause a mild recession in the US (reducing GDP by a 
cumulative 2½ pp. in 2007
-2008 compared to the 
baseline forecast), is expected to reduce GDP growth 
in the EU by between 0.3 and 0.8 pp. over the same 
period. 
The simulations point to a more limited impact than in 
the 2000-2001 recession and there are several reasons 
for that: First, the shock is 
of a country-specific nature 
and not sparked by a common adverse shock. Second, 

corporate balance sheets have improved since the dot-
com bubble and current stock market valuations are 
more in line with fund
amentals. Third, the US 
slowdown is expected to mainly affect the 
construction sector and private consumption, while 
the import demand for investment goods could hold 

up well. Fourth, although house prices in some EU 
countries appear to be ove
rvalued, developments in 
housing markets are predominantly driven by local 

conditions and direct spill-over effects from a cooling 
of the US housing market are not to be expected. 
Fifth, growth in the EU and the euro area is 

increasingly driven by domestic demand and more 
broad based over the forecast period. Sixth, temporary 
factors that held back growth in the past, e.g. the long-
term adjustment of the German construction sector to 
pre-unification levels, seem to have petered out. 

Finally, structural reform efforts may have 
contributed to strengthen potential growth and thereby 
also the resilience of the 
EU economies to external 
shocks. 
454545Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 - 46 - 
Box 2.3:
 Economic implications for the EU of a more marked correction of the US housing market 
 One risk highlighted in the current forecast reflects growing 
concern about a more marked cooling of the United States 
(US) housing market than projected, which could cause a 
harder landing of the US economy.   
This box will briefly discuss whether US house prices appear 
overvalued; how a harder landing in the US could play out; 
the channels through which the EU (and the rest of the 
world) would be affected, and will give some indications of 
the quantitative impact on the EU economy based on 
different model scenarios. 
US house prices seem overvalued... 
House prices in the US have increased by around 50% since 
2001 according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise 
Oversight. This has caused a substantial gain in wealth that, 
with increased mortgage equity withdrawal, has helped to 
finance consumer spending, providing a boost to US 
economic growth. According to some estimates, the house 
price surge has added at least 1 pp. to GDP growth during 
the past three years. 
The US housing market is now facing a downturn. Residential construction fell by 11% (year-on-year) in the 
second quarter of 2006. In September, housing starts were 

18% below the value one year ago, while house-price growth 
has slowed markedly. The question is how severe the US 
housing correction will eventually turn out to be. Any 
estimate of an overvaluation compared to “fundamentals”, 
i.e. affordability indicators, price/rent-ratios and user cost of 
owner-occupied housing, crucially depends on the 
assumptions for interest rates. 
At present, many private 
sector estimates of the overvaluation centre around 20%. It 
could also prove somewhat larger, judging from an OECD 
study on "Recent house price developments: the role of 
fundamentals" that indicated an overvaluation of 21% based 
on 2004 year's prices using the price-to-rent ratio. Looking at 
earlier housing-market cycles in the US gives limited 
guidance, as average nation-wide prices have not fallen since 
reliable data have become available, perhaps to some extent, 
because the US housing cycle is smoother at the national 
level. At the regional level, however, there have been 
episodes of falling prices over the past thirty years.  
Turning to other countries for guidance and according to the 
IMF essay "when bubbles burst", house prices have bust, on 
average, every 20 years in industrial countries since 1970 
(with most house-price busts centred around 1980-82 and 
1989-92).  The price correction typically amounted to 30%, 
lasted about four years and was often associated with output 
losses. The beginning of the slowdown in activity broadly 
coincided with the beginning of the bust itself, while the 
recovery typically started after nine quarters. The probability  
of a housing price boom being followed by a bust amounted 
to around 40%. 
...and a more marked correc
tion could cause a mild 
recession in the US... 
A more pronounced slowdown in the housing sector would 
involve a sharper fall in both house prices and residential 
investment.  The slowdown in the housing sector would also 
spill over into consumer spending, via the wealth effect, to 
the labour market and to business investment (albeit with a 
somewhat longer lag).  However, the outlook for a weaker 
domestic demand is also likely to initiate a significant 
monetary policy easing. This, together with an assumed 
fiscal stimulus, would strengthen a rebound in 2008. 
The baseline forecast assumes a 10% fall in the level of 
house prices and a moderate decline in residential 
construction until the third quarter of 2007. A sharper 
correction could see house prices coming down by 20% and 
residential construction following a more pronounced 
downturn similar to the one experienced in the 1990/91 
recession. In such a scenario, the
 decline in residential 
construction alone would yield a negative contribution to 
GDP growth of 1 pp. in 2007.  Based on available estimates 
of the wealth effect in the US (ranging from 2-6% on 
consumption, half of which would be realised within a year), 
consumer spending could contract during three quarters.  
Business investment would also see a sharper deceleration in 
this alternative scenario, although it would be partly offset 
by additional government spending, lower interest rates and 
tax cuts.   
Overall, GDP would fall at an annualised rate of 0.3% in the 
third and fourth quarter of 2007, i.e. a relatively mild 
recession, similar to that of 2001.  Annual GDP growth 
would be 1¼ pp. lower in both 2007 and 2008 compared to 
the baseline forecast. As a result, the household saving rate 
would rise (to around 4%), the general government deficit 
would widen to 4½% of GDP, and the current account deficit 
would improve by around 1 pp. to 5½% of GDP. 
...with some, not overly dramatic, impact on the EU 
Looking at past business cycles, empirical analyses show co-
movements of business cycles between the US and the EU.  
There seems to be some evidence that the US cycle leads the 
EU, suggesting a transmission of US shocks to the EU.  
However, these historical relations may partly reflect the 
occurrence of common shocks in the past. It is not a priori 
certain to what extent a country-specific shock in the US 
would affect the EU economy. If only bilateral trade 
relations are considered, the impact on the EU would be 
relatively limited.  However, if  a  harder  landing  in  the US  
464746Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
- 47 - 
caused a global re-assessment of risks, this could have wider 
repercussions. A harder landing in the US would affect other countries 
through (i) direct and indirect trade effects; (ii) confidence 
effects; and (iii) corporate and financial market linkages.   
Based on simulations using the Commission’s global 
macroeconomic model QUEST, a number of scenarios have 
been simulated to illustrate these channels. Although the 
model simulations only show detailed results for the EU-15, 
the results are likely to be of the same magnitude for the EU 
as a whole.  
The direct trade effect captures the impact of reduced US 
demand for EU exports.  The share in extra-EU exports of 
goods to the US amounted to 23% in 2005 (albeit with 
sizeable differences across countries, with the export share 
ranging in the EU-15 from 11% in Greece to 51% in 
Ireland). However, indirect effects via other trading partners 
reinforce this impact.   
The trade impact from 3
rd countries, particularly from Asia, 
is difficult to quantify with any significant precision.  
Exports to the US have declined to about 20% of Asian 
exports in 2005 (compared to 25% in 2000). In addition, a 
part of the intra-Asia trade is likely to be affected. This 
follows from the integration of global production processes, 
which means that more than 1/3 of intra-Asia trade has 
industrial countries as its final destination. A harder landing 
in the US, as outlined above, is estimated to reduce export 
growth in Asia by around ½ pp. and 1 pp. a year over the 
forecast period. However, domestic demand is expected to 
remain robust. Furthermore, in some Asian countries, there 
could be room for expansionary polices to partly offset the 
impact of the US slowdown. Overall, GDP growth in Asia is 
expected to be reduced to just below 7% a year, implying a 
downward revision by 0.4 pp. in 2007 and 0.3 pp. in 2008 
compared to the baseline forecast scenario. 
A model simulation also includes a counterbalancing effect 
from reduced global interest rates (which are endogenous in 
the model) due to the increase in US savings. Lower interest 
rates will ceteris paribus cause a small increase in 
investment. Taken together, the overall effect implies 
negative spill-over effects on GDP growth by around 
0.15 pp. in both 2007 and 2008 (i.e. an accumulated impact 
of some 0.3 pp. on the EU-15 GDP level). 
However, a GDP impact of a mere 0.3 pp. in the EU-15 of a 
harder landing in the US seems rather benign. Taking into 
account the impact on global equity markets and investor 
confidence, a confide
nce effect in the rest of the world can 
by no means be excluded. Such an effect would offset the 
positive impact on domestic demand from lower   global   
real interest rates. Consumption and, in particular,  
investment  growth  would  be  less  buoyant  than in the first  
simulation. Overall, the estimated spill-over effects to GDP 
are almost doubled, reducing EU-15 GDP growth by around 
¼ pp. a year (i.e. an accumulated impact of some ½ pp. on 
the GDP level). 
The impact of a harder landing in the US on the EU-15 could 
also be more marked. This could follow from e.g. increased 
uncertainty on the financial markets, a re-assessment of 
global risks and a shift in preferences of international 
investors out of dollar denominated assets which could cause 
a depreciation of the US dollar. If such a scenario was to 
materialise, the impact on the EU would also depend on the 
exchange rate policy of other countries, especially the Asian 
ones.  A third scenario has been calibrated to include also the 
impact of a certain depreciation of the US dollar. To allow 
for an illustration of the possible impact on the euro area, it 
has been assumed that the US dollar depreciates by 10% 
bilaterally, while it is assumed that the Asian currencies 
maintain a peg relative to the US dollar. This implies a real 
effective appreciation for the euro of less than 3%. The 
appreciation of the euro and the reduced demand in the US 
would limit exports and raise imports further. On the other 
hand, import prices are also reduced, which would stimulate 
consumption and investment spending. The downward 
pressure on European interest rates is reinforced by the 
assumed shift in investors' preferences, thereby boosting 
domestic demand. This would partly offset the negative 
shock to investment stemming from stock markets 
repercussions and reduced confidence. Overall, GDP growth 
would be reduced by ½ pp. in 2007 and ¼ pp. in 2008 (i.e. 
an accumulated impact of around ¾ pp. on the EU-15 GDP 
level). 
Summing up, a harder landing of the US economy can not be 
excluded. A more marked correction of housing prices could 
cause a mild recession in the US which would dampen the 
outlook. However, the impact is expected to be relatively 
limited. Based on the outcome of model simulations, the 
impact on the EU-15 GDP level is set to between 0.3 to 
0.8 pp. over a two-year period. There are several factors 
explaining a more limited impact than in the 2000-2001 
recession: the shock is of a country-specific nature; corporate 
balance sheets have improved since the dot-com bubble; the 
US slowdown is expected to mainly affect the construction 
sector and private consumption, while the import demand for 
investment goods could hold up well; although house prices 
in some countries appear to be overvalued, developments in 
housing markets are predominantly driven by local 
conditions; growth is increasingly driven by domestic 
demand; temporary factors that held back growth in the past, 
e.g. the long-term adjustment of the German construction 
sector, seem to have petered out; and, structural reform 
efforts may have  contributed to strengthen potential growth.

Forecast
Activity in 2006 
The economic acceleration that started at the end of 
2005 led to strong economic growth in the first half of 
2006, mainly supported by high domestic demand. In 

the second half of the year economic activity is 
expected to decelerate slightly, resulting in annual 
economic growth 
of around 2.7%. 
Private consumption has benefited from increasing 
real household disposable income, mainly due to the 
implementation of the final stage of the 2001 tax 
reform and also to employment growth. The 

acceleration in economic activity and strong business 
confidence have supported fairly strong private 
investment growth. After co
rrecting for the planned 
real estate sales by the federal government (recorded 
as negative investments, but with no impact on 
economic activity), public investment surged in the 

run-up to local elections in October. But it is expected 
to decrease markedly towards the end of the year, 
following a similar pattern to 
that observed in the 
past. Although export expansion was still relatively 
weak in the first half of 
the year, it is expected to 
bring a significant contributio
n to economic growth in 
the second half, supported by strong external demand 
growth.   
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
In 2007 and 2008, econom
ic activity is expected to 
decelerate gradually, as external demand weakens in 
line with the forecast growth in export markets (such 
as Germany and the US), and due to increasing 

interest rates. Overall, economic growth should reach 
2.3% in 2007 and 2.2% in 2008.  
Domestic demand growth is forecast to remain 
relatively high throughout 200
7, mainly as a result of 
robust household consumption expenditure. Only in 

2008 can some deceleration in activity be expected. 
Real household disposable income will continue to 
grow at a high rate, supported by falling inflation and 

robust employment growth in the wake of the strong 
economic activity in 2006. Moreover, the share of 
non-labour income will incr
ease as a result of higher 
interest rates. The household sav
ings rate is expected 
to broadly maintain its cu
rrent level. Sound corporate 
profitability and a high degree of capacity utilisation 

support a stable private 
investment growth (after 
correcting for the impact of government real estate 
sales in 2006). Public investment should return to its 

trend growth. Finally, the con
tribution of net exports 
to economic growth will fall as export growth 
decreases.    
Labour market, costs and prices 
The acceleration in activity that started at the end of 
2005 has also had a po
sitive impact on the labour 
market. Total employment is projected to grow by 

about 1% per year until the forecast horizon. 
However, as in previous years, the impact on 
unemployment is offset by 
the growth of the labour 
force. Wage increases in 20
06 should remain subdued 
in view of the Belgian system of wage indexation and 
a revision of the product basket of the national 

consumer price index. However, despite efforts to 
restrain labour costs, pressures on
 competitiveness are 
building up, mainly as a result 
of the continued wage 
moderation in Germany.  
Primarily as a result of oil price increases in the first 
half of the year, HICP inflation is likely to reach  
2.4% in 2006. From 2007 onwards, it is expected to 

return to a more moderate level below 2%. Inflation 
measured by the nati
onal CPI in 2006 will, 
exceptionally, be lower than HICP inflation, due to 
the revision of the product
 basket and a change in the 
base year. From 2007 onwards HICP and CPI 
inflation are again expected to be about the same.

 SNCB. The deficit for 2005 is therefore 2.3% of GDP 
(rather than a surplus of 0.1%). As for 2006, public 
finances have benefited from the higher-than-

anticipated econom
ic activity. Indirect tax revenue 
was quite buoyant during th
e first half of the year. On 
the other hand, the advance payments on income taxes 

stayed below expectations, and the assessment of 
personal income taxes in 2006 appears to have been 
overestimated by the Belgian authorities by about 

0.3% of GDP. Higher-than-anticipated revenue from 
real estate sales may partly compensate for this loss in 
revenue. Moreover, the authorities plan to bring 

forward the assessment of some corporate taxes from 
2007 to 2006. Overall, 
a deficit of slightly below 
0.2% can be anticipated. This includes the revenue of 

a significant real estat
e operation (0.2% of GDP), 
although it is not yet entirely certain that it will be 
finalised before the end of the year.  
As for 2007, the government plans to replace a 
substantial package of one-offs (around 0.8% of GDP) 
from the 2006 budget with new taxes on packing 
material and tobacco, and other revenue increasing 
measures (close to 0.6% 
of GDP), combined with 
continued expenditure restraint. The government is 
also considering further one-off measures (about 0.4% 
of GDP), but most of these (namely the real estate 

sales and the take-over of pension funds) have not 
been taken into account for the projections, because 
they were not yet sufficiently specified at the time of 

the forecast. Moreover, the government is also 
planning some furthe
r reductions in social 
contributions and limited increases in social benefits. 

Therefore, on a no-policy-change basis, the 
government deficit is expected to increase to about 
0.5% of GDP. For 2008, a bro
adly similar deficit can 
be expected. Meanwhile the 
debt ratio maintains its 
downward path. By the end of 2006, it is expected to 
fall below 90% of GDP for the first time and should 

continue its downward trend until 2008 when it will 
reach almost  83% of GDP.

Activity in 2006 
The Czech economy continued to grow strongly in the 
first half of 2006 driven by increases in private 
consumption and gross capital formation as well as 

net exports.  Fixed capital formation has been stimulated by 
continued inflows of mainly 
export-oriented foreign 
direct investment. Private consumption has been 

boosted by rising household incomes and expanding 
credit. Mortgage lending, in particular, has increased, 
sharply influenced by
 low interest rates and rises in 
disposable income, in pa
rt linked to income tax 
reductions introduced at the beginning of 2006 
affecting the lowest two tax band
s. The upturn in net 
exports in 2005 has been sustained while increases in 
consumer spending appear to be driving imports at 
high rates. On the supply 
side, almost all sectors have 
contributed to the economic expansion. 
Manufacturing, particularly transport-related, has 
grown most strongly, accompanied by strong 

increases in trade and co
mmercial services. For 2006 
as a whole, the economy is likely to at least approach 
the historically high 6% growth rate set in 2005.    
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The solid expansion of the Czech economy is 
expected to continue whilst easing to about 5% in 
2007 and 2008. The pattern of growth is likely to be 

maintained: increasing gross 
fixed capital supported 
by sustained inflows of forei
gn direct investment with 
rising private consumption 
benefiting from increases 
in disposable income. The export sector is also likely 
to benefit from the favourable economic development 
of the Czech Republic's main trading partners. The 
pattern of growth is set to be accompanied by rising 
imports stimulated by private consumption and 

increased investment, as well as a rise in the real 
effective exchange rate. Consequently, the 
contribution to growth from the foreign balance is 

likely to decline. While government consumption has 
been decreasing, the medium-term forecast includes a 
large degree of uncertainty attached to reserve funds 

carried over from previous budgets. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
The strong expansion of the Czech economy during 
2006 has positively affected
 the labour market. 
Employment has risen in the secondary and tertiary 

sectors, largely following the pattern of economic 
growth, with strong rises in manufacturing. The 
increasing demand has been reflected in rising wages 

which may also have been affected by the increase in 
the minimum subsistence income paid by the 
government since the start of 2006 and a substantial 

increase in the minimum wage. The share of long-
term unemployed has d
eclined slightly but still 
remains high as a proportion of overall 
unemployment.  
Although the employment rate is forecast to continue 
rising, the creation of new jo
bs and the fall in the rate 
of unemployment are still like
ly to be tempered by 
structural factors. The intr
oduction of new laws in 
2007 to promote active 
job-seeking, with the effect of 
increasing the difference between earned incomes and 
social benefit contributions, should be a 
counterweight to the wage measures mentioned above 

but overall the forecast for 2007 and 2008 is for a 
weaker increase in the employment rate compared 
with the recent trend. Nevertheless, unemployment, 

already below the average of the EU-25, is expected 
to continue falling, albeit at a decelerating rate. 
Recent rises in wage levels have been largely 
balanced by increased productivity and total unit 

labour costs have remained 
stable, contributing to a 
relatively low inflationary environment. Consumer 
price inflation has risen slight
ly during the first half of 
the year due principally to utility charges and rises in 
fuel prices whilst the impact of rising oil prices has 

been partially offset by the continued appreciation of 
the koruna against the dollar.

Public finances 
The government deficit was originally estimated to 
have fallen from 3.0% in 2004 to 2.6% in 2005. 
However, following a revision of the budgetary 
execution, principally the estimate of accrual-based 

taxation, gross fixed capital and other capital 
expenditure, the deficit was revised upward to 3.6% 
of GDP – still considerably below the 2005 deficit 

target of 4.7% of GDP set out in the 2005 
Convergence Programme. 
Higher-than-expected 
revenues from increased growth and lower-than-

anticipated expenditure due in part to the carryover of 
unspent funds promoted a more favourable budgetary 
position. 
 The deficit for 2006 is 
expected to be below the 
government target of 3.8% at about 3½% of GDP. 
This takes into account the new measures in 2006 to 

lower taxation on personal inco
me and the settlement 
of a guarantee to the Czech National Bank, estimated 
at ½% of GDP, connected to
 the stabilisation of the 
Czech banking sector. 
The deficit is expected to remain broadly similar in 
2007 taking into account increases in social spending 
approved before the 2006 parliamentary elections and 

rises in indirect taxation including excise duties. 
In 2008, the deficit is expected to decrease slightly to 
approximately 3¼% of GDP based on the no policy 
change assumption and continuing robust growth. 
The government debt ratio is projected to increase to 
about 31% of GDP in 2008.

%Activity in 2006  
The economic recovery in Denmark, which 
accelerated in 2005, has maintained its momentum in 
2006. After a relatively hesitant first quarter, real 

GDP growth improved again in the second quarter. In 
the first half of the year real GDP growth reached 
3.5% compared with the same period a year earlier. 

This is somewhat higher than the real GDP growth of 
3.0% recorded in 2005. As in 2005, private 
consumption has continued to be the main driving 

force and grew by 4.5%. This expansion has been 
supported in particular 
by a progressive fall in 
unemployment, a booming housing market and still 

relatively low interest rates. Moreover, investment, 
which took off in 2005, has provided a further 
impetus to the economy and grew overall by 13.5%. 

As for the external sector, both exports and imports 
have accelerated further in 2006. Exports of goods 
and services grew by about 13% in the first half of the 

year, but due to buoyant private consumption, 
growing capacity constraints 
in the domestic economy 
and a high import content 
in exports, imports grew 
even stronger by more than 18%. Consequently, net 
exports contributed negatively to GDP growth.  
Economic indicators continue to provide a positive 
picture of the short-term 
prospects for the Danish 
economy. Consumer and business confidence are at 
historically high levels, with the industrial, 

construction and services secto
rs all generally positive 
about sales and productio
n. Given this setting, the 
developments observed so far are expected to 

continue for the rest of the year and real GDP is 
foreseen to grow at about 3% for the year as a whole. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
GDP is expected to continue to grow at a healthy pace 
over the forecast horizon and, as in 2006, growth is 
projected to be driven by domestic demand. However, 

widespread capacity constraints in the domestic 
economy and a moderation in private consumption are 
expected to curb growth to 2¼% in 2007 and 2008.  
Private consumption is expected to moderate as 
interest rates increase and the wealth effects of the 
sharp increase in house prices taper off. Since mid-
2006, the increases in real estate prices have shown 

clear signs of levelling 
off, notably in the 
metropolitan areas and for 
summer cottages. The number of properties for sale in the market has also 

increased significantly. While a general price fall 
cannot be completely disregarded, there are few signs 
of a major forthcoming correc
tion in real estate prices, 
though this remains a downside risk. Investment is 
envisaged to continue to slow down over the forecast 
period, also due to higher interest rates and a 
slowdown in housing construction. However, high 
capacity utilisation, combin
ed with labour shortages 
and good profitability, is expected to provide an 
impetus to business investment.  
As in 2006, imports are expected to grow more than 
exports. Net exports are therefore expected to 

continue contributing negativel
y to growth in the first 
part of the forecast period. In 2008, however, 
following a moderation in domestic demand and a 

recovery in external demand, net exports are expected 
to start contributing po
sitively to growth. 
Labour market, cost and prices 
In 2006, employment has picked up further and 
unemployment has fallen to below 4% of the labour 

force. At the same time, capacity utilisation is high in 
the industrial sector and most sectors are reporting 
rapidly increasing shortages of labour. 
Despite this general shortage 
of labour, the increase in 
wage growth has so far been moderate and there are 
few signs of wage-driven 
inflation in the overall 
economy. This is somewhat surprising but can be seen 
as an effect partly of low inflation expectations and 
partly of increasing effects of globalisation. It is likely 

that mounting competition from the new Member 
States and emerging markets is 
playing a role, insofar

(see also box 2.2
).as the threat of outsourcing a

having a dampening effect on wages. Nevertheless, 
wage pressures are expected to increase moderately 

over the forecast period.  
Consumer price inflation continues to be moderate 
and slightly below the euro area average at around 
2%. Domestic inflation has gradually been increasing 

due to higher cost pressures, but can still be 
considered to be rather 
low. Over the forecast period, 
capacity constraints and growing wage pressures in 

the economy are expected to result in clearer upward 
pressure on inflation. At the same time, counter-
pressure from lower energy prices should contribute 

to maintaining consumer 
price inflation at the current 
level.  Public finances  
Over the last few years th
e general government has 
recorded sizable surpluses of about 3% and 5% of 

GDP in 2004 and 2005 respectively. As a 
consequence of still relativ
ely healthy economic 
growth and high oil prices, and hence high tax 
revenue, this situation is expe
cted to continue over the 
forecast period. However, as a consequence of a fall 
in revenue from the pension yield tax, which was 
exceptionally high in 2005 due to favourable 

developments in financ
ial markets, and slightly lower 
oil prices, the surpluses are expected to be somewhat 
lower than in 2005, at around 4¼% of GDP through 

to the forecast horizon. With continued strong 
surpluses the gross debt 
ratio is expected to be 
reduced further, to well below 25% of GDP in 2008.

Activity in 2006 
Growth in the first half 
of 2006 was substantially 
higher than expected. While in 2005 net exports were 
the main growth driver, recently domestic demand has 

been picking up, particularly machinery and 
equipment investment. In addition, after more than a 
decade of continuous decline, construction has been 

staging a recovery, interrupted only by cold weather 
in the first quarter. The corresponding rebound 
contributed to an exceptionally high growth rate of 

0.9% (quarter-on-quarter) in the second quarter. 
However, half of this growth originated from 
substantial stockbuilding in view of an expected surge 
in domestic demand in the seco
nd half of the year, in 
anticipation of the increase in the standard VAT rate 
from 16% to 19% from 1 January 2007. Finally, the 

football World Cup boost
ed service exports.  
Recent indicators point to slightly lower but 
continuing strong growth in the second half of 2006. 
This is confirmed by incoming orders, production and 

labour market data, and all coincident survey 
indicators like the ifo index for the assessment of the 
current business situation.  The profile of private consumption will be heavily 
influenced by the VAT increase. While in the first 
half of 2006 the an
ticipation effect was not clearly visible in either retail sales or car registrations, 
substantial additional demand is expected in the 
second half. The consumer confidence sub-index 

reflecting the intention to make major purchases has 
been escalating recently and orders to the automotive 
industry in the first hal
f of 2006 have been strong. 
Investment is also being
 substantially affected by 
planned and recently introduced budgetary measures. 
First, housing investment is being brought forward 

before the VAT increase. This effect is reinforced by 
the abolition of the sub
sidies for owner-occupied 
housing still valid for the immense number of 

building permit applications before the end of 2005 as 
well as by new subsidies for energy-saving 
construction measures. C
onsequently, the downward trend in residential construc
tion, which has lasted for 
a decade, was halted already in the first half of 2006. 
Second, corporate investment 
is profiting from the 
enhanced depreciation rules valid until the end of 
2007. Both positive developmen
ts in the first half of 
2006 will continue in the remainder of the year. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
In 2007, the negative effect from the anticipation 
described above will weigh on private consumption, 
overshadowing the positive underlying growth trend. 
Subsequently, in 2008 private consumption will again 

be a strong growth driver. The savings rate of private 
households is projected to 
reflect these developments, 
arriving at a lower level in 
2008 compared 
with 2005.  
The swings due to budgetary measures will be lower 
in investment because its different components are 
affected over different years. While housing 

investment will suffer in 2007, corporate investment 
will remain strong in 2007 bu
t fall back in
 2008 when 
the enhanced depreciation ru
les will no longer apply.  
As a result of these swings in domestic demand, net 
external demand and domestic demand will take turns 
as the main growth driver during the forecast period. 
565756Chapter 3 Member States, Germany - 57 - 
Net external trade will contribute most to GDP growth 
in 2007, but in 2
008 domestic demand will again 
become the main growth 
driver, as it was in 2006. 
Price competitiveness of German exports will 
continue to improve due to high productivity gains in 
2006 and lower social secu
rity contributions from 
2007 onwards. Consequently, the external surplus is 
forecast to increase further. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
The labour market situation 
is becoming significantly 
more favourable. Unemployment is on a clear 

downward trend and employment is growing. Most 
importantly, for the first 
time in several years, the 
employment increase also extends to jobs subject to 

social security contributions. 
Against the improving 
labour market situation and 
solid corporate profits, wages may become more 
dynamic in the private sector. In 2008, this could be 

the case also for the public sector. The negative drift 
between effective pay and contract wages is expected 
to narrow. In addition
, lower social contribution rates 
from 2007 onwards will increase net wages but, via 
the effect on employer's contributions, dampen the 

growth of compensation of employees. Consequently, 
real disposable income is expected to increase in 2006 
and 2008, though it would fall in 2007 due to the 

higher VAT rate. Unit labour 
costs will continue to 
decline due to strong produc
tivity growth in 2006 and 
the reduction in non-wage la
bour costs in 2007. In 
2008 employee compen
sation will grow in line with 
productivity, leaving unit labour costs unchanged. 
During the remainder of this year, assuming falling oil 
prices, inflation is expected to ease despite sporadic 

price increases before the VAT increase, for example 
for tobacco. At 1.8% on 
average, inflation will be 
slightly lower this year than
 in 2005. In 2007, 
inflation will be driven by the increase in the standard 
VAT rate, a significant share of
 which is expected to 
be passed on to consumers. With this effect fading 

out, inflation will fall to slightly above 1% in 2008.  
Public finances 
The general government defic
it is projected to fall 
from 3.2% of GDP in 2005 to 2.3% in 2006 and hence 

below the 3%-of-GDP refer
ence value for the first 
time since 2002. Earlier this year, in spring, the 
Commission services projected the 2006 deficit at 
3.1% of GDP. 
The major contribution to 
this improvement in the 
budgetary outlook for 2006 comes from the revenue 

side. The tax burden is projected to increase 
marginally compared with th
e previous year, whereas 
in spring, it was projected to remain unchanged. 

Revenues from indirect taxe
s and social contributions 
are growing in line with 
their tax bases, while the 
payroll tax base is developing somewhat more 

favourably than previously projected. However, the 
main drivers behind the 
positive revenue surprise are 
direct taxes, which are yiel
ding substantially stronger 
revenues than tax base developments would suggest. 
As part of the budgetary package adopted in autumn 
2005, some direct tax allowances were cut back while 

others were increased. For example, some income tax 
loopholes were closed. In contrast, some household 
services were granted favourable tax-treatment and 

depreciation rules on non-fixed capital were made 
more generous. Although the fiscal effects from these 
measures tend to cancel each other out in 2006, 
advance payments on profit-related taxes in particular 
are exceeding expectations. 
General government expenditure is being kept under 
control in 2006, despite th
e higher-than-anticipated 
revenues. Total expenditure is projected to grow by 
0.8% as projected in spring. The unexpectedly high 

GDP growth, however, redu
ces the expenditure share 
in GDP compared with the previous year by one 
percentage point. In particu
lar, positive labour market 
developments have led to a reduction in related 
expenditure, especially in un
employment insurance 
(Arbeitslosengeld I
). This is administered by the 
Federal Employment Agency, whi
ch has continued to 
reduce spending on active labour market policy. A 
further factor that has led to the unexpectedly high 

surplus in th
e Agency’s cash ba
lance is however budget-neutral in ESA95 accounting: The national 
authorities required co
mpanies to bring their monthly 
social contributions forward 
to the end of the month 
when the payment is due as opposed to the middle of 
the following month. Th
e resulting thirteen instead of 
twelve cash payments in 2006 have provided one-off 
cash relief for the social security system. Public 

consumption recorded strong growth in the first half 
of this year, which shou
ld abate somewhat in the 
second half, while interest expenditure and subsidies 

are projected to contribute to consolidation. The

 cyclically-adjusted balance 
is projected to improve by 
0.4 percentage points in 2006, reflecting the tax 
revenue developments. 
In 2007, the general government deficit is projected to 
fall to 1.6% of GDP. The increase in the standard 
VAT rate should boost revenu
es by about 1% of GDP. 
Without this, the tax share in GDP would have 

declined, because revenue-rich tax bases are 
developing less dynamically than GDP. The 
unemployment insurance co
ntribution rate is set to be 
reduced from 6.5% to 4.5%, while the pension 
contribution rate is raised from 19.5% to 19.9% as 
announced by the govern
ment. Under current 
legislation, public health insurers are projected to 
increase contribution rates by ½ a percentage point. In 
sum, the tax burden is expected to slightly increase. 

The expenditure ratio should decline by ½ percentage 
point or more, reflecting p
ublic sector wage restraint 
and reduced labour-market-related spending, resulting 

from measures already implemented, such as the 
reduced benefit duration for older recipients, and 
favourable labour market developments. The 
cyclically-adjusted balance would improve by 0.8 
percentage points in 2007. Under the assumption of 
unchanged policy, in 2008 the general government 
deficit is projected to declin
e to 1.2% of GDP, due to 
improving cyclical con
ditions and to lagged 
consolidation effects of measures already in force. 
The envisaged company taxation reform is not 

considered here, as not enough details were known at 
the cut-off date for this publication. The government 
debt ratio is projected to fall only slightly over the 

forecast period, from 67.9% of GDP in 2005 to 67.7% 
of GDP in 2008. In 2006 and 2007, the debt ratio is 
positively affected by below-the-line operations, in 

particular privatisations, while such transactions are 
not sufficiently cert
ain for 2008 to be included here.

Estonia - Contribution to GDP growth of 
                  expenditure groups
Activity in 2006 
GDP growth accelerated during the first six months of 
2006 to a booming 11.7% year-on-year, up from an 
already high average 10.5% in 2005. In the second 

half of 2006, growth is expected to slow down 
somewhat, leading to an annual figure of below 11% 
for the year as a whole. This slight deceleration is 

likely to be both demand-driven – as growth rates of 
private credit and real estate prices have started to 
come down – and imposed by increasing supply 

bottlenecks, in particul
ar on the labour market. 
The driving forces of the ve
ry strong activity this year 
are primarily domestic demand, especially for private 
consumption, as households increase spending based 

on growing disposable inco
mes, and for investment, 
which is reinforced by strong final demand and 
favourable monetary conditions. By contrast, the pace 

of government consumption remains below that of 
overall GDP growth. Foreign trade activity remains 
very strong, on both the import and the export side, 

with the net export contribution turning negative 
again in early 2006.  
Booming private consum
ption and investment, 
accompanied by the oil-price-induced weakening of 
the terms of trade, pushed the current account deficit 
back to over 12% of GDP in
 the first half of 2006. 
The external account deficit, including EU capital 
transfers, while slightly smaller, confirms the trend 
reversal. The external imbalance was mainly boosted 

by an increase in the foreign trade deficit while other 
components of the current account continued to 
improve.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The economy is projected to remain on a brisk growth 
path over the entire forecast period, with growth rates 
gradually down to more sustainable levels of around 

8½% by the end of th
e forecast period.  
Domestic demand is expected
 to continue to drive 
growth, primarily led by investment, with housing 
construction still contributing, but at a slower pace. 

Private consumption is also forecast to remain robust, 
due to a combination of employment growth and 
substantial real wage gains. Th
e comparative cost 
advantage will continue to 
boost export growth, but 
imports are expected to grow even more strongly.  
In line with a moderation of growth rates and an 
assumed easing of oil prices, the external account 

deficit is expected to resume narrowing again, to 
below 10% of GDP by 2008.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
As in 2005, buoyant economic growth led to 
significant employment
 growth and a marked 
reduction of unemployment to record low levels in 
2006. The labour market continued tightening and 
wages accelerated rapidly, with a possibility of a 
temporary mild overshooting of wages in 2006.  
Employment gains are likely to
 continue in 2007 and 
2008, albeit at a considerably slower pace, given the 
rapid narrowing of the labour reserve. More and more 
sectors, including in manufacturing, are facing labour 

shortages, exacerbated by 
emigration. However, since 
structural unemployment is relatively high due to 
skills mismatches, the remaining unemployment rate 

is not indicative of available labour resources. Over the forecast period, the 
high degree of flexibility 
which marks the Estonian labour market is projected 
to bring real per capita wages b
ack into line with high 
productivity gains in 2007 and 2008. A continuation 
of cuts in personal income tax rates over the forecast 
period, will allow net wages to grow more rapidly 

than gross wages. The main risk to this forecast lies 
with excessive wage 
growth resulting 
from the drying 
out of the labour market. 
Annual HICP inflation increased from an annual 4.1% 
in 2005 to 4.4 % over th
e first three quarters of 2006, 
reflecting continued strong energy price increases. 

Core inflation has also started to pick up lately, as 
have producer prices, reflecting pass-through effects

from the oil price hike as well as domestic 
inflationary pressures due to
 high economic growth 
and the tightening labour ma
rket. A postponement of 
excise duty increases is expected to ease upward 
pressure temporarily in 2
007, with the full effect 
hitting inflation in 2008
. Risks to this inflation 
forecast are quite balanced, with oil price and 
exchange rate development
s representing important 
uncertainties. Public finances 
Stronger-than-projected growth further fuelled 
revenues and reduced social expenditure in 2006, thus 
enabling the government to raise the surplus 
projections for the forecast period. A supplementary 

budget raising expenditure by 1.7% of GDP has 
recently been proposed by the government.  Despite 
upcoming parliamentary el
ections, the budgetary 
situation is forecast to remain solid over the forecast 
period, with general govern
ment surpluses slowly 
declining from around 2½% of GDP in 2006 to 
around 1½% by 2008, in line with a gradual 
deceleration of economic activity. 
With budgetary surpluses revised upwards, 
government debt, which already is negligible in size 
and several times covered by government assets, is 
forecast to decline even more rapidly than previously 

projected, to around 2% of GDP by the end of 2008.

Activity in 2006
1  In both the first and the second quarter of the year, 
economic growth accelerated to above 4% on an 
annual basis. However, although domestic demand is 

expected to remain robust 
also in the second half of 
the year, higher import growth will mean that the 
contribution of the external sector to GDP will be 

negative. As a result, growth is estimated at 3.8% for 
2006 as whole, which is comparable with the 2005 
outcome and well above the euro area. A highly 

dynamic investment activity is behind the acceleration 
of domestic demand, while private consumption is 
slowing down and public 
consumption, reflecting 
fiscal consolidation effort
s, should contribute only 
marginally to growth. Although the fiscal 
retrenchment is also putting a brake on public 

investment in real terms, equipment and construction, 
including housing, are driving
 total investment growth 
above 6%. The tax reform on housing implemented in 

2005, sustained credit expansion and, due to higher 
inflation in Greece, still negative real interest rates are 
inducing a significant increase in construction 
permits. Overall, domestic demand is expected to 
contribute by more than 
4 percentage points to 
growth, partially offset by a negative contribution of 
the external sector. While, on account of the rebound 
taking place in the tourism sector, exports will still 

grow above 6½%, imports are projected to strongly 
rebound from the contraction recorded last year. 
Consistent with sustained 
growth, employment is 
projected to increase by 1¼%, in line with the rate 

recorded in 2005. As 
regards prices, annual HICP 
inflation is projected at 3¼%, well below nominal 
wage growth at close to 6%, which, given 
productivity growth of about 2%, is pushing unit 
labour costs clearly above those of the euro area. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Although the Greek economy is projected to 
decelerate only marginally over the forecast horizon, 
some changes in growth 
composition are expected to 
take place. In particular, economic activity is likely to 

be almost exclusively demand-driven. GDP is 
projected to grow at just below 3¾% in both 2007 and 
2008. Rising interest rate exp
ectations, coupled with 
somewhat more moderated wage growth, will induce 
a further slowdown in private consumption growth, 
though it will remain above 3% per year until 2008. 

Government consumption is expected to go back to 
historical rates, closer to GDP growth, while public 
investment is projected to co
ntinue growing at rates as 
high as this year. Although, the second phase of the 
tax reform on housing 
should have a lower positive 
impact on construction than in 2006, which should 

moderate the expansion of the housing market, 
equipment is projected to continue growing at healthy 
rates. In addition, public 
investment is expected to 
return to long-term 
trend growth rates. Overall 
domestic demand is forecast to contribute about 4% 

until 2008. On the external front, imports are 
projected to keep pace with domestic demand, while 
the positive differential in 
terms of unit labour cost 
growth is likely to weigh on competitiveness and 
slightly slow down exports of goods. Exports of 
services are expected to return to growth rates more in 

line with historical trend
s, following the statistical 
rebound of last year. This 
coupled with a more 
moderate growth of imports, on the back of slower 

private consumption and in
vestment, is expected to 
result in a contribution of the 
external sector to GDP 
growth less negative in 
2007 and 2008. Consistent 
with these developments, the current account is 
projected to attain 7½% of GDP in 2008, compared 
with around 8½% this year. Labour market, costs and prices 
In line with strong economi
c activity, employment is 
projected to still increase above 1¼% per year until 
2008. The unemployment rate is accordingly expected 

to decrease by around ¾ per
centage points to below 
9% for the first time in some years. Although growing 
by less than last year, in line with better inflation 

prospects, wages per head are set to keep rising above

ow the increase in unit 
labour costs, but still worsen the country’s 
competitive position, especially in the goods sector. In 

2007 and 2008, inflation is expected to moderate in 
line with lower unit labour costs and limited oil price 
hikes. 
Public finances 
The 2005 deficit was r
ecently revised upwards to 
5.2% of GDP, reflecting a further revision in the 
accounts of extra-budgetary funds and of social 
security by about ¾% of GDP. Coincidental with the 

official estimations, the deficit for 2006 is projected 
just above 2½% of GDP, in line with the Council 
recommendation under Article 104(9) of the Treaty. 

This includes one-off revenues of 0.4% of GDP.  
The 2007 draft budget targets a deficit of 2.4% of 
GDP. No deficit-reducing one-offs are contemplated. 
Total revenues are budgeted to
 rise by more than ¼% 
of GDP, mainly through higher indirect tax revenues 
and social contributions. Total expenditures would 
decrease by ¼% of GDP, mostly due to lower interest 
expenditures. On account of 
a slightly less favourable 
growth scenario and a more 
prudent assessment of 
expenditures, which takes account of past outcomes, 
the Commission services pr
oject a deficit of 2.6% of 
GDP. Measured by the cyclically-adjusted balance net 
of one-offs, the structural balance would improve by 
around ½% of GDP. Based on the customary 

unchanged legislation assumption, the 2008 deficit is 
projected at just below 2½% of GDP. After reaching 
more than 107% of GDP in 2005, the general 

government debt ratio is projected to decrease to 
below 100% of GDP by 2008.

Activity in 2006 
Strong economic activity con
tinued to prevail during 
the first half of 2006, underpinned by dynamic 
domestic demand. The external sector is still 

contributing negatively to growth, albeit by much less 
than last year. Industrial production and confidence 
indicators point to a continu
ation of these trends over 
the rest of the year. As a result, GDP growth is 
projected to remain strong at 3¾% over the whole of 
the year, above the 3½% recorded in 2005. Supported 

by strong job creation and still easy monetary and 
financial conditions, private consumption still 
outpaces the growth of disposable income. The 

households saving rate could come down to 9½% in 
2006, from 10½% in 2005. Gross fixed capital 
formation remains strong. 
Investment in construction 
is growing at the same 
strong rate of 2005, and 
investment in equipment is 
also expanding at close to 
the two-digit mark. Domestic demand should 

contribute around 4½ percentage points to GDP 
growth this year. 
Exports recorded a strong rebound during the first half 
of the year, largely led by the recovery of activity in 
the euro area, with no changes as regards 
competitiveness. The inflatio
n differential with the 
euro area has remained broadly stable at around 1½ 
percentage points, but productivity growth is 
stagnating at ½%, compared with 1¼% in the euro 

area. While exports could grow by around 7% in 2006 
(1½% in 2005), imports seem to be accelerating only 
slightly and, as a result, the negative contribution of 

net exports to growth is expected to decline to around 
1 percentage point in cont
rast with the 1.7 percentage 
points recorded in 2005. The trade deficit should 
widen to 8% of GDP by the end of the year.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
In 2007, GDP growth is proj
ected to fall slightly, to 
3.4%. Economic activity should still be based on 

buoyant domestic demand. Real interest rates should 
remain close to zero and keep on sustaining private 
consumption, which is expect
ed to grow at a similar 
pace as disposable income. The households saving 
rate could slightly increase to ju
st 9¾%. Investment is 
projected to remain robust, especially in equipment 

and software, whereas residential construction growth 
is expected to moderate. Overall, domestic demand is 
projected to contribute 4¼ percentage points to GDP 

growth in 2007.  
Export growth would increas
e by close to 5% in real 
terms, although it may suffer somewhat from the 
lower GDP growth projected for the euro area. 

Imports, projected to decelerate 
in line with private 
consumption, should go on increasing well above 
GDP on the back of strong investment in equipment. 
Overall, the deceleration of both imports and exports 
would broadly cancel each other out and, thus, the 

negative contribution from net exports to GDP growth 
should remain broadly un
changed at 1 percentage 
point, while the trade deficit should widen to 8¾% of 

GDP.  
GDP growth is projected to decrease marginally in 
2008 to 3.3%. Lower inflationary pressures should 
further increase real interest rates, putting a brake on 

private consumption and investment in dwellings. The 
latter would also lead to a slowdown in gross fixed 
636363Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 Spain 
- 64 - 
capital formation. Since gross 
disposable income will 
still be growing at a similar pace to that of private 
consumption, the househo
lds saving rate will remain 
broadly stable, while household’s indebtedness is 
projected to keep on rising
 over the forecast period, 
attaining more than 130% of the gross disposable 

income by 2008. Overall, domestic demand, though 
decelerating, will contribute to GDP growth by 
around 4 percentage points. 
The projected deceleration of domestic demand 
should moderate import growth to slightly above 6%. 
A recovery of Spain's main trade partners in the euro 
area is expected to sustain exports, the growth of 

which could attain 5½% by the end of the forecasting 
period. However, export growth will still be 
insufficient to compensate that 
of imports and, as a 
result, the trade deficit might 
peak at up to 9% of 
GDP. All in all, the negativ
e contribution to GDP 
growth from the external sector should decrease to ¾ 

of a percentage point. 
External imbalances are projected to broaden over the 
forecast horizon. On top of the projected widening of 
the trade deficit, the surplu
s recorded by services will 
expand only slightly, while the deficit in the balance 
of primary incomes will 
rise, in line with rising 
interest payments on external de
bt. The deficit in the 
balance of current transfers keeps on reflecting larger 
remittances abroad by 
immigrants. As the services 
surplus will no longer offset the aggregate deficits in 
the primary income and current transfers accounts, the 
current account deficit is expected to be larger than 

the trade deficit and might rise to 10% of GDP by the 
end of the forecasting period. Net borrowing from the 
rest of the world is projected to reach 9½% of GDP, 

on account of the expected reduction of EU transfers. 
Since there is no evidence to suggest a rebound in 
foreign direct i
nvestment inflows, portfolio 
investments, mainly channelle
d by domestic financial 
institutions, should continue to represent the main 
source of financing for the external deficit in Spain.  
There might, however, be some downside risks to this 
growth scenario, especially those associated to the 
inflation differential, the household indebtedness and 

the external imbalance. However, on current 
information, the likeliho
od of a drastic slowdown 
appears small for several reasons. First, albeit 

remaining high, the inflation differential with the euro 
area is being reduced as energy prices ease. Second, 
in spite of the risin
g borrowing position of 
households, mortgage repayment failures remain at 
the lowest historical levels, underpinning the short-

term solvency of the private banking system. Finally, 
while the external deficit is not projected to recede, 
the stock of debt of the coun
try, which could attain 
140% of GDP in 2008, does not depart significantly 
from other euro area members, such as France or 
Germany, while remains below others, such as Ireland 

or The Netherlands. 
Labour market, costs and prices  
Job creation is projected to remain robust over the 
forecast period. In 2006, employment growth will be 
slightly above 3% (full-time equivalent). Construction 

and services are the main sources of job creation, 
whereas in the manufacturing sector employment 
creation remains stable. In 
line with slightly slower 
economic activity, with 
labour-intensive sectors, such as construction, expected to contribute less to GDP 
growth, job creation should be more moderate, but 

still close to a sizeable 3% in 2007 and 2½% in 2008. 
Coupled with a slower rate of growth of the working-
age population, this will lead to
 a further fall of the 
unemployment rate to below 7½% by 2008. 
Following the oil price hike 
at the beginning of 2006, 
HICP crossed the 4% threshold in yearly terms. 

Lower oil prices during th
e second half of the year, 
however, should ease infla
tionary pressures, leading 
to an average HICP of 3¾% 
in 2006 as a whole, still 
well above the euro area. In the absence of further 
energy price hikes, inflation is projected to decline to 
around 2¾% in 2007 and 2008. The inflation 

differential with the euro area, 
currently at one and a 
half percentage points, should indeed decline, but 
would remain at about 1 percentage point over the 

forecast horizon. This differential reflects a more 
advanced cyclical position of
 the Spanish economy, as 
well as structural factors, such as insufficient 

competition in certain utilities
 and services sectors.  Compensation of employees per head is projected to 
closely follow inflati
on developments. Therefore, real 
wages should remain sta
ble. In spite of an 
acceleration of productivity in the manufacturing 
sector this year, productivity growth for the economy 

as a whole should remain close to ¾% by the end of 
the forecast period, thus below the euro area.

 The combination of a po

Public finances 
In 2006, the general 
government surplus is projected 
at around 1½% of GDP. This is well above the targets 
in both the updated 2005 Stability Programme (0.9%) 
and the 2006 Budget Law (0.2%). Higher-than-

expected revenues seem to be behind this unexpected 
better result.  In 2007, the Draft Budget Law targets a surplus of 
0.7% of GDP. The reducti
on of the surplus is 
explained by the impact 
on total revenues of the 
implementation of the new personal income and 
corporate tax law, as 
well as lower capital transfers from the EU. Specifically, total 
revenues in 2007 
should grow slightly below nominal GDP growth, at 
around 6¼%. On the spending side, central 

government expenditure is projected to grow in 
nominal terms somewhat above nominal GDP (by 
around 7¼%). However, since the revenue projections 
may turn out somewhat conservative, the final 

budgetary outcome could be more favourable than 
targeted in the draft budget.  
In 2008, assuming the customary no-policy-change 
scenario, the general government
 surplus could attain 
just below 1% of GDP. Revenues are projected to 
grow at around 6%, slightly below nominal GDP, 
reflecting fewer indirect taxes associated to lower 

dynamism of both private consumption and 
investment in dwellings. Total expenditure is assumed 
to follow previous trends and increase at around 7% 

in nominal terms. 
Although primary surpluses should decline from 3% 
in 2006 to 2¼% in 20
08, the debt-to-GDP ratio is 
projected to continue decreasing markedly, from 40% 

of GDP in 2006 to 
around 35% in 2008.

The economic situation in 2006  
In 2006, GDP growth gained momentum and is 
expected to average 2.2%, compared with 1.2% in 
2005. GDP growth is still la
rgely driven by domestic 
demand although the contribution of the external 
sector, which has acted as a drag on growth in the last 
three years, is likely to beco
me neutral towards the 
end of the year.  
The expansion of economic activity continued in the 
first half of 2006 and 
in particular in the second 
quarter when GDP growth rebounded by 1.2%. 

Although this performance is 
unlikely to be repeated 
in the second half of the year, economic activity is 
expected to remain buoyant. Employment growth has 

shown encouraging signs, especially in the second 
quarter of 2006. In addition, annual HICP inflation 
has remained close to 2.0% in 2006 and is thus not 

weighing on private consumption, which is expected 
to remain the main driver 
of economic growth in the 
coming quarters. Exports are on an upward trend as a 

result of the economic 
recovery in Europe. After a 
loss in market shares over the last three years, export 
volumes increased again, more in line with the 
expansion of external demand. This is due to the 
depreciation of the euro and a concomitant 

improvement in pr
ice competitiveness and a 
somewhat stronger demand from France’s main 
trading partners. As imports are expected to grow in 

line with robust domestic demand, the contribution of 
net exports to GDP growth should still be close to 
neutral in 2006 (-0.1 %), after -1.2 in 2005.  
 Prospects for 2007 and 2008  
In 2007 and 2008, real GDP growth is projected to 
remain robust and close to cur
rent estimates of 
potential growth. It is expe
cted to still be largely 
driven by domestic demand and especially by private 
consumption.  
Private consumption is forecast to remain the main 
driver of economic growth. Consumption will 

increase in line with households' disposable income, 
reflecting both the expected rise in the demand for 
labour and cuts in personal income tax planned in 

2007. The projected benign inflation outlook should 
also support households’ 
purchasing power. Finally, 
the relatively strong housing market and the 

implementation of new mortgage financing conditions 
may also support private consumption and housing 
investment. 
Companies are still likely to 
focus their efforts on 
cutting costs due to the deterioration of corporate 
profit margins linked to the strong past increase in 
commodity prices. But considering the fact that the 
capacity utilisation rate is now 
slightly above its long-term average and the need for some firms to upgrade 

and replace their production capacity, investment in 
equipment is expected to accelerate from 3.5% in 
2006 to around 5% in 2008. In addition, continuing 

supportive financing conditions and a buoyant 
economic outlook 
should lead firms 
to implement 
their investment plans. Although slightly less dynamic 

than in 2006, investment 
in construction is expected 
to remain buoyant over the forecast period. 
In the external sector, exports are set to slow down in 
666766Chapter 3 Member States, France - 67 - 
line with the expected weakening of external demand. 
In a context where imports are forecast to remain 
buoyant in view of robust final demand, the 

contribution of net trade to GDP growth will again 
become slightly negative 
in 2007 and 2008.  
Labour markets, costs and prices 
In 2006, employment growth is expected to increase 
by ¾ percentage point. Uncertainties concerning the 

durability of the recovery and
 the traditional lag with 
which employment reacts to economic activity largely 
explain the current weakness 
in employment growth. 
In 2007 and 2008, employment growth is set to 
gradually strengthen in response to the improved 
economic situation. The recovery of employment 

should also be stimulated by the gradual 
implementation of the “em
ergency employment plan” 
which aims to facilitate recruitment by small 

companies and encourage pe
ople to return to work. 
Given the still high unemployment rate, wage 
moderation is expected to continue. Nevertheless, a 
slight cyclical acceleration in wages is expected to 
occur in 2007 and 2008, driven by the improvement 
of the situation in the 
labour market. As productivity 
growth is expected to de
celerate from the high rate 
observed in 2004, unit labour costs should rise by 2% 
in 2007 and in 2008
. Core inflation is thus projected 
to pick up gradually, 
due to price increases in services 
and some pass-through effects of raw materials prices. 
Nevertheless, given the difficulties for companies to 

fully pass the increase in commodity prices on to final 
customers, due to the high competition from low-cost 
countries, prices of manufactured goods are expected 

to rise only modestly. 
Inflationary demand pressures 
should remain subdued due to the persistent negative 
output gap. In this context, annual HICP inflation 

should be slightly below
 2% in both years.  
Public finances 
Following a decline from 3.7% of GDP in 2004 to 
2.9% of GDP in 2005
1, the general government deficit 
is projected to be further reduced to 2.7% of GDP in 

2006, in line with the government objective. The 
reduction in the deficit compared
 to 2005 is the result 
of (a) an acceleration in GDP growth (from 1.9% to 
2.2%) which boosted revenues, and (b) a slowdown in 
expenditure. On the revenue side, buoyant 

consumption (VAT), higher corporate profits 
(corporate tax) and a better employment performance 
(income tax) are expected to lead to higher-than-
expected revenues (about EUR 0.3% of GDP), which 
would result in an increase in the tax burden to 44.1% 

of GDP despite the tax cuts implemented in 2006 
(increased employment pre
mium, tax exemption for 
new investment, etc.). On 
the expenditure side, 
health-care and other social expenditures slowed 
down thanks to the measures taken under the health-
care reform and the better employment performance. 

Taken together, this slowdown would more than 
compensate the still rapid pa
ce of expenditure growth 
in the local administrati
on sector notably in 
connection with a 
rebound in local investment linked 
to upcoming local elections 
in 2008. As a result the 
expenditure-to-GDP ratio is expected to decrease by 

0.3% of GDP to 53.5%. The 
reduction in the deficit 
will still rely by up to 0.2% of GDP on one-off 
elements in connection with the transfer to social 

security of postal sector employees’ pension 
commitments and the exceptional collection of social 
contribution on specific savi
ng plans that were to be 
collected at a later stage. The 2006 deficit forecast 
implies an improvement in the structural balance (the 

cyclically-adjusted-balance ne
t of one-offs) by 0.6 % 
of GDP.  
The deficit forecast for 2007 of 2.6% of GDP 
incorporates the measures presented in the 2007 draft 

budget for the State and the social security sector. The 
main measures are: (a) the income tax reduction
2   (0.2% of GDP), (b) an increase in the employment 

premium (0.05% of GDP), (c) lower tax rates on new 
capital expenditure (0.06% of GDP). Together with 
other small items, th
ese measures will increase the 
deficit by about 0.4% of GDP. However, as revenues 
are still expected to be strong –  the tax-to-GDP 
elasticity would still be sli
ghtly higher than the historical average – the revenue-to-GDP ratio is 
forecast to only decrease by 0.3% of GDP. On the 
expenditure side, the expenditure-to-GDP ratio is 

forecast to decrease by 0.4% of GDP. This stems from 
opposite movements. It includes the biggest 
innovation of the 2007 dr
aft budget, which consists in 
the implementation of 
a stricter expenditure ceiling 
for the State: after four years of zero growth in real 

terms, State expenditure is expected to decrease by 
1% in real terms (about -0.2% of GDP), as announced 
in the 2006 update of th
e French stability programme. 
Also, the draft budget includes a reduction in the 
number of civil servants
3, which has a lasting positive 
impact on the deficit (about 0.03% of GDP) and thus

 helps support the implementation of the new 
expenditure ceiling. Also, a significant decrease in 
social expenditures is expected notably thanks to the 

better employment performance. On the contrary, 
expenditure from local administrations, which did not 
agree to implement any new expenditure rule and/or 

ceiling, contrary to what was announced earlier, are 
expected to continue growing at a rapid pace. 
Concerning health-care expenditure, the expected 

annual increase in spending (by 2.7%) is expected to 
be slightly higher than that foreseen by the 
government (2.5%) based on a prudent assessment of 

some of the measures announced in the 2007 draft 
budget bill for the social security sector. In structural 
terms, the 2007 deficit forecast implies an 

improvement of 0.3% of GDP.
4  The deficit forecast for 2008 of 2.2% of GDP follows 
the conventional assumption of unchanged policies.  
After a rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio by 2 percentage 
points to 66.6% of GDP in 2005, the government 
committed to reduce it by 2 and 1% in 2006 and in 
2007, respectively. Debt re
duction, based on the full 
allocation of privatisation receipts to debt reduction
5, and a better overall management of the debt (notably 
of the cash-flow) of the different general government 

entities, requires substantial efforts but seems within 
reach.                                                           
 1 In 2005, the deficit was reduced by one-off revenues totalling 0.6% of GDP 
in connection with (a) the inclusion of the specific electricity and gas 
companies’ pension schemes in the general regime and (b) the change in the 

corporate tax code.
 2 The income tax reform reduces the number of income brackets and 
marginal tax rates, notably the highest from 48.9% to 40%. 
 3 The downsizing is larger than in preceding years (about 1 in 5 retiring civil 
servants will not be replaced) although less ambitious than the original target 
of 1 in 2 announced after the last presidential elections.
 4 The reduction in the deficit includes 0.05% of GDP of one-off revenues in 
connection with a change in the corporate tax code and the advanced 
collection of social contribution on saving plans.
 5 In 2006, privatisation receipts amounted to about 0.1% of GDP.

Activity in 2006 
According to preliminary data, real GDP expanded by 
5.3% on the year in the first 
half of 2006. As in 2005, 
economic growth was driven by domestic demand. 

Private consumption conti
nued its strong performance 
from 2005, supported by solid employment and 
disposable income growth.
 Investment expenditure 
remained strong, in particular 
in housing, although the 
contribution of fixed investment to growth was 
somewhat lower than 
in recent years. This reflects, in 
particular, a much higher base in the previous year for 
both equipment (including some one-off purchases of 
aircraft) and housing stoc
k investments. On the 
external side, merchandise export performance has 
improved only slightly as compared to 2005, and 
remains subdued overall by historical standards. 

Services exports performed strong
ly in the first half of 
2006, reflecting notably strong growth in business and 
financial services. Imports re
mained strong, in line 
with solid private cons
umption, though reflecting 
some fluctuations in dema
nd for fixed capital.  
For the third quarter, purchasing managers’ indices 
reported increased activ
ity for manufacturing and, in 
particular, for services. Confidence indicators broadly 
confirm the pick-up in activity across the board, 

though there have been some fluctuations in consumer 
and construction sector sentiment. Overall, prospects 
for the second half of 2006 remain positive. The 

economic momentum is supported by recent 
employment gains (mainly concentrated in the 
construction and services sectors), boosted by strong 

immigration flows and increased participation. On the 
external side, services should buoy overall exports. 
For the year as a whole, real GDP is estimated to 
grow at around 5¼%.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Real GDP is projected to grow by around 5¼% in 
2007 before decelerating to around 4¼% in 2008. In 

2007, domestic demand growth is expected to remain 
very solid with a further acceleration of private 
consumption growth, support
ed notably by the release 
of SSIA funds (a govern
ment-sponsored saving 
scheme) into the economy. 
Into 2008, 
however, this stimulus will not be 
repeated, while investment 
growth is projected to moderate over the forecast 
period. Housing completions are forecast to taper off 
in 2007 and 2008 from the very high levels recorded 

in recent years. A pick-up in investment in house 
improvements (stimulated by the SSIA release), 
strong infrastructure invest
ment and commercial 
construction are partly expected to offset the impact 
of the downward correction in new residential 
construction. On the extern
al side, both merchandise 
and service exports are projected in line with 
performance in 2006. Import growth is projected to 
remain strong in 2007 and to
 moderate into 2008, in 
line with the assumption that part of the SSIA funds 
will be spent on imported du
rable goods. As net profit 
outflows are expected to remain on an upward trend, 
the implied growth rate 
of gross national income 
(GNI) is somewhat lower than
 that of GDP. While the 
most recent data suggest that robust growth will 
continue over the medium term, it also seems that the 
vulnerability of the economy
 has somewhat increased. 
In particular, the extended
 residential construction 
boom and accelerating house prices, coupled with the 
significant increases in ho
usehold indebtedness, are 
noteworthy risks over the medium term; any marked 
slowdown in the US eco
nomy would also weigh 
heavily. Labour market, cost and prices 
In 2006 employment growth 
is projected to remain at 
an extremely robust 4.4%. In line with a strong 
performance by the services sector, partly offset by 
some easing of constructio
n activity, employment 
gains are forecast to be somewhat weaker but still 
remain solid over the forecast period. Labour force 

growth, fuelled by significant inward migration 
(notably from the recently acceded EU Member 
States) and increased participation, is projected to 

keep pace with the upward employment trend in 2007.

 However, new additions to the labour force are not 
expected to be matched fully by employment growth 
in 2008. The unemploymen
t rate is thus estimated to 
remain at around 4¼% in 2006, 
before rising slightly 
and reaching 4¾% in 2008. In line with the pay 
element of the new social partnership agreement 

negotiated in 2006, 'Towards 2016', annual growth in 
annual per capita compensation is estimated to 
stabilise at 4½% over the forecast period. HICP 

inflation picked up strongly in the course of 2006, to 
more than 3%, partly as a result of adverse energy 
price developments. Due to a base effect, the annual 

rate is nevertheless expected to moderate slightly in 
2007 despite the projected pick-up in private 
consumption and to fall again into 2008. CPI inflation 

is expected to be above that of the HICP over the 
forecast period, with the difference reflecting the 
expected increase in average mortgage repayments. 
 Public finances     
In 2006, general government is estimated to record a 
surplus of around 1.2% of GDP, compared to the 
initial official target of a 
0.6% deficit. The strong 
result reflects in particular 
the property market 
buoying capital taxes and, to a much lesser extent, 
lower-than-budgeted expenditures, especially capital 

outlays. The surplus is projected to fall to 0.9% of 
GDP in 2007 and 0.4% in 2008. However, compared 
with these proj
ections, the macroeconomic risks, if 
realised, have the potential to
 worsen the general 
government balance signifi
cantly. Given the non-
indexed tax and benefit systems, the no-policy-change 

assumption for 2007 is made operational, in the 
absence of announced measures, by freezing average 
tax rates and adju
sting social transfer payments by the 
forecast CPI inflation rate (with a small top-up). 
Government debt is projected to fall from 25.8% of 
GDP in 2006 to below 24% of GDP in 2008.

Activity in 2006 
Following stronger than expected economic growth in 
the first two quarters of the year, economic indicators 
suggest that activity is likely to remain dynamic in the 
second half of the year. Quarterly
 GDP growth is 
forecast at 0.5% in Q3-2006 and slightly lower in 
Q4-2006, at around 0.4%. In 2006 as a whole, 

economic growth is expected to be 1.7%.  
The significant contribution of private consumption 
and gross fixed capital formation to GDP growth in 
the first two quarters of 2006, as well as positive 

indications for the services sector, suggest that 
domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. 
Given the stronger demand from the euro area, the 

contribution to economic 
growth from net exports is 
expected to turn positive; 
however, the recovery in exports is still not expected to keep up with the 

projected expansion of export markets. 
After the modest performance in 2004 and 2005, 
employment growth is back
 on a surprisingly solid 
footing. Measured in full-time equivalents, the 
increase is expected to be 1.3% in 2006, while the 
head-count is projected to ri
se by 1.7%, largely driven 
by people aged over 50, immigrants and women. The 
increase in employment is the result of both an 
increase in participation and a decrease in 

unemployment, whereas the statistical effect of the  
regularisation of immigrants is fading away.  
Annual HICP inflation is projected to average 2.3% in 
2006. Although industrial producer prices of final 

consumption goods accelerated over the first half of 
the year, there is no major evidence of any significant 
pass-through of high oil prices to the HICP.   
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Against the background of
 both the expected  
softening of economic conditions for Italy's main 
trading partners and the fiscal policy stance, economic 

activity in 2007 and 2008 is expected to grow at a 
more subdued pace than in 2006, around 1.4%, in line 
with the current estimate of
 potential growth.    Over 2007-2008, domestic demand is expected to 
continue to be the main
 driver of GDP growth, while 
the contribution from net 
exports is expected to 
become broadly neutral.   
In 2007, private consumption is projected to slow 
down also due to fiscal consolid
ation, which is 
expected to offset the effect of ongoing job creation.  
A decrease in the household
 saving rate will moderate 
the deceleration in consumption. 
The mitigated demand prospects are expected, in turn, 
to slow down investment expen
diture, particularly its 
housing component. Nevertheless, gross fixed capital 

formation is expected to be supported by still 
favourable financial conditions as well as the 
measures aimed at improving infrastructure foreseen 
in the 2007 budget. Over
all, after the recovery 
recorded in 2006, investment expenditure in 2007 is 

projected to increase by around 2%.  
Concerning the external sector, imports should 
decelerate in line with final demand. Export volumes 
are set to continue growing at higher rates than in the 

recent past, although slightly below those recorded in 
717171Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 Italy 
- 72 - 
2006. However, they will expand at a slower pace 
than projected for the corresponding export markets, 
due to persistent competitiveness problems and 

exporters' price policies.  Labour market, costs and prices 
The projected positive economic growth in 2007 and 
2008 is likely to continue to push employment up, but 
at the slower pace of 0.5% per year measured in 

full-time equivalents. Concerning the impact on 
employment growth of the measures foreseen in the 
2007 draft budget, the effect of the reduction in the 

labour tax wedge on permanent contracts will be 
partly offset by the increase in social contributions, mainly for workers on temporary contracts. The 

unemployment rate is expected to decrease further to 
7% in 2007 and rem
ain stable in 2008.  
The labour content of growth is expected to be 
slightly lower than in 2006 thanks to higher 

productivity gains, projected at around 1% in both 
years. However, still constrained by structural factors 
that limit the Italian eco
nomy's capacity to innovate, 
labour productivity growth 
is expected to remain 
slightly below the euro area average. The improving 

productivity outlook should 
result in a slowdown of 
unit labour costs, which in turn should have a positive 
impact on the competitive position of the Italian 

economy and somewhat mitigate the loss of market 
shares. Firms will also benefit from the cut in the 
labour tax wedge through a reduction of the labour tax 

base of the regional tax on productive activity (IRAP) 
that is foreseen in the 2007 draft budget.  Annual HICP inflation is expected to slow down to 
2% in 2007 and 1.9% in 2008, broadly in line with the 

euro area average. The liberalisation measures 
adopted or planned so far 
by the government will, if 
effectively implemented, contribute to lower prices.   
Public finances 
The 2006 budget balan
ce is affected by the negative 
impact of recent court rulings. The most important 
was issued in September by th
e European Court of 
Justice (ECJ) against Italy's VAT regime for company 
cars. It entails the refunding of
 unduly paid VAT over 
2003-2005 and lower VAT revenue as from 2006. In 

line with government's estimations, the amount of the 
expected one-off reimbursements for the years 
2003-2005 is assumed at around 1% of GDP, whereas 
the permanent negative impact on annual VAT 
revenue is estimated at over ¼% of GDP
1. Hence, 
despite higher-than-expected tax revenues, the deficit 

is estimated at 4¾% of GDP in
 2006, up from slightly 
above 4% in 2005. Th
e primary balance is expected to 
turn slightly negative.  
The net budgetary impact of one-off and temporary 
measures in 2006 is estimated to increase the deficit 
by around ½% of GDP, as the impact of the above 
refunds is partly offset by sizeable temporary 

revenues from su
bstitutive taxes on the revaluation of 
companies' assets and proceeds from the sale of real 
estate. The structural deficit (defined as the cyclically-

adjusted deficit net of one-off and temporary 
measures) would improve by over ¼% of GDP 
relative to 2005. Excluding th
e impact of the ruling on 
VAT, the deficit would be just below 3½% of GDP 
and the structural adjustment over ½% of GDP.  
In the draft budget for 2
007, the governme
nt targets a 
deficit below 3%, as required by the Council 

recommendation to Italy under Article 104(7) of July 
2005. The draft budget and the accompanying 
legislation adopted by the government on 29 
September
2 combine deficit-reducing measures 
estimated at 2¼% of GDP with new expenditure and 

tax cuts totalling 1¼% of GDP. This would bring the 
deficit to around 2¾% of GDP, from an official trend 
of 3¾% of GDP. The latter already includes the 

impact of around ½% of GDP corrective measures 
adopted at the end of June and additional ¼% of GDP 
taxes to compensate for th
e permanent loss in VAT 
revenues linked to the ECJ ruling. The budgetary 
correction is revenue-based. It includes revenues 
stemming from the transfer of part of the severance 

pay scheme of private sect
or employees (TFR) from 
enterprises to the nati
onal social security institution (INPS), amounting to more than ¼% of GDP. 

National accounts treat TFR flows as social 
contributions as they are eventually paid back to 
employees as social benefits. Hence, this measure 

does not improve fiscal sustainability. 
The 2007 deficit is forecast at just below 3% of GDP. 
For a number of measures in the draft budget, the 

budgetary impact is projected to be in line with the 
official estimations. Fo
r others, the Commission 
services' estimation is more prudent. This is notably 

the case for the measures aiming to fight tax evasion, 
the impact of which cannot be easily anticipated.

 The primary balance is forecast to 
turn positive at just 
below 2% of GDP. Interest expenditure as a share of 
GDP is expected to increase slightly. Net of cyclical 

factors and the 0.1% of GDP of one-offs stemming 
from the sale of real estate and other measures 
foreseen in previous budgets
, the budget balance is 
estimated to improve by 
over 1% relative to 2006. 
Over 2006-2007, the overall structural adjustment will 
be close to 1½% of GDP.   
Risks on both the negativ
e and the positive side are 
attached to the deficit forecast for 2007. On the one 
hand, a lower deficit might be achieved if the 
mechanisms to curb expenditure foreseen in the 

present and previous budgets are fully implemented 
and/or the fight of tax 
evasion is more effective than 
assumed. A better carryover from 2006 is also 

possible given the positive ou
tturn in the first half of 
the year. On the other hand
, expenditure overruns in 
particular in the health care sector and by local 

governments could lead to a higher deficit. Also the 
size of additional revenu
es stemming from the TFR 
diversion is subject to 
considerable uncertainty.  
The 2008 deficit forecast at just above 3% of GDP is 
based on the customary no-policy-change assumption.   
Largely as a result of the impact of the ECJ ruling on 
the VAT regime for company cars, the government 
debt is forecast to increase from 106.6% of GDP in 
2005 to 107.2% in 2006. The debt ratio is then 

expected to decline to 105.9% in 2007 and, based on 
an unchanged policy scenario, to remain broadly 
stable in 2008.

has been provisionally fully accrued as "other capital expenditure" 
in 2006. The accounting consequences of the court ruling are still to

Activity in 2006 
Economic activity remained strong in the first half of 
2006. Real GDP growth in
 the first two quarters was 
3.4% and 3.8% year-on-
year, respectively. Growth is 
projected to further accelerate in the third quarter of 
the year and decelerate in the fourth quarter, which 
should lead to GDP growing at 3.8% over the whole 

year. Economic activity is being mainly driven by 
strong domestic demand. Although slightly 
decelerating compared with last year, private 

consumption remains 
healthy, supported by 
historically low interest rates
 and sustained credit 
expansion, as well as by continued employment and 

wage growth. In parallel, buoyant private investment 
in construction, particularly housing, as well as a 
rebound in equipment, is accelerating investment to a 

5% growth rate. Overall, domestic demand is 
projected to contribute ar
ound 4 percentage points to 
GDP growth. This will be only slightly offset by the 

negative contribution of net exports. Reflecting weak 
re-export activity, which slowed 
down in the first six 
months of the year, exports of goods should almost 
stagnate compared with the past two years. 
Concurrently, despite the decline of tourism arrivals, 
revenue from tourism actually increased in the first 8 
months in real terms, wh
ile export-or
iented services are benefiting from the positiv
e outlook in the main 
export markets. Total exports are now projected to 
grow at close to 6% in real terms. This is very close to 
the rate estimated for total 
imports, which should 
follow strong domestic demand and investment 
activity. Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
GDP is projected to continue growing solidly at 3.8% 
in 2007 and 3.9% in 2008, driven by domestic 
demand, which would contribute around 4 percentage 

points to growth. Increasing disposable income, 
supported by sustained wag
e and employment growth, 
will keep private consumption growing at still high 

rates, but lower than this year on account of rising 
interest rate expectations. Investment should remain 
robust and continue growing 
by close to 5% per year 
until 2008. This expansion of investment will be 
mainly driven by construction, underpinned by the 
strong demand for dwelli
ngs by non-residents and 
also by other large projects. Moreover, confidence 
effects linked to the prospects 
of joining 
the euro area 
should also sustain total 
investment through higher 
investment in machin
ery and equipment. 
Although the projected slowdown in private 
consumption should put a 
brake on imports, higher 
investment in equipment should keep them growing 

until 2008 at rates comparable
 to last year. Based on a 
stronger growth outlook for the EU and other main 
trading partners, exports should accelerate especially 
tourism and other services. As a result, the net 
borrowing vis-à-vis the rest 
of the world is projected 
to remain broadly constant at around 5½% of GDP for 
the forecast period.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
In line with buoyant economic activity, employment 
is projected to keep growing at around 1½% per year 

until 2008. However, higher 
participation should keep 
the unemployment rate aro
und its current level. 
Moreover, higher participation, especially by foreign 

workers, combined with mode
rate wage growth in the 
public sector, should ensure that wage pressure does 
not increase, in spite of tight labour market 

conditions. Since productivity growth is expected to 
rise by slightly above 2½% by 2008, unit labour costs 
will stay on a positive trend, but at lower rates than in 

the recent past. 
Following the developments 
in the oil markets, after 
the price hike at the beginning of the year and the war 
in Lebanon, HICP inflation 
increased in the first 
seven months of 2006. However, lower oil prices

 oil prices and slightly restrict
ive monetary conditions 
would help rein in
 inflation. HICP inflation is 
projected to ease to 2.0% in 2007 before rising again 

to 2.4% in 2008, in line with projected energy prices. 
This projection does not take account of the impact of 
some VAT adjustments, due by end-2007, required to 

comply with the Community 
acquis
, since their 
precise timing and implementation modalities are not 
yet known.  
Public finances 
The government deficit for 2006 is projected at 1.9% 
of GDP, in line with the officially estimated figure. 
No one-offs are included
, as the initially budgeted 
0.3% of GDP from temporary revenues from building 

permits have not materialised. Such lower temporary 
receipts have been compensated by higher-than 
expected tax revenues. Since one-offs in 2005 

amounted to almost 1% of GDP, the structural 
balance (the cyclically-adj
usted balance net of one-
offs) will improve by around 1¼% of GDP this year.  
The 2007 draft budget targets a deficit of just above 
1½% of GDP. No one-off measures are planned. The 
fiscal adjustment is mainly dr
iven by tax revenues, 
partially offset by the reduction of EU funds. Total 
revenues are budgeted to rise by almost a ¼% of 
GDP. Expenditures would remain unchanged in terms 

of GDP, as the reduction in th
e interest payments is 
offset by higher social transfers. The Commission 
services project a slightly higher deficit (1¾% of 

GDP) on the back of a more prudent growth scenario. 
Net of any one-offs, the fiscal adjustment would be 
about ¼ of GDP, reflecting 
the deterioration of 
Cyprus' net position vis-à-vi
s the EU budget after the 
phasing out of temporary compensating grants. Under 
the customary no-policy-change scenario, the deficit 

for 2008 is projected to 
inch down, slightly below 
1¾% of GDP. Debt is projected to keep on 
decreasing, attaining abou
t 59½% of GDP by 2008.

Activity in 2006 
In the first half of 2006, real GDP increased by 12.0% 
compared with the same period a year earlier, which 
is by far the fastest growth rate since Latvia regained 

its independence in 1991. The expected slowdown to 
more sustainable levels ha
s not yet set in, thereby 
increasing risks from overheating. The major driving 

force of economic growth was private consumption 
rather than the 
external sector, 
resulting in an 
expanding import/export gap and growing external 

debt. The strong economic performance was based on 
output sectors reliant on domestic demand. The 
highest growth in the fi
rst half of 2006 was recorded 
in distribution (18.2%) and construction (16.7%). 
Transport, storage and communications posted a year-
on-year gain in output of 8.6% while the relatively 

low growth rate in ma
nufacturing (6.5%) mostly 
reflected a sluggish performance of the wood 
industry, still affected by th
e 2005 storms in the 
Northern Europe, and a slower rise in new export 
orders. Consequently, expo
rt performance was much 
weaker than expected: export values grew by 14% 
year-on-year against 37% in the corresponding period 
last year. At the same time, import performance, 

fuelled by persistently 
strengthening domestic 
demand, remained robust, expan
ding by just over a 
quarter. The external imbalance widened. An 

improved service balance could not compensate for 
the wider merchandise trade deficit and the current 
account deficit rose to over 16% of GDP from 10.8% 

in the corresponding period of the previous year. On 
the positive side, net inflows of foreign direct 
investment increased substantially to 9% of GDP.  
The economy's momentum is 
likely to be maintained 
in the second half of 2006, supported by significant 
EU-funds-related activity, 
increased labour 
participation and declining unemployment. For the 
year as a whole, real GDP is estimated to grow by 
around 11%, after the 10.2% recorded in 2005. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008
 Growth prospects for 2007-2008 are strong, with an 
expected expansion of about 9% in 2007 and 8% in 
2008. In consequence overheating is likely to remain 
evident throughout 2007, with some relief possible 

only in 2008 as capacity catches up. Final domestic 
demand is expected to continue to drive overall 
growth led by investment, w
ith housing construction 
increasing strongly. Private consumption is also 
expected to remain strong, given employment growth, 
substantially higher real wages and easy credit access. 
While the high levels of inv
estment in equipment and 
production facilities will underp
in export growth, the 
relatively high base level and some short-term 
saturation of foreign markets (the wood sector in 
particular) will moderate expo
rt expansion to rates 
below those achieved in 2005. Import growth is 

expected to remain robust due to the increase in 
investment and demand for inputs of intermediate 
goods. The extern
al contribution is expected to remain 
negative, although exports 
are likely to recover from 
their poor performance in 2006. 
The current account deficit is expected to widen 
further and peak in 2007, prior to a slight reduction in 

2008; given net receipts of capital transfers, external 
net borrowing is slightly less. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
In 2006 high economic growth has contributed to 
reducing unemployment and 
boosting employment. In 
line with the projected
 expansion of the construction 
sector and a strong performance of the service sector, 
employment gains are expected to remain robust 

albeit not as strong as in 2006; annual productivity 
growth is forecast to remain in the order of 7-8%. The 
labour market will remain 
tight: on the supply side 
significant outward migration and negative 
demographic trends will offset a rising activity rate, 

while labour demand will be sustained. 
Unemployment should contin
ue to decrease rapidly.

After a slowdown in 
February-April 2006, HICP 
inflation rose to 7.1% in May, the main reasons being 
increased gas tariffs and fuel prices and higher hotel 

and catering charges. Since then inflation has 
stabilised at slightly less than
 7%, with several 
increases of regulated prices having fuelled inflation, 

while falling oil prices have acted as a brake. 
Extended and aggravated overheating remains the 
main risk to the in
flation outlook. Price increases 
could become persistent if st
rong demand continues to 
drive output above its potential level, exacerbates 
earnings pressures and feeds into general inflation 
expectations. Taking the risks into account, the central 

prospect is assessed to be for HICP inflation to 
average around 6¾% in 2006 and only modestly 
lower in 2007 and 2008. 
Public finances 
In the first eight months of 2006 the inflow of tax 
revenues exceeded plans by 11%. All tax categories 
surprised on the upside except the excise tax, which 
itself reached very close to the planned amount. The 
general government budget
 recorded a cumulative 
cash-based surplus of about 2.6% of GDP, which was 
entirely absorbed by a 
supplementary budget 
approved by the Parlia
ment on 19 October. 
Altogether, the final deficit outturn for 2006 seems 
unlikely to be significantly lower than the budgeted 
1.5% of GDP. Looking ahead, judging by the 

opinions voiced by the 
political parties that are likely to form the new government following the October 
2006 general election, there will be no major changes 

in economic and budgetary strategy, although 
substantial tax reform pro
posals are likely when the 
2007 budget is even
tually presented. On the basis of 
announced policies, the deficit is expected to remain 
at around 1% of GDP in 2007-2008. Government debt 
is projected to approach 10% of GDP at the end of the 

forecast period. 77777713. Lithuania Inflationary pressures and tightening labour market

Activity in 2006 
Real GDP grew by around 8½% in the first half of 
2006, with domestic demand remaining the driver for 
growth. A recent accident in the oil-refining industry 

could lead to some slowdown in the last quarter of 
2006. In spite of this, 
overall growth is estimated to 
remain buoyant at around 8%. 
Investment recorded a robust 
growth in the first half 
of the year and is expected to lead growth in the 
whole of 2006. Private consumption expenditure is 
forecast to remain strong, stimulated by an increase in 

household disposable income following cuts in the 
personal income tax in Ju
ly 2006, significant wage 
growth and increasing employment. The slowdown in 

oil refining activities could 
affect the imports of crude 
oil and exports of processed o
il products in the last 
quarter of 2006. The deterioration of the trade balance 

seen in the first eight months of the year should be 
confirmed as the trend for the whole year. The net 
borrowing vis-à-vis the rest
 of the world is expected 
to widen to almost 8% of GDP compared to slightly 
below 6% in 2005 due to a 
combination of a higher 
merchandise trade deficit, a lower services balance 
surplus and a worsening of 
the income balance while 
the net current transfers, main
ly due to EU funds, will 
exert a moderating influence.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The outlook for growth in 2007 and 2008 remains 
favourable. Real GDP growth
 is projected to slow 
down but remains robust at well above 6%. Domestic 

demand should continue to be the driver while the 
external contribution stays negative. Delays in 
capacity recovery in oil refinery could pose some 
downward risk to industrial activity in 2007.  Investment activity is forecast to remain strong, aided 
by EU funds and favourable, albeit somewhat less 

benign financial conditions. 
After years of buoyant 
activity, some moderation could come from the 
construction sector on the back of a cooling of the 

housing market. A positive 
income and employment 
outlook for households s
hould nevertheless sustain 
developments in the real estate market. 
Private consumption growth is forecast to remain 
strong due to high wage 
growth, a further cut in 
personal income tax in January 2008 and higher 
amounts paid to the population as compensation for 

losses during the shift fro
m the Russian rouble to the 
national currency. Nevertheless, some deceleration is 
expected in line with lower real 
income growth due to 
higher inflation and relatively slower improvement in 
the labour market. A potentially more moderate bank 
credit growth could also have a dampening effect on 

consumption. 
The outlook for exports remains benign, reflecting 
positive prospects for Lithuania's major trading 

partners, while import growth is forecast to remain 
robust on the back of strong domestic demand. A 
widening trade deficit and a lower services balance 

surplus will result in ne
t borrowing vis-à-vis the rest 
of the world remaining around 8% of GDP. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
The labour market is tighten
ing rapidly in 2006. 
Employment growth is picking up, while the 

unemployment rate is in ma
rked decline. This is the 
result of the combined effect of strong economic 
growth and increased labour 
shortages, partly due to 
emigration flows.  
Looking forward, the labour market is likely to 
tighten further. Unemploy
ment is expected to 
continue to decrease, although at a slower pace and 

stabilise to around 5%. Employment growth is 
anticipated to remain 
positive, although at lower levels than in 2005-2006
. Against this background, 
nominal wage growth is expected to remain high.  
Annual average HICP inflation rose to 3.5% in 
September 2006 from 2.7% in 2005, mainly due to 

rising energy, food, health and services prices 
(notably hotels and restaurants). In July 2006,

Lithuania's single gas supplier increased wholesale 
gas prices by some 30% in a move towards increasing 
gas prices supplied to Lithuania to the level of 

Western Europe. Regulated prices for central heating 
have not yet been fully adjusted to reflect the higher 
gas prices and thus the main impact on consumer 

prices is expected in the 
second half of 2006 and in 
2007. In addition, another increase in gas prices is 
expected in the course of 2007 
with another lagged 
adjustment of heating prices and possible second-
round effects. An increase of the excise duties on 
tobacco and fuel will also add to inflation, while a 

favourable evolution of oil prices could ease some 
pressure on inflation. Against
 this background, annual 
average inflation in 2006 is projected to be just below 

4% and rise to around 4½% in 2007. In 2008, 
inflation is expected to decline but remain above 3%.  
 
 Public finances 
In 2006, the general government deficit is likely to be 
1% of GDP, that is, lower than the initial government 
target. A supplementary budget adopted in July 2006 
increased government expenditure by around ½% of 
GDP but revenues are also 
higher than expected. The 
deficit is forecast to deteriorate in
 2007 and 2008, 
mainly due to the tax and pension reforms and higher 
primary spending partly offset by an improved tax 
collection, high VAT revenues and higher excise 

taxes. The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is 
anticipated to remain at around 20%.

Luxembourg - Employment and GDP 
                     growth
Activity in 2006  
Growth accelerated in the course of 2006 and will 
probably reach more than 5% on average over the 
year, up from 4% in 2005. Domestic demand has 

remained dynamic, most likely on the back of a 
rebound of investment from the very low growth rates 
recorded over the last three years (only 1.5% on 

average). Private consumption is expected to grow at 
about 3½%, as in 2005, boosted by strong 
employment growth and, linked to it, the expected 

considerable rise in 
the total wage bill (more than 
7½% in 2006). On the other hand, government 
consumption, which had been rather dynamic in 2005, 

growing by 4.8% in real terms, is likely to have 
decelerated somewhat as a result of the adjustment 
measures decided by the government in April-May. 

Last but not least, foreign trade ha
s been buoyant in 
2006: both total exports and imports grew by more 
than 10% in real terms, with exports and imports of 

services growing by at least 15%.  The contribution to 
growth of net exports, 
which was slightly negative in 2005, is expected to be 
markedly positive this year. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Real GDP growth is projected to remain fairly strong 
in Luxembourg in the coming years though somewhat 
weaker than in 
2006. Domestic demand is likely to 
slow down somewhat, although investment, which 
has picked up in 2
006, is expected to accelerate in 
2007 and to slow down only marginally in 2008. 

Private consumption could slow down slightly and 
government consumption should continue to 
decelerate as a result of the recent adjustment 
measures. However, the main reason for the lower 
GDP growth will probably be
 foreign trade, which, 
though remaining dynamic, will probably not remain 

as buoyant as in 2006, because the demand from the 
country's main trading partners is expected to 
decelerate. Overall, GDP growth could reach about 

4¼% to 4½% in 2007 and 2008. 
Labour market, costs and prices  
After rising by slightly less th
an 3% in 2005, 
employment growth accelerated in the course of 2006 
to about 4% year-on-year in the last few months. In 

total, employment is expect
ed to expand by about 
3¾% this year. In 2007 and 2008, employment 
growth is expected to slow 
down very slightly, only 
partly reflecting the (moreover limited) deceleration 
in output as already observed in 2001-2003.  
The rather strong employment 
growth in recent years 
had mostly benefited non-residents who now exceed 

one third of the total labour force in Luxembourg. As 
a result, unemployment has been rising since mid-
2002. However, with the acceleration in job creation, 
the rise in unemploymen
t has significantly slowed 
down in the course of 2006 and its yearly increase in 

recent months has been by far the smallest since it 
started rising in 2002. With employment growth 
projected to remain strong over the period, this should 

eventually lead unemployment 
to stabilise and then to 
begin declining, probably in the course of 2007.  
Due mostly to the large increase in oil prices that 
occurred in the first half 
of the year, both the HICP 
and the national CPI are expected to rise by about 3¼ 
% and 2¼% respectively in 
2006 (the more limited 
increase in the national CPI being due to the fact that 

it excludes consumption by
 non-residents and 
especially their large purchases of car fuel, alcohol 
and tobacco products). However, under the 

assumption of a much more limited increase in oil 
prices in 2007 and 2008 than in 2005-2006, inflation 
is projected to significantly decrease over the period, 

with a more pronounced deceleration in the HICP 
than in the national CPI 
for the same reason that the 
former had increased faster in 2005 and 2006.

slightly improved in 2005 to -1.0% of GDP. This 
recently released result, which compares to an initial 
forecast of a deficit of 2.3% of GDP, is chiefly due to 

higher-than-expected revenues, especially from 
corporate taxes and more particularly stemming from 
the payment made by a single company that had 

originally been scheduled for 2006. In 2006, the 
deficit is expected to broadly stabilise due to higher 
than expected revenues, especially from direct taxes, 

generated by strong output and employment growth 
but also to a series of adjustment measures decided 
last spring by the government and the social partners 

in order to cope 
with the deterioration in public 
finance and to reinforce the competitiveness of the 
economy. These measures mainly consist in increases 

in several contributions and taxes and in a temporary 
(up to 2009) suspension of the normal indexation of 
wages and social benefits on consumer prices. In 

2007, the deficit is projected to improve more visibly 
thanks to still rather robust output and employment 
growth and to the lasting effects of the adjustment 
measures decided in 2006, which should result in 
some slowdown in expenditure growth.  In 2008, 
under an "unchanged policy" assumption (implying in 

particular that the adjustment measures decided last 
spring will be carried out as planned), the deficit 
should continue improving. The government debt, 

though remaining very low (6.1% of GDP in 2005) is 
projected to rise by 1.5 percentage point of GDP in 
2006 because several 
loans related to roads and 
railways infrastructure projects will be issued during 
the year for a total of about 1 % of GDP.

Activity in 2006 
After relatively strong growth
 of 4.2% in 2005, real 
GDP continued to grow at a sustained pace in the first 
half of 2006, mainly driven by buoyant government 

consumption and net exports. For the year as a whole, 
GDP is expected to increase 
by 4%, supported by a 
balanced contribution of domestic and external 

factors. While some slowdown in government and (to 
a lesser extent) household consumption can be 
expected in the second half of the year as a result of 

the Government’s new fiscal consolidation strategy, 
the growth of gross fixed capital formation is forecast 
to remain relatively high. External trade is also 

expected to continue to ex
pand dynamically thereby 
providing a strong positive contribution to growth. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The Government’s new budgetary consolidation 
strategy endorsed by the Parliament in July 2006, 

which aims to create the basis for sustainable growth 
over the medium to long term, is expected to dampen 
domestic demand in the short run. The biggest impact 
is expected for 2007 when real GDP growth is 
forecast to fall to 2.4%. As a consequence of 

contracting real disposable income on the back of tax 
and regulated price increases, household consumption 
is expected to decrease by ½%. For the same reason, 

investment in housing construction is also forecast to 
drop significantly. This, to
gether with a sharp slow-
down of investment in non-residential construction, 

leads to an overall deceleration in gross fixed capital 
formation. The positive c
ontribution of net exports is 
forecast to increase as import demand decelerates 
more than exports, which 
should result in an 
improvement of the balance of goods and services. In 
2008, with domestic demand slowly recovering, real 

GDP is expected to grow
 by 2.5%, still primarily 
driven by net exports. Th
e current account deficit is 
expected to fall below 4% of GDP by 2008. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Lay-offs in the public sector, increasing production 
factor costs and the overall impact of cyclical 
conditions are expected to slightly decrease 
employment in 2007 with 
a minor pick-up expected 
for 2008. These factors and an inflow of previously 
inactive persons into the labour market (on account of 
recently adopted regulatory measures) are expected to 

raise the unemployment rate above the EU average. 
HICP inflation fell in the first 
half of 2006 to 2.6%, 
whereas the forint depreciated by around 8% amidst 

investors’ globally increasi
ng risk sensitivity and 
growing financial market concerns about the state of 
Hungary’s public finances. Major one-shot inflation 

shocks from increased VAT and cuts in price 
subsidies (part of the fiscal
 consolidation 
package) along with the depreciation of the currency and 
increasing oil prices are estimated to bring average 
annual inflation close to 
4% in 2006. HICP inflation 
is expected to peak at close to 7% in 2007, also due to 
some further increases in regulated consumer prices 
(in energy and pu
blic transport). It should then drop 
below 4% in 2008, as the impact of fiscal measures 
ends and linked to the moderate impact of adverse 
cyclical conditions and expected lower energy prices. 
Public finances
1 After a 1.3 percentage point 
increase in 2005 to 7.8% 
of GDP, the general government deficit is expected to 
be considerably higher in 
2006, due to major 
slippages. The deficit is expected to reach 10.1% of 

GDP (compared to the original target of 6.2% of 
GDP), despite the corrective measures worth around 
1.5% of GDP taken in summer. Around half of the 

overshoot compared to th
e original target is due to 
current expenditure overruns, which have occurred 
chiefly in the areas of pe
nsion, healthcare, price subsidies and operational cost
s of central government. 
The remainder is mainly explained by deficit-

increasing one-off measures, as well as by the 
correction of the accounting of motorway investment 
(around 1% of GDP).

The forecast projects a sharp decline of the deficit to 
7.4% of GDP in 2007 and, based on the usual no-
policy-change assumption, a further improvement in 

2008 to 5.6% of GDP, due to the continuing fiscal 
retrenchment. This compares 
with the revised deficit 
targets of 6.8% of GDP in 2007 and 4.3% of GDP in 

2008 in the adjusted converge
nce programme update. 
The Commission services' forecast does not take into 
account the draft 2007 budget, since it will not be 
submitted to Parliament un
til 31 October, i.e. after the 
cut-off date of the forecast. However, it incorporates 
the increases in taxes and 
in social contributions 
adopted by Parliament in 
July 2006. This entails an 
increase in the tax burden of 1.2 percentage points 
between 2006 and 2008. On the expenditure side, only 
those expenditure reduction measures are considered 

(e.g. freezes in operational and wage expenditure and 
cuts in investment an
d price subsidies), which were 
adopted by the Government and are known in 

sufficient detail at time of
 the cut-off date. It is 
assumed that the planned savings in social transfers 
and government
 consumption will only partly be 
achieved, since it may be 
difficult to fully enforce the 
envisaged cuts in preventive care and in the public 
wage bill, particularly towards the end of the forecast 
horizon. Furthermore, interest expenditure for both 

2007 and 2008 is expected to be higher compared to 
official estimates, due to 
rising yields and higher 
government debt. The foreca
st does not include any 
debt assumption from the stat
e-guaranteed debt of the 
national railway (MÁV) company (over 1% of GDP), 
though it is subject to 
risk. The debt-to-GDP ratio is 
projected to significantly increase in 2006 to 67.6% 
from 61.7% in 2005. For 2007 and 2008, the debt 
ratio is projected to further increase to 70.9% of GDP 

and 72.7% of GDP respectively.

Malta - General government finances
Activity in 2006 
Economic activity continue
d growing at a sustained 
pace in the first half of 2006 on the back of higher 
domestic demand, in particular total consumption. 

GDP is projected to grow by
 around 2¼% in 2006 in 
real terms. Maintaining the 
momentum registered in 
the first half of the year, private consumption is 

projected to grow by around 2¼%, helped by 
employment creation and a continued expansion in 
consumer credit. Public consumption is projected to 

grow by 1%, while investment
 growth is expected to 
remain robust during 2006, 
reflecting the ongoing 
construction of the Mater Dei hospital and other 

infrastructure projects financed through the EU 
structural funds. Overall, domestic demand is 
expected to contribute around 4½ percentage points to 

GDP growth, partly explained by a positive 
contribution of stock-building. 
Despite a robust increase in nominal terms, real 
exports contracted dur
ing the first half of 2006. This 
was due to a base effect, as export prices rebounded 
from the depressed levels of the corresponding 2005 
period. This, coupled wit
h weak tourism results, 
should lead to real export growth of only ½% in 2006. 
A more dynamic domestic demand, coupled with 

exceptional operations (the purchase of sea vessels 
and transport infrastructure), sh
ould pull up imports 
by around 2¾%. As a result, the external sector is 

projected to contribute negatively by some 2 of a 
percentage points to GDP growth. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Real GDP growth is expected 
to decline slightly to 
around 2% in 2007 and 2008. Economic activity is 
expected to be driven by domestic demand in both 
years, while the contribution of the external sector 

should improve but remain negative. Private 
consumption is projected to grow at a faster pace of 
around 2½% in 2007, and accelerate slightly in 2008, 

on account of an improvement in disposable income.  
Public consumption is projected to ease in 2007 and 
accelerate to about 1% in 2008. Gross fixed capital 

formation is expected to slow down in 2007 as a result 
of the completion of th
e Mater Dei hospital and to 
decelerate further in 2008. Overall, domestic demand 

is expected to contribute by some 2¾ percentage 
points to GDP growth. 
The rebound of exports in 2006 is projected to 
accelerate in 2007 and in 2008, supported mainly by a 

better outlook for the semi
conductors sector and by an 
expansion of the pharmaceutical industry. Tourism 
activity is also expected to register some gains. By 

2008, imports should 
reach 2½%, while the detraction 
of net exports from GDP growth
 is projected to fall to 
around ¼ of a percentage point. The current account 
deficit is projected to reach almost 11% of GDP in 
2006 and 2007 as the trade imbalance continues to 

widen. Further deterioration is expected in 2008 as the 
improvement in the services balance is projected to 
fall short of the widening trade imbalance.  From 

2007, developments in th
e current account deficit also 
reflect the re-classification of
 part of EU funds under 
the new financial perspective (previously booked 

under current transfers) to the capital account. The 
current external deficit is expected to be only partially 
financed by capital inflows from the EU budget. The 

net borrowing vis-à-vis the rest of the world is 
projected to fluctuate around 8% of GDP over the 
forecast horizon. Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment growth in th
e first half of 2006 increased 
at a brisk pace. For the 
whole year, employment is 
expected to rise by some 1%. The pace of 
employment creation is projected to decelerate 
slightly in 2007, partly due to the completion of 
labour-intensive public construction projects. 
However, over the forecast horizon, the expansion of 
the pharmaceutical sector should provide some respite 
to sagging employment in manufacturing. 

Nevertheless, employment should be mainly 
generated by the services sector, in particular

Unemployment is anticipated
 to progressively decline 
to around 7% of the labour force by 2008.HICP 

inflation increased in the first 
half of 2006, mainly 
due to higher energy prices. For the whole year, 
headline inflation is projected at 3% as the impact of a 

relatively high increase in energy prices which started 
in late 2005, fades 
away towards year-end. HICP 
inflation is projected to
 keep easing somewhat to 
slightly above 2½% in 2007. 
For 2008, HICP inflation 
is projected to decline ma
rginally below 2½%, in line 
with more stable energy prices. 
Public finances 
The general government deficit is expected to fall to 
just below 3% in 2006 
mainly as a result of lower 
current expenditure. The structural balance 
(cyclically-adjusted bala
nce net of one-offs) is 
forecast to improve by ½% of GDP in 2006. 
Taking into account the 2007 draft Budget, the deficit 
for 2007 is projected at around 2¾% of GDP, 
including ¼% of GDP in deficit-reducing one-offs. 
This outcome is a result of projected higher revenues 

of around ¼ of a percentage point of GDP mainly due 
to taxes on production and imports on the back of 
higher private consumption. Current expenditure 

should fall by around 1 
percentage points of GDP 
which is expected to be completely offset by an 
increase in capital expenditure. For 2008, under the 

no-policy change scenario, which takes into account 
changes in interest payments but excludes one-off 
operations (consisting of sale of land), the deficit is 

expected to be slightly below 3% of GDP. General 
government debt in 2005 stood at around 74¼% of 
GDP and is expected to fall to around 69½% of GDP 

in 2006, mainly due to privatisation proceeds 
estimated at some 3½% of GDP. For 2007, the debt 
ratio is projected to decline to 69% of GDP. Under the 

no-policy change scenario, the debt ratio is expected 
to fall to around 68½% 
of GDP in 2008.

 %Activity in 2006 
The long awaited economic recovery that took hold 
mid-2005 was consolidated in the first half of 2006, 
with economic growth av
eraging 2.7% year-on-year. 
The Dutch economy is expected to continue to 
perform above potential in the second half of 2006, 
with economic growth slightly above the 3% mark. 

Dutch exports will con
tinue to benefit from a 
supportive external environment, but as imports will 
grow at a similar pace, the positive growth 

contribution from net 
exports will be unchanged. 
The acceleration of economic activity after a 
prolonged economic trough has been instrumental in 
restoring consumer confidence. Private consumption, 

which grew at only half a percentage point on average 
per year in the past four years, is expected to benefit 
from the improved outlook and pick up strongly
1. In part, this increase in private consumption represents a 
catching-up in durable good
s. Interestingly, the strong growth in consumption is not supported by strong 

wage developments in 2006 and hence the saving rate 
is expected to show a sizeable decline of around 1½ 
percentage points in 2006. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The Dutch economy is expected to continue its above-
potential growth performance in 2007 and 2008, with 
only a slight moderation in the latter year. Despite the 

moderation in world trade, economic growth will 
continue to be supported by export demand. 
In both years, economic growth is expected to benefit 
from continued strong domestic demand. Private 
consumption will retreat slightly 
as the catching-up in 
durable goods consumptio
n abates, but underlying 
consumption growth is continuing at around 2% in 

both years. Disposable house
hold income is expected 
to increase due to strong wage and employment 
developments, which provide a solid basis for the rise 

in private consumption while the household saving 
rate is expected to stabilise around 10½%. 
Private gross fixed capital form
ation will continue to show strong momentum throughout 2007. The 

prospects for investment in equipment are supported 
by regained producer confide
nce as well as by strong 
profit developments in recent years. Investment in 

housing construction will remain favourable as the 
demand for new homes continues to be strong. Some 
moderation is expected to occur towards 2008 as the 

economic cycle matures.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Following three years of decline, employment is 
expected to expand strongly in 2006 on the back of 
the vigorous economic recov
ery. Employment growth 
(in full-time equivalent) will reach around 1½% in 
both 2006 and 2007. As it outpaces labour supply 

growth in all forecast years, unemployment is 
expected to show a continuous fall, to around 3% as 
early as 2007. The rapid tightening of the labour 

market is expected to hold back employment growth 
in the last forecast year, slowing it down to around 
¾%. Furthermore, from 2
007 onwards, labour scarcity 
is expected to elicit a strong endogenous wage 
reaction, despite contractual wages currently being 
fixed at relatively low leve
ls. A similar wage response 
emerged at the height of 
the previous economic peak 
(Graph 3.21) when unemployment reached similar 
levels to those currently 
anticipated for the outer 
forecast years. 
Inflationary pressures will start to emerge as a result 
of rising labour costs. HICP inflation is expected to 
increase from 1.6% in 2006 to 1.8% in 2007 and 2.3% 

in 2008. Although
 rising product prices will hold back 
real unit labour costs, nomina
l unit labour costs will 
increase around 1½% per year from 2007 onwards 
and this will partially reverse the improvement in the 
competitive position that has taken place over the 

course of the past few years.

 Public finances 
After a remarkably strong improvement in recent 
years, the Dutch public finances are expected to 
further improve slightly in 2006, to reach a balance. 

In structural terms, there is no
 further strengthening. 
An important explanation for the better nominal 
outcome in 2006 is higher revenues from indirect 

taxes, in particular VAT, in part because of the above-
mentioned catching-up of durable private 
consumption. Furthermore, higher energy prices are 

expected to raise government revenue by around ½% 
of GDP due to higher gas-related revenues. 
In 2007, the government balance is expected to turn 
into a small surplus of 
0.2% of GDP, and total 
spending is projected to respect and even fall slightly 
short of allotted expenditure ceili
ngs. The government 
balance is also expected to benefit from a projected 

further increase in gas-related revenues. Because of 
the end of the current government term in 2007, no 
expenditure ceilings exist beyond that year. Based on 
the no-policy-change assumption, it is expected that 
strong revenue growth will result in a small increase 

in the general government surplus in 2008.  
Thanks to the budgetary position and sales of 
financial participations, the debt-to-GDP ratio is 
projected to further decline from over 50% of GDP in 

2006 to around 45½% of GDP in 2008. 
 
                                                          
 1 The reform of the health care system at the beginning of 
2006 resulted in a shift of health care expenditures of 
around €8 billion (or 1½% of GDP) from private to public 
consumption, downwardly distorting private consumption 
growth by around 3 percentage points in 2006.

Activity in 2006
 The beginning of the year saw a slowdown in 
economic growth from 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in late 
2005 to 0.6%. However, real GDP growth accelerated 

again to 0.9% in the following period. Overall, 
activity in the first six months turned out much 
stronger than previously expected. 
The growth in the first ha
lf of the year was to a large 
extent driven by gross fixed investment, which finally 
picked up after a prolonged period of weakness. The 
rebound was particularly spectacular for equipment 

investment, supported by 
favourable prospects for 
exports of goods and risi
ng capacity utilisation.  Net exports also developed favourably
1, contributing to growth thanks to the surprisingly strong demand in 

the euro area in particul
ar in the second quarter. 
Exports of goods should remain strong in the second 
half of the year, partly because of the carry-forward 

effects in private consumption in Germany due to the 
increase in the standard German VAT rate as from 
2007.  In spite of the 2004/2005 tax cuts, the lower-than-
initially-expected inflation 
and the relatively strong 
job creation, private consumption remained subdued 

in the first half of the 
year, but it is expected to 
accelerate slightly in the second half.  
All in all, on an annual basis, real GDP growth is 
projected to increase to 3.1% in 2006, with investment 

and net exports mainly responsible for this favourable 
outcome.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Having picked up significantly in 2006, GDP growth 
is expected to slow down in 2007 and 2008, but 
should remain close to its 
potential even at the end of 
the forecast period. The negative output gap is 
supposed to close towards the forecast horizon.  
The profiles of both private and government 
consumption are expected to be relatively flat. Gross 

fixed capital formation, after its spectacular rebound 
in 2006, is expected to ease down over the forecast 
period.  
Exports of goods are anticipated to decelerate in 2007 
- to a large extent due to the above-mentioned rise in 
the German VAT rate - and con
tinue to do so in 2008, 
in line with the foreseen slowd
own in world trade. As 
a result GDP growth towards the end of the forecast 
period will increasingly rely on domestic demand.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment will grow throughout the forecast 
period, albeit more slowly than in the euro area on 

average. Unemployment is expected to edge down 
marginally in 2006 from its previous year's level, but 
then will remain stable as job creation is matched by a 
labour force growing rapidly due to more women and 
immigrants entering the job 
market and older workers 
staying in it longer as a consequence of the recent 
pension reform.  
With oil prices easing down, consumer price inflation 
is projected to stay below 2% over the forecast period. 

No inflationary pressures are expected to stem from 
labour costs as wage develo
pments should 
stay in line 
with gains in productivity.  
Public finances 
2006 was supposed to see the peak of the revenue 
loss, estimated at 1.4% of GDP, caused by the 
2004/2005 tax reform. In addition, the 2006 budget is 
burdened with the cost of the regional employment 

and growth initiative of August 2005 and a package of 
measures aimed at combating youth unemployment 
and helping women re-enter the job market, which the 

government adopted in September 2005 (about 0.16% 
of GDP in total). As a counterbalance, the 
implementation of the second stage of the 
administrative reform, agreed on by the different 
levels of government in November 2005, should result

 in expenditure savings of around 0.1% of GDP. 
Looking at the available central government's revenue 
data for 2006, it seems probable that the annual 

general government deficit will turn out lower than 
the officially forecast 1.5% of GDP. This is mainly 
due to higher-than-expected proceeds from VAT and 

corporate tax.  
It should be noted that at the time of writing, the 
composition of the new government was not yet 
known, let alone its budgetary plans for the next year. 

Under a no-policy-change assumption, the deficit is 
expected to decline marginally in 2007 and 2008 as 
the impact of the tax reform wears off, but it will still 

be higher than the targets of 0.8% and 0% of GDP 
respectively presented in th
e update of the Stability 
Programme submitted in 
November 2005.  
The debt ratio is anticip
ated to decrease continuously 
over the forecast period. In 20
08, it is expected to fall 
just below the 60% of GDP threshold for the first time 
since 1992.

caution as they are heavily distorted by a break in the series of 
services exports and imports caused by a change in the 
methodology of gathering the data. A revision is expected on the

Activity in 2006 
Economic activity in the first 
half of 2006 confirmed 
the recovery observed since mid-2005. Driven by 
domestic demand, real GDP growth in the second 

quarter of 2006 reached 5.5% year-on-year, up from 
5.2% in the first quarter. 
Quarterly data indicate, 
however, some loss in momentum, except for gross 

fixed capital formation. Notably, private consumption 
growth weakened slightly towards the end of the 
second quarter which may be attributed to feeble 

consumer confiden
ce resulting from political 
disturbances connected with
 the dismissal of the 
Marcinkiewicz government. Investment growth in the 

second quarter of 2006 jumped to 14.4% year-on-
year, mainly thanks to 
small firms which increased 
their investment outlays
. Such a high investment 
growth was last observed in 1998. Strong investment 
activity was backed up by healthy corporate profits 
and reflected in an increased construction activity.  
Export and import growth in the first half of 2006 
increased to about 17% and 15% in real terms, year-
on-year, respectively. Net exports contributed 
positively to GDP growth but 
this contribution was 
diminishing. A less volatile exchange rate and solid 
external demand maintained the growth of Polish 

exports despite a food exports ban to Russia and 
Ukraine. The growth of imports can be attributed to 
continuing investment activ
ity and overall strong 
private consumption.  
Since the new investments take time to come on 
stream, temporary capacity constraints may limit the 
production dynamics in th
e second half of the year 
and prevent some firms from meeting the increased 
demand. Also the short-term indicators point at 
stabilisation of GDP growth for the remaining part of 

the year.  For the whole 2006 GDP is projected to 
grow at 5¼ % on average.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Domestic demand will continue to 
be the main driving 
force of GDP growth in 2007 and 2008. Both 

investment and private consumption growth are likely 
to stay strong over the 
projection period. Investments 
will be supported by increased inflow of EU funds. 

Poland will be still able to 
use for two years the funds 
after the end of the first programming period 2004–
2006. At the same time funds from the new 

programming period of 2007–2013 will already be 
available. Despite the 
current political instabilities, 
capacity constraints will lead to 
investment growth of 
over 10% each year, further supported by foreign 
direct investment and by am
ple supply of EU funds. 
Private consumption is expected to keep its high 

momentum as a result of the better situation in the 
labour market and accelerating real wage growth. 
Administrative difficulties 
encountered in dealing 
with EU funds have limited Poland’s absorption 
capacity, but the situation has started to improve 
which bodes well for the coming years. Therefore, in 
2007 and 2008, EU funds (up to 3¼% of GDP) will 
boost domestic demand and increase imports, which 

will translate into a negative contribution of net 
exports to GDP growth.  
Export growth is expected to
 slow down slightly due 
to lower external demand in
 the EU, the main trading 
909190Chapter 3 Member States, Poland - 91 - 
partner. This might lead to
 some shift in the direction 
of trade from EU count
ries to the countries on 
Poland's eastern border (Russia and Ukraine). Rising 

investment-driven imports will augment the external 
imbalances widening the trade and current account 
deficit in 2007 and 2008. However, higher transfers 

from the EU will have a positiv
e impact on both the 
current and capital accounts. In total, the external 
deficit is projected to widen 
to 2¾% of GDP in 2008.
 Labour market, costs and prices 
In the course of 2006 on
e could observe an impressive 
improvement in the lab
our market. Until September 
the unemployment rate has fallen by nearly 2½ 
percentage point from 17.7% in 2005, which 

corresponds to a decrease in the number of 
unemployed by nearly 400 thousand people. Although 
total employment increased 
significantly (2½% in the 
first half of 2006), part of 
the drop in unemployment 
rate may be attributed to a falling labour force due to 
increased early retirements, emigration and a growing 

number of students. As economic activity is expected 
to be strong, employment 
should increase by about 
5% by the end of the forecast horizon. The number of 
unemployed is projected to reach ca. 2 million people, 
somewhat more than 12% 
of the civilian labour force 
in 2008. Annual HICP inflation decreased to a record low of 
0.8% at the end of 2005 and rebounded slightly since 
then to about 1.5% in mid-2006. Inflationary 

expectations are muted so 
far. Nevertheless inflation 
is expected to rise at a slow pace because of higher 
expected food prices due to a poor harvest, emerging 

bottlenecks on the labour 
market and rising wage 
pressures as the expected improvement in the labour 
market will bring unemploymen
t rates close to the 
estimate of Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of 
Unemployment (NAIRU). Furthermore, companies 
are in a very good financial situation and can afford to 

pay higher wages. Inflation in 2007 is projected to 
come close to the Polish central bank’s medium-term 
target of 2.5% and reach 2¾% in 2008.  
Unit labour costs are projected to grow by ca. 2¼% in 
2006, owing to strong wage growth combined with 
modest productivity increases. 
In 2007 and 2008,  
nominal unit labour costs are lik
ely to continue rising, 
albeit at a slower pace, up to 1% as productivity 
growth will recover and offset the accelerating 
compensation of employees due to tightening labour 
markets. 
Public finances 
Since the 2006 spring forecast, the acceleration of 
GDP growth has resulted in
 better than expected 
revenues from direct taxes. Moreover, there was 
slower-than-budgeted investment
 expenditure by local 
government related to lower-than-projected 

absorption of EU funds. The general government 
balance is now expected to improve from 
2.5% of 
GDP in 2005 to 
2.2% of GDP in 2006. However, 
there still remains some un
certainty as regards the 
general government balance due to the November 
2006 municipal elections, which may boost local 

government expenditure 
in the last quarter of 2006. 
Assuming that the parliament does not significantly 
modify the draft budget, 
the general government 
balance is expected to im
prove marginally to 
2.0% 
of GDP in 2007 thanks to some revenue-increasing 
measures, mainly hikes of excise duty on fuel and 
cigarettes. The unfreezing of the indexation of 
personal income tax bracket
s and pro-family tax relief 
will be the main revenue-reducing measure. 

Compared to the target presented in the draft 2007 
budget, the general government balance is expected to 
be worse by 0.3% of GDP mainly because of less 

optimistic revenue forecast for direct taxes as well as 
expected higher expenditure on
 public investment and 
social transfers. 
In 2008, the gener
al government balance is expected 
to improve slightly to 
1.8% of GDP under the 
assumption of no policy change. On the positive side, 
the government intends to keep its 30 bn z
oty 
nominal deficit anchor (ceiling) for the state budget 
deficit. On the negative side (from the government 
balance perspective), rising absorption of EU funds 

will also require increased 
spending by local 
government and the balance of local authorities may 
deteriorate weighing on the government deficit as a 

whole, whereas no plausi
ble expenditure reforms are 
planned by the government 
so far. GDP growth is 
expected to be less tax-rich. 
The gross debt figure is projected to increase from 
42% of GDP in 2005 to
 slightly more than 43% in 
2007 as a result of still-high deficits and slow 

privatisation. In 2008, th
e debt ratio may decline 
below 43%.

 Portugal - GDP and domestic demand growth
Activity in 2006 
Economic activity in Portugal has gradually improved 
since late 2005. In 2006, 
GDP is expected to expand 
by 1¼% in real terms, after gro
wing by 0.4% in 2005. 
The ongoing recovery has been associated with a 
change in growth compositio
n with the external sector 
becoming the driver of growth, in contrast with the 

pattern of previous years. Exports have been 
expanding at a fast pace since mid-2005, especially to 
a number of extra-EU markets, helped by the lively 

momentum of world trade. At the same time, imports 
have been contained, such that the external sector will 
provide a substantial contribution to GDP growth. 
Domestic demand has not been adding to GDP 
growth. Investment continues to recede, with a further 
contraction in construction playing a role, which 
seems to be the continuation of the downward trend 

observed since the beginning of the decade. At the 
same time, both household and government 
consumption have cooled not
ably since last year, with 
qualitative indicators suggesti
ng a mild improvement 
in the former in more recent months. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Throughout 2007 and 2008, Portugal's GDP is 
expected to continue on a moderate upward path, with 
chances that growth rates will edge up to around 1½% 
next year and some 1¾% in 2008.  
Domestic demand is expected to gradually recover 
from its weak 2006 performance. Investment is 
projected to stop dragging down GDP growth already 

in 2007, but its expansion may be limited by some 
consolidation in firms' ba
lance sheets to address their 
high debt levels and further adjustment in the 
construction sector. The projected increases in 

household consumption as
sume tighter financial 
conditions against high levels of indebtedness and 
limited growth of labour income and social transfers.  
The external sector is expected to make a positive 
contribution to GDP growth in the next two years, 
though lower than in 2006. While exports of goods 

and services will grow less rap
idly, they will benefit 
from a still favourable external demand outlook. 
Exports should be helped by their further orientation 

towards fast-growing markets, nevertheless, 
international competition 
and a still relatively high 
share of low-growth sectors in the product mix may 

dampen their expansion. Import growth is forecast to 
be modest due to the sluggish domestic demand.  
Trade developments should lead to a narrowing 
current account deficit thro
ughout the forecast period. 
The improvement will be partly offset by higher 
primary income deficits coming from the nation's 
rising external debt and by
 lower transfers from the 
EU budget. As a result, the external deficit will 

decline to 7% of GDP in 2008.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The unemployment rate has climbed quickly in recent 
years and is now expected to stabilize over the 
forecast period. Hence, wage growth is thus projected 

to remain subdued. 
In 2006, inflation will rebound
 to almost 3% from its 
low 2005 level as a result of high energy prices and, 

to a lesser extent, the effects of indirect tax hikes in 
2005. In 2007 and 2008, inflation is expected to fall to 
just over 2%, with price stability being helped by the 

subdued cyclical conditions, as revealed by a large 
negative output gap, and moderation in import prices. 
Public finances 
In 2006, the general government deficit is expected to 
fall to some 4½% of GDP, down from 6% of GDP in 
2005. Tax revenues have been growing strongly, as a 

result of various rate in
creases, especially in the VAT 
standard rate from 19 to 21%
 in mid-2005, and curbs 
on tax benefits. Moreover, part of the increase in 
revenue can be ascribed to enhanced efficiency of tax 
and social contribution admi
nistration. Dividends 
from state-owned enterprises have also recovered 
from last year's shortfall. On the spending side, most

 categories, except social transfers other than in kind 
and interest expenditure, are forecast to decline as a 
share of GDP. 
For 2007, the government deficit is projected to 
decline towards 4% of GDP. On the revenue side, 
additional proceeds will come from higher social 
contributions by government employees but, overall, 
tax revenue is forecast to grow moderately as it will 
no longer benefit from large increases in rates and the 

domestic demand upturn will be subdued. 
Furthermore, the additional gains of improved tax 
collection may be lower than the substantial ones of 

the past years. This forecast takes account of 
corrective measures implemented recently with a view 
to reining in spending, 
as well as of the 2007 budget, 
which, 
i.a.
, targets a halt in the growth of social 
transfers in kind. Opposing forces will be at play. On 
the one hand, the fact that workers leaving the central 

government will only partially be replaced will help 
contain personnel expen
diture. This will be further compounded by wage restraint and cuts in temporary 
government jobs. Health expenditure may stabilise as 
a result of the restructuring of the health services 

network, lower expenditure
 for medication and a 
tightening of benefit for parts of the civil service. On 
the other hand, spending pressure will remain high 

due to public-private partne
rships agreed in the past 
for the construction of motorways and to interest 
expenditure. At the same time, even if the tightening 

of retirement rules, especially from the civil service, is 
alleviating pressure on spending, pension expenditure 
will still grow strongly 
in the coming years
1. On the 
basis of the no-policy chang
e assumption, the 2008 
deficit is expected to decline only slightly.  The government debt ratio is projected to continue 
increasing, approaching almost 71% at the end of the 
forecast period.

Slovenia - Price and wage developments
Activity in 2006 
In the first half of 2006, the economy grew at 5.0% in 
real terms year-on-year – the highest rate since 1999, 
despite the rise in oil prices. 
According to the leading 
indicators, the momentum seems to have stabilised in 
the third quarter but 
is likely to start waning towards 
the end of the year. Overall real GDP growth for 2006 

is projected at 4.8%.  
This year the main impetus came from an impressive 
build-up of fixed capital while de-stocking continued. 
In particular, investment in 
equipment, related to 
production restructuring aimed at improving 
competitiveness, boomed. 
Private expenditure also 
remained buoyant. A furthe
r boost to GDP growth 
came from external demand; the contribution of net 
exports is anticipated to 
stay positive for the second 
year in a row against the background of a robust 

recovery in Slovenia's main trading partners.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
In 2007, however, export expansion is expected to 
slow down following a tempering of the revival in the 
foreign markets. Imports are also projected to 
decelerate in step with more modest domestic 
demand. On the one hand, households may moderate 

their consumption while adjusti
ng to the new currency 
– the euro. This prudence is assumed to limit the 
impact of the personal income tax reform, which 

curbs taxation progression by reducing the number of 
tax brackets from five to three and capping the top tax 
rate at 41% (previously 50%). On the other hand, 

enterprises are likely to recons
ider their investment 
expenditure in the light 
of the new corporate income 
tax regime, which lowers the tax rate from 25% to 
23% but, at the same time, excludes all non-R&D-
related investment from 
tax exemptions. Nevertheless, 
fixed capital formation is 
anticipated to stay solid on 
account of vigorous construction activity. Housing 
construction, in particular, is forecast to rally prior to 

2008, when the transition period of levying a reduced 
VAT rate on new houses ends. Furthermore, a major 
investment in highway co
nstruction is planned. 
Within a relatively benign
 international environment 
real GDP growth is projected to decelerate to 4.2% in 
2007.  The projections foresee a slight improvement of 
economic activity in 2008 with output increasing by 
4.5%. Supposing that th
e VAT rates are not raised in 
that general election year – though the idea is 

currently under consideration in the government’s 
mid-term budgetary planning
 – private consumption is 
forecast to rise steadily. Investment, on the other 

hand, is expected to slow further. While imports are 
projected to increase more moderately, a good export 
performance is likely to persist against the backdrop 
of stable conditions in the world markets. The current 
account deficit is thus projected to decline to around 

1.5% of GDP, after lingeri
ng at 2% since 2004.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
During 2006, a smooth di
sinflationary trend was 
interrupted by an oil price 
hike. Already dropping to 
2.3% in March, the 12-month moving average 

inflation rate climbed back to 2.7% by August. The 
possibility of counteracting the adverse effects of high 
oil prices by adjusting th
e excise taxes on energy 
products had not been available since July 2005, when 
the lowest level of taxes 
allowed by EU legislation 
was reached. In response to the recent easing of oil 

prices, the government has st
arted increasing excise 
duties again (twice since August).  Still, average 
annual inflation notched down to 2.6% in September 

and is forecast to come to 2.5% by the end of the year, 
unchanged compared with 2005.  
Consumer price growth 
is projected to stabilise 
around this level throughout the forecast period, given 
that the government remains bound by the mid-term 
plan of regulating admini
stered price rises and the 
accession agreement, requiring harmonisation of 
excise duties on tobacco with EU law. The forecast, 
however, is vulnerable to oil price shocks and the 

liberalisation of the electricity and natural gas market

 for households due by 1 July 2007. Moreover, there 
are uncertainties related to th
e potential increase in 
VAT rates, which could add some 0.8 percentage 

points to the rate of inflation in the year when the new 
regime comes into effect.  
Limited risk stems from wage pressures, which are 
expected to stay well contained based on the June 

2006 pay agreement in the private sector for the 2006-
2007 period, stipulating a moderate 2% adjustment of 
nominal wages. Bargaining at sector level, however, 

will give social partners th
e possibility to negotiate 
additional pay rises based on pr
oductivity growth. The 
positive labour market developments are forecast to 

endure until 2008, with a furth
er rise in employment 
and the unemployment rate falling to 6%. 
Public finances 
In 2005, the general government deficit declined to 
1.4% of GDP, well below the anticipated deficit of 

2.1%. Despite the broadly favourable economic trends 
throughout 2006, the deficit ratio is projected to 
deteriorate slightly this year as revenue windfalls 
based on vigorous activity do not compensate for the 

loss due to the lowering of the payroll tax rate by 20% 
– a first step towards its gradual elimination by 2009. 
Furthermore, the decision to index pensions to wages 

has partly offset the cost-saving measures related to 
rationalisation of government procurement as well as 
restrictive employment and 
wage policies in the 
public sector. Assuming th
at the general government 
expenditure remains constrained and that the new 
direct income tax regimes 
enter into force in January 
2007 while the 
phasing-out of 
the payroll tax 
continues, as reflected in the new 2007-2008 budget 
proposal, the deficit is set to linger at 1.5% of GDP. 

An increase in VAT rates is being considered as a 
possible measure to cover for the loss in revenue in 
2008. Over the forecast horizon, the general 

government debt is expected to
 stay at just below 30% 
of GDP.

Slovakia - GDP growth, unemployment rate

Activity in 2006 
Real GDP growth increased to 6% in 2005. It was 
driven by domestic demand while the external 
contribution remained negative. Data for the first two 

quarters suggest that economic growth in 2006 
continues to accelerate to around 6¾%. It is still 
mainly driven by domestic demand, particularly by 

investment and private consumption, but the external 
growth contribution should also enter positive 
territory. Private consumption growth is expected to remain 
very strong at around 5¾% in 2006 benefiting from 
real wage and employment growt
h. Realisation of 
some big investment projects in the corporate sector is 

estimated to keep gross 
fixed capital formation 
growth above 9%. The anticipated positive 
contribution of net exports is mainly a result of 

decelerating real import growth. 
While a lower trade deficit is offset by a deteriorating 
income balance, impr
oving net capital transfers should lead to a decrease in the net borrowing from 
the rest of the world to below 8% of GDP in 2006. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Economic expansion is expected to further accelerate 
to above 7% in 2007 and then to decelerate to around 

5¾ in 2008.  Domestic de
mand is likely to remain the 
main driving force, while the positive external 
contribution should peak in 2007, when new export 

capacities in the automotive 
sector come on stream.  
A rapidly improving labour market situation 
combined with strong cred
it growth is expected to 
continue to support private consumption growth, 
which, despite slowing down
, should remain at above 
4% over the forecast period. Gross fixed capital 
formation should start to d
ecelerate markedly in 2007 
as major investment proj
ects in the automotive 
industry will be finalised in 
2006. The investment 
boom should further ease in 2008, assuming that there 
are no new major foreign
 direct investments. 
Decelerating investment and consumption should 
contribute to a slowdown in import growth.  
Increasing net exports shou
ld lead to a significant 
improvement in the external balances in 2007 and 

2008.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
Total employment is expected to increase by some 
2½% in 2006 while the unemployment rate is likely to 
decrease to close to 14%. Similar, though slower, 

trends are anticipated in 2007 and 2008 as strong 
domestic demand and newly built export production 
capacities are expected to continue to provide 
additional employment 
opportunities. Despite strong 
productivity growth, nomina
l unit labour costs are 
likely to continue to grow over the whole forecast 
period, as wage growth remains substantial.    
Due to adjustments in administered prices at the end 
of 2005, average annual HIC
P inflation is estimated to 
increase to around 4½% in 2006. As lower increases 
in regulated prices in the energy sector are expected at 
the end of this year, HICP 
inflation is anticipated to 
drop to below 3½% in 
2007. Assuming that no 
significant adjustments in
 administered prices will be 
required for 
2008, annual average HICP inflation is 
forecast to decrease further, to around 2½%, in 2008. 
Public finances 
A pension reform was launched in 2005, affecting 
social contributions by redi
recting 9% of gross wages 
to a funded (second) pension
 pillar. Due to gradual 
transition and a widespread public interest in this 
pillar, these revenue transfers are estimated to 
increase from some ½% 
of GDP in 2005 to about 
1¼% of GDP in 2006, 2007 and 2008. 
The general government defic
it (including the pension 
reform costs) was slightly above
 3% of GDP in 2005, 
around one percentage point lower than foreseen in 
the 2005 budget. This better-than-anticipated outcome

was partly due to the January 2006 increases in excise 
taxes on cigarettes and alcohol which induced a large 
accumulation of stocks of these products by 

consumers and enterprises at the end of 2005 and thus 
resulted in better-than-expect
ed tax revenues for the 
year (¼% of GDP).  
This effect, which was not 
foreseen in the 2006 
budget, had a correspondingly negative impact on tax 
revenues in 2006. Higher-than-expected GDP and 
employment growth combined with lower interest 

expenditure should, nevertheless, ensure that the 2006 
general government deficit (including the pension 
reform costs) ends up at around 3½% of GDP, some 

¾ percentage points below the level foreseen in the 
2006 budget, in spite 
of increases in some public 
expenditure. The latter is miti
gated by the fact that a 
lower-than-expected absorption of EU funds is likely 
to ease demands on public expenditure through co-
financing.  
Thanks to strong economic activity and restrained 
public expenditure growth
, the general government 
deficit (including the pension reform costs) is 

anticipated to decrease to around 3% of GDP in 2007 
if the government thoroughly implements the 2007 
budget. In order to respect the 3% deficit limit the 

government decided to introduce some widespread 
spending cuts while keeping increases in expenditure 
available to education and social affairs ministries 

below nominal GDP growth. On the other hand, 
increased health spending represents a downside risk 
for the budget. 
Under the customary no policy change assumption the 
budget deficit (including th
e pension reform costs) is 
projected to remain 
around 3% in 2008. 
Gross public debt is expected 
to continue falling over 
the forecast period thanks mainly to strong GDP 

growth.

Activity in 2006  
Economic growth in the first two quarters of 2006 
accelerated sharply to about 6% year-on-year. Part of 
the increase is explained by the base effect from the 

production stoppage in the paper industry in the 
second quarter of 2005, wh
ich will also have lagged 
effects in the third quarter. The base effect on GDP 

growth for the full year is 
estimated at about 1 
percentage point. 
During the first half of 2006, growth was well 
balanced, mainly driven by net exports and 

persistently strong private consumption. Household 
confidence has remained strong, boosted by rapid 
employment growth and fa
vourable real disposable 
income developments, supported by substantial 
income tax cuts.  Export 
growth was particularly rapid 
as both the metal engineering and electronics 

manufacturing sectors benefited from lively foreign 
demand, while wood and paper exports were boosted 
by the base effect. Private consumption and export 

growth are expected to moder
ate in the second half of 
the year, still warranting an over 1 percentage point 
upward revision in GDP growth for the year as a 
whole.  Following a slump in 2005, investment in machinery 
and equipment is expected to pick up in 2006 and 

2007, boosted by strong prospects and confidence in 
industry and the delivery 
of nuclear plant equipment. 
Housing investment will remain strong in 2006, 

though leading indicators point to a deceleration in the 
following years. Prospects for 2007 and 2008  
Economic growth is forecast to gradually cool down 
in the next years to rates close
 to the estimated growth 
potential of about 3%. The slowdown in growth is 

influenced by an expected ec
onomic downturn in the 
export markets, as well as more modest increases in 
private consumption. The growth of real disposable 

income is set to abate, as wage and employment 
growth will slow and inco
me tax cuts will be smaller. 
Household borrowing is expect
ed to slow in line with 
interest rate rises and a slow
down in housing demand. 
Investment in equipme
nt and machinery will 
decelerate in 2008 from high growth rates as the 

special factors affecting 2006
 and 2007 will fade. 
In 2007 and 2008, the main stimulus to growth is 
expected to come from private consumption. The 
contribution from net exports will not be as 

phenomenal as in 2006, 
but will remain positive 
nevertheless. However, the continuous weakening in 
the terms of trade will lead to
 a slight decline in the 
substantial external surplus. Public consumption 
growth is forecast to abate, given the efforts of the 
central government to
 control expenditure. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Similarly to 2005, employment is set to grow by 
about 1½% in 2006
, which will lead also
 to notable 
reductions in unemployment and a rise in labour 

supply. Strong demand for labour has caused 
shortages and a rise in job vacancies in some 
industrial, construction 
and service sectors, which 
have not been substantially alleviated by the migrant 
workers or increased domestic participation rates. The 
structural nature of unemployment limits the 

reduction of unemployment 
that could be achieved in 
the present favourable environment. However, the 
labour market bottlenecks have not led to a noticeable 

wage drift. On the aggregate level, wages are strongly 
guided by the current central wage agreement, valid 
until the end of September 2007. Wage negotiations 

covering the period after
 2007 have not yet started. 
The present forecast assumes a slight frontloading of 
wage claims to 2008, which explains an increase in 
nominal unit labour costs. 
In 2007 and 2008, employment growth is expected to 
slow considerably as the rat
e of economic expansion 
abates and unemployment levels decline closer to 
their structural limits. Employment in industry is

forecast to be on a declining trend, as labour-intensive 
production is facing pressures 
to relocate to low-cost 
countries. The unemployment rate is projected to 

stabilise at slightly over 7% 
in 2007 and 2008.  
Finland recorded the lo
west HICP inflation rate in the 
euro area in 2005, when prices rose by just 0.8%. 
HICP inflation is expected to increase only slightly 

from the 1.4% forecast for 2006 and remain close to 
1½% throughout the forecast period. Finnish price 
levels are about one fifth higher than in the euro area 

on average, which leaves further room for 
competition-induced price moderation. The subdued 
import prices of consumption goods will contribute to 

lower inflation. Public finances  
The general government surplus is forecast to remain 
fairly stable between 2½% and 3% over the forecast 
period. This is only slightly more optimistic than in 

the spring 2006 forecast, since the growth surprise for 
2006 has a low tax content, being largely export-
driven. The present forecast assumes no policy change 
and therefore no tax measures for 2008. Central 

government spending is expe
cted to remain contained 
by the mid-term budgetary rules and remain broadly 
balanced. Local governmen
t finances are expected to 
stay marginally in deficit in
 spite of measures to 
balance the position. The gene
ral government surplus 
continues to be generated
 by social security. 
The government debt ratio is projected to steadily 
decline to about 36% of GDP by the end of the 
forecast period.  10010024. Sweden Economic activity to remain strong

Activity in 2006 
Economic activity in the first half of 2006 came out 
very strong with growth supported by domestic 
demand, implying accelerating private consumption 

and a continued positiv
e investment cycle. In 
addition, export performance remained positive. 
Recent forward-looking indicators are generally 
positive. Consumer confidence is supported by 

favourable household sentiment on the economy as a 
whole and on their own ec
onomic situation; this 
partially reflects the improving labour market. 

Industrial confidence is high in
 general, as it is for 
services, retail trade and, in pa
rticular, construction, where signs of capacity constraints are nevertheless 

beginning to show. These indicators should support 
continued buoyant performance in 2006, when GDP 
growth for the whole year is expected to be above 4%. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
In the coming two years, economic growth is 
expected to decelerate somewhat towards 3% per 
year, close to estimated pot
ential growth rates. Private 
consumption is expected to consolidate its position as 
the main growth driver, as investment growth 
subsides somewhat after the larg
e expansion in recent 
years. Net exports are expected to continue to 
contribute positively to growth. 
The continued steady growth in private consumption 
is enabled by the resumption of employment growth 

which contributes positively to household disposable 
income. In addition, the 
proposed reduction 
in labour 
income taxes as from 2007
 will also contribute. While 
households have taken on more debt, financial wealth 
has benefited from rising equity and property prices, 
contributing to the ma
intenance of a relatively strong 
net wealth position. A gradual reduction of the saving 
rate is expected over the forecast period. 
Growth of public consumption is expected to 
strengthen, reflecting the room for manoeuvre 

provided by the stronger public finance situation, in 
particular at local level. As reg
ards investment, the 
conditions for a continued expansion, albeit at a 

decelerating pace, remain in place: a benign demand 
outlook, favourable financing conditions and high 
capacity utilisation in ma
nufacturing. Exports are 
expected to continue to grow relatively strongly both 
in 2007 and 2008, in 
line with world markets. Imports 
are also expected to continue to
 grow at high rates as 
domestic demand strengthens.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The continued strong pace of economic activity 
foreseen over the forecast period is expected to be 
accompanied by a moderation in the cyclically high 
labour productivity growth seen over the last few 
years. Private sector employment growth, after having 

been weak in the recent past, is expected to build on 
the improved situation in 2006 and remain dynamic. 
The new government intends to reduce sharply the 

number of people engaged in active labour market 
programmes; given the classification of some current 
programmes to education this will contribute to 

increase the measured labour force. At the same time, 
incentives to work should strengthen given planned 
changes in the tax and benefit systems (see public 

finance section), also contributing to an increase in 
labour supply. Overall, measured unemployment will 
increase somewhat in 2007 before being reduced in 

2008, reaching 7% of the labour force.  
The weak developments in the labour market over the 
last few years have helped to
 contain wage demands. 
Despite the improving labou
r market situation, wage 
demands are expected to remain contained, though 
this will need to be confirmed by the outcome of the 
encompassing private sector wage negotiation round 
in 2007. Given the somewhat stronger inflation 
outlook, the Riksbank has started to raise interest rates towards more neutral levels, with a cumulative 
increase by 100 basis points so far in 2006. Overall, 
inflationary pressures remain relatively subdued with 

underlying inflation rising towards 2% during the

this period, and with a st
ronger labour market, interest 
rates may rise further. 
Public finances 
In 2005, the budg
et surplus was a fu
ll 3.0% of GDP. 
The 2006 Budget contai
ned some expansionary 
elements (including tax cuts and increases in active 
labour market programmes), but higher than foreseen 

tax revenues and lower expenditures for 
unemployment and illness 
at work limit the net impact 
on the budget balance. As a 
result, the 2006 surplus is expected to be 2.8% of GDP. 
This positive underlying trend spills over to the 2007-
2008 period, allowing surpluses to remain high 
despite the fairly expansionary 2007 budget proposed 

by the new government. The 2007 budget includes in 
particular substantial tax cu
ts, including a large cut in 
labour income taxes (estimated to be worth about 

1.3% of GDP), a halving of wealth taxes and a 
freezing of property taxes. This is partially financed 
by higher contributions for unemployment insurance 
(worth about 0.3% of GDP), cuts in active labour 

market programmes, increases in taxes on tobacco and 
abolition of tax deductions for union fees and 
unemployment insurance fees. Overall the budget 

surplus is expected to 
be reduced to around 2½% of 
GDP in 2007 and 2008 on current policies. Over the 
whole 2006-2008 period both the expenditure and 

revenue ratios to 
GDP continue to decline. 
General government gross debt, mainly central 
government liabilities, is pr
ojected to continue to fall, 
to well below 40% of GDP in
 2008. This also takes 
into account the ambitious
 privatisation plans in the 
budget, at a rate of rough
ly 2% of GDP per year.  
Until April 2007, Sweden benefits from the 
transitional period for the sectoral classification of 

pension schemes. (See box 2.2).

                     developments
Activity in 2006 
After the sharp slowdown registered in 2005, when 
the economy grew well below potential at 1.9%, real 
GDP growth rebounded at the turn of the year 2005 

and remained robust in the 
first three qu
arters of 2006, 
posting annualised growth of 2.8%.  
Output in the dominant service sector continued to 
grow steadily in the first
 half of 2006. Manufacturing 
output, which actually shrank 
in 2005, picked up in 
the first half of 2006, of
fsetting a significant fall in oil 
output.  
For 2006 as a whole, real GDP is expected to grow by 
2¾%. The recovery is driven by domestic demand, 
with household consumption returning to more 
sustained growth after its weakness in 2005, although 

this pace is expected to moderate slightly in the 
remainder of the year. Despite higher inflation 
reducing real income growth, consumption has been 

supported by an increase in employment and 
sustained growth in nomina
l incomes, as well as a 
pick-up in the housing market.  
Total investment also picked
 up in the first half of the 
year, supported by the continued substantial increase 
in government investment, 
but also reflecting stronger 
growth of business investment which might be 
responding to favourable conditions (high liquidity, 
low cost of capital and 
low relative cost of capital 
goods) after relatively subdued growth in the past. 
Total investment is expected to continue to grow 
relatively strongly in the second half of the year.  
Net trade evolved erratically in the first half of 2006, 
with very strong recorded growth of both exports and 
imports, although data are estimated to be 
significantly distorted 
by intra-Community VAT 
fraud. Overall, in the first half of 2006 net trade 
constituted a small drag on 
growth which is expected 
to be the case for the year as a whole. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Real GDP growth is expected to moderate slightly 
over the forecast period to around 2½% in 2007 and 
2008.    
Private consumption growth is forecast to stabilise at 
a growth rate of around 2¼% over the forecast period, 

a more moderate rate compared to the average growth 
of over 3% seen in the past ten years. This is 
supported by relatively firm growth of disposable 

incomes, which should be buoyed by a decline in 
consumer price inflation 
offsetting a slight softening 
of employment growth. More
 subdued prospects for 
consumption are reflected in an expected increase in 
household saving rates, cont
inuing the rise seen last 
year from the low levels in
 2004, with households 
consolidating their balance
 sheets in response to 
uncertainty about futu
re income and employment 
prospects and concern for the adequacy of savings for 
retirement.  
Total investment is expected to continue to grow at a 
sustained rate in 2007 and then moderate in 2008. 

This reflects significant
 planned government 
investment growth, which peaks in 2007 and 
moderates subsequently. Housi
ng investment is also 
expected to soften by the end of the forecast period, 
responding to tighter financial conditions, while 
103103103Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2006 The United Kingdom 
- 104 - 
business investment should continue to grow at a 
moderate but significant pace, responding to the 
erosion of spare capital capacity and to the increase in 

the labour supply.  Government consumption is expected to continue to 
grow relatively steadily, in line with expenditure plans 
up to 2007 and consistent with a technical assumption 

on the evolution of expenditure in 2008. 
On the external side, net trade should provide a 
neutral contribution to growth. This reflects 
improving prospects for the euro area, the UK's 

largest export market, and an expected slowing in 
import growth, given an only moderate private 
consumption pick-up. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Despite recent declines in energy prices, announced 
increases in utility prices, match
ed with the probable 
impact of an increase in higher education costs, are 
expected to push HICP
1 inflation close to 2½% for 
2006 as a whole. Second-round inflationary pressures 
have, however, not materialised so far, with wage 
growth remaining subdued, while the expected 
decrease in wholesale energy prices seen in the late 
summer should feed into retail prices with a lag. Thus 

inflation should moderate back towards the 2% Bank 
of England target within the forecast horizon. 
Over the past year, the labour market has seen a sharp 
increase in labour supply, partly due to record net 

immigration, but also to
 the increasing labour force 
participation of older workers, possibly as a 
consequence of structural reforms – such as targeted 

labour market policies – as well as concerns relating 
to the adequacy of retirement savings. This increase in 
labour market participation 
is reflected both in growth 
in numbers in employment and by an increase in the 
unemployment rate. The latter 
is also likely to reflect 
some unwinding of labour hoarding that took place 

during the slowdown in 2005, and is a factor 
supporting a recovery in pro
ductivity growth. Going 
forwards, unemployment is expected to fall back to 

around 5% over the forecast period, as unemployed 
workers are either absorbed by an increase in 
employment or leave the labour market.

government deficit in the 2005/06 financial year
2 was 
2.9% of GDP, a lower deficit 
than estimated on the 
basis of preliminary outturns in the spring forecast. 
The downward revision to deficit is due to lower 
investment expenditure than originally planned by the 

government and to a reclassification by the UK Office 
for National Statistics of a public entity into general 
government, which has a te
mporary deficit-reducing 
impact in 2005/06.    
The table below shows the 
projections for general 
government deficit and debt 
on a financial year basis.

General government projections on a financial year basis (% GDP)
 In the current financial year, the deficit is expected to 
remain at around the 3% of GDP reference value, 
while it is expected to na
rrow progressively to 2¾% 
of GDP and to 2½ % of GDP in 2007/08 and 2008/09 

respectively.   In 2006/07 revenues are expected to increase 
supported by a general pick
-up in economic growth, 
and more specifically by high 
corporate profitability boosting corporate tax receipts, especially from the oil 
and financial sectors, continui
ng the trend that started 
in late 2005. However, 
while profitability across the 
economy is expected to remain high, the recent 
decrease of world oil prices and the significant drop in 
domestic oil production in the UK might dampen oil 

sector profitability going forward. 
The projections also assume
 that the government will 
meet its plans for non-cyclical primary expenditure, 
and thus that the under-spending seen in 2005/06 
should not be carried over or repeated. Higher 
unemployment should margi
nally increase pressure 
on social expenditure, although the larger part of

 social benefits in the UK is not directly 
unemployment-related.  
The deficit in 2007/08 is expected to improve to 
below the 3% of GDP reference value, driven by 

fiscal drag, a slight moderation in expenditure growth 
and the lagged effect of discretionary measures 
implemented since autumn 2005 – including an 

increase in taxation on o
il companies – and further 
measures to improve tax compliance.  
In 2008/09 the forecast projects a continued moderate 
fiscal consolidation, with the deficit reduced to 2½% 

of GDP. This improvement is driven mainly by fiscal 
drag, while the expenditure 
to GDP ratio is assumed 
to remain constant. This is technical assumption, as 

the UK authorities have 
not confirmed specific 
spending plans for 2008/09, which will be published 
in the Comprehensive Spending Review, announced 

for July 2007. Should the Comprehensive Spending 
Review fully implement 
the UK authorities' current 
working assumption on the evolution of expenditure 
in 2008/09, which implies a drop in the expenditure 
ratio by about 0.3% 
of GDP, the fiscal consolidation 
would be more marked..  
General government gross debt is projected to 
increase from around 42% of 
GDP in 2005/06 to 
around 44% of GDP in 2008/09.

Forecast
%%Activity in 2006 
Real GDP growth had declined to 5.5% in 2005, due 
to the flood-related slowdown 
in the second half. It 
reaccelerated to 6.1% in the first half of 2006. Growth 

was mainly driven by private consumption, which 
expanded by 6.4%, and by exceptionally strong 
investment growth. In the second half of 2005 and 

first half of 2006 gross fixed capital formation grew 
by more than 20%. Growth of exports of goods and 
services remained robust at a rate of above 10% in the 

first two quarters of 2006, while 
growth of imports of 
goods and services started to decelerate in the second 
quarter. 
Inflation remained at above 8% in the first half of 
2006, mainly due to a hike in excise duties on tobacco 
and cigarettes taking effect in January. Due to a base 
year effect, inflation came down to 5.6% in 

September as the impact of higher prices for oil and 
food in the second half of last year is starting to wane. 
Employment growth has been stro
ng in the first half, 
due to private sector job cr
eation and a shift from 
informal employment to th
e formal sector following a 
reduction of social security contributions in January. 
The unemployment rate thus con
tinued to fall to 9.0% 
at the end of the second quarter. 
Although growth of merchandise exports outpaced 
that of imports, the tr
ade deficit increased slightly 
again in the first half of 
2006 to 20.5% of GDP. This, 
together with higher imports of services, lower current 

transfers and lower net incomes from abroad, has led 
to a further widening of the current account deficit to 
13.9% of GDP. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Economic growth is expected to accelerate further in 
2007 and 2008 as strong investment growth and 
ongoing enterprise restructur
ing continue to bear fruit 
and as higher EU transfers and associated 
infrastructure investments give a further boost to 
growth. 

 In both 2007 and 2008, increasing absorption of EU 
transfers together with 
continued strong foreign 
capital inflows will help 
to sustain relatively high 
rates of investment growth of around 14% per year. 
At the same time, higher real wage increases and 
robust employment growth 
are expected to lead to a 
stronger expansion of private consumption. This will 
only partly be offset by 
a slower rise in public 
consumption as the government tries to make room 

for increased capital expenditures. Some fiscal 
expansion in 2007 and 2008 as a result of additional, 
accession-related expenditure needs will further boost 

domestic demand. Consequently, real GDP growth is 
expected to gradually increase to above 6% in 2008. 
Growth of merchandise expo
rts is expected to remain 
robust as foreign investments and restructuring 
continue to strengthen th
e export basis of the 
Bulgarian economy, which sh
ould at the same time 
diversify further into hi
gher value added sectors. 
Strong demand for investment and consumer goods 
implies, however, that import growth is likely to 

outpace export growth in the next two years in real 
terms. The trade deficit is therefore expected to 
increase further. A modest reduction in the current 

account deficit may nevertheless be expected thanks 
to considerably higher inflow
s of current transfers. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
With a decreasing and rapidly ageing population, the 
potential for further employment growth is limited. 

Sustained improvements in participation and 
employment rates are expected to allow for further 
employment growth of around 1% over the 

forecasting period. This will go hand in hand with a 
further rapid decline in the unemployment rate to 
around 7% in 2008. The 
labour market situation is 
thus becoming increasingly tight, with labour 
shortages becoming more acute in some sectors, 

especially with regard to better qualified workers. 
This is expected to lead to noticeably higher wage

 increases in the future. Nevertheless, real wage 
increases are expected to still re
main largely in line 
with productivity gains. 
Due to the increase in indirect taxes, consumer price 
inflation is expected to accelerate to close to 7% on 
average in 2006. Decreasing oil prices and the base-
year effect of the tax increases in 2006 should reduce 

average inflation to around 3½% next year. However, 
underlying price pressures from wage increases and in 
the service sector could imply a moderate re-

acceleration of inflation in 2008. 
Public finances 
Further efforts to tighten fisc
al policy in 2006 should 
lead to an increase in the general government surplus 
to above 3% of GDP this year. This will be achieved 

despite a significant reducti
on in social security 
contributions at the start of the year and is due to 
revenue over-performance as a result of higher-than-
expected growth as 
well as expenditure restraint. Some further tax cuts in 2007 together with lower 
VAT revenues following accession will imply a 
somewhat lower growth of revenue next year. At the 
same time, Bulgaria’s financial contribution to the EU 
and additional financing 
needs related to the co-
financing of Structural Funds projects are likely to 

imply a stronger increase in expenditures. 
Consequently, some fiscal rel
axation is expected in 
2007 and – albeit to a much lesser extent – in 2008. 

The general government budget surplus is thus 
expected to come down to around 2% of GDP. 
In line with the strong 
GDP growth and the 
continuation of fiscal surpl
uses, general government 
gross debt is expected to drop further, to below 20% 
of GDP, up to the end of the forecasting period.

Graph 4.2: 
Romania - GDP and components 
 % %Developments in 2005
 After strong growth of 8.4% in 2004, real GDP 
growth slowed to 4.1% in 
2005, due mainly to the 
negative impact of floods a
nd structural changes in 
industrial activity on the back of a rapid real 
appreciation of the exchange rate, increasing energy 
prices and high wage growth. Value added in 

agriculture declined by 13.9% and recorded a modest 
increase of 2.5% in industry. Gross fixed capital 
formation increased strongly by 13%, outpacing 

private consumption, which grew by 9.7%. Stocks 
contributed negatively to growth by 1.1 percentage 
point due to the depletion 
of agricultural stocks. 
Imports again expanded more strongly than exports, 
which lost momentum as a consequence of the above-
mentioned adverse shocks. Consumer price inflation 

declined to 9%, but the disinflation process slowed 
despite the fall in impor
t prices caused by the real 
appreciation. Employment continued to grow, 

although only slowly as 
several labour-intensive industries contracted. The current account deficit 
widened to 8.7% of GDP, of which 75% was covered 
by net foreign di
rect investment.  
Prospects for 2006 to 2008 
In 2006 real GDP growth is expected to bounce back 
strongly to 7.2%, driven by a broad-based recovery in 

industrial activity, construction and agriculture. Over 
2007 and 2008, real growth
 will remain robust at 
respectively 5.8% and 5.
6%. Industrial activity is 
projected to remain fairly 
resilient to the structural 
challenges posed by EU accession, high energy prices 
and the redirection of out
put growth towards higher 
value-added sectors. The boom in the construction 
sector is foreseen to continue on the back of high 
demand for residential and
 office buildings as well as 
public infrastructure projects. Agricultural output will, 
assuming normal weather conditions, grow by 4.5% 
in 2006, recovering from the depressed output in 

2005, and will then return to a long-term average 
growth rate of around 3%. 
Strong domestic demand dynamics are foreseen to 
persist over the forecast period. Gross fixed capital 

formation is expected to grow robustly by around 
10% annually on the back of considerable FDI 
inflows, further flood repairs in 2006 and the 

acceleration of public investment projects. Private 
consumption growth will be buoyant in 2006 due to 
extraordinarily high retail sales, surging credit growth 

and a positive trend in the rural population’s own 
consumption as a result of the sector's recovery. In 
2007-08, the central bank's policy to restrict lending 

and more subdued wage dynamics are expected to 
help private consumption gradually return to a more 
sustainable growth path. 
Public consumption is 
expected to record a steady expansion, mainly driven 
by the increase in current spending. There is a 

tangible risk, however, th
at household consumption 
will not moderate and that an increasingly pro-
cyclical public expenditure policy will be enacted. In 

that case, an excessive expansion of domestic demand 
and an unsustainable widening of external imbalances 
cannot be ruled out.   
Annual average consumer price inflation is expected 
to gradually declin
e to around 4.6% in 2008 as it is 
assumed that demand-pull and cost-push factors will 
be kept in check by a continued tight monetary policy, 

a sound fiscal policy and prudent wage growth.  
A modest increase in employment of about 0.2% is 
anticipated over the forecast period, which is 
considerably lower than the economic growth rate 

might indicate. The job creation process in the private 
sector will be mitigated by the continuation of lay-offs 
in state-owned enterprises and the shrinking of 
labour-intensive light i
ndustry. Unemployment is 
foreseen to remain broadly stable.  
Public finance 
The 2005 general government deficit was revised up 
from 0.4% of GDP to 1.5% of GDP due to a strong 
increase in public sector wages and transfers against

 the background of income and profit tax cuts having 
had a negative impact on direct tax revenue of 1% of 
GDP in 2005. Over the forecast period, revenues from 

both direct and indirect taxes are projected to increase 
relative to GDP due to th
e favourable macroeconomic 
conditions and the continued efforts to broaden the tax 

base and improve collection. The increasingly relaxed 
expenditure policy will over the forecast period cause 
considerable growth in social transfers, wage 

expenditure and other current spending as a share of 
GDP. Supported by EU accession, public investment 
will increase faster than GDP, even if implementation 

difficulties do not allow the government's ambitious 
investment programme to be met. The general 
government deficit is projected to expand to 1.4% of 

GDP in 2006 and remain
 roughly stable at around 
2.6% of GDP in 2007-08. The downward revision of 
the deficit in 2006-07 is due to higher-than-expected 

direct tax revenue and to the Property Fund scheme 
for compensation of citizens 
for the non-return of 
confiscated property advancing only slowly. The 
stock of public debt will decline further in 2006 to 
13.7% of GDP but then increase slowly due to higher 
primary deficits.
 External balances The robust growth in export volumes is projected to 
continue and will be accompanied by a gradual 
decline in the growth of import volumes as domestic 
demand growth eases. A slight improvement in the 

terms of trade is expected to continue until 2008. 
However, even these beneficial factors will not 
prevent a further widening of the trade deficit from to 

nearly 14% of GDP in 2008. Remittances and EU 
transfers will mitigate the impact on the current 
account deficit, which will nevertheless still continue 

to widen considerably.

yRecent economic developments 
In the first half of 2006, GDP grew by 4.8%, up from 
3.5% in the same period a year ago. Growth continued 
to be driven by strong domestic demand.  In 

particular, investment spending increased strongly by 
12.6% year on year.  Private consumption expanded 
by 3%, somewhat lower than during the same period a 

year ago.  Real growth of imports of goods and 
services was slightly stronger (9.5%) than the growth 
of exports (9%), and net exports posted a negative 

contribution to growth (2.2 percentage points).  High 
frequency indicators suggest a continuation of growth 
in the third quarter, when
 industrial production 
expanded by 5.8% year on year.  Construction output 
rose 8.3% year on year in July.  
On a twelve-months moving average, annual average 
consumer prices increased slightly to 3.6% in 

September (2005: 3.3%), largely on the back of higher 
prices for energy, food and local services. In the same 
month, end-year consumer price inflation came down 

to 2.8% and producer price inflation stood at 2%.   
According to most recent data published by the 
Croatian National Bank, the 
current account deficit 
widened further. In the twelve months to end-June, it 
increased sharply to 7.7% of GDP as compared to 
6.3% of GDP in 2005. In the same time, the trade 

deficit rose to 24.8% of GDP (up from 24.3% in 
2005) and the su
rplus in services sli
ghtly declined to 
16.8% (from 17.1%).  Mo
reover, a higher income 
balance deficit of 3.4% (3.1% 
in 2005) and a lower 
surplus in transfers of 3.7% (against 4.0% in 2005) 
added to the increase of the current account deficit.  
Prospects for 2006 to 2008 
In 2006 and 2007, real GDP growth is projected to 
accelerate modestly to 4.5% and 4.6%, respectively. 
Growth will continue to be driven by strong domestic 

demand.  Continued strong credit growth and 
consumer confidence, debt 
repayments to pensioners 
as well as an increase in wages and social transfers 

will support an acceleration of private consumption 
growth to 4% in 2006 and 4.4% in 2007. Some pre-
election spending before
 the general elections 
scheduled for late 2007 will push average public 
consumption growth upwards to 2.5% and 2.7% in 
2006 and 2007, respectively, compared to 0.8% in 

2005. The forecast projects an acceleration of gross 
fixed capital formation growth over the reference 
period to 7.5% in 2008, as 
compared to 4.8% in 2005. 
This will result from stronger private investment as 
investor confidence improves further in view of the 
EU accession process. Also, a temporary boost of 

public investment projects 
appears likely in view of 
the 2007 general elections. A favourable external 
environment will help boosting real export growth to 
above 7% in 2007 and 2008, also driven by strong 
services exports. The growth of real import is 

expected to accelerate to 6.8% in 2007, before it 
slightly falls to 5.8% in 2008 as domestic demand 
pressures will start to ease.   
A continuation of stability-o
riented monetary policies 
will keep inflation at relative
ly low levels over the 
forecast period.  Annual average consumer price 
inflation will slightly increase to 3.4% in 2006, 

mainly as a result of higher prices for energy, food 
and some services provided at 
the municipal level.  
Inflation will slightly fall in 20
07 and 2008, as energy 
prices are set to increase at a slower pace.  However, 
catching-up effects and further administrative price 
adjustments will preven
t average inflation to fall 
below 3%.  
Growth and investment dynam
ics are expected to lead 
to a slightly higher employment growth of 1.5% in 
2006 and 1.8% in 2007, as compared to 0.8% 
recorded in 2005. This supports a gradual reduction of 
the unemployment rate to 11% at the end of the 

forecast period. In 2006 and 2007, real average wages 
are expected to grow stronger than average 
productivity gains, leading to an increase in real unit 

labour costs of around 1% in 2006 and in 2007.

 Public finances 
The forecast projects a slowing of fiscal adjustment   
in late 2006 and 2007 
and higher fiscal deficits than 
those officially projected by 
the authorities. Due to favourable fiscal developments in the first half of 
2006, namely strong revenue growth and some 
moderation of current and capital spending, the 

general government deficit (ESA95) is projected to be 
reduced from 3.9% in 2005 to 3.5% of GDP in 2006.  
In 2007, the deficit is exp
ected to slightly increase to 
3.6% of GDP.  Stronger public consumption will 
prevent further deficit re
duction. In particular, the 
public sector wage bill is forecast to increase due to 

both wage increases and a rise in employment.  The 
growth of social welfare spending including pensions 
and of public investments are expected to accelerate 

in 2007.  The public debt ratio is expected to be 
reduced only slightly to 44% 
of GDP by 2008, as  part  
 of privatisation revenues will be used to finance the 
scheduled repayment of pensioner's debt in 2006 and 
2007.  External balances The trade deficit is forecast to increase to 25% of 
GDPP in 2007, driven by strong import demand, a 
slight deterioration of the terms of trade as well as a 
high import content of exports and investment. The 

surplus of the serv
ices balance will slightly increase, 
mostly due to a good tourism performance. However, 
the current account deficit is set to widen to around 

7% of GDP over the forecast period. Net foreign 
direct investments, which are 
largely driven by further 
major privatisation deals, are expected to finance a 

significant share of the cu
rrent account deficit over 
the forecast period.

Forecast
%%The situation in 2006 
During the first half of 2006, economic growth 
slowed down to 2.6%, compared to 3.9% a year 
before. Main factors were 
weak output growth in 
manufacturing and construction, while transport and 
retail trade performed better than the overall 
aggregate. Contemporaneous indicators such as 

industrial production point to a marked acceleration of 
economic activity during the second half of 2006, 
which is likely to
 bring GDP growth close to 4% for 
the whole year. Employment increased by some 6% 
during the first half of 2006, while the official 
unemployment rate declined by
 1 percentage point to 
36.1% by mid-2006. The positive impact of stronger 
employment growth on unemployment was reduced 
by a rising labour supply.  
Inflation accelerated to 3.3% year-on-year during the 
first nine months of 2006,
 reflecting higher energy 
prices and increases in excise taxes on alcohol and 
tobacco, which were aligned
 with European levels. 
Inflation is likely to rem
ain slightly above 3% for the 
rest of the year, which will 
bring average inflation to 
about 3¼% for 2006. In 20
05, annual inflation had 
been 0.5%, reflecting declining food prices as a result 
of the trade liberalisation due to WTO membership.  
External balances so 
far remained relatively stable 
after the marked improveme
nt during 2005, when a 
strong increase in private transfers had helped to 
reduce the current account deficit from 7.7% of GDP 

in 2004 to 1.4% of GDP in 2005. During the first half 
of 2006, the trade deficit remained largely unchanged 
at some 20% of GDP, while the annualised current 
account deficit was at some 2¾% of GDP.  
Public finances continue to
 remain close to balance. 
After a surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2005, the revenue 
and expenditure performance during the first half of 

2006 points to a general 
government deficit for the 
whole year close to the target of 0.6% of GDP. The 
debt ratio declined to some 35% of GDP by mid-

2006, after a financing transaction had led to a 
temporary increase from 36.6% of GDP end of 2004 
to 40.9% end of 2005.  
Prospects in 2007 and 2008 
During the last years the country made significant 
progress in consolidating its economy, achieving 
sound public sector balances, a stronger external 
position, which allowed lower interest rates, and 

improved confidence of consumers and international 
and domestic investors. As a result, the economy has 
reached a favourable position for better realising the 

country's growth po
tential. However, th
e international 
environment will be less favoura
ble in 2007 and 2008, 
mainly as a result of the expected deceleration of 
growth in the coun
try's main export markets.  
Overall, output growth is exp
ected to reach some 
4½% in 2007 and 5½% in 2008. Like in the case of 

other candidate countries, ec
onomic growth is likely 
to be driving mainly by domestic factors, such as 
private consumption and investment. Private 

consumption will benefit fro
m improved confidence 
of consumers, strong growth of real disposable 
income and continued inflows of private capital 

transfers, for example in th
e form of workers 
remittances. Plans of the new government to reduce 
the tax burden should fu
rther increase disposable 
income. Private investmen
t will be supported by 
recent improvements in the business environment, 
benefiting from measures to 
simplify administrative 
procedures and to strengthen competition within the 
economy. Here too, plans of 
the new government to 
promote investment and to reduce the tax burden 

should create additional incen
tives for investment, 
bringing investment growth to levels comparable to 
other catching-up economies. The strong growth of 
domestic demand and the deceleration of export 
growth will lead to a negative contribution of net-

exports to GDP growth. Howev
er, due to the high 
import content of exports, the deceleration of exports 
will also translate into a deceleration of overall import 

growth.

 Public finances 
The plans of the new government to reduce the tax 
burden and to promote economic growth could lead to 
a temporary increase in the general government 

deficit to slightly above 
1% in 2007. However, 
stronger economic growth an
d the positive revenue 
effects of the planned tax reforms will lead to a 

decline in the deficit in 2008. The combination of 
strong economic growth and relatively low deficits 
will lead to a further reduction of the debt ratio 

towards 34% of GDP by 2008.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The acceleration in economic activity will create 
additional employment. 
However, unemployment is 
likely to remain high, as a part of the new jobs might 

be filled by increased labour supply. As a result, the 
official unemployment rate 
might decline from 37% 
in 2006 to about 35% in 2008, only. Wage growth is 

expected to remain largely in
 line with productivity 
developments.  
Consumer price inflation is likely to decelerate in 
2007 and 2008, as the inflationary impulse from 
higher energy prices and the increase in excise taxes 

will fade away. This should reduce consumer price inflation towards 2¼% by 2008.  
External balances  The trade balance is likely 
to maintain its current 
level, as the high import content of exports will 

largely compensate the de
celeration in exports by also 
lowering imports. Howeve
r, increasing import of 
services and lower cash inflows will contribute to an 

increase in the current account deficit from 2¾% of 
GDP in 2006 to about 4% in 2008. Workers 
remittances and other 
capital inflows, such as 
increasing FDI, are expected to largely finance those 
deficits. 1171171173. Turkey Financial market turbulence hardly affects growth prospects - 118 -

 %Forecast
Recent economic developments 
In 2005 and early 2006, economic stabilisation has 
continued along with a better 
balancing of the sources 
of growth.  During the first half year of 2006, strong 

domestic demand led to an increase in output by 7%.  
Favourable base-year effects, improved price and cost 
competitiveness - due to the a weaker lira - and 

leading indicators, such as indu
strial production and 
business confidence, point to better export prospects 
and continued strong growth in the second half, which 

most likely will bring GDP gr
owth in 2006 to about 
6%. Inflation increased dramatically, reflecting in 
large part the depreciation of the Turkish currency and 

continued upward price pressures in the service 
sector.  As a result, consumer price inflation increased 
to 10½% in September 2006, far above the year-end 

target of 5%.  
After three years of strong growth with almost no job 
creation, employment started to rise since mid-2004 
by roughly 1½% year-on-year
.  The labour force 
participation rate fell slightly to 47%. These trends 
together led to a small fall 
in the unemployment rate 
to below 10%.  Public finances remained largely on 
track, achieving a primary surplu
s of 6½% of GDP.  
This substantial surplus and strong GDP growth led to 
a reduction in the debt ratio, from 77% of GDP in 
2004 to 70% in 2005.  The current account deficit 
widened - reflecting strong domestic demand - from 

6½% of GDP in 2005 to about 7 % in the first half of 
2006.   Prospects in 2007 to 2008 
The overall picture for the forecasting period looks 
favourable.  Turkey shou
ld be able to increase export 
growth - in particular in 
tourism - while the tight 
fiscal policy stance will support the disinflation 
process, in spite of pressures arising from exchange 
rate pass-trough and rigi
dities in services prices.   A gradual decline in
 inflationary pressures will allow 
for a fall in interest rates and improve the investment 
climate.  Overall, economic activity is expected to 
increase by about 6½% throughout the forecasting 

period.  Output growth is expected to be increasingly 
balanced, with private investment and net exports 
outpacing overall growth.  Along with the declining 

inflation, growth of disposab
le income may remain 
broadly constant, which allows the private sector to 
maintain consumption growth at rates above 5½% in 

2006-2008.  Fixed investmen
t will continue to benefit 
from reduced macroeconomic and political 
uncertainty - in particular after the 2007 elections - 

and declining real interest rates.  
On the other hand, 
the build-up of stocks is sl
owing down considerably 
since 2004.  Strong investm
ent and consumption will 
lead to continued high growth of imports, in particular 
of consumer durables and cap
ital goods.  Exports 
should benefit from a weaker lira, as well as from 
diversification and quality im
provements resulting 
from earlier high investments.  Parliamentary and 

Presidential elections are due in 2007. Any possible 
impact stemming from policy changes in the context 
of political events has not been incorporated in the 

current forecast.  
The trend in declining 
inflationary pressures is likely 
to continue as from 200
7.  Fiscal discipline, 
improving credibility of the Central Bank’s 

disinflation targets are impo
rtant elements in this 
respect. 12-month consumer price inflation is 
expected to stay below 9% by the end of 2007. 

However, high oil and services prices might 
slowdown the disinflatio
n process in 2007-2008.  
In line with the stro
ng growth performance, 
employment is forecast to increase by about 2% per 
year. This will lead to a 
slight reduction of the 
unemployment rate from 10% 
in 2005 to 9% in 2008.

 Public finances  
Public sector balances will be affected by higher 
interest rates and higher public spending in the 
election year 2007 and in 2008.  Conversely, the 

ongoing public finance reforms will help to widen the 
tax base and to increase the efficiency of tax 
collection.  Non-interest e
xpenditures are seen to 
remain largely constant relative to GDP.  The general 
government deficit is expected to increase gradually 
from 1.2% of GDP in 2005 to 4% of GDP in 2007. 

General government debt is forecast to stabilize 
around 69-70% in 2006-2007 before falling to 63% at 
the end of 2008.  
 
 
 External balances Growth of imports will remain strong, partially 
reflecting a rather high import
 content of exports.  
Exports will gradually start benefiting from a weaker 

currency.  The current account deficit is therefore 
forecast to stabilize around 7% of GDP in 2007-2008.  
A higher surplus of the services balance should 

contribute to maintain positive medium-term 
prospects in the external sector.

Forecast
A maturing expansion with decelerating growth   
US economic growth has decelerated over the past six 
months. In the three years to the first quarter of 2006 
the economy grew at an average annual rate of 3.8%, 

clearly above its long-term potential. The current 
expansion, which started in late 2001, seems now to 
have reached a mature phase and signs of a slowdown 

are becoming evident. GDP growth fell to an annual 
rate of 2.6% in the second quarter and the available 
data suggest that output gr
owth has slowed further in 
the third quarter. 
The slowdown is so far mainly 
concentrated in the 
housing sector. Residential 
investment contracted at 
an annual rate of 11% in the second quarter. Housing 

starts have fallen by about 20% and home sales by 
10% since the fourth quarter of last year. House price 
appreciation has also slowed sharply 
and some local 
markets have experienced outright price declines. 
However, significant spillover effects on other parts 
of the economy are not yet discernible in the data. 

Certainly, consumer spendi
ng has softened somewhat, 
but more likely as a result of surging energy prices up 
to July. Non-residen
tial construction 
activity actually increased sharply in the first half of the year. Business 
equipment investment stalled
 in the second quarter, 
but probably only in reaction to very strong growth in 
the first quarter. The labour market has rema
ined relatively tight 
through the third qua
rter with the unemployment rate 
hovering around 4.7%. Nominal wage growth has 
gradually increased to 4.0% year-on-year in 
September, unit labour costs have increased 
significantly since mid-2005,
 and core PCE inflation 
has risen to 2½%.  The current account deficit reached 
6.4% of GDP in national 
account terms in the first 
half of the year while the fiscal deficit of general 
government receded to 2.2% of GDP. The unexpected 
improvement in the fiscal position was due to 

continued strength in tax revenue growth. 
Housing correction expected to result in a "soft 
landing" for the economy. 
The outlook depends crucially on how much further 
the housing sector will cool down and how strong the 

spillover effects to the rest 
of the economy will be. 
The forecast assumes that residential construction will 
continue to contract until 
the middle of next year. Its 
share of GDP (in 2000 prices) will fall from the 
historically high level of 5.
5% in 2005 to 4.4% by the 
third quarter of next year which
 is equal to its level 
before the onset of the recent building boom. Such 
downsizing of residentia
l investment would reduce 
overall GDP growth by 0.6 percentage points in 2007. 

Following the pattern of previ
ous building cycles, the 
sector would then rebound in 2008. 
As part of the housing market slowdown, it is 
assumed that the level of house prices will fall by 
10% nationwide in the twelve months to mid-2007 
(following a 50% rise in the most reliable house price 

index in 2001-2005). The associated negative wealth 
effect will reduce consumer spending by 2/3 of a 
percentage point of GDP. To this one can add some 

consumer retrenchment from confidence effects. 
In the near term consumer spending will receive a 
positive impulse from the recent fall in energy prices. 
Financial conditions are 
expected to remain quite 
supportive of borrowing and spending. Business 
investment will not be immune from adverse spillover 
effects from the housing sector, but it will be 

supported by relatively high capacity utilisation, high 
profitability, and healthy corporate balance sheets. 
Although the housing market correction should keep 
GDP growth below long-term 
potential through 2007, 
the economy is not expected to go into a downward 
spiral. Since inflationary pressures have remained 
relatively contained and are likely to moderate over 
time, a "soft landing" of the economy could be 
supported by an easing of monetary policy in 2007. 

Continuing solid growth 
in US export markets should 
also dampen the slowdown.

Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The forecast projects GDP growth in the 2%–3% 
range from the fourth quarter of 2006 to mid-2008. In 
the last six months of the forecast period, when the 

contractionary effects of the housing correction will 
have largely petered out, quar
terly GDP growth (in 
annual terms) should rise to the 3%–3
% range, close 
to long-term potential. Consumer spending growth is 
projected to recede to 1¾ % in the middle quarters of 
next year before rising back up to the 2 – 2½ % range. 

As the household sector's disposable income should 
rise somewhat faster than personal consumption on 
the basis of moderately risi
ng employment and wages, 
the household saving rate would recover from -0.5% 
in 2006 to +1.8% in 2008. 
In the context of a slowin
g economy, unemployment 
is projected to rise above 
5% while inflation should 
fall gradually to a level just below 2% by 2008. The 
fiscal deficit of general g
overnment should rise again 
over the next two years, particularly because the 
growth in tax receipts is likely to fall sharply. The 
current account deficit is projected to remain at 6.4% 

of GDP next year, but to worsen slightly in 2008, 
partly because of continued deterioration in the 
balance of net investment income. 
There are risks to the growth forecast on both sides. 
On the downside, there is 
the possibility that the 
housing market correction will be more pronounced 
and/or that the spillover to the rest of the economy 

will be stronger than assumed. There also continue to 
be risks associated with the large current account 
deficit and a possible disruptive adjustment. On the 

upside, there is a possibility that the housing 
correction and its overall impact will be weaker than 
outlined above. Financial conditions could also 

become more accommodative to growth than 
expected.

Economic expansion strengthened in 2006 
In spite of a deceleration in the second quarter of the 
year, the Japanese economy continues to expand 
vigorously. GDP growth averaged 3.0% in the first 

half of 2006, mainly driven
 by domestic factors.  
The lower growth performance in the second quarter 
of the year was mainly due to a negative contribution 
to GDP growth from public investment, stocks and 

net trade.
 Since the beginning of the year, household 
consumption remained supported by high confidence 
and better employment prospects. Industrial 

production embarked last year on an upward trend. 
Buoyant profits and a turnaround in bank credit, 
notably to small firms, have triggered an increase of 

business investment since the middle of last year.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Looking ahead, Japanese economy is set to continue 
to expand steadily. The situation in the labour market 
is still improving. At 4.1% in August, the 

unemployment rate remains close to an eight-year 
low. In addition, full-time em
ployment has been on a 
rising trend for several quarters after six years of 
decline. Household income has started to rise, albeit 
still moderately, and it is expected to further expand 

in the near future. Household consumption growth is 
thus forecast to remain robust in the coming years.  
The quarterly September Tankan survey showed 
strong business confid
ence. Non-residential 
investment is expected to remain dynamic over the 
coming quarters, supported by strong profits and a 
sound financial situation in
 Japanese firms. On the 
back of rising land prices after several years of 
decline, residential investment growth is forecast to 
resume. 
On the external side, net exports are expected to add 
little to GDP growth in the coming quarters as the 
foreseen acceleration in imports should partially offset 
the strength of exports. Though remaining sizeable, 

Japan's current account surplus is forecast to diminish 
gradually, from 3.6% of GDP in 2005 to 2.8% in 
2008. All in all, GDP growth is projected to reach 2.7% in 
2006, after 2.6% in 2005
. Growth should thereafter 
decelerate gradually but is expected to remain above 
the potential rate. GDP growth
 should reach 2.3% and 
2.1% respectively in 2007 and 2008. 
Price developments and monetary policy 
The Japanese economy is gradually coming out of 
deflation. In August, the 
annual rate of headline 
inflation stood at 0.9%; the Bank of Japan's core 

inflation (excluding only fresh food) stood at 0.3%. 
Both indices were rebased in 
July to incorporate a 
new benchmark basket of consumption. After the 
rebasing, it appears that inflation has been slightly 
positive for the last few months only, while it was 

thought to be positive since the beginning of 2006. 
Moreover, excluding food and energy, consumer 
prices are continuing to decline (-0.4% year-on-year 

in August) as is the private consumption deflator (-
0.1% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2006). 
However, the underlying gr
adual and slow up-trend 
out of deflation remains valid. Headline inflation is 
forecast to average 0.4% and 0.7% in 2007 and 2008 
respectively. In light of these developments and of the 
strengthening of the econo
mic expansion, the Bank of 
Japan (BoJ) decided last spring 
to end the quantitative 
easing policy framework that had been in place since 

2001 and to introduce a new framework based on the 
overnight call rate as the ope
rating target. On 14 July, 
the BoJ decided to raise 
the policy rate to 0.25%, with 
further increases expected in the near future. The new 
inflation figures might force the Bank of Japan to 
continue to act with caution when gradually bringing 
the policy rate back to 
a neutral level.

Public finances remain on a long-term 
unsustainable path  
The government has repeatedly stated the objective of 
reducing the primary deficit by about 0.5 of a 

percentage point annually so 
as to achieve the target 
of primary balance in the early 2010s. In July 2006, 
the Japanese government adopted an economic and 

fiscal blueprint that spells 
out the fiscal strategy. 
To achieve a fiscal primary surplus by 2011, the 
Japanese government estimated, in the absence of 
corrective measures, a fiscal revenue shortfall of 

about 16.5 trl JPY (3.3% GDP) over the next five 
years, under the assumption of 3% yearly nominal 
GDP growth and long-term yields at 4%. The bulk of 

the revenue shortfall should be compensated by 
spending cuts (mainly public works, social security 
spending, and public payroll). The remainder of the 

budget shortfall is expected 
to be offset by higher 
revenues elsewhere and sales of public assets. While 
precise numerical targets for the spending cuts were 
indicated in the 2006 guidelines, how the remaining 
shortfall is to be made up st
ill needs to be spelt out. 
For instance, it is estimated that a 1 to 2% increase in 
the consumption tax rate could, on its own, be 
sufficient to finan
ce the estimated revenue shortfall. 
On the other had, a more ambitious hike (to a double-
digit rate) would yield higher revenues and lead more 
rapidly to a large fiscal primary surplus, which is a 

precondition for reducing 
the debt-to-GDP ratio. 
While the reduction in 
public spending should continue, tax reform measures (which might include a 
reform of the income tax or a consumption tax rate 

hike) seem necessary to produce the fiscal 
consolidation needed to ensure public debt 
sustainability.

Economic growth has remained very strong in 
2006.  After a growth rate of 10.2% in 2005 (an upward 
revision from the 
earlier estimate of 9.9%), GDP 
growth accelerated to 10.9% y-o-y in the first half of 
2006. The key factors 
behind this higher-than-
expected growth are net merchandise exports and a 

reacceleration of investment spending. GDP growth 
slightly slowed in the third quarter to 10.4% yoy, 
reflecting tightened investment rules and monetary 

policy.  Restricted investment rules and tightened 
monetary policy 
As the investment rate contin
ued to be very high, even 
excessive in some sectors, notably in construction and 

real estate, two sectors of major policy concern, in 
April 2006 the auth
orities started introducing 
measures to rein in investment in sectors such as the 

cement, aluminium, steel, auto and coal industries and 
in real estate. More recently, they also stepped up 
enforcement rules that gove
rn investment projects and 
land use.  
In order to contain the excessive credit expansion, 
driven by the strong increase in foreign exchange 

reserves, the People’s Bank of
 China have taken 
various measures since end-April 2006 to tighten 
domestic liquidity conditions, including moral suasion 

on banks to strictly control credit flows to the overly 
invested sectors, two increases in the benchmark 
lending rate and two increases in the reserve 

requirement ratio. 
Those measures seem to have started working, 
albeit only modestly so far.  
The growth rate of investm
ent and industrial 
production slowed somewh
at in the third quarter, 
responding to the policy actions to curb investment, 
which led to the modest slowing of GDP growth. 
Money and credit growth also showed some 

moderation in August an
d September. Given the so 
far modest impact of the previous measures, further 
tightening measures may be needed.  
Inflation under control 
Despite continued strong output growth and higher 
raw material and energy costs, year-on-year inflation 
has fallen in 2006, with the rate of CPI decreasing 
from 1.8% in 2005 to 1.3% on average in the three 

first quarters of 2006. This was largely due to a 
deceleration of food price increases and state controls 
on local oil prices. Inflation was slightly higher in the 

second and third quarter compared to the first, mostly 
reflecting higher food prices and higher domestic oil 
prices following the two price hikes this year.  
A very modest appreciation against the 
background of a booming current account surplus 
After reaching a record surplus of $134 bn (6% of 
GDP), implying an unprecedented current account 

surplus of 7.2% of GDP, China's trade balance 
continued to rise in 2006. 
In the first half of 2006, the 
trade surplus was more than 50% higher than in the 

same period last year, leading to a current account 
surplus of about 8%
 of GDP. Despite these strong 
capital inflows, Chinese exch
ange rate only gained 
2.6% against the dollar in 2005 (including the 2.1% 
revaluation of July 2005) and another 2.1% in the first 
nine months of 2006. Th
e volatility and the speed of 
appreciation have however somewhat accelerated in 
recent months, particularly in September.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
China's growth is expected to further ease in the last 
quarter of 2006 and in 2007, reflecting earlier policy 

measures to rein in inve
stment growth as well as 
likely further tightening moves. A moderation of 
external demand following some softness in US 
growth is also expected to contribute to some growth 
deceleration. Private consumption is forecast to 

remain strong, partially offsetting the moderation in 
investment activity. As a result, GDP growth is likely

 to average 10.4% in 2006, before modestly slowing to 
about 9.8% in 2007 and 9.7% in 2008.  
This is a significant upward revision compared with 
the spring forecast (of 0.9 percentage points for 2006 

and 0.8 percentage points for 2007) due to the 
stronger-than-expected outcome 
in first half of this 
year and the revision of the initial GDP growth 

estimate for 2005 from
 9.9% to 10.2%.  
Inflation is likely to somewhat accelerate, with the 
CPI rate averaging about 1.8% in 2006 and remaining 
in the vicinity of 2% in the forecast period, reflecting 

higher property prices, further hikes in administered 
energy and public utility prices, and higher raw 
material and production costs following rapid 

investment growth.  
For 2006 as a whole, the trade surplus, and hence the 
current account surplus, is likely to exceed last year's 
record and to continue to grow in the coming years. 

However, as a percentage of GDP, it is likely to 
stabilise slightly above 7.5%. 
The balance of 
risks is more on the upside, at least 
in the short term  
Despite recent tightening steps, there are significant 
risks that the measures 
enacted so far will not be 
sufficient to restrain inve
stment growth, notably 
because of the excessive liquidity of the banking 
system following recent foreign exchange 

accumulations. Also, the growing importance of 
retained cash flows and the informal financial sector 
in financing investment and continued local 

governments' pressure on banks to expand their 
lending cast doubts on the efficacy of the enacted 
administrative measures to curb in
vestment. Growth 
could therefore be higher than forecast in the short 
term, but with the accompanying risk of a harder 
landing further down the road.

(see note 10 on concepts and sources).
  However, it does not include the so-called pension reform cost for Denmark, Poland and Sweden that are still benefiting of th
e transitory period 
  ending in April 2007 (see box 2.2 on recording of pension reform costs). Including these costs, the government balance would 
amount to 3 % in Denmark,
  -4.2 % in Poland and 1.7 % in Sweden this year.

Note on concepts and sources 
  1. The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG 
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short- term fully-
fledged economic forecasts twice a year: in the spring and in the 

autumn. These forecasts cover the principal macroeconomic 
aggregates for the Member States, the Acceding and the Candidate 
Countries, the European Union as a whole, the euro area and the international environment. Interim forecasts, updating the outlook 
for the six largest Member States, EU25 and the euro area, are 
presented in between the fully-fledged forecasts.  
2.    Data for 2006, 2007 and 2008 are forecasts. The sources for all 
tables are the Commission services, except where it is otherwise 
stated. Historical data for Member States are based on the European 
System of Accounts (ESA 1995). Most Member States have now 
introduced chain linking in their national accounts to measure the 
development of economic aggregates in volume terms. For the USA 

and Japan the definitions are as in the SNA.  
3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively 
present data including inventories. 4. In Table 16, the data ar
e based on the national index for USA and 
Japan, and for EU Member States 
and aggregates prior ro 1996. 
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential 
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in 
the capital stock and the difference between actual unemployment 
and the NAIRU play a key role.  
6. Employment data are based on numb
ers of persons employed. The 
concept of full-time equivalent (FTE) 
is used for Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland. Tables 21-27 and 31-32 use data 
on FTE for these countries.  7. The nominal short term interest rates are defined as the 3-month 
inter-bank rates. The nominal long term interest rates are defined as 
the yield on the central government benchmark 10-year bond. 
8. EU25 and euro area data are aggregated using exchange rates. 
World GDP is aggregated using purchasing power standards (PPS). 
In the tables on world trade and international payments, the 
aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates.  
Tables 48 - 52, 60 and 61 show also 
EU25 and euro-area "adjusted" balances. Theoretically, balances of EU
25 and euro area vis-à-vis third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of the 
individual countries in the EU25 or
 the euro area. However, intra-
EU25 or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of reporting 
errors.  
   The creation of the internal market in 1993 reduced border controls 
and formalities, and accordingly the scope and precision of intra-EU 
trade coverage. Typically, intra-EU 
imports are underestimated 
compared to intra-EU exports, 
leading to an overestimation of the 
surplus. For the past the "adjusted" balances are Eurostat estimates 
for EU25 and ECB estimates for the euro area. For the future, they 
are ECFIN's forecasts based on the extrapolation of the 
discrepancies observed in 2005. 9. Tables 37, 38, 39 and 42 ar
e based on government deficit and debt 
data for the period 2002-2007, as transmitted by Member States to 
the European Commission in October 2006. The data are according 
to ESA95. Interest expenditure includes settlements under swap 
arrangements and forward rate agreements (Tables 35, 37, 38 and 
40). 
10. The allocation of mobile phone licences (UMTS) impacts strongly 
on the general government accounts for some countries in 2000-
2007. Tables 35, 37 and 39 include the amounts from the sale of the 
licences, while the cyclically adjusted balances in tables 41 and 42 
exclude these amounts. The amounts in bn of national currency are 
for  BE 0.5, for CZ 7.4, for DK 3.2, for DE 50.8, for EE 0.2, for EL 
0.7, for ES 0.5, for FR 1.8, for IE 0.2, for IT 13.8, for HU 52.0, for 

NL 2.7, for AT 0.8, for PL 8.2, for PT 0.4, for SI 24.3, for SK 3.0, 
for UK 22.5, for EU25 110.5,
 and for euro area 72.2. 
11. With respect to the RAMS (recently-acceded Member States), and 
the acceding countries, which are currently in a transition phase, the 
quality of statistical data may not always be directly comparable to 
most EU15 Member States. 
12. Slovenia has been included in the euro area (EUR13) in the autumn 
2006 forecast. This implies that the comparison with the spring 
forecast must be done with care (comparing EUR13 with EUR12). 
       Geographical zones are defined as follows : 
Euro area : 
 EUR13 (BE, DE, EL, ES, FR, IE, IT, LU, NL, AT, PT, SI, FI) 
Acceding countries : 
 Bulgaria and Romania.
