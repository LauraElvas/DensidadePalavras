xOverviewThe economic recovery that started in 2005 is gathering pace in 2006. 
Output growth in 2006 is forecast to reach 2.3% in the EU and 2.1% in the 
euro area, i.e. around ¾ of a percentage point above last year's growth and 

0.2 percentage point higher than forecast six months ago.  In 2007, growth 
is projected to slow somewhat, with 
the annual rate declining by 0.1 
percentage point in the EU and by 0.3 percentage point in the euro area.  
The growth moderation in 2007 has to be 
seen in the context of the planned 
budgetary measures in Germany.  In particular, due to the increase in the 

standard VAT rate by 3 percentage poin
ts on 1 January 2007, German 
households are expected to shift a part
 of their consumption and housing 
investment from 2007 to 2006.  Wh
ile this has a marked impact on the 
projected profile, the overall growth effect for Germany of the budgetary 
policy measures is assessed to be broad
ly neutral over a time horizon of 
two years and does therefore not impl
y a weakening of the underlying 
growth momentum in 2007.   
The recovery in the EU 
and the euro area will be
 underpinned by a 
strengthening of domestic demand. 
More specifically, investment in 
equipment is set to increase at a robust
 pace.  Construction investment is 
also forecast to pick up in 2006.  However, this is to a large extent due to 

an upsurge in Germany, while a significant number of Member States will 
experience a slowdown as a consequence of the expected cooling of 
housing markets.  Private consumption is projected to grow more 
moderately in line with the gradual 
improvement fo
reseen in the labour 
market. Import growth is forecast to pick up in 2006 on the back of 

stronger domestic demand.  As exports are projected to accelerate even 
more rapidly, the net contribution to 
GDP growth from the external sector 
should improve.   
External demand will be helped by the continued strong expansion of the 
world economy.  Indeed, due to an acceleration of economic activity in the 

second half of the year, world GDP growth in 2005 exceeded expectations 
and is now estimated at 4.6%, only ½ 
of a percentage point lower than the 
record high attained in 2004.  The fast pace of world economic activity is 

expected to be sustained
 for most of 2006.  
Owing also to an upward 
revision of the carry-over from 2005, annual average growth is projected to 
remain unchanged at 4.6%.  However, 
this figure masks a moderation of 
the growth momentum later in the year wh
ich is due, in particular, to the 
effects of the monetary tightening
 across world regions and the strong 
increase in the price of oil and other commodities.   
The acceleration in global growth in the second half of 2005 was 
particularly pronounced in the manufact
uring sector, with growth in the 
services sector also gaining momentum.  From a regional perspective, 
upward revisions for China, India and Japan are largely responsible for the 
stronger-than-expected expansion.   
In the United States, while the fourt
h quarter of last year saw a temporary 
weakening due particularly to hurri
cane-related disruptions, underlying 
growth seems to have continued at 
around 3½%.  This figure also 
Growth revival

and the euro area 
Continued strong world 
growth– 
1Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 corresponds to the latest estimate of annua
l average growth in 2005.  The 
current pace of activity is 
expected to continue un
til mid-2006, when the 
effects of tighter monetary conditions co
mbined with a correction in the 
growth of house prices are likely to start 
curbing domestic demand.  For 
the year as a whole, growth is projected to reach 3.2% in 2006 and to 
moderate to 2.7% in 2007 owing to th
e declining growth profile from mid-
2006 on.  While the 
projected slowdown in domestic demand will be 
instrumental in stabilising the deficit in
 the foreign trade balance, it will be 
insufficient by itself to reverse th
e ongoing deterior
ation in the current 
account.   
Economic expansion in Japan, which reac
hed a five-year high in 2005, is 
broadening beyond the manufacturing sector.  The momentum should be 
maintained in 2006 
thanks mainly to high 
growth of business investment, 
spurred by upbeat 
business confidence and strongly improved corporate 
profits, while improvements in th
e labour market should foster private 
consumption.  These factors should help sustain growth at a rate of 2.8% in 
2006 and 2.4% in 2007.  The economy appears to have overcome 

deflation, as consumer prices are e
xpected to edge up by ½-1% per year 
over the forecast period.   
The Chinese economy continues to surprise on the upside, with growth in 
2005 estimated to have reached 9.9%, only marginally below the 10.1% of 
the previous year.  The expansion is driven by bumper rates of growth in 
investment and exports.  The cur
rent account surplus is estimated at 6½% 
of GDP in 2005.  Following
 the replacement of th
e peg against the US 
dollar by a managed float the renminbi 
is expected to gradually appreciate.  
This should act to dampen export grow
th and, as a knock-on effect, reduce 
output growth slightly to around 9½% 
in 2006 and to 9%
 in 2007.   
Among the other emerging regions, growth
 in the main oil-exporting 
countries in 2005 came in above expectations.  For Russia, output growth 

is estimated at around 6½% and for the countries of the Middle East and 
North Africa at 5½%.  Surging inco
me from oil exports made these 
countries' current account surpluses swell further, despite strong growth in 

import volumes.  Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa saw robust 
economic growth in 2005 and the mome
ntum is expected to be maintained 
in 2006, before moderatin
g somewhat in 2007.   
Strong growth in world output spurred world trade, which grew by 6
% in 2005, slightly above earlier e
xpectations.  The pick-up 
of world trade from 
the second quarter on was 
mainly driven by the 
recovery in the global 
manufacturing sector.  With the carry-over reaching 5¼%, world trade 
growth is projected to be in
 the vicinity of 8% in 
2006, and, in step with 
the slowing of output growth, 
to ease to around 7% in 2007.   
Commodity prices increased si
gnificantly in 2005, prim
arily due to the rise 
in prices for oil and other energ
y products.  This year will see further 
strong increases in commodity prices, particularly for fuels but also for 

food and metals.   
–boosts world trade 
2OverviewRegarding oil, the price of Brent fluct
uated between 55 and 65 US dollar 
per barrel between September 2005 and March 2006, when it started a new 
spurt to around 75 US dollar per barr
el by late April.  Behind the high and 
volatile oil prices lies the fact that the oil market remains very tight, as 
strong demand growth on the one ha
nd and recurrent supply disruptions on 
the other have prevented the re
building of spare capacity.  With uncertainty 
due to geopolitical tensions adding
 to recent price pressures, markets 
expect oil prices to stay high 
in the near term.  Considering these factors, 
the price for Brent is assumed to rise 
from 61.4 US dollars 
per barrel in the 
first quarter of 2006 
to an average of around 71 US dollars for the 
remainder of the forecast period.  This corresponds to an annual average 
increase of more than 27% in 2006 
and of around 3% in
 2007 (after an 
increase of more than 40% in 2005).  
Long-term bond yields fell 
to very low levels in 2005.  The euro area, in 
particular, experienced a sustained down
ward trend of 10-year bond yields 
which reached levels last seen
 in the heyday of the Gold Standard.  With 
US bond yields changing only margi
nally, the yield di
fferential between the euro area and the US rose to 120 basis points by October.  Since then, 
bond yields have gradually increased by ar
ound 100 basis points in both 
the euro area and the US.  Since October, bond yields have gradually 

increased by some 100 basis points both in the euro area and the  US. The 
yield differential has narrowed some
what and was slightly above 100 basis 
points at the end of April.   
The yield curve flattened significantly in the course of 2005. A low yield 
spread is often interpreted as heralding and economic downturn.  However, 
the evolution in long-term rates was dri
ven by a number of global factors, 
such as an increase in central ba
nk credibility; Asian central banks' 
purchases of US Treasury bills to main
tain their currency pegs; slow 
growth in corporate sector investment; increased purchases of longer-term 
bonds by pension funds due to population ageing; and the recycling of oil 

income.  Moreover, yield spreads on euro-area corporate bonds relative to 
benchmark bonds remain low, indicating 
that, in the near-term, financial 
conditions continue to be favou
rable and supportive to growth.   
Against this backdrop, the EU 
and the euro area economies seem to have 
overcome the soft patch in 2004-05,
 which was triggered by a strong 
depreciation of the US dollar during 20
03-04 and the sharp rise in oil 
prices.  In the face of the income losses suffered from the negative terms-
of-trade effects of the oil price shock, growth-supporting domestic factors 

such as continued
 favourable financing condition
s, wider profit margins 
and improved corporate balance sheets have regained the upper hand, 
while exports benefit from buoyant wo
rld trade and a correction in the 
euro/US dollar ex
change rate.   
With the recovery set to un
fold, the situation at the 
start of 2006 remains 
characterised by significant growth di
spersion.  In particular, Denmark, 
Greece, Spain, Ireland, Luxembourg and almost all of the recently acceded 

Member States posted growth rates of more 
than 3% in 2005, whilst 
Germany, Italy and Portugal saw outp
ut growth staying below 1%.  
Oil prices spiralling due 
to supply uncertainty Bond yields historically 
low, but on the rise 
Increasing momentum in the EU and the euro 
area economies– 
–but significant 
disparities among Member States 3Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 Moreover, individual components of 
domestic demand are developing at 
different speeds, with robust growt
h of equipment investment contrasting 
with lack-lustre private con
sumption.  Improved profitability in the 
business sector on the one hand, and slow growth in households' 
disposable income on the other, ap
pear to be the main factors behind the 
differences in the performance of in
vestment and consumption.   
A further element in this picture 
is the discrepancy 
observed between 
“hard” statistical data and “soft” survey
 data.  Indeed, despite the mixed 
results provided by hard data over the 
past few months, survey data have 
continued to signal solid underlying 
growth, reaching a 5-year high in a 
majority of sectors.  Discrepancies betwe
en statistical and survey data were 
particularly puzzling for the fourth qu
arter of last year when output figures 
indicated a slowdown in econom
ic growth while confidence indicators 
continued to improve.   
One factor explaining these differences may be related to statistical 
working-day adjustments.  In view
 of a strongly varying number of 
working days in the last two quart
ers of 2005, conventional methods of 
correcting for such variances may have
 led to some distortions.  Though 
this may account for a part of the ap
parent slowdown, it can hardly explain 
the sharp drop in the growth rate of pri
vate consumption.  An additional 
consideration, therefore, is that the loss in 
household purchasing power as 
a result of the surge in 
energy prices during the summer of 2005 may have 
dented real consumption expenditure in
 the final months of the year.   
More recently, hard data has painted a 
somewhat more favourable picture, 
suggesting that the economy has en
tered the first quarter 
of 2006 with 
significant momentum.  Disregard
ing the volatility of quarter-on-quarter 
fluctuations and 
looking at the underlying growth
 in terms of year-on-year 
changes, the rate of expansion continued to improve during 2005.  In the 
EU as a whole, GDP growth accelerated from 1.5% in the first half of 2005

.  Corresponding figures for the euro area are 
1.2% and 1.7%.  
Among the demand components, investment showed the most 
unambiguous signs of a robust upturn
.  Following an annualised growth 
rate of about 2% in the first half of the year, the pace of investment growth 

quickened to almost 3% in the second 
half. These figures should be seen in 
the perspective of the performance of investment during the 2½ years since 
the start of the current expansion. The annualised average growth rate 

during this period amounted to 
little more than 1%, wh
ich is only about 
one half of the rate observed during previous expansions.   
A number of factors account for the slow pace of investment growth 
during this cyclical 
upturn, including a financial 
overextension of the 
corporate sector in the boom years before 2001, a relatively slow return to 
profitability due, inter alia
, to low productivity growth, and enterprises’ 
disenchanted demand expectations.  In 
addition, construction investment 
has continued to be depressed by th
e long-lasting adjustment process in 
Germany following the build-up of a signi
ficant oversupply in the wake of 
re-unification.   
Against this background, th
e pick-up in investment 
growth in the course of 
2005 points to a health
y underlying momentum and, combined with the 
recent acceleration in equity financing and bank loans to companies, 
suggests a further pick
-up in 2006.   
Developments in consumer spending 
have been less encouraging.  
Although showing some improvement 
during 2005, the modest upturn got 
derailed in the fourth quarter when the oil price hike curtailed the 

purchasing power of households.  
The sluggish gr
owth of private 
consumption has to be seen in 
the light of persistently weak growth of 
disposable income, the key determi
nant of household spending. More

–with consumption following more gradually 
5Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 specifically, and bearing in mind that
 employment growth appears to be a 
more important determinant for consu
mer spending than 
growth of hourly 
wages, many EU economies have had difficulties in creating jobs in 

sufficient numbers, as witnessed by continuously h
igh unemployment 
rates.  While considerable cross-country differences exist, and despite 
increased reform efforts in recent years, there 
are still significant structural 
impediments to job creation in many Member States.  In addition, 
uncertainties regarding th
e sustainability of the 
social security systems as a 
consequence of populatio
n ageing may have
 induced households to 
increase their precautionary savings.  It is encouraging to note that labour 
markets experienced some improvements 
during 2005.  An underlying 
improvement is also signalled by consumer surveys, which show consumer 

confidence on a gradual but sustained rise since the summer of last year.   
Export growth was relatively weak in 200
5, after a strong performance in 
the year before.  An important factor be
hind subdued export growth was a 
loss in market shares due to 
the significant appreciation of the euro in real 
effective terms during 2003-04.  However, following the reversal of the 

euro appreciation, export gr
owth picked up from around ½% in the first 
half of 2005 to almost 2% in the second half.  EU exports were also aided 
by strong growth of imports from oil-exporting countries which EU 

exporters seem to have benefited from 
to a more-than-propo
rtional degree. 
Looking ahead, overall GDP growth is expected to pick up as a result of 
both a better performance of domestic demand and an improved 
contribution of the 
external sector.  In particular, investment is set to 
continue growing at a rapid pace underpinned by optimistic business 
sentiment, a favourable profit outlook and the increased need for 
replacement investment.  The assumed gradual tightening of financing 

conditions is not expected
 to impact significantly on investment growth, 
given the momentum of the recovery
.  Nevertheless, somewhat lower 
investment growth is foreseen in 20
07, mainly as a result of a drop in 
residential construction in Germany on the heels of the expected surge in 
2006 caused by the hike in the VAT rate.   
Growth of private consumption should become more solidly based in 
2006, in line with improving lab
our market conditions and higher 
consumer confidence.  
However, the upturn will remain gradual as the rate 
of unemployment comes down only 
slowly and uncertainty over the future 
course of oil prices is likely to k
eep consumers cautious.  In 2007, 
consumption growth is projected to 
slow down marginally, mainly as a 
payback to the temporary acceleration in Germany in the last quarter of 
2006 induced by the VAT hike.   
As a result of the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate in 2005-
06, the losses in export market shares observed in recent years should 
diminish in 2006-07.  Exporters in 
the EU and the euro area should thus 
benefit from the acceleration in external demand in 2006, with export 
growth reaching 6% in the EU and 
5.5% in the euro 
area.  In 2007, export 
growth will be marginally lower.  Imports are projected to outpace exports 
in 2006, but this will reverse in 200
7.  As a result, the contribution to

prove but still be negative in 2006 
before turning positiv
e in 2007.   
The labour market has proved mo
re resilient in the last economic 
slowdown compared to earlier cycles.  Employment growth never turned 
negative and the rise in unemployment remained limited, with the 
unemployment rate peaking at 8.9% 
in the fourth quarter of 2004.  
However, the more limited response in th
e labour market in
 the downturn 
has been followed by a similarly more tempered response in the 

subsequent economic upturn.  Furtherm
ore, the economic recovery has in 
itself been weaker than during previous upswings.   
In line with the usual lagging respon
se of the labour market, employment 
growth is expected to improve, albeit m
odestly, in 2006 to 0.9% in both the 
EU and the euro area.  Employment gr
owth is expected to stabilise at 0.8% 
in both areas in 2007. 
 This corresponds 
to the creation of just above 3½ 
million new jobs in the EU and almost
 2½ million jobs in the euro area in 
2006-07.  The usual influx
 into the labour force wh
en the labour market 
situation improves limits the declin
e in unemployment.  The 
unemployment rate is set to decline gradu
ally to 8.5% in the EU and to 
8.4% in the euro area this year before di
minishing to 8.2% in both areas in 
2007.   
Under the influence of marked increases in oil and energy prices, 
inflationary pressures intensified during most of 2005
 in both the EU and 
the euro area.  Consumer price inflation peaked at 2.6% on the year in 

September 2005 but has come down gradually to 2.2% in March 2006.  
For the year as a whole HICP inflation rose by 2.2% in both regions, 
marginally below the projections in the autumn forecast.  Core inflation, 

i.e. changes in the HICP excluding energy and unprocessed food, eased in 
the first half of 2005 and stab
ilised thereafter at around 1.3%.   
The substantial gap between headline and co
re inflation indicates that the 
oil price hike has not led so far to
 significant indirect 
effects on the non-
energy sub-indices of the HICP.  In
 addition, hourly labour costs have 
declined since the start of 2005 and both consumer surveys and inflation-
indexed bonds suggest that inflation 
expectations remain contained.  Given 
the counterbalancing effect of these forces, year-on-year headline inflation 

is expected to change little over th
e forecast period. Following a slight 
easing in 2006, the VAT rate hike in
 Germany will lead to a temporary 
push at the start of 2007 which should, however, taper off in the course of 

the year. This results in annual 
average inflation of slightly over 2% for 
both the EU and euro area in 2006 and 2007.  The relatively static 
evolution of inflation at the aggregate level conceals a considerable 

dispersion across euro area Member States which, despite a slight 
narrowing of the gap between the high
est and the lowest inflation, remains 
high.  
The current public finance outlook fo
r 2006 and 2007 starts from a better-
than-expected outturn in 2005, which is projected to carry over into the 
forecast period with a small improvement for 2007 (on an unchanged

t budget balance in the euro area as a 
whole was 2.4% of GDP in 2005, as compared to an autumn forecast of 
2.9% of GDP.  The positive 
surprise stems from lower-than-expected 
expenditure in GDP, which more than offset lower revenues.  At the 
country level, the 
better-than-expected outturn
 was relatively broad-based 
though particularly pronounced in Germ
any, Spain, the Netherlands and 
Ireland.   In spite of a relatively marked economic recovery, the general government 
deficit in the euro area is not projected to improve 
but to remain unchanged at 2.4% of GDP.  As a result,
 the cyclically-adjusted 
budget balance is estimated to worsen 
slightly.  In structural terms, i.e. net of cyclical factors 
and temporary measures, the budgetary situation in the euro area is 
estimated to improve gradually over the forecast horizon, 
inter alia
signalling a diminishing recourse to temporary measures.   
Five countries in the euro area are currently in excessive deficit, namely 
Germany, Greece, France, Italy and Portugal.  In France, after falling just 

below 3% of GDP in 2005, the deficit is projected to increase to 3.0% of 
GDP in 2006 and to return margina
lly above the deficit threshold of the 
Treaty in 2007, based on the usual no-policy-change assumptionand

reflecting a lower recourse to one-off measures.  In Italy, current policies 
are projected to merely stabilise the deficit at above 4% of GDP in 2006 
and to lead to a further increase in 2007.  In Greece, the deficit is expected 
to reach the 3% of GDP threshold in 2006, but additional measures will be 
necessary to sustain 
the correction into 2007 and beyond.  In Germany, 
current policies are expected to bring the deficit below 3% of GDP by 
2007.  Unless policies change, the deficit in Portugal is forecast to reach 
4.9% of GDP in 2007.  The deadline 
set by the Council for Portugal to 
bring the deficit below the 3% 
of GDP threshold is end-2008.   
The public finance situation of the other countries in the euro area is not 
expected to give rise to major concerns.  The Netherlands and Ireland are 
forecast to significantly loosen their fiscal position in 2006.  However, in 
both cases the loosening occurs from 
a relatively comfortable budgetary 
position.  Minor changes or small improvements of the nominal budget 
balance are expected in the other countries of the euro area that are not in 
excessive deficit.   
Outside the euro area, diverse fiscal policy and economic trends can be 
seen.  Not all the larger economies currently in EDP, namely Hungary, 

Poland and the United Kingdom, do ta
ke advantage of a the better-than-
expected deficit outturn in 2005 an
d the projected improvement of 
economic conditions to adju
st public finances.  
In Poland, the deficit, after 
having declined to 2.5% of GDP in 2005, is expected to rise again to 3% of 
GDP over the forecast period. In Hungary, current policies are projected to 
increase the deficit towards 7% of GDP 
in 2007.  Only the United 
Kingdom is expected to
 bring the deficit slightly below 3% of GDP at the 
end of the forecast period. The smaller EDP countries outside the euro 

area, Cyprus, Malta and Slovakia, are expected to be more effective in 
consolidating public fin
ances.  Their budgetary positions are expected to 
8Overviewimprove against the backdrop of stable or weak
ening economic growth.  In 
particular, Cyprus and Slovakia are ex
pected to have brought the deficit 
below 3% of GDP in 2005 and to make further progress over the forecast 

horizon.  In Malta, the deficit is exp
ected to decline below 3% of GDP in 
2006.  In the other non-euro-area eco
nomies public finance developments 
are expected to stay within the margins safeguarding against the risks of 

breaching the 3% of GDP threshold.   
In both the EU and the euro area, the 
general government gross debt ratio 
is projected to reverse the upward trend observed since 2003.  Following 
the peak of 70¾% of GDP 
in 2005, the debt 
ratio in the euro area is 
projected to embark on a slow downward path reaching   around 70% of 

GDP in 2007.  A similar d
ecline, from a lower level, 
is expected in the EU.  
The projected downward trend conceals a number of notable exceptions.  
In Hungary, the debt ratio is expected to rise above the 60% of GDP 

threshold in 2007.  In Germany 
and France existing policies, while slowing 
the upward trend compared to the autumn
 2005 outlook,
 are not sufficient 
to reverse it by the end of the forecast period.  Also in Italy, the debt ratio 

is forecast to continue increasing over the forecast horizon. 
Summing up, the economic outlook
 in the EU and the euro area is for a 
return to potential growth wh
ile inflation will stay slightly above 2%.  
However, there are several risk
s to this outlook. 
On the external side, oil and energy prices remain exceptionally high and 
volatile.  With a tight balance between supply and demand, the market 

remains vulnerable to supply disrup
tions.  Price increases above those 
already assumed can not be ruled out 
and continue to be one of the major 
risks to the outlook.  On the other ha
nd, if oil prices currently contain a 
high risk premium due to geopo
litical tensions, an easing of these tensions 
could also imply the possibility of
 a decline in oil prices.     
Global current account imbalances have continued to rise.  Hence, a 
disorderly correction of global im
balances remains a threat to world 
growth.  Furthermore, the gradual rem
oval of excess liquidity could affect 
financial markets more adversely than is usually assumed.  Historically 
low credit-risk premia could adjust abruptly as li
quidity is with
drawn.  The 
rapid growth in highly complex 
financial instrument
s, such as credit 
derivatives, could present a risk 
of discontinuity in more testing times with 
potential knock-on effects to the 
broader financial system.   
Regarding the US economy, a stro
nger adjustment of consumer behaviour 
as a consequence of a sharper-than-expected correction in the US housing 
market cannot be ruled out. 
 However, the strong mome
ntum in the world 
economy and the buoyancy in many 
survey indicators also imply some 
upside risks to the world economy, especially in the shorter horizon.  
A further risk reflects the continue
d concern about a possible global 
pandemic originating from an avian 
flu.  However, the likelihood and the 
severity of a pandemic are extremely difficult to assess with any significant 
degree of confidence.   
Upside and downside 
risks to the forecast 
9Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 On the 
internal side
, private consumption remain
s subject to both upside 
and downside risks.  On the one 
hand, consumer confi
dence may improve 
more than expected due to better labour market conditions and a reduction 

of uncertainty over futur
e income streams, thank
s to past or ongoing 
structural reforms.  Such a recovery in confidence would trigger a release 
of pent-up demand which has accumulated in the household sector and 

which could be financed through a reduct
ion in the saving rate.  On the 
other hand, while not a problem for the euro area or the EU as a whole, 
house prices seem to be stretched in 
some Member States and could pose a 
downside risk in these countries, especially if the price corrections are not 
gradual.   
In the case of investment, pos
itive risks arise from stronger external 
demand or faster productivity growth as a result of IT-investments and past 
reforms.  Negative risks include 
higher oil prices, a disappointing 
development of aggregate demand and entrenched low-growth 
expectations.   
A final risk to both the consumpti
on and investment 
outlook stems from 
the uncertainty surround
ing the impact of th
e German consolidation 
package, which covers a wide range of measures of an unprecedented 

scale.  Economic agents may react to this package differently from what is 
currently assumed, with potentially positive or negative effects on GDP 
growth in Germany and the EU.   
Overall, the risks to the growth outlook in this forecast seem to be fairly 
balanced, but uncertainties, especially on the external side, clearly increase 
over time.  Regarding 2006
, the risks appear slightly 
tilted to the upside, as 
the forecast may underestimate the current momentum of growth, both 

inside and outside th
e EU.  For 2007, the risk
s are more tilted to the 
downside, with the un
certainties linked to the 
evolution of oil prices 
particularly weighing on the gr
owth and inflation outlook.   
In the acceding and candidate countries, economic growth is expected to 
remain strong, increasing by more 
than 5% in Tu
rkey, Bulgaria and 
Romania and by about 4½% in Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia. Main driving forc
es will be private investment and 
consumption. Rising labo
ur productivity and an 
expanding and modernised 
capital stock will help to improve ex
ternal competitiveness 
and to contain 
domestic inflationary pressures. In all countries, domestic demand will 
continue to outpace production and to be driven by very strong investment 

and, to a somewhat lesser extent, private consumption. Externally financed 
credit growth will remain an impor
tant source of financing private 
consumption, raising concerns in some of the countries. 
Inflation is forecast to decline in all countries, with the exception of 
Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where price 
increases are likely to accelerate from a low level, reflecting higher energy 
prices, price liberalisations and one-off tax measures. In Turkey, fiscal 

discipline and a monetary policy 
geared towards 
price stability are 
expected to bring down inflation to cl
ose to 6% by 2007. In the Former 
Acceding and Candidate Countries 
10OverviewYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in Croatia, higher prices for energy 
and commodities as well as price lib
eralisations will lead to inflation rates 
of about 2% and 3½% by 2007. In the case of the two acceding countries, 

inflation will rise in 20
06, due to high
er energy prices, but d
ecline in 2007.  
Unemployment is likely to decline in
 all five countries. Based on strong 
output growth, job creation will accelerate in the candidate countries: in 
Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia employment will 
increase by about 1¼-1½% in 2007. In
 Turkey, employment growth is 
likely to be somewhat stronger, increasing from 1¼ % in 2005 to about 2% 
in 2007. Unemployment
 will decline during 2006-07
 by about 1 percentage 
point in Croatia, by 2 percentage poi
nts in the Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia and by ¼ percentage point in Turkey. In the two acceding 
countries, employment growth will remain limited, reflecting a declining 
labour force and productivity enhancing
 investment, dampening the job 
intensity of growth. Public finances still benefit from strong
 growth. The general government 
deficit is likely to improve in Croatia and in Turkey, while it should remain 
close to balance in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in 
Romania. In Bulgaria, the public sect
or will continue to register a surplus, 
which is projected to rise to 3% of GDP 
in 2006 before declin
ing to 2% in 
2007. Turkey reported a government deficit of 1.3% of GDP in 2005, and 
strong growth is likely to keep the deficit low also over the forecast period. 
In Croatia, the deficit is likely to d
ecline from 3.9% of GDP in 2005 to 
3½% by 2007. The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of M
acedonia registered a surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2005, whi
ch in view of high public investment 
needs might deteriorate slightly during the forecasting period.  
Current account deficits have been widening in most countries, reflecting 
strong domestic demand and rising energy prices. The exception is the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of
 Macedonia, where steel exports and 
workers' remittances led to a sharp improvement in the current account 
balance in 2005. Curren
t account imbalances are likely 
to remain high over 
the forecast horizon, largely financed by transfers, FDI and other capital 

inflows. 11Chapter 1 The world economy 1. World growth broadening while 
remaining robust The world economy continued its robust expansion 
last year. Despite the impact of higher oil prices and 
the ongoing tighteni
ng of monetary policies, it is 
projected to continue to
 grow by around 4½% in 
2006, with global growth be
coming less reliant on the 
United States. This is slightly stro
nger than projected 
in the autumn forecast, mainly reflecting upward 
revisions to the growth forecast for Asia, including 
Japan and China. Oil prices are expected to remain 

high in view 
of still-strong demand growth, ongoing 
supply concerns and the current very low level of 
excess supply capacity. Risks to the outlook remain, 

in particular related to high and volatile oil prices and 
the global current account imbalances. Furthermore, 
the lagged impact of the tightening of monetary policy 

could have a greater-tha
n-expected impact on 
financial markets, which in
 particular could have 
implications for housing 
markets and bond-spreads. 
Growth momentum remains strong 
World growth is estimated to have reached around 
4½% in 2005. Although down from the very strong 
growth rate of 5.1% in 2004, this was still robust, in 
view of the oil price hike
 and the trend towards 
monetary policy tightening.

Growth in world trade also picked up again over the 
course of 2005, to around 6
% on average for the 
year as a whole, while world trade in the last quarter 
of 2005 was up by 8.3% co
mpared to the previous 
year. The buoyancy in th
e world economy is also 
evident in global indicato
rs. Following a slowdown in 
early 2005, the global manufacturing Purchasing 
Managers Index (PMI) has been on an upward trend 
since May last year. The services industry also 
continues to exhibit fairly 
strong momentum, with the 
global services PMI, which remained significantly 
above the 50 thresho
ld signifying expansion 
throughout last year, seemingl
y gaining momentum. 
All in all, momentum in 
the world economy is quite 
strong, despite some downside risks.
Oil prices set to remain high 
Oil prices have recently seen renewed strong 
increases to new record levels for Brent crude oil 

around 75 USD/bl. in 
mid-April. Robust global 
demand growth, low excess
 capacity, disruptions to 
oil production in Nige
ria and geopolitical uncertainty surrounding Iran and Iraq are all factors behind the 
surge in prices.

Graph 1.2:
Oil prices (Brent) in USD and €
Oil prices are assumed to remain high over the 
forecast period, with the price of Brent assumed to 
average 68.9 USD/bl. in 2006 and 71 USD/bl. in 

2007, in line with the profile suggested by futures 
prices. This corresponds to an increase in the average 
annual price of 27.4% in 2006 and of 3.1% in 2007. 

The assumed level of oil prices is roughly 12% and 
18% higher for 2006 and 2007, respectively, than 
what was assumed in the autumn forecast.  
The high level of oil prices is underpinned by a 
rebound in global oil dema
nd growth, led by China 
and North America. According 
to the International 
Energy Agency (IEA) global oil demand is projected 

to grow by 1.8% in 2006, up
 from 1.3% in 2005.  
15Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 The low level of excess supply capacity of oil and 
refined products, and the long time it takes for new 
capacity to come on-stream, adds to the upward 

pressure on oil prices. Conti
nued uncertainties about 
the security of crude oil supply in a number of major 
oil-exporting countries also c
ontribute to this 
pressure. Recent unrest in Nigeria halted production 
of around 0.5 mb/d. (compared with a total world 
supply of around 85 mb/d
.). Furthermore, geopolitical 
tensions increase the uncertainty about oil supply 
from the Middle East, in 
particular Iran's nuclear 
program. In addition, recent falls in US petrol stocks, 

due to unplanned refinery outages and changes in 
environmental requirement
s, have added further 
pressure to petrol prices, with petrol prices recently 

increasing by more than prices for crude oil. 
The higher price of oil acts as an income transfer from 
the oil importing to the oil exporting regions. 
However, so far the global economy seems to have 

coped well with the strong increase in oil prices, with 
world growth still robust and inflationary pressures 
well-contained in most regions. Nevertheless, the 
recent increase in oil prices is likely to have a slight 
dampening effect on growth in the importing regions 

and there could still be some additional effects in 
store from past increases. Indirect effects on inflation, 
as firms adjust prices to reflect higher input costs of 

production, and second-round effects through higher 
wage demands have been subdued so far but could 
still surface, with implications for inflation and 

monetary policy. 
Given the rise in oil pr
ices, the major oil-exporting 
countries have experienced strong increases in their 
current account surplus. To a large extent these 

surpluses have been recycled in the form of increased 
financial holdings an
d direct investment, mainly into 
US dollar-denominated assets. In addition, these 

countries have seen strongl
y growing imports which 
significantly benefit the European Union, because of 
its relatively large export share to these countries. In 

2005, goods expor
ts to OPEC and 
CIS countries grew 
in value by 18% and 22%, respectively, while export 
values to the rest of the world only increased by 6½%. 
However, import values from OPEC rose by more 
than 40%, in line with the oil price increase expressed 
in euro. As a result, 
three-quarters of the deterioration 
of the EU trade balance between 2004 and 2005 is due 
to thebilateral trade balan
ces with OPEC and CIS. 
Financial market conditions remain growth 
supportive 
Despite the ongoing tight
ening phase of monetary 
policy, monetary and financial conditions continue to 

be growth supportive. 
The US Federal Reserve continued its gradual 
tightening of monetary conditions, which began in 
mid-2004, by hiking its po
licy rate by 25 basis points 
at each of the last 15 consecutive FOMC meetings, 
bringing the target rate to 4.75 percent in March 2006. 
The Bank of Japan recently brought the quantitative 
easing to an end, the first step to a less expansionary 
monetary policy, but the zero interest rate policy 
remains in place. The European Central Bank has 

increased interest rates twice since the end of last 
year, bringing its main policy rate from 2 percent to 
2.5 percent. Despite these two rate hikes, both 

nominal and real interest rates remain at low levels. 
Long-term bond yields have recently increased, in line 
with the positive outlook fo
r growth, implying a 
degree of normalisation from the very low term 
premiums observed in 
2005. Nevertheless, US long 
term interest rates are still at low levels relative to 

short term interest rates, sugg
esting that upside risks 
to long-term interest rates remain.

The so-called "carry trade", with investors borrowing 
in low-yield countries and investing the proceeds in 
higher-yield assets, has c
ontributed to very low yield 
spreads on emerging market bonds and corporate 
bonds, indicating reduced risk sensitivity of investors 
in a situation of high 
global liquidity growth.  
16Chapter 1 The world economy 
These low yield spreads are conducive to continued 
strong momentum in the world economy, but also 
pose a risk when the li
quidity growth in the 
international financial system decelerates. Recent 
episodes, with slides in the currencies of Iceland and 
New Zealand, highlight the risks associated with the 

gradual unwinding of the carry trade. Furthermore, 
uncertainty related to global 
currency adjustments in 
view of the growing global current account 

imbalances could also pose
 some risk to financial 
markets in case of abrupt swings in exchange rates.

Following the appreciation of th
e US dollar in 2005 
on the back of risi
ng short-term interest rates, the 
major currencies have so far been relatively stable in 

2006, with movements in
 the dollar exchange rate 
mainly driven by interest rate expectations and 
interest rate differential expectations
 vis-à-vis the euro 
area, as well as the size of the US trade deficit.  
The Chinese exchange rate regime has remained close 
to a dollar peg despite the repl
acement in July 2005 of 
the 11-year old peg against the US dollar by a 
managed floating exchange rate regime. Since the 2.1 
percent appreciation in July 2005, the Chinese 

currency has only gained 1% against the US dollar. 
The 10% real effective appreciation recorded in 2005 
largely reflects the appreciation of the US dollar 

against other currencies. 
Stock markets have also benefite
d from strong global 
growth and easy financ
ing conditions, with firms 
having achieved strong growth in profits. The 

Japanese equity market, in particular, has benefited 
from the improved outlook, with the Japanese Nikkei 
index posting an increase of about 40% during 2005, 
while the European stock market (as measured by the 

Eurostoxx index) was up by about 20% at the end of 
2005. Since the beginning of 
2006, the Eurostoxx and Nikkei indices have increased by about 8%, while the 
US markets increased by some 5%.

Outlook by region 
Theglobal economy 
is expected to continue to 
expand at a solid pace over the forecast period. After 
growing by 4½% in 2005, growth is forecast to 
remain at that level in 
2006 and to moderate only 
slightly to 4.3% in 2007. Th
is implies a slight upward 
revision compared to the Autumn 2005 forecast, 
mainly reflecting upward revisions to the growth 

forecast for Asia, including Japan and China. Buoyant 
global growth over the foreca
st period is coupled with 
an acceleration in world trade, from an annual rate of 
6% in 2005 to 7-8% in
 2006 and 2007. 
Global 
imbalances are likely to widen 
further, with the US 
current account deficit expected to reach over 900 
billion US dollar in 2006 and
 2007, close to 7% of US 
GDP. Oil-exporting countries and China represent an 

increasing share of the 
corresponding surpluses. World growth is still being helped by the strength of 
the USeconomy, which expanded by 3.5% in 2005, 
based on continued buoyant consumer spending and 

relatively strong investme
nt growth. The current 
momentum is expected to continue through the first 
half of 2006, before slowing down in response to 

rising interest rates and 
a downturn in the housing 
17Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 market. Declining residential investment and 
decelerating consumer spending should be 
particularly instrumental in
 the expected slowdown. 
The forecast for annual GDP growth remains 
unchanged at 3.2% for 2006 and 2.7% for 2007. 
TheCanadian
 economy expanded by
 2.9% in 2005 
and continues to operate clo
se to its full production 
capacity and has generally benefited from a positive 
terms-of-trade shock from sharply higher energy and 
commodity prices. Going forward, the Canadian 

economy is set to continu
e to expand around its long-
term potential growth rate, with
 some softening of 
domestic demand offset by the external sector, 

resulting in GDP growth of 3.2% this year and 2.7% 
in 2007. Japan’s economic expansion is broadening beyond 
the export-related sector. In 2005 as a whole, Japanese 

GDP growth reached a fi
ve-year-high of 2.7%, 
somewhat higher than the autumn forecast and faster 
than the 2.3% recorded in 2004. The main engine of 

growth was private domestic demand, including both 
household consumption and business investment, but 
net exports also contribu
ted significantly. Although risks remain, in particular on
 the external side, the 
Japanese economy is expected to
 continue expanding 
at a rate of around 2.8% in 2006 and 2.4% in 2007. 
The global economic environment should remain 
supportive of Japanese 
growth, while domestic 
demand should maintain its current momentum.  
China's GDP was revised upwards in December 
2005, mainly due to an upward
 revision of the size of 
the service sector. GDP grow
th in 2005 is now 
estimated at 9.9%, only slig
htly lower than 
the 10.1% growth rate estimated for 2004. The very robust 
growth was underpinned 
by still-elevated investment 
spending and surging net ex
ports. The surge in the 
trade surplus reflected a sharp deceleration of import 
growth. However, the growth contribution from 

external trade diminished towards the end of 2005, in 
the context of a 10% real effective appreciation of the 
renminbi in the cour
se of 2005. Consumption 
continued to grow at a heal
thy pace, underpinned by 
strong income growth in both urban and rural areas.  
GDP growth is expected to m
oderate somewhat to an 
average of about 9.5% in 20
06, before further slowing 
to about 9% in 2007. This is above what was forecast 
in autumn due to th
e statistical revision. The 
deceleration should mainly come from a reduction of 
net export growth, against the background of slowing 
US growth and a gradually appreciating currency, 
with domestic demand gradually becoming a more 
important driver for growth. 
Economic growth in 
non-Japan Asia 
as a whole 
ended 2005 strongly, reaching 7.9%, almost equalling 
the outcome of 2004. Over the forecast period, growth 
is expected to moderate to 7.7% and 7.5% in 2006 and 

2007 respectively. This is 
in line with slightly 
decelerating global growth and, in particular, an 
expected gradual moderation of growth in China, as 

well as the deceleration in the US economy. 
For the 
accession and candidate
 countries strong 
output growth of around 4-5% annually and 
significant trade deficits are likely to remain key 

features, driven by strong domestic demand. 
Significant FDI inflows facilitate the financing of the 
current account deficits. Inflationary pressures and 

public finances are likely to remain under control. 
Growth has also been fairly r
obust in other European 
countries. The Norwegian
 economy continued to 
grow at a rapid pace in 2005, supported by 
expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, as well as 
increased investment in the petroleum sector 

encouraged by high oil prices. A modest deceleration 
is expected over the forecast period, with GDP growth 
projected to reach 2.5% in 2006 and 2.0% in 2007. 

TheSwisseconomy grew more than expected in the 
second half of 2005, supported by higher consumer 
spending and continued growth in exports. Healthy 

growth in private consumption and export growth 
supported by the external
 environment should see 
GDP growth reaching 1.8% in 2006 and 2.2% in 

2007. In 2005, GDP in 
Russiaincreased by 6.4%, below the 
figures of the preceding years, when growth exceeded 
7%. The slowdown reflects a negative contribution to 

growth from the external sector, despite the rise in 
energy prices, while growth in domestic demand 
remained robust, regarding both consumption and 

investment. The trade and the current account 
surpluses increased further
, on the back of further 
improvements of the terms of trade and despite a 
much faster increase in import volumes. Russia’s 
current account surplus in 2005 exceeded 10% of 

GDP, for the second year in 
a row. In 2006 and 2007, 
the current trends are expected to continue, i.e. growth 
should remain robust 
at around 6%, reflecting the 
continued strength of domestic demand, fuelled by the 
increase in disposable income and fiscal easing. 
18Chapter 1 The world economy 
Economic growth in the 
other CIS countries
slowed 
down from an estimated 11% in 2004 to just over 7% 
in 2005, exclusively reflecting 
Ukraine
’s hard 
landing – to 2.4% growth in 2005 after 12.1% a year 
before. This follows a neg
ative terms of trade shock 
that halved the current account surplus and sluggish 

investment under an uncert
ain policy environment. 
Growth in 2006 is expected to remain similar to that 
of 2005 and to accelerate to only 3.5% in 2007. The 

most impressive growth performance in the region in 
2005 was registered by the resource-rich 
Azerbaijan
with GDP growth of around 24%, which is not 

expected to slow down before 2008. Most other 
countries of the region are set to experience GDP 
growth rates of 5 to 8%. Overall, the CIS is the 

second fastest growing region
 in the world, behind 
East Asia.Economic growth in 
Latin America 
remained strong 
at around 4¼% in 2005, al
though somewhat lower 
compared to the rapid expansion of 2004. The growth 
deceleration was more marked in Brazil and, to a 
lesser extent, Mexico. By contrast, growth in 
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela has 
kept up unexpectedly well. Wi
th external conditions 
remaining favourable (strong
 global demand, high 
commodity prices and benign
 financing conditions), 
growth in the region is expected to remain around 4% 
over the forecast period. 
Growth in the 
MENA region (Middle East and North 
Africa) was strong in 2005 at 5.4%, but is projected to 

decrease slightly during the forecast period, with real 
GDP growth rates of 5.2% and 5.0% in 2006 and 
2007, respectively. The region’s oil export volume is 

projected to grow at 2-4% annually during the 
forecast period (assuming that high oil demand and 
prices will allow OPEC quotas no
t to be tightened), 
and non-oil export growth 
should remain strong for 
most countries. 
In 2005, real GDP growth in 
sub-Saharan Africa
was about 5%, up from 4.6% in 2004. In many 

African countries investment remained strong, 
supported by macroeconomi
c stability and an increase 
in development aid. These trends are expected to 

strengthen in 2006, especially in South Africa and oil 
producing countries, so that growth could accelerate 
to 6%. While growth should mainly be based on 

strong domestic demand,
 exports will also expand 
further, in particular fo
r oil and other primary 
commodities. However, higher imports are expected 
to limit the growth con
tribution from net exports.

19Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 1. Recovery in progress 
GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 influenced by 
technical factors …. 
After a subdued performance in the first half of 2005, 
with quarter-on-quarter GDP growth of about 0.4% in 

both the euro area and the EU, the pace of expansion 
in economic activity accelerated to 0.7%, above 
potential, in the third quart
er. The outturn largely 
reflected a significant 
strengthening of 
activity in the 
two largest euro area economies, Germany and 
France. 
In the fourth quarter the reg
ion continued to benefit 
from a supportive economic environment, including 
strong growth in world output and trade, a further 
improvement in the co
mpetitive position as measured 
by the real effective exchange rate, a moderation in oil 
prices and a broadly supportive macroeconomic 
policy mix. Under these conditions, the weakening of 

GDP growth to just 0.3% in the last quarter of 2005 in 
the euro area surprised on the downside. At the same 
time, growth in the pre
vious quarters of 2005 was 
revised upwards, resulting in an annual rate of 1.3% 
for the year 2005 as a whole in the euro area (1.6% in 
the EU), as projected in the autumn forecast. 
However, as a consequence of the changed quarterly 
profile, the carryover to 2
006 was slightly reduced.

Composition of growth in 2005 - Euro area
(Quarter-on-quarter % ch.)
(Contributions in pp.)
The slowdown of econom
ic activity between the third 
and the fourth quarter should not be overstated. As 
GDP growth accelerated to an annualised pace of 
2.7% in the third qu
arter, some correction in the 
following quarter was to be 
expected. In addition, GDP figures may have been influenced by statistical 

distortions as working-day
 adjustments procedures 
were faced with exceptionally strong variations in 
working days in the last two quarters in some large 

euro area countries. Assessing the deceleration of 
GDP growth was further complicated by the 
heterogeneity of the growth per
formance of individual 
Member States, with the weakening of economic 
activity in some large euro area economies dampening 
the outcome for the regi
on as a whole. All in all, a 
large part of the fluctuation
s in economic activity in 
the second half of 2005 wa
s of a technical nature and, 
as such, not pa
rticularly worrying. ….with the underlying growth momentum in 2005 acceleratingIn fact, disregarding th
e volatility of quarter-on-
quarter fluctuations in econom
ic activity and looking 
at the underlying growth 
momentum, the picture was 
more encouraging. On a year-on-year basis, the rate of 
expansion in economic activity continued to improve 
during 2005. In the euro area, GDP growth rose from 
1.2% in the first half of the year to 1.6% in the third 
quarter, edging up further to 1.8% in the fourth 

quarter. Similarly, in the EU economic activity 
accelerated from around 1.5% in the first half of 2005 
to 1.9% in the second. Against 
the background of an 
increase in oil prices by almost 45% in euro terms in 
2005, the economic performance of the region was 
positive.  Another sign confirming 
the strengthening of the 
growth momentum in the euro area in the second half 
of 2005 was the continuous and marked improvement 
in business survey data.
 The European Commission's 
economic sentiment i
ndex, which summarises 
business and consumer confidence, has risen almost 
uninterruptedly since mid-200
5. Key business survey 
indicators such as the European Commission's 
industrial confidence and business climate indicators 
and the PMI for manufacturing activity in the euro 
area have improved steadily. 
Survey data have also 
been pointing to improv
ed conditions 
in the services 
sector, even though the recovery in the survey data 
has so far been more muted than in manufacturing. 
23Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 Encouraging signals from investment spending…. 
When compared with the average performance of 
output during the past four recoveries, the expansion 
of economic activity in th
e euro area has remained 
more subdued during the curre
nt cycle, which started 
in mid-2003. This was largely the result of weaker 
investment and consumption growth compared with 

previous upswings.

Graph 2.1: 
Investment and consumption during the 
                   current and past recoveries
 In particular, investment 
seemed to be constrained by 
sluggish domestic demand, low labour productivity 
growth and a financial ov
er-extension during the 
boom years before 2001. However, since the second 

quarter of 2005, euro area corporatio
ns have adjusted 
their spending plans upwards. After limited growth of 
0.3% in the first quarter of 2005, growth in 

investment accelerated to above 1% in the second and 
third quarter. While th
e fourth quarter saw a 
slowdown, the underlyi
ng momentum remained 
healthy, as confirmed by the acceleration of the 
annual growth rate from 1.7% in the first quarter to 
2.7% in the fourth quarter. Moreover, growth in bank 
loans to companies expanded by almost 8% in the 
fourth quarter compared to 5.
9% in the first, which is 
another indication of the renewed vigour in 
investment expenditure by 
firms. For the year as a 
whole, capital spending rose by 2.2% in 2005 in the 

euro area (2.9% in the EU) and the outlook is for a 
marked increase this year. 
….with improving, but still weak consumption… 
In contrast to investment, recent developments in 
consumer spending have 
been less encouraging. 
Following a moderate, although steady improvement 
in the first three quarters of 2005, private 
consumption remained almost unchanged in the fourth 
quarter in the euro area, resultin
g in an estimated 
annual growth rate of 1.3% in 
2005 (1.5% in the EU). 
The weakening of private consumption in the last part 

of 2005 is at odds with developments in consumer 
surveys. After the temporary 
dip during the first half 
of 2005, consumer conf
idence has shown signs of 
improvement since summer 2005. The strengthening 
of consumer confidence largely reflected improved 
expectations about economic growth and reduced 

concerns about unemployment. Notwithstanding the 
positive effect of confiden
ce on consumption, 
developments in income and, more critically, the 

labour market are key for 
the recovery of household 
spending and the solidity of the rebound of economic 
activity in the euro area. 
….held back by low income growth … 
In this regard, the weakness of private consumption in 
2005 mirrored the lacklustre performance of 
disposable income, 
which is the main
 determinant of 
household spending. In fact, real gross disposable 
income is estimated to grow 
at just 1% in 2005 in the 
euro area, the lowest expansion in this decade and 

below the growth rate of consumption. Significant 
cross-country differences were observed in the 
dynamics of income in 2005. Among the largest euro 

area Member States, income growth was buoyant in 
Spain and France but much weaker in Germany and 
Italy and negative in the Netherlands, thus dampening 

the overall outcome for the euro area.

 24Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
As a result of income gr
owing more slowly than 
consumption, the household saving ratio is estimated 
to have declined from a level of around 15% in 2002-

2004 to about 14.5% in 2005. However, due to 
adverse developments in the saving ratio in some euro 
area Member States, there has been very little 

consumption smoothing in the euro area in this cycle. 
The saving ratio rose during the period of strong 
growth (2000-2001) and 
stabilised during the 
downturn which followed. Concerns about the 
sustainability of pub
lic pension and healthcare 
systems are likely to have 
kept the saving ratio high 
and have more than of
fset the downward pressure on 
saving exerted by EMU via lower interest rates and 
financial liberalisation. Structural reforms 

implemented in several Member States are starting to 
have a positive effect on agents' confidence, thereby 
affecting consumption and saving in a growth-

supportive way. 
Subdued growth in d
isposable income in 2005 
stemmed from moderate wage growth and a still weak 
employment performance. Wage indicators have 
continued to increase at a very moderate pace. The 
annual growth rate of nominal compensation of 

employees per head is estimated at 1.9% in 2005, 
down from 2.4% and 2.6% in 2004 and 2003, 
respectively. In real terms, wages are estimated to 

have remained unchanged compared with an average 
growth of 0.5% in the previous two years. Following 
the delayed impact of rising oil prices, consumer 

spending suffered from the increase in headline 
inflation from 2% to 2.3% between the first and the 
second half of the year, which reduced households' 

real wages and purchasing power.  
When assessing the outlook for consumption, 
however, it is important to bear in mind that 
employment is a more significant determinant of 

consumer spending than wages in the euro area. In 
this respect, it is encouragin
g to note that there was 
some improvement, albe
it limited, in the labour 
market during 2005. Employment growth accelerated 
from 0.1% (quarter-on-quarter) in the first quarter to 
0.3% in the third and th
e unemployment rate fell from 
8.8% to 8.3% in the final part of the year. 
Although wealth effects are generally estimated to be 
low in the euro area as a whole, consumption in some 

Member States has benefited from strong house price 
dynamics and the rise in fin
ancial wealth in 
2005. The euro area stock market index
 rose by almost 20% last 
year and house prices in countries like Spain and 
France went up by around 15% and 11%, 
respectively. However, set 
against a combination of 
ample liquidity and strong growth in household loans 
(up by 11.7% in 2005) boosted by historically low 

interest rates, developments of property markets in an 
environment of rising inte
rest rates generate concerns 
about their sustainability and 
the possible adverse 
effects on consumption and investment in some parts 
of the euro area.  
…and perhaps some changes in the distribution of 
incomeWhile changes in consum
ption are largely the result 
of changes in disposable in
come, the distribution of 
income can also affect consumption as the propensity 
to consume out of different sources of income may 

vary. In the euro area, the share of wages and salaries 
declined from 57% of total 
disposable income in 2001 
to less than 56% in
 2005, while the sh
are of the gross operating surplus and net property income taken 
together remained mo
re stable. Net re-distribution 
effects between the govern
ment and the household 
sector, mostly current taxes on income and wealth, 
social contributions and bene
fits, rose from about 3% 
of disposable income in 2001 to 4.5% in 2005.

employment and wage growth in Germany. 
Upbeat exports and imports but competitiveness 
varies greatly across Member States…. 
After contracting in the fi
rst quarter of 2005, export 
growth accelerated in the following two quarters 
before weakening substan
tially in the last quarter of 
the year. A similar volatile pattern was observed for 

imports. A statistical adjustment after strong export 
and import growth in the third quarter was expected. 
Furthermore, as exports include intra-euro area trade 

data, the slowdown in the fourth quarter may partly 
reflect weak output growth. The parallel, albeit less 
pronounced deceleration of import growth supports 

this observation. Disreg
arding the volatility of short-
term trade data, the growth 
momentum for trade was 
sustained. The year-on-year rate of the change in 

exports increased from 3.5% 
in the first quarter to 
4.9% in the last quarter of 2005, while import growth 
strengthened from 4.5% to 5.2% in the same period. 

For the year as a whole, net foreign demand is 
estimated to have subtract
ed about 0.2 pp from GDP 
growth as import growth (4.8%) outpaced export 
growth (3.9%).  
Given the weakness of private consumption, the 
strength of imports in 20
05 is likely to reflect the 
pick-up in capital spending
. As regards exports, their 
acceleration owed much to the strong evolution of 
global growth since mid-20
05. In addition, exports 
appear to have benefited from the gradual 
depreciation of the euro since early 2005. Measured 
by REER (nominal effective exchange rate deflated 

by unit labour costs), the ex
ternal competitiveness of 
the euro area relative to the rest of the 35 most 
industrialised coun
tries improved in 2005 with an 
estimated gain of almost 
3%. However, at the country 
level, performance varied
 greatly with Germany 
seeing a further improvement – above the euro area 

average – of its competitiv
e position. Competitiveness 
also improved in the Netherlands. On the other hand, 
competitiveness was broadly stable 
in 2005 in Spain, 
Italy and Portugal. Howev
er, these three countries experienced considerable losses in market shares, due 

mainly to a past deterioration in
 cost competitiveness.    
….and growth dispersion remained wide  
Divergence in GDP growth within the euro area 
declined somewhat in the course of last year but 
remained wide. The gap in growth performance was 

particularly noticeable between the four largest 
member States. In the first quar
ter of 2005, there was 
a 1.2 pps difference between the best- and the worst-

performing country (Spain and Italy respectively). By 
the last quarter of the year, the difference had reduced 
to 0.9 pp, with Spain reg
istering a robust 0.9%

ile economic activity 
was flat in Germany and Italy.

.Outside the euro area, most of the recently acceded 
Member States continued to show a strong growth 
performance in 2005. This 
was particularly the case in the Baltic countries, which registered annual growth 
rates in the range of 7½-10%. Among the larger 
economies, the highest GDP growth was observed in 

the Czech Republic (6%), followed by Hungary 
(4.1%) and Poland (3.2%). Among other non-euro

growth reached 3.1% in Denmark and 2.7% in

weakening of consumer 
spending compared with the previous year reduced 
growth to 1.8%. 
26Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
Box 2.1:
 Some specificities about the forecast
Exchange rates 
For currencies in ERM II as well as for Bulgaria, constant 
nominal exchange rates are assumed. This means that the 
central rate of these currencies against the euro will remain 
constant over the forecast period. The ERM currencies are: 
the DKK (Danish krone), the EEK (Estonian kroon), the 
CYP (Cyprus pound), the LVL (Latvian lats), the LTL 
(Lithuanian litas), the MTL (Maltese lira), the SIT 
(Slovenian tolar) and the SKK (Slovakian koruna). Constant 
real effective exchange rates (that is nominal rates adjusted 
for changes in GDP deflators) are assumed for the all the 
other countries / areas, i.e. the euro, CZK (Czech koruna), 
the HUF (Hungarian forint), the PLN (Polish zloty), the SEK 
(Swedish krona), the GBP (sterling) and for the non-EU 
currencies.The reference period used for the exchange rate constancy 
assumption is the second quarter of 2006, calculated on the 
basis of historical values up to 3 April and the average of a 
two-week reference period (4 to 18 April) for the remainder 
of the quarter. This technical assumption yields the average 
USD/EUR rate 1.22 and the average JPY/EUR rate 143.8 for 
the second quarter.  This, in turn, leads to an implied average 
USD/EUR rates of 1.22 in 2006 and 2007, and average 
JPY/EUR rates of 142.4 in 2006 and 141.1 in 2007.  
Interest rates 
Short-term interest rates are set in order to reflect the price 
stability objective of monetary policy.  Long-term interest 
rate assumptions are based on developments in short-term 
rates and an assessment of economic conditions.  Attention is 
paid to international financial linkages, market expectations 
and budgetary developments. 
Commodity prices 
Commodity prices are forecas
t taking into account market 
conditions. In the case of oil prices special attention is paid 
to futures prices. Prices for Brent oil are, accordingly, 
projected to be 68.9 USD/bl in 2006 and 71.0 USD/bl in 
2007. Prices of primary commodities, excluding fuels, are 
assumed to increase by 16.8% in 2006, and to increase by 
0.7% in 2007.  In 2006, the prices of all groups are expected 
to increase, except for wood and pulp. 
Chain linking In order to improve the accuracy of GDP growth estimates, 
National Accounts have moved to ‘chain linking’ in several 
Member States to incorporate more up-to-date price weights. 
Chain-linking uses previous year’s prices (instead of prices 
from a given base year) which are then ‘chained’ together.  
Forecasts for 12 Member States 
(namely CZ, DE, ES, FR, 
IE, IT, LT, AT, PL, PT, SI and SK) have been made using 
the new volume measure. 
Budgetary data Data for 2005 are based on government debt and deficit data 
transmitted by Member States to the European Commission 
in April 2006. In publishing these data, Eurostat maintained 
its reservation concerning the quality of the reported data in 
Greece. Eurostat also questioned the treatment of the 
assumption of the debt of the railway company by the 
Belgian government in 2005. For 2006, budgets adopted or 
presented to parliaments and all other measures known in 
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. For 2007, the 
"no policy change" assumption used in the forecasts implies 
the extrapolation of revenue and expenditure trends and the 
inclusion of measures that are known in sufficient detail. 
The general government balances reported by Member States 
to the Commission in the context of the excessive deficit 
procedure (EDP) may be slightly different from those 
published in the national accounts. According to Regulation 
(EC) N° 2558/2001 on the reclassification of settlements 
under swaps agreements and forward rate agreements, 
interest flows under swaps have been reclassified from 
“income property” to “financial account”. However, the 
same regulation also states the need for specific treatment of 
these flows for data transmitted under EDP, allowing for interest expenditure to include swaps, contrary to ESA95 
new rules. The forecasts present the general government 
balance using the EDP definition. 
Calendar effects on GDP
 growth and output gaps 
The number of working days may differ from one year to 
another. For example, 2004 was a leap year with 2.8 
additional working days compared to the average number of 
working days. This translated to an estimated impact of 0.24 
pp on the GDP growth rate for the euro area. On the other 
hand, for 2005, the effect was negative, yielding an impact of 
-0.13 pp. For 2006, the impact is 
estimated at -0.1 pp.  
Annual GDP figures are not adjusted for the number of 
working days, while mostly quarterly figures are. The 
calculation of potential growth and the output gap does not 
involve any adjustment for working days. Since it is 
considered temporary, it should not affect the cyclically-
adjusted balances. 
272. The private non-financial sector: 
funding environment and balance sheets The pick-up in economic activity in the euro area – 
with more investment and consumption - is taking 
place hand in hand with gradually rising interest rates. 

As a result, the period of
 exceptionally low-cost 
funding through loans is coming to an end, although 
the private sector financing environment remains 

favourable when viewed from a longer time horizon. 
This section focuses on financing conditions for 
corporates and households – and particularly the 

evolution of their balance sheets – as the main 
channels through which real-sector and financial-
sector activity are linked.  
The corporate sector 
The euro-area corporate sector continues to recover 
from significant balance-she
et problems. A surge in 
debt-financed investment in the late 1990s and the 
bursting of the equity mark
et bubble in 2000 left in 
their wake an elevated level of corporate debt. While 
the highly pro-cyclical debt-to-equity ratio has 
declined since its peak in
 2003, the debt-to-GDP ratio 
remains close to 60%.

Note: debt includes loans and non-share securities
Yet a process of debt restructuring has allowed 
corporates to lower their debt burden. This has 
involved refinancing of ex
isting debt at lower interest 
rates and longer maturities. The share of long-term 

debt obligations (i.e. outstanding loans and debt 
securities issuance with maturity of more than one 
year) has risen from about 64% in 2001 to about 68% 

in 2005. Meanwhile the amount of net interest 
payments of the corporate sector to banks has 
declined from almost 1.75% of GDP in 2003 to 1.5% 

in 2005. The sector 
has also been accumulating 
substantial cash balances, amid
 a strong recovery in 
profitability. Inflows to corpo
rate bank deposits have 
been rising at record rates
1 in stark contrast to the 
period before 2000 when inflows fell to zero.

As a result, the corporate sector seems to be more 
comfortable with its current debt level, as shown by 

the rise in external financing demand. Overall net 
external funding growth rose to 4.1% year-on-year in 
the third quarter of 2005, up from 2.8% in the second. 

Expressed as a percentage of GDP, net external 
funding demand in the second and third quarter of 
2005 amounted to roughly 4½%

level when compared with the last 3 years. 
Underlying component data i
ndicate a continuation of 
that trend, with bank lending accelerating 
significantly on the back 
of easing bank lending 
conditions.  The household sector 
Household borrowing has been robust for a number of 
years and is accelerating. Owing to continuing 
favourable financing conditions - low bank interest 
rates and loosening credit 
conditions - loan growth 
exceeded 11% year-on-year for mortgage loans at the 
beginning of 2006, while consumer loan growth 
accelerated to 8% in the same period.

                   income ratios, euro area household sector 
In the face of rising house prices in some Member 
States, robust credit growth for house purchases is 
leading to a steady accumulation of household debt. 
High levels of indebted
ness can leave households 
vulnerable to negative shocks, e.g. adverse changes in 
interest rates, disposable income or the value of 
housing assets against which
 much of the debt is 
secured. Such shocks may lead to an abrupt re-
assessment by households of their desired exposure to 
debt.  Any subsequent period of balance-sheet 
consolidation is likely to
 hamper economic activity, 
mainly by way of reduced expenditures for 

consumption or a retrenchment in construction 
activity.  However, the euro area household balance sheet 
seems relatively robust. There is no evidence to 

suggest that households 
have borrowed substantially 
to consume or that the build-up of household debt has 
spurred a boom in
 residential constru
ction. The 
overall financial surplus 
– also called net financial 
position and defined as the difference between the 
acquisition of financial 
assets and the incurrence of 
financial liabilities of households – remains 
significantly positive. In a
ddition, the debt-to-financial asset ratio has ri
sen only moderately and 
debt-servicing costs have actua
lly been declining as a 
proportion of disposable income.

On the other hand, the aggregate position for the euro 
area hides considerable differences in household 
indebtedness across Member States. Debt ratios when 
measured against GDP are above 60% in 

Luxembourg, the Netherlan
ds, Ireland, Spain, 
Portugal and Germany. Compared with end-2002 they 
have increased by almost 30% of GDP in Ireland, 

about 20% in Spain, and roughly 15% in the 
Netherlands, Austria and Greece. In addition, data for 
the beginning of the year 20
06 indicate credit growth 
in excess of 25% per year for Greece, Spain and 
Ireland.  Several factors have contri
buted to differences in 
household indebtedness within the euro area since the 
mid-1990s. First, the adopti
on of the euro was 
associated with a very substantial downward 

convergence in interest rates and an increased access 
to external bank lending for several Member States 
(notably Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal). 

Second, above-average inflation rates in some 
Member States have lowered real interest rates, 
providing an additional boost to credit demand. This 

pro-cyclical effect of real interest rates may have been 
reinforced by the mutual interaction between real 
interest rates and house pr
ices (low real interest rates 
fuelled demand for housing, leading to a rise in  house 
prices   which  pushed  up  growth  and  inflation   via

wealth effects and further depressed real interest  
rates). Third, demographic developments have been 
more supportive of demand for housing and 
mortgages in some Member States than others due, 

for instance, to significant 
immigration flows (e.g. 
Ireland and Spain) or faster gr
owth of th
e population 
of  household formation age (e.g. Ireland, Spain, 
Netherlands and France). Fourth, the increase in 
household borrowing fo
r house purchase may reflect 
differences and changes in Member States' mortgage 
markets, which have offered households with 
expanded access to credit through (i) extended 

maturity of contracts, (ii) higher 
loan-to-value ratios, 
(iii) an increasing share of 
variable interest rate loans, and (iv) equity withdrawal
 possibilities in some 
Member States. In addition, mortgage bonds and debt 
securitisation allowed financing institutions to receive 
additional funding. 0510152025

                   Member States, February 2006
While the above factors explai
n the high level of 
household debt in some Member States, they do not 
necessarily reduce the exposure which is linked to it. 
While related risks are un
likely as long as economic 
growth – and by extens
ion household disposable 
income – continues to grow, the debt-servicing costs 
of households are set to 
increase as the interest cycle turns. The experience of 
the Netherlands is revealing in this context. There, an 
apparently autonomous 
response of households to high levels of debt, even in 
the absence of adverse shocks, has led to a protracted 

slowdown in economic growth. 
303. Temporary slowdown in 2007 - sound 
underlying growth momentum Acceleration of economic activity in 2006  
The deceleration in GDP growth in the fourth quarter 
of 2005 was unexpected and may have been due 
partly to the timing of holid
ays, which may have led 
to a statistical artefact in the quarterly growth figures 
in the second half of 2005 (see section 1). This could 
also be an explanation for the recent discrepancy 

between hard data, whi
ch provide rather mixed 
signals, and survey results
, which remain upbeat.  
The strength of survey data can be seen as an 
important signal of a more pronounced underlying 

pick-up in economic activity. Three arguments 
underpin this conclusion.  First, most survey results 
have reached their highest level in a long time: for 

example, the European Commission's economic 
sentiment indicators for the EU and the euro area are 
at their highest level in
 five years. Second, the 
improvement is not lim
ited to expectation variables, 
but is also apparent in indicators of current conditions. 
Finally, the improvement 
is broad-based across 
different sectors: a majo
rity of the European 
Commission's sector confidence indicators for the 
euro area are at their highest level for at least 3½ 
years.The forecast therefore expects a marked pick-up of 
growth in the first quarter of 
2006 to a rate at or above 
potential and this growth mo
mentum should be 
broadly maintained over the forecast period. The first 
quarter of 2007 is an excepti
on in this regard, with the 
growth rate falling clearly below potential. This 
temporary decline counterbalances the acceleration in 

the second half of 2006 and is
 explained by the impact 
of the planned budgetary policy measures in 
Germany, particularly the increase in the standard 

VAT rate by 3 percentage points on 1 January 2007 
(see also box 2.2). However, as the compound effect 
of the consolidation package over a period of two 

years is assessed to be broadly neutral, the projected 
slight slowdown in 2007 does not imply a weakening 
of the underlying growth momentum. 
The recovery in 2006 will be driven by a robust pick-
up in investment expenditu
re, while the upturn in 
consumption will be mo
re gradual. Although 
improving, the contribution to growth from the 

external sector will still be negative in 2006. The 
healthy outlook for domestic demand remains 
underpinned by a relatively accommodative 
macroeconomic policy stance. Fin
ancing conditions 
are set to deteriorate gradually, but this is not 
expected to have a signifi
cant impact on economic 
growth in 2006 and 2007, given the momentum of the

expected to grow by 5.4% in the euro area in 2006. In 

2007, the ongoing tightening of financing conditions 
will dampen somewhat equipme
nt investment to a 
(still very solid) rate of 
4.5%. Investment in 
residential construction is exp
ected to be particularly 
affected by the German VAT increase, with a surge in 
German housing investment in 2006 followed by a 

temporary drop in 2007. 
Growth in construction 
investment in the euro area would, as a result, 
accelerate to a rate of 3.4% in 2006 and slow down to 

0.7% in 2007. In accordance w
ith the projected profile of equipment and constructio
n investment, total euro-
area investment will grow by 4.2% in 2006 and by 
2.4% in 2007. The pr
ojected decline in total 
investment is smaller in the EU: from 4.4% in 2006 to 

3.1% in 2007.

Private consumption is projected to accelerate 
gradually in 2006, in line with improving labour 

market conditions and highe
r consumer confidence. In 
the EU, growth of private consumption is expected to 
reach 1.9% in 2006, up from 1.5% in the year before. 

Similarly, in the euro area private consumption is 
forecast to accelerate to 1.7%, from 1.3% the year 
before. In 2007, the annual growth rate of 

consumption will slow down sli
ghtly, to 1.5% in the 
EU and to 1.4% in the euro area. This decline is again 
mainly caused by developme
nts in Germany, where 
households are expected to br
ing forward a part of 
their consumption expenditure ahead of the VAT 
increase in 2007. This will boost growth of private 

consumption in Germany in
 2006, but as an echo-
effect lead to a fall in 2007.

32Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
Exports are projected to pick up in 2006 owing to 
continued strong external 
demand. Moreover, gains in 
competitiveness which result 
from the depreciation of 
the real effective exchange rate in 2005 and 2006 
should reduce market share losses. However, relative 
competitive positions have 
changed ma
rkedly in Europe in recent years. Gains have been made, for 
example, by Germany and Austria whilst 
competitiveness has d
eteriorated in Greece, Spain, 
Ireland, Italy and Portugal. The degree to which 
European exporters will reap the benefits of increased 
external demand will therefore vary. On average, 
export growth is projected to reach 5.9% in the EU 
and 5.4% in the euro area. In 2007
, export growth will 
be marginally lower, following
 a slight moderation of 
external demand. 
The contribution of the external side to output growth 
will remain negative in 200
6, but should turn positive 
in 2007. This is partly explain
ed by imports outpacing 
exports in 2006, wh
ile, in 2007, the 
annual growth 
rate of imports should 
decline in line with weaker 
final demand.  
33Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 Box 2.2:
 Recent budgetary measures in Germany are the main reason behind new profile
The change in the growth outlook for 2006 and 2007 in the 
euro area and the EU reflects, in particular, the marked 
revision of the German outlook. The latter is explained by 
the estimated impact of the new government's budgetary 
measures (as well as disappointing data from the last quarter 
of 2005). It does not, however, reflect an underlying 
acceleration and subsequent deceleration of economic 
activity in the euro area - nor in Germany.

Autumn 2005 (b )
The new German government's budgetary package will have 
a substantial impact on the growth profile in Germany and 
beyond. While the 2007 VAT increase is the most important 
policy measure in quantitative terms, other measures will 
also influence aggregate demand.  
For the assessment of the impact on growth, the simple shift 
in the timing of demand has to be distinguished from a 
change in the underlying trend. Concerning the shift in 
consumption, simple arithmetics suggests that carrying 
forward expenditure from 2007 to 2006 produces 
asymmetric effects on annual growth rates. While the 
positive effect in 2006 equals the amount of consumption 
brought forward, consumption in 2007 is expected not only 
to fall back to its baseline without the VAT increase in 2007, 
but to that level minus the consumption brought forward. 
Hence, the negative echo-effect in terms of growth rates is 
twice as strong in 2007 as the positive effect in 2006. 
However, once the negative echo-effect has run its course, a 
positive effect on the growth rate will return in 2008. Hence, 
the forecast period up to 2007 leaves aside part of the 
positive correction. The quantification of the carry-forward effect is particularly 
difficult. A VAT increase by 3 percentage points is without 
precedent. Also unique is the time span of more than a year 
between the announcement of the measure and its 
implementation. Therefore only rough indications of the 
likely effects can be gained from looking at previous VAT  
increases in Germany or other countries. In addition, as a 
VAT increase above a certain threshold might induce over-
proportional reactions by the private sector, the impact will 
not necessarily be linear. It is likely also to depend on the 
current position of the economy in the business cycle. 
In order to quantify the effect on private consumption, a 
bottom-up approach was used, calculating the impact on different consumption good categories. It was assumed that 
between 0% and 2% of average annual purchases in different 
categories will be brought forward to 2006, totalling around 
0.5% of overall annual private consumption expenditure. In 
addition, it is assumed that stronger growth in 2006 and the 
prospect of sustainable fiscal consolidation will lead to 
positive confidence effects on the part of households 
releasing some of the pent-up demand. About 2/3 of the 
contribution of private households to fiscal consolidation is 
assumed to be financed through a reduction in the saving rate 
and 1/3 through lower consumption. As with private 
consumption, the VAT increase will lead to a strong carry-
forward effect on housing construction. Therefore, private 
households will try to finish as much as possible of their 
housing investment before the end of 2006. This tendency is 

supported by increased building permits issued before the 
end of 2005, i.e. ahead of the abolition of favourable 
subsidies for owner-occupied housing investment. As 
housing represents more than 50% of construction 
investment, this time shift is clearly visible in the overall 
pattern of gross fixed capital formation over the forecast 
period.Corporate investment will be supported by the new 
government package, as depreciation rules were made more 
generous until end-2007. Against the background of some 
pent-up demand in recent years, increased capacity 
utilisation, an improved financial situation and higher profits 
as well as brighter business outlook, enterprises will use this 
opportunity to step up their investment in 2006 and 2007. So 
taking the different developments in investment components 
together, gross fixed capital formation should be 
exceptionally strong this year and stagnate at the higher level 
in 2007. However, the strong impact on GDP growth of changes in 
the timing of investment and consumption is substantially 
smoothed by inventories and external trade. Consequently, 
GDP growth will be boosted in 2006 by the fiscal package 
and temporarily dampened in 2007, but the swings are not as 
pronounced as for single demand components. Moreover, 
due to the strong resumption of growth in the course of 2007 
a significant recovery of the growth rate can be expected for 
2008.344. Continued modest employment growth 
Although labour markets function better… 
Both the euro-area and the EU labour markets proved 
more resilient in the economic 
slowdown in 2001-
2003. Even if labour mark
et conditions worsened with the usual lag to the economic cycle, employment 
growth never turned negative and the increase in the 
annual unemployment 
rate was limited to 1 
percentage point. Unemployme
nt peaked in this cycle 
at 8.9% in the second quarter of 2004.  
Structural reforms in both product and labour markets 
over the last 10 years are largely behind this improved 

performance in terms of lower long-term 
unemployment rates; shorter average duration of 
unemployment spells; impr
oved matching, and, 
recently, more employment-friendly wage 
developments. 
…employment growth has only started to pick up 
However, as a consequence of more pronounced 
labour hoarding in the economic downturn, 

employment growth has been unusually limited since 
the start of the current economic upswing in the 
middle of 2003. In a
ddition, the recovery has itself been weaker than previous ones, as evidenced by a 
slowdown in GDP growth from the third quarter of 

2004 to the second quar
ter of 2005, dampening 
demand for labour.  
Euro-area employment growt
h picked up gradually 
during the first three 
quarters of 2005 to 0.3% 
(quarter-on-quarter) in the third quarter.

The overall development of employment growth 
masks sizeable differences across Member States and 
across sectors. Amongst the larger euro-area Member 
States, job-creation has remained buoyant in Spain, 
whereas it has been markedly weaker in Italy and 
France. At the sectoral level, job creation has been 

driven by a sustained expans
ion in the services sector 
and, in particular, by 
finance and business services. 
The decline in employment in the industry sector 
appears to have ended in the course of 2005, while 
employment in the agricu
lture sector continued to fall.  Unemployment started to decline in 2005 
The standardised unemploy
ment rate stabilised at just 
below 9% of the labour force in
 2003-2004 in both the 
euro area and the EU. Th
is follows both from the 
moderate employment creation in the early phase of 

this economic upswing and remaining rigidities in 
several European labour mark
ets. Following 
the pick-up in employment in the course of 2005, aggregate 

unemployment finally 
started to decline. The 
unemployment rate in the euro area stood at 8.2% in 
February 2006, which is somew
hat more than ½ pp 
lower than in February 
2005. Similarly, the EU-wide 
unemployment rate has fallen 
by almost ½ pp over the 
last year to 8.5% in February 2006. 
Differences continue to be significant across Member 
States, with the unemployment rate in January 2006 
ranging from 4-5% of the labour force in Denmark, 
Ireland, the Netherlands and the United 
Kingdom to 
around 9% in Germany, 9½% in Greece and France 
and more than 15% 
in Slovakia and Poland.  
Employment expectations point to a further 
expansion (in the services sector) 
Looking ahead, employment 
expectations reported in 
the European Commission's business and consumer 
survey improved further in March. Even if the 

volatility of such monthl
y indicators suggests that 
they should be 
interpreted with caution
, it should be 
noted that the survey i
ndicators have generally been 
on a strong upward trend since the summer of 2005.  
Analysing the three-months moving average, 
employment expectations imp
roved in all sectors in 
the first quarter of 2006 
compared with the fourth 
quarter of last year. This would sup
port the hypothesis 
that the decline in GDP growth (from 0.7% quarter-
on-quarter in the third quarter to 0.3% in the fourth) is 

only temporary. The expectations suggest a further 
expansion of employment, at least in the services 
sector, whereas the outlook in industry presents a 
more mixed picture. Although the indicator has 
clearly improved, the balance remains negative 

pointing to a further deterio
ration of jobs in industry.

Employment and unemployment expactations

The forecast points to a continued, modest pick up 
in employment… In line with a strengthened
 economic recovery, 
employment growth is expected
 to improve, albeit 
modestly, to 0.9% in the 
euro area in 
2006 (up from 
0.7% last year). An even more marginal improvement 
is projected for the EU as a whole where employment 

is set to grow by 0.9% (0.8% in 2005).  
The spring forecast implies a downward revision of 
the employment outlook compared to the autumn 
2005 forecast, despite an upward revision of GDP 
growth by 0.2 pp. This may partly be explained by the 
temporary nature of 
the "boost" to private 
consumption and GDP growth in Germany (c.f. box 
2.2), which is the main factor behind the upward 
revision of the euro
-area and EU grow
th outlook.    
Since a number of specific factors, such as the 
regularisation of immigrant wo
rkers in Spain and 
Italy, explained part of
 the employment growth 
recorded for 2005 the underlying improvement in job 

creation in the euro area is more pronounced this year. 
On the other hand, th
e increasing importance of 
temporary jobs and part-tim
e employment (enhancing 
the flexibility de-facto) would limit the rise in 
employment measured in full-time equivalents. 
Employment growth is 
thereafter expected to stabilise 
at 0.8% in 2007 in 
both areas (and despite the 
temporary decline in eco
nomic activity in the euro 
area that follows from the impact of the German 
package). 
…and a limited decline in unemployment… 
Although employment is expected to grow by 1.2 
million persons in the euro area this year, the decline 
in unemployment will be limited to 0.1 million 

persons by the traditional influx of persons into the 
labour force when the labour market situation 
improves (and latent job-seek
ers return to the regular 
labour market in active search of employment). The 
unemployment rate is therefore expected to decline 
only modestly to 8.4% of the labour force in the euro 

area in 2006 and to 8.5% in
 the EU. For 2007, the 
gradual decline continues, with the unemployment 
rate projected at 8.2% in both the euro area and the 

EU.…which, in turn, help to contain wage pressures… 
Wage growth, as measured by compensation of 
employees per head, was to 
begin with relatively 
unaffected by the econom
ic slowdown in
 2001-2003. 
At the euro-area level, wage
 growth began to decline 
more markedly only in 2005 and is expected to 
stabilise around 2% over the forecast period, albeit 
with sizeable differences across Member States. In 
2006, wage growth is expected to range from about 

¼% in Germany to around 5-6% in Greece and 
Ireland. Wage growth seems to reflect local labour market 
conditions in most cases. Th
is would, for instance, 
explain wage increases of around 3% (or more) in 
Greece, Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg in view of 
their relatively high GDP- and employment growth 

(although it appears difficult 
to justify wage increases 
of 5-6% in Greece, with employment growing by 
1¼% a year). On the other
 hand, wage growth in 
France, and possibly also in Italy and Portugal, 
appears on the high 
side considering their relatively 
weak demand for labour.  
Reflecting the catching-up process in several of the 
recently-acceded Member States, average wage 
growth in the EU as a whole is higher than that of the 
euro area. It is estimated at 2¾% in both 2006 and 

2007. …even if some Member States have problems with 
their competitiveness 
Persistent and relatively high 
wage increases in some 
Member States have, where not matched by improved 
labour productivity, tak

competitiveness. Altho
ugh growth in nominal unit 
labour cost is set to decelerate to 0.9% in 2006 in the 
euro area and to 1.2% in the EU – it is estimated to 

remain above 2½% in Estonia, Greece, Spain, Ireland, 
Latvia and Lithuania.  
Overall, labour productivity growth is set to improve 
to 1.2% in the euro area (up from 0.7% last year) and 

to 1.4% in the EU (0.8%). This implies a sizeable 
upward revision of the euro area compared to the 
autumn forecast (+½ pp. in the euro area), reflecting a 

better-than-expected outcome 
in 2005 and a rebound 
after exceptionally low levels noted in several 
Member States last year. However, it should be noted 

that labour productivity growth remains limited at 
around ½% in Spain and 
Portugal in 2006. 
The Lisbon targets at risk The moderate employment gains
 in recent years have 
contributed to a gradual increase in the employment 

rate (defined as the share of employed persons aged 
15-64 in the total population of the same age group). 
The most recent outcome refers to 2004, when the 
employment rate rose to 63.3% in the EU. 
The estimated increase in employment is likely to 
contribute to a further increase to around 64% in 

2007. This would fall short 
of the intermediate target 
of 67% to be achieved by the end of 2005 as agreed 
by the European Councils in
 Lisbon and Stockholm. It 
would also make a further rise to 70%, to be achieved 
by the end of 2010, seem increasingly challenging. 
Differences continue to be marked across Member 
States, with four Member States having an 
employment rate above the EU threshold level already 
in 2004, see graph 2.14. At 
the other end, six Member 
States had an employment rate below 60% in 2004.

375. Inflation developments and outlook 
Headline inflation remained above 2% in 2005, 
pushed by surging energy prices… 
Largely because of marked increases in oil and energy 
prices, headline HICP inflation in 
both the EU and the 
euro area moved up again during 2005.  For the year 
as a whole, HICP inflation in both regions rose from 
2.1% in 2004 to 2.2% in 2005.  This was just below 

(0.1 pp) the estimate included in the autumn forecast, 
essentially due to oil prices moderating in autumn 
2005 by more than was assumed last November.  

Inflation in the euro area has now been somewhat 
above 2% in the euro area for six consecutive years. 
In terms of monthly data, 
headline HICP inflation in 
the euro area rose by 0.7 pp
 during the first nine 
months of the year, peaking at 2.6% (year-on-year) in 
September 2005.  Thereafter it eased continuously, 
benefiting from a moderation in oil prices and 

favourable base effects linked to past increases in 
administered prices and indirect taxes.  The decline 
was temporarily interrupted at th
e beginning of 2006, 
when a rebound in oil and
 energy prices led to a spike 
in inflation to 2.4% in
 January 2006.  Headline 
inflation has since eased to 2.2% in March 2006.

Headline and core inflation, euro area
yoy % ch.
The dominant influence of energy prices on inflation 
developments in the recent past can be readily 
illustrated.  Although the energy component accounts 
for only about 9% of the euro-area HICP basket, its 

contribution to overall inflation rose from around 
0.5 pp at the beginning of 2005 to close to or above 
1 pp. by early summer 2005, accounting for roughly 

half of the registered inflation rates thereafter.  
Double digit annual inflation in energy prices from 
the middle of 2005 onwards account for this. The rate 
stood at 10.5% in March 2006, down from 12.5% in 
the previous month.  To put the impact of energy 

prices into perspective, only services, which account 
for just over 40% of the HI
CP basket, added a roughly 
similar amount to inflation in 2005.  
In contrast to the developm
ents in headline inflation, 
euro-area core inflation (HICP excluding energy and 
unprocessed food) continued in 2005 on the 
downward path started in au
tumn 2004.  It declined 
by close to half a percentage 
point during the first half 
of the year, from 1.8% in January to 1.4% in June 
2005.  Since then, core in
flation has hovered around 
that level and, after two 
month at 1.3%, was back at 
1.4% in March 2006. 
The substantial gap that has opened between headline 
and core inflation in the euro area suggests that past 

oil price hikes have not been accompanied so far by 
significant indirect effects on the non-energy sub-
indices of HICP inflation.  In effect, annual inflation 

in the two largest com
ponents of core inflation - 
services and non-energy industrial goods - eased 
throughout 2005 to 
some of the lowest rates seen in 
the previous four years.  In March 2006 services 
inflation in the euro area was 1.9% (down from 2.0% 

in the previous month), 
while it was just 0.5% for 
non-energy industrial good
s (up from 0.3% in the 
previous month).  Similarly 
low inflation rates in non-
energy industrial goods ha
ve now been observed since 
the beginning of 2005.  This suggests that factors such 
as heightened competition in
 the tradable sector, due 
to increased globalisation, coupl
ed with ongoing wage moderation and subdued growth in domestic demand, 
are having a strong countervailing effect against the 

upward price pressures from 
rising energy prices.   
Outside the euro area, headline inflation also moved 
up in 2005 in several Member States, including the 
UK and Denmark, reflecting higher energy prices.  

Among the recently-acceded Member States, this was 
also the case in the Baltic 
countries and in Cyprus.  
However, in the countries of central Europe, headline 
inflation actually d
eclined compared with the previous 
year.  This appears to have been the result of 

increased import competition 
in industrial goods, 
regulatory reforms in net
work industries and a 
cushioning of inflation
ary pressures by currencies appreciating against the euro.   
38Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
…but with little signs thus far of significant 
second-round effects 
Pipeline inflationary pressures in the euro area have 
remained relatively contained since the autumn 

forecasts.  While, overall 
producer price (PPI)
inflation (excluding constructi
on) has edged up, from 
4.2% in November 2005 to 5.4% in February 2006, 

this development mainly 
reflected the influence of 
sharp rises in the energy component, from around 
15% in November 2005 to almost 20% in February 

2006.  Annual inflation in the consumer goods 
components, which are the most
 immediately relevant 
for consumer prices, has in contrast remained 

relatively subdued.  Infla
tion for durable consumer 
goods was 1.4% in Februa
ry 2006, 1.5% for non-
durable goods, while it was 1.0% for capital goods. 

The relatively limited pass-th
rough on the non-energy 
components so far probably results from the reduced 
energy intensity of the eco
nomy, a heightened degree 
of competition and the im
proved financial situation of 
companies.

Industrial producer prices, euro area
Inflation expectations in the euro area have, on the 
whole, also remained fairly 
resilient to developments 
in oil and energy prices.  Toward
s the end of April 
2006 long-term inflation expectations derived from 
French government indexed linked bonds stood at 
around 2.15%, although up compared to mid-2005, 

this level was similar to 
that that of early November 
2005.  Short-term inflation expectations derived from 
the EU Harmonised Consumer survey, after 

recovering from historically low
 levels during the first 
half of last year, have since
 levelled-off and remain 
below their historical average. 
Turning to wages, labour cost indicators in the euro 
area support the overall picture of continued moderate 

wage increases.  After an upswing in the first quarter 
of 2005, annual growth in
 total hourly labour costs 
declined to 2.4% in the fourth quarter.  The ECB's 

indicator of negotiated wages
 also supports the picture 
of continued wage moderation 
throughout 2005.  For 
the year as a whole, it is estimated that growth in 

compensation per employee fell to 1.9%, after 2.4% 
in 2004, signalling the absence thus far of significant 
second-round effects on wages from the rise in energy 

prices.  Combined with gradually recovering 
productivity, this mean
s that upward price pressure from unit labour costs has been easing.  
Inflation set to remain ab
ove 2% in 2006 and 2007 
Looking ahead, HICP inflation in the euro area is 
projected to ease gradually in the course of 2006, 
from 2.3% in the first qu
arter to 2.1% in the last 
quarter of the year.  This downward path is, however, 
interrupted in the first quart
er of 2007, when HICP 
inflation is set to jump to 2.5%, before declining back 

to 2.0% in the final quarter of that year.  The jump at 
the beginning of 2007 reflects an expected sharp 
increase of inflation in German
y (from 1.5% in the 
fourth quarter of 2005 to 2.9%
 in the first quarter of 
2007) due to the planed VAT increase in January of 
that year. In terms of annual av
erages, HICP inflation in the EU 
is projected to ease slightly fro
m 2.2% in 2005 to 
2.1% in 2006, before edging up back to 2.2% in 2007.  
In the euro area, HICP inflation is expected to remain 

unchanged at 2.2% in both 2006 and 2007.  Compared 
with the autumn forecasts, for the EU this corresponds 
to a 0.1 pp downward revision for 2006 and an 

upward revision by 0.3 pp for 2007.  For the euro 
area, the spring forecasts correspond to an unchanged 
projection for 2006 and a 0.
4 pp upward revision for 
2007.  Compared with the interim forecast released 
last February, the projections remain unchanged for 
both areas. 
The revised outlook fo
r inflation reflects mainly the 
higher oil price assumptions
 and the higher inflation 
profile in Germany.  However, the new projections 

also reflect the expectation of no significant second-
round effects from oil price increases on wages over 
39Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 the forecast horizon.  Indeed, growth in compensation 
per employee is projected to increase only slightly 
over the forecast horizon in both the euro area and the 

EU.  In the former 
it should rise from 1.
9% in 2005 to 
2.1% in 2007 and from 2.
4% in 2005 to 2.7% in 2007 
in the latter. Given the projected economic 
recovery and its lagged 
effect on employment 
growth, labour productivity 
growth should recover more markedly.  The 
projection is for a pick-up 
in productivity gains from 
0.7% in 2005 to around 1.1% in 2006-2007 in the 
euro area, and from 0.8% to 1.4% in the EU.  This 
should therefore lead to reduced pressure from unit 

labour costs.  Growth in un
it labour costs is expected 
to decline from 1.2% in 2005 to 1.0% in 2006 in the 
euro area, and from 1.6% in 2005 to 1.2% in the EU.  

Furthermore, the output gap is projected to remain 
broadly constant over the forecast horizon (at around  
-1.0% in both regions), indicating no overall upward 

pressures on prices from increased capacity 
utilisation. On the external side, markedly slower increases in the 
prices of primary commodities (including oil) should 
also bring about a redu
ction in imported inflation 
from around 4.1% in 2006 to 1.6% in 2007 in the euro 

area, and from 4.0% to 1.8% in the EU.  
Inflation prospects across Member States 
Among euro-area Member States, by far the most 
significant change to the outlook for inflation 
compared with the autumn is for Germany. Reflecting 

the planned VAT increase, HICP inflation in 
Germany is now projected 
to decline from 1.9% in 
2005 to 1.7% in 2006, before surging to 2.3% in 

2007.  This compares to a 
decline to 1.1% in 2007 
expected in the autumn forecast (.  In France and 
Italy, inflation is still expected
 to ease marginally over 
the forecast horizon, to reach 1.8% in 2007 in France 
and 2.0% in Italy.  In Spain, inflation is also projected 
to come down but to remain 
significantly higher than 
the other larger Member States and, at 3.1% in 2007, 
would be the third hi
ghest in the euro area after 
Luxembourg and Greece, where inflation would near 

3½%.  Among the smaller Member States, inflation is 
expected to remain subdued 
in Finland and Austria, 
which should register the 
lowest inflation rates in the 
area (close to 1½% in 2007).  Inflation in the 
Netherlands should also rem
ain among the lowest in 
the euro area, despite a proj
ected rise to about 2.0% in 
2007. Outside the euro area, 
inflation in the UK and 
Denmark is expected to remain broadly stable at 
around 2.0% in 2006 and 2007.  In Sweden, inflation 

should also remain subdued, although rising from 
1.1% in 2006 to 1.8% in 2007.  Among the larger 
recently-acceded Member States, after coming down 

from different levels by 
around 1 pp in 
2006, inflation 
in Hungary and Poland is pr
ojected to rise by roughly 
the same magnitude in 
2007 to reach
, respectively, 3.3% and 2.0%. In the Czech Republic and Lithuania, 
inflation is also expected to edge up, but more 

moderately to about 3.0% in 2007, while it remains 
broadly stable at around 
2½% in Slovenia.  In 
contrast, inflation is set to 
ease through 2007 to close 
to 3.0% in Estonia and 
around 5½% in Latvia.  In 
Slovakia, further increases in administered prices and 
indirect taxes are expected to first push up inflation to 

4½% in 2006, before it edges down to about 2½% in 
2007.   Table 2.7

406. Better-than-expected 2005 and economic 
recovery brighten public finance outlook Slow progress on the cards 
The public finance outlook f
or 2006 and 2007 starts 
from a significantly bette
r-than-expected outturn in 
2005, which is projected to carry over into the 

forecast period. The general government budget 
balance in the euro area as a whole was 2.4% of GDP 
in 2005, as compared to an autumn forecast of 2.9% 

of GDP. The positive surprise reflects lower-than-
expected expenditure in GDP, which more than offset 
a lower-than-expected revenue ratio. At the country 

level, the better-than-expect
ed outturn was relatively 
broad-based though particularly pronounced in 
Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Ireland. 
In spite of a relatively marked economic recovery in 
the euro area, the general government deficit is 
forecast to remain unchanged  at 2.4% of GDP. 
Consequently, the cyclically-ad
justed budget balance 
is likely to worsen slightly.  In 2007, by contrast, unchanged fiscal policies are 
expected to lead to a slight reduction of the nominal 
deficit in the euro area despite an expected easing of 
real economic growth. This reduction chiefly reflects 
the impact of the announced VAT increase in 

Germany where the deficit is projected to drop from 
3.1% of GDP in 2
006 to 2.4% in 2007. 
In structural terms, i.e. net of cyclical factors and 
temporary measures,  the budgetary situation is 

estimated to improve gradually over the entire 
forecast period (see Table 2.9). This trend is the 
result, inter alia
, of a diminishing recourse to 
temporary measures, particularly in Belgium, Italy 
and Portugal. 
The outlook in the EU as a whole is similar to that of 
the euro area. It is characterised by a better-than-

expected deficit outturn in 2005 and an unchanged 
nominal budget balance in
 2006. Unless policies 
change, the deficit in the EU as a whole is set to 

decrease marginally in 2007.  
The cyclical conditions 
in which the 
projected deficit 
path falls are characterised by 
mostly negative output 
gaps. In 2006 actual output in both the euro area and 
the EU is estimated to be 
around 1 percentage point 
below its potential level, essentially unchanged vis-à-
vis 2005. Cyclical conditions have remained 
remarkably stable over the past four forecast 
exercises, except in the case of small economies such 
as Estonia, Luxembourg, Latvia and Slovakia, for 
which estimates of potential 
output and th
e output gap 
tend to be more volatile than for larger economies. In 
these four economies the 200
6 output gap estimates 
have narrowed significantly, but otherwise there is no 
clear pattern in the revisions (see Graph 2.17). The 

measurement of cyclical conditions has therefore not 
affected the assessment of the fiscal stance over the 
past two years. The restrictive stance planned in most 

EDP countries is balanced by 
a slightly expansionary stance in the other EU economies.

Euro area: three out of five EDP countries on 
track towards reduction of deficit 
The essentially unchanged deficit forecast for the euro 
area as a whole masks offsetting patterns at the 
country level. Among the five
 countries currently in 
excessive deficit, three are expected to make varying 

degrees of progress toward
s reducing the deficit. In 
Germany, current policies are expected to bring the 
deficit significantly below 
3% of GDP in 2007. In 
Greece, the deficit is projected to reach the 3% of 
GDP threshold in 2006, but
 additional measures will 
be needed to ensure the correction is sustainable. In 
Portugal, current policies are forecast to keep the 
deficit essentially unchanged at around 5% of GDP 

over the forecast period, down from 6% of GDP in 
2005. The deadline set by 
the Council for Portugal to 
bring the deficit below 3% of GDP is end-2008. In 

France and Italy, by contrast, unless policies change, 
the deficit is projected to increase over the forecast 
period. 
41Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 Among the non-EDP countries, three – Belgium, the 
Netherlands and Ireland – are expected to 
significantly loosen their fiscal positions over the 

forecast period. In the case of the Netherlands the 
loosening in 2006 
largely reflects a shift of corporate 
income taxes to 2005. Minor changes or small 

improvements of the nominal budget balances are 
expected in the other countries of the euro area that 
are not in excessive deficit. 
Mixed patterns persist outside the euro area 
Outside the euro area, diverse fiscal policy and 
economic trends can be seen. Three EDP countries are 
enjoying a measurably improving economic 
environment. One of these, 
the United Kingdom, is 
expected to take advantage of the improving 
economic conditions in
 2006, when the deficit is 
projected to reach 3.0% of 
GDP, down from 3.5% in 
2005. A further, although somewhat smaller, 
adjustment is expected in 2007, when, assuming 
unchanged legislation, the deficit is set to drop below 

the 3% of GDP threshold. 
Poland, by contrast
, which is also benefiting from a 
better-than-expected ou
tturn in 2005 
that pushed the 
deficit significantly below 3% of GDP, is expected to 
loosen its budgetary position over the forecast 
horizon. The nominal deficit is expected to reach the 

3% of GDP threshold, in spite of a projected increase 
in the speed of economic expa
nsion throug
hout the forecast period, suggesting a fiscal loosening in 

structural terms. In Hungary, th
e deficit is similarly 
forecast to increase to close to 7% of GDP, in spite of 
a projected acceleration of economic activity in 2006.  
Cyprus and Slovakia, which brought their deficits 
below 3% of GDP in 2005, are expected to improve 
their fiscal position further in 2006 and 2007 against a 

backdrop of stable or
 only slightly increasing 
economic growth. Malta 
is expected to bring its 
deficit below the Treaty threshold in 2006. In the 
Czech Republic, however, the deficit is expected to 
consistently increase up until 2
007, a trend only partly 
attributable to the projected economic slowdown.  
A similarly varied picture can be drawn for the six 
non-EDP countries outside the euro area. In the two 
Scandinavian Member States – both running 
comfortable surpluses – 2006 is expected to see a 

discretionary easing of fiscal po
licy which, in the case 
of Sweden, is projected to be reined in during 2007. In 
the case of Denmark the lower surplus expected for 

2006 is a normalisation 
after exceptionally strong 
revenues in 2005 arising from tax bases boosted by 
buoyant financial markets. In Slovenia and the Baltic 

countries, one of which – Est
onia – is also running a 
surplus, the fiscal position is projected to stay within 
the margins which safeguard
 against the risk of 
breaching the 3% of GDP threshold.

Debt expected to embark on downward trend  
Over the forecast period, a combination of stronger 
economic growth and a stable primary surplus is 
expected to reverse the upward trend in the euro-area 

debt ratio observed since 2003. From the peak of 
70¾% of GDP in 2005, the debt ratio is projected to 
embark on a slow downward path, reaching around 

70% of GDP in 2007. 
A similar development is forecast in the EU as a 
whole, where the debt ratio is expected to drop from 
63½% of GDP in 2005 to marginally below 63% of 
GDP in 2007.  
The downward trend for the euro area and the EU as a 
whole masks a number of notable exceptions. In 
Hungary, the debt ratio is expected to rise above the 

60% of GDP threshold in 2007. In Germany, France 
and Italy existing policies, wh
ile slowing the upward 
trend compared to the autumn 2005 outlook, are not 

sufficient to reverse it by the end of the forecast 
period. In the case of Italy, current policies are 
expected to increase the debt ratio to close to 108% of 
GDP in 2007. 437. Both upside and downside risks 
The economic outlook in the spring forecast is one 
where the euro area and 
the EU return to potential 
growth supported externally by continued robust 

world trade, and internally by an acceleration of 
domestic demand, especially investment.  The outlook 
is also for inflation to stay slightly above 2%, with 

second-round effects of the strong rise in energy 
prices remaining containe
d.  However, there are 
several key risk factors to this 
outlook that need to be 
considered. 
On the 
external side, oil and energy prices remain 
exceptionally high and volat
ile.  With a tight balance 
between supply and demand, reflecting constraints in 

oil production and refining capacity, the market 
remains vulnerable to 
climatic, security and political 
disruptions.  The most recent surge in oil prices bears 

witness to the effect geopolitical tensions can have on 
oil prices under these circumstances.  Price increases 
above those already assumed can therefore not be 

ruled out and continue to be amongst the major risks 
to the outlook.  In
 particular, although world 
economic growth has withstood the oil-price shock so 
far, it cannot be excluded 
that negative non-linear 
confidence effects might come into play in the 

relationship between energy prices and economic 
growth at higher price levels.
  Obviously, higher-than-
assumed increases in energy prices will also have a 

direct impact on the outlook
 for headline inflation. 
Moreover, second-round 
effects on wages may 
emerge beyond certain thresholds of energy price 

increases, testing the assumption 
of continued benign 
wage developments.   
On the other hand, if the currently high oil prices 
contain a sizeable geopolitical risk premium, then 

there is also a risk of a decline in oil prices as a 
consequence of an easing 
in geopolitical tensions, 
implying in turn an upward 
risk to the growth outlook 
and a downward risk 
to the inflation outlook 
Global current account imbalances have continued to 
increase since last autumn and a disorderly correction 
of these remains a threat to world growth.  Clearly, 
the more such imbalances accumulate, the larger the 
associated risks for the global economy, which means 

that they are higher for 20
07 than for 2006.     
Furthermore, the gradual removal of excess liquidity 
could affect financial markets more adversely than is 
usually assumed.  In recent years, the search for yield 

among investors has resulted in historically low 
credit-risk premiums.  As past experience shows, such 
low risk premiums could adjust abruptly as liquidity 
is withdrawn and investors become more 
discriminating.  
Since managing corporate debt has been facilitated by 
historically low interest rates, mo
re testing times may 
be ahead.  Higher interest rates have so far been felt 

mainly in the corporate bond market, but the recent 
increase in policy rates can be expected to feed 
through into bank lending 
rates.  In the context of a 
still significant level of accumulated corporate debt, 
this could have a stronger-than-anticipated effect on 
investment expenditure, the 
extent of which depends 
on the size and pace of the monetary tightening and 
the reaction of longer-term interest rates
.  In 
particular, in view of the expected gathering of 

momentum of the recovery, a 
gradual deterioration in 
funding conditions would 
not be expected to impact 
significantly on investment decisions over the forecast 

period.  However, if interest rates were to rise more 
sharply, the need to ro
ll over short-term and maturing 
longer-term corporate debt could weigh on any 
recovery in corporate investment activity.  
Past years have also been characterised by rapid 
growth in the use of highl
y complex financial 
instruments, such as credit derivatives.  The markets 
for these instruments remain relatively untested in 
periods of stress, presenting a 
risk of discontinuity in 
the event of adverse developments with potential 
knock-on effects to the broader financial system.  
The resilience of growth in the US has continued to 
surprise, backed by strong
 and unrelenting growth in 
private consumption.  While
 the US economy might 
again surprise on the up
side in the short-term, an 
adjustment of consumer behaviour at some stage, in 

the light of the impact of rising interest rates or a 
sharper-than-expected correction in the US housing 
market, cannot be ruled out.
  However, the strong 
momentum in the world economy and the buoyancy 
in many survey indicators also imply some upside 
risks, especially in the shorter horizon.   In addition to the US, a stronger-than-expected 
consolidation of the recovery in Japan and continued 
buoyant growth in China 
could provide some upside 
risk.A further downside risk on the external side is the 
continued possibility 
of a global pandemic originating 
44Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
from an avian flu (see also 
box 2.3).  However, the 
likelihood, timing and severity of a pandemic are 
extremely difficult to assess with any significant 

degree of confidence.  
On the internal side, private consumption remains 
subject to both upside and downside risks.  On the one 
hand, consumer confidence may improve more than 

expected due to better labour market conditions and a 
reduction of uncertainty over fu
ture income streams, 
thanks to past or ongoing structural reforms.  Such a 

recovery in confidence would trigger a release of 
pent-up demand which has accumulated in the 
household sector and which could be financed 

through a reduction in the saving rate.   
On the other hand, indepen
dently from the above-
mentioned external risk associated with the evolution 
of oil prices itself, there is also as risk that indirect 

and second-round effects fr
om past increases in oil 
prices may still materialise, ulti
mately leading to a 
stronger-than-projected loss in the purchasing power 

of households, thereby dampening consumption 
expenditure more than
 currently anticipated.  In 
addition, in the even
t of a stronger-than-expected 
pass-through of energy prices to other prices the 
forecast may underestimate the extent and speed of 

monetary tightening, entailing the risk of a more 
subdued evolution of output growth. 
Moreover, while not a problem for the euro area or 
the EU as a whole, house prices seem to be stretched 

in some Member States and cou
ld pose a downside 
risk in these coun
tries, especially if the price corrections are not grad
ual.  Growing debt has also 
made the household sector more vulnerable in general 
to adverse shocks, which could form a downside risk 
of particular significance in a period of rising 

financing costs.  
In the case of investmen
t, positive risks arise from 
stronger growth of specific 
housing markets, stronger-
than-expected external dema
nd or higher productivity 
as a result of IT-investments and past reforms.  
Negative risks include higher oil prices, a 
disappointing development of aggregate demand and 
entrenched low-growth expectations. 
A final risk to both the co
nsumption and investment 
outlook stems from the unc
ertainty surrounding the 
impact of the German consolidation package, which 
covers a wide range of measures of an unprecedented 
scale.  It cannot be excluded that economic agents 
react to this package differently from what is currently 
assumed, with potentially positive or negative effects 
on GDP growth in Germany and the EU. 
Overall, the risks to the gr
owth outlook in this 
forecast seem to be fairly balanced but uncertainties, 
especially on the external side, clearly increase over 

time.  Regarding 2006, 
the risks appear 
slightly tilted to the upside, as the forecast may underestimate the 
current momentum of growth
, both inside and outside 
the EU.  For 2007, the 
risks are more tilted to the 
downside, with the 
uncertainties linked to the evolution of oil prices and its effects on output growth 

and inflation weighing particularly on the outlook.  
The pictured balance of risk
s is enhanced by the 
mentioned uncertainties surround
ing the impact of the 
budgetary policy measures in Germany, which tend to 
reinforce the upside risks in 2006 and the downside 
risks in 2007. 
45Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 Box 2.3:
 Economic implications for Europe of a possible flu pandemic 
One risk highlighted in the current forecast reflects concern 
about a possible influenza pandemic originating from an 
avian flu.  
The H5N1 avian flu virus has spread quickly among birds 
with a high mortality rate. Human infections are still very 
rare but have been fatal in more than half of the detected 
cases. The H5N1 avian flu has a pandemic potential, since it 
could mutate into a strain that is contagious among humans. 
The World Health Organisation 
(WHO), which facilitates 
pandemic preparedness planning by means of a 6 phase 
approach (see www.who.int), assesses the current risk 
situation as being at phase 3: a virus new to humans that is 
causing infection, but does not spread easily from one person 
to another. 
It should be noted that it is close to impossible to predict the 
evolution of influenza viruses or if a virus might become 
easily transmissible among humans. It is therefore also 
impossible to assess when another pandemic may occur; if it 
would involve H5N1, and if it would be a mild or a severe 
pandemic. What is known is that influenza pandemics are 
rare, but recurrent events.  
Drawing on the experiences of the three pandemics that 
occurred in the previous century, i.e. the "Spanish influenza" 
in 1918, the "Asian influenza" in 1957 and the "Hong Kong 
influenza" in 1968, the Commission will assess the potential 
economic implications for Europe in the case of a flu 
pandemic in a forthcoming economic paper. The economic 
costs of a pandemic, in terms of production lost due to illness 
and death will be measured as reductions in GDP growth 
and/or declines in the level of GDP under different pandemic 
scenarios.  The effects on the economies of the EU Member States will 
be estimated using a quarterly macro-economic model. 
Using such a model has the advantage of capturing a number 
of substitution and interaction effects and of both the short-
run and long-run perspective. It must be stressed that the 
assessments would still be surrounded with
 great uncertainty, 
well beyond the assumptions made on the attack and fatality 
rates. Medical technology has made considerable advances 
since previous pandemics. Automatic stabilisers (such as 
health insurance and government transfers) ought to play an 
important role in dampening the economic impact. On the 
other hand, global integration and indirect effects stemming 
from reduced confidence in the financial markets and among 
households and enterprises may increase some risks. 
The central scenario of the study – derived from the 
pandemics in the last century - assumes that a pandemic 
would have (i) a morbidity rate (i.e. the percentage of the 
population infected by the pandemic) of 30%; (ii) a mortality 
rate (i.e. the percentage of the infected that die) of 2.5%; and 
(iii) an average of 3 weeks out of work due to the pandemic. 
This would imply that around 150 million Europeans would 
become sick for three weeks and 2.5% of those, i.e. 0.75% of 
the total population, which corresponds to 3.75 million 
persons, would die. Both the sickness and the mortality rates 
are assumed to be uniformly distributed over the age cohorts. 
Furthermore, it is assumed that the pandemic has an identical 
health impact on the rest of the world outside Europe.  
Both supply and demand effects are to be expected. The 
supply effect stems from the loss of hours worked, while the 
demand effect results mainly from precautionary measures 
taken by the population in order to avoid infection. Certain 
types of activities, like trade and tourism, are likely to be 
particularly severely hit.  
The initial findings point to a reduction in GDP growth of 
around 1½ percentage points in year 1. If the pandemic had 
occurred in the first quarter of this year, the outlook for GDP 
growth in this spring forecast would have been limited to just 
below 1% in 2006 (instead of 2.3%). The main impact arises from the supply side (
 -1 pp), while the demand side would 
limit growth by ½ pp. However, in the following year (2007 
in this simulation), a recovery is projected and GDP growth 
would be around 1 pp. higher. The expected adjustment is 
based on the pattern known from previous pandemics. In the 
longer term, the level of GDP in the EU would be ¾ pp. 
lower, reflecting the permanent reduction of the population 
and thereby also of the labour force. The results refer to an 
average effect for the EU. However, it is likely that some 
Member States, such as the Mediterranean countries, would 
be more affected because of their larger tourist industry.  
An alternative, worst-case scenario takes into account that 
the psychological effects could be markedly larger (leading 
to a stronger decline in domestic demand). In this scenario, 
the impact on GDP growth is estimated to be between -2 and 
-4 pps. in year 1. Following a subsequent recovery, the level 
of GDP would decline by around ¾ pp. in the longer term.  
The outcome of the two scenarios is broadly in line with 
predictions made else
where for e.g. the USA.

Activity in 2005 
In 2005, economic activity gradually accelerated after 
a near standstill in the first
 quarter, resulting in a 
moderate 1.2% growth of real GDP. Investment 

growth turned out to be very
 high, mainly as a result 
of a catching-up effect after several years of low 
investment and some exceptional
 investments in the 
shipping industry (amounting to
 about 0.2% of GDP). 
Public investment, mainly 
by local government, also 
experienced exceptiona
lly strong growth (13.5% in 
real terms) in the run-up to 
the October 2006 local 
elections. Meanwhile, other components of domestic 
demand grew more moderately due to continuously 

decreasing consumer confidence in the first three 
quarters of the year and strict expenditure restraint by 
the government in view 
of its budgetary targets. Net 
exports deteriorated significan
tly as a result of a 
decrease in external demand in the first quarter of 
2005 combined with a strong acceleration of imports 

in the final three quarters. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
By now the acceleration of activity that had started in 
2005 has gained momentum and should lead to real 

GDP growth of around 2.3% in 2006 and of 2.1% in 
2007. The Belgian central bank's business survey, 
which is usually a very goo
d indicator for cyclical 
developments (see graph 3.1), has shown a marked 
improvement since the 
second half of 2005. 
Moreover, consumer confidence has also started to 

improve since its low poin
t in the third quarter last 
year, with households re
porting a higher saving 
capacity and lower unemployment expectations. 
Consumer demand also benefits from an anticipated 
increase in real disposable income, due to increased 
employment and the implement
ation of the final stage 
of the 2001 tax reform
. Meanwhile strong business 
confidence, growing demand and continued high 
business profitability are supporting high private 

investment levels in 2006, although the growth rate 
should fall back somewh
at following the exceptional 
results in 2005. The electoral public investment cycle 

that started in 2005
 should also remain strong in the 
first half of 2006. But it is expected to decrease 
markedly after the local elections, following a similar 
pattern observed in the pa
st. Moreover, its impact is 
offset by large real estate sales (0.2% of GDP) by the 
federal government in 2006. Government 

consumption should remain more subdued throughout 
the forecasting period in view the strict budgetary 
targets. The significant loss in
 net exports near the end 
of 2005 is expected to be mainly temporary and 
external demand should increase as a result of the 
growth acceleration in Belgium's main trading 
partners.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The labour market is expected to benefit from the 
economic upturn that started toward
s the end of 2005. 
Total employment is forecast to grow by about 1% 
per annum in 2006 and 
2007, but the impact on 
unemployment is partly offset by the growth of the 

labour force. Despite efforts 
to restrain labour costs, 
pressures on competitiveness are 
building up due to 
wage moderation in th
e neighbouring countries. 
In 2006, HICP inflation 
might still suffer from the 
recent turmoil in oil markets and reach 2.4%. Inflation 
measured by the national CPI in 2006 (2.0%) will 
exceptionally be lower th
an HICP inflation, due to a 
revision of the product basket and a change in the 
base year. From 2007 onwards, HICP and CPI 
inflation are expected to be about the same, at around 

2.1%.  
Public finances 
Despite the growth deceleration, tax revenue 
remained on track in 200
5. Reforms in the health 
sector kept health care expenditure in line with 
expectations (against a large overrun in 2004). 
Government accounts also benefited from additional 

one-off revenues of some 0.2% of GDP linked to a 
decision to take over pension
 obligations from the

SNCB (railways) and the Antwerp Port. As a result, 
Belgium has reported a small surplus
1 for 2005.  
For 2006, a deficit of 0.3% of GDP can be expected, 
in contrast to the balanc
ed budget foreseen in the 
2006 budget law, mainly as 
a result of lower estimates 
for the proceeds of some new taxes (for instance on 
some investment products or on excess capacity in the 

electricity industry) in 
the 2006 budget and less 
optimistic assumptions regarding government 
expenditure. A substantial package of one-off 
measures (0.6% of GDP) also supports government 
accounts. In the first months of 2006, tax revenue 
continued to increase stron
gly, but this was largely 
offset by an unanticipated
 increase in interest 
expenditure following 
recent interest rate rises. In 
2007 the government ba
lance is likely to further 
deteriorate due to the phas
ing out of the above-
mentioned one-off measures and measures to reduce 
the tax-burden on labour (0
.2%), though this will be 
partly offset by anticipated reduc
tions in spending by 
local authorities (0.2%). Therefo
re, on a no-policy-
change basis a deficit of 0.9% of GDP is anticipated.  
The debt reduction was slow
ed down in 2005 by the 
assumption of debt from the railways, but should 

continue in 2006 and 2007. By the end of the forecast 
horizon, the debt ratio is 
expected to fall well below 
90% of GDP.                                                           
1The assumption of debt (2.5% of GDP) from the railway 
company SNCB by the government in 2005 has been treated 
without impact to the deficit. However, Eurostat considers that this 

debt assumption must be recorded as a capital transfer, with an 
impact on the government deficit by the same amount. Belgium has 
informed Eurostat of its intention to introduce legislation to 

retroactively annul this transaction. In spite of this, the debt ratios 
for 2005, 2006 and 2007 in this forecast include the railway debt.

 % of GDP
Activity in 2005 
Real GDP growth reached 6% in 2005, the best ever 
result in the 15 years history of the Czech Republic. 
This impressive economic performance was driven 

mainly by very strong net
 exports, coming largely on 
the back of foreign direct
 investment of previous 
years in the automotive sector. Exports rose by more 

than 11% in real terms, while imports were up by just 
under 5%. The external bal
ance of goods and services 
improved significantly in 2
005, reaching a 
surplus of about 2% of GDP, for the first time since 1991. 
Against this backdrop, the 
net borrowing vis-à-vis the 
rest of the world narrowed substantially. Growth of 

private consumption remaine
d weak, in line with the 
moderate growth of real gross disposable income, 
which was negatively influ
enced by relatively weak 
real wage growth and unfavourable developments in 
the terms of trade. Public consumption grew only 
slightly, though data are affected
 by a large one-off 
purchase of military equipment. Gross fixed capital 
formation decelerated, d
espite the record-low interest 
rates. From the supply side,
 economic activity was 
driven mainly by industry, trade and financial 
services. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
In 2006 and 2007, the economic expansion is 
projected to remain strong, but to decelerate to some 
5¼% in 2006 and 4¾% in 2007
. Domestic demand is 
expected to replace net exports as the main growth 

driver. Private consumption will be stimulated by an 
improving labour market 
situation, while investment 
will benefit from new projects by foreign investors, 
higher utilisation of EU structural funds and 
favourable financial conditions. Public consumption 
will accelerate as well, though only modestly. 
Vigorous exports are likely 
to continue,
 profiting 
mainly from favourable econom
ic developments in 
the main trading partners and thanks to new 
production capacities in the 
automotive industry. 
Imports are projected to accelerate against the 
backdrop of stronger investment and a moderate 
increase in consumer spending. The favourable 

developments in net exports will be largely offset by 
increasing deficits in the in
come balance due to rising 
repatriated profits and sal
aries to non-residents. 
Nevertheless, the net borro
wing vis-à-vis the rest of 
the world should hover only around 2% of GDP.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Strong economic performance helped improve the 
situation in the labour market.  Employment grew 

faster in 2005 and the rate of unemployment began to 
fall, reaching less than 8%. Employment is projected 
to continue rising over the forecast horizon. The 
unemployment rate is forecast to fall from almost 8% 
in 2005 to about 7½% in 
2007. However, structural 
shortcomings in the labour market (such as a high 
share of long-term unem
ployed) are expected to 
remain. 
Due to the ongoing appreciati
on of the koruna, falling 
food prices, favourable base effects and strong 
competition, HICP inflation in
 2005 was only 1.6%. 
As a consequence of high
 energy prices, inflation 
somewhat increased towards the end of 2005 and re-
entered the target band set by
 the monetary authorities 
(CPI inflation of 3% year on year +/-1 percentage 

points since 2006). Inflation is expected to further 
increase in the first half of 2006. However, the 
second-round effects of increased energy prices are 

projected to be weak and in
flation should grow only 
gradually in the second half of the year. Average 
HICP inflation is expected to reach 2½% in 2006 and 

accelerate slightly in 2007. Public finances 
The government deficit ratio in 2005 was -2½% of 
GDP, after about -3% in 2004. This development was 

due to the favourable eco
nomic situation and fiscal 
targeting introduced in 20
04. More importantly, the 
low deficits in latest years reflect th
e possibility given

to government departments to carry over unspent 
funds, rather than intenti
onal and durable spending cuts. The cumulative sum of expenditure carryovers is 
currently estimated at some 1¾% of GDP. The 
uncertainty about when these funds will be 
accumulated and when they will be spent complicates 

the forecasting of public finances. This budgetary 
forecast assumes cumulated expenditure carryovers to 
remain constant in
 2006 and 2007. 
In 2006, the general governme
nt deficit is projected to 
reach some 3¼% of GDP. The forecast is based on the 
fiscal target set by the Czech authorities (-3.8% of 
GDP), but is more optimistic ab
out revenues.   On the 
expenditure side, the forecast takes account of a debt 
cancellation of about ¼% of GDP. The budgetary 
outcome is thus expected to be more than half a 

percentage point worse than in
 2005, in spite of the 
strong economic performance.  
The 2007 deficit is projected to reach about 3½% of 
GDP which is slightly more 
than the targeted 3.3% of 
GDP. It is assumed that 
the planned nominal medium-
term expenditure ceiling will be exceeded, as in the 
2006 draft budget, in order to finance recently 
introduced additional social spending. The structural 
budgetary balance is forecast to worsen in both 2006 
and 2007. Government debt – which was recently revised 
downwards because of the reclassification of a state 

guarantee – is expected to increase from 30½% of 
GDP in 2005 to some 32
½% at the end of 2007.

Denmark - GDP and the growth contributions
yoy % ch.
%Activity in 2005 
In 2005, the Danish economy gained further 
momentum. Despite hesitant first and last quarters, 
real GDP growth reached 3.1% for the year as a 

whole, following 1.9% in 
2004. As in 2004, private 
consumption continued to be a main driving force, 
supported in particular by
 a booming housing market 
with price increases of above 20% in the fourth 
quarter, low interest rates and falling
 unemployment. 
However, investments also 
took off in 2005 and grew 
overall by 9%. The increase 
in investment activity 
was particularly strong for 
both construction and equipment, although investment
 in equipment showed 
a rather erratic behaviour over the year. Moreover, 
public consumption expanded
 and grew by more than 
1¼%, well above the ½% 
objective set by the 
government, which can be
 partly explained by 
overspending by local governments. All in all the 
contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth was 

4 percentage points. 
As for the external sector, 
both exports and imports 
accelerated in 2005. Exports of goods and services 
grew by almost 8% and benefited from strong growth 
in both the US economy 
and in Asia, as well as from a 
strong US dollar. However, due to buoyant private 

consumption and a high import
 content in exports, 
import growth of about 11% was higher than that of 
exports. Consequently, net exports continued to 

contribute negatively to GD
P growth by 1 percentage 
point, although less than
 the year before.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Economic indicators give a very positive picture of 
the short-term prospects for the Danish economy. 
Consumer confidence is at a historically high level 
and overall consumers are extremely satisfied with 

their personal economic situa
tion and with the general 
economic situation. Business confidence is also at 
relatively high historical levels, with the industrial, 

construction and services 
sectors all positive about 
production and sales. 
Against this setting, GDP 
growth is expected to 
continue to grow steadily and 
above potential over the 
forecast period at about 3¼% in 2006 and 2¼% in 
2007. Compared with 2005, gr
owth is projected to be 
supported not only by robust domestic demand, but 

also by growing external demand. Private 
consumption is expected to moderate somewhat as the 
effects of tax cuts on real disposable income fade out 

and as the wealth effects of the sharp increase in 
house prices taper off. At
 the present juncture, 
however, it is not clear to 
what extent higher interest 
rates and thereby higher fi
nancing costs may limit 
further increases in house prices. Moreover, 
investment is envisaged to continue to grow strongly 
over the forecast period and to contribute to more 
balanced economic growth. Finally, exports of goods 

and services are forecast to continue growing steadily, 
benefiting from an econo
mic upswing in Europe and 
an expansion of Denmark's export markets. With 

imports dampening somewhat in line with a 
moderation in private consumption, net exports are 
also expected to contribute to economic growth, albeit 

rather modestly.  
Labour market, cost and prices 
In 2005, employment picked up strongly and 
unemployment fell to ve
ry low levels. Despite shortages of labour in certain sectors, there are so far 

few signs of mounting wa
ge pressures in the overall 
economy and wage-driven inflation. This can be 
explained by the typically
 lagged response of the 
labour market to the 
business cycle. Moreover, it is 
likely that increasing comp
etition from emerging 
markets is also playing a role, in so far as the threat of outsourcing and import of labour is having a 
dampening effect on wages. Nevertheless, as the 

expansion of the economy continues and the labour 
market tightens further, wage pressures are expected 
to gradually grow stronger over the forecast period.

2004, which was

).cuts and low import prices, the rate increased in 2005. 
This was largely due to rising energy prices, while 
domestic inflation remained relatively subdued. 

However, as capacity and wage pressures in the 
economy are expected to grow stronger, domestically 
generated inflation is now 
expected to pick up. This, 
together with continuingly 
high energy prices, is 
expected to lead to a further increase in consumer 
price inflation. Headline 
inflation is therefore projected to be around 2% thro
ughout 2006 and 2007.    
Public finances  
After a surplus of 2.7% of GDP in 2004, the general 
government recorded a surplus of close to 5% in 
2005. In addition to the effects of healthy economic 

growth, the strength of the public finances is largely 
due to higher revenue from oil and gas exploitation 
and from the pension yield tax, where higher prices 

and favourable financial market developments 
respectively have boosted tax revenues. It should be 
noted that the surplus figures used by the Commission 
services, in contrast to the Danish National Accounts, 
will include the surplus of the second pillar pension 

fund until spring 2007, wh
ich improves the general 
government surplus by about 1 percentage point of 
GDP.  In the forecast period, lower revenues from the 
pension fund yield tax and,
 later on, a moderation in 
growth of economic activity are expected to translate 
into somewhat lower 
surpluses. Nevertheless, with 
continued relatively stro
ng surpluses the gross debt 
ratio is expected to be reduc
ed further, to below 30% 
of GDP in 2007.

Activity in 2005 
Real GDP growth was rather volatile in 2005. 
Substantial advances of 0.6% in
 the first and the third 
quarters, respectively, were followed by a moderate 

second and a disappointing fin
al quarter. In the last 
three months of 2005, the negative contribution to 
growth from both domestic and external demand was 

counterbalanced by an extraordina
rily strong build-up 
of inventories, resulting in 
a flat profile for real GDP 
in the fourth quarter. While the uncertainty 

surrounding the working day effect makes a 
substantial revision of the growth composition in the 
final quarter of 2005 likely, the overall picture of a 

modest, export-driven recovery is still intact.  
As in 2004, external demand provided the biggest 
contribution to overall GDP growth. While stock-
building also had a positiv
e impact, final domestic 
demand again did not contribute to growth. 
Continued wage restraint 
helped to maintain 
international price competitiven
ess and export market 
shares. On the downside, low wage growth and a 
further fall in empl
oyment curbed private 
consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital 

formation in 2005.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
The latest indicators are sending mixed signals 
regarding the strength of the economic recovery in 
Germany. Seasonally adjusted unemployment slightly 

increased in March and households' future earnings 
expectations dropped for a 
second straight month. On 
the other hand, the 
ifo
 index suggests th
at business 
confidence reached its highest level for 15 years and 
also the GfK consumer climate index surged, 
indicating a possible release
 of some pent-up demand 
in the run-up to the 3 pe
rcentage point 
increase in the 
standard VAT rate as from January 2007.  
Indeed, the cyclical pattern will be dominated by the 
budgetary measures that are 
part of the coalition 
agreement and which will have significant effects 
even beyond the forecast horizon (see Box 2.2).  
The underlying trend of private consumption 
expenditure remains moderate, as employment will 

only gradually pick up and the inflationary effects of 
the VAT increase will weigh on real disposable 
income in 2007. However, households are expected to 

bring forward some purchases of durable consumer 
goods in anticipation of the VAT increase. As a result, 
private consumption is pr
ojected to strongly increase 
in 2006 and to sli
ghtly fall in the next year. 
Correspondingly, the household savings rate is 
forecast to decrease significantly in 2006 and to 

remain at a lower level in 2007. 
Similarly, the carry-forward effect for housing 
investment should be substantial, with an equally 

strong negative echo effect in
 2007. Consequently, 
gross fixed capital formation will receive a boost in 
the current year before subsiding in 2007.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The situation on the labo
ur market is finally 
improving, as job losses, in 
particular for jobs subject 
to social security contributions, are bottoming out. 
While in the cu
rrent year employment gains are 
54Chapter 3 Member States, Germany expected to be large for part-time jobs, growth of full-
time employment is projected to accelerate over the 
forecast period. Hence, unemployment will further 

recede in 2006 and 2007.  
More favourable developments on the labour market 
and solid company profits ar
e prompting trade unions 
to demand higher wage increases after several years 

of wage restraint. Thou
gh effective pay will continue to increase by less than contractual wages, private 
sector wages and salaries are expected to increase in 

2006 and 2007. Nevert
heless, unit labour costs are expected to further decline up to the forecast horizon, 
as productivity growth will again outpace the increase 

in compensation per employee in 2006 and employers' 
contributions to unempl
oyment insurance will be 
lowered as from 2007. Developments in external 

competitiveness will thu
s remain favourable. 
As a result of the temporary boost to domestic 
demand, imports are forecast to increase strongly in 
2006 and the contribution to growth of external trade 

is expected to temporarily turn negative. In the next 
year, the external surplu
s will widen again and 
significantly contribute to overall GDP growth. 
With wage increases remaining moderate and the 
effects of the surge in oil prices 
fading, inflationary 
pressures should slacken in the rest of this year. In 

2007 HICP inflation will be
 driven by the 3 
percentage point increase in the standard VAT rate, of 
which two thirds is expected to be passed through to 

consumer prices. 
Public finances 
The general government deficit edged down to 3.3% 
of GDP in 2005, from 3.7% in 2004, the decrease 
being driven by structural developments as the deficit 

in cyclically-adjusted te
rms was reduced from 3.4% 
of GDP to 3.0%. Tax revenues increased by 2.1%. In 
particular, direct taxes showed strong growth despite 

the final stage of tax cuts passed in 2000, which 
provided considerably less relief for households than 
projected. Indirect taxes yielded stronger revenues 

than implied by tax base developments, reflecting 
strong growth of local ta
xes. Subsidy repayments by 
severalLandesbanken
 and the introduction of the road 
toll for lorries added to revenues. 
General government expenditure increased by 1.1% in 
nominal terms in 2005, resulti
ng in a slight fall in the 
expenditure share in GDP. 
The public wage bill was 
contained by wage restra
int and by personnel 
reduction. Pension outlays have
 grown less than GDP, 
as pensions are indexed to wage developments with a 
lag, although the number of beneficiaries is rising. A 
government decision prevent
ed cuts in nominal per 
capita benefits, which would have followed from the 
adjustment mechanism in force. As a result, the 
liquidity fund of the pensi
on system has been further 
depleted. The dampening effect of the 2004 health 
care reform abated in 2005; health care expenditure 
increased by 3.1% in 2005, after decreasing by the 

same percentage in the previous year. 
Payments from the unemployment insurance 
decreased significantly in 
2005. Although the 
unemployment rate acco
rding to the Eurostat 
definition remained constan
t, the number of benefit 
recipients declined, since some were transferred into 
the new system of social assistance and others moved 

into subsidised self-em
ployment. Moreover, active labour market policies were reduced. The new system 
of social assistance ("Hartz IV") did not deliver the 
budgetary savings expected 
by the government, since 
problems in design and administrative frictions during 

the transition period resu
lted in more recipients than 
expected. 
In 2006, the general government deficit is expected to 
decline to 3.1% of GDP, larg
ely owing to improved 
cyclical conditions, while the cyclically-adjusted 
deficit is expected to remain broadly constant. 
Revenues are projected to increase by 1.3%. Newly 

introduced measures widen some direct tax 
allowances and cut back others. For example, 
depreciation rules on non-fixed capital are made more 

generous and some household services are being 
granted tax-favourable treatment. In contrast, 
loopholes on tax-saving investment funds are 

removed. Regarding indirect taxes, the method of tax 
collection from small businesses is changed, resulting 
in tax losses in 20
06. Overall, the fiscal effects of 
these measures tend to cancel out. However, indirect 
tax revenues will be boosted
, as taxable consumption 
is brought forward from 2007. Companies have to 
carry forward their monthly so
cial contributions from 
the middle of the following month to the end of the 

month when the payment 
is due. This will lead to 
thirteen instead of twelve pa
yments in 2006, 
providing temporary 
cash relief until 2007. This is 
budget neutral in ESA95

that the social security system would record deficits in 
2006 and 2007. The 2005 Bundesbank profit adds 
revenues to the amount of 0.1% of GDP in 2006.  
General government expenditure is projected to grow 
by 0.8% in 2006
, resulting in a reduction in the 
expenditure share in GDP by 0.5 of a percentage point 
compared with 2005. Active labour market policies 

are being stepped up, 
while tightening means-testing 
for social benefit recipients. New subsidies and 
additional spending on road and rail road 

infrastructure will add to 
expenditure. The abolition of the subsidy on owner-occupied housing will make a 
growing contribution to consolidation. Pension 

expenditure will rise only 
slightly. The public sector 
wage agreements continue to contribute substantially 
to consolidation in 2006 and 2007. 
In 2007, the general government deficit, projected at 
2.5% of GDP, would fall well below the Treaty 
reference value. The increase in the central VAT rate 
from 16% to 19% should 
add almost 1% of GDP to 
revenues. On the other hand, the government has 
adopted legislation to lower the contribution rate to 

the unemployment insurance from 6.5% to 4.5% and 
intends to increase the pe
nsion contribution rate from 
19.5% to 19.9%, which might
 not be sufficient to 
keep the pension system in balance. Under current 
legislation, public h
ealth insurers are projected to 
increase contribution rates by ½ a percentage point. 

Overall, the revenue share in GDP is expected to 
remain broadly constant compared with 2006. The 
expenditure share should decline by ½ a percentage 

point or more, reflecting 
public sector wage restraint 
and reductions in labo
ur-market-related spending. 
With low nominal GDP growth, the public debt ratio 
is projected to increase from 67.7% of GDP in 2005 

to 69.2% in 2007, desp

from the above-mentioned cash relief in the social 
systems and from privatisations.

Activity in 2005 
According to preliminary national accounts data, real 
GDP growth rose to a hi
gh 9.8% in 2005. The 
quarterly profile of y-o-
y growth rates shows a strong 
acceleration over the year. While export growth 
expanded by more than 20% in real terms, imports 
remained below that growt
h rate, and thus the net 
export contribution was pos
itive in 2005, a 
development which supported a distinct improvement 
on the trade balance. Private consumption expanded 

strongly, too, fuelled by
 significant increases in 
households' disposable in
come. However, investment 
grew fastest among the domestic demand 

components, at above 13 %. Construction benefited in 
particular from a housing boom driven by lively credit 
expansion. 
Although foreign trade 
data remain somewhat 
unreliable following several 
methodological revisions 
since EU accession, they suggest a trend reversal in 
the sizeable external imbalance: the external account 

deficit for 2005 turned out at below 10% of GDP, and 
the current account deficit at around 10 ½% of GDP 
which constitutes a 
two percentage points 
improvement as compared with 2004. The 
improvement occurred primarily on the trade of goods 

balance, while the services 
surplus declined.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
The economy is projected to remain on a firm growth 
path over the forecast period. While 2006 will benefit 
from a strong carry-over effect, data on trade and 

industrial production indicate some deceleration. Also 
price developments in the real estate sector suggest 
some cooling of demand since early 2006. Thus, 
annual growth in 2006
-2007 is expected at around 8-
9%, converging towards potential output at the end of 

the forecast period. 
Final domestic demand is expected to continue to 
drive growth, primarily 
led by investment, with 
housing construction still increasing strongly. Private 

consumption is also expected to remain robust, due to 
a healthy combination of employment growth, 
continued whitening of some parts of the grey 

economy and substan
tial real wage gains. The 
competitive cost advantag
e and rapidly growing 
productivity gains will continue to boost export 

growth. Net exports are projected to provide a 
positive contribution to gr
owth also in 2006, despite 
deteriorating terms of trade caused primarily by 

higher energy import pri
ces. However, in 2007 the 
export contribution to growth is projected to turn 
negative again, with private consumption expenditure 

driving imports. 
Throughout the forecast period, the external account 
deficit is expected to narrow 
steadily to less than 8% 
of GDP. Further improvements on the trade balance 
are projected to be supported by public sector savings. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Strong economic growth has c
ontributed to significant 
employment growth and 
a marked reduction of 
unemployment last year. In line with the projected 
expansion of construction output and continued 
dynamic growth in the ser
vice sector (in particular 
tourism), employment ga
ins are likely to continue in 
2006 and 2007, albeit at a slower pace. Labour force 
growth, after taking account of significant outward 

migration (chiefly towards 
the ‘old’ EU Member 
States) and negative demographi
c trends, is projected 
to remain sluggish. As a result, the unemployment 

rate is estimated to decrease further, as could be 
observed during the firs
t quarter of 2006. Active 
employment measures have st
arted to mitigate 
regional disparities.  
Given the flexibility 
of the Estonian labour market, 
and the virtual absence of automatic wage indexation, 
wages are estimated to grow broadly in line or slightly 
below productivity increases which are expected to 
remain high both in 2006 and 2007. A continuation of 

cuts in personal income 
tax rates at one percentage 
point per year over the forecast period, and a one-off

cut in the unemploymen
t insurance contribution rate in 2006 will allow net wag
es to grow more rapidly 
than gross wages, an effect also observed in recent 

years. The risk to this outlo
ok lies primarily with the 
rapid tightening of the labour market, which could 
increase wage pressures. 
Annual HICP inflation increased from 3% in 2004 to 
4.1 % in 2005, reflecting base effects from EU-
accession-related price rises (notably for fuel and 
food) in the first half of 
2005 and strong energy price 
increases in the second half of the year. Inflation 
eased to 3½ % in late 2005 
as the oil price increase 
abated, but picked up again to 4.4 % in the first 

quarter of 2006 reflecting a renewed rise of oil and 
heat energy prices. Core inflation remained at 
considerably more moderate 
levels, suggesting the absence of significant second-round effects from the 
oil price hike. A postponement of excise duty 
increases is expected to alleviate inflation. The 

forecast projects a gradual deceleration of inflation in 
2006 and 2007, with th
e headline rate settling at 
around 3% next year. This 
outlook strongly depends 
on energy price as well as exchange rate 

developments, while an increase of inflationary 
pressures due to high ec
onomic growth and a 
tightening labour market rem
ains a potential risk.  
Public finances 
Estonia's public finances are among the strongest in 
the EU. The budgetary situat
ion is forecast to remain 
comfortable over the forecast period, with general 
government surpluses hovering around 1 – 1 ½% of 

GDP despite further income tax cuts and the recently 
announced postponement of planned increases to a 
number of excise duties, namely on tobacco, alcohol 

and fuel. Government debt, already the lowest among EU 
Member States,  is forecast to decline further to 
around 3% of GDP by
 the end of 2007.

Activity in 2005 
After two years of strong economic activity, 2005 
brought a slowdown of real GDP growth, to 3.6%. 
Although the planned fiscal consolidation and the 

petering out of the ‘Olympic bonus’ has weighed on 
growth prospects, this outcome is slightly better than 
was expected last autumn. The economic slowdown 

originated in a deceleration of the domestic sector, 
while, after several years of negative contributions, 
net exports added to growth. In line with the less 

buoyant growth recorded in
 real disposable income, 
private consumption decelerated, while the strong fall 
recorded by public infrast
ructure expenditure in 
nominal terms led to a contraction of investment of 
about 1%. In spite of fiscal consolidation efforts, 
public consumption actua
lly grew above 3%. The 
positive contribution of the 
external sector to growth 
does not reflect prosperou
s exports, but rather a 
contraction of imports. Exp
orts of goods grew at 
above 8% and led to an almost 1 percentage point 
external sector contribution to
 growth, in spite of 
stagnation in exports of 
services, specially shipping. In line with the economic slowdown, employment 
decelerated, while inflation accelerated, fuelled by 

higher energy prices and still strong wage increases, 
thus further widening th
e differential with the euro-
area average. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
While the Greek economy is projected to decelerate 
marginally over the forecast horizon, significant 
changes in growth composition are expected. In 
particular, economic activity will be almost 
exclusively demand-driv
en. GDP should grow at 
3½% in 2006 (slightly less in
 2007). The combination 
of moderate wage and employment growth, leading to 

lower disposable income growt
h, and higher oil prices 
should slow down privat
e consumption. However, 
consumption will still grow above income, gradually 

lowering the households’ saving rate. Moreover, 
households’ net borrowing will rise, as housing 
investment is increasing
. In parallel, public 
consumption should not increase in 2006. Total 
investment will rebound, than
ks to the recovery of 
public infrastructure investment, while the new 

incentive laws, aiming at promoting investments, and 
the corporate tax reform should support private 
investment. In spite of this, higher profits will 

contribute to improve the corporate sector’s balance 
sheets. All in all, domestic demand is projected to 
contribute around 3½ pe
rcentage points to growth in 2006 and 3¾ in 2007
. The external sector is projected 
to be growth-neutral in 
2006, while contributing 
negatively by the end of the forecast period. Imports 
are expected to return to growth rates of about 5%. 
Although projected to grow
 at around a healthy 7% 
over the forecast period, exports of goods are not 
expected to keep pace with world trade. However, 
after the strong correction last year, exports of 

services should return to growth rates much more in 
line with long-run trends over the forecasting period. 
Also helped by an upward
 trend in tourism. As a 
result, the external deficit is pr
ojected to fall by more 
than 1 percentage point, to below 6½% of GDP by 
2007. Labour market, costs and prices 
Consistent with decelerating but still robust GDP 
growth, employment
1 is projected to grow above 1% 
per year until 2007. The un
employment rate should 
accordingly decrease by 1 percentage point to just 

below 10% by the end of the forecast period. Wages 
per head are set to rise more in 2006 and less in 2007 
compared to last year. However, since productivity is 

expected to remain stable, wage moderation should 
not result in a significant deceleration of unit labour 
costs; rather, they should increase above the euro-area 
average. Such wage developments, coupled with 
sustained domestic demand and 
higher energy prices, 
should fuel inflation, wh
ich would remain above 3¼% 
over the forecast period. As a result, real unit labour 
costs should continue on an upward trend until 2007.

Public finances 
The government deficit in 2005 was 4.5% of GDP
2.This is ¾% of GDP above the autumn 2005 forecast, 
which included one-off revenues from an announced 

securitisation operation worth 0.8% of GDP, which 
did not in the end take place. The 2005 deficit 
outcome is an improvement on 2004’s figure of above 

2¼% of GDP in nominal terms. In structural terms, 
the deficit improved from
 7¾% of GDP in 2004 to 
5¼% last year. The 2006 deficit is projected to 

decline further to just 
below 3% of GDP (the table 
shows it as 3% due to rounding). The forecast 
includes half of the 0.6% of GDP temporary one-off 

operations planned in the budget as a result of the 
need for clarification on the accounting treatment. 
However, the government has recently released a 

permanent measure amounting to 0.1% of GDP and a 
temporary measure amounting to ¼% of GDP that are 
included in the forecast. In structural terms, the 

adjustment is expend
iture-driven. Specifically, the 
measures to improve tax administration, coupled with 
the broadening of tax bases brought about by the fight 
against tax fraud and evasion, should raise revenues 

by less than ¼% of GDP. 
In parallel, expenditure will 
fall by ¾% of GDP, less than half of which is 
accounted for by the control of primary current 
spending. Overall, the stru
ctural deficit is projected to 
improve by around 1% of GDP in 2006. Assuming 
unchanged legislation, the deficit projection for 2007 

will be around 3½% of GDP, which shows that 
structural measures will be necessary to keep the 
deficit below 3% in a durable manner. Finally, at 

107.5% of GDP in 2005, the general government debt 
is projected to decrease only slightly by 2007.

of a structural and systemic nature.

(% of GDP
)Activity in 2005 
GDP growth increased in 
2005 to 3½%, from just 
above 3% in 2004. 
Economic activity was 
underpinned by dynamic domestic demand, while net 

exports continued to cont
ribute negatively to growth. 
Private consumption remain
ed robust, supported by 
strong job creation and easy
 monetary and financial 
conditions, and grew above 
real disposable income, 
thus further lowering the households’ saving rate to 
10½% in 2005, from 11% in
 2004. Easy monetary and 
financial conditions were 
also largely behind the 
recorded acceleration in household investment in 
dwellings, pushing indebtedn
ess close to 115% of 
disposable income. This 
has increased households’ 
exposure to interest rates and employment shocks. 
Investment in equipment
 also remained robust. 
Although government consumption decelerated, 
domestic demand contributed around 5½ percentage 
points to growth in 2005. 
The external sector  recorded large imbalances again. 
In 2005, its negative contribution to growth was close 
to 2 pps. Imports grew at 7% in real terms, while 
exports presented a rather flat profile, rising by a 
meagre 1%. In particular, the trade deficit increased 
by more than 1 pp of GDP to reach 7½%. Widening 

external imbalances mirror the continuous 
deterioration of the competitive position of the 
Spanish economy, asso
ciated with high
 and persistent 
inflation and productivity-growth differentials with 
the euro area. HICP rose to just below 3½%, while productivity grew marg
inally (<¼%), which compares 
with 2¼% and ½%, respectively, in the euro area. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
In 2006, GDP growth is 
projected to slightly fall, to 
3.1%. Economic activity should still be based on 
buoyant domestic demand, as, in spite of higher 

interest rate expectations, higher inflation is projected to keep real interest rates in 
the red, which, in turn, 
should push private consumption to grow above 

disposable income. As a 
result, the households' saving rate should continue on a decreasing path, declining to 
just above 9½%. In parallel,
 household debt should 
rise to around 
120% of annual 
gross disposable income. Investment is projected to remain robust, 
especially in equipment and software, whereas 

residential construction growth is expected to 
moderate. Overall, domestic demand is projected to 
contribute 4½ percentage po
ints to GDP growth this 
year.In spite of the slowdown projected for domestic 
demand, imports are expected to decelerate only 
marginally since the worsening of the competitive 
position of the Spanish industry should also affect the 
domestic market. Although export growth should 
increase to around 2% this year, compared with 1% in 
2005, deteriorating external 
competitiveness should 
keep exports growing well below world trade, thus 

further reducing export market shares. This projection 
takes account of potentially better prospects in the 
automotive sector, underpinned
 by the launch of new 
models by several car manufacturers. Overall, the 
negative contribution from net exports to GDP growth 
is projected to be close to 1¼ percentage points, while 

the trade deficit should conti
nue to widen to slightly 
61Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 Spain 
below 8½% of GDP. 
GDP is projected to furt
her slow down in 2007. 
Higher interest rate expectations should at last lead to 
positive interest rates in real terms, further 

decelerating private consumption and putting a brake 
on investment in dwellings. 
The latter should lead to a 
slight deceleration of gross fixed capital formation. 

The projected stagnation of
 residential construction 
(although at a very high activ
ity level), should be 
largely offset by stronger act
ivity in infrastructure, as 
well as in investment in equipment and software. In 
parallel, the households' 
saving rate, with gross 
disposable income growing at a similar pace as 

private consumption, should at last remain stable at 
around 9½% of disposable in
come, putting an end to a 
decreasing saving ratio since 2003. Overall, domestic 

demand would still contribute to GDP growth by 
around 3¾ percentage points. The projected deceleration of domestic demand 
should further moderate im
port growth. However, 
since no significant improvements are expected in 
terms of productivity 
growth and inflation 
differentials between Spai
n and its main trade 
partners, exports are expected to grow by only 2¼%, 
thus leading to further losses of export market shares. 

The trade deficit might peak at 9% of GDP. Overall, 
the negative contributio
n to GDP growth from the 
external sector should decrease to 1 percentage point. 
The evolution of the external accounts in 2006 and 
2007 deserves sp
ecial attention. In sp
ite of a rebound 
in 2005, declining net tou
rism inflows are expected to 
further narrow the surplus recorded by services. 

Regarding the balance of 
primary incomes, the 
projected rising deficit reflects payments stemming 
from the large cumulated 
debt of the country vis-à-vis 
its foreign lenders. The deficit in the balance of 
current transfers should increase, partially as a result 
of larger remittances abroad by migrants. The surplus 

of services is projected to just offset the aggregate 
deficits in the primary income and current transfers 
accounts. Consequently, the current account deficit 
mirrors the trade deficit and is expected to rise to 9% 
of GDP at the end of the forecast period. The net 

borrowing position vis-à-vis 
the rest of the world is 
projected to reach 8¾% of GDP in 2007, on account 
of the expected reduction of EU transfers by the end 

of the forecasting period. Since there is no evidence to 
support a rebound in foreign direct investment 
inflows, portfolio investmen
ts should continue to 
represent the main source of financing for the external 
deficit in Spain.  
There are risks to this scenario. In particular, export 
growth depends on a recovery of the automotive 
sector, which, if it fails to materialise, could weigh 
negatively on growth. Additionally, some of the 

current developments, name
ly, higher household 
indebtedness, low productiv
ity growth, persistent 
inflation differentials with the euro area and wider 

external imbalances, are risks for internal demand 
growth. However, neither so
ft nor hard data appear to 
support a sudden slowdown
 of economic activity.  
Labour market, costs and prices  
Job creation is projected to remain robust over the 
forecast period. In 2005, employment grew slightly 
above 3% (full time equivalen
t). The regularisation of 
immigrants carried out by the government during the 

first half of the year partia
lly explains the employment 
boom. In 2006 and 2007, however, job creation 
should decelerate to about 2¾% and 2¼% 
respectively, in line with 
slower economic activity, 
especially in residential construction, which accounts 

for a significant part of the new jobs created in Spain 
in the recent past. The unemployment rate should 
continue to fall over the forecast period, to around 

8¼% of the labour force by 2007. 
Following the oil price hi
ke in the first and second 
quarters of 2005, headline in
flation, measured by the 
HICP, almost reached 3½% at the end of the year, 

while core inflation remained around 2%. Since the 
increase in energy prices is expected to also have a 
significant impact this year, 
inflation is projected to 
remain at 3½% in 2006 and gradually ease to slightly 
above 3% in 2007. Structural factors such as 
insufficient competition in
 certain utilities and 
services sectors, coupled with remaining rigidities in 
the labour market, are expected to keep the inflation 
differential with the euro area well above 1 percentage 

point over the forecasting horizon. Compensation of 
employees per head is projected to grow above 3% 
until the end of the forecast period. Although the 
existing wage agreements sh
ould push wage inflation 
up, new employees entering the labour market with 

relatively low salaries should partially ease the 
pressure. As a result, wages are projected to grow by 
around 3½% in nominal terms. Therefore, real wages 
should stagnate. In any case, wages are still expected

the high and persisten

productivity growth should result in unit labour costs 

also growing above the euro-area average.  
Public finances 
In 2005, the general governmen
t registered a surplus 
above 1% of GDP. In 2006, 
a surplus of around 1% of 
GDP is projected. This is in line with the updated 

2005 Stability Programme bu
t well above the 2006 
Budget Law, which targeted a general government 
surplus of less than 
¼% of GDP. The Budget Law is 
based on underestimated revenues for 2005 with 
carry-over effects in 2006
. Revenues in 2006 should 
grow at around 7½%, thus matching nominal GDP 

growth. Regarding central 
government expenditure, 
the 2006 Budget Law give
s priority to R&D and 
infrastructure expenditure, which are projected to 

grow in nominal terms by around 30% and 12% 
respectively. Overall, total expenditures are projected 
to increase by around 7¾%, somewhat above nominal 
GDP.  In 2007, within the framework of the customary no-
policy-change scenario, government revenues are 
projected to grow at 
around 5¾%, slightly below 
nominal GDP, although this 
figure includes the 
potential effects of the direct taxation reform that has 

been enacted. Total 
expenditure is assumed to follow 
previous trends and increase at around 7%. On this 
basis, the general government 
surplus could narrow to 
around ½% of a percentage point of GDP.  
Due to primary surpluses in 
the vicinity of 2%, the 
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to continue on a 
declining path, from 43% of GDP 
in 2005 to 38% in 
2007. 638. France Growth strengthening and becoming more balanced

Activity in 2005  
In 2005, economic growth lost momentum and GDP 
grew by only 1.4% in real terms, compared with 2.1% 
in 2004. For the second consecutive year, net exports 

negatively contributed to GDP growth by about 1 
percentage point.  
Despite a strong expansion of external demand, real 
export growth remained su
bdued, while imports rose markedly (+6.6%), in response to th
e robustness of 
final demand. France could 
not fully take advantage 
of the expansion of world trade because its export 

markets expanded more slowly and its 
competitiveness deteriorated. 
Contrary to what was 
observed in the euro area as a whole, GDP growth 

was therefore still exclusively driven by domestic 
demand and especially by pri
vate consumption, which 
both increased by 2.1%. Private consumption 

remained supported by 
buoyant wage increases and 
favourable monetary and financial conditions. The 
gradual harmonisation of the minimum wage, 

implemented from 2003 onwards in the context of the 
reduction of the wo
rking week to 35 hours, still 
supported wages in 2005, 
but this process is now 
complete. Inflation was fairly moderate despite the 
surge in oil prices and also contributed to supporting 
households' purchasing 
power, while employment 
growth was disappointing (+0.2%). In a 
macroeconomic context still characterised by 

uncertainties, firms remained
 cautious with respect to 
their hiring and investme
nt plans. Nevertheless, 
boosted by favourable financi
al conditions, residential 
construction accelerated in 2004.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007  
Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate somewhat 
in 2006 to return to its 
potential in 2007. Economic 
activity should be 
more balanced: although GDP 
growth is expected to still be largely driven by 
domestic demand, over the forecast period the 
contribution of net exports  
to GDP growth should be 
less negative and turn neut
ral by the end of 2007. 
Private consumption is forecast to remain the main 
driving force of economic growth, based on an 
expected recovery in employ
ment. Consumption will 
increase in line with households' disposable income, 
reflecting the expected rise in the demand for labour. 
The projected benign inflation outlook should also 

support households’ purchasing power. Moreover, 
consumer spending would be supported by a still 
quite strong housing market.  
Investment in equipment is expected to slightly 
decelerate in 2006 due to a continued deterioration of 
corporate margins a
nd a capacity utilisation which 
remains below its long-term 
average. In 2007, this 
tendency is likely to be reversed due to a more 
positive economic outlook, 
continuing supportive 
financing conditions and the retention of lower tax 
rates on new capital expenditure. In contrast, 
investment in construction is forecast to remain 

buoyant over the forecast period, thanks to historically 
favourable mortgage fin
ancing conditions.  After a loss in export market shares in 2005 for the 
third consecutive year, export volumes are projected 

to increase again more in lin
e with the expansion of 
external demand in connection with the improvement 
64Chapter 3 Member States, France in price competitiveness linked to the past 
depreciation of the euro and to a somewhat stronger 
impulse from France’s main trading partners (notably 

Germany and Italy). In th
is context, and although 
imports are forecast to remain buoyant  as a result of 
robust final demand, the neg
ative contribution of net 
exports to GDP growth will diminish over time.  
Labour markets, costs and prices 
In 2005, employment growth barely reached 0.2%. 
Uncertainties concerning the durability of the 
recovery and the traditional lag with which 
employment reacts to economic activity largely 
explain the current weakness 
in employment growth. 
In 2006 and 2007, employme
nt growth is set to 
gradually strengthen in response to better economic 
prospects over the forecast horizon. The recovery of 
employment should also be 
stimulated by the 
implementation of the “em
ergency employment plan” 
announced in June 2005
 which aims at facilitating 
recruitment by small companies and encouraging 

people to return to work. 
Given the still high 
unemployment rate, wage 
moderation is expected to c
ontinue. Nevertheless, a 
slight cyclical acceleration in wages is expected to 
occur over the forecast horizon, driven by the 
improvement of the situation in the labour market. As 

productivity growth is expected to decelerate from the 
high rate observed in 20
04, unit labour
 costs should 
rise by 2% in 2006 and 2007. Coupled with some 

second-round and indirect effects from high 
commodity prices, core inflation is thus projected to 
pick up gradually. Neverth
eless, since it is difficult for 
companies to fully pass th
e increase in commodity 
prices onto final customers due
 to strong competition 
from low-cost countries, 
the rise in prices of 
manufactured goods will be 
modest. Although growth 
is expected to be firmer, inflationary pressures should 
remain subdued due to the persistent negative output 

gap. In this context, HICP inflation should be slightly 
below 2% in 2006 and in 2007. 
Public finances 
Following a decline from 4.2% to 3.7% of GDP in 
2004
1, the general government deficit was further 
reduced to 2.9% in 2005, ma
inly thanks to substantial 
one-off revenues for a total amount of 0.6% of GDP, 

in connection with the 
inclusion of the specific 
electricity and gas companies’ pension schemes in the 
general regime (0.5% of
 GDP) and exceptional 
revenues from the December 2005 change in the 
corporate tax code which brought forward revenue 

initially planned to be co
llected in 2006 (0.1% of 
GDP). The budgetary outturn also benefited from 
stronger-than-expected tax re
ceipts notably linked to 
the strong performance of housing and asset prices. 
The ratio of total revenues 
to GDP increased by 1.5 
percentage point to 51.
0% of GDP, while the tax 
burden rose by a full percentag
e point to 44.1% of 
GDP. On the expenditure side, targets were respected 
at the State level and for health-care expenditures; 

nevertheless total public expenditure overshot the official target, mainly due to slippages in local 
governments and other 
social security funds' 
expenditures. All in all, 
the expenditure-to-GDP ratio 
increased by 0.7 percentage point of GDP to 53.9%. 
For 2006, the government deficit is expected to 
slightly increase to 3.0% of GDP. Expenditure growth 

is anticipated to 
slow down somewh
at, mainly thanks 
to a deceleration in health-care expenditure and other 
social benefits. On the revenue side,  notably the 
personal income tax, property 
tax and tax on interest 
earnings (especially due to a 
strong housing and stock 
exchange performance) 
should boost revenues. This 
should lead to an 
elasticity of tax revenues-to-GDP 
above the long-term average of one but somewhat 

lower than the high elasticity registered in 2005. This 
forecast incorporates new measures included in the 
budget for 2006 (notably increases in social 

contributions resulting from 
the implementation of the 
2004 health-care reform, increases in local taxes, 
lower tax rates on ne
w capital expenditure, an 
increase in the employment premium), which 
contribute to increase the tax burden to 44.2% of 
GDP. The forecast also incorporates one-off revenues 

of about ¼% of GDP in
 connection with the transfer 
to social security of pension commitments vis-à-vis 
the postal sector employees and the exceptional 

collection of social contributions on specific saving 
plans that were to be collected at a latter stage. The 
general government deficit forecast is slightly above 
that contained in the Marc
h 2006 French
 government 
notification (2.8% of GDP), mainly due to somewhat 

higher expenditures in the areas of health and local 
government. Concerning 
health-care expenditure, 
while the 2004 health-care reform has noticeably 

curbed expenditure, the expected dynamics (an annual 
increase in spending of 3.2% in 2006) are  forecast to 
be somewhat higher than assumed by the government

(2.5%) based on a prudent assessment of some of the 
measures announced in the 20
06 budget bill for social 
security. The Commission services' 2006 deficit 

forecast implies no change in the cyclical balance and 
a slight improvement in the structural balance (CAB 
net of one-offs). 
The deficit forecast for 2007, 3.1% of GDP, follows 
the conventional assumption of unchanged policies. It 
thus takes only account of already decided measures 
such as (i) the income 
tax reform, (ii) the increase in 
the employment premium and in the income tax 
allowance for children, an
d (iii) lower tax rates on 
new capital expenditures, 
which will, altogether, 
negatively impact the deficit by about ¼% of GDP. 
Moreover, the forecast assumes a rebound in local 
investment linked to upcoming local elections in 2008 

(as observed in the past). Th
e implementation of the 
unchanged policy assumption implies that the forecast 
does not include the 
new expenditure rules and 
ceilings for the sub-sectors of
 the general government 
as announced in the 2006
 update of the stability 
programme, and notably the new rule of a decrease in 
the State expenditure by 1% 
in volume terms (about -
0.15% of GDP), as details are only expected to be 
presented by the Prime Minister in June. 
Following an increase by 2.
3% of GDP in 2005, the 
debt-to-GDP ratio would only slightly rise over the 

forecast horizon thanks to the allocation of 
privatisation receipts to debt reduction. In 2006, 
receipts are linked to the motorway companies' 

privatisation (EUR 11 bn) and for 2007 the forecast 
includes EUR 7.5 bn of receipts, i.e. the middle of the 
announced range presented in the 2006 update of the 

stability programme.                                                           
1In 2004 the deficit was reduced by 0.1% of GDP thanks to some 
advanced (one-off) payments ma
de by EDF and Cogema (both 
government-owned companies) to the 
general government for the 
decommissioning of an old nuclear power plant.

Activity in 2005 
According to the preliminary national accounts, real 
GDP is estimated to have grown by 4.7% in 2005, 
slightly up from 4.5% in the previous year. In contrast 

to the recent past, econom
ic activity in 2005 was 
driven by buoyant domestic demand while the 
external economy was a drag on growth. On the 

domestic side, private consumption growth picked up 
strongly from more muted levels in previous years, 
but the increase remained b
elow the gains in real 
disposable income. Fixed invest
ment is estimated to 
have expanded at a two-digit rate, mirroring 
exceptionally strong demand fo
r equipment (inter alia 
including some one-off purchases of aircraft) and a 
buoyant construction sector. On the external side, 
exports posted a subdued 
performance by historical 
standards, reflecting a somewhat less favourable 
trading environment and a relatively weak 
performance of the chemical sector (in particular in 

the first half of the year). 
Imports strengthened in the 
course of the year in line 
with the pick-up of 
consumer demand and fixed capital formation.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
GDP is projected to grow by around 5% in both 2006 
and 2007, close to the rate commonly thought to be 
sustainable in the medium
 term. Domestic demand 
growth is expected to
 remain very solid. Private 
consumption is expected to accelerate further in 2006 
and 2007, supported by healthy employment growth 

and notably by the release of SSIA funds (a 
government-sponsored saving scheme) into the 
economy. The growth of fixed 
investment is projected 
to moderate over the forecast period. Housing 
investment is forecast to taper off somewhat in 2007, 
as the high volumes of completions are not expected 

to be repeated. However, part of the downward 
correction in the residential sector is expected to be 
offset by strong in
frastructure investment and commercial construction. On th
e external side, both 
merchandise and service expor
ts are projected to put 
in a somewhat stronger pe
rformance th
an in 2005. 
Import growth is projected to pick up in 2006 and 
2007, in line with the acceleration in private 
consumption expenditure. As net profit outflows are 

expected to remain on an upward trend, the implied 
growth rate of gross natio
nal income is somewhat 
lower than that of GDP.  
While the most recent data suggest that robust growth 
of the Irish economy will continue, recent trends also 
reveal that growth has become somewhat imbalanced. 
On the external side, recent export weakness and 

competitiveness pressures expo
se the economy's 
sensitivity to changes in 
the global economic 
environment, especially to
 trends in international 
activity (notably sector-specific developments) and 
the euro/dollar exchange rate. On the domestic side, 
the extended residential construction boom and 
accelerating house prices, coupled with the significant 
increases in household indebtedness, are noteworthy 

risks to the economy over the medium term. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Labour market performance was extremely robust in 
2005, with employment est
imated to have grown by 
4¾% on the year. In line with the strong performance 

of the services sector, partly offset by some easing in 
construction output, employment gains will be 
somewhat weaker but still remain
 very robust over the 
forecast horizon. Labour force growth, fuelled by 
significant inward migrat
ion (notably from the 
recently acceded EU Member States) and increased 

participation, is projected to
 keep pace with the 
upward employment trend. The unemployment rate is 
thus estimated to remain under 4½% in 2006 and 
2007. In the light of a lower contribution from 
benchmarking pay awards to 
public sector employees 
(i.e. the alignment of public 
sector wages with private 
sector equivalents), despite the relatively tight labour 
market conditions, the growth in per capita 
compensation is estimated to
 fall below 5% over the 
forecast period. HICP inflation picked up somewhat

in the first quarter of 2006, partly reflecting adverse 
energy developments. The annual rate is nevertheless 
expected to moderate in the second half of 2006 due 

to a base effect, before rising sli
ghtly again into 2007 
in line with the projected
 pick-up in private 
consumption. CPI inflati
on is expected to be above 
that of HICP over the forecast period, in line with the 
expected increase of average mortgage repayments. 
Public finances     
In 2005 the general government balance is estimated 
to have been in surp
lus by 1.0% of GDP. This 
favourable outturn is mainly due to higher-than-
expected tax receipts and partly to lower-than-
budgeted expend
itures, especially on capital outlays. As regards the budget for 2006, the main measures on 
the revenue side include an upward adjustment of the 
standard tax band for personal income and some 

further relief through an in
crease in the employee tax 
credit. On the expenditure side, the social welfare 
package is somewhat more generous than in 2005. A 
significant rise in capital spending is also foreseen for 
2006 and 2007, focusing in particular on 

improvements in tran
sport infrastructure. The public 
finances are expected to remain strong, with the 
general government balance forecast to post a small 

surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 20
06 before turning into a 
deficit of 0.4% of GDP 
in 2007. However, the 
macroeconomic risks, if realised, 
have the potential to 
push the public finances into a larger deficit than 
forecast. Given the non-indexed nature of the tax and 
social benefit systems, the no-policy-change 

assumption for 2007 is made operational, in the 
absence of previously announced measures, by 
freezing average tax rates and adjusting social transfer 

payments by the forecast CPI inflation rate (with a 
small top-up). Government debt is projected to 
stabilise at around 27% of GDP over the forecast 

period.

Activity in 2005 
Following a mild recovery
 in 2004, real GDP 
stagnated again in 2005 as it did in 2002 2003. This 
confirmed the structural weakness of the Italian 

economy, in a period of global upswing.  
Private consumption was ve
ry weak and investment 
contracted. Persistent difficulties in public finances 
may have affected economic actors' confidence. The 

contribution of domestic demand to economic growth 
was marginally positive only thanks to increasing 
government consumption. On the external side, real 

exports continued to record a 
large loss of market 
shares and net exports acted as a drag on GDP 
growth.   
Employment, measured in full-time equivalent terms, 
which had held up well duri
ng the previous years of 
feeble economic growth, decreased in 2005, for the 
first time since 1994. However, the increase in head 

count employment recorded by the Labour Force 
Surveys continued to be surprisingly solid, mainly 
reflecting immigrants' regularisation.   
HICP inflation averaged 
2.2%, in line with 
that in the 
euro area, although the impact of higher energy prices 
was less pronounced. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Signs of an improving 
short-term outlook started 
materialising only at the end of 2005, when industrial 
production and orders rebounded after the unexpected 
fall recorded in early autumn. However, this did not 

prevent a flat real GDP in the last quarter of 2005, 
which implies a weaker carryov
er into 2006 than 
assumed in the autumn 2005 forecasts. On the back of 
improving business confidence and increasing 

industrial production, real GDP is expected to 
accelerate in the first part of 2006, with quarterly rises 
slightly above potential. On an annual basis, the 

economy is projected to 
expand by 1.3% in 2006, 
before decelerating slightly to 1.2% in 2007 due to the 
impact of increasing oil prices.  
Over 2006-2007, the recovery is expected to be 
largely driven by domest
ic demand, while the 
contribution to economic 
growth from net exports is 
expected to be broadly neutral.  
After the negative reading
 at the end of 2005, private 
consumption is projected to regain steam already at 
the beginning of 2006. Underpinned by a revival of 
job creation and nominal wages growing above 

inflation, private consumption should expand by 1.0% 
and 1.1% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The 
households' saving rate is 
expected to remain stable. 
Public consumption is projected to decelerate due to 
the effects of th
e 2006 budget. Incr
eased confidence 
and stronger demand prospect
s should trigger a pick 
up in investment, which 
should also be supported by 
still favourable financial 
conditions, in spite of rising 
interest rate expectations. Companies will also benefit 
from the reduction in the employers' social 
contribution rate of up to 1% implemented in the 2006 

budget. Following th
e fall recorded in 
2005, public investment is expected to rebound. Overall, gross 
fixed capital formation is 
expected to represent the 
most dynamic component of domestic demand and 
should provide a positive contribution to GDP growth

of ½% both in 2006 and in 2007. 
Concerning the external sec
tor, exports are set to 
accelerate in real terms. However, they will expand at 
only around half the pace assumed in corresponding 

export markets, due to
 persistent competitiveness 
problems, partly related to
 structural shortcomings 
like the product specialisation 
of the Italian economy. 
After the high elasticity to final
 demand recorded in 
2005, imports are assumed to grow in line with their 
long term elasticity over 2006 2007.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
The projected economic uptur
n in 2006 and 2007 
should push employment up again, even when 
measured in full-time equivalents. Nevertheless, the 
labour content of economic 
growth is expected to be 
lower than in the recent past, as the effects of labour 
market reforms introduced since the mid 1990s seem 
to be fading away. The unemployment rate is 

projected to remain stable at 7¾% in both 2006 and 
2007.  On the back of more 
favourable cyclical conditions, 
but still constrained by 
low specialisation in high 
technology/growth sector
s, labour productivity is 
forecast to increase by 1% both in 2006 and 2007, 

approaching rates more consi
stent with historical 
figures. Higher labour pr
oductivity growth together 
with the projected deceleration of wage costs in the 

private sector, which should also be curbed by the 
reduction in social contributions
, should result in a 
slowdown of unit labour costs. This would  have a 

positive impact on the competitive position of the 
Italian economy, especially vis-à-vis non-EU 
countries, and mitigate some
what the loss of market 
shares in 2006 and 2007.  
The more moderate unit labour costs growth will also 
contribute to keeping core inflation below 2% over 
2006-2007. However, on the back
 of higher oil prices, 
headline HICP inflation is expected to remain above 
2% in 2006 and to 
fall to 2.0% in 2007. 
Public finances 
In 2005, the deficit 
increased to 4.1% of GDP, up 
from 3.4% of GDP in 2004
1. The primary surplus 
shrank to a meagre 0.5% of GDP, from 1.3% in 2004. 
Interest expenditure, including swap-related savings, 

dropped by around 0.2% of GDP. The budgetary 
impact of one-offs declined to around ½ of a 
percentage point of GDP, from about 1¼% in 2004. 
The structural balance, i.e. the cyclically adjusted 
deficit excluding one-off measures, improved by more 

than ½% of GDP. The primary structural surplus 
increased by nearly ½% of GDP. 
In 2006, the general government deficit is forecast to 
remain stable at 4.1% of GDP. The impact of one-off 

measures (sales of real estate and revenues from taxes 
on the revaluations of corporations' assets and tax 
amnesties) is expected to diminish further to ¼ of a 

percentage point of GDP. 
Increased interest rates and 
the rising government debt 
would prevent a further 
reduction of interest expenditure, which is projected 

to remain broadly stable at around 4½ % of GDP. The 
primary surplus would remain at around ½% of GDP. 
Net of cyclical factors and excluding one-off 

measures, both the deficit and the primary balance are 
projected to improve by slightly less than ¼ of a 
percentage point of GDP, thus well below the ¾ 

recommended by the Council in its recommendation 
under Article 104(7).  
The 4.1% of GDP deficit forecast for 2006 contrasts 
with the official projections in the 
2005 update of the 
stability programme, which 
targeted a 3.5% of GDP 
deficit this year, assuming the full implementation of 

the 2006 and previous Budget Laws. However, 
despite the better than exp
ected 2005 
deficit outturn, 
on 5 April, the Ministry of Economy and Finance 

revised the official deficit forecast upward, to 3.8% of 
GDP, which mainly reflects expenditure overruns. 
Given the record of regular overruns, confirmed by 
the new official forecast, the Commission services are 

more prudent in their assessment of the size of 
savings foreseen in the 
2006 Budget Law through 
substantial cuts on health care and other government 

expenditure, in particu
lar of local government. 
Moreover, in accordance with the new official 
forecast of 5 April, the lack of implementation of the 

measures on public employment envisaged in 
previous budgets would lead to higher expenditure for 
compensation of employees. On the revenue side, 
Commission projections are overall in
 line with those 
in the Budget Law, 
except for the additional revenue to be realised by regions having a structural deficit in 
health care accounts, as the procedures necessary to 
trigger this increase have not yet been fully 

implemented.

Concerning the risks linked to the Commission 
projections for public finance, the new mechanisms to 
enforce the ambitious expenditure cuts foreseen in the 

2006 budget might tu
rn out to be more effective than 
assumed. However, the Commission services forecast 
already incorporates a sizeable share of such savings, 

which might prove challenging to achieve. In 
addition, the large cuts 
in transfers to State-owned 
railways and road maintenance companies planned in 

the Budget Law might be difficult to sustain given 
their current financial needs. Finally, the new tax agreement with self-employed professionals and small 

firms still needs to be put in place. The forecast for a 
2007 deficit of 4.5% of GDP is based on the 
customary no policy chan
ge scenario and mainly 
reflects higher interest expenditure and no one-off 
measures.In 2005, the government debt ratio increased for the 
first time in ten years, to
 attain 106½% of GDP, up 
from 103¾% in 2004. This was the result of the 
combined effect of stag
nation and the very low 
primary surplus. Debt
-increasing financial 
transactions amounted to around 1¼% of GDP, of 

which ½% of investment in liquid assets. Privatisation 
receipts dropped to 0.3% of GDP in 2005, from 0.6% 
in 2004.  The government debt ratio is forecast to increase 
again in 2006 by around 1% of GDP. This forecast 
incorporates the high cash borrowing requirement 
estimated in the new official forecast released on 5 

April and includes privatisati
on receipts amounting to 
around ¾ of a percentage point
 of GDP as planned in 
the 2005 stability programme. 
Based on the no-
policy-change scenario and the stock-flow adjustment 
planned in the 2005 stab
ility programme, the debt-to-
GDP ratio should further increase by ¼% in 2007. 
                                                          
1On 1 March 2006 the government deficit was revised by around 
0.2% of GDP for all the years 
from 2002 to 2004. The upward 
revision of nominal GDP has substantially reduced the debt ratio.

Cyprus - Unemployment rate, real wage

Activity in 2005 
Despite posting a slight deceleration compared with 
2004, real GDP growth in Cyprus remained buoyant 
last year at 3.8%. This seems 
to confirm that the 
Cypriot economy has rec
overed the strength it 
enjoyed prior to the deceleration cycle in 2002-2003, 
in spite of the recent oil price hike, which does not 

seem to have had a significant impact on activity. 
Growth was mainly driven by domestic demand, 
which contributed 3¾ percentage points. Compared 

with the previous year, 
private consumption 
decelerated significantly, after a surge recorded in 
2004 associated with one-off factors (reduction in car 

excise), but still attain
ed a healthy growth of 4¾%. 
Despite the ongoing consolid
ation of public finances, 
public consumption showed a marginal but positive 

real growth of ½%, whereas it
 had contracted in 2004. 
The strong deceleration recorded by public infrastructure expenditure, wh
ich contracted by about 
13.5%, was not fully compensat
ed by buoyant private 
investment in constru
ction. As a result, total investment growth in real terms recorded a sharp 
slowdown, to just above 
2½% (10% in 2004).  The 
contribution to GDP growth of net exports was still 

negative (
 of a percentage po
int), although much 
less so than in 
2004 when it dragg
ed growth down by 
3½ points. Despite the relativ
ely poor performance of tourism revenue, which led to a deceleration of 
exports, the reduction in the 
negative contribution of 
the net exports was actually driven by the sharp 

slowdown recorded by im
ports, partially caused by 
decelerating domestic demand. As a result, the 
external account deficit increased only marginally, to 
about 5¾% of GDP.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Cyprus' economy is projected to continue growing 
solidly at 3.8% over the forecast horizon. 
Consequently, the output gap is set to almost close by 

2007, while it was in neg
ative territory since 2003. 
Growth is expected to be mainly driven by domestic 
demand. Private consumption growth is foreseen to 

remain on a declining path 
slightly above 4% in 2006, 
but 3½% in 2007. Th
is is the result of a more 
moderate wage growth, and 
the fading-out of tax 
reforms introduced in 2004
, in particular excise duties 
on cars, that boosted priva
te consumption growth to 
unusually high levels. Pu
blic consumption is 
projected to rebound in 
real terms to nearly 2% in 
2006. Investment should recover, and grow by about 
5% per year over the forecasting horizon. This 

expansion of investment in 2006 should be mainly led 
by construction, in par
ticular housing, on account 
partly of a strong demand for dwellings by non-

residents. In 2007, although 
rising prices should ease 
demand pressures in the housing market, higher 
investment in machinery and equipment, driven by 
confidence effects in the process of joining the euro 
area, should sustain investment. 
The external sector is projected to be broadly growth-
neutral until the end of th
e forecast period. Imports 
are expected to rebound to growth rates of above 6%, 
which is not only more con
sistent with past trends in 
import penetration than those recorded last year, but is 
also the result of the much higher investment 
projected, particularly in equipment. Based on a 

stronger growth outlook for the EU and other main 
trading partners, export growth should also recover. 
Specifically, exports of goods should increase by 

above 6½% in both years, 
mainly driven by buoyant 
re-export activity. In parallel, the improvement of 
prospects in the tourism sector should give a boost to 

services. The external account deficit is projected to 
remain broadly constant above 5½% of GDP for the 
forecast period.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Consistent with sustaine
d GDP growth, employment 
is projected to keep growing at around 1½% per year 
until 2007. As a result, unempl
oyment is expected to 
remain around its current levels for the forecast 
period. Although labou
r market conditions will

remain tight, increasing share of foreign workers, 
combined with moderate wag
e growth in the public 
sector, should ease wage pressure. Wage growth 

should moderate to 3½%. Since productivity growth 
is expected to rise to slightly 
above 2½% by 2007, 
unit labour costs will keep 
on rising, but at lower rates 
than in the recent past. Buoyant domestic demand, 
healthy wage growth and rising oil prices, are 
expected to lead 
inflation to 2.4% in 
2006, and to 
2.2% by 2007. Mone
tary conditions appear stable, although slightly restrictive, which 
is helping to keep 
inflation under control, while the ex
change rate with 
the Euro remains broadly constant.  
Public finances 
The government deficit in 2005 was 2.4% of GDP; 
this outcome represents an improvement of around 
1¾% of GDP compared with 2004. This deficit 

reduction is attributed to
 the better-than-expected 
impact of the tax amnesty and the effect of other 
structural consolidation measu
res, on both the expenditure and the revenue sides. Indirect taxes were 
supported by the growth composition, especially 

private consumption. One-off revenues, mainly from 
the tax amnesty, amounted to almost 1% of GDP, a 
similar figure to that of
 2004. As a result, the 
structural deficit is estimated to have improved by 2% 
of GDP, from about 5% in 2004 to 3% last year. The 
2006 deficit is projected above 2% of GDP, slightly 

higher than the official targ
et, and at around 2¼% in 
structural terms. The adjustment 
projected for 2006 is 
based on structural cuts in current primary 

expenditure, savings on interest expenditure and a 
combination of structural and one-off measures 
(amounting to ¼% of GDP) on the revenue side. In 

2007, the customary no-policy-change scenario 
projects a deficit of 2% of GDP. The general 
government debt is projected to continue the declining 

path initiated in 2004 and to reach 67¾% in 2007.

Activity in 2005 
According to preliminary national accounts, real GDP 
growth reached an all-time high, registering a 10.2% 
annual growth rate which pu
shed output even further 
above potential. Virtually every sector experienced 
growth. Domestic demand growth remained high and 
external demand accelerated. Consumer demand, 

fuelled by better credit access and significant 
increases in real disposable income, continued to 
expand at a steady rate. Retail sales growth exceeded 

20% throughout the year; sales
 grew most strongly in 
the non-food sector with buoyant spending on 
durables correlating with a real estate boom. 

Investment grew at a very
 fast rate, reflecting strong 
demand for equipment and c
ontinued buoyancy in the 
construction sector. Export 
performance in 2005 was 
particularly robust. Export values grew by more than 
30%, outpacing imports, which grew by around 25%; 
in real terms, the respective growth rates were 21% 

and 13%. Even though the external deficit remained 
very large, the external gr
owth contributio
n turned positive for the first time since 2000. 
The economy’s momentum is 
supported by significant 
EU funds-related activity, increased labour 
participation and declinin
g unemployment.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Growth prospects for 2006-2007 are strong, with an 
expected expansion of about 8½% in 2006 and 7½% 
in 2007. Given the alread
y wide positive estimated 
output gap, there is a non-neglig
ible risk to sustaining 
growth at such a rapid rate.
 Since strong investment 
expansion is the main contributor to the increase in 
estimated potential, the fo
recast is predicated on the 
quality of investment being adequate in terms of 
enabling real productivity gains. 
If the investment mix 
were inappropriate there 
would be significant 
downward risks to the sustai
nability of expansion at 
the rates foreseen, with potential labour problems 

(shortage and high cost level) adding to the risk. 
Expansion of final domestic
 demand is expected to 
continue to drive overall growth, primarily led by 
investment, with hou
sing construction increasing 
strongly. Private consumption is also expected to 
remain strong, largely because of employment 
growth, substantially higher real wages and better 

credit access. The external contribution will again turn 
negative. While the high levels of investment in 
equipment and production facilities will underpin 

export growth, the relatively 
high base level and some 
short-term saturation of fo
reign markets will moderate 
export expansion to rates below those achieved in 

2005. Import growth is expected to remain robust, 
only slightly down on 200
5, partly due to the increase 
in investment and inputs 
for intermediate goods. 
Thus, the current account deficit will remain at 
roughly the same ratio to GDP throughout the forecast 

period. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
High growth has contributed to reducing 
unemployment and boosting em
ployment. In line with 
the projected expansion of construction output and 

strong performance of the 
service sector, employment 
gains are expected to rema
in robust in 2006 and 2007 
while annual productivity growth will remain of the 

order of 7-8%. Labour for
ce growth, after taking 
account of significant outward migration (chiefly to 
the old EU Member States) and negative demographic 

trends, is projected to remain 
negligible, though the 
activity rate should 
rise somewhat. The 
unemployment rate is estimated to decrease steadily. 

Per capita compensation will continue to increase 
strongly. Throughout 2005 a sharp pi
ck-up in inflation was 
reflected in all indices, with that for producer prices 
outpacing consumer prices. Several factors 
contributed, food prices the mo
st, followed by energy 
and administered prices. The main risk to the inflation 
outlook is that price increases could become persistent 
if strong demand continues to drive output further 

above potential and feeds 
into inflation expectations.

Taking this into account, the current prospects are for 
HICP inflation for 2006 of around 6½%, and only 
modestly lower in 2007. 
Public finances 
Generally, owing to the strong growth, fiscal targets 
have been met or even exceeded. The budget results 
for 2005 were significantly
 better than expected and 
the resulting general governmen
t surplus of 0.2% of 
GDP was surprising
, not least in light of a cash-based 
estimate of a deficit of 1% 
of GDP (the difference 
stemming mostly from the cash-accrual adjustment 

for EU funds). The deficit is expected to remain at 
around 1% of GDP in 2006
-2007 (well within the 
official targets of 1½%), though for 2006 this is 

predicted upon no mid-year budget re-opening to 
increase expenditure as has been common in previous 
years. Government debt is 
projected to drop just 
below 11% of GDP at the end of the forecast period.

Activity in 2005 
GDP growth is estimated to have reached 7.5% in 
2005, exceeding the autumn forecast by half a 
percentage point and supp
orted mainly by domestic 
demand. Household consump
tion remained very firm, 
on the back of a rapid expansion of bank credit, 
increasing employment and 
strong wage growth. A 
slowdown of investment activity in the first half of 
2005 proved tempor
ary. In the year as a whole, 
investment grew at double-di
git rates for the fifth 
consecutive year. Exports regained momentum after 
two years of relatively low gro
wth and led to a 
considerably lower drag on gro
wth from net trade. 
Prospects in 2006 and 2007 
The outlook for growth in 2006 and 2007 remains 
favourable. GDP growth is 
projected to gradually 
slow down but to remain robust at above 6%. 
Domestic demand is expected to remain the main 

driver, though contributing m
ore moderately than in 
2005. Investment activity is forecast 
to remain buoyant, 
aided by EU funds and favourable financial 
conditions, as real interest rates are expected to 
remain low. Disposable income growth is expected to 

increase, on the back of rapid wage growth and the 
reduction of the personal inco
me tax in July 2006. 
This, together with high bank credit growth, is likely 

to continue to stimulate high consumption. 
The outlook for exports 
is benign, reflecting positive 
prospects for Lithuania's ma
jor trading partners. The 
outlook for international trade 
remains favourable and 
strong demand from Russia and other CIS countries is 
expected to persist. It is also
 assumed that Lithuania’s 
export capacity will improve due to the high increase 

of investment in previous years. 
Import growth is forecast to remain robust, on the 
back of buoyant private co
nsumption and investment 
activity. The contribution of net trade to growth is 

expected to remain negative, though less than in 
previous years. As in the last two years, a projected 
improvement in the terms of trade is likely to contain 

the trade deficit. The current account deficit is 
expected to increase to some 7.4% of GDP by 2007, 
while Lithuania’s net borrowing position in the 

balance of payments will be less negative due to the 
positive impact of increasing EU capital transfers. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
The labour market ti
ghtened in 2005. 
The labour force declined, which partly reflects emigration flows, 

while the imbalance between supply and demand in 
several sectors persisted and may have created 
upward pressures on labour costs. Employment 
growth picked up strongly, while the unemployment 
rate declined markedly, to
 about 8%. Structural 
unemployment remains high, with long-term 
unemployment significantly above the EU average. 
Looking forward, employment 
growth is anticipated 
to remain positive over the forecast period, although 

lower than in 2005. Unempl
oyment is anticipated to 
decrease below 7% towards the end of 2007. The 
labour market is likely to tighten further and nominal 

wage growth is expected to remain high. 
Nevertheless, the decrease in the personal income tax 
rate in July 2006, from 33% to 27% could slow down 

wage growth relative to 2005
, reducing the gap with 
productivity growth and to some extent moderating 
the impact on unit labour costs. 
Annual average HICP inflation increased to 2.7% in 
2005, mostly reflecting rising energy, health care, 
transport and food prices. HICP 
inflation in the first 
quarter of 2006 was on average 3.3%. The inflation 

outlook for 2006-2007 has been revised upwards 
compared to the autumn forecast. From January 2006, 
Lithuania’s single gas su
pplier (Gazprom) increased 
wholesale gas prices by some 40%. This was not 
included in the headline projection in autumn, and 

was only considered an
 upward risk. Central heating 
prices, which are regulated, have not been fully

adjusted yet and thus the main impact on consumer 
prices is expected in the second half of the year. 
Additional upward pressure
 on prices in 2006 may 
come from the external environment, as import prices 
are assumed to remain high and a slight depreciation 
of the litas against the 
US dollar is anticipated. High 
wage growth is forecast to continue and expected to 
put pressure on unit labou
r costs. Against this 
background, annual average inflation in 2006 is 

projected to edge up to 
3.5%. In 2007, inflation is 
expected to decline slightly but remain above 3%. A 
significantly lower increase in import prices is likely 

to ease pressures on inflation, while the impact of 
higher gas prices is expected to
 be an offsetting factor. 
The evolution of oil prices and their impact on 

inflation, together with a reacti
on of wages and prices 
to demand growth, are the main risks for the 
projections. Excise duty adjustments foreseen in 

Lithuania's accession treaty may also lead to 
significantly higher in
flation than projected. 
Public finances 
The general government deficit decreased to 0.5% of 
GDP in 2005, well below the initial government target 
and the Commission services’ autumn forecast. The 
more favourable outcome st
ems from a virtuous 
budgetary execution at al
l levels of government, 
which recorded higher-tha
n-planned revenues while 
expenditure plans were broadly achieved. Assuming 
that the budget will be strictly implemented, the 
deficit is forecast to remain 
rather stable in 2006 on 
the back of strong revenue growth and improved tax 
collection. The impact of the tax reform, which is 
included in the budget for 
2006, is likely to be broadly neutral in 2006 but negative in 2007 which, together 
with the increasing 
costs of the pension reform and 
other expenditure, is expected to raise the deficit to 

close to 1% of GDP. The general government debt is 
anticipated to remain low at close to 19% of GDP in 
the forecast period.

% of GDP
Activity in 2005  
The Luxembourg economy performed rather well in 
2005: real GDP growth probably reached between 4 
and 4½%, about the same 
rate as in 2004, which is, 
however, below the average of the last 10 years 
(5.2%).  Growth in 2005 was chiefly supported by 
external trade in services, the exports and imports of 

which both rose by more 
than 10% in real terms : the 
activity in the fin
ancial sector was buoyant thanks to 
the good health of financi
al markets and tourism 
benefited from the Luxembourg presidency of the EU 
in the first half of the year. On
 the other hand, like in 
2004, domestic demand was rather subdued in 2005, 

with private consumption only growing by about 
1½% : although unemployment remains relatively low 
by EU standards, it has considerably risen in recent 

years, which probably explains the deterioration in 
consumer confidence all along the year 2005. 
Moreover, as non-resident workers, whose 

consumption in Luxembourg is smaller than that of 
residents, accounted for about two-thirds of domestic 
employment growth in recent years, a large and rising 
part of the increase in the wage bill is spent abroad. 
As a result, retail trade stagnated, even if a significant 

improvement was visible in the second half of the 
year. Similarly, activity in the 
construction sector 
decreased due to the weakness of investment by 

enterprises and the govern
ment but some signs of 
recovery could be observed towards the end of the 
year.  In total, gross fixed
 capital formation hardly 
grew by more than 2%. On the other hand, 
government consumption was 
buoyant, rising by 
nearly 7% in real terms.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
GDP growth is expected to remain in the 
neighbourhood of 4½% in 2006 and 2007. The 
external sector will probably 
be less supportive than 
in 2005: exports of goods are projected to accelerate 
in 2006 in line with 
the strengthening of exports 
market growth but exports of services, though 

remaining vigorous, could slow down somewhat after 
the strong growth recorded in 2005. On the other 
hand, domestic demand should be more dynamic than 

in recent years. Despite the projected rise in 
unemployment, private consumption should 
accelerate somewhat thanks to non negligible wage 

increases and a projected acceleration in resident 
employment. Similarly, i
nvestment by enterprises, 
which has been rather subdued in 2004 and 2005, 

should also accelerate. The more dynamic domestic 
demand should also lead to an acceleration in imports, 
at least in 2006, which expl
ains in part why external 
trade is expected to be less supportive. 
Labour market, costs and prices  
Reflecting the strong growt
h in output, employment 
rose by about 3% in 2005. However, unemployment 

kept rising, reaching 5.3%, 
so that the Grand-Duchy 
no longer has the lowest un
employment rate in the 
EU. Once again, job creation mostly benefited non-

residents, whose number rose by more than 5% while 
resident employment on
ly increased by about 1½%. 
This discrepancy certainly reflects mismatches 

between the skills (or absence
 thereof) of unemployed 
residents and those required by
 the jobs created but it 
might also be the result of a significantly higher 

reservation wage related to the 
generosity of the social security system (unemployment benefits are nearly 
twice as high in Luxembourg as in neighbouring 

countries). Due to this bi
as of job creation towards 
non-residents, employment may 
have to rise by about 
3½% a year for unemployment to stabilise. 
Employment growth is projected to accelerate slightly 
over the forecast period but probably not enough to 
prevent unemployment from con
tinuing to rise, albeit 
at a gradually slower pace. Like in recent years, the 
rise in domestic employment 
should considerably 
outpace that in resident employment. 
Inflation considerably accelerated in the course of 
2005, mostly as a result of 
the surge in oil prices. The 
HICP increased by 3.8%, while 
the rise in the national 
CPI, which excludes consumption by non-residents

and especially their large purchases of car fuel, 
alcohol and tobacco products, reached 2.5% (the 
weight of these three items amounts to 22.2% in the 

HICP compared to 7.5% in the 
national index). Due to 
still rising projected oil 
prices, both indexes should post in 2006 even 
higher increases than those 
recorded in 2005, before decelerating in 2007. 
Public finances 
After record surpluses in 2000 and 2001 (more than 
6% of GDP in both years), government finances 
rapidly deteriorated, recording in 2004 a 1.1% of GDP 

deficit, which rose to 1.9% 
in 2005. Despite a large 
shortfall in VAT revenues, due 
in part to the relative 
weakness in private consumption but above all to 

large and unexpected VAT reimbursements, total 
government resources rose by 6.2% and by 0.2 
percentage point of GDP, than
ks chiefly to buoyant 
revenues from direct taxes, especially the corporate 
tax. However, simult
aneously, government 
expenditure rose by more than 8% and by 1 
percentage point of GDP. This fast increase in 
expenditure was mostly imputable to public 

investment (+14.1%) but also to collective 
consumption (+12.3%). In 2006, the rise in revenues 
is projected to accelerate and the increase in 

expenditure to slow down somewhat, as government 
consumption and investment are unlikely to post 
again the very high growth rates recorded in 2005. 

Consequently, the deficit sh
ould slightly improve to 
about 1¾% of GDP.  In 2
007, it is expected to 
contract further to about 1½% of GDP: the rise in 

expenditure is assumed to be
 similar to that projected 
for 2006, while additional revenues will result from 
tax and contribution in
creases, announced by the 
government on April 21. Additional consolidation 
measures, more specifically targeted at curbing the 
rise in spending, were due to be announced at the 

beginning of May, but their content was not known 
before this forecast was finalised.

Activity in 2005 
After a moderate acceleration in 2004, real GDP 
decelerated slightly to 4.1% in 2005. The main driver 
of GDP growth was the exceptionally strong 

performance in net 
exports. Growth in the 
manufacturing sector was particularly robust in the 
production of electrical and 
optical equipment and of 
transport equipment. Most of the increase in gross 
fixed capital formation was realised in the area of 
public infrastructure invest
ment. Private consumption 
was relatively moderate compared
 to the previous 
years.Consumer price inflation (H
ICP) declined sharply to 
3.5% in the year as a whole, down from 6.8% in 2004. 

Against the background of
 falling inflation, the central 
bank cut its policy rates by 350 basis points during the 
course of 2005. The unemp
loyment rate hit a seven-
year high of 7.5% in the three months to January 
2006.  The current account deficit decreased to 7.3% of GDP 
in 2005, down from over 8.5% of GDP in the 
previous years due to the narrowing gap in the trade 
balance. However, the surprisingly low trade deficit 

could be linked to an underestimation of imports as 
suggested by the 
corresponding sharp rise in net errors 
and omissions (close to 2.5% of GDP in 2005) in the 

balance of payment statistics. The deficit was 
increasingly financed by net 
foreign direct investment 
inflows.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
In 2006, real GDP growth is forecast to accelerate to 
around 4.6%. Domestic demand is expected to fuel 
economic activity mainly because of the expansionary 
fiscal stance. Foreign demand is also expected to 

contribute to GDP growth in
 line with the pick-up in 
the international economic 
activity. In 2007, GDP 
growth is expected to ease somewhat to around 4.2%, 

due mainly to moderating private consumption. 
Throughout the projection period, private 
consumption is anticipated to be especially strong, 
supported by lower indi
rect taxes, rising social 
transfers and minimum wage increases. Investment in 
construction will continue to benefit from extensive 
motorway construction, while investment in 

equipment will remain steady 
both in 2006 and 2007. 
Imports are set to rise alongside private consumption 
and investment spending. As exports are also 

expected to grow relatively strongly both in 2006 and 
2007, the negative trade balance is set to stabilize at 
around 2.5% of GDP. Due to the continuing fi
scal expansion and robust 
private consumption, the current account deficit is 
projected to widen throug
hout the forecast period, 
reaching close to 8.5% of GDP. The increasing 
amount of public and private foreign debt-related 
interest expenditure will continue to strongly 

contribute to the expanding factor income deficit.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment is expected to slightly increase 
throughout the forecast period. As the participation 
rate is projected to rise, 
the anticipated employment 
growth might not translate into a decline in the 
unemployment rate, which 
is expected to stabilise at 
above 7½%.  
Annual consumer price inflation is projected to 
further decelerate to about 2.3% in 2006 as a whole, 
mainly as a result of the cut in VAT rates. The first 
monthly data for 2006 showe
d that so far the cut in 
the VAT only partially affected prices. However, the 
falling inflation expectations and the intensive 
competition in the tradab
le sector following EU 
accession are expected to cool inflationary pressures 
in 2006. In 2007, fuelled by
 high oil prices and the 
weakening forint, consumer price inflation is forecast 
to return to close to 3.5%
, broadly in line with the 
underlying inflationary 
trends in Hungary.

The government deficit increased to 6.1% of GDP in 
2005, from 5.4% in 2004
1. The deficit is expected to further increase in 2006, reaching 6.7% of GDP
2. The 
forecast includes tax cuts of over 1% of GDP in the 
2006 budget (mainly the reduction of VAT rates and a 
cut in the top rate of the personal income tax). 

Expenditures are projected to be higher than officially 
estimated, as the budget lacks the necessary structural 
reforms targeting expend
iture reduction. Interest 
expenditure is also expected to be higher than 
budgeted in view of the projected rise in interest rates 
and the government debt level. Based on the usual no-

policy change assumption, 
the budgetary position is 
expected to worsen in 2007 to 7% of GDP, chiefly 
due to the second step of the planned tax cuts.  
The forecast includes the costs of military aircraft 
(0.3% of GDP in 2006, and
 0.2% of GDP in 2007) 
purchased under a financial 
lease and to be delivered 
in those two years (these 
outlays were not included in 
the original official targets of
 4.7% of GDP in 2006 
and of 3.3% of GDP in 2007). It assumes that 

investment in new motorways built in public-private 
partnerships worth about 1% of GDP, are recorded as 
private investment and not as government 

expenditure
3.In the light of increasing 
yearly deficit levels, the 
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to exceed the 60% 
threshold in 2007. 
                                                          
1This forecast takes into account the temporary reclassification of 
second pillar pension funds inside the general government, which 
lowers the deficit figures each year by at least 1.4 percentage points 

in 2005-2007 (for details see Statistical Annex, note 11). 
2The forecasts have been prepared assuming that the debt of the 
public transport companies which benefit from a State guarantee 
will not be a taken over by the government during the forecast 
period.3The recording of these investments will be assessed by Eurostat at 
a later stage once detailed information is provided by Hungary.

Forecast
Activity in 2005 
Following a contraction of 1½% in 2004, real GDP 
growth turned positive to 
2½% in 2005. The rebound 
of economic activity was driven by domestic demand, 

especially inventories. Growth in private consumption 
stood close to 1½%, mainly reflecting higher 
household spending on services. Gross fixed capital 

formation expanded by above 6%, largely due to 
public spending on th
e Mater Dei Hospital and other 
infrastructure works financed through the EU 

Structural Funds and the Italian Protocol
1. However, 
reflecting ongoing efforts to
 rein in the fiscal 
imbalance, public consumption 
contracted by close to 
2%. Overall, the contribution of final domestic 
demand to GDP growth amounted to about 1¾ 
percentage points. In addition
, changes in inventories contributed 4½ percentage points to growth, possibly 
reflecting anticipated production to meet orders 
booked for 2006. After posting modest gr
owth in 
2004, exports contracted significantly by close to 4% in 2005, 
mainly owing to a poor pe
rformance of exports by the 
electronics sector. Although decelerating to below 
¼%, import growth was positive. Accordingly, the 
negative contribution of the external sector to GDP 

growth amounted to 4 percentage points. 
Employment growth decelerated, reflecting a decline 
in public sector employment 
which partly offset the 
increase in private sector jobs. HICP inflation 

decelerated to 2.5% in 2005 reflecting a favourable 
base effect caused by a rise in the standard VAT rate 
and an upward adjustment in 
energy products in 2004. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Real GDP growth is expected to slow down 
somewhat to 1¾% in 2006, and  accelerate to around 
2% in 2007. Economic activity is projected to be 

almost exclusively domestically-d
riven in both years, 
while the negative contribution of the external sector 
should narrow significantly.
 Private consumption is 
forecast to grow by around 1¼% in 2006 and 
accelerate to 1½% in 2007, on account of higher wage 
growth, while, following the substantial fiscal 

consolidation in recent years
, public consumption is 
projected to increase by around 1% in 2006 and 1½% 
in 2007. Investment is expe
cted to remain the main 
contributor to domestic demand, albeit growing at a 
slower speed than in 2005 due to the completion of 
some public infrastruc
ture projects. Investment 
growth is projected to ease in 200
7, when the decline 
in public investment shou
ld be partly compensated by 
higher private investment. 
Overall, the contribution of 
domestic demand is projected to attain slightly more 
than 1¾ percentage points 
in 2006 and 2007. On the back of an improved outlook for the 
electronics sector and, to a lesser extent, the tourism 
industry, exports are expected to recover in 2006 and 
to accelerate further in 2007. As a result of higher 

export growth and sustained consumption, imports are 
also expected to accelerate over the forecast period. 
Net exports are projected to
 detract around ¼ of a 
percentage point from GDP growth. 
After peaking in 2005, 
the current account deficit is forecast to fall to around 12½% of GDP in 2006 and 
to improve further in 2007. 
This outcome is mainly 
explained by a reduction in the imbalance of primary 
incomes and current transfers over the forecast period. 
The current account deficit is expected to be only 

partially financed by cap
ital inflows from EU funds. 
The remaining net external borrowing position is 
projected to remain around 9% of GDP over the 

forecast horizon. Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment growth is expected to decelerate in 2006 
as the labour-intensive constr
uction work related with 
the Mater Dei Hospital ap
proach completion stage. 
Although declines in constru
ction may continue in 
2007, job creation in other activities is expected to 

pick up owing to improved prospects mainly in the 
private sector. With the restructuring of

st completed, job losses 
in traditional sectors shou
ld bottom out, while 
employment will be created by nascent sectors such as 

pharmaceuticals. However, the services sector is 
expected to remain th
e main contributor to 
employment growth, due to further expansion in 

information technology 
and financial services 
activities. Although unemployme
nt is anticipated to 
rise to 7½% in 2006, it sh
ould decline marginally in 
2007. The outlook for HICP inflation shows a rise to 
almost 3% in 2006, both as the impact of the recently 
introduced market-b
ased utility rates are fully 
captured by the index and as a result of expected 
further increases in energy prices. Inflation in 2007 is 
projected to decline only 
marginally to around 2¾%. 
Public finances 
Fiscal consolidation procee
ded during 2005 as the 
deficit declined to 3.3% of GDP. In 2006, the general 
government deficit is expected to decline further to 
below 3% as a result of tax buoyancy mirroring the 
domestically-led composition of growth and capital 
transfers. The structural deficit (cyclically-adjusted 

deficit net of one-offs) is expected to improve by less 
than ¼% of GDP. Under a no-policy change scenario, 
which takes into accoun
t the reduction in public 
investment linked with the Mater Dei Hospital but 
excludes one-off revenue (sale of immovable property 
estimated at ¾% of GDP), the deficit is forecast to 

stand at almost 3¼% in 2007. The general 
government gross debt in 2005 declined below 75% 
of GDP. In 2006, the debt-t
o-GDP ratio excluding the 
effect of planned privatisation (estimated at 7% of 
GDP), is expected to fall to 74%. Based on a no-
policy change scenario, the debt ratio in 2007 is 
projected to remain unchanged from the previous 
year’s level.

The Netherlands - Contributions to GDP 
                     growth
%Forecast
Activity in 2005 
The hesitant recovery that had 
started in 2004 did not 
follow through in 2005
, with GDP growth again 
turning out lower, at 
1.1%. The quarterly profile 
shows that after a strongly negative first quarter, when 
the economy contracted by a hefty 0.7% quarter-on-
quarter, the recovery restarted with vigour as quarterly 

growth reached 0.9% on average in each of the 
subsequent quarters. 
Private consumption, after 
stagnating in 2004, 
increased by a modest 0.3% in 2005. With 

households' net real disposable income declining, 
consumption growth was held up only by the fall in 
private savings. Private gros
s fixed investment grew 
by just over 3% and was dominated by investment in 
construction. Public investment was down 2% and 
public consumption expend
iture increased only by 
0.5% as fiscal consolidation
 continued. All in all, 
domestic demand added 0.7% to GDP growth. 
Albeit slightly less pronounced than in 2004, 
economic growth was still predo
minantly driven by 
the external sector. Real exports of goods and services 
grew by 5.9%, on the back of strong world trade 

growth. Imports lagged somewhat, in line with other 
national demand factors. In all, net exports 
contributed 0.9 of a percentage point to GDP growth. 

The strong recovery was accompanied by a large 
depletion of stocks, unlike in 2004, when significant 
stock building took place. This swing in stock-

building resulted in a negative contribution to GDP 
growth. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Economic growth is expect
ed to exceed potential 
growth by a significant margi
n and post 2.6% in both 
years of the forecast period. Strong world import 

growth continues to sup
port exports, which are likely 
to grow by around 6½% in 2006 and 2007. However, 
import growth is now expected to fully catch up and 

show similar or even m
arginally higher growth rates. 
The resulting net exports will add to GDP – around ¼ 
and ¾ a percentage point in 2006 and 2007, 

respectively. The main gros
s contribution to economic 
growth in both years will come from domestic 
sources. Private investment will show strong 

momentum, which is not uncommon at this phase of 
the economic cycle. Corporate gross fixed capital 
formation is expected to increase by around 6% in 

2006 and over 4% in 2007, although the figure for 
2006 is inflated by some 
large investment projects. 
The reform of the health care system that came into 
effect at the beginning of 20
06 resulted in a shift of 
health care expenditures fro
m private to public 
consumption. Although this 
leads to heavily distorted 
growth figures of private and public consumption, it 
merely represents a statistical reclassification and no 
large behavioural effects are assumed for the forecast 

period. Government consumption, net of these effects, 
is expected to increase relatively modestly in 2006, 
but to pick up somewhat in th
e first half of 2007 in the 
run-up to the general elections. Private consumption 
expenditure, also corrected for the health care reform, 
is forecast to grow modestly 
in both year
s, at around 1½% per annum. The main reason for the relatively 
benign consumption path is 
that real disposable 
household income is expected to increase only slowly 

as wage growth will lag th
e economic recovery. 
Additionally, private savings are expected to 
recuperate some of the ground lost in recent years, 

increasing from 12.3% in 2005 to 12.6% of gross 
disposable income in 2006 and 2007. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
In 2005, total employment is expected to have fallen 
by 0.2%, representing the th
ird consecutive year of 
falling employment. The economic recovery will 
result in significant employ
ment growth from 2006 
onwards, leading to a fall 
in unemployment from 
4.7% in 2005 to 3.9% in 2007. Wage growth is 
expected to remain relativ
ely subdued, mainly 
because tensions in the labour market will only start

to arise at the end of the forecast period and wages are 
likely to respond with a lag 
to the tightening labour 
market. Unit labour costs will only marginally 

increase in 2006, but pick up somewhat in 2007. As 
the output gap is likely to
 remain well within negative 
territory, inflationary pressures are forecast to remain 

contained. HICP inflation is expected to increase to 
1.8%
1 in 2006 and 2.1% in
 2007. Oil prices are 
assumed to continue to rise in 2006 and 2007, albeit at 

a slower pace, alleviating upward pressures on 
consumer prices. 
Public finances 
Since the deficit peaked in 2003, the general 
government deficit was brought back to 1.9% in 2004 

and continued to decline quickly in 2005. The 
estimated deficit for 2005 has been heavily revised in 
recent months, from 1.8% last September at the time 

of the budget to a current 0.3% of GDP. This better-
than-expected outcome reflects higher gas receipts 
and tax revenues, as well as spending that remained 
below the allotted ceilings. Additionally, the balance 
benefited from corporate tax receipts of ¼% of GDP 

which had been advanced
 from 2006 to 2005 
following an increase in 
interest rates paid on 
overpaid taxes. For 2006, 
it is assumed that allotted 
expenditure ceilings will again
 be met and that there 
will be a mirror effect of the advance from corporate 
tax receipts. On balance, this will effectively increase 

the budget deficit by 0.9 of a percentage point to 1.2% 
of GDP against the backgrou
nd of substantially higher 
economic growth. 
In 2007, the deficit is expected to 
improve to ¾% of GDP on the back of the cyclical 
upswing, but also because the expected increase in oil 
prices will feed through to gas prices, generating 

additional revenues.

Activity in 2005 
The Austrian economy grew 
by 1.9% in 2005, 
decelerating from 2.4% in the previous year. 
Domestic and external demand provided roughly 

equal contributions to 
growth. Against the 
background of sizeable personal income tax cuts, 
private consumption grew at almost twice the pace of 

the previous year, though still moderately by 
historical standards. As 
expected, investment grew 
only slowly due to the expiry of the fiscal investment 

premium at the end of 
2004 (initially planned for the 
end of 2003, but then postponed) which resulted in 
significant carry-forward effects, predominantly in 
2003. After the strong 9% 
growth in 
2004, exports decelerated substantially, but this was mainly due to 
statistical effects caused by the change in the 

treatment of accounting of aircraft repairs.  With 
imports growing very slowly, net exports still 
contributed strongly 
to growth.    
Looking at the quarterly profile, the year saw a 
gradual acceleration from 0.2% in the first quarter up 
to 0.7% in the last. Both private and government 
consumption grew at a steady pace throughout the 
year, whereas gross fixed capital formation and 
imports growth sped up quarter-on-quarter. Export 

growth peaked in the middle of the year and 
weakened thereafter, reflecting a softening of exports 
and imports in Germany.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Activity is expected to accelerate significantly in 2006 
and slow down somewhat thereafter, narrowing the 
negative output gap over the forecast period. Growth 
will be increasingly driven by domestic demand as 
consumers benefit from previous years' tax cuts, 
lower-than-initially-expected inflation and relatively 
strong job creation. The growth rate of equipment 
investment should rebound in 2006 on the back of 
rising replacement demand and healthy profits. 

Housing construc
tion is to pick up
 after a slump in 
2005. Other construction is expected to grow robustly 
due to the government's measures aimed at improving 

Austria's infrastructure, adopted
 mainly to address 
growing unemployment.  
Export growth in 2006 is assumed to be strong 
because of carry-forward effects in private 

consumption in Germany due to the increase in the 
standard German VAT rate as from 2007. The 
planned change is thought to influence in particular 

purchases of durable go
ods, which constitute a 
significant share of Austrian exports to Germany.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment is expected to grow throughout the 
forecast period, albeit more slowly than in the euro 
area on average, due to continuously higher labour 
productivity in Austria (see graph). The 

unemployment rate is likely to
 remain unchanged up 
to the forecast horizon as the labour force grows 
rapidly due to more women and foreigners entering 

the job market and older workers staying longer as a 
consequence of the recent pension reform. The 
government's special measures adopted in September 

2005 seem to be helpi
ng to stabilise unemployment, 
but are not sufficient to bring it down.  
Consumer price inflation is
 projected to stay well 
below 2% over the forecast period. Since wage 

developments are expected to stay in line with 
productivity growth, no in
flationary pressures should 
arise from labour cost. 
Public finances 
In 2005, the general government budget deficit 
amounted to 1.5% of GDP, 0.4 percentage point lower 
than the national au
thorities had initially expected. 
The 2005 budget was affected by the second stage of 
the tax reform started one year earlier. Its burden on 
the budget in 2005 had been estimated at 0.8% of 

GDP, but tax revenue turned out to be higher than 
expected, mainly owing to higher proceeds from VAT 
and corporate tax. However,

was also exceeded (e.g. on education and family 
benefits), though by a smaller margin.  
The revenue loss from the tax reform, which did not 
fully materialize in 2005, will most probably be 

deferred to 2006 and enlarge 
the revenue loss of about 
1.4% of GDP initially estimated 
for 2006.. The budget 
will be additionally burdened
 with the cost of the 
regional employment and growth initiative of August 
2005 and a package of measures aimed at combating 
youth unemployment and he
lping women re-enter the 
job market that the gove
rnment adopted in September 
2005 (about 0.16
% of GDP in total). On the other 
hand, implementation of the second stage of the 

administrative reform, agreed on by the different 
levels of government in November 2005, should result 
in expenditure savings of around 0.1% of GDP. 

Taking all those factors into account, it is likely that 
the general government 
deficit will slightly surpass 
the 1.7% of GDP planned by the national authorities.  
In 2007, the deficit is expected to decline somewhat 
as the impact of the tax reform wears off, but it will 
still be considerably higher 
than the 0.8% target 
presented in the latest update of the stability 
programme.  
The debt ratio should
 decrease slightly over the 
forecast period, but will nevertheless remain above 

the 60%-of-GDP reference value.

Activity in 2005 
At 3.2%, GDP growth in 2
005 was disappointing 
compared to the previous year (5.3%). Economic 
activity started to recover in 
the final quarter of 2005, 
when economic growth reached 4.2% year-on-year on 
the back of a strong pick-up in investment activity. 
Following the end of the pr
e-election instability in the 
first half of the year, when
 investment growth reached 
only 2.5%, investors regained confidence in the 
second half. In 2005 as a whole gross fixed capital 

formation was up by 6.2%. Total domestic demand 
grew by a meagre 1.9% in 2005 because of low 
consumption and large de-stocking.  
Export growth almost halved 
to 7.1% in comparison 
with 2004, and import growth slowed to a mere 3.4%, 
down from 15.2% in 2004. Overall, GDP growth in 
2005 was supported by domestic demand net of 

changes in inventories and net
 exports (3.0 and 1.3 
percentage point contributions to GDP growth, 
respectively). The contribution 
of inventories to GDP 
growth was negative (-1.1 percentage points). Large 
de-stocking can be explained 
by the adjustment of 
stocks to lower-than-expected
 demand and too high 
demand expectations in 2004 
(the year of accession to 
the EU) when stocks were built up.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 4.5% in 2006 
and 4.6% in 2007. Domestic demand is expected to be 
the main driving force in
 both years. Investment and 
private consumption growth are likely to pick up 

strongly over the forecast period. This outlook is 
underpinned by short-term indi
cators which point to 
industrial production and retail sales reaching over 
10% year-on-year growth in the first quarter of 2006. 
Despite the still unstab
le political situation, companies seem to be mo
re inclined to invest, which 
is reflected in high investme
nt-driven import growth. 
Furthermore, capacity utilisat
ion is very high, while 
corporate profits in 2005 were the highest in the last 
16 years and interest rates are at a record-low level. 
These factors are expected to translate into high 

investment growth in 2006 and 2007.  
Private consumption is likely to benefit from a 
number of factors, notably the indexation of pensions 
in 2006, the lowering of 
effective personal income tax 
rates as from 2007, direct payments to farmers and 
stronger real wage growth. The administrative 
difficulties encountered in managing EU funds have 
so far limited Poland’s ab
sorption capacity, but the 
situation has started to impr
ove. Therefore, in 2006 
and 2007, EU funds (up to 1.2% and 1.5% of GDP, 

respectively) will boost domestic demand and 
increase imports, which will tran
slate into a negative 
contribution of net exports to
 GDP growth, in spite of 
a good performance of Polish exporters   
Export growth accelerated in the last quarter of 2005 
and is expected to remain buoyant within the forecast 

period, despite a temporary fo
od export ban to Russia 
and Ukraine. The share of exports to non-EU 
countries is likely to increase. Growing imports in line 
with strengthening domestic demand is projected to 
lead to an increase in the trade and current account 
deficits this year and next. However, higher transfers 

from the EU will have a moderating impact on both 
the current and capital accounts. After narrowing to 
88Chapter 3 Member States, Poland 1.5% in 2005, the current
 account deficit is expected 
to widen to about 2% in 2006 and 2½% in 2007, and 
will thus remain within sustainable bounds.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Labour market conditions have
 been improving since 
the second quarter of 
2004. Overall, employment 
started to grow in 2004. It
 increased by 2.3% in 2005 
and is expected to stay on an upw
ard trend over the 
forecast horizon, but the employment rate remains the 
lowest in the EU. As economic activity is accelerating 
inter alia thanks to higher investment, projected 
employment growth should translate into a lower 
unemployment rate by more 
than 2 percentage points 
in 2006-2007. The pa
rticipation rate is expected to 
grow slowly up to 64.2% in 2007. The planned 
reduction of taxes on labour should also have a 
favourable impact on employment and unemployment 

from 2007 onwards. However, 
unemployment will 
still be relatively high, above 
16% of the labour force, 
by the end of the forecast horizon, reflecting the deep-

rooted structural problems in the labour market.  
Unit labour costs grew by 2.1% in 2005, owing to a 
drop in productivity growth 
combined with modest 
compensation growth. In 
2006 and 2007, unit labour 
cost growth is expected to expand by 2¼% in 2006 
and 2½% in 2007 on the back of a moderate recovery 

of productivity and rapid wage growth. 
Unemployment is reaching levels close to structural 
unemployment, and thus 
will exert to a lesser extent a moderating influence on wage growth. 
Despite unfavourable developments in oil and energy 
prices, lower mark-ups of o
il refineries and subdued 
food prices have kept HICP inflation relatively low, at 

2.2% on average in 2005; year-on-year inflation went 
down to 0.8% in December. In February 2006, annual 
inflation reached 0.9% and is likely to remain close to 

this level in the coming 
months. A slightly negative 
output gap, which is not likely to close over the 
forecast horizon, and muted inflationary expectations 

are projected to keep inf
lation in 2006 and 2007 
below the central bank’s medium-term target of 2.5%. 
Inflation is forecast to reach 1.0% in 2006 and 2.0% 
in 2007.  Public finances  
Since the 2005 autumn fore
cast, the picture of public 
finances has changed significantly as a result of 
substantial data revisions following methodological 
changes. The 2005 general government deficit is now 
estimated at 2.5% of GDP compared to an earlier 
prediction of 3.6%. This significant reduction is 
mainly due to a new formula transforming cash data 
into accrual data, an upward revision of GDP by the 

statistical office and lower absorp
tion of EU funds, which resulted in lower inve
stment expenditure. In 
addition, the record-high
 corporate profits resulted in 
a large increase of corporate 
income tax 
revenues in 2005 which is not likely 
to continue into 2006. 
The general government deficit is expected to reach 
3% of GDP in 2006, above 
the target set in the 
January 2006 Co
nvergence Programme (2.6%). This reflects high uncertainty concerning the 
implementation of the 
2006 budget. Despite the 
projected acceleration of GDP growth, revenues from 
indirect taxes are likely to be 
lower than in the rather 
very optimistic outlook presen
ted in the budget. In 
addition, there is a risk
 that the government will 
increase social expenditure under pressure from 
smaller parties or if the prospects of early elections 
resurge. Numerous expend
iture-increasing initiatives 
have already been presented 
in the so
-called political 
“stabilisation pact”, which was signed by the ruling 
party and the smaller ones in February 2006. 
Against the background of slightly accelerating 
growth, the general government deficit-to-GDP ratio 

is expected to stabilise at 3%
 of GDP in 2007. This 
forecast clearly diverges from the deficit target of 
2.2% of GDP set in the January 2006 Convergence 

Programme mainly because it considers revenue-
reducing reforms in social contributions, personal 
income tax and value added tax announced on 31 

March 2006. In particular, the 
cuts in contributions to 
the disability and sickness funds (estimated at more 
than 0.6% of GDP), pro-family tax reliefs and the 

indexation of brackets of personal income tax 
(estimated at about 0.4% of GDP) will weigh on the 
2007 budget. The revenue losses are to be 

counterbalanced to some extent by increased revenues 
from higher excise duties on fuel and cigarettes and 
the removal of private con
struction and renovation tax reliefs (about 0.6% 
of GDP altogether). 
The general government balance presented in the 
forecast still includes the surplus of the second-pillar 

pension funds, the impact 
of which is expected to 
reach approximately 2% of GDP in 2006-07.

Activity in 2005 
In 2005, the Portuguese economy grew by 0.3%, 
indicating the continua
tion of a fragile economic 
situation. The growth prof
ile was uneven with a 
temporary revival in the second quarter on the back of 
a carry-forward of purchases against the increase in 
the VAT standard rate in July. For the year as a 

whole, investment receded on the back of a shrinking 
construction sector. Export
s gradually recovered from 
the weak performance of late 2004 and imports 

decelerated markedly. Altogether, the contribution of 
domestic demand to GDP growth
 declined over the 
year, while the net contribution of the external sector 

gradually improved. 
Nevertheless, 2005 was marked by a widening of the 
external deficit. Notably, 
the primary income deficit 
increased and current and capital transfers declined 

considerably: altogether these items accounted for 
more than half of the 
external balance deterioration. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Some moderate improvement of economic activity is 
expected this year and next, with real GDP growth 
rates expected to be close to 1%. 
The contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth 
is forecast to be smaller than in the last two years. 

Private consumption is expected to be constrained by 
a weakening labour market
 and high household 
indebtedness against the backd
rop of possibly tighter 
financing conditions. Add
itionally, recent curbs on tax credits and hikes on so
me taxes will constrain 
disposable income gr
owth over the forecast period. 
Investment is expected to
 mirror the downturn in 
construction, which seems to be the result of cyclical 
factors as well as of a more permanent downsizing of 

the sector. At the same time
, investment in equipment 
will recover gradually over the forecast period, though 
held back by the weak momentum of final demand. 
The contribution of net exports to GDP growth is 
forecast to be slightly positive or neutral. Price and 
wage deceleration, in particular in 2007, is expected 
to create some leeway for export growth. 

Additionally, a contribution is
 expected to come from 
a recovery of car exports already in 2006 and, 
building upon the 2005 
experience, exports to new 
markets may become somewhat brisker. However, the 
fact that some export-oriented industries are still 
adjusting to supply shocks coming from the 

increasing integration of 
emerging economies into 
world trade adds uncertainty to
 the exports outlook. 
The external balance is not expected to improve over 
the forecast period. In addition to a deterioration of 

the terms of trade, driven 
by oil prices, current and 
capital transfers are predicted 
to remain on a 
downward trend.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
In the past few years, employment has been affected 
by the subdued economic 
activity. Small employment 
gains are projected for the coming years in line with 

the expected cyclical recovery of activity, yet not 
sufficient to reduce the un
employment rate. Under 
such conditions, wage 
growth is expected to slow 
down, putting a lid on 
prices and unit labour costs. 
In 2005, inflation fell to
 its lowest level since 1997, 
despite the pressure exerted 
by higher energy prices 
and the increase in the standard VAT rate from 19 to 

21% in July. However, in
 2006, the carry-over of 
these shocks will weigh on prices. Although the 
subdued cyclical cond
itions, as revealed by a negative 
output gap, are pulling in the opposite direction, 
average HICP inflation may nevertheless increase to 
almost 2¾% in 2006 befo
re declining in 2007. 
Public finances 
In 2005, the general government deficit corresponded 
to 6% of GDP. The sharp det
erioration from the 2004 
deficit was largely the result of the government 

decision of no longer impl
ementing deficit-reducing 
one-off operations.

Tax revenue grew markedly in 2005, apparently as the 
result of improved tax collection, as well as of the 
VAT increase in July. On the other hand, lower 

dividend receipts from government-owned enterprises 
acted as a drag on revenues. At the same time, current 
expenditure increased further as a share of GDP, with 

a strong increase in social transfers persisting as old-
age pension schemes mature. 
Additional expenditure 
pressure also came from personnel, health and local 

government spending an
d EU contributions. 
Various corrective measures on both the revenue and 
expenditure side have been introduced since mid-
2005. They include the VAT increase, gradual 

increases in some excise taxes and the reduction of 
tax credits. The main corrective measures on the 
expenditure side concern health and pension schemes, 

in particular those for government employees. 
Relevant changes have been also 
introduced to central 
government hiring rules and, in 2006, a temporary 

freeze of staff automatic promotions and transfers to 
local government has been put in place
1.Revenues are expected to grow at a healthy pace, in 
particular in 2006, under
pinned by discretionary 
measures affecting tax rates and credits. Whereas a 

slowdown in current primary 
expenditure is expected, 
sustained control will continue to be a matter of 
concern. In particular, social transfers other than in 

kind are forecast to c
ontinue growing well above 
nominal GDP. In addition, 
interest expenditure seems 
to have bottomed out
 and to be starting to rise faster. In all, the projected revenue and expenditure patterns 
will yield a fall of the general government deficit to 
some 5% of GDP in 2006. With high deficits and low 
GDP growth, the government 
debt ratio is projected to 
continue increasing over the forecast period.

Forecast
Activity in 2005 
Against the background of oil price hikes, the 
economy continued to grow steadily at 3.9% in 2005. 
After relatively weak activity in
 the first quarter, GDP 
growth soared in the second quarter due to vigorous 
car exports to France and 
Austria, but stabilised just 
above 3.5% yoy in the second 
half of the year. While 
the export performance rem
ained remarkably resilient 
throughout the year, impo
rts slowed against the 
backdrop of high commodity price levels and subdued 

investment activity. At the 
same time, major de-
stocking occurred, which dec
reased annual growth of 
real GDP by 1.7 percentage points. Domestic 

consumption was stimulated
 mainly through 
household spending, which 
strengthened following a 
sustained rise in em
ployment and favourable 
borrowing conditions.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
In 2006, real GDP is projected
 to increase by 4.3%,  
largely driven by domestic demand. The external 
contribution is expected 
to decline but stay positive 
thanks to the favourable circumstances in the 
international environmen
t, and especially owing to 
prospects of a temporary increase in Germany's 
domestic consumption.  
The revival in foreign markets should ensure that 
export performance holds up in the face of the fading 

effect of the recent increase in exports of vehicles. 
Imports are set to rise in step with buoyant domestic 
demand. Household consumpti
on, in particular, is 
likely to remain strong in
 the run-up to euro 
introduction. Favourable labour 
market developments 
and attractive credit o
pportunities should continue to 
encourage private spending, especially on durable 
goods. Investment spending
 related to housing 
construction is also forecast to stay high, as evidenced 
by strong growth in the number of construction 
permits issued. Furthermore, a major investment in 

the highway construction has been announced. 
Investment expenditure related
 to the adjustment of 
production processes with the aim of improving the 

competitiveness of Sloven
e industry is also 
anticipated to pick up.  
In 2007, GDP growth is projected to decelerate 
slightly to 4.1% since foreign demand is expected to 

slowly lose momentum. Imports are forecast to 
increase further with buoyant private and investment 
spending. The projections foresee the trade deficit to 

widen, however, the current account deficit is likely to stay contained below 2% of GDP.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
In 2005, against the background of a remarkably 
stable exchange rate, infl
ation dropped to 2.5%. 
Throughout the year, market prices were driven down 
by increased competition resulting from EU 

accession. Furthermore, the government regulated 
administered price rises in such a way as not to exert 
inflationary pressures. Excise duties on energy 

products were adjusted to partly counteract the 
adverse effects of oil price hi
kes. The lowest level of 
taxes allowed by EU legislation was reached in July 

2005. In the same period, the regular harmonisation of 
excise duties on tobacco with the acquis was carried 
out as requested by the accession agreement. The 

disinflationary path, how
ever, remained smooth. 
The existing government pol
icies and exchange rate 
stability fostered in the 
ERM II framework curb 
inflationary pressures. 
Assuming contained market 
price rises following the limited second-round effects 
of the rising oil price, inflation is expected to decrease 
marginally to 2.4% by th
e end of the year. The 
mandatory double pricing, in effect as of 1 March 
2006 throughout the economy, should limit the 
inflationary impact of euro introduction. Consumer 
price growth is projected 
to stabilise, though this 
forecast remains vulnerable to oil price shocks and 

liberalisation of the electricity and natural gas market 
for households by 1 July 
2007. Furthermore, there are 
uncertainties related to the potential increase in VAT 

rates, which could add around 0.8 percentage points to

the rate of inflation, and the outcome of the pending

The labour market situation is 
set to improve further 
this year against the background of solid economic 

activity. The marked rise in em
ployment recorded in 
2005 should be sustained
 until 2007, while the 
unemployment rate is forecast to linger just above 

6%. In 2005, an increase in gross wages compared to 
2004 was moderate despite the effect of the new tax 
regime, which ended the 
favourable treatment for 
freelance fees and thus encouraged employers to pay 
salaries instead. The negotiations between social 
partners for 2006-2007 are 
still ongoing and the wage 
policy is expected to be agreed by early summer. 
However, the government has declared itself in favour 
of maintaining the arra
ngement whereby the real 
wage rise should lag behind productivity growth by 
more than one pe
rcentage point.  
Public finances 
Following the third consecu
tive alignment of 
government accounts to ESA95 methodology (on 
capital transfers), the general government figures 
were revised upwards by 0.1-0.4% of GDP for the 
period 2000-2004. In 2005, the deficit declined to 
1.8% of GDP. The revenues came in better than 

expected while the increase in general government 
expenditure was contained against a backdrop of 
restrictive employmen
t and wage policies in the 
public sector and rationalisation of government goods 
and services purchases. The forecast for 2006 projects 
the deficit to worsen against 
the decision to index 
pensions to wages and the commitment of the new 
government to gradually ab
olish the payroll tax. To 
cover for the loss in revenue, an increase in VAT rates 

is contemplated as a possible corrective measure. 
Over the forecast horizon, 
the general government 
debt is expected to stay just below 30 percent of GDP.

Activity in 2005 
Economic growth accelerated to 6% in 2005. It 
continued to be driven by domestic demand, 
particularly by investment 
and private consumption. 
Robust employment and real wage growth lifted 
private consumption growth to 5¾%. Gross fixed 
capital formation increased by 13¼%, boosted by the 

realisation of some big investment projects in the 
corporate sector as well as by an increase in public 
infrastructure investment. The contribution of net 

exports remained negative against the backdrop of 
lower real growth of both exports and imports.  
The current account deficit widened further, to above 
8% of GDP in 2005, as a sharply deteriorating income 

balance added to the negative trade balance. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
The economic expansion is 
expected to remain strong 
at around 6% and 6½
% in 2006 and 2007 
respectively. Domestic demand is 
likely to remain the 
main driving force while 
export growth should speed 
up in 2006 as new export capacity will gradually 
come on stream; the external contribution to GDP 
growth should thus become positive again.  
An improving labour ma
rket situation combined with 
strong credit growth is expected
 to continue to support 
private consumption growth, which should remain at 
above 4½% over the forecast period. Gross fixed 
capital formation should start to decelerate markedly 

in 2006 as major investment projects in the 
automotive industry are to 
be finalised in the course 
of the year although the government, supported by EU 
funds, continues to inves
t in large infrastructure 
projects. The investment 
boom should further ease in 
2007, under the assumption of
 no new major foreign 
direct investments. As new production capacities 
enter full production only gradually, and further 
imports of investment goods for the new facilities can 

still be expected in the 
first half of 2006, the external 
contribution is likely to improve only gradually as 
well.Accelerating exports and a lower negative income 
balance should lead to a 
significant improv
ement in 
the current account balance
 in 2006 and 2007.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
Total employment increased by more than 2% in 2005 
while the unemploymen
t rate decreased to below 
17%. Similar, though slower, 
trends are anticipated in 
2006 and 2007 as strong 
domestic demand and newly 
built export production capacities are expected to 
create additional employment opportunities.   
Although annual HICP inflation fell to 2% in August 
2005 and averaged some 2½% over the first eight 
months, adjustments in administered prices pushed it 
up to 4% towards the end of the year. Since further 
increases in administered prices and indirect taxes 

followed at the beginning of 2006, the average annual 
HICP inflation is expected to reach around 4½% this 
year. As these one-off effects fade out, inflation 

should fall back to abou
t 2¾% in 2007 unless further 
significant increases in administered prices are 
stipulated.Public finances 
After tax reforms were put in place in 2004, a pension 
reform was launched in 2005, affecting social 
contributions by redirecting 9 percent of gross wages 
to a funded (second) pens
ion pillar. Due to 
widespread public 
interest in this p
illar, these revenue transfers are estimated at about ½%, 1¼% and again 
1¼% of GDP in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively.  
From autumn 2005 until 
the end of the transition 
period granted by Eurostat in spring 2007, the 
Commission services’ forecasts present the general 
government deficit net of the pension reform costs, 
that is, with the second pillar pension scheme 
classified within government.

).The general government defi
cit, net of the pension 
reform costs, decreased to below 3% of GDP in 2005, 
some ½ a percentage point lower than foreseen in the 

2005 budget. Furthermore, the 2005 deficit figure 
includes debt cancellations amounting to about 1% of 
GDP which were not incl
uded in the budget. 
However, for the second year in a ro
w, this positive 
development was mainly driven by the fact that 
unspent resources of around ¾% of GDP were just 

carried-over into the next year and thus constitute 
upside risks to the 2006 
and 2007 fiscal outcome.  
Furthermore, January 2006 increases in excise taxes 
on cigarettes and alcohol induced a large 

accumulation of stocks of cigarettes and alcohol at the 
end of 2005 and thus resulted in better-than-expected 
tax revenues for the year (¼% of GDP). This effect 

which was not foreseen in 
the 2006 budget will, 
however, negatively affect tax revenues in 2006. 
Better-than-expected GDP 
and employment growth 
combined with lower 
interest expenditure should, nevertheless, ensure that th
e 2006 general government 
deficit ends up at around 2¾% of GDP, slightly below 
the level foreseen in the 2006 budget. Increases in 

public expenditure in the election year are expected to 
prevent a more significant fi
scal consolidation despite 
a favourable macroeconomic situation.  
Under the customary no-policy-change assumption, 
the budget deficit net of the pension reform costs is 
projected to fall to about 2% of GDP in 2007 as a 
result of accelerating growth. 
Gross public debt is estimate
d to decrease sharply to 
below 35% of GDP in 2005 as part of the privatisation 
revenues from previous years has been used to pay-off 
some of the country’s debts. Government debt is 

projected to slightly 
increase but should remain far 
below 40% of GDP over the forecast period. 
Moreover, anticipated 
significant privatisation 
revenues in 2006 create a space for further debt 
reductions. 9623. Finland Growth rebounding from temporary slowdown

Activity in 2005  
According to preliminary national accounts data, real 
GDP growth slowed to 2.1% in 2005, down from 
3.6% in the previous year. The slowdown was 

primarily the reflection
 of a seven-week-long 
production stoppage in the paper industry due to a 
labour dispute, which is estimated to have shaved 1 

percentage point off GDP growth in the year as a 
whole.  Growth was driven by domestic demand, while net 
exports contributed negatively as a result of the low 

activity level in the 
paper industry. Persistently strong household consumption, led by high consumer 
confidence, increasing credit growth and rising 

employment, gave the main boost to domestic 
demand. 
Following a 5% increase in 2
004, investment grew by 
only 1.7% in 2005 due to a slump in machinery and 

equipment investment and a lower rate of expansion 
in residential construction. Import and export volumes 
grew surprisingly strongly in
 2005. However, part of 
the foreign trade was accounted
 for by transit exports, 
such as automobiles and telecommunications 

products, which were imported over the Finnish 
customs line before be
ing re-exported mainly to 
Russia. The weakening in 
the terms of trade 
continued.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  
The economy is projected to return to and remain on a 
firm growth path throughout the forecast period. 
Survey indicators suggest that activity will pick up 
further in 2006, as indust
rial production and exports 
are strengthening while domestic demand remains 
solid. Real GDP growth should rebound to close to 

3½% in 2006, partly boosted by the base effect, 
before easing somewhat in 2007 towards the current 
estimate of potential GDP growth of 3%.  
After healthy gains in 2005
, private consumption is 
expected to continue to provide the main stimulus to 
overall GDP growth over the forecast period, albeit 
decelerating slightly due to rising interest rates and 

moderating household borrowing. Public consumption 
growth is foreseen to ease, gi
ven the efforts of the 
central government to control expenditure. Exports 

are anticipated to rebound and gain further 
momentum as import demand from trading partners 
will increase. Imports are expected to grow at a firm 

pace on the back of lively domestic demand. Also, the 
import content of exported go
ods is on a rising trend. 
Nevertheless, net exports will give a strong positive 
contribution to growth in 2006
 and to a smaller degree 
in 2007 when the base effect from the paper industry 
stoppage has faded. Investment
 is projected to recover 
from the slump in 2005, led by equipment investment, 
which is assumed to revive as stronger business 

confidence and order-books have improved the 
outlook for production and sales.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment increased by 1.6% in 2005 and is 
projected to continue to grow at a similar pace in 

2006, before slowing somewhat in 2007 due to a 
slight slowdown in 
economic activity. The labour 
shortages in some sectors are expected to be alleviated 

by the lifting of the restrictions on the free movement 
of labour from the new EU Member States as of 1 
May 2006, giving a boost to employment growth. The 

unemployment rate is proj
ected to fall steadily well 
below 8% of the labour force in 2007.  
During the forecast period, HICP inflation is expected 
to accelerate only slightly towards 1½% from 0.8% in 

2005, the lowest in the euro area. Higher oil prices are 
the most important factor exerting upward pressure on 
inflation. Tightening co
mpetition, especially in 
services, and subdued import prices of consumption 
goods will keep consumer prices in check also in the 

forecast period. The centralised wage agreemen
t, settled in late 2004, 
provides for moderate wage increases up to

September 2007. Assuming the usual positive wage 
drift of about 1 percentage 
point, per capita wages are 
expected to increase on average by less than 3% in 

2006-2007. Strong produc
tivity growth appears likely 
to limit the rise in unit 
labour costs to about ½% over 
the forecast period.  
Public finances  
The outcome for the general government financial 
surplus for 2005 and projections for 2006-2007 are 
markedly more favourable th
an in the previous 
forecast exercise. Current projections indicate a 

general government surplus 
of 2½% of GDP over the 
forecast period rather than the 2% predicted in autumn 
2005. The increase is due to a better outlook for 

revenues, while spending 
is assumed to remain 
contained. Based on the Finnish Government’s 
medium-term spending guidelines of spring 2006, the 

improvement in the central government balance will 
shift the general government surplus upwards over the 
forecast period. Local government finances are seen 
to remain in deficit due to higher operating 
expenditure, even 
with tax revenues 
projected to rise. 
Social security should main
tain the same strong

Activity in 2005 
Swedish GDP growth in 2005 was 2.7%, representing 
a slowdown compared with the 3.7% growth recorded 
in 2004. While in 200
4 net exports contributed 
strongly to growth, in 2005 faster domestic demand 
took over. Private consumption 
advanced steadily and 
also public consumption growth picked up. The 

investment expansion was firm
 with high growth rates 
in equipment and constru
ction. Net exports continued 
to give a positive growth con
tribution, albeit marginal 
as compared to 2004, 
as exports slowed down and the 
pace of import growth stepped up.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Recent indicators are generally positive. Consumer 
confidence continues to 
show a positive picture as 
regards household views both on the economy as a 
whole and on their 
own economic situation. Industrial 
confidence is high in ge
neral, as it is for services, 
retail trade and, in partic
ular, construction. These indicators should support
 continued buoyant 
performance in 2006, when
 GDP growth is expected 
to be around 3½%. Dome
stic demand is the main 
growth driver but net exports will also contribute. In 

2007 the economy is expected to grow somewhat less, 
closer to potential rates, while the negative output gap 
is expected to close 
and turn positive. 
A resumption of employment growth will contribute 
positively to household disposable income in 2006 
and 2007, enabling a pick-up in private consumption. 
While households have ta
ken on more debt, wealth 
has benefited from rising equ
ity and strongly rising 
house prices, contributing to 
the maintenance of a 
relatively strong net wealth 
position. The saving rate remains at a relatively high level. Overall, as a 
positive risk, private consumption could surprise on 

the upside. 
Growth in public consumption is expected to increase 
in 2006, reflecting the improv
ed financial situation at 
local government level and the relatively 

expansionary 2006 central government budget. In 
2007, public consumption growth is expected to be 
somewhat lower. As regards investment, the 

conditions for a continued expansion, albeit at a 
decelerating pace, remain in place: a benign demand 
outlook, favourable financing conditions and a high 
capacity utilisation rate in manufacturing. Both 
exports and imports are expec
ted to pick up and grow 
relatively strongly in 2006 and then slow down 

somewhat in 2007, in 
line with world markets. 
Imports should also grow faster as final demand 
strengthens. Overall, net exp
orts will contribute to 
growth by close to a half-pe
rcentage point of GDP in 
both 2006 and 2007.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The labour market improved in 2005: employment 
growth turned positive, after having shown negative 
numbers in 2003-2004, and the unemployment rate 
stabilised (it should 
be noted that a methodological 
change in the measurement of unemployment 
increases its rate by around 
0.5 percentage points 
from 2005 as compared to 2004 and earlier). The 

relatively strong rise in economic activity over the 
forecast period results in a continuing improvement. 
Employment growth is expect
ed to strengthen, 
supported by a significant increase in the volume of 
active labour market measures in 2
006. Against this 
background, and the unemployment rate will 

decrease.  
Weak developments in the labour market over the last 
few years have helped to contain wage demands. 
Wage demands and inflatio
nary pressures remained 
contained for most of 2005, allowing the Riksbank to 
reduce interest rates by 
a further 50 basis points in 
June. Inflation thus remained low in spite of the 
significant recent oil price increases, but more 
recently has started to increase. Given the somewhat 

stronger inflation outlook, th
e Riksbank raised interest 
rates by a cumulative 50
 basis points in January and 
March 2006, effectively neutralisin
g the cut in June 
2005. Wages are nevertheless expected to continue to

).rise relatively moderately, reflecting the current wage 
agreement for private sector and central government 
reached in the spring of 2004 and covering a period 

including 2006. Overall, inf
lationary pressures remain 
relatively subdued but inflation is expected to rise 
towards 2% during the co
urse of 2007. With robust 
growth over this period, and with a stronger labour 
market, interest rates may rise further. 
Public finances 
In 2005, the budg
et surplus was a fu
ll 2.9% of GDP, 
about 1.5 percentage point of GDP higher than 

projected in the 2005 autumn forecast. The main 
reason behind this rapid improvement has been a very 
significant increase in tax revenues towards the end of 

the year. It should, however, be noted that over 2004 
and 2005 the budget has benefited from large one-off 
(corporate) tax receipts amounting roughly to a 

cumulative 1% of GDP. 
Sweden will continue to 
show budget surpluses over 
the forecast period. Income tax cuts proposed in the 
2006 Budget Bill, th
e last step of a phased income tax 
reform (adopted over the 2000-2006 period), as well 

as additional labour market measures, will contribute 
to an expansionary fiscal policy stance that will 
reduce the 2006 surplus 
as compared to 2005, though 
the ratio is still expected to
 be around 2% of GDP. On 
current policies, and taking into account the additional 
measures presented in the 20
06 Spring Budget Bill, a 
slight rise in the surplus is 
projected in 2007, as a 
result also of an improvement
 in the labour market. It 
should be noted that Swedish government accounts 

and the balances shown he
re will include second pillar 
pension funds (contributing to a budget balance 
improvement of about 1% of GDP per year) until 

spring 2007.  
General government gross debt, mainly central 
government liabilities, is proj
ected to continue to fall, 
to below 45% of GDP in 2007.

% adjusted real disposable income
Activity in 2005 
From 3.1% in 2004, real UK GDP growth slowed to 
1.8% in 2005 as a whole.  This was well below 
potential growth, reflecting shrinking manufacturing 

output and slower service sector output growth.  
However, GDP growth of 0.6% in the final quarter 
was the year's best outturn. 
Faltering domestic demand was chiefly responsible 
for the sharp slowdown in 2005, expanding only 
1.9%, half the rate of growth in 2004. Private 
consumption growth, in 
particular, was much slower 
than in 2004, dampened by a cooler housing market, 
earlier interest rate increases and an erosion of real 
disposable incomes by higher energy prices. 

Correspondingly, household sa
ving rose to around 5% 
of real disposable income from the very low levels of 
2004.  Total investment also slowed
 compared to the 
previous year, in spite of rapidly growing government 
investment broadly in line with budgetary plans. 
Business investment was h
ighly volatile but, over the 
whole year, did not seem to
 respond to favourable 
conditions (hig
h profitability, robust equity markets 
and low real interest rates). However, early estimates 
for investment tend to 
be revised significantly. 
Net trade data evolved erratically over 2005, although 
these are thought to have been affected by intra-

Community VAT fraud. Overall, data show slower 
growth of imports compared 
to exports, consistent 
with the observed slowdown 
in domestic demand. For 
2005 as a whole, net trade had a broadly neutral 
impact on GDP growth, after the large negative 
contribution in 2004. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Real GDP growth is expected to increase over the 
forecast period, to around 2½% in 2006 and around 
2¾% in 2007, mainly th
anks to expanding domestic 
demand supported by government consumption and to 
a lesser extent by investment and private 
consumption. 
Household consumption should 
start to pick up only 
marginally in 2006, as th
e slight softening of the 
labour market weakens otherwise steady real 
disposable income 
growth, before settling at a moderate but significant rate of growth by 2007. 
However, private consumption growth is expected to 
remain below its long-term average over the forecast 

horizon, reflecting a projected increase in the saving 
rate as more uncertainty about future income and 
employment prospects l
eads to balance-sheet 
consolidation in the household sector.  
Despite favourable cond
itions (high profitability, low 
cost of capital and lack of spare capacity), business 
investment is expected to remain subdued in 2006, as 
favourable conditions are offset by uncertainties on 
energy prices which might 
be compounded, for some 
companies, by relatively high
 levels of capital 
gearing. In 2007, as prospects for consumer demand 
brighten and spare capacity diminishes, business 

investment should ev
entually pick up.  
Growth in government consumption and investment is 
expected to continue to play an important role in 
supporting domestic demand,
 growing strongly in 
101Economic Forecasts, Spring 2006 The United Kingdom 
2006 but moderating in 2007, 
in line with government 
plans.  
On the external side, net trade is expected to provide a 
neutral contribution to real growth over the forecast 

period.  This reflects the support for exports from 
faster growth expected in the euro area, the UK's 
largest market. Nonetheless, the already significant 

external current account deficit is expected to widen 
further as UK net overseas liabilities continue to 
accumulate, reducing net income flows from abroad.  
In sum, the forecast shows the economy becoming 
slightly less imbalanced in terms of demand growth 
with net exports ceasing to drag, while government 
expenditure should continue to be the most buoyant 

component of domestic demand in the short term.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The impact of higher oil and gas prices on headline 
inflation petered out more quickly than previously 
expected, with HICP inflation
1 at 2.1% for 2005 as a 
whole. Going forwards, inflation is expected to 
remain around the Bank of 
England's target of 2%, 
supported by the Bank's 
ability to 
anchor inflation expectations.For the first three quarters of 2005, the labour market 
remained firm, shr
ugging off slower real GDP 
growth.  Productivity growth thus slowed sharply and 
unit labour costs accelerated. However, labour 
appears to have been hoarded, with this beginning to 

unwind in the final quar
ter of 2005: the numbers of 
newly unemployed represented the fastest quarterly 
increase for over a decade. Further unwinding is 

likely to push unemployment up to about 5% during 
2006, but higher real growth in 2007 should help 
bring it back down slightly.  Employment growth 

slowed in the final quarter of 2005.  This should 
continue into 2006, in response to slower growth of 
the economy and already high employment rates.   
Public finances

2 The UK financial year begins in April; the excessive deficit 
procedure applies to the United Kingdom on a financial year basis. 
Actual general government balance data reported here apply the 
Eurostat decision of 14 July 2000 on the allocation of UMTS 
public finances are estimated to show marked 
improvement in the first three months of 2006, the last 
quarter of the financial year, over the deficit outturn 

for 2005, thanks to buoyant
 corporation tax revenues, 
especially from oil-producing companies and the 
financial sector, as well as relatively strong income 

tax receipts and social security contributions. Part of 
the strong pick-up in receipt
s in 2005/06 is temporary 
in nature, due to the change in timing of payments of 

corporation tax from oil companies which, 
compounded by rising o
il prices, had an important 
role in boosting corporation tax receipts. 
The table below shows the projections for the general 
government deficit and debt
 on a financial year basis.

General government gross debt

*Estimates based on preliminary data
The deficit is expected to improve only slightly to 
around 3% of GDP in 2006/07, and to narrow further 
to around 2¾% of GDP in 2007/08. 
The improvement in th
e deficit in 2006/07 is 
supported by the pick-up in economic growth, which 
should improve the tax base and reduce cyclical 
expenditure. Continuing profitability from the 
financial sector, assuming no significant reversal of 
the currently strong equ
ity market, suggests that 
corporation tax receipts should continue to grow 
relatively strongly in the short term. However, oil 
production is now expected to
 be lower, at least in 
part offsetting the positive effect of rising oil prices on tax receipts from oil-producing corporations.  
                                                                                       
receipts. The UK has not generally applied this decision in 
domestic publication of its deficit data, which results in the deficit 

on a Eurostat basis being at most 0.1% points of GDP per annum 

higher than reported in UK national accounts from 2001/02 
onwards.3The forecast incorporates an outturn for the aggregate deficit in 
2005/06 published by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) 
on 24 April. This release also revised data incorporated in the 2005 

outturn submitted in the UK's EDP return on 30 March and 
validated by Eurostat on 24 April, implying a reduction of the 
deficit ratio from 3.6% of GDP (repor
ted by Eurostat) to 3.5%. 
However, the 24 April ONS release did not update the detailed 
breakdown of general government expenditure and revenue 
components published in the national accounts; in the forecast this 

inconsistency has necessitated an ad hoc adjustment.

These on balance favourable trends are partly offset 
by a projected increase of discretionary public 
expenditure as a share of GDP, in line with 

government plans (which the forecast assumes to be 
fully met) while the soften
ing of the labour market 
suggests that the strong growth in income tax receipts 

observed in the past financi
al year might moderate 
going forwards.   
The deficit in 2007/08 is e
xpected to improve to 
below the 3%-of-GDP reference va
lue, driven by the 
strengthening of the cyclical recovery, and by a 
number of additional factors: first, a number of 
discretionary measures implemented by the 

government since the autumn of 2005, including an 
increase in taxation on oil companies and further 
measures to improve tax compliance; second, a 

structural improvement in the ratio between direct tax 
receipts and their respective tax bases in line with 
long-term trends; third, 
reflecting the government’s 
plans, a projected slight moderation in overall 
expenditure growth in the 
2007/08 financial year.  
General government gross debt is projected to 
increase from around 42% of

Graph 4.1:
Bulgaria - Investment and external deficit
Forecast
Activity in 2005 
Growth of real GDP accelerated to 6.2% in the first 
half of 2005, fuelled by strong consumption and 
particularly buoyant investme
nt growth. Heavy floods 
during the summer, howeve
r, caused a significant 
drop in agricultural prod
uction and also a marked 
slowdown in the growth
 of services and industry. 
Thus real GDP growth decelerated in the third quarter 
and reached 5.5% for the whole year. The highest 
contribution to growth came again from private 

consumption, while investments grew exceptionally 
strongly at a rate of 19%. 
On the back of rising prices for oil, food and certain 
services, inflation accelerated towards the end of 2005 

with end-of-year inflation increasing to 6.5% from 
4.0% in 2004. Employment growth slowed down to 
2.0% in 2005, reflecting 
mainly lower public sector 
employment. The unemployme
nt rate continued to 
fall from 12% in 2004
 to around 10% in 2005. 
Higher oil prices and a surge in the import of 
investment goods co
ntributed to a substantial increase 
in the trade and curren
t account deficits. Following 
methodological revisions in 2006, the current account 

deficit increased to
 11.8% of GDP 
in 2005 while the 
trade deficit rose to 20.4% of GDP. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Economic growth is set to remain strong in 2006 and 
2007. It will be fuelled in particular by increasing 

investment rates further supporting the catching-up of 
the Bulgarian econo
my. While growth in exports of 
goods and services should pick up again from a 
temporary dip in 2005, external deficits are expected 
to remain high. 
In 2006, lower real wage increases, due to higher 
inflation and greater wage 
restraint especially in the 
public sector, together with tighter constraints on 
credit growth should have a dampening effect on 
domestic demand. The continuation of tight fiscal 

policies to contain the current account deficit and 
lower employment growth will also have a 
moderating influence. At the same time, investment 

growth is expected to remain 
strong, driven 
by strong 
foreign investment and 
capital inflows as well as 
necessary upgrades in business 
infrastructure in order 
to meet EU requirements. Following the slow-down 
in 2005 due to the floods and other one-off factors, 
the growth of exports of 
goods and services should re-
accelerate again to substantially higher rates. From the 
supply side, the high oil 
price will continue to hold 
back growth in some manufacturing sectors. 

Agriculture should recover fro
m a low base following 
the floods in 20
05, although renewed floods in spring 
2006 may again have a negative impact. Real GDP 
growth is thus expected to
 remain strong, 
but to cool 
down slightly to just 
below 5½% in 2006. 
With rising investment rates and economic 
restructuring continuing, pote
ntial growth should 
gradually increase, with economic growth expected to 
accelerate to around 5¾% in 2007. This will be 

supported by a higher absorption of EU transfers, 
some fiscal expansion due to extra accession-related 
expenditure, and the continuation of strong 

investment growth. Following more moderate wage 
hikes in 2006, higher wage increases are expected in 
2007 which, together with
 a slowdown in inflation, 
should give a boost to
 disposable incomes. 
Growth in merchandise exports is expected to recover 
from a temporary slow down in 2005, while imports 
are set to grow more slowly in line with lower 

domestic demand growth. This will, however, be 
insufficient to bring down 
the trade deficit with a 
further widening to ab
ove 21% of GDP being 
expected for 2006. Terms-of-trade improvements 
should help to k
eep the trade deficit relatively 
constant in 2007, despite a re-acceleration of domestic 
demand and import growth. Improvements in the 
services and transfer balances should limit the 

induced increase in the current account deficit in 2006 
and contribute to a more significant reduction in 2007.

Labour market, costs and prices 
Strong economic growth will 
continue to trigger 
relatively robust employment growth. Unemployment 
is thus set to decrease to well below 10%. With a 

shrinking and rapidly ageing population, participation 
rates will, however, have to increase significantly to 
prevent a decline in the labour force already in the 

short term. This will also lim
it the potential for further 
employment growth, which is therefore expected to 
slow down to around 1% per year. 
Consumer price inflation is expected to accelerate 
further in 2006 to around 7% as increases in excise 
duties on alcohol and cigarettes come on top of the 
hike in oil prices in the seco
nd half of 2005. Due to 
more favourable import price deve
lopments and in the 
absence of inflationary pressures from indirect tax 
increases, inflation should come back down to around 

3½% in 2007. 
Public finances 
As in previous years, the gene
ral government surplus  
turned out much higher in 2005 than originally 
planned. This was mainly due to higher-than-expected 

revenues resulting from higher economic growth (and 
associated higher revenues from VAT and import 
duties), but also from improvements in revenue 

collection and compliance. Conservative revenue 
estimations in the 2006 budget together with the 
relatively moderate wage and pension increases 

foreseen this year should
 enable the government to 
achieve its revised fiscal target of a 3% of GDP 
surplus. Due to higher accession-related expenditure 

needs some fiscal expansion is expected for 2007 with 
the general government surplus dropping below 2% of 
GDP. In line with this fiscal 
stance and continued 
strong growth, gross pub
lic debt as a share of GDP 
will decline further to 
below 25% in 2007.

Forecast
Activity in 2005 
After a record growth of 8.4% in 2004, real GDP 
growth slowed to 4.1% in 20
05, mainly due to the 
negative impact of widespread floods and acceleration 

of structural changes affecting industrial activity. 
Value added declined by 
13.9% in 
agriculture and recorded a modest increase of 2.5% in industry. The 

rapid appreciation of the exchange rate and increasing 
energy prices stepped up th
e restructuring of industry 
and redirected output growth towards higher value-

added sectors such as the automotive, oil processing 
and furniture industries. Gross fixed capital formation 
increased strongly, by 13%, du
e to exceptionally high 
investment in the private sector. It outpaced private 
consumption which gradually decelerated its growth 
from 14.2% in 2004 to 9.7% in 2005 and underwent a 

substitution of own consumptio
n of households for 
purchases of new goods, 
although the latter were still 
growing strongly. A negative contribution of stocks 

by 1.1 of a percentage point to real growth occurred 
due the depletion of agricultural stocks following the 
poor harvest. Imports expanded again more strongly 
than exports. The loss of momentum in export growth 
from 13.9% in 2004 to 7.6% in 2005 is a consequence 

of the adverse shocks affecting the Romanian 
economy in 2005. 
Consumer price inflation d
eclined from 11.9% in 
2004 to 9% in 2005. 
The rise in ad
ministered, 
transport, energy and volatile food prices held back 
the disinflation process, despite a fall in import prices 
due to the rapid appreciation of the currency. 

Employment continued to 
grow, although at a slower 
pace due to the contraction of several labour-intensive 
industries, such as 
textiles, clothing and
 mining. The 
current account deficit wi
dened from about 8.3% of 
GDP in 2004 to 8.7% of 
GDP in 2005, of which more 
than 75% was covered by net foreign direct 
investment.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
In 2006 and 2007 real GDP 
growth is expected to pick 
up to 5.5% and 5.1% respectively. Assuming normal 

weather conditions, agricultural output should bounce 
back to the long-term average growth rate of around 
3% in 2007 while in 2006 it would grow by around 

4.5% due to the low base effect.  The changes in the 
structure of industrial activity, accentuated by EU 
accession, and continued high energy prices will limit 

the growth rate of value added in industry to around 
3% in both 2006 and 2007.  
The pattern of robust increase of gross fixed capital 
formation and deceleration of private consumption is 

expected to extend into 20
06 and 2007. Investment 
will continue to be strong on
 the back of considerable 
FDI inflows, further flood repairs in 2006 and 
acceleration of public investment projects. Private 
consumption growth is likely to ease further to an 

average of 7.5% in 2006 and 6.5% in 2007 as the 
effect of the fiscal reform on disposable incomes will 
by then be fully phased in and the reignited credit 

growth will be subdued by the central bank's 
measures to restrict lending and tighten monetary 
policy. Public consumption is expected to expand 

faster in 2006 and 2007, mainly driven by the increase 
in the public 
sector wage bill.  
Annual average consumer price inflation is expected 
to decelerate to around 5.7% in 2007 assuming that 

the recently started course of tight monetary policy is 
maintained. The ongoing adjustment of administered 
prices and wage growth pressures may negatively 

impact the outcome.  
A modest increase in employment of about 0.2% is 
anticipated for both 2006 and 2007, which is 
somewhat lower than the economic growth rate might 

indicate. The job creation process in the private sector 
will be mitigated by the continuation of lay-offs in 
state-owned enterprises and the shrinkage of the 
labour-intensive light 
industry. Unemployment may 
rise slightly in 2006, but is pr
ojected to return to a 
downward trend from 2007.

 Public finances 
The general government deficit declined from 1.3% of 
GDP in 2004 to 0.4% of 
GDP in 2005 
against the 
background of strong co
llection of cyclically-sensitive indirect taxes and a decline in capital spending. The 
cuts in the income and profit tax rate had a negative 
impact on revenue from direct taxes of about 1% of 

GDP in 2005, and the budget outcome was also 
affected by higher than budgeted increase in public 
sector wages, subsidies and tr
ansfers. Supported by 
strong appreciation of the currency, the stock of 
public debt declined further to around 15% of GDP. 
The general government deficit is projected to expand 

to 2.3% of GDP in 2006 and 5.4% of GDP in 2007 for 
two main reasons. First, 
the envisaged restrain in 
expenditures for goods and services and the public 

wage bill seems difficu
lt to attain. Secondly, a 
Property Fund was established in December 2005 to 
which the State transferred state shareholdings in a 

large number of enterpri
ses. The Fund will 
compensate citizens for the non-re
turn of property 
confiscated during the communist period by 
distributing shares in the Fund to claimants. Under 

ESA 95 accounting rules, th
e adopted scheme is 
expected to have a significant budgetary impact of 
0.9% of GDP in 2006 and 3.1% of GDP in 2007.  
External balances The increase in export volumes growth accompanied 
by a gradual decline in th
e growth of import volumes 
will not prevent a widening
 of the trade deficit from 
9.8% of GDP in 2005 to 13.1% of GDP in 2007. The 

rise in the terms of trade 
recorded in 2005 is not 
expected to continue in 2006 and 2007. Despite a 
foreseen increase in the number of remittances and 

EU transfers, the current account deficit is anticipated 
to widen to around 10.4% of GDP in 2006 and 12% 
of GDP in 2007.

Activity in 2005 
In 2005, real GDP grew stronger than expected by 
4.3%, up from 3.8% in 2004. Growth continued to be 
driven mainly by domestic demand, in particular 

stronger private investment 
growth and higher public 
consumption. Exports of goods
 and services in 2005 
grew by 4.6% in real terms, while imports increased 

by 3.5%. The contribution 
of private consumption to 
growth slightly declined from 2.3 to 2.1 percentage 
points, while gross fixed ca
pital formation added 1.4 
percentage points after 1
.2 percentage points a year 
before. Inventories added 0.6 percentage points to 
growth. Recent high frequen
cy indicators suggest a 
continuation of a rather strong economic performance 
in early 2006. Industrial 
production volume growth 
accelerated to 6.4% year on year in the first quarter of 

2006, following an annual aver
age growth of 5.1% in 
2005.  Annual average consumer price inflation increased 
significantly from 2.1% in 2004 to 3.3% in 2005, as a 

result of shocks on the supp
ly side, resultin
g in higher 
prices for energy (oil), tran
sport and food. Consumer 
prices increased further to 3.4% by March 2006 on a 
twelve months moving average. 
The current account deficit increased to 6.3% in 2005, 
up from 5.2% of GDP a year before. A significant 

trade deficit (24.1% of GDP, up from 23.7% in 2004) 
was not fully compen
sated for a by a higher surplus in 
services (17.1% of GDP, up from 16.4% in 2004). 

Moreover, a higher income balance deficit and a 
lower surplus in tran
sfers added to th
e increase of the 
current account deficit. Net FDI inflows grew by 
around 53% in 2005 to 3.7% of GDP, providing for 
coverage of 59% of th
e current account deficit. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Real GDP growth is expected to
 slightly increase to 
around 4.4% in 2006 and 4.5% in 2007. Continued 

strong credit growth, im
proved consumer confidence, 
and one-off payments to pensioners in the context of a 
phased debt repayment over the next two years will 

push private consumption growth up. It is set to 
accelerate to 3.8% in 2006 and further to 4.3% in 
2007. Public consumption is expected to grow 

stronger than in recent years, by 2% in 2006 and 1.1% 
in 2007, driven by an increase in public sector 
employment by 1% in 2006 and pre-election spending 

prior to the parliamentary elections scheduled for late 
2007. A modest acceleration of gross fixed capital 
formation growth over the reference period (to 5% in 

2006 and 5.2% in
 2007) will result 
from both ongoing 
public investment and stronger private capital 
formation as privatisation and enterprise restructuring 

is expected to continue. The growth of real export will 
accelerate to 5.5% in 2006 and 5.8% in 2007, in 
particular backed by str
ong exports of serv
ices in line 
with the assumption of further improvements of 
tourism performance. As a result of strong private 

consumption, real imports are expected to accelerate 
to 3.6% in 2006 and 4.3% in 2007. Net exports will 
thus contribute 0.5 and 0.3 percentage points to 

growth in 2006 and
 2007, respectively.  
Stability-oriented monetary and exchange rate 
policies will keep inflation at 
relatively low levels over the forecast period. Annual average consumer 

price inflation will slightly 
increase to 3.7% in 2006, 
mainly as a result of continued strong domestic 
demand, further administrative price adjustments and 

higher prices for services provided at the municipal 
level. Inflation will slightly 
fall to 3.5% in 2007.  
Growth and investment dynam
ics are expected to lead 
to a slightly accelerating employment growth from 

0.8% in 2005 to 1.0% in 2006 and 1.2% in 2007 
which supports a gradual reduction of the 
unemployment rate to 12.3%
 by 2007. Following a 
decline in 2005, real wage growth is expected to 
accelerate to 3.5% on average over the forecast 

period, slightly above produc
tivity gains in 2007, 
leading to an increase in real unit labour costs of 0.4% 
in that year.112Chapter 5 Candidate Countries, Croatia   Table 5.1

Public finances 
While the process of moderate fiscal consolidation is 
expected to continue, stronger public consumption 
will prevent a more significan
t deficit reduction. The 
public sector wage bill is forecast to increase due to a 
rise in employment. The share
 of social spending is 
set to rise towards the second half of the forecast 

period and potential risks of overspending will persist 
due to the election year 2007. The general 
government deficit (ESA 95) is expected to be 

reduced from 3.9% of GDP to 3.5% in 2006 and 3.4% 
in 2007. The gross debt to GDP ratio is forecast to 
stay at around the 2005 ratio over the reference 

period. Although nomin
al GDP growth will in itself 
have a reducing effect on the debt ratio, additional 
financing requirements ari
sing from the scheduled 
repayment of pensioner's debt
 are expected to eat up 
revenues from privatisation and thus prevent a 
sizeable public debt reduction.  
External balances The trade deficit to GDP ratio is forecast to only 
marginally decline over the forecast period and stay at 
around 24% of GDP. High import growth, resulting 

from strong private consumption, a slight 
deterioration of the terms of trade as well as a high 
import content of expo
rts will prevent a more 
significant reduction of the 
trade deficit. The surplus 
of the services balance will slightly increase, mostly 
due to a strong tourism performance, and will support 

a gradual but only marg
inal reduction of 
the current 
account deficit to 6.1% of GDP in 2006 and 6% in 
2007. Net foreign direct 
investments, which are 
largely driven by furthe
r major privatisation deals, are 
expected to finance a significant share of the current 
account deficit over the forecast period.

% of GDP
Activity in 2005 
Provisional data points to 
an increase in economic 
activity by about 4% in 2005, compared to a similar 
increase of 4.1% in 2004. Thus, GDP growth was by 

about ¼ percentage point
 stronger than expected. 
However, in view of hi
gh unemployment and low 
capacity utilisation the country's current growth 

potential would be higher. 
Exports and investment 
were the most dynamic elements of the economy, 
while growth of private an
d public consumption 
appears to have remained moderate. Inflation 
continued to remain low, with an increase of 
consumer prices by 0.5% in 2005, after a decline by 

0.4% in 2004. The main f
actors were declining food 
prices, which account for a considerable share in the 
CPI basket.  
External balances improved 
markedly, with a strong 
narrowing of the cu
rrent account deficit from -7.7% 
of GDP in 2004 to -1.4% in 2005. The improvement 
in the trade account 
was less pronounced, with a 
decline from -20.8% of GDP in 2004 to -19.5% in 
2005. Workers remittances rem
ain a large factor 
behind capital inflows finan
cing the current account 
deficit.  After a balanced general g
overnment budget in 2004, 
public sector balances turned 
into a surplus 0.3% of 
GDP, which was nearly 1 percen
tage point better than 
originally budgeted. The main factor for this better 
than planned outcome were higher than expected 

dividends from the state share in the 
telecommunication company
 and lower than budgeted 
spending for public empl
oyment and procurement. 
Due to a transaction in 
order to finance debt 
repayments in early 2006, the gross debt ratio 
increased from 36.5% end of 2004
 to 40.9% end of 
2005.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Overall, economic activity is expected to accelerate. 
The medium-term perspective of EU accession is 
likely to strengthen
 consumer and business 
confidence, which in combination with recent 
measures to improve the busin
ess environment - by simplifying procedures, fi
ghting corruption and 
strengthening the judiciary and regulatory and 
supervisory institutions – will 
lead to stronger private 
consumption and investme
nt. Furthermore, increasing 
capital inflows and strengthened confidence in the 
financial sector have already translated in a marked 
decline in interest 
rates, which should have a positive 
impact on investment. As a result, output growth is 
expected to amount tp 4¼ % in 2006 and could 
further accelerate to 4¾ in 2007. Main driving forces 

will be private investment and consumption, while the 
contribution of net expo
rts will become increasingly 
negative, reflecting stable or
 even slightly declining 
exports, while strong private consumption and 
investment will lead to a further increase in imports. 

As a result, the current account deficit will widen from 1.4% in 2005 to 3¼ % in 2006 and slightly 
above 4% in 2007. However, despite the expected 

decline in workers remittances, improving FDI 
inflows are likely to finance the current account. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Despite the acceleration in economic activity, the 
level of unemployment is likely to remain high, at 

around 35% of the labour force. The stable growth 
performance will lead to an increase of employment 
by some 1¼% in 2006 and about 1½% in 2007. 

However, increased 
labour supply will dampen the 
positive impact on unemployment. However, official 
labour market statistics appear to overstate the 

number of unemployed, as a significant share of 
officially unemployed pers
ons are employed in the 
informal sector, which acco
rding to rough estimates 
could account for up to 30% of GDP. 
Wage growth is likely to
 remain moderate, reflecting 
fiscal discipline in the 
public sector, competitive 
pressures from abroad and th
e high unemployment.

As a result, real unit labour costs are likely to improve 
with a positive impact on 
competitiveness of exports.  
Consumer price inflation 
is likely to increase from 
0.5% as annual average in 2005 to 2½% in 2006 and 

to decline to 1¾% in 2007
. One important reason for 
the pronounced 
rise in 2006 is a one-off increase in 
excise taxes on tobacco 
products, by early 2006. 
Furthermore, energy pr
ices will increase as a lagged 
effect of the recent oil price rises. By 2007, these one-
off factors are expected to fade away, which should 

bring consumer price infl
ation back below 2%.  
Public finances 
After the better than expected performance of public 
finances in 2005, the favourable development is 
expected to continue in 2007. Previous structural 

reforms start to bear fruits, 
such as the administrative decentralisation, which appears to help containing 
current spending. Furthermore, reforms in the health 

sector, such as transparent tendering are likely to 
improve cost efficiency. In view of the favourable 
growth outlook, a general government deficit of about 
¼% of GDP is expected for 2006, which is about ½ 

percentage point better than the official budget target. 
In 2007, the need of co-financing EU assistance might 
lead to a net increase of the deficit by about ½ 

percentage point of GDP, 
thus reaching a general 
government deficit of ¾% of GDP. Debt repayments 
and economic growth will l
ead to a decline in the 
general government debt ratio from 40.9% in 2005 to 
about 35% in 2007. 
External balancesImproving competitiveness is expected to contain the 
negative effect of increased 
global competition in the 
textile sector. However, accelerating consumption and 
investment are likely to lead
 to increasing deficits in 
the trade and current account. Workers remittances 

and other capital inflows, such as increasing FDI, are 
expected to finance those imbalances.

Graph 5.3: 
Turkey - GDP growth 
 %Activity in 2005 
In 2004 and 2005, eco
nomic stabilisation continued 
along with a better balancing of the sources of growth.  
Last year, strong private consumption and investment 

led to an increase in output by 7½%.  Favourable 
base-year effects and leading indicators, such as 
industrial production and capacity utilisation, point to 
continued strong growth in the first months of 2006. 
Inflationary pressures continued to decline, reflecting 
the strength of the Turkish currency and the strict 

fiscal policy of the Turkish 
authorities.  As a result, 
consumer price inflation fell to 7
% in December 
2005, below the year-end target of 8%.  
After three years of strong gr
owth with almost no job 
creation, employment started to increase since mid-
2004 by roughly 2% year-on-
year.  The labour force 
participation rate went slightly down to about 50% in 

tandem with stable unemp
loyment rates at around 
10%.  Public finances remained largely on track, with 
general government achievi
ng a primary surplus of 
6½% of GNP.  This substantial surplus and strong 
GDP growth led to a sharp reduction in the general 
government debt ratio by about 7 percentage points to 
70% in 2005.  The current account deficit widened 
considerably reflecting accelerating domestic demand 

and the strength of the currency, from just over 5% of 
GDP in 2004 to about 6
% of GDP in 2005. 
Prospects for 2006 to 2007 
The overall picture for the forecasting period looks 
favourable.  Turkey should 
be able to maintain strong 
export growth -in particular 
in tourism- while the tight 
fiscal policy stance will support the current 
disinflation process, in spite
 of pressures arising from 
high oil prices and rigi
dities in services prices.   The continued decline in
 inflationary pressures will 
improve predictability and allow for falls in interest 

rates, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous 
years, and improve the investment climate.  Overall, 
output is expected to increas
e by 5½-6% throughout 
the forecasting period. GDP growth is expected to be 
increasingly balanced by domestic demand 
components, with private investment outpacing 

overall growth.  Declining inflation will support 
disposable income and 
allow consumers to maintain 
private consumption growth
 at above 5% in 2006-
2007. Gross fixed capital 
formation will continue to 
benefit from improved macroeconomic stability and 
declining real interest rates. On 
the other hand, the 
accumulation of stocks is forecast to have come to an 
end in 2005.  The strong investment and consumption 
will lead to continued hi
gh growth of imports, in 
particular of consumer dura
bles and capital goods.  
Exports should benefit from diversification and 
quality improvements resulting from earlier high 
investments in exporting sectors.  However, the 
relative strength of the Turkish currency might make 

it more difficult for exporters to benefit from new 
trade opportunities.  
Parliamentary and Presidential elections are due in 
2007.  This might have an important impact on public 

spending.  Any possible impact stemming from policy 
changes in the context of pol
itical events has not been 
incorporated in the current forecast.  
The trend of declining inflati
on is likely to continue.  
Fiscal discipline, improving credibility of the Central 
Bank’s inflation targets and 
the recent strength of the 
currency are important elements in this respect. 

Annual average consumer price inflation is expected 
fall again below 8% during
 the first half of 2006.  
However, high oil and se
rvices prices might slow 
down further disinflation
 in 2006 and 2007. In line 
with the strong growth performance, employment is 
forecast to increase by about 2% per year.  This rise 
more or less corresponds wit
h the rise in labour force, 
so that unemployment rates are expected to stabilize 

around 10% in 2006 and 2007.  
Public finances  
Public sector imbalances are likely to decline 
markedly during 2006-2007, benefiting from the

sustained recovery, declinin
g interest rates driven by 
improved market confidence and a prudent fiscal 
policy stance.  The general government budget deficit 

is therefore forecast to fall to below 1% of GDP by 
2007. The ongoing 
public finance reforms will help to 
widen the tax base and to increase the efficiency of 

tax collection.  Non-interest 
expenditures are seen to 
remain largely constant as a percentage of GDP.   
External balances Growth of imports is expected to remain strong, 
partially reflecting a high 
import content of exports 
and continued strong domest
ic demand.  The current 
account deficit is forecast to widen to 6
% of GDP in 
2006, due to a deterioration of 
the terms of trade and a 
higher deficit of the income balance.  Chiefly due to a 
higher surplus of the services balance and the results 
of strong investment in the export-oriented sectors, 

the deficit is forecast to fall to 6½ in 2007.  The strong 
TRY and current account deficits have been made 
possible by large inflows 
of foreign capital into the 
economy, initially led by
 IMF and financial market 
lending, but more recently dominated by loans to 

Turkish banks and comp
anies and purchases of 
Turkish domestic bonds and shares.

millions
%Continued expansion and imbalances in 2005 
The US economy expanded at a solid 3.5% rate in 
2005, slightly above its 
long-term potential. Weak 
growth in the final quarter 
reflected only temporary or 
special factors, including the economic fall-out from 
unusually severe hurricanes
. The strong underlying 
growth momentum was carried over into 2006. 
Last year's growth was prim
arily driven by a 3.5% 
advance in real personal consumption expenditure. 
This was mainly based on a 2.2 percentage point drop 
in the personal saving 
rate since real disposable 
income increased by only 1.4%. Fixed investment was 
also an important dri
ver of growth: business 
investment increased by 8.6% and residential 

investment by 7.1%. Gover
nment spending rose by 
1.8% and contributed only modestly to growth. A 
negative contribution to growth came again from net 

exports in spite of the fact that 
export growth actually 
exceeded import growth in volume terms for the first 
time since 1995. However, 
this relative improvement 
in trade performance was not 
translated into a positive 
growth contribution since 
imports were 55% greater 
than exports. Unemployment fell to an annual average of 5.1% as 
employment continued to grow moderately. Wage 
inflation was practically flat at a low level and core 

inflation stayed around 2%, but
 headline inflation was 
more elevated due to the energy price developments. 
The trends in the so-called 't
win deficits' continued to 
diverge in 2005. The surge in the current account 
deficit to around $800 billion
 or 6.3% of GDP on a 
national account basis was to a large extent due to a 
sharply higher energy impor
t bill. The decline in the 
fiscal deficit of general government to 3.8% of GDP 
was caused by a temporary surge in tax revenues. 
Housing market slowdown in the offing 
The strong growth momentum – now also supported 
by hurricane rebuilding - sh
ould continue in the first 
half of 2006. Private consumption has regained 
traction after a dip in the second half of last year. 

Consumer confidence is at a so
lid level, helped by 
steady job growth and 
low unemployment. Business 
investment is benefiting from high corporate 

profitability and above-average industrial capacity 
utilisation. Later in 2006, the economy is expected to cool down 
in a lagged response 
to the withdrawal of monetary 
policy accommodation and because of higher energy 
prices. The Federal Reserve has raised the federal 
funds target rate by a combined 375 basis points 

between June 2004 and March 2006. Long-term rates, 
which remained surprisingly low for a very long time, 
have also trended higher since
 the middle of last year.  
Higher interest rates are likely to slow down 
residential construction which – as a share of GDP – 
has reached the highest level since 1980. They are 

also likely to put a brake on house price inflation and 
on private consumption growth. As shown in the 
chart, average house prices have increased rapidly in 

recent years – in many regions probably in excess of 
what fundamentals, including low interest rates, have 
warranted. Rising housing wealth has incited 
households to engage in lo
an-financed consumption 
on an unprecedented scale and contributed to driving 
the personal saving rate into negative territory. This 
process is expected to be much reduced as the housing 
market softens – a development which has already 
been signalled by a number of leading indicators for 

the sector. Although the housing mark
et correction is expected to 
lower overall growth to 
below potential in the second 
half of 2006 and in 2007, the economy should be able 

to avoid a downward sp
iral. A ‘soft landing’ will be 
facilitated by continuing solid
 growth in US export 
markets. Even more important is that the Federal 
Reserve will have considerable leeway in the current 
low-inflation environment to 
embark on a new phase 
of monetary policy easing, if needed.

Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
The forecast projects output to expand strongly in the 
first half of 2006, particularly
 in the first quarter when 
growth will be boosted by a large statistical overhang 

from the preceding quarter. In the second half of the 
year, output growth is expected to fall just below 3% 
annualised. This profile results in an annual growth 
rate of 3.2%. For 2007, the forecast projects continued 
below-potential growth 
with a 2.7% annual growth 
rate. The anticipated deceleration in consumer 

spending over two years should bring the personal 
saving rate back into po
sitive territory. Slowing 
demand growth with largely unchanged productivity 

growth should push the unemployment rate up a bit 
next year. Headline inflation is projected to remain 
close to 3% this year, but to recede more decisively 

next year, which is consistent with the assumed 
energy price development and with more slack in the 
economy in 2007. The general
 government deficit 
should rise back up to more than 4% of GDP as the 
growth in tax revenues normalises. The current 
account deficit is projected to increase to 7% of GDP 
this year, partly because the balance of net investment 

income is likely to deteriorate 
further. In 2007 the 
trade and current account de
ficits should stabilise as 
imports decelerate in line with domestic demand 

while export growth remains at a relatively high level. 
There are risks to the forecasts on both sides. On the 
upside, there is the possibility 
that the housing market 
correction will be delayed or 
that its macroeconomic 
fallout will be weaker than expected. The downside 
risks may be somewhat less likely, but their effect 
more severe if they materialis
e. A sharp rise in long-
term rates, possibly in connection with a loss of 
confidence in the dollar because of the growing 
current account deficit, could 
result in large negative 
wealth effects followed by a recession.

Japan - GDP growth and main components' 
                   contribution
Economic activity improved in 2005 
The Japanese economic expansion broadened further 
beyond the export-related sector in 2005. In the last 
quarter of 2005, GDP grow
th reached 5.4% in 
quarterly annualised terms after having attained 0.8%, 
5.7% and 5.5% respectively in the three preceding 
quarters. GDP growth was driven by both private 

domestic demand (mainly household consumption) 
and net exports (reflecting a decrease in imports).  
In 2005 as a whole, and despite a negative growth 
overhang from the previous year, Japanese growth 

reached 2.7% in 2005 after 2.3% in 2004. While the 
contribution of net exports to GDP growth more than 
halved, that of domestic demand increased 

significantly, to 2.4 percentage points. On the back of 
rising confidence and better employment prospects, 
households significantly increased their consumption 

expenditure. Residential investment started to pick up 
in the second half of the year. Following the revival of 
export growth in the course of the year, the business 

investment cycle was also reinvigorated. Industrial 
production rebounded from 
its mid-2005 soft patch 
and inventory data suggest no problem with demand. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Recent indicators suggest that the Japanese economy 
should continue to expa
nd steadily in the coming 
quarters. The situation in the labour market improved 

markedly in 2005. At 4.1% of the labour force, the 
unemployment rate reached its lowest level since 
1998. Moreover, full-time employment increased in 

2005 for the first year sin
ce 1999. Against this 
backdrop, wages and consumer confidence have 
started to rise and should continue
 to do so in the near 
future. As a result, it is forecast that household 
consumption will maintain its momentum over 2006 

and slightly decelerate next year.  
As suggested in the qu
arterly April Tankan survey 
which showed high and widespread confidence, 
business investment should remain dynamic over the 

coming quarters. High corporate profitability, a sound 
corporate financial situ
ation and the gradual 
absorption of excess productive capacity provide a 

favourable environment 
for dynamic investment 
expenditure.  
On the external side, net exports are expected to 
remain supportive of GDP 
growth as the strength of 
exports (mainly to the 
rest of Asia) should partially 
offset the expected acceleration in imports. Though 
remaining sizeable, Japan's current account surplus is 

forecast to diminish gradually, from 3.6% of GDP in 
2005 to 3.4% in 2007. 
Overall, Japanese GDP growth is forecast to reach 
2.8% in 2006 and to decelerate only marginally to 
2.4% in 2007. 
End of deflation and normalisation of the 
monetary policy framework 
Deflation is gradually bei
ng overcome. In February, 
the headline inflation rate reached 0.4%, while core 
inflation (excluding fresh food
) stood at 0.5%, having 
been positive for five cons
ecutive months. On the 
asset price front, there are signs of increases in land 
prices in some regions. Additionally, bank loan 
growth, which had been negative since 1998, was 

positive (+1.7%) in February for the seventh month in 
a row.In spite of the planned rebasing of the CPI and 
revision of the CPI's weight
s in August 2006, which 
should reduce the inflation ra
te by a couple of tenths 
of a percentage point, he
adline inflation is projected 
to average 0.7% 
in 2006 and 1%
 in 2007.  
In this context, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) decided on 9 
March 2006 to end 
its quantitative easing policy 
framework, which had been in place since March 
2001. It decided to shift 
its operating target for money 
market interventions from the outstand
ing balance of 
current accounts held by co
mmercial banks at the BoJ 
to the uncollateralised overnight call rate. It also

stated that it will encourage
 the latter to remain 
effectively at zero percent for a few months.  
In addition, the BoJ clarified
 its definition of price 
stability by setting a reference target range for the 

year-on-year change in headline CPI at between 0 and 
2% over the medium term. The BoJ is expected to 
drain the currently existin
g excess liquidity in the 
financial system over a 
period of some months. The 
policy rate should remain at zero for some months. At 
a later stage, a first – small – increase in the policy 

rate might be envisaged. In other words, Japan’s key 
policy rate should remain at zero for a couple of 
quarters. 
Government finances have yet to be put on a 
sustainable path Although the fiscal consolidation debate is starting to 
heat up, the government remains cautious toward 
fiscal consolidation. It ret
ains the objective of 
reducing the primary balance by around 0.5 
percentage points annually so
 as to achieve the target 
of primary balance in th
e early 2010s. However, population ageing and the projected higher interest 
payments still leave Japanese public finances on an 
unsustainable path.  
While the reduction in expenditure should continue, a 
significant increase in revenues (which might involve 

a reform of the income 
tax or an increase in the VAT 
rate) also seems necessary.

Graph 6.3: 
China - External trade
2005, another year of very robust growth 
China's GDP was revised upwards in December 2005, 
mainly due to an upward re
vision of the size of the 
service sector. GDP growth in 
2005 is now officially 
estimated at 9.9%, only slig
htly lower than 
the 10.1% growth rate now estimated fo
r 2004. The very robust 
2005 GDP growth rate was underpinned by still high 

investment spending and su
rging net exports. Fixed 
investment growth decelerat
ed only slightly 
(averaging 27.2% in 2005), with less investment in 

sectors suffering from overcapacity (steel, cement, 
aluminium, real estate) and a 
reorientation towards 
under-invested sectors (transpo
rtation infrastructure, 
energy). Net export growth strongly accelerated in 
2005, with the trad
e surplus tripling from $32 bn in 
2004 to a record $102 bn 
in 2005. The surge in the 
2005 trade surplus essentially reflected a sharp 
deceleration of import growth due to some 
moderation of investment 
growth, excess stocks of 
some commodities and intermediate goods, an 
increase in the supply of some domestic import 
substitutes and the postponemen
t of foreign purchases 
of big items in anticipation of a renminbi revaluation. 
However, the contribution 
of external trade to GDP 
growth diminished towards th
e end of 2005, in the 
context of a real effective appreciation of the renminbi 
of about 10% in the course of 2005. Domestic 

consumption continued to grow at a healthy pace, 
underpinned by strong income growth in both urban 
and rural areas. 
A somewhat more balanced economy than earlier 
data suggested  
After the December revision, the tertiary sector 
accounted for 41% of 2004 GDP, up from 32% 

previously. This sugg
ests a more resilient composition 
of demand, as services as an engine of growth are 
more independent of the investment cycle and volatile 

external demand. The revised GDP figure also implies 
a lower share of fixed investment in GDP (39% of 
2004 GDP post-revision 
versus 46% pre-revision). This somewhat weakens the picture of a generalised 
overinvestment problem. However, investment in 
some sectors (such as metal refining and construction) 

is still very large and investment growth remains well 
above the objective set by 
government for this year 
(+18%).  
Some easing in monetary policy, against the 
background of lower inflationary pressures 
After two years of restrictive monetary policy and 
administrative controls on bank lending (including the 
marked cutting down of
 funding for the infrastructure 
and property sectors), the central bank began in mid-
2005 to timidly ease its policy stance by encouraging 

banks to continue their lending to "good" projects and 
sectors and increased liquidity to banks. As a result, 
money growth (M2) accelerated modestly in the 

second half of 2005 (from 14.6% on average in H105 
to 17.6% in H205). Also, cred
its to the construction 
sector grew by 10% on average in the second half of 

2005, after one and a half years of negative growth. 
However, total credit growth remained moderate, 
averaging 10% in 2005.  
Year-on-year inflation sharply decelerated in 2005 to 
1.8% (from 3.9% in 2004), despite higher raw 
material and energy costs and 
continued strong output 
growth. This was largely due to a reversal of earlier 

food price increases following high
er agricultural 
production. Increased capacity 
from strong investment 
and persistent productivity 
gains have helped to keep 
non-food inflation in check. Furthermore, due to price 
controls, surging oil prices 
did not automatically 
translate into higher consumer prices in China. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
GDP growth is projected to slow down modestly, 
averaging about 9.5%
 in 2006, before further slowing 
to about 9% in 2007. 
The slowdown is expected to

mainly come from a reduction of net export growth, 
against the background of a slowdown of the US 
economy and assuming a gradually appreciating 

domestic currency. Investment is likely to remain 
restricted in sectors experiencing excessive fixed 
investments, but boosted 
in under-invested areas. 
Domestic demand is expected to increasingly become 
a more important driver for growth, supported by 
government efforts to bo
ost income growth and job 
creation. Inflation is likely to increase moderately, 
reflecting rising food, en
ergy and utility prices. 
The balance of risks in the short term is probably 
more on the upside  
The banking system remains very liquid and foreign 
exchanges reserves continue to rise rapidly, albeit at a 
somewhat lower pace than in 2004. The ample 
liquidity in the banking system could trigger a 

rebound in lending and i
nvestment. In addition, 
investment spending rebounded in the first quarter of 
2006, in particular in the construction and metal 
sectors.  If this trend contin
ues and expands to other 
sectors, investment could re-accelerate in 2006, which 

could increase overcapacity and non-performing loans 
problems. This would lead to a higher-than-forecast 
growth rate in the short term but would increase the 

risk of bust at a later stage.

1. The directorate general for
 economic and financial affairs (DG 
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fully-
fledged economic forecasts twice a year: in the spring and in the 

autumn. These forecasts cover the principal macroeconomic 
aggregates for the Member States, the Acceding andCandidate
Countries, the European Union as 
a whole, the euro area and the 
international environment. Interim forecasts, updating the outlook 
for the five largest Member States, the EU-25 and the euro area, are 
presented in between the fully-fledged forecasts. 
2. Data for 2005 are estimates and those for 2006 and 2007are 
forecasts. The sources for all tables are the Commission services, 
except where it is stated otherwise. In general, the historical data for 
the Member States are based on ESA 95. The forecasts for 12 
Member States (namely CZ, DE, ES, FR, IE, IT, LT, AT, PL, PT, SI 
and SK) have been made using chain-linked volume measures. For 

the USA and Japan the definitions are as in the SNA.  
3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand, respectively, 
present data including inventories. 4. In Table 16, the data are based on the national index for USA and 
Japan, and for EU Member 
States and the aggregates prior to 1996. 
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential 
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in 
the capital stock and the difference between actual unemployment 
and the NAIRU play a key role. The labour component has been 
replaced by average hours worked per year and person in 

employment (thereby also including self-employment) in absolute 
level terms in the autumn 2005 economic forecast. The cyclical 
adjustment of budgetary balances is based on this concept.  
6. Employment data are based on numb
ers of persons employed. The 
concept of full-time equivalent (FTE) is used for Spain, France, 
Italy, the Netherlands and Estonia. Tables 21-27 and 31-32 use data 

on FTE for these countries.  7. The nominal short-term interest rates are defined as the 3-month 
inter-bank rates. The nominal long-term interest rates are defined as 
the yield on the central government benchmark 10-year bond. 
8. EU25 and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates. 
World GDP is aggregated using Purc
hasing Power Standards (PPS). 
In the tables on world trade and international payments, the 
aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates. 
Tables 48-52, 60 and 61 show also 
EU25 and euro area "adjusted" 
balances. Theoretically, balances of EU25 and euro area vis-à-vis 
third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of the 
individual countries in the EU25 or
 the euro area. However, intra-
EU25 or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of reporting 
errors.  The creation of the internal market in 1993 reduced border controls 
and formalities, and accordingly the scope and precision of intra-EU 
trade coverage. Typically, intra-EU imports are underestimated 
compared to intra-EU exports, leading to an overestimation of the 

surplus. For the past, the "adjusted" balances are Eurostat (for 

EU25) estimates and ECB (for euro area) estimates. For the future, 
they are ECFIN's forecasts based on the extrapolation of the 
discrepancies observed in 2004 or 2005. 
9. Tables 37, 38, 39 and 42 are based on government deficit and debt 
data for the period 2002-2007, as 
transmitted by Member States to 
the European Commission in April 2006. In publishing these data, 

Eurostat maintained its reservation concerning the quality of the 
reported data in Greece. Eurostat also questioned the treatment of 
the assumption of the debt of the railway company by the Belgian 
government in 2005. The data are according to ESA95. Interest 
expenditure includes settlements under swap arrangements and 
forward rate agreements (T
ables 35, 37, 38 and 40).  
10. The allocation of mobile phone licences (UMTS) impacts strongly 
on the general government accounts for some countries in 2000-
2007. Tables 36, 37 and 39 include th
e amounts from the sale of the 
licences, while the cyclically adjusted balances in tables 40 and 41 
exclude these amounts. The amounts in bn of national currency are 
for BE 0.5, for CZ 7.4, for DK 3.2, for DE 50.8, for EE 0.2, for EL 

0.7, for ES 0.5, for FR 
1.8, for IE 0.2, for IT
 13.8, for HU 52.0, for 
NL 2.7, for AT 0.8, for
 PL 8.2, for PT 0.4, 
for SI 24.3, for SK 3.0, 
for UK 22.5, for EU25 110.5, and for euro area 72.2. 11. Second pillar pension funds are included in the general government 
sector in the following Member States (with the estimated effect as 
% of GDP indicated in brackets): DK (1.1 in 2001, 1.0 in 2002, 1.1 

in 2003, 1.0 in 2004-07), HU (0.7
 in 2001-02, 0.9 
in 2003, 1.1 in 
2004, 1.3 in 2005 and 1.4 in 2006-07)
, PL (1.5 in 2001, 1.9 in 2002, 
1.6 in 2003, 1.8 in 2004-05,
 2.0 in 2006, 1.9 in 2007), SK (0.8 in 
2005, 1.3 in 2006 and 1.4 in 2007) 
and SE (0.9 in 2001-03, 1.0 in 
2004-07). According to the Eurostat decisions of 2 March and 23 
September 2004, these pension schemes should be classified outside 
the government sector by spring 2007. This will lead to an increase 

in the government deficits by the amounts indicated above. 
12. German, EU25 and euro-area 
figures are for unified Germany from 
1991 onwards; from 1992 onwar
ds for percentage changes.  
13. With respect to the RAMS (recently-acceded Member States) and 
the acceding countries, which are currently in a transition phase, the 
quality of statistical data may not always be directly comparable to 

most EU15 Member States. 
14. Geographical zones are defined as follows :  
Euro area:  EUR12 (EU15 excluding DK, SE and the UK). 
Acceding countries: Bulgaria and Romania.
Candidate countries:  Croatia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey. 
Industrialised Countries:  EU25, Acceding and Candidate Countries, USA, Japan, 
 Canada, Norway, Switzerland,
 Iceland, Australia and New 
 Zealand. 

MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa):   Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran
, Iraq, Israel, Jo
rdan, Kuwait, 
 Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Om
an, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, 
 Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. 
Asia: All countries except Japan and the Asian MENA countries. 
Latin America: 

 All countries. 
Sub-Saharian Africa:
