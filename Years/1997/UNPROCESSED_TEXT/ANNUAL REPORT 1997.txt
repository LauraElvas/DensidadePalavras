Convention used in the Report:
Aggregate EU-15 figures in this report are generally constructed using purchasing parity exchange rates in
order to weight the individual national data. However, trade data use actual exchange rates in 1993. Rates
and indices (except CPI) are based on 1993 GDP weights, while CPI is based upon consumer spending
weights.

This report was finalised in early May 1998.

Foreword

particularly encouraging to see that domestic
demand is picking up across the EU and is
making a major contribution to real GDP
growth. That said, it is disappointing to note
that fixed investment growth remains
historically weak in a number of countries,
despite favourable underlying fundamentals.
Moreover, the performance of the EU
labour market is still unsatisfactory. The
high levels of youth and long-term
unemployment, as well as the lack of
sustained job creation, point to the structural
nature of a major part of EU unemployment
and the need for countervailing structural
measures to increase market flexibility.
The Annual Report of the European
Monetary Institute (EMI) for 1997 is the
fourth and last such document to be
published by the Institute. The final phase of
the transition to Stage Three started with
the confirmation by the Heads of State or
Government on 2/3 May 1998 of the
Member States which fulfil the necessary
conditions for the adoption of the single
currency and the pre-announcement of
the bilateral exchange rates to be used in
determining the irrevocable conversion rates
for the euro. Since the beginning of 1994
the EMI, in close collaboration with national
central banks of the European Union (EU),
has undertaken the necessary technical
preparations for the establishment of the
European System of Central Banks (ESCB),
the conduct of the single monetary policy
for the euro area and the creation of the
single currency. This task will be completed
by its successor, the European Central
Bank (ECB).
As in past years, the Report describes the
economic, monetary and financial situation
in the EU in 1997, outlines the activities of
the EMI and includes its annual accounts.
As regards the overall macroeconomic
situation in the EU, the recovery appears to
be gathering strength, and the crisis in Asia
has not apparently had a significant adverse
effect on economic growth to date. It is

XIV

Meanwhile, the rate of inflation in the EU in
1997 was at its lowest level for many years,
with an increasing number of countries
recording inflation of 2% or less. By and
large, the first stage of the upturn is not
giving rise to significant inflationary pressures,
thus enabling low interest rates to be
broadly maintained in the majority of EU
countries and significant declines in interest
rates to occur in a number of others. For
the countries adopting the single currency,
it will be essential to maintain this
environment of broad price stability and to
ensure that the emerging common level of
short-term interest rates is consistent with
price stability in the euro area as a whole.
As highlighted in the EMI’s recent
examination
of
macroeconomic
convergence, further challenges for the
future relate to fiscal policy. In particular,
with regard to the future euro area, it is
imperative that all Member States should
re-establish as soon as possible a degree of
budgetary flexibility which will allow them
to respond to adverse cyclical developments.
Such flexibility will be ensured by achieving
a fiscal position close to balance or in
surplus over the medium term. In some
cases substantial and persistent overall fiscal
surpluses will also be necessary in order to
reduce the burden arising from very high
ratios of debt to GDP, render national
budgets less vulnerable to changes in interest

rates and prepare for the impact on public
finances of the ageing of the population.
Preparatory work for Stage Three
proceeded as planned in 1997 in strict
compliance with the timetable. From among
the many areas in which we achieved
significant results, I should like to mention
the following in particular:
in the field of strategy, progress with
regard to the identification of suitable
candidate strategies for Stage Three
(elaborating an agreed set of key
elements which will characterise the
ESCB’s strategy) and the development
of the analytical and econometric
infrastructure necessary to support
monetary policy decision-making;
definition of the technical specification
for the ESCB’s operational framework
and the setting-up of the tools and IT
systems necessary for the implementation
of the future monetary policy of the
ESCB;
marked progress towards the
implementation of the statistical
requirements for the conduct of the

single monetary policy in Stage Three,
thus enabling data compiled in line with
the new agreed basis to be made
available to the ECB during the course
of 1998;
finalisation of a draft agreement on the
ERM II, to be endorsed by the ECB;
progress with regard to organisational
aspects, implementation and testing of
the ESCB’s IT infrastructure and the
TARGET system; and
publication of the final designs for the
euro banknotes.
In its short life the EMI has carried out
thorough technical preparations for Stage
Three of EMU which now enable us to
look forward with confidence to the
introduction of the single currency at the
beginning of 1999. The solid foundations
laid by the EMI should help the ESCB/ECB
to develop into a strong institution which
will pursue its primary objective of
maintaining price stability in the euro area
in a determined manner, thereby providing
the conditions necessary for sustained
economic growth.

Executive summary

Executive summary
The Annual Report 1997 is the last report
to be published by the European Monetary
Institute (EMI). As in the previous three
Annual Reports, the EMI aims to provide an
overview of all aspects related to its tasks as
set out in the Treaty establishing the
European Community. 1 In accordance with
Article 11 of the EMI Statute, the Report
covers both economic, monetary and
financial conditions in the Community up to
the end of 1997 and the activities of the
EMI; it also presents the Institute’s annual
accounts. As in the past, the material
presented in this year’s Report draws to a
significant extent on earlier, more extensive
EMI publications. In particular, in March
1998 the EMI published its Convergence
Report in fulfilment of Article 109j (1) of

the Treaty. Moreover, the “Second progress
report on the TARGET project” was
published in September 1997 and in the
same month “The single monetary policy in
Stage Three: General documentation on
ESCB monetary policy instruments and
procedures” was issued. A list of documents
published by the EMI in 1997 and early
1998 is provided at the end of this Report.
The confirmation on 2/3 May 1998 by the
Heads of State or Government of the
Member States which will adopt the single
currency heralded the start of the final
phase of the transition to Stage Three,
which includes the establishment of the
ESCB and the ECB and the liquidation of
the EMI.

1 Economic, monetary and financial conditions in the
European Union
Economic and financial background in 1997
Global economic conditions continued to
be broadly favourable in 1997, with the
notable exception of developments in Asia
during the latter half of the year. Initially,
real GDP growth in the EU followed the
pattern of subdued developments also
observed in early 1996. However, the pace
of economic activity quickened thereafter
and, from the second quarter onwards, the
growth rate was significantly higher than in
the comparable period of 1996. The crisis
in Asia did not have a significant adverse
impact on growth in 1997. Average real
GDP growth for the EU is estimated to
have been 2.7%, which is significantly higher
than the rate of 1.7% recorded in 1996.
The acceleration in activity was widespread,
with stronger growth being recorded in
almost all EU countries, although there
continued to be differences in the strength
of economic activity.

2

For the Union as a whole, the improved
real growth performance in 1997 was
principally due to domestic demand. For
the fourth successive year, net trade in
goods and services provided a positive,
albeit small, stimulus to growth, underpinned
by subdued growth in relative unit labour
costs and, as a result, improvements in
competitiveness. The rise in domestic
demand was linked to an improvement in
investment growth and an increase in
stockbuilding, while growth in private
consumption was unchanged and
government consumption was weaker than
in 1996. However, continuing the pattern

Statute or the ESCB/ECB Statute are references to

Monetary Institute and Protocol No. 3 on the
Statute of the European System of Central Banks

form an integral part thereof.

observed since the early 1990s, fixed
investment growth in 1997 - although
stronger than in the previous year continued to be below the levels typical of
past decades, despite satisfactory profit
margins and a high level of industrial
confidence, as well as relatively high capacity
utilisation rates for the manufacturing sector.
Both exports and imports grew considerably
more strongly than in 1996, partly reflecting
the resurgence of growth within the EU
(which increased intra-EU trade) and
buoyant economic conditions globally.
Against the background of strengthening
economic growth in the EU as a whole,
employment has increased only marginally,
while unemployment has remained stubbornly
high. The unemployment rate for the EU as
a whole (measured on the basis of
EUROSTAT data) fell slightly during the
course of 1997, from 10.8% in the fourth
quarter of 1996 to 10.5% in the fourth
quarter of 1997. Of particular concern are
the much higher levels of youth and longterm unemployment. The concentration of
unemployment in these categories as well
as the persistence of subdued employment
creation point to the structural nature of a
major part of EU unemployment and to the
continued need for structural measures.
Concerning achievements in macroeconomic
convergence, in accordance with Article
109j (1) of the Treaty, at the end of March
1998 the EMI presented its report to the
EU Council on the progress made in the
fulfilment by the Member States of their
obligations regarding the achievement of
Economic and Monetary Union. This
Convergence Report included an
examination of the achievement of a high
degree of sustainable convergence by
reference to the fulfilment by each Member
State of the convergence criteria, as set out
in the Treaty. It therefore covered the
performance of individual EU countries in
terms of the degree of price stability,
government debt and deficit positions, longterm interest rates and exchange rates. The

summary of the examination of convergence
by the EMI, which included developments
in 1997, is provided in an annex to this
Annual Report.

Monetary policies in Member States
As regards monetary policies, the economic
and financial environment in 1997 allowed
for a continuation of the convergence of
short and long-term interest rates and
broadly stable exchange rates. The majority
of EU countries (namely Belgium/
Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany, France,
the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and
Sweden) broadly maintained low interest
rates. This mirrored a situation of price
stability against a background of narrowing
- but generally still negative - output gaps,
benign wage behaviour and the
consolidation efforts of fiscal authorities.
Official and key interest rates remained at
low and closely aligned levels, although
they were raised to a small extent in the
autumn in response to inflation risks. The
concerted nature of these policy actions
strengthened the cohesion among those
countries with closely aligned interest rates.
Several other Member States (Spain, Italy,
Portugal and initially also Greece) were
able to continue the process of reducing
interest rates in line with the degree of
convergence of their overall economic
fundamentals, notably in respect of the
achievement of price stability, with the
countries referred to in the paragraph
above. Short and long-term interest rates in
these countries thus tended to follow a
downward trend, progressively converging
towards the lower level of the closely
aligned countries. Monetary policy in the
two remaining EU countries (namely Ireland
and the United Kingdom) was tightened,
albeit to differing degrees, in response both
to buoyant economic and monetary growth
and to heightened inflation risks against
a background of continued sound
fundamentals. The widening of short-term

3

interest rate differentials against Germany
was accompanied by a further strong
appreciation of the respective currencies
vis-à-vis the Deutsche Mark. Later in the
year, however, short-term interest rates in
Ireland began to decline relative to
Germany and the Irish pound moved closer
to its central rates in the ERM grid.

Economic prospects and challenges
Economic forecasts released by major
international organisations in spring 1998
suggest that growth prospects for the EU in
1998 and 1999 are favourable, as domestic
demand should strengthen further, offsetting
to some extent an expected deterioration
in the external environment due to, inter
alia, the crisis in Asia. The continuation of
stability-oriented monetary policies
combined with wage moderation, with the
latter partly reflecting the persistence of
relatively high rates of unemployment, and
still negative output gaps in certain countries
are expected to limit inflationary pressures.
In addition, the decline in oil prices, provided
that it is by and large sustained, and the
counter-inflationary impact of the Asian
crisis - arising from a depreciation of certain
Asian currencies and the moderation of
global growth - should contribute to
dampening inflationary pressures from the
outside. Risks to the inflation outlook relate
to, inter alia, the possibility of a faster than
expected pick-up in aggregate demand in
the EU and thus to a closing of output gaps,
the development of wages, a further
appreciation of the US dollar and, in the
light of the latest OPEC agreement, a
sustained reversal of the recent decline in
oil prices. The main uncertainty with regard
to the above outlook stems from the
external environment. World output and
trade growth are expected to be weaker in
1998 and 1999 than in 1997 owing to a
sharp decline in real GDP growth in parts
of Asia, a modest slowdown in the US
growth rate and a deterioration in the
economic and financial situation in Japan.

4

The extent of the weakness in the external
environment arising from the turmoil in
Asia will depend on the scope and timing of
the adjustment of macroeconomic policies
in the countries affected and on the extent
to which financial reforms are implemented.
The possibility of further spillover effects
cannot yet be ruled out. The contractionary
impact of the Asian crisis on EU growth
may be partly offset by two factors: first, the
decline in long-term interest rates in the EU
as well as in the United States - which is
linked to, inter alia, investors’ reassessment
of the risk in emerging markets; and, second,
the marked decline in commodity prices,
which may contribute to a further rise in
real incomes.
With regard to convergence, an excerpt
from the EMI’s Convergence Report,
published in March 1998, is provided in an
annex to this Report. Therein, it is stated
that, notwithstanding recent achievements,
further substantial consolidation is warranted
in most Member States in order to achieve
lasting compliance with the fiscal criteria
and the medium-term objective of having a
budgetary position that is close to balance
or in surplus, as required by the Stability
and Growth Pact. This applies in particular
to Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France,
Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and Portugal,
where deficits in 1998 are forecast to be
between 1.6 and 2.9% of GDP. For most of
these countries, these consolidation
requirements also apply when comparing
the fiscal deficit ratios as projected in the
Convergence Programmes for 1999-2000
with the medium-term objective of the
Stability and Growth Pact. Taking a broader
view on the sustainability of fiscal
developments, the case for sustained
consolidation over an extended period of
time, requiring substantial fiscal surpluses, is
particularly strong for those countries with
debt ratios of above 100% (Belgium, Greece
and Italy). This compares with significant
overall deficits in 1997 and the years before.
In countries with debt ratios of significantly
above 60% but below 80% of GDP, keeping

the deficit ratio at current levels would in
most cases not bring down the debt ratio
to below 60% within an appropriate period
of time, which indicates the need for
further, in some cases substantial,
consolidation.
In the remaining months of Stage Two, the
primary objective of the monetary policies
of the countries selected to participate in
the euro area is to ensure that the current
environment of broad price stability is
maintained for the euro area as a whole,
thereby providing the ESCB with a
favourable starting position. The majority of
countries selected to participate in the
euro area have already achieved shortterm interest rates which are closely aligned
at a low level. The conditions in the first
part of 1998 have allowed this common
position to be firmly consolidated and the
remaining members have been able to
maintain the downward trend in their key
interest rates. This suggests that a de facto
common monetary policy stance is tending
to emerge in the selected euro area
countries, against a background of broadly
stable prices and exchange rates. By the
end of 1998 at the latest, those countries’
short-term interest rates will have converged
to a common level which will be consistent
with the objective of maintaining price
stability in the euro area. This overall
pattern of convergence in short-term
interest rates is consistent with a situation
on the eve of Stage Three in which market

exchange rates between the countries
selected to participate in the euro area are
equal to the pre-announced bilateral
exchange rates which will be used in
determining the irrevocable conversion rates
for the euro. These pre-announced bilateral
exchange rates are consistent with economic
fundamentals and are compatible with
sustainable convergence.
During the remainder of Stage Two, the
Governing Council and the Executive Board
of the ECB will finalise the preparations
needed for the conduct of the single
monetary policy in the euro area as of
1 January 1999. In the meantime, the
participating national central banks will retain
their national monetary powers. The
institutional changes entailed in the
establishment of the ESCB and the ECB
provide a suitable framework within which
the participating national central banks will
be able to engage in close co-operation
with a view to co-ordinating their national
monetary policies in order to achieve the
primary objective of maintaining price
stability in the euro area. Furthermore, in
accordance with Article 44 of the ESCB/
ECB Statute, the ECB is to take over the
tasks of the EMI which still need to be
performed in Stage Three of EMU, given
the existence of Member States with a
derogation. The General Council of the
ECB is to assume responsibility for relations
with the national central banks of the noneuro area Member States.

In publishing its report on the “The single
monetary policy in Stage Three - Elements
of the monetary policy strategy of the
ESCB” in February 1997, the EMI, having
reviewed a number of alternatives, identified

two strategies - intermediate monetary
targeting and direct inflation targeting - as
potential candidates for Stage Three. It also
indicated that, regardless of the final choice
made in this respect by the ESCB, the
strategy would be characterised by five key
elements which are an indispensable part of

5

any strategy: the announcement of a
quantified definition of the final objective of
price stability and the announcement of
specific targets against which its performance
can be assessed; the use of a broad set of
indicator variables in the setting of policy; a
privileged role for monetary aggregates
and, finally, the ESCB having at its disposal
its own forecasts of inflation and other
variables. Following the publication of this
report, work at the EMI in the field of
strategy concentrated on the development
of the infrastructure necessary to support
monetary policy decision-making, including
the development of various econometric
tools and procedures for preparing policy
decisions.
After the conceptual phase, which was
concluded at the end of 1996, the
preparatory work dealing with the
instruments and procedures necessary for
implementing the single monetary policy
was devoted to defining the technical
specifications for the ESCB’s operational
framework and to the setting-up of the
ESCB tools necessary for the implementation
of the future monetary policy of the ESCB.

used in monetary policy operations with
the ESCB. The risk control measures to be
applied in the use of these assets have also
been specified, taking into account market
practices.
As monetary policy operations will be
implemented on a decentralised basis,
the main preparatory work for the
implementation of monetary policy
instruments has been undertaken by the
NCBs, for the technical infrastructure as
well as for the legal requirements. An ESCB
internal infrastructure is being prepared for
the execution of open market operations,
and the EMI is developing the systems
required to establish and publish the lists of
individual eligible assets, possibly with the
exception of certain categories of nonmarketable assets, and eligible counterparties.
Another crucial project for the implementation
of the single monetary policy is the settingup of an effective system of liquidity
management relying on the exchange of
an integrated daily flow of information
between the NCBs and the ECB.

Foreign exchange policy
The main developments in terms of the
technical features of the monetary policy
operations in 1997 relate to the procedures,
time frame and calendar for ESCB tenders;
to the settlement modalities of open market
operations; and to the implications of the
end-of-day procedures for the use of
standing facilities. The preparatory work
necessary to enable the ESCB to apply
minimum reserve requirements as from the
start of Stage Three, if the Governing
Council of the ECB decides in favour of
having such a system, is currently being
carried out. This included the further
elaboration of the draft EU Council
Regulation on minimum reserves, the main
operational mechanisms of the minimum
reserves system and the specification of the
potential reserve base. Common eligibility
criteria have been defined for the
counterparties and the eligible assets to be

6

In the context of future foreign exchange
policy co-operation between Member States
participating in the euro area and other EU
countries, work has been conducted in
1997 at the level of both the ECOFIN
Council and the EMI, in accordance with
the broad lines defined in a report the EMI
submitted on this issue to the Dublin meeting
of the European Council in December
1996. The European Council held in
Amsterdam in June 1997 approved a
Resolution relating to the new exchange
rate mechanism to be introduced in Stage
Three of EMU. In parallel, the EMI has
finalised the draft agreement between the
ECB and future non-euro area central
banks, which lays down the operating
procedures for the ERM II; the draft
agreement will be submitted to the ECB for
endorsement following its establishment.

Implementation work on the conduct of
potential foreign exchange intervention
focused on aspects related to the required
operational framework and information
systems support, which will make it possible
for the ESCB to execute intervention.
Work has been undertaken in order to
facilitate the decision on the amount and
the modalities of the initial transfer of
foreign reserve assets from the NCBs to
the ECB at the beginning of Stage Three, in
accordance with Article 30.1 of the ESCB/
ECB Statute. Work has also been initiated
to prepare complementary Community
legislation which will enable the ECB, in
accordance with Article 30.4 of the ESCB/
ECB Statute, to make further calls on the
NCBs’ foreign reserve assets beyond the
limit of E 50 billion set in Article 30.1. A
monitoring framework has been designed
for market transactions conducted by the
NCBs with foreign reserve assets in excess
of those transferred to the ECB with a view
to ensuring consistency with the euro area
single monetary and foreign exchange rate
policies. A similar monitoring framework
will be put in place for transactions
performed by euro area Member States
and changes in their foreign exchange
working balances. The EMI has also
conducted work to prepare procedures for
the computation and publication of
reference exchange rates for the euro.
The Luxembourg European Council held in
December 1997 stated in its conclusions
that “the bilateral exchange rates which will
be used to determine the conversion rates
of the euro will be announced on 3 May
1998 for those Member States participating
in the euro from the start”. The Joint
Communiqué issued on 2 May 1998 by the
Ministers and central bank governors of the
EU Member States participating in the euro
area, the European Commission and the
EMI, as the forerunner of the ECB, clarifies
that these rates are the ERM bilateral
central rates and the method to be used on
31 December 1998 for setting the
irrevocable euro rates will be the regular

daily concertation procedure. The euro
area NCBs stand ready to ensure the
equality between the market exchange
rates ascertained in the concertation
procedure and the pre-announced ones.
The exchange rates of the official ECU visà-vis the currencies of the euro area
Member States set through this procedure
will be adopted by the Council as the
irrevocable conversion rates for the euro
on and with effect from 1 January 1999.

Statistics
Wide-ranging statistical requirements for
the conduct of policy in Stage Three were
set out in documents released by the EMI
in July 1996. Much of 1997 was spent in
implementing these requirements and
clarifying points of detail where necessary.
Though some areas of difficulty remain, the
introduction of the necessary statistical
changes has proceeded smoothly on the
whole, and data on the new agreed basis
covering the future single currency area
will become available to the EMI/ECB during
the course of 1998. Further consideration
has been given to the organisation of
statistical work at the European level, in
particular in areas where the EMI/ECB and
the Commission (EUROSTAT) will share
responsibility; the legal framework for
statistics in Stage Three has been further
developed; and by the end of 1997 most of
the work on electronic data transmission
within the ESCB had been done, with
progress also in the development of the
internal systems to handle data in the ECB.

Payment systems
In the field of payment systems, the EMI’s
“Second progress report on the TARGET
(Trans-European Automated Real-time
Gross settlement Express Transfer) project”
which was released in September 1997
provided further information on the progress
made with regard to organisational aspects

7

and the implementation of the system. In
particular, it addressed the following issues:
1) operating time; 2) pricing policies;
3) intraday liquidity to non-euro area NCBs;
4) the role of the ECB in TARGET; and
5) TARGET implementation. TARGET
testing is well on track. A brochure describing
the main features of the TARGET system
was released in May 1998 and a TARGET
operating days calendar will be published
in August 1998.
In the field of securities settlement systems
(SSSs), preparatory work focused on two
main aspects: the establishment of standards
for the use of SSSs in ESCB credit operations
and the implementation of short-term
solutions for the cross-border use of
collateral. The standards and the underlying
analysis are described in the EMI’s report
entitled “Standards for the use of Securities
Settlement Systems in ESCB credit
operations”, which was released on 8 January
1998. These standards cover three main
areas: legal issues, settlement and custody
risks, and operational issues. Moreover, in
July 1997 the EMI Council decided to adopt
the correspondent central banking model
(CCBM) as an interim solution before the
establishment of appropriate links between
SSSs in order to facilitate the cross-border
use of collateral in ESCB operations
(monetary policy and intraday credit
operations).

Preparation of euro banknotes
The draft designs for the euro banknotes
which were chosen by the EMI Council in
December 1996 were developed into final
designs in the course of 1997. Illustrations
of the revised designs were published in
July 1997. These form the basis for the
origination work, in the context of which
the designs are being transformed into
printing plates in the first half of 1998. In
1997, in order to identify potential problems
at the earliest possible stage, all the
techniques which will be used for euro

8

banknote production were tested within
the context of a test banknote project. The
project revealed that all the participating
printing works should be in a position to
produce all the euro banknote
denominations to an equal standard of
quality and with an identical appearance.
With regard to protection of the euro
banknotes, the EMI Council has agreed to
use the copyright © symbol on the euro
banknotes and, to increase efficiency in
combating counterfeiting, to set up a joint
investigation centre and a database on
counterfeit euro banknotes. The date for
the launch of the euro banknotes and coins
has been fixed at 1 January 2002. With
regard to Article 52 of the ESCB/ECB
Statute, which commits the Governing
Council of the ECB to take the necessary
measures to ensure that banknotes
denominated in currencies with irrevocably
fixed exchange rates are exchanged by the
NCBs at their respective par value, a
majority of the members of the EMI Council
has reached a basic agreement on the
mechanisms which will be involved in
exchanging and repatriating national
banknotes between 1999 and 2002.

Accounting issues
The preparatory work on the accounting
framework to be used for the ESCB was
largely completed in 1997. This framework
will form the basis for the internal and
external reporting of the ESCB and serve
to ensure that liquidity management and
statistical requirements are met. The
transition to Stage Three was also examined
and the necessary principles and techniques
were developed. In addition, work is
continuing on the method for allocating
monetary income in order to prepare the
decisions to be taken by the Governing
Council of the ECB.

Information and communications systems
In the field of information and
communications systems, the teleconference
replacement project was successfully
implemented. It enables several audio
conferences to take place in parallel
between the connected institutions.
Furthermore, its underlying physical
infrastructure will serve as the main network
platform for the data transfers needed for
the majority of ESCB-wide information
systems applications. An ESCB-wide
communications infrastructure providing
secure end-to-end file transfer and robust
messaging services was developed and
became operational in May 1998. In 1997
significant progress was made in the
development of several ESCB-wide software
applications which will support the conduct
of monetary policy operations, foreign
exchange market interventions and the
management of the ECB’s foreign reserve
assets. All these applications will be
implemented by mid-1998. The second half
of 1998 will be devoted to undertaking the
testing of all the systems and procedures
between the ECB and the NCBs. The EMI
Council approved a framework for a security
policy for the information systems of the
ESCB, aiming at guaranteeing an adequate
and co-ordinated level of security.

macro-prudential nature with a bearing on
the stability of financial institutions and
markets. Second, the ESCB will provide
supervisory authorities with information
stemming from its basic activity which could
be useful for the supervisory function.
Conversely, banking supervisors will be
ready to give supervisory information to
the ESCB which could be valuable for the
ESCB to perform its tasks as laid down in
the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
Moreover, Article 25 (1) of the ESCB/ECB
Statute contemplates a specific and optional
advisory task of the ECB on the scope
and implementation of the Community
legislation on banking supervision and the
stability of the financial system. In addition,
Article 105 (4) of the Treaty, which provides
for a mandatory advisory task of the ECB
on draft Community and national legislation
falling within the ECB’s field of competence,
is likely to apply to, inter alia, certain
legislation on banking supervision and the
stability of the financial system. Finally,
Article 105 (6) of the Treaty envisages the
possibility of conferring upon the ECB
specific tasks concerning policies relating to
prudential supervision. In this respect, it is
felt premature at this stage to envisage any
transfer of supervisory competencies from
national authorities to the ECB.

Legal issues
Banking supervision and financial stability
The EMI has examined how in Stage Three
of EMU the ESCB can contribute to the
smooth conduct of the policies pursued by
the competent authorities in the fields of
banking supervision and the stability of the
financial system, under Article 105 (5) of
the Treaty. Two main forms of contribution
of the ESCB can be envisaged. First, the
ESCB and, in particular, the ECB will
promote co-operation among the
supervisory authorities and between them
and the ESCB on relevant prudential
supervisory issues, such as those of a

In the legal area, the EMI further elaborated
its views on the adaptation of national
legislation under Article 108 of the Treaty
with a view to Treaty and ESCB/ECB
Statute requirements for Stage Three in a
report which was published in October
1997. In doing so, it gave guidance to
national legislators in this adaptation process
and at the same time laid the basis for its
1998 Convergence Report in which, inter
alia, the compatibility of national legislation,
including the statutes of the NCBs, with the
Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute was
assessed.

9

Changeover to the euro
During 1997 preparatory work for the
changeover to the single currency gathered
considerable speed. The EMI continued to
keep track of developments as regards the
changeover, in order to assess whether
differing changeover preparations across
Member States, owing to differences in the
local organisational and infrastructural
environments, might have implications for
the single monetary policy to be conducted
as from January 1999 onwards.
In the financial area, the EMI and the NCBs
have encouraged market operators to
consider market-driven standardisation
within Monetary Union. The EMI also
provided assistance in the establishment of
common market standards in the euro
area-wide money markets and foreign
exchange markets. It furthermore
recognised the need for a distinctive codified
symbol for the single currency and expressed
its support for the symbol E , proposed by
the European Commission, as the logo for
the euro. With a view to assisting all those
involved in preparing for the changeover,
the EMI has improved the distribution of

relevant information, inter alia through its
Web site.

Public information
Since its establishment on 1 January 1994 the
EMI has fulfilled its reporting obligations in
accordance with Articles 7 and 11.3 of the
EMI Statute by publishing reports on the
state of the preparations for Stage Three of
EMU, its activities and monetary and financial
conditions in the Community. A list of EMI
documents published since the beginning of
1997 and the EMI’s Web site address are
provided at the end of this Report. The EMI
recognises that there is a need for the ESCB
to ensure the transparency of its objectives
and policies in Stage Three and to foster
knowledge of its operations and tasks, thus
enabling the financial community and the
general public to both understand and support
its policies. To this end, the EMI is developing
an external communication policy - to be
presented for consideration by the Governing
Council of the ECB - on the most effective
ways in which to disseminate information
concerning the activities of the ESCB.

3 Other tasks of the EMI
Oversight of the ECU Clearing and Settlement
System
The EMI’s main focus has been to ensure
that adequate action is taken to improve
the system’s compliance with the safety
standards laid down in the 1990 G-10
Report on Interbank Netting Schemes.
The EMI monitored in particular the
preparatory work conducted by the EBA on
its Euro Clearing and Settlement System for
Stage Three of EMU (EURO 1). In addition,
the EBA - in co-operation with the EMI - is
finalising the settlement arrangements in

10

accordance with an EMI Council decision to
allow the EBA to open a central settlement
account at the ECB. It may also open other
settlement accounts with those NCBs which
agree to provide such accounts. Only the
Banque de France has indicated its intention
to open a local settlement account for the
EBA (by June 1999).

Electronic money
In 1997 the EMI carried out a further study
of the impact on EU economies of the
emergence of electronic money. It took

particular account of new market
developments and conducted a thorough
analysis of their implications for monetary
policy. The results of the study provided
the basis for the “Opinion of the EMI
Council on the issuance of electronic
money” of 2 March 1998, the text of which
is reproduced in Box 3 of this Report.

Co-operation in the field of banking supervision
and financial stability
The EMI held consultations on a number of
issues falling within the competence of
national central banks and affecting the
stability of financial institutions and markets.
First, a survey was conducted on a wide
range of issues of potential relevance to the
stability of the EU banking systems by
focusing on the current trends and possible
developments which are likely to occur in
these systems in the medium and long
term, both in general and with regard to
the establishment of EMU. Second, an
investigation was carried out on the possible
use of macroeconomic data in the
supervisory process and the links between
macroeconomic developments and fragility
in banking systems as a whole and at the
level of individual institutions. Third, the
most recent developments in industry
practice for bad and doubtful loans - with
particular focus on the new approaches
based on statistical methods - were
examined with a view to assessing the main
prudential supervisory implications. Fourth,
a first examination was undertaken of the
possible impact of the establishment of
EMU on the current EU prudential
supervisory regime for credit institutions’
liquidity. Finally, co-operation among the
EU credit registers continued with a view
to pursuing the objective of the opening-up
of the respective registers on a crossborder basis.

Administration of EMS mechanisms and
Community loans
Greece joined the ERM with effect from
16 March 1998, which entailed compulsory
participation in the ECU swap mechanism
from that date. Since the Bank of Greece
had been participating in the mechanism on
a voluntary basis since January 1986, ERM
membership had no implications for the
EMI’s ECU swap operations.
In 1997 the EMI continued to receive from
borrowers, namely Greece and Italy, and
to pay to creditors vis-à-vis the Community
the sums due in respect of interest,
commission and expenses on outstanding
loans.

Advisory functions
In the framework of its advisory functions,
during 1997 and the first quarter of 1998
the EMI delivered opinions in fifty-two
consultation procedures under Article 109f (6)
and Article 5.3 of its Statute, in many cases
on adaptations of statutes of NCBs under
Article 108 of the Treaty.

Monitoring of compliance with the prohibition
on monetary financing and on privileged access
In 1997 the EMI continued to monitor
NCBs’ fulfilment of their obligations under
Articles 104 and 104a of the Treaty and
related Council Regulations and concluded
that the Treaty requirements continue to
be respected by the EU NCBs. Remaining
imperfections which had appeared in the
transition to the new arrangements, as well
as technical problems which had occurred
in the implementation of new regulations,
were finally corrected at the beginning of
1997.

11

Co-operation with other institutions
The EMI has continued its close cooperation with other bodies of the European
Union in a number of forms and at various
levels. With regard to contacts with
institutions outside the Community, the
“concertation procedure” has remained a
valuable forum for exchanging data among
foreign exchange experts. Important links

12

have been retained with the Bank for
International Settlements, the OECD and
the central banks of the associated Central
and Eastern European countries. The
International Monetary Fund visited the
EMI several times during the year and the
future relationship between the ESCB and
the IMF was one of the main topics on
which an exchange of views took place.

Chapter I

Economic, monetary and
financial conditions in the
European Union

1 Economic and financial background in 1997
1.1 Major developments outside
the EU
External environment remained robust
Global economic conditions continued to be
broadly favourable in 1997, with the notable
exception of developments in Asia during the
latter half of the year. The volume of world
trade in goods and services increased sharply,
at an estimated rate of 9.4% in 1997, compared
with 6.6% in 1996. World output growth in
1997 amounted to 4.1% and output in the
OECD countries is estimated to have risen by
3.0%. Among the industrialised countries, the
most noteworthy features were the relative
weakness of the Japanese economy and the
continued strength of demand in the United
States. In parallel to several years of sustained
growth in a number of OECD countries,
inflation continued to be remarkably low and
stable, with CPI inflation for the group
(excluding the so-called high inflation
countries2) falling to 2% on average, the
lowest figure for over three decades. This
benign outcome for inflation was underpinned
by a decline in oil prices during the course of
the year and broadly stable non-oil commodity
prices.
The United States continued to enjoy robust
output and employment growth. Output
growth accelerated to 3.8% (see Chart 1),
prompting a further decline in the
unemployment rate to a trough of 4.6% in
November 1997, its lowest level since 1973.
At the same time, inflationary pressures
remained moderate, with CPI inflation declining
over the course of the year to reach an
average of 2.3%. Rising productivity and falling
import prices, owing to, inter alia, the strength
of the US dollar, were the main underlying
factors, together with a modest tightening of
monetary policy in the spring by the Federal
Reserve. The federal fiscal deficit was almost
eliminated in 1997, partly due to a growthinduced surge in tax revenues.

16

Whereas growth in Japan appeared to gain
momentum during 1996, it stalled during
1997. Output fell sharply in the second
quarter, reflecting a decline in private
spending as the fiscal stance was tightened.
Consumer confidence later deteriorated
further owing to the financial turmoil in
other Asian countries (see Box 1) and the
bankruptcies of certain Japanese financial
institutions. As a consequence of weak
growth, the rate of unemployment rose to
3.4%. The only stimulus to output growth
was provided by the external sector,
reflecting the Japanese yen’s depreciation
against the dollar and buoyant foreign
demand. The Bank of Japan’s
accommodating monetary policy stance
was maintained, with the official discount
rate remaining at a record low level of
0.5% against the background of growth
slowing to around 0.9%, while average CPI
inflation remained relatively subdued
throughout the year, rising to 1.7%.
Financial turbulence emerged in Thailand in
mid-1997; it quickly spread to a number of
other countries in South-East Asia, eventually
also reaching the Republic of Korea. Economic
growth in eastern and southern Asia slowed
as the financial turmoil in the region increased
uncertainty (see Box 1). In China, however, a
high rate of output growth was sustained,
while inflation remained subdued; meanwhile,
activity weakened moderately in both Australia
and New Zealand.
The transition economies as a group
experienced positive output growth in 1997
for the first time since the beginning of the
1990s, albeit of less than 2% on average.
The Baltic States, Poland and Hungary all
experienced strong growth rates, while
2

Defined as those countries which have recorded
an average rate of inflation of 10% or more thus
far in the 1990s (source: OECD Economic
Outlook, December 1997).

Russia’s output appears to have grown
modestly. In the Czech Republic growth
slowed sharply and the currency was
devalued as a result of foreign exchange
market pressures. The pace of economic
growth in the developing countries was
maintained at slightly below 6% in 1997,
albeit with below-average growth in Africa
of around 3%. Economic growth in Central
and South America, however, picked up
considerably. Inflation in the developing
countries as a whole slowed to 8.5%, and in
the transition economies it fell below 30%.

Shifts in global foreign exchange markets
1997 was characterised by a strong
appreciation of the US dollar against
both the Deutsche Mark (by 15.2% to
DEM 1.79) and the Japanese yen (by 11.8% to
JPY 130). The year was also marked by a
substantial depreciation of certain Asian
currencies (see Box 1).
Against the Deutsche Mark, the dollar
appreciated from DEM 1.55 to DEM 1.79 in
the course of the year. This pattern reflected
favourable prospects for the US economy
compared with Germany and expectations
of the maintenance or widening of interest
rate differentials, for instance when the
US Federal Reserve tightened monetary
policy in late March 1997. The overall
upward trend was temporarily interrupted
between mid-August and early November
as expectations of a further tightening by
the Federal Reserve faded, while incipient
price pressures in Germany prompted
markets to expect a monetary tightening
(which indeed took place on 9 October).
Thereafter, expectations of further tightening
in Germany diminished, enabling the dollar
to recommence its ascent. During 1997 the
dollar also appreciated markedly against
the Japanese yen, from JPY 116 to JPY 130.
Overall, the evolution of the dollar-yen
rate reflected a pessimistic economic
outlook in Japan and, later in the year, the
negative repercussions on Japanese

competitiveness and financial stability of the
turmoil in South-East Asia and the Republic
of Korea as well as safe-haven flows into
US dollars in connection with the Asian
crisis (see Box 1). Reflecting a short-lived
improvement in sentiment regarding
economic recovery in Japan, the
depreciation of the Japanese yen was
temporarily interrupted in mid-year, when
the yen appreciated sharply to levels close
to those recorded at the beginning of the
year.
In respect of changes in nominal effective
exchange rates, the nominal effective
exchange rate of the dollar against twentysix trading partners appreciated by 13% in
1997, while those of the Deutsche Mark
and the yen depreciated by 2.6% and 1.9%
respectively. In the case of the United
States, the large change in the nominal
effective exchange rate reflected the
strengthening of the dollar against both the
yen and the Deutsche Mark and also the
depreciations of currencies in South-East
Asia and the Republic of Korea. The
relatively small effective depreciation of the
yen reflected an offsetting movement against
the South-East Asian currencies and the
Korean won. In the case of Germany, the
depreciation of the Deutsche Mark against
the dollar contrasted with broadly stable
exchange rates vis-à-vis the European
currencies, which carry a far greater
aggregate weight than the non-European
currencies in the overall effective exchange
rate index.

International bond yields declined
In 1997 US bond yields fell by 68 basis
points from 6.43 to 5.75%, a development
which masks two distinct phases during the
year. By mid-April yields had risen by
almost 60 basis points to reach a peak of
6.98% against the background of a further
tightening of labour market conditions and
accelerating growth. The associated
expectations of an increase in inflation

became evident that inflationary pressures
had remained subdued despite buoyant
real economy developments. The virtual
elimination of the public sector deficit in the
United States and the decline in the debt
ratio in 1997 further supported the decline
in long-term interest rates. Towards the
end of the year, the fall in yields accelerated
as the Asian financial crisis motivated safehaven flows out of the region and into
relatively less risky assets such as US bonds.
By this time, the crisis was also leading to
expectations that official interest rates in

the United States would not be raised,
owing to the disinflationary impact of the
turmoil as well as possible concerns regarding
global financial stability.
Long-term interest rates in Japan declined
by 91 basis points during the year to reach
1.66%, an unprecedentedly low level by
both domestic and international historical
standards, while real long-term interest
rates measured ex post became significantly
negative towards the end of the year and
the slope of the yield curve became less
steep. This overall development reflected
expectations that official interest rates would
remain low despite an uptick in inflation;
the latter was regarded as temporary given
the concomitant deceleration in the pace
of economic activity. The Asian financial
crisis also led to safe-haven flows out of the
Japanese equity market and into bonds.

Box 1

Evolution of the Asian crisis in 1997
1997 witnessed unprecedented currency and financial market turmoil in a number of Asian countries.
Those most severely affected were Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Republic of Korea, although
others were not immune. One factor common to most of the affected countries prior to the crisis was a
loss of competitiveness arising from the peg to the US dollar and reflected in the persistence of current
account deficits (although other signs of macroeconomic disequilibrium were absent). Other common
features were fragile, poorly regulated and over-exposed financial systems and high levels of shortterm foreign currency denominated borrowing by the private sector, which was frequently used to
finance long-term investment, thus creating a significant maturity mismatch as well as a currency mismatch.
Severe pressures on the Thai baht led to the floating of the currency in July 1997, ending a 13-year
peg to a dollar-dominated basket. As a result of the loss of competitiveness, pressures emerged on
the currencies of other countries in the region, which led to major depreciations of the Philippine
peso, the Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian rupiah in the same month. The crisis deepened in
October, as a stock market crash in Hong Kong led to widespread turbulence in capital markets. Even
though the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the US dollar was maintained, the substantial fall in equity
prices led to further pressures on Asian currencies, including the Korean won, which had until then
been relatively unscathed. The marked subsequent depreciation of the Korean won against the US
dollar in November (and December) led to a further weakening of the currencies of the region.
Looking at developments in the second half of 1997 as a whole (see table), a number of common
characteristics were discernible. First, with the exception of the Hong Kong dollar, currencies depreciated
by significant margins vis-à-vis the US dollar. The large depreciations took on an almost self-perpetuating
character as increasing debt-service costs for the private sector and decisions to hedge external liabilities
only intensified exchange rate pressures. Second, short-term interest rates were raised by substantial
amounts in an effort to maintain currency pegs, and although interest rates subsequently declined at the

19

end of 1997, they remained above early July levels, reflecting expectations of further substantial exchange
rate depreciations. An increase in uncertainty was also evident from the significant increase in implied
volatility in over-the-counter option prices on these currencies. Third, stock market indices collapsed
by substantial amounts ranging from 10% to almost 50%. Besides reflecting monetary conditions, lower
expectations of future earnings and notably adverse financial conditions for firms, this development
was linked to the higher returns required by international investors in the face of heightened risk. The
fall in currencies and stock indices implied a general downgrading of the affected region by international
investors, with contagion and spillover effects operating in addition to changes in fundamentals.
In late 1997 the IMF offered substantial loan facilities to Thailand, Indonesia and the Republic of
Korea. The associated reform programmes require a tightening of monetary and fiscal policies and
the restructuring and strengthening of financial systems. These measures are aimed at restoring confidence
in the region by avoiding excessive currency depreciations, containing inflation and creating conditions
for the build-up of international reserves.
A number of channels may be discerned via which macroeconomic effects on these Asian economies
may be transmitted. These include: an income or wealth effect, operating through a contraction of
domestic demand in Asia as a result of falling share prices and exchange rates and a tighter monetary
and fiscal policy (but also influenced by effects resulting from a higher debt-service burden in US
dollars, the cutting of credit lines, capital outflows and higher interest rates); a confidence effect, whereby
a decline in the stock market and/or exchange rate can also prompt a more generally pessimistic view
of future prospects and thereby trigger still further reductions in demand; a long-term interest rate
effect linked to investors’ reassessment of risk in emerging markets and the prospects for higher inflation
following currency depreciation; and a price effect, which entails an increase in Asian competitiveness
tending to boost net exports, thus mitigating the contractionary effects of lower domestic demand.
The magnitude of the direct impact or effect on countries outside the region will depend on the share
of their trade with the Asian economies concerned and on the importance of trade in relation to
overall output (openness). Incomes, prof its and demand will be reduced through a deterioration in
the external balance as exports to the region fall. There may also be adverse wealth and confidence
effects and an effect operating through the balance sheets of the banking system, depending on
individual institutions’ exposure to the region. However, long-term interest rates may benefit from
lower inflation expectations. The final effect on the economies outside Asia, which may take some
time to be felt, will depend not only on the direct effect via trade and financial markets, but also on
the appropriateness and timeliness of any policy response which may be required and, not least, on
the flexibility of the real side of the economy, especially the labour market. The implications of the
crisis for monetary and economic developments in the EU are discussed further in Section 3.

1.2 Macroeconomic developments in
the EU
Real GDP growth in the EU accelerated
Initially, real GDP growth in the EU in 1997
followed the pattern of subdued
developments also observed in early 1996
as unusually severe weather conditions
again tended to depress construction in the
first quarter. However, the pace of
economic activity quickened thereafter and,
from the second quarter onwards, the
growth rate was significantly higher than in
the comparable period of 1996. The crisis
in Asia did not have a significant adverse
impact on growth in 1997. Average real
GDP growth for the EU in 1997 is estimated
to have been 2.7%, which is significantly
higher than the rate of 1.7% recorded in
1996. The acceleration in activity was

widespread, with stronger growth being
recorded in almost all EU countries (see
Table 1), although there continued to be
differences in the strength of economic
activity. In Italy and Sweden output growth,
although higher than in 1996, remained
below 2%, while in Belgium, Germany,
France and Austria the rate was between
2% and 3%. Real GDP growth in the
remaining nine EU Member States was
above 3%. Growth in Ireland was again the
strongest in the Union in 1997 at 10.3%. In
Finland real GDP growth also accelerated
sharply to reach almost 6%.
The acceleration in activity during 1997 was
to a large extent underpinned by a
continuation of the favourable factors which
had also characterised 1996: economic
expansion in North America remained robust
(see also Section 1.1) and the price

competitiveness of most EU countries
improved against that of their major non-EU
trading partners. Within the EU, low or
declining inflation enabled most Member States
to pursue policies characterised by relatively
low short-term nominal interest rates (see
Section 2), intra-EU exchange rates remained
generally stable and bond yields declined still
further. Consumer confidence improved to
around its long-term average, though the
level and scale of improvements varied
significantly across countries. Industrial
confidence also improved sharply and by the
end of the year was well above its long-term
average.

Stronger domestic demand, net exports
remained positive
For the Union as a whole, the improved real
growth performance in 1997 was principally
due to domestic demand, which rose by
2.2%, compared with 1.5% in the previous
year. For the fourth successive year, net trade
in goods and services provided a positive,
albeit small, stimulus to growth, underpinned
by subdued growth in relative unit labour
costs and, as a result, improvements in
competitiveness. The rise in domestic demand
was linked to an improvement in investment
growth and an increase in stockbuilding, while
growth in private consumption was
unchanged and government consumption
was weaker than in 1996 (see Table 2).
Whereas domestic demand rose by 3% or
more in many countries (Denmark, Greece,
Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Finland and the United Kingdom), in
Germany, France, Austria and Sweden growth
in domestic demand was below 1.5%.
Private consumption growth in the EU has
been broadly constant since the 1992-93
recession and has remained in the range of
1½-2%. On the one hand, low growth of real
household disposable income combined with
the negative effects on confidence of high
unemployment in some countries and
uncertainty about the pattern of further fiscal

22

consolidation have tended to restrain
consumer spending. On the other, consumer
confidence has improved as economic
prospects have brightened and wealth gains
from equity and, in some cases, property
prices have accrued. The balance between
these factors varied sharply, as is illustrated by
the fact that in 1997 private consumption
grew at 3% or more in Denmark, Spain,
Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Finland
and the United Kingdom, while in Germany,
France and Austria it grew by less than 1%. In
the United Kingdom private consumption
grew by 4.5% in 1997, the highest rate since
1988, partly spurred on by temporary factors
(notably windfall gains arising from the
demutualisation of mortgage lending
institutions).
Reflecting the continued efforts of fiscal
authorities to restrain spending in the light of
the need for consolidation, government
consumption in the EU increased by 0.5% in
1997, thus resulting in a decline in the ratio to
GDP. In Germany, Greece, Italy, Finland and
Sweden government consumption fell, while
in Spain and the United Kingdom it rose only
marginally. By contrast, general government
consumption rose by 2.9% in Denmark, by
3.9% in Luxembourg, by 3.3% in the
Netherlands and by 3.0% in Portugal.
Continuing the pattern observed since the
early 1990s, fixed investment growth in 1997
- although stronger than in the previous year continued to be below the levels typical of
past decades, despite satisfactory profit margins
and a high level of industrial confidence, as
well as relatively high capacity utilisation rates
for the manufacturing sector. At the individual
country level, investment growth in 1997
stood at over 10% in Greece, Ireland,
Luxembourg, Portugal and Finland, but was
also strong in Denmark and the Netherlands.
By contrast, investment rose by around 1%
or less in Germany, France and Italy and fell
by 4.8% in Sweden.
Both exports and imports grew considerably
more strongly than in 1996, partly reflecting

the resurgence of growth within the EU
(which increased intra-EU trade) and buoyant
economic conditions globally. Exports from
EU countries grew by 9.5% on average, while
imports grew by 8.5%. European Commission
figures show that trade and current account
balances for the EU improved further in 1997
(see Table 3); the trade balance rose to 1.5%
of EU GDP and the current account surplus
increased to 1.2% of EU GDP. Current
account balances (based on national data)
improved strongly in France and the
Netherlands as well as, although to a lesser
extent, in Belgium, Germany, Spain, Finland
and the United Kingdom. By contrast, Denmark
experienced a marked deterioration. Overall,

eleven Member States recorded current
account surpluses. In general, these surpluses
were linked to high and relatively stable net
private saving (private saving less investment),
while public sector positions tended to
improve sharply, reflecting ongoing fiscal
consolidation.

Employment generation remained weak, high
unemployment persisted
Against the background of strengthening
economic growth in the EU as a whole,
employment has increased only marginally,
while unemployment has remained

stubbornly high. Total employment in the
EU, at around 147 million, has not increased
significantly since the 1992-93 recession,
despite EU-average real GDP growth over
this period of 2.4%. For example, total
employment is estimated to have risen by
only around 0.5% in 1997, compared with
increases of around 1% in Japan and over
2% in the United States. Moreover, the
labour force participation rate, at around
67%, is lower than in either Japan or the
United States. Unemployment in the EU,
measured on a comparable basis, remained
more than twice that in the United States
and three times higher than in Japan. Of
particular concern are the much higher
levels of youth and long-term
unemployment. The concentration of
unemployment in these categories, as well
as the persistence of subdued employment
creation, point to the structural nature of a

24

major part of EU unemployment and to the
continued need for structural measures.
The unemployment rate for the EU as a
whole (measured on the basis of
EUROSTAT data) fell slightly during the
course of 1997, from 10.8% in the fourth
quarter of 1996 to 10.5% in the fourth
quarter of 1997 (see Chart 2).
Unemployment fell in most EU Member
States, largely but not entirely in line with
patterns of relative growth, with marked
reductions being observed in Denmark,
Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Finland and
the United Kingdom. In Ireland the
unemployment rate fell below the EU
average for the first time in recent decades.
In the Netherlands unemployment had
fallen to 5% by the end of the year.
Unemployment also fell, albeit to a lesser
degree, in Belgium and Portugal. In contrast,

there was a further increase in the rate of
unemployment in Germany, largely reflecting
developments in eastern Germany, where
unemployment had risen to almost 20% by
the end of the year. Ongoing weakness in
construction activity and a contraction in
employment promotion and vocational
training schemes mainly underlie this
development in eastern Germany. Overall,
considerable differences continued to exist
between the unemployment rates across
the Union. In the fourth quarter of 1997
the rate remained at or above 10% in five
countries: Germany, Spain, France, Italy and
Finland. Despite the marked declines
recorded in Spain and Finland, the
unemployment rates in these two countries
remained the highest in the EU.
The unemployment data from EUROSTAT
to which reference is made in the paragraph
above are calculated according to ILO
recommendations. These data are more
comparable than national data, but are not
yet fully harmonised. In some cases, they
differ markedly from the corresponding
national definitions (see Table 4). In
particular, on an annual basis the EUROSTAT
estimates for 1997 are higher for Greece,
Sweden and the United Kingdom and lower
for Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands,
Austria and Finland.

1.3 Achievements in macroeconomic
convergence
In accordance with Article 109j (1) of the
Treaty, at the end of March 1998 the EMI
presented its report to the EU Council on
the progress made in the fulfilment by the
Member States of their obligations regarding
the achievement of Economic and Monetary
Union. This Convergence Report included
an examination of the achievement of a
high degree of sustainable convergence by
reference to the fulfilment by each Member
State of the convergence criteria, as set out
in the Treaty. It therefore covered the
performance of individual EU countries in
terms of the degree of price stability,
government debt and deficit positions, longterm interest rates and exchange rates. In
early May 1998 the EU Council, meeting in
the composition of Heads of State or
Government, confirmed which Member
States had fulfilled the necessary conditions
for the adoption of the single currency. The
outcome of this meeting is reported in
Box 2. A summary of the examination of
convergence by the EMI, which included
developments in 1997, is provided in an
annex, which contains selected parts of the
Introduction and Summary of the
Convergence Report. Data relating to the
Maastricht Treaty convergence criteria
(excluding the exchange rate criterion) are
shown in Table 5.

2 Monetary policies in Member States
This section describes the changes in
monetary conditions in individual EU
countries in 1997 and their monetary policy
objectives for 1998. It reflects the task of
the EMI in Stage Two of EMU, which is to
strengthen co-operation between the
national central banks and the co-ordination
of the monetary policies of Member States
with a view to ensuring price stability. In
connection with these responsibilities, the
appropriateness and compatibility of current
monetary and foreign exchange policies
were reviewed in regular discussions held
at the EMI. In the context of this review,
account is taken of the conduct of policies
within the exchange rate mechanism (ERM),
of which all EU countries other than
Greece,3 Sweden and the United Kingdom
were members in 1997.

2.1 Further convergence of interest
rates
The economic and financial environment in
1997 allowed for a continuation of the
convergence of short and long-term interest
rates and broadly stable exchange rates.
The majority of EU countries (namely
Belgium/Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland
and Sweden) broadly maintained low interest
rates. This mirrored a situation of price
stability against a background of narrowing
- but generally still negative - output gaps,
benign wage behaviour and the
consolidation efforts of fiscal authorities.
Official and key interest rates remained at
low and closely aligned levels, although
they were raised to a small extent in the
autumn in response to inflation risks (see
Chart 3 and the annex relating to the
chronology of monetary measures). The
concerted nature of these policy actions
strengthened the cohesion among those
countries with closely aligned interest rates.

28

Several other Member States (Spain, Italy,
Portugal and initially also Greece) were
able to continue the process of reducing
interest rates in line with the degree of
convergence of their overall economic
fundamentals, particularly in respect of the
achievement of price stability, with those of
the countries referred to in the paragraph
above. Short and long-term interest rates in
these countries thus tended to follow a
downward trend, progressively converging
towards the lower level of the closely
aligned countries (see Chart 4). Monetary
policy in the two remaining EU countries
(namely Ireland and the United Kingdom)
was tightened, albeit to differing degrees, in
response both to buoyant economic and
monetary growth and to heightened inflation
risks against a background of continued
sound fundamentals. The widening of shortterm interest rate differentials against
Germany was accompanied by a further
strong appreciation of the respective
currencies vis-à-vis the Deutsche Mark.
Later in the year, however, short-term
interest rates in Ireland began to decline
relative to Germany and the Irish pound
moved closer to its central rates in the ERM
grid.4
The convergence process was supported
by the strong political commitment to EMU
demonstrated at the regular meetings
of the European Council and the
corresponding reduction in market
3

Effective from 16 March 1998, the Greek drachma
joined the exchange rate mechanism of the
EMS at a central rate of GRD 357 to the ECU,
which implied a depreciation of 14%. The Greek
authorities thereby committed themselves to an
economic and monetary policy which will be firmly
geared to keeping inflation under control and on a
downward trend.
Effective from 16 March 1998, the bilateral
central rates of the Irish pound against other ERM
currencies were revalued by 3%, bringing them
close to market rates.

uncertainty. Of particular importance was
the understanding, reached at the informal
ECOFIN Council meeting in Mondorf-lesBains in September 1997, that the bilateral
exchange rates which will be used at the
start of Stage Three in determining the
irrevocable conversion rates for the euro
would be pre-announced immediately after
the selection of the countries which will
adopt the single currency (see Box 2).
Given the calm conditions on foreign
exchange markets in Europe, an increasing
number of market participants came to
expect that the pre-announced bilateral
exchange rates would be equal or very
close to the bilateral central rates of the
ERM. As a result, the market-led process of
the convergence of exchange rates towards
their ERM central rates and, as a corollary,
the convergence of short-term interest
rates gained further momentum.

2.2 Monetary policies in individual
Member States
The Deutsche Bundesbank continued to
maintain a low interest rate environment in
1997, reflecting the gradual return of broad
money (M3) growth to a more satisfactory
level and the subdued outlook for inflation
in Germany. Over the summer, however,
the appreciation of the US dollar and
increases in administered prices caused an
upturn in import, producer and consumer
price inflation. With the aim of ensuring a
further deceleration of the rate of monetary
expansion and to counter the risks to price
stability at an early stage, the Bundesbank
decided on 9 October 1997 to adopt a
somewhat less accommodating monetary
stance. The securities repurchase rate which had remained at 3.0% since August
1996 - was raised to 3.3%, while both the
official discount rate and the lombard rate
were kept unchanged at 2.5% and 4.5%,
respectively (see Chart 3).
At the end of 1996 the Bundesbank extended
the time horizon of its monetary target in

terms of M3 from one year to two years in
order to take account of possible uncertainties
in financial markets in the period of transition
to Stage Three. An annual rate of M3 growth
of approximately 5% was targeted for both
1997 and 1998. As an additional point of
reference for the shorter term, the target
range for M3 growth in the fourth quarter of
1997 was set at 3.5-6.5%. In December 1997
the Bundesbank confirmed its two-year
monetary target of around 5% per annum,
but lowered the target corridor for 1998 to
3-6%. At the same time it acknowledged
that in the second half of 1998 its monetary
targeting strategy would have to take
greater account of aspects covering the
whole group of countries selected to
participate in the euro area (see also
Section 3).
Whereas in 1996 the outturn of 8.1% for
M3 growth in the last quarter exceeded
the 4-7% target range, the pace of monetary
expansion steadily decelerated in the course
of 1997 so that, in the fourth quarter, M3
growth was 4.7%, i.e. just below the centre
of the 3.5-6.5% target corridor (see
Table 6 (a)). The deceleration of money
growth was the result of a weakening in
lending to both the private and the public
sectors and a high net outflow of funds arising
from transactions between domestic nonbanks and non-residents. In 1997 domestic
non-banks further reduced their cross-border
deposits and ran down their portfolios of
money market certificates. Reflecting this, the
M3 aggregate extended by cross-border
deposits, short-term bank bonds and
investments in money market funds grew
more slowly than M3 in 1997 (at a rate of
4.4% in the fourth quarter of 1997, compared
with a rate of 4.7% for M3).
On 9 October 1997 official and/or key
interest rates were also raised by 0.2-0.3
percentage point in parallel in Belgium/
Luxembourg, Denmark, France, the
Netherlands and Austria, whereby some
central banks allowed for a small differential
with equivalent German policy interest rates

(see Chart 3). Suomen Pankki had already
raised its tender rate by 0.25 percentage
point in mid-September and Sveriges
Riksbank increased its repo rate by the
same magnitude in mid-December. The
correspondence in the size, timing and
direction of the monetary policy measures
in these Member States reflected the close
alignment of their short-term interest rates
in an environment of stable exchange rates,
similar medium-term inflation prospects and
low long-term bond yields.

The Banque de France closed the small
remaining gap with the German repurchase
rate by raising its intervention rate by 0.2
percentage point to 3.3% in October. This
measure aimed at preserving a high level of
confidence in the French franc, which in
the course of the year appreciated to its
central rates against most other ERM
currencies. From a domestic perspective,
the slightly less accommodating stance also
aimed at sustaining a non-inflationary
recovery in the face of more dynamic

money and credit developments than in
1996. Over the medium term the Banque
de France has been seeking an expansion
of the money supply by 5%; in December
1997 the monetary aggregates M1 and M2
recorded annual growth rates of 6.6% and
7.8%, respectively, compared with 0.8%
and 3.6% in 1996. Whereas the contraction
of M3 observed in 1996 continued in the
first months of 1997, M3 began to recover
from the spring onwards, underpinned by
the pick-up in economic growth and an
upturn in the demand for narrow money
(see Table 6 (a)). The growth rate of gross
total domestic debt, which is monitored as
a prominent indicator of financing conditions,
was 3.5% in December 1997, i.e. slightly
higher than a year earlier.
The Belgian/Luxembourg franc again showed
a high degree of stability vis-à-vis the Deutsche
Mark, while Belgian short-term interest rates
were maintained at slightly higher levels than
those in Germany (see Chart 4). In Denmark
inflationary pressures intensified during the
year. As these were partly countered by fiscal
tightening, the Danish krone nonetheless
strengthened its position within the ERM and
the positive three-month interest rate spread
against the Deutsche Mark narrowed
somewhat. During the year the Dutch guilder
moved down to its central rate against the
Deutsche Mark. De Nederlandsche Bank
reacted by allowing short-term interest rates
to rise from just below German levels to
around par, which was seen as a welcome
movement in view of the buoyancy of the
Dutch economy. The exchange rate of the
Austrian schilling remained very close to its
central parity against the Deutsche Mark.
Three-month interest rates in Austria were
close to those in Germany, although in
October the Oesterreichische Nationalbank
set the repurchase rate at 3.2%, i.e. slightly
below its German equivalent, in response to
lower perceived domestic inflationary risks.
Although the average rate of underlying
consumer price inflation in Finland stayed
well below 2% in 1997, an upward trend

32

was discernible in the course of the year,
with inflationary pressures arising on account
of continued strong growth performance
and the strengthening of consumers’
inflation expectations. Higher financial asset
prices and housing prices were also viewed
as a potential cause for concern. With a
view to securing its objective of stabilising
underlying inflation at (around) 2% (see
Table 6 (b)), Suomen Pankki raised its
tender rate from 3.0 to 3.25% in midSeptember. During 1997 the Finnish markka
was one of the stronger currencies within
the ERM and three-month interest rates
could generally be maintained at a level
slightly below those in Germany.
Sweden was also confronted with rising
consumer price inflation during most of 1997,
albeit from a very low level. Against the
background of higher capacity utilisation and
some concerns over wage settlements,
Sveriges Riksbank took the precautionary
step in December of increasing its securities
repurchase rate from 4.1 to 4.35% in order to
adhere to the 2% inflation target (with a
margin of 1 percentage point on either side).
On balance, the Swedish short-term interest
rate spread over Germany was broadly stable
at around 1.1 percentage points.
Conditions in several other EU countries
supported a further reduction in interest
rates. The Banco de España reduced its
intervention rate in steps from 6.25% at the
start of the year to 4.75% in December.
This reflected the fact that consumer price
inflation in Spain was declining rapidly to
stabilise at an average rate of 2.0%, i.e. well
in line with both the objective for 1997 of
keeping it below 3% and the 2% target
announced for 1998 (see Table 6 (b)). The
stable position of the Spanish peseta within
the ERM, the deceleration of the growth
of broad monetary aggregates (see
Table 6 (a)) and a supportive fiscal policy
further assisted the downward trend in
short-term interest rates, which by yearend had declined to 1.2 percentage points
above those in Germany.

Consumer price inflation in Italy continued its
downward trend and stabilised at an average
rate of 1.7% for the year as a whole. This
result, which also reflected currency stability
and progress in fiscal consolidation, was well in
line with the Banca d’Italia’s intention, as
stated in May 1996, to secure a rate of
inflation of less than 3% in 1997. For 1998 the
central bank is seeking to keep inflation at 2%.
Monetary growth clearly exceeded the central
bank’s reference ceiling of 5% (see
Table 6 (a)); however, the broad monetary
aggregate M2 was affected by major portfolio
shifts in response to the low-inflation
environment. The Banca d’Italia therefore
made a cautious reduction in both the discount
rate and the fixed term advances rate by a
total of 2 percentage points to 5.5% and 7.0%
respectively. At the end of 1997 the Italian
three-month interest rate had fallen to a level
of less than 2.4 percentage points above the
equivalent rate in Germany (see Chart 4).
In Portugal the stable position of the Portuguese
escudo within the ERM was underpinned by
the rapid decline in inflation to just above 2%
and firm progress in fiscal consolidation. The
Banco de Portugal was thus able to lower its
official interest rates in several steps, steering
the repo rate down from 6.7% at the beginning
of 1997 to 5.3% by the end of the year.
Against this background, the three-month
interest rate spread over Germany narrowed
to just over 1.5 percentage points.
The Bank of Greece announced that it was
aiming to reduce inflation further to 4.5% by
the end of 1997 and to below 3% by the end
of 1998. For this purpose, a broadly stable
exchange rate of the Greek drachma against
the ECU and a rate of M3 growth within a
range of 6-9% were targeted. With an
outcome for consumer price inflation of 4.7%
in December 1997, the central bank virtually
achieved its price objective. The favourable
trend in inflation enabled a further reduction
in official interest rates to be made in the first
part of the year, as the rapid expansion of M3
could be explained by portfolio adjustments
linked to fiscal changes and the abolition of

34

remaining short-term capital controls. In the
autumn, however, the drachma was affected
by speculative pressures in the wake of the
financial crisis in Asia (see Box 1). Although
the countermeasures taken by the central
bank were successful in stabilising the currency
in 1997, three-month interest rates ended the
year some 4 percentage points higher than
before the outbreak of the turmoil.
In the remaining two countries economic
conditions in 1997 necessitated a divergent
approach. The exceptionally strong
performance of the Irish economy, as reflected
in buoyant money and credit growth, tightening
labour market conditions and rising asset
prices, continued unabated. The associated
inflation risks prompted the Central Bank of
Ireland to raise its short-term facility rate by
0.25 percentage point to 6.5% in early May.
Although the Irish pound remained the
strongest currency within the ERM, it lost
ground vis-à-vis sterling. As a result, the
effective exchange rate showed a tendency
to depreciate, which further exacerbated
inflation risks. However, Ireland did not
participate in the general round of official
interest rate increases in October. Towards
the end of the year, ahead of the selection in
May 1998 of the countries to participate in
Stage Three of EMU, short-term interest rates
in Ireland declined relative to those in Germany
and the Irish pound moved closer to its ERM
central rates.
1997 witnessed a major revision of the UK
monetary policy framework. Immediately
following the May general election, the
new Government decided, inter alia, to
grant operational independence for the
setting of interest rates to the Bank of
England while retaining responsibility for
defining the inflation target.5 Just in advance
5

In addition, the Government’s monitoring ranges
for the expansion of the monetary aggregates M0
and M4 were suspended in May 1997 and the
Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee
subsequently decided not to reinstate them for the
time being.

of the announcement of this decision, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer raised the
securities repurchase rate by 0.25
percentage point to 6.25%. The newly
established Monetary Policy Committee of
the Bank of England subsequently increased
the securities repurchase rate in four steps
to 7.25% in November in order to keep
the outlook for underlying (RPIX) inflation
in line with the Government’s objective of
2.5% (as restated in June). This significant

monetary tightening was deemed necessary
in the light of the current and prospective
strength of domestic demand, notwithstanding
the expected effects of tighter fiscal policy,
the ending of windfalls from the
demutualisation of mortgage lending institutions
and the appreciation of sterling. The
persistence of strong monetary developments
also gave cause for concern about future
inflation.

3 Economic prospects and challenges
This section describes the prospects for the
EU and the world economy, considers the
conduct of monetary policies in the period
of transition to Stage Three of EMU and
addresses the creation of the ESCB and the
ECB. Box 2 outlines the characteristics of
the future euro area, as defined by the
outcome of the meetings of the EU Council
on 2/3 May 1998, meeting in the composition
of Heads of State or Government, to
confirm which Member States fulfil the
necessary conditions for the adoption of
the single currency.

3.1 Economic outlook for 1998-99
Economic forecasts released by major
international organisations in spring 1998
suggest that growth prospects for the EU in
1998 and 1999 are favourable, as domestic
demand should strengthen further, offsetting
to some extent an expected deterioration
in the external environment due to, inter
alia, the crisis in Asia.
Real GDP growth in the EU, which has
been gaining momentum since the second
quarter of 1997, is expected to strengthen
further as domestic demand continues to
accelerate in a number of EU countries.
Consumer and business confidence
indicators are pointing in the same direction.
This partly reflects the impact of a low level
of nominal interest rates, particularly at long
maturities, prevailing in an environment of,
by and large, subdued inflationary pressures,
where external competitiveness has been
maintained or improved despite currency
depreciations in many Asian countries. This
environment, combined with increased
corporate profitability, particularly in the
export-oriented industries, is expected to
be conducive to investment growth. Private
consumption is also projected to pick up
further due to a rise in real wages and
reduced uncertainty regarding employment

36

prospects in 1998 and 1999. With a
continued need for fiscal consolidation, the
impact of government consumption and
investment on domestic demand is likely to
remain limited. Despite the projected
improvement in labour market conditions,
the rate of unemployment is expected to
decline only modestly in 1998 and 1999. A
sustained reduction in the rate of
unemployment will depend crucially on the
implementation of structural reforms to
address labour and product market rigidities.
As regards the outlook for inflation, the
continuation of stability-oriented monetary
policies combined with wage moderation,
with the latter partly reflecting the
persistence of relatively high rates of
unemployment, and still negative output
gaps in certain countries are expected to
limit inflationary pressures. In addition, the
decline in oil prices, provided that it is by
and large sustained, and the counterinflationary impact of the Asian crisis arising from a depreciation of certain Asian
currencies and the moderation of global
growth - should contribute to dampening
inflationary pressures from the outside. Risks
to the inflation outlook relate to, inter alia,
the possibility of a faster than expected
pick-up in aggregate demand in the EU and
thus to a closing of output gaps, the
development of wages, a further
appreciation of the US dollar and, in the
light of the latest OPEC agreement, a
sustained reversal of the recent decline in
oil prices.
The main uncertainty with regard to the
above outlook stems from the external
environment. World output and trade
growth are expected to be weaker in 1998
and 1999 than in 1997 owing to a sharp
decline in real GDP growth in parts of Asia,
a modest slowdown in the US growth rate
and a deterioration in the economic and
financial situation in Japan. The extent of

the weakness in the external environment
arising from the turmoil in Asia will depend
on the scope and timing of the adjustment
of macroeconomic policies in the countries
affected, and on the extent to which
financial reforms are implemented. The
possibility of further spillover effects cannot
yet be ruled out. The contractionary impact
of the Asian crisis on EU growth may be
partly offset by two factors: first, the decline
in long-term interest rates in the EU as well
as in the United States - which is linked to,
inter alia, investors’ reassessment of the risk
in emerging markets; and, second, the
marked decline in commodity prices, which
may contribute to a further rise in real
incomes.

3.2 Monetary policies in the
remainder of Stage Two
The primary objective of the monetary
policies of the eleven countries selected to
participate in the euro area in the remaining
months of Stage Two is to ensure that the
current environment of broad price stability
is maintained for the euro area as a whole,
thereby providing the ESCB with a
favourable starting position.
As outlined in Section 2, the majority of
countries selected to participate in the
euro area have already achieved shortterm interest rates which are closely aligned
at a low level. The conditions in the first
part of 1998 have allowed this common
position to be firmly consolidated and the
remaining members have been able to
maintain the downward trend in their key
interest rates. This suggests that a de facto
common monetary policy stance is tending
to emerge in the selected euro area
countries, against a background of broadly
stable prices and exchange rates. By the
end of 1998 at the latest, those countries’
short-term interest rates will have converged
to a common level which will be consistent
with the objective of maintaining price
stability in the euro area.

This overall pattern of convergence in
short-term interest rates is consistent with
a situation on the eve of Stage Three in
which market exchange rates between the
countries selected to participate in the
euro area are equal to the pre-announced
bilateral exchange rates which will be used
in determining the irrevocable conversion
rates for the euro (see Annex). These preannounced bilateral exchange rates are
consistent with economic fundamentals
and are compatible with sustainable
convergence.
The institutional background to the abovementioned development has, of course,
changed. The confirmation on 2/3 May 1998
by the Heads of State or Government of
the Member States which will adopt the
single currency heralded the start of the
final phase of the transition to Stage Three,
which includes the establishment of the
ESCB and the ECB and the liquidation of
the EMI. During the remainder of Stage
Two, the Governing Council and the
Executive Board of the ECB will finalise the
preparations needed for the conduct of the
single monetary policy in the euro area as
of 1 January 1999 (see Chapter 2). In the
meantime, the participating national central
banks will retain their national monetary
powers. The institutional changes entailed
in the establishment of the ESCB and the
ECB provide a suitable framework within
which the participating national central banks
will be able to engage in close co-operation
with a view to co-ordinating their national
monetary policies in order to achieve the
primary objective of maintaining price
stability in the euro area. Furthermore, in
accordance with Article 44 of the ESCB/
ECB Statute, the ECB is to take over the
tasks of the EMI which still need to be
performed in Stage Three of EMU, given
the existence of Member States with a
derogation. The General Council of the
ECB is to assume responsibility for relations
with the national central banks of the noneuro area Member States.

Box 2

Characteristics of the euro area
On 2/3 May 1998, on the basis of the Council recommendation and following the European Parliament’s
Opinion, the Council - meeting in the composition of Heads of State or Government - unanimously
decided that eleven Member States, namely, Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
The Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the
single currency on 1 January 1999. These countries will therefore participate in the third stage of
Economic and Monetary Union.
The table below shows a range of indicators which highlight some of the key characteristics of the
euro area. This table provides an initial comparison for the year 1997 (or the latest year for which
data are available) between the euro area, the EU-15, the United States and Japan, thereby broadly
describing the euro area’s “starting position”. However, the f igures shown are estimates collected
from various sources, and further elaborated aggregate data will become available during the course
of 1998 or later, based on newly compiled statistics. Overall, the data highlight a significant change
compared with the environment previously prevailing in individual EU countries. The introduction
of the euro will create an area which will closely resemble the United States in terms of the magnitude
of its domestic economy and its degree of openness.
In terms of population, with around 290 million inhabitants, the euro area is somewhat larger than
the United States and more than twice the size of Japan. In a global context, it is a “large domestic
economy” which has a share of world GDP of almost 20%, thereby possessing a considerable purchasing
power matched only by that of the United States. Intra euro area exports account for almost 17% of
total world exports. Excluding these intra-area exports, the euro area still accounts for approximately
20% of world exports and thus in terms of its percentage of world exports is larger than either the
United States or Japan. Patterns of production are broadly similar to those of the United States and
Japan. However, the service sector is smaller than that of the United States, but larger than that of
Japan, whose economy still features a relatively preponderant manufacturing sector. Figures for general
government current receipts and expenditures show that the euro area has a larger public sector than
either the United States or Japan, with close to 50% of GDP accounted for by government expenditures.
The ratios of exports and imports to euro area-wide GDP, both standing somewhat above 10%, suggest
that the degree of openness of the euro area is comparable to that of the United States and Japan
(after adjusting for intra-area trade). This contrasts with the typical nature of individual EU countries,
as “small or medium-sized economies” with an average ratio of exports or imports to GDP of around
25% (although there are sizable variations across the individual countries within the euro area).
Figures for the value of debt securities, stock market capitalisation and bank assets show that the
combined weight of financial markets in the euro area is substantial, although the relative weight of
individual components differs. Compared with the United States and Japan, the weight of equity and
debt securities markets is lower and the relative importance of banking is far greater.
Considering a number of recent macroeconomic variables, real GDP growth for the euro area as a
whole was 2.5% in 1997. Reflecting different positions in the cycle, GDP growth in 1997 was markedly
different from that in the United States and Japan. Inflation in the euro area, as measured by the
harmonised index, was 1.6%, similar to the outturn for Japan, but below that for the United States.
The unemployment rate was significantly above that of both the United States and Japan. Short and
long-term nominal interest rates were lower in the fourth quarter of 1997 than they were in the United
States. Average general government debt and def icit f igures for the countries comprising the euro
area show debt and deficit ratios of 75.2% and 2.5% respectively (with significant differences among
Member States); on average, they were above those in the United States but below those in Japan
(where the debt ratio is nearly 100%). Finally, the current account balance, as for the EU as a whole,
was in surplus. This surplus was lower than in Japan and compares with a deficit in the United States.

Chapter II

Preparatory work
for Stage Three

1 Monetary policy
1.1 Monetary policy strategy
In February 1997 the EMI published a
report entitled “The single monetary policy
in Stage Three - Elements of the monetary
policy strategy of the ESCB”. Having
reviewed a number of alternative strategies,
the report identified intermediate monetary
targeting and direct inflation targeting as
the basis for a potential strategy for Stage
Three. While noting that it would be
neither necessary nor useful, at that point,
to select a specific strategy, the report listed
a number of key elements which should be
viewed as an indispensable part of any
strategy: a clear definition of the final
objective of price stability and of the specific
targets against which the performance of
the ESCB could be assessed; the availability
of a broad set of indicator variables to help
assess the risks to future price stability; a
prominent role for monetary aggregates,
provided that money demand in the euro
area is sufficiently stable in the long run; and
tools enabling forecasts for inflation and
other euro area economic variables to be
produced. In addition, the report noted
that monetary policy in Stage Three would
also require a comprehensive data set and
analytical capacities, including econometric
models, to assist in the formulation of
policy.
Following publication of the abovementioned report, work at the EMI in the
field of strategy concentrated on the
preparation of the infrastructure necessary
to support monetary policy decision-making
irrespective of the strategy to be chosen.
Preparatory work was initiated on the
definition of monetary aggregates for Stage
Three, the preparation of organisational
and methodological aspects of the ESCB’s
forecasting procedures and the development
of indicators of fiscal stance at the euro
area-wide level. EMI staff also carried out
work on a number of other topics, such as

42

the measurement of inflation and inflation
expectations, the leading indicator
properties of financial variables and studies
of money and credit demand in the EU.
In the field of econometric modelling, a
major project was launched which was
concerned with the development of an
ESCB multi-country macroeconomic model
and involved collaboration between the
EMI and NCBs. In the course of the year
the specification of the model was agreed,
the supporting database constructed and
work commenced on the estimation of the
model, which is due to become available as
an operational tool in the second half of
1998. In addition, further work was carried
out by EMI staff on the development of a
euro area-wide macroeconomic model
designed to summarise the broad contours
of the average transmission mechanism of
monetary policy in the euro area. This euro
area-wide model has already been used for
forecasting and simulation purposes in the
context of Stage Two co-ordination
exercises. Furthermore, a number of
statistical tools to be used for forecasting
purposes were developed and refined by
EMI staff.

1.2 Implementation of the single
monetary policy
Instruments and procedures
The conceptual phase of the preparatory
work dealing with the instruments and
procedures necessary for implementing the
single monetary policy in Stage Three was
concluded at the end of 1996, thus leading
to the publication in January 1997 of an
EMI report entitled “The single monetary
policy in Stage Three - Specification of the
operational framework” (the “Framework
Report”). The first half of 1997 was devoted
to defining the technical specifications for

the ESCB’s operational framework and this
work led to the publication in September
1997 of an EMI report entitled “The single
monetary policy in Stage Three - General
documentation on ESCB monetary policy
instruments and procedures”. In the second
half of the year the detailed specification of
all the instruments and procedures, including
the preparation of the relevant legal and
technical infrastructure, progressed further
and the setting-up of the ECB tools
necessary for the implementation of the
future monetary policy of the ESCB was
begun. This work continued into early
1998. The second half of 1998 will be
devoted to a thorough testing of the
procedures and systems to be used in
Stage Three.
The EMI Council has defined a set of
monetary policy instruments that will be
made available to the ESCB. It is envisaged
that the ESCB will mainly use open market
operations, but that it will also offer two
standing facilities. In addition, preparations
are being made to enable the ESCB to
implement a minimum reserve system
should the Governing Council of the ECB
decide to do so.
As regards open market operations, these
will normally be based on tender
procedures. Only outright operations and
the other types of operations used for finetuning purposes by the ESCB may be
conducted through bilateral procedures.
The procedures, time frame and calendar
for ESCB tenders have been designed in
such a way as to meet the requirements of
money market participants to the greatest
possible extent. For most open market
operations, namely the main refinancing
operations, the longer-term refinancing
operations and, possibly, the issuance of
debt certificates, the ESCB will use the socalled standard tenders. These tenders will
be executed within 24 hours of their
announcement. The time frame for standard
tenders foresees that the ESCB will
announce the tender results within

approximately two hours of the deadline
for the submission of bids by financial
institutions. In fine-tuning operations either
bilateral operations or so-called quick
tenders will be executed. Quick tenders
will be completed within around one hour
of the announcement of the tender.
Despite the fact that bank holidays in the
Member States differ, a calendar of regular
ESCB tender operations will be established,
which will ensure that all counterparties in
the euro area will be able to participate in
the main and longer-term refinancing
operations conducted by the ESCB at all
times.
The settlement of open market operations
based on standard tenders will normally
take place on the first business day following
the trade date. In contrast, fine-tuning open
market operations will normally be settled
on the trade date itself, in order to make
sure that these operations have an
immediate liquidity impact. For outright
transactions and foreign exchange swaps,
the ESCB will apply settlement dates in line
with market practice. While the ESCB will
aim at settling the transactions related to its
open market operations simultaneously in
all Member States, the possibility cannot be
ruled out that the precise timing of the
settlement of open market operations during
the course of the day will differ across the
euro area at the start of Stage Three,
owing to some operational constraints on
national securities settlement systems.
With regard to the ESCB’s two standing
facilities, their use will largely be influenced by
the ESCB’s end-of-day procedures, which will
be of particular importance for the operation
of the money markets. The normal closing
time for TARGET will be 6 p.m. ECB time. At
that time, all the debit positions of
counterparties will automatically be treated as
a request for recourse to the marginal lending
facility. NCBs will start their end-of-day
procedures at 6.30 p.m. ECB time. This will
also be the deadline for requests to access

43

the ESCB’s deposit facility. These end-of-day
procedures have been devised so as to
maximise the flexibility available to
counterparties, while at the same time bearing
in mind the need to perform the ESCB’s
monetary policy functions.
The EMI is currently carrying out the
preparatory work necessary to enable the
ESCB to impose minimum reserve
requirements as from the start of Stage
Three. A proposal for a draft EU Council
Regulation on minimum reserves was
published as an annex to the EMI’s
“Framework Report”. During 1997 the EMI
discussed this draft Regulation in the context
of an informal discussion with the Monetary
Committee. As a result, an amended text
will be formally presented to the EU Council
by the ECB shortly after its establishment, in
accordance with Article 106 (6) of the
Treaty. The minimum reserve system would
include an averaging mechanism that would
allow counterparties to smooth temporary
liquidity shocks over the maintenance
period, which is envisaged to have a time
span of one month. With regard to the
reserve base, the EMI has proposed that
minimum reserves may be applied to the
liability items on the balance sheets of
institutions subject to reserve requirements.
Some liabilities resulting from off-balance
sheet items could also be included in the
reserve base. The relevant liability items are
reported for statistical purposes at the end
of the calendar month preceding the start
of the maintenance period. This does not
imply that all these balance-sheet items
would be subject to a positive reserve ratio,
but merely that these would be the relevant
and potential liability items if the Governing
Council of the ECB were to decide in
favour of a minimum reserve system.

Eligible counterparties and assets
Common eligibility criteria have been defined
for the counterparties and the assets to be
used in operations with the ESCB.

44

With regard to counterparties, if minimum
reserves are applied, all institutions subject
to minimum reserve requirements will be
eligible to access open market operations
and the two standing facilities. If no minimum
reserves are applied, it is to be expected
that the range of counterparties will broadly
correspond to the range of credit
institutions. Only for the purpose of finetuning operations will the ESCB deal with a
more limited range of counterparties, for
obvious reasons of efficiency. The ESCB’s
counterparties will need to satisfy certain
prudential and operational requirements. In
particular, counterparties will have to be
financially sound institutions, subject to
prudential supervision and able to participate
in the relevant ESCB operations under the
technical conditions set by the ESCB.
Eligible assets will be classified as either tier
one or tier two assets. Tier one will consist
of marketable debt instruments fulfilling
uniform euro area-wide eligibility criteria.
Tier two will consist of additional assets,
marketable and non-marketable, which are
of particular importance for national financial
markets and banking systems and for which
eligibility criteria will be established by NCBs,
subject to the minimum eligibility criteria
established by the ECB. All eligible assets
will be subject to specific risk control
measures. These risk control measures were
defined during the course of 1997, taking
into account market practices and reactions
to initial proposals from the EMI. For tier
one instruments, risk control measures will
consist of initial margins, specific valuation
haircuts differentiated according to the
residual maturity and coupon structure of
the debt instrument (implying that the
value of the underlying asset will be
calculated as the market value of the asset
less a certain percentage (haircut)) and
margin calls aimed at ensuring over time
that the valuation of the underlying asset
matches the amount of liquidity provided
plus the value of the initial margin. Risk
control measures for tier two assets
complementing the initial margins will be

proposed by those NCBs which have
included such assets in their lists, and these
measures will have to be approved by the
ECB. The ESCB will aim to ensure
consistency in the application of the risk
control measures for tier two assets across
the euro area.

Preparatory work for the implementation of
monetary policy instruments
As monetary policy will be implemented on
a decentralised basis, with the ECB carrying
out bilateral fine-tuning operations only
under exceptional circumstances, the main
preparatory work for the introduction of
the euro has been undertaken by the
NCBs. This consists in their adapting the
whole set of monetary policy instruments
and procedures used at present. The EMI is
in charge of monitoring the implementation
of this work and co-ordinating the projects
and developments.
In particular, the EMI is supervising the
preparation by each NCB of its own set of
legal requirements to be used in its relations
with monetary policy counterparties. This
documentation is being prepared on the
basis of a common set of legal requirements
that will help to ensure a level playing-field
throughout the euro area.

An ESCB internal IT infrastructure is currently
being prepared for the execution of both
tender operations and bilateral transactions.
The processing of tender operations will
require several sequential steps involving
intra-ESCB communication, while the
processing of bilateral transactions will
involve a real-time IT system connecting
the ECB and the NCBs.
In order to establish the lists of eligible
assets proposed by the NCBs and eligible
counterparties for ESCB monetary policy
operations, the EMI is setting up systems
which will compile all the relevant
information, calculate the parameters of
risk control measures and enable regular
exchanges of information to be carried out
within the ESCB. In addition, both the list of
individual eligible assets, with the possible
exception of certain categories of nonmarketable assets, and that of institutions
subject to reserve requirements will be
made available to the public.
Another crucial project for the
implementation of the single monetary
policy is the setting-up of an effective
system of liquidity management. It will
require an integrated daily flow of
information between the NCBs and the
ECB, both with respect to liquidity forecasts
and for the purpose of conducting
decentralised monetary policy operations.

2 Foreign exchange policy
2.1 The ERM II
In the context of future foreign exchange
policy co-operation between Member States
participating in the euro area and other EU
countries, work was conducted in 1997 at
the level of both the ECOFIN Council and
the EMI, in accordance with the broad lines
defined in a report the EMI submitted on
this issue to the Dublin meeting of the
European Council in December 1996. The
European Council meeting held in
Amsterdam in June 1997 approved a
Resolution relating to the new exchange
rate mechanism to be introduced in Stage
Three of EMU. In parallel, the EMI has
finalised the draft agreement between the
ECB and future non-euro area NCBs,
which lays down the operating procedures
for the ERM II; the draft agreement will be
submitted to the ECB for endorsement
following its establishment in early summer
1998. In the meantime the EMI has been
continuing to work on the development of
the technical infrastructure to enable the
system to be operational as from 1 January
1999.

In accordance with Article 30.1 of the
ESCB/ECB Statute, at the beginning of
Stage Three NCBs will transfer foreign
reserve assets up to an amount equivalent
to E 50 billion to the ECB. Work has been
undertaken in order to facilitate the decision
on the amount that will actually be
transferred and on the modalities of the
initial transfer of reserve assets. Likewise,
work has been initiated to prepare
complementary Community legislation
which will enable the ECB, in accordance
with Article 30.4 of the ESCB/ECB Statute,
to make further calls on the NCBs’ foreign
reserve assets beyond the limit of
E 50 billion set in Article 30.1.

2.2 Foreign exchange intervention
and the management of the
ECB’s foreign reserve assets

2.3 Guidelines for the NCBs’ and
Member States’ operations with
their foreign reserve assets

In 1997 implementation work on the
conduct of potential foreign exchange
intervention by the ECB focused on aspects
related to the required operational
framework and information systems
support. The infrastructure currently being
designed will make it possible for the ESCB
to execute intervention, both within and
outside the ERM II.

While foreign reserve assets in excess of
those transferred to the ECB at the
beginning of Stage Three will be held and
managed by the NCBs, market transactions
conducted with those assets will be
monitored by the ECB with a view to
ensuring consistency with the single
monetary policy and the foreign exchange
policy of the euro area. A similar monitoring
framework will be put in place for
transactions performed by euro area
Member States involving the use of their
foreign exchange working balances. A
framework has been elaborated on this

As regards the ECB’s foreign reserve
management, the information systems
support needed by the ECB for its strategic
decision-making processes is currently being

46

developed, including the setting of the
overall operational objectives in terms of
currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk
and liquidity risk. This technical infrastructure
will be used to convey the ECB’s decisions
to the NCBs, which could then be in
charge of carrying out portfolio management
operations in accordance with these
instructions, pending a decision by the
Governing Council of the ECB.

issue, encompassing not only central
governments but also all public authorities
within the euro area. Hence in accordance
with Article 31 of the ESCB/ECB Statute,
foreign exchange operations carried out by
the NCBs with their remaining foreign
reserve assets, the amount of which exceeds
a threshold to be set by the ECB, will be
subject to prior approval by the ECB.
Similarly, market transactions effected by
the Member States and changes in their
foreign exchange working balances will be
subject to a prior notification procedure if
the amount in question exceeds a threshold
to be set by the ECB. Through this
procedure the ECB will be in a position to
determine, if deemed necessary, the
modalities of such transactions. In addition,
ex post reporting requirements have been
defined for both the euro area NCBs and
the Member States. The EMI has finalised
two draft proposals which will be submitted
for approval to the ECB: one encompassing
operations conducted by the NCBs and
another covering transactions made by
Member States. In addition, an arrangement
to be established between the European
Commission and the ECB has been prepared,
which will enable the ECB to be kept
informed, through notification and reporting
procedures, of the Commission’s foreign
exchange operations.

2.4 The euro reference exchange
rates
The EMI conducted work during 1997
aimed at preparing procedures for the
computation and publication of the
reference exchange rates for the euro. In
March 1997 a meeting on changeover
issues was held in Frankfurt between the
EMI, the NCBs and EU-wide banking and
financial associations. In this context, the
EMI clarified its views on a number of
aspects: (i) its preference for the “certain”
quotation method (i.e. E1 = x amount of
foreign currency) for defining euro
exchange rates; (ii) the notion that a euro

area-wide official fixing procedure involving
the ECB and NCBs will not be required;
and (iii) the need for the ESCB to compute
and publish daily reference exchange rates
for the euro. Further work on these issues
is currently under way in order to establish
the method to be used in determining the
euro reference exchange rates and other
procedural aspects linked to the
dissemination of those rates.

2.5 The pre-announcement of the
bilateral rates to be used in
determining the irrevocable
conversion rates for the euro
The Luxembourg European Council held in
December 1997 stated in its conclusions
that “the bilateral exchange rates which will
be used to determine the conversion rates
for the euro will be announced on
3 May 1998 for those Member States
participating in the euro from the start”.
The Treaty requires that the formal adoption
of the irrevocable conversion rates for the
euro take place on 1 January 1999 upon a
proposal by the Commission and after
consulting the ECB. In addition, the fact that
some of the ECU component currencies
(the Danish krone, the Greek drachma and
the pound sterling) will not be participating
in the euro area from the start means that
it is not possible to announce the irrevocable
euro conversion rates for the participating
currencies. However, it was possible to
pre-announce the bilateral rates of the
currencies participating in the euro area
which will be used on 31 December 1998
to set the irrevocable conversion rates for
the euro.
The Joint Communiqué6 issued on 2 May
1998 by the Ministers and central bank
governors of the EU Member States
participating in the euro area, the European
Commission and the EMI, as the forerunner
6

The official documentation is reproduced in an
annex to this Annual Report.

47

of the ECB, clarifies that these rates are the
ERM bilateral central rates for the currencies
of the euro area Member States. The
method to be used on 31 December 1998
to set the irrevocable conversion rates for
the euro will be the regular daily
concertation procedure, which will take
place at 11.30 a.m. on that day. According
to this procedure and in the context of a
teleconference, the NCBs of the Member
States will provide one another with the
exchange rate of their respective currency
against the US dollar, once the NCBs have
ascertained that the bilateral rates obtained
by crossing the respective US dollar rates
are equal to the pre-announced ERM

48

bilateral central rates. The euro area NCBs
stand ready to ensure this equality, if
necessary through the use of appropriate
market techniques. The next step will involve
the final official ECU exchange rates against
the EU currencies being set by multiplying
(or dividing, depending on quotation
conventions) the USD/ECU exchange rate
by their respective US dollar exchange
rate. The exchange rates of the official
ECU vis-à-vis the currencies of the euro
area Member States will be adopted by the
Council as the irrevocable conversion rates
for the euro on and with effect from
1 January 1999.

3 Statistics
3.1 Implementation of the statistical
requirements for Stage Three
The Treaty requires the EMI to make the
statistical preparations necessary to enable
the ESCB to perform its functions in Stage
Three.
A statement of these statistical requirements,
the so-called implementation package, was
released in July 1996, and soon afterwards
NCBs started to discuss their
implementation with national banking
associations and other interested parties.
The requirements were summarised in the
EMI’s Annual Report 1996 and are not
repeated here except where necessary as
background information to subsequent
developments.
Much of 1997 was spent implementing
these requirements and clarifying points of
detail, where necessary. The EMI published
provisional lists of institutions forming the
Monetary Financial Institutions (MFI) sector,
in addition to documents covering money
and banking and balance of payments
statistics in Member States. The EMI engaged
in informal discussions concerning legal
aspects of the statistical framework for
Stage Three and defined the specifications
for a substantial part of the necessary IT
infrastructure.

Money and banking statistics
The EMI’s publication entitled “European
Money and Banking Statistical Methods”
(April 1997) describes the statistical systems
in Member States in the field of money and
banking statistics as at the end of 1996.
Meeting the requirements set out in the
implementation package will imply changes
in all Member States. Two EU-wide
monitoring exercises during the course
of 1997 recorded the progress made in

implementing these changes. In general, the
changes were being introduced without
major difficulty. In some Member States the
adoption of breakdowns by original maturity
for certain items on banks’ balance sheets
and the agreed 15 working day deadline
for the transmission of national data to the
ECB were reported to have caused some
initial difficulties.
The definition of Monetary Financial
Institutions is set out in the implementation
package. MFIs will report a monthly balance
sheet and more detailed quarterly
information, although smaller institutions
are exempt from some of the reporting
requirements. A provisional list of MFIs was
published in September 1997. It mainly
comprised credit institutions as defined in
Community law, in addition to certain
other financial institutions corresponding to
the MFI definition, although not at that
stage including money market funds. An
addendum to the provisional list, comprising
money market funds, was published in
December 1997.
Following further testing and reviews, a final
version of the list of MFIs was released in
April 1998. Comprising some 11,000
institutions, it provides as homogeneous a
population as possible for statistical purposes.
It will facilitate the production of a
comprehensive and consistent balance sheet
of the money-creating sector in the single
currency area and support other important
statistical applications such as the ESA 95. It
will also be used in connection with the
selection of counterparties for the monetary
policy operations of the ESCB.
In close collaboration with the NCBs, the
EMI prepared guidelines for the compilation
of money and banking statistics covering
some forty issues. The EMI also clarified the
reporting requirements to be met by NCBs,
since they form part of the MFI sector and

49

contribute to monetary statistics. In the
areas of interest rates and securities issues
statistics, more extensive use will be made
of existing data sources for the time being.

and full consistency to be achieved in some
areas, especially in the treatment of
derivatives, the portfolio account in general
and the valuation of outstanding stocks.

The implementation package requires the
first data compiled on the agreed new basis
to be available for end-June 1998, and
monthly thereafter, with back data on the
closest possible approximation to it from
September 1997 to be available by
September 1998. With the help of the
NCBs, the EMI is preparing estimates for
earlier periods; for most Member States
these cannot be exact because the
harmonised balance sheet categories and
geographical breakdowns of external
positions necessary for the correct
calculation of aggregates for the future
single currency area are not available in the
required detail for earlier periods.

Derivatives and the portfolio account already
present difficulties in some national balances
of payments. Another difficulty which has
been noted in monitoring exercises is
timeliness: only nine Member States would
currently be able to meet a six-week deadline
for all monthly key items. Ireland and the
United Kingdom do not have a full balance of
payments on a monthly basis at present; both
made considerable progress in preparing
estimates in 1997.

Balance of payments statistics
EU Member States either adopted the
provisions of the 5th edition of the IMF
Balance of Payments Manual in the course
of 1997 or intend to do so during 1998.
The monthly key items for the balance of
payments of the single currency area will
conform as far as is practicable with the
new IMF Manual. The more detailed data
envisaged for a quarterly and an annual
balance of payments (and for an annual
statement of the international investment
position (IIP)) will be compatible with the
IMF’s standard components. A large part of
the necessary harmonisation of definitions
will be accomplished in the process.
The implementation package contains few
details concerning either the statistical
treatment of derivatives in the balance of
payments or the IIP. Both matters received
close attention from the EMI in 1997. The
requirements for the single currency area
correspond to international standards as
amended by international agreement. It will
nevertheless take some time for uniformity

50

Balance of payments estimates for 1998
covering key items for the future single
currency area will be compiled from data
without breaking counterparties down into
residents of countries participating in the
single currency area and residents of other
countries, and so will take the form of an
aggregation of net balances in each category
of the national balances of payments. The
first IIP for end-1998 will also be compiled
on a net basis.

Financial accounts
The implementation package foresees a
need for detailed information covering
financial transactions and balance sheets for
the single currency area to complement
monetary analysis and policy research. The
document suggests that it should be possible
to compile, within the conceptual framework
set out in the ESA 95, a fairly full, though
not complete, account for the single
currency area from monetary, balance of
payments and capital market statistics,
drawing also on national financial accounts
as far as possible. These data should be
compiled on a quarterly basis in order to
be of real use to the ECB.
In 1997 the EMI established that it would
indeed be possible to compile a quarterly

set of financial accounts as described above
and began work in order to design them.
Like the balance of payments, financial
accounts also represent an area in which it
is agreed that the Commission (EUROSTAT)
and the EMI share responsibility at the
European level. The approach to shared
responsibility is summarised in Section 3.2
on organisation.

Other economic and financial statistics
The implementation package states that
there is a need for government finance
statistics, as they measure an important
influence on monetary conditions; for
statistics on prices and costs, since these
relate directly to the ESCB’s primary
responsibility to maintain price stability; and
for a wide range of economic statistics
(relating to components of demand, output,
the labour market, etc.), which provide the
background for the conduct of monetary
policy and foreign exchange operations.
All these statistics are the responsibility of
the Commission (EUROSTAT) and the EMI
is involved in their development in its
capacity as a closely interested user. Much
further work was done in 1997 to
harmonise the treatment of government
deficit and debt statistics in order to make
the data comparable for the purpose of
assessing convergence under Article 109j
of the Treaty. In March 1997 the
Commission published the first harmonised
consumer price statistics covering the EU.
These statistics, combined to form an
aggregate covering the euro area, are likely
to constitute the main measure of prices
monitored by the ECB.
EU Member States have a legal commitment
to implement the requirements of the ESA 95
starting in spring 1999. Although some Member
States have derogations regarding certain
parts of the ESA 95, this step will lead to
increased harmonisation in national accounts

statistics; preparatory work to this end
proceeded in 1997. In addition, the EMI has
strongly supported a Commission initiative to
harmonise the frequency, timeliness and
coverage of a wide range of conjunctural
statistics to the extent deemed necessary. A
short-term statistics Regulation has recently
been enacted by the EU Council. This initiative
will take some time to become fully effective,
however, because the Regulation allows delays
in implementation of up to five years.
Meanwhile, arrangements are being made to
speed up the availability of national data.

3.2 Organisation of statistical work
at the European level
The EMI’s Annual Reports for 1995 and
1996 noted the agreed division of
responsibility between the Commission
(EUROSTAT) and the EMI. This included
shared responsibility for balance of payments
statistics and financial accounts.
During 1997 further consideration was given
to the sharing of responsibility in these
areas. In the balance of payments, it has
been suggested that the Commission
(EUROSTAT) should compile data relating
to most of the current account and the
capital account (in the new terminology),
while it is expected that the ECB will
compile data relating to the financial account
(in the new terminology) and the investment
income part of the current account.
Reflecting the Commission’s knowledge in
the area and its use of the data for certain
policy purposes, both institutions will play a
role in the compilation of direct investment
statistics. A joint publication of data is
envisaged. This arrangement relates to
quarterly and annual balance of payments
data; only the ECB is expected to be
involved in the compilation of monthly key
items.
In the area of financial accounts, the legal
requirement laid down in the ESA 95 is for
an annual frequency. The EMI, and

51

prospectively the ECB, will take the lead in
developing quarterly financial accounts
relating to the single currency area following
the approach described above and, together
with the Commission (EUROSTAT), will
monitor the implementation of the ESA 95
in the area of financial accounts.
The EMI and the future ECB will continue
to co-operate closely with the Commission
(EUROSTAT) on all statistical matters of
common interest. The respective statistical
responsibilities of the ECB and the
Commission at the European level will
need to be formally agreed following the
establishment of the ECB.

3.3 Legal aspects
A draft EU Council Regulation concerning
the collection of statistics by the ECB was
published in the EMI’s report entitled “The
single monetary policy in Stage Three Specification of the operational framework”
in January 1997.
During 1997 the EMI discussed this draft
Regulation informally within an ad hoc
group of the Monetary Committee. Senior
EU statistical committees also commented
on it. The amended text will be formally
presented to the EU Council by the ECB

52

shortly after its establishment, in accordance
with Article 106 (6) of the Treaty.
In order to give effect to this EU Council
Regulation concerning the collection of
statistics, the ECB will need to issue legal
instruments in accordance with Article 34
of the Statute.

3.4 Information systems
infrastructure
The design of a system for electronic data
transmission within the ESCB was essentially
completed by summer 1997. By the end of
1997 much of the implementation had
already been completed, thus permitting
the first test electronic transmissions to take
place in January 1998. The system uses the
GESMES-CB message format, which is
generally applicable for the purpose of
statistical data exchange in time-series
format. It is likely to be widely used for the
exchange of statistics between international
organisations.
In 1997 the EMI also started to prepare its
internal systems in order for them to be
able to receive, process and store the large
amounts of statistical data which the ECB
will need to handle in Stage Three.

4 Payment systems
4.1 The TARGET system
In September 1997 the EMI released the
“Second progress report on the TARGET
(Trans-European Automated Real-time
Gross settlement Express Transfer) project”.7
The report provided further information on
the progress made with regard to the
organisational aspects and implementation
of the system. It mainly addressed the
following issues: 1) operating time; 2) pricing
policies; 3) the provision of intraday liquidity
to non-euro area NCBs; 4) the role of the
ECB in TARGET; and 5) TARGET
implementation.
With reference to the TARGET operating
time, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day
will be the only two common holidays for
TARGET, in addition to Saturdays and
Sundays. On all other days the TARGET
system will be open, although NCBs will be
free to close their domestic systems on
national holidays when the law or the
respective banking community so require.
Provided that at least two real-time gross
settlement (RTGS) systems are open, the
Interlinking system between those systems
will also remain open. A calendar of
TARGET operating days for 1999 (including
a list of national RTGS closing days) will be
published in August 1998. Moreover, it has
been agreed that the normal TARGET
operating hours will be from 7 a.m. to
6 p.m. ECB time, i.e. the time in the place
where the ECB is located.
The precise level of the fee to be charged for
cross-border TARGET transactions will be
decided by the Governing Council of the
ECB. The fee is expected to be close to the
lower end of the previously indicated range
of E 1.50 to 3.00. In addition, a price
differentiation can be expected, which will be
based on volume and will result in an average
user cost of well below E 1.50 for participants
making extensive use of TARGET.

As the follow-up to a decision taken by the
EMI Council in December 1996, 8 three
mechanisms are being prepared in order to
prevent intraday credit, if provided by euro
area NCBs to non-euro area NCBs, from
spilling over into overnight credit.
The three mechanisms are as follows:
mechanism 1: high penalty rates for
spillovers (supplemented by non-pecuniary sanctions) and an early cut-off
time for customer payments both in
euro area and in non-euro area countries;9
mechanism 2: limits (possibly set at
zero) for intraday credit granted by
euro area NCBs to non-euro area
NCBs;
mechanism 3: an earlier cut-off time for
non-euro area TARGET participants
(NCBs and credit institutions). In this
case, the earlier cut-off time would not
apply to the processing of payments by
non-euro area NCBs, but rather to their
use of intraday credit in euro.
The decision on these issues will be taken
by the Governing Council of the ECB.

An updated version of the technical annexes
originally published in August 1996 (Interlinking
specifications, a data dictionary and details of the
minimum common performance features of RTGS
systems within TARGET) and a further technical
annex concerning end-of-day procedures were
made available to interested parties.
See the EMI’s report entitled “The single
monetary policy in Stage Three - Specification of
the operational framework”, which was published
in January 1997.
The early cut-off time for customer payments
applies to all three mechanisms.

53

The ECB will be connected to TARGET via
its own payment mechanism (the ECB
payment mechanism, or EPM), through
which it will perform the following functions:
maintain accounts on behalf of its
institutional customers (excluding credit
institutions);
process payments for itself and its
customers;
provide settlement services to crossborder large-value net settlement
systems.
Moreover, the ECB will provide end-of-day
procedures and possibly other control
measures for the TARGET system.
According to the schedule for TARGET
testing and implementation, before being
permitted to migrate (in late 1998) with
their Interlinking/RTGS components towards
TARGET production, the NCBs and the
EMI/ECB have to complete the following
three sets of tests: (i) static and dynamic
tests, (ii) multilateral tests, and (iii) simulation
tests. All NCBs had started static testing by
April 1998. Fourteen RTGS systems have
already completed the static tests, twelve
the dynamic tests, and four have also
completed the multilateral tests.
A brochure providing a general description
of the TARGET system was published in
May 1998.

4.2 Securities settlement systems
In 1997 preparatory work focused on two
main aspects: the establishment of standards
for the use of securities settlement systems
(SSSs) in ESCB credit operations and the
implementation of short-term solutions for
the cross-border use of collateral.

Standards for using SSSs in ESCB credit
operations
The EMI and the EU NCBs have analysed
the settlement procedures for those assets
which will be eligible for collateralising the
monetary policy and payment systems
operations of the ESCB. In particular, ESCB
credit operations will have to be conducted
according to procedures which: (i) prevent
the NCBs from bearing inappropriate risk in
conducting monetary policy operations; and
(ii) ensure the same level of safety for all
NCBs’ operations settled throughout the
European Union. Within this framework,
the EMI has outlined nine basic standards
against which the soundness of those SSSs
to be used for the settlement of ESCB
monetary policy and intraday credit
operations will be assessed.
The standards and the underlying analysis
are described in the EMI’s report entitled
“Standards for the use of Securities
Settlement Systems in ESCB credit
operations”, which was released on 8 January
1998. These standards cover three main
areas: legal issues, settlement and custody
risks, and operational issues.
The first standard states that all SSSs and
the links between them should have a
sound legal basis, which will ensure that
both the settlement of payments and the
transfer of securities are final and that the
rights of the ECB and the NCBs in respect
of securities transferred or held within such
systems for their account are adequately
protected. The second standard aims to
ensure that the cash leg of the settlement is
conducted in central bank money. Standard
3 focuses on the security of collateral held
in custody and states that SSSs should have
adequate safeguards to protect NCBs against
custodial risk, for instance when third-party
depositories are used.
Standards 4 to 6 require that: (i) all SSSs be
subject to regulation and/or control by a
competent authority; (ii) participants be

54

aware of the risks of and access conditions
for using the systems; and (iii) proper risk
management procedures be implemented
in order to cope with the effects of the
default of one or more participants.
Standard 7 concerns intraday settlement
with finality, which must be possible from
the start of Stage Three of EMU. As a first
step, SSSs must ensure intraday finality for
the settlement of ESCB credit operations.
This could be achieved by means of various
operational mechanisms, such as: 1) RTGS
systems for securities transactions; 2) net
securities settlement systems with several
processing cycles during the day; 3) the
pre-depositing of securities (including prepledging) on operational safe custody
accounts held with an NCB; or 4) the free
intraday delivery of securities. The choice
between the four options will be left to the
NCBs on the basis of the existing
infrastructures at the domestic level. As a
longer-term objective, it is envisaged that
all SSSs will have to enable the ESCB to
settle its credit operations by means of
real-time delivery versus payment
settlement facilities.
Standard 8 recommends operating hours
and days consistent with those of the
TARGET system.
Finally, Standard 9 requires the technical
systems to have an adequate level of
operational reliability and adequate backup
facilities to be provided.

Mechanisms for the cross-border use of
collateral in Stage Three of EMU
In July 1997 the EMI Council decided to
adopt the correspondent central banking
model (CCBM) as an interim solution before
the establishment of appropriate links
between SSSs in order to facilitate the
cross-border use of collateral in ESCB
operations (monetary policy and intraday
credit operations). With the CCBM, liquidity
is provided by the home central bank,
based on collateral held on securities
accounts abroad.
The basic principle of the CCBM is that
each NCB will act as a correspondent (for
the delivery of securities) at the request of
any other NCB. Each NCB will therefore
need to open an account for the
administration of securities for every other
NCB. Thus, when an ESCB counterparty
(in country A) wishes to obtain credit, it will
approach its home NCB (NCB A), request
the credit and offer collateral. In the event
that the collateral is held in another country
(country B), the counterparty will arrange
for the collateral to be delivered (this step
may involve a custodian) or otherwise
transferred to a specified securities account
with the NCB of country B (NCB B). NCB
A will request that NCB B inform it upon
delivery of the collateral and, once
confirmation of the final, irrevocable delivery
of the collateral has been received by NCB
A, the latter will release the credit to the
counterparty.

All the standards presented in the report
must be met by SSSs by 1 January 1999,
with the exception of the requirement for
real-time delivery versus payment
settlement facilities (Standard 7), which
should be implemented by 1 January 2002.
On the basis of the results of the assessment,
in September 1998 the ECB will publish a
list of the SSSs to be used for ESCB credit
operations.

5 Preparation of euro banknotes
In the course of 1997 final designs were
developed from the draft designs for the
euro banknotes which were chosen by the
EMI Council in December 1996 (see the
EMI’s Annual Report 1996, Chapter II,
Section 5). Illustrations of the revised designs
were published in July 1997. These form
the basis for the origination work, in the
context of which the designs are being
transformed into printing plates in the first
half of 1998. The selected draft designs
were amended in order to meet a range of
different requirements. First, the architectural
features (gateways, windows and bridges)
were reviewed so as to make sure that
they would be representative of the relevant
period, while at the same time not
representing any specific structure. In
addition, the design of the European map
on the reverse side of the banknotes was
checked and adjusted in order to give an
appropriate representation of the European
continent. Second, a range of security
features, some intended for the benefit of
the general public and others to be used
for authentication purposes in banknote
sorting and accepting machines, were
integrated into the designs. Moreover, tests
were conducted to ensure that it would be
possible for the designs to be produced
successfully, i.e. in particular with the same
visual appearance, by the specific equipment
of the different EU printing works. The
technical specifications were finalised in
accordance with the decision by the EMI
Council that all the printing works which
currently print banknotes issued by the
central banks of the Member States
participating in the euro area should be
involved in the production of the euro
banknotes.
In 1997, in order to identify potential
problems at the earliest possible stage, all
the techniques which will be used for euro
banknote production were tested as part
of a project to produce a test banknote.

56

Ten printing works and eight paper mills
participated in the production of a prototype
euro banknote which included almost all
the security features. The test banknote
project revealed that all the participating
printing works should be in a position to
produce all the euro banknote
denominations to an equal standard of
quality and with an identical appearance. A
zero-production run based on the latest,
modified euro banknote designs will be
conducted in autumn 1998 before mass
production starts in early 1999.
The quantity of euro banknotes to be
printed before the launch date of 1 January
2002 will be determined by two factors:
first, the quantity of banknotes required to
replace the stocks of national banknotes in
circulation (launch stocks) in the participating
countries and, second, the logistical stocks
which will be necessary to ensure that the
banknote changeover process operates
smoothly. On the basis of current estimates,
a total of more than 12 billion banknotes
will be required for the EU Member States
which will participate in the euro area from
the start. Estimates will be updated annually.
The EMI is also undertaking preparatory
work in respect of the legal protection to
be given to the euro banknotes. The EMI
Council has already agreed that, with regard
to copyright protection, the © symbol
should appear on the euro banknotes.
Further aspects which are still under
consideration in this connection are, inter
alia, the need for harmonised rules regarding
the reproduction of euro banknotes; euro
area harmonised rules for the exchange of
damaged banknotes; and ways in which to
prevent and penalise the counterfeiting of
euro banknotes.
With a view to increasing efficiency in
combating counterfeiting, the EMI Council
has agreed to set up a joint investigation

centre and a database in which all technical
data on counterfeit euro banknotes will be
stored.
The date for the launch of the euro
banknotes and coins has been set at
1 January 2002 (see Section 10 on the
changeover for more details). Preliminary
discussions with European federations and
associations on the optimal length and
technical features of the period of dual
circulation took place in all countries (except
Denmark) as well as at the EMI. Finance
Ministries, Mints, NCBs, representative
consumer and retailer organisations and
commercial banks were all involved in the
discussions at the national level.
There is a broad preference for a fairly rapid
cash changeover, i.e. shorter than the period
of up to six months for which provision was
made in the changeover scenario adopted by
the European Council in Madrid in December
1995. The precise length of and conditions
for the cash changeover within the overall
time frame remain a matter for decision by
the Member States. The ECB will continue to
provide a forum for the exchange of views, in
particular among NCBs, on how to prepare
the logistics for the cash changeover at the
national level. The storage of euro banknotes
and coins prior to the launch date will be an
essential element to be considered in this
connection. Other important aspects relate
to the physical exchange of national currency
for the euro banknotes and coins, the
preparation of automated teller machines
(ATMs) and vending machines, and the
distribution to the public of euro banknotes
and coins via retailers.
The EMI also continued its preparatory work
for the first three years of Stage Three, during
which only national banknotes and coins will
circulate. Article 52 of the ESCB/ECB Statute
provides that: “Following the irrevocable fixing
of exchange rates, the Governing Council
shall take the necessary measures to ensure
that banknotes denominated in currencies
with irrevocably fixed exchange rates are

exchanged by the national central banks at
their respective par values.” Against this
background a basic agreement was reached
on the mechanisms for exchanging and
repatriating national banknotes between 1999
and 2002. This agreement commits a majority
of the NCBs of the Member States participating
in the euro area to implementing the following
three measures between 1999 and 2002:
first, with regard to wholesale transactions,
the NCBs party to the agreement will
ensure that in at least one of their
central bank offices non-national euro
area banknotes will be either exchanged
for national banknotes or credited to
an account; these banknotes will be
repatriated to their NCB of issue;
second, with regard to retail transactions,
the exchange of non-national euro area
banknotes for national banknotes at the
counters of the relevant NCBs will be free
of charge for the general public;
third, with regard to the repatriation of
national banknotes to their NCB of
issue, NCBs will provide a free of charge
service for their repatriation, unless
they already levy a service charge on
commercial banks for the depositing of
national banknotes at their counters.
Commercial banks and bureaux de change,
although not bound by Article 52 of the
Statute, will be obliged to apply the fixed
conversion rates when exchanging the national
banknotes of the countries participating in the
euro area in accordance with the Council
Regulation on the introduction of the euro
(which was adopted on 3 May 1998).
Commercial banks and bureaux de change
will also be obliged to display the level of any
handling charge in a clear and transparent
manner as highlighted in the Commission
Recommendation concerning banking charges
for conversion to the euro, dated 15 April
1998.

57

6 Accounting issues
The preparatory work on the accounting
framework to be used for the ESCB was
largely completed in 1997. This framework
will form the basis for the internal and
external reporting of the ESCB and serve
to ensure that liquidity management and
statistical requirements are met. The basic
principles, which were approved by the
EMI Council in 1996, were expanded
through the development of specific
techniques for the various assets and liabilities
that will feature in the ESCB.
The transition to Stage Three was also
examined and the necessary principles and
techniques were developed. The main
objective was to make a clear distinction
between gains and losses (including
unrealised ones) arising before the start of
Stage Three from subsequent ESCB gains
and losses. To this end an initial valuation of

58

NCB (and ECB) assets and liabilities will be
performed according to ESCB rules at the
start of Stage Three. Any gains or losses
arising from this exercise, together with any
such items already on NCB accounts, will
be treated according to national accounting
arrangements in force at the end of Stage
Two. Gains and losses arising from the
irrevocable fixing of the bilateral exchange
rates between the participating currencies
will be treated as realised, as the related
foreign exchange risk will cease to exist at
the start of Stage Three; again, the treatment
of these gains and losses will be subject to
national rules.
Work is continuing on the method for
allocating monetary income in order to
prepare the decisions to be taken by the
Governing Council of the ECB.

7 Information and communications systems
In 1997, in co-operation with the NCBs,
the EMI was able to significantly step up its
efforts to provide the information and
communications systems support required
for a number of operational and policy
functions - to be conducted within the
ESCB - which will involve the ECB and the
NCBs.
Following the decision by the EMI Council
in November 1996 on its technical design,
the teleconference replacement project
was successfully implemented in October
1997. The new teleconference system will
enable several audio conferences to take

place in parallel between the ECB and the
NCBs. Five10 non-EU central banks and the
European Commission are also connected
to the system. The teleconference system
provides a secure means of communication,
in particular for governors and monetary
policy, foreign exchange market and
payment systems experts to discuss urgent
matters. In addition to the teleconference
application itself, the implemented solution
comprises an underlying physical
infrastructure that will serve as the main
network platform for the data transfers
needed for the majority of ESCB-wide
information systems applications:

Relevant ESCB procedures

*

TOP

*

BI

*

ENSD

Exchange

Foreign
reserve

Teleconference

ESCB-Net communications infrastructure

Physical network platform

*

The TOP system will be used to conduct monetary policy open market tender operations; the BI system will
be used to monitor the ESCB’s bilateral interventions; and the ENSD system will be used for the exchange of
data for non-statistical purposes.

In May 1997, following an EU-wide
procurement tender process, the EMI
Council approved the conclusion of a
contract for the supply and maintenance
of an ESCB-wide communications
infrastructure. This will provide secure endto-end file transfer and robust messaging
services, using international and de facto
industry standard protocols and applications.

This infrastructure, known as the ESCBNet, offers synchronous (real-time) and
asynchronous communications services
between all the ESCB institutions. With the
exception of the Interlinking of the RTGS
10

Norges Bank, the Schweizerische Nationalbank,
the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada and the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

59

systems which form the TARGET system,
all projects in preparation for Stage Three
of EMU and requiring new ESCB-wide
exchanges of information will make use of
the ESCB-Net. The ESCB-Net was fully
implemented and tested by May 1998.
During the course of 1997 significant
progress was made in the development of
several ESCB-wide software applications.
These applications will support the conduct
of monetary policy operations, foreign
exchange market interventions and the
management of the ECB’s foreign reserve
assets. These include, in particular: (1) the
TOP application, a system necessary for the
ESCB to conduct decentralised monetary
policy open market operations based on
tender procedures; (2) the BI application, a
system for the monitoring of decentralised
monetary policy operations and bilateral
foreign exchange interventions; (3) the
ENSD application, a system providing
information systems support for the
exchange of data within the ESCB for nonstatistical purposes; (4) the information
systems support for the ESCB’s statistical
functions, providing the background data
exchange necessary for the preparation of
the ECB’s policy decisions; and (5) the
information systems support necessary for
the decentralised management of the
ESCB’s foreign reserve assets. All these
applications will be implemented by mid1998. The second half of 1998 will be
devoted to undertaking the testing of all
the systems and procedures between the
ECB and the NCBs, both automated and
clerical, required to ensure the successful
operation of the ESCB.

60

Furthermore, the EMI and the NCBs
continued the preparatory work for the
TARGET system. In order to minimise the
risk of problems occurring at the start of
live operation of the new payment system
linking the domestic real-time gross
settlement systems of the fifteen Member
States and the ECB payment mechanism,
an Interlinking test environment has been
established. In the second half of 1997
static and dynamic tests were started which
involved a number of NCBs and the EMI.
Further tests will be conducted throughout
1998.
In order to guarantee and maintain an
adequate and co-ordinated level of security
of the information systems to be used by
the ESCB, the EMI Council approved a
framework for a security policy for the
information systems of the ESCB. This
framework establishes agreed responsibilities
for all parties involved in the development,
implementation and use of information
systems. The information systems security
policy defines common principles, roles and
responsibilities related to the management
and planning of the security of information
and communications systems in cooperation between the EMI and the NCBs.
During the course of 1997 the EMI set up a
large number of internal projects with the
aim of selecting and implementing
appropriate technology and systems to
provide the information systems support
necessary for the ECB to conduct its
operations successfully. These projects range
from improved office automation systems
and internal administrative systems to new
or improved statistical and decision support
systems.

8 Banking supervision and financial stability
In Stage Three of EMU prudential
supervision will remain a competence of
the national authorities (either the NCB, or
a non-central bank body or, in some cases,
both together). In addition, the basic features
of the prudential supervisory framework
within the European Union - based on the
harmonisation of the main national legislative
provisions, the principle of “home country
control” and cross-border co-operation
among supervisors - will not be modified.
Nevertheless, besides the advisory function
of the ECB under Article 105 (4) of the
Treaty (which is addressed in the last
paragraph of this section), the Treaty and
the ESCB/ECB Statute assign to the ESCB/
ECB some functions related to the prudential
supervision of credit institutions and the
stability of the financial system which are
explicitly referred to in the following:
Article 105 (5) of the Treaty, which
stipulates that the ESCB shall contribute
to the smooth conduct of policies
pursued by the competent authorities
relating to the prudential supervision of
credit institutions and the stability of the
financial system;
Article 25 (1) of the ESCB/ECB
Statute, which states that the ECB
may offer advice to and be consulted
by the Council, the Commission and
national authorities on the scope and
implementation of Community legislation
relating to the prudential supervision of
credit institutions and the stability of the
financial system;
Article 105 (6) of the Treaty, which
envisages the possibility of assigning
to the ECB specific tasks concerning
policies relating to the prudential
supervision of credit institutions and
other financial institutions (with the
exception of insurance undertakings).

In general terms, the inclusion of the above
provisions in the Treaty and Statute was
justified on three grounds. First, the ESCB,
in the context of its macroeconomic activity,
will oversee developments in financial
markets and institutions and, therefore, will
have at its disposal information which could
be useful for the supervisory function.
Second, the pursuit of the primary objective
of the ESCB (price stability) will need to be
supported by the stability of the banking
and financial system, which is a major
objective of supervisory authorities, along
with the protection of depositors and
investors. Third, there is a relationship
between the measures taken for monetary
policy purposes and those intended to
promote the stability of the banking and
financial systems. The EMI has analysed the
possible implementation of these provisions
with the assistance of the Banking
Supervisory Sub-Committee.
Article 105 (5) of the Treaty, which applies
only to those Member States adopting the
euro, contemplates an obligation for the
ESCB to contribute to the smooth conduct
of policies pursued by the national authorities
responsible for the prudential supervision
of credit institutions and financial stability.
Given the close links existing at the national
level between the monetary policy and the
prudential supervisory functions, as well as
the assignment of responsibility for monetary
policy to the ESCB, the main objective of
the provision laid down in Article 105 (5) of
the Treaty may be regarded as being to
ensure effective interaction between the
ESCB and the national supervisory
authorities. The practical details of the way
in which this relationship will be conducted
will need to be defined in a pragmatic
manner in the light of the specific needs
emerging in Stage Three. At present, two
main contributions on the part of the ESCB
to national supervisory authorities can be
identified.

61

First, the ESCB, and in particular the ECB,
will play an active role in promoting cooperation among the EU national
supervisory authorities, irrespective of the
organisational model adopted in each
country, as well as between the national
authorities and the ESCB, with a view to
achieving a common understanding on
relevant supervisory policy issues. It is
envisaged that such co-operation will rely
on the assistance of a specific committee
composed of representatives of NCBs and
national supervisory authorities and that it
will focus mainly on issues of a macroprudential nature with a bearing on the
stability of financial institutions and markets.
Regardless of the fact that Article 105 (5)
of the Treaty will apply only to those
countries participating in the euro area, it is
envisaged that co-operation will generally
involve all EU supervisory authorities. This
ESCB function is expected to supplement
the framework for multilateral co-operation
within the EU in the field of banking
supervision and to interact smoothly with
the co-operation pursued within the other
banking supervisory forums (the Banking
Advisory Committee and the Groupe de
Contact at the EU level and the Basle
Committee on Banking Supervision at the
G-10 level).
Second, in the light of the relevant provisions
of the BCCI Directive concerning the flow
of information between NCBs and
supervisory authorities, where appropriate,
the ESCB will provide supervisory authorities
with information on individual institutions
and markets obtained as a result of its basic
activities which could be helpful to the
supervisory function. Conversely, banking
supervisors will be prepared to provide the
ESCB with supervisory information on
individual institutions which could be of use
to the ESCB in the performance of its basic
tasks. A common understanding has been
reached among banking supervisors on the
basic features of the flow of information to
the ECB and to NCBs in their capacity as
monetary authorities. In general, although

62

the ESCB should not need supervisory
information for the purpose of its monetary
and foreign exchange policy operations as
a rule, banking supervisors will be prepared
to consider requests from the ESCB in this
area. In addition, in view of the possible
systemic implications, banking supervisors
will be prepared to inform the ESCB on a
case-by-case basis should a banking crisis
arise. Furthermore, banking supervisors will
collaborate with NCBs and the ECB in
order to detect non-compliance by any of
the ESCB’s counterparties with their
obligations as laid down in the ESCB’s rules
on monetary policy instruments and
procedures, although ultimate responsibility
for ensuring compliance will remain with
the competent NCB. With regard to the
flow of information from banking supervisors
to NCBs acting as the overseers of payment
systems, a basic agreement had already
been reached.
Article 25 (1) of the ESCB/ECB Statute which applies to all EU countries - provides
for a specific advisory function for the ECB
in the field of Community legislation relating
to the prudential supervision of credit
institutions and the stability of the financial
system. This function will be optional in
nature and refers to the scope and
implementation of Community legislation in
the above-mentioned fields. This function
may be regarded as an instrument by
means of which the ECB would be able to
contribute to the prudential supervision of
credit institutions and financial stability at
the Community and national levels. In this
respect, the role played by the European
Commission, with the assistance of the
Banking Advisory Committee, in preparing
new proposals for directives in the sphere
of banking legislation is clearly acknowledged.
Article 105 (6) of the Treaty - which
applies to all EU countries - covers the
possibility of certain operational tasks in the
field of prudential supervision being
conferred upon the ECB. The right of
initiative in this area lies with the Commission

and the ECB is only involved in an advisory
capacity. At this stage it is felt that it would
be premature to envisage any transfer of
supervisory powers from national authorities
to the ECB.
Finally, Article 105 (4) of the Treaty (which
applies to all EU countries with the exception
of the United Kingdom) stipulates that the
ECB must be consulted on draft Community
and national legislative provisions falling
within its fields of competence. The precise
scope of this provision will be identified in

the context of the Council Decision to be
adopted by the EU Council, laying down
the limits and conditions under which the
ECB is to be consulted by the competent
authorities on draft national legislation in
accordance with the said article. According
to the draft Council Decision proposed by
the European Commission in February 1998,
the ECB should be consulted on, inter alia,
rules applicable to financial institutions insofar
as they materially influence the stability of
financial institutions and markets.

63

9 Legal issues
9.1 Legal convergence
Member States are obliged, in accordance
with Article 108 of the Treaty, to eliminate
incompatibilities between their national
legislation, on the one hand, and the Treaty
and the ESCB/ECB Statute, on the other. In
October 1997 the EMI published a report
on “Legal Convergence in the Member
States of the European Union as at August
1997” and in March 1998 it published its
Convergence Report prepared as required
under Article 109j (1) of the Treaty. Both
reports distinguished between the statutes
of NCBs and other legislation which needed
to be adapted in the light of the relevant
Treaty and ESCB/ECB Statute provisions.
With regard to the statutes of NCBs, a
distinction was made between adaptations
in the area of central bank independence
and other adaptations to ensure the
necessary degree of integration of NCBs in
the ESCB.
On the basis of features of central bank
independence which had already been
elaborated in previous reports on the
independence of NCBs, in its October
1997 Report the EMI identified certain
provisions in the statutes of NCBs which it
considered to be incompatible with Treaty
and ESCB/ECB Statute requirements on
central bank independence and which, in its
view, should therefore be adapted. Most of
the provisions related to the institutional
independence of an NCB (the prohibition
of external influence, as laid down in
Article 107 of the Treaty) and the personal
independence of members of an NCB’s
decision-making bodies involved in the
performance of ESCB-related tasks (security
of tenure, as laid down in Article 14.2 of
the ESCB/ECB Statute). Adaptations in the
area of the independence of NCBs must
come into effect at the latest at the date of
the establishment of the ECB.

64

Furthermore, the EMI pointed out the
need for the statutes of NCBs to be
adapted in order to ensure the necessary
degree of integration of NCBs in the ESCB,
in accordance with Article 14.3 of the
ESCB/ECB Statute. That Article states that
NCBs will become an integral part of the
ESCB and are required to comply with the
ECB’s guidelines and instructions. 11 This
implies, in particular, that the statutes of
NCBs should not contain any provisions
which are not in line with the exclusive
competence of the ECB in certain areas or
which, if adhered to by an NCB, would
prevent that NCB from complying with the
rules adopted at the level of the ECB.
Areas to which particular attention was
paid were: statutory objectives, tasks,
instruments, organisation and financial
provisions (topics which correspond to the
usual structure of the statutes of NCBs).
Adaptations of the statutes of NCBs in this
respect must come into effect at the start
of Stage Three or, for Member States with
a derogation or a special status, at the date
on which they adopt the single currency.
In its October 1997 Report the EMI paid
particular attention to completed or
envisaged adaptations with extensive
reference to its opinions on such
adaptations which were delivered as part of
consultation procedures under Article 109f
(6) of the Treaty and Article 5.3 of the
Statute of the EMI.
As far as the adaptation of legislation other
than the statutes of NCBs was concerned,
the EMI focused in particular on those laws
with an impact on the performance by an
NCB of its ESCB-related tasks and laws in
11

In conjunction with Article 43.1 of the Statute,
Article 14.3 implies that fully participating NCBs
will become an integral part of the ESCB and that
they will have to comply with guidelines and
instructions issued by the ECB.

the monetary field, such as foreign exchange
acts and coinage acts.
In its Convergence Report of March 1998,
inter alia, the EMI assessed the compatibility
of national legislation, including the statutes
of NCBs, with Treaty and ESCB/ECB Statute
requirements for Stage Three. An excerpt
from the Introduction and summary part of
the 1998 Convergence Report is
incorporated as an Annex to this Report.

9.2 Secondary Community
legislation
The EMI informally consulted the Monetary
Committee on the following three draft ECB
Recommendations for Council Regulations,
which are to be adopted by the Governing
Council of the ECB under Article 42 of the
ESCB/ECB Statute: a draft ECB
Recommendation for a Council Regulation
(EC) concerning the collection of statistical
information by the ECB (see Section 3.3), a
draft ECB Recommendation for a Council
Regulation (EC) concerning the application of
minimum reserves by the ECB (see Section
1.2) and a draft ECB Recommendation for a

Council Regulation (EC) concerning the power
of the ECB to impose sanctions. The latter
Recommendation specifies the limits and
conditions under which the ECB will be
entitled to impose fines or periodic penalty
payments on undertakings as a result of their
failure to comply with obligations laid down in
its Regulations and Decisions.
In addition, the EMI contributed to the
preparation of other secondary Community
legislation relating to the transition from the
EMI to the ECB in the following areas: the
consultation of the ECB by national
authorities on draft legislative provisions
falling within the competence of the
ECB; the statistical data to be used for
the determination of the key for subscription
of the capital of the ECB; the conditions
and procedure for applying the tax for the
benefit of the European Communities; and
the categories of officials and other servants
of the European Communities to whom
the provisions of Article 12, the second
paragraph of Article 13 and Article 14 of
the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities
of the Communities apply (see also Chapter
III, Section 5 below).

65

10 Changeover to the euro
During 1997 preparatory work for the
changeover to the single currency gathered
considerable speed. In all EU Member
States with the exception of Denmark12 ad
hoc co-ordination bodies were created,
detailed changeover scenarios outlined, coordination between institutions and
interested parties organised, and an
appropriate legal framework to complement
the relevant Community legislation prepared.
The EMI continued to keep track of
developments as regards the changeover,
in order to assess whether differing
changeover preparations across Member
States, owing to differences in the local
organisational and infrastructural
environments, might have implications for
the single monetary policy to be conducted
as from January 1999 onwards.
In the financial area, changeover
preparations continue to be fuelled by a
competitively driven process involving
market operators and financial centres,
both within and across countries. The EMI
and the NCBs conducted a continuous
dialogue with their respective banking
communities and other financial market
operators on issues concerning the
introduction of the euro. The guiding
principle applied by the monetary authorities
is to leave responsibility for co-ordinated
action in relation to the changeover
primarily with the market operators
themselves, while being prepared to lend
assistance where necessary. The EMI and
the NCBs have thus encouraged market
operators to consider market-driven
standardisation within Monetary Union.
In meetings between the EMI and
representatives of EU-wide banking and
financial associations the following issues,
inter alia, have been considered:
the replacement in contracts of price
references that may lose their economic

66

significance after the start of Monetary
Union. The publication of national base
rates by NCBs, at which central bank
transactions are no longer effected, will
cease from the start of Stage Three.
National legislators may enact binding
rules to replace obsolete base rates
with new reference rates (preferably
from among those to be published by
the ESCB), should this be deemed
appropriate;
the replacement of existing interbank
rates (e.g. BIBOR, FIBOR, HELIBOR,
MIBOR, PIBOR, RIBOR, etc.) with new
definitions of euro area-wide published
indicator rates. While the publication of
these local rates on a euro area-wide
basis cannot be legally prohibited, the
EMI and the NCBs have encouraged
banking associations and money and
foreign exchange markets operating in
the future euro area to engage in the
collective definition of euro areawide indicators. In response to this
policy message, in 1997 the Banking
Federation of the European Union and
the professional association of foreign
exchange market dealers (known as
ACI - The Financial Markets Association)
announced its intention to compute and
publish a euro area-wide indicator of
interbank rates, which is to be known as
the EURIBOR.13
The EMI also provided assistance in the
establishment of common market standards
in the euro area-wide money markets and
foreign exchange markets. The EMI’s
publications on the operational framework
for the single monetary policy provided
12

13

In Denmark work has been carried out in order to
prepare for the situation of Denmark as a Member
State with a derogation.
The British Bankers’ Association has announced its
plans to publish a euro LIBOR.

interested market operators with
information on the money market and
foreign exchange market procedures to be
followed by the ESCB. This information has
become a natural focal point for the
adaptation of national standards and the
elaboration of new common standards at
the European level.
Furthermore, the EMI offered further
clarification to the markets concerning the
following:
the methods for quoting the euro on
foreign exchange markets;
the publication by the ECB of reference
exchange rates;
the calendar of business days for the
conduct of monetary policy and the
operation of TARGET.
In this connection the EU-wide banking
and financial associations submitted to the
EMI a “Joint statement on market
conventions for the euro”, which lists the
market standards that will apply to trading
and settlement on the euro money, bond
and foreign exchange markets. The joint
statement points out that the harmonisation
of euro market conventions is desirable, as
it would promote liquidity and transparency
in the new markets and prevent confusion
and disputes involving euro trading and
settlement. The EMI Council welcomed
and supported this initiative, observing that
the implementation of such conventions
would enhance the integration of, and
ensure greater transparency in, the euro
financial markets.
The EMI also assisted the EU-wide banking
and financial associations in the
establishment of an effective overnight rate
for the euro area, known as the EONIA
(euro overnight index average). Market
participants noted that private calculation
of an effective overnight rate would be
problematic owing to the sensitivity of the

information that would need to be supplied
by individual banks for the computation of
such a rate. Against this background, the
EMI Council decided to prepare for the
computation of such a rate by the ESCB.
Accordingly, the ESCB will take on the
computational aspects related to the
reference rate, relying on the panel and
methodology provided by the banking
associations for the EURIBOR. Responsibility
for publishing the reference rate will lie
with the banking associations. Discussions
are under way between the EMI and the
relevant associations so as to arrive at a
collectively agreed procedure.
The EMI recognised the need for a distinctive
codified symbol for the single currency and
expressed its support for the symbol E ,
proposed by the European Commission, as
the logo for the euro. A symbol to identify
the euro accords with the current use of
abbreviations in written language. It also
provides a distinctive sign for use in price
lists and other documents including
monetary values which may be of particular
help during the transition phase. The EMI
encourages the inclusion of the E symbol
in the standard character sets which are
widely used in the information technology
industry.
A special section on changeover issues has
been included as part of the information
provided on the EMI’s Web site (http://
www.ecb.int). With a view to assisting all
those involved in preparing for the
changeover, the EMI has improved the
distribution of relevant information. Apart
from the documents on changeover issues
approved by the EMI Council in 1997, the
Web site also includes a bibliography and a
list of more than 200 links to other Web
pages which specifically offer information
on the changeover to the single currency.
The links are divided into eleven categories:
central banks; EU institutions; national
governments; associations of the banking
and financial industry; credit institutions;
stock exchanges, securities settlement

67

systems and payment systems; associations
of enterprises, commerce and services;
business consultancy firms; information
technology issues; newspapers, newsletters,
magazines and bibliographies; and others.
For each link, a summary is given of the
information available on the relevant page.
This information is updated on a regular
basis and thus provides a convenient data
source for all those involved in preparing
for the changeover.
In response to mounting public demand for
further confirmation of the details of the

68

changeover to support preparatory work,
the EMI Council and the EU Council decided
on 4 November 1997, for banknotes and
coins, that euro fiduciary money would be
put into circulation in all participating
countries as from 1 January 2002 onwards.
This decision was taken after careful
consideration of all possible options,
including the possibility of having different
introduction dates in the various participating
countries. An extensive round of
consultations took place, both at the national
and at the EU-wide level, involving all
interested parties.

11 Public information
Since its establishment on 1 January 1994
the EMI has been working intensively to
prepare the regulatory, organisational and
logistical framework necessary for the ESCB
to perform its tasks in Stage Three of EMU.
As part of this process, the EMI has fulfilled
its reporting obligations in accordance with
Articles 7 and 11.3 of the EMI Statute by
publishing reports on the state of the
preparations for Stage Three of EMU, on its
own activities and on monetary and financial
conditions in the Community. In addition, in
recognition of the needs of the financial
community and of the general public, the
EMI has over the past three years released
a number of publications on its preparatory
work with a view to both reporting on its
activities and offering readers guidance in
planning their own preparations. These
publications have ranged from general
information material on the EMI’s role and
functions and on the draft designs for the
euro banknotes, to more technical reports
dealing with monetary policy, statistics,
payment systems and various aspects of the
changeover to the single currency.

A list of all the documents published by the
EMI since the beginning of 1997 appears at
the end of this Report. A similar list has
appeared in each of the EMI’s previous
Annual Reports.
In addition to producing its publications, in
January 1998 the EMI established a presence
on the Internet’s World Wide Web in
order to facilitate the EMI’s provision of
information to the general public. The
EMI’s Web site (http://www.ecb.int)
provides access to the texts of recent
speeches and reports published by the EMI,
and includes a special section on changeover
issues.
The EMI recognises that there is a need for
the ESCB to ensure the transparency of its
objectives and policies in Stage Three and to
foster knowledge of its operations and tasks,
thus enabling the financial community and the
general public to both understand and support
its policies. To this end, the EMI is developing
an external communication policy - to be
presented for consideration by the Governing
Council of the ECB - on the most effective
ways in which to disseminate information
concerning the activities of the ESCB.

Chapter III

Other tasks of the EMI

1 Oversight of the ECU Clearing and Settlement System
The ECU Clearing and Settlement System
falls under the oversight of the EMI by
virtue of Article 109f (2), sixth indent, of
the Treaty. The oversight of the ECU
Clearing and Settlement System has the
fundamental objective of seeking to ensure
that the Euro Banking Association (EBA),
which manages the system and which
superseded the ECU Banking Association
on 3 December 1997, takes the necessary
measures to ensure that the system does
not pose unacceptable risks either to
participants in the system or to the ECU or
domestic markets in the EU. Within this
framework, the major line of action of the
EMI is to ensure that adequate measures
are taken to improve the system’s
compliance with the safety standards laid
down in the 1990 G-10 Report on Interbank
Netting Schemes (the so-called “Lamfalussy
standards”).
Moreover, during 1997 the EMI and the
NCBs monitored the preparatory work
conducted by the EBA on its Euro Clearing
and Settlement System for Stage Three of
EMU (EURO 1).

1.1 Activities of the ECU Clearing
and Settlement System in 1997
In 1997 the number of transactions declined
in comparison with 1996, while the value
rose slightly. The monthly average number
of daily transactions fell by over 6%, from
6,383 in 1996 to 5,982 in 1997. In
comparison, the average daily turnover
rose from ECU 46.0 billion in 1996 to
ECU 46.9 billion in 1997.
The ECU Clearing and Settlement System
(ECU 3) functioned quite smoothly during
1997, on average completing settlement
earlier in the day than in 1996. Settlement
delays occurred on only a handful of days,
caused by either technical problems localised

72

at only one or a few clearing banks or
system incidents affecting the network used
by the ECU Clearing and Settlement System.
Two new software releases, which were
implemented by S.W.I.F.T. in July and
September 1997, have now brought the
system back to the required service level,
and no network incidents have been
recorded since.
In 1997 some enhancements to the
activation of the emergency liquidity facilities
were introduced to ECU 3, i.e. the system
providing for binding intraday limits. In
addition, the clearing rules were amended
to allow for the orderly completion of
clearing should a clearing bank be unable
to send its authenticated settlement message
for purely technical reasons.
As part of their oversight functions the EMI
and the NCBs studied a proposal put
forward by the Exchange Clearing House
Organisation (ECHO) - to net contracts
denominated in ECU and to settle the
relevant flows through the ECU Clearing
and Settlement System - and no objection
was raised to ECHO commencing operation
in ECUs. In Stage Three ECHO is expected
to settle its euro operations via TARGET.

1.2 Preparatory work for Stage
Three of EMU
The EBA is in the process of defining the
legal structure and the liquidity and losssharing arrangements for EURO 1. In
addition, the EBA - in co-operation with
the EMI and the NCBs - is finalising the
settlement arrangements in accordance with
an EMI Council decision. The latter states
that the EBA will open a central settlement
account at the ECB. It may also open other
settlement accounts with those NCBs which
agree to provide such accounts. To date,
only the Banque de France has indicated its

intention to open a local settlement account
for the EBA (by June 1999).
Finally, an arrangement to secure the timely
settlement of EURO 1 in the event of a
participant failing to settle is being elaborated
by the EBA. A cash collateral pool covering
the largest net debit exposure possible in
the system (E 1 billion) would serve this
purpose. In accordance with an EMI Council
decision, the ECB acts as the holder of the
cash collateral pool for the EBA. In addition,
liquidity and loss-sharing arrangements are
being developed by the EBA to deal with
multiple defaults.

Since EURO 1 will be based on the same
technical infrastructure and intraday risk
management features as the current ECU
3, the EMI - in co-operation with the NCBs
- reviewed ECU 3 in order to assess its
compliance with the Lamfalussy standards
as a starting-point for an assessment of the
compliance of EURO 1. Ongoing efforts
being made by the EBA to improve ECU 3
with a view to meeting the Lamfalussy
standards should therefore be seen as
preparation for the introduction of a fully
compliant EURO 1.

73

2 Electronic money
At present, electronic money is not a
widespread phenomenon. However, the
possibility that its development could be
more pronounced in the long run cannot
be ruled out. Since the publication of the
“Report to the Council of the EMI on
Prepaid Cards” in May 1994, not only has
the number of multi-purpose prepaid card
projects greatly increased, but the use of
electronic money for payments via
computer networks (so-called network
money) has also started to develop.

In 1997 the EMI therefore carried out a
further study on the impact on EU
economies of the emergence of electronic
money. It took particular account of new
market developments and conducted a
thorough analysis of their implications for
monetary policy. The results of the study
provided the basis for the “Opinion of the
EMI Council on the issuance of electronic
money” of 2 March 1998, which was
transmitted to the Commission, the text of
which is reproduced in Box 3 below.

Box 3

Opinion of the EMI Council on the issuance of electronic money1
1. At the present juncture, electronic money is not a widespread phenomenon. However, in the long
run a more pronounced development of electronic money cannot be ruled out.
2. The issuance of electronic money is likely to have significant implications for monetary policy in
the future. Therefore, EU central banks regard it as important to establish clear rules on the conditions
under which electronic money can be issued.
3. In 1994 the EMI Council recommended that only credit institutions (according to national law)
should be allowed to issue multi-purpose prepaid cards.2 However, this recommendation was not
implemented in all Member States. Against this background, the European Commission started in
1997 to work on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the issuance of
electronic money by non-credit institutions, in particular with the objective of granting the European
passport to these institutions.
4. In the light of the developments over the past few years and further reflection on the matter, not
least with respect to monetary policy effectiveness and considerations of level playing-field, and
considering that funds collected for issuing electronic money are by nature redeemable, the EMI
Council regards as essential that the following minimum requirements be fulfilled, regardless of
the nature of the issuer of e-money:
- the meaning of “electronic money” must be clearly def ined and distinguished from “singlepurpose” or “limited-purpose” prepaid cards;
- issuers of electronic money must be subject to prudential supervision;
- the issuance must be subject to solid and transparent legal arrangements, technical security,
protection against criminal abuse, and statistics reporting;
- a legal requirement must be imposed that electronic money is redeemable at par, implying that
issuers must be in a position to convert electronic money into central bank money on request of
the holder of the electronic money; 3

74

- the possibility must exist for central banks to impose reserve requirements on all issuers of
electronic money, in particular in order to be prepared for a substantial development of electronic
money with a material impact on monetary policy.
- In addition, an insurance scheme for electronic money schemes could be envisaged as a way to
protect the public.
5. Against this background, and in line with the 1994 recommendation of the EMI, the most
straightforward solution would be to limit the issuance of electronic money to credit institutions,
as this would avoid changing the existing institutional setting for monetary policy and banking
business. More specif ically, with a view to the transition to Monetary Union, the issuance of
electronic money should be limited to “credit institutions as defined in Article 1 of the First Banking
Co-ordination Directive” since Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, in its current wording,
allows the ECB to impose reserve requirements only on these institutions in Stage Three of EMU.
6. At the same time, the EMI Council acknowledges that the definition of “credit institution” of the
First Banking Co-ordination Directive requires an institution to “receive deposits or other repayable
funds from the public and grant credit for its own account”.4 The EMI would see great merit in
pursuing an amendment to the First Banking Co-ordination Directive’s definition of “credit institution”
to allow institutions which are not willing to enter into credit operations to issue electronic money.
This would provide a level playing-field, in particular as it would ensure that all issuers of electronic
money would be subject to an appropriate form of prudential supervision and fall under the range
of institutions potentially subject to ECB reserve requirements.
7. Yet, as a transitional provision until the First Banking Co-ordination Directive is amended, the
EMI Council would accept that those institutions already issuing electronic money, but which do
not fall under the def inition of credit institution in the First Banking Co-ordination Directive,
could continue to provide domestic payment services provided they are subject to the regulations
as defined in item 4 above, excluding, however, reserve requirements. 5
8. Given the world-wide aspects of the issuance of electronic money, in particular network money,
which carries the risk of delocation, the EMI stresses the need for international co-ordination in
this field.

Notes:
The opinion was adopted by a large majority of EMI Council members, with the exception of Denmark, Sweden,
the United Kingdom and Luxembourg.
2
The EMI’s 1994 “Report to the Council of the EMI on Prepaid cards” (p. 8) foresaw the possibility of allowing
some non-fully fledged credit institutions to issue multi-purpose prepaid cards under specific conditions in
exceptional circumstances (e.g. in the case of schemes already in operation before the policy conclusions of the
report were drawn up).
3
The details of such a redeemability requirement have yet to be specified. (To avoid burdensome procedures, one
may, for example, consider imposing a fee or a threshold on minimum amounts before redemption can be
demanded by the holder of the electronic money instrument. In addition, logistical difficulties could possibly be
overcome by allowing for redemption via bank deposits.)
4
The EMI Council also acknowledges the fact that national definitions of “credit institution” differ across Member
States and that in some countries issuers of electronic money currently exist which do not fulfil the respective
national definition of a credit institution.
5
As noted above, an exception was already foreseen in the EMI’s 1994 report on prepaid cards. The exception
was a permanent grandfathering clause for schemes which had already been established at that point in time. It
would be necessary to examine whether such a permanent grandfathering clause could be maintained in a
revised version of the First Banking Co-ordination Directive for such schemes, e.g. if their nature would make the
application of the ensuing banking legislation less sensible.

3 Co-operation in the field of banking supervision and
financial stability
In accordance with Article 109f (2), fourth
indent, of the Treaty, in 1997 the EMI held
consultations on a number of issues falling
within the competence of NCBs and
affecting the stability of financial institutions
and markets. The most important topics
discussed were as follows.

3.1 Performance and stability of the
EU banking systems in the
medium and long term
A survey was conducted on a wide range
of issues of potential relevance to the
stability of the EU banking systems with a
view to increasing the awareness of NCBs
and banking supervisory authorities of both
current trends in the EU banking systems
and developments which are likely to occur
in the medium and long term, both in
general and in relation to the establishment
of EMU. The main findings of the survey are
summarised below.
Although some generalisation is inevitable,
given that the situation may vary within and
across countries, the main trends relating to
the EU banking systems over the past few
years can be identified as follows: (i) a decline
in banks’ profitability; (ii) a narrowing of
interest rate margins; (iii) a rise in non-interest
income; and (iv) a reduction in staff costs and
the number of staff. Although profitability did
indeed increase in 1995 and 1996 in a
number of countries, this does not alter the
basic trend given that it reflects to a large
extent the favourable conditions prevailing
in the capital markets. These trends can
be regarded as the combined effect of
several factors - financial liberalisation,
disintermediation, internationalisation and
technological change - all of which have
emerged in recent years and which are
expected to continue to shape the EU
banking systems in the years to come.

76

Notwithstanding the difficulties associated with
measuring banking capacity, there are a
number of good reasons to assume that
excess banking capacity exists in many EU
countries, although it has been acknowledged
that a reduction in this excess has taken place
over the past few years. Information
technology can be regarded as having been
the main driving force behind recent changes
in capacity in the EU banking systems, both at
the retail and at the wholesale level. This
factor is expected to continue to exert
pressure leading to further reductions in
excess banking capacity, especially in the
retail sector, mainly through the development
of both new distribution channels (“remote
banking”) and electronic money. This potential
development can be expected to affect
principally branch networks and staffing levels.
Over the past few years the phenomenon of
banking disintermediation - which can be
regarded as the movement of services and
functions away from the banking system and
towards other financial or non-financial
intermediaries, economic agents or markets has been very much in evidence. The EU
banking systems, although still growing, have
been losing their relative share of financial
intermediation to institutional investors
(investment funds, insurance companies and
pension funds). Credit institutions have reacted
by establishing their own financial services
groups, either through direct equity
participation in non-bank intermediaries or by
means of agreements with them. Credit
institutions have been able to play a major
role in these financial groups, partly as a result
of their central role in financial transaction
services (money transmission, securities
settlement and administration) and partly
owing to their size and capital strength. The
trend towards disintermediation is expected
to continue in the future since institutional
investors will continue to grow, mainly on
account of demographic and social changes

(such as the ageing of the population and the
increasing number of wealthy individuals in
the EU countries).
With regard to the degree of concentration,
the survey showed that this varied from
country to country and that the situation
reflected both the size of national economies
(with a tendency towards a higher level of
concentration in the smaller countries and
a lower level in the larger ones) and,
possibly, different national strategies. It seems
that the EU banking systems do not currently
suffer from a lack of competition as a result
of concentration and that such competition
is particularly intense in international
wholesale banking and syndicated lending.
In the context of EU competition policy, it
can be argued that disintermediation and
the establishment of the Single Market and
EMU may all be grounds for reconsidering
the definition of relevant markets for the
purpose of merger control. In particular,
disintermediation may lead to a broader
definition from a product perspective and
the establishment of the Single Market and
EMU may widen the geographical definition
of the market. Looking to the future, it is
anticipated that there may be room for
large-scale cross-border mergers given the
relatively low concentration at the EU
level.
EMU is expected to reinforce trends already
prevailing in the EU banking systems. EMU
should increase competition and strengthen
the need to restructure the EU banking
systems, inter alia by means of a reduction
in excess capacity. The ending of foreign
exchange transactions between EMU
currencies and of the related hedging activity
will, of course, have a negative impact on
the earnings of banks. In addition, EMU is
expected to favour the development of
deeper and more liquid securities markets,
which in turn might trigger the further
disintermediation of the banking systems.
This process could be reinforced by the
fact that institutional investors may benefit
from the broader single currency area to

which the existing currency matching rules
will apply. In relation to EMU, credit
institutions are also expected to reconsider
and upgrade their strategies, procedures
and technologies. A three-layer EU banking
system is likely to emerge, in which: (i) the
first layer would be composed of a large
number of small, locally based institutions;
(ii) the second layer would comprise EU
regional players; and (iii) the third layer
would consist of very large EU-wide banks
which consider themselves to be global
players. In general, the overall outlook in
the medium term is that pressure on banks’
profitability is likely to increase with the
establishment of EMU. However, the actual
impact of this pressure will vary from one
credit institution to the next. Nonetheless,
EMU is also expected to bring a number of
advantages which could offset any negative
effects overall. In particular, a more stable
economic environment may stimulate bank
lending and reduce the risk of defaults by
having a positive impact on credit risk,
although there will inevitably be regional
variations in activity which could affect
credit quality differentially. The TARGET
system will make a significant contribution
to the establishment of sound and efficient
payment systems by reducing systemic and
liquidity risks. Credit institutions should also
benefit from deeper and more liquid capital
markets as such a situation will reduce their
risks and facilitate their risk management
activities. In addition, it is likely that EMU
will lead to further harmonisation of the
legal and operational environment in which
credit institutions operate.
The overall conclusion drawn from the
survey findings is that the EU banking
systems are already facing a period of
major change in the form of increased
competition, concentration and restructuring
and that this process is expected to be
further intensified by the establishment of
EMU. Therefore, credit institutions are likely
to face pressure to improve their profitability
and will have to strengthen their respective
competitive positions. For their part,

77

78

supervisory authorities will have to step up
their monitoring activities in order to be in
a position to detect the weaker credit
institutions and to ensure that they take
steps to adapt to the increasing pressure.
The findings of the survey have been made
available to the international supervisory
forums.

Three main categories of macro-prudential
analysis have been described, notably:
(i) regular analysis to evaluate the conditions
in the banking system on a systematic basis;
(ii) development analysis to address structural
aspects from a long-term perspective; and
(iii) event analysis to study specific aspects
which might have an impact on the stability of
the banking system.

3.2 The use of macroeconomic data
in the supervisory process
As a follow-up to the work on supervisory
early warning systems carried out in 1996
(see the EMI’s Annual Report 1996), an
investigation was carried out on the possible
use of macroeconomic data in the supervisory
process and the links between
macroeconomic developments and fragility in
the banking systems both as a whole and at
the level of individual institutions. The main
objective of this exercise was to identify
practical approaches which, through the use
of macroeconomic data normally available to
NCBs, could complement the analytical tools
used by banking supervisors to monitor both
the banking system and individual credit
institutions. In more general terms, this initiative
should be regarded as an attempt to continue
improving the effectiveness of supervisory
activities and the efficient use of resources,
particularly given the costs involved in managing
banking crises.

The second way in which macroeconomic
data can be used in the supervisory process
relates to the potential use of the findings
of macro-prudential analysis in the process
of detecting potentially fragile credit and
financial institutions. In general terms, the
systematic consideration by supervisors of
the outcome of macro-prudential analysis
should enable them to perform their
monitoring activities more effectively. In
particular, supervisors should enhance their
ability: (i) to detect individual institutions
which are under strain; (ii) to prioritise the
various aspects of their monitoring activities;
and (iii) to develop communication with
the management of the institutions.
Furthermore, it is clear that the findings of
macro-prudential analysis might also be
utilised in the context of the more
sophisticated early warning systems adopted
by some banking supervisors. The possibility
of making direct use of macroeconomic
data or variables in the supervisory early
warning process will be further investigated.

There are two ways in which macroeconomic
data could be used in the supervisory process.
The first is based on the conduct of so-called
macro-prudential analysis, which focuses on
the stability of the banking and financial
systems as a whole. This form of analysis
establishes
relationships
between
macroeconomic variables (such as GDP, the
indebtedness of households and enterprises,
the structure of risks in the banking system,
etc.) and aggregated data obtained from
supervisory reporting. The conduct of this
examination normally consists of an assessment
of the current conditions in the banking
system and its possible future development.

Drawing on actual experience, which is for
the time being confined to a limited number
of countries, some organisational
approaches have been explored to
determine practical ways in which macroprudential analysis could be conducted at
the national level, with a view to promoting
the more widespread performance of this
activity. This work suggests that it would be
useful to conduct macro-prudential analysis
at the EU level. The findings of the analysis
relating to the possible use of
macroeconomic data in the supervisory
process have been made available to the
international supervisory forums.

3.3 Other issues
First, specific attention has been devoted to
recent developments which have taken
place in industry-wide practice for the
provisioning for bad and doubtful loans.
This was a follow-up to previous work
conducted on the subject (see the EMI’s
Annual Report 1996) and focused on new
approaches to provisioning which credit
institutions have started to use and which
are based on statistical methods. In
particular, whereas traditional provisioning
methods are based on an item-by-item
evaluation and provisions are made on the
basis of a reduction in the value of the
assets when tangible signals are detected,
the new methods use a statistical approach
to estimate the expected credit losses and
the corresponding loss provisions are posted
as a liability (if the actual loss is greater than
expected the difference is charged to the
loss provision). The main impact of this
approach is that it can smooth the effects
of credit losses on credit institutions’ profits
over the economic cycle. The survey on
the new approaches showed that, for the
time being at least, they are not widely
used by EU credit institutions. One reason
for this is that EU accounting legislation
requires that provisions be made by means
of reducing the value of the assets on the
basis of an item-by-item evaluation.
Nonetheless, in some non-EU countries
(Canada, Switzerland and the United States)
the use of the new methodologies is or
may become more common, not least
because it is in some cases endorsed by the
supervisory authorities. It is likely that the
new approaches will be addressed within
the relevant international supervisory forums
in the context of discussions on prudential
supervisory capital. The findings of the
survey have been made available to the
international supervisory forums.
Furthermore, the possible future
development of the current EU prudential
supervisory regime for credit institutions’
liquidity and the possible impact of the

establishment of EMU have been addressed.
The prudential supervisory regime is based
on the following two elements: (i) the
prudential rules governing credit institutions’
liquidity as laid down in the Member States
are not harmonised; and (ii) responsibility
for supervising the liquidity position of
foreign branches set up in the EU remains
with the host supervisor, in co-operation
with the home supervisor, in accordance
with Article 14 (2) of the Second Banking
Co-ordination Directive. The current trend
towards the centralised management of
liquidity by credit institutions - which is
expected to be reinforced by the
introduction of the single currency - and
the need to maintain a fully effective
supervisory function have both been
identified as possible factors which might
necessitate the revision of the current
regime and, in particular, a shift in
responsibility for foreign branches’ liquidity
from the host to the home supervisor. The
findings of this examination were brought
to the attention of the European
Commission, which is competent to assess,
with the assistance of the Banking Advisory
Committee, the need to amend current EU
banking legislation. The issue will have to be
reassessed in the light of experience gained
following the introduction of the euro and
the single monetary policy and their actual
impact on the liquidity management of
credit institutions.
Finally, in 1997 co-operation continued
among the credit registers operating in
seven EU countries (Belgium, Germany,
Spain, France, Italy, Austria and Portugal)
and managed by NCBs, the main purpose
of which is to record information on the
overall degree of indebtedness of borrowers
with a view to assisting credit and financial
institutions in managing their credit risk. The
main objective of this co-operation remains
the opening-up of the registers on a crossborder basis in order to grant access to the
information stored in all the EU registers to
reporting institutions established in the EU
Member States. The achievement of this

79

objective is deemed to be essential in order
to maintain the effectiveness of the registers
in an environment characterised by the
further integration of the EU banking and
financial markets, which is also expected to
be reinforced by the establishment of EMU.
At this stage, the opening-up of the registers
is already possible in four cases, whereas
there are still legal obstacles to the opening-

80

up of the remaining three registers. The
NCBs concerned remain committed to
promoting the adoption of the legislative
amendments and/or administrative measures
necessary to lift these obstacles. Meanwhile,
co-operation has focused on identifying the
main features of the future exchange of
information among the registers.

4 Administration of EMS mechanisms and Community
loans
The EMI’s operational tasks relate to the
administration of the mechanisms of the
European Monetary System (EMS) - the Very
Short-Term Financing mechanism (VSTF), the
Short-Term Monetary Support mechanism
and the creation of ECUs for the purpose of
implementing the EMS Agreement - and the
administration of borrowing and lending
operations concluded by the Community
under the Medium-Term Financial Assistance
mechanism.

4.1 EMS mechanisms
The EMI carries out operations associated
with the creation, utilisation and remuneration
of official ECUs. Official ECUs are issued to
EU central banks against the contribution of
20% of their gross gold holdings and US dollar
reserves through revolving swaps.
Contributions are compulsory for the EU
central banks participating in the ERM and
voluntary for EU central banks not participating
in the ERM. The swap operations are renewed
every three months, which allows for the
necessary adjustments to be made in order
to: first, ensure that each EU central bank’s
contribution to the EMI continues to represent
at least 20% of its gold and US dollar reserve
holdings at the end of the month preceding
the renewal date; and, second, take account
of changes in the price of gold and in the US
dollar exchange rate vis-à-vis the official ECU.
The results of these operations are shown in
the Annual Accounts towards the end of this
Report.
Greece joined the ERM with effect from 16
March 1998, which entailed compulsory
participation in the ECU swap mechanism
from that date. Since the Bank of Greece
had been participating in the mechanism on
a voluntary basis since January 1986, ERM
membership had no implications for the
EMI’s ECU swap operations.

The amount of official ECUs issued by the EMI
under the latest three-month swap transaction,
which took place on 12 January 1998, reached
ECU 62.9 billion. Compared with January
1997, the stock of ECUs increased by ECU
2.7 billion. The increase was mainly due to:
first, an appreciation of the US dollar against
the ECU; and, second, an increase in the total
volume of US dollar reserve contributions
from the EU central banks participating in
ECU swap operations with the EMI. The
increase was partially offset by a fall in the gold
price and a decrease in the total volume of
gold contributions.
In addition to the creation of official ECUs,
the EMI records in its books transfers of
ECUs among the participating central banks
and Other Holders. In 1997 no transfers
took place between participating central
banks. Transfers between participating
central banks and Other Holders resulted
in net ECU positions of ECU 63.5 million,
unchanged from the situation in 1996. This
balance reflects the acquisition of ECUs by
the Swiss National Bank through swap
operations with two EU central banks
during the period under review. The ECU
mobilisation mechanism has not been
activated since 1986. No use was made of
the VSTF in 1997, nor of the Short-Term
Monetary Support mechanism. The latter
has not been activated since 1974.

4.2 Community loans
In accordance with Article 109f (2) of the
Treaty and Article 11 of Council Regulation
(EEC) No. 1969/88 of 24 June 1988, the
EMI administers the borrowing and lending
operations concluded by the Community
under the Medium-Term Financial
Assistance mechanism. The mechanism
provides for loans to be granted to Member
States which are experiencing or are

81

seriously threatened by difficulties in their
balance of payments (current or capital
account). The EMI effects payments arising
from these borrowing and lending
operations. It verifies the maturity dates laid
down in the borrowing and lending
contracts for the payment of interest and
repayment of the principal and reports to
the Commission on the operations carried
out for the account of the EU.

In 1997 the EMI continued to receive from
borrowers, namely Greece and Italy, and
to pay to creditors vis-à-vis the Community
the sums due in respect of interest,
commission and expenses on outstanding
loans. The following table shows the total
of outstanding Community lending
operations as at 31 December 1996 and
1997.

5 Advisory functions
Article 109f (6) of the Treaty and Article 5.3
of the EMI Statute require that the EMI be
consulted by the Council of the European
Union or the responsible national authorities,
as appropriate, on any proposed Community
or national legislation within its field of
competence. The limits and conditions of
consultations on draft legislation by national
authorities are set out in Council Decision 93/
717/EEC of 22 November 1993. Article 1 of
this Decision states that “Member States shall
consult the EMI on any draft legislative
provisions within its field of competence
pursuant to Article 109f of the Treaty and in
particular on:
currency legislation, the status of the
euro and means of payment;
the status and powers of national
central banks and the instruments of
monetary policy;
Table 8

the collection, compilation and
dissemination of monetary, financial,
banking and balance of payments
statistics;
clearing and payment systems, in
particular for cross-border transactions;
rules applicable to financial institutions,
insofar as they influence the stability of
financial institutions and markets”.
Fifty-two requests for the EMI’s opinion were
received in 1997 and the first quarter of 1998.
Eleven requests concerned proposed
Community legal acts and forty-one
concerned national draft legislative provisions
falling within the EMI’s field of competence.
The consultations concerning the adaptation
of the statutes of NCBs to meet the
requirements of the Treaty were particularly
relevant. The table below summarises the
consultation procedures in which the EMI
delivered opinions in 1997 and the first
quarter of 1998.

The EMI’s benchmark for the assessment
of the proposed legislation was primarily its
compatibility with the Treaty, while the
potential impact on future arrangements
for Stage Three of EMU and, as appropriate,

the question as to whether the stability of
financial institutions and markets would be
affected by the legislation were also
examined.

85

6 Monitoring of compliance with the prohibition on
monetary financing and on privileged access
In 1997 the EMI continued to monitor
NCBs’ fulfilment of their obligations under
Articles 104 and 104a of the Treaty and
Council Regulations (EC) Nos. 3603/93 and
3604/93. 14 The European Commission
monitors Member States’ compliance with
these provisions.
In 1997 the EU NCBs continued to respect
the Treaty requirements. Remaining
imperfections which had appeared in the
transition to the new arrangements, as well
as technical problems which had occurred

in the implementation of new regulations,
were finally corrected at the beginning
of 1997.
The EMI also monitors NCBs’ secondary
market purchases of public sector debt
instruments. The acquisition of debt
instruments of the public sector in the
secondary market - which, according to
Council Regulation (EC) No. 3603/93, must
not be used to circumvent the objective of
Article 104 - is in general in compliance
with the Treaty.

framework of this topic see the EMI’s Annual
Report 1994, Chapter III B.

7 Co-operation with other institutions
The EMI has continued its close co-operation
with other bodies of the European Union in a
number of forms and at various levels. The
President of the EU Council and a member of
the European Commission have participated
in meetings of the EMI Council, and the
President of the EMI has attended meetings of
the EU Council whenever matters relating to
the objectives and tasks of the EMI have been
discussed. This has included his attendance at
informal ECOFIN Council meetings, where
issues related to the irrevocable fixing of
conversion rates, the organisation of the EU
Council’s dialogue with the ECB and the role
of the ESCB in the implementation of Article 109
of the Treaty were discussed. In June 1997 the
President appeared before the European
Parliament to present the EMI’s Annual Report
1996 to a plenary session and to answer
questions related both to the monetary,
economic and financial conditions in the Union
and to the activities of the EMI, focusing in
particular on the progress made by the EMI in
fulfilling its statutory obligation to undertake the
preparatory work necessary for Stage Three
of EMU. The main challenges facing the EMI in
the run-up to Stage Three of EMU and, in
particular, the technical preparations necessary
for the timely establishment of the ESCB were
the key issues discussed when the President
appeared before the Sub-Committee on
Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
in October 1997. The same topics were on
the agenda when the President held an
exchange of views with members of the
Economic and Social Committee of the
European Communities in November.
At the working level, senior representatives
of the EMI have regularly attended the
meetings of the Monetary Committee as
observers. Close working relationships have
been maintained with the competent
Directorates General of the European
Commission, representatives of which also
attend meetings of some EMI working groups.
In the field of prudential supervision, an
agreement was reached between the EMI

and the European Commission in order to
strengthen co-operation between the two
institutions. According to this agreement, the
EMI participates as an observer in the meetings
of the Banking Advisory Committee, which
assists the Commission in, inter alia, drawing
up proposals for new Community banking
legislation, while a representative of Directorate
General XV takes part in the meetings of the
EMI’s Banking Supervisory Sub-Committee.
In the field of statistics the EMI has further
enhanced its procedures for co-operation
with EUROSTAT (the European Commission’s
statistical office) and is represented by three
members in the Committee on Monetary,
Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics.
Furthermore, the EMI has continued to cooperate with the national Mint Directors
representing the institutions which will be
responsible for producing the euro coins
which will circulate alongside the euro
banknotes as from 1 January 2002.
With regard to contacts with institutions
outside the Community, the “concertation
procedure” has remained a valuable forum
for exchanging data among foreign exchange
experts from central banks in the EU and
those in Canada, Japan, Norway, Switzerland
and the United States on exchange market
developments, intervention and other official
foreign exchange transactions. Consultations
on matters of common interest between the
EMI and the central banks of Norway, Iceland
and Switzerland have taken place. Important
links have also been retained with the Bank
for International Settlements (BIS). The IMF
has paid several visits to the EMI in the
context of its regional surveillance activity and
in order to exchange views on the future
relationship between the ESCB and the IMF.
The EMI also took part in meetings of the
OECD Working Party No. 3. Furthermore,
the EMI maintained its contact with the
central banks of the associated Central and
Eastern European countries (CEECs) and
other applicant countries.

1. Accounting Policies
1.1 The annual accounts were drawn up
in accordance with accounting principles
established by the Council of the EMI
pursuant to Article 17.3 of its Statute, and
are expressed in official ECUs.
1.2 Although the EMI, as a body of the
European Communities, is not subject to
national laws and regulations on accounting
practices, its accounting policies follow
internationally accepted accounting
principles, unless specific EMI issues require
otherwise.
1.3 Notwithstanding the limited life of
the EMI, the accounts have been prepared
on a “going concern” basis. When the EMI
goes into liquidation on the establishment
of the ECB, all of its assets and liabilities will
automatically pass to the latter, which will
then liquidate the EMI in accordance with
the provisions of Article 23 of the Statute
of the EMI.
1.4 EMS-related assets and liabilities are
shown at cost. Short-term discount securities
are shown at cost plus accrued interest.
Securities, other than short-term discount
securities and financial fixed assets, are
shown at year-end market value. Financial
fixed assets are shown at acquisition cost
less any provision for a permanent diminution
in value. All other financial assets and
liabilities are shown at nominal value.
1.5 Tangible assets are valued at cost less
depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on
a straight-line basis, beginning in the quarter

after acquisition, over the expected
economic lifetime of an asset, namely:
Equipment, furniture
and plant in building

10 years

Computers, related
hardware, software
and vehicles

4 years

1.6 Apart from EMS-related assets and
liabilities and financial fixed assets, foreign
currency translation of balance sheet items
into ECUs is based on the official rates
published by the European Commission
applying at 31 December 1997, or otherwise
on closing market rates for that date.
Foreign currency transactions reflected in
the Profit and Loss Account are valued at
the average of daily official rates for the
year 1997. Translation of financial fixed
assets denominated in foreign currencies is
at the spot rates of exchange ruling on the
dates of their acquisition.
1.7 Income and expenses are recognised
on an accruals basis. Unrealised gains arising
from the revaluation of assets vis-à-vis the
purchase price are not recognised as income
but taken into a revaluation account; unrealised
losses are charged against previous unrealised
gains in the revaluation account and any
remaining losses are charged against profit.
1.8 In accordance with Article 17.4 of
the Statute, the Council has appointed
C & L Deutsche Revision as independent
external auditors.

93

2. Notes on the Balance Sheet
2.1 EMS-related assets and liabilities
These items relate to the three-month
revolving swaps of official ECUs created in
exchange for EU central banks’
contributions to the EMI of 20% of their
gold and US dollar reserves. These
operations are described in Chapter III,
Section 4, of the Report. The respective
assets and liabilities are shown in the EMI’s
books. The entries do not imply any interest
payments or receipts by the EMI. Interest
on official reserves swapped for ECUs
continues to accrue to the underlying
owners. Interest on ECU holdings arising
out of swaps only becomes due where a
central bank’s holdings exceed its forward
ECU liabilities; in such cases, payments are
covered by interest due from central banks
whose forward liabilities in ECUs exceed
their holdings of ECUs.

necessary to cover the EMI’s administrative
expenses. These deposits, which constituted
a financial fixed asset of the EMI, matured
on 30 December 1997. The proceeds
were credited to a two-day notice interestbearing account pending their reinvestment
in the first week of January 1998.

depreciation of ECU 7.8 million these

2.2 Other assets
Other

II (1) Cash and bank sight accounts: Working
cash balances were held on a current
account in Deutsche Mark, in which
currency almost all of the EMI’s day-to-day
transactions are payable. This account was
used exclusively to deal with payments and
receipts relating to the day-to-day
administration of the EMI. Other cash
balances were held on a one-day notice
interest-bearing account in Deutsche Mark
or were invested from time to time in
Treasury bills of the Federal Republic of
Germany. No such securities were held as
at 31 December 1997.
II (2) Time deposits: As stated in the Annual
Report for 1996, ECU 597.2 million of the
resources contributed by the EU central
banks pursuant to Article 16.2 of the
Statute of the EMI was placed in time
deposits in January 1995 at a fixed term of
three years to generate the income deemed

94

Total

“Special installations” comprises the costs of
special additions and enhancements to the
standard fittings and capital plant and
equipment within the EMI’s premises in the
Eurotower building in Frankfurt am Main
required to meet its particular operational
needs. Following agreement of the final
amounts due to the contractors from the
EMI for the work carried out in respect of
these special installations in 1994 and 1995,
for which provisions had been made, the
book value of this item was revised
downwards by ECU 0.7 million. The
corresponding provisions were released
(see Note 3.3). There were significant
increases in the asset value of plant in
building and computers and software as the
installation of ECB and ESCB systems started
during the latter part of the year.

II (4) Other assets: This item principally
includes a claim against the German Federal
Ministry of Finance in respect of recoverable
value added and other indirect taxes paid on
goods and services. Such taxes are refundable
under the terms of Article 3 of the Protocol
on the Privileges and Immunities of the
European Communities, which also applies to
the EMI by virtue of Article 21 of its Statute.

2.3 Other liabilities
II (1) Creditors and other liabilities: This item
principally comprises payments due to
suppliers, together with income tax
deducted at source from salaries pending
payover to the European Communities,
and accumulated pension contributions with
interest thereon repayable to staff. Members
of the staff contribute to the pension
scheme a percentage of their basic salary
(matched by a contribution of twice that
amount by the EMI - see II (2) below); the
staff contribution is repayable at the
termination of the employment contract
together with accrued interest thereon.
II (2) Provision for pensions and similar
obligations: This item comprises the
accumulated contributions of the EMI
towards the staff pension scheme. These
contributions are required to cover the
eventual cost of severance grants and any
ill-health pensions.
II (3) Other provisions: These comprise funds
set aside in respect of work carried out by

end-1997 on several major infrastructural
projects currently still in progress for the
ECB and ESCB, the restoration of the EMI’s
premises at the end of its lease, office rental
and service charge payments outstanding in
respect of 1997, and the production of the
Annual Report and the accounts for 1997.
II (4) Contributions from EU central banks:
These represent the contributions made
pursuant to Article 16.2 of the Statute by
the EU central banks, as detailed below:

3.1 Income
Interest income: This item represents interest
of ECU 42.3 million earned on the time
deposits and of ECU 1.1 million from
investment of cash balances (see Notes
under “Other assets”).

Other administrative expenses: These cover
all other current expenses, viz. rents,
maintenance of premises and equipment,
goods and equipment of a non-capital
nature, professional fees, and other services
and supplies, together with the expenses
involved in the recruitment, relocation,
installation and resettlement of staff.

3.2 Expenses
3.3 Extraordinary income
Staff costs: This item relates to salaries and
allowances (ECU 21.3 million), and to
employer’s contributions to pensions and
health and accident insurance (ECU 3.6
million), in respect of staff employed by the
EMI. Salaries and allowances of staff, including
emoluments of holders of senior
management positions, are modelled in
essence on, and are comparable to, the
remuneration scheme of the European
Communities.

The average number of permanent staff

permanent staff were recruited and 18 staff
ceased to be employed.

96

This item represents extraordinary income
arising mainly from the release of provisions
made in previous years in respect of
anticipated expenditure arising in those
years that are no longer required.

3.4 Valuation loss
The depreciation of the Deutsche Mark
against the ECU during 1997 resulted in an
unrealised loss in the net value of assets
held or denominated in Deutsche Mark. In
the absence of a revaluation reserve, the
full amount of this loss has been charged
against profit.

3.5 Allocation of deficit
Pursuant to Article 17.6 of the Statute of
the EMI, the deficit has been offset against
the general reserve fund of the EMI.

President and Council
of the European Monetary Institute
Frankfurt am Main

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the European Monetary
Institute. The Management of the European Monetary Institute is responsible for the
preparation of the accounts. It is our responsibility to form an independent opinion on
these accounts based on our audit, and to report our opinion to you.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Auditing. An audit
includes examinations, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures
in the accounts. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the European Monetary Institute’s circumstances and adequately disclosed.
In our opinion, the financial statements, which have been prepared under accounting
policies set out in Section 1 of the notes on the accounts of the European Monetary
Institute, give a true and fair view of the financial position of the European Monetary
Institute at 31 December 1997 and the results of its operations for the year then ended.

Excerpts from the Convergence Report (March 1998)
1 Convergence criteria
The criterion on price stability
Focusing on the performance of individual
countries, over the twelve-month reference
period ending January 1998 fourteen
Member States (Belgium, Denmark,
Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria,
Portugal, Finland, Sweden and the United
Kingdom) had average HICP inflation rates
of below the reference value. This reference
value was calculated by using the
unweighted arithmetic average of the rate
of HICP inflation in the three countries with
the lowest inflation rates, plus 1.5 percentage
points. These three countries’ inflation rates
were 1.1% for Austria, 1.2% for France and
1.2% for Ireland, and, adding 1.5 percentage
points to the average of 1.2%, the reference
value is 2.7%. HICP inflation in Greece was
5.2%, considerably lower than in previous
years, but still well above the reference
value (see Table 5).
Looking back over the period from 1990 to
1997, the convergence of inflation rates
can be explained by a variety of common
factors. In the first place, as is indicated for
each individual Member State, it reflects a
number of important policy choices, most
notably the orientation of monetary policy
towards price stability and the increasing
support received from other policy areas,
such as fiscal policies and the development
of wages and unit labour costs. In addition,
in most Member States the macroeconomic
environment, in particular during the period
following the cyclical downturn of 1993,
has contributed to the easing of upward
pressure on prices. Finally, in many Member
States broadly stable exchange rates and
subdued import price developments have
helped to dampen inflation. At the level of
individual countries, it is apparent that a
group of Member States recorded relatively

100

similar inflation rates for most of the 1990s,
while several others made particularly rapid
progress in 1996-97. Among the latter,
annual CPI inflation in Spain, Italy and
Portugal fell from 4-5½% in 1995 to around
2% in 1997. These three Member States
have had twelve-month average HICP
inflation rates of below the reference value
since mid-1997. In Greece, HICP inflation
fell from 7.9% in 1996 to 5.4% in 1997,
while remaining considerably above the
reference value.
Looking ahead to the near future, in most
countries recent trends and forecasts for
inflation tend to indicate that there is little
or no sign of immediate upward pressure
on inflation. The risks for price stability are
often associated with a narrowing of the
output gap, a tightening of labour market
conditions and increases in administered
prices or indirect taxes; in several countries,
for the most part those which are further
ahead in the current cyclical upturn, the
rate of inflation is generally forecast to rise
to somewhat above 2% during the period
1998-99. This applies to Denmark, Spain,
Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Finland
and the United Kingdom. These Member
States need to exercise firm control over
domestic price pressures with regard to,
inter alia, wage and unit labour costs.
Support is also required from fiscal policies,
which need to react flexibly to the domestic
price environment.

The criterion on the government budgetary
position
With regard to the performance of individual
Member States in 1997, three countries
have recorded fiscal surpluses (Denmark,
Ireland and Luxembourg) and eleven
Member States have achieved or maintained
deficits at or below the 3% reference value
specified in the Treaty (Belgium, Germany,

Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria,
Portugal, Finland, Sweden and the United
Kingdom). Only Greece recorded a deficit
of 4.0%, which is still above the reference
value. For 1998, fiscal surpluses or further
reductions in deficit ratios are projected by
the Commission for nearly all Member
States. The Greek deficit is expected to fall
to 2.2% of GDP (see Table 5).
As regards government debt, in the three
Member States with debt-to-GDP ratios of
above 100%, debt has continued to decline in
relation to GDP. In Belgium the debt ratio in
1997 was 122.2%, i.e. 13.0 percentage points
lower than the peak in 1993; in Greece the
debt ratio in 1997 stood at 108.7%, i.e. 2.9
percentage points below the latest peak in
1996; and in Italy the debt ratio was 121.6%,
i.e. 3.3 percentage points below the peak of
1994. In the seven countries which in 1996
had debt ratios significantly above 60% but
below 80% of GDP, debt ratios also declined.
This was particularly the case in Denmark,
Ireland and the Netherlands, where debt
ratios in 1997 were 16.5, 30.0 and 9.1
percentage points respectively below their
peak levels of 1993, and stood at 65.1%,
66.3% and 72.1% of GDP respectively; in
Spain the debt ratio in 1997 declined by 1.3
percentage points from its peak level of 1996
to reach 68.8% of GDP; in Austria the
corresponding reduction amounted to 3.4
percentage points, taking the debt ratio to
66.1% of GDP. In Portugal the debt ratio was
3.9 percentage points below its 1995 level,
bringing the debt ratio to 62.0% of GDP.
Finally, in Sweden the debt ratio was 2.4
percentage points below its peak level of
1994, reaching 76.6% of GDP in 1997. In
Germany, which in 1996 had a debt ratio of
just above the 60% reference value, the debt
ratio continued its upward trend and in 1997
was 19.8 percentage points higher than in
1991, standing at 61.3% of GDP. In 1997 four
countries continued to have debt ratios of
below the 60% reference value (France,
Luxembourg, Finland and the United
Kingdom). In France the debt ratio continued

its upward trend to reach 58.0% of GDP in
1997 (see Table 5).
For 1998 further reductions in debt-toGDP ratios are projected by the Commission
for all Member States which had debt ratios
of above 60% in 1997. In the cases of
Denmark, Ireland and Portugal, a reduction
to a level at or below the reference value is
forecast. As regards countries with debt
ratios of 50-60% of GDP in 1997, Finland
and the United Kingdom are anticipated to
reduce their debt ratios further below 60%,
whereas in France the debt ratio is expected
to increase marginally.
Overall, progress in reducing fiscal deficit
and debt ratios has generally accelerated.
However, (...) in a number of Member
States measures with a temporary effect
have played a role in reducing deficits. On
the basis of the evidence available to the
EMI, the effects of such measures have
been quantified at between 0.1 and
1 percentage point, with the level varying
by country. To the extent that evidence is
available, the magnitude of temporary
measures in 1998 budgets has generally
been reduced; in addition, as mentioned
above, forecasts for 1998 suggest in most
cases a further decline in deficit ratios.
Reductions in debt ratios have benefited in
part from a number of financial operations
and transactions, such as privatisation, which
are reflected in the so-called “stock-flow
adjustment” item (...). Such transactions are
expected to continue to play a role in
several Member States.
Notwithstanding recent achievements,
further substantial consolidation is warranted
in most Member States in order to achieve
lasting compliance with the fiscal criteria
and the medium-term objective of having a
budgetary position that is close to balance
or in surplus, as required by the Stability
and Growth Pact, effective from 1999
onwards. This applies in particular to
Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France,
Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and Portugal,

101

where deficits in 1998 are forecast to be
between 1.6 and 2.9% of GDP. For most of
these countries, these consolidation
requirements also apply when comparing
the fiscal deficit ratios as projected in the
Convergence Programmes for 1999-2000
with the medium-term objective of the
Stability and Growth Pact.
Taking a broader view on the sustainability
of fiscal developments, the case for sustained
consolidation over an extended period of
time, requiring substantial fiscal surpluses, is
particularly strong for those countries with
debt ratios of above 100% (Belgium, Greece
and Italy). This compares with significant
overall deficits in 1997 and the years before.
In countries with debt ratios of significantly
above 60% but below 80% of GDP, keeping
the deficit ratio at current levels would not
bring down the debt ratio to below 60%
within an appropriate period of time, which
indicates the need for further, in some
cases substantial, consolidation. Instead,
realising the fiscal positions forecast for
1998 by the European Commission and
maintaining a balanced budget from 1999
onwards would reduce the debt ratio to
below 60% over appropriate periods (Spain,
the Netherlands and Austria). Sweden could
achieve the same result by realising the
surplus position forecast for 1998 and
maintaining it for several years thereafter.
In Germany the debt ratio is forecast to be
just above 60% of GDP in 1998, which
could allow it to be reduced to below the
reference value as early as 1999 if balanced
budgets were achieved in that year. In
Denmark, Ireland and Portugal current and
forecast fiscal balances would allow the
debt ratio to be reduced to a level equal to
or just below 60% as early as 1998. Finally,
in France, where the debt ratio is just
below 60% of GDP, complying with the
Stability and Growth Pact from 1999
onwards would also ensure that the debt
ratio does not exceed the reference value.

on national budgets of transfers to and
from the EC budget is not taken into
account by the EMI.

The exchange rate criterion
During the two-year reference period from
March 1996 to February 1998 ten currencies
(the Belgian/Luxembourg franc, the Danish
krone, the Deutsche Mark, the Spanish
peseta, the French franc, the Irish pound,
the Dutch guilder, the Austrian schilling and
the Portuguese escudo) have been
participating in the ERM for at least two
years before this examination, as stated by
the Treaty. The periods of membership for
the Finnish markka and the Italian lira were
shorter, as these currencies joined and
rejoined the exchange rate mechanism in
October 1996 and November 1996
respectively. Three currencies remained
outside the ERM during the reference
period referred to in this Report, namely
the Greek drachma15 , the Swedish krona
and the pound sterling.
Each of the ten ERM currencies mentioned
above, with the exception of the Irish
pound, has normally traded close to its
unchanged central rates against other ERM
currencies, and some currencies (the
Belgian/Luxembourg franc, the Deutsche
Mark, the Dutch guilder and the Austrian
schilling) virtually moved as a bloc. On
occasion, several currencies traded outside
a range close to their central rates.
However, the maximum deviation, on the
basis of 10 business day moving averages,
was limited to 3.5%, abstracting from the
development of the Irish pound. In addition,
the deviations were only temporary and
mainly reflected transient movements of
the Spanish peseta and the French franc (in
early 1996), the Portuguese escudo (at
end-1996/early 1997) as well as the Finnish
15

It should be noted that in assessing budgetary
positions of EU Member States, the impact

exchange rate mechanism of the EMS, effective
from 16 March 1998.

markka (in early and mid-1997) vis-à-vis
other ERM currencies. An examination of
exchange rate volatility and short-term
interest rate differentials suggests the
persistence of relatively calm conditions
throughout the reference period.
The Irish pound has normally traded
significantly above its unchanged central
rates against other ERM currencies; at the
end of the reference period the Irish pound
stood just over 3% above its central rates.16
In parallel, the degree of exchange rate
volatility vis-à-vis the Deutsche Mark
increased until mid-1997 and short-term
interest rate differentials against those EU
countries with the lowest short-term interest
rates widened over the same period. More
recently, the former decreased and the
latter narrowed somewhat while remaining
relatively high.
In the case of the Italian lira, at the
beginning of the reference period, before
rejoining the ERM, it initially experienced a
small and temporary setback in its previous
strengthening trend, reaching a maximum
downward deviation of 7.6% below its
future central rate against one ERM currency
in March 1996. Thereafter, it resumed its
appreciation and tended towards its later
central parities, moving for most of the time
within a narrow range. In the case of the
Finnish markka, also at the beginning of the
reference period, before joining the ERM, it
initially continued its weakening movement
apparent over the previous few months which had interrupted the longer-term
upward movement since 1993 - reaching a
maximum downward deviation of 6.5%
below its future central rate against one
ERM currency in April 1996. Thereafter, it
appreciated and generally traded within a
narrow range around its later central parities.
Since joining and rejoining the ERM in
October and November 1996 respectively,
both the Finnish markka and the Italian lira
have normally traded close to their
unchanged central rates against other ERM
currencies. As was the case for other ERM

currencies, on occasion the Italian lira and
the Finnish markka traded outside a range
close to their central rates, but such
deviations were limited and temporary. In
both cases the relatively high degree of
exchange rate volatility against the Deutsche
Mark observed in earlier periods declined
to low levels over the reference period and
short-term interest rate differentials against
those EU countries with the lowest shortterm interest rates narrowed steadily in the
case of the Italian lira and were insignificant
in the case of the Finnish markka.
The three currencies remaining outside the
ERM, namely the Greek drachma, the
Swedish krona and the pound sterling, have
normally traded above their March 1996
average bilateral exchange rates against
other EU currencies. Short-term interest
rate differentials against those EU countries
with the lowest short-term interest rates
remained wide in Greece, having narrowed
until mid-1997 and widened significantly
since November 1997, whereas they have
narrowed significantly in Sweden. In the
case of the pound sterling the short-term
interest rate differential tended to widen.

The long-term interest rate criterion
Over the twelve-month reference period
ending January 1998, fourteen Member
States (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Spain,
France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland,
Sweden and the United Kingdom) had
average long-term interest rates of below
the reference value. This reference value
was calculated by using the unweighted
arithmetic average of the long-term interest
rates in the three countries with the lowest
rates of HICP inflation, plus 2 percentage
points. These three countries’ long-term
16

(...) the previous bilateral central rates of the Irish
pound against other currencies of the exchange
rate mechanism were revalued by 3%, effective
from 16 March 1998.

103

interest rates were 5.6% for Austria, 5.5%
for France and 6.2% for Ireland, and, adding
2 percentage points to the average of 5.8%,
the reference value is 7.8%. Representative
long-term interest rates in Greece, which
have been comparable with yields in other
countries since June 1997, were 9.8% and
thus stood well above the reference value
(see Table 5).
Looking back over the period from 1990 to
1997, long-term interest rates were broadly
similar in a number of countries when
considered over the period as a whole.
This applies to Belgium, Germany, France,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria.
In Denmark and Ireland long-term rates
were also relatively close to those in the
above-mentioned countries for most of the
period. In Finland and Sweden the process
of yield convergence accelerated from
1994-95 onwards and both countries have
recorded limited differentials since around
1996. In Spain, Italy and Portugal, where
yields were significantly higher for most of
the 1990s, long-term interest rates declined
steeply from 1995 onwards and moved
below the reference value in either late
1996 or early 1997. A significant reduction

was also seen in Greece. In the case of the
United Kingdom, reflecting a different
position in the cycle vis-à-vis continental
European countries, a broad trend has
been observed since the early 1990s of,
first, convergence with, and later divergence
from the long-term interest rates prevailing
in the countries with the lowest bond
yields, although long-term interest rate
differentials have narrowed more recently.
The broad patterns observed in member
countries are closely related to the
developments in inflation rates (see above),
which have facilitated a general reduction in
long-term interest rates and a particularly
marked decline in the case of the formerly
high-yielding currencies. Other factors
underlying this trend were the stability of
exchange rates in most cases and the
improvement in countries’ fiscal positions,
thereby reducing risk premia. These underlying
developments were seen by the markets as
improving the prospects for participation in
Stage Three of EMU - an element which may
in turn have played an independent role in
accelerating the narrowing of yield differentials,
both directly and by further improving the
prospects for price and exchange rate stability.

2 Compatibility of national legislation with the Treaty
2.1 Introduction
Article 108 of the Treaty states that Member
States shall ensure, at the latest at the date
of the establishment of the ESCB, that their
national legislation, including the statutes of
their NCBs, is compatible with the Treaty
and the Statute (“legal convergence”). This
does not require the harmonisation of
NCBs’ statutes, but it implies that national
legislation and statutes of NCBs need to be
adjusted in order to make them compatible
with the Treaty and the Statute. For the
purpose of identifying those areas where
the adaptation of national legislation is

104

necessary, a distinction may be made
between the independence of NCBs, the
legal integration of NCBs in the ESCB and
legislation other than statutes of NCBs.
Compatibility requires that the legislative
process be completed, i.e. that the respective
act has been adopted by the national legislator
and that all further steps, for example
promulgation, have been accomplished. This
applies to all legislation under Article 108.
However, the above distinction between
different areas of legislation is important when
it comes to determining the date on which
legislation must enter into force. Many decisions

which the Governing Council of the ECB and
the NCBs will take between the date of the
ESCB’s establishment and the end of 1998
will predetermine the single monetary policy
and its implementation within the euro area.
Therefore, adaptations which relate to the
independence of an NCB need to become
effective at the latest at the date of the
ESCB’s establishment. Other statutory
requirements relating to the legal integration
of NCBs in the ESCB need only enter into
force at the moment that the integration of
an NCB in the ESCB becomes effective, i.e.
the starting date of Stage Three or, in the
case of a Member State with a derogation or
a special status, the date on which it adopts
the single currency. The entry into force of
adaptations of legislation other than statutes
of NCBs which are required to ensure
compatibility with the Treaty and the Statute
is dependent on the content of such legislation
and therefore needs to be assessed on a
case-by-case basis.

will be essential for the NCBs to be
independent in the performance of their
ESCB-related tasks vis-à-vis external bodies.
The principle of the independence of NCBs
is expressly referred to in Article 107 of the
Treaty and Article 14.2 of the Statute.
Article 107 contains a prohibition on
attempts to influence the ECB, NCBs or
the members of their decision-making
bodies, and Article 14.2 provides for security
of tenure for such members.
The EMI has established a list of features of
central bank independence, distinguishing
between features of an institutional, personal
and financial nature.17
As regards institutional independence, rights
of third parties (e.g. government and
parliament) to:
give instructions to NCBs or their
decision-making bodies;

This Report provides, inter alia, an
assessment on a country-by-country basis
of the compatibility of national legislation
with the Treaty and the Statute.

approve, suspend, annul or defer
decisions of NCBs;
censor an NCB’s decisions on legal grounds;

2.2 Independence of NCBs
Central bank independence is essential for
the credibility of the move to Monetary
Union and, thus, a prerequisite of Monetary
Union. The institutional aspects of Monetary
Union require monetary powers, currently
held by Member States, to be exercised in a
new system, the ESCB. This would not be
acceptable if Member States could influence
the decisions taken by the governing bodies
of the ESCB.
The Statute contemplates an important role
for governors of NCBs (via their membership
of the Governing Council of the ECB) with
regard to the formulation of monetary policy
and for the NCBs with regard to the execution
of the operations of the ESCB (see Article
12.1 of the Statute, last paragraph). Thus, it

participate in the decision-making
bodies of an NCB with a right to vote; or
be consulted (ex ante) on an NCB’s
decisions
are incompatible with the Treaty and/or
the Statute and, thus, require adaptation.
With respect to personal independence,
statutes of NCBs should ensure that:
governors of NCBs have a minimum
term of office of five years;
17

There is also a criterion of functional independence,
but as NCBs will in Stage Three be integrated in the
ESCB, this is being dealt with in the framework of
the legal integration of NCBs in the ESCB (see
paragraph 2.3 below).

105

a governor of an NCB may not be
dismissed for reasons other than those
mentioned in Article 14.2 of the Statute
(i.e. if he/she no longer fulfils the conditions required for the performance of his/
her duties or if he/she has been guilty of
serious misconduct);

prerogatives of the ECB. Thus the EMI’s
assessment of the compatibility of the statutes
of NCBs with the Treaty and the Statute
focuses on the following areas: statutory
objectives, tasks, instruments, organisation,
financial provisions and miscellaneous issues.

other members of the decisionmaking bodies of NCBs involved in the
performance of ESCB-related tasks
have the same security of tenure as
governors;

2.4 Legislation other than the
statutes of NCBs

no conflicts of interest will arise between
the duties of members of the decisionmaking bodies of NCBs vis-à-vis their
respective NCB (and, additionally, of
governors vis-à-vis the ECB) and other
functions which members of the decisionmaking bodies involved in the
performance of ESCB-related tasks may
perform and which may jeopardise their
personal independence.
Financial independence requires that NCBs
can avail themselves of the appropriate
means to fulfil their mandate. Statutory
constraints in this field must be accompanied
by a safeguard clause to ensure that ESCBrelated tasks can be properly fulfilled.

2.3 The legal integration of NCBs in
the ESCB
The full participation of NCBs in the ESCB
necessitates measures in addition to those
designed to ensure independence. In particular,
such measures may be necessary to enable
NCBs to execute tasks as members of the
ESCB and in accordance with decisions taken
by the ECB. The main areas of attention are
those where statutory provisions may form
an obstacle to an NCB complying with the
requirements of the ESCB or to a governor
fulfilling his/her duties as a member of the
Governing Council of the ECB, or where
statutory provisions do not respect the

106

The obligation of legal convergence under
Article 108 of the Treaty, which is incorporated
in a chapter entitled “Monetary Policy”, applies
to those areas of legislation which are affected
by the transition from Stage Two to Stage
Three. The EMI’s assessment of the compatibility
of national legislation with the Treaty and the
Statute focuses in this respect on laws with an
impact on an NCB’s performance of ESCBrelated tasks and laws in the monetary field.
Relevant legislation requiring adaptation is in
particular found in the following areas:
banknotes, coins, foreign reserve management,
exchange rate policy and confidentiality.

2.5 Compatibility of national
legislation with the Treaty and
the Statute
All Member States except Denmark, whose
legislation does not require adaptation, have
introduced, or are in an advanced process of
introducing, changes in the statutes of their
NCBs, following the criteria laid down in the
EMI’s Reports and in the EMI’s opinions. The
United Kingdom, which is exempt from the
obligations under Article 108 of the Treaty, is
in the process of introducing a new statute of
its NCB which, while providing a greater level
of operational central bank independence, is
not expressly intended to achieve the legal
convergence as required by the EMI for full
compliance with the Treaty and the Statute.
Throughout the European Union legislators,
with the above exceptions, have undertaken
a legislative process intended to prepare
NCBs for Stage Three of EMU.

Joint Communiqué on the determination of the irrevocable
conversion rates for the euro, dated 2 May 1998
In accordance with Article 109l (4) of the
Treaty, the irrevocable conversion rates for
the euro will be adopted by the Council,
upon a proposal from the Commission and
after consultation of the European Central
Bank (ECB), on the first day of Stage Three,
i.e. on 1 January 1999.
With a view to guiding markets in the runup to Stage Three, the Ministers of the
Member States adopting the euro as their
single currency, the Governors of the
Central Banks of these Member States, the
European Commission and the European
Monetary Institute (EMI) have agreed on
the method for determining the irrevocable
conversion rates for the euro at the starting
date of Stage Three.
The current ERM bilateral central rates of
the currencies of the Member States which,
on the first day of Stage Three, will adopt
the euro as their single currency, will be
used in determining the irrevocable
conversion rates for the euro. These rates
are consistent with economic fundamentals
and are compatible with sustainable
convergence among the Member States
which will participate in the euro area. The
central banks of the Member States adopting
the euro as their single currency will ensure
through appropriate market techniques that
on 31 December 1998 the market exchange

rates, recorded according to the regular
concertation procedure used for calculating
the daily exchange rates of the official ECU,
are equal to the ERM bilateral central rates
as set forth in the attached parity grid.
The procedure agreed upon by all parties
to this Joint Communiqué will ensure that
the adoption of the irrevocable conversion
rates for the euro will by itself, as required
by Article 109l (4) of the Treaty, not
modify the external value of the ECU,
which will be replaced on a 1:1 basis by the
euro. The attached annex provides detailed
information on this procedure. The final
official ECU exchange rates calculated
accordingly and released on 31 December
1998 will be proposed by the Commission
for adoption by the Council on the first day
of Stage Three, i.e. on 1 January 1999, as
the irrevocable conversion rates for the
euro for the participating currencies.
In compliance with the legal framework for
the use of the euro, once the irrevocable
conversion rate for the euro for each
participating currency has been adopted, it
will be the only rate which will be used for
conversion either way between the euro
and the national currency unit and also for
conversions between national currency
units.

Why can only bilateral rates be announced?

Article 109l (4) of the Treaty provides that
the rates at which the euro will be
substituted for the currencies participating
in the euro area will be adopted at the start
of Stage Three of the Economic and
Monetary Union, i.e. on 1 January 1999.
The adoption of the irrevocable conversion
rates for the euro shall by itself not modify
the external value of the official ECU.
Likewise, Article 2 of the Council Regulation
of 17 June 1997 on certain provisions
relating to the introduction of the euro
stipulates that every reference in a legal
instrument to the official ECU shall be
replaced by a reference to the euro at a
rate of one euro to one ECU. Therefore,
the irrevocable conversion rates for the
euro have to be identical to the value of

2

Since the ECU is a currency basket, which
includes the Danish krone, the Greek
drachma and the pound sterling,18 it is not
possible to announce before the end of
1998 the irrevocable conversion rates at
which the euro shall be substituted for the
participating currencies. However, it is
possible to announce the bilateral rates of
the currencies participating in the euro
area which will be used on
31 December 1998 in computing the
exchange rates of the official ECU and thus
in computing the irrevocable euro
conversion rates for these currencies.

Bilateral rates which will be used in determining the irrevocable
conversion rates for the euro

For currencies participating in the euro area,
the current ERM bilateral central rates will be
used in calculating the final official ECU
exchange rates which will be adopted by the
Council as the irrevocable conversion rates
for the euro on the first day of Stage Three,
i.e. on 1 January 1999. The table attached to

3

the official ECU expressed in units of the
participating currencies on 31 December
1998.

the Joint Communiqué contains those rates.
In order to avoid minor arithmetical
inconsistencies stemming from inverse
calculations, it only includes one bilateral rate
for each pair of currencies, which will be
relevant for the procedure to be followed on
31 December 1998, as described below.

Calculation of the exchange rates of the official ECU
on 31 December 1998

To calculate the exchange rates of the
official ECU on 31 December 1998, the
regular daily concertation procedure will
be used. According to this procedure, the
central banks of the Member States
communicate the representative exchange
rate of their respective currency against the
US dollar.
Three steps can be identified.

Step 1: Determination of the EU currencies’
concertation exchange rates against the US
dollar
At 11.30 a.m. (CET), the EU central banks,
including those with currencies which are
not components of the ECU basket, provide

18

ECU basket currencies of Member States not
participating in the euro area.

109

to each other in the context of a
teleconference, the US dollar exchange
rate for their respective currencies. These
exchange rates are recorded as discrete
values lying within the market bid-ask
spreads. While, as a rule, the discrete
values are equal to the mid-points of the
bid-ask spreads, the EU central banks, as is
allowed by the current concertation
procedure, will take into account the need
to ascertain exchange rates expressed with
six significant digits, like for the preannounced rates. The bilateral rates
between the euro area participating
currencies obtained by crossing 19 the
respective US dollar rates recorded by the
EU central banks will be equal to the preannounced ERM bilateral central rates, up
to the sixth significant digit. The EU central
banks participating in the euro area stand
ready to ensure this equality, if necessary,
through the use of appropriate market
techniques.

Step 2: Calculation of the exchange rate of
the official ECU against the US dollar

These ECU exchange rates are rounded to
the sixth significant digit. Exactly the same
method of calculation, including the rounding
convention, will be used in determining the
irrevocable conversion rates for the euro
for the euro area currencies.
For illustrative purposes, the calculation of
the official ECU exchange rates vis-à-vis all
EU currencies on 31 December 1997 is
shown below.
In compliance with the legal framework for
the use of the euro, once the irrevocable
conversion rate for the euro for each
participating currency has been adopted, it
will be the only rate which will be used for
conversion either way between the euro
and the national currency unit and also for
conversions between national currency
units. Owing to rounding, the implicit bilateral
rates which could be derived from the
euro conversion rates may not always
correspond, up to the last (sixth) significant
figure, to the pre-announced ERM bilateral
central rates referred to in this Joint
Communiqué.

The rates as recorded by the EU central
banks are thereafter communicated by the
National Bank of Belgium to the
Commission, which uses them to calculate
the exchange rates of the official ECU. The
USD/ECU exchange rate (expressed as
1ECU = xUSD) is obtained by summing up
the US dollar equivalents of national
currency amounts that compose the ECU.

Step 3: Calculation of the exchange rates of
the official ECU against the EU currencies
participating in the euro area.
The official ECU exchange rates against the
EU currencies are calculated by multiplying
the USD/ECU exchange rate by their
respective US dollar exchange rates. This
calculation is performed for all EU currencies,
not only the ones which are components
of the ECU basket.

@ The dollar exchange rate for the GBP and IEP is the number of dollars per currency unit rather than the number of currency units
per dollar. Column (c) is therefore calculated for each of these two currencies by multiplying the value in column (a) by that in
column (b); and column (d) by dividing the dollar equivalent of the ECU (i.e. USD/ECU) by the rate in column (b).

There is a difference of one unit (i.e. 1.1042128 instead of 1.1042127) in the last significant figure because the dollar equivalents
of national currency amounts are shown after rounding to the 7th decimal place, whereas an unrestricted number of digits is used

Glossary
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN): an international organisation
established in 1967 which comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
since 1984 Brunei, since 1995 Vietnam and since 1997 Myanmar and Laos. Among the main
aims of ASEAN are the promotion of economic and social development in member countries
and economic co-operation and trade between members of ASEAN.
Bilateral central rate: the official exchange rate between any pair of ERM member
currencies, around which the ERM fluctuation margins are defined.
Central credit register (CCR): information system designed to provide commercial credit
institutions, central banks and other supervisory authorities with data regarding the indebtedness
of firms and individuals vis-à-vis the whole banking system.
Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs): Community terminology used to
refer to those countries of central and eastern Europe with which the European Community has
concluded association treaties. These associated CEECs currently comprise Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia.
In spring 1998 the Community launched the examination of the “acquis communautaire” with all
CEECs while the accession negotiations have been opened only for the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Poland and Slovenia (and Cyprus).
Central securities depository (CSD): an entity which holds securities and which enables
securities transactions to be processed by book entry. Physical securities may be immobilised by
the depository or securities may be dematerialised (i.e. so that they exist only as electronic
records). In addition to safekeeping, a central securities depository may incorporate
comparison, clearing and settlement functions.
Collateral: assets pledged as a guarantee for the repayment of the short-term liquidity loans
which credit institutions receive from the central banks, as well as assets received by central
banks from credit institutions as part of repurchase operations.
Concertation procedure: framework within which central bank foreign exchange experts
(from each EU Member State, Canada, Japan, Norway, Switzerland and the United States)
participating in the Concertation Group exchange information about market developments. The
framework provides for regular daily telephone sessions and periodic meetings of central bank
experts.
Convergence criteria: criteria established in Article 109j (1) of the Treaty (and
developed further in Protocol No. 6). They relate both to economic performance with respect
to price stability, government financial positions, exchange rates and long-term interest rates, as
well as to the compatibility of national legislation, including the statutes of NCBs, with the Treaty
and the ESCB/ECB Statute. The reports produced under Article 109j (1) by the European
Commission and the EMI examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable
convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each Member State of these criteria as well as the
above compatibility.

112

Convergence programmes: medium-term government plans and assumptions regarding
the development of key economic variables towards the achievement of the reference values
indicated in the Treaty. Regarding budgetary positions, measures to consolidate fiscal balances
as well as underlying economic scenarios are highlighted. Convergence programmes normally
cover the next three to four years, but are regularly updated during that time. They are
examined by the European Commission and the Monetary Committee. Their reports
serve as the basis for an assessment by the ECOFIN Council. After the start of Stage Three of
Economic and Monetary Union, Member States with a derogation will continue to submit
convergence programmes, while countries which are members of the euro area will have
annual stability programmes, in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact.
Correspondent banking: arrangement under which one bank provides payment and other
services to another bank. Payments through correspondents are often executed through
reciprocal accounts (so-called nostro and loro accounts), to which standing credit lines may be
attached. Correspondent banking services are primarily provided across international boundaries
but are also known as agency relationships in some domestic contexts. A loro account is the
term used by a correspondent to describe an account held on behalf of a foreign bank; the
foreign bank would in turn regard this account as its nostro account.
Correspondent central banking model (CCBM): a facility for the cross-border use of
collateral in ESCB credit operations. In the CCBM, national central banks would maintain
securities accounts with each other. As a result, NCBs would be able to act as local custodians
for each other.
Council (of the European Union): is made up of representatives of the governments of
the Member States, normally the Ministers responsible for the matters under consideration
(therefore often referred to as the Council of Ministers). The Council meeting in the
composition of the Ministers of Finance and Economy is often referred to as the ECOFIN Council.
In addition, the Council may meet in the composition of the Heads of State or of Government.
See also European Council.
Debt ratio: the subject of one of the fiscal convergence criteria laid down in Treaty
Article 104c (2). It is defined as “the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product at
current market prices”, where government debt is defined in Protocol No. 5 (on the excessive
deficit procedure) as “total gross debt at nominal value outstanding at the end of the year and
consolidated between and within the sectors of general government”.
Deficit ratio: the subject of one of the fiscal convergence criteria named in Treaty
Article 104c (2). Defined as “the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross
domestic product” at current market prices, where the government deficit is defined in Protocol
No. 5 (on the excessive deficit procedure) as “net borrowing of the general government”.
Delivery versus payment system (or DVP, delivery against payment): a mechanism
in a securities settlement system that ensures that the final transfer of one asset occurs if
and only if the final transfer of (an)other asset(s) occurs. Assets could include securities or other
financial instruments.

113

EBA (ECU Banking Association, known as the Euro Banking Association since
December 1997): interbank organisation created in 1985 with the support of European
institutions with the task of achieving three objectives: to promote the use of the ECU in
financial and commercial transactions; to manage and develop the ECU Clearing and Settlement
System and to be a representative body and discussion forum for all matters related to the use
of the ECU. Now developing a successor Euro Clearing and Settlement System to operate in
Stage Three of EMU.
ECB (European Central Bank): the ECB will have legal personality. It will ensure that the
tasks conferred upon the ESCB are implemented either by its own activities pursuant to its
Statute or through the national central banks.
ECB Executive Board: the decision-making body of the ECB which will implement
monetary policy in accordance with the guidelines and decisions laid down by the ECB
Governing Council. It will be composed of the President, the Vice-President and two to four
other members, appointed from among persons of recognised standing and professional
experience in monetary and banking matters by common accord of the governments of the
Member States of the euro area at the level of the Heads of State or of Government, on a
recommendation from the Council after it has consulted the European Parliament and the
ECB Governing Council.
ECB General Council: in addition to the ECB Governing Council and the ECB
Executive Board, the ECB’s third decision-making body. Composed of the ECB’s President,
Vice-President and the governors of all EU national central banks. It will perform the tasks
deriving from the situation in which not all EU Member States participate in the euro area right
from the start.
ECB Governing Council: composed of the members of the ECB Executive Board and
the governors of the national central banks of the countries participating in the euro area; it
will be the supreme decision-making body of the ECB which will adopt the guidelines and take
the decisions necessary to ensure the performance of the tasks entrusted to the ESCB under
the Treaty and the ESCB Statute.
ECOFIN: see Council (of the European Union).
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): the Treaty describes the process of achieving
economic and monetary union in the EU in three stages. Stage One of EMU started in July 1990
and ended on 31 December 1993: it was mainly characterised by the dismantling of all internal
barriers to the free movement of capital within the EU. Stage Two of EMU began on 1 January
1994. It provided, inter alia, for the establishment of the European Monetary Institute, the
prohibition of monetary financing of and privileged access to financial institutions for the public
sector and the avoidance of excessive deficits. Stage Three will start on 1 January 1999, in
accordance with the decision pursuant to Article 109j (4), with the transfer of monetary
competence to the ESCB and the creation of the euro.

114

ECU (European Currency Unit): in its present definition (Council Regulation No. 3320/
94 of 20 December 1994), the ECU is a basket made up of the sum of fixed amounts of twelve
out of the fifteen currencies of the Member States. Article 109g of the Treaty states that this
composition shall not be changed until the start of Stage Three. The value of the ECU is
calculated as a weighted average of the value of its component currencies. As official ECU, it
serves, inter alia, as the numeraire of the ERM and as a reserve asset for central banks. Official
ECUs are created by the EMI through three-month swap operations against one-fifth of the US
dollar and gold assets held by the fifteen EU central banks. Private ECUs are ECU-denominated
financial instruments (e.g. bank deposits or securities) which are based on contracts which, as a
rule, make reference to the official ECU. The “theoretical” value of the private ECU is defined on
the basis of the value of the individual components of the ECU basket. However, the use of the
private ECU is different from that of the official ECU and in practice the market value of the
private ECU may diverge from its “theoretical” basket value. The replacement of the private
ECU by the euro at the rate of one to one is laid down in Article 2 of the Council Regulation
on some provisions relating to the introduction of the euro (see (EC) No. 1103/97 of June
1997).
EEA (European Economic Area) countries: the EU Member States and Iceland,
Liechtenstein and Norway.
Effective (nominal/real) exchange rates: in their nominal version, effective exchange
rates consist of a weighted average of various bilateral exchange rates. Real effective exchange
rates are nominal effective exchange rates deflated by a weighted average of foreign prices or
costs relative to domestic ones. They are thus measures of a country’s price and cost
competitiveness. The choice of currencies and weights reflects the economic issue being
analysed. The most commonly used measures of effective exchange rates employ trade weights.
Electronic money (e-money): an electronic store of monetary value on a technical device
that is used for making payments to undertakings other than the issuing institution without
necessarily involving bank accounts in the transaction, but as a prepaid bearer instrument.
EMS (European Monetary System): established in 1979 in accordance with the
Resolution of the European Council on the establishment of the EMS and related matters of
5 December 1978. The Agreement of 13 March 1979 between the central banks of the
Member States of the European Economic Community lays down the operating procedures for
the EMS. The objective is to create closer monetary policy co-operation between Community
countries leading to a zone of monetary stability in Europe. The main components of the EMS
are: the ECU; the exchange rate and intervention mechanism (ERM); and various credit
mechanisms.
EMU: see Economic and Monetary Union.
ERM (Exchange Rate Mechanism): the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the
EMS defines the exchange rate of participating currencies in terms of a central rate vis-à-vis the
ECU. These central rates are used to establish a grid of bilateral exchange rates between
participating currencies. Exchange rates are allowed to fluctuate around bilateral central
rates within the ERM fluctuation margins. These margins have been set at ±15% since
2 August 1993. Pursuant to a bilateral agreement between Germany and the Netherlands,
fluctuation margins between the Deutsche Mark and the Dutch guilder are maintained at
±2.25%. Adjustments of central rates are subject to mutual agreement between all countries
participating in the ERM (see also realignment).

115

ERM II: successor exchange rate arrangement to the present ERM, which will provide the
framework for exchange rate policy co-operation between the euro area and Member States
not participating in the euro area from the start of Stage Three. Membership will be voluntary;
nevertheless, EU Member States with a derogation can be expected to join the mechanism. The
basic principles and operational features were agreed at the Dublin European Council on
13 and 14 December 1996. A European Council Resolution on the establishment of an
exchange rate mechanism in the third stage of EMU was adopted at the Amsterdam summit on
16 and 17 June 1997, and a draft agreement between the ECB and non-euro area NCBs has
been finalised for adoption by the ECB after its establishment.
ERM fluctuation margins: floor and ceiling of bilateral exchange rates, within which ERM
currencies are allowed to fluctuate.
ESCB (European System of Central Banks): the ESCB is composed of the ECB and the
national central banks of the Member States. Its primary objective is to maintain price stability.
Its basic tasks are to define and implement the monetary policy of the euro area, to hold and
manage the official reserves of the participating Member States and conduct foreign exchange
operations and to promote the smooth operation of payment systems in the euro area. The
ESCB also contributes to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities
relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system.
euro: the name of the European currency adopted by the European Council at its meeting
in Madrid on 15 and 16 December 1995 and used instead of the generic term “ECU” used by
the Treaty to refer to the European Currency Unit.
euro area: area covering those Member States which have adopted the euro as the single
currency in accordance with the Treaty and in which a single monetary policy will be
conducted under the responsibility of the decision-making bodies of the ECB (ECB
Governing Council; ECB General Council; ECB Executive Board).
European Commission: institution of the European Community which ensures the
application of the provisions of the Treaty, takes initiatives for Community policies, proposes
Community legislation and exercises powers in specific areas. In the economic policy area, the
Commission recommends broad guidelines for the economic policies in the Community and
reports to the Council on economic developments and policies. It monitors public finances
and initiates the procedure on excessive deficits. It consists of twenty members and includes
two nationals from Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, and one from each of
the other Member States. EUROSTAT is the Directorate General of the Commission
responsible for the production of Community statistics through the collection and systematic
processing of data, produced mainly by the national authorities within the framework of
comprehensive five-yearly Community statistical programmes.
European Council: provides the European Union with the necessary impetus for its
development and defines the general political guidelines thereof. It brings together the Heads of
State or of Government of the Member States and the President of the European
Commission. See also Council.

116

European Parliament: consists of 626 representatives of the citizens of the Member States.
It is a part of the legislative process, though with different prerogatives according to the
procedures through which EU law is to be enacted. In the framework of EMU, the Parliament
has mainly consultative powers. However, the Treaty establishes certain procedures for
democratic accountability of the ECB to the Parliament (presentation of the annual report,
general debate on the monetary policy, hearings to the competent parliamentary committees).
Fiduciary money: refers to banknotes and coins. These means of payment are termed
“fiduciary” because their value is based on the confidence and trust of the holder in the issuer of
the currency.
Fixed rate tender: a tender procedure where the interest rate is specified in advance by the
central bank and participating counterparties bid the amount of money they want to transact at
the fixed interest rate. See also variable rate tender.
Foreign exchange swap: simultaneous spot and forward transactions of one currency against
another. The ESCB will execute open market monetary policy operations in the form of
foreign exchange swaps where the NCBs (or the ECB) buy (or sell) euro spot against a
foreign currency and at the same time sell (or buy) it back forward. This instrument will also be
used in the management of the ESCB’s foreign reserves.
Funds transfer system (FTS): a formal arrangement, based on private contract or statute
law, with multiple membership, common rules and standardised arrangements for the
transmission and the settlement of money obligations arising between the members.
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP): Protocol No. 6 on the convergence
criteria referred to in Article 109j (1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community
requires price convergence to be measured by means of the consumer price index on a
comparable basis, taking into account differences in national definitions. Although current
consumer price statistics in the Member States are largely based on similar principles, there are
considerable differences of detail and these affect the comparability of the national results. In
order to fulfil the Treaty requirement the European Commission (EUROSTAT), in close
liaison with the National Statistical Institutes and the EMI, has carried out conceptual work on
the harmonisation of consumer price statistics. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices is
the outcome of these efforts.
Harmonised long-term interest rates: Protocol No. 6 on the convergence criteria
referred to in Article 109j (1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community requires
interest rate convergence to be measured by means of interest rates on long-term government
bonds or comparable government securities, taking into account differences in national
definitions. In order to fulfil the Treaty requirement the EMI has carried out conceptual work on
the harmonisation of long-term interest rate statistics and regularly collects the data from
national central banks, on behalf of the European Commission (EUROSTAT). Fully
harmonised data are used in this report.
Interbank funds transfer system (IFTS): a funds transfer system in which most (or
all) participants are credit institutions.

117

Implementation package: in July 1996 the EMI Council approved the “Statistical
requirements for Stage Three of Monetary Union” (the “Implementation package”). This publicly
available working document sets out in detail the statistics which will be required by the ECB in
defining and conducting the single monetary policy. While dealing principally with money and
banking and balance of payments statistics, it also covers other financial statistics, price and cost
and government finance statistics, and background economic statistics.
Interlinking mechanism: one of the components of the architecture of the TARGET
system. The term Interlinking is used to designate the infrastructures and the procedures which
link domestic RTGS systems in order to process cross-border payments within TARGET.
Intervention at the limits: compulsory intervention carried out by central banks, the
currencies of which are respectively at the floor and ceiling of their ERM fluctuation
margins.
Intra-marginal intervention: intervention carried out by a central bank to influence the
exchange rate of its currency within its ERM fluctuation margins.
Large-value payments: payments, generally of very large amounts, which are mainly
exchanged between banks or between participants in the financial markets and usually require
urgent and timely settlement.
Links between securities settlement systems: the procedure between two securities
settlement systems for the cross-border transfer of securities through a book-entry process
(without physical transfer).
Loss-sharing rule (or loss-sharing agreement): an agreement between participants in a
transfer system or a clearing house arrangement regarding the allocation of any loss arising when
one or more participants fail to fulfil their obligation; the arrangement stipulates how the loss will
be shared among the parties concerned in the event the agreement is activated.
Monetary Committee: a consultative Community body, composed of two members
appointed by each Member State in their personal capacity (normally one from the government
and one from the central bank) and two representatives appointed by the European
Commission. It was created in 1958 on the basis of Article 105 of the EEC Treaty. In order
to promote co-ordination of the policies of Member States to the full extent needed for the
functioning of the internal market, Article 109c of the Treaty lists a set of areas where the
Monetary Committee contributes to the preparation of the work of the Council. At the start
of Stage Three (Economic and Monetary Union) the Monetary Committee will be
dissolved and an Economic and Financial Committee will be created instead.
Monitoring Group: a group composed of foreign exchange experts from the EU central
banks who review on a regular basis current economic and monetary developments and policies
in order to assess the functioning of the EMS.
Multi-purpose prepaid card: a prepaid card which can be used at the outlets of several
service providers for a wide range of purposes, which has the potential to be used on a national
or international scale but may sometimes be restricted to a certain area. Also known as an
electronic purse.

118

Net settlement system (NSS): a funds transfer system, the settlement operations of
which are completed on a bilateral or multilateral net basis.
Quick tender: a tender procedure to be used by the ESCB for fine-tuning operations when
it is deemed desirable to have a rapid impact on the liquidity situation in the market. Quick
tenders are executed within a time frame of one hour and are restricted to a limited set of
counterparties.
Realignment: change in the ECU central rate and bilateral central rates of one or
several currencies participating in the ERM.
Re-denomination of securities: the denomination of a security is the currency in which the
par value of the security is expressed (in most cases, the face value of a certificate). Redenomination refers to a procedure through which the original denomination of a security,
issued in national currency, is changed into the euro at the irrevocably fixed conversion rate.
Reference period: time intervals specified in Article 104c (2a) of the Treaty and in
Protocol No. 6 on the convergence criteria for examining progress towards convergence.
Reference value: Protocol No. 5 of the Treaty on the excessive deficit procedure sets
explicit reference values for the deficit ratio (3% of GDP) and the debt ratio (60% of GDP),
whereas Protocol No. 6 on the convergence criteria specifies the methodology for the
computation of the reference values relevant for the examination of price and long-term interest
rate convergence.
Remote access to an IFTS: the facility for a credit institution established in one country
(“home country”) to become a direct participant in an interbank funds transfer system
(IFTS) established in another country (“host country”) and, for that purpose, to have a
settlement account in its own name with the central bank in the host country, if necessary,
without having established a branch in the host country.
Reverse transaction: an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under a
repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.
RTGS (real-time gross settlement) system: a settlement system in which processing and
settlement take place on an order-by-order basis (without netting) in real time (continuously).
See also TARGET system.
Scriptural money: all money in book-entry form and therefore not circulating in the form of
banknotes and coins.
Second Banking Co-ordination Directive: adopted on 15 December 1989 (89/646/
EEC), which deals with the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions
relating to the taking-up and pursuit of the business of EU-based credit institutions. It amends
the First Banking Co-ordination Directive adopted in 1977 (77/780/EEC).
Securities settlement system: a system which permits the transfer of securities either free
of payment or against payment.

119

Settlement agent: an institution that manages the settlement process (e.g. the determination
of settlement positions, monitoring the exchange of payments, etc.) for transfer systems or
other arrangements that require settlement.
