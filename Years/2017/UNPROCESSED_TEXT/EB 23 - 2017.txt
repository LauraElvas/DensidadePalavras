conomic and monetary
 developments
 Summary
 The solid and broad
-based economic expansion
 in the euro area is continuing; the 
latest
 data 
and survey results
 point to unabated growth momentum in the second 
half of this year. The 
ECB™s 
monetary policy measures continue to support domestic 
demand
, which is a precondition for further progress 
towards a sustained adjustment 
in the path of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term
. 
Private consumption is underpinned by rising employment, 
which is also benefiting 
from
 past labour market reforms, and by increasing househ
old wealth. 
The upswing 
in business investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions 
and improvements in corporate profitability. Construction i
nvestment has also 
strengthened. 
Risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain 
broadly 
balanced.
 On the one hand, the strong cyclical momentum, as evidenced in recent 
developments in sentiment indicators, could lead to further positive growth surprises. 
On the other hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors 
and developments in foreign exchange markets.
 At the global level, g
rowth has 
also 
broadened across countries
 and survey
-based 
indicators point to sustained 
momentum. 
Global trade growth strengthened in July
, after 
a moderation in the 
second
 quarter
 of 201
7, and remained robust in August
, mainly driven by 
the 
advanced economies
. Leading indicators continue to signal positive prospects 
for 
trade growth 
in the 
short
 term.
 Euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.5% in September, unchanged from August. 
Underlying inflation 
measures have 
ticked up moderately since early 2017, but 
have 
yet to show more convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Wage growth has 
increased 
somewhat
, but domestic cost pressures still remain subdued overall. 
Global 
headline 
inflation
 also 
picked
 up in August
, 
mainly due to 
increases in energy 
and food prices.
 Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to continue to rise 
gradually over the medium term, supported by 
the ECB™s
 monetary policy measures, 
the continuing econ
omic expansion, the corresponding gradual absorption of 
economic slack and rising wage growth.
 Looking ahead, on the basis of current 
futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to temporarily decline towards the turn 
of the year, mainly reflectin
g base effects in energy prices.
 Broad money growth 
has 
remained robust, and the gradual recovery in 
loan 
growth 
is proceeding. 
Domestic 
counterparts of broad money
, associated with Eurosystem 
purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP)
 and
 the 
gradual recovery in 
the growth of credit to the private sector,
 were
 the main driver
s of broad money 
growth
. The latest euro area bank lending survey shows that l
oan growth continue
s to be supported by increasing loan demand by enterprises and households
, and the 
easing 
of 
credit standards for loans to households.

 Summary
 3 non-financial corporations (NFCs) have remained favourable, with b
ank lending rates 
for NFCs close to their historical lows
. Financial markets
 reflect
 the 
firmer euro
 area economic outlook
 and global 
developments
. Euro area government bond yields have risen and the EONIA forward 
curve has steepened since early September. The improved economic outlook and 
some easing 
of geopolitical concerns have driven indices of equit
y prices higher, 
while corporate debt spreads have tightened. 
The trade
-weighted 
value of the 
euro is 
unchanged
 overall
, despite some bilateral depreciation against the US dollar and 
the 
pound sterling.
 At its monetary policy meeting on 26 October 2017, th
e Governing Council
 took the 
following decisions in pursuit of its price stability objective.
  First, the key ECB interest rates were kept unchanged and the Governing 
Council continues to expect them to remain at their present levels for an 
extended period 
of time, and well past the horizon of net asset purchases. 
  Second, as regards non
-standard monetary policy measures, the Eurosystem 
will continue to make purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of 
•60 billion until the end of December 2017. Fr
om January 2018 net asset 
purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of •30 billion until the 
end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the 
Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation 
consist
ent with its inflation aim. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if 
financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a 
sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands 
ready to increase the APP in term
s of size and/or duration.
  Third, the Eurosystem will 
reinvest the principal payments from maturing 
securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end 
of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. This w
ill 
contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary 
policy stance.
  Fourth, the Governing Council 
also decided to continue to conduct the main 
refinancing operations and th
ree-month longer
-term refinancing operations as 
fix
ed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at 
least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2019.
 The Governing Council took these decisions to preserve the very favourable 
financing conditions that are stil
l needed for a sustained return of inflation rates 
towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. While the recalibration of the asset 
purchases reflects growing confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation 
towards the inflation aim, domestic price
 pressures are still muted overall, and the 
economic outlook and the path of inflation remain conditional on continued support 
from monetary policy. The Governing Council concluded that an ample degree of 
monetary stimulus therefore remains necessary for u
nderlying inflation pressures to 
gradually build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium 
term.

 Global growth has broadened across countries, while survey
-based indicators 
point to sustained momentum.
 Since the 
second half of 2016, the economic 
recovery has shown signs of increasing synchronisation globally (see Chart
 1). 
Moreover, survey indicators are consistent with sustained global growth. In the third 
quarter of 2017 the global composite output Purchasing Ma
nagers™ Index (PMI) 
excluding the euro area remained at a level similar to those recorded in the first half 
of the year, close to long
-term averages. Looking at the world™s major advanced 
economies, the PMI picked up in the United States, but declined in J
apan (and, to a 
lesser extent, the United Kingdom) relative to the second quarter. As regards 
emerging market economies, the quarterly PMI increased in China and rose 
marginally in Brazil, but declined in Russia and India (with the latter falling below the
 expansion threshold).

 Note: The latest observation is for the second quarter of 2017.
 Indicators point to a recovery in global 
trade in the third quarter of this year.
 Following a moderation in the second quarter of 2017, global trade growth 
strengthened in July and remained robust in August, with the volume of merchandise 
imports increasing by a solid 1.5% in three
-month
-on-three
-month terms in July, 
followed by growth of 1.3% in August (see Chart
 2). The increase in 
those
 two 
months was driven mainly by advanced economies. Leading indicators continue to 
signal positive prospects in the short term. In particular, the global PMI fo
r new 
export orders stood at 52.8 in the third quarter of 2017, close to the level recorded in 
the first half of this year and above its long
-term average.

 Note: The latest observations are for August 2017 for global merchandise imports and September 2017 for the PMIs.
 Global 
inflation picked up in August.
 After increasing slightly to stand at 2.0% in 
July, annual consumer price inflation in the Organisation for Economic Co
-operation 
and Development (OECD) area rose further to stand at 2.2% in August. That 
increase was driven m
ainly by a pick
-up in energy prices, but food prices also 
experienced a moderate increase. Annual OECD inflation excluding food and energy 
remained unchanged at 1.8% in August.
 Oil prices have trended upwards in recent weeks.
 This reflects persistent signa
ls 
that market rebalancing is under way, with demand increasing further and markets 
more firmly expecting the current OPEC agreement to be extended beyond March 
2018. Geopolitical tensions following the independence referendum of the Kurdistan 
region in Ir
aq at the end of September and concerns about US sanctions on Iran 
have also supported higher oil quotations. Prices remain well above the levels 
observed prior to the OPEC agreement of November 2016.
 Economic data in the United States are temporarily bein
g affected by the 
recent hurricanes.
 After recovering to stand at an annualised rate of 3.1% in the 
second quarter, US real GDP growth is expected to weaken temporarily in the third 
quarter, reflecting the economic impact of recent hurricanes. However, exp
erience of 
previous hurricanes suggests that economic activity should rebound thereafter as 
reconstruction efforts gather pace. The overall decline in employment in September 
was also influenced by those hurricanes. Employment growth outside the affected 
areas was fairly robust, consistent with a further tightening of the labour market. 
Annual headline inflation rose to 2.2% in September, boosted by a temporary 
increase in 
petrol
 prices following the hurricanes, while annual consumer price 
inflation excludi
ng food and energy was stable at 1.7% for a fifth consecutive month. 
At its September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee announced that it 
would start normalising its balance sheet in October. Specifically, it indicated that the 
principal payments 
received from its securities holdings would only be reinvested to 
the extent that they exceeded gradually rising caps.

 6 In Japan, economic activity remains strong and the labour market continues to 
be tight.
 Real GDP increased by 0.6% quarter on quarter in 
the second quarter of 
2017. That figure was revised downwards slightly from the previous estimate, but 
stands well above potential growth. Overall, the outlook for the Japanese economy 
remains favourable, supported by accommodative policies, recovering for
eign 
demand and a strong labour market. The country™s unemployment rate stood at 2.8% 
in August, with the vacancy rate rising to a level unseen since the early 1990s. 
Although base wage growth has remained weak, recent gains in labour productivity 
in the n
on-financial sector suggest that there is increasing scope for stronger wage 
growth. Meanwhile, annual headline consumer price inflation rose to 0.7% in August, 
reflecting some upward momentum across measures of underlying inflation. In the 
general electio
n held
 on 22 October, the ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Shinzo 
Abe secured 
its 
victory with a two
-thirds parliamentary majority.
 In the United Kingdom, economic activity slowed markedly in the first half of 
2017. This followed two quarters of unexpectedly resilient growth in the aftermath of 
the country™s referendum on EU membership last year. In the second quarter of 
2017, real GDP growth stood at 0.3% quarter on quarter, broadly in line with the 
previous quarter
, but down from 
0.7%
 in the fourth quarter of 
2016. The 
pass
-through of sterling™s depreciation to consumer prices has been a major drag on 
growth, as it has hurt consumption by eroding households™ purchasing power. Recent 
indicators suggest that economic 
activity will remain subdued in the second half of 
the year as well. Annual consumer price inflation rose to 3.0% in September. Five 
rounds of ﬁBrexitﬂ negotiations in accordance with Article
 50 of the Treaty on 
European Union have taken place between the 
European Union and the United 
Kingdom following the official start of negotiations on 19
 June 2017, although few 
decisions have been made to date regarding the terms of the final settlement.
 Economic activity in China remains robust.
 Following strong growt
h in the first 
half of the year, China™s real GDP growth weakened marginally in the third quarter of 
2017, standing at 6.8% year on year, down from 6.9% in the previous quarter. This 
slight moderation was in line with recent data on industrial production, 
fixed asset 
investment and retail sales. However, available survey data for September have 
remained robust. Consumer price inflation remains moderate and weakened in 
September, while annual producer price inflation rose to 6.9%, up from 6.3% in 
August, wit
h raw material prices continuing to increase strongly and prices of 
manufacturing goods also rising. In October the 19th National Congress of the 
Communist Party of China took place, which confirmed the leadership and set broad 
policy guidelines for the ne
xt five years.

 Euro area government bond yields have generally risen since early September.
 In the period under review (i.e. the period from 7
 September to 25
 October), the euro 
area ten
-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate and 
the
 euro area ten
-year sovereign 
bond yield (as measured by the 
country 
GDP
-weighted average) increased by 
around 15
 basis points to stand at 0.72% and 1.09% respectively. Sovereign bond 
spreads vis
-à-vis risk
-free OIS rates were broadly unchanged over the re
view period, 
with the exception of Portugal, where they fell by around 60
 basis points in response 
to a credit rating upgrade (to investment grade) by S
tandard 
& Poor™s
. In the United 
Kingdom and the United States, sovereign bond yields rose by around 40
 basis 
points to stand at 1.41% and 2.43% respectively, largely driven by market 
expectations regarding the future path of monetary policy in those two countries.
 Broad indices of euro area equity prices rose over the review period (see 
Chart
 3).
 The equity 
prices of euro area non
-financial corporations (NFCs) increased 
by around 3.3%, while prices rose by 6% in the case of euro area bank
 equitie
s. 
These increases were largely due to a decline in the equity risk premium, consistent 
with a perceived easing of 
geopolitical risks. 
Overall, 
expectations of solid growth in 
earnings continue to support euro area equity prices, 
reflecting
 the broad
-based 
improvement in the euro area™s macroeconomic environment. The equity prices of 
US NFCs and banks also increased ov
er the review period, rising by 2.6% and 14% 
respectively. Market expectations of equity price volatility in the euro area and the 
United States remained unchanged overall at around 10% and 7% respectively 
Œ levels that are comparatively low from a histori
cal perspective.

ember and around 80
 basis points below the levels observed in 
March 2016 prior to the announcement and subsequent launch of the corporate 
sector purchase programme. Spreads on non
-investment
-grade NFC bonds also 
declined during the period under review, fal
ling by 30
 basis points, while spreads on 
financial sector debt were largely unchanged. Such low levels and further 
compression of corporate bond spreads are consistent with a strengthening of the 
economic recovery.
 The 
euro overnight index average (
EONIA
) remained broadly unchanged at 
around 
0.36% during the review period.
 Excess liquidity in the banking system 
increased by around •52
 billion to stand at •1,825
 billion. This increase was 
attributable to ongoing securities purchases under the ECB™s asset purchase 
programme.
 The EONIA forward curve shifted upwards slightly ov
er the review period.
 This 
upward movement was driven by maturities 
longer than
 three years, for which 
EONIA forward rates increased by around 15
 basis points. The gradual upward slope 
of the curve implies that market participants continue to expect a prol
onged period of 
negative rates lasting until around mid
-2020. In foreign exchange markets, the value of the euro remained broadly 
unchanged in 
nominal 
effective terms over the period under review.
 The euro 
depreciated vis
-à-vis the US dollar (by 1.6%) and 
the pound sterling (by 2.8%), 
reflecting market expectations regarding the relative monetary policy stances of 
those two countries. This depreciation was, however, largely offset by other 
developments, with the euro appreciating vis
-à-vis most other major 
currencies, 
including the Chinese renminbi (by 0.8%), the Japanese yen (by 3.1%) and the 
Swiss franc (by 2.4%). Moreover, the euro also strengthened against the currencies 
of most major emerging market economies, as well as 
those of 
most EU Member 
States o
utside the euro area, with the exception of the Czech koruna and the Polish 
zloty (see Chart

 The solid and broad

 Real GDP increased by 0.7%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2017, 
following a rise of 0.6% in the previous quarter (see Chart
 5), on the back of a strong 
positive contribution from domestic demand. 
At the same time, net trade contributed 
negatively, while changes in inventories made a neutral contribution to GDP growth 
in the second quarter. The latest economic indicators
 Œ both

 Private consumption

ongoing economic expansion.
 Consumer spending rose by 0.5%, quarter on 
quarter, in the second quarter
 of 2017, following a somewhat lower rate of increase 
in the previous quarter. This outcome largely reflected higher purchasing power 
following a 10% fall of the oil price in euro terms between the first and second 
quarters of 2017. On an annual basis, con
sumption rose by 1.6% in the second 
quarter, the same rate as in the first quarter of 2017. This stable pattern contrasted 
with a decline in growth 
in households™ real disposable income to 1.4%, year on year, 
in the second quarter, from 1.6% in the previou
s quarter. Consistent with the 
unchanged consumption growth and lower income growth in the second quarter of 
2017, the annual rate of change in savings declined in the second quarter, leading to 
a historically low saving ratio of 12%.

 Barring any short
-term volatility, consumption growth is
 expected to remain 
resilient.
 Recent data on retail trade and new passenger car registrations currently 
point to lower quarterly growth in consumer spending in the third quarter of 2017 
compared with the second quarter. However, these data tend to display
 some 
volatility, while other indicators point to continued robust underlying consumption 
dynamics. For instance, further employment growth, as suggested by the latest 
survey indicators, should also continue to support aggregate income and thus 
consumer sp
ending. In addition, households™ net worth continued to increase at 
robust levels, lending further support to consumer spending. These factors may 
partly explain why consumer confidence improved further in the third quarter before 
reaching its highest valu
e since April 2001
 in October
. Following a strong second quarter, business investment should continue to 
grow in the third quarter of 2017.
 Non
-construction investment, which grew by 
3.5%
, quarter on quarter
, in the second quarter of 2017, was driven by in
vestment in 
intellectual property assets and non
-transport
-related machinery and equipment. As 
for the third quarter, continued favourable conditions in the capital goods sector, such 
as increasing capacity utilisation, rising orders, stronger confidence a
nd rising 
demand, signal overall a continuation of the ongoing dynamic investment

 12 momentum. Monthly data on capital goods production up to August also suggest 
rising business investment at the beginning of the third quarter. With regard to 
construction inv
estment, monthly construction production data point to slowing 
growth in the third quarter of 2017. However, survey indicators on the demand 
situation and the assessment of order books in the sector, as well as the number of 
building permits issued, are st
ill in line with positive underlying dynamics in the short 
term.
 Going forward, investment is expected to remain an important contributor to 
growth.
 Investment should continue to benefit from elevated business confidence 
and diminishing uncertainty, rising
 capacity utilisation, highly supportive financing 
conditions, stronger corporate profits and the increasing need to modernise the 
capital stock. According to the euro area sectoral accounts, the corporate gross 
operating surplus increased in the second qu
arter of 2017, albeit at a lower year
-on-year rate than in the previous quarter, and earnings expectations for listed 
companies in the euro area, available up to August, remain at high levels. As regards 
construction investment, factors such as households™
 rising disposable income and 
improving lending conditions should underpin demand in the sector. At the same 
time, some factors are expected to continue to weigh on the outlook for investment, 
including expectations of weaker growth over the medium term an
d limitations on the 
intermediation capacity of banks in some countries.
 Despite prospects of slowing growth in the third quarter of 2017, trade 
indicators point to sustained momentum going forward.
 Total euro area exports 
rose by 0.9% in the second quarte
r on account of strong goods exports. Monthly 
trade in goods up to August suggests that extra
-euro area exports will continue to 
show positive growth in the third quarter of 2017, in line with the recovery in foreign 
demand, albeit at a slower pace than in
 the second quarter. Exports in the first two 
months of the third quarter of 2017 seem to have been supported by demand from 
China, the United States, Latin America and, to a lesser extent, non
-euro area EU 
countries, whereas the United Kingdom and Asia (e
xcluding China) made negative 
contributions. Leading indicators
, such as survey results
, continue to signal ongoing 
improvements in foreign demand, while new manufacturing export orders from 
outside the euro area have risen further.
 Overall, the latest eco
nomic indicators are, on balance, consistent with a 
continued robust growth pattern in the second half of 2017.
 Industrial production 
(excluding construction) 
rose strongly 
in August. As a result, 
in July and August 
production stood on average 1.0% above t
he level in the second quarter of the year, 
when it rose by 1.2% on a quarterly basis. More 
recent 
survey data also signal solid 
growth dynamics in the near term. The composite output 
PMI 
averaged 56.0 in the 
third quarter of 2017, compared with 56.6 in th
e second quarter, before declining 
between September and October 
to 
55.9. Meanwhile, the European Commission™s 
ESI 
rose to 112.1 in the third quarter from 110.0 in the second quarter (see Chart
 5). 
Both the ESI and the PMI remain well above their respectiv
e long
-term averages.
 Looking ahead, the ongoing firm and broad economic expansion is expected 
to continue.

process and continue to support domestic demand. Private consumption is

nned by rising employment, which is also benefiting from past labour market 
reforms, and by increasing household wealth. The upswing in business investment 
continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in 
corporate profita
bility. Construction investment has also strengthened. In addition, 
the broad
-based global recovery is supporting euro area exports. The results of the 
latest round of the 
ECB™s Survey of Professional Forecasters
, conducted in early 
October, show that private sector GDP growth forecasts were revised upwards for 
2017, 2018 and 2019 in comparison with the previous round conducted in early July.
 The risks surrounding the 
euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced.
 On the one hand, the strong cyclical momentum, as evidenced 
by 
recent 
developments in sentiment indicators, could lead to further positive growth surprises. 
On the other hand, downside risks continue to rel
ate primarily to global factors and 
developments in foreign exchange markets.

excluding food and energy has recovered more 
than half of the difference bet
ween 
an average of 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016

in part to strong increases in inflation in the

underlying inflation have yet to show mor
e convincing signs of a sustained upward 
adjustment.
 Annual growth in the GDP deflator, which can be regarded as a broad indicator 
of underlying domestic price developments, picked up to stand at 1.0% in the 
second quarter of 2017, up from 0.7% in the prev
ious quarter.
 While the 
contribution made by unit labour costs declined marginally, this was more than offset 
by a strengthening in unit profits (which may reflect volatility related to the weakness 
observed in the previous quarter, but could also be due t
o a decline in the drag from 
the terms of trade). The recent pick
-up in the GDP deflator has seen it recouple

 15 The 
appreciation of the 
euro exchange rate over the summer has eased 
external price pressures.
 The increase observed in the euro™s nominal effective 
exchange rate 
over
 the summer has been reflected in a decline in import inflation. 
Annual import inflation for non
-food consumer goods, which can be expected to feed 
through to
 consumer price inflation for non
-energy industrial goods, stood at 
-0.1%
 in 
July and 
-0.3% in August, down from its recent peak of 1.3% in April. More generally, 
however, the pass
-through of the euro™s appreciation along domestic production and 
retailing 
chains is surrounded by a large degree of uncertainty and depends, inter 
alia, on the potential adjustment of profit margins. Thus far, producer price inflation 
for non
-food consumer goods has remained stable, with a year
-on-year rate of 0.3% 
being recorde
d in August, unchanged 
since
 June and only marginally higher than the 
levels observed in early 2016.
 Wage growth has 
increased somewhat
 but remains well below historical 
averages.
 Annual growth in compensation per employee was 1.6% in the second 
quarter of
 2017, up from 1.5% in the previous quarter and continuing a rise since the 
low
 of 1.1% in the second quarter of 2016. Despite this uptick, wage growth remains 
well below its average since 1999 of 2.1%. Following revisions to data, annual 
growth in compens
ation per hour has exhibited broadly similar developments to 
annual growth in compensation per employee in recent years. Factors that may have 
been weighing on wage growth include significant slack in the labour market, weak 
productivity growth, low past i
nflation and the ongoing impact of labour market 
reforms implemented in some countries during the financial crisis.
 Market and survey
-based measures of long
-term inflation expectations have 
remained broadly stable (see Chart
 8).
 On 25 October 2017, t
he fiv
e-year inflation
-linked swap rate five years ahead 
stood
 at 1.64%. The forward profile of market
-based measures of inflation expectations continues to signal a prolonged period of 
low inflation
, with only a very gradual return to inflation levels below, bu
t close to, 
2%. The probability of deflation implied by inflation options markets remains very low 
and continues to suggest that deflation risk remains contained. According to the ECB 
Survey of Professional Forecasters
 for the fourth quarter of 2017
, long
er-term 
inflation expectations for the euro area 
were revised upwards to 1.9% (an increase 
from 1.83% to 1.88%).

 Broad money continued to expand at a robust pace.
 The annual growth rate of 
M3 increased to 5.1% in September 2017 (from 5.0% in August) and has been 
hoverin
g around that level since mid
-2015 (see Chart
 9). The low opportunity cost of 
holding liquid deposits in an environment of very low interest rates and the impact of 
the ECB™s monetary policy measures continued to support M3 growth. Annual M1 
growth increas
ed to 9.7% in September (up from 9.5% in August) and was again the 
main contributor to M3 growth.
 Chart
 9 M3 and its counterparts
 (annual percentage changes; contributions in percentage points; adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects
)  Source: ECB.
 Notes: 
Credit to the private sector includes 
monetary financial institution (
MFI
) loans to the private sector and MFI holdings of 
securities issued by the euro area private non
-MFI sector. It thus includes the Eurosystem™s holdings of debt securities in th
e context of 
the corporate sector purchase programme
 (CSPP)
. The latest observation is for 
September 
2017. Domestic counterparts of broad money remained the main driver of broad 
money growth.
 First, Eurosystem purchases of government bonds in the context o
f the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) continued to have a considerable 
positive impact on M3 growth (see the orange bars in Chart
 9). Second, the gradual 
recovery in the growth of credit to the private sector exerted a positive impact on M3 
growth 
(see the blue bars in Chart
 9). This includes both MFI loans to the private 
sector
 and MFI holdings of securities issued by the euro area private non
-MFI sector. 
The latter 
also include 
the Eurosystem™s purchases in the context of the CSPP. Third, 
the nega
tive annual rate of change 
in 
MFIs™ longer
-term financial liabilities (excluding 
capital and reserves) supported M3 growth (included together with other M3 
counterparts in the dark green bars in Chart
 9). 
This 
is partly explained by the limited 
attractiven
ess of long
-term deposits and bank bonds in the environment of a 
relatively flat yield curve. By contrast, the contribution to M3 growth of credit to 
general government from MFIs excluding the Eurosystem remained negative (see 
the light green bars in Chart

 18 MFIs™ net external assets continued to exert downward pressure on annual M3 
growth
 (see the yellow bars in Chart
 9), which was partly explained by PSPP
-related 
sales of euro area government bonds by non
-residents. At the same time, annual 
outflows in 
MFI net external assets receded somewhat, partly on account of 
increasing net purchases of euro area securities other than government bonds by 
non-residents, which partly offset non
-residents™ net sales of euro area general 
government bonds.
 The gradual re
covery in loan growth is 
continuing
. The annual growth rate of 
MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional 
cash pooling) increased marginally in September (see Chart
 10). Across sectors, the 
annual growth rate of l
oans to non
-financial corporations (NFCs) increased slightly to 
2.5% in September (from 2.4% in August), while that of loans to households 
remained unchanged at 2.7% (see 
the box entitled 
ﬁRecent trends in consumer 
credit in the euro areaﬂ
 in this issue of
 the Economic Bulletin
). The significant 
decrease in bank lending rates seen across the euro area since mid
-2014 (owing 
notably to the ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy measures) and the overall 
improvement in bank lending conditions have supported the re
covery in loan growth. 
In addition, banks have made progress in consolidating their balance sheet
s, 
although the level of non
-performing loans remains high in some countries and may 
constrain banks™ intermediation capacity.

 19 enterprises and households. Banks also reported increasing net
 loan demand across 
all loan categories. Growth in fixed investment, merger and acquisition activity, the 
low general le
vel of interest rates and favourable housing market prospects were 
important positive contributors to loan demand. 
According to reporting banks
, the ECB™s asset purchase programme 
has 
continued to have an easing impact on credit 
terms and conditions over t
he past six months, while having a negative impact on 
bank profitability. 
Euro area banks also reported that the ECB™s negative deposit 
facility rate 
has 
continued to have a dampening impact on bank lending rates and a 
positive impact on lending volumes fo
r loans to euro area enterprises and 
households over the past six months.
 Bank lending rates for NFCs and households remained at or close to their 
historical lows.
 In August 2017 the composite bank lending rate for NFC loans 
remained at 
the 
historical low 
of 1.74% 
that 
it reached in July. For households, the 
composite lending rate for housing loans continued to increase slightly, to 1.91% in 
August, compared with its historical low of 1.78% in December 2016 (see Chart
 11). 
Composite lending rates for NFCs a
nd households have decreased more than 
market reference rates since the announcement of the ECB™s credit easing 
measures in June 2014. Between May 2014 and August 2017, composite lending 
rates on loans to euro area NFCs and households fell by 119 and 100
 basis points, 
respectively. The reduction in bank lending rates on NFC loans was especially strong 
in vulnerable countries, indicating a more homogeneous transmission of monetary 
policy to bank lending rates in the euro area. Over the same period, the sprea
d between interest rates charged on very small loans (loans of up to •0.25
 million) and 
those charged on large loans (loans of above •1
 million) in the euro area narrowed 
substantially, indicating a considerable improvement in the financing conditions 
for 
small and medium

those for 
large companies.

 20 Net issuance of debt securities by euro area NFCs increased in the third 
quarter of 2017.
 The latest ECB data show that i
n July and August 2017 the sum of 
net flows of debt securities issued by NFCs was marginally higher than it was in the 
second quarter of 2017. Recent market data suggest that issuance activity 
strengthened somewhat in September and October. Net issuance of
 listed shares by 
NFCs turned slightly negative in July and August 2017 
owing 
to share buy
-backs in 
July.
 Financing costs for euro area NFCs remain favourable.
 The overall nominal cost 
of external financing for NFCs, comprising bank lending, debt issuance 
in the market 
and equity finance, is estimated to have declined to around 4.4% in September and 
the first half of October 2017. 
The estimated cost of financing 
thus 
stand
s some 
35 basis points above 
the

July 2016, but it is still 
considerably lower than the levels observed in summer 2014. Two

decline in the estimated overall cost of financing 
since July 2017 
is accounted for by 
the developments in the cost of equity. Furthermore, the estimated cost of debt, 
expressed 
as the weighted average of the cost of bank lending and the cost of 
market

, reaching
 new historical lows. The 
ECB™s CSPP

to the moderation in the cost of marke

growth?
 Against the backdrop of lower productivity and lower trade globally, t
his 
box 
discusses the impact of trade on 
medium
-term 
labour productivity growth for major
 emerging and advanced economies
. Economic theory advocates a positive 
relationship between trade and productivity, suggesting that wider participation in 
international trade 
leads to 
improvements
 in productivity.
 Growth in labour productivity and global trade has lost momentum since the 
late 1990s.
 This deceleration intensified markedly after the 
onset in 2007 of the 
global 
financial crisis. Labour productivity
 Œ defined as re
al GDP divided by number 
of workers
 Œ slowed down across advanced economies from rates broadly stable 
at 
around 2% prior to the crisis to less than 1%. At the same time the growth rate of 
OECD imports declined from around 7% during the two decades prior to
 the financial 
crisis to less than 3% in recent years
 (see Chart
 A).

productivity is a weighted average across advanced economies based on GDP

 A fundamental characteristic of the slowdown in global trade has been the 
recent stalling in the expansion of global 
value chains (GVCs).
 Over the last 
few 
years the share of GVC
-related trade in world trade has hovered around 41% (
see 
Chart
 B). A more 
detailed
 analysis uncovers key discrepancies across countries. 
While in

 the share has continued

its pre

the

fragmentation of 
supply chains appear
s to have 
slowed and even

. Notes: GVC participation is measured as the import content of exports combined 
with the share of exports that is further processed 
and re
-exported by trading partners. The underlying data 
are
 nominal; the measure has been adjusted to exclude value added in 
energy sectors
, thus preventing distortion in the measure from oil price chang
es. Economic theory points to a positive relation
ship
 between trade and 
productivity, as engaging in trade is considered to promote advances in 
productivity.
 Recent models on the trade
-productivity nexus focus on the effect of 
trade
 on competition. This li
ne of theory argues that higher exposure to traded goods 
increases competition among heterogeneous firms, leading to a reallocation of 
resources towards more productive firms, while the least productive companies are 
forced to exit the market (e.g. Melitz
2; Melitz and Ottaviano
3, among others). 
Increased competition from
 imported products incentivises firms to invest in 
the 
upgrading of technology 
while
 the availability of a larger range of intermediate 
production inputs potentially lowers firms™ 
input 
costs. 
On the export side, the 
possibility to expand into larger (export) markets provides incentives to improve 
the 
efficiency or quality of production, thereby boosting productivity within firms
. With the wider availability of data on GVC participation, 
a more recent strand 
of the literature examines the link between productivity and the interaction of 
firms within global supply chains.
 Two mechanisms point to productivity increases 
resulting from the interaction of firms within global supply chains
. Firs
t, by 
outsourcing parts of production to international suppliers, efficiency gains in the form 
of lower cost or higher quality are realised and raise productivity. Second, joining 
international production chains typically entails knowledge spillovers, redu
cing the 
distance to the technological frontier and thereby boosting firm
-level productivity. The 
literature on the link between GVC participation, trade and productivity has

-related trade.
 Two GVC measures
 were used
 Œ one reflects
 the import content of exports 
(backward 
GVC 
participation)
, while the other 
adds exports that are further 
processed and re
-exported by the trading partner
 (forward 
GVC 
participation). 
The 
data 
sample i
s annual and cover
s 13 manufacturing industries in a set of 40 
advanced and emerging market economies over the period 1996
-2007. Following 
Bernard, Jensen and Schott
6, the data are
 divided into 
three
-year 
non
-overlapping
 periods, 
with the change in trade a
nd GVC variables in a given three
-year period 
explaining the changes in productivity over the subsequent three years.
7 The results suggest a positive and significant relationship between 
productivity and international trade (in real terms).
 For the manufac
turing sector 
(excluding oil
-related industries), the regression in 
column (1) of 
Table
 A shows
 a positive 
link
 between growth rates of both total exports and total imports of goods 
and services
 on the one hand,
 and labour productivity growth
 on the other
. When 
disentangling trade between final and intermediate goods, the results show that real 
imports of intermediate goods and services dominate the trade impact on 
productivity
. This
 suggests that the more important efficiency gains from trade come 
through 
both increased competition in the domestic market and 
access to lower input 
costs.
 Across trade variables, GVC
-related trade is the most relevant driver of 
productivity, and hence activity.
 When differentiating
 the imports of intermediate 
goods between GVC
-related imports and non
-GVC
-related imports
, only 
GVC
-related trade is statistically significant for labour productivity. This would 
suggest that beyond the positive gains to productivity from the input cost channel, 
the international 
integration
 of produ
ction processes provides an additional source 
for labour productivity growth
, possibly via knowledge
-transfer effects. 
All other 
things being equal
, a 10
 percentage point
 increase in GVC
-related trade growth 
increases productivity growth by about 0.5
 perce
ntage point
. The results are 
qualitatively similar for backward and forward GVC participation
.                                                                     4  Schwörer, T., ﬁOffshoring, domestic outsourcin

 Notes: 
The sample
 period is 1996

divided into four three
-year period averages. Regression includes fixed effects at the 
country
-period level to capture technology differences across countries and time. Fixed effects at the industries level were dropped 
from the
 regression
, since they were not significant. All variables are in real terms. The 
asterisks
 indicate statistical significance at the 
10% (
one asterisk
), 5% (
two
 asterisks
) and 1% (
three
 asterisks
) level based on robust standard errors.
 However, the relati
ve importance of GVC
-related trade measures for 
productivity differs between advanced economies and large emerging market 
economies.
 In 
advanced economies, 
the broader proxy for GVC
-related trade 
(which
 includes forward participation) has a somewhat more p
ronounced impact on 
productivity than the more narrow measure
 (backward participation)
, which would be 
justified by the reinforced channel of learning by exporting. 
Among key emerging 
market economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China, or 
BRIC
), the magnitu
de of the 
estimated coefficients on the backward GVC participation measure is significantly 
larger than in 
advanced economies. This suggests
 that 
in these countries 
productivity benefits more from backward participation, while 
the broader proxy for
 GVC
-rel
ated trade 
is found to be marginally insignificant.
 Overall, the analysis suggests that global trade and, in particular, participation 
in GVCs exert a significant impact on labour productivity 
over
 the medium
 term.
 A further weakening of global trade, for 
example through greater use of 
protectionist measures, could 
therefore 
entail economically significant costs in terms 
of lower 
growth in 
labour productivity.

 The recalibration of the ECB™s asset purchase programme
 25 2 The recalibration of the ECB
™s asset purchase
 prog
ramme
 At its meeting on 26 October 2017 the Governing Council of the ECB decided 
to recalibrate the expanded asset purchase programme (APP).
 It confirmed that 
purchases under the APP will be made at the current monthly pace of •60 billion until 
the end of 
December 2017 and that from January 2018 the net asset purchases are 
intended to continue at a monthly pace of •30 billion until September 2018, or 
beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained 
adjustment in the path of
 inflation consistent with its inflation aim. In line with recent 
communications, the Governing Council reiterated its readiness to increase the APP 
in terms of 
the 
size of purchases and/or 
the duration of the 
program
me if the outlook 
becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further 
progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. The Governing 
Council also confirmed that the Eurosystem would reinvest the principal pay
ments 
from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time 
after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary
, with a view to contributing to favourable liquidity conditions and to maintaining an 
appropriate monetary policy stance. This box explains the rationale for the 
Governing Council™s decision to recalibrate the APP and explains the main 
transmission channels of the programme.
 Rationale for recalibrating the APP
 In January 2015 the Governing C
ouncil decided to launch the APP to address 
risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation.
 From March 2015 to March 2016 
the Eurosystem purchased public and private sector securities at a pace of •60 
billion per month. To accelerate the return of inflat
ion rates to levels consistent with 
the ECB
™s definition of price stability, monthly purchases were increased to •80 
billion from April 2016 to March 2017. In December 2016 the Governing Council 
announced a recalibration of the APP, extending the net purch
ases until December 
2017 at a reduced monthly pace of •60 billion. Following the decision made on 26 
October 2017 the monthly pace will be further reduced to •30 billion from January 
2018 and net purchases will be carried out until September 2018
. The reca
libration of the APP reflects growing confidence in the gradual 
convergence of inflation rates towards the ECB
™s inflation aim,
 on account of 
the increasingly robust and broad
-based economic expansion, an uptick in measures 
of underlying inflation and the 
continued effective pass
-through of the Governing 
Council™s policy measures to the financing conditions of the real economy. Economic 
indicators point to unabated growth momentum in the second half of 2017. The 
broad
-based global recovery should support eu
ro area exports in the period ahead. 
Private consumption is underpinned by rising employment, owing in part to past 
labour market reforms, and by increasing household wealth. The cyclical upswing in 
investment continues to benefit from very favourable fina
ncing conditions and 
improvements in corporate profitability. While there is further evidence that measures 
ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 7 / 2017
 Œ Boxes

 26 of underlying inflation have ticked up, they have yet to show more convincing signs 
of a sustained upward trend. Overall, a substantial degree of mo
netary 
accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up 
and support headline inflation developments in the medium term consistent with the 
ECB™s definition of price stability.
 The size and duration of asset purchases a
re calibrated to deliver a 
constellation of yields and thus, indirectly, financing conditions that are 
consistent with achieving the ECB
™s inflation aim.
 Taking into account the 
endogenous adjustment of the whole spectrum of market conditions
, 
including ba
nk 
lending rates, corporate bonds and mortgages, as well as the 
euro
 exchange rate
, 
the calibration of the APP is aimed at providing the necessary amount of stimulus to 
the economy to support inflation developments in line with the ECB
™s definition of 
pric
e stability.
  The t
ransmission channels of the APP
 The level and shape of the yield curve can be influenced by acting on two 
components of long
-term interest rates
, namely the expectations component and 
the term premium. The expectations component reflects
 market expectations 
regarding the future path of short
-term interest rates, which are more directly 
affected by monetary policy rates. The term premium reflects the excess
 yield
 that an 
investor 
receives
 as compensation for exposure to duration risk, i.e.
 the portfolio 
losses that could potentially arise on bonds with a long residual maturity if interest 
rates increase unexpectedly.
 By purchasing long
-dated bonds, the Eurosystem absorb
s part of the duration 
risk that otherwise would have to be borne by pri
vate investors.
 By announc
ing
 that, under 
the APP
, it will withdraw a certain stock of long
-term bonds over a certain 
horizon 
Œ and thus a share of 
the 
duration risk that otherwise would have to be borne 
by the market 
Œ the ECB
 can influence the term premi
um and the yield curve in 
general. By compressing the term premium, the APP puts pressure on longer
-term 
interest rates in order to make long
-term borrowing more affordable
, thereby
 promot
ing
 investment and the consumption of durables. With fewer long
-dated 
bonds available overall for them to hold, private investors have more balance sheet 
capacity to hedge against the amount of duration risk that remains in the market and 
more risk
-bearing ca
pacity to reallocate funds to other investments, including the 
acquisition and financing of productive capital. This process of portfolio rebalancing 
is the key mechanism for propagating easing, stemming from duration extraction 
through quantitative interv
entions, across the entire economy.
 Overall, the Governing Council™s decision reflects the assessment that a 
sustained adjustment in the path of inflation has yet to fully materialise.
 This 
assessment is based on checking the latest inflation developments against four 
criteria: first, that headline inflation is on a path to levels below, but close to
, 2% over 
a meaningful medium
-term horizon; second, that there is sufficient confidence 
that 
the convergence will be durable and inflation will stabilise around those levels; third, 
ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 7 / 2017
 Œ Boxes
 The recalibration of the ECB™s asset purchase programme
 27 that inflation developments will be self
-sustaining, meaning that the trajectory will be 
maintained 
despite
 diminished support from monetary policy. And finally, 
the metric 
used is euro area inflation, rather than the inflation rates of any individual country. 
The ongoing economic expansion gives grounds for confidence that inflation will 
gradually converge to the ECB
™s objective, but patience is needed. The recali
bration 
of the APP reflects the fact that, notwithstanding the reduction in the monthly pace of 
purchases, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for 
underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up and support headline inf
lation 
developments in the medium term.

 Recent trends in consumer credit in the euro area
 28 3 Recent trends in consumer credit in the euro area
 Consumer credit growth is gaining momentum.
 The annual growth rate of total 
loans by monetary financial institutions (MFIs) to households has strengthened 
further i
n the euro area in recent months, thus continuing the gradual recovery 
observed since 2014 (see Chart A). In terms of separate loan components, loans for 
house purchases remain by far the most significant contributor to overall household 
loan growth. It ca
n also be seen that consumer credit has increased particularly 
rapidly in the last two years, almost reaching the level of growth seen prior to the 
global financial crisis. However, the contribution that consumer credit makes to total 
household loan growth
 remains moderate, and below pre
-crisis levels. This is due to 
two factors: (i) consumer credit is a relatively low proportion of total loans to 
households; and (ii) loans for house purchases 
Œ which account for 75% of total MFI 
loans to households 
Œ have 
continued to increase in recent years.

 Higher volumes of consumer credit are supporting the demand by households 
for durable goods.
 The strengthening of consumer credit has been driven by 
increased take
-up of new medium
- and long
-term c
onsumer credit loans (see Chart 
B), which exceeds the volume of maturing consumer credit loans by a significant 
margin. Consumer credit is primarily used to finance purchases of big
-ticket items 
such as furniture, household appliances and motor vehicles. T
he increasing demand 
for such items, and for consumer credit to finance them, has been supported by a 
return of confidence among households following the broad
-based recovery in the 
economy and the improved labour market situation, as well as by record low
 bank 
lending rates. These developments have been buttressed by the ECB™s 
accommodative standard and non
-standard monetary policy measures. Such 
monetary policy measures, together with the recovery, have considerably reduced

 The strengthening of consumer c
redit is broadly based across countries in the

in and, to a lesser extent, in Italy, 
since mid
-2015. In Spain, consumer credit is growing at double
-digit rates (see Chart 
C). These robust dynamics should, however, be seen against the background of the 
strong and protracted decline in bank credit that t
ook place during the euro area 
financial and sovereign debt crises. Consumer credit is the only private sector loan 
component to display a positive annual growth rate in Spain. In Italy, consumer credit 
accounts for half of the annual growth in total MFI l
oans to households. By contrast, 
the annual growth rates of consumer credit remain relatively moderate in Germany 
and France.

 1 China™s economic growth and rebalancing and the 
implications for the global 
and euro area economies
 After four decades of remarkable performance, China™s economic expansion has 
begun to slow, while the imbalances in the economy have widened
. Rapid 
investment and 
rising 
indebtedness have created vulnerabilities in a number of 
sectors. 
Those 
risks have been amplified by increased complexity 
and leverage 
in 
the financial system.
 China retains policy space to cushion against 
potential adverse 
shocks, but
 additional 
rebalanci
ng and structural reforms 
could facilitate a shift of 
China™s economy onto a 
sustainable 
and strong growth 
trajectory 
in the medium 
term
. China™s size, trade openness and dominant position as 
a consumer of 
commodities mean that its transition is crucial fo
r the global outlook.
 Compared 
with
 its role in global goods and commodit
y markets, China™s integration in global 
financial markets is considerably 
low
er but growing.
 Simulation analysis using global 
macro models 
suggest
s that the 
spillovers to the 
euro ar
ea would be limited in the 
case of a 
modest slowdown in China™s GDP 
growth, 
but 
significant in the case of 
a sharp adjustment.
 However, sensitivity analysis underscores that the spillovers are 
dependent on the strength of the various transmission channels
, as well as the policy 
reaction
s by central banks and governments.

 Output has expanded at close to 10% per year on average 
since 1980. China has 
become the world™s second
-largest economy and the largest 
trading nation, raising living standards and reducing poverty in the process.
 China™s impressive economic performance was founded on a combination of 
strong productivity gains and factor 
accumulation.
 An initially low capital 
endowment and high returns on capital provided strong incentives for firms to 
invest.
8 Sweeping reforms, such as the development of the private sector initiative in 
the 1980s, the reform of 
state
-owned enterprises (
SOEs) in the 1990s, and China™s 
accession to the World Trade Organi
zation in 2001, led to strong productivity gains. 
Industrialisation also benefited from an ample labour supply linked to China™s fast
-rising population and the absorption of workers from the 
countryside 
into modern 
manufacturing sectors. This combination of productivity gains and factor 
accumulation allowed rapid convergence and catch
-up towards highe
r income levels.

 China™s economic growth and rebalancing and the implications for the global and euro area 
economies
 33 Yet 
China is increasingly confronting two interlinked challenges
: slowing 
gro
wth and rising imbalances.
 Having 
stood
 at over 14% in 2007, GDP growth 
slowed to around 7% last year. 
Much of the slowdown has been structural because 
the tailwinds that supported China™s rapid convergence are gradually diminishing. 
Compared 
with
 an avera
ge of around 10% during the 1990s and 2000s, the literature 
finds potential growth to have decreased to 7
-8% in recent years (Chart 1).
9 Falling 
productivity growth and diminishing returns imply that China is bumping against the 
limits of 
its
 traditional
 growth model.
 To secure 
prospects 
over the medium
 term, 
China 
needs to reform and find new sources of growth.
10 However, t
he challenge of 
transitioning from middle
- to high
-income status is amplified by widening imbalances. 
In particular, China has relied he
avily on investment and credit to drive growth in the 
past decade. 
Those imbalances increasingly pose risks to the outlook.

 China™s economic growth and rebalancing and the implications for the global and euro area 
economies
 34 change
 and reform. The fourth section 
analyses 
the implications of 
economic 
changes in China 
for the rest of the global economy
 and the euro area economy
. 2 China™s imbalances
 Although 
China™s unbalanced economic structure has been a subject of 
international policy discussion for some time
, 
in
 recent years the nature of 
those imbalances has changed.
 Faced with a shortfall in external demand and 
slowing growth in the wake of the global financial crisis, China™s government 
responded by boosting domestic investment. The combination of the weaker g
lobal 
environment and the investment surge led to a substantial correction of China™s 
external imbalances, particularly the large current account
 surplus
, which had 
peaked at
 close to
 10% of GDP in 2007. This, however, came at the expense of an 
increasingl
y skewed domestic economic structure 
Œ specifically a heavy dependence 
on investment, rising indebtedness and increased risks in the financial sector
. Underlying both the previously high external imbalances and 
the 
current 
internal demand imbalance is Chin
a™s exceptional
ly high saving rate.
 Gross 
national savings represented 
46% of GDP in China in 2016 
Œ one of the highest 
saving rates 
in the world.
11 This
 reflect
s a variety of factors including
 demographic 
trends
, social policies that have limited the provi
sion of 
welfare and health
 care, 
and high income and wealth inequality. 
Low deposit rates 
and capital account
 restrictions
 that weigh on investment returns for households
 negatively affect the saving rate
. 
In 
some sectors, r
isk pricing and capital 
allocation
 have been 
skewed, allowing strong 
domestic 
investment and debt accumulation. Thus, although the 
patterns 
of China™s 
macro imbalances ha
ve evolved
, the root causes are similar.
 This section discusses the recent evolution of China™s imbalances and
 the 
risks they pose to the economic outlook.
 Section 2.1 outlines China™s 
heavy
 reliance on investment and credit as drivers of growth
 and the vulnerabilities this has 
generated
. Section 2.2 discusses how the rising complexity of the financial system 
coul
d make the economy more susceptible to domestic cris
es. 2.1
 Heavy
 reliance on investment and credit
 Investment has been particularly strong in China since the late 1980s.
 The 
share of investment 
in GDP has progressively increased from around 30% in the 
1980s to 
over 
45% on average after 2009. In some respects, high investment rates 
have reflected China™s fast pace of economic growth and the low initial capital 
endowment. 
Yet, w
hile a number of Asian countries 
have 
adopted similar 
development strategies base
d on 
rapid capital accumulation in the past
, most of 
these countries have typically registered investment rates considerably 
below 
                                                                    11  For a discussion of China™s saving rate, see

 35 China™s current share (Chart
 2). 
More recently, there has been 
a gradual, albeit slow, 
rebalancing from investment towards co
nsumption. The investment
-to
-GDP ratio has 
fallen 
from the 
peak in 2011.
 Yet, it remains high by international standards. 
Moreover, t
he capital stock
-to
-output ratio has 
continued to 
rise and 
this rise 
has 
been accompanied by a declining marginal return on
 capital and a diminishing 
impulse from investment to economic growth.

 Notes: For each country
, GDP per capita is relative to US GDP at each respective point in time.
 High investment rates have 
also 
been accompanied by a 
sharp
 increase in 
indebtedness
. The surge in credit 
began in 2009 
as 
the 
authorities sought to 
sustain high investment in the face of falling corporate profits and savings. Corporate 
debt accounts for the bulk of the increase. Although household debt remains more 
modest, lending to households, particularly mortgage lendi
ng, has risen sharply in 
the past two years. More recently, credit 
growth 
has slowed but it stil
l outpaces 
nominal GDP growth.
 Both the level and the rate of growth of debt are exceptional for a country at 
China™s stage of development.
 China™s private 
non-financial
 sector
 debt to GDP, 
now at 211%, 
is high
 relative to other 
emerging market economies (EMEs) and 
comparable to levels in many advanced economies. Rapid credit growth has often 
been a precursor to a financial crisis
 (Chart 3)
. Even in countries tha
t have avoided 
full
-blown crisis, post
-boom growth tends to suffer 
from 
a marked step
-down
 after the 
end of a credit boom.

. Rapid investment and increasing indebtedness have created vulnerabilities 
in 
a number of sectors in China.
 The risks extend across the corporate sector, SOEs, 
local governments and the real estate market.
 In 
the corporate sector, 
rising 
leverage and 
expand
ing 
capacity 
have 
weakened balance sheets and profitability.
 Since the global financial crisis, 
capacity 
has expanded rapidly
 in several industries
 and well ahead of market 
demand. Despite the modest rebound in recent months, surveys suggest that 
capacity 
utilisation rates
 across industries remain below pre
-crisis levels (Chart 4). 
Excess capacity has been particularly problematic in some heavy industries such as 
steel
, aluminium, cement, flat glass and shipbuilding.
13 Excess capacity has affected 
corporate 
profitability. Growth in profits in the industrial sector has been weak in 
recent years. A
nalysis of firm
-level data suggests there is a 
significant
 share of listed 
firms for wh
ich profits are insufficient to cover interest payments
 (Chart 5)

 Vulnerabilities in the corporate sector have been driven particularly by state
-owned enterprises
. With 
preferential access to credi
t and implicit state guarantees,
 SOEs 
have 
been a primary driver of 
the increase in leverage and investment in 
recent years. In the wake of the global financial crisis, 
high investment by SOEs 
act
ed as a significant counter
cyclical force against 
falling global 
demand.
14 However, 
the consequence has been declining profitability, with the 
return on assets 
of SOEs 
in the industrial sector falling well below 
that of 
private
 sector counterparts

 The state sector has 
also 
played an important role through 
rapid infrastructure 
expansion by

eable part of the investment since the 
global financial crisis has been 
infrastructure investment mostly by local

 39 Risks have also increased in the real estate sector.
 Real estate investment has 
been one of the main drivers of China™s rapid investment growth in recent years
 (Chart 8). 
A number of factors have 
supported strong housing demand, including the 
process of urbanisation 
and the need to upgrade dwellings. Solid household income 
growth, high saving rates and limited alternative investment options have also made 
real estate an attractive asset for househo
lds in comparison to bank deposits and the 
stock market.
 Yet there are signs of 
possible imbalances
. China™s real estate boom 
has been accompanied by 
rapid 
property price
 increases
. In real terms, 
estimates of 
a quality
-adjusted price index for residential
 property in 35 major Chinese cities 
increased by 10% per year between 2006 and 2014.
15 By contrast
, 
in smaller cities, 
despite some improvement over the past year, oversupply in the real estate market 
remains a concern
, with still sizeable unsold inventori
es held by developers
. Given 
China™s heavy reliance on real estate, a downturn in the real estate market could 
significan
tly impair its broader economy.

 Rising leverage and complexity in the financial sector
 The risks associated with fast
-rising indebtedness have been amplified by 
increased complexity in the financial system.
 Banks remain the primary source of 
credit in China and their assets have grown substantially since the global financial 
crisis. At the same time, non
-bank or 
ﬁshadow banking
ﬂ activities have also 
increased,
 wit
h credit from non

around 70% of GDP by 2016

9 Total social financing
 (as a percentage of GDP)
   Sources: CEIC and ECB staff calculations.
 Notes: Total social financing is a measure 
used b
y the People™s Bank of China 
of the 
aggregate provision of financing to the economy.
 Total social financing also includes equity financing.
 Increased non
-bank financing has widened the sources of credit for firms but 
has given rise to new risks.
 Non-bank f
orms of finance can have advantages if 
they provide firms and households with alternative sources of funding and promote 
financial inclusion. In China™s case, new ch
annels of non
-bank financing have
 been one means of enabling financial liberalisation. 
Howe
ver, such activity has 
increasingly 
reflected regulatory arbitrage, 
with institutions 
aiming to 
minimise 
regulatory oversight and reduce 
(or avoid) 
the impact of 
capital
, 
provisioning 
and liquidity requirements.
 The risks 
associated with shadow banking 
extend across the financial system
. Banks are exposed to shadow
 banking products through outright and implicit 
guarantees. 
Banks own and operate many of the 
non-bank 
structures
 and are 
potentially liable for losses on shadow
 banking investment products they have 
marketed. 
For example, a
lthough banks do not have direct liability 
for
 so-called 
wealth management products (WMP
s), implicit guarantees suggest 
they may feel 
obliged to compensate investors in the 
event of default. Gre
ater interconnectedness 
between the shadow 
banking 
and banking sectors is also reflected in the rapid 
expansion of borrowing in the money market, as large banks have lent to smaller 
banks and 
other financial institutions such as 
securities firms, trust com
panies
 and asset management companies. Finally, banks have increasingly used shadow 
structures to shift traditional lending activity out of their banking book. These so
-called 
ﬁshadow loans
ﬂ comprise a claim on products structured by trust or securities 
companies, packaging together loans or bonds. Banks classify such exposures as a 
claim on a financial institution which lowers the capital charg
e and provisioning 
requirement.
 Rapid credit expansion could imply heightened risks for the 
banking system.

economies
 41 reported non
-performing loans for the aggregate banking sector are very low at 
around 1.7% of total l
ending
 in 2016
. 
Yet, a
nalysis of firm
- and bank
-level data 
suggests that estimates
 of the debt at risk 
Œ i.e. the proportion of firms with low 
interest coverage ratios 
Œ could be higher
.16 Shifts in saving behaviour have also increased funding, liquidity an
d counterparty risks for banks, particularly smaller institutions.
 The low deposit 
rate 
environment and 
the 
proliferation of alternative saving products, such as WMPs, 
have encouraged 
greater mobility of 
savers
 who are increasingly seeking higher 
returns
. 
However, the situation differs across banks. With strong expectations of 
implicit state support, the five largest 
banks continue to receive the bulk of retail 
deposits. By contrast, with a much lower expectation of state support, smaller banks 
are sufferin
g more from the shift in saving behaviour and have become increasingly 
dependent on wholesale funding to fund rapid asset growth. And they have 
increasingly relied on central bank liquidity provision
: bank borrowing from the 
People™s Bank of China
 has doub
led in the past two years, reaching 16% of GDP by 
the end of 2016. The squeeze on funding has affected net interest margins and 
the 
profitability 
of 
small banks.
  Overall, therefore, while the banking sector appears healthy in aggregate, 
there are large 
variations across institutions.
 The five 
largest 
banks continue to 
attract deposits and are net lenders in the interbank market. They have expanded 
less aggressively, 
have 
accumulated fewer shadow loans and have minimal off
-balance
-sheet exposures, which m
eans reported regulatory ratios are much more 
representative of their liquidity and capital needs. Risks are significantly higher 
outside the big
-five banks. Mid
-sized and smaller banks 
bear
 a disproportionate 
share of the credit and funding risks, with la
rger shadow loan portfolios and off
-balance
-sheet WMP exposures, weaker profitability and a greate
r reliance on 
wholesale funding (Chart 10).
                                                                     16  Estimates for listed firms in the Wind Economic Database as at June 2015 suggest that around 8% of 
on
-balance
-she
et lending could be classified as ﬁat riskﬂ. Debt at risk is calculated as the proportion of 
the debt of listed firms with an interest coverage ratio below one.

 3 The prospects for transition and reform
 Although vulnerabilitie
s have grown, China retains policy space to cushion 
against 
potential 
adverse shocks.
 China has high national savings
, large foreign 
exchange reserves
 and a curr
ent account surplus, which help
 to shield it against an 
external funding crisis. 
An 
estimate of
 augmented general government debt, which 
accounts for contingent liabilities and off
-balance
-sheet local government borrowing, 
has risen in the past five years but, at 
around 60% of GDP
, affords some space to 
react to emerging shocks
.17 Moreover, d
espite s
lowing growth, the interest rate
-growth differential remains favourable. The government also has significant public 
assets including the stock of foreign exchange reserves (despite the declines in the 
past two years). 
Importantly, t
he government also retai
ns levers to manage the 
economy, particularly through its c
lose links with SOEs and banks.
 However, 
additional 
rebalancing 
and reform could help to move China onto a 
more 
sustainable 
growth trajectory 
in the medium term.
 In the past, s
hort
-term 
stimulus to
 bolster economic activity in the face of slowing structural growth and 
widening imbalances has 
helped to 
stabilise growth. However, continued reliance on 
such measures 
could 
eventually deplete policy buffers.
 An adjustment to the 
structure of production a
nd demand, including less reliance on investment and 
credit
-driven growth, 
could support the transition towards a more balanced growth 
path.
                                                                     17  For a discussion of calculating augmented government debt for China, see

 China™s economic growth and rebalancing and the implica
tions for the global and euro area 
economies
 43 The Third Plenum
 of the Chinese 
Communist Party in 2013 
mapped out a 
reform
 agenda
. It 
emphasised 
tackling
 imbalanc
es and 
allowing 
markets to play a 
greater 
role in allocating resources. Since then, and especially in 2016 when China 
chaired the G20, liberalisation of the
 financial system has continued. In recent 
months, the government has placed increased emphasis on t
ackling financial 
stability risks, with regulatory measures to increase scrutiny and recognition of risks 
in the shadow banking sectors. A
dministrative reforms are improving the business 
environment
. F
iscal measures are 
also 
starting to put local governmen
t finances on 
a more even keel. 
Steps towards reforming the role of 
SOEs
 in the economy are 
proceeding more slowly, although the government has initiated reforms to address 
governance issues
. 
The measured approach towards economic reforms in part 
reflects 
that reforms can entail a 
trade
-off between 
greater variability in
 short
-term 
growth and 
achieving 
medium
-term stability. 
The 
reduc
tion and loosening of
 annual 
targets for GDP growth
 partly acknowledge this trade
-off. The recent 19th National 
Congress of t
he Communist Party provided the government 
with 
a chance to renew 
reform momentum.
 Experience in adjusting the exchange rate regime during 2015 provides one 
illustration of the challenges associated with reform
. From mid
-2014 the 
appreciation of the US dollar and increased 
market 
concerns about China™s 
economic outlook prompted a ch
ange in expectations about the r
enminbi exchange 
rate. Significant net capital outflows from China followed as corporates repaid doll
ar 
liabilities and households sought to diversify asset portfolios. At the same time, 
the 
authorities 
aimed to 
adjust the exchange rate regime
, moving from a
 de facto
 US dollar
-based peg towards a
n exchange rate managed against a 
basket 
of other 
currencies
. The move
 prompted significant financial market volatility amid an 
acceleration of capital outflows
 and sharply falling foreign exchange reserves
. The 
situation was stabilised by a combination of 
improved communication by the 
People™s Bank of China, 
tight
er capital controls and measures to support the growth 
outlook which helped shift expectations. 
However, t
he episode 
emphasised that 
greater financial openness 
can entail more 
financial market instability
 and must be 
accompanied by exchange rate flexibilit
y to ensure monetary policy autonomy
. Such 
complex trade
-offs between short
-term stability and progress in reaching medium
-term goals 
could also 
be encountered in other areas of reform.

 added depends on final demand in China. China is one of the world™s largest 
consumers and producers of many commodities, accounting for over half of 
global

 and a high proport
ion of global energy 
consumption.

Monetary 
Fund. Compared 
with
 its role in global goods and commodit
y markets, China™s 
integration in global financial markets is considerably 
low
er, but 
experience in 
recent years has shown that 
shocks emanating from China can affect global 
financial markets
. Together, China and Hong Kong accounted for 8% of global 
gross a
sset and liability positions in 2015, although the composition of China™s 
external position, with assets dominated by reserves and liabilities skewed towards 
foreign direct investment
, may limit the potential for financial spillovers through 
balance sheet 
and valuation channels. But 
the 
events of the summer of 2015, when 
equity market and currency volatility prompted a bout of global risk aversion, have 
shown that, despite limited direct financial sector exposures, shocks emanating from 
China can affect glo
bal financial markets
 through the confidence channel
. Looking 
ahead, given the authorities™ emphasis on greater financial openness, financial 
channels are likely to become more important.

 The 
spillovers
 from 
China™s transition 
to the global 
and euro 
area ec
onomies
 To illustrate the possible adjustment paths for the Chinese economy, this 
section sketches three stylised scenarios
 (Chart 13).
 A ﬁlimited rebalancingﬂ 
scenario envisages China undergoing a gradual slowdown with some modest steps 
towards rebalancin
g the economy. In the near term, th
is would imply that the 
economy remains skewed towards investment and credit
-driven expansion, 
suggesting that 
some 
vulnerabilities and downside risks 
would 
remain. A ﬁswift 
rebalancingﬂ scenario envisages a more aggressi
ve reform effort to address existing 
fragilities
. Lower
 investment 
and credit creation imply 
weaker growth in the short
 term. 
However, o
ver time reforms 
would 
support household consumption and 
improve the efficiency of the economy, securing a more sustaina
ble medium
-term 
growth path. An ﬁabrupt adjustmentﬂ scenario foresees a sharper downturn as 
downside risks materialise. One trigger for such a downturn could be adjustment in 
the financial sector amid tightening financial conditions. Given that China retai
ns 
policy space to cushion the economy against shocks, a sharp slowdown in the near 
term is 
considered a low probability event.

13 Illustrative scenarios for China™s growth outlook
 (annual percentage changes in GDP)
  Sources: CEIC and ECB staff 
calculations.
 To understand the impact of a transition in China, 
global macroeconomic 
models are used to 
stud
y its spillovers to
 the global economy.
 The ﬁlimited 
rebalancingﬂ scenario 
is treated 
as 
the 
baseline
. This 
is first 
compar
ed with 
the ﬁswift 
rebal
ancingﬂ scenario, which envisages a
n aggressive reform effort to address 
existing fragilities
 and implies an 
additional slowdown 
in GDP of 
cumulatively 
about 
3% in 
China over three years (Chart 13
).20 Secondly
, the implications of the ﬁabrupt 
adjustmentﬂ sc
enario triggered by a sharp financial tightening are studied
; here, 
China™s real GDP 
would be
 around 9
% lower after three years
. 
To draw out the 
importance of different spillover channels, the simulations start with some key 
assumptions that are subsequent
ly relaxed. 
In particular
, it is initially assumed that: 
(a) trade and financial linkages are in line with past averages; (b) 
oil
 markets react 
endogenously; (c) the spillovers from 
China™s 
financial markets 
to the rest of the 
world 
are limited; and (d) mo
netary policy 
in China 
is constrained
, with 
the 
authorities 
following a managed exchange rate regime.
21 The 
simulations are carried out using 
the 
ECB
-Global 
model and 
are cross
-checked with a range of structural and non
-structural global models including the IMF™s 
global model (GIMF), 
the 
Oxford 
Economics 
global model 
(Oxford) 
and, for the euro area, 
the ECB™s New Multi
-Country Model (NMCM)
22. 
The
 model
s have varying lev
els of detail and country 
coverage.
                                                                     20  This is simulated via a negative domestic demand shock, driven primarily by slower investment, and an 
endogenous tightening of credit and bank lending conditions.
 21  A further key assumption is that monetary policies are unconstrained outside China. In 
addition, the 
simulations assume there is no fiscal stimulus beyond the functioning of automatic fiscal stabilisers. 
The scenarios do not include possible effects from shifts in global uncertainty or confidence effects, or 
contagion to other EMEs.

 Œ Article
 China™s economic growth and rebalancing and the implications for the global and euro area 
economies
 47 Under these assumptions, the near
-term 
model 
implication of the ﬁswift 
rebalancingﬂ scenario is 
that 
global activity
 would be depressed, although the 
effects are relatively limited, except for oil producers
. The rebalanc
ing of growth 
in China, with (import
-intensive) investment growth falling, entails a marked decline 
in global trade growth, which dampens export demand for 
China™s main trading 
partners
. Countries with closer trade linkage
s are more affected by negative sh
ocks 
from China. Oil producers™ output is also affected strongly by 
adverse terms
-of-trade 
adjustments arising from 
the decline in oil prices
 due to weaker global demand
. 
However, for commodity
-importing economies, the decline in comm
odity prices helps 
to 
cushion demand together with 
looser monetary policy.
 In ECB
-Global, 
which 
encompasses 
financial channels, the 
cross
-border 
effects are to a limited degree 
also amplified by financial markets: the rise in 
China™s 
interbank spreads and 
the 
fall 
in equity pri
ces 
weigh on
 global equity prices and 
cause an
 increase in global 
interbank spreads and risk premia. 
By contrast, in GIMF, Oxford 
and NMCM there is 
only limited modelling of the financial side of the economy which implies less 
pronounced global spillovers 
than in ECB
-Global. Yet, despite these differences, the 
results from the range of model
s are broadly similar
, suggesting that output in 
advanced economies, including the euro area, is 
lower
 by up to 0.3
% after three 
years in response to an around 3% slowdo
wn in China (Chart 14)
. These effects are 
broadly in line with the literature
, which provides a range of estimates depending on 
the 
model and scenario specification.
23 There is also downward pressure on inflation
 as a result of l
ower domestic and manufacturing cost pressures 
in 
China
, c
ombined 
with the drop in oil and non
-energy commodit
y prices 
caused by
 China™s demand

  However, the 
ﬁabrupt adjustment
ﬂ scenario, driven by significant financial 
tightening in China
, entails relatively larger
 spillovers.
 This scenario 
involves
 a deeper decline in output growth in China which inevitably has a larger impact on the 
rest of the world
 compared with the ﬁswift rebalancingﬂ scenario (Chart 15)
. However, 
the different nature of the shock also affects 
the size of the spillovers. Despite still 
relatively modest financial linkages with the rest of the world
, 
tighter financial 
conditions in China 
are assumed to raise global risk premia
. The shock in China 
therefore propagates both via the trade channel (th
rough lower domestic demand) 
and the financial channel
 and, a
s a consequence, the impact on the rest of the world 
is larger.

 Relaxing some 
assumptions about the transmission channels and the reaction

 implies stronger 
spillovers from a slowdown 
in China.
 The primary source of 
the scenario results
 is the ECB
-Global model, which 
includ
es real and financial cross
-country spillovers and therefore provides a 
framework for exploring the 
spillover 
channels in a 
more consistent manner. Chart 16
 based on the ﬁswift rebalancingﬂ scenario
 illustrates 
that 
the cumulative effect of 
relaxing differen
t assumptions 
on euro area GDP would be 
substantially
 larger
. 
The 
following sections 
consider the different channels in 
more detail.
 a) Commodity prices
 China™s effect on commodity prices could affect the size of spillovers.
 The 
range of estimates from the
 literature of the impact of a slowdown 
in China 
on oil
 and non-oil commodity
 prices is large. In the ﬁswift rebalancingﬂ scenario, ECB
-Global 
simulations 
suggest that 
oil prices 
would be 
nearly 
6% lower 
after 
three
 years, which 
is on the low side 
compared
 with
 other estimates
.25 Taking o
il prices 
as a proxy for 
commodity prices means the reduction 
could be twice as responsive to shifts in 
China™s 
demand. With commodity prices 
responding
 more strongly
, activity in 
the 
euro area (and other 
commodity
-importing
 advanced economies
) is cushioned 
somewhat following 
a slowdown
 in China (the second bar in Chart 16)

 model.
 Notes: The scenarios are conditioned on the same slowdown in China
™s GDP (the ﬁswift rebalancing
ﬂ scenario). The 
bottom 
bar shows 
the deviation of euro area real GDP from the 
ﬁlimited rebalancing
ﬂ scenario 
after three years
. Each 
bar above 
shows the effect of 
changing an assumption underlying that spillover analysis: (1) doubling the response of the oil price to fluctuations in Chin
a™s demand; 
(2) doubling the trade linkages; (3) assuming that China™
s exchange rate reacts flexibly to the slowdown in output
; (4) increasing by a 
factor of five China™s 
financial 
linkages with the rest of the world; and (5) 
taking into account 
the additional non
-linearities arising from 
combining 
the 
blocks together. The 
top 
bar shows the cumulative effect of these alternative assumptions 
on the spillovers 
to euro area 
GDP.
  b) Trade linkages
 There has been a rapid 
strengthening of 
global trade linkages with China, 
which 
has 
more than doubled its share in global trade in t
he last 15 years.
 This 
greater 
integration 
of China
 in global
 trade has also increased the potential 
for 
spillovers. However, global macro
 models 
are 
typically 
calibrated based on average 
bilateral trade linkages over the past years.
26 To illustrate that point, 
in this alternative 
scenario 
a doubling 
of the trade linkages of advanced economies with China
 is considered
, which broadly corresponds 
to
 the 
increase in direct trade flows from 
advanced economies to China from 
1996 to 2016. The
 impact of shocks in China on 
the euro area 
is predicted 
to rise slightly as China™s 
importance in global 
trade has 
increased
 (the third bar in Chart 16
).27  c) China™s exchange rate regime and monetary policy response
 Spillovers also depend crucially on th
e exchange rate regime and 
the 
monetary policy response in China. 
The ﬁswift rebalancingﬂ scenario assume
s that 
China™s monetary policy d
oes not react as the economy slows and the exchange rate 
is assumed to be 
essentially a ﬁmanaged floatﬂ against the US 
dollar. However, given 
recent reforms to liberalise the exchange rate, it 
may be more sensible to
 anticipate
                                                                     26  For example, the trade weights used in ECB
-Global are averaged over the period 2009
-15.
 27  This is consistent with Furceri, D., Jalles, J. T. and Zdzienicka, A., ﬁChina Spillovers: New Evidence

 China™s economic growth and rebalancing and the implications for the global and euro area 
economies
 51 that 
China™s 
monetary authorities partly counteract the 
adverse economic 
shock by 
lowering policy rates
. This, in turn, leads to a depreciation of 
the renminbi exchange 
rate
.28 The associated gains in China™s price competitiveness would partly offset the 
adverse implications of the swift rebalancing for activity in China. Accordingly, the 
scenario is adjusted; it calibrates a combination of gains in p
rice competitiveness 
and lower demand (in response to the 
reform effort
s), which still generates a 3% 
lower GDP in China over three years. The associated lower demand from China and 
the loss in euro area price competitiveness imply a significantly stronger
 spillover 
(the 
fourth bar in Chart 1
6), with a doubling of 
the decline in euro area GDP
 compared with a scenario assuming unresponsive monetary policy in China.
 d) Financial linkages
 As t
he 
strength
 of financial linkages 
increases, 
the impact of a slowdow
n in 
China
 on the global economy may also be stronger
. The 
baseline
 simulations 
assume 
limited financial linkages between China and the rest of the world
 resulting 
in 
small financial spillovers.
 However, China™s financial integration with the rest of the 
world is increasing
 rapidly and events during the summer of 2015 illustrate the 
potential for China to affect global financial markets
. To 
simulate 
stronger financial 
linkages with China
, the share of financial exposures 
of 
each economy
 to China is 
quintup
led and, correspondingly, the share of financial exposures to the rest of the 
world is reduced.
29 With stronger financial linkages, negative spillover effects 
on GDP in advanced economies are more than doubled
 (the fifth bar in Chart 16)
. 
 Overall, the 
model
-based 
sensitivity analysis underscores that the spillovers 
are complex and dependent on the strength of the various 
transmission 
channels
, as well as the policy reaction
s by central banks.
 Chart 16
 illustrates 
the cumulative effect of the
 various ass
umptions on the 
transmission 
channels
. 
Assuming a larger impact on commodity prices, stronger trade linkages and a more 
aggressive policy response in China leading to a 
renminbi depreciation would 
double 
the size of the spillovers
. 
Assuming 
stronger 
financ
ial linkages would 
further 
increase 
the effects. 
Non-linearities that arise from the combination of increased interlinkages 
and different policy reactions 
would have a further impact on 
euro area GDP. 
Spillovers could be even larger than in the model simul
ations if 
a worsening outlook 
in China 
were to
 trigger a synchronised downturn across EMEs
 and spillovers were 
to be dependent on policy reactions by central banks. At the same time, policy 
support in China via fiscal stimulus could theoretically cushion a
ny slowdown.
                                                                     28  After targeting a stable RMB/USD exchange rate, the Chinese authorities have liberalised the renminbi 
and now target a basket of currencies.
 29  This implies that China and Hong Kong combined would have financial
 linkages with the rest of the 
world that correspond to average financial linkages between other economies.

 China™s economic growth and rebalancing and the implications for the global and euro area 
economies
 52 5 Conclusions
 China has been the economic success story of the past four decades
, but 
economic growth has been slowing and 
vulnerabilities are increasing
. This 
article finds that China™s heavy reliance on investment and credit has led to 
incre
asing indebtedness
, which 
has created vulnerabilities in a 
number 
of sectors
, including the 
corporate sector, SOEs, local governments and the real estate market.
 These f
ragilities are heightened 
due to the 
increased complexity and l
everage in the 
financial system, in particular the 
marked increase in non
-bank lending.
 Although 
vulnerabilities have clearly grown, China retains policy space to
 cushion against 
adverse shocks. Nonetheless,
 additional rebalancing and structural reforms co
uld 
facilitate a shift of China™s economy onto a sustainable and strong growth trajectory 
in the medium term.
 China™s size, trade openness and dominant position as 
a consumer of commodities mean that its transition is crucial for the global outlook. 
Compar
ed with
 its role in global goods and commodit
y markets, China™s integration 
in global financial markets is considerably 
low
er but growing.
 This 
article has 
provided some quantification of the potential impact of a transition in China on the 
global and euro
 area economies. The simulation 
analysis suggests that the spillovers 
to the euro area would be limited in the case of a modest slowdown in China™s GDP 
growth
, but significant in the case of a sharp adjustment. However, 
the 
sensitivity 
analysis underscores
 that the spillovers are dependent on the strength of the various 
transmission channels
, as well as the p
olicy reactions by central banks and 
governments.
