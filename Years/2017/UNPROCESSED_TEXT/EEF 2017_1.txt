 FOREWORD   ix 
 Economic activity in the euro area ha
s accelerated. The pick-up 
in GDP growth in recent quarters is part 
of a fairly synchronised global upswing in advanced economies and emerging markets alike. Higher 
external demand appears to have encouraged Europe
an firms to invest more and it has dampened the 
impact of the euro's appreciation on exports so far. With investment picking up and private consumption 

still robust, domestic demand is now better balanced. 
All Member States are participating in the expansio
n and seeing improvements in their labour markets. 
The synchronisation of the business cycle has increased
, the adjustment of pre-
crisis imbalances in 
competitiveness continues to advance, and there are si
gns that the longer-term process of convergence in 
living standards has resumed. Employment creation is set to continue at a robust pace, leading to a further 
reduction in unemployment. The euro area unemployment 
rate is forecast at 8Â½ % next year. This figure, 
however, hides significant differences across Member
 States. In some, unemployment will still be much 
higher next year than before the crisis. In others, the labour market is increasingly tight. In some, GDP is 

now running significantly above potential, so
metimes accompanied by housing booms.  
At the same time, the recovery remains incomplete
 and several features of the economic expansion 
remain atypical, still scarred by the legacy of the 
crisis. Public and private deleveraging have been 
weighing on demand. Investment, 
particularly public investment, 
still accounts for a relatively low proportion of GDP. Potential growth has yet to fully 
shake off the negative impact of the crisis on the 
capital stock, employment and productivity. Most conspicuously, the outlook for inflation remains 

subdued amid sluggish wage growth. This partly reflects low productivity growth and the remaining slack 

in the labour market, as underemployment exceeds the headline un
employment rate. But low wage 
growth and inflation appear to be a feature also in many advanced economies outside the EU. This 

suggests that common factors may be at play and that 
low inflation expectations are incorporated in wage 
claims. Stronger wage growth would be an important signpost for the sustainability of the expansion, as it 

would underpin continued private consumption growth and contribute towards price stability. 
These uncommon characteristics of the recovery ha
ve important implications for the appropriate 
macroeconomic policy stance. The 
ECB has indicated that monetary accommodation will be required 
until the path of euro area inflation towards its defi
nition of price stability is self-sustained. Given the 
incomplete nature of the recovery, the broadly neutra
l aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area as a whole 
is appropriate for now. However, 
a proper differentiation across countr
ies is crucial to ensure debt 
sustainability while supporting growth and employment. The quality of public finances is vital for social 

fairness as well as stronger growth in the medium term. In Member States at risk of housing market 

imbalances, this needs to be accompanied by macro-prudential measures. As the cyclical upswing 

advances, the focus increasingly has to be on potential growth and the deployment of measures 

sometimes dubbed as 'structural reforms 2.0'. Cushioning the impact of population ageing on the 

workforce requires improving the functioning of
 labour markets and in
creasing labour-market 
participation. Reversing the decline in productivity
 growth will require better education and training, 
stimulating the take-up and diffusion of technology and improving the performance of product markets. A 

big push for the completion of the single market, including its digital and service dimensions is needed. 

The cyclical recovery has already been
 ongoing for 18 straight quarters. Only a determined effort to boost 
potential growth will allow the expansion to last and its 
fruits to be shared equitably. Moreover, structural 
convergence and the completion of EMU, including banking union, are required to make the euro area 

economy more resilient to future shocks. The Commission will make detailed proposals to this end in 

December.

 OVERVIEW: CONTINUED GROWTH IN A CHANGING 
POLICY CONTEXT Euro area labour market is strong but slack remains 
 1 The pace of economic growth in Europe surpassed expectations in the first 
half of this year, propelled by res
ilient private consumption, increasing 

support from a global upswing, loose financing conditions and healthy 

improvements in the labour market. Investment, which had been lagging, also 
shows signs of a broad-based pick-up. Very strong consumer and business 

sentiment, in a context of diminished uncertainty, suggests that this robust 
economic performance should c
ontinue in the near-term.  
Nevertheless, the cyclical recovery 
that has now been underway for 18 
uninterrupted quarters, still remains incomplete. It is also atypical given its 
dependence on policy support, the continuing presence of fiscal and financial 
fragilities stemming from the crisis, and the relatively subdued strength of 

domestic demand compared to past recoveries. Remaining slack in the labour 

market and slow productivity growth are among the factors that continue to 
constrain wage dynamics and dampen inflation. 
The recovery in the euro area is le
ss advanced than in other advanced 
economies such as the US, suggesting 
that there may be scope for robust 
growth to continue without inflationary pressures, even though the output gap 
is set to become positive. A more
 pronounced acceleration in wages, 
    The European 
economy performs 
wellâ 
âbut the recovery is 
still incompleteâ 
âsuggesting room to 
expand further.

Real GDPOverview - the autumn 2017 forecast
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  2 supported by productivity gains, would be an important signpost signalling 
the ability of the expansion to continue at a robust pace. The broad-based 

expansion of the European economy is e
xpected to continue over the forecast 
horizon but the slowing pace of job cr
eation and household 
purchasing power 
growth implies a slight moderation in momentum over the next two years. 

After climbing to 2.2% this year, the hi
ghest growth rate in 10 years, euro 
area GDP growth is forecast to moderate 
marginally to 2.1% in 2018 and to 
ease slightly to 1.9% in 2019. Given the ongoing negotiation on the terms of 

the UK withdrawal from the EU, projec
tions for 2019 are based on a purely 
technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading relations between the 

EU27 and the UK. This is for forecastin
g purposes only and has no bearing 
on the talks underway in the context of the Article 50 process. 
During the second quarter of this y
ear, global economic activity accelerated 
to its strongest pace in seven year
s, with relatively well synchronised 
improvements across both advanced eco
nomies and emerging markets.  
Growth in China outperformed expectations, while the ongoing recovery in 
economies that were previously in 
recession (Russia and Brazil) has also 
been stronger than anticipated so far 
in 2017, helped by the increase in 

commodity prices. Global growth (excluding the EU) is projected to pick up 

to 3Â¾% in 2017 and to increase further to 4% in 2018 and 2019. The 

economic recovery in emerging markets 
is expected to continue over the 
forecast horizon, driven 
by rebounding trade, beni
gn financing conditions 
and firmer activity in advanced economi
es. The pace of economic growth in 
advanced economies is expected to peak over 2017 and to moderate 

thereafter as their economic cycles mature
. This is particularly the case in the 
US, where the progressively tighter labour market should eventually boost 

wage growth. Like other advanced economies, the US economy should 

benefit from a rebound in investment and trade. Earlier assumptions about a 

boost to growth from a potential fiscal stimulus in 2018 have been 

downgraded from modest to negligible. Overall, the US growth outlook 

remains largely unchanged, at around 2Â¼% over 2017 and 2018 before easing 
marginally in 2019.  
The robust momentum in global trade that started mid-2016 looks to have 
continued in the three first quarters of this year. World imports of goods and 

services (excluding the EU) are therefor
e projected to increase by more than 
4% per year between 2017 and 2019, which is substantially stronger than 
expected back in the spring. This upward revision is predominately due to 

firming global growth but also to the assumption of a faster than previously-

expected recovery in trade elasticity as
 a result of the pr
ojected pick-up in 
investment, which is the most trade-intensive component of domestic 
demand. 
Financial markets have shown resilience since spring, supported by the 
strengthening of the global eco
nomic recovery, still accommodative 
monetary policies at the global level and investorsâ¢ continued search for 
yield. In the US, strong equity valuations have also been driven by robust 

corporate earnings growth and expect
ations of corporate tax reform. 

European stock markets te
mporarily underperformed, 
amid concerns related 
to the euroâ¢s appreciation, but the 
combination of positive macroeconomic 
developments and expectations that monetary policy will remain 

accommodative revived sentiment. On th
e bond market, euro area benchmark 

sovereign bond yields have risen only marginally since spring, while the 

broadening economic recovery has translated into a further narrowing of 
spreads.

Overview 
  3 A normalisation process of monetary policy is underway in advanced 
economies. The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time 

this year in June and restated its view that rates should continue to normalise 

as the recent subdued inflation is seen 
as transitory. In the euro area, the ECB 
has kept its monetary policy very accomm
odative. Market participants expect a first interest rate increase in 2019. Despite increased monetary policy 

divergence between the euro area and th
e US, the euro has strengthened since 
spring against the US dollar and its major counterparts against the backdrop 

of a solid economic performance and fading political uncertainty in Europe. 

The euroâ¢s nominal effectiv
e exchange rate is now assumed to appreciate by 
about 6% over this year and next.  
Bank lending to the private sector contin
ued to rise in the euro area with 
banks offering persistently very low inte
rest rates. Bank lending is expected 
to expand as banks ease their credit standards further and the net demand for 

loans increases. Furthermore, the lending capacity of banks generally has 
improved amid a further strengthening of their capital positions. But low 

profitability, non-performing loans (NPLs) and overcapacity in some 

segments of the European banking s
ector remain an issue.  Meanwhile, 
market funding also continued to expand. Remarkably for this phase of the 

cycle, they contributed as much as
 bank lending to NFCs overall debt 
funding in recent quarters. As the co
rporate sector is running surpluses 
generating substantial internal funds, access to funding does not appear to be 
a barrier to new investment and there is room to expand it further.  
Private consumption gathered further momentum in the first half of 2017. 
The nominal disposable income of households is set to increase strongly this 

year due to higher labour and non-labour incomes consistent with improved 

labour market conditions and corporate profits respectively. But higher 

inflation compared to last year is
 dampening the purchasing power of 
households and this effect is likely to be only partially mitigated by lower 

savings. Accordingly, private consumption growth is expected to decrease 

from the solid pace recorded last year. Over the next two years, as 

employment growth is projected to slow, wages to accelerate somewhat and 

non-labour incomes to continue their 
upward trend, growth in the nominal 
disposable income of households should be fairly stable. Reflecting the slight 

moderation in inflation expected in 2018 and the mild uptick in 2019, as well 

as a broadly unchanged household saving ratio, private consumption growth 
should slightly moderate next year before easing in 2019.  
In the first half of the year, investment gained momentum and even surprised 
on the upside. The outlook for corporate investment has further improved. 

Higher demand expectations, supportive financing conditions, diminished 
uncertainty, strong business sentiment, high capacity utilisation rates and 

increasing corporate profitability, as well as modernisation needs, all 

contribute to a positive setting for corporate investment. The Investment Plan 

for Europe is also expected to boost investment. The high stock of NPLs in 

some countries and the need for further deleveraging could continue to 

dampen investment growth but to a lesser extent, as both are gradually 

receding. Assuming the overall mone
tary stance remains accommodative, 
market expectations of a steepening of the yield curve should only have a 

limited negative impact on investment 
over the forecast horizon. Equipment 
investment is likely to accelerate next 
year while the near-term outlook in the 
construction sector, whose recovery only 
started last year, is also positive. 
Differences in the phase of the housin
g cycle, however, are more pronounced 
across countries, with some Member
 States experiencing signs of 
âas monetary policy 
is on the road to 
normalisation.

  4 overheating. Overall, investment is exp
ected to grow at a robust pace this 
year and next before slowing somewhat in 2019. 
Euro area exports are set to accelerate 
strongly in 2017, in line with the 
rebound in euro area foreign demand. In 2018 and 2019, export growth is 
expected to remain robust, supported by the health of foreign demand. 

Despite the euroâ¢s appreciation, the eu
ro areaâ¢s exports are set to see only a 
marginal loss in market shares, which could, to some extent, be explained by 

exporters absorbing the euro's appreciation in their profit margins. 

Notwithstanding robust import growth, net trade is projected to make a 

slightly positive contribution to growth 
over the forecast ho
rizon. The euro 
areaâ¢s current account surplus 
is forecast to fall from 3.3% of GDP in 2016 to 

3% this year, as the rise in oil prices contributes to a worsening in the terms 

of trade. It is expected to broadly st
abilise at that level 
in the outer forecast 
years.  As a result of robust growth dynamics, employment continued to expand 

strongly in the first half of the y
ear, increasing the number of employed 
persons in the euro area to the highest level ever recorded and bringing the 

unemployment rate to its lowest level since early 2009. In 2018 and 2019, 
employment creation should continue to benefit from the sustained domestic-

demand driven expansion, still moderate wage growth, as well as structural 

reforms implemented in some Member States. However, job creation is set to 

moderate as a result of the fading of temporary fiscal incentives in some 

countries and skilled-labour supply shortages in others. Furthermore, the 

current relatively high elasticity between employment and GDP growth is 

expected to decrease with a strengthening of labour productivity. With net 

job creation still significantly outpa
cing labour force growth, the 
unemployment rate in the euro area is set to drop from 10% in 2016 to just 

below 8% in 2019, with nearly half of
 this decline taking place this year. 
However, other labour market indicators, such as the relatively low level of 

working hours per employee, compared 
to its pre-crisis level, and the 
relatively high level of âinvoluntaryâ¢ part-time work, suggest persistent, but 
diminishing, labour market slack. 
Euro area inflation has oscillated between 1.3% and 2.0% in the first nine 
months of 2017, mainly as a result of energy base effects. Core inflation, 

which excludes volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, has remained 

subdued, but has been gradually rising due to increasing pipeline pressures. 
The fact that core inflation remains subdued reflects the lagged negative 

impact of a prolonged period of low inflation, as well as remaining labour 

market slack and weak wage growth. Headline inflation is projected to dip 

slightly at the start of 2018 dragged down by negative base effects in energy 

and unprocessed food prices 
but also as a result of the euroâ¢s appreciation, 
which should result in lower import prices. Given that oil prices are assumed 

to remain broadly flat over the forecast ho
rizon, inflation is projected to pick-
up gradually in the remainder of 2018 and throughout 2019. Headline 

inflation is then forecast to slow down 
from 1.5% this year to 1.4% in 2018 
and to tick slightly higher to 1.6% in 2019. While this slight upward trend is 

consistent with a projected positive outp
ut gap in 2019, the rather subdued 
inflation outlook is mainly related to the projection of increasing but still 
weak wage growth.  
âand net trade 
should contribute 
marginally to growth. 
Job creation 
continues at a robust 
paceâ 
âbut the outlook for 
inflation remains 
subdued. 
Overview 
  5 The euro areaâ¢s general government defic
it is expected to improve this year 
by more than expected in the spring forecast, since the economy is also 
expected to grow more strongly. Further,
 smaller, declines 
in the euro area 
deficit are projected in 2018 and 2019, driven by lower interest expenditures 
and lower spending on unemployment benefits as labour markets continue to 

improve. The improved outlook for nominal GDP growth and historically 

low level of interest rates translate into more favourable snowball effects that 

support the deleveraging of the public sector, with debt-to-GDP ratios 

projected to be on a downward path in 
almost all Member States. Under a no-
policy-change assumption, the euro area 
deficit-to-GDP ratio is expected to 
fall to 0.8% in 2019, while
 the gross debt-to-GDP ratio
 is forecast at 85% of GDP. 
The fiscal policy stance, as measured by 
the change in the structural balance, 
is expected to stay broadly neutral 
in the euro area as a whole over the 
forecast horizon, even though the fiscal
 stance is expected to be slightly 
expansionary in a number of Member States in 2018. Monetary conditions in 

the euro area are expected to re
main accommodative. Short-term money 
market rates are assumed to increase gr
adually in 2019 but should remain 
supportive in real terms. Nominal long term rates are assumed to trend up 

modestly, but a renewed gradual increase in long-term inflation expectations 
should keep real long-term financing costs in negative territory.  
Risks surrounding the economic outlook are broadly balanced. Downside 
risks are mainly external and mostly come from elevated geopolitical 

tensions (e.g. on the Korean peninsula) and potentially tighter global 
financial conditions. A faster or stronger-than-assumed monetary tightening 

in the US, or an increase in global risk aversion, would not only have 
important spillovers for countries with elevated leverage but could also 

impact negatively on Europe. In the medium term, relative high and rising 

corporate debt in China is increasing financial fragilities and the risk of 

disorderly adjustment, while more inward-looking policies in the US and 

elsewhere could have a marked detrim
ental impact on the global economy. 
At home, depending on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, the transition 

may not be as smooth as technically a
ssumed in this forecast. A stronger-
than-assumed appreciation of the euro, 
especially if not driven by improved 
economic fundamentals, and a faster-tha
n-assumed steepening of the yield 
curve would also constitute downside risks. On the upside, sustained 

diminishing uncertainty, improving sentiment, a faster completion of EMU 

and the synchronous rebound outside Europe could all result in a more 
durable and stronger-than-expected expansion in Europe.  
Public finances 
benefit from improved 
cyclical conditionsâ 
âwhile 
macroeconomic 

policies are set to 
remain supportiveâ 
âand risks have 
become balanced. 
PART I EA and EU outlook 
  CONTINUED GROWTH IN A CHANGING POLICY 
CONTEXT Euro area labour market is strong but slack remains 
 9 The EU economy continues to glide forward on the wings of favourable financing conditions made 
possible by accommodative monetary policies, with additional thrust from improving labour market 

conditions and stronger global growth and trade. In the first half of 2017, the EU and the euro area 

economies performed well. Propelled mainly by domestic demand, the pace of economic growth has 

picked up and the upturn has become incr
easingly broad-based across countries.  
With conditions having brightened in recent months, the flight ahead looks set to continue in similar 

style. There is plenty of domestic fuel for continued growth, including diminished political uncertainty, 

very strong sentiment, further job creation, and continued momentum from global demand. The euroâ¢s 

recent appreciation is expected to 
prove only a minor drag. Of course, there are still headwinds set to 
prevent growth in many countries from fully revivi
ng to pre-crisis speed. In some countries, this 
includes crisis legacies such as high private and public debt. Moreover, the subdued pace of wage 

growth despite robust employment creation, points not only to remaining labour market slack but also to 

low productivity growth, which could limit the pace of
 expansion in the future. Overall, the European 
economy is expected to continue perf
orming well. Real GDP in the euro area is forecast to grow by 
2.2% in 2017 (0.5 pps.higher than forecast in spring). Slowing employment growth, lower increases in 

real disposable incomes and moderating investment growth, suggest that economic growth may 

moderate slightly over the forecast horizon, to 2.1% in 2018 (0.3 pps. higher than forecast in spring) 

and 1.9% in 2019. The outlook for the EU28 has also been revised up for this year (+0.4 pps. to 2.3%) 

and next (+0.2 pps. to 2.1%). As a result of stronger growth dynamics, labour market slack is set to be 

absorbed at a faster clip than in the first years of the recovery. Since negative base effects are set to 

affect inflation also in early 2018, inflation in the euro area is expected to moderate from 1.5% in 2017 

to 1.4% in 2018, before rising to 1.6% in 2019, while the output gap is expected to turn positive. 
Europeâ¢s economic outlook is not without challenges and risks, as the policy context is changing. 
Central banks around the world have been discussing a ï¬normalisationï¬ of their policies, which could 

impact markedly on economic activity. Recent months have seen some new punitive tariffs imposed on 

global trade; the extension of such policies would have a negative impact on the global rebound. 

Changes will follow the end of the UKâ¢s membership of the EU in March 2019, the prospect of which is 

already having an impact on economic activity. Given the ongoing negotiation on the terms of the UK 

withdrawal from the EU, the projections for 2019 are based on a purely technical assumption of status 

quo in terms of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK. As regards upside risks, diminishing 

uncertainty, improving sentiment, the synchronous rebound outside Europe and the strengthening in the 

architecture of EMU could result in stronger-than-expected growth in Europe. Downside risks are 

mostly external and are associated in particular 
with assumptions about exchange rates and monetary 
policy. All in all, risks to growth and inflation projections are broadly balanced.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  10 1. PUTTING THE FORECAST INTO 
PERSPECTIVE: CONVERGENCE AND THE 
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Convergence, in its different dimensions (nominal, 
real, social, cyclical convergence and convergence 
towards resilient economic structures), acts as a 

determinant of macroec
onomic developments and 
is thus relevant in the context of macroeconomic 

projections. These dimensions, which are clearly 

interrelated, are also crucial for the socio-

economic and political sustainability of the 

European integration process 
(1) and for the well-
functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union 

(EMU). 
(2)
 Among these dimensions, convergence 
of living standards (i.e. 
real convergence) is 
already mentioned in the Treaty as a means to 

promote economic, social an
d territorial cohesion, 
which is enshrined among the Unionâ¢s 

objectives, 
(3)
 while nominal convergence has 
informed the Maastricht criteria for entering the 

EMU.  Although real convergence is not 

necessarily a pre-condition for a well-functioning 

EMU (4)
 the euro was introdu
ced to achieve the 
Unionâ¢s objectives. Cyclical convergence, as 

analysed when looking at business cycles and 

financial cycles is particularly important for the 

smooth conduct of the common monetary policy. 

Finally, convergence towards resilient economic 

structures features promin
ently in the discussion 
on the improvement of th
e architecture of the 
EMU. (5)

means to promote economic, soci
al and territorial cohesion. 
At the same time, the objective of convergence is repeated 

in the TFEU, in the legal basis for economic policy 

coordination in the Union. See Andor, L. (2014).

Unionâ¢. 
Over the longer run, real
 convergence supports the 
economic and political sustainability of the 
integration process. It also eases the identification 

of common economic policy priorities and 

coordinated policy-making. A well-functioning 

EMU can be expected to fo
ster real convergence in 
a self-reinforcing way, thanks to, inter alia, the 

removal of frictions to cross-border trade and 

capital flows, technology and knowledge transfers 

and labour mobility. 
Yet, stronger convergence in one area may not 
always be supportive of convergence in another. 

Some temporary divergence might be needed to 

address imbalances and facilitate rebalancing, 

thereby clearing the way 
for further sustained 
convergence (e.g. need for inflation rates to remain 

consistently below the 
euro area average to 
underpin rebalancing in countries which 

accumulated competitiveness gaps in the first 

decade of EMU). 
Therefore, the time horizon of adjustment and 
convergence processes and its various 

interlinkages need to be analysed carefully. This 

section reviews the main dimensions of 

convergence from the perspective of 

macroeconomic forecasts and assesses how much 

convergence has been achieved, before discussing 

if the economy is on the path of nominal and 

cyclical convergence in 
view of the present 
forecast. Special attention is paid to how 

convergence processes have been altered by the 

economic and financial crisis.   
Some convergence types are more relevant to the forecast than others  The notion of convergence captures many 
dimensions, which differ with respect to their 

relevance for short-term 
macroeconomic forecasts. 
The most popular concept of real convergence 

relates to the development of real per-capita 

income levels over time, often looking at 

developments over decades. A question more 

pertinent to the near-term is whether real 

convergence has started again, and among which 

countries, after having been interrupted by the 

crisis. Nominal variables such as inflation and interest 
rates can be rather volatile and impact on the 

effectiveness of economic policy in a monetary 

union. Not only in the run-up to stage 3 of EMU, 
EA and EU outlook 
  11 but also in the post-crisis years, a lot of focus has 
therefore been on discu
ssing nominal convergence. 
Furthermore, the extent to which country-specific 

business cycles deviate from each other is 

particularly relevant for the conduct of the single 

monetary policy, which makes business cycle 

convergence a key factor 
in short-term forecasts. 
Both nominal and cycli
cal convergence also 
deserve attention for their impact on adjustment 

processes across countries.
 The set-up in which 
real, nominal, and cyclical convergence emerge 

depends on economic and institutional structures, 

which are subject to policymaking. Finally, 

structural and institutional reforms can raise 

convergence towards resilient economic structures 

in the shorter term. This is a necessary albeit not 

sufficient condition for real convergence in the 

longer run. 
European integration, real convergence and 
GDP growth Real convergence across 
countries (or regions) 
refers to convergence in living standards, a 
dimension that is typically relevant over a 

relatively long time horizon. This section will 

analyse real convergence among Member States in 

terms of real GDP per capita (in purchasing power 

standard). 
(6)
  The analysis of real convergence across Member 

States can be based on two different concepts or 

measures: the so called âsigma-convergenceâ¢, 

which corresponds to a decrease in the overall 

dispersion across countries, or âbeta-convergenceâ¢ 

that occurs when countri
es with lower GDP per 
capita grow faster than those with higher 

(catching-up process).  Within the limits set by 

data availability, convergence patterns across 

Member States are summarised below in the 

broader context of EU developments. 
Focussing on the overall dispersion of real GDP 
per capita across Member States (sigma-

convergence), the data s
how that between 1960 
and the early 70s there 
was strong convergence 
among the countries that were at that time part of 

the EU. This was followed by a long phase of 

continued steady convergence. As expected, the 

pattern is very similar for the subgroup of

countries that became me
mbers of the currency 
union before 2007 (the euro area 12 in 
Graph I.3). 
(7) When the crisis hit in 2009 the 
dispersion of real GDP per capita in both groups 

(EU15 and euro area 12) started to increase 

significantly and remained on a rising trend until 

2012, followed by a very moderate decrease by 

2016. The dispersion of GD
P per capita is forecast 
to continue to decrease between 2017 and 2019 Å 

albeit at a somewhat slower pace among the pre-

2007 euro area Member Stat
es than in the EU as a 

whole. 
Widening the view to considering a majority of EU 
Member States, the dispersion in real GDP per 

capita showed a notable decrease between 1997 

and 2009. 
(8)
 In 2010 it increased somewhat but 
started to decrease again in subsequent years. 

Again the same pattern is observed for the 

subgroup of Member Stat
es that also became 
members of the euro area
 (euro area 19 in the 
chart). The strong decrease 
in dispersion observed 
till 2009 for both groups, EU28 and euro area 19, 

mostly relates to the catch
ing-up process of central

up of Member States that joined after 2007.

 Nevertheless, latest data show that important 

differences persist. In 2016, GDP per capita was 

about 60% of the euro ar
ea average in Latvia, 
followed by Greece (64%), Estonia (71%) and 

Lithuania (71%), while it was about 15% above 

the average in Germany, Austria and Belgium and 

23% in the Netherlands. 
Convergence of real GDP 
per capita is driven by 
various factors. In general, the lower a countryâ¢s 
initial real GDP per capita, the stronger its growth, 

implying catching-up towards leading 

economies. 
(11) Catching-up in terms of 
productivity 
(12)
 is key in this process, 
(13)
 with euro 
area Member States characterised by low 

productivity levels in 2000 also showing the 

strongest productivity growth between 2000 and 

2016, particularly in the Baltic Member States 

(Graph I.4). Over the 
forecast horizon, the 
catching-up process of these Member States is 

expected to continue albeit at a somewhat lower 

annual average productivity growth.

Monetary union, nominal convergence and 
cross-country heterogeneity in the euro area The decision on entering Stage 3 of the EMU  was 
taken in 1998 on the basis of a convergence report 

that focused on the Ma
astricht criteria and included measures of nominal convergence, such 

as inflation and long-term interest rates. 
(15)
 In the 
absence of some adjustment mechanisms (e.g. 

exchange rates, independent monetary policy), 

nominal convergence between euro area Member 

States was seen as essential to ensure the 

effectiveness of a single monetary policy. While 

the focus was put on nominal variables, it was also 

argued that financial and trade integration among 

countries entering the currency union would foster 

greater convergence, and notably a better 

synchronisation of business cycles. 
(16) After 2000, 
euro area countries actually saw converging 

inflation and interest rates. However, in retrospect, 

these developments were masking the 

accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances which 

eventually contributed to the severity of the 

financial crisis. The crisis notably brought about a 

great divergence in nominal variables. Nominal 

dispersion within the euro area is reducing again, 

raising the question of the underlying trend and 

potential risks of imbalances.  
Between 2000 and 2008, the dispersion in inflation 
rates within the euro ar
ea gradually decreased in 
spite of inflation rates wh
ich, at times, exceeded 
3% p.a. on average (see Graph I.5). Moreover, the 

reduction in the overall dispersion did not prevent 

inflation differentials between Member States from 

                                                           
(15) The complete set of convergence criteria includes also 
government debt and deficit ratios as well as the exchange 
rate stability within ERM II.

  13 being very persistent in the run-up to the financial 
crisis. In particular, Ireland, Greece and Spain 

recorded consistently higher inflation than the euro 

area average, which tran
slated into diverging 
competitiveness paths. 
(17)
 In these Member States, 
the weight of the non-tradable sector, and in 

particular construction, 
in the overall economy 
increased rapidly over the period. The drop in 

economic activity in 2009 came along with a sharp 

decrease in inflation rates, in particular in countries 

which had experienced buoyant growth prior to the 

crisis. Divergences between Member States 

increased markedly. After a temporary pick-up in 

2012, core inflation has remained depressed 

throughout the euro area up until mid-2017.  
In recent months, the core 
inflation rate in the euro 
area has gradually moved back to above the 1% 
mark amid tentative signs of reflationary forces 

taking hold. The recovery in inflation dynamics is 

expected to gain strength in the medium-term with 

a number of countries approaching 2% inflation by 

the end of the forecast period. In parallel, the 

dispersion of inflation rates should continue its 

gradual decrease. Still, inflation rates are set to 

remain consistently below the euro area average in 

countries such as Greece, Ir
eland, Italy and Spain, 
where pre-crisis core inflation rates clearly 

exceeded the euro area 
average. The recent 
dispersion of inflation rates further contributes to 

the rebalancing of competitiveness. 
The stylised picture painted for inflation (nominal 
convergence before the crisis, divergences during 

the crisis and gradual re-convergence since then), 

is even more compelling when looking at interest 

rates. Between 2000 and 2008, interest rates on

government bonds in the euro area converged up to 
a point where half of euro area Member States 

where included in a range of 30 basis points, or of 

only 10 basis points when focusing on the 12 

initial euro area Member States. This convergence 

in interest rates was partly fuelled by inadequate 

pricing of country-specific risks by financial 

markets. It resulted in large capital flows towards 

Members States with chronic current account 

deficits and mounting external debt. 
(18)
 In 2012 
and 2013, the sovereign debt crisis unfolded and 

the yield on government bonds spiked, to above 

10% in Greece and in Port
ugal and above 5% in 
six other euro area countries.  
Since 2015, long-term government interest rates 
have converged back to historical lows, notably 

due to the measures taken to tackle financial 

market fragmentation, al
so in the context of 
unconventional monetary policies (Graph I.6). 

Evidence on bank lending rates for firms and 

households confirms the convergence of financing 

conditions in the euro area. Still, in a number of 

Member States, bank lending rates remain well 

above the euro area aggreg
ate, largely reflecting 
different credit risks and the ongoing adjustment of 

financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. 

Over the forecast horizon, interest rates in the euro 

area are expected to revert
 to a slightly increasing 
path. However, they are not expected to converge 

further, suggesting that risk premia will not 

become compressed again as they were before the 

crisis.  An integrated financial sector at the euro area level 
improves financial stabilit
y in the face of country-
specific shocks and contributes to the balanced 

transmission of monetary policy. Looking at cross 

border flows in the euro ar
ea, and in particular at 
intra-euro area cross-border holdings of financial 

assets, the level of integration in financial markets 

reached a maximum in 2007. However, financial 

integration was largely based on short-term 

interbank lending and therefore not conducive to 

cross-border risk-sharing. Financial fragmentation 

gained grounds in the years following the financial 

crisis on the back of a reversal of capital flows and 

increasing home bias of investors. Since 2013, 

financial integration has been advancing again but 

remains lower than before the crisis.

  14 which decelerated in 2015, seem to have stalled in 
2016 despite the improving economic outlook. 

This puts the emphasis on the importance of the 

on-going projects to foster deeper integration, 

notably through the Banking Union and the Capital 

Markets Union. 
The business cycle, cyclical convergence and 
synchronisation The convergence of business 
cycles is important in 
a currency area because the single monetary policy 
is oriented towards the area as a whole. Amid 

strongly diverging cyclical positions it could be 

that âone size fits noneâ¢.  For this reason, cyclical 

developments across the euro area are carefully 

monitored by forecasters. While it is quite 

undisputed that monetary union is likely to foster 

economic integration among participating 

countries, the effects on business cycle 
synchronisation are less clear. The optimal 

currency area (OCA) literature has argued that 

increasing monetary integration will lead to higher 

business cycle synchronisation through closer 

trade links acting as a 
conduit for the symmetric 
transmission of common demand shocks. 
(20)
  Empirical evidence for the euro area has shown 

that business cycles have become closely aligned 

in the run-up to and during the first ten years of the 

euro. (21) The effect of the economic and financial

due to increasing cross-country-specialisation and inter-
industry trade, promoting asymmetric, sector-specific 

shocks.

crisis on euro area synchr
onisation is theoretically 
ambiguous: on the one hand, country-specific 
differences concerning trad
e and fiscal imbalances 
when the crisis hit may have led to asymmetries in 

the transmission of global shocks; on the other 

hand, the business cycles may have become more 

synchronised across countries, since all slipped 

into recession at about the same time. 
(22)
 In conceptual terms, it is important to distinguish 

between convergence in terms of (i) the variation 

of the amplitude of cyclical fluctuations across 

countries over time, and (ii) the periodicity and 

phase of the cycles, i.e. the timing of cyclical 

peaks and troughs. Larg
e differences in the 
amplitudes of national cycles (output gaps) may 

pose problems for a common monetary policy 

even if the cycles move closely in sync, since the 

required intensity of monetary policy could differ 

widely. Conversely, little dispersion in output gaps 

may be due to a general phase of subdued 

economic dynamics (âGreat moderationâ¢) and may 

thus hide the fact that individual cycles are out of 

sync Å heralding difficulties for monetary policy 

once cyclical fluctuations would gain strength 

again. Therefore, a comb
ined reading of the two 
sides of cyclical convergence is needed.  
Graph I.7 shows the variation of the amplitude of 
country-specific cycles. 
(23) It emerges that, after a 
surge around the financial crisis, where the 

economies went from boom to bust, the cyclical 

dispersion has been on 
a declining trend again

15 (with the exception of a 
temporary increase during 
the sovereign debt crisis). Nevertheless, it should 
be noted that, as pointed ou
t above, this measure is 

sensitive to the scale of the fluctuations, and thus 

might increase when the cycle gains strength, even 

if the synchronisation of cycles remains constant. 
The genuine synchronisation dimension of 
business cycle convergence
, disregarding possible 
changes in amplitude, can best be described by 

looking at the correlation of individual business 

cycles. (24) Graph I.8 shows that the 
synchronisation of euro-area countriesâ¢ business 

cycles was indeed on a marked upward trend 

(temporarily interrupted by a dent around 2004) 

before the crisis hit in late 2007. This was followed 

by a protracted period of de-synchronisation until 

mid-2014. This de-synchronisation in the wake of 

the crisis is in line with previous empirical findings 

and appears to mirror asymmetries in the 

transmission of global shocks due to marked cross-

country differences in 
macroeconomic positions 
when the crisis hit and di
fferent exposure to the 
fallout from the crisis. Th
e graph also shows that 
the de-synchronisation was less marked and set in 

later (after the sovereign debt crisis) when 

excluding some of the 
hardest-hit countries. 
(25) For the more recent period, Gr
aph I.8 shows a pick-up 
in business cycle synchronisation since 2014, 

which is projected to have strengthened in 2016-

2017. 
(26)
 (24) Intra-euro-area correlations 
are summarised by calculating 
the unweighted average of all 136 bilateral correlation 
coefficients between 17 euro area countries (excl. MT, 

SK). Correlations are cal
culated over moving 4-year 
(17-quarter) windows and are centred on the midpoint of 

the window.

(26) The data point 2015:2 characterises average correlation in 
the last observable 4-year period from 2013-Q2 to 2017-
As such, both measures of business cycle 
convergence currently 
point to an overall 
improving context for common (monetary) policy. 

The differences in cyclical amplitudes have 

diminished considerably af
ter the protracted crisis-

period.  Furthermore, the business cycles of euro 

area countries, after a long period of de-

synchronisation during and 
after the crisis, seem to 
be increasingly in sync again with the economic 

recovery gaining ground and becoming broad-

based. This is confirmed by the quarterly GDP 

forecasts over the forecast horizon. 
Deepening EMU and convergence towards 
resilient economic structures Structural and institutional features of euro area 
economies (e.g. labour, product and financial 

markets) are important determinants of nominal, 

real and cyclical converge
nce. Graph I.9 shows the 
correlation between institutional and structural 

features and GDP per capita. 
(27) Such features also 
determine the resilience of euro area economies, 

i.e. their ability to withstand shocks and recover 

quickly to potential thereafter. 
(28)
 Strengthening 
resilience entails acting on three elements: (i) 
Q2. Data points thereafter are increasingly based on 
quarterly GDP forecasts and can only be computed for 
countries where the forecast includes a quarterly GDP 
growth profile (euro area 13); the last data point 2017-Q4 

is based on observations for 2015-Q4 to 2017-Q2 and 
forecasts for 2017-Q3 to 2019-Q4. The finding of a pick-up 
in synchronisation is confirmed when using industrial 

production instead of GDP cycles and is robust to the 
length of the correlation window. 
(27) Differences in price and wage-setting mechanisms may 
lead to different reactions of output and inflation to shocks 

and to cyclical heterogeneity. CÅurÃ©, B. (2017),

  16 reducing economiesâ¢ vulnerability to shocks; (ii) 
increasing their shock-absorption capacity; and 

(iii) increasing their ability
 to recover from shocks. 
The crisis has shown that many euro area 
economies presented vulnerabilities and lacked the 

appropriate economic st
ructures to smoothly 
absorb and recover from the shock. Graph I.10 

illustrates the relation of economic structures and 

resilience: the drop of the share of total investment 

in GDP was sharper in those euro area Member 

States with tighter product market regulation. 
Convergence towards resilient economic structures 
is crucial for the well-functioning of EMU as intra-

area exchange rates are not available any longer as 

an adjustment tool against asymmetric shocks and 

inflation differentials can exacerbate real interest 

rate differentials and magnify shocks. 
(29)
 Measures 
that foster convergence toward resilient economic 

structures can further contribute to supporting

cyclical, real and social
 convergence. Since the 
start of the century, product-market regulation and, 
to a lesser extent, labour-market regulation have 

converged in the euro area  (Graph I.11). 
Economic resilience and economic and social 
convergence in the euro ar
ea could be fostered in 
particular by a deepening of the single market, 

including the Banking and Capital Markets Union, 

the coordination of economic policy under the 

European Semester and reinforced links between 

national reforms and EU funding. 
Convergence elements in macroeconomic forecasts Is the economy on a path of nominal and cyclical 
convergence? To answer this question it is 

important to consider that a degree of convergence 

is generally built into
 economic forecasts. (30) It is therefore necessary to co
nsider how the degree of 
convergence in this autumn
 forecast compares with 
the average degree of 
convergence forecast in 

previous exercises.  
There are several reasons why forecasts generally 
display some nominal and 
cyclical convergence.  
Central scenarios often underestimate the strength 

of economic dynamics, particularly to the 

downside, but also to the upside. This may relate 

to the difficulty of projecting turning points in 

economic activity amid incomplete 

information.

model-based analysis and expert judgement are

 One recent 
example relates to forecasts published during the 

global financial crisis and the missing inter-

linkages between the modelling of real and 

financial spheres at the time. 
(33)  Moreover, asymmetric temporary shocks which 

usually drive cyclical divergence 
(34)
 ex post are not reflected in baseline scenarios. This may be 

compounded by the fact that
 institutional forecasts usually rely on a set of external assumptions on 

financial variables 
(35)
 and commodity prices 
reflecting market expectations at the time, or the 

customary no-policy change assumption in fiscal 

projections. 
(36)
  Finally, forecasts may rely too heavily on 

historical relationships between different variables 

and therefore present strong mean-reverting 

properties.

the closure of the output gap may have some

explanatory role over projected growth rates in the 
outer years of the forecast.  
Probably as a result of 
these factors, nominal 
convergence (e.g. inflation) and cyclical 
convergence (e.g. real economic growth, output 

gaps) has been an inherent feature of both one-year 

ahead and two-year ah
ead projections in 

Commission autumn forecasts over the last 17 

years (see Graph I.12). 
(38) The autumn 2017 
forecast (see dashed lines) is no exception.  
However, the current forecast projects for 
2017-2019 dispersion that is below historical 

norms and falling further. This is consistent with 

an actual expected reduction in inflation 

differentials, as well as in economic growth and 

output gaps heterogeneity and suggests that the 

increasingly broad-based nature of the economic 

recovery is indeed accompanied by further 

convergence. 
Conclusion Overall, in its many dimensions, convergence 

between EU Member States remains a challenge 

and an elementary condition for a well-functioning 

EMU. Differences in economic performances are 

to some extent unavoidable

of time due to asymmetric shocks or differences in 

the response to common economic shocks; over

  18 longer horizons, inter alia, due to differences in 
productivity growth and institutions. If persistent 

and sizeable, they may tu
rn the transmission of 
monetary policy ineffective, promote permanent 

differences in potential growth, spill over to other 

countries and undermine trust in the EMU. 
(40)
 Developments in recent 
years point towards a 
partial correction of previous divergence in growth 

rates, and the current outlook is also consistent 

with such a trend. The recovery is increasingly 

broad-based across countries, translating into a 

reduction in cyclical dispersion in output growth 

rates and inflation. Over the forecast horizon, 

cyclical convergence (or a high degree of business-

cycle synchronisation) is 
expected to take place 
whereas inflation differentials tentatively point to 

an ongoing adjustment of imbalances. Whereas 

real convergence of per capita incomes takes 

longer time horizons to be assessed, it appears that 

a number of countries with below-average GDP 

per capita are again in th
e process of catching up. 

However, for real income convergence to be 

enshrined, economic structures  (e.g. both in terms 

of institutions and governance) will have to be 

reformed. 
(41)
 Strengthening economic resilience 
will be key in promoting real, social and cyclical 

convergence given its impact on the capacity to 

weather future economic shocks.

 2. EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT 
Global growth bottomed out in 2016 and world 

GDP growth outside the EU now looks set to 

strengthen to around 4% over the next two years, 

somewhat stronger than pr
eviously expected. Hard 

data available for the first half of 2017 confirm the 

pick-up in momentum, including a strong rebound 

in world trade, with improvements relatively well 

synchronised across both advanced economies and 

emerging markets. This has been supported by a 

gradual recovery in commodity prices, continued 

rapid growth in China, a return to positive growth 

in large formerly distressed economies (Brazil,

Russia) and firming demand among advanced 
economies. Uncertainty and risks to the global 

outlook remain high, but risks appear more 

balanced than in the spring. 
Global expansion gaining momentumâ The global economy performed very well in the 

first half of the year, with real GDP growth rising 

from 0.8% q-o-q in the first quarter to 1.0% q-o-q 

in the second, its strongest rate in seven years, with 

relatively well synchronised improvements across 

both advanced economies and emerging markets. 

Looking at the geographical composition, US GDP 

growth rebounded to 0.8% q-o-q after a subdued 

start in the first quarter, while the performance of 

some other advanced economies (Japan, Canada) 

has been very strong. Among emerging markets, 

economic growth in 
China outperformed 
expectations, while the ongoing recovery in 

economies that were previously in recession 

(Russia, Brazil) has been also stronger than 

anticipated so far in 2017, helped in part by the 

increasing commodity prices. 
The latest readings of 
high-frequency indicators 
from many parts of the world suggest that this 
momentum continues in the third quarter (see 

Graph I.13). All measures 
of business confidence 
improved further over the summer, with the global 

manufacturing PMI hitting a six-year high of 53.2 

in September, driven by broad-based 

improvements in both emerging market and 

advanced economies. 
Over the forecast horizon, global growth (outside 
the EU) is projected to pick up from 3.4% in 2016, 

its weakest pace since 2009
, to 3.8% in 2017 and 
4.0% in 2018 and 2019, some 0.1 pps. stronger

EA and EU outlook 
  19 of economic activity is expected to be broad-based, 
with the ongoing recovery in emerging markets 

over 2017-2019 accompanied this year by a 

rebound in growth in advanced economies (see 

Graph I.14). Strong investment, manufacturing and 

trade data are consistent with the high levels of 

business and household 
confidence currently 
observed, as well as buoyant asset markets. 
 âwith the outlook improving for advanced 
economies amid remaining uncertaintiesâ The economic outlook across advanced economies 
looks brighter now than it did in spring. Recent 

data confirm that growth has firmed up more than 

expected across the biggest advanced economies, 
including the US, Japan, Canada and dynamic 

Asian economies. Following a soft patch in the 

first half of 2016, which brought growth down to 

1.7% for the year as a wh
ole, activity in advanced 
economies excluding the EU
 is on track to rebound 
to around 2Â¼% in 2017 and 2018. There is a 

broad-based rebound in investment, manufacturing 

and trade, supported by buoyant labour markets 

and by business and household confidence at the 

highest levels in several years. A supportive policy 

mix remains in place in most economies, with 

monetary policy remaining accommodative across 

the board (despite the ï¬normalisationï¬ process 

underway), and fiscal stimulus still important in 

some economies this year (e.g. Japan and Canada). 

A gradual moderation of growth to 2.1% is 

projected in 2019, in line with the progressively 

maturing economic cycle in most advanced 

economies where growth rates are converging to 

potential. 
US economic growth is expected to firm to around 
2Â¼% over 2017 and 2018, before easing 

marginally to 2.1% in 2019. Compared to the 

spring, the assumption regarding a possible growth 

impulse from fiscal stimulus in 2018 has been 

downgraded from modest to negligible, reflecting 

the most likely political scenario of negotiations in 

Congress. Moreover, a series of natural disasters in 

the third quarter of 2017 
has changed the expected 
growth profile of the US. Third-quarter growth is

  20 now expected to be somewhat weaker but this 
should be fully offset by reconstruction-related 

stimulus in the subsequent two quarters. These two 

effects (lack of a fiscal
 impulse and a stronger 
carry-over effect) leave the projection of annual 

growth in 2018 roughly unchanged since the 

spring. 
Over the entire forecast hori
zon, activity in the US 
is expected to benefit from solid private 
consumption and investment growth, as well as a 

progressive firming of the external environment. 

At the same time, broader signs that the current 

cycle is maturing continue to accumulate, with the 

tightening of the labour market set to boost wage 

growth over the forecast 
horizon, from its current 
low level. Uncertainty persists across numerous 

policy areas including trade, fiscal and monetary 

policy, with the latter expected to continue its 

ï¬normalisationï¬ process at a somewhat more 

measured pace than exp
ected in the spring.  
The outlook for GDP growth in Japan has been 

revised substantially upward since spring to 1.6% 

and 1.2% in 2017 and 2018 respectively. This is 

due to robust domestic demand driven by 

increasingly tight labour market conditions. In 

2019, the pace of growth is expected to decline to 

1.0%, as the effect of fiscal stimulus wanes and 

fiscal policy is tightened. Furthermore, the outlook 

for other advanced Asian economies has been 

revised up as a result of better short-term prospects 

for trade with China and the region in general. The 

forecast for Canada has also improved, driven by 

stronger-than-expected domestic demand. 
âand for emerging market economies where 
the recovery is strengthening. Aggregate real GDP growth in emerging markets 
is expected to continue
 to increase over the 
forecast horizon, in line with the spring forecast, 
driven by firming growth in advanced economies, 
resilient growth in China underpinned by 

accommodative policy, rebounding international 

trade and benign global financing conditions. The 

recovery is broad-based as the pick-up in company 

profits fuels capital spending, while rising 

consumer confidence
 supports private 
consumption. Strong capital inflows to most 

emerging markets, driven by a search for yield 

among global investors and by appreciating 

currencies, are feeding equity booms and 

improving financing conditions (see Graph I.15). 

After several years of ra
pid decline, bank credit 
growth appears to be stabilising, which should 

eliminate a substantial drag on growth going 

forward. While there is now less fiscal space to 

support demand, lower inflation should allow for 

further monetary policy easing among the 

countries with relatively high policy interest rates 

(e.g. Brazil, Russia). 
The recovery appears to be well synchronised, as 
major commodity-exporting countries (e.g. Russia, 

Brazil) finally join the expansion among the 

emerging markets. Emerging Asia continues to 

grow at a robust pace, 
supported by stronger 
external demand. Growth in China exceeded 

expectations in the first half of 2017, but may 

moderate towards year-end 
due to tighter monetary 
conditions, a cooling housing market, and reduced 

fiscal stimulus. In India, the delayed impact of 

demonetisation and implementation of the goods 

and services tax in July is set to constrain growth 

in 2017, but recent stru
ctural reforms should 
support medium-term growth. Growth prospects 

for Latin America are set to improve over the 

forecast horizon on the back of a gradual recovery 

in Brazil and Argentina, supported by easier 

monetary policies and higher commodity prices. 

Growth in Russia is set to benefit from the 

stabilisation in oil prices and the strengthening of 

the rouble, which has boosted confidence. For 

most Gulf and Sub-Sahara
n Africa oil exporters, 
by contrast, oil production cuts and fiscal 

adjustment are expected
 to delay a rebound. 
Growth in the largest Sub-Saharan Africa 

economies is expected to edge up from very low 

levels in 2016, but should remain muted over the 

forecast horizon. 9095100

EA and EU outlook 
  21 Strong momentum in global trade continuesâ The strong momentum in gl
obal trade that started 
to build in mid-2016 continued during the first half 
of 2017. Some slowdown in the second quarter 

(April), largely due to the correction in China 

(following two consecutive 
quarters of spectacular 
growth), was offset by robust trade growth in the 

euro area and other advanced economies including 

Australia, Canada and Norway (Graph I.16). 

Altogether, trade volumes in the first seven months 

of 2017 were some 4% higher than in the same 

period of 2016, confirming the ongoing rebound 

from the low levels of 2015 and 2016.  
Forward-looking indicators suggest that the strong 
momentum in global trade continued in the third 

quarter of this year. The WTOâ¢s composite World 

Trade Outlook Indicator, wh
ich combines a variety 
of trade-related indices, rose in August to its 

highest level since 2011, driven by strong real-time 

data on export orders, air freight and container 

shipping.  âconsistent with the expectation of a gradual 
recovery in trade elasticity. The stronger trade momentum in the first three 
quarters of this year is in
 line with the outlook for 
an ongoing recovery in world trade over 2017 and 

2018 from last yearâ¢s exceptionally weak level. 

Global import growth (outside the EU) is expected 

to firm from 1.3% in 2016 to more than 4% over 

2017-2019, as a synchronous recovery in trade 

continues in both emerging markets and advanced 

economies. The substantial upward revisions from 

spring (1.1 pps. in 2017, 0.3 pps. in 2018) are 

being driven largely by the observed rebound in 

the formerly most distressed regions (CIS, Latin 

America and MENA), as well as strong growth in 

the US, and most other advanced economies 
including Canada, Japan and other Asian 

economies (Graph I.17), and the improved 

prospects for emerging Asia, the CIS and most 

advanced economies. 
The upward revisions to 
the trade outlook, as compared to spring, ar
e predominately due to 
firming global growth, but also relate to the 

assumption of a faster-t
han-previously-expected 
recovery in trade elasticity (Graph I.18). The 
assumed increase in trade elasticities is related to 

cyclical changes in the composition of demand, 

most notable the projected
 pick-up in investment, 
the most trade-intensive component of domestic 

demand. After years during which an investment 

shortfall had translated directly into lower import 

demand, creating one of the most severe drags on 

global trade, (43) the trend has now reversed, 
causing an increase in
 trade elasticity. The 
elasticity of imports with respect to GDP is set to 

rise from as low as 0.3 and 0.5 in 2015 and 2016 

respectively, to around 1 in 2017, where it is 

expected to hover over th
e entire forecast period. 
This should be underpinned by the projected 

cyclical strengthening in
 advanced economies and 
a related pick-up in investment, together with a 

gradual recovery in commodity-related investment 

across emerging markets.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  22 Global recovery supported by commodity 
price developments Commodity prices in general are assumed to 
continue rising over the entire forecast period but 

the prices for individual commodities are set to 

evolve differently. These developments are 

expected to occur against the supportive 

background of strengthening global activity. 
After having fallen to less than 45 USD/bbl in late 
June and having hovered around 50 USD/bbl in 

July and August, the spot price for Brent oil has 

recovered to around 55 USD/bbl. This rebound has 

been supported by a strengthening of global oil 

demand, particularly in Europe and the US, and 

production outages, mainly in non-OPEC countries 

due to weather-related disruptions (e.g. hurricanes 

in the US). Supply is set to be affected by the 

decision by OPEC and Russia to extend their 

production cuts until March 2018. The prospects 

for a rebalancing in the oil market also depend on 

future oil production growth in the US, and in 

particular on how oil price developments will 

impact on US sh
ale producers. Reflecting recent developments in oil prices, the 

technical assumptions for Brent prices are slightly 

lower than in spring, at 53.6 USD/bbl in 2017 

(-3.3%) and 55.7 USD/bbl in 2018 (-0.2%), which 

is roughly 20% higher th
an the average in 2016 
(Graph I.19). Due to the appreciation of the euro, 

the revision of the assumptions from spring is 

markedly stronger in euro terms (by about 9% in 

2017 and in 2018). In 2019, oil prices are assumed 

to fall slightly to 54.7 USD/bbl (46.4 EUR/bbl). 
Metal prices are assumed to rebound strongly in 
2017, and to remain rather stable in 2018 and 

2019, as highly competitive metal producers seek 
to preserve their market 
shares. Food prices are 
projected to remain broadly stable as successive 

bumper harvests in recent years have led to the 

accumulation of large record stocks. 
Risks have become more balanced Uncertainty and risks to the global outlook remain 

high, but risks appear more balanced than in the 

spring. Although the short-term outlook in China 

appears benign, relatively high and rising 

corporate debt is increasing financial fragilities and 

the risk of a disorderly adjustment. 
Among emerging market economies more broadly, 
elevated political and policy uncertainty present 

major downside risks. 
A faster-than-expected 
tightening of monetary policy in the US and 

associated monetary policy divergence across 

advanced economies or a widespread re-

assessment of risk premia in asset prices could 

have important spillovers in terms of capital flows, 

financial market stability, and financial conditions, 

with particular risks for many emerging markets 

that have accumulated large, unhedged USD 

liabilities. It could also affect the US as a major 

stock market correction could result in a number of 

economic outcomes turn
ing out worse than 
expected. 
Further downside risks are related to geopolitical 
tensions in several parts of the world, including 

North Korea. Upward surprises could occur if a 

sustained virtuous circle of investment, trade and 

growth takes hold in emerging markets.

  23 3. FINANCIAL MARKETS 
Global financial markets have continued to show 
resilience, supported by the gathering momentum 

in the global economic r
ecovery, the presence of 
still accommodative monetary policies at the 

global level, and the risk appetite of investors for 

returns in a bond market where risk-free rates are 

still negative in many segments. Volatility in most 

asset classes has remained very low since spring 

despite still elevated geopolitical and policy 

uncertainty in several parts of the world. 
Lasting monetary accommodation but changing expectationsâ Monetary policy has remained very 
accommodative in the euro 
area this year even 
though expectations of a limited recalibration of 

the ECBâ¢s monetary policy had risen during the 

summer. Against its view that risks to the growth 

outlook had become broadly balanced and that the 

likelihood of very adverse contingencies had 

diminished, the ECB Governing Council in June 

removed the easing bias on policy rates from its 

forward guidance. Moreover, at its meeting in 

September, the Governing Council had signalled 

that it would take decisions on a recalibration of 

monetary policy before the end of the year. But as 

the ECB Governing Council confirmed all the 

other elements of its forward guidance, including 

the implied sequencing of policy instruments, 

market expectations were for a first increase in 

policy interest rates not before 2019. 
The need for some withdrawal of monetary 
stimulus has also been under discussion in recent 

months in EU countries outside the euro area, 

particularly in the UK
. The Czech central bank 
raised interest rates in August for the first time 

since the beginning of the financial crisis, and the 

Romanian central bank narrowed its interest rate 

corridor in September. In Hungary, policy rates 

were cut in September. Swedenâ¢s Riksbank, by 

contrast, decided in September to keep its 

monetary policy expansionary, so that inflation 

could reach the rate of 2%. 
In the US, the Federal Reserve delivered a second 
interest rates hike in June this year, bringing the 

target range for the federal funds rate to 1.00-

1.25%. Over the summer, 
market expectations of 
further ï¬normalisationï¬ 
(44)
 of monetary policy in 
                                                           
(44) The term ï¬normalisationï¬ s
hould not be misunderstood as 
returning to what has been 
seen before the economic and 
the US in 2017 had been scaled back against the 

backdrop of weaker-than-expected inflation and 

uncertainty about the governmentâ¢s fiscal plans
. Following the meeting of the US Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) in September, market 

expectations increasingly priced in an additional 

policy rate increase of 25 bps. by the end of this 

year. The FOMC indeed considered the recent 
weakness in inflation as transitory and continued 

to judge that further normalisation of the Federal 

Reserveâ¢s policy rates was needed, despite the 

negative short-term impact of recent hurricanes on 

the economy. FOMC members continued to 

forecast one more rate hike this year, three hikes in 

2018 and at least two more in 2019. Most 

importantly, at the same time, the FOMC also 

decided at its September meeting to start gradually 

unwinding its balance sheet in October this year. 

This would be done according to the normalisation 

plan unveiled at the June meeting. 
(45)
 âwhile the improving economic outlook 
supported the euro. With the euro area econo
my performing solidly 
and political uncertainty fading, the euro has 
strengthened against its major counterparts since 

spring, As a result, the euro has appreciated by 

about 6% in nominal effective terms since mid-

April this year. This has also taken place in the 

context of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding 

Brexit and the policy-mix outlook in the US, as 

well as renewed geopolitical concerns related to 

developments on the Korean peninsula.  
Between April and September, the euro 
appreciated strongly ag
ainst the US dollar 
(Graph I.20) and the Japanese yen. Since 

September, it has stabilised somewhat against the 

US dollar as the latter benefitted from expectations 

of a corporate tax reform and a reassessment of 

market expectations about the future path of US 

monetary policy. The euro also appreciated 

substantially against the pound up to the end of 

August before retracing
 back somewhat in

Haan and D.-J. Jansen (2017).

(45) This entails a series of caps for its reinvestments: payments 
will only be reinvested to the 
extent they exceed a steadily 
increasing set of caps. The caps were initially set at USD 

6bn per month for the US Treasuries and USD 4bn for 
agency mortgage backed secu
rities (MBS). They will be 
thereafter steadily raised every three months until they 
peak at USD 30bn for Treasuries and USD 20bn for MBS. 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  24 September amid increasing expectations that the 
Bank of England could start tightening its 

monetary policy this year. The euro recorded gains 

against the currencies of most emerging market 

economies, including the Russian rouble and the 

Turkish lira, but remained broadly stable or even 

depreciated somewhat against some Central and 
Eastern European currencies
 (i.e. the Czech koruna 
and the Hungarian forint). These developments 

have entered the technical assumptions underlying 

the forecast (Box I.4). 
Global financial markets are thriving with low volatility  Euro area benchmark sovereign bond yields have 
moved narrowly since spring, climbing marginally 

higher. Long-term bond yields found support from 

positive macroeconomic data releases and rising 

expectations of a gradual removal of monetary 

stimulus by the ECB. However, the upward 

movement in yields has been moderate, given the 

subdued rate of inflation seen in most of the euro 

area since spring. Meanwhile, most euro area 

sovereign bond spreads have further narrowed, 

benefitting from the broadening economic 

recovery, which has sparked a renewed appetite for 

euro area bonds, including from foreign investors. 

Several countries also benefitted from credit rating 

or outlook revisions by credit rating agencies (e.g. 

Portugal, Spain, and Italy). However, political 

risks continue to impact on spreads, as reflected in 

the recent widening in some EU sovereign bond 

markets (Graph I.21). In the US, Treasury yields 

have also fluctuated, althou
gh they are in currently 
close to where they were back in spring. 
Several leading stock market indices reached 

record highs in recent months, with equity 

valuations in the US reaching new all-time highs in 

response to robust corporate earnings growth and 

expectations of fiscal stimulus measures. By 

contrast, the performance of European stock 

markets has been relatively muted because the 
appreciation of the euro 
has somewhat clouded the 
earnings outlook for euro-area listed multinationals 

(Graph I.22). More recently, the combination of 

positive macroeconomic data releases and 

expectations that monetary policy will remain 

accommodative, have lifted sentiment and prices. 
Corporate bond spreads have narrowed moderately 
over the past few months, helped by bond 

investors venturing into new bond segments and 

down the credit quality spectrum in search of yield 

(Graph I.23).

EA and EU outlook 
  25 Bank lending continues to expand amid very low bank interest ratesâ Net lending flows to households and non-financial 
corporations (NFCs) continued to be positive 

overall in the euro area, resulting in a +2.7% 

annual growth rate for households and a +2.5% 

annual growth rate for NFCs in August 2017 

(Graph I.24). However, loan growth to NFCs 

varies considerably among euro area countries. 
Credit growth has increased, but remains moderate 
by historical standards and lower than nominal 

GDP growth. The fact that bank interest rates are 

still very low (Graph I.25) is a major supporting 

factor for lending volumes in the euro area. 

Meanwhile, differences in the interest rates 

charged for loans have narrowed further since 

April across the euro area. Such developments 

suggest that the ECBâ¢s accommodative monetary 

policies are being more effectively transmitted 
through the euro area banking system and the 

wider economy. 
The ECBâ¢s July bank lending survey (BLS) 
confirmed the positive trend in bank lending. It 

indicated that credit standards in the euro area 

eased in 2017-Q2 for both loans to enterprises and 

to households for house purchase, driven mainly 

by competitive pressures and by banksâ¢ risk 

perceptions for housing loans. Meanwhile, loan 

demand continued to improve for all loan 

categories thanks mainly to the low general level 

of interest rates, a pick-up in fixed investments and 

favourable housing market prospects. According to 

the survey, banks expected 
to continue easing their 
credit standards in 2017-Q3 and to see a further 
increase in net loan demand 
for all types of loans. 
The ongoing improvements
 in the euro areaâ¢s 

banking sector have facilitated the transmission of 

the ECBâ¢s accommodative monetary policy. In the 

bank lending survey, euro area banks reported a 

further strengthening of their capital positions in 

adjustment to regulatory or supervisory actions in 

the first half of 2017. Banks also reported 

improvements in access to both retail and 

wholesale funding during 2017-Q2, and expected 

this to continue to improve in the next quarter. 
Higher profitability and lower levels of non-
performing loans (NPL) have helped to push up 

bank equity valuations although overcapacity and 

cost inefficiencies in some segments of the 

European banking sector are expected to continue 

weighing on bank profitability.
(46)
 EU banks on 
average still have a return on equity below their

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  26 cost of equity, which suggests that investors still 
take a cautious approach to valuing banksâ¢ assets 

and are still rather pessimistic about future 

profitability levels. Indeed, interest-based income, 

traditionally the main source of income for the 

majority of European banks, has become 

structurally low in an 
environment characterised 
by a flat yield curve. Monetary policy 

normalisation, leading to 
steeper yield curves, is 
therefore likely to have a beneficial effect on bank 

profitability.  
âwhile the contribution of market funding continued increasing in the euro area. Monthly net issuance volumes of corporate bonds 
have risen further since spring, leading to an 

annual growth rate of +9.3% in August. 

Meanwhile, equity net issuance has remained more 

moderate with an annual growth rate of 0.6%. 

Historically, market funding tends to make up for 

the weakness in bank lending during crisis periods, 

cushioning somewhat the funding cycle, which is 

traditionally bank-based in
 the euro area. Since 
2015 though, both bank lending and market 

funding have been growing and contributing 

equally to overall NFC debt funding, despite an 

uptick in the economic cycl
e (Graph I.26). This 

suggests that non-financial companies have 

adopted a more market-oriented and less bank-

based funding structure even during periods of 

economic expansion.  
Access to funding does not seem to be a barrier for 
either corporate or household investment, a 

situation that is expected to continue over the 

forecast horizon. In ad
dition, the euro area 
corporate sector continues to run surpluses, 

generating substantial internal funds which could 

potentially be used to fund investments. 
4. GDP AND ITS COMPONENTS 
The EU economy continues to glide forward on the 

wings of favourable financing conditions made 

possible by accommodative monetary policies, 

with additional thrust from improving labour 

market conditions, rising confidence and stronger 

global growth and trade. 
(47)
 The economies of the 
EU and the euro area performed strongly in the 

first half of 2017. Propelled mainly by domestic 

demand, the pace of economic growth has picked 

up and the upturn has become increasingly broad-

based across countries. 
Since the trough in economic activity in the first 
quarter of 2013, the European economy has been 

growing without any interruption. The economic 

recovery has lifted economic output in both the EU 

and the euro area above the levels reached before 

the euro area recession 
of 2011-2013 and also 
above the levels seen before the Great Recession in 

2008-2009. The scale of these achievements raises 

questions about the current cyclical position of the 

economy and what follows from this for the 

forecast years 2017-2019. 
Still a subdued recovery in comparison to previous cycles... The recovery since the second quarter of 2013 has 
been subdued and weaker than other recoveries 

(Graph I.27, first panel), including the recovery 

that immediately followed the economic and 

financial crisis in 2009, which had already 

triggered intense discussion about the weakness of 

recoveries following deep financial and economic 

crises. (48)

  27 A closer look at the components of GDP and their 
development in comparison with past recoveries 

(Graph I.27, second and third panel) suggests that 

the main difference has been the weakness of 

private consumption. Investment growth, by 

contrast, has not fallen short in comparison to 

previous recoveries. 
(49)
 The weakness of 
consumption appears to be closely linked to high 

household debt that has constrained spending.

These findings might sound surprising against the

one has to keep in mind that it was mainly 

corrections in residential investment after the pre-

crisis boom that had pulled the 
investment-to-GDP 
ratio

minor changes in the first post-crisis years, in 2013

what has been observed 
in past recoveries (Graph I.27, last panel).  
...with features suggesting the recovery to be 
incomplete. There are several interlinke
d features that suggest 
the recovery in Europe remains incomplete. These 
include: 
â¢ Subdued domestic demand
. The recovery still 
appears to be dependent on external demand, 
which in the first half
 of 2017 became a more 
important driver of th
e acceleration. The large 

current account surplus can only partly be 

associated with the co
llapse of oil and other 
commodity prices; it also points to low 

domestic demand. Moreover, low medium-

term demand expectations may affect 

investment decisions, potentially preventing the 

accelerator from kicking 
in fully, i.e., the  
anticipation of a less favourable future is 

temporarily dampening demand.
(52)
 â¢ Fiscal and financial fragilities
. A number of 
fiscal and/or financial fragilities still impose 

challenges to the euro area. In several 

countries, high public debt and non-performing 

loans (NPL) in the banking sector signal the 

persistence of deleveraging needs. 
(53)
 Low bank profitability remains an issue, in 

particular as it can hamper the transmission of 

monetary policy. 
(54) â¢ Dependence on policy support
. The strength of 
cyclical dynamics has benefitted from the 

ECBâ¢s non-standard monetary policy and 

exceptional tailwinds (e.g. the sharp oil price 

decline); without these 
factors, the expansion 
might have been much weaker. 
                                                           
(52) This demand-side argument is
 also a key element of the 
secular stagnation hypothesis; see O. Blanchard, G.

A rebound of wages would signal a cyclical 
strengtheningâ In addition to the points mentioned above, the 
increased momentum of economic activity and the 

accompanying increase in employment has not yet 

been mirrored in wage developments; and limited 

domestic price pressures have kept core inflation 

rather flat. This has opened the floor for the 

discussion of the ï¬missing inflationï¬ puzzle 

(Graph I.28; for a detailed empirical analysis see 

Box I.2). 
(55)
 It is also one of the reasons why many 
forecasters have in recent years overestimated 

inflation despite also underestimating employment 

dynamics. The ï¬missing 
inflationï¬ puzzle may 
reflect remaining cyclical as well as more 

structural weaknesses. A cyclical explanation refers to smaller labour 
market improvements than suggested by standard 

measures, i.e. slack may suppress wage dynamics 

(see also Section I.6). 
In fact, non-standard measures of the labour 
market such as the number of underemployed part-

time workers suggest that, although declining, 

slack in the labour mark
et remains considerable. 

Data suggest that underemployment in a broad 

sense, including âinvoluntaryâ¢ part-time 

employment and temporary contracts, might affect 

almost one fifth of the euro areaâ¢s (extended) 

labour force. Alongside a possibly lower NAWRU,

EA and EU outlook 
  29 slack could be diluting the inflationary impact of 
labour market improvements. 
More medium-term explanations consider low 
productivity growth and/or positive supply 

shocks. 
(56)
 Low (labour) productivity growth is a 
corollary of the relative strength of employment 

creation observed. The shortfall of investment 

during the crisis is also likely to have reduced 

(total factor) productivity. 
Low wage growth may also be a reflection of the 
sectoral allocation and contractual features of the 

new jobs, as well as decreasing union bargaining 

power. 
(57)
 With jobs that are less secure and 
unemployment being financially more precarious, 

employees may be less willing to push for higher 

wages regardless of the unemployment rate. In 

addition, increased global wage competition as a 

result of globalisation has increased the 

substitutability between workers in the EU and 

workers outside. A similar im
pact can be attributed 
to increased automation. 
(58)
 Another reason could 
be the structure of recent employment creation 

such as an increased labour force participation rate, 

driven by higher participation of women, which 

would contribute to lower average wage growth 

due to the persisting gender pay gap. 
(59)
 Finally, the economic and financial crisis may 

have altered the link between the stabilisation of 

inflation and the stabilisation of the output gap 

(central banksâ¢ âdiv
ine coincidenceâ¢). 
(60)
 The new 
equilibrium could include a closed output gap

(58) Estimates of automatibility of occupations vary 
substantially (see e.g Acemoglu and Restrepo) and 

quantifying the impact on wage formation appears to be 
almost impossible. A first 
indication of the possible 
medium to long-term impact can be found in the IMFâ¢s 
estimate that about half of decline in the labour share of 

national income in  developed economies in the past 30 
years is due to the impact of technology. See D. Acemoglu

accompanied by a lower rate of inflation than 
before, which would have implications for the 

optimal rate of inflation. 
In this context, an acceleration of wages supported 
by productivity gains would be an important 
signpost signalling the ability of the expansion to 

continue at a robust pace. An indication that the 

recovery has entered a more advanced state would 

not necessarily say that the expansion is 

approaching its end. This conclusion is reinforced 

by the observation that ev
en the US economy in its 

more advanced cyclical position is experiencing a 

period of lacking wage pressures and low inflation 

despite strong signals of a tightening US labour 

market.

duration of the expansion in Europe. The comparison with the 
more advanced cycle in 
the US also points to the potential for an 
exceptionally long (if not fast) expansion. In that 

regard, recent research
 on the disappointing 
strength of the recovery in the US after 2009 has 

put emphasis on the slow growth of total factor 

productivity and the decline in labour force 

participation,

  30 In assessing how advanced the economic upswing 
is, an interesting insight can be obtained from a 

comparison with the economic recovery in the US 

(see Graph I.29). It sugges
ts that the euro area is 
lagging the US by a substantial amount of time and 

still has some way to go. 
(63)
 This also suggests that 
discussions about when the recovery could die of 

old age, as they are held regarding the US 

economy, 
(64) are premature. 
The relatively strong growth performance in the first half of the yearâ In the first half of 2017
, the economies of the EU 
and the euro area grew more strongly than 
expected. Euro area GDP grew by 0.7% (q-o-q) in 

the second quarter of 2017, after 0.6% in the first. 

This extended the period of successive quarterly 

growth at or above 0.6% to three quarters and 

suggests that the trend of long-lasting moderate 

growth has moved up a gear.  
Economic growth was supported by all domestic 
components (investment, private and public 

consumption), which continued to benefit from an 

                                                           
(63) The CEPR Business Cycle Dating Committee estimated 
that the euro area economy is cu

  31 level of the previous quarter and increased in 
September to levels last seen 10 years ago. The 

Eurozone Composite Output Purchasing 

Managersâ¢ Index (PMI) decreased in the third 

quarter to 56.0 (from 56.6) but the September 

reading showed a rebound in optimism. 
âwhereas âhardâ¢ data are sending more 
mixed signals. Recent hard data releases were not as spectacular 
as survey data. â¢ In August, 
industrial production
 continued to 
follow its upward trend, increasing in the first 
eight months by 2.4% from the corresponding 

period of the previous year, suggesting that 

industrial activity has been benefitting from the 

upswing in foreign demand. In August, the 

growth momentum (3m-o-3m) stood at 1.1% 

(1.3% in July).  
â¢ By contrast, the 3m-o-3m growth rate of 
new 
industrial orders
 in the euro area decreased to 
1.0% in July after 1.4% in June.  
â¢ Retail trade volumes
 decreased in both July and 
August from previous months, but the average 

volume over the two months was equal to the 

reading in the second quarter, which had been 

the highest in the history of the series (since 
1999). This could suggest that consumers have 

retrenched a bit after being supported by 

several special factors in the past. 
â¢ In August, 
construction production
 declined slightly after having been more or less stable 

over the previous three months. The 3m-o-3m 

growth rate in the euro area increased 

marginally from 0.0% to 0.1% and the 12m-o-

12m rate came in at 3.1%. 
While hard data seem to suggest a somewhat less 

optimistic near-term outlook than survey data, the 

discrepancy between the two appears to have 

declined somewhat lately
 compared to what was 
observed in spring. With hindsight, the 

discrepancy appears to have been reduced due to 

somewhat stronger hard indicators. Given the 

stronger-than-expected growth in the first half of 

the year and projections of stronger-than-

previously-expected growth in the second half of 

the year, the forecast for GDP growth in 2017 has 

been revised upwards considerably from 1.7% to 

2.2%, the highest growth rate since 2007. 
Growth set to remain rather robust over the 
forecast horizon... In 2018, domestic demand is expected to remain 
the key driver of GDP growth (Graph I.31).

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  32 back of reduced uncertainty, very favourable 
financing conditions and somewhat lower 

deleveraging needs. Private consumption should 

benefit from the ongoing improvement in labour 

market conditions but slightly less than before. 

Exports should get support from the expected 

strengthening of global economic activity and 

trade. Overall, real GDP growth is expected to 

moderate slightly in 2018 to 2.1% in both the euro 

area and the EU28. 
In 2019, the economic expansion should ease 
somewhat. Less dynamic employment growth and 

the expected slight rebound in inflation are set to 

weigh on the purchasing power of households and 

therefore on private consumption. Real GDP 

growth is expected to slow in 2019 to 1.9% in the 

euro area (Graph I.32). 
(65)
                                                             
(65) For a model-based analysis of growth drivers in the euro 
area, see Box 1. 
The year 2019 will also be the first one that 

includes a period after the UK has left the EU. 

Given the ongoing negotiation on the terms of the 

UK withdrawal from the EU, the projections for 

2019 are based on a purely technical assumption of 

status quo in terms of trading relations between the 

EU27 and the UK.
(66)
 In contrast to real GDP growth of about 2% 

throughout the whole forecast period, potential 

growth in the euro area is expected at just 

1.4-1.5%. Although this estimate has been revised 

upwards since spring, potential growth remains 

below pre-crisis levels. While the impact of the 

financial crises should have been diminishing, 
(67)
 the low rates continue to reflect the lower 

contribution of labour, which is constrained by 

demographic trends, including population ageing 

and already relatively high participation rates. It 

also reflects a lower contribution from capital, 

which is the result of subdued investment growth. 

But with investment exp
ected to accelerate, its 
contribution to potential growth is set to increase 

somewhat over the fo
recast horizon. The 
contribution of total factor productivity remains 

lower than before the economic and financial crisis 

and should remain constant over the forecast 

horizon. The output gap is expected to close next 

year and to turn increasingly positive over the 

course of 2018 and 2019. 
Medium-term developments in the EU are closely 
related to the changing policy context and policy 

decisions. They determine whether the cyclical 

upswing could be associated with stronger 

potential and actual growth. Without any further 

growth-enhancing reforms the outlook for 

potential growth could remain subdued. Low 

potential growth also sits uneasily with high 

financial market valuations and could imply a 

vulnerability to the expansion.  
...with all Member States joining the expansion. In recent quarters, the economic recovery has 

become more broad-based across euro area 

Member States. 2016 was the second consecutive 

year since 2007 in which all Member States except 
Greece were reporting economic expansion. In the 

                                                           
(66) This assumption is for forecasting purposes only and has 
no bearing on the talks underway in the context of the 
Article 50 process. 
(67) Recent empirical analyses suggested that the financial 
crises only affect potential output in the first years; see A. 

Mourougane (2017). âCrisis, potential output and

EA and EU outlook 
  33 three years covered by this forecast all Member 
States are expected to enjoy positive economic 

growth. All economies with
 above-average growth 
in the last three years are expected to enjoy further 
above-average growth (Graph
 I.33). Five countries 
are expected to move from below average growth 

in the euro area to stro
nger than average growth 
(Greece, Finland, Austria,
 Portugal and Cyprus), 
whereas France and Italy ar
e projected to grow in 
the next two years at the lowest rates of all euro 

area economies. 
The breadth of the expansion can also be seen 
when looking at the output gaps and their projected 

developments over the forecast horizon 

(Graph I.34). The changes 
in cyclical positions do 
not necessarily coincide with the observed growth 

differences across euro area Member States. 
Comparing the output gap forecast for 2019 with 
that of 2016, a further closing of the output gap is 

identified for all euro area 
countries except Ireland, 
Malta and Latvia. In these three countries, the 

output gap has been closed since 2014 and has 

been positive and widening since 2016. The 
cyclical upswing is projected to be particularly 

strong in Slovenia and Cyprus, where gaps are 

estimated to increase in 2019 to 3.9% and 3.7% of 

potential GDP. 
Private consumption has remained robustâ Private consumption has be
en the main driver of 
the economic recovery since its beginning in 2013, 

accounting for almost half 
of the GDP growth in 
the euro area. In the first half of 2017, private 
consumption in the euro area gathered further 

momentum, benefiting from high levels of 

consumer confidence and improvements in the 

labour market underpinned by past labour market 

reforms in some Member States. Strong 

employment growth remained more important for 

the growth of nominal labour incomes than 

increases in the compensation per employee 

(Graph I.35). 
In the first half of 2017, nominal household 
disposable income increased by an average of 

0.8% (q-o-q), up from 0.6% in the second half of 

last year. However, rising consumer price inflation 
prevented this from translating into purchasing 

power gains for households. In the second quarter, 

household final consumption expenditure rose by 

0.5% q-o-q in the euro area, up from 0.4% in the 

previous quarter. 
âbut could lose some momentum in the short 
termâ The short-term indicators for private consumption 
for the third quarter send mixed signals.  On the 

one hand, hard data suggest a slowdown in 

consumer spending in the near term. The indicators 

include retail trade volumes, which in July and 

August averaged close to

  34 the second quarter, but recorded month-on-month 
declines (Graph I.36). New passenger car 

registrations in the euro 
area decreased on average 
by 0.8% in both months compared to the second 

quarter. In contrast with these developments, the 

annual growth rate of loans to households 

remained at 2.7% in July and August, the highest 

rate since March 2009. 
On the other hand, survey data signal sustained 
private consumption growth. The Commissionâ¢s 

Consumer Confidence Indicator rose strongly in 

the third quarter of 2017 
compared to the previous 
quarter and reached its highest level in nearly 10 

years (December 2007). The October Flash 

Consumer Confidence Indicator was almost 

unchanged and confirmed thereby the positive 

signal. Continued improvements in the labour 

market have reduced unemployment fears, while 

optimism about the general economic situation 

kept on rising. Moreover, both current and future 

intentions to make major purchases have increased 

strongly in recent months. The Commissionâ¢s 

Retail Confidence Index, by contrast, moved more 

in line with hard data, decreasing in the third 

quarter compared to the second. 
In 2017, nominal disposable income is set to 
accelerate strongly (to its highest rate since 2008) 

on the back of higher wages and non-labour 

incomes, but the increase in inflation from 2016 

will have a dampening effect on the growth of real 

disposable incomes. Households, however, are 

expected to mitigate this effect slightly by 

lowering their saving rate (from 12.3% in 2016 to 

12.0% in 2017). Private consumption growth in the 

euro area is expected to decrease to 1.8% in 2017 
(2.0% in 2016).  
âand should develop in line with real 
disposable income growth in the medium 

term. Over the forecast horizon, the expansion of private 
consumption should continue to enjoy the support 

of stronger labour and non-labour income growth, 

consistent with higher corporate profits. As 

employment growth is expected to slow in the next 

two years, the support from labour market 

improvements is set to moderate. Overall, nominal 

disposable incomes are expected to grow at about 

3% in each of the two years. Reflecting the slight 

moderation in inflation in 2018 and the gradual 

uptick in 2019, this implies that real gross 

disposable income growth is projected to gain 

some momentum in 2018 before loosing 

momentum in 2019. Throughout this period the 

household saving ratio is expected to remain 

broadly unchanged with the downward impact of 

lower precautionary savings in an improving 

economic situation and th
e upward impact from 

the householdsâ¢ smoothing of consumption almost 

neutralising each other. 
Lending conditions for private households remain 
favourable, according to the latest ECB Bank 

Lending Survey and should continue supporting 

private consumption growth. Moreover, interest 

rates are expected to remain low, which should 

continue to favour net borrowers among 

households, which usually have higher marginal 

propensities to consume. 
(68) Low interest rates 
should also continue to prop up asset prices, 

supporting household wealth, including housing 

wealth, with moderate positive effects on private 

consumption. 
(69)
 Finally, progressively lower 
deleveraging needs in some Member States should 

help lift private consumption.  
All in all, these factor
s suggest that private 
consumption should continue to grow over the 
next couple of years but with some moderation in

significant increase of real private consumption of 0.15%,

  35 2019, mainly as a result of lower employment 
growth and the negative impact that the expected 

uptick in inflation will have on real disposable 

incomes. Private consum
ption is expected to 
increase by 1.7% in the euro area in 2018 and by 

1.5% in 2019 (Graph I.37). 
Over the medium term, the expected normalisation 
of monetary policy, which implies higher long-

term interest rates, could have an impact on 

household spending. The effects are likely to be 

strongest in countries with high household debt 

and a predominance of fl
oating-rate loans. By 
contrast, in countries where fixed-rate household 

loans predominate, households could see their 

returns from financial asset returns grow faster 

than their liabilities. The extent to which this 

would affect the discretionary spending of 

households depends on their debt burden and 

assets. At the same time, wealth effects and 

increased revenue from financial assets for 

households with large financial assets could raise 

disposable incomes and also incentivise household 

saving. That being said, the increase in long-term 

interest rates is assumed to be rather modest over 

the forecast horizon, implying a very limited 

impact on private consumption. 
Public consumption Government consumption has contributed to 

economic growth since th
e first year of the 
recovery (70)
 and its annual growth rate has 
                                                           
(70) The impact on the recovery, however, depended not only 
on public consumption, but on the fiscal policy mix (e.g. 
taxes, transfer, investment); s
ee e.g. G. Callegari, F. Drudi 
increased over the last four
 years. In the past two 
years, additional public spending for security-
related measures and to host and integrate asylum 

seekers, also contributed to this growth. 
In the first half of the year, government 
consumption rose by less than GDP, setting the 

stage for public consumption growth to slow to 

1.2% in the euro area this year (from 1.8% in 

2016) and in the EU28 (from 1.7%) respectively. 

In 2018, public consumption growth is set to 

rebound to 1.6% in the eu
ro area and to 1.5% in 
the EU28. The modest slowing projected in 2019 

(to 1.4% in the euro area) is made on the basis of a 

no-policy change assumption, in which 

consolidation measures ar
e only factored into the 
forecast if they have been adopted and presented to 

national parliaments or are known in sufficient 

detail to be taken into consideration. 
These projections for the euro area aggregate mask 
some divergence among Member States (see 

Section I.8) with differing consolidation needs and 

economic situations. 
Investment is picking upâ Strong investment growth is a key ingredient of a 

sustainable economic recovery because it extends 

potential output, can boost productivity and help 

keep medium-term inflationary pressures in 

check. (71)
 The recently observed strengthening of 
investment suggests that this component of 

domestic demand is finally stepping into this 

role.(72)
 In the first half of the year, investment gained 

momentum and even surprised on the upside, 

supported by a number of powerful, often 

interrelated factors, such as favourable financing 

conditions, increased external demand and strong 

business confidence. Investment contracted in the 

first quarter by 0.2% (q-o-q) and grew by 2.0% in 

the second quarter. Excluding Ireland, for which

  36 investment data has been
 very volatile in recent 
quarters, investment in the euro area increased by 
1.6% q-o-q and by 0.9% in the first and second 

quarters respectively. 
In the second quarter, the euro area investment-to-
GDP ratio rose to 20.8%, its highest level since 

mid-2010 and only 1.2 pps. below the average of 

the period 2000-2005. This increase hides 

substantial differences in the developments of 

equipment and construction investment-to-GDP 

ratios (Graph I.38) with only the former already 

hinting at a full recovery
. The increase also hides 
divergent developments in investment-to-GDP 

ratios in the public and the private sector, with the 

former having fallen to a new all-time low of 2.5% 

in 2016 and the latter having increased steadily 

since 2013 (from 16.8% in 2013 to 17.7% in 

2016). 
âand the investment outlook has improvedâ As regards the financing of investment spending, 

bank lending to firms and other funding by 

corporates should continue to be supported by low 

levels of interest rates (see also Section I.3). In this 

regard, the lower leverage ratios of euro area non-

financial companies should also be supportive. 
(73)
 The negative impact on investment from market 

expectations of a withdrawal of monetary stimulus 

and a slight steepening of the yield curve should be 

limited. Past studies have suggested that financing 

conditions per se play a rather limited role in 

determining investment by euro area 

                                                           
(73) A recent study of 920 non-fi
nancial companies in five 
Member States (IT, ES, PT, EL, SI) confirmed the 
importance of leverage ratios 
for investment activity in 
countries like Italy and Spain; see S. Gebauer, R. Setzer 
and A. Westphal (2017). âCorporate debt and investment: a 
firm level analysis for stressed euro area countriesâ¢.

companies. 
(74)
 However, at the current juncture, 
low financing costs may have become more 
stimulative due to high business confidence, 

diminishing uncertainty and the improved demand 

outlook. Low financing costs, however, can also 

result in activities that do not support investment, 

such as share buybacks. In addition, the 

announcement of a removal of monetary stimulus 

could be perceived by investors as a confirmation 

that the recovery has reached a more advanced 

state and this could encourage them to invest.
(75) The Investment Plan for Europe is expected to 

boost investment over the forecast horizon. As of 

September 2017, operations approved under the 

Investment Plan for Europe, were expected to 

trigger â¢236.1 billion in investments. Around 

454,000 small and medium-sized businesses are 

expected to benefit from improved access to 

finance. 
(76)
  Given the stronger-than expected first half of the 

year, investment growth for 2017 has been revised 

up from the spring forecast. In 2017, investment 

growth in the euro area is
 now expected to slow 
down to 3.9% after 4.5% in 2016, which was the 

highest growth rate since 2007. This figure was 

however distorted by the increase in Irish 

investment in 2016 by 60.8%. Excluding Ireland, 

the outlook for investment is rather for an 

acceleration, from 3.1% in 
2016 to 3.9% in 2017.  
In 2018, euro area investme
nt is expected to grow by 3.9% before decelera
ting to 3.3% in 2019. Differences between euro ar
ea aggregates with and 
without Ireland are expect
ed to be minor in the 
period 2017-2019 (about 0.1 pps.).

an for Europe, 
the European Investment Bank expects the investments approved in the 
past two years to have adde
d 0.7% to EU GDP and 690,000 
jobs by 2020, whereas overall cumulative investments 

supported by the EIB Group that were approved in 2015 

and 2016, are expected to have added by 2020 around 2.3% 
to EU GDP and 2.25 million jobs.

EA and EU outlook 
  37 âon the back of robust growth in equipment 
investmentâ The outlook for corporate investment has 
improved because demand expectations have 

increased, financial conditions are set to remain 

favourable, uncertainty has diminished and no 

further hindrances (supply shocks) have occurred. 

Business sentiment is relatively strong 

(Graph I.39), reflecting factors such as high 

capacity utilisation rates in both the industry and 

services sectors, increasing corporate profitability, 

and modernisation needs. 
The outlook for equipment investment, however, 
remains tainted by challenges such as the still high 

stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) in some 

countries and the need for further deleveraging. 

These are expected to continue to weigh on 

investment but to a lesser extent, as NPLs are 

gradually receding and the leverage ratio of firms 

has recently decreased. 
(77)
 Overall, equipment investment in the euro area is 

expected to grow by 3.8% in 2017, after 5.5% in 

2016 (boosted by the 27.9
% increase in Ireland). It 
is then expected to strengthen to 4.5% in 2018 

before slowing down to 3.7% (see Graph I.40). 

The lower growth in 2019 is broad-based among 

the largest euro-area countries, reflecting a 

maturing investment cycle.

 âand the projected recovery of construction investment. The recovery in the construction sector that began 
last year is projected to continue this year. 
(78)
 House prices in the euro
 area in the first and 
second quarter of 2017 grew
 at an annual rate of 3.8%, which is compatible to the recovery in the 

construction sector (Graph I.41). 
 The adjustment process that has prevailed in the 

construction sectors in some Member States 

appears to be coming to an end. However, the 

difference across countr
ies remains pronounced 

when viewed in terms of price and in volume 

indicators. While house prices rose at double digit 

rates in some countries they
 stayed almost flat in 
others. Production in the construction sector has

3reached its highest levels in more than a decade in 
some countries 
but remains substantially lower 
than before the economic and financial crisis in 
others. Among the largest euro area economies, 
only Germany belongs to the former group, while 

the others appear to have stabilised at levels lower 

than before the crisis (Graph I.42
). Most signals for the near-term outlook are positive. 

On the one hand, t
he Commission
s Construction 
Confidence Indicator reached its highest level in 
nearly ten years this September
. The number of 
permits in the second quarter of 2017 remained at 
broadly the same level as in the previous quarter 

when it had reached its highest level since end-

2011. This should continue to push construction 

investment in the near term. In line with this, the 

growth in loans for house purchases continued to 

increase, reach
ing 3.4% y-o-y in August, its 
highest rate since end-2011. On the other hand, 

construction production that same month declined 

slightly and the 3 month-
on-3 month growth rate in 
the euro area increased only marginally from 0.0% 

to 0.1% (unchanged at 0.1% in the EU). 
In 2017, investment growth in construction is 
expected to reach 4.1% in the euro area. In many 

of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004-

2007, construction investment in 2017 is set to 

expand strongly, driven by EU funding. 
In 2018, construction investment should continue 
to enjoy the support of low interest rates. They 

help to make housing investment both more 
affordable and more attractive to households. With 
the expected slight steepening of the yield curve, 

however, new mortgages would progressively 

become somewhat more costly. In the euro area, 

construction investment growth is projected 
to slow but remain strong in 2018 and in 2019 
(Graph I.43). The loss of momentum reflects the 

maturing phase of the cycle in Germany and the 

Netherlands, as well as negative effects of 
demographic trends. 
Robust export growth despite euro 
appreciation While the rebound in global trade is pushing 

European export volumes, competitiveness losses 

from the recent appreciation of the euro have been 

eating into the gains spurred by the euro
s previous 
depreciation and continue to weigh 
on euro area 
exports outside the euro area. In the second 

quarter, the growth of exports of goods and 
services slowed, but remained at rates that 

exceeded GDP growth. 
The impact of an appreciation of the euro depends 

on the source and persistence of the exchange rate 
movements. (79) Whether European exporters 
respond to pressure on their profit margins or 
mainly aim to preserve market shares (e.g. pricing 

to market) is crucial for the impact on export 

volumes. To the extent that the euro
s appreciation 
reflects an improvement in the macroeconomic 

outlook and in the euro area
s attractiveness 
to investors (e.g. in the wake of diminishing political 

risks), the overall effect should be relatively small. 

In addition, some permanent changes may have 

lowered the pass-through of exchange rate changes

  39 to the real economy. 
(80) These include heightened 
competition from increased globalisation, a higher 
share of less-price sensitive products as a result of 

lower energy import volumes (more pricing-to-

market), a wider use of th
e euro as an invoicing 
currency, and global value chains that have altered 

cross-border trade. Alread
y in the past, exports had 
been found to react more strongly to demand 

(which is picking up) than to exchange rate 

movements, 
(81) which is in line with observations 
that price competitiveness has not played a very 

important role for the export performance.
(82)
 Overall, the impact of th
e euroâ¢s appreciation on 
GDP is expected to be smaller than in the past. 
The near-term outlook remains favourable. The 
recent strength of survey 
indicators suggests that 
the appreciation of the 
euro should have a 
relatively limited impact (Graph I.44). In the third 

quarter, the assessment of export order books in 

the Commissionâ¢s manufacturing survey improved 

in the euro area compared
 to the previous quarter, 
reaching in September the highest level since end-

2007. In line with this, the manufacturing PMI new 

export orders index also increased in the third 

quarter. The data from the Centraal Planbureau 

(CPB) on the volume of trade in goods in the euro 

area shows that in July, the growth momentum 

stood at 1.1%, up from 0.2% in June. In line with 

the acceleration in euro area foreign demand (intra 
and extra) in 2017, exports are set to grow strongly 

in 2017 by 4.5%, and thus only 0.1 pps. slower 

than export markets. 
In 2018 and in 2019, export growth is expected to 
remain strong, supported by continued buoyant 

trade and strong foreign demand. The euro area is 

expected to see only a marginal loss of market 

share, which could, to some extent, be explained 

by exporters fully absorbing the euroâ¢s 

appreciation in their profit margins. The projection 

for 2019 is based on a purely technical assumption 

of status quo in terms of trading relations between 

the EU27 and the UK. All in all, euro area exports

âand vigorous import growth. In the first half of 2017, in line with the 

strengthening of domestic demand, growth of euro 

area imports of goods and services was robust at 

an average of about 1% in
 each quarter. However, 
the profile was less even due to strong ups and 

downs in Irish imports (particularly of intangible 

assets, such as intellectual property). 
(83)
 Import 
growth rose from 0.4% (q-o-q) in the first quarter 

to 1.5% in the second 
quarter (1.2% and 0.9% 
excluding Ireland). 
Over the forecast horizon, imports are forecast to 
grow robustly due to sustained domestic demand 

and vigorous export growth (given the high import 

content of many export g
oods). They are projected 
to grow by 4.7% in 2017 and 2018 and by 4.4% in 

2019.  
Given the strong pick-up in global demand, net 
trade is projected to make a slightly positive 

contribution to GDP growth over the forecast 

horizon, despite the strength of domestic demand 

and the euroâ¢s appreciation.

  40 5. THE CURRENT ACCOUNT 
After having gradually risen since 2008, the 
adjusted current account surplus
(84) of the euro area 
has been stabilising at about 3% of GDP since 

2015, where it is also expe
cted to stay close by 
over the forecast horizon with only a slight 

moderation as compared to last year. The 

stabilisation reflects the increase in investment that 

has exceeded the increase 
in gross saving in the 

euro area.  
A rise in commodity prices and the euro dull 
the strengthening of foreign demand in 2017â A period of relatively weak international trade 
growth, falling commodity prices, a depreciating 

euro and rather weak domestic demand lifted the 

current account surplus last year to 3.3% of GDP, 

its highest level since the start of economic and 
monetary union in 1999. This year, however, some 

of these factors behind the increasing surplus have 

disappeared or weakened. The euro has been 

appreciating and commodity prices have stabilised 

or even slightly rebounded. Moreover, economic 

growth in advanced and emerging economies 

outside the EU has gained momentum, and global 

trade has rebounded from the troughs observed in 

the past two years. This is supporting the 

expansion of the euro areaâ¢s merchandise exports 

this year, but has little impact on the trade balance, 

which typically contributes the most to the current 

account surplus. 
Altogether, the euro areaâ¢s adjusted merchandise 
trade surplus is expected 
to decrease from 3.5% of 
GDP in 2016 to 3.0% in 2017, whereas the current 

account surplus is expected to fall from 3.3% of 

GDP to 3.0%. The decline in both trade and 

adjusted current account surpluses resulted mainly 

from the change in relativ
e prices. After four years 
of improving terms of trade on account of falling 

import prices, the increase in
 oil prices is projected 
to contribute to a worsening in the terms of trade 

this year. Over the next two years, dampening 

effects on the current acco
unt surplus are expected 
to stem mainly from a rise in imports. The 

deteriorated price competitiveness, as measured by 

the real effective exchange rate based on unit 

                                                           
(84) The adjusted current account 
balances of the EU and the 
euro area take into account discrepancies between the sum 
of the current account balances of the Member States and 

the aggregate, which should theoretically not exist, but are 
usually observed due to reporting errors. 
labour costs, weighs on 
the euro areaâ¢s export 
performance. 
âleading to a gradual shrinking of the current 
account over the forecast horizonâ The euro areaâ¢s trade balance surplus is expected 
to gradually recede in 2018 and 2019. Over the 
forecast horizon, global
 economic activity is 

expected to strengthen further and global import 

elasticity is expected to tick higher. With 

increasing foreign demand, export markets are 

projected to grow at 4.5% and 4.3% in 2018 and 

2019 respectively, which exceeds economic 

growth outside the euro area (4.0% in 2018 and in 

2019), suggesting a beneficial composition of 

exports. Export and import pr
ices in the euro area 
are projected to be influenced mainly by the slight 

gradual increase of commodity prices and the past 

modest appreciation of the euro. However, with 

increases in export prices in 2018 and 2019 

exceeding the increase in import prices, the terms 

of trade are expected to rebound in 2018 and to 

remain almost unchanged in 2019. 
Overall, exports are expect
ed to grow almost in 
parallel to imports, but starting from a surplus, this 
implies a widening of the current account balance 

in absolute terms. In relative terms, the adjusted 

surplus is expected to remain stable in 2018 and 

2019 (Graph I.45).

  41 The stabilisation indicates that, looking at the 
saving-investment relation, the gap between 

domestic saving and investment has diminished, as 

both have increased as a percentage of GDP. 
âwhile asymmetric adjustment is expected to 
continue. Current account balances across EU Member 
States vary markedly. And the projected 
stabilisation of the adjusted current account surplus 

in the euro area over the forecast horizon 

compounds an asymmetric adjustment among 

Member States. Several Member States, which 

experienced a rebalancing of their current accounts 

from large deficits into surpluses, are expected to 

further improve or stabilise their current accounts 

over the forecast horizon 
(e.g. Spain, Estonia, Greece, Slovenia, Hungary). The current accounts 

of France, Cyprus, Belgium, Latvia, Lithuania, the 

Czech Republic, Romania and the UK are 

projected to remain in negative territory over the 

forecast horizon. Large 
current account surpluses 
of at least 5% of GDP are expected in Malta, the 

Netherlands, Germany, Slovenia, Denmark and 

Sweden. 
6. THE LABOUR MARKET 
Continued economic growth has led to a further 

improvement in the labour market situation, but 

indicators point to the persistence of slack. With 

economic growth expected
 to continue at an 
almost steady pace, the slack that weighs on wage 

developments can be expected to diminish over the 

next two years. Employment growth is set to 

continue at a slightly lower pace and further 
declines in unemployment rates should be 

somewhat lower as output gaps close. However, as 

recent years have brought various structural 

changes to the labour market (e.g. compositional 

changes in labour demand and supply) the removal 

of slack cannot be expected to be equivalent to a 

return of labour market characteristics as they had 

prevailed before the economic and financial crisis. 
Ongoing improvements in the labour market 
situationâ In August 2017, the unemployment rate in the euro 
area fell to its lowest since February 2009 (since 

November 2008 in the EU). Despite a substantial 

decline over the past four years, unemployment in 
the euro area is still higher than it was before the 

economic and financial crisis (Graph I.46). 
Most of the recent rise in employment consisted of 
permanent and full-time jobs, 
(86)
 which helped to 
bring more Europeans off the side-lines and into 

productive employment. Overall, the current 

recovery has been ï¬job-ric
hï¬ as the increase in the 

number of people employed has been somewhat 

stronger than economic growth would have 

suggested. 
(87)
 This has helped to raise employment 
above the level observed be
fore the crisis (Graph 
I.47).  
                                                            
(86) Between 2016-Q2 and 2017-Q1, in the EU the number of 
employees with permanent contracts increased by 2.2 mil. 
(yoy growth of 1.4%), whereas
 the number of temporary 
contracts increased by 0.5 mil. (1.5%); meanwhile the 
number of full-time workers increased by 2.5 mil., whereas 
the number of part-time workers increased by 150,000; see 

European Commission, DG Employment (2017). 
Employment and Social Developments in Europe, Quarterly Review, October.

  42 Employment continued to grow strongly in the 
first half of the year. As a result, more people are 

in employment now than ever before. 
âwith differences among Member Statesâ The labour market situation is improving in all 

countries but significant 
differences remain. This 
is not only obvious from the wide gap between the 

highest and lowest unemployment rates (in 2017 

between 3.0% of the labour force in the Czech 

Republic and 21.8% in Greece), but also in other 

indicators such as employment rates (in 2017 

between 51.6% in Croatia and 70.1% in Germany), 

and activity rates (between 58.0% in Croatia and 

72.6% in Germany). 
(88) âand evidence of persisting but diminishing 
slack. Labour market developments have been one of the 
weak spots in macroeconomic analyses and 

forecasts in recent years.
 Many forecasters have 
underestimated the strength of employment growth 

and at the same time overestimated the increase in 

employee compensation. This has raised questions 

as to whether standard labour market measures 

such as employment growth and unemployment 

rates can be used to derive conclusions about the 

tightness of labour markets, and more emphasis 

has been put on indicators of labour market slack. 
Given the strengthening of economic activity in 
the first half of the year, the recent period of 

almost stable unemployment rates may raise 

additional doubts as to whether standard indicators 

are sufficient to capture developments in the 

                                                           
(88) In the narrower group of those aged 15-64, in the second 
quarter in 2017 the activity rates ranged between 65.4% in 
Italy and 82.6% in Sweden, wheras employment rates of 
20-64 years old were in the first quarter in 2017 between 

57% in Greece and 82% in Sweden (source: European 
Commission, DG Employment (2017). 
Employment and 
Social Developments in Europe, Quarterly Review, 
October).  
labour market. While the standard indicators such 
as employment growth and unemployment rates 

point to a tightening labour market, other 

indicators still suggest that there is some slack left. 

These include working hours per employee 

(Graph I.48), which usually rise as the recovery 

progresses and workers, who have previously 

accepted to take part-time and temporary jobs, 

attempt to increase the number of hours they work 

or to get permanent contracts.  
 They also include underemployment indicators - 

such as the number of underemployed part-time 

workers (Graph I.49) or discouraged workers. For 

instance, the share of pa
rt-time workers seeking 
full-time hours is still greater now than in 2008. As 

explained above, the muted response of wages 

could also be interpreted as a sign that labour 

markets are not as tight as suggested by standard 

measures (see also Section I.7).

  43  The euro area aggregates 
point to some remaining 
slack in the labour market
, that has recently been 
reduced, but this development is not shared by all 

Member States. With respect to slack there are 

substantial differences across Member States 

(Graph I.50). To assess the impact of slack it is 

also important to look at its composition. The 

readings of the three underemployment indicators 

that usually supplement the unemployment rate are 

not necessarily correlated
 with the size of the 
unemployment rate. While Greece and Spain 

recorded the highest unemployment rates in the 

second quarter in 2017, the highest readings of the 

other slack indicators were observed in Italy, 

Finland and Cyprus. 
(89)
                                                             
(89) Miles et al. (2017) have argued that  is not just the change 
in the amount of slack, but also 
in  ï¬the quality of slackï¬ (p. 
71) that could matter; see D. 
Miles, U Panizza, R Reis and 
A Ubide (2017). âAnd yet it moves: Inflation and the Great 
Recessionâ¢. Geneva Report on the World Economy

Thus, the labour market might be less tight than 
the ongoing closure of the unemployment gap 

suggests. In 2017, the ga
p between the estimated 
Non-Accelerating Wage Rate of Unemployment 

(NAWRU), a measure of 
spare capacity in the 
labour market, and the projected unemployment 

rate is set to decline with a further narrowing 

projected over the forecast horizon. 
(90)
  Continued improvements over the forecast 
horizon... Survey data suggest that labour market conditions 
should continue to improve. The Commissionâ¢s 

survey data on employment expectations continue 

to suggest that net job creation will remain robust 

(Graph I.51). Overall, in both the euro area and the 

EU, the hiring intentions of firms remain above 

their long-term averages in all sectors.  

Employment expectations in the euro area 

improved across all sectors in the third quarter 

(manufacturing, retail trade, construction and 

service sectors). In September, in the euro area 

hiring intentions remained broadly unchanged in 

industry, services and retail trade, while they were 

revised upwards in construction. The employment 

component of the euro areaâ¢s Flash Composite 

PMI increased in October to a three-month high.  
 âbut with smaller employment gainsâ In 2018 and 2019, employment should continue to 

benefit from the sustained domestic-demand 

driven expansion, moderate wage growth, as well 

as structural reforms implemented in some 

Member States. However, several arguments

Employment expectations, 
DG ECFIN surveys, euro area
levellevelEuropean Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  44 suggest that employment gains will be somewhat 
smaller in 2018 and 2019.  
First, the fading of temporary fiscal measures in 
some countries will likely 
exert a dampening effect 

on employment growth. This includes temporary 

reductions in social security contributions in Italy, 

active labour market policies in Spain and tax 

credits for encouraging job creation in France. 
Second, in some Member States, labour market 
improvements have alread
y raised concerns about 
skilled-labour supply shortages, which are limiting 

further employment growth. More generally, the 

Commissionâ¢s survey results hint on a significant 

rise in labour shortages in both manufacturing and 

services, but with both readings well beyond 

previous cyclical peaks. 
This is reflected in the 
inward shift of the Beveridge curve, 
(91)
 which can 
be seen as a typical 
cyclical development 
(Graph I.52). 
Third, the counterpart to the ï¬job richï¬ recovery 
has been weak productivity growth, which hints 

also at moderate potential growth as a result of 

factors such as the protracted period of low 

investment ratios. The expectation of a gradual 

pick-up in investment ratios, an increase in the 

number of hours worked per person and a slight 

up-tick in total factor productivity, imply a 

strengthening of labour productivity growth in the 

years ahead.  
All in all, headcount employment is set to grow by 
1.5% in the euro area 
in 2017, faster than 
previously expected, and by 1.2% and 1.0% in the 

subsequent years (Graph I.53). In the EU, 

                                                           
(91) Similar results are obtained when using a Beveridge curve 
that depicts the vacancy rate as an indicator of the tightness 
of the labour market. 
employment growth is projected to ease more 
markedly next year, due to specific developments 

in the UK economy. 
âlimiting the further fall of unemployment 
ratesâ Developments in the labour force and in 
unemployment are expected to remain closely 

linked. The total labour force is projected to 

continue expanding over the forecast horizon, 

because of labour market 
reforms (e.g. in France), 
net migration into the euro area, and, more and 

more, the integration of refugees. This should help 

to offset the negative impact of demographic 

trends on labour supply. A slightly higher activity 

rate in combination with continued employment 

growth that exceeds labo
ur force growth should 
allow for a further dec
line in the unemployment 
rate over the forecast horizon. In the euro area, the 

decline from 10.0% in 2016 to 7.9% in 2019 is 

projected to happen mainly in 2017 (-0.9 pps.). 
âwith labour market disparities among 
Member States diminishing slightly. Labour market responses to the crisis have differed 
substantially across Member States and so have 

responses to the ongoing expansion. While most 

Member States saw unemployment rise during the 

Great Recession (2008-2009), the interim recovery 

(2009-2011), and the 
euro area recession 
(2011-2013), the current recovery has already 

lowered unemployment rates in almost all 

countries (Graph I.54).

  45 Nevertheless, labour market conditions and 
performances are expected
 to continue to vary 
across Member States. The range in 

unemployment rates is expected to narrow further 

over the forecast horizon, as unemployment rates 

are expected to fall most in the countries that were 

most affected by the crisis (Graph I.55).  
 The continued decline in unemployment rates 

should help to heal the scars of the crisis in terms 

of unemployment but is unlikely to bring 

unemployment back down to pre-crisis levels in all 

countries. 
7. INFLATION Since spring, inflation has continued to be driven 

by developments in oil prices. On the back of 

upside base effects, HICP inflation has ticked 

higher compared to last y
ear, and at the same time 
services inflation has moved up. Looking through 

the variations around Easter and those due to 

energy prices, data suggest a gradual increase of 
inflation may be under way. Thus, as in the spring, 

the outlook for inflation remains one of a pickup, 

albeit from low levels and at a gradual pace. 
Recent inflation developments point to a 
gradual uptickâ Consumer price inflation, as measured by annual 
changes in the Harmonised Index of Consumer 

Prices (HICP), has oscillated between 1.3% and 

2.0% in the first nine months in 2017. After having 

risen to 1.8% in the first quarter of 2017 (from 

0.7% the quarter before), consumer price inflation 

moderated to average around 1.5% in both the 

second and third quarters (0.1 pps. below the 

spring forecast). The fluctuation in headline 

inflation, especially in the first quarter, was again 

driven by the impact of positive energy base-

effects following the recovery of oil prices from 

their low levels in 2016 (Graph I.56). 
 Extracting the direct impact of volatile energy and 

unprocessed food prices, inflation is showing signs 

of a gradual recovery.

in the second and third quarter to 1.2% and 1.3% 
after staying at 0.8% in the four quarters before. 

Given its weight of 54%, the increase is mainly

second quarter (from 1.1% to 1.6%), followed by a 

slight moderation in the third quarter (to 1.5%). 
A closer look at the subcomponents of services 
inflation (see Graph I.57) shows that the highest 

rates were recorded for package holidays, 

reflecting this yearâ¢s timing of Easter holidays (see 

Graph I.58), 
(93)
 and for transport-related services, 
which were strongly affected by energy-related 

factors. (94)
 Prices for services related to 
communication, by contrast, continued falling. 

Tuning out this noise, it looks as if core inflation 

has slightly risen, which would be in line with the 

observation that other subcomponents of core 

inflation are slowly rising towards their respective 

historical averages.

The subdued level of core inflation may partly 
reflect the lagged negative impact of a prolonged 

period of low inflation, but it also reflects 

remaining labour market slack and weak wage 

growth, the latter very closely correlated with 

services inflation. Non-energy industrial goods 

inflation also increased to
 an average of 0.5% in 
the third quarter (from 0.3% in the second quarter), 

mirroring advances in the global production cycle 

and increased producer prices, and despite the 

significant appreciation of the euro in nominal 

effective terms over the same period. Prices for 

processed food - which is the less volatile 

component of food products - increased rather 

strongly compared to the other core inflation 

components to reach an average of 2% in the same 

quarter. 
âdespite still somewhat muted producer pricesâ Consistent with an increase in core inflation, is the 
turnaround in pipeline pressures, where the 

recovery in prices has been even more vigorous in 

2017. Industrial producer price inflation on the 

domestic market moderated to 2.5% in August 

after moving strongly into positive territory at the 

beginning of 2017 (averaging 4.1% in the first 

quarter), boosted by strong positive base effects 

from the decline in producer prices in 2016. All the

  47 main subcomponents of headline producer price 
inflation have been positive so far this year 

(Graph I.59). The main driv
ing factor is the energy 
component. However, the headline figure shows 

that pipeline price pressu
res are building along the 
supply chain even when
 energy prices are 
excluded, which is consistent with improving 

domestic demand. For example, in August, capital 

goods prices - which tend to be less energy-price 

sensitive rose by 1.0%; intermediate goods prices 

increased by 3.0%; non-d
urable consumer goods 
rose 2.5%; while the rise in durable consumer 

goods moderated to 0.5%. While producer prices 

tend to exhibit more dynamism, partly due to 

fluctuations in the exchange rate, the recent 

increases across the board 
should normally feed 
through to consumer prices, at rates which may 

differ according to product groups. 
The increasing pipeline pressures along the 
industrial chain are al
so linked with upward 
movements in global producer prices. For 

example, the annual rate 
of change of the total 
producer price index for OECD economies stood 

at 3.7% in August, after averaging 4.0% in the 

second quarter. The link and transmission to the 

domestic market is through the euroâ¢s nominal 

effective exchange rate and import prices tend to 

react relatively fast to its change, even if the pass-

through to consumer prices is slower. Indeed, the 

recent rise in the euroâ¢s exchange rate has helped 

to stunt imported industrial goods inflation, which 

in August rose a robust 2.4%. The rise in the 

euroâ¢s nominal effective 
exchange rate may also 
explain the decline in imported capital goods and 

durable consumer goods prices in the third quarter 

compared to the same period of last year. 
âand only moderate wage increases. The annual growth rate 
of the compensation of 
employees per head, which is a key determinant of 

domestic price pressures since it is closely 

correlated with services 
inflation and is a linchpin 
of the purchasing power of households, increased 

in the second quarter to 1.6% (from 1.4%). In 

assessing this development, it has to be kept in 

mind that the indicator increases (decreases) when 

the share of full-time
 employees increases 

(decreases) as it is usually the case during a 

recovery (recession). 
(95)
 Employee compensation 
growth in the euro area is expected strengthen 

from last yearâ¢s 1.2%, to 1.6% this year and 2.2% 

in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019.  
Another argument for expecting increased price 
pressures comes from house prices. In the first two 

quarters of 2017, the aggregate rise in house prices 

in the euro area was 3.8%. In some euro area 

countries, however, house prices rose at an annual 

rate of more than 10%, stimulated by a 

combination of very low interest rates and the 

economic recovery. Such house price growth 

generally leads to higher rental prices, which 

feature as a component in the HICP. 
However, inflation expectations remain close to actual inflation ratesâ Market-based measures of inflation expectations 
have remained relatively stable since spring and 

have moved in a narrow range after dropping from 

the highs registered in January, when strongly 

positive energy base effects lifted headline 

inflation. This confirms that market-based inflation 

expectations remain strongly influenced by past 

and actual movements in headline inflation. 
(96)
 Meanwhile, short-term measures of inflation 

expectations have actually increased somewhat 

since January. At the cut-off date of this forecast, 

inflation-linked swap rates 
at the one-year forward 
one-year-ahead horizon stood at 1.2% 

(Graph I.60). Swap rates at the three-year forward 

three-year-ahead horizon imply an average 

inflation of 1.4%. On a longer horizon, the widely 

watched five-year forward five-year-ahead 

indicator suggests inflation of 1.7%, still below the

  48 ECBâ¢s definition of price stability in the medium 
term. 
 Survey-based measures of inflation expectations 

have not moved uniformly since spring. According 

to the Commissionâ¢s surveys, selling price 

expectations in manufacturing and retail sectors 

and among consumers fell between the first and 

the third quarter, whereas they rose in the 

construction and services sectors. In the third 

quarter, they were above their long-term averages 

in manufacturing, services and construction, but 

below them in the retail sector and among 

consumers. By contrast, 
euro area PMI indices for 
input prices and selling prices increased in 

September in both the manufacturing and services 

sectors. 
The monthly mean of market forecasters calculated 
by Consensus Economics stood in October at 1.5% 

for 2017, and at 1.3% for 2018. The results of the 

ECB Survey of Profession
al Forecasters for the 
third quarter showed downward revisions of 

average inflation expectations to 1.5%, 1.4% and 

1.6% for 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively (by 

0.1 pps. for all three y
ears as compared to the 

survey for the second quarter). Longer-term 

inflation expectations (for 2022) stood at 1.8%.  
âand the outlook for inflation in the euro area 
remains broadly unchangedâ The near-term outlook for inflation remains under 
the influence of base effects from energy and 

unprocessed food prices. 
(97)
 The pass-through of 
the euroâ¢s recent appreciation to consumer prices 

is expected to remain rather low (see also

 because it is likely to originate 
from an improved growth outlook which differs 
from an exogenous exchange rate shock that 

lowers price pressures by being a drag on demand. 

Overall, headline inflation is expected to recover 

sharply in 2017 to average 1.5%, up from just 

0.2% in 2016. The forecast for inflation this year 

has been lowered slightly since spring because the 

dampening impact of the euroâ¢s appreciation is 

expected to more than offset the impetus from 

stronger-than-previously forecast GDP growth. 
After reaching 1.5% in the 
second quarter in 2017 
and set to remain there up to the fourth quarter, 
inflation is projected to dip slightly in the first 

quarter of 2018, dragged down by negative base 

effects in energy and unprocessed food prices but 

also due to the rise of the euroâ¢s nominal effective 

exchange rate, which is expected to lower 

imported price inflation. Thereafter, inflation is 

projected to pick-up grad
ually, as the impact of 
energy base effects is exp
ected to be mild over the 
remainder of 2018, given recent energy price 

developments and the energy price assumptions 

underlying the forecast. This V-shaped pattern is 

expected to lead to inflation of 1.4% in the fourth 

quarter of 2018, with the annual average in 2018 

coming in at 1.4% and thus lower than in 2017 

(Graph I.61). 
 In 2019, inflation is expected to tick gradually 

higher (to 1.6%), which is consistent with a

subdued pace is mainly related to the projected 

relatively low rate of wage growth. 
âwith inflation differentials expected to narrow. Aggregate HICP inflation 
rates continue to mask 
substantial differences ac
ross euro area Member 
States, which reflect the typical specialisation in 
different types of economic activity but also 

structural features an
d economic adjustment 
processes. While temporary inflation differentials 

are usually not seen as a matter of concern, 

persistent inflation differentials have been among 

the factors behind the build-up of imbalances (e.g. 

price and cost imbalances) in the euro area and 

therefore deserve attention. 
(99)
 By contrast, the 
narrowing of inflation differentials helps to make 

financial conditions, as measured by real interest 

rates, more similar across euro area countries. 
By the fourth quarter of 2019, HICP inflation rates 
at or above 1.6% are projected in all euro area 

economies, except Ireland, Greece, Cyprus and 

Portugal where inflation will be between 1.2% and 

1.4%. In 2019, five euro area Member States are 

expected to experience inflation at or above 2%. 

With most countries projected to record inflation 

rates within a rather narrow range, the dispersion 

of inflation rates, as measured in terms of the 

unweighted standard deviation is expected to 

decline to the lowest level in the past decade 

(Graph I.62). The spread
 between the highest and 
lowest inflation rate across euro area economies is 

also set to fall to a post-crisis low.

Outside the euro area, inflation differentials are 
more pronounced. By the fourth quarter of 2019, 

headline inflation rates are projected to vary 

between 1.5% in Bulgaria and 3.1% in Romania. 

Nevertheless, this also implies a narrowing of 

inflation differentials throughout the forecast 
years. One factor behind the narrowing of inflation 
differentials by 2019 is the end of the pass-through 

of past oil price developments, which differed 

markedly across countries. 
However, in assessing 
the declines, it has to be taken into account that 

forecasts usually incl
ude some narrowing of 
inflation differentials (see Section I.1 and 

Graph I.12). 
8. PUBLIC FINANCES 
In 2017, the general government deficit of the euro 

area is projected to declin
e more than expected in 
the spring forecast, mainly
 because of the upward 
revision to the GDP gr
owth forecast. Further 
declines in the euro area deficit are forecast in 

2018 and 2019 (Graph I.63), while the structural 

balance is expected to broadly stabilise. 
(100) The improved outlook for nominal GDP growth and 

historically low interest rates support the 

deleveraging of the public sector, with debt-to-

GDP ratios projected to be on a downward path in 

almost all Member States.

ects the headline balance for 
both cyclical, one-off and tem
porary budgetary factors, and 
hence isolates the impact of discretionary government 
policy action and interest expenditure.

50 Improving cyclical conditions and lower 
interest expenditures support deficit 
reductionâ The euro area general government deficit-to-GDP 
ratio is set to decline to 1.1% in 2017 (1.2% in the 

EU), from 1.5% in 2016 (1.7% in the EU) 

(Table I.6). The deficit is expected to continue 

falling in both areas in 2018 and 2019. The euro 

area deficit is set to fall by 0.2 pps. of GDP (to 

0.9 %) in 2018, after incorporating policy 

measures from the 2018 
Draft Budgetary Plans 
(DBPs). 
(101)
 The deficit is projected to decline 
further to 0.8% of GDP in 2019, based on a 

no-policy-change assumption (Graph I.64). 
Several factors contribute 
to the projected decline 
in the euro area general government balance 
between 2017 and 2019 (Graph I.65). The main 

driver is expected to be the change in the cyclical 

component of the budget, i.e. the budgetary impact

More specifically, the cyclical component is set to 

provide a positive contribution of around 0.45 pps. 

of GDP in 2017, which should drop to 0.35 pps. in 

2018 and 0.2 pps. in 2019 on the back of the 

expected slowing of economic growth in the euro 

area. Moreover, with interest rates remaining at 

historical lows, the reduction in interest 

expenditure will continue to support the decline in 

the general government balance over the forecast 

period, although this effect is expected to fade by 

2019. By contrast, a negative contribution is 

expected from declining structural primary 

balances in 2017-2019, which signals some deficit-

increasing impact from discretionary fiscal policy 

over the forecast horizon. The impact of one-off 

and temporary measures is set to be limited over 

2017-2019.

 âthanks to a falling expenditure-to-GDP ratio. Over 2017-2019, the general government deficit-

to-GDP ratio is expected to fall in both the euro 

area and the EU as a result of a fall in the 

expenditure ratio that is larger than the drop in the 

revenue ratio. The expenditure-to-GDP ratio in the 

euro area is set to decline 
by 1.1 pps. of GDP over 
the forecast period, from 
47.6% in 2016 to 46.5% 
in 2019, under a no-policy-change assumption 

(Graph I.66). Part of this decline is explained by 

lower interest expenditure, which is set to fall by 

0.4 pps. of GDP, from 2.2% of GDP in 2016 to 

1.8% in 2019. The rest of the 1.1 pps. decline in 

the expenditure ratio is mainly explained by 

improving cyclical conditions. As actual GDP is 

forecast to grow more than potential GDP over 

2017-2019, this should imply a dampening impact 

on the expenditure-to-GDP ratio (other things 

being equal). 
(104)
 At the same time, as labour 
markets are set to improve, lower unemployment 

benefits will also contribute to the reduction in the 

expenditure ratio over the forecast period.

2018 and 2019, based on a no-policy-change assumption. 
(104) By comparison, the primary expenditure ratio of the euro 
area is set to remain broadly stable over 2017-2019 when 
computed in terms of potential GDP.

In terms of the quality of public spending, public 
investment is expected to benefit from the 

implementation of the 2014-2020 programming 

period of EU funding as well as from the 

Investment Plan for Europe (see also Section I.4) 

Nonetheless, the aggregate ratio of public 

investment to GDP in the eu
ro area is projected to 
increase only marginally (to 2.7% in 2019, from 

2.5% in 2016) and should thus remain below its 

pre-crisis average (3.2% of GDP over 2000-2007). 
The government revenue-to-G
DP ratio of the euro 
area is set to remain unchanged at about 46.1% in 
2017, as the expected stronger economic growth is 
set to be matched by a similar increase in revenues. 

The revenue ratio is projected to decline in both 

2018 (by 0.2 pps.) and 2019 (by 0.2 pps.) reaching 

45.7% (1 pp. below the previous peak of 46.7% 

recorded in 2014), under a no-policy-change 

assumption. This decrease mainly reflects a 

reduced weight of social contributions (to 15.0% 

of GDP in 2019 from 15.3% in 2017).

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  52 Stronger nominal growth and low interest rates help keep the debt ratio on a declining path  The general government debt-to-GDP ratio of the 
euro area has been on a d
eclining path since 2014, 
when it reached a peak of 94.2% (88.2% in the 

EU). In 2017, the debt ratio is expected to continue 

falling to 89.3% of GDP (83.5% in the EU) (see 

Graph I.67 and Table I.6). Over the next two years, 

the debt-to-GDP ratio in th
e euro area is projected 
to fall further to 85.2% in 2019, under a no-policy-

change assumption. 
Over 2017-2019, the debt-to-GDP ratio is 
projected to decline in 
all Member States, except 
Romania (40.5% in 2019) and France (96.9%). 

The reduction in the debt ratio is expected to be 

supported by debt-decreasing snowball effects in 

all Member States except Italy. 
(106) Moreover, a 
majority of Member States is forecast to run debt-

decreasing primary surpluses by 2019. By contrast, 

stock-flow adjustments ar
e projected to provide a small debt-increasing contribution. Despite its 

projected decline, the debt
-to-GDP ratio in 2019 is 
set to remain above 100% 
in four Member States 
(Belgium, Greece, Italy an
d Portugal), and above 
90% in three others (Spain, France and Cyprus). 
                                                           
(106) The snowball effect is the impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio 
provided by the difference between nominal growth and 
the implicit interest rates paid on debt. Specifically, in the 
euro area aggregate, nominal GDP growth is projected to 
average 3.5% over 
2017-2019 and thus outpace the average 
interest rate paid on debt, which is set at 2.2%. As a result, 
the snowball effect is expected to help reduce the debt ratio 
in the euro area aggregate by 
slightly more than 1 pp. of 
GDP per year on average over the forecast period. 
9. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES IN THE 
EURO AREA Monetary conditions in the euro area remain 
accommodative. Based on the customary 

assumptions concerning interest rates and foreign 

exchange rates (Box 4), short-term money market 

rates are set to increase gradually in 2018 and 2019 

but should remain supportive overall in real terms. 

In addition, a renewed gradual increase in long-

term inflation expectations should keep real long-

term financing costs in negative territory. The 

fiscal policy stance, as measured by the change in 

the structural balance, turned broadly neutral in 

2015 and is expected to stay broadly neutral over 

the forecast period. 
Monetary conditions are expected to remain accommodative While monetary policy is expected to keep 
financing conditions in the euro area very loose 

overall, the further strengthening of economic 

growth in the euro area and the gradual rise in 

inflation have led to market expectations of 

gradually increasing nominal rates over the 

forecast horizon. Nominal long-term rates have 

further increased amid fluc
tuations since the spring 
and are expected to contin
ue to trend up modestly. 
The high stock of assets purchased under the 

Expanded Asset Purchase
 Programme (EAPP) in 
the Eurosystemâ¢s balance sheet, in combination 

with the continued reinvestment of maturing 

securities, should ensure that nominal long-term 

rates stay low, while the resulting high excess 

liquidity should weigh on short-term money 

markets and lending conditions further on. Indeed, 

in the money market, the overnight rate (EONIA) 

has continued to trade slightly above the ECBâ¢s 

deposit facility rate in recent months, amid the 

high and still-growing excess liquidity in the 

banking system. Similarly, the three-month 

Euribor rate has stayed at record low levels since 

the spring.  
In real terms, short-term rates stood in September 
where they had been in March, amid substantial 

fluctuations that were caused by volatile inflation 

developments (Graph I.68). 
(107) Real long-term 
                                                           
(107) Real rates are derived from the respective short- or long-
term rate minus annual HICP inflation and expected 
average inflation according to
 10-year inflation swaps, 
respectively. Forecasts are derived from futures and 
forward rates, deflated by the Commissionâ¢s inflation 
forecast and market-based measures of inflation 

expectations. 02040

  53 interest rates derived from inflation and interest 
rate swaps, which have been negative since May 

2014, has moved within a narrow range between 

March and September, as the increase in nominal 

rates has been offset by higher longer-term 

inflation expectations.  
 Looking ahead, overnight rates are assumed to 

remain close to current levels over the coming 

months and to increase only very gradually 

thereafter, as suggested 
by EONIA forward rates. 
Market expectations for the first interest rate hike 

by the ECB have been pushed forward somewhat 

in recent months, with a 10 bps. rate hike now 

fully priced in for the first quarter of 2019. As 

inflation is expected to 
decrease somewhat in 2018 
and pick-up again in 2019, this should lead to a 

slight increase in real short-term interest rates for 

2018 and a decrease in 2019,
 with real short-term 
rates nonetheless remaining clearly in negative 

territory. At the same time, forward rates are 

consistent with a continued gradual rise in nominal 

long-term rates over the 
forecast horizon, which 
should also translate into slightly higher real long-

term rates, as long-term inflation expectations do 

not increase at the same pace. 
The transmission of movements in nominal short- 
and long-term market rates to nominal financing 

conditions in the non-financial private sector is 

captured by the composite credit cost indicators 

(CCCI) (108)
 for non-financial corporations and 
households (Graph I.69). While credit costs for 

households have continued their moderate 

increases over the past six months on account of 

slightly higher rates on housing loans, the CCCI 

has remained broadly unchanged at very low levels 

                                                           
(108) The CCCIs are calculated as weighted averages of interest 
rates on different types of bank loans and corporate bonds 
(in case of non-financial corporations). 
for non-financial corporations. This reflects a 
further decrease in corporate sector bond yields 

that was offset by slightly higher bank lending 

rates, particularly for long-term loans.  
 A broadly neutral fiscal policy stance The fiscal policy stance 
in the euro area has 

stopped being restrictive in 2015. 
(109)
 Over the 
forecast period, a broadly neutral fiscal stance is 

projected, based on marginally deteriorating 

structural balances in 2017 and 2018 (Graph I.70). 

The discretionary fiscal effort, 
(110)
 an alternative 
indicator to assess the fiscal policy stance, signals 

a slightly expansionary
 stance in 2017 and a 
broadly neutral one in 2018. For 2017 in particular, 

euro area primary 
expenditure - net of one-offs and 
cyclical unemployment benefits - is projected to 

increase by 3.3% year-on-
year in nominal terms. 
This is more than the estimated 2.2% medium-term 

nominal potential growth for this year (i.e. 1.1% 

medium-term real potential growth plus 1.1% GDP 

deflator growth). As 
a result, the expected 
developments in discretionary expenditure imply 

around 0.45% of GDP of additional spending in 

2017 compared to neutral spending developments 

based on potential growth. This fiscal expansion 

on the expenditure side is only partly offset by 

                                                           
(109) Usually, the fiscal stance refers to the orientation of fiscal 
policy, which can be qualified 
as expansionary, restrictive 
or neutral. In this section, a neutral stance is one where 
government discretionary decisions, essentially the growth 

of (primary) spending and the new tax measures, neither 
support nor drag on the private economy compared with a 
steady state path (e.g. when primary government 

expenditures Å net of one-off
s and cyclical unemployment 
benefits Å expand in line with
 medium-term growth and no 
tax measures in either direction are taken).

discretionary fiscal effort, see

  54 additional structural discretionary revenues, 
estimated at around 0.1% of GDP.  
 At the national level, six euro area Member States 

are projected to have an 
expansionary fiscal stance 
- in terms of the change in the structural balance - 

combined with a positive output gap in 2018 

(Graph I.71; upper-left quadrant). Looking at the 

five largest euro area Member States, the autumn 

forecast points to an expansionary fiscal stance in 

France and the Netherlands in 2018, while a 

broadly neutral fiscal stan
ce is forecast for Spain, 
Germany and Italy.  
 There is not always a clear relation between the 

expected fiscal effort (as measured in terms of the 

change in the structural 
balance) and the level of 
debt-to-GDP ratios across Member States 

(Graph I.72). Looking ahead, further fiscal effort 

may be needed in several highly indebted Member 

States in order to achieve 
an adequate reduction in 

the debt ratio in a context of moderate growth 

prospects and amid the risk that historically low 

interest rates may turn less favourable, further 

weighing on the budget balance. 
 The policy mix in the 
euro area reflects the 
interplay between financing conditions and fiscal 

policy (see Graph I.73). Overall, the policy mix 

should be assessed in the c
ontext of a recovery that 
has gained momentum but remains incomplete, as 

reflected in persistently low core inflation and the 

prevalence of labour ma
rket slack in several 
Member States. On the monetary side, the 

additional measures taken by the ECB since the 

end of 2014 have exerted a significant downward 

pressure on nominal long-term interest rates in 

recent years. However, monetary easing has only 

been partially transmitted to real rates as long-term 

inflation expectations also declined over the same 

period and only started to pick up towards the end 

of 2016. The rise in infl
ation expectations since 
then, which has taken place in the context of a 

strengthening, is reflected in higher nominal long-

term rates, resulting in broadly unchanged real 

rates for 2017. Meanwhile, 
the appreciation of the 
euro since April has had a slight tightening effect 

on broader monetary conditions in the euro area.

  55 For 2018, average real lo

from the 10-year swap rate
 deflated by inflation 
expectations) are expected to increase somewhat, 
as the gradual increase in nominal rates is not 

expected to be accompanied by a corresponding 

pick-up in inflation expectations further out. 

However, financing conditions should remain very 

supportive. At the same time, as illustrated by both 

the change in the structural balance and the 

discretionary fiscal effort
 indicators, the fiscal 
policy stance is set to remain broadly neutral. 
10. RISKS There are a multitude of 
risks and uncertainties 
which could cause macroeconomic developments 

to turn out differently than described in the central 

scenario of the autumn forecast. Many of these 

risks are related to the changing policy context, 

which might include different policy actions than 

incorporated in the central
 scenario. Overall, risks 
to the outlook for economic growth and inflation 

are broadly balanced. 
Downside risks to the growth outlook are mainly externalâ Global risks dominate the spectrum for alternative 
scenarios. In the short te
rm, downside risks from 
the external environment mainly come from 

elevated geopolitical tensions (e.g. on the Korean 

peninsula and in the Middle East), but also from 

potentially tighter global financial conditions. 

Uncertainties about macroeconomic policies 

pursued in major countries outside Europe and 

Brexit add to these factors. 
Rising geopolitical tensions and domestic political 
discord can hurt global market sentiment and 

confidence, burdening 
economic activity. The 
main development in the past months is the 

escalation of the situation on the Korean peninsula, 

where military action cannot be excluded. 
(111)
 But 
tensions in other parts of the world could also 

create negative effects on global economic activity 

and trade (e.g. Syria, Ukraine, South China Sea, 

                                                           
(111) In a recent work, Ben Zeev 
and Pappa showed that such 
escalation in tensions can also have real effects for the US 
economy in the short to medium run via the response of 

companies and households to announced changes in 
defence spending; see N. Ben Zeev and E. Pappa (2017). 
âChronicle of a war foretold: the macroeconomic effects of 

anticipated defence spending shocksâ¢. 
Economic Journal
 127:603, pp. 1568Å97. 
Iran), either directly or indirectly, for instance via 
higher commodity prices.  
In the medium term, external risks relate to a 
possible setback in global trade integration as well 

as a disorderly adjustme
nt in China, whereas 
vulnerabilities in other emerging market 

economies persist, for instance with respect to an 

abrupt tightening of global financial conditions. A 

hard landing for China in its transition or sudden 

stops in capital flows to vulnerable emerging 

market economies would have adverse 

repercussions for European economies through 

weaker trade and deteriorating sentiment. 

Following a period of rising opposition to 

globalisation, inward-looking policies could 

introduce restrictions to foreign trade and foreign 

direct investment that disrupt global supply chains, 

lower productivity and distort economic growth, 

most notably in the more open economies. 
(112) More inward-looking policies could also trigger a 

correction in asset valua
tions and an increase in financial market volatility.  
The strength of economic activity will be a key 
determinant of decisions about the removal of 

monetary stimulus in advanced economies. For 

example, in the US economy, stronger-than-

expected growth momentum or inflation could 

trigger a faster or stronger monetary tightening 

than currently assumed. If this were to lead to 

investor risk aversion globally, there could be 

significant spillovers in terms of capital flows, 

financial market stability and financial conditions. 

This would hit the US and many emerging markets 

but could also impact negatively on Europe. The 

risks associated with a ra
pid increase in the price 
of risk are more substantial when leverage ratios 

are high, as they are now. 
(113) Another key mid-term risk is related to the Brexit 

negotiations. Depending on the outcome of the 

negotiations, the transition may not be as smooth 

as assumed in the central scenario. Further risks 

are related to the technical assumptions underlying 

the forecast. A stronger-t
han-assumed appreciation 
of the euro (especially if not driven by improved 

economic fundamentals), or a weaker than 

expected expansion of global economic activity 

and foreign trade, are both substantial downside 

risks.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  56 âwhereas upside risks are mainly domesticâ On the domestic side, diminishing uncertainty, 
improving sentiment and the synchronous rebound 

outside Europe could result in a stronger-than-

expected expansion in Europe. Short-term political 

risks seem to have decreased further in recent 

months. The dissipating political uncertainty in the 

wake of elections in Europe had a positive 

short-run impact on economic growth and, if 

sustained, creates the foundations for diminishing 

long-run uncertainty. Further positive momentum 

could result from a faster than currently envisaged 

strengthening in the architecture of Economic and 

Monetary Union. 
On the upside, growth momentum could prove 
stronger and more durable
 than expected amid strong consumer and business confidence in the 

euro area and near-term gr
owth could exceed the 
forecast, which pencils in
 a cautious reading of 
sentiment indicators. There is also the possibility 

that investment could turn out stronger than 

forecast due to pent-up demand in Europe after 

many years of weak 
corporate spending. 
On the downside, a faster-than-assumed steepening 

of the yield curve would probably challenge many 

asset valuations, which could, through wealth and 

sentiment effects have some dampening impact on 

economic growth. While mark
et reactions to recent 
events in Catalonia have remained contained, the 

risk exists that future developments could have an 

impact on economic growth. 
As regards the banking sector, public interventions 
in some countries have somewhat eased near-term 

risks stemming from the remaining vulnerabilities 

in the European banking system. But the 

combination of low profitability and legacy issues 

(e.g. the stock of non-performing loans) could 

threaten the viability of some banks. In such a 

situation, low earnings could limit the ability of 

banks to build cushions against unexpected losses 

and to raise capital in markets. A faster-than-

expected rise in long-term interest rates would 

have important and asymmetric effects for banks 

(e.g. wholesale funding, valuation effects) and 

sovereigns. Countries more exposed to financial 

fragilities would be more exposed to sovereign 

risk, possibly reviving the problem of negative 

feedback loops. Financial conditions could tighten 

significantly in high-public debt countries, putting 

further pressure on banks. Particularly in 

economies that are very 
reliant on bank funding, 
such developments would have a negative effect 

on economic activity. 
In the longer term, the low potential growth 
constitutes a risk. Lingering crisis legacies and 

structural weaknesses could hamper potential 

output growth in the EU more than currently 

envisaged. Given that potential growth is set to 

remain around 1Â½%, which is already low by 

historical standards, a further deterioration would 

be detrimental to macroeconomic developments 

even in the short term. 
Also in the long-term, the already visible 
challenges to the European automotive sector (end 

of combustion engines, development of electric 

cars, autonomous vehicles) could endanger an 

important manufacturing sector more than 

currently projected, in particular in countries 
where companies have worsened their outlook by 

observed and/or alleged mis-behaviour. 
âwhich adds up to broadly balanced risks to 
the growth outlookâ All in all, risks to the growth outlook look broadly 
balanced. This marks a difference from forecasts in 

previous years when the cr
isis-related legacies had 
mostly driven the balance of risks into negative 

territory. 
Recent developments in ri
sks to the euro area 
growth outlook are visualised in a fan chart

with various outcomes for euro area economic 

growth over the forecas

  57 âwhich are interrelated with risks to the 
inflation outlookâ Risks to the inflation outlook have intensified, but 
remain broadly balanced. Many of the risks are 

closely related to the materialisation of risks to the 

growth outlook. Upside risks are associated with a 

stronger-than-expected expansion, which would 

raise domestic inflationary pressures. Higher 

external price pressures could also result from a 

stronger-than-expected increase in oil prices. 
Downside risks to the inflation outlook relate to a 
further appreciation of the euro, which would, 

given the assumption of constant nominal 

exchange rates in the central scenario, lower oil 

prices in euro terms. Further downside risks 

include innovation-driven positive supply shocks, 

which could lower price pressures. Also an 

unexpected fall in inflation expectations with its 

impact on the behaviour of backward-looking 

households and companies could lower inflation.  
For instance, this would keep wage growth lower 

than expected and reduce
 domestic inflationary 
pressures below those expected in the central 

scenario. 
âwith risks related to the changing policy context the main difference from earlier risk 

assessments. Overall, most of the risks to the growth and 
inflation outlook are interdependent and can 

mutually reinforce each other. For example, 

stronger-than-expected growth momentum would 

raise inflationary pressures and impact on the pace 

of the removal of monetary stimulus. A faster-

than-expected monetary tightening in the US or in 

Europe would impact on foreign exchange markets 

and most likely shift exchange rates away from 

what is assumed in 
the forecast. This  
indicates some of the difficulties of  

macroeconomic forecasting in times of a changing 

policy context.

Box I.1: 
Main drivers of growth in 2018 - shock decomposition from an estimated model
GDP growth is expected to continue at a robust 
pace in 2018. This box uses an estimated,  
general equilibrium, multi-region, structural 
macroeconomic model 
(1) 
to provide a 
decomposition of the main drivers of next yearâ¢s 
forecast euro area real GDP growth. The model 
features two regions, the euro area and the rest of 
the world, and it has been estimated using historical 
quarterly data for the period from 1999-Q1 to 
2017-Q2. The historical time series have been 
extended with forecast data from the European 
Commissionâ¢s autumn 2017 forecast for the set of 
available variables.  
The use of a structural macroeconomic model 
makes it possible to identify the exogenous factors 
driving short- and medium-term deviations of real 
GDP growth from its long-run trend, and to provide 
their underlying economic interpretation. The 
decomposition provided in this box takes the 
European Commissionâ¢s forecast as an input and 
recovers the factors that explain it in a 

model-consistent way. Hence, the analysis presents 
the exogenous factors (âshocksâ¢) that provide a 
model-consistent interpretation of the forecast. By 
implication, these are the factors that would be 
needed to generate the forecast result in the model.  
It should be noted, however, that the model-based 
decompositions are not necessarily identical to the 
impact that the same factors would have in the 
European Commissionâ¢s forecast. Moreover, within 
a model of tractable size, not all of the estimated 
shocks can be interpreted directly as indicating 
fundamental âcausesâ¢. For instance, changes in 
financial risk premia and financing costs that affect 
interest-sensitive demand components (e.g. 
investment) and the exchange rate may be 
associated with various behavioural and structural 
sources that are not specified explicitely and in 

detail in the model equations, such as changes in 
(subjective) risk perceptions, financial frictions, or 
non-standard policies (including quantitative 
easing).  
Developments in the recent past have an impact on 
growth next year. The estimated persistence in the 
dynamics of the main variables in the model, which 
is due to rigidities such as price and wage 
stickiness, habits, inertia in adjusting the input 
factors (stock of capital and labour demand), and 
gradual responses of monetary and fiscal policies,

 These results are based on the Global Multi-Country 
(GM) DSGE model developed by DG ECFIN and the 
Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. 
implies that past events still affect current and 
future economic outcomes together with current 
events and expectations about future developments. 
Based on the estimated model, Table 1 presents a 
decomposition of euro area real GDP growth in 
2018 as projected by the European Commissionâ¢s 
forecast (2.1%) into its principal drivers. The table 
summarises the large number of shocks into main 
groups of supply- and demand-side drivers and 
separates the contribution of past and future shocks. 
 The first column (âhistoricalâ¢) displays the 
contribution of shocks that occurred up to 2017-Q2 
to the outlook for euro area GDP growth in 2018, a 
contribution that is due to the persistence in the 
transmission channels embodied in the model. The 
second column (âforecastâ¢) shows the contribution 
of shocks from 2017-Q3 on, i.e. over the forecast 
horizon. The shocks over the forecast horizon are 
additional changes in exogenous variables that are 
required by the model to fit the forecast given the 
historical data and the estimated historical shocks. 

The contribution of past shocks and of shocks over 
the forecast horizon combines to give the total 
impact of the various supply and demand factors 
that is shown in the third column. Shocks that are 
not listed within a specific group of supply- or 
demand-side factors are included into the residual 
category of âothersâ¢. 
The long-run trend component (1.3%) in Table 1 is 
the real GDP growth rate that would prevail if the 
euro area economy was to grow at the average 
growth rates of total factor productivity (TFP) and 
the working-age population as observed over the 
period since 1999. Real GDP growth is forecast to

exceed trend growth by 0.8 percentage points (pps.) 
in 2018 due to positive factors outweighing 
negative ones. 
The third column of Table 1 shows that the listed 
demand-side factors dominate the picture and 
explain most of the positive deviation of the 
forecast from trend GDP growth, whereas the 
contribution of supply-side factors is smaller in 
size. The dominance of demand shocks is 
consistent with the closing of the output gap that is 
projected over the forecast horizon. The overall 
impact of past demand-side drivers (âhistoricalâ¢) on 

the deviation of GDP growth from trend is large 

and positive (0.6 pps.) according to the model. The 
total impact of demand shocks over the forecast 
horizon (âforecastâ¢) is negligable. In other words, 

using the knowledge of recent data, the judgement-
based autumn forecast for 2018 and the projections 
from the estimated model are aligned. 
Regarding the supply side, total factor productivity 
(TFP) growth is at the long-run average 
(1999-2017), so that it does not contribute to 
deviations of the forecast from long-run rend 
growth.  
In 2017, oil prices have risen from their 2016 low. 
The forecastâ¢s technical assumptions include a 
moderate, continued rise in world-market oil prices 
in 2018, which the model attributes to a 
continuation of the upward trend in 2017. The oil 
price increase dampens GDP growth in 2018 
(-0.1 pps.) via its impact on production costs and 
real disposable income. It is cushioned, however, 
by the parallel appreciation of the euro, which 
offsets the price increase in domestic currency 
terms (see the discussion of the exchange rate 

impact below).  
Supply-side developments in the labour and goods 
markets play a positive role (0.2 pps.), which the 
model attributes to the positive net contribution of 
shocks in 2018 (âforecastâ¢). The contribution is 

driven by wage developments (0.2 pps.). In 
particular, the model interprets the moderate real 
wage growth as the impact of wage moderation. 

Wage moderation means that wage growth is 
weaker than suggested by the pace of the recovery 
and labour productivity growth. In the model, wage 

moderation is associated with positive employment 
and GDP effects, which is consistent with an 
upward revision in potential output growth on the 

basis of a decline in the NAWRU (non-accelerating 
wage rate of unemployment). This supply-side 
view of wage moderation holds regardless of the 
near-term negative demand implications of low 
wage growth.  
Regarding the demand side, the post-crisis recovery 
of private consumption combined with a declining 

saving rate is interpreted by the model as a 
normalisation of savings behaviour after a period of 
deleveraging. Based on historical data, the model 
projects a further decline in the saving rate in 2018 
that would strengthen consumption and GDP 
growth (0.4 pps.). The autumn forecast, to the 

contrary, is more cautious than the model and 
projects a weaker rise in consumption. In technical 
terms, the more cautious forecast implies that the 

model would require additional negative 
consumption shocks in 2018 to match the autumn 
forecast for consumption growth, contributing 

negatively to GDP over the âforecastâ¢ horizon 
(-0.1 pps.). 
The forecast for private investment in 2018 is 
strong compared to the 1999-2017 average, but also 
indicates some decrease in investment growth in 
real terms. The estimated model associates the 
steady investment growth with the improvement of 
investment specific factors, notably a decline in the 

investment premium, defined as the gap between 
the (required) return on investment and the risk-
free interest rate after the crisis (0.1 pps.). The 
estimated model projects further normalisation of 
investment conditions over the forecast horizon 
towards the 1999-2017 mean. Investment growth in 

the autumn forecast is weaker than the modelâ¢s 
projection, which is based on continuously 
improving investment conditions. In the logic of 
the model, the more moderate outlook for 
investment growth in the autumn forecast is 
associated with an upward correction of investment 

premia in 2018, which accounts for the negative 
contribution (-0.1 pps.) of investment shocks in the 
âforecastâ¢ column of Table 1. 
The overall contribution of fiscal policy to GDP 
growth in 2018 in Table 1 is quantitatively minor, 

despite the projected slight decline in the structural 
primary balance in 2018. The absence of a 
quantitatively important fiscal impulse can be 

attributed by the particular composition of the 
change in the structural primary balance, which is 
mainly due to lower structural revenues that have a 

small fiscal multiplier in the model. 
The model assigns a positive contribution of 
0.3 pps. overall to monetary policy shocks. This is 
largely (0.2 pps.) associated with pre-2018 policy 
decisions that have been shaping future interest 

rates due to the expected persistence in interest rate 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  60  Box (continued) 
    setting in the model. With the output gap moving 
into positive territory in 2018 and prices growing 
faster than in recent years, the modelâ¢s policy rule 
would imply a tapering of monetary 
accommodation, which is not reflected in the 
technical assumptions. Instead, the short-term 
policy rate is expected to remain low over the 
forecast horizon, which translates into additional 
monetary stimulus (0.1 pps.) compared to the 
model projections. 
Unconventional monetary policy measures, such as 
quantitative easing, are not captured by the 
monetary policy shock in Table 1, which relates in 
the model to a Taylor rule, an approximation of the 
responsiveness of interest rates set by the central 
bank to changes in inflation and output gaps. 
Quantitative easing enters the model through its 
impact on savings behaviour (consumption), long-
term interest rates and capital costs (investment) 
and the exchange rate. Quantitative easing would 
therefore, be one of the factors behind the positive 
growth contributions from lower saving and 
normalising investment conditions in Table 1. 
The technical assumptions of the autumn forecast 
include strong output and import growth in the rest 
of the world (RoW). The assumption exceeds the 
modelâ¢s projection for RoW growth that is based 
on historical information and a gradual return to the 
historical mean. Hence, the model indicates a 
positive contribution (0.2 pps.) of world demand 
and trade shocks that are needed in 2018 to align 
the model projections with the forecast.  
The effective euro appreciation that is incorporated 
in the technical assumptions for 2018, dampens 
GDP growth in the short term to some extent 
 compared to the model projection of a weaker euro 
exchange rate. The euroâ¢s appreciation weakens the 
price competitiveness of goods and services 
produced in the euro area compared to the rest of 
the world. It also reduces the price of imported 
commodities in euros and production costs in the 
euro area. The gradual response of trade volumes to 
price changes (i.e. a moderate short-term price 
elasticity of trade) in the model also attenuates the 
negative short-term effect of euro appreciation on 
GDP growth in 2018 (-0.1 pps.). 
In sum, the overall contribution of the supply and 
demand factors in Table 1 is positive (0.8 pps.). 
The (cyclical) demand shocks (0.7 pps.) dominate 
the picture, which is consis
tent with the closing of 
the output gap in 2018. In particular, private 
consumption and continuously accommodative 
monetary policy on the domestic side account for 
most of the positive deviation of the 2018 forecast 
from trend growth according to the model-based 
decomposition. Wage moderation, which is needed 
to reconcile moderate wage growth with the 
projected strength of the recovery, adds to euro 
area GDP growth according to the model, which is 
consistent with an upward revision in potential 
output growth on the basis of a decline in the 
NAWRU. The strong world output and 
international trade growth embedded in the 
technical assumptions of the forecast contribute 
positively through higher euro area exports, 
whereas the built-in euro appreciation, as well as 
the moderate recovery of world-market commodity 
prices, dampen the growth outlook. Taken together, 
the deviations of the autumn forecast from the 
model projection with respect to foreign and world-
market factors neutralise each other in their impact 
on euro area GDP growth in 2018.

Box I.2: 
What drives wage developments?
Despite strengthening recovery, wage growth 
remains subdued 
The relationship between nominal wage growth and 
the output gap seems to have weakened in the past 
years and particularly in advanced economies. In 
the euro area, while the recovery of the economy 
since mid-2013 has led to a gradual closing of the 
output gap, wage growth (as measured by 
compensation per employee) has remained 
subdued, averaging 1.4% y-o-y since mid-2013 as 
compared to an average annual growth rate of 2.5% 
between 2004 and 2008. A similar pattern can be 
observed for the US which is ahead of the euro area 
in terms of the cycle: while the output gap has 
turned increasingly positive since its closure around 
2014, compensation per employee grew at around 
2% since 2012, well below the pre-crisis dynamics 

(3.5% in 2004-2008).  
Subdued wage growth has been observed in a large 
number of euro area Member States and across 
different sectors of the economy. In particular, 
wage growth in Spain has been considerably lower 
in recent years than before the crisis, followed by 
Italy and France, whereas German wage growth 

actually increased on average since mid-2013 as 
compared to before the crisis. With regard to 
sectors, while not surprisingly sectors that have 
seen employment losses over the past years such as 
construction and manufacturing displayed a 
slowdown in wage growth, so did also sectors 

which have expanded their labour force. Although 
job creation since the crisis has been unevenly 
distributed, being concentrated mainly in the low-
productivity services and public sectors, sectoral 
shifts in employment have only made a modest 
contribution to wage moderation. A decomposition 
of euro area wage growth into weighted sectoral 
wage growth (âwithin effectâ¢) and those effects that 
are attributable to shifts in the sectoral composition 
of the labour force shows that while such sectoral 
shifts, e.g. over-proportional employment growth in 
low-wage sectors, have generally exerted a drag on 
wage growth for the most part of the past 
decade 
(1)
, the overall magnitude of this labour shift 
effect is small. Moreover, a significant post-crisis 
strengthening of these effects that could explain the 
slow wage growth relative to the output gap 
developments since mid-2013 is not visible.   
Quantitative analysis suggests a flattening 
Phillips curve 
A quantitative analysis tries to shed more light on 
the drivers of wage developments in the euro area. 
To this end, a new Keynesian wage Phillips curve 
(PC) calibrated for the euro area is estimated, using 
quarter-on-quarter wage growth as the dependent 
variable, which is explained by a slack variable, 
quarter-on-quarter labour productivity growth and 
backward as well as forward-looking inflation 
measures.

 As simple wage equations have a 
tendency to be unstable, a time-varying parameter 
version of the baseline model is estimated using the 
Kalman filter to account for parameter instability.

 On the euro area level, this pertains in particular to a 
lower employment share in the high-wage sectors 
manufacturing and financial and insurance activities, 
whereas low-wage sectors such as health and social 
work as well as accommodation and food services 

activities have grown relatively more.

The results confirm the important role of standard 
measures of slack in explaining wage growth but 

also points to a significant flattening of the wage 
Phillips curve since about 2011, i.e. the estimated 
coefficient on the output gap has weakened over 

this period (Graph 2a). This flattening suggests a 
decreased sensitivity of wage growth to economic 
slack in recent years. Adding productivity growth 

on top of the output gap as an explanatory variable 
enhances the overall model fit, suggesting that the 
low level of productivity growth observed in the 
current recovery has been pushing wage growth 
down compared with the immediate pre-crisis 
period. However, this effect remains relatively 
small overall. By contrast, controlling for past 

inflation and inflation 
expectations leads to 
significant improvements in the model fit. 
Interestingly, the coefficients for backward and 
forward looking inflation measures show opposite 
trends (Graph 2b). Whereas the former increased 

continuously at least until the global financial 
crisis, the latter shows an opposite trajectory. This 
suggests a tendency towards a more backward 
looking wage formation system during the first 
decade of the euro. The trend appears to have 
stopped since the current recovery. 
The quantitative analysis for the US based on a 
similar 
(3)
 model specification also points to a 
flattening of the curve starting already in the early 
2000s (Graph 2c). Productivity seems to be a much 
more important factor driving wage developments 

in the US than in the EA, with its importance rising 
steadily over time as shown by the Kalman filter 
time varying model estimation (Graph 2d).  Past 
inflation also weighs heavily on wage 
developments, with some moderation in the last 
fifteen years compared to the prior two decades. 

Contrary to the euro area, inflation expectations do 
not improve the model fit and introduce instability 
to the model instead, possibly reflecting the purely 

adaptive character of inflation expectations. 
Protracted low productivity coupled with 
stubbornly weak inflation seem to be the main 

factors dampening wage growth in the US.

   (Continued on the next page) 
What other factors can explain wage 
moderation? 
As usually found in the economic literature, 
however, the overall fit of the wage Phillips curve 

regression is relatively low suggesting the need to 
look beyond the simple wage model presented 
above. Particularly, the current phase of wage 

moderation may also reflect changes in the labour 
market structures and in wage setting processes. 
Recent research has stressed the possible role of 

changes in the labour market and wage bargaining 
processes in explaining persistent wage moderation 
in advanced economies. Two types of argument 
have, in particular, been put forward. First, 
traditional measures of labour market slack such as 
the unemployment rate may not appropriately 
capture the extent of underemployment in the post-
crisis world. Discouraged workers, workers looking 
for a job but not immediately available and 

underemployed part-time workers are not included 
in traditional unemployment measures. To account 
for this, a broader measure of unemployment (the 

so-called U6 measure) can be constructed by 
adding these various forms of unemployment or 
under-employment to standard unemployment. 

Changes in the broader measure seem to be 
following relatively closely changes in the standard 
unemployment rate but U6 suggests a considerably 

higher level of slack which could explain lower 
wage pressures. There is some empirical evidence 
that the U6 measure of slack on the labour market 

can improve the fit of Phillips curves in the euro 
area. (4) However, the additional explanatory power 
provided by this labour market measure is 
generally rather low regarding current wage 

developments. For the US, the U6 measure of slack 
is of less relevance since both U6 and the 

traditional unemployment measure have come back 
to pre-crisis lows recently. A recent study by the 
IMF 
(5)
 reports a negative impact of involuntary 
part-time employment (which is a component of 
U6) on wage growth in advanced economies 
although the effect across the entire country sample 
is relatively modest.  
Second, there may have been structural changes in 
wage bargaining processes due to structural 
reforms in the labour market, a deterioration of the 
quality of employment (e.g. changes in the share of

 temporary employment) and changes in trade union 
behaviour. These structural changes could account 
for the flattening of the wage Phillips curve. For 
example, trade unions in some countries seem to 
have broadened the focus of trade negotiations with 

pay rises being just one element in a wider 
package. Demands regarding e.g. working-hour 
flexibility, training conditions or conditions for 

workers under fixed-term contract or part-time 
work for older workers seem to have gained in 
importance. Globalisation, outsourcing and the 

proliferation of global value chains may also have 
hampered unionsâ¢ negotiation power. This is also 
confirmed by empirical work of the BIS 
(6)
, in 
which a measure of pricing power is included in a 
panel Phillips curve estimation to account for a 
possible trend decline in workersâ¢ pricing power 
(notably due to labour market reforms). Indeed, the 
parameter is found to be positive and significant, 
indicating that the lower pricing power of workers 

is one of the possible explanations of the flattening 
of the curve.  
 Source: Eurostat, own calculations
 The quality of jobs in terms of contract and 

working time has indeed deteriorated in the euro 
area. Between the beginning of 2012 and Q1 2017, 

4.2 million jobs have been created in net terms in 
the euro area. However, the impressive 
employment creation has come on the back of a 

shift in the quality of jobs, i.e. in the form of an 
increase in temporary contracts and/or in part-time 
work. In fact, 60% of total net job creation over 

that period were part-time jobs (2.5 million), 34% 
(1.4 million) were temporary contracts. 
(7) Over the 
same period, the share of involuntary part time in

    employeesâ¢ bargaining power and thus might have 
led to more cautious wage demands.  
Summing up, the analysis shows that euro-area and 
US wage growth can to a significant degree be 

explained by a standard wage equation. A low 
inflation environment and a backward looking 
expectation formation process together with low 
productivity growth (particularly for the US) have 
weighed on wage growth despite the simultaneous 

closure of the output gap. In addition there is 

evidence that the wage Phillips curve for both the 
euro area and the US has been flattening, i.e. it has 
become less responsive to cyclical conditions and 

that wages have become more dependent on past 
inflation. Finally, the low quality of employment 
creations in this recovery (e.g. a high share of 

temporary employment) and the existence of a 
large pool of workers not captured by standard 
unemployment measures may also, to some degree, 
have weighed on wages. If anything, this effect 
appears, however, to be rather small at the current 
juncture in the euro area as a whole and in the US.  
Looking ahead, the model results suggest that the 
gradual increase of core inflation in past months 
should feed into the wage bargaining system, 
further supporting wage growth. However, the 
process can be expected to be rather slow due to the 
stickiness of the wage formation process in the euro 

area. Significant and structurally higher wage 
growth would require a trend reversal in low labour 
productivity growth. Additional factors could also 
weigh on inflation pressures in the short to medium 

run. Broader measures of the slack on the labour 
market like U6 point to a large pool of potential 
workers that could boost the labour supply in the 
years to come. For example, discouraged workers 
which are not captured by official unemployment 
rates might want to return to the labour market 
given the on-going recovery and together with a 
still significant share of involuntary part-time 
workers could contribute to keep a lid on 
employeesâ¢ wage claims. In the US, lifting the 
wage growth from its current lows will crucially 
depend of the sustained rebound in productivity. 
On the other hand, the gradual tightening of the 
labour market is set to trigger a considerably 
weaker pass-through to wages compared to the pre-
crisis period.  
Structural differences in wage formation 
between Member States 
While the baseline specification for the euro area 
overall explains relatively well recent wage 
developments at the euro-area level, it does not 
have the same explanatory power across all 
Member States. Applying the euro-area baseline 

wage specification to selected Member States (DE, 

FR, IT, ES and NL) points to large country 
differences in the explanatory power of the model 
both over the entire sample and for the most recent 

past. This suggests that there is room for further 
research including country-specific wage equations 
with idiosyncratic factors. In this respect, the 

overall relatively-low correlation of additional 
measures of labour market slack with wage growth 
for the euro area aggregate might mask significant 

differences across Member States. For instance, the 
above-mentioned IMF study finds that in advanced 
economies with unemployment rates still 

considerably above pre-crisis levels, involuntary 
part-time employment has weighed significantly on 
post-crisis wages. Furthermore, the quality of 

recent job creations has been more an issue in some 
euro area Member States than in others. For 
example, while temporary contracts are now more 
common than in the pre-crisis period in most 
advanced economies (WEO, 2017), SpainÂ´s labour 
market currently stands out in the euro area in 
terms of workers subject to temporary contracts, 
both in terms of levels and the contribution to 
employment growth. This might partly explain why 
the rapid fall in unemployment in Spain since 2014 
has not brought about higher wage growth, as 
temporary contracts are more likely to weigh on 
wage levels than permanent or part-time contracts. 
Similarly, the role of labour market reforms for 
wage developments in specific Member States 
might also warrant further research. In several 
Member States, significant reforms of employment 
protection systems were implemented introducing 
more flexible wage formation processes and 
affecting the shape of the wage equation. Finally, 
differences in integration in the global economy 
may also have contributed to country differences in 
wage growth. The possibility for multinationals to 
outsource part of the production abroad might be an 
additional factor constraining wage bargaining for 
trade unions. For instance, there is some empirical 
evidence that combines offshoring and labour 
market reforms to explain the German experience 
with wage developments, suggesting that German 
firms have relocated the labour intensive stages of 
production to low-wage countries, particularly 
Central European countries, with this relocation 
being much more pronounced in Germany 
compared to other European countries.

Box I.3: 
Automatic stabilisers in the euro area: a model-based assessment
This box examines the contribution of automatic 
fiscal stabilisers to the stabilisation of GDP in 
recent years. Understanding the role played by 
automatic stabilisers in the recent past holds 

important lessons for forecasters as it should allow 
them to better assess the impact of future shocks to 
the economy. 
In the EMU, national fiscal policy plays a 
particularly relevant role as a stabilisation tool 
because monetary and exchange rate policies are 
decided in common at the euro area level. The issue 
has become even more crucial in recent years as the 
large shocks that hit the economy revived the 
discussion over how fiscal policy can support 
macroeconomic stabilisation by reducing 
macroeconomic volatility. 
(1) A fundamental distinction needs to be made 

between discretionary fiscal policy and automatic 
stabilisers, whose relative merits have been widely 
discussed in the academic literature and policy 

debate. 
(2)
 Automatic stabilisation is provided by 
rules in the tax and transfer systems that contribute 

to smooth economic fluctuations and thus drive the 
budget balance to move with the cycle, with the 
amplitude of budgetary fluctuations dependent on 
the degree of stabilization provided. Revenue and 
outlays from different budget components, such as 
income, corporate and indirect taxes and 
unemployment benefits and social security 
contributions, vary during expansions and 
recessions helping to achieve output stabilisation.

McKay and Reis (2016) distinguish several 
channels through which automatic stabilisers 
operate: a disposable income channel, stabilisation 
through marginal incentives, a redistribution 

channel and a social insurance channel. 
(3) On the 
other hand, the use of discretionary fiscal policy to 

manage short-term demand fluctuations has often 
been ineffective due to both a difficulty in 
providing a symmetrical adjustment in good times 
(it is politically more difficult to cut spending than 
to raise it) as well as its implementation lags 
(leading to pro-cyclicality) and impact on agents 
expectations. 
(4) While automatic stabilisers have the advantage of 
not being subject to implementation lags, a key 
question is how effective they are in delivering 
output stabilisation, especially in the context of the 
budget restrictions such as those that accompanied 
the recent economic and financial crisis. 
Estimates of the effectiveness of automatic 
stabilisers in the euro area vary considerably. 
Barrell and Pina (2004) estimate a degree of output 
smoothing from the presence of automatic 
stabilisers, measured as the root mean square 
deviation of GDP growth, of 11%, while Barrell, 
Hurst and Pina (2002) find a value of 9%. 
(5) Van 
den Noord (2000) finds, on average, a degree of 
smoothing effectiveness of between 25% and 30%, 
while in ât Veld, Larch and Vandeweyer (2013) 
estimate that automatic stabilisers smooth 
economic fluctuations by 13%-27%. 
(6) Estimates for individual Member States are also 
wide-ranging. For example, Brunila, Buti and

in ât Veld (2003) find that, for a sample of EU 
countries, the smoothing capacity of automatic 
stabilisers is in the range of 20-30% in the case of a 
consumption shock, and 10-15% in the case of an 
investment shock. 
(7) Buti et al. (2002) find a value 
of 14% for Belgium and 22% for France, while 
TÃ¶dter and Scharnagl (2004) estimate a degree of 
stabilisation of up to 26% for Germany. Wijkander 

and Roeger (2002) calculate an index of stabilising 
efficiency of 0.24 for France and 0.36 for 
Germany. 
(8)
 These variations across estimates partly reflect the 

nature of the shocks hitting the economy, but are to 

a large extent driven by the use of different 
benchmarks against which the effectiveness of 
automatic stabilisers is measured. Several studies 
use a benchmark where levels of revenue and 
expenditure are fixed in absolute terms, and 
variations of this approach have been used in the 

literature. 
(9)
 An alternative approach is to keep 
taxes and spending constant as a share of GDP. The 

choice of alternative benchmark budgets can lead 

to considerably different estimates of the degree of 
output smoothing provided by automatic stabilisers. 
Importantly, the choice of the benchmark 
determines the narrative about the origin of 
automatic stabilisation. As clarified by in ât Veld, 

Larch and Vandeweyer (2013), if the neutral 
budget is defined as a budget where expenditure 
and revenues are fixed in levels, changes in the 
level of taxation and unemployment benefits are 
seen as automatically stabilising. Since 
unemployment benefits are relatively small, the 

bulk of stabilisation is associated with the revenue 
side of the budget. On the other hand, if the

benchmark budget is defined as one where revenue 
and expenditure are constant as a share of GDP, 
automatic stabilisations mainly stem from 
progressive taxation and the size of government, 
notably from the fact that the bulk of government 

expenditure does not respond to cyclical 
fluctuations.

 This box uses the Commissionâ¢s QUEST model to 
investigate the role played by automatic stabilisers 
in the euro area and in three large Member States 
over the period 2014-2016, following the approach 
adopted by in ât Veld, Larch and Vandeweyer 
(2013), who measure the effectiveness of automatic 

stabilisers against the two benchmarks discussed 
above. 
(11)
  Design of the simulations 
A first scenario replicates economic conditions 

prevailing in the euro area as an aggregate and in 
France, Italy and Spain in 2014, 2015 and 2016, 
assuming that automatic stabilisers are operating as 
normal. This is done by replicating the output gap 
profile (reported in Table 1) through a combination 

of shocks to consumption and equity risk premia 
which broadly mimics estimated consumption and 
investment gaps over the period.

Table 1:

outcome has to be compared to a situation where

order to take into account the uncertainty 
surrounding the right benchmark to use, the 
scenario in which automatic stabilisers are

(10) A related example can be found in the comparison 
between the budgetary elasticity and the semi-
elasticity. The first measures the change in revenue 

and expenditures level resulting from a marginal 
change in GDP. The later measures the reaction to a 
change in GDP of the ratios of expenditure and 
revenue to GDP.

benchmark models, reflecting the two definitions of 
a neutral budget applied in the literature on 
automatic stabilisers: expenditures and revenues 
fixed in levels and expenditures and revenues fixed 
as a ratio of GDP.  
In the first benchmark scenario, expenditures and 
taxes are kept fixed at their baseline level. 

Government purchases and government investment 
are kept constant in real terms, while the level of 
unemployment benefits and other transfers to 
households are fixed in nominal terms. Changes in 
lump-sum taxes neutralise the cyclical components 
of tax revenues and unemployment benefits.  
In the second benchmark scenario, expenditure and 
taxes are kept constant as a share of GDP. 
Government purchases, government investment 
and transfers are linked directly to GDP. In this 
scenario, lump-sum taxes change in order to keep 

the sum of tax revenues and unemployment 
benefits constant as a share of GDP. 
Effectiveness of automatic stabilisers over the 
period 2014-2016 
Tables 2 to 5 show the macroeconomic effects of 
the shocks in the three scenarios for the euro area 

as a whole and Italy, France and Spain. GDP 
effects are presented as deviations from the steady 
state, while the smoothing capacity of individual 
shocks is calculated as 
benchmarkGDPGDPâ1, to 
measure the degree of smoothing of GDP 
fluctuations provided by automatic stabilisers as 
compared to a neutral budget scenario. 
The degree of smoothing provided by the automatic 
stabilisers differs depending on the benchmark 
budget against which the macroeconomic effects 
are compared. In the first benchmark budget 
scenario, euro area real GDP falls by 3.13% in 
2014, i.e. about 20% more than in the case in which 
automatic stabilisers are operational. When the 

second benchmark budget is considered, the 2014 
drop in GDP is 3.54%, about 36% larger than with 
automatic stabilisers. If the benchmark does not 

implicate inertia of government spending over the 
cycle (i.e. when the second benchmark is used), the 
degree of smoothing is larger (0.26 instead of 

0.17), indicating that automatic stabilisation is not 
exclusively a result of the tax system, but is also 
affected by the size of government. Private 

consumption is most affected by the presence of 
automatic stabilisers, as stabilisation mainly 
operates through household disposable income. On 
the other hand, the effect on corporate investment 
is very small, as investment decisions in the model 

are determined by the net present value of 
investment projects over their whole lifetime.

 Euro area effects in 2015 and 2016, although of 
smaller magnitude, are similar. This partly reflects 
the fact that the ratio between the consumption and 
investment gaps, and therefore the relative size of 

the consumption and risk premia shocks, is broadly 
unchanged over the time horizon considered. 
In general, the capacity of automatic stabilisers to 
smooth economic fluctuations varies depending on 
the shock hitting the economy as well as on how 

the counterfactual budget is defined. Table 6 shows 
the effects on consumption and investment and the 
degree of smoothing provided by automatic 

stabilisers for a shock to consumption and a shock 
to equity risk premia in the euro area, both 
standardised to 1% of GDP.

Shock to consumption
 As could be expected, the effects on consumption 
and GDP are considerably different. More 
interestingly, the degree of smoothing offered by 
automatic stabilisers is remarkably larger in the 
case of a consumption shock, consistent with 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  68   
 
 Box (continued) 
    findings from Brunila et al. (2003) and TÃ¶dter and 
Scharnagl (2004). 
(13)
 In the case of a consumption 
shock, automatic stabilisers dampen the drop in 
euro area GDP by 19% compared to a benchmark 
budget with fixed levels of revenues and 
expenditure. The degree of smoothing increases to 
29% when using a benchmark where revenues and 
expenditure follow GDP. The smoothing capacity 
of automatic stabilisers, however, is reduced to 
12% and 21% when risk premia shocks are 
considered. This is largely explained by the fact 
that, as mentioned above, automatic stabilisers 
mostly affect disposable income and consumption. 
Variations across Member States are explained by 
differences in tax and transfer systems and by the 
composition of the shocks hitting the economy. The 
degree of labour tax progressivity is an important 
factor affecting the smoothing capacity of 
automatic stabilisers. The results show a higher 
degree of output stabilisation in countries with  
                                                           
(13) Op. cit. 
more progressive labour tax systems, such as Spain 

and Italy. However, in the case of Italy, where the 
investment gap relative to the consumption gap was 
larger over the period considered, the estimated 
effect of automatic stabilisers is smaller. The 
estimated effectiveness of automatic stabilisers is 
lowest in the case of France, where the income tax 
system is less progressive and where the 
investment gap was relatively large in comparison 
to the consumption gap. 
Overall, these results show that, in recent years, 
automatic stabilisers played a non-negligible role in 
stabilising the economy in the euro area as a whole 
and in a number of Member States. The 
effectiveness of automatic stabilisers in dampening 
output fluctuations was larger in countries where 
the negative GDP effects were more consumption-
driven and where the income tax system was 
relatively more progressive.

% of pot. GDP
Higher household purchasing power In 2018, household purchasing power growth is 
projected to pick up as a new collective wage 

agreement comes into ef
fect and job market 
continues to develop favourably. As labour market 

conditions improve, households are expected to 

use a large part of the additional income and even 

their savings to increase consumption. However, 

private consumption growth is expected to slow 

down slightly in 2019 once higher inflation starts 

to eat into purchasing power. 
Private investment is also expected to provide a 
significant contribution to growth. Concerning 

business investment, firms are expected to 

maintain a high level of investment on the back of 
an already high degree of capacity utilisation, 

exceptionally favourable financing conditions and 

sizeable liquidity reserves
. Household investment 
is projected to remain rather stable over the 

forecast horizon as only a moderate increase in 

interest rates is expect
ed. The local investment 
cycle, the start of large infrastructure works, and 

defence investments are ex
pected to drive public 
investment growth in 2018 and 2019. 
The contribution of net exports to growth is 
expected to be broadly neutral over the forecast 

horizon, as stronger domestic demand will raise 

the demand for imports and exporters make only 

modest market share gains.  
Overall, GDP growth is expected to rise to 1.8% in 
2018 before easing to 1.7% in 2019. 
Labour market is tightening Policies put in place to moderate wage growth 

have helped to make labour relatively less 

expensive and have succeeded in spurring 

employment growth. As the latter is expected to 

outpace labour force gr
owth throughout the forecast period, the unemployment rate is 

projected to progressively decline to 6.8% in 2019. 
Inflation gap to narrow Headline inflation is project
ed to increase to 2.2% 
in 2017 from 1.8% in 2016, mostly as a result of 

higher energy prices. Nevertheless, the gap with 

the euro area is expected to reduce and should be 

eliminated by the end of 2019, helped by the 

phasing out of a tax on electricity consumption that 

was introduced at the end of 2015. Headline 

inflation is thus projected to decline to 1.4% in 

2018 and to edge up to 1.6% in 2019.   
With the end of the temporary suspension of the 
indexation mechanism, nominal wage growth is 

projected to rise in 2017 and in the following 

years. Nevertheless, real wage growth is expected 

to remain moderate, contributing to the recovery of 

productivity. 
Economic growth is expected to strengthen to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018 on the back of improved 

labour market and investment cond
itions. After considerable improvement in 2017, the headline general 
government deficit is expected to remain broadly stable in the coming years, which would nevertheless 

allow for a further reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio. 
Member States, Belgium 
  75 Deficit to stabilise after sharp decline The headline deficit is projected to fall to 1.5% of 
GDP in 2017, down from 2.5% in 2016. The 

revenue-to-GDP ratio is ex
pected to increase by 
0.2 pps. while the expenditure-to-GDP ratio should 

fall by 0.8 pps. With the economy strengthening, 

corporate income taxes (+0.3 pps.) and consump-

tion taxes (+0.1 pps.) are the main drivers on the 

revenue side. Social contri
butions are expected to 
decline further (-0.1 pps.), although the overall 

impact on public finances from the government's 

policy of reducing the tax burden on labour is 

fairly neutral in 2017. With regard to spending, 

both interest payments (-0.3 pps.) and primary 

expenditure (-0.5 pps.) are expected to fall. The 

structural balance is estimated to improve by a 

little over Â½% of GDP in 2017. 
In 2018, the headline deficit should narrow 
moderately to 1.4% of GDP. Additional reductions 

in personal income taxation and social security 

contributions are behind a decline in the 

revenue-to-GDP ratio of 0.6 pps. The forecast 

includes new taxes on consumption (excise duties 

on sugary drinks and tobacco) and on financial 

income (broader scope of withholding tax, 

increased tax on stock exchange transactions, new 
tax on securities accounts, strengthening of 

transparency tax). These represent around 0.1% of 

GDP. Due to a lack of in
formation at the cut-off, 
the envisaged reform of corporate taxation was not 

included. 
In terms of GDP, expenditure is expected to 
decrease by 0.6 pps. in 2018. This reflects social 

benefits (-0.2 pps., mainly unemployment bene-

fits), interest payments (-0.2 pps.), public sector 

wages (-0.1 pps., due to staff reductions and lower 

indexation), and subsidies (-0.1 pps. following the 

revised energy levy in Flanders). The structural 

balance is forecast to wo
rsen slightly in 2018. 
Under a no-policy-change assumption the headline 

deficit would widen to 1.5% of GDP in 2019, as 

tax cuts are not fully offset
 by the expected decline 
in expenditure. The structural balance is estimated 

to deteriorate by about Â¼% of GDP. 
The debt ratio is project
ed to decrease by around 
2 pps. of GDP in 2017, thanks to the primary 
surplus and a downward snowball effect (as 

nominal growth outpaces 
interest payments). 
Upward stock-flow adjustments are limited thanks 

to the partial sale of the share held by the Belgian 

state in BNP Paribas. Absent further divestments, 

debt should fall more slowly in 2018-2019.

Stable growth supported by domestic demand 
76 Strengthening domestic demand supports 
growth 
Real GDP growth in 2017 is expected to reach 
3.9% following a good performance of the 

economy in the first half of the year and an upward 



0.5 pps. Domestic demand is the main driver of 

growth with both private and public consumption 

projected to expand strongly in 2017. The 

contribution from investment is expected to turn 

positive, as investment slowly recovers from its 

6.6% drop in 2016. Net exports, which performed 

very well in 2016, are losing momentum as higher 

domestic demand is fuelling a rise in imports and 

exports are slowing down. The contribution from 

net exports to growth is forecast to be zero this 

year. 
In 2018 and 2019, real GDP growth is forecast to 

gradually decline to 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively. 

Domestic demand is expected to remain the engine 

of growth. Private consumption growth is set to 

moderate, while investment should continue to 

boost the economy as the absorption of EU funds 

under the 2014-2020 EU programming period is 
expected to accelerate. The contribution to growth 
from the external sector is forecast to be only 
slightly positive in 2018 and 2019 as both export 

and import growth rates are set to slow. The 

negative output gap is projected to close in 2017 
and turn positive thereafter. 
Risks to the growth outlook are broadly balanced. 
Increasing wages and incomes could have second-

round positive effects on expectations and, 

consequently, private consumption. On the 

downside, a slower utilisation of EU funds could 

moderate the contribution of investment to growth. 
Declining current account surplus 

recede to 3% of GDP in 2017. Growing demand by 

trading partners is being outweighed by stronger 

domestic demand, leading to a higher increase in 

imports than exports in 2017. This trend is 
expected to continue in 2018 and slightly reverse 
in 2019. The current account surplus is thus 

expected to reduce further to 2.4% and 2.3% of 

GDP in 2018 and 2019 respectively. 
Positive and increasing inflation 
After a long period of negative inflation, annual 
HICP inflation is expected to reach 1.0% in 2017 

due to strong domestic demand, higher 

administrative prices for utilities, and recovering 

energy and commodity prices. Inflation is forecast 

to gradually increase throughout the forecast 

period, to 1.5% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019. 
Decreasing unemployment 
Employment is expected to rise by 0.7% in 2017, 
supported by the recovery in domestic demand, 

especially investment. The increase in 

employment, alongside a constant labour force is 

driving a decrease in the unemployment rate to 

6.4% in 2017 from 7.6% last year. Employment 


exports is set to diminish this year, as imports grow fas
ter than exports. Inflation, which had been 
negative for three years, has turned positive as a result of strong domestic demand. Unemployment is 
projected to continue falling, while wages grow strongly. In this favourable macroeconomic framework, 
the gener
al government budget is expected to remain balanced and slowly turn into surplus, despite 
increases in public investment and public wages.
 Member States, Bulgaria 
  77 growth is expected to remain positive but to 
decrease in 2018 and 2019 due to limited labour 

supply. The unemployment 
rate is forecast to decrease to 6% in 2018 and 5.7% in 2019. 
Positive fiscal performance The balanced general government budget achieved 

in 2016 is expected to be sustained in 2017. The 

higher expenditure on public investment and 

increases in public wages are expected to be 

compensated by a good performance of revenues. 

Revenues are projected to benefit from the positive 

economic outlook, as well 
as an improved tax 
collection and a higher absorption of EU funds. In 

structural terms, the defic
it is expected to be also 
zero as the output gap is set to close. 
The general government budget is forecast to 
remain balanced in 2018 and to register a surplus 

of 0.2% of GDP in 2019. Plans to raise public 

sector wages and investment are expected to push 

total expenditure to higher levels, but with this 

effect being outweighed by a strong revenue 

performance. Wage developments and increased  
social security contribution rates are set to have a 

positive impact on direct tax revenues. The 

revenue from indirect taxes is also projected to 

increase in line with consumption and public 

investment. The positive output gap is expected to 

push the structural balance back to negative 

figures, at about Â¼% of GDP in 2018 and slightly 

below zero in 2019. 
Bulgariaâ¢s general government debt is forecast to 
fall to 25.7% of GDP in 2017, more than 3 pps. 

lower than in 2016. This reduction is due to the 

positive impact of the primary surplus and the 

repayment of debt of around 2 pps. of GDP out of 

accumulated fiscal reserves
. The primary surpluses 
and the low interest payments projected for 2018 

and 2019 are expected to lead to a further 

reduction of the general government debt. 
Risks to the fiscal outlook are balanced. Better-
than-expected tax collec
tion would imply higher 
revenues. On the expenditure side, some risks 

could stem from pressures for additional wage 

increases, as well as for public investment fully 

outside the EU funds programmes.

  3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
Swift growth risks draining labour market 
 78 Strong and stable growth in the short term The economy of the Czech 
Republic is forecast to grow by 4.3% in 2017, markedly more than in 
2016, when the economy expanded by 2.6%. In the 

first half of this year, both domestic and external 

demand provided stronger-than-expected positive 

contributions to GDP growth. While quarter-on-

quarter GDP growth is ex
pected to slow in the second half of the year, 2017 is set to mark the 

beginning of an investment rebound following the 

previous yearâ¢s slump. Rapidly increasing wages 

are expected to support solid household 
consumption. Net exports are also forecast to 

provide a positive contribution to GDP growth in 

2017, amid strong external demand. 
Reversion to trend in 2018 and 2019 In 2018 and 2019 GDP growth is forecast to 

moderate to 3% and 2.9% respectively, as labour 

supply constraints hinder further employment 

growth. This pace of growth is close to the 

estimated potential growth rates of the Czech 

economy. Private consumption growth is expected 

to ease slightly owing to the slowdown in 

employment growth. Investment is expected to rise 

rapidly as manufacturers are under pressure to 

invest in machinery to compensate for a growing 

scarcity of labour. Investment growth is likely to 

peak in 2018, supported by the public sector, 

before easing slightly in 2019.  
External trade regains dynamism The Czech Republicâ¢s consid
erable trade surplus is 
expected to decline slightly over the forecast 

horizon. On the one hand, export growth is 

expected to be firm in 2018 and 2019 thanks to the 

strength of global trade and the solid outlook of the 

Czech Republicâ¢s main trading partners. On the 

other hand, given the upswing in investment, as 

well as its relatively high import content, imports 

are likely to grow slightly faster than exports over 

the next two years. 
Labour market strength sets records Employment grew by 1.4% y-o-y in the first half 

of 2017, continuing the strong performance of the 

past two years. With the participation rate already 

high and the unemployment rate at a record low, 

the employment gains are likely to slow in the 

second half of 2017 and to virtually stall from 

2018 on, as a shrinking labour force acts as a 

bottleneck to growth. The unemployment rate is 

expected to reach 3% in 2017, having fallen from 

4% in 2016. Over the following two years it is set 

to stabilize at 2.9%. Real wages are forecast to 

increase strongly in 2017, propelled by a record-
low ratio of job seekers 
per vacancy. Wage growth 
is expected to stay strong
 also in 2018 and 2019, 
although it is likely to slow slightly. 
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, as 
labour shortages fuel wage pressures that could 

reduce the cost-competitiveness of exports. In 

addition, further rapid house price increases would 

worsen affordability and may cause further debt 

accumulation. 
Inflation seen landing on target HICP inflation is forecast at 2.4% in 2017, up from 
0.6% in 2016. The revival of inflation this year has

The Czech economy continues to grow steadily. GDP growth is forecast to be well above potential in 
2017 due to buoyant investment and private consumption, but is expected to moderate in 2018 and 2019. 

While exports are forecast to continue growing solidly thanks to robust global demand, their positive 

effect on GDP growth is set to be neutralised by strong import growth. The labour market is nearing full 

employment and inflation is projected to remain clos
e to the central bankâ¢s ta
rget of 2%. The headline 
government balance is on course to remain in surplus territory. 
Member States, The Czech Republic 
  79 been mainly supported by strong increases in food 
and services prices. Meanwh
ile, the appreciation of 
the koruna against the eu
ro, following the Czech 
National Bankâ¢s decision in April to remove the 

exchange rate floor agains
t the euro, is tempering 
inflationary pressures on imported goods and 

services. Inflation is expected to moderate to 2.1% 

next year and to stabilise at the inflation target of 

2% in 2019 amid expected
 increases in interest 
rates. The main contributions in 2018 are once 

again expected to come 
from food and services, 
due to base effects and rapid wage growth.  
Public balance supported by tax-rich growth The 2016 general government surplus was revised 

slightly upwards to 0.7% of GDP due to better-

than-expected tax receipts. The headline balance is 

set to remain in surplus over the forecast horizon, 

driven by a surge in tax revenues and social 

contributions. Direct taxation receipts are likely to 

be buoyed by the rising wage bill while revenues 

from VAT should benefit from recent measures to 

address tax avoidance. On the expenditure side,  
public wages are forecast to increase from 

November 2017 by 10% for public employees and 

15% for teachers.  
In 2018, the full impact of the wage hike is 
expected to become visible in public expenditure 

levels, with additional outlays from higher 

indexation of pensions and increased social benefit 

levels. However, the resulting higher expenditure 

should be partly offset by stronger tax revenues. 

Public investment is forecast to remain strong in 

light of the expiry deadline for EU funds linked to 

2015 commitments. Savings from lower debt 

servicing costs were sizeable in previous years but 

are likely to fade. In 2019, the headline surplus is 

expected to moderate to 0.6% of GDP. 
Despite the improved outlook for the headline 
balance, the structural surplus is projected to 

decline to around Â¾ pps. in 2017 as the output gap 

turns significantly positive. In the following two 

years the structural surplu
s is expected to shrink 
further. The debt-to-GDP ratio is set to decline 

from 36.8% in 2016 to 32.5% in 2019.

Solid growth with domestic headwinds 
 80 Robust economic growth ahead  Denmarkâ¢s real GDP is forecast to expand by 2.3% 
in 2017 but growth is expected to gradually decline 

to 2.0% in 2018 and 1.9% in 2019. GDP growth in 

2017 could thus reach its highest level since 2006 

and stand above its potential growth rate. The 

upswing is broad-based with all components 

expected to positively contribute to the expansion.  
Private consumption receives additional boost Private consumption expanded by 2.1% in 2016 

and is projected to climb further to 2.5% in 2019, 

supported by steady employment and disposable 

income growth. Recent po
licy measures are also 
expected to boost household demand, including the 

reduction of car taxes from October 2017, 

payments to households due to the reform of the 

voluntary early retirement scheme in 2018. Many 

households will also benefit from property tax 

repayments in 2019, since property tax was 

excessively collected since 2011 due to flaws in 
the existing property valuation system. 

Nevertheless, the household saving rate is forecast 

to remain high, because of householdsâ¢ sizable 

contributions to pension savings and continuing 

efforts to bring down debt. Government 

consumption is set to expand at a moderate pace.  
Investment lifts economic growth  Machinery and equipment investments rebounded 

in 2016 reaching their pre-
crisis levels as a share 
of GDP. With the recovery in Denmarkâ¢s main 

export markets expected to continue and industry 

capacity utilisation rates set to increase, equipment 

investment is projected to expand more quickly 

than GDP. Supported by rising house prices, 

residential investment is projected to remain an 

important driver of investment growth in the 

coming years, albeit at a gradually declining rate. 

Having expanded by 3.4% in 2016, public 

investment is expected to decelerate and negatively 

impact construction activity in 2017 and 2018.  
Foreign trade rebounds Foreign trade is forecast 
to rebound in line with 
economic growth in Denmarkâ¢s main trading 

partners. Net exports are projected to contribute 

significantly to economic growth in 2017, thanks 

largely to the revival of sea freight after a weak 

performance between 2015 and mid-2016. 

Bolstered by the pick-up in world trade, services 

exports increased significantly in 2017. However, 

import growth is projected to outpace export 

growth in 2018 and 2019 due to increasing private 

consumption and strong investment activity. As a 

result, net trade contribution to real GDP growth is 

set to remain flat in 2018 and turn slightly negative 

in 2019.  
Gradually tightening labour market  Employment growth is forecast to remain robust in 

the coming years and the unemployment rate is 

forecast to further decline from 5.9% in 2017 to 
5.5% in 2019. There are 
already signs of labour 
shortages in some sectors, particularly 

construction. 
Inflation rising slowly Price pressures have been 
subdued in recent years 
due to the steep fall in oil prices. Consumer prices 

(HICP) were flat in 2016 
but they are expected to

Graph II.4.1: 
Denmark -Real GDP growth and components, 
output gap
% of pot. GDP
Denmarkâ¢s economy is in a solid upswing with real GDP growth expected to average around 2% over 
the forecast horizon. Employment growth is projected to remain strong and unemployment rate to fall 

further despite a growing labour force. Inflation is set to pick up, but only moderately. The general 

government deficit is projected to hover around 1% of GDP. 
Member States, Denmark 
  81 rise gradually by 1.0% in 2017, 1.4% in 2018 and 
1.7% in 2019. This pick-up is supported by 

increasing wages and the less negative contribution 

of energy prices.  
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the upside  In terms of upside risks to the growth forecast, 

both household and corporate savings remain high 

in historical terms, which could support stronger 

domestic demand. Being a small, open economy, 

the rebound in world trade could provide 

additional boost to Danish exports. As regards 

downside risks, despite the ongoing reforms to 

increase labour supply, labour shortages could 

hamper economic activity in certain sectors.  
Stable public finances The general government headline balance is 

forecast to remain broadly 
stable at around -1.0% of GDP over the forecast horizon. While the 

economic recovery supports the fiscal position 

over the forecast horizon, temporary factors are 

projected to weigh on the fiscal balance. The  
deterioration of the headline balance from -0.6% of 

GDP in 2016 to -1.0% of GDP in 2017 mainly 

reflects an expected decline from the high levels 
recorded in 2016 that came from the pension yield 

tax. In 2018, new incentives to opt out of the 

voluntary early retirement scheme introduced in 

June 2017 are expected to increase the deficit by 

an estimated 0.2% of GDP in 2018. Additionally, 

the expected repayment of excessively-collected 

property taxes is expected 
to subtract an estimated 
0.6% of GDP from the fiscal balance in 2019. 
The structural balance is 
expected to hover around 
ÅÂ½% of GDP over the fo
recast horizon. This 
reflects the narrowing of the output gapâ¢s support 
of the structural position, which should offset the 

negative impact from the payments due to the 

reform of the voluntary early retirement scheme 

and the excessively collected property taxes.  
Public gross debt is projected to gradually decline 
from 37.7% of GDP in 2016 to 34.6% of GDP in 

2019, initially helped by a reduction in the general 

governmentâ¢s cash reserves, but also due to 

favourable snowball effects amid the low interest 

rate environment and buoyant economic growth.

5. GERMANY Robust growth ahead  82 Steady, robust growth Germanyâ¢s quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth 
rate came out at a robust 0.7% in the first quarter 

followed by 0.6% in the second quarter. Growth 

was driven by exports and investment in the first 

quarter and by private consumption in the second. 
Monthly indicators on industrial production and 
construction, foreign trade and employment 

suggest that economic activity in the third quarter 

is likely to show further strong growth. Economic 

sentiment remains very positive. In the 

manufacturing sector, it points to a sustained 

expansion in the coming quarters based on 

improving orders and output expectations, 

including for exports. Capacity utilisation has 

continued to increase, which bodes well for 

investment. The strong labour market, favourable 

world trade developments and a firming recovery 

in the euro area should he
lp to sustain an enduring 
upswing. Overall, real GDP is expected to increase 

at an average pace of ar
ound 2.1% per year over 
2017-2019. 
Strong labour market to support consumption 
and saving Employment growth continued and resulted in a 
further decline in the unemployment rate to a new 

post-unification low in August. Factors, like the 

low number of hours per worker, rising labour 

market participation of older workers and women, 

still significant net labour migration, as well as less 

ambitious union wage demands, have kept wage 

increases moderate so far. Nevertheless scarcity on 

the labour market is expected to intensify as 

businesses report greater difficulties in filling 

vacancies and lead to a pick-up in both nominal 

and real wage growth over the forecast horizon. 

These developments are expected to further 

improve disposable income and sustain the pace of 

consumption growth. With inflation remaining 

moderate, savings are also likely to stay high. 
Investment boost from bright demand outlook and high capacity utilisation Equipment investment is overcoming last yearâ¢s 
soft patch and is likely to strengthen amid 

favourable demand prospects, not least from the 

euro area and the rest 
of the EU. Consistently 
increasing capacity utilisation should also spur the 

effort for renewing and expanding the capital 

stock. Housing investment posted strong growth in 

the first two quarters of 2017 and is expected to 

continue increasing, even if at a moderating rate, 

given ample order book backlogs and a steady 

flow of building permits. 
Steady domestic demand growth to reduce 
still high external surplus The export outlook is expected to be favourable 
and fuel German exports. At the same time the 

strong domestic demand could keep import growth 

above that of exports and result in a further easing 

of the current account surplus ratio. 
Inflation to remain moderate Core inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed 

food) has increased from 
just above 1% over the

The German economy is expected to 
maintain a strong growth momentum over the forecast horizon 
driven by domestic demand and supported by robust world trade and a firming recovery in the euro 
area. The strength of the labour market means that real wages should continue rising, making for brisk 

private consumption growth. Improved demand prospects and high capacity utilisation are set to boost 

business investment. Housing investment may rise further but at a slower pace. Strong domestic demand 

should further narrow the current account surplus while robust growth would support an upward trend 

in the budget balance and help lower the government debt ratio. 
Member States, Germany 
  83 last two years and is expected to average 1.5% this 
year and to pick up to 1.7% over the forecast 

horizon, in the context of strong demand and 

higher wage growth. Overall headline inflation 

dynamics are projected to 
be in line with the euro 
areaâ¢s. Dampened by the 
expected stable energy 
prices this moderate inflation should support 

household purchasing power. 
Budget surpluses increasing further The favourable macroeconomic outlook supports 

the positive trend in the budget balance. The 

budget surpluses of recen
t years are expected to 
increase further over the forecast period, despite 

the repayment of a nuclear fuel tax in 2017 

amounting to around 0.2% of GDP. A tax had been 

collected in the years 2011 to 2016, but was then 
retroactively ruled unconstitutional by the German 

constitutional court, so that it had to be paid back 

in its entirety. 
Due to the recent elections, the 2018 budget is still 
to be prepared by the new government. Revenues 

are expected to develop positively supported by 

economic growth, remaining broadly stable as a 

percentage of GDP. By contrast expenditure is 

projected to decline as a percentage of GDP in 
2018 and 2019, under a no-policy-change 

assumption. Interest expenditure is set to continue 

declining although at a sl
ower pace than in 2016. 
The positive structural balance is projected to 

remain stable at around
 1% of GDP over the 
forecast horizon. Government debt, for the first 

time since 2002, is expected to fall again under the 

60% Maastricht-threshold by 2019, decreasing 

from 68.1% of GDP in 2016 to 57.9% of GDP in 

2019. This development is the result of both 

increasing budget surpluses and robustly growing 

GDP.

6. ESTONIA GDP growth seen calming after 2017 surge  84 Strong GDP growth in the first half of 2017  The latest quarterly GDP data were stronger than 
expected, with growth acc
elerating to over 5% 
(y-o-y) in 2017-Q2. This was largely driven by 

surging investment and positive external demand. 

The jump in GDP is partly explained by base 

effects, as growth was supr
essed in the first half of 
2016 due to a drop off in investment linked to the 

EUâ¢s investment funding cycle and energy sector 

downsizing linked to low global energy prices. 

Those factors have turned around abruptly in 2017. 

Estoniaâ¢s real GDP is forecast to grow by 4.4% in 

2017 and growth is expected to remain solid, 

moderating over the forecas
t horizon to 3.2% in 
2018 and 2.8% in 2019. Domestic demand is 

forecast to remain the main
 growth driver in 2018 
and 2019, with net exports providing a small 

contribution to GDP growth. In 2018, household 

consumption is set to get a boost from a significant 

personal income tax cut targeted at low and 

middle-income earners, while wage growth is 

projected to remain high amid a tight labour 

market.  
A temporary spike in investment  In the first half of 2017, the rapid growth in 

investment was largely driven by public 

investment, both EU and locally funded. After 

several years of contractio
n, corporate investment 
also picked up substantia
lly, although the pace of 

investment growth was 
distorted by a sizeable 
one-off purchase of ferries. In 2018 and 2019, 

investment growth is projected to moderate to 

more sustainable levels just slightly above GDP 

growth. Public investment is set to peak in 2018 as 

the contribution from EU funds peters out. This is 

expected to be balanced by a pick-up in corporate 

sector investment in equipment, supported by 

favourable external demand, higher corporate 

profits and rising capacity utilisation. Housing 

investment is projected to stabilise at todayâ¢s high 

levels, assuming that favourable economic and 

financial conditions persist. 
 Favourable external environment  Growth in exports has been broad-based over 

2017, both for goods and services. Still, exports 

are set to grow somewhat slower than external 

demand in 2017, given that the large and 

traditionally volatile electronics industry (which is 

dominated by a single firm) has cut output in 2017. 

Its share is high in both exports and imports, but 

not in terms of value added or GDP. Looking 

forward, Estonian exports 
are projected to rise in 
line with external demand, but more rapid growth 

will be held back by the continued rise of unit 

labour costs. The serv
ices export surplus is 
expected to keep the current account in a surplus 

of around 2% of GDP ov
er the forecast horizon. 
Employment and unemployment rise simultaneously The employment rate is currently at its historical 
peak and is projected to 
increase further over the 
forecast horizon. Remark
ably, even though the 
working age population is shrinking due to ageing, 

employment has continued to rise. Labour market 

participation is boosted by the favourable 

economic environment, the rising effective pension 

age and the positive effects from a multi-year 

work-ability reform, which 
gradually brings partly 
disabled people back to the labour market. 

However, the latter reform is also likely to add to

GDP growth was stronger than expected in the first 
half of this year due to a surge in investment. While 
growth is projected to remain ro
bust in 2018 and 2019 it will subside from 2017 levels, as investment 
growth normalises. Inflation is set to
 peak at almost 4% in 2017, driv
en by global prices and excise tax 
increases. The headline budget balance is projected to remain in a slight deficit over the forecast 
horizon. In structural terms, the deficit is estimated to be higher at 1Â½% of GDP in 2018. 
Member States, Estonia 
  85 unemployment, which rate is projected to increase 
from below 7% in 2017 to 7.7% in 2018 and 8.5% 

in 2019. Wages are projected to continue growing 

relatively rapidly at over 6% in 2017 and over 5% 

in 2018-2019.  
Energy, food and excises duties drive inflation After three years of relatively low inflation, HICP 

has exceeded the euro area average since the end 

of 2016. The jump in inflation is explained by the 

rise in global prices for food and energy (which 

have a relatively high share in Estoniaâ¢s 

consumption basket). Also, a significant impact 

from excise hikes is estimated to contribute close 

to 1 pp. to inflation in both 2017 and 2018 and 

around Â½ pp. in 2019. Inflation is forecast to reach 

3.7% in 2017 and to slow to 3% in 2018 and 2.7% 

in 2019, as global commodity prices stabilise.  
An expansionary fiscal stance The general government reco
rded a deficit of 0.3% 
of GDP in 2016. In 2017, a similar deficit figure is 

expected. Tax accrual has been uneven in 2017. It 

expanded rapidly in VAT and labour taxes (in line 

with their respective tax bases) but yields from 

corporate income tax and especially excise duties have underperformed due to growing cross-border 

purchases of excise goods. Public investment 

surged by about one quarter in 2017, reflecting the 

upturn in the EU funding cycle.  
In 2018, several new tax measures are due to take 
effect, most notably a 
significant lowering of 
personal income taxes, offset by multi-year excise 

hikes (alcohol, tobacco and fuels) and corporate 

income tax reform. The excise revenue accrual is 

impacted by stocking ef
fects ahead of scheduled 
excise rises, which can be expected to lead to a 

concentration of excise tax revenues to 2018. On 

the expenditure side, an investment programme of 

0.4% of GDP over 2018-2020 will kick off, as well 

as several new expenditure programmes in 

healthcare, education, social funding and in 

financing municipalities. Overall, the headline 

fiscal deficit is projected to increase to 0.4% of 
GDP in 2018, sliding further to 0.5% of GDP in 

2019. In structural terms, the fiscal deficit is 

estimated higher at 1% of GDP in 2017 and 1Â½% 

in 2018 and 2019, given the positive output gap. 

Public debt is expected to remain stable at around 

9% of GDP. The main negative risks to this fiscal 

projection pertain to the yield estimates of the 

various new tax measures.

7. IRELAND Rapid growth to continue 
 86 Underlying domestic demand to maintain its 
strong momentumâ In the first half of 2017
, Irelandâ¢s real GDP grew 
by 5.7% (y-o-y), well above the euro area average. 
The headline figures remain volatile and heavily 

influenced by the activities of multinational 

enterprises in the country. Modified domestic 

demand, a measure of domestic activity that strips 

out the effect of multinationals, grew at robust 

rates driven by private consumption and 

construction investment. It is expected to continue 

to expand at an average rate of 4% over the 

forecast horizon. âbuoyed by robust employment and investment in construction. The unemployment rate in Ireland fell to 6.1% in 
September and is forecast to reach 5.3% by the end 

of 2019. The strong increase in employment, 

particularly in full-time employment, is expected 

to support the further increase in labour income 

over the forecast horizon. In conjunction with 

subdued inflation, this is expected to boost 

consumer spending in the near term. 
Investment in construction is projected to 
contribute substantially to growth in domestic 

demand, with the strong momentum in residential 

property investment in 2016 expected to continue 

in the medium term, supported by government 

policies. Insufficient housing supply remains a 

challenge and is expected to show up in house 

prices and rents. Headline investment figures are 

likely to remain volatile due to the unpredictable 

investment in intangibles (e.g. patents and 

copyrights) by multinationals in Ireland. 
Inflation is expected to increase gradually. 
Consumer prices (HICP) rose only marginally in 

the first three quarters of 
2017 at an average rate of 
0.2%. This was due to increasing energy prices and 

services. However, currency depreciation in the 

UK, from which Ireland imports much, lowered 

the price of many goods, offsetting increases in the 

price of services. Over the forecast horizon, the 
effect of lower goods prices is expected to 

moderate, while higher prices for services and 

residential rents are exp
ected to nudge inflation 
slightly higher. 
Trade outlook still clouded by uncertainty The activities of multinationals in Ireland also 

have a large influence on 
the countryâ¢s export and 
import statistics. Contract manufacturing 
(114)
 weighed on goods exports in 2016 and in the year 

to June. Total exports of goods dipped by 

4.1% (y-o-y), but the contraction was offset by a 

strong increase in service exports in the first half 

of 2017. Over the same period, total imports 

declined by 1.7% (y-o-y) driven by extremely 

volatile âimportsâ¢ of intellectual property services. 

As a result, net external trade contributed 

significantly to GDP growth in the first half of 

2017. Exports are projected 
to increase in line with 
global trade while imports are predicted to gather 

momentum on the back of strong consumer 

demand, leading to a moderation of the positive 

impact of net exports on GDP growth. Given the 

ongoing negotiations on the terms of the UK 

withdrawal from the EU, projections for 2019 are 

based on a purely technical assumption of status 

quo in terms of trading relations between EU27 

and the UK. This is for forecasting purposes only 

                                                           
(114) Contract manufacturing refers to the production of goods 
abroad on behalf of Irish-d
omiciled entities for exporting.

GDP growth is projected to remain robust over 
the forecast horizon but the pace is expected to 
moderate slightly. The activities of multinational enterprises continue to distort headline figures and 
complicate macroeconomic forecasts. The government 
deficit is moving closer to balance but risks to 
the fiscal outlook remain. 
Member States, Ireland 
  87 and has no bearing on the talks underway in the 
context of the Article 50 process. 
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside  The uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook 

relates primarily to the external environment, 

including the outcome of the negotiations between 

the UK and the EU and potential changes to the 

international taxation environment and US tax and 

trade policies. A large degree of unpredictability 

remains and is related to the activities of 

multinationals with risks being on either side. 
Growth outlook positive for public finances  The general government deficit is projected to fall 

to 0.4% of GDP in 2017, an improvement of 

0.4 pps. net of one-offs 
(115)
 compared with the 
previous yearâ¢s deficit and reflecting the sustained 

pace of Irelandâ¢s economic growth. 
Cash returns for the first three quarters of 2017 
were broadly in line with government projections 

despite sizeable shortfalls 
in personal income tax, 
excise and stamp duty receipts. Overall, tax 

revenues increased by 5.4% over the twelve 

months to September, while expenditure remained

below target across all departments except in the 

health area, where slippages of around 

EUR 166 million emerged. 
Irelandâ¢s 2018 Draft Budgetary Plan includes new 
spending measures of around 0.4% of GDP and a 

moderate reduction of personal income tax. These 

expansionary measures are partly financed by 

revenue raising measures of near 0.3% of GDP. 

Due to the resilient outlook for GDP and domestic 

demand, the deficit is still expected to fall to 0.2% 

of GDP in 2018 and, based on a no-policy change 

assumption, to remain unchanged in 2019. Risks to 

the fiscal forecast are on
 the downside, mainly 
reflecting uncertainty as regards the economic 

outlook and the volatility of some sources of 

government revenues.  
The structural deficit is estimated to fall to Â½% of 
GDP in 2018 from 1
% of GDP in 2017 and to 
improve further in 2019. Gross general 

government debt is projected to fall to 69.9% of 

GDP in 2017, from 72.8% of GDP in 2016, and to 

further decline to 69.1% and 67.2% of GDP in 

2018 and 2019 respectively. This is contingent on 

continued robust GDP growth and the realisation 

of primary budget surpluses.

8. GREECE Return to growth  88 The economy is on a growth path   Real GDP in Greece grew by 
0.5% (q-o-q) in both 
the first and second quarters of this year (in 
seasonally-adjusted terms), corresponding to a rise 

of 0.6% (y-o-y) for the first half of 2017. 

Compared to the same quart
er of the previous year, 
equipment investment increased remarkably in the 

first quarter, as companie
s made their preparations 
for the tourist season, while in the second quarter 

public consumption and net exports fuelled 

growth. Private consumption increased less than 

expected in the first half of 2017, whereas 

investments in residential and non-residential 

buildings have declined compared to their levels at 

the end of 2016. Boosted by stronger demand 

overseas, international trade intensified with both 

exports and imports growin
g faster than expected. 
Growth to gain pace in the 2nd half of the year The closure of the second
 review in June 2017, 
together with the stronger-than-expected growth in 

the euro area and a favour
able tourist season, are 
expected to boost the economy in the remainder of 

the year. In the third quarter of 2017, sentiment 

indicators rose to levels not seen in a number of 

years confirming that th
e closure of the second 
review was well receive
d by households and 
companies alike. 
Real GDP is expected to grow by 1.6% in 2017 
and 2.5% in both 2018 
and 2019. The forecast 
revision for 2017 reflects mainly the weaker-than-

expected performance of private consumption in 

the first half of the year. 
On the back of a marked 
improvement in business and consumer sentiment 

and an improving labour market, both private 

consumption and investment activity are forecast 

to be robust in the second half of the year, and to 

continue to perform well in 2018. A benign 

external environment is 
expected to boost net 
exports, which should thereby contribute to growth 

this year and the next. This positive outlook is 

expected to benefit the 
current-account balance, 
with moderate surpluses forecast for the coming 

years. -15-12

 The labour market perfor
med better than expected, 
with the unemployment rate falling to 21% in July, 
down from an annual av
erage of 23.6% in 2016. 
According to quarterly national accounts data, 

employment rose by 1.5% y-o-y in the first half of 

2017, suggesting that the labour market continues 

to improve faster than the economy as a whole.  
Consumer price inflation is expected to reach 1.2% 
in 2017, mainly as a result of the rebound in 

energy prices, increases in indirect taxation and 

with average wages recovering moderately. 

Headline inflation is exp
ected to decelerate in 
2018 as the base effects from taxation and energy 

price increases fade away and are not fully 

compensated by an increase in core inflation. 
The forecast assumes a smooth completion of the 
third programme review and an orderly closure of 

the ESM stability support programme in 2018. 

Any delay in this process would be harmful for the 

recovery. Furthermore, there is a risk of a possible 

under-execution of the public investment budget in 

2018, which would hinder overall investment 

growth as well. 
The ESM programme is back on track The effective stabilisation of the economic and 

policy environment brought about by the 

conclusion of the second review has strengthened 
Greeceâ¢s economy is growing again, 
and the recovery is expected to st
rengthen as investment rebounds 
and consumption growth rises. The labour market is recovering fast and unemployment is expected to 

decline further, although average wages may increase only gradually. Public finances remain on track 

to meet the primary surplus targets agreed under the ESM programme. 
Member States, Greece 
  89 the fiscal policy outlook for this year and over the 
medium term. Monthly government statistics to 

date suggest that the 2017 general government 

primary balance target (1.75% of GDP in terms of 

the ESM programme definition) will be met, with 

the balance of risks tilted to the upside. 
(116)
 While 
income tax revenue has been somewhat below 

monthly targets, the collection of tax arrears and 

social contributions has been strong, reflecting 

improvements in the public revenue administration 

and the progress in harmonising contribution rates. 

For the most part, positive risks for 2017 derive 

from a likely lower-than-
budgeted execution of 
adopted spending targets. 
Greece is also projected to achieve the ESM 
primary surplus target of 3.5% of GDP in 2018 and 

to maintain it in 2019, as agreed in June this year 

in the context of the second review of the 

programme. The forecast takes into account fiscal 

measures adopted in 2015 and 2016 amounting to 

4.5% of GDP, the roll-out of the Social Solidarity 

Income scheme that started this year, and a post-

programme package adopted in May 2017. The 

latter includes a re-alignment of all pensions with a

new pension formula, yielding 1% of GDP savings 
in 2019. In view of the 
projected compliance with 
fiscal targets in that year, the forecast also factors 
in the implementation of the conditional package 

of offsetting social and investment spending. 
Downside risks relate to the assumption of a full 
implementation of the programme commitments, 

particularly in 2018, and the adherence to the 

expenditure ceilings agreed in the Medium Term 

Fiscal Strategy from May 2017. 
Overall, the general government balance is 
expected to reach -1.2% of GDP in 2017 before 

stabilising around 0.9% of GDP over the forecast 

horizon. In view of the projected narrowing of the 

output gap, the general government structural 

balance is forecast to be close to 3% of GDP in 

2018, before declining to around 2% of GDP in 

2019. 
Greeceâ¢s debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline 
to 179.6% in 2017 and is projected to decline 

further to 177.8% in 20
18 on account of economic 
growth and the general government surplus 

forecast for that year. The debt-to-GDP ratio is 

projected to continue on 
a downward path reaching 
170.1% in 2019.

  9. SPAIN 
Strong, balanced growth set to continue 
 90 Strong growth in the first half of the year defers 
the expected deceleration Rather than slowing as expected in spring, 
economic activity accelerated 
in the second quarter of 2017. Real GDP posted a strong 0.9% 

expansion on a quarterly basis in 2017-Q2, finally 

surpassing its pre-crisis peak. Domestic demand 

remains the main engine of growth, as strong job 

creation supports private consumption and 

residential construction investment rebounded. Net 

exports also continue to sustain GDP growth. The 

available hard and soft in
dicators signal that the 
pace of growth is easing in
 the second half of the 
year, but real GDP is still expected to increase by a 

robust 3.1% in 2017 as a whole, 0.3pps. higher 

than projected in spring.  
Growth is expected to continue easing over the 

forecast horizon, to an annu
al average rate of 2.5% 
in 2018 and 2.1% in 2019. Private consumption is 

projected to remain the main driver of growth, but 

to slow down as the pace of job creation 

moderates, pent-up demand is absorbed, and other 

factors that supported the growth of household 

disposable income in recent years, such as the 

decrease in oil prices
, abate. Residential 

construction and equipment investment are set to 

ease gradually, the latter in line with the projected 

slowdown in final demand. 
Net exports set to continue contributing to growth Exports have been accelerating this year, as Spain 
continues to record gains 
in export market shares 
and the external environment improves. Export 

growth is expected to moderate somewhat in 2018 

and 2019, despite faster growth in Spainâ¢s export 

markets, as gains in ma
rket shares slow down. 
After rebounding this year, imports are also 

expected to moderate in 2018 and 2019, in line 

with final demand. As exports are expected to 

continue growing faster than imports, net trade 

should make a significant contribution to growth  
throughout the forecast hori
zon. After widening in 
2016, Spainâ¢s curr
ent account is forecast to remain 
in a surplus of close to 2% of GDP until 2019, as 

swings in the terms of trade are largely offset by 

changes in export and import volumes and primary 

income. Spain's net external lending position is 

also expected to remain firmly positive over the 

forecast horizon. -10

remain subdued this year despite the pickup in 

inflation, partly due to a negative wage drift, and 

then gradually increas
e in 2018 and 2019. 
Productivity is expected to grow only moderately, 

leading to modest increases in nominal unit labour 

costs over the forecast horizon. However, further 

cost-competitiveness gains 
vis-Ã -vis
 the rest of the 
euro area are expected. 
Economic activity accelerated in the first half of this year, unde
rpinned by private consumption and 
exports. Growth is set to remain robust but ease going forward, driven by a slowdown in private 

consumption. The unemployment rate is projected
 to continue declining. Thanks to the positive 
macroeconomic outlook and continued expenditure restraint, the general government deficit and debt 

ratios are forecast to continue declining.  
Member States, Spain 
  91 Inflation expected to moderate again Base effects from oil price developments, the 
appreciation of the euro, 
and the pickup in core 
inflation are expected to dominate inflation 

dynamics over the forecast horizon. After a strong 

rebound in the first half of this year, headline 

inflation is forecast to moderate to an annual 

average of 2%. HICP inflation is then projected to 

decrease to 1.4% in 2018, before increasing again 

to 1.5% in 2019, as oil prices stabilise. Core 

inflation is projected to recover gradually over the 

forecast horizon, as wage
s pick up and the output 
gap turns firmly positive. 
Risks to the outlook Market reactions to recent events in Catalonia have 

remained contained. The risk exists that future 

developments could have an impact on growth, the 

size of which cannot be anti
cipated at this stage. 
On the upside, growth could benefit from a 

stronger than expected
 contribution from net 
exports, as signs of a st
ructural improvement in 
export performance and import substitution start to 

emerge. 
Strong growth continues to reduce the deficit After narrowing to 4.5% of GDP in 2016, Spainâ¢s 

general government deficit continued to decrease 

in the first half of 2017, by 0.8 pps. Available data 

for July and August point to a continued reduction 

in the third quarter. For the year as a whole, a 

general government deficit of 3.1% of GDP is 

expected. In the absence of a budget, the fiscal 

forecast for 2018 is driven
 by the relatively strong 

macroeconomic performa
nce supporting revenue 
growth and by continued expenditure restraint. 

This is expected to lead to a narrowing of the 

deficit to 2.4% of GDP in 2018. In 2019, at 

unchanged policies, it is expected to narrow further 

to 1.7% of GDP on the back of the cyclical 

recovery. Risks to the fiscal outlook mainly relate 

to contingent liabilities, in particular the impact of 

any settlement involving distressed toll 

motorways, and uncertainty about the 2018 budget. 

After deteriorating by some Â¾% of GDP in 2016, 

Spainâ¢s structural deficit is expected to improve by 
about Â¼% of GDP in 2017 and to remain broadly 

stable in 2018 and 2019. Ov
er the forecast horizon, 
the general government debt ratio is expected to 

decrease slightly to 95.5% of GDP in 2019, as a 

result of relatively strong nominal GDP growth 

and the narrowing budget deficit.

  10. FRANCE Solid growth, lower unemployment 
 92 In the second quarter of 2017, GDP growth 
reached 0.5% (q-o-q) fo
r the third consecutive 
quarter. Overall, in the 
first half of the year, 
economic activity has been primarily driven by 

strong private investment growth. On the one 

hand, corporate investment has been boosted by 

the over-amortisation scheme, a fiscal incentive for 

firms to invest. On the other hand, household 

investment has expanded at a sustained pace, 

recovering strongly after several years of 

contraction. By contrast, private consumption 

slowed as higher inflati
on ate into the purchasing 
power of households. 
Growth set to remain strong in the near future Growth is expected to remain solid in the coming 

quarters, as economic sentiment has continued to 

improve in recent months, with some confidence 

indicators reaching their highest levels since the 

2008 financial crisis. All in all, GDP growth is 

expected to reach 1.6% in 2017, 1.7% in 2018, and 

to slightly decelerate to 1.6% in 2019 as spare 
capacities in the economy are reabsorbed. 
(117)
 Private consumption growth is set to recover 

somewhat in 2018 and 2019 in line with disposable 

income, after subdued growth in 2017. 

Concomitantly, the household saving rate is 

                                                           
(117) The GDP growth figures are non-calendar adjusted. In 
2017, calendar adjusted GDP growth is forecast at 1.8%. 
forecast to increase, as part of the rise in household 

disposable income stems from tax cuts for higher 

earners, which will have a lower effect on private 

consumption. 
Investment growth is expected to remain strong in 
2017 and 2018 before cooling slightly in 2019 in 

line with economic activity. Both household and 

corporate investments are forecast to cool after an 

exceptionally strong 2017. However, public 

investment is forecast to rebound in 2018 after 

several years of contraction, in line with the local 

electoral cycle. Import growth is expected to moderate slightly in 
2017, after three strong y
ears, in line with slower 
domestic demand growth. Exports are forecast to 

gradually recover, following low growth in 2016 

and in a context of sustained global demand. As a 

result, the contribution of net exports is expected 

to gradually become less negative. 
Unemployment rate set to decline while inflation increases gradually In line with the solid grow
th expected in France, 
the unemployment rate is
 forecast to decline to 

9.5% in 2017, 9.3% in 2018, and 8.9% in 2019. 

However, employment growth is forecast to 

moderate somewhat after strong growth in 2017, as 

the effect of past cuts to the labour tax wedge 

fades. Inflation is forecast
 to increase gradually to 
1.1% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019, as a 

tighter labour market situation leads to gradually 

stronger wage increases. 
Risks to the outlook Negative risks mainly stem from the external side, 

while domestic risks are slightly tilted to the 

upside. Recent cost-competitiveness gains could 

help exporters to better absorb the euroâ¢s 

appreciation than in the 
past. Moreover, higher 
corporate investment could help boost potential 

growth, leading to self-fulfilling higher growth 

expectations. -2-1

forecast
Economic activity is forecast to 
accelerate sharply in 2017, driven by strong private investment growth 
and in particular a strong recovery in the housing mar
ket. As a result, unemployment rate is set to fall 
substantially. While the economy is expected to main
tain its current momentum in the near future, a 
slight easing is expected in the medium term, 
as spare capacities in the economy are reabsorbed. 
Member States, France 
  93 The headline deficit is projected to fall to 2.9% 
of GDP in 2017 The headline deficit is pr
ojected to decrease to 
2.9% of GDP in 2017 (after 3.4% in 2016) 
reflecting higher GDP growth and additional 

consolidation measures of more than EUR 4 bn to 

correct State expenditure. Public revenue growth is 

expected to increase this year, while expenditure 

net of tax credits is set to rise by 1.8% compared to 

a growth of 1.0% in 2016, as inflation picked up. 

The recapitalisation of AREVA is not included in 

the projection for 2017 pending a final decision by 

Eurostat on its statistical recording. 
In 2018, the headline defic
it is expected to remain 
at 2.9% of GDP. Revenue growth should remain 
strong despite tax cuts of 0.3% of GDP announced 

in the 2018 draft budget due to favourable cyclical 

conditions. Deficit-increasing measures, such as 

the housing tax exemption,
 the replacement of the 
wealth tax by a tax on real estate wealth, or the 

introduction of a flat tax on savings revenues are 

partially compensated by the increase in 

environmental taxes of around 0.1% of GDP. 

Public expenditure in nominal terms and net of tax 

credits is expected to rise by 2.6%, reflecting not 

only higher inflation but also higher public 
consumption and an increase in planned healthcare 

expenditure. The forecast 
does not incorporate the 
effect of the reimbursement of the 3% tax on 

dividends following the decision of the French 

Constitutional Court in that the timing and the 

exact amount of the reimbursements and arrears 

interest are still unknown. 
The structural balance is 
projected to worsen by around Â¼ pps. in 2018. The 

recapitalisation of AREVA and the reimbursement 

of the tax on dividends re
present clear risks for the 
forecast and for the correction of the deficit below 

3% of GDP. 
Assuming no change in policy, the deficit is 
forecast to creep back up to 3.0% of GDP in 2019 

due to the delayed effect of tax cuts. Hence, the 

revenue-to-GDP ratio is set to decrease by 

0.3 pps., whereas the expenditure-to-GDP ratio is 

expected to decline by 0.2 pps. The forecast does 

not include the budgetary e
ffect of the replacement 
of the CICE (Tax Credit 
for Competitiveness and 
Employment) by a permanent 
cut in social security 
contributions, as details regarding its final 

implementation have not been specified at this 

stage. The structural balance is projected to 

deteriorate further, by some Â¼ pps. The debt  

ratio is forecast to stabilise at 96.9% of GDP  

as of 2017.

11. CROATIA 
Growth proves resilient but risks persist 
 94 Growth remained surprisingly resilient in the first half of the year, heralding a solid 2017  The restructuring of the distressed food-processing 
and retail group Agrokor Å Croatiaâ¢s largest 

private sector employer Å appears to have had a 

smaller-than-anticipated effect on output in the 

first half of the year. In
 the second quarter, GDP 
expanded by 2.8% (y-o
-y). Over the summer 
months, industrial production and retail trade 

volumes grew buoyantly. Tourism boomed, with 

arrivals and overnight stays increasing at double-

digit rates. Coupled with strong consumer 

sentiment indicators, these trends suggest that the 

economy maintains strong growth in the second 

half of the year, pushing the expected GDP growth 

for 2017 as a whole to 3.2%. 
Growth is expected to slow down mildly over 
the forecast horizon  Domestic demand is set to remain the main driver 
of growth over the forecast horizon. While the 

impact of the recent tax reforms is gradually fading 

out, household consumption is expected to remain 

strong thanks to employment growth, rising wages 

and supportive credit conditions. Investment is 

expected to remain the most dynamic domestic 

component, with public investment enjoying a 

boost from the absorption of EU structural funds.  
After a negative reading in
 the second quarter, exports of goods are expect
ed to recover over the 
rest of the year, underpinn
ed by strong external 
demand and further inroads into EU markets. 
Exports of services, mainly through inbound 

tourism, are on the path to posting record figures. 

Both trends are seen as likely to continue over the 

forecast horizon. As str
ong internal and external 
demand ushers in dynamic import growth, the 

overall contribution of the external balance of 

goods and services is projected to turn slightly 

negative, in turn leading to a somewhat lower 

current account surplus in 2018 and 2019. In 2017, 

however, the surplus is 
expected to increase on 
account of the impact 
on the primary income 
balance of Agrokor-related provisioning in the 

financial sector.  
In all, real GDP is expected to continue expanding 
at a solid pace, but at rates below those seen in 

2016 and 2017. At this rate economic output will 

only return to its pre-crisis level at the end of the 

forecast period. The unemployment rate is 

expected to contract more modestly than in 

previous years, as the pace of job creation 

moderates and outbound migration flows diminish.

forecast
Wage pressures and higher energy prices set 
the scene for a modest rebound in inflation  The tightening labour market and wage increases 
in the public sector are projected to raise the cost 

of labour in both 2017 and 2018. This, coupled 

with the adjustment in energy prices, is set to push 

inflation up to 1.3% in 2017. Thereafter, the 

inflation rate is expected to increase slightly, with 

core inflation picking up towards the end of the 

forecast period. Risks to the forecast ar
e mainly on the downside 
and are primarily linked to the ongoing 
restructuring of Agrokorâ¢s debt and business 

operations, particularly in 2018. Agrokorâ¢s 
Growth is set to remain robust 
and broad-based in 2017
. However, economic activity
 is expected to lose 
some of its momentum over the next two years and th
e volume of GDP is only set to return to its pre-

crisis level in 2019. The potential negative impact on growth of
 the ongoing Agrokor restructuring is 
still looming. The unemployment rate is set to continue falling, albeit at a slowing pace as employment 

growth and outbound migration ease. The general government deficit is projected to remain stable, but 

with the economy still growing above its potential, 
the structural balance is set to deteriorate.  
Member States, Croatia 
  95 creditors could face financial difficulties following 
the expected partial write-offs of their claims. 

Moreover, the period of uncertainty could be 

prolonged should some debtors opt to challenge 

the outcome of the settlement, which is to be 

reached by mid-2018 accordi
ng to the special law. 
Growth and expenditure containment keep the deficit stable and the debt ratio on a 

declining path   The general government deficit decreased sharply 
to 0.9% of GDP in 2016, from 3.3% the year 

before. Revenues were boosted by the pick-up in 

economic activity, especially household 

consumption, employment and corporate profits, 

as well as the repayments of overdue tax liabilities 

accumulated in recent year
s. Additionally, primary 
expenditure growth was contained well below 

nominal GDP growth, while financing costs 

declined as debt was refinanced at lower rates. In 

spite of the impact of tax cuts, the headline deficit 

is projected to stabilize at 0.9% of GDP in 2017 
and 2018 and to decline slightly in 2019.  
In 2017, revenue growth is expected below 
nominal GDP growth. Revenues from VAT and  
social contributions are 
set to grow strongly, 
driven by rising personal consumption and 

employment. The subdued growth in personal and 

corporate income tax revenues mainly reflects the 

effects of the tax reform. Expenditure is expected 

to grow at a similar rate as revenues, driven by 

compensation of public employees, while interest 

expenditure is expected to decrease again as more 

debt is refinanced at cheaper rates. In 2018, 

revenue should be supported by stronger corporate 

and personal income taxes in spite of the negative 

impact of the Agrokor crisis, while expenditure 

should come under pressure from the negotiated 

wage increases and additional spending on war 

veterans. 
Risks on the revenue side are related to a stronger-
than-expected impact of 
the Agrokor crisis on tax 
receipts. On the expenditu
re side, risks stem from 
higher-than-expected increases in the wage bill and 

social spending, namely on war veterans. 
Following a strong improvement in 2016, the 
structural balance is for
ecast to deteriorate in 2017 
and 2018. The debt ratio is set to continue 

declining to just below 75% in 2019.

  12. ITALY Recovery is strengthening in the short term 
 96 Recovery gained further traction in 2017 In the first two quarters of 2017, real output grew 
by an average of 0.4% (q-o-q), benefiting from a 

stronger global economy and firming domestic 

demand. The drop in equipment investment at the 

beginning of the year Å partly linked to uncertainty 

about the prolongation of tax credits for private 

investment projects Å was more than compensated 

by net exports. Private consumption continued to 

increase on the back of rising consumer sentiment 
and employment growth supported by the recent 

labour market reforms. Survey indicators and 

short-term business statistics point to a similarly 

strong second half of the year. In annual terms, 

real GDP is expected to expand by 1.5% this year, 

up from 0.9% in 2016. 
Investment and exports sustain growth but the recent output expansion is set to moderate In 2018, growth is projected to moderate to 1.3%, 
while the output gap is ex
pected to close. Export 
growth is predicted to lose some strength due to 

the appreciation of the 
euro, while public and 
private consumption are projected to decelerate. 

By contrast, investment growth both in the public 

and private sector is set 
to pick up sizeably, the 
latter supported by benign financing conditions 

and the extension of tax incentives adopted with 

the 2018 budget as well as rising corporate 

profitability. 
In 2019, real GDP growth is set to decelerate to 
1.0%. Further slowing employment growth and 

rising consumer prices are likely to dampen private 

consumption growth. The expected gradual move 

to a less accommodative monetary policy stance is 

forecast to affect financing conditions and soften 

investment spending. 
By contrast, the recent
 government actions to 
address acute risks in weaker banks could help 
unclog bank lending and further reduce downside 

risks, while structural reforms are expected to lift 
potential growth. 
Employment growth expected to decelerate while wage increases remain modest After exemptions from social contributions were 
phased-out at the end of 2016, employment growth 

is set to slow down to 1.0% in 2017. The renewed 

fiscal incentives included
 in the 2018 budget for 
hiring younger workers are expected to further 

support jobs growth. Over 
the rest of the forecast 
period, however, the development of the labour 

market is expected to be more in line with 

economic activity. Employment is projected to 

increase by 0.9% and 0.6% in 2018 and 2019 

respectively. The unemployment rate is predicted 

to gradually recede from 11.3% in 2017 to 10.5% 

in 2019, while the still sizable slack in the labour 

market is set to limit wage pressures. Thus, growth 

in nominal unit labour costs is expected to remain 

contained despite weak productivity growth. 
Consumer prices are picking up, with the inflation profile shaped by base effects Headline annual HICP inflation is expected to rise 
to 1.4% in 2017, after a three-year period of near-

zero inflation. Base effect
s associated with energy 
and unprocessed foods are likely to reduce price 

pressures in 2018, partly offset by the steady 

increase of prices for non-energy industrial goods 
and services. Annual HICP inflation is expected to

Italyâ¢s economic recovery accelerat

tailwinds and lower medium-term growth prospects are expected to moderate growth towards the end of 
the forecast period. Non-energy industrial goods and services prices are set to drive higher headline 

inflation, while wage pressures remain limited. The 
general government headline deficit is predicted to 
slightly decline over the forecast period while the debt-to-GDP ratio is not expected to fall below 130%.
Member States, Italy 
  97 increase to 1.5% in 20
19. By contrast, core 
inflation is set to pick up gradually over the 
forecast period Å in line with moderate wage 

growth and the recovery of profit margins Å to 

reach 1.6% in 2019. 
The debt ratio decreases marginally In 2017, the deficit is set to decline to 2.1% of 

GDP, down from 2.5% in 2016. This is due to 

lower interest expenditure and an increase in 

current primary expenditure (of around 1.6%) in 

nominal terms which is below nominal growth 

(2.1%). In particular, past pension reforms, 

moderate increases in public wages (frozen since 

2010) and healthcare expenditure still curb 

expenditure dynamics. Despite a reduction in the 

corporate income tax rate from 27.5% to 24%, the 

tax burden is expected to remain broadly stable 

mainly due to the additional revenue measures 

adopted in April 2017. Still, the structural balance 

is set to slightly deteriorate in 2017, by about Â½ 

pps. of GDP. 
In 2018, the headline deficit is forecast to slightly 
decrease to 1.8% of GDP, due to higher nominal 

growth (2.6%) and some deficit-decreasing 

measures put forward in the 2018 budget. These 

include a spending review at both ministerial and 
local level, the introduction of compulsory 

electronic invoicing for priv
ate sector transactions, 
the postponement to 2019 of a simplified tax 

regime for small enterprises (IRI) previously 

legislated for 2018 and measures to fight tax 

evasion. On the other hand, additional 

deficit-increasing measures like a permanent 

three-year reduction of so
cial security contribution 
for new hires and measures to support investment 

are set to support growth. Moreover, further 

resources are earmarked to renew public 

employeesâ¢ contracts. Overall, the structural 

balance is estimated to only marginally improve  

in 2018. 
In 2019, under a no-policy change assumption, the 
deficit is forecast to increase again to 2.0% of 

GDP. The structural balance is set to deteriorate by 

about Â½ pps. of GDP in 2019. 
The debt ratio, after reaching 132.0% in 2016, 
stabilised in 2017 at 132.1% of GDP also due to 

additional resources earmarked for public support 

to the banking sector and retail investors. 

Thereafter, the debt-to-GD
P ratio is expected to 
marginally decline to 130.8% in 2018 and to 

130.0% in 2019, mainly due to stronger nominal 

growth.

 98 Growth accelerates Cyprusâ¢ economy accelerated 
in the first half of 
2017 and GDP growth is expected to reach around 
3.5% for the year as a whole.
 In the first half of the 
year, the economy grew by 3.6%, well above 

expectations, following a strong revision of the 

first quarterâ¢s data. Driven by domestic demand, 

growth is expected to remain strong, but to ease in 

2018 and 2019 to 2.9% and 2.7% respectively.  
Growth was driven by private consumption and 
strong investment, with public consumption also 

contributing positively. Private consumption 

continues to benefit from pent-up demand and is 

expected to remain the main growth driver, 

supported by steadily rising household disposable 

income amid robust employment and expectations 

for wage increases. Moreover, consumer 

confidence is buoyant, well 
above pre-crisis levels.

Cyprus -Real GDP growth and contributions, 
output gap
After years of subdued and volatile investment 
levels, gross fixed capital formation in the first half 

of 2017 was solid, reaching a share of 19% of 

GDP, just below the EU average. Construction 

investment was particularly strong, linked to 

tourist accommodation and residential properties. 

Strong momentum in investment is set to continue, 

with leading indicators in the construction sector 

pointing to a strong second half of the year. 
Further support is expected from the recovery in 

the real estate market and very sizable tourism-

related projects planned in the coming years. 
Net exports were weak in the first half of 2017 due 
to a fall in exports, particularly of goods, that 

rising exports of services were unable to fully 

offset, despite record numbers of tourists and a 

20% increase in tourism revenues. At the same 

time, imports remained stable. However, when 

excluding one-offs related to ship purchases in 

2016, imports have increased in line with 

consumption and investment growth. 
Strong labour market and modest inflation Employment growth has gathered steam in 2017, 

increasing by more than 3% (y-o-y) in the first half 

of 2017. All sectors 
(except agriculture) 
contributed positively, with employment in the 

construction sector rising fast. The unemployment 

rate fell below 11% in mid-2017. The strong 

performance of the labour 
market is expected to continue over the coming years, with the 

unemployment rate set to fall to 9.3% in 2019.  
Inflation accelerated somewhat in the first half of 
2017, driven by energy prices and unprocessed 

food. With the effect of past increases in oil prices 

expected to fade away, headline inflation is set to 

moderate in the second half of the year, leading to 

an average rate of around
 1.0% for the year as a whole. In 2018-19 inflation is expected to rise 

moderately, driven by wage pressures. 
Risks to the growth outlook are broadly balanced. 
Downside risks mainly pertain to the still very high 

share of non-performing loans, the macroeconomic 

prospects of the UK, one of the key trading 

partners of Cyprus, and possible delays in 

construction of tourism-related projects. Among 

upside risks, buoyant confidence leading to 

stronger domestic demand and a more pronounced 

economic recovery in the re
st of the EU could spur 
growth more than expected. 
Economic growth has exceeded expectations in recen
t quarters. It is forecast to reach 3.5% in 2017 and 
to ease but remain robust over 2018 and 2019. Do
mestic demand is expected to be the main growth 
driver. Unemployment is set to continue falling and inflation is expected to remain moderate. On the 

fiscal side, headline surpluses are expected between 2017 and 2019, underpinned by a favourable 

macroeconomic environment.  
Member States, Cyprus 
  99 Continued general government surplus  The fiscal performance of Cyprus continues to be 
strong and has again outperformed the 

governmentâ¢s budgetary targets. In 2017, the 

general government balance is expected to 

improve further, reaching 
a surplus of 1.1% of 
GDP. The general government primary surplus is 

also forecast to increase 
to 3.5% of GDP, while 
remaining one of the high
est in the euro area in 

2017. In structural terms, this corresponds to a 

surplus of about Â½% of GDP. 
The strong fiscal performance in 2017 is expected 
to be driven by high revenue collection, 

underpinned by the favourable macroeconomic 

situation and positive developments in the labour 

market. More specifically, total revenue is forecast 

to increase by 0.8 pps. of GDP as a result of 

significant revenue increases in both direct and 

indirect taxes and social security contributions. 

These gains are expected to be partially offset by 

the abolition of the immovable property tax and 

the termination of the temporary wage levy. 

Furthermore, the governmentâ¢s signature of gas 

exploration contracts for 2017-2019 will contribute 

to a rise in revenue (of 0.2 pps. of GDP in each of 

these years). Public expenditure is expected to 
increase but at a slower pace (by 0.2 pps. of GDP), 

mainly due to higher spending on intermediate 

consumption, compensation of employees 

following the hiring of additional personnel for 

security forces, as well as
 the projected rise in public investment. 
In 2018, under a no-policy change assumption, the 
fiscal surplus is expected
 to increase to 1.4% of 
GDP. The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to 

remain broadly stable, while the expenditure-to-

GDP ratio is set to decline only slightly. In 2019, 

the general government surplus is forecast to 

further increase to 1.9% of GDP, on the back of 

the cyclical recovery and a 
rise in social security 
contributions (by 0.4 pps. of GDP). The structural 

balance is forecast to be close to a balanced 

position in both 2018 and 2019. Over the medium-

term, downside risks to the forecast stem from the 

reform of the healthcare sy
stem and the absence of 
a mechanism regulating public sector payroll 

growth beyond 2018.  
Public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline 
and fall below 100% of GDP by 2018. As a result 

of the expected continuous primary surpluses and 

positive nominal growth, general government debt 

is forecast to reach 93.9% of GDP in 2019.

 100 Growth recovers remarkably in 2017 Economic growth exceeded 4% in the first half of 
2017, up from 2.2% in 2016. Strong wage growth 

drove household consumption and inflation, to 

some extent. The dramatic decline in investment in 

2016 looks set to be fully compensated by double-

digit growth in 2017, while an improving external 

outlook has benefited exports. All demand

Growth set to remain strong in 2018 and 2019 The investment upswing is expected to extend into 
2018 by which time EU structural fund 

disbursements should reach their normal levels. 

Household consumption is forecast to remain solid 

on the back of rapidly rising wages, which will at 

the same time increasingly
 translate into higher 

inflation, dampening real
 growth. Tax cuts are 
expected to add some more fuel to the domestic 

demand in 2018, but are unlikely to impact 2019 

growth much. 
Trade is on the up Increasing demand from both the EU and Russia is 

set to lift goods export growth to some 4% in the 

coming years. Service exports, by contrast, are 

forecast to slow down as demand for transit 

services from Russia is falling. Import growth is 

set to spike in 2017 due to renewal of the AirBaltic 

fleet. It is projected to remain high in 2018 and 

2019 in line with strong domestic demand. The 

current account balance is set to deteriorate, 

mainly as a result of higher imports.  
Wage growth set to translate into prices Despite virtually no employment growth, the 

unemployment rate is set to decline to 7.3% by 

2019. The shrinking labour
 force therefore exerts 
strong pressure on wage growth, which will be 

further boosted by a substantial increase in the 

minimum wage. Wage growth is expected to jump 

to around 10% in 2017, also due in part to a 

reduction in undeclared 
wages. Over the forecast 
horizon, wage growth is set to slow to more 

sustainable levels. 
The rebound in energy prices proved to be mild 
and short-lived, but a surprise spike in food prices 

pushed HICP inflation to almost 3% in the first 

half of 2017. While the impact of energy prices is 

expected to wane by the end of the year, high wage 

growth is expected to ensure that inflation stays 

close to 3% in both 2018 and 2019.  
Fiscal position controlled despite reform costs The government deficit is expected to be 0.9% of 

GDP in 2017. The forecast 
of government revenue 
forecast has been revised up by some 0.4 pps., 

compared to the spri
ng forecast, but the 
governmentâ¢s decision to pre-pay support for 

electricity production carries previously unplanned 

costs of 0.5% of GDP. The better-than-expected 
The confluence of thriving consumption, greater fo
reign demand and a strong rebound in investment is 
set to push Latviaâ¢s GDP growth above 4% in 2017. Once the initial boost from the investment recovery 

wanes, growth should ease but remain over 3% in 2018 and 2019, due to strong consumption and 

improving external demand. The shrinking labour force will continue to drive down unemployment and 

stoke wage pressures. Inflation is likely to average around 3% in 2017 and stay thereabout in 2018 and 

2019 on the back of rapid wage growth. The government deficit is expected to be contained at 1% of 

GDP in 2018 and 2019 despite the large costs of tax reforms. 
Member States, Latvia 
  101 performance of tax revenues is linked mainly to 
the pick-up in wages.  
In 2018, the government deficit is projected at 
1.0% of GDP, compared to
 a forecast of 1.8% in 
spring 2017. The bulk of the improvement is 

explained by revised tax reform plans. Notably, the 

revenue loss associated with the transition to a new 

corporate income taxation system is largely shifted 

out to 2019. Other measures were also adjusted 

with a deficit-improving effect. The overall effect 

of the tax reform measures is still revenue reducing 

-0.2% of GDP in 2018. The reduction of the 

standard rate of personal income tax from 23% to 

20% costs 0.7% of GDP and the changes in 

corporate income tax reduce revenues by 0.3% of 

GDP. These are partly compensated by the 

increases in excise duties (+0.2% of GDP), 

tightening administration of VAT (+0.3%) and 

aligning taxes on both wage and capital income at 

20% rate (+0.1%). Moreover, the social 

contributions rate is due to be increased by 1 pp. 

yielding 0.3% of GDP, which is ear-marked for 

financing a 0.7% of GDP increase in healthcare 

spending. Other spending increases amount to 

0.5% of GDP, including for social benefits and 

road infrastructure. The spending measures are  
financed from revised revenue projections and 

through the expenditure re
view process (0.3% of 
GDP). 
In 2019, the government deficit is projected at 
1.1% of GDP under a no-policy-change 

assumption. While the costs of the tax reform are 

expected to weigh on tax revenues (-0.8% of 

GDP), economic growth dynamics should support 

revenue growth. Expenditure growth is projected 

to be based on a further increase in social 

spending, while the increase in the public sector 

wage bill should be contained by reforms that 

reduce the number of public sector employees. 

Moreover, investment expenditure is set to 

stabilise after a surge in new EU financed projects 

in 2017 and 2018. Latviaâ¢s structural deficit is 

expected to increase to 1Â¾% of GDP in 2017 and 

2018 before declining to 1Â½% of GDP in 2019. 
The government debt is expected to fall to 39% of 
GDP in 2017 and should decline further to about 

36% of GDP in 2018 and 2019. The debt dynamics 

reflect fluctuations in expected cash balances, 

while the underlying debt ratio is on a downward 

path, as nominal GDP 
growth outpaces the 
governmentâ¢s net borrowing.

  15. LITHUANIA GDP growth to moderate after surging in 2017 
 102 Strong start of 2017 GDP growth reached 4.1% ye
ar-on-year in the first 
half of 2017 on the back of robust growth in 
private consumption and a jump in exports and 

private investment. Strong wage increases 

continued to support private consumption, but 

rising inflation and contracting employment due to 

negative demographic trends and emigration 

started to limit its growth. Private investment grew 

strongly at the start of 2017, but EU funds-driven 

public investment failed to gather pace at the start 

of the year. During the first half of 2017, export 

growth surpassed expectations as a result of 

favourable trends in international trade. 

Meanwhile, import growth also picked up notably 

due to the high import content of exports and 

investment. Inflation acceler
ated significantly on 
the back of rising energy
, food and service prices.

Investments and exports are set to support 
growth over the forecast horizon GDP is forecast to grow by 3.8% in 2017 and to 
slow down to 2.9% in 2018 as exports, investment, 

and private consumption growth is set to moderate. 
Rising inflation and contracting employment are 
starting to weigh on household consumption even 
though wage growth, which supports real 

disposable income, remains strong. A sluggish 

uptake of EU investment funds is dragging down 

public investment growth, but it is expected to pick 

up in 2018. Strong growth in mortgage credit is set 

to improve investment performance as well, 

although an increasing stock of newly-built 

residences may moderate such support. 
Exports are set to benefit 
over the forecast horizon 
from the positive economic outlook in both the EU 

and Russia, though the pace 
of growth is expected 
to moderate due to rising real unit labour costs. 

Import growth in 2018 and 2019 is expected to 

slow down in step with exports. Although exports 

continue to grow, the contribution of net trade to 

growth is expected to be close to neutral in 2017 

and slightly negative in the next two years. 
Risks to the forecast are 
balanced as potential 
downsides from geopolitical developments are 
countered by cautious optimism about a 

strengthening recovery in Lithuaniaâ¢s main export 

markets. 
The labour market is tightening  In 2017, after six years of employment growth, the 

number of employed persons started to shrink. 

Despite a significant increase in the participation 

rate among older workers, negative demographic 

trends and emigration are expected to see 

employers lose around 0.3% of their staff annually 

between 2017 and 2019. Shrinking supply and 

high demand for labour should drive the 

unemployment rate down to 7.3% by the end of 

2017, which is low by historical standards. 

Consequently, the unemployment rate is forecast 

to decline to 6.8% in 2018 and to 6.4% in 2019. 
Inflation spikes in 2017 and is set to remain 
strong thereafter HICP inflation is set to r
each 3.8% in 2017 before 
decreasing in 2018 and 2019. Inflation is currently 
A strong boost in exports and investment is set to
 power GDP growth to 3.8% in 2017. As exports, 
investment, and private consumption growth slow down, however, GDP growth is forecast to moderate 
to 2.9% in 2018 and 2.6% in 2019. At the same time, rising inflation is forecast to take its toll on private 

consumption, by eating into real disposable income growth. Employment is expected to shrink as the 

labour supply approaches its limit. Lithuania is exp
ected to maintain a genera
l government surplus over 
the forecast horizon helped by the 
rise in tax-rich economic growth. 
Member States, Lithuania 
  103 driven by a substantial but short-lived surge in 
energy prices combined w
ith a pronounced hike in 
excise duties at the start of 2017, as well as by a 

strong boost in service prices partially fed by an 

increase in the minimum monthly wage. The 

impact of these factors is set to moderate over 

time, leading to a moderation of inflation in 2018 

and 2019. Solid wage growth driven by a shortage 

of qualified workers, however, is set to keep core 

inflation elevated over the forecast horizon. 
High growth helps fiscal improvement Lithuania is expected to maintain a general 

government surplus over the forecast horizon. The 

buoyant labour market continues to support a 

strong collection of payroll taxes, while the 

government contains an overall expenditure 

increase to smoothen economic growth. 
The 2016 general government surplus is set to 
contract slightly to 0.1% of GDP in 2017. This 

decrease is mostly explained by the costs of 

structural reforms (0.5% of GDP), as well as an 

increase in public wages, pensions and in the 

non-taxable income threshold. These additional  
costs and revenue losses are to be offset by the 

boost in revenues from
 accelerating tax-rich 
economic growth helped by
 a set of tax increases 
and efforts to improve tax compliance. Assuming 

continued expenditure restraint, the general 

government surplus is forecast to rise to 0.2% of 

GDP in 2018 and 2019. 
Risks to the public finance forecast are tilted to the 
upside, due to expectations of robust growth in the 

tax base, but may materialise only if the 

government maintains discipline in expenditure 

growth. 
The structural deficit is expected to increase to 
close to 1% of GDP in 2017 and to stay at this 
level until 2019. This change of the structural 

deficit in 2017 is mostly explained by the increase 

in the positive output gap. 
The general government debt is set to increase 
form 40.1% of GDP in 2016 to 41.5% in 2017 due 

to the end-of-year pre-financing of forthcoming 

bond redemptions in 2018. The debt-to-GDP ratio 

is forecast to gradually decline to 38.9%  

by 2019.

  16. LUXEMBOURG Sustained, broad-based growth 
 104 Scope for further growth in 2017 Following a significant revision in its National 
Accounts, Luxembourgâ¢s economic growth is 

projected at 3.4% in 2017. In the first half of the 

year economic activity grew below expectations. 

Nevertheless, conditions remain favourable and the 

latest indicators point to an increasing momentum 

in the second half of the year.  
Private consumption is expected to recover after a 
weak performance in the first half of 2017, mainly 

on the back of strong
er employment creation 
among residents, while the impact of income gains 

from the tax reforms and the wage indexation 

measures implemented in January was lowered by 

the surge in consumer prices. High householdsâ¢ 

indebtedness and increasing debt burdens, could be 

also affecting consumption growth. In 2017, 

private investment will be mainly driven by the 

satellite and aircraft industry, while growth of 

construction investment is forecast to remain 

robust throughout th
e forecast horizon.  
The contribution to growth from the financial 

sector, traditionally Luxembourgâ¢s main growth 

engine, strengthened in the first half of 2017, 

underpinned by the euro areaâ¢s recovery. The fund 

investment industry set new records, while the 

profitability of the banking sector was maintained, 
in spite of the high costs that new regulatory 

standards have entailed. The latest indicators 

suggest a continuation of these trends in the second 

half of the year. 
Stable and balanced growth ahead In 2018, sustained employment creation, the 

implementation of the next wage indexation 

(projected for mid-2018) and lower inflation are 

expected to continue to support private 

consumption and domestic demand growth. The 

external sector is expected to remain solid, 
supported by an improved external environment, 

especially in the euro area. Overall, GDP is 
forecast to grow by 3.5% in 2018, with a more 

balanced, and broad-based composition. 
In 2019, consumption growth is projected to ease 
further, with income gains fading away and 

inflation progressively taking effect. The external 

sector, which is dominated by financial services 

exports, is expected to remain robust, even if 
receding, in line with fina
ncial markets prospects.  
Sustained employment creation In 2017, employment growth is expected to rise to 

3.1% from 3.0% in 2016. Strong economic 

momentum should support stable employment 

creation throughout the forecast period. Resident 

employment (excluding frontier workers, who do 

not count as part of Luxembourgâ¢s active working 

population) rose markedly, helping to curb the 

unemployment rate, which was 6.3% in 2016. The 

unemployment rate is forecast to stabilise at 

around 6.0% by the end of
 the forecast horizon. 
A change of inflation drivers Headline HICP inflation is forecast to reach 2.1% 

in 2017 from zero in 2016, mainly as a result of oil 

price movements. As these effects dissipate, 

underlying price pressures, including from wage 

increases, should drive th
e headline inflation rate 
to 1.9% in 2019, after 1.7% in 2018.

Economic growth is projected to accelerate further in
 2017 and 2018, albeit tape
ring off before slightly 
decelerating by the end of the forecast horizon. 
Employment growth is set to remain solid, while 
unemployment is expected to decrease
 further. Inflation is projected to be driven mainly by underlying 
price pressures, as the influence of energy prices fades. In spite of the implementation of a tax reform 
that decrease the overall tax burden, public finances are projected to remain sound. 
Member States, Luxembourg 
  105 Rising revenues offset expenditure growth In 2017, the general government surplus is 
projected to decline to 0.5% of GDP from 1.6% of 

GDP in 2016. The drop is mostly explained by the 

impact of the tax reform enacted by the 

government at the start 
of the year to increase 
householdsâ¢ purchasing power and the countryâ¢s 

competitiveness. The reforms are expected to 

shave revenues from households and corporates by 

about 0.8% of GDP. Finally, additional revenues, 

equivalent to 0.3% of GDP, will be lost, due to a 

cut from 30% to 15% in the share of VAT 

revenues that Luxembourg earns from e-commerce 

related transactions. 
Expenditure growth is also projected to rise as for 
effect of the automatic wage indexation, which 

took place at the start of the year. Public 

investment is expected to further expand while the 

wage bill should grow faster given the impact of 

the implementation of the recent wage agreement 

in the public sector.  
In 2018, the general government surplus is 
expected to marginally decline further to 0.3% of 

GDP. Buoyant revenue growth underpinned by 

strong underlying economic growth will be 
outpaced by growth in 
government expenditure, 
especially still high spending for infrastructure 

investment. 
Based on a no-policy-change assumption, the 
surplus of the general government balance is 

projected to slightly improve in 2019. This 

projection includes the purchase of a military plane 

for a cost estimated at 
around 0.3% of GDP.  
Mirroring the evolution of
 the headline balance, a 
substantial drop in the structural balance from 

2.0% to around Â½% of GDP is projected in 2017. 

In the light of the closing of the output gap towards 

the end of the forecast period, the general 

governmentâ¢s structural 
surplus is expected to 
further diminish in 2018, although it should remain 

in positive territory. In 2019, the structural surplus 

is expected to stabilise as the slight improvement 

in the headline position is offset by the more 

positive output gap.  
After declining to 20.8% in 2016, Luxembourgâ¢s 
debt-to-GDP ratio is set to increase to 22.9
% by 2019, as the government must issue debt to cover 

its deficit, since the surplu
s of the social security 
sector cannot be used for this purpose.

17. HUNGARY Maturing cycle driven by domestic demand 
 106 Vigorous domestic demand in 2017 In the first half of 2017, Hungaryâ¢s real GDP 
growth increased to 3.7% (y-o-y). Economic 

growth has remained primarily driven by private 

consumption and boosted by investment. Gross 

fixed capital formation grew by 25% in the first 

half of 2017, as the absorption of EU funds 

resumed under the new multiannual financial 

framework. Domestic demand dynamics were also 

underpinned by high consumer confidence and 

rapid growth in disposable income on the back of 

very fast wage rises and continued employment 

growth. Trade flows accelerated in the first half of 

2017, but import growth 
outpaced export growth, 
largely reflecting strong domestic demand. As a 

consequence, net exports
 are set to contribute negatively to real GDP growth in 2017 and 

Hungaryâ¢s high current account surplus is 

projected to decrease.

Fast growth to continue in 2018 and 2019 Real GDP growth is project
ed to increase by 3.6% 
in 2018, supported by further fiscal loosening, but 
to slow to 3.1% in 2019
 as capacity constraints 
emerge. Private consumption and household 

investment are projected to expand strongly in 

2018, boosted by both government-initiated and 

market-driven wage increases, and supported by a 
strong recovery in bank lending. Corporate and 

public investments are forecast to continue to grow 

by double digits as EU-funded projects are 

completed. At the same time, strong domestic 

demand is set to result in fast import growth. Net 

exports are expected to remain negative, despite 
the projected improvemen
t in trade performance 
due to capacity upgrades 
in the automotive sector. 
In 2019, economic growth is set to slow down as a 

result of a build-up in capacity constraints, the 

decline in the growth of real disposable income, 

and moderating trade with the maturing expansion 

in the EU.  
Tight labour market and price pressures 
underline the cyclical position Employment continued to expand to reach new all-
time-highs in the first half of 2017 and is expected 

to grow further. The improvement in the labour 

market started already in 2013, supported by the 

public work scheme. In the first half of 2017, the 

number of public workers 
decreased significantly but private labour demand quickly absorbed the 

difference. As a result, the unemployment rate is 

expected to fall to a record low of 4.2% in 2017. 

The labour market is becoming increasingly tight. 

Labour shortages are generating strong wage 

growth and limiting the prospects for further 

employment growth in 2018 and 2019.  
HICP inflation accelerated to 2.3% (y-o-y) in the 
first half of 2017 and is
 projected to accelerate 
further as domestic-driven price pressures 

accentuate. Nevertheless, headline inflation is 

expected to remain in 
check over the forecast 
horizon, staying within the target band (3% Â±1 pp.) 

of the central bank, as long as energy and 

unprocessed food pri
ces remain steady.  
Domestic risks to the forecast are broadly 

balanced. On the upside, significant investment 

and wage push may increase productivity beyond 

what is expected in the baseline. On the downside, 

overheating risks are appearing, as reflected in the 

positive output gap, elevated asset prices, double-

th going forward, but capacity constraints are 
expected to build up. The labour market is becoming increasingly tight and price pressures are expected 

to increase over the forecast horizon. The structur
al balance is expected to deteriorate as a result of 
fiscal loosening. 
Member States, Hungary 
  107 digit wage growth and tightening labour market, 
accompanied by a loose fiscal stance and 

accommodative monetary policy. 
Expansionary fiscal policy In 2017, the general government deficit is forecast 

to rise to 2.1% of GDP. This mainly reflects 

substantial tax cuts, most notably the lowering of 

employersâ¢ social secu
rity contributions and 
corporate income tax, but also partly reflecting 

expenditure increasing measures. These measures 

are compensated to a c
onsiderable extent by 
increasing temporary revenues, extra tax receipts 

on the back of dynamic wage growth and the 

continuing decline of interest outlays and social 

spending. 
The headline deficit is expected to increase in 2018 
to reach 2.6% of GDP
. Social security 
contributions are to be reduced further alongside 

VAT cuts on selected items. The forecast also 

takes into account a considerable deficit increasing 

effect stemming from the phasing-out of one-off 

receipts from land sales and a temporary extra 

revenue component in corporate income tax. While  
the absorption of EU funds is expected to expand, 

government spending without EU funds is forecast 

to grow rather moderately relative to nominal 

GDP. In 2019, based on a no-policy-change 

assumption, the deficit is projected to decrease 

somewhat to 2.3% of GDP. 
The main risks to the forecast deficit are related to 
the planned investment projects. Although the 

forecast already takes into
 account the possibility 
of a slower-than-planned expansion of investment 

spending, delays in implementation could result in 

a lower deficit, in particular in 2017-18. At the 

same time, tight operating budgets for healthcare 

providers could trigger expenditure slippages. 
In structural terms, the budgetary position is 
estimated to loosen with the structural balance 

deteriorating from -2% of GDP in 2016 to -3Â½% 

by 2018. Although the pre-financing needs of 

EU-funded projects incur a debt increasing effect 

during 2017 and 2018, the debt-to-GDP ratio is 

expected to decline steadily thanks to high nominal 

GDP growth. It is proj
ected to decrease from 
73.9% in 2016 to below 70%  

by 2019.

  18. MALTA Current account and budget balance surpluses cement  108 Growth momentum remains strong Real GDP grew strongly by 6.3% in the first half 
of 2017. External demand looks set to be the main 

driver of growth in 2017 with domestic demand 

playing a secondary role due to a strong 

contraction of investment (reflecting a high base in 

2016). Real GDP growth is
 forecast to reach 5.6% 
for 2017 as a whole, marg
inally higher than the 

rate recorded in 2016. Strong export growth, 

particularly in services, and a fall in imports 

related to the contraction in investment is pushing 

up the current acco
unt surplus, whic
h is forecast to approach 10% of
 GDP in 2017. 
Private consumption drives growth in the near-
term Real GDP growth is projected to slow somewhat in 
2018 to 4.9%. Private consumption is expected to 

become the main driver of growth on the back of 

an increasing population and growing disposable 

income. In addition, improved consumer 

confidence and consumption is expected to result 

in a somewhat lower household saving rate. 

Investment is forecast to recover, led by the 

residential construction sector which is expected to 

continue growing strongly in 2018. Exports are 

forecast to continue rising, in line with growing 

demand among Maltaâ¢s main trading partners, 

resulting in a further increase in the current 

account surplus. 
In 2019, real GDP growth is projected to slow 

down to 4.1%, below potential output. Private 

consumption is projected to
 remain the main driver 
of growth, while all demand components are 

forecast to contribute positively. Investment is 

expected to increase modestly, mainly on the back 

of the construction sector. 
Price pressures remain moderate Despite a very low unemployment rate and 

increasing skill shortages, wage growth was 

moderate in the first half of 2017. Strong increases 

in labour supply, also on the back of inflows of 

foreign workers, served to dampen the upward 

pressure on wages. As the increase in labour 

supply moderates over the forecast horizon, wage 

growth is forecast to improve. Despite concomitant 

gains in productivity, unit labour costs are 

projected to rise faster 
than the euro-area average 
in 2018 and 2019. 
Relatively moderate increases in regulated fuel 
prices have contained overall HICP inflation, 

which is forecast to av
erage 1.3% in 2017, 
marginally below the euro
-area average. Thereafter 
inflation is projected to strengthen to 1.8% in 

2019. Higher price growth
 is expected to come 
mainly from the services component, which is 

projected to rise in line with growing disposable 

incomes.  
Risks to the macroeconomic projections are linked 
primarily to the outlook for investment, private 

consumption and net exports. A faster realisation 

of planned infrastructure projects could boost 

growth in the near term. At the same time, more 

conservative savings behaviour by households 

could limit consumption, thus dampening real 

GDP growth. A favourable relocation of financial 

services operators linked 
to the process of the UK 
leaving the EU could also affect GDP growth, 

particularly in 2019. Finally, in view of Maltaâ¢s 

openness to trade (nominal exports and imports 

combined to reach 270% of GDP in 2016) any 

volatility in Maltaâ¢s main exporting sectors would 

have a disproportionately large impact on real 

GDP growth.

Real GDP growth is projected to remain robust, albeit moderating from the peak in 2014 and 2015. The 
positive output gap is set to gradually close amid record-low unemployment and moderate wage growth. 

The current account and the budget balances are set to remain in surplus. 
Member States, Malta 
  109 Government balance to remain in surplus In 2017, the government balance is projected to 
remain in surplus, at 0.9% of GDP. Revenue 

growth is supported by the favourable 

macroeconomic and labour market conditions, 

high corporate profits, consumer demand and the 

proceeds from Maltaâ¢s citizenship scheme. 

Overall, total revenue is expected to increase by 

less than nominal GDP. Current expenditure is 

projected to increase on the back of a growing 

public wage bill and intermediate consumption, 

only partly mitigated by a decrease in interest 

expenditure. Capital expenditure, net of EU funds, 

is projected to decr
ease only marginally. 
In 2018, after incorporatin
g the expected impact of 
the measures introduced with the 2018 Budget, the 

fiscal surplus is expected
 to decline to 0.5% of 
GDP. In line with robust
 real GDP growth and a 
strong labour market, and despite the reduction in 

taxation worth 0.2% of GDP, tax revenues are 

expected to continue growing. Yet, following 

expected lower proceeds
 from the citizenship 
scheme, overall current revenue growth is 
 expected to slow down. 
In spite of increases in 
social spending related 
to the budget measures 
(among which is an increase in pensions by â¢2 per 

week), current expenditure 
growth is projected to 
weaken and interest expenditure is set to 

marginally decrease. Net public investment is 

forecast to remain stable, as the implementation of 

investment projects co-financed by the EU picks 

up. In 2019, under a no-policy-change assumption, 

the fiscal surplus is expect
ed to remain stable at 
0.5% of GDP.  
The structural balance as 
a percentage of GDP is 
estimated to be broadly balanced in 2018. In 2019 
it is estimated to increase further to Â½ % of GDP 

thanks to a rapid closure of the positive output gap. 

The government debt-to-GDP ratio, which fell 

below the 60% threshold in 2016, is forecast to 

decline further to 48.8% in 2019.  
Risks to the fiscal outlook 
are balanced as higher 
current expenditure and related slippages in 
budgetary execution could be compensated  

by higher proceeds from the citizenship 

programme.

19. THE NETHERLANDS 
Strong growth performance to continue 
 110 Robust economic expansion to continue Economic growth is expected to reach 3.2% in 
2017, based on a particularly strong second 

quarter. Forward-looking indicators point to 

continued steady growth, further fuelled by an 

expansionary fiscal policy announced by the new 

government in the 2018-2021 Coalition 

Agreement. The new govern
ment plans an increase 
in both government consumption and public 

investment in 2018, mostly in the areas of social 

affairs (in particular child-related benefits), 

defence and education. These measures have a 

strong direct impact on domestic demand, which 

combined with robust underlying momentum, is 

expected to lead to a growth rate of 2.7% in 2018. 

The initial impact of the policy stimulus is 

expected to fade slightly in 2019 but growth is 

expected to remain solid at 2.5%.  
Growth is projected to be driven predominantly by 
domestic demand, with household consumption 

and investment as the main drivers, followed by 

government consumption. With the expected pick-

up in inflation in 2019 negatively affecting real 

disposable income, private consumption growth is 

expected to decline slightly. Both public and 

private investment are pr
ojected to show steady growth. Non-financial corporations are likely to 

enlarge their capital stock now that capacity 

utilisation rates have return
ed to pre-cr
isis levels. 
At the same time, this is partially offset by a slow-

down in residential investment, which has 

recorded very high growth rates in recent years. 

Export growth is expected to slow down as higher 

wages and prices weigh on international price 

competitiveness. Imports are set to be driven by 

buoyant domestic demand, thus limiting the 

growth contribution of net exports in this 

expansionary phase. The current account surplus is 

projected to reach 9.1% in 2017 and is set to 

decline to 8.7% in 2018 and 8.4% in 2019.  
Rising house prices  House prices grew on average by almost 

7.5% (y-o-y) over the first 8 months of this year. 

While house prices are still 5% below their 

pre-crisis peak, they have grown more than 20% 

compared to their trough in June 2013, although 

there are substantial 
regional differences. 

Importantly, the current increase in house prices 

doesn't seem to be debt-driven, as total mortgage 

debt is hardly growing. 
Record-breaking employment rate in sight In 2017, employment growth
 is expected to reach 
2.1%. For the following years the underlying speed 

of employment growth is set to decline, even 

though the new government's policy package leads 

to a further increase in demand for workers in both 

the public and the private sector. Overall, 

employment is forecast to 
grow by just less than 

2% in both 2018 and 2019. As a result, the 

employment rate (of 15-74 year olds) should reach 

an all-time high of 72% in 2019. The 

unemployment rate is expected to decrease from 

4.8% of the labour force in 2017, to 4% in 2018 

and 3.5% in 2019.

The Dutch economy is expected to grow by 3.2% in 2017 and by 2.7% in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019, 
supported by a fiscal stimulus package. Unemployment is forecast to fall below 4% in 2019, while 

wages and inflation are set to pick up. As a result, cost competitiveness is set to deteriorate slightly, 

having a dampening effect on the current account. Despite the significant fiscal expansion planned, the 

headline balance is expected to remain in surplus o
ver the forecast horizon.
 General government debt 
has fallen below 60% of GDP and is expected to decline further. 
Member States, The Netherlands 
  111 Accelerating wages and prices While wage growth has remained subdued, it is 
forecast to pick up over th
e forecast horizon as the 
labour market tightens and supply constraints 

become more pronoun
ced. Trade unions are 
formulating substantially higher wage demands 

than in previous years. HICP inflation was 

relatively muted in 2016 but is expected to rise to 

1.3% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018 on the back of 

base effects in energy prices and a recovery of 

services price inflation in line with domestic price 

pressures. Inflation is set to accelerate to 2.2% in 

2019 as the planned increases in indirect taxes 

(VAT and energy taxes) kick in.  
Budget in balance, debt below 60% The budgetary situation has improved markedly 

over the last few years. In 2017, the general 

government balance is set to reach a surplus of 

0.7% of GDP. Looking ahead, the general 

government surplus is forecast to deteriorate in  
2018 as a result of the planned fiscal stimulus. For 

2019, the headline budget balance is set to improve 

again as revenues are exp
ected to pick up in line 
with robust economic growth.  
In structural terms, the bu
dget balance is expected 
to deteriorate by about Â½ a percentage point in 
2018, due to both the decline in the nominal 

surplus and an increase in
 the output gap. As the 
fiscal stimulus fades and nominal GDP increases 

substantially in 2019, the budget is expected  

to be almost balanced in structural terms  

by 2019. 
The general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio 
has fallen below 60% this year. A budget surplus, 

strong economic growth and sizable stock-flow 

adjustments through privatisations of financial 

institutions are expected to lead to a government 

debt level of 57.7% in 2017. The debt ratio is 

forecast to continue to 
decline to 54.9% in 2018 
and 51.5% on the back of strong economic growth 

and fiscal surpluses

20. AUSTRIA 
Strong growth dynamics supported by domestic demand 
 112 Entering an upswing After showing signs of strengthening in 2016, the 
pace of GDP growth acceler
ated markedly in the 
first half of 2017. The pick-up in private 

consumption, triggered by tax reforms in 2016, has 

given new impetus to investment, further 

strengthening domestic demand. After a weaker 

period last year, exports have enjoyed a resurgence 

in 2017, leading to 
a noticeably positive 
contribution of the external balance to GDP 

growth. With robust domestic and external 

demand, Austria has entered an upswing phase. 
Favourable outlook During the second half of 2017, strong domestic 

demand is expected to continue supporting GDP 

growth, almost doubling this year to 2.6% after 

1.5% in 2016. 
In 2018 and 2019, growth is expected to maintain 
its momentum at 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively. A 

slight slowdown in domestic demand is expected 

to be partly offset by str
onger external trade, as the 
outlook for the world economy in general, as well 

as that of Austria's Ea
st European neighbours 
should benefit Austrian exporters. Robust export 

growth should stimulate investment in machinery 

and equipment, while construction investment is 
supported by continuing strong immigration 

increasing housing demand. 
Strong economy reverses rising trend in 
unemployment The strong economic activity in 2017 is supporting 
a rise in employment that is set to exceed growth 

in the labour force. As a consequence, the 

unemployment rate is reversing its trend and 

dropping for the first time in several years. After 

6.0% in 2016, unemployment rate in Austria is 

expected to decrease to 5.6% in 2017 and to fall 

further to 5.4% in 2019. Immigration from 

neighbouring European countries may dampen the 

drop in unemployment, while several government 

measures aim to increase
 the participation and 
employment of older workers and women. 
Stronger HICP and core inflation Oil prices are set to driv
e headline HICP inflation 
up to 2.0% in 2017 and then again down to 1.6% 

in 2018. On the back of rising prices for industrial 

goods and processed food, core inflation is set to 

increase from around 1.5% 
in the past years to 

2.0% in 2017 and then moderate to about 1.9% 

until 2019. Austria's inflation rate is expected to 

remain above the euro area average, as inflation in 

services continues to be 
strong. Austria's tourism 
sector is also doing well, as some tourists are 

avoiding popular foreign destinations such as 

Turkey and North Afri
ca that are currently 
experiencing political unrest, leading to price 

pressure on accommodation and restaurant 

services. 
Public finances to benefit from economic 
growth After worsening to -1.6% of GDP in 2016 because 
of personal income tax reforms, the government 

headline balance is expected
 to recover to -1.0% of 

GDP in 2017, thanks to economic growth. In 2017, 

revenues are projected to
 grow strongly, with

The outlook for Austriaâ¢s economy is favourable. Growth
 is expected to strengthen robustly in 2017 and 
should continue to expand at almost the same pace until 2019. Domestic demand, supported by dynamic 
investment, is expected to be the main growth driver. Strong growth in exports suggests that foreign 

trade should provide a boost to o
verall growth. Public finances are exp
ected to benefit from favourable 
economic trends, despite the costs of recent government measures. 
Member States, Austria 
  113 security contributions reflecting the rise in 
employment. Revenues from value-added taxes are 

expected to benefit from rising consumption, and 

partly from the delayed e
ffect of measures against 
tax fraud implemented in 2016. At the same time, 

taxes on production paid by corporations are set to 

decline due to the legislat
ed reduction in employer 
contributions to the Family Burden Equalisation 

Fund, Familienlastenausgleichsfonds
. Government 
expenditure is expected to increase only 

moderately, also thanks to lower debt servicing 

costs and improvement in the labour market which 

means lower expenditure on unemployment 

benefits. 
In light of the recent national elections, fiscal 
projections for 2018 and 2019 rely on a no-policy-

change assumption. In 20
18, the headline balance 
is projected to slightly improve to -0.9% of GDP, 

with the positive trend in government revenues 

expected to continue, although at a slightly lower 

rate.  Revenues from taxes on production are 

projected to further decline due the additional cuts 

in employer contributions and the substantial 

reduction of the bank levy. Growth in government  
spending is expected to slightly accelerate, due to 

several measures approved in 2017. Subsidies are 

set to increase mainly due to the ï¬employment 

bonusï¬, reimbursing half of employer's social 

security contributions for newly-hired employees 

over their first three year
s. In 2019, the headline 
balance is projected to improve further to -0.6% of 

GDP, with revenues still benefitting from 

economic growth and expenditure increasing 

mildly, on a no-policy-change basis.  
Refugee-related expenditure is expected to slowly 
decline from 2018 onwards, while costs for bank 

support, which had a big impact on public finances 

up to 2015, are projected to remain very low in the 

coming years. 
The structural balance is expected to remain 
broadly stable over 2016-2019, fluctuating around 

-1% of GDP. Government debt ratio is projected to 

decline significantly in 2017, mainly due to the 

progressive wind-down of bad banks included into 

public accounts. In 2018 and 2019, the government 

debt ratio is expected to continue declining at a 

relatively fast pace.

21. POLAND Solid growth driven by domestic demand 
 114 Strong GDP growth in the first half of 2017 The first half of 2017 w
itnessed a strong increase 
in private consumption and an accumulation of 
inventories, while investment activity remained 

weak. Despite a sizeable hit from negative net 

exports, GDP increased by 1.1% (q-o-q) in both 

the first and the second quarters. Private 

consumption was the main growth driver, 

supported by solid increases in wages and 

employment. Public investment took tentative 

steps towards an expected
 rebound, while private 
investment trends varied across sectors. Weak 

investment was largely explained by continued 

falls in sectors such as energy, other public utilities 

and mining, with a large presence of publicly 

owned and publicly controlled companies. 
Robust growth outlook Real GDP growth is proj
ected to reach 4.2% in 
2017 and 3.8% in 2018, before moderating to 3.4% 

in 2019 with an increasingly positive output gap. 

Growth is expected to be led by domestic demand 

with private consumption supported by favourable 

labour market trends and record-high consumer 

confidence. Some slowing down of consumption 

towards the end of the forecast period is expected, 

as higher inflation reduces household real 

disposable income and employment gains slow. 
Following several quarters of weakness, 
investment activity is projected to gradually 

recover from the second half of 2017. Public 

investment growth is expected to be particularly 

strong in late 2017 and early 2018, due to a higher 

utilisation of EU structural funds. The rebound in 

private investment is forecast to be more gradual, 

supported by factors such as strong domestic and 

foreign demand, high capacity utilisation and easy 

access to funding. 
Exports are expected to continue expanding, with 
further gains in export market shares. Strong 

domestic demand and in particular higher 
investment and a slight appreciation of the zloty 

are projected to lead to 
a fast increase in imports. 
As a result, the contribution of net exports to 

growth is set to stay negative in 2017 and 2018 

before turning minimally positive in 2019.

Tight labour market and rising inflation Labour force participation is
 projected to rise at a 
slower pace, partly due to the lowering of the 
retirement age that took 
effect in October 2017. 

With the unemployment rate now at record lows, 

employment gains are forecast to decelerate as 

wage growth strengthens. 
Inflation is projected to
 average 1.6% in 2017, 
rising to 2.5% in the second half of 2018 and just 
under 3% in the second half of 2019. Price 

pressures, particularly in 
the services sectors, are 
set to arise mainly from labour market 

developments.  
Balanced risks Risks to the macroecono
mic forecast are broadly 
balanced. On the upside, lower economic policy 

uncertainty (e.g. in the energy sector) could lead to 

stronger private investment. Further gains in 

labour force participation or a change towards 
Faster wage growth, moderate employment gains and strong consumer confidence are set to sustain 

private consumption as the main growth driver. In
vestment activity is expected to gradually recover, 
largely due to a higher utilisation of EU funds. A tightening labour market is expected to lead to faster 

price increases, particularly in the services sector
. The headline government deficit is projected to drop 
considerably in 2017 and to remain broadly stable in 2018-2019. However, strong growth implies that 

the cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit is set to increase. 
Member States, Poland 
  115 more permanent immigratio
n could support private 
consumption, particularly in 2019. On the 
downside, labour shortages could become a barrier 

hampering investment, while faster wage growth 

could translate into higher inflation, which would 

weigh on real disposable income growth and 

consumer sentiment. In addition, uncertainty 

surrounding the rule of law could affect economic 

activity more negatively than expected. 
Stable headline and increasing structural government deficit The headline general government deficit is forecast 
to substantially narrow to 1.7% of GDP in 2017, 

mainly thanks to higher tax revenues and social 

contributions. The expected rise in revenues from 

indirect taxes is due to improved macroeconomic 

fundamentals, a number of measures to increase 

compliance implemented in 2016 and 2017, and a 

two-year extension of th
e application of higher 
VAT rates. Simultaneously, the revenues from 

direct taxes and from social contributions reflect 

mainly the strong labour market. 
In 2018, the headline fiscal deficit is projected to 
remain stable at 1.7% of GDP. Favourable  
macroeconomic conditions are set to support 

revenue growth. Expenditures are forecast to rise 

mainly as a result of the large increase in public 

investment and the lowering of the statutory 

retirement age. 
Under a no-policy-change assumption, the 
headline general government deficit is expected to 

slightly widen to 1.9% of GDP in 2019. Public 

investment is projected to continue growing, while 

tax revenue growth is forecast to moderate. 
The structural deficit is set to narrow to 2% of 
GDP in 2017 from 2Â¼% of GDP in 2016. 

However, against the background of strong 

economic growth and a consequently increasing 

positive output gap, the structural deficit is forecast 

to widen again to 2Â¼% of GDP in 2018 and further 

to 2Â½% of GDP in 2019. 
The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is set 
to decline from 54.1% at end-2016 to 53% of GDP 

at the end of 2019.

Growth and employment to perform strongly  116 Investment and exports push up growth Economic growth picked up to 2.9% in the first 
half of 2017, mainly driven by investment and 

exports, while private consumption growth 

continued to slow. Investment rose to 10% (y-o-y) 

in the first half of the year, supported by both 

construction and equipment. Net external demand 

made a slightly positive contribution to annual 

growth, reflecting the strength of net service 

exports, particularly tourism. Overall, GDP is 

forecast to increase by 2.6% in 2017, before 
decelerating to 2.1% in 2018 and 1.8% in 2019. 

Risks to the outlook remain slightly tilted to the 

downside, mainly due to the countryâ¢s 

vulnerability to external shocks.

The Commissionâ¢s Economic Sentiment Indicator 
for Portugal moderated in the third quarter of 2017 

but remained significantly
 above its long-term average. In parallel, consumer confidence 

deteriorated and retail trade slowed down, 

suggesting that private consumption growth may 

also flatten out along with a small increase in the 

household saving rate. Investment in construction 

is not expected to reach pr
e-crisis levels any time 
soon and its growth is set to weaken somewhat 

after its rebound this year. Following a big jump in 

2017, equipment investment
 is expected to ease 
somewhat before picking 
up again in 2019. These 
fluctuations are largely due to the base effect from 

a large boost to investment this year that came 

from a capacity upgrade in the countryâ¢s biggest 

automotive company that is set to fade away in 

2018. 
External flows remain balanced Exports of goods and services increased 

substantially in the first half of 2017, supported by 

external demand. The ongoing expansion in the 

automotive industry and the continuous positive 

cycle in tourism are expe
cted to keep exports 
growing well above demand from main trading 

partners in both 2017 and 2018. In 2019, export 

growth is expected to be more in line with external 

demand, as the impact of car manufacturing and 

tourism is set to weaken. Imports are projected to 

grow at a similar rate to exports over the forecast 

horizon, reflecting a rebound in equipment 

investment and the high import content of car 

manufacturing. As a result, the current account is 

set to retain a small surplus, also supported by an 

improvement in net interest transfers. 
Job creation outpaces GDP growth Employment grew faster than GDP in the first half 

of 2017, particularly in labour-intensive services 

related to tourism and in construction. Wage 

growth remained subdued at the aggregate level, as 

most of the job openings were in sectors with 

low-skill profiles and lower-than-average salaries. 

The job-rich recovery reduced substantially both 

the headline and long-term unemployment rates 

and supported economic activity as the labour 

force increased despite a drop in the working age 

population. Accordingly, the unemployment rate is 

set to drop from 11.2% in 2016 to 9.2% in 2017, 

the lowest level since 2008, and further to 7.6% in 

2019 amid some slowdown in job creation and a 

moderate increase in wages. 
Inflation moderates despite one-off triggers After a one-off rebound in the spring triggered by 

energy prices and the Easter calendar effect, 
GDP and employment are set to increase significantly in 2017 driven by exports and investment. 

Despite some slowdown, economic performance is expected to remain strong in 2018 and 2019 amid 

further export growth and lower unemployment. The general government deficit is set to remain below 

1.5% over the forecast horizon while the structural balance is projected to remain broadly unchanged.  
Member States, Portugal 
  117 consumer price inflation moderated in the summer 
months. HICP inflation is projected to remain 

relatively stable at 1.5% in 2017, 1.4% in 2018 and 

1.5% in 2019. Core inflation is expected to be only 

marginally higher, reflecting the impact of tourism 

on accommodation services and moderate wage 

dynamics. House price inflation rose from 7.1% in 

2016 to 8% y-o-y in the second quarter of 2017, 

along with a significant increase in property 

transactions. Demand for real estate is expected to 

remain strong but the impact on prices is likely to 

be at least partly offset by growing supply from 

new construction. 
Public finances benefitting from the recovery 
and lower interest expenditure The headline deficit is pr
ojected to decrease to 
1.4% of GDP in 2017, mainly due to the 
accelerated economic recove
ry, decreasing interest expenditure and lower-than-budgeted public 

investment. The general government deficit net of 

one-offs is expected to r
each 1.6% of GDP. As the 
improvement in the headline deficit is mostly 

cyclical in nature and not accompanied by 

discretionary fiscal consolidation measures, the  
structural balance is expected to improve only 

slightly in 2017. The head
line deficit is forecast to remain stable at 1.4% of GDP in 2018 due to a 

more negative impact of one-off operations while 

the deficit net of one-offs is set to improve to 1.2% 

of GDP. As the impact of discretionary measures 

and savings in interest expenditure in 2018 is 

expected to be broadly neutral, the structural 

balance is projected to remain broadly stable. 

Under a no-policy-change assumption, the 

headline deficit is set to improve slightly in 2019 

to 1.2% while the structural balance is set to 

remain broadly unchanged. The structural primary 

balance is forecast to deteriorate by about Â½% of 

GDP over the forecast horizo
n. Risks to the fiscal 
outlook are tilted to the downside, linked to 

uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic 

outlook and the potential deficit-increasing impact 

of banking support measures in 2017. 
After reaching 130.1% at the end of 2016, 
Portugalâ¢s gross public debt-to-GDP ratio is 

forecast to decline to 126.
4% in 2017, 124.1% in 
2018 and 121.1% in 2019, due to primary budget 

surpluses and higher nominal GDP growth.

  23. ROMANIA Consumption-led growth 
 118 Private consumption is booming Growth accelerated in 
2017, with real GDP 
expanding by 5.8% (y-o-y) in the first half of the 
year. The pick-up in growth has been mostly 

driven by private consumption, spurred by tax 

cuts, significant hikes in both public and private 

wages, and low rates of inflation. Changes in 

inventories also made a substantial positive 

contribution to growth in the first half of 2017, 

while investment remained subdued mainly due to 

a slow uptake of projects financed by EU funds 

under the 2014-20 programming period. The 

booming private consumption also drove an 

acceleration of imports. As a consequence, net 

exports have worked as a drag on real GDP 

growth, despite relatively strong export growth. 
Growth set to decelerate but remain above potential The output gap is estimated to have closed in 2017 
and is projected to expand in 2018 and 2019, with 

GDP growth slowing down but remaining above 

its potential growth rate. GDP is forecast to grow 

by 5.7% in 2017, 4.4% in 2018, and 4.1% in 2019. 

Private consumption is pr
ojected to decelerate in 
2018, as inflation increasingly weighs on real 

disposable income, but is expected to continue 

acting as the main growth driver. Furthermore, 

investment is forecast to strengthen on the back of 

a pick-up in the implementation of projects 

financed by EU funds. 
The current account deficit widens Import growth is projected to continue outpacing 

that of exports, in line with strong private 

consumption. Accordingly, net exports will remain 

a drag on real GDP gr
owth over the forecast 
horizon. The weakening of Romaniaâ¢s trade 

balance is expected to lead to a gradual widening 

of the current account defic
it, which is forecast to 

reach 3.1% of GDP by 
2017, 3.2% in 2018 and 
3.4% in 2019.

 Labour market tightening and inflation picks up The economic expansion has prompted a continued 
improvement of the labour market, with the 

unemployment rate dropping to its lowest levels in 

more than twenty years. This low unemployment 

rate, coupled with a declining labour force and 

persistent skills shortages, has led to very tight 

labour market conditions. Wage growth has 

accelerated in 2017, also driven by a 16% 

minimum wage hike which took effect in 

February, as well as by public sector wage 

increases. This trend is projected to continue in 

2018 given approved increases in public wages. 
After two consecutive years of falling consumer 
prices, inflation turned positive in 2017, despite 

being dampened by VAT rate cuts and lower 

excise duties on fuel. For the year as a whole, 

HICP inflation is expected
 to stand at around 1%. 
Headline inflation is projected to further pick up as 

wage hikes pass through to consumer prices and 

the effect of tax cuts fades away Å or, in the case of 

excise duties, the cuts themselves are reversed. 
HICP inflation is forecast to re-enter the National 

Bank of Romaniaâ¢s target band (2.5% Â± 1 pp.), 

reaching 2.9% in 201
8 and 3% in 2019. 
Real GDP growth accelerated in 2
017, driven mainly by private consumption. Looking ahead, growth is 
set to decelerate but remain above 
potential. Unemployment fell to its 
lowest levels in more than twenty 
years in 2017 and is expected to remain low over the forecast horizon. Inflation has turned positive and 

is set to further pick up as the output gap widens. The budget deficit is projected to increase due to 

public wage increases projected in the unified wage law. 
Member States, Romania 
  119 Risks to the growth forecast The possible tightening of
 the central bankâ¢s 
monetary policy in response to emerging inflation 
pressures and a widening output gap could dampen 

the outlook for both private investment and 

exports. Investment could also be adversely 

affected if the government were to further cut 

public investment in orde
r to reach its budgetary 
deficit targets. The continuing increase in unit 

labour costs, due to wage growth outpacing 

productivity growth, could also curtail Romania's 

exports. More generally, uncertainty regarding the 

governmentâ¢s policies could also hamper growth. 
The fiscal stance remains expansionary In 2017, the general government deficit is 

projected to remain at 3.0% of GDP. Tax cuts (in 

particular a cut of the standard VAT rate by 1 pp.) 

have reduced tax revenues. On the expenditure 

side, public wages and social benefits were 

considerably incr
eased. On the other hand, public 
investment was cut significantly in the 

Septemberâ¢s budget rectification.  
In 2018, the general government deficit is 
projected to increase to 3.9% of GDP. The unified 
wage law (UWL), enacted in summer 2017, is set 

to increase all public wages by 25% in January 

2018 and contains additional increases for doctors 

and teachers. Moreover, the personal income tax 

(PIT) rate is set to be cu
t from 16% to 10%. These 
measures are to be partially compensated by an 

announced shift of social security contributions 

from the current 22.75% for employers and 16.5% 

for employees to 2% (so-called solidarity 

contribution) and 35% respectively. The deficit is 

projected to reach 4.1% of GDP in 2019 under a 

no-policy change assumption. 
As a consequence of fiscal easing and an 
increasing output gap, Romaniaâ¢s structural deficit 

is forecast to rise from around 2Â¼% in 2016 to 

around 3Â¼% in 2017 and around 4Â½% in 2019. 

Despite strong GDP growth, the debt-to-GDP ratio 

is thus projected to rise from 37.6% of GDP in 

2016 to 40.5% in 2019. 
No draft 2018 budget has been published at the 
cut-off date of the forecast and several of the 

announced measures still need to be 

operationalised. This represents a risk (positive or 

negative) to the fiscal projections. This is 

particularly the case for the changes to the social 

security contributions and to the PIT.

  24. SLOVENIA Broad-based expansion  120 Solid growth in the first half of 2017 Slovenia's economy continued to grow at a strong 
pace in the first half of 2017, as real GDP 

increased by 4.8%, surpassi
ng its pre-crisis peak. 
Domestic demand continued to expand. Investment 

increased by 10% in the first half of 2017, driven 

by a rebound in public investment, supported by 

the start of the new EU financing cycle. At the 

same time, private consumption grew by 3.4%, 

boosted by growing disposable income and upbeat 

consumer confidence. Ex
port growth remained 
strong and outpaced import growth, further 

contributing to the current account surplus. Solid 

growth is set to continue in the second half of the 

year, leading to a real GDP increase of 4.7% in 
2017.

Graph II.24.1:
Slovenia -Real GDP growth and contributions, 
output gap
% of pot. GDP
Expansion to continue in 2018 and 2019 Real GDP growth is forecast to reach 4% in 2018 
and 3.3% in 2019, driven mainly by domestic 

demand. Private consumption is expected to 

remain strong over the forecast horizon, supported 

by growing employment, wages and bank lending. 

Similarly, investment is expected to grow at a high 

rate due to the combination of strong external and 

domestic demand with improving financing 

conditions and stronger corporate balance sheets. 

High growth in industrial production, very high 
capacity utilisation in the export sector, and 

growing export markets are creating room for 

further investment in production capacity. At the 

same time, demand for construction work is 

gradually strengthening and growth in construction 

investment is expected to
 accelerate. In addition, 
the improved take-up of EU funds is set to boost 

investment further in 2018 and 2019. Export 

performance is expected
 to remain robust, 
supported by stable unit labour costs and continued 

gains in price competitiveness. Imports are 

forecast to grow in line with domestic demand, 

gradually neutralising the growth contribution of 

net exports. Slovenia's cu
rrent account surplus is 
expected to decrease moderately in both 2018 and 

2019. 
Risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the upside. 
These are primarily domestic in nature, as 

improving sentiment and better access to credit 

could further support investment, particularly in 

residential properties. Downside risks are mainly 

external and relate to the future development of 

energy and raw material prices. 
Inflation set to remain moderate while wage growth accelerates Employment growth remains high in most sectors 
as increasing exports, consumption and investment 

boost labour demand in the economy. Employment 

is expected to continue to grow by 1%-2% over the 

forecast horizon, but decelerate as labour shortages 

increase in the tightening labour market. As a 
result, the unemployment 
rate is expected to 

decline from 8% in 2016 to 5.2% in 2019. As the 

forecast unemployment rate approaches its natural 

rate, wage pressures are set to rise. Compensation 

per employee is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2017 

and by around 3.2% in 2018 and 2019.  
HICP inflation accelerated towards 2% (y-o-y) in 
the first quarter of 2017 but slowed thereafter, 

largely driven by base effects. Overall, consumer 

prices are projected to in
crease by 1.6% in 2017. 
Both headline and core inflation are expected to 
Economic growth reached 3.1% in 
2016 and has further a
ccelerated in 2017, driven by exports, private 
consumption and investment. The economic expansion has been accompanied by rising employment and 

wage growth. Companies have continued to invest to meet growing demand from both domestic and 

international markets. Public finances are projected to continue to improve, reflecting the favourable 

macroeconomic outlook. 
Member States, Slovenia 
  121 remain moderate over the forecast horizon. HICP 
inflation is forecast to reach 1.5% in 2018 and 

1.8% in 2019. 
General government balance continues to 
improve In 2016, the general government deficit decreased 
to 1.9% of GDP from 2.9% in 2015, mainly due to 

higher revenues and a drop in public investment 

linked to the ending of the previous EU funding 

period. 
In 2017, the government deficit is expected to 
decline to 0.8% of GDP as a result of strong tax 

revenues and social contributions. Public 

investment is expected to 
increase after a plunge of 
nearly 30% in 2016. Both the compensation of 

public employees and pensions are expected to 

continue rising. 
In 2018, the general government balance is 
expected to be 0.0% of GDP as tax revenues and 

social contributions continue to grow strongly and 

interest expenditure is expected to decrease 

significantly. At the same time, the compensation 

of public employees and expenditure on social  
benefits are projected to
 increase further due to 
wage increases and an extraordinary indexation of 

pensions. Public investment is expected to grow in 

line with the dynamics of the current EU 

multiannual financial framework. Under a 

no-policy-change assumption, the general 

government balance is exp
ected to record a surplus 
of 0.4% of GDP in 2019, mainly due to economic 

growth and improved labour market conditions.  
The main downside risks to public finances over 
the forecast horizon stem from building 

expenditure pressures, particularly on wages and 

pensions.  
In structural terms, Sloveniaâ¢s fiscal position is 
expected to be broadly unchanged between 2016 

and 2018 and improve slightly in 2019. This takes 

place in a context where the output gap is 

projected to turn positive in 2017 and increase 

strongly thereafter. 
The debt-to-GDP ratio peak
ed at 82.6% in 2015, 
but started to decrease in 2016 to 78.5% of GDP. 
Supported by the economic recovery and reduced 

precautionary cash buffers, 
public debt is forecast 
to decline steadily to 72.0% in 2019.

  25.SLOVAKIA
Growth strengthens, the labour market tightens 
 Recovery fuelled by household spending 
Slovakia
s real GDP growth is expected to remain 
solid at 3.3% in 2017 and to gradually increase to 
around 4% in 2019. Private consumption is set to 
become the key driver of growth, supported by 
higher employment, robust increases in real wages, 
low credit costs and buoyant consumer sentiment. 

Economic growth is also expected to benefit from 

a revival in investment and increasingly positive 

contributions from net trade over the forecast 

horizon. Strong economic growth is likely to feed 

through to all segments of the economy, including 

the upbeat housing market. At the same time, a 
shrinking supply of skilled workers, coupled with 
rising demand for labour, is a potential bottleneck 

for the Slovak economy. 
Investment and net exports set 
to grow 
Investment showed a somewhat erratic pattern in 
2017, with a swift recovery in the first quarter 
followed by a substantial fall in the second. On an 

annual basis investment is projected to return to 

growth in 2017 and to accelerate thereafter, driven 

by private investment in the automotive industry 

and major public investment projects such as the 

Bratislava ring road. The completion of a new car 
factory is anticipated to cause investment growth 
to peak in 2018. At the same time, delays in major 
infrastructure projects due to litigation, along with 
a relatively slow use of EU investment funds, 

could dampen the investment rebound in the near 

term. Slovakia
s export growth is set to pick up 
again over the forecast horizon thanks to rising 
foreign demand and expanded production 
capacities in the automotive sector. The 
contribution of net trade to GDP growth is likely to 

increase until 2019 as import growth, which is 

partly investment-fuelled, is nonetheless outpaced 

by exports. 
Labour demand stimulates wages 
As the robust economic recovery bolsters the 
labour market, the unemployment rate is expected 

to gradually fall below 7% in 2019. Employment 

gains are likely to remain strong and broad-based 

across sectors, contributing to increases in the 

participation rate as employment prospects for 

previously inactive persons improve. At the same 
time, the tightening of the labour market along 
with increasing labour shortages in some sectors 

and regions is bound to drive up nominal wage 
growth, particularly in an environment of rising 

consumer prices. Nominal wage growth is 

projected to climb to almost 5% in 2019, allowing 

real wages to increase by around 3% annually over 
the forecast horizon. 
Consumer inflation set to increase 
Headline inflation has firmly entered positive 
territory and is projected to reach 1.3% in 2017, 
with accelerating food and services prices 
contributing most to the rebound. By contrast, 
energy prices are projected to decline throughout 

2017, mainly due to a reduction in administered 

prices for electricity and gas at the beginning of 

the year. Core inflation (excluding energy and 

unprocessed food) is expected to pick up 

significantly to 1.7% in 2017 and to gradually rise 
thereafter, reflecting vibrant consumer expenditure 
and wage pressures. 
Slovakia
s economic expansion is expected to maintain a robust pace in 2017 and to strengthen 
thereafter, with private consumption as the main contributor to growth. Household spending 
is set to 
benefit as the labour market continues to strengthen. Strong labour demand in some regions and sectors 
is expected to put upward pressure on nominal wages. Inflation is likely to increase further, supported 
by favourable demand conditions. The go
vernment deficit is projected to decrease steadily.
 Member States, Slovakia 
 Headline deficit on a declining path 
The general government deficit outturn for 2016 
was larger than expected in the spring forecast, 

having been revised to 2.2% of GDP due to lower-

than-anticipated corporate income tax and 

dividend revenues. Nevertheless, fiscal 

consolidation is projected to continue in 2017, with 

the headline deficit forecast to decline to 1.6% of 
GDP. The adjustment is likely to be supported by 
strong VAT and labour tax revenues reflecting 

improving private consumption and labour market 

conditions, respectively. Tax revenues are also 
expected to be supported by several policy 
measures, including a higher levy on regulated 
businesses and higher ceilings on social and 
healthcare contributions. 
The favourable economic environment is expected 
to continue to support consolidation in 2018. In 

addition, a new 7% tax on dividend revenues is 

projected to contribute positively to public 

revenues despite a parallel scrapping of healthcare 
contributions paid on dividends. On the other 
hand, the abolition of the minimum corporate 

income tax,
 introduction of voluntary 13
th and 14
th monthly salary as well as exempting pensioners
 who work on contract agreements from paying 
social security contributions will reduce revenue. 
The government has further adopted several 

expenditure-increasing measures,
 including an ad-
hoc pension increase for those who retired before 

2004, and extra outlays on public wages and social 

benefits. A drop in the drawdown of EU funds will 

reduce co-financing needs and consequently also 
lower investment financed from the national 
budget. In the absence of additional measures, the 

headline deficit is projected to decline to 
1% of 
GDP in 2018. Assuming a strong rebound in the 
utilisation of EU funds with no other changes in 
policies, the deficit is projected to decline in 2019 
to 0.
2% of GDP. 
The structural balance is projected to decline to 

1Â½% of GDP in 2017. The improvement in the 
structural balance in the two following years will 

be less than that of the headline balance in light of 

the 
progressive widening of the 
positive output gap 
from 2018 onwards. The debt-
to-GDP ratio is 
projected to decline to 47% in 2019,
 driven by 
declining deficits and accelerating nominal GDP 

growth. 
26. FINLAND 
Strong growth as external demand picks up 
 124 Economic growth significantly above EU 
average Finlandâ¢s 2016 real GDP growth was officially 
revised upwards in July, from 1.4% to 1.9%, 

driven by private consumption and investment. 

Economic growth accelerated at the beginning of 

this year thanks to an upswing in exports and 

sustained growth in investment. Real GDP growth 

is expected to climb to 3.3% in 2017 and remain 

above the EU average in 
both 2018 and 2019, at 
2.7% and 2.4% respectively. 
Private consumption growth is expected to remain 
strong in 2017, at 2.0%. Despite a modest increase 

in household disposable income, private 

consumption should continue to grow due to high 

consumer confidence and improved employment 

prospects, leading to a historically low saving rate. 

In 2018 and 2019, private consumption is set to 

increase by 1.8% and 1.6% respectively, as both 

employment growth and income growth moderate. 
The upswing in investment that began in 2016 is 
expected to continue with investment expected to 

expand by about 7% in 2017, supported by 

favourable financing conditions and above-average 

business confidence. Overall, construction is also  

forecast to grow 7%, due to both new housing  and 

non-residential construction. In 2018 and 2019, 

investment growth is expected to ease, as major 

projects are completed. 
Finlandâ¢s foreign trade has recently picked up and 
exports have experienced 
strong growth since the 
beginning of the year across all major product 

categories. This was mainly due to the rebound in 

key exports markets, especially the euro area, 

Sweden and the USA, as well as the return to 

growth in Russia. Other factors include the 

improvement in cost competitiveness and the 

expansion in the production capacity of some 

traditional export sectors 
such as forestry and 
shipbuilding, as well as a sizeable expansion in 

motor vehicle production.  
Export prospects are project
ed to be favourable in 
2018 and 2019, with exp
ectations and sentiment 
indicators at exceptionally high levels and 

expanding industrial orders. Import growth is 

expected to pick up again in 2017 and beyond, but 

at a slower pace than exports. As a result, net 

exports are set to have a positive effect on GDP 

growth over the forecast horizon. The current 

account deficit is also exp
ected to fall gradually in 
2017 and 2018 and should turn to a surplus of 

0.4% of GDP in 2019.

Moderate inflation and slow decrease in 
unemployment Inflation is set to remain moderate in a context of 
higher price competition in the retail market and 

modest increases in housing expenses and fuel 

prices. As a result, headline inflation is forecast to 

be around 1% by the end end of the year and 1.3% 

in 2018.  
Wage growth was almost flat in 2017 following 
the implementation of the âCompetitiveness Pactâ¢. 

Possible increases in 2018 and 2019 will depend 

on the upcoming sector-level wage agreements. 

Wages are forecast to grow moderately, leading to 

a slight increase in the purchasing power of 

households. 
Finlandâ¢s GDP is expected to grow at a strong pace of 3.3% in 2017, faster than the EU and euro area 

on average, supported by a strong increase in investment, robust private consumption and net exports. 

The economyâ¢s growth prospects contribute to an improved outlook for public finances. The general 

government balance Å still in deficit Å is moving towards equilibrium, while the debt-to-GDP ratio is 

projected to decline. The structural 
balance, however, is set to worsen. 
Member States, Finland 
  125 Employment growth is set to continue, supported 
by rising investment and export growth. The 

unemployment rate is expected to decline, 

although less than headline GDP growth figures 

may suggest, as labour supply is increasing in 

parallel and the labour market is suffering from 

skills mismatches. 
Risks to the forecast are broadly balanced. On the 
upside, the Finnish economy could benefit from a 

higher-than-expected increase in world trade and 

stronger-than-anticipated re
coveries in the euro 
area and Russia. Downside risks mainly pertain to 

higher-than-expected wage increases and the 

possibility that the euro could continue to 

appreciate, which would weaken price 

competitiveness and thereby export growth. 
Public finances The government has consolidated public finances 

mainly through expenditure cuts. The cuts in the 

taxation of personal income in 2016 and 2017 have 

mitigated the impact of the measures on the  
expenditure side, but all in all, consolidation 

measures have improved the general government 

balance. Expanding employment and higher 

economic activity are set to improve public 

finances further towards the end of the forecast 

period. In 2017, the general government deficit is 

projected to improve du
e to slow expenditure 
growth owing to the measures in the 

âCompetitiveness Pactâ¢ and a rapid increase in 

corporate income tax revenue. In 2018, under a no-

policy change assumption, the headline deficit is 

expected to improve only marginally, since the 

previous yearâ¢s temporary factors are expected to 

fade. In 2019, the deficit reduction is projected to 

accelerate again, as consolidation continues.  
The general government debt-to-GDP ratio peaked 
in 2015 and is expected to continue to decline 

between 2017 and 2019 due to a lower general 

government deficit and robust GDP growth. 
Finlandâ¢s structural balance is estimated at close 
to -Â½% of GDP in 2016 an
d is expected to worsen 
over the forecast horizon.

  27. SWEDEN A thriving economy 
 126 Solid growth set to continue After strong real GDP growth of 3.3% in 2016, 
Swedenâ¢s economy is expected to continue 

growing at a similar pace in 2017. Domestic 

demand, particularly investment from the buoyant 

construction sector, has been the main growth 

engine. While investment is set to subside in the 

coming years, the strengthening of global activity 

should benefit Swedenâ¢s small, open and 

competitive economy. Real GDP growth is 

projected to edge down to 2.7% in 2018 before 

easing further to 2.2% in 2019, closer to the 

economyâ¢s potential rate. 
 Robust domestic demand  The growth in government consumption is 

projected to slow to 0.6% in 2017, as both inflows 

of migrants and refugee-related spending diminish. 

The 2018 budget bill proposes additional funding 

for municipalities that is 
expected to be used for 
hiring staff, public sector pay rises, and 

improvements in hea
lth, long-term care and 
education. General government consumption is 

therefore set to expand by 1.3% in 2018 and 0.7% 

in 2019. 
Despite moderate wage growth, the increase in 
employment, low interest rates and additional 
social transfers and tax cuts in 2018 are expected 

to support disposable income. While core inflation 

is set on an upward trend, private consumption is 

forecast to grow at a r
easonable pace of 2.5%  
in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019.  
Investment growth has been driven by the upswing 
in residential investment since 2013. This support 

has significantly gathered
 pace in 2017 and is 
expected to carry over into 2018. In addition, 

equipment investment is set to continue growing, 

as capacity utilisation is high. Overall, investment 

is expected to grow faster than GDP, at 7.6%  

in 2017, cooling down to 3.8% in 2018 and 2.8% 

in 2019.  
A rosy export outlook Exports boosted growth in 2017-Q2, in particular 

intermediate and investment goods, benefiting 

from the improvement in the global economy. 

Imports are set to increase at a slower pace over 

the forecast horizon due to slowing domestic 

demand growth. Thus, net exports are expected to 

contribute positively to GDP growth between 2017 

and 2019 and the current 
account surplus relative 
to GDP is forecast to edge up to 5.1%. 
Significant labour market improvements Favourable economic conditions boosted the 

employment rate to 81.2% in 2016, the highest rate 

in the EU. This development is expected to 

gradually help those who are inactive or in a 

weaker position to enter the labour market. Acute 

shortages of skilled labour are likely to prevent the 

unemployment rate from declining faster. The 

unemployment rate is projected to fall further from 

6.9% in 2016 to 6.3% in 2019.  
Inflation to remain broadly stable   As a result of globalisati
on and an intensification 
of e-commerce, Swedish prices and wages have 

seen only muted growth over the last few years, 

helping to support the countryâ¢s competitiveness. 
Economic growth in Sweden is expected to remain st
rong this year and next, fuelled by construction 

investment and exports, before moderating in 2019. In view of the increased economic activity, 

unemployment is forecast to decline further before stabilising. Inflation is expected to remain just below 

2% over the forecast horizon. While the 2018 budget bill includes SEK 40 billion of new measures, 

public finances are projected to remain strong. 
Member States, Sweden 
  127 Inflation has finally picked up following a surge in 
services prices that began in April. However, while 

positive wage drift is likely to become more 

widespread across many sectors in 2018 and 2019, 

the labour market entry of
 lower-skilled labour and 
young people is likely to taper total wage growth. 

Headline inflation is set to slow to 1.6% in 2018 

due to the appreciation of the Swedish krona and a 

declining contribution from energy prices, before 

slightly rebounding to 1.7% in 2019. With high 

capacity utilisation rates and a tight labour market, 

core inflation is projected 
to reach 1.9% by the end 
of 2019, overshooting headline inflation. 
Balanced risks On the positive side, the economy could benefit in 

the medium term from a successful integration of 

migrants into the labour 
market. On the downside, 
any correction to Swedenâ¢s house prices could 

dampen business confidence, household 

consumption and construction investment. A 

sharper appreciation of the Swedish krona could 

also squeeze the profit margins of exporters and 

dampen inflation. 
Budget surplus despite fiscal reforms Swedenâ¢s general government balance is expected 

to record a surplus of 0.9% of GDP in 2017, 

slightly down from 1.1% in 2016. Both revenue 

and expenditure are forecast
 to grow in line with 
GDP, keeping the balance broadly unchanged. The 

governmentâ¢s 2018 budget bill includes SEK 40 

billion of discretionary measures that are chiefly 

aimed in support of the welfare and health care 

system, as well as strengthening police, defence 

and environmental protection. Since these 

measures are forecast to be only partially financed 

by additional revenue growth from the robust 

economy, it is expected that net lending will 

decline to 0.7% of GDP in 2018. For 2019,  

under a no-policy-change assumption, the surplus 

is set to fall to 0.6% of GDP. The structural  

surplus is projected to decline to Â¾% of GDP in 

2017 and to remain roughly at that level in the 

following years. Swedenâ¢s gross debt has been on 

a declining trend over the last few years, a trend 

that is set to continue with the debt-to-GDP  

ratio projected to fall from 42.2% in 2016  

to 34.4% in 2019.

28. THE UNITED KINGDOM 
Slowdown in growth expected to continue 
 128 Growth has slowed markedly in 2017 Annual GDP growth moderated from 2.3% in 2015 
to 1.8% in 2016, despite initial resilience following 

the 23 June 2016 vote to leave the EU. The pace of 

growth has slowed further since the start of this 

year, from 0.6% in 2016-Q4 to 0.3% in both 

2017-Q1 and 2017-Q2. This moderation has been 

driven primarily by a decline in private 

consumption growth, which fell to 0.2% in 

2017-Q2, mainly due to
 the squeeze on real 
disposable incomes as nominal wage growth fell 

below consumer price inflation. Consumer prices 

have risen sharply in 2017 following the 2016 

depreciation of sterling. 
Following negative growth of 0.4% in 2016, 
business investment remains relatively subdued. In 

2017-H2, it grew by just 0.9% compared to 

2016-H2. Surveys suggest that heightened 

uncertainly is weighing on business investment.  
Supported by the earlier depreciation of sterling, 
net exports contributed 0.3 pps. to year-on-year 

growth in 2017-H1. Surveys of export order books 

and official data sugges
t that net trade should 
continue to make a modest contribution in 

2017-H2. Despite the expected support from net 

exports, however, other survey and outturn data 

suggest a continuation of modest growth in 

2017-H2. Consequently, annual GDP growth is 

projected to fall to 1.5% in 2017. 
Growth set to slow further in 2018 and 2019 Private consumption growth is expected to remain 

subdued in 2018 as modest growth in nominal 

wages continues to be outpaced by elevated 

consumer price inflation. 
Nonetheless, households 
are expected to continue to smooth consumption 

by further reducing savings. The household 

savings rate is projected to fall to 4.8% in 2017 

and to reach a low 
of 4.2% in 2018. 
Investment growth is forecast to weaken in 2018, 

as many firms are likely to continue deferring 
investments in the face of
 uncertainty. Net exports 
are forecast to make a smaller contribution to 

growth, as the growth in export markets will be 

partially offset by the waning boost from sterlingâ¢s 

past depreciation. A reduced contribution from net 

exports and slower domestic demand means that 

GDP growth in 2018 is expected to ease to 1.3%. 
 Given the ongoing negotiation on the terms of the 

UK withdrawal from the EU, projections for 2019 

are based on a purely technical assumption of 

status quo in terms of trading relations between the 

EU27 and the UK. This is for forecasting purposes 

only and has no bearing on the talks underway in 

the context of the Article 50 process. Under this 

assumption, GDP growth is still expected to 

remain subdued at 1.1%. Lower consumer price 

inflation in 2019 is exp
ected to support private 
consumption but this may be partially offset by a 

marginal increase in the household savings rate. 

Business investment is projected to remain 

subdued following a period of heightened 

uncertainty, while net export growth is forecast to 

moderate marginally, in line with export markets. 
Continued labour market resilience while 
inflation remains elevated  Employment is expected to continue growing, 
though more slowly than
 in recent years, as 
productivity growth remains subdued.

Economic growth in the UK has been slowing since the start of the year, as higher consumer prices 
constrained private consumption growth. Based on a purely technical assumption of status quo in terms 

of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK, growth is still expected to remain subdued over the 

forecast horizon. Consumption growth is projected to be modest, in line with weak real wage growth, 

while uncertainty continues to weigh on business 
investment. However, net 
exports are expected to 
provide some support to growth, and the labour market is projected to show continued resilience. 
Member States, The United Kingdom 
  129 Unemployment is projected to remain low despite 
the moderation in GDP growth. The 

unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually 

from 4.5% in 2017 to 4.7% in 2018 and to 4.8% in 

2019. After peaking at 2.7% in 2017, inflation is 

expected to remain elevated in 2018 at 2.6%. 

Inflation is projected to ease to 2.1% in 2019, still 

marginally above the Bank of Englandâ¢s inflation 

target of 2%. 
General government deficit to rise in 2017-2018 Following several years of improvement, the UKâ¢s 

general government deficit is expected to rise to 

2.5% of GDP in the 2017-2018 fiscal year. The 

deficit fell from 4.0% of GDP in 2015-2016 to 

2.3% of GDP in 2016-2017. The fall in 2016-2017 

was partly due to a temporary boost to revenues 

arising from a number of factors. The most 

significant was an increase in income tax revenues 

in the final quarter of the fiscal year due to changes 

in taxation for self-assessed (non-wage) incomes. 

This boost to tax receipts will not be repeated in 

the final quarter of the 2017-2018 fiscal year, 

contributing to a slight increase in the deficit. 

Interest payments are also expected to rise in 

2017-2018, following a similar increase in 

2016-2017, primarily due to higher interest 
payments on inflation-linked bonds. In line with 

the increase in the general government deficit, the 

structural deficit is expected to rise to 2.9% of 

GDP in 2017-2018, from 2.7% of GDP in 

2016-2017. 
The general government deficit is expected to 
resume a declining trend over the remainder of the 

forecast horizon, falling to
 1.8% of GDP in 2018-
2019 and 1.3% of GDP in 2019-2020. In line with 

measures announced by the UK authorities, fiscal 

consolidation during this period is largely expected 

to be expenditure based, although the revenue-to-

GDP ratio is also expected to increase slightly. The 
structural deficit is expected to fall to 2.0% of 

GDP in 2018-2019 and 1Â½% of GDP 2019-2020. 

Risks to the forecast poin
t to upward pressure on 
the general government deficit, particularly in case 

of a Brexit-related trade 
shock during the forecast 
period. The government debt ratio is projected to 

fall to 82.9% of GDP in 2019-2020, after peaking 

at 86.8% of GDP in 2016-2017.

 Candidate Countries   29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV
 REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA Recovery ahead as investor confidence returns 
 132 Economy takes a hit from political crisis as 
investment drops sharply  The prolonged political crisis took a toll on the 
economy in the first half of this year. Real GDP 

contracted (-0.9% y-o-y), 
as investment declined 
steeply (-8.6% y-o-y). Consumers seemed less 

affected by the situation: household consumption 

increased by 3.4% y-o-y, supported by robust job 

creation and continued solid, although 

decelerating, growth in real net wages. Net exports 
made a positive contribution to GDP growth, with 

imports rising at a markedly slower pace in the 

second quarter, mainly reflecting the downturn in 

investment-related imports of capital goods. 

Private credit growth picked up in the first half of 

the year and beyond, almo
st entirely accounted for 
by household loans.  
Annual consumer price inflation accelerated in the 
first half of the year, after three consecutive years 
of deflation, as recent in
creases in the prices of 
food and fuels spilled over into other sectors, in 
particular transport, co
mmunication, hotels and 
restaurants.  
 Output recovery expected in 2018 and 2019 as 
investor sentiment rebounds The economy is expected
 to recover over the 
forecast horizon, as investor
 sentiment is likely to 
improve with the breakthrough in the countryâ¢s 
political stalemate. GDP growth is projected to be 

driven increasingly by domestic demand. 

Household spending should benefit from further 

expected employment gains, bolstered by 

additional public funding for labour market 

measures. Disposable income is set to benefit from 

the rise in minimum wages, subsidised by the 

government, and by the increase in transfer 

payments, both effective since September 2017. 

Real net wages are expected to continue to 

increase at a slower pace, as consumer price 

inflation is picking up, driven by developments in 

core inflation.  
With private investors regaining confidence, and 
obstacles to public investment due to the transition 

to the new government, gross fixed capital 

formation is likely to contribute to GDP growth 

again in 2018 and 2019. Some signs in the third 

quarter point to renewed momentum in private 

investment, imports of capital goods strengthened, 

and corporate credit, which had been declining, in 

annual terms, for 12 consecutive months has been 

posting (moderate) gains since July. Expanding 

production capacities of export-oriented foreign 

companies are likely to support a positive 

contribution from net exports to GDP growth at 

least in 2018, even though investment-related 

import growth is picking up with the economic 

recovery. Although the government is embarking 

on an important fiscal stimulus over the next years, 

the contribution of government consumption to 

growth is expected to drop, as public expenditure 

is likely to be rebalanced towards transfer 

payments at the expense of goods and services and 

remuneration. Economic growth may turn out less 

favourably in case the domestic political situation, 

which remains fragile, would worsen again, but 

this risk is less pronounced than in spring.  
Fiscal policy set for new stimulus  Public finances stayed on course in the year to 

August, notwithstanding

The economy contracted in the first half of the year, as political uncertainties lingered and investment 
declined sharply. With a new government in offi
ce since June, that seems committed to implementing 
fiscal and structural reforms and to providing support to domestic demand and employment, positive 

investor sentiment should return. Risks to fiscal sustainability may arise if the government increases 

corporate and wage subsidies as planned, without implementing durable consolidation measures. 
Candidate Countries, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
  133 were up by 4.6% y-o-y, driven by personal income 
(+8.9%) and profit taxes (+15%), while VAT 

receipts rose only marginally. In July, the new 

government rebalanced the 2017 budget. It 

lowered revenue projections for this year by 1.5%, 

compared to the original budget, and for 

expenditure by 1.4%. Transfer payments were 

increased, while expenditure for capital investment 

and public consumption was streamlined and cut. 

In the first eight months of the year, the deficit 

amounted to 1.7% of projected full-year GDP. The 

government may be on track to attain or even to 

remain below the deficit target of 2.9% this year, 

yet at the expense of an important under-execution 

of growth-enhancing capital spending.  
Looking ahead, the government plans a sizeable 
boost to the economy in the medium-term, 

including the continuation of wage subsidies, new 

corporate tax incentives
, further expansion of 
active labour market measures and of social 

transfers. At the same time, the government seems 

committed to fiscal consolidation, although at a 

more moderate pace than pr
eviously planned. In its 
recently adopted Public Finance Strategy, it also 

projects the implementation of binding limits for 

the general government deficit and for public debt 

by 2019. However, it has not (yet) proposed 
durable spending cuts or revenue measures to 

underpin these plans. The deficit might therefore 

widen somewhat over the forecast horizon, given 

the projected moderate speed of economic 

recovery. The government also intends to clear 

significant public sector arrears over the forecast 

horizon, after having embarked on compiling and 

publishing information on these unpaid liabilities 

over the summer. With financing costs expected to 

remain benign, the projected, modest rise in 

general government debt this year and next would 

be driven by developments in the primary balance.

30. MONTENEGRO Rebalancing growth drivers 
 134 Higher than expected growth in 2017 In the first half of 2017, real GDP growth 
accelerated to 4.2% (y-o-y) and was largely driven 
by private consumption fuelled by rising 

employment and strong lending to households. 

Despite the adoption of some consolidation 

measures, public consumption growth further 

increased. The pace of gross fixed capital 

formation slowed down co
nsiderably early this 
year after completion of the construction of a wind 

power plant and several hotels. The revival of 

exports, fuelled by the good performance of 

tourism and sales of mineral ores, helped reduce 

the drag from net exports. 
The role of investment as the major driver of 
growth is being gradually overtaken by private 

consumption. This trend is expected to continue 

over the forecast period, even if a temporary 

setback of private consumption could be expected 

in 2018 due to the plan
ned increase of the VAT 
rate. 
Reduction of external imbalances likely The current account deficit 
narrowed to 17.5% of 
GDP in the four quarters to June, compared to 

19.6% in the four quarters to March. A sharp  
deceleration of merchandise imports, largely due 

lower imports of construction equipment, helped 

reducing the trade gap. This has been accompanied 

by improvements in the ba
lance of services owing 

to the good performance of tourism and the 

growing surpluses in the primary and secondary 

income balances. Start of production of a wind 

power plant and a new tobacco factory planned in 

November 2017, followed Å later on Å by the 

completion of the interconnection electricity cable 

with Italy, and the opening of some new hotels, are 

expected to turn the contribution to growth from 

net exports into positive territory in the next two 

years and to further reduce external imbalances. 
Slight improvement in labour market conditions Strong economic activity led to further 

improvements in the labour market. According to 

the Labour Force Survey (LFS), the 
unemployment rate declined in the second quarter 

of 2017 to 15.3%, down from 17.7% a year before. 

However, given the strong seasonal pattern of the 

Montenegrin labour market, unemployment is 

expected to increase agai
n by the end of the year. In 2018 and 2019 a further reduction of the 

unemployment rate is expected, albeit at  

a lower rate, as investments are being gradually 

completed. 
Fluctuating prices Inflation further accelerat
ed in the first eight 
months of 2017, averaging 2.7% y-o-y, mainly due 

to rising fuel prices. Moreover, the introduction in 

June of higher excises on alcohol and tobacco, 

together with strong demand from tourism, are 

contributing to rising prices in restaurants and 

cafes as well as accommodation services. The 

planned introduction of a higher VAT rate and 

excises in 2018 would add to inflationary 

pressures, but this one-off 
year-on-year price effect 
will peter out after one year. Yet, overall inflation 

might remain around 2% in 2019, supported by 

some further acceleration 
in private consumption.

Montenegro -GDP growth and contributions
Strong growth driven by large infrastructure investments is gradually being taken over by private 
consumption. The introduction in mid-2017 of a comprehensive fiscal consolidation strategy is expected 

to improve the fiscal position over time, but would also weight on growth, particularly in 2018. 

Moreover, until the expected completion of the highway works in mid-2019, the public debt and budget 

are set to remain under significant pressure. 
Candidate Countries, Montenegro 
  135 Credit to corporates remains subdued Credit growth remains strong thanks to household 
and general government borrowing, amidst weak 

lending to the corporate sector. It is expected that 

the increase in lending activity, supported by the 

Central Bankâ¢s ongoing programme for reducing 

commercial banksâ¢ non-performing loans, would 

help ease lending conditions 
to corporates as the 
sector keeps deleveraging gradually. 
Meanwhile, the financial crisis legacy of high level 
of indebtedness and liquidity constraints continues 

constraining the corporate sector, and represents a 

major risk for the economy, resulting in a large 

number of firms with their bank accounts frozen 

due to contract enforcemen
t claims. A decline or a 
slowdown in the number of tourists represents 

another important risk for the main export industry 

of the country. 
The fiscal position is expected to strengthen 
once the highway works are completed The strong acceleration of economic activ
ity in the first half of 2017 was reflected in growing general 
government revenue, with stronger demand 

fuelling VAT and excise receipts as well as 
corporate income tax and social security 

contributions. On the expenditure side, the 

intensified highway works boosted capital 

spending, although actual expenditure still 

remained below the budget target. Overall, the 

consolidated general gov
ernment deficit reached 2.6% of full-year GDP in June (compared to the 

deficit target of 4.1% forecast in the plan) due to 

capital and social security underspending, and a 

marginal surplus in the local government budget. 

Also in June, the stock of public debt declined to 

61.8% of GDP, down from 64.4% at the end of 

2016. However, both the budget deficit and public 

debt are expected to increase substantially by the 

end of 2017, once the total costs of the highway 

works will have fully materialised. The fiscal 

strategy adopted in June projects a 2 pps. increase 

of the normal VAT rate to 21% in January 2018, as 

well as further increase of excises, and  

the freezing of public sector wages. These 

measures are expected to 
contribute reinforcing the 
budget by additional 2 pps. of GDP annually  

until 2019. 
The construction of the highway has been, so far, 
the key driver of fiscal deficits. The works are 
expected to be completed in mid-2019, easing the 

pressure on public finances.

31. SERBIA Consumption to sustain economic growth momentum 
 136 Supply shocks to trim economic growth in 2017 Following a tepid performance in the first quarter, 
real GDP growth disappointed again in the second 

quarter (1.3% y-o-y). Desp
ite robust increases in 
manufacturing and domestic trade, economic 

activity was impacted by declines in agriculture, 

which was negatively affected by adverse weather 

conditions, and construction. On the demand side, 

growth drivers remained largely unchanged in the 

first half of the year. Private consumption picked 

up moderately, supported by rising employment 

and wages. Investment activity was subdued, 

undermined by delays in government capital 

spending since the beginning of the year. Driven 

by robust external demand in the EU and previous 

FDIs in tradeable sectors,
 exports growth remained 
very strong. 
Underlying growth remains vibrant Despite a slowdown in the first half of the year, the 

underlying growth trend remains vibrant. This is 

corroborated by recent high frequency indicators. 

Industrial production recovered strongly in the 

summer, underpinned by lively manufacturing 

activity. Retail trade moved upward as well and 

merchandise export growth in euro terms remained 

steadily in the double digits. 
Going forward, private consumption is expected to 
increasingly sustain the growth momentum in the 

economy. It should be supported by continuous 

employment gains, higher fiscal transfers, robust 

consumer lending, and more pronounced wage 

increases in the private s
ector. Public consumption 

is likely to contribute positively to growth as fiscal 

constraints ease progressively. Private investment 

growth is set to accelerate from a low pace, 

benefitting from improved economic prospects and 

better financing conditions, while government 

investment is expected 
to receive a significant 
boost as part of the available fiscal space will be 

used to address large infrastructure needs. Buoyant 

exports growth is forecast to persist as ongoing 
FDIs in tradeables mature and the EUâ¢s recovery 

remains solid. However, net exportsâ¢ contribution 

to growth would be close to zero or negative over 

the forecast horizon as strong domestic demand 

drives imports up. Following a widening this year, 

the trade deficit is projected to remain broadly 

stable in the next two years. The current account 

deficit, however, is set to expand further over the 

forecast horizon due to higher investment income 

outflows. 
Price pressures to remain contained amidst 
elevated uncertainty Inflation has declined since it hit a high of 4% 
(y-o-y) this spring. It is projected to remain close 

to the central bank target
 of 3% as inflationary 
effects from higher demand and some international 

commodity prices are expect
ed to be dampened by 
limited administered pri
ce adjustments, a stable 
dinar exchange rate, and a neutral fiscal stance. 
The main risks to the economy remain largely 
unchanged. Despite reduction in domestic and 

external imbalances, it is still exposed to 

fluctuations in commodity prices and international 

capital flow reversals, i.a. linked to divergences in 

monetary policies of major central banks. As

Serbia -Real GDP growth and contributions
The 2017 growth forecast is revised downwards because of the impact of adverse weather conditions. 
The underlying growth trend, however, remains robu
st and economic activity is expected to pick up 
already before the end of the year. Private consumption, supported by rising income and employment 

levels, is seen as a key driver of growth, while expor
ts are projected to remain strong. Price pressures 
are forecast to be contained and balanced or in surplus budgets should drive the government debt ratio 

further down. Candidate Countries, Serbia 
  137 proper policy mix, in particular preserving a 
prudent fiscal policy, is a key risk for the 

envisaged forecast profile. The expiration of an 

IMF-led programme early next year could also test 

domestic authoritiesâ¢ willingness and capacity to 

continue pursuing difficult structural reforms. 
Good budget performance and mounting 
spending pressures likely to test government 
resolve to control current spending The budget execution in 2017 is set to outperform 
again by far both initial and revised targets. The 
general government budget is forecast to turn to a 

surplus of just under 1% of GDP against a revised 

deficit target of 1.1% of GDP. This good 

performance has partially been driven by 

improvements in revenue collection and unplanned 

one-off receipts. In add
ition, on the expenditure 
side, current spending remained largely under 

control and there was a significant under execution 

of capital expenditure by the end of August. 
The general government budge
t is forecast to be in balance or in surplus in the next two years. 

Correspondingly, government debt, excluding 

possible restitution-related debt, is set to decline 

steadily and approach 60% 
of GDP by the end of 
the forecast horizon. The go
od fiscal prospects and 
mounting spending pressures, however, would 

likely test government resolve to continue 

maintaining strict control over current spending. 

The lack of a functioning system of fiscal rules and 
a fiscal anchor also add 
to the uncertainty about 
future fiscal policy. At th
e same time, fiscal risks 
are not negligible as gain
s in revenue collection are 
not sufficiently institutionalised, while key fiscally 

important structural reforms remain unfinished.

32. TURKEY A risky path to sustainable growth  138 Positive growth surprises in the first half of 2017 Economic growth in Turkey was surprisingly 
strong in the first half of 2017, accelerating to 

5.3% (y-o-y) from 3.2% in 2016, supported by 

stronger exports, a sign
ificantly depreciated Turkish Lira in comparison with last year and a 

strong boost from public finances and other policy 

incentives, intended to re
store confidence in the 
Turkish economy. Construction volume was 

estimated to have grown by 25% (y-o-y) in the 

second quarter after an al
ready solid 14% in the 
first quarter. The loosening of macro-prudential 

measures and government-sponsored bank lending 

to corporates provided a further stimulus to the 

domestic economy as visible in the renewed surge 

in corporate and consumer loans.

 Monetary policy complicated by high money growth The output gap has been closing quickly recently 
and capacity utilisation is at a historic high while 

inflation expectations are increasingly unanchored, 

feeding the high inflation 
rate that also suffers 
from base effects and end-of-this-year reversal of 

VAT reductions by the government. Low real 

interest rates in turn stimulate domestic demand 

that, in a context of a global search for yield, is 
partly financed through capital inflows from 
abroad. This is in particular visible in the parallel 

run-up of foreign liabilities by banks and an 

increasing loan-to-deposit ratio. While the Turkish 

central bank pursues a tight policy stance, 

ï¬monetarist conditionsï¬ are still loose with M3 

growth averaging 18.4% (y
-o-y) in the first eight 
months of this year. Moreover, with M3 growth 

having outpaced nominal GDP growth by 55% 

since the depth of the economic and financial crisis 

in the first half 2009 there is a large legacy of 

loose monetary policy. Recent Lira depreciation 

will provide further inflatio
nary pressure. Inflation 
is therefore expected to remain above 7% and risks 

are to the upside. 
Broadening and more sustainable growth  The outlook for the business sector is currently 

highly positive, judging by the surveys for all 

sectors except the construction sector. After the 

surge in construction investment and high wage 

growth, a contained cooling down of construction 

activity is not a bad omen. Industrial production 

has expanded at an increasing rate since the 

beginning of this year and the expansion is 

broadening from foreign-demand exposed sectors 

to more domestically-oriented sectors. This 

broadening and strengthening of industrial 

production is expected to finally flow over into 

renewed investments in machinery and equipment, 

thus broadening and solidifying the growth base. 

The forecast therefore expects annual investment 

growth to accelerate to 4.1% over 2018-19. 
Growth of private consumption is expected to 
increase towards the end of this year and continue 
its expansion in 2018-19. Employment growth is 

picking up and consumers are expecting a further 

reduction in the unemployment rate. The 

broadening of growth to domestically-oriented 

industry and services sector will further support 

employment growth in the near term. Further 

consumption impetus comes from disposable 

income which registered solid growth in the past 
The Turkish economy registered strong growth recently, helped by foreign demand, construction activity 

and a range of government policies from expansionary fiscal policy to credit guarantees and loosening 

of macro-prudential regulations. Shifting to private consumption and investment in machineries and 

equipment, growth will move to a more sustainable base. Downside risks are sizable, however, and 

include past high loan growth, inflation infused by a legacy of monetary overhang, the uncertain 

business environment and high unemployment. 
Candidate Countries, Turkey 
  139 two years, although inflation has eroded the real 
value of the increase.  
A temporary break in expansionary policy 
impetus In the first half of the year a broad range of policy 
incentives reaching from 
expansionary fiscal 
policy via a large increase in government 

guarantees for corporate lending to a loosening of 

macro-prudential regulation were implemented. 

The draft budget for 2018
 forecasts a fiscal 
tightening which will lean heavily on raising tax 

revenues. The government is likely to succeed in 

reducing the deficit in 2018. Elections in 2019, 

however, are expected to reinvigorate policy 

makers' eagerness to stimulate economic growth. 

Implicit liabilities from
 recent policy initiatives (credit guarantees, macro-prudential relaxation) 

will not have abated fully by then, and financing 

conditions are unlikely to be as beneficial as 

currently. As a consequence, after hitting its target 

next year, the government is expected to run a 

larger deficit in 2019. 
Downside risks aplenty The implicit liabilities the government has built up 

this year are but one relatively minor risk to the 
outlook. A more important risk is household 

consumption not picking up as strongly as in this 

forecast. Consumer confidence is still at a 

relatively low level and the limited impact of 

government incentives has already partly faded. 

Additionally, the business environment still suffers 

from the state of emergency, unresolved seizures 

of companies and a lack of innovation and 

productivity growth. Corporate indebtedness has 

risen, also in foreign currency, making companies 

more vulnerable to changes in external financing 

conditions. In addition, high investments in 

construction in combination with high loan growth 

run the risk of having fuelled a real estate boom. A 

large part of the banks' increase in loans has been 

funded from abroad with longer maturity. Banks 

have passed on the exchange rate risks in part to 

Turkish companies by extending loans in foreign 

currency and part to foreign investors. The 

vulnerability to external conditions can also be 

seen from the current account that continues to be 

in negative territory and is expected to be even 

more so in the coming two years as the pick-up in 

domestic demand by a shift to private consumption 

and investment in machinery and equipment 

increases imports.

  33. ALBANIA 
Growth set to be increasingly driven by private consumption 
 140 Growth strengthened in the first half of 2017 Real output accelerated to 
a growth rate of 4.0% 
(y-o-y) in the first half of 2017. The main 
contributors to growth were investment and 

exports. Gross fixed capital formation strengthened 

to 12.9% (y-o-y) growth, reflecting the peak period 

of foreign direct investment in the Albanian 

section of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) and a 

large hydropower project. Exports surged 15% 

based on expanding tourism and a recovery in 

goods exports following thre
e years of contraction. 
Imports (which exceed exports by almost 50%) 

grew more moderately at a rate of 5.8%. Public 

consumption growth was buoyant (6.6%), 

particularly in the areas of wages, social insurance, 

and local budgets. Private consumption growth, on 

the other hand, was relatively subdued (2.1%), 

possibly reflecting the political uncertainty in the 

run-up to the general elections in June.  
Monetary policy continues to be supportive Domestic demand is expected to continue 

benefitting from an accommodative monetary 

policy. The Bank of Albania has kept its policy 

interest rate unchanged at
 the record low of 1.25% 
since May 2016. A weather-related spike in food 

prices last winter will increase the annual inflation 

rate in 2017, but core inflation has remained below 

1%. In this context, the central bank considers that 

the intensity of the monetary stimulus is unlikely 

to be reduced before the second quarter of 2018 

despite above-potential growth.  
With low financing costs and an easing of credit 
standards for the household sector, lending growth 

has picked up in conjunction with the 

strengthening of the economy. Adjusted for 

exchange rate changes, lending to the overall 

private sector increased 4% y-o-y in the second 

quarter of 2017. Even lending to the business 

sector has eased up somewhat as the overhang of 

non-performing loans (NPLs) on bank balance 

sheets has declined over th
e past twelve months.  
Domestic demand is driving growth Consumer confidence is improving, employment is 

rising at a decent pace, and overall wages have 

received a boost from a 10% wage hike in a large 

part of the public sector in March. This is projected 

to push private consumption growth to 3% over the 

next two years compared to a relatively subdued 

growth rate in 2017. Gross fixed capital formation, 

to the contrary, is likely 
to decelerate substantially next year as the two larg
e energy projects approach 
their completion. Investments in tourism facilities 

and in the extraction sector are, however, expected 

to keep overall investment growth at a relatively 

high level. Public consumption growth is projected 

to moderate over the next two years following a 

spike in 2017. 
Export growth expected to remain strong A strong performance of services export, 

particularly tourism, resulted in a positive 

contribution of net exports to GDP growth in 2016. 

Over the forecast horizon, overall export growth is 

expected to remain significantly above the growth 

rate of Albaniaâ¢s export markets, but somewhat 

below last yearâ¢s performance. The recent real 

appreciation of the Albanian currency has weighed 

on price competitiveness, but higher commodity

Albania -Real GDP growth and contributions
Foreign direct investments in the energy sector are at a peak, resulting in an acceleration of economic 
activity in the current year. Exports continue growin
g at a fast pace, benefitting from expanding tourism 
and the strengthening economies of key trading pa
rtners. Growing employment and higher wages 
bolster household spending. Investment and consumption are supported by an accommodative monetary 

policy. Inflation is low, but projected to rise gradually towards the official target. The fiscal policy 

stance is only slowly reducing the high l
evel of public debt as a share of GDP.  
Candidate Countries, Albania 
  141 prices are expected to boost the extractive industry 
and its exports. At the sa
me time, robust domestic 
demand is supporting imports, resulting in close-

to-zero overall contribution of net exports to 

growth. Following data revisions, the current 

account deficit for 2016 has been lowered to 7.6% 

of GDP. The deficit is projected to widen to 

around 8% in the forecast horizon.  
Solid GDP growth and lower unemployment GDP growth is projected to
 reach 4% in 2017, but 
to decline to 3.8% next year as investment activity 

decelerates. In 2019, the 
rising contribution from 
private consumption is projected to lift GDP 

growth to 4.2%. The balance of risks to the growth 

outlook has moved from being tilted to the 

downside to the upside as political uncertainty has 

declined and the transmission of an 

accommodative monetary policy to lending growth 

seems to have gained traction.  
Employment is forecast to increase by almost 4%, 
down from extraordinarily high growth rates in the 

past two years. Together with a continued trend 

toward higher labour force participation, this 

results in a slow but steady decline of the 

unemployment rate from 15.6% in 2016 to 13.0% 
by 2019. Although inflationary pressures are still 

difficult to discern, a declining output gap is 

expected to increase consumer price inflation 

gradually. The central bankâ¢s 3% inflation target 

is, not expected to be r
eached within the forecast 
horizon. 
Moderate fiscal deficits will allow the public 
debt ratio to decline, but only slowly The fiscal deficit in 2016 amounted to 1.8% of 
GDP which was significantly smaller than planned 

due to lower-than-budgeted expenditures. It is 

estimated that the fiscal deficit will be slightly 

higher in the following two years on the basis of 

the governmentâ¢s current fiscal strategy. Together 

with the projections for nominal GDP, it implies 

that the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall 

gradually from 72.4% at the end of 2016 to 66% at 

the end of 2019. 
Following the general elections in June, a new 
government based on a cl
ear electoral mandate has 
taken office. This has lowered the political risks 

associated with the fis
cal projection. However, 

risks persist due to weaknesses in public finance 

management which pose a challenge for the 

execution of public budg
ets according to plan.

Solid near-term momentum as 
cycle continues to mature 
 144 Current dynamics point to solid momentum The US outlook remains benign, with growth 
rebounding to 0.8% (q-o-q) in 2017-Q2 and high-

frequency indicators pointing to sustained 

expansion in the near term. The economyâ¢s 

momentum has been underpinned by labour 

market strength, comprising robust employment 

growth and further falls in the unemployment rate, 

while mildly rising energy prices and elevated 

sentiment have facilitated the ongoing rebound in 

business investment. Although growth is set to 

moderate in the near term (Q3) following recent 

hurricanes in economically important regions, it is 

expected to be offset by reconstruction activity.  
The economy is expected
 to sustain its solid 
underlying performance into 2018 and 2019. 
Further tightening in the labour market is set to 

gradually amplify wage growth and underpin 

private consumption, while business investment is 

expected to be supported by rising demand (both 

domestic and global). A major expansionary shift 

in the US fiscal stance is
 no longer anticipated at this stage. Taking all of these factors together, US 

GDP is expected to grow by 2Â¼% throughout the 

forecast horizon, even as the cycle matures. 
Labour market to sustain current strength Employment growth has been solid throughout 

2017, resulting in further falls in the 

unemployment rate to new cycle lows (4.2% in 

September), even as the participation rate also 

climbed higher. As the economy has likely reached 

full employment already, employment growth is 

forecast to slow somewh
at in 2018 and 2019. 
However, given current tight conditions in the 

labour market, this moderation is set to be 

accompanied by rising wage 
growth from currently 
subdued levels to around 4% by the end of the 

forecast horizon, adding 
to already-elevated 
consumer sentiment and providing a solid 

foundation for growth in household consumption. 

Productivity is expected to gradually pick up over 

the horizon, providing a further boost to wage 

growth. 
Fiscal stimulus expectations scaled down 
further In line with market expectations, assumptions 
regarding future fiscal stimulus have been scaled 

back considerably comp
ared with previous 
forecasts. Planned tax cuts and ongoing 

negotiations in Congress over the 2018 budget 

could still imply a slight loosening of the fiscal 

stance in the near term (2018 and 2019). However, 
the growth impulse provided by fiscal policy is 

expected to be limited given the current stage of 

the cycle. Hence, the downscaling of fiscal 

stimulus assumptions does not translate into any 

major downgrade of the growth outlook, but 

rather, implies a more gradual path of monetary 

policy normalisation. 
Financing conditions to remain accommodative and to tighten only gradually Despite the decline in underlying inflation 
pressures so far in the course of 2017 the Federal 

Reserve has continued to gradually raise interest 

rates - by a cumulative 50 basis points since 

January. Going forward, inflation is expected to 

pick up steadily in line with stronger wage growth 

and a positive output gap, triggering further 

tightening of monetary policy over the near and 

medium term. Added to this, the commencement 

of balance sheet unwinding from October 2017 

also implies a gradual move towards monetary

The US economic outlook is solid, underpinned by a strong labour market, an ongoing rebound in 
business investment and elevated sentiment. Amid 
a maturing economic cycle, the economyâ¢s current 
momentum is set to be sustained in the near term, with GDP growth forecast steady at 2Â¼%.  
Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America 
  145 policy normalisation. However, it is expected that 
both of these processes will proceed only gradually 

and without major negative spillovers to real 

economic activity, while risks of upward pressure 

on the US dollar are mitigated by improving 

economic activity elsewhere. 
Tax reform likely to widen the fiscal deficit Negotiations are currently underway in Congress 

on a corporate tax reform that would reduce 

statutory corporate tax rates and simplify the 

personal tax code. While concrete legislative 

proposals remain uncertain, our assumption is that 

the reform, in conjunction with the federal 

spending plan likely to be adopted, will act to 

widen both the general government deficit and the 

debt-to-GDP ratio (by an estimated 0.5pps of GDP 

by 2019 compared with the improvement implied 

by unchanged policies).  
Current account balance broadly unchanged Solid domestic demand, driven in particular by 

business investment, is expected to boost imports 

over the forecast horizon. However, less upward 

pressure on the USD than 
previously anticipated  
(largely owing to the assumption of considerably 

smaller fiscal expansion and pervasive policy 

uncertainties) and a steadily improving external 

environment are expected to moderate the 

deterioration in the US trade and current account 
balance. Overall, the curr
ent account deficit is now 
set to widen from around 2Â½ % of GDP in recent 

years to 3% of GDP by 2019. 
Risks remain pronounced Risks to the forecast are 
largely policy-related. A pronounced protectionist shift in US trade policy 

would place a significant dr
ag on both US and global growth, especially if matched by retaliatory 

measures elsewhere. Deadlines for raising the debt 

ceiling and approving the 2018 federal budget 

have been extended only temporarily, with 

renewed fiscal negotiations again trigger financial 

market volatility and weigh on sentiment. 

Moreover, high and steadily rising corporate 

leverage remains a source of concern given the 

outlook for progressively higher interest rates. 

Upside risks are related to a possible more 

expansionary shift in fiscal policy than currently 

assumed and further positive feedback effects from 

a strengthening global outlook.

35. JAPAN Temporary growth spurt driven by policy stimulus 
 146 Growth has firmed up in 2017 Compared to the Spring Fo
recast, growth has been 
revised substantially upward to 1.6% for 2017 on 
the back of robust domestic demand driven by 

increasingly tight labour market conditions. The 

pace of growth should grad
ually decelerate but still 
remain above potential at 1.2% in 2018 and 1.0% 

in 2019, reflecting waning fiscal stimulus, planned 

fiscal consolidation and subdued wage dynamics. 

Growth firmed up in the first half of 2017, with 

real GDP expanding by 0.3% (q-o-q) in the first 

and 0.6% (q-o-q) in the 
second quarter. Private 
consumption was the main growth driver, 

supported by continued employment creation. The 

positive contribution from gross fixed capital 

formation mainly stemmed from steady business 

investment and robust growth in public 

investment. Leading indicators point to the 

positive momentum continuing into the third 

quarter. Consumer confidence and business 

sentiment have been improving steadily, the new-

job-offers-to-applicant ratio hovers at a 44-year 

high, and private sector core machinery orders 

suggest continued vibrant domestic capital 

investment and overseas demand. Near-term 

growth should remain robust on the back of 

continued employment creation and favourable 

macroeconomic policies supporting stable growth 

in domestic demand. 
Gradual slowdown expected going forward Labour market conditions are set to remain very 

tight on the back of robust labour demand and 

steady decline in working age population, which 

should keep the unemployment rate below 3% 

over the forecast period. However, entrenched 

structural factors Å labour market duality, a 

fragmented and backward-looking wage-setting 

mechanism, low labour mobility Å will continue 

weighing on wage dynamics, and dampen private 

consumption growth in the next two years. The 

planned consumption tax hike in October 2019 

will entail acceleration of private consumption in 

the run-up, followed by contraction in the final 

quarter of the year.  
Gross fixed capital formation is expected to 

decelerate gradually as private and public 

investments diverge. On the one hand, business 

investment is set to remain resilient in the near 

term reflecting persistently loose financial 

conditions and sustained growth in private 

consumption and external demand. Residential 

investment should follow a similar pattern 

supported by favourable credit and labour market 

conditions. Volatility in private consumption 

induced by planned fiscal consolidation is likely to 

spill over to private investment dynamics towards 

the end of the forecast period. On the other hand, 

withdrawal of fiscal stimul
us is set to entail steady 
contraction in public investment from 2018-H2, 

which will weigh on growth in 2019. 
Steady global and regional growth should underpin 
exports, while resilient domestic demand will 

entail continued recovery in imports. Growth in 

import demand should accelerate in the run-up to 

the increase in the consumption tax rate, and turn 

negative in the immediate aftermath. Net exports 

are thus not expected to contribute to growth. 
The current account balance is set to remain in 
firmly positive territory and hover at around 4% of 

GDP. Firming global growth and favourable 

exchange rate effects should underpin primary 

income, which is expected to account for more 

than 3% of GDP, while the goods and services 

balance should remain stable
 at around 1% of GDP

Japan -Real GDP growth and contributions
Supportive macroeconomic policies and firming external demand are set to underpin economic activity 
over the very near term. Growth is expected to decel
erate over the forecast horizon on the back of 
withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, gradual resumption of fiscal consolidation and continued weakness in 

wage dynamics. 
Other non-EU Countries, Japan 
  147 amid continued recovery in export and import 
demand.  
Monetary policy to remain accommodative Loose monetary conditions are assumed to 

continue over the forecast horizon reflecting 

stubbornly low CPI inflation and the Bank of 

Japan's postponed timeframe to achieve the 2% 

target. Headline CPI inflation is expected to 

remain well below 2% in the absence of more 

sustained wage dynamics, and should pick up only 

gradually on the back of resilient economic growth 

and cost-push pressures stemming from currency 

dynamics driven by diverging monetary policies 

among advanced economies.  
Fiscal consolidation is bound to resume After several years of steady progress, fiscal 

consolidation stalled and reversed in 2016. The 

headline general government deficit is estimated to 

have widened from 3.5% to around 4.1% of GDP 

reflecting falling tax revenue growth on the back 

of currency appreciation, and stimulus-driven 

acceleration in expenditure
 growth. The fiscal 
stance is expected to remain slightly expansionary  
in 2017 with an increase in the general government 

deficit to around 4.3% reflecting sustained 

expenditure growth and gradual recovery in tax 

revenue driven by improved profitability and 

continued employment creation. Consolidation is 

expected to resume in 2018 and 2019 on the back 

of withdrawal of fiscal st
imulus and the increase in 
the consumption tax rate from 8% to 10% planned 

for October 2019. The fiscal outlook is subject, 

however, to a certain degree of uncertainty 

pending the 2018 fiscal policy review, which is 

expected to set a realistic medium-term fiscal 

target possibly backed by identifying expenditure 

and revenue priorities. 
Risks and uncertainty Policy uncertainty related to labour market and 

fiscal reform has increased
 in the run-up to the 

October general election. Risks have become more 

balanced amid an improved global outlook. On the 

domestic front, continued weakness in wage 

dynamics may entail slower-than-expected growth 

in private consumption, whilst on the external side 

geopolitical tensions may engender negative 

confidence effects and repe
rcussions on trade and investment dynamics.

36. CHINA Solid growth but key struct
ural challenges remain  148 Growth in 2017 stronger than anticipated China grew by 6.9 % (y-o-y) in the first two 
quarters of 2017, and by 6.8% in 2017-Q3. This 

compares to 6.7% growth for 2016. Growth for 

2017 is now expected to reach 6.8%, and forecast 

to fall to 6.5% in 2018 and 6.2% in 2019, as 

structural factors, includ
ing a falling labour supply 
and declining returns on investment weigh on 

potential growth. Risks remain broadly balanced in 

the short term, with the resilience of the property 

market and prospects for domestic private 

investment being important uncertainties. Rapid 

credit growth and rising corporate leverage remain 

key trends that cast a shadow over the medium 

term growth outlook. In 2017, the gap between 

credit growth and nominal GDP growth narrowed 

due to a sharp increase in the GDP deflator 

although it remains to be seen whether this 

reflation is a one-off adjustment.  
Property and trade underpin solid performance  The composition of growth in the  first three 

quarters of 2017 reflect a significant positive 

contribution from net exports, with the 

contribution to GDP moving from -0.5 pps. in 

2016 to 0.2 pps. in 2017 Q1-Q3. The contribution 

from consumption was 4.4 pps. (4.3 pps. in 2016) 

while investment contributed 2.3 pps. (2.8 pps. in 

2016). Chinaâ¢s property 
market cycle is a key factor behind the fairly robust domestic growth 

performance, with rising house prices and rapid 

growth of household borrowing helping to 

underpin consumption. Real estate investment has 

also outpaced overall inve
stment in 2017 Q1-Q3. 
The property market is ex
pected to cool gradually, 
as targeted macro-prudential measures to limit 

speculative excesses start to bite.  
High frequency indicators show steady momentum Chinaâ¢s high frequency data paint a benign picture. 
PMIs for both service and manufacturing sectors 

remain above 50, while overall rates of fixed asset 

investment and retail sales continue to be stable. 
Growth of industrial production has edged up 

recently, while industrial profitability has 

improved sharply due to a surge in producer prices 

precipitated by restrictions on output in some 

heavy industrial sectors. Retail sales have 

continued to grow steadily, while consumer 

confidence is at a multi-year high, and mortgage 

borrowing and short term consumer loans 

increased sharply from the start of 2017. Although 

house price growth is decelerating in tier 1 cities, 

the bulk of the urban population lives in tier 2 and 

tier 3 cities where house price inflation remains on 

an upward trend. This can be expected to provide 

further short term support to the consumer sector 

through wealth effects. The medium term outlook 

for consumption is however less clear as 

household incomes are growing slightly below 

GDP growth and consumption growth has been 

boosted by a combination of a falling household 

savings rate and higher borrowing.  
Policy remains supportive despite a crackdown on risky lending The precise fiscal stance remains hard to assess 
due to the prominent role 
of off-balance sheet local 
government spending, but on-budget spending has 

expanded more rapidly than nominal GDP. 

Investment by state enterp
rises also continues to 
grow more rapidly than investment in general, but 

the pace of growth is slowing as this form of

China has maintained the spurt in momentum seen in late 2016 and early 2017 and growth for 2017 is 
now expected to be similar to 2
016, gradually deceleratin
g into 2018 and 2019 as structural factors 
weigh on the outlook. Short term risks remain balanced. The growth in corporate leverage slowed in 

2017 but overall credit growth continues to outpace nominal GDP growth.  
Other non-EU Countries, China 
  149 stimulus is gradually wound down. Monetary 
policy remains broadly accommodative. During 

2017, the Chinese authorities have cracked down 

on riskier forms of financial intermediation, 

including new controls on lending from banks to 

non-bank financial intermediaries. This has led to a 

rise in inter-bank rates and bond market rates, 

though the impact on actual effective bank lending 

rates appears muted. Credit continues to expand 

faster than nominal GDP, though this gap has 

narrowed due to the pick-up in producer prices. 

Capital outflows have abated in recent months as 

the RMB has benefitted from US dollar weakness, 

easing the pressure on China to tighten policy to 

limit outflows. In trade weighted terms the RMB 

nominal exchange rate has been relatively stable in 

2017 (CFETS measure), wh
ile the real effective 
rate has edged down 2-3% (BIS data).  
Regional trade has rebounded strongly Trade in the Asia region has rebounded strongly in 

2017 after a particularly weak 2015 and subdued 

2016, with Chinaâ¢s exports and imports both 

growing rapidly. High-end consumption goods 

imports showed particular strength. Looking 

ahead, export and import growth are both expected 

to moderate slightly in 2018 and 2019, but the  
positive outlook for both global and regional 

growth, together with the supportive currency, 

should limit the slowdown in exports. 
Short term risks are balanced, but fragilities remain Chinaâ¢s property cycle is turning, and a sharper 
than expected slowdown in 
the sector is a key risk to the outlook.  It also remains to be seen whether 

the strong contribution of consumption to growth 

can be sustained without faster growth of 

household incomes. Corporate leverage appears to 

have stabilised in 2017, aided by the pick-up in 

producer prices, but remains at a high level, with 

much of the growth in leverage concentrated in 

state firms and the property sector.  Structural 

factors fuelling leverage, such as the use of SoEs 

as a counter-cyclical policy instrument and the low 

returns on investment, remain largely unaddressed. 

While a disorderly adjustment is not projected, it is 

clear that financial fragilities remain elevated and 

this form of policy intervention is reaching its 

limits.  Finally, private investment has been 

growing at just 5% in nominal terms for the past 

2-3 years and constitutes a potential upside risk 

given the strong revival in export performance  

in 2017.

37. EFTA Solid near-term prospects as growth converges to trend 
 150 Switzerland Revisions to Swiss national accounts data have 
resulted in material changes to historical figures 

for the period 2013-2016. On aggregate, this 

implies an upward revision to historical GDP 

levels and growth rates. However, as a result of 

these statistical revisions and the Swiss economyâ¢s 

weak performance in the first half of 2017 (0.1% 

q-o-q in 2017-Q1, 0.3% q-o-q in 2017-Q2), the 

outlook for the whole year has been revised down 

to 0.9%. The economyâ¢s slowdown in the first half 

of 2017 was led by sluggish activity in most 

service sectors, offsetting improving output in 

manufacturing, financial services and leisure 

industries.  
Going forward, sentiment indicators point to a 
marked acceleration in activity in the near term, 

driven largely by the impulse provided by rising 

global demand and world trade. While the 

performance of the pharm
aceutical sector is likely 
to remain robust due its low price sensitivity, a 

moderate broad-based upward trend for other 

exports (machinery, tourism, financial services) is 

also projected in line with fading effects of the 
Swiss Francâ¢s (CHF) past appreciation. Better 

growth prospects for the EU should also boost 

domestic confidence and encourage business 

investment, particularly given still-favourable 

financing conditions. While wage growth is 
expected to remain weak, continued moderate 

recovery in the labour market should support 

household incomes and private consumption. 

Combining these factors,
 Switzerlandâ¢s economy 
is forecast to expand by 1.8% in both 2018 and 

2019, supported by both exports and domestic 

demand.  
In terms of monetary policy, the Swiss National 
Bank (SNB) has maintained interest rates on sight 

deposits at -0.75% at its most recent policy 
meeting. Going forward, inflation is projected to 

reach 0.5% in 2017 in lin
e with higher oil prices, 

while inflationary pressures for the outer years of 

the forecast horizon are set to remain muted. Given 
these weak underlying inflation dynamics, the 

monetary policy stance is forecast to remain 

accommodative. The Swiss franc depreciated 

further against the euro ov
er the summer, which, if 
maintained, would further benefit Swiss exports. 
In line with the projected upswing in economic 
activity and Switzerlandâ¢s statutory debt brake, 

which requires a balanced budget over the course 

of the economic cycle, small surpluses are 

projected over the coming years. 
Risks to the outlook are largely external and relate 
to global demand and global trade. Further 

uncertainty relating to geopolitical turbulence 

could also result in safe haven capital inflows and 

place upward pressure on the Swiss franc.  
Norway Following the Norwegian economyâ¢s slowdown in 

2016, its adjustment to lower energy prices appears 

to be progressing steadily, as shown by the pick-up 

in labour force participation rates and employment, 

with this feeding into 
robust GDP growth over 
recent quarters (1
.1% q-o-q in 2017-Q2). Domestic 
demand has been the principal driver of growth so 

far in 2017, reflecting the ongoing rebound in the 

labour market and the continued provision of 

policy support, particularly on the fiscal side 

(modest tax cuts, labour market activation 

measures); while rapid house price growth has

Switzerland -Real GDP growth and contributions
forecast
Following a period of adjustment in earlier years,
 driven largely by exter
nal factors (oil prices, 
currency appreciation), growth is rising steadily in both Switzerland and Norway, underpinned by a 
steady amelioration in labour markets and solid mome
ntum in domestic demand. In Iceland, meanwhile, 
exceptionally strong growth in earlier years is beginn
ing to moderate to more sustainable levels.  
Other non-EU Countries, EFTA 
  151 supported residential investment. The external 
environment has proven challenging, in part due to 

the Norwegian kroneâ¢s (NOK
) steady appreciation.  
Going forward, underlying drivers of growth are 

set to shift somewhat, with the significant negative 

contribution from net exports turning neutral from 

2018 onwards. On the one hand, further 

improvement in the labour market, positive real 

wage growth, and additional measures to ease 

personal income taxes are expected to sustain 

private consumption growth at robust rates; while 

on the other, this is offset by fewer public 

infrastructure projects and 
the anticipated cooling 
of the housing market. In turn, import growth is set 

to moderate as the effects of past currency 

appreciation subside. Ov
erall, GDP growth is 
expected to come in at 1.5% in 2017, before 

accelerating modestly to 
1.6% (2018) and 1.8% 
(2019).  
Despite the economyâ¢s demonstrable improvement 
over recent months, remaining slack is evident as 

nominal wage growth has fallen and core inflation 

(at 1% in September) is well-below Norges Bankâ¢s 

2.5% target. Going forw
ard, the macroeconomic 
policy mix is expected to remain accommodative 

in the near term, particularly on the monetary 

policy side as Norgeâ¢s Bank left its key policy rate 

on hold at 0.5% in September. This is set to 

support further improvement in the labour market, 

with the unemployment rate expected to fall to 3% 

by the end of the forecas
t horizon, while wage 
growth is forecast to accelerate modestly as the 

labour market tightens. Inflation, meanwhile, is 

expected to return to around 2Â½% in the outer 

years of the forecast as slack is absorbed. 
Over the medium term, however, policy support is 
expected to be scaled-back as economic activity 
recovers further and inflationary pressures build. 

This is already being refl
ected in recent changes to 
limit spending of petroleum revenues, as well as 

the governmentâ¢s October budget which provides a 

broadly neutral fiscal impulse to growth already in 

2018. 
Recent indications are that activity in the housing 
market is slowing and house price growth is 

beginning to moderate. This is expected to lead to 

more moderate residential investment than in 

recent years; while the outstanding stock of 

household debt (230% of disposable income) 

ensures that related vulnerabilities will decline 

only gradually. 
The principal domestic risk facing the outlook 
relates to the interplay of high levels of household 

debt with house price in
flation, albeit these are 
beginning to subside slowly. Nonetheless, a large 

negative price shock or a tighter monetary policy 

stance than currently anticipated would imply 

negative spillovers to the real economy also. 

External risks relate to the future dynamics of oil 

prices and growth among key trading partners.  
Iceland GDP in Iceland contracted during the first half of 

2017 (-0.7% q-o-q in 2017-Q1, -1.1% in 

2017-Q2), led by falls in fixed investment and 

exports in the first quarter, followed by a 

significant increase in 
imports in the second. 
However, this quarterly profile is heavily distorted 

by unusually large base effects from the second 

half of 2016, and, when considering the economyâ¢s 

performance in year-on-year terms, growth 

remains positive. In particular, private 

consumption and tourism-related exports have 

been robust; while investment remains solid but is 

beginning to slow following extraordinarily high 

growth in earlier years (a
nnual average growth of 
20% between 2014 and 2016). The domestic 

economy has benefited from strong real wage 

growth and rising labour force participation, as 

well as buoyant activity in the construction sector 

in order to meet residential and tourism-related 

infrastructure demands. Overall, GDP growth is 

expected to moderate (from an exceptionally 

strong outturn of 7.2% in 2016) to 4.6% in 2017. 
Icelandâ¢s economy is expected to undergo a phase 
of soft landing over the 
remainder of the forecast 
horizon, moderating to 3.1% and 2.3% in 2018 and 

2019, respectively. Continued employment growth

  152 and real wage gains are expected to underpin 
private consumption; while, despite the anticipated 

strong performance of residential construction, 

investment is expected to moderate further. On the 

external side, tourism exports are set to slow, while 

import growth is forecast to
 remain elevated given 
the high import content of domestic demand. 
Despite robust economic growth, core inflation has 
yet to show signs of a durable pick-up. Over recent 

months, it has fallen further (1.7% in September), 

reflecting the Icelandi
c kronaâ¢s appreciation 
following the relaxation of capital controls, as well 

as increased competition in the retail sector and 

building signs of a slowdown in housing inflation. 
Nonetheless, price pressure
s are expected to build 
as demand grows, with monetary policy responsive 

in anchoring inflation and inflation expectations 

around the Central Bank of Icelandâ¢s 2.5% target.  
The labour market has been strong and the 
unemployment rate fell further in August (to 

2.5%). Going forward, labour demand is expected 

to be dampened by new wage agreements already 

in 2018; while additional labour supply will 

largely depend on foreign workers given 

already-high domestic employment rates. An 

extraordinary fiscal surp
lus of 12.9% of GDP was 
recorded in 2016 due to a one-off windfall gain 

from lifting capital controls. This is expected to be 

much more modest going forward, coming in at 

around 1-1Â½% of GDP over the forecast horizon 

as fiscal policy remains focused on debt reduction. 

As such, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to 

fall to under 30% by 2019.  
In the near term, political uncertainty following the 
collapse of the coalition government could prevent 

a timely adoption of the 2018 Budget as there are 

increasing calls for increases in government 

spending on infrastructure and health care. Large 

wage increases emerging from upcoming 

negotiations could erode competitiveness of 

Icelandic firms, while this could be amplified 

further by persistent capital inflows and their 

upward pressure on the krona.

38. RUSSIAN FEDERATION 
Cyclical rebound fading as structural rigidities kick in 
 153 Economic recovery to progress gradually Russiaâ¢s economic recovery has gathered 
momentum over recent months, with GDP growth 

accelerating to 2.5% (y
-o-y) in 2017-Q2. 
Improving growth prospects have been 

underpinned by the ongoing stabilisation in the 

macroeconomic environment 
and rising oil prices, 
resulting in rising business and consumer 

confidence and a broad-based upturn in domestic 

demand; while the contribution from net exports 

has turned markedly negative as previously 

pent-up import demand is beginning to expand. 
Overall, recent dynamics are expected to remain 
broadly in place, supportin
g an upward revision of 
GDP growth to 1.7% in 2017. However, growth is 

expected to moderate slightly to around 1Â½% in 

future years, reflecting the conclusion of large 

capital investment projects 
already in 2017, while 
fiscal consolidation need
s, sanctions, structural 
barriers to growth and weak prospects for 

substantive reforms are also expected to weigh on 

the cyclical upturn currently under way. 
 Broad-based recovery in domestic demand The stabilisation of oil prices and the exchange 

rate, following significant adjustments in earlier 

years, has facilitated the steady upturn in sentiment 

among businesses and consumers, albeit from a 
very low base. On the consumer side, real wages 

remain firmly in positive territory and the 

contraction in disposable incomes has largely 

finished, providing for modest increases in retail 

sales for the first time since 2014. This has 

supported rising output and investment among 

businesses also, and the near term outlook (output, 

new orders) points to solid growth, complemented 

also by tentative signs of rising external demand. 
Nonetheless, the exceptionally strong performance 
in 2017-Q2 is expected to moderate going forward, 

in line with slower investment and weaker 

inventory accumulation in the coming period. 
Macroeconomic policy stance slowly easing The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has 

successfully reined in pri
ce growth, with inflation 
falling further below the 4% target in recent 

months (2.9% in September). While this is 

explained in part by exceptionally weak food price 

inflation and rouble appreciation from 2016 levels, 

conditions are in place for further easing of the 

monetary policy stance over the course of the 

forecast horizon. This is expected to ameliorate 

financing conditions among businesses, although 

credit growth is set to remain constrained by the 

impact of sanctions on external financing costs, as 

well as still-weak profitability and remaining 

fragilities in the domestic banking sector. 
On the fiscal side, building on the federal 
governmentâ¢s updated budgetary parameters 

released in September 2
017, it is expected that consolidation will proceed over the forecast 
horizon. However, higher oil revenues and rising 

economic activity provide space for modestly 

higher nominal spending than previously 

considered, implying a less severe adjustment in 

real terms.  
Overall, the fiscal deficit 
is now forecast to narrow 
to 1.1 % of GDP by the end of the forecast horizon 

(from a 2016 level of 3.7%), with this falling 

largely on the expenditure side, meaning that

pps.
The economyâ¢s recovery has gathered momentum as rising oil prices and solid gains in consumer and 
business confidence are feeding into higher domestic
 demand. These dynamics are expected to remain 
in place in the near term, although the current momentum is likely to run into long-standing structural 

constraints. Overall, growth is forecast to remain moderate and close to potential at around 1Â½% over 

the forecast horizon. 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2017 
  154 public consumption continues to exert a minor 
drag on growth. The fiscal
 forecast is subject to 
some upward risks as the recent bank rescue 

measures might imply large, yet unknown, fiscal 

costs and further depletion of remaining fiscal 

reserves. 
Current account balance to deteriorate marginally Russian exports are expected to benefit from a 
gradual rise in external demand and higher oil 

prices. Better terms of trade in 2017 should 

temporarily outweigh the effects of the unwinding 

of pent-up import demand (following the 

cumulative contraction of 34% between 2014 and 

2016), which combined with rising domestic 

activity and rouble appreciation is forecast to result 

in a modest decline in the current account surplus 

to 1Â½% by 2019.  
Medium term growth potential still subdued The economy remains highly reliant on extractive 

industries, both in terms of value-added and 

generating fiscal revenues. Significant shifts in this 

respect are not anticipat
ed over the forecast 
horizon and, similarly, long-standing structural 
impediments to growth (poor business 

environment, low investment, labour market 

rigidities) are set to remain in place given the 

persistence of weak reform momentum. 
These weaknesses are amplified further by the re-
emergence of risks in the financial sector, as 

highlighted by the recent rescue of two large 

commercial banks, one of which is considered 

systemically important. As a result, funding 

constraints are likely to weigh on growth in the 

near term.  
The current sanctions environment, as well as the 
recent extension of sanctions in the US, is 

expected to weigh further on medium- and long-

term growth prospects, most notably via their 

impact on access to external finance. 
Major risks remain Uncertainties surrounding oil price assumptions 

remain the key downside risk facing the economic 

outlook for Russia at present, while geopolitical 

tensions also remain prominent. On the upside, 

some fiscal loosening in the run-up to the 

presidential elections in 2018 may result in higher 

short-term demand stimulus.

The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG ECFIN) 
produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fully-fledged economic 
forecasts in Winter, Spring and Autumn.These forecasts cover the 
principal macroeconomic aggregates for the Member States, the 
candidate countries,the European Unio
n as a whole, the euro area and 
the international environment.

Montenegro, Serbia, and Albania.
Source: National Accounts (ESA 2010), except for US current-account in 

tables 50, 52, and 61 (Balance of Payments). Discrepancies with balance 
of payments statistics may arise due to methodological differences and 
revision schedules.
   Latin America :
EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates. World 
GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS). In the tables

The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential output 
as estimated via a production function, where the increase in the capital 
stock and the difference between actual unemployment and the 
NAWRU play a key role.

   Sub-Saharan Africa : 
aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates. Tables 
49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area "adjusted" balances. 
Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area vis-Ã -vis third countries 
should be identical to the sum of the balances of the individual countries 
in the EU or  the euro area. However,
 intra-EU or intra-euro-area balances 
are non-zero because of reporting errors. The creation of the internal 

market in 1993 reduced border controls and formalities, and accordingly 
the scope and precision of intra-EU trade coverage. Typically, intra-EU 
imports are underestimated compared to intra-EU exports, leading to an 
overestimation of the surplus. For the past the "adjusted" balances are 

Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB estimates for the euro area. For the 
future, they are ECFIN's forecasts based on the extrapolation of the 
discrepancies observed in 2016.
   Potential candidates :
Employment data used in tables 23-29 and 32-33 are based on full-time-
equivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain, France, Italy, and 
the Netherlands report FTE data. In the absence of FTE data, employment 
is based on numbers of persons. In the calculation of EU and euro-area 
aggregates, priority is given to FTE data, as this is regarded as more 
representative of diverse patterns of working time.
