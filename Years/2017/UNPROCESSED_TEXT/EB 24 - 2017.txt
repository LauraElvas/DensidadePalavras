 2 Economic and monetary
 developments
 Overview
 At its monetary policy 
meeting on 14
 December 2017, the Governing Council 
concluded that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still needed to 
secure a return of inflation towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%.
 The 
information that has become available since the
 previous monetary policy meeting in 
late 
October
, including 
the
 new 
Eurosystem 
staff projections, indicates a strong pace 
of economic expansion and a significant improvement in the growth outlook. The 
Governing Council assessed that the 
strong cyclical mo
mentum and the significant 
reduction of economic slack give grounds for greater confidence that inflation will 
converge towards 
its
 aim. At the same time, domestic price pressures remain muted 
overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained up
ward trend.
 The 
Governing Council therefore concluded that a
n ample degree of monetary stimulus 
remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and 
support headline inflation developments over the medium term. This continued 
monetary support is provided by the additional net asset purchases that 
the 
Governing Council
 decided on at 
the 
October monetary policy meeting, by the 
sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by 
the
 forward guidance on intere
st rates.
 Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 
14 December 
201
7 The Governing Council™s economic assessment reflected that the euro area 
economic expansion continues to be solid and broad
-based across countries 
and sectors.
 Real GDP growth is supported by growth in private consumption and 
investment as well as exports benefiting from the broad
-based global recovery. The 
latest survey results and incoming data confirm robust growth momentum. 
The 
global economy is a
lso continuing to expand at a solid rate, and the recovery shows 
signs of synchronisation globally.
 Financing conditions in the euro area have remained very favourable.
 Euro 
area
 sovereign bond yields have declined slightly since 
7 September
. Corporate 
bond spreads 
have 
also 
fallen, 
while equity prices of euro area non
-financial 
corporations (NFCs) 
have 
increased. At the same time, valuations of corporate 
bonds and equities 
have 
continued to be supported by the robust economic outlook. 
In foreign exchange m
arkets, the euro 
has 
remained broadly unchanged
 in recent 
months
. Looking ahead, the December
 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections for the euro area foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.4% in 
2017, 2.3% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.
 Compared with the 
September
 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for GDP growth 
ECB 
Economic Bulletin, Issue 8 / 2017
 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 Overview
 3 has been revised 
upwards 
substantially. The ongoing economic expansion in the 
euro area is 
expected
 to continue
 to be
 supported by the ECB™s monetary policy 
measures
. Furthermore, private expenditure and consumption growth are supported 
by lower deleveraging needs and i
mproved labour market conditions
. Improvements 
in corporate profitability and the very favourable financing conditions continue to 
promote 
the r
ecovery in business investment
, while euro area exporters are 
benefiting from the ongoing global economic expansion
. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.5% in November, up from 1.4% in 
October, according to Eurostat™s flash estimate.
 At the same time, me
asures of 
underlying inflation have moderated somewhat recently, in part owing to special 
factors. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of 
headline inflation are likely to moderate in the coming months, mainly reflect
ing base 
effects in energy prices, before increasing again. Underlying inflation is expected to 
rise gradually over the medium term, supported by 
the ECB™s
 monetary policy 
measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of 
economic slack and rising wage growth.
 This assessment is also broadly reflected in the December 2017 Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area
, which foresee annual HICP 
inflation at 1.5% in 2017, 1.4% in 2018, 1.5% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.
 Compared with the September
 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the 
outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised up, mainly reflecting higher 
oil 
and food prices.
 The latest staff projections also foresee the euro area budget deficit declining 
further over the projection horizon, mainly as a result of improving cyclical 
conditions and decreasing interest payments.
 The aggregate fiscal stance for
 the 
euro area is projected to be broadly neutral. The euro area government debt
-to
-GDP 
ratio is expected to continue to decline, albeit from a still high level.
 Complementing the economic assessment, the monetary analysis showed that 
money growth remained
 robust in October and during the third quarter of 
2017. Broad money continued to expand at 
5% in October, in line with the steady 
pace
 witnessed since mid
-2015. The recovery in loan growth to the private sector 
has 
also continued
. The annual flow of total
 external financing to NFCs is estimated 
to have strengthened in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting improvements in both 
bank lending and debt securities issuance.
 Monetary policy decisions
 Based on the regular economic and monetary analyses, the Govern
ing Council 
confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to 
secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but 
close to, 2%.
 The Governing Council 
decided to keep the
 key ECB interest rates
 unchanged
 and con
tinues 
to expect them to remain at their present levels for an 
extended period of time, and well past the horizon of 
the
 net asset purchases.
 Regarding
 non-standard monetary policy measures, 
the Governing Council
 ECB 
Economic Bulletin, Issue 8 / 2017
 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 Overview
 4 confirm
ed its intention to continue to make
 net asset purchases under the asset 
purchase programme (APP
), from January 2018 onwards 
at a monthly pace of 
•30 billion, until the end of September
 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any 
case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in 
the path of inflation 
consistent with its inflation aim. 
Moreover, the Governing Council reconfirmed that i
f the outlook 
became
 less favourable, or if financial conditions 
became
 inconsistent 
with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path
 of inflation,
 it would
 stand ready to increase the APP in terms of size and/or duration. 
The Governing 
Council also reiterated that t
he Eurosystem will reinvest the principal payments from 
maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period
 of time after the 
end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary.

 5 1 External environment
 The global economy is 
continuing to expand at 
a solid
 rate
, with increasing
 signs of 
synchronisation
. 
The outlook among advanced economies entails 
robust 
expansion, 
which slows down over the projection horizon as the upturn matures. Among 
emerging market economies
, the outlook is supported by strengthening activity in 
commodity exporters
. Global trade 
indi
cators point to a rebound in the third 
quarter
. 
Global inflation 
is expected
 to rise 
slowly as 
spare capacity at the global level 
diminishes
. Global economic activity and trade
 The sustained pace of expansion of the global economy has become more 
broad
-bas
ed and extended into the second half of the year.
 The recovery shows 
signs of synchronisation globally
, as
 the share of countries with growth in economic 
activity above the average 
of recent 
years has been increasing since the second half 
of 2016. Across a
dvanced economies, US economic activity 
expanded at a solid 
pace in the third quarter
, in spite of the impact of the recent hurricanes. Real GDP 
growth in Japan also remained 
robust, while 
activity in the 
United Kingdom was
 relatively muted
, partly on acco
unt of the negative effect of the depreciation 
of the 
pound on real household income and consumption, which more than offset the gains 
in competitiveness and the positive impetus 
from the increasingly robust expansion 
in the euro area. Across emerging econ
omies, activity has been supported by India 
and China, 
as well as
 by 
the recoveries in Brazil and Russia after 
their 
deep recessions, although some loss of dynamism is anticipated in the short
 term in the 
latter
. Survey
-based indicators and sentiment surve
ys point to sustained global 
growth in the near term.
 The global composite output 
Purchasing Managers™ Index 
(PMI
), excluding the euro area
, remained at similar levels in 
the third quarter 
to those 
recorded in the previous two quarters, close to long
-run 
averages, and pointing to a 
continued steady expansion in global activity
 (see Chart
 1). S
entiment survey 
indicators 
have also 
risen over the past few months.

 Notes: The latest observations are for 
November 
2017. ﬁLong
-term averageﬂ refers to the period from January 1999 to November 
2017. Monetary policies show some divergence, but overall global financial 
conditions remain supportive.
 Markets continue to expect a very gradual monetary 
tightening in the 
United States
. The 
Federal Open Market Committee (
FOMC
) left 
policy rates unchanged at its September meeting, but decided to start reducing the 
Fed
eral Reserve System
™s balance sheet. 
In D
ecember, in line with market 
expectations, 
a rate 
hike 
took place
. Expectations of tightening in the 
United 
Kingdom
, confirmed by the rise in the official policy rate, 
continued to firm
 following 
the surge in inflation to above target levels and persistent
 upward 
price 
pressures 
following
 the 
recent 
depreciation
 of the pound
. 
In Japan, t
he Bank of Japan 
maintain
ed its accommodative stance
. I
n China, in order to curb leverage in the 
financial system, the 
People™s Bank of China has 
allowed financial condition
s to 
tighten since the beginning of the year, increasing its open
-market interest rates and 
guiding interbank rates
 upwards
. Other 
emerging market economies (
EMEs
), 
including India and some commodity exporters, lowered policy rates as 
inflation
ary
 pressures subsided and exchange rates firmed. Overall, financial market sentiment 
has remained strong in advanced economies, with gains in equity markets and a 
further decline in volatility. Among EMEs, interest rates have declined
 in various key 
economie
s, contributing to a modest easing in financial conditions
, and capital 
inflows have 
risen strongly.
 Looking ahead, economic activity is expected to remain broadly stable at the 
global level, but developments across countries and regions vary notably.
 The 
outlook among advanced economies 
is for 
a robust expansion, which slows down 
over the projection horizon as the recoveries
 Œ particularly in the 
United States
 and Japan
 Œ mature and output gaps gradually 
close, while growth in the United Kingdom 
is anticip
ated to remain muted
. Among EMEs, the outlook is supported by the 
recovery in commodity exporters, particularly Brazil and Russia. In India and China
, growth remains 
solid
, but China is expected to transition to 
a lower growth trajectory

 7 in view of slowing
 potential growth. Overall, these trends broadly offset each other, 
leading to a stable global GDP growth outlook
. The growth potential has declined across most advanced and emerging 
economies in recent years and is expected to stabilise at below pre
-crisi
s levels.
 In advanced economies, capital contributions have diminished as rates of 
investment 
have 
fallen
 in the wake of the financial crisis, driven by
 the ensuing
 weakened expectations of demand prospects together with tighter financial 
conditions and he
ightened uncertainty. Investment 
was
 also 
lower
 in emerging 
market economies, in particular in commodity
-exporting countries. 
Waning support 
from demographics 
has added to t
he decline in growth 
potential in several countries.
 In the United States, activity
 is expected to remain robust on the back of solid 
domestic demand.
 The recovery 
will continue 
on the back of solid growth in 
investment and consumption, as tight labour market conditions gradually feed into 
higher wage growth and favourable financial cond
itions boost wealth. Moreover, 
the 
strengthening 
of external
 demand and the recent depreciation
 of the US dollar 
also 
support the 
US 
outlook. 
The tax reform and the associated
 fiscal package 
are likely 
to provide some impetus from next year onwards
. However, GDP 
growth 
is projected 
to decelerate gradually 
in the medium term
, returning
 to 
its 
potential
. In the United Kingdom, real GDP growth is expected to remain relatively muted 
owing to high uncertainty.
 The 
recent 
slowdown 
in economic activity, 
led by private 
consumption as households began to feel 
the
 impact 
of 
rising inflation and shrinking 
real wage growth
, is
 expected to 
extend 
over the coming quarters
. Relatively 
subdued growth expectations 
reflect the ongoing impact of high uncertainty and th
e strong depreciation 
of the pound 
in the aftermath of the UK referendum
 on EU 
membership.
 In Japan, economic expansion is expected to remain firm, supported by 
domestic and external factors.
 While waning fiscal support is likely to act as a drag 
on growth
, economic activity is expected to be supported by firming foreign demand
, private investment gains associated with high profits and increasing labour and 
capacity shortages
, and favourable financing conditions. The 
planned 
VAT hike 
in 
October 2019 
is, however
, expected to have a negative impact on economic activity 
after its implementation
. In China, activity continues to expand at a robust pace, supported by resilient 
consumption and a still robust housing market.
 The near
-term outlook is 
dominated by the
 authorities™ focus on stable growth
, given the ongoing political 
transition, while the assumption over the medium
 term is that continued structural 
reforms 
will 
gradually 
be implemented, leading to an orderly slowdown
. Economic activity in central and eas
tern European countries is expected to 
accelerate in the near term, driven by a rebound in investment and strong 
private consumption.
 Domestic demand will continue to be the main driver of 
economic growth
 looking forward
, on the back of improving labour ma
rkets and 
higher absorption of EU funds

 8 The large commodity
-exporting countries are continuing their recovery 
following deep recessions.
 In Russia, 
leading indicators signal a softening of 
the 
recovery 
in the short term, but
 growth is expected to resume 
afterwards, supported 
by higher oil prices, a stronger rouble and declining inflation. Over the medium
 term, 
growth is expected to remain mild amid fiscal challenges weighing on the business 
environment and the lack of fixed investment and structural refor
ms undermining 
Russia™s supply capacity
. 
In Brazil, 
although recurring political uncertainties are 
continuously weighing on business investment and consumer spending, loosening 
financial conditions alongside increasing monetary accommodation and improving 
terms
 of trade will support the economy over the 
medium term
. Global trade growth remained robust in the second quarter, and prospects 
remain positive in the near term.
 Global merchandise import growth momentum 
suggests continued robust global trade in the
 third quarter of the year
 (see Chart
 2). 
The volume of merchandise imports increased by 1.6% in September (in three
-month
-on-three
-month terms)
, mainly due to a sharp rebound 
in 
import growth in 
EMEs
, particularly in Asia and Latin America. In advanced ec
onomies, by contrast, 
September data point to a negative reading for the 
United States 
and Japan, 
confirming the fall in imports (goods and services) in available national accounts 
releases. Leading indicators seem to confirm robust world trade dynamics, w
ith PMI 
new export orders remaining at high levels
 at the start of the fourth quarter

 Note: The latest observations are for November 2017 (global PMI manufacturing), October 2017 (global PMI new export orders) a

 Looking further ahead, global trade is expected to continue expanding.
 The 
combination of strong tr
ade indicators and surveys and the repeated surprises on the 
upside could suggest that there is more cyclical momentum in world trade than 
previously 
anticipated related to the cyclical upturn and the recovery in investment.
 Overall, global growth is proje
cted to remain broadly stable over the projection 
horizon.

 9 projections, world real GDP growth (excluding the euro area) is projected to 
increase 
from 3.7% in 2017 to 3.9% in 2018, before 
gradually 
returning to 3.7% in 2020
. 
This 
development results from 
a gradual slowdown over the projection horizon for 
advanced economies, where the cycle is more mature, which is offset by 
increased 
dynamism in EMEs, particularly 
in 
Latin America
. Growth i
n euro area foreign 
demand is forecast to 
expand by 5.5% in 2017, 4.4% in 2018, 3.8% in 2019 and 
3.5% in 20
20. Compared with the September 2017 projections, 
global GDP is only 
revised marginally upwards in 2017
-18. Growth in euro area foreign demand has 
been revised 
upwards 
over the whole projection horizon, 
reflecting data revisions 
and a more positive view on medium
-term developments
. Risks to the outlook for global activity are on the upside in the short term, but 
remain skewed to the downside in the med
ium term.
 On the upside, there is 
a possibility that improved sentiment 
will 
translate into a faster
-than
-expected revival 
in 
activity. A larger than expected fiscal stimulus along the lines currently 
being 
discussed in 
the 
US Congress 
also 
presents a mode
rate upside risk to US 
and global growth.
 However, medium
-term downside risks prevail, such as an increase in 
trade protectionism
, a sudden tightening 
in 
global financial conditions 
(which could 
affect vulnerable EMEs
 in particular),
 disruptions associated
 with China™s reform and 
liberalisation process
, and political and geopolitical uncertainties
, including those 
related to the negotiations on the future relations between the United Kingdom and 
the European Union.
 Global price developments
 Global consumer 
price inflation declined slightly in October, as energy prices 
decelerated.
 After increasing during the previous few months, as the contribution of 
energy prices intensified, a
nnual consumer price inflation in the OECD area 
declined
 in 
October
, 
to 
2.2% (se

xcluding food and energy, 
OECD 
annual inflation 
increased to 1.9%, after having remained stable 
at 1.8% for the 
previous five months.

 0.32
% (see Chart

However, 
the GDP

sovereign bond yield decreased by 
5 basis points to 0.88
%, owing to idiosyncratic 
falls in the sovereign bond yields of some euro area countries. I

area long
-term interest rates since early September have been muted overall
 and have not mirrored increases abroad, o
wing to 
market expectations for euro area 
monetary policy
. In the United States, 
the rise was driven partly by the 
prospect
 of 
reforms to the federal tax code
, while in the United Kingdom
, a reassessment of the 
future path of monetary poli
cy was a factor.

 The euro area economic expansion continues to be solid and broad
-based across 
countries and sectors. Real GDP growth is supported by growth in private 
consumption and investment as well as 
exports benefitting from the broad
-based 
global recovery. The latest survey results and incoming data confirm robust growth 
momentum in the near term. C

, 
1.9% in 2019
 and 1.7% in 
2020. The economic expansion in the euro area continues to be buoyant and is 
broad

 Real GDP increased by 0.
6%, quarter 
on quarter, in the 
third 
quarter of 
2017, following growth of 0.7% in the previous 
quarter (see Chart

omestic demand
, notably 
fixed 
investment spending, and to a lesser extent net exports and changes in 
inventories. On the production side, activity was broad
-based, with strong value 
added growth in industry (excluding construction) and slightly lower growth in the 
construction and serv
ices sectors.

 Notes: The latest observations are for the third quarter of 2017 for employment and hours worked and October 2017 for the 
unemployment rate.
 Imp
roving labour markets continue to support income growth and consumer 
spending.
 Private consumption growth slowed slightly in the third quarter of 2017 to 
0.3%, quarter on quarter, down from 0.5% in the previous quarter. This growth, 
particularly in durable
 goods, has been underpinned by the recovery in labour market 
conditions and rising real wages per employee. The ECB™s monetary policy 
measures, which have eased financing conditions, also remain supportive of 
household spending. The savings ratio has decl
ined in the last few quarters, mainly 
reflecting both an improvement in households™ economic and financial situation, and 
the low interest rate environment, which is reducing their propensity to save. 
Consumer confidence rose further in November 2017
 as a 
result of households™ 
being more optimistic about their future financial circumstances and the general 
situation in the euro area. As a consequence, consumer confidence is now close to 
its historical highs, signalling strong underlying consumption dynamics
 in the near 
term.

 18 The recovery in housing markets is expected to continue to drive growth.
 Housing investment increased by 1.3% in the second quarter of 2017, reflecting a 
continuation of the recovery in the euro area 
as a whole 
and in many 
individual 
euro 
area countries. Since the 
onset
 of the euro area crisis, 
developments in 
housing 
investment and household indebt
edness have 
moved
 in opposite directions. 
In 2008
 household indebtedness 
started to rise, while
 housing investment 
began to decline.
 Since 
2013 this trend has reversed
, with the recovery in investment 
being 
accompanied by 
household
 deleveraging. These developments are in sharp contrast 
with 
those during the period prior to
 the crisis 
when
 both in
debtedness
 and investment 
were on the rise 
(see
 Chart
 12). Chart 12
 Indebtedness and housing investment
 (cumulative percentage changes)
  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 Notes: The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2017.
 Housing investment and house prices continue
 to
 be bolster
ed by 
very 
favourable 
financing conditions, portfolio 
shifts
 to housing in the context of low yields on 
alternative long
-term investment opportunities and rising income growth related to 
ongoing job creation. Recent indicators suggest 
that
 this positive mo
mentum in 
housing investment
 is set to continue
. Business confidence in the construction of 
buildings segment improved further in October and remains at levels last seen in 
2008. Construction production 
also rose 
in 
the third quarter
, 
in line
 with 
the 
posi
tive 
growth 
in housing investment in the same quarter, albeit at a 
slower pace than earlier 
in the year. A further improvement 
in the E
uropean 
Commission™s
 construction 
confidence indicator for the buildings segment in October and November compared 
with th
e third quarter
 suggests that the positive growth will
 also 
contin
ue in the fourth 
quarter.
 Business investment grew at a steady pace in the third quarter of 2017 and the 
short
-term outlook remains robust.
 Non
-construction investment grew by 1.9%, 
quarter on quarter, in the third quarter, following growth of 3.9% in the previous 
quarter. 
In the fourth quarter 
evidence from the European Commission™s survey 
suggests that 
supply constraints are perceived to 
have 
increase
d further
, pointing to 
a need to extend or rationalise the capital stock

 very favourable production 
expectations and order books
. 
Finally, 
moderate debt f
inancing growth
, together with 
the pronounced 
recovery in stock prices observed in recent years
, has brought the 
leverage ratio (debt to total assets) in the 
non-financial corporation (
NFC
) sector 
down 
to historical lows
, which should free up firms™ resour
ces for investment 
activities.
 Business investment is expected to recover further in the medium term.
 The 
robust outlook for investment is supported by a number of factors. C
apacity 
utilisation continues to 
rise, remaining
 above 
the 
average levels
 seen bef
ore the 
crisis,
 financing conditions are expected to 
stay
 very 
favourable
 and profit mark
-ups 
are 
foreseen 
to increase in the context of an already cash
-rich NFC sector. 
Moreover, 
deleveraging pressures are expected to diminish further as the economic 
expa
nsion progresses
 in the context of a low interest rate environment, in turn 
shoring up business investment growth. 
However, expectations of 
still subdued
 potential output growth and limitations on 
banks™
 intermediation capacity in some 
countries
, as well a
s remaining structural barriers and a lack of workers with certain 
skills, may 
continue to weigh on the outlook for business investment.
 Euro area exports continue to grow robustly.
 Monthly trade data 
point to
 strong 
momentum 
in extra
-euro area exports in 
the third quarter
, 
which posted
 a six
-year
 record annual
 increase 
of 
4.1% 
(taking into account observations for
 July and 
August) and
 are
 well above 
their 
post
-crisis average
 level
. This 
marks a 
continu
ation 
of the rebound 
that 
started in 2016. Favourable 
developments
 in foreign demand 
more than
 offset the adverse impact of 
the 
recent 
appreciation in the 
euro. Exports to 
non-EU countries, in particular China and the rest of Asia, 
are the main
 drive
r of
 the 
dynamics. Above
-average new manufacturing orders an
d export market climate 
indicators suggest 
that the 
strong growth
 in exports will continue over
 the coming 
months
 and that the positive momentum in
 intermediate and capital g
oods (see

ay be related to a rebound in global investment. A pick

may sustain exports in the medium
 term

 The European Commission™s

of survey

ﬂ in

 The ongoing economic expansion in the euro area is projected to continue, 
supported by the ECB™s mo
netary policy measures, which are being passed 
through to the real economy.
 Lower deleveraging needs continue to contribute to 
private expenditure growth. Improved labour market conditions, low interest rates 
and very favourable financing conditions suppor
t private consumption growth. 
Improvements in corporate profitability and very favourable financing conditions 
continue to promote the recovery in business investment. At the same time, euro 
area exporters continue to benefit from the ongoing global econom
ic expansion.

 22 4 Prices and costs
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.5
% in 
November, up from 1.4% in October. At the same time, measures of underlying 
inflation have moderated somewhat recently, in part owing to special factors. Looking 
ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation
 are likely to moderate in the coming months, mainly reflecting base effects in energy 
prices, before increasing again. Underlying inflation is expected to rise gradually over 
the medium term, supported by the ECB™s monetary policy measures, the continuing
 economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising 
wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the December 2017 
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual 
HICP inflation at 
1.5% in 2017, 1.4% in 2018, 1.5% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. 
Compared with the September 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the 
outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised up, mainly reflecting higher oil 
and food prices.
 Headline inflation i
ncreased slightly in November.
 According to Eurostat™s flash 
estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation rose to 1.5% in November, from 1.4% in 
October, returning to the level recorded in September (see Chart
 15). The November 
increase reflects mainly higher
 energy price inflation, marginally offset by a small 
decrease in food price inflation. The increase in energy inflation was larger than 
anticipated, stemming from the latest substantial increases in oil prices.

 Measures of underlying inflation have moderated 
somewhat recently, in part 
owing to special factors.
 HICP inflation excluding food and energy was 0.9% in 
November 2017, unchanged from October but down from 1.1% in September (see 
Chart
 16). This overall decline since September was due in part to large de
clines in 
inflation for certain services items, including education fees in Italy and transport

 Global price pressures remain strong but have still not passed through to the 
later stag
es of the pricing chain
 in the euro area
. Annual oil price inflation in euro 
terms has increased markedly over recent months and global non
-energy price 
pressures have remained strong (see Chart
 17). While these global upward 
pressures on euro area import 
prices have been mitigated by downward pressure 
from the impact of the euro™s appreciation over the summer, they continue to be 
reflected in the robust growth of import and producer prices for intermediate goods. 
Both grew at an annual rate of 3.5% in Octo
ber. The pass
-through to the later stages 
of the pricing chain, however, still appears to be weak, as annual producer price 
inflation for non
-food consumer goods remained broadly stable at only 0.2% in 
October. One possible explanation for the weak inflati
on in producer prices for non
-food consumer goods, despite robust price pressures at the earlier stages of the 
production and pricing chain, is that margins are being squeezed.

 Wage growth has increased somewhat over recent quarters.
 Annual growth in 
compensation per employee rose from a low of 1.1% in the second quarter of 2016 
to 1.7% in the third quarter of 2017. This increase was driven mainly by higher wage 
drift, which tends to react more quickly to cyclical developments than negotiated 
wages. Annual growth in negotiated wages per employee was 1.4% in the third 
quarter of 20
17, unchanged from the previous quarter and equal to the average for 
2016. Factors that may still be weighing on wage growth include still significant slack 
in the labour market, past low inflation, weak productivity growth and the ongoing 
impacts from lab
our market reforms implemented in some countries during the 
crisis.

-based 
measures of inflation expectations continues to point to a prolonged period of low 
inflation, with only a very gradual return to leve
ls below, but close to, 2%. The 
probability of deflation implied by inflation options markets remains low and suggests 
that deflation risk remains contained. According to the ECB Survey of Professional

 27 5 Money and credit
 In the third quarter of 2017 and in October, broad money growth continued to expand 
at the robust pace generally witness
ed since mid
-2015. The recovery in loan growth to 
the private sector also continued. The annual flow of total external financing to non
-financial corporations (NFCs) is estimated to have strengthened in the third quarter of 
2017, reflecting improvements in
 both bank lending and debt securities issuance.
 Growth in broad money remained robust at 
4.9
% on average 
in the 
third
 quarter of 2017
 and stood at 5.0% in October, in line with the steady pace of 
monetary expansion since mid
-2015 (see Chart 20).
 Money gro
wth was 
supported by t
he low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid instruments in an 
environment of very low interest rates, as well as 
by 
the impact of the ECB™s 
monetary policy measures. 
The most liquid components remained the main 
contributor to b
road money growth, with 
the annual growth rate of M1 
standing at
 9.4% in 
the third quarter of 2017 and in October
 (compared with 9.
2% in the second 
quarter of 2017 and 9.

September
). Chart 2

 Overnight deposits continued to be the main driv
er of M3 growth.
 Specifically, 
the annual growth rate of overnight deposits held by households and non
-financial 
corporations remained strong in the 
third
 quarter of 2017
 and in October. By 
contrast, the volatile 
annual growth rate of overnight deposits he
ld by
 non-monetary 
financial institutions declined in October, triggering the slowdown in M1 growth over 
the month
. The annual growth rate of currency in circulation 
remained broadly 
unchanged in the third quarter of 2017 and in October
, indicating no
 stro
ng tendency 
on the part of the money
-holding sector to substitute deposits with cash in an 
environment of very low or negative interest rates. Short
-term deposits other than 
overnight deposits (i.e. M2 minus M1) continued to have a negative impact on M3.

decrease in th
e attractiveness of these instruments, and a 
further decline in 
monetary financial institutions™ (MFIs) 
issuance of 
short
-term debt securities.
 Domestic sources of money creation were again the main driver of broad 
money growth (see Chart 2
1). From a count
erpart perspective, the Eurosystem™s 
purchases of general government debt securities (see the 
red
 portion
 of 
the 
bars in
 Chart 2
1), conducted mainly in the context of the ECB™s public sector purchase 
programme (PSPP), contributed 
positively
 to M3 growth. T
he ongoing recovery in 
credit to the private sector (see the 
blue
 portion
 of 
the 
bars in 
Chart 2
1) also 
continued to support M3 growth
. This includes both MFI loans to the private sector 
and MFI holdings of debt securities issued by the euro area private n
on-MFI sector. 
As such, it also covers the Eurosystem™s purchases of 
non
-MFI 
debt securities under 
the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). 
The
 persistent contraction in 
MFIs™ longer
-term financial liabilities (excluding capital and reserves)
 contri
buted 
positively to M3 growth 
(included alongside other counterparts in
 the dark green 
portion of
 the 
bars in 
Chart 2
1). The
 annual rate of change 
of such liabilities 
has 
been negative since the second quarter of 2012, partly owing to the impact of the 
ECB™s targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO
-II), which may be acting 
as a substitute for longer
-term market
-based bank funding. Finally, government bond 
sales from euro area MFIs excluding the Eurosystem contributed to the negative 
annual grow
th of credit to general government by MFIs excluding the Eurosystem 
and thus dampened M3 growth (see the light green 
portion
 of 
the 
bars in 
Chart 2
1). Chart 2

-related sales of euro area government bonds by 
non-residents, have declined over recent months. This has
 mitigated the related 
downward pressure on M3 growth. The decline in the negative contribution from net 
external assets came to a halt in October. Non
-residents, while remaining among the 
main sellers of securities eligible for the asset purchase programm
e (APP), may 
have moderated the rebalancing of their portfolios towards other euro area assets.
 The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector, observed since the 
beginning of 2014, has continued.
 The annual growth rate of MFI loans to the 
private sector (adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling) was 
broadly stable in the third quarter of 2017 and increased in October (see Chart 20). 
Across sectors, the annual growth of loa
ns to non
-financial corporations increased to 
2.9% in October, from 2.3% in the third quarter (see Chart 22). The growth of loans to 
NFCs has recovered significantly from the trough in the first quarter of 2014 and the 
cross
-country dispersion of NFC loan 
developments has declined overall. At the same 
time, heterogeneity in loan growth across the four largest euro area countries 
increased somewhat in October 2017. The annual growth rate of loans to households 
remained broadly stable, standing at 2.7% in Oct
ober (see Chart 23). The significant 
decrease in bank lending rates seen across the euro area since summer 2014 (notably 
owing to the ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy measures) and overall 
improvements in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans have su
pported these 
trends. In addition, banks have made progress in consolidating their balance sheets 
and reducing non
-performing loans, although the level of non
-performing loans 
remains high in some countries and may constrain financial intermediation.

redeemable at notice, weighted by their corresponding outstanding amounts. The latest observation is 
for 
October
 2017.
 Bank lending rates for NFCs remained at historically low levels (see Chart 25).
 The c
omposite bank lending rate for NFCs declined
 further
 to a historical low in the 
third quarter of 2017, where it remained in October. As regards loans to households 
for house purchase, the moderate increase in the c
omposite bank lending rate for
 this loan category up to August 2017, from a historical low of 
1.78% in December 
2016, softened in September and October 2017 (see Chart 26). 
Overall, composite 
bank lending rates for loans to NFCs and households have decreased by 
significantly more than market reference rates since the ECB™s credit easing 
measures 
we
re announced in June 2014
. This signals 
an improvement in the pass
-through of monetary policy measures to bank lending rates. The aforementioned 
decrease in banks™ composite funding costs has supported the decline in composite 
lending rates. Between May 20
14 and 
October
 2017, composite lending rates on 
loans to NFCs and 
on loans to 
households fell by 1
20 basis points and 103 basis 
points respectively. The reduction in bank lending rates on NFC loans was 
particularly strong in vulnerable euro area countries,
 supporting a more 
homogeneous transmission of monetary policy to such rates across countries. Over 
the same period, the spread between interest rates charged on very small loans 
(loans of up to •0.25 million) and those charged on large loans 
(loans of abo
ve •1 
million)
 in the euro area narrowed considerably and stood close to its historical low in 
October
 2017. This indicates that small and medium
-sized enterprises have 
generally benefited to a greater extent from the decline in bank lending rates than 
lar
ge companies.

high

 Net issuance of debt securities by NFCs increased in the third quarter of 2017.
 The increase 
in net issuance 
was concentrated in July
, 
while in
 August
 and September 
issuance 
was subdued. 
Market data 
point to
 robust

 In the December 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections,
 the euro area 
budget deficit is 
foreseen
 to 
decline
 further 
over the projection horizon (2017
-20), 
mainly as a result of improving cyclical conditions and decreasing interest payments. 
The ag
gregate fiscal stance for the euro area is projected to be 
broadly neutral
. The 
euro area government debt
-to
-GDP ratio
 is expected to
 continue to decline
, albeit 
from a still high level.
 In particular
, countries with high debt levels 
require
 additional 
consolidation efforts to set their public debt ratio firmly on a downward path
 and to 
rebuild fiscal buffers
. The euro area general government budget deficit is projected to decline 
gradually over the projection horizon.
 Based on the 
December
 2017 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic projections
,5 the general government deficit ratio for the euro 
area is expected to 
fall from 1.5% of GDP 
in 2016 to 0.
5% of GDP in 20
20 (see 
Table
 1). The 
expected 
improvement
 in the fiscal outlook, which is broadly 
unch
anged from the September 2017 projections, 
is mainly 
driven by favourable 
cyclical conditions
 and declining
 interest payments.
 While the draft budgetary plans 
for 201
8, which the euro area countries submitted in mid
-October
 2017, foresee 
additional consoli
dation efforts 
by some countries, 
this
 is not necessarily fully 
reflected in
 the projections, as the
y only 
include measures that have already been 
adopted or
 are close to being adopted by 
the respective 
parliament
s. For further 
details on the draft budgeta
ry plans, see the box entitled ﬁ
An assessment of the 
review of draft budgetary plans based on the 2018 exercise
ﬂ in this issue of the 
Economic Bulletin.
 The euro area fiscal stance is projected to be broadly neutral over 
the projection horizon.
6 Euro area 
government debt levels are expected to continue falling from their 
high levels.
 The euro area debt
-to
-GDP ratio, which peaked in 2014, 
is projected to 
decline from 88.9% of GDP in 2016 to 80.7% of GDP by the end of 2020
. Th
e decline
 is driven
 mainly 
by 
a positive and rising primary surplus and a 
favourable 
interest rate
-growth 
rate 
differential, 
the latter reflecting the generally stable
 macroeconomic outlook
. The debt ratio is slightly lower compared with 
the 
September
 2017 exercise, mainly reflecting a mo
re favourable interest
-rate growth 
rate differential. Debt ratios are 
projected to 
improve
 in 
most
 euro area countries, 
while in 
a few countries the government debt ratio is expected to increase over the 
projection horizon. 
In 
the case of high
-debt countri
es in particular
, further 
consolidation efforts in full compliance with the
 Stability and Growth Pact are 
essential to set the public debt
-to
-GDP ratio firmly on
 a downward path
. Rebuilding 
fiscal buffers would make countries less
 vulnerable
 to any renewed
 financial market 
instability or a rapid rebound in interest rates.

the 
December 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area
. 6  The fiscal stance reflects the direction and size of the stimulus from fiscal policies on the economy, 
beyond the automatic 
reaction of public finances to the business cycle. It is measured as the change in 
the structural primary balance, i.e. the cyclically adjusted primary balance ratio net of temporary 
measures, such as government support for the financial sector. For more d

 1 What is driving metal prices?
 Prepared b
y Irma Alonso Álvarez
 and 
Frauke Skudelny
 Understanding the 
factors 
behind metal 
prices 
is important
 to 
the 
assess
ment of
 their 
implications for 
euro area prices
. 
This bo
x analyses the drivers of metal price 
developments since 1998, with a particular focus on the surge in metal prices 
between June and September 2017, a period in which aluminium, copper and iron 
ore prices simultaneously increased by around 10%.
 While 
attra
cting 
less attention 
than 
oil prices, metal prices 
have 
also 
been 
fluctuat
ing
 strongly since 
the 
end
 of 
2003. Metal prices were relatively stable 
between 
1995 and the 
end of 
2003, 
then 
increased strongly until 
the middle of 
2011 
(apart from 
a dip during 
the global recession
), 
then 
declined until early 2016
, after 
which they 
started 
rising 
again
 (see Chart A)
. 
Prices 
were about 75% higher in 
September 2017 
than in 
1995, 
led 
by iron ore and copper
, while aluminium prices 
remained more stable over 
this

 Notes:
 The metal index includes aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, steel scrap, tin, zinc and iron ore. The weights are based on impor

into euro area 
countries (see 
Chart B)
. Reflecting buoyant economic growth over the last decade,
 China has become 
a dominant pl
ayer in terms of its share in the consumption of metals and, for 
some metals, also in terms of productio
n (see Chart B)
. China consumes about 
50 to 60% of world metals and 
accounts for 
around 50% of world aluminium 
production 
and 35% of

. Notes: In panel (a), aluminium 
and copper data come from the World Bureau of Metal Statistics (WBMS) and reflect primary production and refined production, 
respectively. Iron ore 
data are based on mine production of usable iron ore from the
 United States Geological Survey (USGC
). In pan
el (b), the same sources of data are used for consumption. I
ron ore
 consumption
 is not available for 2016 and is substituted by 2015 data
.  While demand factors 
have been 
a key determinant of metal 
price 
fluctuations 
over the last two decades, model
-based 
estimates suggest that the recent 
surge in metal prices 
was 
also driven by supply factors
. To disentangle the main 
factors behind the 
surge
, a dynamic factor model on a large panel of energy and 
non-energy prices, 
as 
developed by Delle Chiaie, Ferrara and 
Giannone (2017)
,7 is used
. This approach assumes that commodity
-specific shocks
, such as supply 
shocks in individual commodity markets
, tend to be idiosyncratic and hence average 
out when considering a large cross
-section of commodity prices. By contrast, 
sustained changes in the common component (the global factor) tend to be 
indicative of demand shifts driven by the global business cycle. The global (demand) 
factor captures a large share of metal price fluctuations and has 
been of great 
importance 
since t
he beginning of the 2000s
, largely owing to the increasing 
importance of China (see Chart C)
. However, when looking at the more recent 
period, the simultaneous increase in all three metal prices by around 10% 
between 
June 
and September 2017 
was mainly driv
en by the commodity
-specific 
components
, which should reflect supply factors 
as 
captured by idiosyncratic and 
block
-specific contributions
 (see Chart D)
. Increasing global demand also played a 
role, 
although to a lesser extent than supply.

 These results are consistent with developments in the metal markets over this 
period
. Copper production declined in Chile and Peru 
owing 
to weather conditions 
and strikes in some mines, while supply shortfalls in Australia and Brazil supported 
higher iron ore quotations. Aluminium prices also increased on account of strong 
global 
demand a
nd China™s 
policy 
of 
reduc
ing
 overproduction and pollution through 
the shutdown of 
factories
. 
Since the beginning of October 2017, metal prices have 
increased 
slightly 
(by around 2%), primarily owing to iron ore dynamics. Iron ore 
prices rose on account of
 increasing demand for high
-grade iron ore
 in the aftermath 
of a restructuring of the steel industry in China
, affected
 by 
the implementation of 
environmental reforms.

 Notes: The historical decomposition for iron ore should be treated with caution owing to concerns about the quality of the se
ries. Iron 
ore 
prices start only from 1995, and until 2010 most iron ore prices were traded using an annual benchmark price negotiation.
 Despite recent increase
s in metal prices, most forecasts for copper, aluminium 
and iron
 ore 
predict 
a stabilisation or a decline in pr
ice
s. While futures 
markets 
suggest a stabilisation of metal prices, Consensus 
Economics 
forecasts point to a 
decline, by around 7% 
by 
mid
-2019, as 
increased 
demand is expected to be offset 
by increases in supply. World Bank projections
 indicate that
 the d
rop in metal prices 
will be 
somewhat stronger, with iron ore prices 
expected 
to decline by around 30% 
by 
late 2019. Copper and aluminium prices are also expected to 
fall, 
by around 11%. 
China will 
probably 
play an important role in the evolution of metal p
rices, as the 
tightening of metal markets is largely 
influenced 
by China™s environmental and safety 
polic
ies
 and the growth in demand for 
metal
s, with a stronger effect on iron ore than 
on copper and aluminium
. Upside risks to these forecasts include unexp
ected supply 
outages, while downside risks 
relate 
to slower
-than
-anticipated demand 
growth in 
China and an easing of production restrictions on China™s heavy industries.
 Developments in
 metal 
prices play a
 role in the assessment of the outlook for 
euro are
a inflation and the risks to price stability in the medium term.
 Metal 
pric
e fluctuations affect inflation
 mainly via 
their
 impact on the production and 
distribution chain
, since 
the share of 
metal in consumption is rather small. Moreover, 
as they mostly 
affect industry
, while having very little impact on services, their impact 
is more relevant for countries with a large industrial sector than fo
r service
-oriented 
economies. Compared to the impact of oil, the effect of metal prices on inflation is 
small, a
s they do not have a direct effect via HICP energy prices. Some estimates 
suggest that a 10% drop in industrial raw material prices results in 0.15% lower euro 
area HICP excluding energy and unprocessed food over a three
-year horizon.

autonomous factors
, which implies absorption of 
liquidity, mainly resulted from a decrease in the liquidity
-providing factors.
 The 
main contri
bution came from net foreign assets, which fell by •33.0 billion to •637.0 
billion on average in the period under review. 
Average net assets denominated in 
euro also decreased, by 
•26.3 billion compared with the previous review period, 
to 
•306.1
 billion
. Liquidity
-absorbing 
autonomous factors
 also decreased 
over the review 
period
, counteracting to some extent developments in l
iquidity
-providing 
autonomous factors
. The main contribution came from o
ther autonomous factors
, 
which fell by 
•30.1 billion 
to •
690.3 billion. Increases in banknotes in circulation and 
government deposits, by 
•11.5 billion and 
•3.4 billion
 respectively
, had a 
counterbalancing effect on the level of liquidity
-absorbing autonomous factors.
 The volatility of autonomous factors remained el
evated 
and 
broadly 
unchanged from the previous review period.
 The 
volatility primarily reflected 
fluctuations in government deposits and net assets denominated in euro.

2017 and a low of 
-0.3

 In the secured market, average overnight repo rates in the GC Pooling market 
declined slightly
 for both the standard 
collateral basket and the extended collateral 
basket relative to the previous review period.
 The overnight repo rate stood at 
-0.437% for the standard collateral basket, while for the extended collateral basket 
the average overnight repo stood at 
-0.402%.
 The September 2017 quarter

 to 
that 
observed 
in June 2017,
 was relatively mild compared to the 2016 year

 44 3 The recent strength
 of 
survey
-based indicator
s: what 
does it tell us about 
the depth and breadth of 
real GDP 
growth?
 Prepared b
y Gabe de Bondt
 and 
Magnus Forsells
 Recent 
opinion surveys
 point to a solid increase in real GDP
, 
which 
rais
es the 
question
 whether this strong growth dynamic can be expected to continue.
 For 
example, ﬁs
oftﬂ data from the two most prominent surveys for the euro area
 Œ the 
European Commission
™s business and 
consumer 
surveys and the IHS Markit 
PMI 
(PMI refers to 
Purchasing Managers
™ Index
) Œ have
 lately 
shown
 a remarkable 
strength
, which appears to indicate 
that the euro area economy is growing solidly
. 
Both 
of these 
surveys are closely monitored by analysts and policymakers because 
they are 
considered a 
timely and often unique 
indicator 
of economic developments
: survey results 
are released on a monthly basis
 (from 
the third week of the reference 
month
 onwards)
, while the preliminary flash GDP estimate is 
published 
only 30 days 
after the end of the reference quarter. This box focuses on 
a key 
data 
series from 
each survey, i.e. the 
Economic Sentiment Indicator 
(ESI) and the 
composite output 
PMI, 
as the two indicators involved 
are typically best
 correlated 
to 
developments in 
real GDP.
 The ESI and the composite output PMI are both useful for gauging movements 
in real GDP, but feature methodological differences.
 The European 
Commission
™s surveys have a broad coverage in terms of countries (all euro area 
countries 
are covered 
except Ireland), sectors, questions and sample size (
it 
comprises 
75,000 private sector companies and 26
,000 consumers). 
A detailed 
picture of 
economic developments
 can thus be obtained
. As part of 
these 
surveys, 
the ESI 
includes
 confidence indicators for five sectors
, with 
each 
one encompassing 
an average of two to four sub
-questions. Some of the questions 
are 
relate
d to 
orders
, expected product
ion/demand or employment and
, as such
, are 
of a forward
-looking nature. The weights underlying the ESI are fixed
 as follows: 
industry 
at 
40%, 
services 
at 
30%, consumer
 (household) at 
20%, 
and both 
retail trade and 
construction 
at 
5%.
9 However, f
inancial services are not included in the ESI. This is a 
shortcoming because the financial sector affects real GDP and developments in this 
sector can be very different 
to those in 
the rest of the economy
, as seen during the 
financial crisis.
 The composite
 output PMI is derived from replies to a question on month
-on-month 
output changes with three possible responses: ﬁupﬂ, ﬁunchangedﬂ or ﬁdownﬂ.
 It 
applies 
a weight of 65% for services
-related
 activity (
covers
 2,000 private sector 
companies from the 
four 
lar
gest euro area countries and Ireland)
, with
 the remaining 
35% 
assigned to 
manufacturing output (
covers 
3,000 companies at the country level
, 
                                                                    9  See Gelper, S. and Croux, C., ﬁOn the Construction of the European Economic Sentiment Indicatorﬂ,

 45 including 
from the Netherlands, Austria and Greece). Important sectors are thus 
missing, 
e.g.
 public services and n
on-manufacturing industry
 (mainly construction
). The ESI and the composite output PMI suggest that the euro area economy 
continued to grow strongly in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 As illustrated in 
Chart
 A, the ESI is constructed to track contemporaneous 
movements in 
year
-on-year real 
GDP.
10 The close c
orrelation between the ESI and year
-on-year real GDP 
indicates 
a continued solid economic expansion in the fourth quarter. Part of the recently 
observed discrepancy between the ESI and year
-on-year growth can b
e explained 
by the fact that 
the recent upswing in the ESI 
is largely 
relate
d to 
the 
forward
-looking 
components underlying 
it.
 Thus, the recent 
improvement in
 the ESI may also 
point to 
solid developm
ents beyond the fourth quarter.

 The ESI suggests that there will be a continued, unabated increase in real GDP 
across the euro area over the near term, with most countries experiencing this 
trend.
 Given the extent of its coverage, the ESI is more suitable for taking a closer 
look at the country and sectoral dimensions. 
The latest
 ESI 
results, which are for 
November
 2017 (see the red 
dots
 in Chart
 C), show that the indicator 
is above its 
long
-term average
 (represented by the zero line)
 for all euro area countries except 
Greece. Moreover, in all countries, ex
cluding 
the three Baltic 
States
, Belgium, 
Slovakia and Greec
e, the ESI is currently more than one standard deviation above 
its average
 level
. The
 ESI reached its historical maximum 
in Malta and Cyprus
 in 
November (as indicated by the position of the red dots at the top of the blue bars)
.                                                                     11  See

 A broadly positive picture also emerges at the sectoral level, with high levels 
of confidence being registered in most sectors across the euro area.
 At the 
sectoral level, in November 2017 the c
onfidence indicators underlying the ESI 
were
 at a record high for manufacturing and close to an all
-time high for the household 
(consumer) 
sector, retail trade and construction (see Chart
 D). T
he latter sector
, in 
particular,
 displayed
 a remarkable cyclical upswing
. In contrast, the latest 
results for 
the 
services 
sector 
were comparatively weak, 
though
 still above 
its 
long
-term 
average
 as well as the previous peak registered in 2011
. 
These sectoral differences 
are economically important. For example, aggregating 
the European Commission™s 
ser
vices and industr
y confidence 
indicators 
Œ using the 
composite output 
PMI
™s sectoral weights (65% for services and 35% for industry)
 Œ would 
yield a 
substantially lower estimate for year
-on-year real GDP growth for the fourth quarter 
of this year than 
that
 implied by the ESI 
(illustrated in Chart
 A). 
Overall, t
he sectoral 
readings suggest that all sectors
 are

 49 4 What 
can we learn from the ECB Survey of Professional 
Forecasters
 about perceptions of
 labour market dynamics
 in the euro area
? Prepared b
y Rupert de Vincent
-Humphreys
 and 
Friderike Kuik
 Over the last ten years labour markets in the euro area have been subject to a 
number of shocks, leading to large 
fluctuations in the unemployment rate and 
pay growth.
 In response to these developments, professional forecasters have been 
repeatedly adjusting their expectations for the unemployment rate and annual growth 
in compensation per employee (hereafter referred
 to as wage growth), both upwards 
and downwards. This 
box 
examines the revisions to the expectations reported in the 
ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), and how those expectations 
compare with the actual data outturns.
 Between 2008 and 2013 the e
conomic setbacks associated with the financial 
and sovereign debt crises led participants in the SPF gradually to adjust their 
expectations for the unemployment rate upwards and those for wage growth 
downwards (see Charts A and B).
 This is in line with 
the
 traditional 
notion 
of 
unemployment as the driver of labour market slack and, in turn, quantity
-price 
dynamics in the labour market: 
the more 
unemployed 
workers there are competing 
for jobs, the lower the wages that firms need to offer to recruit or retain
 workers. 
This 
co-movement was also visible in the opposite direction during the temporary 
recovery of 2010
-11, when shorter
-term wage growth expectations were revised 
upwards at the same time that labour market slack was projected to diminish (as 
indicate
d by the narrowing gap between shorter
-term and longer
-term unemployment 
rate expectations).
 In 2013, howev
er, a different picture emerged, with
 expectations 
for 
both 
the 
unemployment rate and wage growth 
successively revised downwards.

 Wage growth expectations
 (annual percentage changes)
  Sources: SPF and ECB staff calculations.
 Up until 2013, SPF projection errors tended to mirror those for 
unemployment: 
episodes of weaker
-than
-expected wage growth coincided with a higher
-than
-expected unemployment rate and vice versa (see Chart
 C).
12 After 2013, 
however, not only did the pattern of revisions to unemployment and wage growth 
forecasts change, 
but so did the pattern of projection errors. Both wage growth and 
the unemployment rate were jointly overestimated by the SPF
 over the period 2013
-15, a constellation of errors which seems unusual relative to the survey™s earlier 
history. Moreover, this pa
ttern was not only seen in the average forecasts reported 
by the SPF, but also for the large majority of individual forecasters. 
The 
whiskers
 on Chart
 C illustrate the spread of individual forecast errors (calculated as the
 interquartile 
range). 
Over the p
eriod 2013
-15 these whiskers lie mostly 
below the 
zero line, 
which 
indicate
s that a large majority of respondents overestimated both 
wage
 growth
 and unemployment.

 Notes: The projection horizon is the next calendar year; the date indicated refers to the survey date. The chart shows the me
dian and 
interquartile range of the SPF forecast microdata. Projection errors a
re defined as the outturn, according to the most recent data, 
minus the expectation. The latest compensation per employee data refer to the third quarter of 2017. The latest SPF expectati
ons for 
the next
-calendar
-year horizon which can be definitively eval
uated are those for the year 2016, from surveys carried out in 2015. 
However, this chart also presents an indicative assessment of expectations from 2016 surveys for 2017, on the assumption that
 the 
data for the final quarter are in line with the Eurosyste
m staff macroeconomic projections for December. The pattern of unemployment 
and wage growth projection errors for 
the calendar
-year
-after
-next horizon (collected only in third and fourth quarter surveys until 
2013) is similar.
 This historically unusual pat
tern of forecast errors since 2013 may suggest a 
structural break in labour market dynamics in the euro area.
 Specifically, the 
pattern suggests that even though the amount of slack in the labour market (as 
measured by unemployment) turned out to be less t
han expected, other factors were 
keeping wage growth subdued. Such factors could include: increased wage 
flexibility, in view of the depth of the crisis and following structural reforms in labour 
markets; a larger increase in low productivity jobs; and eff
ects arising from the low 
inflation environment.
13 This pattern may also signal that, at the current juncture, the 
unemployment rate underestimates the total amount of slack in the labour market. 
For example, an elevated proportion of part
-time workers who 
want to increase their 
hours or of marginally attached workers may have allowed employment to expand 
without generating significant wage inflation. This is consistent with the findings of 
the survey for the second quarter of 2017: when posed a question on 
perceived risks 
to wage developments, respondents emphasised the uncertainty around the 
response of wages to slack, and the risk that wage growth could turn out weaker 
than expected, if marginally attached workers re
-entered the labour market as the 
econom
ic recovery progressed.
 However, the influence of factors behind recent unusual labour market 
developments may already be waning.
 Expectations for wage growth have been 
picking up in 2017 at all forecast horizons. In particular, the latest SPF (for the fou
rth 
quarter of 2017) shows that expectations for wage growth in the longer term have 
now recovered over half of the decline experienced over the period 2013
-16 (see 
Chart B). This in turn may suggest that the factors which have been holding down 
wage growt
h are now perceived to be weakening.

draft budgetary plans 
based on the 
201
8 exercise
 Prepared b
y Stephan Haroutunian, Sebastian Hauptmeier and Nadine 
Leiner

 On 22
 November 2017 the European Commission released its
 opinions on the 
draft budgetary plans of euro area governments for 2018, together with an 
analysis of the budgetary situation in the euro area as a whole.
 Each
 opinion 
include
s an assessment of
 the compliance of
 the 
relevant 
plan with the Stability and 
Growth Pact (SGP). 
It
 also follow
s up on the guidance provided in the country
-specific recommendations for fiscal policies under the 201
7 European Semester, as 
adopted by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council on 
11 July 201
7.14 In general, the draft budg
etary plans envisage broadly neutral support of the 
euro area economy by fiscal policies, but with considerable divergence 
between countries.
 Some 
member 
countries
 have reached their 
medium
-term 
budgetary objectives (
MTOs
) and several of them 
are using the
ir room for 
manoeuvre under the EU™s fiscal rules.
 In contrast, structural efforts in 
a considerable
 number 
of member countries
 are falling short of SGP commitments
, despite the solid and broad
-based economic expansion in the euro area
. 
In its 
statement on
 4 December 2017 on the draft budgetary plans for 2018, the Eurogroup 
concluded that ﬁa broadly neutral fiscal stance appears still appropriate at the 
aggregate euro area level in 2018ﬂ.
15 This is 
also in keeping
 with the view that whe
n the output gap is sm
all, fine
-tuning of support 
of the macroeconomy by
 fiscal policies 
is not warranted
.16 The Eurogroup also noted that ﬁat the same time, the improving 
economic conditions call for the need to rebuild fiscal buffers, while continuing to 
strengthen the economi
es™ growth potentialﬂ.
 Based on its 2017 autumn economic forecast, the Commission finds that only 
six of the eighteen draft budgetary plans are fully compliant with the SGP.
17 This 
refers to the plans
 of Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands 
and Finland (all under the 
SGP™s 
preventive arm)
, and is one more than the number 
of countries whose plans were found to be fully compliant last year. T
he Commission 
considers that
 the 
draft budget
ary plans 
of a further six
 countries 
are
 only ﬁbroadly 
                                                                    14  For background and further detail, see the box entitled ﬁCountry

policies under the 2017 European Semesterﬂ, 
Economic Bulletin
, Issue
 4, ECB, June 2017.
 15  See 
Eurogroup statement on the Draft Budgetary Plans for 2018
. 16  The concept of the aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is important 
in the
 context of 
Economic 
and 
Monetary 
Union
, where a single monetary policy is complemented by fiscal policies that are 
conducted at the national level. It is, however, not a legally binding concept. For a discussion of the 
difficulties surrounding the assessm
ent of the fiscal stance, see the article entitled ﬁThe euro area fiscal 
stanceﬂ,

18 This 
refers to the plans of
 Estonia, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta

 under 
the
 corrective arm. While 
the 
headline deficit 
of 
Spain
, whi
ch had submitted a draft budgetary plan on a no
-policy
-change basis
, 
is forecast to fall below the 3% of GDP deficit reference value 
by the 201
8 deadline
 under the excessive deficit procedure (EDP),
 this is associated 
with
 cumulated shortfalls in structura
l efforts 
relative to
 commitments under the 
SGP.
19 The draft budgetary plans of the six remaining countries are considered to 
pose a ﬁrisk of non
-compliance with the SGPﬂ.
20 This refers to
 the plans of France 
Œ with 
an EDP deadline in 201
7 Œ under the SGP™s 
corrective arm,
 and, u
nder 
its
 preventive arm,
 to
 Belgium, Italy, 
Austria, Portugal and 
Slovenia
 (Austria having 
submitted its plan on a no
-policy
-change basis in the absence of a sworn
-in 
government)
.  Debt ratios are falling only slowly in countries with
 high government debt.
 Among the group of the six countries whose draft budgetary plans pose risks of non
-compliance with the SGP, Belgium, France, Italy and Portugal are projected to record 
high government debt ratios of above 90% of GDP in 2018 (see the 
chart). With the 
exception of Portugal, these countries are not expected to reduce government debt 
towards the reference value of 60% of GDP in line with the SGP™s debt rule. In its 
statement on 4
 December 2017, the Eurogroup noted that ﬁa slow pace of deb
t 
reduction from high levels in a number of Member States remains a matter for 
concernﬂ. 
In the case of Italy, the 
letter sent by the 
Commission on 22
 November 
2017 states that 
ﬁinsufficient progress towards compliance with the debt criterion
ﬂ has been made, 
and that ﬁItaly™s public debt remains a key vulnerabilityﬂ.
21 At the 
same time, the Commission 
has still 
not issue
d a report under Article
 126(3)
 of the 
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) based on notified data for 
2016.                                                                     18  For countries 
subject to
 the SGP™s preventive arm, draft budgetary plans are ﬁbroadl
y compliantﬂ if, 
according to the Commission™s forecast, the plan may result in some deviation from the MTO or the 
adjustment path towards it, but the shortfall relative to the requirement would not represent a significant 
deviation from the required adjus
tment. Deviations from the fiscal targets under the preventive arm are 
classified as ﬁsignificantﬂ if they exceed 0.5% of GDP in one year or, on average, 0.25% of GDP in two 
consecutive years. For countries subject to the SGP™s corrective arm, the Commissi
on assesses draft 
budgetary plans as being ﬁbroadly compliantﬂ if their forecast projects that the headline deficit targets 
will be achieved but there is a noticeable shortfall in fiscal effort compared with the recommended 
value, putting at risk complianc
e with the EDP recommendation.
 19  According to the European Commission™s 2017 autumn economic forecast, 
no
 structural effort is 
forecast 
in 2018, whereas 
a structural effort of 
0.5% of GDP is
 specified in
 the EDP recommendation 
that the Council issued to Spain 
in 2016 
under Article
 126(9)
 of the 
Treaty on the 
Functioning of the 
European 
Union
. 20  For countries 
subject to
 the SGP™s preventive arm, the Commission assesses 
a 
draft budgetary plan as 
being ﬁat 
risk of non
-compliance with the SGPﬂ if it
 forecast
s a significant deviation from the MTO or the 
required adjustment path towards the MTO in 2018, and/or non
-compliance with the debt reduction 
benchmark
, where 
that benchmark is 
applicable. For countries su
bject to the SGP™s corrective arm, the 
Commission assesses 
a draft budgetary plan
 as being ﬁat risk of non
-compliance
 with the SGP
ﬂ if 
its
 forecast for 2018, subject to ex post confirmation, could lead to the stepping up of the EDP, as neither 
the recommen
ded fiscal effort nor the recommended headline deficit target are forecast to be achieved.

  Sources: AMECO and country
-specific recommendations for fiscal policies as adopted by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council 
on 11 July 2017.
 Notes:
 Germany, Estonia, Cyprus, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands are recommended to remain at their MTOs. For 
Austria and Finland
, the structural effort requirements are lower than those specified in their respective country
-specific 
recommendations when corrected for 
flexibility 
granted 
under the SGP (notably 
in the areas of hosting refugees, 
structural reforms, 
investment and pens
ions). 
For Italy and Slovenia, the structural effort requirements may be reduced by way of applying discretion.
 By way of 
applying 
discretion, the Commission recommends 
that
 the 2018 
structural adjustment requirements under the Stability and Growth Pact fo
r Italy and Slovenia
 be significantly reduced
.22 For countries with structural effort 
requirements 
in 2018 
of 0.5% of GDP and
 higher
, the recitals to the Council
™s 2017
 recommendations
 on the member states™ economic, employment and fiscal policies
 issued on
 11 July 2017
 indicate
d that 
upcoming 
assessment
s would
 ﬁtake due 
account of the goal of achieving a fiscal stance that contributes to both 
strengthening 
the ongoing recovery and e
nsuring the sustainability of [–
] public finances.ﬂ 
On this 
basis, the Commission recommends a reduction in 
the 
structural effort 
requirements 
applicable to
 Italy 
from 0.6% to 0.3% of GDP, 
and a reduction in those applicable to 
Slovenia
 from 1.0% to 0.6% of GDP.
23 Generally, for the credibility of the SGP, 
predictability and transparency in the application of its fiscal rules are important.
24 Notwithstanding the reduced requirements, neither country is forecast to comply fully 
with the SGP™s preventive arm next year, according to the Commission™s 2017 
autumn f
orecast.
 The exercise of reviewing draft budgetary plans appears to have lost 
effectiveness over time.
 Introduced in response to the crisis, the review of draft 
budgetary plans was intended to provide a means of identifying and preventing 
                                                                    22  For further

 55 potential deviati
ons from sound fiscal policies early in the budgetary process, i.e. 
before budgets are finalised. Where
 a risk of particularly serious non
-compliance 
with the provisions of the SGP
 is identified 
Œ that is, where a plan in fact envisages 
structural efforts 
that fall clearly short of requirements 
Œ the Commission can ask the 
relevant member country to provide an updated budgetary plan. The Commission 
has not made any such requests 
since the start of the first review exercise in 
autumn
 2013, 
stat
ing
 that the 
ﬁparticularly serious non
-compliance
ﬂ criterion
 has 
not 
been satisfied in any particular case.
25 However, the Commission has written to those 
countries planning considerable shortfalls relative to SGP requirements, requesting
 that additional measures be take
n. Early in the 
history of the 
review exercise, 
particularly in 2014,
 certain countries publicly committed themselves to following up 
on such requests.
26 By contrast, in the context of the current review, none of the 
countries planning for shortfalls in fis
cal efforts in 2018 have responded by taking 
additional measures.
27 Moreover, in previous years, certain countries whose draft 
budgetary plans had posed risks of non
-compliance with the SGP based on the 
Commission™s forecast had committed to ﬁ
implementing t
he measures 
necessary to 
ensure that the [–
] budget will be compliant with the SGP
ﬂ, based on a quantification 
of consolidation gaps relative to SGP commitments.
28 However, this year, in its 
statement on the draft budgetary plans for 2018, the Eurogroup mer
ely invites the 
countries concerned ﬁto consider in a timely manner the necessary measures to 
address the risks identified by the Commission to ensure that their 2018 budgets will 
be compliant with the SGP provisions.ﬂ It should also be noted that, unlike 
in 
previous years, no follow
-up to the current review exercise based on the 
Commission™s winter forecast appears to be envisaged in the Eurogroup in early 
2018. Since the start of the draft budgetary plan review exercise in autumn 2013, the 
proportion of c
ountries that have submitted draft budgetary plans compliant with the 
SGP has remained unchanged at around one
-third, despite the improving economic 
conditions.
29 Looking ahead, it 
is 
crucial 
that 
the draft budgetary plan review
 exercise 
is 
again made 
more 
effective.
 Generally, the extent to which the draft budgetary plan 
review has incentivised countries to include additional measures in their final 
budgets is difficult to assess.
30 Governments may take additional measures during 
the finalisation of the budg
et or during its implementation throughout the year, 
without linking them specifically to the outcome of the review exercise. Moreover, the 
assessment of whether countries have complied with the SGP in a particular year is 
                                                                    25  This included cases in which the improvement in the structural balance towards the country
-specific 
MTO was forecast to fall significantly short of requirements, i.e. by more than 0.5 percentage point of 
GDP. This is the threshold for the signific
ant deviation procedure under the SGP™s preventive arm.
 26  For example, the Commission sent letters to Italy, Austria and France in October 2014. It had 
previously requested additional measures from Austria in May 2014, when the Austrian government 
after t
he Parliamentary elections had submitted a (non
-compliant) updated draft budgetary plan for 
2014.
 27  In October 2017 the Commission wrote to Belgium, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal.
 28  See the 
Eurogroup statement of 5 December 2016

 An assessment of the review of draft budgetary plans based on the 2018 exercise
 56 based on outturn data and is only
 taken around 18 months or more after the start of 
the draft budgetary plan review. By that time, changes in the estimates regarding a 
country™s position in the cycle, as well as amendments to the rules, may potentially 
result in a more favourable assessme
nt of compliance with the SGP.
31 One way in 
which a country™s compliance with the SGP can be improved is by requesting 
updated plans in all cases where significant deviations from requirements are 
envisaged. Enhancing the functioning of the draft budgetary

 US 
shale 
oil production has 
expanded
 greatly s
ince 2011
, 
and now 
rival
s that of 
Russia and Saudi Arabia in terms of 
market
 share. However
, major 
producers of 
conventional 
oil
, and members of the Organization of Petroleum Exp
orting Countries 
(OPEC
) in particular, 
have been slow to
 adapt their production policies. This article
 investigates the reasons for this delayed reaction and 
provides 
an assessment of the 
relative importance of 
supply and 
demand factors in driving oil pric
e developments in 
the 
wake
 of the 
shale oil
 ﬁrevolutionﬂ. S
hale oil 
is the key novel factor 
affecting the 
structure of the oil market and i
nfluencing OPEC
™s decisions whether to target price 
stabili
sation
 or market share. 
The prolonged period of oversupply
 and low oil prices 
between the end of 
2014 and the third quarter of 2016 was a result of the interplay of 
these factors; t
he partial recovery in
 prices,
 which occurred in
 2017, reflects a 
gradual rebalan
cing of the market following
 the global supply restr
aint
 agreed by 
OPEC and major non
-OPEC producers
. 
Analysts 
expect 
oil prices 
to remain in a 
range consistent with the production costs o
f the major marginal producers 
Œ currently assessed to be around 
USD
 50 per barrel over the short term. H
owever
, 
according to their projections, and given current extraction technology, 
prices
 must 
rise to around 
USD
 65-70 per barrel over the medium
 term
 if 
shale
 oil 
production 
is to
 continue
 expanding 
profitably 
at 
a robust pace.
 1 Introduction
 Commodities, 
and 
oil in particular, remain the most 
important source of 
volatil
ity
 in consumer price inflation.
 This 
poses
 a challenge for projections
, as oil 
prices account for most of the prediction errors 
in inflation rates. Understanding the 
drivers 
of oil price movement
s is fundamental 
to
 an assess
ment of
 their persistence
 and of 
the implications 
for
 inflation expectations
, as well as, 
ultimately
, to
 the ability 
to 
tailor the monetary policy response
. The surge in shale oil production since 2011 
is generally considered
 to have created 
a structural transformation of the oil market
, 
however
 several questions remain open: t
o what extent 
has that transformation so 
far
 affect
ed the 
supply and demand
 factors
 which drive the oil price; and what is its 
relevance over the longer term?
 The s
hale
 oil
 revolution has attracted 
significant
 interest 
because
 it mark
s a historical 
and 
unexpected
 turning point
 in 
US energy
 production 
trend
s. After 
three decades of steady
 decline, US oil production
 provid
ed the largest contribution 
to global supply growth 
in the period 
from 2012 to 2014
, and today 
rival
s that of 
Saudi Arabia and Russia in terms of 
its share of global oil production
. Initially
, shale 
oil was essentially a U
S phenomenon, as
 both t
echnical and legislative issues limited 
its global impact
. In particular

oil 
streams in the US, Canadian and Mexican

s were only able to absorb flows
 from the periphery 
into the 
internal
 US states
, and exports 
of 
US crude oil were 
banned by a law
 which had been 
introduced for national security reasons
. Both of these factors led to an extraordinary 
build
-up of inventory, depressing oil prices within the United States. Quality 
differentials for delivery in landlocked
 stocking points, such as the West Texas 
Intermediate (WTI) benchmark
32 (the main benchmark used in the United States) 
were priced at an increasing discount. Prices for energy products became cheaper in 
the United States than in the rest of the world. Howev
er, the subsequent 
inversion 
of 
the oil streams 
in the pipelines and 
the creation of 
additional rail capacity 
in 2014, 
combined with 
the
 repeal of the export ban
 a year later,
 served to close 
the 
gap between 
US and international 
oil prices
 and bring US 
shale
 oil into the
 global arena.
 By this point,
 the US Energy Information Administration
 (US EIA)
 had made several 
positive 
reassess
ments of 
shale oil
, in terms of 
both 
future quantities and life span, 
suggesting that permanent changes were 
occurring 
in th
e global oil market.
 OPEC
™s
 production 
decisions 
during the shale oil age 
Œ which began around 
2011 
Œ have been particularly influenced by 
the evolving 
supply conditions in 
the United States
. In November
 2014 production targets were abandoned in 
an attempt
 to regain market share
; this aim was achieved, but
 at the cost of 
a drop in oil 
prices of 
more than hal
f. 
Persistent
ly low prices and 
producer nations™ 
impaired 
public finances 
prompted
 OPEC™s decision in November
 2016 to 
change its policy 
again and
 restr
ain production, 
in an effort to
 rebalance the oil market
 which had been
 swamped 
with
 inventor

Had 
OPEC 
accepted 
the fact that 
in its
 role 
as swing 
supplier 
it was
 now 
competing
 with shale 
oil 
producers?
 This article 
describes the evolution of the oil market during the shale oil age, 
the 
shifts in OPEC
™s
 production strategies and the effects 
of both of these 
developments 
on oil prices
. It is structured as follows:
 Sections 2

price dynamics and market f

 both before and during the shale oil age, 
with a particular focus on the market shares of
 major 
oil 
producing countries (notably 
the
 United 
States) following the revolution set in motion by the shale oil industry
. Box

of the

of the global oil market used 
to assess the relevance of supply and demand factors, 
in which two types of 
strategies are distinguished

OPEC act
s to protect its market 
share (

) or to 
stabili
se oil prices around a target value
 (the

. Box 2 discusses the historical decomposition of the oil 
price, focusing on the period of shale oil production. Section 4 assesses the potential

 The oil market in the age of shale oil
 59 2 A narrative of pre
-shale oil price dynamics
 Developments in 
the oil price in the years preceding the global financial crisis 
sowed the seeds for the shale oil revolution.
 The steep rise in price 
from USD
 23 per barrel 
in 2003 to an all
-time high of USD
 145 per barrel 
on the eve of the global 
financial crisis was 
primarily a reflection of surging demand in major emerging 
economies such as China (see Charts 1 and 4). On the supply side, while non
-OPEC producers were struggling to keep up with expanding consumption, OPEC™s 
preference 
Œ according to the empirical anal
ysis 
Œ was to maintain a relatively tight 
market and exploit its renewed power to influence market equilibrium (see Chart 3).

 The oil market in the age of shale oil
 60 Against this background, capital flowed to the shale oil industry to finance 
investments in research and development.
 Medium
-sized energy companies, 
generally mor
e financially constrained than the multinationals, took advantage of 
these capital inflows to further develop horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing 
techniques 
in the United States
, making shale oil production viable and profitable. 
The development o
f shale 
oil production also benefited from the fact that resources 
were located 
in 
sparsely populated
 areas
, and that in the United States land 
ownership rights include rights to sub
-surface minerals
 and 
environmental regulation
 is less strict than in, for
 example, Europe
.33 The extraction of oil and natural gas from 
shale rock formations has had a lasting
 effect on 
the US 
energy mix
 and markedly 
reduced the United States™ dependency on 
external energy
; this has, in turn, helped 
reduce the perennial US
 trade
 deficit.
 Over the same period (2003
-2007), OPEC regained influence on the oil market 
by addressing 
increasing demand 
from fast
-developing emerging economies 
and 
stepping in to compensate for significant and protracted 
disruptions
 in 
production.
 In particular, new lows in prices in the aftermath of the Asian financial 
crisis of 1997 had restrained field investments for years, and conventional 
production, which lacked spare capacity, was unable to expand and respond to the 
growing demand from China
 and other emerging economies. The 
gap be
tween 
global demand and
 supply
 was exacerbated by two major disruptions: a
 drop of
 60% 
in Venezuelan oil production
34 caused by a 
protracted 
strike
 which took place
 at 
the 
national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela
, in late 2002 in an attempt to force the 
then
-president to call early elections; and the Second Gulf War in 2003. Given the 
general market conditions, OPEC was able to maintain a relatively tight market 
balance in order to support high oil prices during t
his period prior to the global 
financial crisis (see Box 1).
 The 
global 
financial crisis dramatically reduced economic activity and demand 
for crude oil
 and pushed prices below USD 40 per barrel in early 2009 (see 
Charts 3 and 4).
 The decline in annual con
sumption was particularly severe in the 
United States and more than offset the growth in demand in some emerging 
economies. 
However
, prices
 rebounded ahead of 
firming improvements in global 
economic conditions
, as a result of 
a very substantial production 
cut 
by OPEC of
 almost three 
million 
barrels
 per day
 that was not fully reversed
 until 2012.
 It can be 
seen that OPEC™s policies are motivated by a series of macro and micro factors as 
market conditions change; Box 1 details a possible empirical framework w
hich may 
be established to partially evaluate these factors.

 The oil market in the age of shale oil
 62 the underlying shock
.35 This 
view
 persisted 
in the literature 
until the end of the second half of 2000, 
when a
n increasing
 consensus identified global demand conditions as the key factor
 in explaining 
oil price movements in
 certain
 episodes, such as in the run
-up to
 the 2008 crisis
36. In particular
, Kilian
 and Murphy
37 show that 
both 
current and forward
-looking demand 
for
 oil 
are
 driven by 
expectations about future activity (
that is, by 
speculative demand).
 By analogy with
 Kilian and Murphy
, 
a SVAR 
model can be
 used to identify global and 
speculative demand shocks and
, specifically, to
 distin
guish
 between two supply shocks
 Œ ﬁstrategicﬂ and ﬁaccommodativeﬂ
 Œ depending on how OPEC reacts t
o non
-OPEC 
production changes.
 In 
the framework of 
this
 model
, OPEC can decide to protect its market share 
(the 
strategic
 approach
), target a desired oil price level (
the 
accommodative
 approach
), or 
adopt 
any combination of the two.
38 Using
 the 
strategic
 approach, 
OPEC production follows the same 
dynamics as 
that of 
non-OPEC producers
, amplifying the impact of the shock on oil prices
; whereas 
using
 the 
accommodative approach,
 OPEC tends to offset non
-OPEC changes in production, 
attenuating oil price fluctuat
ions. 
Shifts 
between approaches
 depend, among other factors, on the 
production capacity of competitors
. T
he rapid rise of shale 
oil 
production
 is therefore likely to
 have 
brought about changes in OPEC™s production plans
39. 
The model contains 24 lags and 
employs 
monthly data from February
 1973 to April
 2017 with the following reduced form representation:
 =+()+   is a vector of five endogenous variables including (1) the monthly percentage change in OPEC 
crude oil production, (2) the m
onthly percentage change in non
-OPEC crude oil production, (3) the 
growth rate of the interpolated global GDP, (4) the log
-real price of oil (Brent crude deflated by the 
US consumer price index), and (5) the monthly changes in global oil inventories measur
ed as 
changes in OECD crude oil stocks and in US crude oil inventories. The vector c contains the 
intercepts, A(L) is a matrix polynomial in the lag operator and 
 is a vector of reduced form error 
terms.
 The key identifying assumptions are sign 
restrictions imposed on the impact responses of 
the five variables to the structural shocks; no magnitude restriction is added

 of micro and macro factors seem to influence OPEC decisions. 
These include
 global 
demand, 
the 
internal cohe
siveness of OPEC, 
the 
fiscal needs of oil

 The oil market in the age of shale oil
 63 set 
-up rests on the ability to pin down ﬁstrategicﬂ and ﬁaccommodativeﬂ OPEC behaviour in reaction 
to non
-OPEC supp
ly shocks. If OPEC seeks to maintain its market share (the strategic approach), it 
will react to expansions in non
-OPEC production by also increasing its supply. In this case, both 
productions have the same sign, leading to a decrease in oil prices and an 
increase in oil demand. 
On the
 other hand,
 if OPEC aims 
to
 stabili
se oil prices around a target 
(for given global demand 
conditions
) it must drain the eventual excess supply by reducing its own supply to support
 prices
. 
In 
this case, n
o sign restrictions a
re imposed on price and global activity
, as they could increase or 
decrease depending on the net impact on production.
41 Aggregate demand shocks are identified by 
simultaneous increases in supply and price
. In the case of a speculative demand shock, market 
players purchase oil ahead of expected future shortages in the oil market and, as a result, the real 
price of oil, inventories and oil production will go up while aggregate demand will decrease 
(see Table
 A for a summary of sign restrictions).

s. Three major conclusions can be drawn from 
the results of 
this analysis: 
(i) there is no clear 
dominance of demand and supply factors
 Œ each play a relevant role in explaining oil price 
dynamics, depending on the historical period analysed
; (ii
) OPEC policies 
have 
contributed 
to 
maintaining a
 high 
oil price 
in 
certain
 specific episodes; 
and (iii
) speculative demand is 
never a relevant factor.
 In particular, the contribution of global economic activity to the 
evolution of 
the 
oil price is 
reduced
 in this framework
, especially during the period from early 2005 until 2015
, 
although it remains the major driver in the late 
1970s and early 
1980s (see 
Chart
 Ab). With regard 
to supply factors, the model identifies two specific episodes when OPEC a
cted to keep the market 
tight. 
One of these, t
he period between 1979 and 1985
, is generally characteri
sed by less buoyant 
demand, increasing non
-OPEC supply and declining prices. 
During that time
 OPEC 
(namely Saudi 
Arabia
) attempted
 to support prices by re
stricting production, 
thereby 
preventing prices from 
dropping further. The 
second
 episode
 was
 between the end of 2004 and the beginning of 2008, that 
is, in 
the run
-up to the global financial crisis
, when OPEC actively 
worked to maintain a relatively 
tight
 market balance and 
elevated 
price
s (see Chart
 Aa). More general
ly,
 this framework has two major advantages 
over
 standard models of 
the 
oil 
market
 which do not differentiate between OPEC and non
-OPEC production.
 First, i
t is able to 
identify with more prec
ision the turning points related to specific events 
in the oil market 
by distinguish
ing
 between different types of supply policies
. Second, 
it reduces 
the residual shock

those 
supply shocks 
which have
 some persistent effect, 
a further
 restriction is
 impose
d, 
i.e.
 that the oil price reaction persists for at least 12 periods in the case of a strategic supply shock.

 This section assesses
 the evolution of oil prices
 and major market 
fundamentals in the age of shale oi
l,
 taking 
2011 
as a reference date
 Œ the year 
when shale 
oil 
production started to expand at a faster pace.
 Three phases are 
considered: 
the period from 
January
 2011

 mid
-2014; 
from 
mid
-2014 to 
October
 2016 and
 from 
November
 2016
 to

 The f

age
: January 
2011
 to mid
-2014 During the initial phase of expansion (January 2011 until mid
-2014) 
shale 
oil 
production trebled and drove
 the 
US share
 of the market 
to 12%, 
up from 7% in 
2011
. Total US 
production
 expanded by 76% from almost 5.4
 million barrels per day
 at the beginning of 2010 to around 9.5
 million barrels per day
 at the end of 2014 (
see Charts
 5, 6 and 7
). This increase was principally due to 
production from 
major shale 
rigs
 Œ such as 
those in the 
Eagle Ford and the Permian 
regions Œ which
 had more 
than doubled 
since
 2011, while US conventional production remained stable.

, OPE
C™s
 share 
of overall production 
decreased only marginally, 
owing to declines in
 production by 
other 
major 
non
-OPEC producers (Norway, 
the 
United 
Kingdom
 and Mexico).
 More 
significantly,
 Saudi Arabia expanded its 
production quota
; in mid
-2013
 it exceeded the production share it had held prior to 
the global financial crisis. Acting as the
 OPEC swing producer
, it 
compensated
 for 
production cuts
 in 
those 
Middle East
ern
 countries
 which were 
experiencing political 
instability and the 
effects of an 
international embargo
 (Libya and Iran
, respectively)
. In this initial phase, o
il prices
 appear to have been 
supported 
more 
by positive 
developments in 
demand, while supply factors were r
elatively
 muted
 (see Charts
 7, 8 and 9
). The impact of shale oil producers was still fairly small, since they 
faced high production costs and rather limited production capacity. 
The 
first 
projections by the 
US EIA
 on shale oil production date back
 to 2011. Since then 
production has
 proved
 to be 
well above expectations
, forcing the US EIA to regularly 
revise 
its forecasts
 upward
. 
This 
is likely to have led to
 an OPEC
 strategy of 
ﬁwait 
and see
ﬂ, and a period in which it
 incrementally
 fine
-tun
ed its supply to keep the 
market well balanced
 so that
 the 
price
s remained above 
USD 100 per barrel
, 
especially in Europe.
 This is consistent with a
 SVAR analysis which shows that oil 
prices were driven by stronger oil demand
 during this period
 (see 
Box
 2).

ew capacity of shale oil production
 represented a

to 
the prominence of OPEC™s
 role in the oil market. In
 2014, other non
-OPEC supply
 also rose by around 
one million barrels per day, refle
cting solid production figures in
 Brazil, Canada and Russia. OPEC 
rapidly 
started to lose market share (
2 percentage points between mid
-2011 and mid
-2014) and 
became concerned
 about 
the
 prospects for its high
-cost 
producers.
 3.2
 Two years targeting market
 share
 During the period from mid
-2014 until October 2016, 
OPEC
 switched
 to a 
strategy of 
targeting 
market share
. The 
reassessment of potential shale oil 
production growth
 in June
 2014 can be considered as 
a turning point for 
the oil 
market,
 as it 
indicated that operators had underestimated the relevance of shale oil 
production. During
 the first half of 2014
 not only
 did the US EIA
 repeatedly adjust its 
projections
 upwards
43, but more importantly, it 
extended 
its estimates of 
the life 
expectancy of s
hale 
oil production
 to 2030. In this context, OPEC realised that its 
loss of
 market share over the previous 
three
 years 
would not be
 regained 
without a 
change in strategy.

 The oil market in the age of shale oil
 69 While it is generally the role of swing producers
 to counteract te
mporary 
shocks
, sh
ale 
oil had 
modified the market structure permanently.
44 At this point, 
shale oil producers were still facing high break
-even prices although production 
capacity was growing
. Therefore
 an OPEC production policy consistent with 
maintaining high oil prices 
would have 
favoured
 continued development in the shale 
oil industry and progress in fracking technology, and resulted in further pressure on 
OPEC™s market share. Supply
 growth fr
om the United States and Russia was not 
offset by
 reduction
s in OPEC production
, and global demand growth was showing 
signs of slowing down
. This
 led the I
nternational 
Energy 
Agency (IEA)
 to revise its 
forecast
s for 2014 and 2015
 downwards
, mainly 
due to
 weaker projections for 
Chinese and European oil demand growth.
 On 
the back of the
se developments,
 OPEC took 
its
 decision 
in November 2014 
to abandon production 
quotas
. Th
is
 attempt to regain market share was only 
partially successful.
 As a consequence of lower prices the investment plans of 
OPEC™s competitors
 were heavily 
curtailed
 Œ especially in shale 
oil 
and non
-conventional fields
 Œ but competitors were not driven out of the market
. On the 
contrary
, they
 became more efficient over time. The supply glut 
continued
 to 
driv
e prices 
to a level 
as low as USD
 30 per barrel 
in early
 2016
. 
Despite the low prices,
 shale 
oil 
rig counts resumed 
their 
growth in April
 2016, and shale oil production 
proved to be more resilient than expected as producing companies were able to 
compress extraction costs. The shale oil industry survived through merge
rs and 
acquisitions, as highly indebted mid
-sized firms were acquired by larger entities with 
greater financial resources and capable of operating in an environment of low oil 
prices. In the period from mid
-2014 to April 2017, oil prices were driven mainly
 by 
supply dynamics. 
This is consistent with th
e results produced by applying the oil 
market model presented in Box 2.
 3.3
 Reversion to a policy of price stabilisation
 Targeting market share was proving too expensive for the strained public 
finances of OPE
C members
45 who agreed with major non
-OPEC producers 
in 
November 2016 
to adopt an approach of
 oil market rebalancing in order to 
support prices.
 Global supply was cut by 1.8
 million barrels per day
 but prices
 only 
rose 
to around 
USD
 50 per barrel. 
However, 
the involvement of Russia and other 
major non
-OPEC producers helped to partially preserve OPEC
™s 
role in the market
; in September
 2017 OPEC™s production
 still represent
ed 42% of global supply. Yet US 
production regained
, and then exceeded, its 2014 level, 
suggesting
 that major shale 
oil production companies,
 at least in the short run, 
were
 economically viable 
at a 
price of around
 USD
 50 per barrel.
                                                                     44  See

Saudi Arabia™s fiscal situation. See the

 The oil market in the age of shale oil
 70 The 
decline
 in 
OPEC™s production 
was 
a reaction to
 the considerable
 fall
 in 
the 
production costs of high
-cost shale 
oil 
producers
. In particular
, these 
producers 
introduced
 a series of technological improvements that raised their competitiveness. 
The life of shale 
oil rig 
wells
 was extended by using injection liquids that had n
ovel 
chemical compositions and
, in particular,
 by 
the 
widespread use
 of re
-fracking 
techniques
46. Drilling closer to the ﬁsweet spotﬂ
47 increased the recovery rate and 
contributed further to reductions in
 break
-even prices. 
The r
esilience of shale
 oil
 producers to 
low prices exacerbate
d the excess supply and kept oil price
s persistently 
below 
the levels
 justified by production costs. 
Prices that 
fluctuat
e around 
USD 50
 per barrel 
seem
 to be 
more consistent with short
- to medium
-term 
equilibrium prices. 
In order to 
progress with the rebalancing of the oil market through 
global supply restraints, member countries who signed up to the November
 2016 OPEC agreement have recently extended it until the end of 2018, with the possibility 
of a review in June of that year.
 Box
 2  Historical decomposition of 
the 
oil price in the shale 
oil 
age
 Prepared b
y Irma Alonso 
Álvarez and Virginia Di Nino
 This box provides an assessment of the factors affecting oil price dynamics in the shale 
oil 
age
 Œ which began
 in
 2011
 Œ based on the fr
amework and the methodological approach 
explained in Box
 1. The developments in
 oil prices 
and in OPEC™s decisions can be divided into 
three distinct periods, identified by local peaks and troughs in prices
: 
the periods from 
January
 2011
 to
 May
 2014; from
 June
 2014
 to
 February
 2015; and from 
November
 2016 to
 April
 2017. While demand factors were more relevant until mid
-2014, the estimates obtained from the 
SVAR model suggest that 
since then, oil prices have been driven by 
supply dynamics
. In the 
first period, which coincides with the beginning of the shale oil revolution, the 14% increase in oil 
prices 
was
 driven by stronger oil demand growth (+38%), partially 
balanced
 by a slight increase in 
supply (+10%) which 
contributed negatively to t
he price 
dynamics
. However, since mid
-2014, 
it is 
OPEC
™s decisions 
which have been
 key in explaining the 
developments in
 oil prices.
 In November
 2014, OPEC abandon
ed production quotas. Indeed, the empirical analysis reveals that most 
(39%) 
of the 57% price
 drop experienced in the second half of 2014 and until early 2015 
was
 due to 
supply factors. In particular
, market share 
targeting 
represents 25%
, and an additional 7% 
can be 
attributed to the
 price stabili
sation policy. 
Speculative
 demand, which in this 
period
 can be
 interpret
ed as 
expectations of 
future excess supply
, delaying destocking of inventories,
 made a 
negative contribution
 of 
another 7
%, while d
emand factors contributed 9% to 
the drop in the 
oil 
price
 over the same period
. Since autumn 2016, supp
ly factors 
have continued to be
 key drivers of prices
, as OPEC 
switche
d back to a 
policy of 
price targeting.
 It announced the reinstatement of production 
quotas in 
an attempt to facilitate the reabsorption of excess supply. Chart
 A shows that 
it was 
primarily 
supply factors related to market share stabili
sation 
which 
supported upward movements in 
                                                                    46  See ﬁ

.   4 The relevance of shale oil in the medium term according to 
micro evidence
 Shale oil will remain an im
portant factor 
in oil production 
in the future.
 The 
hypothesis 
maintained 
throughout th
is analysis is that producers 
began to be
 perceived as 
effective
 competitors 
once
 their supply capacity expanded and their 
break
-even prices fell. However, how relevant is shale 
oil 
production expected to be 
in the medium term? This section provides evidence, based on 
the latest projections 
from 
Rystad
48, that shale oil will remain an important factor for at least two
 reasons
: 
i) the
 additional efficiency gains
 it is expected to achieve,
 and ii) the 
rapid
 increase of
 investment 
flows 
into the industry
 which 
are expected over the coming years.
 Technological progress 
has 
succeeded in consistently reducing the break
-even production price
s of shale oil.

 2017,

  Sources: Rystad data and ECB staff calculations.
 Note: The horizontal axis shows break
-even price (BEP) ranges in USD. The definition of BEP in the oil sector is the costs related to 
the entire oil cycle production. These include s
elling, general and administrative expenses, property acquisition costs, finding costs, 
costs of 
licensing rounds, signature bonuses
, the costs of drilling, exploration 
and development of 
wells , production and maintenance 
costs, 
transportation 
costs, taxe
s or royalties 
paid 
to the host state, return on 
capital and 
a risk premium to cover the uncertainties 
inherent in oil and gas investments
. The comparison of the two curves 
(2017 and 2020
) in Chart 10 also shows
 that 
current production
 of existing wells
 is
 limited to 
six million barrels per day.
 However shale oil supply is expected to expand rapidly 
beyond that limit
 at 
prices 
above 
USD
 40-45 per barrel
 in the future
. In particular, the development of new
ly 
approved
 projects 
could 
Œ according to these estim
ations 
Œ sustain a supply of 
around 
nine million barrels per day
 (equivalent to an increase

over
 three years
) provided

 USD

accompanies
 the 2020 supply curve
: since 
currently
 viable wells will be
 largely 
exhausted within two years
 and they are operating at prices below USD 40
-45 per 
barrel, the curve shows that 
production 
in three
 years is 
expected
 to be 
lower
 than 
today if prices remain within that range over the medium term (see Chart 15). S

made by

price 
dynamics in response to the emergence of a key novel factor
 Œ shale

production.
 Empirical results
 from
 a SVAR model with

 suggest that, 
especially since 2014
, s
hale oil has
 had an effect on developments in 
oil price
s: 
directly, by contributing to global supply growth; and indirectly, by influencing OPEC 
production policies. 
OPEC
 was
 incentivised to pursue market share as shale oil 
production increase
d but was 
not competitive enough. However, as shale oil 
producers gained in competitiveness, OPEC preferred a policy of price stabilisation 
around a value compatible with the break
-even cost of the marginal producers.
 Micro evidence suggests that n

has

oil modif
ied

incentives and therefore the mechanism of price formation
 over recent years

remain
 a crucial
 element of oil production,

 With the decline in transportation costs and the reduction o
f barriers to trade in the 
last decades, production processes have become more fragmented as firms locate 
their production and source their inputs across national borders. This has 
significantly increased trade in intermediate goods and services. Euro area
 countries, in particular, have been increasingly participating in cross
-border 
production chains, both within the currency area 
and outside.
 This article analyses how global value chains 
affect
 the euro area economy. In 
particular, accounting for the pres
ence of 
global value chains
 has an impact on some 
key
 economic indicators. The rise in importance of the value
-added concept as 
opposed to conventional gross trade and the increase in intermediate trade change 
the way macroeconomic indices are computed and
 interpreted. Moreover, firms™ and 
sectors™ participation in 
global value chains
 creates or strengthens cross

linkages via trade in intermediate inputs
, which 
has consequences for 
macroeconomic analysis, 
namely
 for 
real activity 
spillovers and the 
skill mix and

 of the labour force.
 1 Introduction
 The last 
few 
decades have witnessed 
a rapid 
expansion of global value chains
 (GVCs)
. Firms 
have been 
locat
ing
 their production and sourc
ing
 their inputs across 
national borders
. As a result, 
production has been increasingly organised in several 
stages across different countries, implying that exports have a significant amount of 
imported inputs incorporated into them (the ﬁimport content of exportsﬂ). As a result, 
production processes have bec
ome 
internationally
 fragmented
, 
trade in intermediate 
goods and services
 has substantially
 increased
 (around
 60% of world trade 
is estimated to be
 in intermediate goods
), and the gross value of exports has become 
much higher than the value added originatin
g in each exporting country
. Multilateral 
free trade negotiations and 
the subsequent reduction 
of tariffs 
and non
-tariff barriers, 
the opening
-up of emerging 
market economies 
(EMEs) to global trade, 
financial 
liberalisation, the 
internationalisation of bus
iness services
 and technological 
improvements
 are the most prominent factors that contributed to the expansion of 
cross
-country supply chains until recently.
 Euro area countries, in particular, have been increasingly participating in 
cross
-border productio
n chains
, stimulated by a harmonised regulatory framework 
within the European Union (EU) and integration in a common currency area. As a 
result, the establishment of a regional production chain and trade in intermediate 
products with the rest of the world 
have been fostered. A comparison of countries™

outside the euro area.
 In the years 
following
 the Great Recession
, which occurred in the period 2008
-09, 
the pace of supply chain 
expansion 
slowed substantially.
 Pan
el a of 
Chart
 1 shows that the halt in the expansion of global value chains has been a global 
phenomenon. It has been partly due to increasing labour costs in emerging markets, 
as well as the onshoring
51 of multinational activities towards export markets (t
he ﬁshortening of global value chainsﬂ, in which production is brought closer to demand 
markets). In addition, the introduction of protectionist non
-tariff barriers (for instance 
through local content requirements and other regulations) has increased trade
 costs, 
thus weighing on the expansion of global value chains. Other contributing factors 
may have been a global demand shift towards services, which are less trade 
intensive than goods, as well as robotisation, which is encouraging renewed 
localisation of
 production in the advanced economies.
52  Euro area countries, however, have been less affected by GVC shortening than 
other countries (Chart
 1, panel a).
 The process of shortening was particularly 
                                                                                                                                                          50  The euro area aggregates in Chart 1 include intra
-euro area trade in global value chains. Excluding 
intra
-euro area trade would deliver a lower participation in global value chains in the euro area. This 
highlights the relevance of re
gional production chains.
 51  Onshoring consists in transferring parts of the intermediate production processes close to the 
customers™ location. For instance, in the production of a car model which is sold in Asia, the production 
of components and parts of
 the vehicles would be relocated in the Asian region.

 Œ Articles
 The impact of global value c
hains on the macroeconomic analysis of the euro area
 77 pronounced in China. While in 2014 (the last year for which
 data are available) the 
degree of participation of the United States in global value chains was comparable to 
that in 2008, in the euro area it was significantly higher and was driven by intra
-euro 
area trade.
 Since the beginning of the 21st century, euro
 area countries have also 
recorded a rise in the foreign value added embedded in their exports, that is, 
they have been increasingly using imported inputs in the production of their 
exports.
 In
 panel b
 of 
Chart
 1, the evolution over time of the position of
 selected 
economies in the global value chain is plotted. The 
position 
index
53 of the euro area 
has fallen further below zero in recent years, meaning that euro area firms are using 
more foreign inputs and supplying fewer intermediate products to other coun
tries. 
Hence, they are located more ﬁdownstreamﬂ in global value chains. Large euro area 
countries are, in turn, located ﬁupstreamﬂ with respect to both small euro area 
countries and central and eastern European (CEE) countries
54. This means that the 
last t
wo country groupings use a relatively higher share of imported inputs in the 
production of their exports, often as a result of final assembly activities as part of the 
pan-European contribution to global value chains. Conversely, the United States is 
compa
ratively upstream as it provides intermediate products related to R&D, the 
financial sector and the commodity sectors to the rest of the world. Also, China
55 has 
been moving significantly upstream when comparing 2007 with 2014.
 Global value chains have an i
mpact on some key economic indicators. 
The rise 
in importance of the value
-added concept
, as opposed to conventional gross trade
, and the increase in intermediate trade have brought about some challenges 
with 
regard 
to the way macroeconomic indices are 
computed and interpreted.

implications of global value chains for the measurement and interpretation of 
three key indicators 
Œ real effective exchange rates, export market shares and the 
global demand elasticity of trade 
Œ will be analyse

important consequences for macroeconomic analysis.

 Recent strands of the 
GVC 
literature have made use of global input
-output 
tables in order to 
trace value
-added flows through the various stages of production.
56 The first goal is to 
decompose gross export flows
 of goods and services
 in order
 to disentangle the source
s of value 
added from 
what merely constitutes back
-and-forth tra
de in intermediate products (double
-counting).
57 Figure
 A identifies 
the 
three main components 
of statistics on 
gross export flows: 
(i) 
domestic value added
 (DV);
 (ii) 
foreign value added
 (FV);
 and (iii) a double
-counting term (DC). 
Domestic value added reflects the use of domestic inputs in the production of exports and therefore 
captures the genuine contribution of exports to GDP. Foreign value added refers to the use of 
foreign inputs in the proce
ss of export production. Finally, the third component consists of the 
value 
of intermediate products that cross borders more than once, thus representing
 double
-counted 
flows
. Figure A
 Decomposition of gross exports into value
-added components

sed on Koopman 
et al. 
(2014).
 Note: The 
value of intermediate products that cross borders more than once is the value incorporated in all those intermediate inputs t
hat are produced in a 
country A, which are exported to country B (and are hence counted as 
an export of country A) to produce products for another country (either A itself or a third 
country C) and are therefore counted again in country B™s gross exports.
 Within the domestic value
-added
 component,
 it is important to 
further 
distinguish
 between
 those 
trade 
flows 
that
 are absorbed abroa
d for final consumption or investment
 (DVA) 
and those that
 are 
re-exported to other countries (IV)
 and thus depend on the demand of those countries.
58 Finally
, 
returned
 domestic
 value added (RDV) 
refers to
 exports tha
t are used as input
s in production 
processes abroad
, but then return and are consumed domestically
. Value

 The impact of global value chains on the macroeconomic analysis of the euro area
 79 chains can be 
measured
 as the value added embedded in 
the 
foreign inputs (FV in 
Figure

(or upstream) participation
, on the other hand, can be 
measured as the value added in in
termediate
 products
 which are 
exported to a trade partner and 
then 
reprocessed
 and exporte
d further 
by the trade partner 
(IV in 
Figure
 A). Synthetic measures of GVC participation and the GVC position can be derived from this 
decomposition.
 The extent of a

  A relatively high
er share of foreign value added from upstream input providers would indicate a 
downstream position and hence lead to a negative value of the index. Conversely, a higher share of 
value added in re
-exported intermediate products trave
lling further down the v
alue chain would be 
an indication 
of an upstream position and
, in this case
, the 
GVC 
position index would be positive.

 Real effective exchange rates (REERs) are a measure of the international price 
and cost competitiveness of a country.
 REERs are computed as a trade
-weighted 
average of a country™s bilateral exchange rates vis

nt trading 
partners, adjusted for price levels.
60 As such, they are used in aggregate

 The impact of global value chains on the macroeconomic analysis of the euro area
 80 import
 flow models and as a synthetic indicator for the analysis of 
trade
 performance 
and balance of payments adjustments.
 A challenge to 
the interpretation of 
conventional REERs is 
posed
 by the fact 
that imports are pervasively used to produce exports in today™s global 
economy
. As a result,
 countries often compete against each other in specific 
stages
 of the value
-added chain (e.g. 
two emerging economies may compete in the 
assembly of 
an iPhone). 
The conventional REER measures, however,
 assume that 
countries compete to sell products that they produce entirely at ho
me, using only 
domestic inputs.
 In particular, bilateral value
-added t
rade patterns may differ significantly from 
gross trade patterns
, which
 implies that gross value trade weights may over
- or understate the degree of bilateral competition for value
-added exports
. To 
account for this effect
, value
-added real 
effective 
excha
nge 
rates (VAREERs) based 
on bilateral value
-added trade data
 can be constructed
. VAREERs thus take into 
account that gross trade flows of intermediate goods, for instance between 
neighbouring countries, may distort the extent to which value added in terms
 of final 
goods is traded between countries.
 Moreover, as countries trade intermediate inputs intensively, this affects the 
impact of exchange rate changes on trade.
 An appreciation vis
-à-vis a trading 
partner from which a country largely imports intermedi
ate goods (e.g. components 
imported by China from Japan for iPhone assembly) may actually be beneficial for 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
that country as it reduces the cost of intermediate goods 
imports. To account for this effect
, input-output 
real 
effective 
exchange 
rates 
(IOREERs)
 can be constructed
. IOREERs identify an additional channel through 
which exchange rate movements affect price competitiveness. An appreciation not 
only increases the relative price of domestic goods and therefore worsens the 
country™
s price competitiveness, it also has a counteracting effect on competitiveness 
as it reduces the cost of foreign inputs used in production.
 REERs based on GVC 
weights
 therefore offer a complementary measure that 
enriches the interpretation of more traditio
nal measures based on gross trade 
and used 
in the computation of
 the 
REERs
 disseminated by the ECB
.61 VAREERs are calculated by replacing conventional bilateral total gross trade weights 
with value
-added weights. IOREERs, instead, take into account bilatera
l trade in 
intermediates and attach a lower weight to partners that provide a sizeable share of 
inputs in a country™s production in order to account for the fact that an appreciation 
vis
-à-vis such trading partners may actually be beneficial to the competi
tiveness of 
the importing country as it reduces the cost of production.

 62  In 
order to ensure full consistency, GVC REERs are computed following the ECB method for the 
computation of its published REERs, namely by using three
-year non
-overlapping averages as weights. 
Standard REERs are in turn recalculated by deflating nominal excha
nge rates with relative GDP 
deflators and by considering a basket of only 40 (instead of 57) currencies because of data availability 
limitations for input
-output data.

 Global value chains
 and export market shares
 With GVC integration, gross exports might not gauge a country™s international 
contribution to trade in terms of value added.
 As int
ermediate inputs cross 
borders several times within production chains, tracing value
-added flows can be 
crucial for the assessment of the effective contribution of a country to the world 
market. Input
-output data can be used in order to gather information 
on countries™ 
value
-added structures
63 and can be complemented with trade price data in order to 
investigate the price and non
-price factors behind the evolution of market shares.

 The impact of global value chains on the macroeconomic analysis of the euro area
 83 gains in terms of value added compared with gross trade in Slovenia and Slovakia 
can be explained by the outsourci
ng to these countries of the final assembly of motor 
vehicles by Germany, France and Italy. A similar trend is observed in the 
manufacturing of food products, chemical products and wood products outsourced 
from Finland, Sweden and Germany to Lithuania and 
Latvia. Estonia shares the 
above

 changes of global market shares
 are shown
. Figures for the euro area 
are calculated as a weighted average for 
individual euro area countries (using gross exports and value added in gross exports as weights).
 The decomposition of the determinants of the changes in global market shares 
suggests
 that 
the international fragment
ation of production plays a non
-negligible role in the shifts of market shares (
Chart
 5). Changes in global value
-added market shares can be decomposed into shifts in production chains, the 
variation of price factors and the change of residual non
-price fa
ctors which can be 
thought of as being related to product quality and consumers™ tastes.
66 The 
decomposition is done 
at the very detailed product level
 which makes it possible to 
control for differences in market conditions. First, the
 elasticity 
of real tr
ade flows 
to 
changes in relative prices 
is estimated for every product on every 
geographical
 market
. Taken together with the information on the changes in unit values, it provides 
the contribution of price and cost factors at a disaggregated level. Then, t
he aggregate contribution of price competitiveness is obtained. To account for the fact 
that each product contains value added from various countries, the aggregation
 uses weights calculated from trade in value
 added (rather than gross trade
, 
as in the 
con
ventional REER).
 Moreover, 
a specific term accounting for shifts in global value 
                                                                    65  This was related to the manufacturing process of Elcoteq in Estonia, which started in the late 1990s 
and was later reduced substantially.
 66  The decomposition
 also
 include
s ﬁother factorsﬂ 
such as
 shift
s in demand or changes in the set of 
competitors. The
 empirical
 importance of 
other
 factors 
is found to be 
minor, 
but

y are still needed for 
a theoretically sound decomposition.

. Changes in 
GVC 
participation and outsourcing 
resulted in
 market share losses 
for non
-CEE euro area countries (except for Portugal, Lu
xembourg, Malta and 
Cyprus) and gains for CEE euro area countries between 2000 and 2014 (Chart
 5).
 At t
he same time, increases in quality and consumers™ preferences for CEE euro 
area countries™ products overcompensated for the losses in price competitivene
ss. 
Compared with gross export market shares, the decomposition considering value
-added shares downplays the role of non
-price competitiveness, since some part of 
quality gains and losses of the gross exports can be attributed to the outsourcing 
process.
68 Thus, the analysis based on value
-added shares enhances the role of 
cost and price factors.
 In conclusion, u
sing value
-added flows instead of gross exports for the 
computation of global market shares 
improves the understanding of
 the 
drivers 
behind
 the
 external 
performances
 of euro area countries
. Although both 
market shares follow similar trends, the decomposition of the value
-added shares 
reveals the role of production outsourcing and provides 
a more precise contribution 
of price and non

 Global income elasticities of trade
 While trade 
grew by twice as much as 
income 
over the period 1981
-2007, the 
trade
-to-GDP 
growth 
ratio 
fell to about unity in the period 2011
-2014 (Chart
 6).
 In particular, the drop in the ratio was driven by a 
collapse in trade flows following the 
Great Recession that was significantly stronger than the decline in global income.
 Chart
 6 Ratio of global import growth to GDP growth
 (ratio)
  Source: ECB staff calculations.
 Note
s: The last observation refers to 201
4. The red line shows the ratio of 
the 
average growth rate of global imports of goods and 
services to global GDP 
growth 
over a rolling 
five
-year window (the green line is based on a 
ten
-year window).
 The 
changing 
international fragmentation 
of production is 
one of the drivers of
 the 
trade growth dynamics in relation to
 income growth.
 Although (tariff and 
non-tariff
-related) trade costs, trade openness and financial liberalisation have been 
important determinants of trade growth, the intensity o
f engagement in global value 
chains plays a key role in explaining the disproportionate growth of trade compared 
with income at the end of the last century and the unexpectedly sharp drop after the 
crisis. First, from a merely statistical point of view, th
e organisation of production 
chains implies that goods and services cross borders several times during the 
production 
process and are hence partly double
-counted in custom
s trade flow
 statistics (see Figure
 A in Box
 1). 
As a result
, registered gross trade 
flows exceed the 
effective value added of trade flows (Chart
 7). Second, trade in global value chains is 
mainly in durable goods, which are known to have a high income elasticity, 
explaining the steepness of the trade reaction in the global crisis. Third, 
supply chain 
effects might intensify negative demand shocks, as downstream firms would initially 
cut inventories
, affect
ing
 input providers.

 The impact of global
 value chains on the macroeconomic analysis of the euro area
 87 chains has been about 40% on average.
70 Howev
er, recent data on GVC integration 
indicate a flattening trend in recent years
71 and this translates into a negative 
contribution of global value chains to the global income elasticity of trade for the 
period 
2012-13 (Chart
 8).
 The results of this analysis 
suggest that GVC dynamics are relevant for 
medium
-term trade projections
. From a euro area policy perspective, the decline 
in GVC participation was one of the factors explaining recent downward revisions to 
the global income elasticity of trade.
72 Going for
ward, a close monitoring of GVC 
dynamics is warranted to ensure consistent trade projections.

 are weighted averages of the value added of a selected group of upstream and

 ,=1,,,  where * stands for ﬁupﬂ and ﬁdownﬂ and the weight 
, measures the bilateral importance of th
e value
-added contribution and is inversely proportional to the bilateral distance. The aggregate 
, is constructed such that only sectors with a weight above a certain level 
r are included in the 
average. The threshold is endogenously determined b
y the model and allows the identification of 
the most important sectors for spillover transmission.
79 The regression
s confirm that upstream and downstream
 spillovers
 through supply chains 
are significant.
 The spillover effects are positive and of sizeable m
agnitude and their significance 
is not lost when including other determinants of sector 
i™s activity (employment and capital), the 
country™s activity and global factors (agriculture, fuel and metal prices and US interest rates). This 
means that the change 
in activity of a sector is related to the change in activity of both its input 
providers and its customers.
 The impact of a change in 
real value added in 
any sector can be
 traced and
 quantified
 by using the estimated coefficient
s from the model
. This exerc
ise identifies spillovers that stem 
solely from a change in real value added in the affected sectors. For example, the transport 
equipment sector (i.e. the car industry) in Germany and the electronics and optical equipment 
sector in China illustrate how ch
anges in real value added propagate to other domestic sectors, the 
euro area and the rest of the wo
rld (Chart
 A). Obviously, the supply
 chain impact is 
the 
greatest in 
the domestic economy, affecting 27 and 30 sectors res
pectively (blue bars), but it also 
affects many 
other sectors in the euro area (yellow bars) and even spills over to other countries and involves a 
total of 236 and 172 sectors respectively (red bars). When these and other hub sectors™ ties to the 
rest of the value chains are severed, spill
overs gradually diminish and become statistically 
insignificant.

 The i
mpact of global value chains on labour value added, 
hours 
worked 
and compensation
 Between 1997 and 2011 uns
killed labour
™s value
-added share
 in the euro area 
has 
substantially declined, whereas skilled labour™s share has increased.
 Aggregating sectoral data at the country level 
helps to disentangle 
the evolution of 
the 
labour value
-added contribution
 for different skill groups within the euro area.
81 The
 overall 
importance 
of labour in both 
euro area 
output and exports decreased 
sligh
tly from 1997 to 2
011. Among the five largest euro area economies, Germany is 
characterised by the highest shares of labour value added.
 Euro area
 exports 
contain significantly less labour value added than gross output, revealing that 
exporting firms rely 
more heavily o
n imported inputs and/o
r capital (Chart
 10).

83 The estimation results confirm 
that there is

rs (Chart
 11, panel
 a).85 When 
disentangling the effect between backward and forward
-looking participation ind
ices, 
th
is effect is mainly driven by an increased usage 
of 
imported inputs.
86 Such a job 
polari
sation might 
be related to
 a combination of both offshoring and skill
-biased 
technical change at the sector
al level.
 Turning to wages, panel analysis shows that backward
 participation in global 
value chains is associated with an increase in hourly compensation for all skill 
groups (
Chart
 11, panel b).
 Both high
 and low
-skilled workers experience an 
increase in their hourly compensation when the sector they are working in 
sees an 
increase
 in the foreign value added embedded in its exports (backward 
participation)
.87 This result is supported by existing studies that show that i
mported 
inputs generate important productivity effects, through channels involving learning, 
innovat
ion, and 
variety or quality aspect
s.88 While an increased share of imported 
inputs in the production process might benefit total factor productivity and hence 
potential output,
89 competitiveness would improve only when productivity increases 
faster than inpu
t costs (wages and the rental rate of capital). A
 number of firm
-level 
studies 
find a positive net effect of imported inputs on external competitiveness, 
hence enabling entry into new export markets.
90 Moreover, the strengthening of 
global value chains has the potential to weaken the elasticity of exports to the 
exchange rate, for example if exports are increasingly made of inputs bought in 
foreign currencies.
91                                                                     83  The wage regressions also include the capital

. At the same time,
 glob
al value chains may have positive

advancement following the more efficient allocation of workers to high

 Supply chain linkages are an important channel for technology transmission from parent to 
host firms.
 Firms involved in production chains can benefit from being related to more 
technologically advanced parent firms as they can learn and absorb their techn
ology. According to 
the literature
, there are two main transmission channels. On the one hand, firms utili
sing parent 
companies™ intermediate products in their production
 Œ i.e. firms with backward supply linkages
 Œ can have access to new technology embedd
ed in those products and to a wide variety 
of 
input
s. On 
the other hand, firms providing intermediate products to their parent companies
 Œ i.e. firms with 
forward supply linkages
 Œ are subject to quality checks which improve their products. This
, in turn
, would enhance their productivity and allow them to upgrade
 capital
. Given the high integration 
of CEE countries 
in 
global 
value 
chains, productivity 
developments of firms in 
these
 countries depend heavily on these technology spillovers.
 As 
                                                                    92  Welfare gains for advanced economies only materialise when 
resources 
are efficiently and rapidly 
reallocated across 
skill groups.

 The impact of global value chains on the
 macroeconomic analysis of the euro area
 94 shown in 
panel 
a of 
Chart
 1, 
CEE countries are integrated in GVCs to a much larger extent than the 
euro area on average, even after the general slowdown in GVC participation growth after 2011. For 
this reason, this box uses the CEE region as a case study to analyse to wha
t extent and how 
technology spills from parent to host firms in GVCs.
 According to the literature, new technology diffuses across countries in two stages: first 
from global frontier firms to national frontier
 firms
, and second from national frontier firms 
to national non
-frontier firms.
 This framework 
is adapted 
to GVCs and
 it is
 assume
d that the 
relevant global frontier firms are parent firms and that only national frontier firms in the host country 
participate directly in GVCs. Accordingly, in a first stage, the most productive firms in the host 
country absorb technology from parent fir
ms. In a second stage, the new technology spills from 
firms participating in GVCs to non
-frontier firms in the host economy, which operate in domestic 
production chains and interact with national frontier firms. Moreover, transmission depends on the 
exposu
re to and learning from the relevant frontier firms (ﬁpass
-throughﬂ effect)
, as well as the 
ability to catch
 up with the frontier (ﬁcatch
-upﬂ effect).

 Parametric analysis using data
 from the Competitiveness Research Network (
CompNet
) and 
the latest WIOD release for 
nine
 CEE countries
 and 
ten
 years (2003
-12) provides evidence in 
support of the importance of technology transfer for 
total factor 
productivity (
TFP) growth in 
CEE economies
. First, TFP growth of the most productive firms in CEE countries, assumed to be 
directly participating in GVCs, is associated positively and significantly with TFP growth of non
-CEE 
EU frontier firms operating in 
sectors involved in the same production chain (the 
ﬁGVC frontier
ﬂ). 
The first two columns of Table
 A confirm the importance not only of the pass
-through effect
, but also 
of the catch
-up effect (proxied by the lagged TFP gap to the GVC frontier). Second, TF
P growth of 
non-frontier firms in CEE countries is related fundamentally to TFP growth of the most productive 
domestic firms participating in GVCs, rather than to the 
GVC 
frontier (
the 
last two columns of Table
 A). Thus, non
-frontier firms benefit only ind
irectly from the technology transfer through GVCs. These 
results confirm the two
-stage technology diffusion process proposed by the literature. Moreover,

. 4 Conclusions
 Euro area countries 
are heavily
 involved in global production chains
. This has 
an impact on some key macroeconomic indicators
. It is 
therefore 
essential to 
consider 
global value chains
 when dealing with 
certain
 macroeconomic concepts
. 
More specifically
:  Measures of competitiveness which 
account for the presence of 
global value 
chains,
 such as value
-added and input
-output REERs
, portray
 different pictures 
regarding episodes of 
currency 
appreciation/depreciation 
compared with 
conventional REERs.
  Although shifts in production chains are not a major determinant of the change 
in global market shares of 
euro area
 countries, 
taking into 
account 
global value 
chains
 helps 
to 
understand the drivers of
 competitiveness
.  Developments in g
lobal value chain
s have 
played a role in the accelerating
 and then 
decelerating
 dynamics of the elasticity of trade to global demand
 over the 
past decades
. To the extent that 
the high responsiveness of trade to income 
Œ which was observed before the crisis also as a result of 
the expansion of global 
value chains 
Œ is no longer observed in the future, a lower elasticity 
of trade to 
income could be regarded as the 
ﬁnew normal
ﬂ. Firms
™ and sectors™ involvement in production chains creates cross
-country 
interlinkages
. This has a be
aring on 
the analysis of 
macroeconomic 
spillover
s:  Real spillovers
 via input
-output linkages
 occur 
and certain 
sectors 
may play a 
key role in
 their transmission
. 
Moreover, 
production chains are a channel for 
foreign and domestic technological transfer to 
non-frontier 
firms
, which 
takes 
place
 through 
the 
technology 
that is 
embedded in imported intermediate
 product
s.  Finally, sectors increasing their involvement in global value chains tend to hire a 
higher share of high
-skilled workers and show systematically
 higher wages for 
any 
given 
skill level. 
In
 particular
, 
sectors located downstream 
in 
the value 
chain
 see a positive effect on wages from using more foreign inputs
