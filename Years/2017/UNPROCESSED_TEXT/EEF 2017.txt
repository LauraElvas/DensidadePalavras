NAVIGATING THROUGH C
HOPPY WATERS
 Euro area recovery continues, surrounded by heightened uncertainty
  9 The European economy
 demonstrated resilience in 
2016, as it 
maintain
ed its course of growth and
 job 
creation
 even as it faced
 a number of challenges. 
Growth was
 moderate
 but pick
ed up slightly towards 
the end of
 the year, with the 
continued 
support of 
very accommodative monetary policy, 
low commodity 
prices, 
the 
euro
™s relatively low exchange rate
 as well as endogenous factors such as improving labour 
market conditions. Th
e 
resilien
ce of the euro area 
recovery
, however
, can
not be
 taken
 for granted. 
While GDP has recovered to its pre
-crisis leve
l, t
he persistent weakness of investment casts a shadow 
over the 
sustainability of the recovery.
 The macroeconomic and financial landscape is 
being strongly challenged and the level of uncertainty at 
the current juncture is exceptionally high, 
for reasons 
including a 
possible
 sharp shift
 in US policies, 
a lack of 
information 
about 
the path for the UK
™s exit from the EU, monetary policy divergence at the 
global level, 
and upcoming 
elections in a number of
 European countries
. While the 
EU economy 
navigate
s 
these choppy waters, 
it will do 
so 
with fading support from some of the 
extraordinary external 
fact
ors
 that have been helping it thus far, such as low oil prices and past exchange rate
 depreciation
.  GDP growth is expected to remain fairly
 steady in 
the euro area at 1.6% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018. 
Private consumption, the main source of growth so far,
 is set
 to slow down
 as consumer prices rise and
 dampen real disposable income
 growth
. It should
, 
however
, 
continue 
to 
benefi
t 
from 
rising employment
, though to a lesser extent than in 2016. 
Investment growth is 
projected 
to remain moderate. 
On the one 
hand, investment should benefit from many favourable determinants 
including
 strengthening global 
activity, high capacity utilisation and policy support (e.g. low financing costs
 and the Investment Plan 
for Europe). However, a number of
 hindrance
s will remain, such as the high level of corporate and 
household debt in some Member States, 
the
 moderate demand 
outlook
 in Europe
, 
and 
the high level of 
uncertainty. As regards trade, the expected 
pick
-up in emerging market economies
, 
and some advanced 
economies
, 
should 
raise foreign demand for euro area exports. 
Although declining, growth differentials 
across euro area Member States remain large 
and the increase in 
benchmark yields and the USD 
appreciation 
could exacerbate these growth differences
 again
. Unemploymen
t 
in the euro area
 is 
forecast to fall further to 
9.1
% in 2018
. Oil prices are expected to drive he
adline inflation 
in the euro 
area 
to 
1.7
% in 2017
 but inflation is expected to drop back slightly to
 1.4% in 2018.
 Core inflation is 
projected to slightly increase and stand at 1.4% in 2018. 
 Downside risks to the growth outlook have intensified since the autumn but upside risks have 
also 
emerged
, at least for
 the short term
. The factors supporting these upside risks,
 however, carry the seeds 
of their own 
decline
. The eventual
 package of US fiscal stimulus and pro
-business reforms 
could 
provide 
a stronger near
-term boost to US and global GDP than currently 
assumed
. However, new downside 
risks 
for the medium term
 are re
lated to potential disruptions associated with shifting US positions on 
trade policy, a faster reversal of the US monetary policy stance and its impact especially on emerging 
markets. Risks to the growth outlook are also associated with the process of the 
UK leaving the EU, 
remaining 
banking fragilities in the euro area, an abrupt drop in global 
investor 
risk appetite
, 
as well as
 the possibility of
 a disorderly adjustment in China. Overall, risks to growth remain predominantly 
on 
the dow
nside
, while r
isks t
o the inflation outlook remain broadly balanced.

   10 1. PUTTING THE FORECAST
 INTO 
PERSPECTIVE: HOW PERSISTENT ARE CRISIS 
EFFECTS IN THE EURO 
AREA?
 Nine years after the global 
economic and
 financial 
crisis struck in 2008, the euro 
area is experiencing 
a moderate expansion of economic activity
 with 
robust employment growth
. However, several 

elements 
suggest that the recovery is still 
incomplete. The output gap is narrowing but 
has 

not yet closed; the unemploy
ment rate
 remains 
about 
2 
pps. higher than before the crisis and 
is 
still 
very high in some Member States; investment 
remains 
weak
; and 
the euro area
™s potential growth 
has been hit by the impact of the crisis.
 A slow recovery from the financial and economic 

crisis was expected
 (
1) and has indeed been a 
feature in many advanced economies following the 

Great Recession
 of 2008
-2009
. But even so, the 
recovery in the euro area has been particularly 

slow. 
Its drawn
-out nature carries the risk 
of 
permanent damage to productive capacity
 a
s 
highlighted by a number of observers
. (
2)  Indeed, the 
observed
 protracted weakness of 
investment could become self
-reinforcing as 
expectations of slow potential growth become 

entrenched. Also some labour
-market indicators 
point to areas where cyclical u
nemployment is at 
risk of becoming structural. 
Left unattended, this 
could result in 
a highly 
persistent
 (
3) crisis impact 
on the euro
-area economy. 
 The recovery was particularly slow in the euro 
area 
Real GDP in the euro area 
recovered 
its pre
-crisis 
lev
el in 2015
-Q3, but the pace of 
growth is slow 
                                                           (1)

In what follows, the term ﬁpersistentﬂ is used for shocks 

that take a long time, compare
d to usual business
-cycle 
developments, to be absorbed. A large literature has 

developed around the concept of ﬁhysteresisﬂ, which, 

strictly speaking, requires shocks to have permanent 
effects. 
 compared to 
past
 recoveries after major recessions 
(see Graph
 I.3
) and compared to recoverie
s in 
other economies/regions (see Graph
 I.4
). To be 
sure, developments in the euro area were more 
challenging than elsewhere. The global f
inancial 
crisis was followed by the sovereign debt crisis 

(2011
-2013) and a fully
-fledged recovery started 
only in 2013. Already before 2008, the growth 

performance of the euro area was relatively weaker 

than in other advanced economies; the debt crisis 

induced an outright decoupling of the euro area 
from other developed countries, including those 

that were also hit by the banking crisis.
 (
4) The 
difference is particularly striking when compared 

to the US
, 
which
 was at the epicentre of the 
global 
economic a
nd financial crisis.
  In the context of the sovereign debt crisis, 

domestic demand in the euro area was dampened 

by negative feedback loops between banks and 

sovereigns and the need for frontloaded fiscal 

consolidation, while monetary easing was 

constrained by the zero lower bound and financial 

fragmentation. Structural deficiencies in labour 

and product market
s 
and a comparatively less 
advantageous geographical orientation of external 

trade added to the slowness of the recovery.

EA and EU outlook
   11  Investment continues 
to 
lag behind 
Despite 15 consecutive quarters of GDP growth, 
investment in the euro area remains weak. The 

comparison with past recoveries suggests that 

investment growth in the euro area has so far failed 

to pick up to a speed that is typical 
for an advanced 

stage of recovery. The comparison with other 

advanced economies shows that investment has 

remained depressed 
for 
far longer than in other 
crisis
-hit countries. 
Investment 
as a percentage of
 GDP in the euro area is still 1.8
 pps. below the 
average of the early 2000s (i.e.
 before the 
pre
-crisis
 investment boom)
 (see Graph
 I.5
).    
A number of factors have contributed to keeping 

investment low, with different weights at different 

stages of crisis and recovery. In the initial years, 

financing constraints played a major role, as banks 

were first hit by the financial crisis and then, in
 some Member States, by 
negative 
feedback loops 
between the sovereign and the banking sector.
 (
6) At the same time, firms trying to reduce their debt 

typically cut back on investment.
 (
7) The 
importance of these factors has diminished 

gradually. More recen
tly, a subdued outlook for 
demand was found to be a major brake on 

investment
, in line with the accelerator model.
 (
8) Finally, firms tend to delay investment when they 

are faced with high uncertainty.
 (
9)   According to this forecast, the drop 
in investment 

as a proportion of GDP
 is not permanent 
(hysteresis in the strict sense) but, with total 

investment growth forecast at 2.9% this year and 

3.4% next, it is set to be protracted. Assuming 

investment growth and GDP growth at the rates 

forecast for 
2017, it would take until 2023 for the 
investment share to recover to 22%, its level in the 

years 2000
-05. 
 Looking at the components of fixed capital 

formation, construction investment has collapsed 

with the onset of the crisis, which in many 

Member State
s was related to the bursting of a 
housing bubble, as was the case in the US. In the 

euro area, it has bottomed out only in 2014
 (
10) and 
is expected to increase at around 3% p.a. this year 

and next. This leaves its share of GDP

   12 significantly lower than it 
was in the early 2000s, 
before the housing boom, (see Graph
 I.7). 
Equipment investment registered a double dip with 
troughs in 2009 and 2013. By 2016, its share 
of GDP was similar to the first half of the 2000s.
  
 Labour-market healing is incomplete– 
The economy has been creating jobs 

uninterruptedly for 
three
 years
. Employment 
growth in the past two years was even surprisingly 

strong
 considering the modest rates of GDP 
growth
 (see 
Section
 I.5)
. In December 2016, the 
unemployment rate reached 9.6% of the labour 

force in the euro area, its lowest level since 
May
 2009. However, supplementary indicators to 

unemployment signal that slack i
n the labour 
market still remains important, but also that there 

is a risk of elevated long
-term/structural 
unemployment that could be detrimental to the 

further improvement of the labour market and 

potential growth. 
 Even before the crisis, unemployment in the euro 
area was higher than in other advanced economies 

(see Graph
 I.8
), arguably reflecting labour
-market 
institutions and structural 
rigidities.
 (
11) Due to the 
double
-dip recession, the unemployment rate in the 
euro area peaked only in 2013 (2010 in the US). It 

currently remains 2
 pps. above its pre
-crisis level, 
while the US rate is back to its 2007 level, also 

helped by a fall in the 
labour
-force participation.
                                                            (11)

  The chances of finding a job decrease with the 
length of the spell out of employment. Joblessness 

that started as a cyclical phenomenon can therefore 

become structural. Forecasting labour market 

developments thus requires an 
assessment 
of 
which parts of the labour force could be brought 

into employment relatively easily, representing the 

cyclical component of joblessness or labour
-market slack, and which part of unemployment is 

structural or at risk of becoming so, making the 

crisis impact protracted or even permanent.

 provides a useful approximation. It 
displays for different labour
-market indicators the 
impact of 
the crisis (
the 
difference between pre
-crisis level
s 
and the 
peak) and the most recent 
reading. The closer the latest reading remains to 

the peak, the less impact the recent cyclical 

improvement has had on that indicator and the 

higher the risk of structural ossification.

there is a trend towards more part

Being a simple gauge, this approach cannot distinguish 
whether a recent improvement is due to cycl

   13 expected to fall bac

-crisis levels as labour 
demand 
rises
. Similarly, the downward trend for 
the hidden reserve of workers should continue as 
the recovery of the labour market encourages more 

and more workers to (re
-)enter the labour force. 
Additionally
, further incre
ases in labour
-market 
participation are also warranted in view of 

population ageing. 
  The unemployment rates for the long
-term 
unemployed, the low
-skilled and the youth have 
peaked 
more
 than 
‚headline

unemployment, and 
decreased at a much slower pace an
d with a delay 
(for long
-term and the low
-skilled)
. Unemployment among these groups
 remain
s 
at 
very high levels, suggesting less reactivity to 

cyclical improvements. The persistence of such 

‚pockets
™ 
of very high unemployment could thus 
be detrimental to s
tructural unemployment 
in the 
future
.  Long
-term unemployment (people being 
unemployed for more than 12 months) continued 

to decline in the first three quarters of 2016, 

though very slowly. At 5% of the labour force in 

the first three quarters of 2016, it 
stood 1
 pp. below 
its peak of 2014, but still more than 2
 pps. above 
its pre
-crisis level (of 2.9% in 2008). More 
worryingly, the average duration of unemployment 

has increased, and the share of the long
-term 
unemployed now represents half of total 

unemplo
yment compared to around 3
7% in 2009. 
In the US, the share is just 20%. Very long
-term 
unemployment (people 
who remain
 unemployed 
for more than 
two
 years) has 
barely
 started to 
decline and counted for 65% of the total long
-term 
unemploy
ed in the first half of 2016. 
 This may indicate that unemployment is becoming 

more entrenched. The literature points to several 

factors that make it harder to find a job the longer 

a worker remains unemployed: e.g. loss of skills, 

discouragement as well as 
signalling effects 

(employers are reluctant to hire 
someone 
who has 
been unemployed for a long time
 because 
they 
suspect
 that the long unemployment spell signals 
poor performance).
 (
15) All 
this 
suggest
s that 
long
-term unemployment 
has a negative impact 
on structural unemployment, labour
-force 
participation and thus potential growth. 
 Young people and the low
-skilled have been 
among the groups most affected by the crisis. 

Youth unemployment 
rate
 skyrocketed in the 
aftermath of the crisis to 
24.4
% in the euro
 area in 
2013 
and at 2
1% in 2016 remains very high by 
international and historical standards. Despite the 

positive trend, one should rem
ember
 that 
prolonged spells of unemployment 
can cause long
-lasting damage to the career of 
young people
, 
reducing their 
future
 wages and 
opportunities
. This 
is notably
 due to the lack of on
-the
-job training
 as 
well as
 the depreciation of knowledge and 
skills
 which 
tend to increase the risk of social 
exclusion.
 (
16) Moreover, during the crisis years, 
the positions they do man
age to find, given the 
competition on the job market, might well involve 

a lower rate of pay and less favourable career 

prospects than they could expect in less adverse 

circumstances.
 (
17) So the economic crisis has 
potentially scarring effects on young peo
ple. The

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2017
   14 loss of knowledge and skills for a significant 
number of youth not being employed for a long 

period of time could reduce the average 

productivity of the workforce and eventually lower 

potential growth.
 A different approach to distinguishing the cy
clical 
and structural components of unemployment 

consists of comparing headline unemployment to 

an estimated measure of structural unemployment. 

DG ECFIN estimates a non
-accelerating wage rate 
of unemployment (NAWRU) as part of its 

assessment of potential 
GDP growth and output 

gaps. The euro
-area unemployment gap in 2016 is 
estimated at 0.9
 pps., down from 
2.5 
pps. 
in 201
2 
(see Graph
 I.10
). By comparison, in the US, the 
unemployment gap is estimated to have closed in 

2014. It should be noted that the estimated 

NAWRU does also move with the c
ycle. 
 Looking at the different indicators in conjunction 

suggests that 
once full employment is reached, 

further employment growth can tap into slack that 

is still present (low number of hours, hidden labour 

force), but that a swift 
and continued 
reduction
 of 
unemployment w
ould
 become more and more 
difficult to achieve in the 
medium to long
-term 
particularly
 if a 
high share of long
-term 
unemploy
ment persists
. 
 Lingering effects of the crisis interact with 
potential growth 
Euro
-area potential GDP growth has fallen from 
close to 2% in the pre
-crisis years to just ½% in the 
aftermath of the crisis and has recovered only 
partly to 1.1% in 2016. It has been affected by the 

crisis as structural unemployment (in this context 

the N
AWRU) has reduced the labour contribution 
to potential GDP while the investment shortfall has 
reduced the capital contribution and productivity 

growth as new technology is adopted less quickly. 

The contributions 
of labour and capital
 to potential 
growth de
clined
 by a similar amount during the 
crisis. The crisis has compounded longer
-term 
negative trends of decelerating total factor 

productivity and population ageing, not fully 

compensated by a trend of increasing labour
-
market participation. 
 The internatio
nal comparison shows that the Great 
Recession and the sovereign debt crisis have 
exacerbated the differences in potential growth 

with other regions (see 
Graph
 I.11
). 
  Based on the present forecast, 
the very modest 

recovery in potential growth over the forecast 

horizon suggests 
a persistent impact of the crisis 

on the growth potential. 
 Looking further ahead, 
despite the 
continued 

decline
 in the 
ﬁheadline
ﬂ 
unemployment rate
, the 
probability that a non
-negligible share of cyclical 
unemployment becomes structural or that difficult 

career starts for young workers transform into 

lower productivity cannot be ruled out. If 

unaddressed, th
ese iss
ues could contribute to 
persistently lowering the contribution of labour to 

potential growth. On the side of investment, 

long
-lasting effects could stem from a negative 
feedback loop, as low investment reduces the 

growth potential and the anticipation of a
 lower 
economic 
growth potential reduces the incentives 
to invest.

   15 2. EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT 
The global economy is on the path of gradual 
recovery but uncertainty and risks (both downside 

and upside) have increased markedly
 following the 
results of the US 
presidential election
. Global GDP 
growth reached a low point in 2016 
but 
is expected 
to firm over the forecast horizon. The protracted 

downturn in emerging markets finally appears to 

have bottomed out and a gradual recovery should 

be supported by a 
turnaround
 in 
commodity prices. 
Better growth prospects in advanced economies
 in 
the near term
 reflect mainly an expected fiscal 
stimulus in the US. Nevertheless, the outlook for 

the global economy is subject to considerable 

uncertainty
, 
linked above all to the unce
rtain 
policy stance of the new US administration. While 

a stronger
-than
-expected short
-term fiscal impulse 
in the US 
would 
constitute a possible upside risk in 
the short term, a move towards more protectionism 

is likely to
 have a major negative impact on t
he 
global economy in the medium term.
 In addition, a 
stronger
-than
-expected US dollar would imply 
intensifying headwinds for emerging market 

economies, in particular tighter financing 

conditions, a risk of capital outflows and increased 

financial pressure 
on highly leveraged countries 

with unhedged USD
-denominated debt.
 Global activity has been on the rise since the 
second half of 2016 
Global activity 
gained
 momentum in the third 
quarter of 2016 with 
an 
acceleration in both 
emerging markets and advanced economies. Real 
global GDP growth firmed to 0.9% (q
-o-
q) in the 
third quarter, 
its 
fastest in two years. Among 
advanced economies, growth in 
the 
US and 
Canada rebounded particularly strongly, 

outweighing some soft patches elsewhere, with 

outright GDP contractions registered in Australia, 

Norway and Singapore. Growth in emerging 

markets generally picked up in the third quarter, 

but outturns were also quite differentiated with 

strong readings in Mexico and emerging Asia
 but
 weaker data in Brazil and Sout
h Africa.
 Forward looking indicators suggest 
that
 global 
growth has 
likely strengthened further in the final 
quarter of 
last 
year (see Graph
 I.12
). Business 
confidence in advanced economies has been rising 

steadily for some time now
, 
with December
™s 
composite and manufacturing PMIs both reaching 

54.0, respectively, 12
-month and 30
-month highs. 
Business sentiment also continued to improve in
 
emerging markets with third quarter levels near 

9-
quarter highs, largely driven by gradual 
improvements in China and Russia.
  The recovery is expected to gain momentum 
amid heightened uncertainty and risks 
Global growth (excluding 
the 
EU) is projected t
o have reached 3.
2% in 2016, the weakest since 
2009, 
but is expected 
to pick up over the forecast 
horizon to 3.7% in 2017 and 3.
9% in 2018, driven 
by a modest rebound in advanced economies in 
2017 and some firming in emerging markets in 

both years (
see 
Graph
 I.13). 
The recent 
improvement in the growth
 prospects for advanced 
economies largely 
reflects expectations of 
a fiscal 

stimulus in t
he US. Growth in emerging markets 
remains fragile 
after 
five years 
of decline, but is 
also expected to firm over the forecast horizon,
 although the picture varies considerably between 

countries and regions. On the whole, 
the 
recovery 
in emerging markets 
sh
ould 
be supported by a 
gradual increase in commodity prices, expected
 recoveries 
in the most distressed economies (Brazil 
and Russia) and 
stronger 
demand from advanced 
economies.
 Uncertainty concerning future US policy 
direction 
The results of the US presi
dential election 
represent at the current juncture the largest source 
of uncertainty for the global economic outlook. 

Policy direction on a wide range of key economic 

issues has yet to be fully articulated and some 

statements have suggested the possibility
 of a 
radical departure from past policies. It is however 

expected that a fiscal stimulus package will be 

introduced, although details concerning its exact

increases and tax cuts remain unknown. 
  A 
fiscal stimul
us package
 in the US
 would provide 
a boost to economic growth in the near term, both 

domestically
 and globally. Thus far, financial 
markets have reacted positively to the pro
-growth 
elements of the new 
administration
™s 
statements
, 
which include a potentially significant programme 

of deregulation across various sectors. 

Nonetheless, the maturation of the current cycle 

and the labour market
™s steady progression 
towards full employment imply constraints on the 

economy
™s scope to accel
erate significantly. 
 Price and wage pressures have been building 
in 

recent months. Reflecting these pressures and the 

strong performance of the US labour market, the 

Federal Reserve increased its policy interest rate 

by 25 basis points 
from 
0.5
% to 
0.75% 
at its 
meeting in December 2016
 and raised
 its forecast 
for the 
future path of interest rates
. The 
implementation of a fiscal stimulus package 
would 
likely add further to these pressures, potentially 

accelerating the tightening cycle that is currently 

unde
r way
. This would likely spur further US 
dollar appreciation and raise financing cost
s 
for 
businesses and households. 
 This forecast is based on the assumption that a 

fiscal stimulus package of around ½ percent of 

GDP will be deployed in 2017 and an additi
onal 1 
per cent of GDP in 2018. This is around the mid
- 
to lower
-range of current market expectations. 
Given the offsetting factors
 (the appreciation of the 
dollar and higher interest rates), this would 

generate a moderate net boost to US GDP growth 

of aro
und ½ 
- ¾ 
pps. cumulatively over the 
forecast horizon.
 This low implied fiscal multiplier 
suggests that one of the main outcomes of the 
expected US stimulus could be a noticeable 

increase in the US public debt.
 Current policy positions across non
-fiscal areas 
such as international trade present potentially 

significant downside risks to the economic 

outlook.
  
Outlook has improved among advanced 
economies 
The outlook among advanced economies outside 
the EU has improved 
in 
recent months, led 
principally by t
he US 
where a 
fiscal stimulus 
package
 is anticipated
. 
Overall, following a 
slowdown in GDP growth 
in advanced economies 

(excluding the EU) 
to 1.
6% in 2016, growth is 
expected to rebound modestly to 2.
1% in 2017 as 
transitory drags wane and underlying econo
mic 
activity gains momentum
 before slightly slowing 
down to 2.0% in 2018
 (see Graph
 I.14
). 
 In the US, following a weak start to the year, 

growth rebounded to 0.9% 
(q-o-q) 
in 2016
-Q3 as 
robust private consumption was accompanied by 

strong 
exports and an end to the prolonged period 
of inventory correction. 
The advance estimate for 
the fourth quarter shows that US growth 

moderated 
to 0.5% q
-o-
q. For 2016 as a whole, 
GDP is expected to have grown by 1.6%
, slightly 
less than the euro area, which grew by an 

estimated 1.7%
.  Initial indications signal that solid momentum will 

be carried into the early p
art of 2017, as 
confidence indicators among businesses and 

households have reached multi
-year highs. 
The 
new 
administration
™s implementation of fiscal 
stimulus is expected to provide a further boost to 

growth

outlook has been revised upwards for the coming 

period, underlying dynamics continue to point to 

an economic cycle that is gradually maturing and 

diminishing slack in th
e labour market.
 In Japan, growth 
in 
recent years has been stronger 
than previously reported. Following a strong start 

to 2016, the recent moderation in growth to 0.3% 

(q-o-q) 
in 2016
-Q3 implies that full
-year growth 
should
 come in at 0.9%. Domestic demand
 is 
expected to be sustained in the near term by a 

supportive macroeconomic policy mix and 
steady 

employment creation
, with GDP growth forecast at 
1.0% in 2017. However, waning fiscal stimulus 

measures 
in 
2018 
may
 see growth halving to 0.5% 
in 2018.
 Growth
 in 
other advanced economies 
outside the

 commodity prices improve 
investment dynamics 
in commodity exporters such 
as

 and

 Growth in emerging markets
 is firming, but 
uncertainty has increased markedly 
After several years on a downward trend, 

aggregate GDP growth in emerging markets 

appears to have bottomed out in 
2015-2016 (at 
around 4%, the weakest since 2009) and is set for
 some acceleration in 2017 and 2018 supported by a 

gradual increase in commodity prices. Following a 

period of intense financial market volatility and 

capital outflows in 2015 and at the beginning of 

2016, market sentiment towards emerging markets 

began to
 shift
, 
reflecting a modest improvement in 
growth prospects as well as accommodative 

monetary policy in advanced economies. However, 

emerging markets c
ame under renewed pressure 
toward the end of last year following the US 

election
s 
which ha
s 
raised uncert
ainty and 
increased downside risks. As concrete details of 

future US policies are still unknown, the forecast 

for emerging markets only factors in the initial 

market reaction to the US election results
, 
as well 
as the effects of heightened uncertainty on 

business confidence and investment
 and spill
overs 
expected 
from the US fiscal stimulus
.  Emerging markets are likely to be affected by the 

upcoming change in US policy through both the 

trade and financial channels. On the trade side, 
many emerging markets a
re strongly exposed to 
the US either through direct trade links or, as in the 

case of several Asian economies, indirectly 

through China. The impact of possible changes in 

US trade policy on emerging markets is not 

included in the baseline scenario but repr
esents a 
considerable downside risk, even though there may 

be some positive spillover effects of the planned 

US fiscal stimulus on some commodity
-exporting 
countries. In terms of regional impact, Latin 

America is likely to be most affected while the 

effect
 on emerging Asia will crucially depend on 
the nature of future China
-US relations. 
 With the possibility of 
faster
-than
-expected 
US 
monetary policy normalisation and a stronger US 

dollar, emerging markets are faced with a prospect 

of more financial market
 volatility, currency 
depreciations, intensified inflationary pressures 

and capital outflows. The likely response could be 

tighter domestic monetary and financial 

conditions. In many emerging markets the 

accumulation of debt, both public and private, is 

also a source of risk in this context, especially in 
cases of high corporate balance sheet exposure to 

unhedged USD
-denominated debt.
 (
18) 
These challenges come on top of some long
-standing forces shaping the outlook for emerging 

markets, including spillovers
 from the slowdown 
and rebalancing in China. Although the 

momentum of activity in China has increased in 

recent months and the 
short
-term outlook appears 
benign, current stimulus measures are fighting a 

sharp slowdown in private investment and are 

adding t
o China
™s high corporate leverage, thereby 
increasing potential bad debts and financial 

vulnerabilities. Together with the slow pace of 

structural reforms
, 
this raises significant concerns 
about medium
-term growth prospects.
 Global trade flows remained wea
k in 2016–
 World trade remained very weak in 2016. 
In the 

first 
11 months of 
the 
year
, world trade volumes 
grew by a mere 1.1% 
(y-o-y)
, the weakest since 
the crisis year 2009 (see Graph

world trade continues to come largely from 

emerging markets, but the significant weakness in 

2016 is also due to a soft patch in 
advanced

since 2009
. However,
 imports 
are expected to 
recover gradually to 
3.0% in 2017 and 3.7% in 
2018. 
For the latter year, this is a non
-negligible 
upward revision from the autumn, 
mainly due to 
the stronger
-than
-expected US import growth
 and 
a firmer trade outlook for China
. The acceleration 
of world imports (excluding the EU) over the 
forecast horizon reflects predominately the 

assumption of import elasticity rising from the 

curren
t lows of 0.3 (in 2015 and 2016) to 0.
8 
in 
2017 and 0.9 
in 
2018 (see Graph
 I.16
). While these 
levels remain well below past averages, the
y are 
consistent with a certain rebound in global trade 

flows following two years of exceptional 

weakness.
 (
20) 
 This assumption is underpinned by the projected 

cyclical strengthening in advanced economies and 

a related pick
-up in investment, combined with
 the 
gradual fading of temporary factors that weighed 

on trade in 2016. These temporary drags include 

the contraction in commodity
-related investment 
across the world (including in the US
 and
 Canada), 
second
-round effects of a severe terms
-of-trade 
shock o
n many emerging markets and other one
-off factors (e.g. wildfires in Canada).
 Global recovery is expected to be supported 
by a gradual rebound in commodity prices

                                                           (20) 
Some of the factors behind a long
-standing weakening of 
global trade flows include
: 
(i) cyclical weakness in 
intensely
-trading countries (e.g. EU)
; 
(ii) weakness in 
trade
-intensive investment
; 
(iii) maturation of Global Value

proposed cuts cover only the first six months and 

should be reviewed at the next OPEC ministerial 

meeting end
 of May. 
Moreover, the current price 
recovery provide
s some relief and incentives to 
raise output for other oil producers, including shale
 producers in the US
. The International Energy 
Agency forecasts
 global demand growth to slow

 The pr
ices of other commodities showed divergent 
trends in the fourth quarter of 2016. Nearly all 

metal prices witnessed some recovery. Food and 

raw material prices remained roughly stable or 

slightly declining due to record
-high stocks 
accumulated through succe
ssive bumper harvests 
in recent years. The outlook for food prices for 

2017-2018 remains subdued due to high 
inventories. Metal prices are forecast to increase in 

2017 due to higher oil prices and declining 
oversupply but to fall in 2018 in line with slowi
ng investment in China.
 Emergence of positive risks in the short term 
slightly shifts the balance 
Risks to the global outlook have risen markedly 
over recent months, driven largely by the results 

from the US 
presidential election and the policy 
uncertainty
 which this has created. Nonetheless, 
positive risks have emerged (particularly for 

advanced economies) in the form of the new US 

administration
™s fiscal stimulus proposals
, 
which 
would 
enhance growth in the near term. A larger 
fiscal stimulus package than
 currently assumed or 
a stronger reaction on the part of businesses and 

consumers would have positive demand spillovers 

for the global economy.
 On the negative side, there is a risk that 
the 
fiscal 
stimulus 
could be 
less ambitious or less effective 
than cu
rrently assumed. More pronounced 

downside risks include a shift in the new US 

administration 
towards increased protectionism. 
The withdrawal from multilateral trade agreements 

or imposition of import tariffs present potentially 

significant downside risks, particularly at a time 

when global growth is bottoming
-out and its 
recovery is still fragile.
 An accelerated pace of monetary policy tightening, 

in the US poses risks for advanced 
economies, 

including
 the EU
, 
and emerging market 
economies. 
For the latter i
n particular,
 downside 
risks dominate given their greater exposure to 

spillovers from increased protectionism, capital 

outflows and financial market disruption. This is a 

notable risk for those with higher external 

vulnerabilities as well as greater trade 
and 
financial linkages with the US. Even in the 

absence of adverse policy shifts, increased 

uncertainty and draining confidence 
could 

potentially weigh on investment decisions.
 Concerns regarding future developments in China 

also remain because of long
-sta
nding risks 
surrounding its economic transition and the 

correction of large accumulated imbalances. The 

short
-term outlook for China appears fairly 
buoyant and sentiment has improved somewhat 
in 

recent months. However, rapid domestic credit 

growth and cont
inued reliance on stimulus 
measures are increasing
 the
 risks of a disorderly 
adjustment.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2017
   20 3. FINANCIAL MARKETS
 Global financial markets have 
rediscovered
 some 
optimism
 since the autumn,
 driven by improving 
macro
-economic data, a pick
-up in inflation, and 
boost
ed by high expectations of the pro
-growth 
policy 
statements 
(including deregulation, cutting 
taxes, and an infrastructure investment program) 
announced by the new US 
administration
. Global 
government bond yields have 
risen
 significantly, 
but remain low
 ove
rall
, while most equity markets 
have yielded positive returns. Banking shares 

outperformed the broad market amid the 

steepening of the yield curve. Monetary policy
 has
 remained very accommodative globally, while the 

US dollar has seen a broad
-based strengt
hening on 
the back of rising expectations of a faster removal 

of 
monetary accommodation in the US. 
 Growing divergence between monetary 
policies on the two sides of the Atlantic– 
Following the December 2016 monetary policy 
decisions of the ECB and the US Federal Reserve, 

a growing divergence in monetary policy 

trajectories between the euro area and the US can 

be expected in the short term. As already described 

in the previous section, the US Federal Reserve 

raised its target range for the policy rate by 25
 bps. 
to 0.75% in December. This was the second rate 

hike in ten years and had been long priced in by 

financial markets. While the US F
ed considered 
that three rate increases would be needed in 2017 

(compared to two previously), a somewhat slower 

pace of mo
netary policy normalisation is implied 
by the Fed Fund futures (i.e
. 
two interest rate 
hikes). Against this background, the US Federal 

Reserve Chair, Janet
 Yellen
, 
also warned that it 
would be unwise to 
raise rates too quickly
 (as 
implied by some monetary 
policy rules such as 
the 

Taylor rule) as the reduction over time of the US 

Federal Reserve
™s asset holdings, bought under its 
large
-scale asset purchase programmes, would 
amount to a 
ﬁpassive
ﬂ 
policy tightening.
 In the euro area, the ECB decided at its December 

2016 meeting to extend its purchases under the 

asset purchase programme (APP) until at least 

December 2017 with the aim 
of maintaining 
the 
substantial degree of monetary accommodation 

needed
 to secure a sustained convergence of 
inflation
 towards its target rate of close to, but 
below 
2%, 
over the medium term. While the 
monthly pace of purchases will be lowered
 from 
EUR 80bn
 to 
EUR
 60 bn from April 2017
, 
the 
ECB announced its intention to increase the size 

and/or duration of the programme should the 
outlook become less favourable or if financial 

conditions become inconsistent with further 

progress towards a sustained adjustment in the 

path of 
inflation
.  
The extension of the purchases until at least 

December 2
017 will result in additional monetary 
accommodation (i.e. via the creation of central 

bank reserves) while at the same time allowing for 

a more sustained market presence of the central 

bank and, therefore, a more lasting transmission of 

the stimulus measu
res.
 (
21) 
According to the ECB, 
the calibration of monetary policy measures 

reflects the moderate but firming recovery of the 

euro area economy and still subdued underlying 

inflationary pressures. Furthermore, the lower pace 

of asset purchases 
from
 April 20
17 
onwards 
may 
also help
 to address concerns about ultra
-loose 
monetary policy and its adverse impact on bank 

profitability. In this respect, the broadening of the 

eligible universe of euro area government bonds to
 
include
 shorter maturities 
is indicative 
of the 
ECB
™s preference for a steeper yield curve, given 
its possible positive implications for bank 

profitability. At the same time, the ECB
™s forward 
guidance on policy rates, according to which they 

should stay at current or lower levels well past the 

horizon of 
the
 APP
, should help contain upward 
pressures on short
- 
and long
-term interest rates.
 Monetary policy also remained accommodative in 

the EU countries outside the euro area amid higher 

inflation and increasing inflation expectations. In 

the UK, th
e Bank of England
™s Monetary Policy 
Committee maintained 
its 
policy rate at 
the
 record
 low
 of 0.25% and decided to continue its 
previously
 announced asset purchases for 
monetary policy purposes with both headline and 

core inflation reaching 1.6% at the end
 of 2016. 
Inflation also increased in most East
ern
 European 
countries at the end of last year
, reaching 2% in the 
Czech Republic, and
 broadly reversing the 
previous trend of lower inflation. 
                                                            (21) 
To ensure a smooth implementation of the APP, the ECB 
also decided to adjust some technical parameters of the 
APP as of January 2017. The
se changes
 consisted of a 
broadening of the maturity range of the public sector 

purchase programme to include securities with a minimum 

remaining maturity of one year while purchases of public 
sector securities with a yield below the deposit facility rate 
are to also
 be permitted to the 
ﬁextent necessary
ﬂ. 
EA and EU outlook
   21 –with only a limited impact on the euro. 
While the euro remained
 broadly unchanged in 
nominal effective terms (NEER) over the past few 
months, it has been generally weaker against the 

US dollar, dropping to below the 1.04 mark in 

mid
-December 2016 mainly driven by 
the 
broad
-based strengthening of the US dollar 
since
 the US elections. The euro has subsequently 
recovered part of its losses against the US dollar 

and also strengthened somewhat against the pound 

sterling amid persistent uncertainty surrounding 

the outcome of the 
Brexit negotiations 
as well as 
the policies of
 the
 new
 US 
administration
. 
Meanwhile global financial markets have 
turned more optimistic 
In the past few months, markets have started to 
embrace a new paradigm of stronger growth, 

higher inflation and higher natural interest rates 

following the US elections. 
 In Europe, market perceptions of an improving 

economic outlook, sustained ECB asset p
urchases 
and the expected tailwind from the US have lifted 

government bond yields and led equity markets 

higher (see Graph 
I.18
). Euro area sovereign bond 
spreads widened somewhat on account of 

heightened perceived political risks in some euro 

area countries. All that led to moderately widening 

spreads to the German bund for most euro area 

countries. However, despite the recent rise in bond
 yields, still almost EUR
 4 
trillion of euro area 
sovereign bonds trade at negative yields. Euro area 

corporate bond spreads versus German bunds have 

picked up amid supply pressures and softer 

investor demand, and despite the ECB
™s ongoing 
purchases (see G
raph 
I.19
). The widening of 
spreads was more pronounced in the high
-yield 
(lower grade) segment. 
  In Asia, Chinese stock markets 
initially did not 

participate in the broad upward move following 

the US elections. However, they have recently 

picked up after strong macroeconomic data 

releases. Further, amid the rising US dollar, 

monetary authorities in several emerging markets 

had to i
ntervene in some form to defend their 
currenc
ies
.   The market performance of the last few months 

should also be assessed in the light of sustained 

exceptionally accommodative stance of monetary 

policy in several parts of the world, including the 

euro ar
ea. (
22) While investor confidence has 
strengthened, financial markets in the near future 

may be challenged by several factors, such as the 

outcome of upcoming elections in major EU 

economies, (remaining) fragilities in emerging 

markets, unforeseen shifts in market expectations 

relating to US monetary policy, or inflation 

surprises, a rise in geopolitical tensions, a possible 

increase in commodity prices amid the instalment 

of an OPEC production cap, the phasing out of QE 

globally, among others.
 The 
ECB
™s low rates continue to impact bank 
lending positively– 
Euro area banks have been further lowering 

interest rates to non
-financial corporations (NFCs) 
and households over the past year
, contributing 
to 
the gradual recovery in lending volumes in the 

euro area
 (
see Graph 
I.20
). Net lending flows to 
                                                           (22) 
Indeed, while the US Fed has started to taper, other major 
central banks are currently adding a combined amount of 
USD
 200
 billion to their balance sheet each month. The 
balance sheets of the 
ten
 largest central
 banks in the world 
now total USD
 21.6
 trillion, 10% more than at the end of 
2015.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2017
   22 households and NFCs
 continued to be positive 
over the last few months
 (see Graph
 I.21
). This 
translated into a further rise in the annual growth 
rate of loans to the private sector. Specifically, for 

the whole euro area, the annual 
growth rate of
 monetary financial institution
 (
MFI
) 
loans 
(adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) 

increased further to 2.3% in December 2016 for 

NFCs and to 2.0% for households. This suggests 

that the 
transmission of
 the
 ECB
™s accom
mo
dative 
monetary p
olic
y 
has been efficient at the overall 
level of the euro area. At the same time, broad 

money growth (M3) has continued to expand at 

around 5% 
(y-o-y) 
in recent
 months
, supported by 
a robust expansion (i.e.
 above 8% annual growth 
rate) of narrow money (M1)
.   Differences remain across euro area Member 

States with interest rates stabilising at higher levels 

in 
some countries. Such differences could partly 
explain the still uneven recovery in lending 

volumes. In Spain and Portugal, credit to NFCs is 

still sh
rinking year
-on-year, while interest rates are 
at higher levels than in other euro area Member 

States. 
Credit growth to NFCs 
in Italy 
has also 
remained negative despite low interest rates. This 

could be explained by other factors on the supply 

side such as
 balance sheet constraints (high 
non
-performing 
loans
) or 
by demand being 
lower 
than 
the euro area average.
  
The latest results from bank lending surveys 
confirm 
the 
positive trends
 visible at the euro area 
level
. The ECB
™s latest bank lending survey (BLS) 
released in January 2017 indicates that credit 

standards in the euro area tightened marginally for 

NFCs while remaining broadly unchanged for 

housing loans and continuing to ease for consumer 

credit. 
The
 slight tightening
 for corporate credit
, however, was
 due to one country in particular
: 
the 
Netherlands. Meanwhile, loan demand continued 

to improve for all loan categories, supporting 

further the credit growth for corporations and 

households. For the first quarter of 2017,
 banks 
covered by the BLS expect a net easing of credit 

standards across all loan categories and a further 

increase in net demand. The latest Survey on the 

Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE)
 (
23) 
takes 
a corporate perspective and confirms 
the views of 

banks expressed in the BLS. It signalled a further 

improvement in the availability of external sources 

of finance and in particular an increased 

willingness of banks to provide credit at lower 

interest rates. As in previous survey
s, euro area 
SMEs considered that finding customers remain
ed the dominant concern while access to finance the 

least important problem that they faced. 
  Looking 
at the next two years, the situation in the 
banking sector 
is expected 
to 
remain an important 
factor 
for credit supply, 
particularly in some 
Member States where banks face balance sheet 

constraints. Overall, euro area banks have further 

improved their capacity to support lending as they
 have
 continued to adjust to regulatory and 
supervisory actions by strengthening their ca
pital 
positions and reducing the risk on their balance 

sheets. In addition, the ECB
™s policies continue to 
help banks by offering attractive price conditions 

for their funding. Meanwhile demand for credit is 

picking up across all euro area countries
, 
which
 should enable credit volumes to rise further over 

the coming quarters, tracing the economic cycle. 
 In the euro area, the overall impact of a steepening 
of the yield curve on the net interest margin can be 
                                                           (23) T

slow

, 
depending on 
each 
bank
™s balance 
sheet structure and market characteristics. For 

instance, where fixed
-rate loans dominate 
mortgage markets, banks can benefit more from a 

steeper curve. 
Also,
 banks that rely more on 
deposits to finance their assets could minimi
se the 
negative effects of a steeper curve on their 

liabilities, as long as the
ir deposit base is stable. 
On account of a strong decrease in bank
™s trading 
activities in recent years, unfavourable asset price 

fluctuations would be expe
cted to play 
only a 
minor role
. (
24) The decline in trading book 
activities would suggest that benefits materialise 

more quickly than in the past but still at
 a 
limited 
pace, as new higher lending rates can only be 

agreed for new contracts (either rollover or new 

business).
 –while NFC
™s can 
rely on both market and 
banking 
funding. 
Market funding 
has 
continued to expand in the 
euro area. Monthly flows of net issuance of 

corporate bonds and equity 
have 
stayed positive 
over the last few months. Yet market conditions 

have slightly deteriorated over the last three 

months, particularly on bond markets, where yields 

have risen 
somewhat. The yearly growth rates of 
debt se
curities to NFCs trends at 6%
, 
while that of 
equity issuance slowed down slightly to 0.7%. 

After a period of several years during which 
euro 

area NFCs relied more on 
market instruments 
for 
their external debt funding
, bank lending is 
recovering and contributed to an equal degree over 

the last quarters
 (see Graph
 I.22
).  All in all, funding conditions should remain 

supportive for both bank an
d market funding, 
thanks mainly to the exceptionally accommodative 

monetary policy stance. Both external and internal 

funding sources are expected to support corporate 

investment over the forecast horizon. Corporate 

surpluses may progressively narrow as th
e economic cycle strengthens while bank lending 

and market funding cycles are expected to 

accelerate.

follow
ing the 
sharp fall 
in prices 
between mid
-2014 and early 
2016 and
 the lagged effects of the euro
™s past 
depreciation
, which
 mainly took place in early 
2015. The
 very accommodative monetary polic
ies 
since
 2014 and the 
broadly neutral 
fiscal policy 
stance
 hav
e also provided considerable support
. These factors have been complemented by 
additional policy measures, such as the Investment 

Plan for Europe, announced in 2014, and 

additional
 public spending
 in 
some 
Member States
, linked to the
 arrival of
 an exceptional large number 
of 
asylum seekers between mid
-2015 and spring 
2016. At the same time, past reforms 
implemented 

in some Member States 
have
 started
 to pay
 off.
 In early 2017
, many of the aforementioned factors 

remain in place, but 
there is increasing evidence 

that the
 strength
 of their support
 is fading.
  Oil prices, 
though still
 low, 
have been on the 
rebound
. Compared to a year ago, oil prices 
have almost doubled and oil price assumptions 

foresee a further increase over the for
ecast
 horizon. In that regard, 
OPEC
™s 
decision to 
lower oil production, taken in September
 2016, and the agreement on implementation details in 

November
, 
point to supply constraints. 
Whether the removal of environmental 

regulations and deregulation in the US en
ergy 
sector could lower production costs
 and
 pull 
down break
-even prices, remains unknown.
  The external value of the euro is lower than a 
few years ago. The depreciation vis
-à-
vis the 
US dollar continued in the wake of the US 
elections but was partly offse
t in January 2017. 
The euro has also 
weakened somewhat
 against 
the pound sterling 
since October
, but all these 
effects were mitigated by the euro
™s 
appreciation against the Japanese yen and the 

currencies of several emerging market 

economies. Future asynchronous monetary 

policies in the US and in the euro area are 

already priced in by markets. In all, the future 

related 
gains in price competitiveness
 appear to 
be rather limited and moreover it cannot be 

taken for granted that trade flows are as 

sensitive to exchange rate changes as they 
have 
been in times of less developed 
global value 

chains.
  Monetary policy remains very accommodative 
in the euro are
a and several other Member 
States. Monetary policy is supportive of growth 
and is expected to remain so over the coming 

years. It lowers financing cost and eases access 

to funding, but it also facilitates deleveraging. 

The ECB
™s 
decision in December to pro
long its 
APP
 at least 
until

   25 According to the ECB, past non
-standard 
monetary policy measures are estimated to 
have a cumulated positive impact on real GDP 

of about 1.3
 pps. over a three
-year 
horizon.
 (
26) 
Another positive impact could stem from the 

steepening of the euro area yield
™s curve, 
which has started easing pressures on bank 

profitability.
  Fiscal policy has significantly eased in recent 
years and is 
expected to
 remain 
broadly 
neutral
.  –despite an increasing number of growth 
hindrances. 
The power of these supportive factors has been 
constrained by a number of European and non
-
European growth hindrances. Some of the 

European hindrances are (still) crisis related such 

as the large amount o
f non
-performing loans in 
several Member States, whereas others have 

occurred more recently
, 
such as policies and events 
that have strengthened the backlash against 

European integration. The UK vote to leave the 

EU can be summarised under this heading. Whi
le 
the UK economy has been growing stronger than 
                                                           (26) 
This impact was 
mentioned
 by 
ECB President Mario 
Draghi at the press conference on 9 
December 2016 during 
the Q&A session. 
 expected since the referendum, it has created 

substantial uncertainty, which is expected to 
have 
a negative impact on economic growth over the next 

two years
, primarily 
in the UK but to a 
lesser 
extent in th
e rest of Europe
 too
.  Non
-European growth hindrances include the
 weakness of global trade, particularly related to 

slowing economic growth in several emerging and 

developing market economies and
, 
more recently, 
to the revival of isolationist and 
recent 
protectionist statements 
in some countries such as 
the
 US, which has 
withdraw
n from 
the 
Trans
-Pacific 
Partnership trade deal. 
 Measures of political uncertainty such as the 

Baker
-Bloom index 
show a clear upward trend 
since 2014, with 
exceptional
 increase
s 
in 
uncertainty following the UK leave vote and the 

US election (see Graph
 I.24
). While the index has 
decreased since then, 
it 
remained at a very high 
level in January 2017
. This high uncertainty could 
significantly dampen activity, and notably 

investment.
 (
27) 
In addition to the aforementioned growth 

hindrances, there is evidence that slower trend 

growth had already emerged before
 the crisis, 
                                                           (27)

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2017
   26 linked to a long
-term downward trend in 
productivity, related to factors such as hours 
worked per employee and demographic change 

(see section I.5). Although the European economy 

has shown resilience to several challenges, there 

remains substa
ntial slack in the economy and there 
is a lot of scope for further expansion.
  The pace of economic growth has increased in 
recent quarters– 
The second half of 2016 
saw
 a steady increase in 
the pace of economic growth. In the euro area, 
GDP increased by 0.3% in 2016
-Q2, 0.4% in 
2016-Q3 and, according to Eurostat
™s Preliminary 
Flash estimate, by 0.5% in 2016
-Q4. Overall, GDP 
in 2016 is expected to have grown by 1.7% in th
e euro area, in line with the autumn forecast. 

Meanwhile, economic growth in the EU increased 

from 0.4% (q
-o-
q) in 2016
-Q2 to 0.5% in 2016
-Q3 
and, according to Eurostat
™s Preliminary Flash 
estimate, to 0.6% in 2016
-Q4. For 2016 as a 
whole, GDP in the EU in
creased by 1.9%, slightly 
higher than 
in 
the autumn forecast. This reflects 
the surprisingly robust economic growth in the 

UK. Overall, the growth momentum has proven 

rather resilient to the slowing of global trade and 

the 
rise in 
political uncertainty.
 In interpreting GDP figures, attention has to be 
paid to the strong influence of Irish national 

account data,
 which have been rather exceptional. 
The statistical re
-classification of some activities 
of multinational firms 
is behind strong annual 
and 
quarterl
y data, including 
GDP growth of 26.3% in 
2015, 
and 
a 
38.9% 
rise in investment in 
2016-Q2. 
Despite the relatively small weight of Irish GDP in 

the euro area and EU aggregates, the size of 

changes makes developments in Ireland a key 

determinant of aggregate 
figures. GDP growth in 
the euro area without Ireland is expected to have 

increased from 1.6% in 2015 to 1.7%, in 2016 

whereas the 
overall 
euro area aggregate signals 
slowing growth in the respective years (from 2.0% 

in 2015 to 1.7% in 2016). In the EU, GDP growth 

without Ireland remained stable at 1.9% 
in 2015 

and 2016, compared to
 decreasing growth 
in the 
aggregate 
with Ireland. 
 –and is expected to remain almost 
unchanged in the short term– 
The acceleration of GDP towards the end of last 
year had been signalled by 
both 
‚soft
™ 
(survey) and 
‚hard
™ 
high
-frequency indicators.
 The European Commission
™s Economic Sentiment 
Indicator (ESI), as well
 as the composite output 
Purchasing Managers
™ 
Index (PMI), increased in 
the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 

and sustained their high levels in the beginning of 

this year. In January 2017, the ESI in the euro area 

remained broadly stable, st
anding at 107.9, its 
highest level since March 2011. In the EU, the ESI 

slightly decreased (
-0.4 
pts.) to 108.5, but 
remained well above the level of the fourth quarter 

of 2016 when the index had sharply rebounded due 

to the survey readings in the UK (
whic
h followed a
 sharp fall in the wake of the UK referendum in 

June). The increased optimism of survey 

respondents 
can be traced back to 
forward
-looking 
assessments such as production expectations and 

order books, which bodes well for economic 

growth in the f
irst quarter of 2017. 
However, 
when 
drawing conclusions 
about the implications for 

economic growth, possible breaks in the 

relationship between qualitative survey (
‚soft
™) and 
quantitative (
‚hard
™) data during the crises years 
need to be taken into account
. Recent 
analys
es 
suggest that
 the current level of the ESI hints at 
lower growth rates
 than the same level of the ESI 
would have hinted at before the economic and 

financial crisis began in 2007 
because respondents
™ 
expectations have shifted down into a ne
w normal 
where less is expected (see Box
 I.2). 
The Eurozone Flash PMI Composite 
remained
 unchanged in January at 54.

but
 stood 
higher than 
in 2016
-Q4 (53.9) and 2016
-Q3 (53.1), reflecting 
only marginally changed readings in the 

manufacturing (up 0.
3 
pts. to 
a 69-month high of 
55.2) and no changes in 
the services component 
(stable at 53.7

EA and EU outlook
   27 Some hard data a
lso signal a slightly more 
dynamic start to the year. The survey data on 

capacity utilisation in the first quarter of 2017 

(based on responses in January) pointed to a 

continued increase in the manufacturing sector and 

a stabilisation, though at a high lev
el in services. In 
October and November, industrial production in 

the euro area was on average up by 1.0% over the 

third quarter (when it had increased by 0.5% over 

the previous quarter). In a similar vein, euro area 

retail sales were up by 0.9% on average
 in October 
and November compared to the third quarter. 
  The forward looking 
nature of 
these indicators
 suggest
s 
a robust
 economic expansion in the first 
quarter
 of 2017
.  –bound for growth of close to but below 2% in 
2017-2018– 
Over the forecast horizo
n, the European economy 
will no longer be able to rely on the exceptional 
level of support from some of the external factors 

from which it has been benefiting. In 2017, euro 

area GDP 
growth 
is expected to 
ease 
marginally on 
the back of slowing growth in pr
ivate consumption 
(down 
from 1.9% to 1.5%
 in the euro area
) 
that
 proved to be its main growth driver
, and in 
government consumption (from 2.0% to 
1.4
%). While i
nvestment 
growth is projected to remain 
broadly unchanged 
(from 2.8% to 
2.9
%), the 
contribution of net exports 
to GDP growth 
is set to 

turn neutral 
(from 
-0.1
 pps.)
 (see Graph
 I.26
). Base 
effects in energy prices are
 expected to drive up 
headline inflation and to impact negatively on 

household real disposable incomes. Investment is 

expected to 
remain restrained
 by the 
still 
moderate 
demand outlook 
as well as 
the high
 level of 
uncertainty 
surrounding
 the unfolding 
‚Bre
xit
™ 
process and the unknown details of future US 
policies. Companies, but also consumers, may 

delay or abandon spending decisions, particularly 

in the UK, but also in other Member States.
 (
28) 
On 
the euro area
™s external side, the expected slowing 
of economic growth in the UK economy is set to 

offset partially the positive impact of the gradual 

strengthening in global activity on euro area 

exports. In 2017 and in 2018, the expansion in the 

euro area and in the E
U is expected to 
continue to 
be led by domestic demand.
  After having grown by 1.7% in the euro area 

(1.9% in the EU) in 2016, GDP is expected to 

grow by 1.
6% in 2017 (
1.8
% in the EU). 
 In 2018, 
GDP 
is set to accelerate slightly in the 
euro area (to 1.8%
) and to remain unchanged in the 
EU at 1.8%. 
 Potential growth is expected to remain subdued, 

reflecting the legacies
 of the crisis discussed 
earlier
, but also slow total factor productivity 
growth and demographic factors. It is set to be at 

1.2% in 
both 
2017 and 2018 in the euro area (1.4% 
in the EU). The negative output gap is therefore 

expected to narrow over the forecast horizon and 

should be
 closed in 
both areas 
in 2018
. 
–with diminishing growth differences across 
Member States. 
The economic recovery has been rather 
uneven 
across EU Member States, reflecting the
ir different 
starting positions and different exposure
s 
to the 
most devastating developments in the crisis years.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2017
   28 The picture is more homogeneous in the euro area, 
where in most cyclical phases
, 
the Member States 
moved in the same direction during the periods of 

contraction and expansion. 
 More recently, the divergence of GDP growth rates 

has diminished in terms of the standard deviations 

of growth rates (q
-o-
q and y
-o-y
, see Graph
 I.27
). 
Given differences in potential growth
, 
this does not 
necessarily point to increased business cycle 

synchronisation as output gaps still differ a lot. 

Moreover, diminishing growth differences can 

endanger the convergence of living standards in 

the EU
, 
as some countries need substantially 
higher
 growth rates to succeed in catching up with 
the more mature economies.
  Looking 
ahead
, the 
US dollar
™s appreciation and 
the increase in benchmark yields could affect 

Member States in different ways and widen growth 

differences again. Different degrees o
f openness 
and uneven progress in achieving price and cost 

competitiveness imply that changes in the external 

value of the euro impact differently on the 

economic performance and on the external position 

of countries. Moreover, 
the vulnerability of 

Member 
States to a normalisation of long
-term 
interest rates will differ according to 
differences in
 terms of persistence of the crisis impact (e.g. 

remaining needs for external and internal 

rebalancing
) 
and fiscal consolidation needs, 
most 
notably in terms of 
achieving 
debt
 sustainability, 
but also differences in terms of deleveraging and 

balance sheet repair
, labour
-market situation and 
reform implementation
. This could re
-animate 
bank
-sovereign feedback loops. 
 Private consumption continues to be
 the key 
driver of the recovery– 
Private consumption remained the key driver of 

the economic expansion in 2016. On the back of 

rising real disposable incomes, it has contributed to 

the resilience of the economic recovery.
 The ongoing growth of private consumption 

reflect
s the further expansion of real disposable 
incomes and an almost unchanged aggregate 

household saving rate. Nominal disposable 

incomes gain from further improvements in the 

employment situation and nominal wage growth. 

The purchasing power of households be
nefits from 
low energy prices and
 the 
relatively low rate of 
consumer price inflation. However, in the second 

and third quarter
s 
of 2016, private consumption 
lost some momentum
 (see Graph
 I.29
).   As regards the short term, recent survey indicators 

suggest that private consumption should continue 

growing at a solid pace, making it the backbone of 

the continued expansion. The Commission™s 

Consumer Confidence Indicator increased in both 

the euro area and the EU in the fourth quarter of 

2016 compared to the previous quarter and 

continued to increase in January 2017. The 

increase in recent months mainly reflects lower 

unemployment fears as wel
l as a more optimistic 
assessment of the expected general economic 

situation, which could be associated with the 

robust performance of the euro area and the UK in 

the second half of the year. The Commission™s 

Retail Trade Confidence Indicator increased 

str
ongly in the euro area (and the EU) in the fourth 
quarter (from 0.4 to 1.8) compared to the third one. 

Although it decreased in January 2017, it remained 

in the euro area above the average of the fourth 

quarter.

EA and EU outlook
   29 Hard data suggests an acceleration of privat
e consumption in the fourth quarter. In October and 
November 2016, euro area retail sales stood on 

average 0.9% above the average recorded in the 

third quarter and at their highest level in the 

history of the series
 (see Graph
 I.29
). New 
passenger car registrations in euro area Member 

States increased at an annual rate of 2.2% in 

December 2016 (7.1% in 2016). In line with these 

developments
, loans to
 euro area
 households for 
consumption continued to expand in 
recent 

months, increasing at an annual rate of 3.9% in 

December 2016, up from 3.7% in 
November. 
  –but 
is expected to slow over the forecast 
horizon. 
In 2017 and 2018, the expansion of private 

consumption should remain underpinned by the 

acceleration of nominal disposable income. The 

growth of labour incomes is expected to benefit 

relatively more from wage and salary increases 

than in the past and less 
from increases in 

headcount employment, as employment growth in 

the euro area is expected to slow somewhat to 

1.0% in both 2017 and 2018. Non
-labour incomes 
(profit and property related income)
 are expected 
to accelerate over the forecast horizon, growing 
in 

the euro area by 
3.0
% in 2017 and 
3.1
% in 2018. 
However, the expected increase in consumer price 

inflation will dampen the 
growth of
 real disposable 
incomes in 2017 and 2018. 
 At the same time, favourable lending conditions 

for households in the euro ar
ea and, in some 
Member States, progressively lower deleveraging 

needs are expected to provide support to 

consumption growth. Past and future increases in 

house prices are set to constitute wealth effects that 

help consumption growth. 
Moreover, the 
househol
d saving rate is expected to remain 
broadly stable in the euro area in 2017 and 2018 

after having increased in 2016 as a result of the 

pass through of oil price related income gains. As 

this effect is expected to be coming to an end, it 

should exert some d
ownward pressure while 
uncertainty should continue exerting an upward 

pressure on savings.
 All in all, these factors suggest 
that 
private 
consumption
 should 
continue growing, though 
more 
moderate
ly than in 2016
 as real disposable 
income
 growth slows
.  Publ
ic consumption expected to expand 
almost in parallel with GDP 
Government consumption has been a steady 
contributor to economic growth in recent years. 

Following 
a year of
 quarter
-on-quarter growth 
exceeding that of GDP, in the third quarter of 2016 

both go
vernment consumption and GDP grew in 
the euro area by 0.4% (q
-o-
q). In some Member 
States, refugee
-related expenditures, particularly 
related government 
personnel costs
 have helped 
drive
 public consumption growth, whereas in 
others
, 
security
-related expend
itures have 
risen
. Heterogeneity across Member States is also 
linked
 to differences in consolidation needs.
 In 2016, aggregate public consumption is expected 

to have grown by 2.0% in the euro area and by 

1.9% in the EU 
(up from 1.4% in both areas in 
2015) boosted by the factors mentioned above
. A 
deceleration to 
1.4
% is expected in both areas in 
2017. As regards the largest Member States, 

slower growth is expected in all except the 

Netherlands
, 
where the expansion is projected to 
strengthen slightly
. Growth
 in public consumption 
is expected to 
remain unchanged 
in the euro area 
and to decrease slightly in the EU 
in 2018 based on 

a no-policy change assumption, according to 
which 
fiscal policy
 measures are only factored into 
the forecast if they have been adopt
ed, presented to 
national parliaments
, 
or are known in sufficient 
detail.
 Investment has remained weak throughout the 
recovery– 
Strong and increasing investment growth is an 
important 
factor in
 the sustainability of an

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2017
   30 investment has been a key factor for the subdued 
pace of growth. As a result, the share of 

investment in GDP has remained well below the 

levels seen in the years before the crisis 
(see 

Section I.1) 
and in 
comparison to its
 long
-term 
average.
 Since the beginning of the recovery in the second 

quarter of 2013
, 
investment has in total increa
sed 
by 8.2% in the euro area (10.0% in the EU), which 

is a modest increase 
in comparison 
to GDP (5.7% 

in the euro area, 6.6% in the EU) given the sharp 

declines in investment in the five year
s 
before 
(-
18.4% in the euro area, 
-17.2% in the EU) and 
the more
 moderate development in GDP during 
that period (
-3.5% in the euro area, 
-2.5% in the 
EU). 
 –with broadly slowing investment growth in 
the first three quarters in 2016. 
The assessment of recent trends in investment on 
the basis of quarterly developments re
mains 
complicated by the volatility of the series, which 

mainly reflects Irish national account data. Taking 

account of the huge swings in investment volumes 

in Ireland, the aggregates of the euro area and the 

EU
, 
excluding Irish data
, 
point 
more 
clear
ly t
o trends in investment. In the euro area excluding 

Ireland, investment growth has slowed during the 

first three quarters of 2016 (from 1.4% (q
-o-
q) in 
2015-Q4 to 0.7% in 2016
-Q1, to 0.3% in 2016
-Q2 
and 0.0% in 2016
-Q3). 
In the EU excluding 
Ireland, investm
ent also slowed o
ver the same 
period
. 
Given the substantial political support (e.g. 
very accommodative monetary policies, 

Investment Plan for Europe) this outcome could 

indicate that funding costs are 
at present not the 

main 
concern of investors
, 
so measur
es that 
improve access to funding and lower funding costs 

may have had less 
traction
. 
Several necessary conditions for stronger 
investment are met– 
The short
-term outlook for investment remains 
complicated. Survey indicators provide mostly 
optimistic readi
ngs. Confidence increased further 

in the industry, services, construction and retail 

trade sectors in the fourth quarter compared to the 

third quarter
 of 
2016, 
in both the euro area and the 
EU with all indicators exceeding long
-term 
averages. However, all sectors except retail trade 

reported increasing confidence
 in the second 
quarter
 of 2016
, while investment continued 
to 
slow. 
By contrast
, the latest Commission 
investment survey pointed to downward revisions 

to investment plans in manufacturing.
 Hard data
 provide a mixed picture. Signals can be 
extracted from the production of capital goods, a 

key series for predicting future equipment 

investment. In both the euro area and the EU, the 

3-
month
-on-3-
month rate stood in November at 
0.9% (down from 2.5% in the
 euro area in October 
and from 2.4% in the EU). As regards 

construction, the sector
™s output rose by 0.2% on 
average in October and November compared to the 

third quarter. The annual rate of growth in loans 

for house purchases in December increased further
 to 2.7%, the highest rate since end
-2011. House 
prices in the euro area in the third quarter of 2016 

increased by 1.3% compared to the previous 

quarter and by 3.4% year
-on-year. This supports 
the expectation that the adjustment in the housing 

sector is en
ding, driven by residential investment.
 In 2016, investment growth in the euro area is 

expected to have increased 
slightly 
further if 
exceptional Irish investment data are excluded 

(from 
2.6
% in 2015 to 2.7% in 2016), whereas the 
full euro area aggregate signals a declining pace of 

investment growth (from 3.2% in 2015 to 2.8% in 

2016). A key factor behind the relatively large 

difference between the data in the euro area with 

and without Ireland can be attributed to the fall in 

investment growth in Ireland f
rom 32.9% in 2015 
to 
5.0
% in 2016 (see country chapter), driven by 
the doubling of other investment in Ireland in 

2015. For the EU, the exceptional Irish data also 

had an impact but in contrast to the euro area, 

investment growth is expected to have slowed
 down in 2016 compared to 2015, with and without 

Irish data. The deceleration in investment in the 

EU, compared to the euro area, can be explained 

by the contraction in investment in Poland (
-5
.5% in 2016
) 
and the sharp slowdown in the UK in 
2016. In Poland, the contraction in investment 
appears
 mainly 
due to
 the slow
down
 in projects 
financed by EU
™s 
structural funds
, which is linked 
to the changeover to
 the new programming period
, 
and increased policy and regulatory uncertainty. In 

the UK, 
the slowdown can
 mainly be explained by 
a very weak first quarter
 in 2016
, which was 
due to 
the contraction in non
-residential construction. 
 Looking at
 the different asset classes of 
investment, only the pace of growth in 

construction investment is 
expected 
to have 
incre
ased in 2016 in the euro area, 
thanks to 
low 
EA and EU outlook
   31 mortgage rates and improved access to loans for 
house purchases. Housing investment growth is 

projected to have increased in the euro area from 

2.0 to 3.3% (from 2.0% to 
3.2
% in the euro area 
excluding Ireland).
 By contrast, construction 
investment in the EU is set to have slowed from 

2.3% in 2015 to 
1.7
% in 2016 (from 
2.3
% to 
1.6
% in the EU without Ireland), which reflects the 

contraction in Poland, Hungary and the Czech 

Republic (see country section
s) after yea
rs of 
exceptionally high investment at the end of the last 

financing period of EU funding. The deceleration 

is also explained by the sharp slowing in the UK in 

2016. Equipment investment is set to have slowed 

in the euro area from 4.7% in 2015 to 3.8% in 

2016 (from 4.7% to 3.9% excluding Ireland) and 
slightly more in the EU reflecting the broad
-based 
decline of 
growth in 
equipment investment in all 

non
-euro area countries except Denmark
 (
see 
Graph
 I.30
). 
 –but the pace of investment growth is set to 
remain moderate in 2017-2018. 
The outlook for investment in the euro area in 
2017 and 2018 hinges on the b
alance between 
the 
many favourable 
and unfavourable 
determinants
. On the one hand, there are favourable factors
 such 
as 
low financing cost
s, strengthening global 
activity, high capacity utilisation, 
recovering profit 
margins 
and policy support (e.g. by the
 Investment 
Plan for Europe)
; on the 
other
 hand
, 
there are a 
number of 
hindrances such as 
the 
high level of 
corporate and household debt in some Member 

States, the 
moderate 
outlook for demand in Europe 
and elevated uncertainty. 
 As regards the Investment Plan for Europe, the 

operations approved by 31 December 2016 

represented a total financing volume of 
EUR
 30.2
 bn.
 (about 0.2% of GDP in the EU in 
2016)
, with the largest amounts approved in Italy, 
France, Spain and the UK. Projects are spread 

across
 all Mem
ber States and they are expected to 
trigger total investment of EUR
 163.9
 bn, i.e. more 
than 50% of the 
target 
of 
EUR
 315 bn in 
investment across the EU by 2018. A growing 

number of projects are expected to move 
into the 
implementation phase over the forec
ast horizon, 

boosting both public and private investment. 
 As regards equipment investment, the unusually 
slow rebound during the 
early years of the 
recovery 
could
 suggest that the
 relative
 importance 
of factors has changed
, 
with funding costs 
becoming 
less important. Moreover, low financing 
costs can also result in activities that do not 

support investment, such as corporate stock 

buybacks. 
With 
uncertainty expected to persist at a 
high 
level, due to
 factors such as
 the Brexit 
negotiations in Europe and
 the upcoming policy 
choices of the new US administration
, the outlook 
for equipment investment remains moderate. By 

contrast, construction investment is projected to 

remain buoyant
, 
as low mortgage rates and 
rising 
household incomes are set to 
favour 
hous
ing 
investment.
 All in all, total investment is projected to increase 

in the euro area by 
2.9
% in 2017 and 
3.4
% in 2018 
(2.9
% and 
3.1
% respectively in the EU). 
Differences between aggregates with and without 

Ireland are expected to level off (less than 

±0.
1 
pps.).
 Slowing global growth and trade hampered 
European trade volumes– 
The slowing of economic growth outside the EU
, most notably in emerging market economies and 
some advanced economies, as well as the 

weakness of global trade
, 
have exerted a negative
 impact 
on 
trade volumes for both goods and 
services
 in the euro area and
 the EU, slowing their 
expansion markedly. 
 In the first three quarters 
of 
2016, export volumes 
in the euro area were 2.3% higher than in the first 
three quarters 
of 
2015 (2.7% in the
 EU)
. This 
compares to a rate of 6.7% between the first three 

quarters of 2015 and the same period in 2014
 (6.5% in the EU)
. The persistence of some lagged 
effects from movements in the nominal effective 

exchange rate of the euro has only partially 

mitigat
ed the weakness in the external

. 
While export market shares grew 
considerably in
 2015 thanks to the significant 
depreciation of the euro
, they remained broadly 
stable
 last year
. Import
 growth
 of goods and 
services 
was
 rather subdued in the first three 
quarters in 2016, growing by 3.2% in the euro area 
(3.5% in the EU) 
compared to 
6.3% (6.2% in the 

EU) in the first three quarters in 2015.
  –but 
the rebound in the external environment 
is set to push exports. 
In the near term, the negative impact of the 
past
 slowdown in emerging markets and some 

advanced economies is expected to continue 

affecting trade, though gradually to a lesser degree. 

After having deteriorated in the first two quarters 

in 2016, the assessment of export order books in 

the Commission
™s manufacturing survey in the 
euro area and in the EU improved in the third and 

fourth quarter of last year
 in line with the rise in 
global activity
. In January 2017
, 
the assessment 
continued to improve in both 
the euro area and the 
EU and stood at 
its 
highest level since mid
-2011. 
In line with this, the manufacturing PMI new 

export orders index also moved up, increasing in 

the euro area in January 2017 to 
its 
highest level 
since early 2014. The first hard data f
or 
merchandise trade in the fourth quarter signalled a 

rebound
, 
as world trade volumes in October and 
November were on average slightly higher than
 the 
average of the third quarter. Euro area merchandise 

exports 
rose 
in November to the
ir highest level 
sinc
e the Great Recession in 2008
-2009. 
Overall, 
on the back of the slowdown in global activity, 

euro
 area exports 
look likely to have slowed 
considerably
 in 2016
, 
grow
ing
 by just 
2.7
% (2.8
% for the EU), 
which is 
well below pre
-crisis levels. 
In line with this
, import growth decreased to 
3.3
% in the euro area (
3.5
% in the EU) in 2016. 
 Looking further ahead, 
the expected 
pick
-up in
 emerging market economies
 and some advanced 
economies
 should
 raise foreign demand for euro 
area exports, 
although this will be partially offset 
by the negative impact of 
expected 
slowing 
economic growth in the UK in 2017 and 2018.
 The price competitiveness of the euro area is 

expected to remain 
roughly 
stable over the forecast 
horizon, which reflects almost unchanged real unit 

lab
our costs in 2017 and in 2018 and the technical 
assumptions on 
nominal effective 
exchange rates. 
As a result, the major gain in price competitiveness 

in 2015, as measured in terms of the real effective 

exchange rate, 
should
 be preserved
 and support 
exports
 growth
. However, European exporters are 
also likely to lose marginal market shares this year 

and next in line with past trends.
 Exports of goods and services are projected to 

accelerate to 3.3% (3.5% in the EU) in 2017 and to 

3.7
% (3.8
% in the EU) in 2018
. Imports are set to 
continue following a similar pattern to those of 

exports, 
but should grow slightly faster. Imports 
are expected to rise
 3.8% in the euro area in 2017
 (3.9
% in the EU)
 and 
4.3
% in 2018
 (
4.1
% in the 
EU)
. Overall, the contribution from net exports to 
the euro area
™s economic growth is expected to 
turn neutral
 in 2017 and 
slightly negative 
in 2018. 
For the EU, net trade is expected to be 
neutral in 

both
 2017 and 2018.
 5. THE LABOUR MARKET
 The euro area labour market continues to recover, 

as su
ggested by 
increasing 
employment 
and 
fall
ing 
unemployment. 
Despite these improvements, 
unemployment rates have not yet returned to their 

pre
-crisis levels
. This suggests
 that the negative 
impact of the Great Recession of 2008
-2009 and 
the ensuing sovereign
 debt crisis (2011
-2013) has 
not yet been 
fully 
offset. Also the working hours 
per employee and underemployment indicators 

suggest that a non
-negligible labour market slack 
persists (
see Graph
 I.32). 
 Recent labour market developments 
remain 
characterised by a relatively job
-rich recovery, 
together with an unabated trend towards a higher 

share of part
-time work, and receding cross
-country differences. 
Over the next two years, 

improvements in the labour market are expected to 
continue though
 somewhat more slowly
 than in the 
period 2014
-2016. This means t

is unlikely
 to return to
 pre

during this timeframe (7.5% in the 
euro area and 7% in the EU in 2008)
. 
 The labour market continued to recover 
in 2016– Employment has been rising uninterruptedly since 

the third quarter of 2013, growing at a somewhat 

stronger rate th
an economic growth would 
normally 
suggest. In the euro area and the EU, 
employment grew by 1.3% in the four quarters up 

to the summer of 2016, the best performance in the 

latest 
eight 
years. However, in the euro area these 
developments have not yet been en
ough to make 
up for the large job losses seen during the 

recession years, and 1
.8 million jobs are still 
missing compared to 2008. 
Moreover
, the level of 
hours worked has not shown any sign of catching 

up and remains well below its pre
-crisis level in 
both
 the euro area and the EU as a whole 
(see 
Graph
 I.33
). This suggests that despite the recent 
improvements, significant slack remains in the 

labour market.
 (
29) 
Net job creation in the euro area and the EU has 

been supported by the ongoing economic 

expansion, modest wage growth, structural 

reforms, as well as other policy measures in some 

Member States. As argued in the 2016 autumn 

forecast, the responsiveness of employment to 

economic growth seems to have incre
ased in the

 recent past.
 (
30) This could be due to the rising 
importance of the services sector, as services are 
traditionally more labour intensive,
 but also due to 
the increase in part
-time work. Structural reforms 
in several Member States have also contr
ibuted to 
making the current recovery relatively job
-rich, by 
facilitating job creation and making wages more 

responsive to activity at the company level.
  –but hours worked have not picked up and 
mirror some underutilisation of the labour 

force– Yet, 
the increase in headcount employment has not 
been mirrored in the development of hours worked 
by employees
, 
which 
has 
remained broadly flat in 
recent years. In the euro area, the number of hours 

stood in the third quarter of 2016
 at about 4% 
below their pr
e-
crisis level. This can be related to 
the shift in the composition of labour towards 

sectors with a higher share of part
-time contracts 
such as services.
 (
31) In fact, in the euro area, the 
share of part
-time workers has increased by 
roughly 3
 pps. since 2
008, rising to 21.6% in the 
third quarter of 2016. This feature is particularly 

prominent among youth, for whom part
-time 
employment represents about a third of total 

employment in the third quarter of 2016 (32.6%), 

compared to 25.6% in 2008. Also, the ove
rall 
figure for part
-time employment hides an increase 
in the share of involuntary part
-time work, or 
                                                           (30)

together with the low level of hours worked per

, s
uggests that the underutilisation of the 
labour force is greater than what the 

unemployment rate only would suggest (see 

Graph
 I.34
). (
33) 
  
–while the overall unemployment rate has 
continued to decline. 
Since 2013, the unemployment rate has been 
falling steadily, mainly reflecting job creation. By 

December 
2016, the unemployment rate had fallen 
to 9.
6% of the labour force in the
 euro area and to 
8.2% in the EU, which are the lowest levels since 
May
 2009 and 
January
 2009 respectively. In the 
euro area, the unemployment rate declined by a 

further 0.2
 pps. per quarter in the third and fourth 
                                                           (32) 
Underemployment is defined as part
-time work
ers
 who 
would like to work more hours and are available to do so.
 (33) 
A broad measure of the unemployment slack would take 
into account the underemployed, the potential

persons available to work but not seeking) in addition to 
the usual 
"headline
"

 quarter of 2016, despite the slight slowd
own in job 
creation. 
 Unemployment rates have been falling for all 

categories of workers, including 
among young 
people 
and those who have been unemployed for 
more than a year (ie. 
the 
long
-term 
unemployed
). 
Although 
youth unemployment
 has continued to 
decline on average over the last 12 months
, it 
registered a slight increase 
at the end of 2016 
(notably in Spain, Italy and France)
. This slight 
increase
, 
however, is 
not 
significant enough to 
question the positive trend. In 
Dec
ember 2016
, youth unemployment 
rate
 stood 
at 2
0.9
% in the 
euro area and 18.
6% in the EU. 
As described in 
section I.1, p
ersistently elevated rates of youth 
unemployment bear the risk of long
-term skill 
erosion and scarring effects which could be 

detrimental to future
 employability. In parallel, 
long
-term unemployment
 has continued to fall 
gradually over the course of 2016, following the 

ongoing recovery in labour markets with a lag. 

However, the proportion of people unemployed for 

2 
years
 or more remains high and far 
above pre
-crisis levels. The persistence of a high level of 

long
-term unemployment in the euro area and the 
EU could continue weighing on the efficiency of 

labour market matching and increase the risk of 

high levels of unemployment becoming entrenched 

(see
 S
ection I.1
). 
More jobs expected to be created– 
Labour market conditions are projected to improve 

further over the forecast horizon, though at a 

slower pace than in the past year. Employment 

creation is set to continue benefitting from the 

domestic
-demand
 driven expansion, still relatively

   35 counterbalanced by the slow recovery of hours 
worked back to pre
-crisis levels. 
Even though 
the 
labour market situation has improved considerably 

in recent years, its outlook remains constrained by 
modes
t 
medium
-term economic prospects and a 
high level of economic and 
policy 
uncertainty in 
the short
 term. 
 The somewhat slower pace 
of 
employment growth
 expected
 may reflect a normalisation of some 
temporary factors, 
such as 
the impact of policy 
measures in some Member States like Italy and 

France. 
In a
ddition
, it could reflect more cyclical 
factors such as the maturation of the economic 

cycle in Spain, where job creation is expected to 

remain dynamic but
 to lose
 some
 momentum. 
In Germany, labour market conditions are becoming 

tight and skilled labour 
supply shortages are 

becom
ing
 more binding
. 
In the short
-term, the Commission
™s survey data on 
employment expectations continue to point to 

further net job creation (
see Graph
 I.35). 
The 
hiring intentions of firms remain above their long
-term averages in all sectors
 in both the euro area 
and the EU
. Employment expectations in the 
fourth quarter of 2016 improved in the EU
™s 
industry, construc
tion, retail trade and service 
sectors. In January 2017
, 
hiring intentions 
increased in the industry and retail sectors but 

declined slightly in the services and construction 

sectors. The level of the indicator still suggests 

continuous job creation at the
 beginning of 2017. 
In line with this, the employment component of the 

euro area
™s Composite PMI also increased in 
January to a nine
-year high, signalling strong 
employment growth 
at the start of
 the year. Also, 
consumers
™ 
unemployment fears decreased slig
htly 
in the fourth quarter of last year after having 

jumped in the third, possibly due to heightened 

economic and policy uncertainty in the aftermath 

of the UK
™s referendum outcome. In January, 
unemployment fears continued to decrease in both 

the euro area
 and the EU.
 All in all, headcount employment is expected to 

have grown by 1.3% in both the euro area and the 

EU in 2016, thanks to dynamic job creation in the 

first half of last year, the strongest momentum 

since 2008. In 2017 and in 2018, employment 

grow
th is set to moderate somewhat but to 
continue growing by 1.0% in the euro area in both 

years and by a lower 0.8% in the EU, mainly 

reflecting a strong slowdown in job creation in the 

UK and Poland.
  –and the unemployment rate should 
decrease to its lowest level since 2009. 
Labour force developments should continue 
shaping unemployment developments over the 

forecast horizon. The expected annual increase in 

the labour force of around 0.5% per year primarily 

reflects higher job market participation rates for 

women and seniors i
n line with long
-term trends, 
but also 
the 
positive effects 
from 
refugees entering 
the labour force (
particularly 
in the 
main 
destination
 countries) as well as the effects of an 
improved labour market situation (the 
‚encouraged 
worker effect
™). Nevertheles
s, unemployment rates 
in both the euro area and the EU are set to 
continue 

declining
 as job creation should outpace labour 
force growth. In 2018, the unemployment rate is 

projected to reach 
9.1
% in the euro area and 
7.8
% in the EU, the
ir lowest levels sinc
e 2009.
 The Non
-Accelerating Wage Rate of 
Unemployment (NAWRU)
, a measure
 of 
spare 
capacity in the labour market
, 
is expected to 
continue falling over the forecast horizon. Labour 

productivity growth (output per person employed) 

is expected to have reached
 a trough in 2016 
and is 
set to
 gradually recover
 in 2017 and 2018, 
reflecting the normalisation in job creation and in 

line with the pro
-cyclicality of labour productivity. 
Labour productivity growth 
is 
expected to be
 just 
0.8% in the euro area in 2018 an
d 1.0% in the EU 
compared to 1.1% and 1.6% respectively in the 

decade preceding the crisis (1997
-2007).

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2017
   36 2016, unemployment is expected to have fallen in 
all but two Member States
. In Portugal, 
Cyprus
, Greece and Spain, where unemployment remains 

particularly high, 
it fell by 1.5
 pps.
, almost 
twice 
as much as the euro area average
. In Ireland, the 

fall in unemployment was also pronounced and 

while the unemployment rate is below the euro 

area average, it still remains high according to 

Irish standards. The reduction has been more 

limi
ted in countries where unemployment was 
already low and labour markets have begun to 

tighten 
such as Germany and the UK. This 
explains the continued reduction in the dispersion 

of unemployment rates across EU countries. In 

parallel, employment growth is ex
pected to have 
been positive in all Member States but Latvia 
and 

Romania 
and to have increased in some
 such as
 France
, Italy
, 
Greece, Cyprus and Bulgaria
 where 
improvements had so far 
been 
timid
 (see 
Graph
 I.36
).   Labour market disparities across countries are set 

to recede gradually over the forecast horizon. This 

reflects differences in the initial conditions
 prior to 
the crisis but also differences in the adjustment 

mechanisms, such as prevailing labour market 

institutions, but also structural reforms put in place 

by Member States to weather shocks. Structural 

measures 
are likely to 
have 
helped improve
 the 
responsiveness of employment to GDP during the 
recovery in several euro area countries.
 (
34) 
At the 
same time, other factors
, 
such as sectoral 
differences in growth rates and job creation, as 

well as a more or less pronounced rebound owing 

to previous substan
tial job losses during the crisis
, 
                                                           (34) 
These include measures which increase labour market 
flexibility by decreasing excessi
ve employment protection, 

for example by reducing severance payments or making 
wages more 
responsive to labour market conditions
. 
may also 
help to explain the differences in labour 
market dynamism
. 
Overall, reflecting the modest economic growth 

and continued job creation, unemployment is 

projected to fall in almost all euro area countries 

over the forecast horizon, but remain high in the 

former 
‚stressed countries
™. Unemployment rates 
are expected to range from 
4.1
% in Germany to 
20.3% in Greece in 2018.
 6. INFLATION 
Harmonised Index of Consumer prices (
HICP
) 
inflation has been picking up since the second half 

of 2016 and should continue to do so in 2017 

before 
falling
 somewhat in 2018. This temporary 
rise
 mostly reflects the recovery of oil prices from 
very low levels 
at the 
end
 of 
2015 and for most of 
2016. 
The contribution from energy base
-effects is 
nevertheless expected to decrease over the forecast 

horizon 
as oil prices are assumed to stabilise in the 
second half of 2017. The recent increase in oil 

prices is also feeding into higher import and 

producer pr
ices and different components of HICP 
through second
-round effects.
 In parallel, core inflation 
(excluding energy and 

unprocessed food) 
remained 
broadly
 stable 
in 2016
 and is expected to pick
 up only gradually over the 
forecast horizon. 
The remaining slack
 in labour 
market
s 
as well as structural reforms implemented 
in some Member States have prevented 
any 

acceleration of core inflation so far
, but the 
expected 
slight increase in wages over this year 
and next
, 
as well as the 
narrowing and 
closure of 
the output gap
, should support underlying price 
pressures
 over the forecast horizon
.  As a result, HICP inflation is forecast to 
increase 
more than previously expected
 in 2017, and to 
slow down in 2018 as the gradual 
increase in
 core 
inflation does not fully offse
t the fading impact of 
higher oil prices on the energy component. 
 Inflation finally picking up– 
HICP 
inflation 
in the euro area 
rose 
in the second 
half of 2016, mostly supported by the energy 

component going back to positive territory
 towards 
the end of the year
, after having significantly 
weighed on headline inflation 
throughout most
 of 
the year. After flat or slightly negative inflation in 

the first two quarters of 2016, HICP

was gradually lifted 
by less negative energy inflation, while 

unprocessed food inflation remained robust, 

averaging 1.4% over the whole 2016
 (see

).   Core inflation remained low and stable at 0.8% in

sign 

of acceleration so far, as services and processed 

food inflation picked up only slightly (+0.1

both) and non
-energy industrial goods remained 
stable. 
 In December 2016, headline inflation in the euro 

area rose to 1.1% (y
-o-
y) from 0.6% (y
-o-
y) in
 November, mostly supported by energy inflation 

switching back into positive territory at 2.6%, 

from 
-1.1% in November. Given the incomplete 
and lagged pass
-through of energy prices into 
domestic prices, the rebound in oil prices since the 

beginning of 201
6 only started to materialise in 

inflation figures towards the fourth quarter of 

2016. The recovery of oil prices from the very low 

levels in the course of 2015 generated positive 

base
-effects in the second half of last year, pushing 
up headline inflation.
 Core inflation stood at 0.9% 
in December 2016, only slightly up (+0.1
 pps.) 
compared to November. Services inflation rose 

somewhat to 1.3% in December from 1.1% in 

November and food inflation accelerated more 

strongly to 1.2%, from 0.7% in November. 

Non
-e
nergy industrial goods inflation remained 
flat at 0.3% for the fifth consecutive month. 
 The Eurostat Flash estimate for euro area inflation 
in January 2017 stood at 1.8% y
-o-
y, up from 1.1% 
in December 2016. This is the highest rate since 

February 2013 bu
t was mostly driven, as expected, 
by a strong acceleration in energy inflation (8.1% 

from 2.6% in December). Core inflation remained 

stable at just 0.9%.
 –in line with other advanced economies. 
Outside the euro area, global inflation also picked 

up during the second half of last year, supported by 

the rebound in oil prices and producer prices 
as 

well as more 
solid growth dynamics in advanced 

economies. While headline inflation in Japan and 

in the
 US has benefitted from positive energy base
-effects, core inflation remains more subdued. In 

parallel, inflation developments in emerging 

markets have been 
weak
, with core inflation 
falling. Regarding pipeline pressures, global input 

price pressures are p
ushing output prices higher all 
along the global value chain, including in the euro 

area. 
 After a long period of continuous decline, the 

annual growth rate of import prices finally turned 

slightly positive in November 2016 (at +0.1%) for 

the first time si
nce end
-2012. While euro area 
industrial import prices had been falling 

significantly throughout 2016 on a year
-on-year 
basis, they had been recovering from the trough 

of 
-7.2% of April 2016. This turnaround suggests 
positive pressure from increasing oil p
rices and

   38 exchange rate since early November. The past 
decline in industrial import prices contributed to 

subdued producer price developments in the euro 

area which also just turned positive in November 
at 0.1% y
-o-
y (see 
Graph
 I.38
). The recovery of oil 
prices from the very low levels of 
the 
second half 
of 
2015 is likely to help stabilise both import and 
producer prices once the impact of base effects 

runs its course towards the end of 2017. 
   Moreover, given the overall high (and increasing) 

share of USD
-denominated oil imports in the euro 
area, the depreciation of the euro against the 
dollar 

is likely to drive import prices in the euro area 

further upwards into 2017, even though the
 picture 
varies quite a lot from country to country
 (
see 
Graph
 I.39
).  The profile of headline HICP should first be 
driven by energy base effects– 
Headline inflation is expected to increase sharply 
in 2017 after the first signs of rebound at the end 

of 2016. Its profile should at first mainly be driven 

by energy base effects. An almost flat quarterly 

profile for 2017 is expected though, which hides 

several factors at play. The first and third quarters 
of the year should be shaped by large positive 

base
-effects from energy inflation. Oil prices have 
recovered from their January 2016 lows of around 

30 USD/bbl to their current level of around 55 

USD/bbl.
 Compared to the autumn forecast, the 
combination of higher oil prices and the 

depreciation of the euro against the dollar is likely 

to push headline inflation higher. The assumed 

stabilisation of oil prices in the second half of 2017 

should imply a lower 
but still significant 

contribution from the energy component to 

headline inflation, decelerating from 6.3% in 

average in 2017 to 1.5% in 2018 (see Table
 I.5).

and to push headline inflation as 
well. 
Unprocessed food inflation is expected to 
remain robust at 1.
6% (y-o-y) 
and 1.
7% respectively in 2017 and 2018. 
 –before core inflation takes over– 
As the positive base effects 
from energy prices 
are 
expected to weaken by the end of 2017, the 
outlook for a gradual uptick in inflation rests on an 

expected increase in underlying price pressures. 

Even though signs of a pick
-up in underlying price 
pressures 
have 
yet to emerge, core inflation is 
expecte
d to start 
rising towards the end 
of 2017 

and support the pace of headline inflation. It is 

expected to increase 
slightly 
from 0.8% in 2016 to 
1.1% in 2017, before 
rising 
somewhat 
more 
strongly
 in 2018 to reach 1.4%
.  –supported by slightly increasing wage
 growth. 
Most of the components of core inflation are 

expected to pick up gradually over the next two 

years. First, the increase in energy prices should 

have a positive impact on energy
-intensive 
components like transport and global producer 

prices. This s
hould support non
-energy goods 
inflation
, 
which is projected to 
increase
 from 
0.4% 
on average in 2016 to 1.0% by 2018
. 
Second, inflation in services, which accounts for 

about 
two
-thirds of the euro area core inflation 
index, is also expected to pick up ove
r the forecast 
horizon, supported by slightly increasing wage 

growth. Given the still high level of unemployment 

in the euro area, wage growth per employee has 

remained rather subdued. The combination of low 

inflation, significant slack in the labour marke
t, 
weak productivity growth
 and
 the impact of labour 
market reforms in several Member States
, 
is likely 
to have prevented a sustained 
increase 
of wage 
growth. However, more recently, growth in wages 

and salaries per hour more than doubled from 

0.8% y
-o-
y in the second quarter of 2016 to 1.7% 
in the third quarter of 2016. 
The continued
 downward trend 
in 
unemployment and higher 
inflation expectations should support an 
increase 
in 
wages per head and unit labour costs over the 

forecast horizon, and push annual inflation in 

services. Moreover, the low growth in rents (an 

important component of service inflation) seems to 
have also acted as a drag.
 (
35) 
With the adjustment 
in the housing sector ending and 
headline
 inflation 
picking up, rental prices should increase
 over the 
forecast horizon. Overall, service inflation is 

forecast to increase from 1.1% in 2016 to 1.3% in 

2017 and 
1.6
% in 2018. 
 While the nominal growth rate of compensation 

per employee is expected to accelerate from 
1.2
% in 2016 to 1.8% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, the real 

growth rate should decrease from 0.9% last year to 

0.2% this year before rebounding to 0.7% next 
year as inflation slows down. This continued 

positive growth of real compensation could 

eventually exert some upward pressure on 

domesti
c prices.
 Moreover, firm
™s increased price
-setting power, and a corresponding cyclical 

acceleration in profit margins, should further 

support its recovery.
 Furthermore, the 
closing
 of the euro area output 
gap in 2018 is likely to ease its restraining impac
t 
on underlying price pressures.
 Finally, the 
accommodative monetary policy measures taken 

by the ECB are expected to support underlying 

price pressures by fostering credit growth and 

lift
ing
 inflation expectations.
 Inflation expectations have recovered– 
Compared to September, market
-based measures 
of inflation expectations have increased sharply. 

They have recovered from the lows reached during

cut

inflation
-linked swap rates at the one

one
-year ahead horizon stood at 1.2% (see 
Graph

inflation of 1.

 European Economic Forecast, Spring 2017
   40 Consensus Economics stood in January at 1.4% in 
2017, slightly up from 1.3% in October. The 

ECB™s January 2017 Survey of Professional 

Forecasters includes inflation forecast means of 

1.4% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018, up from 

respecti
vely 1.2% and 1.4% in the 2016
-Q4 
exercise. The longer
-term inflation expectations 
(for 2020) stood unchanged at 1.8%. According to 

the Commission™s surveys, selling price 

expectations in the retail and services sectors have 

continued to increase in recent
 months. In line with 
this, the euro area PMI index for input prices and 

selling prices have accelerated to their quickest 

pace since 2012.
  –in line with upward revisions in the inflation 
outlook– 
In 2016, headline inflation in the euro area 
stood at
 0.2%, which is 0.1
 pps. lower than in the autumn 
forecast, reflecting mainly a lower
-than
-expected 
fourth quarter. 
 In 2017, the faster
-than
-expected increase in oil 
prices combined with a depreciation of the 
euro 
against the dollar
 should lead to stronge
r base 
effects from energy prices compared to autumn 

and support headline inflation
, mostly
 in the first 
and third
 quarter
s 
of the year. A
t the same time
, a
s 
the contribution from the energy component 

gradually begins to slow down, core inflation is 

expect
ed to start accelerating
, 
driven by a pick
-up 
in all sub
-components, supporting headline 
inflation towards the end of the year. In 2018, the 

continued decrease of the contribution from energy 

inflation should not be fully compensated by other 

components. 
Currently, o
ur oil price assumptions 
suggest a peak in 2017
-Q4, which reflects 
the fact 
that
 oil future
s 
prices are higher for short
-term than 
for long
-term maturities. 
Hence, headline inflation 
is expected to 
decrease
 somewhat
 towards the end 
of the foreca
st horizon
. Overall, HICP inflation is 
expected to 
increase
 to 
1.7
% in 2017 (revised up 
from 1.4% in autumn) before slowing down to 

1.4% in 2018 (unchanged).
 –while inflation differentials have narrowed
 but remain. 
Aggregate HICP inflation rates mask subst
antial 
differences across euro area Member States. In 

2016, HICP inflation rates in the Member States 

ranged from 
-1.2% in Cyprus to 1.8% in Belgium. 
In 2017, inflation rates are expected to turn 

positive in all euro area Member States and to 

range from 
0.9% in Ireland and 
Slovakia to 
2.8
% in Estonia; and in 2018, from 1.0% in 
Ireland and 

Greece
 to 2.8% in Estonia. In 2018, most euro area 
countries are expected to have inflation rates 

between 1% and 2%, with the exception of 

Estonia
, Slovenia 
and Luxembourg
 which are 
expected to have inflation rates above 2%. The 

variation in inflation rates is expected to continue 

narrowing in 2017. 
 7. PUBLIC FINANCES 
The general government deficit
-to-GDP and gross 
debt
-to-GDP ratios in the euro area continued to 
decline in 2016, on the back of the ongoing 

economic expansion and historically low interest 

rates. Over the forecast horizon, the government 

debt ratio is projected to continue declining
, while 
the deficit ratio is expected to stabilise.
 The government deficit is expected to 
continue to fall, 
though 
at a slower pace in 
2017, before stabilising in 2018 
In 2016, the aggregate general government deficit 
is expected to have fallen to 1.7% of GDP in the 

euro area and to 1.9% in the EU, 
respectively
 0.4
 pps.
 and 0.5
 pps.
 of GDP lower 
than in 2015
. It 
is expected to continue to decline in both areas in 

2017, a
lbeit at a slower pace than in previous years 
and to remain 
broadly 
unchanged in 2018. In the 
euro area, the aggregate deficit (see Graph
 I.4
1) is 
expected to fall to 1.4% in 2017 and, under 
a no-policy
-change assumption, remain unchanged in 
2018 (compared to 1.7%
 in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018
 in the EU) (see Table
 I.6
). 
 The performance of individual Member States is 

expected to be quite different. The general 

government deficit is expected to have exceeded

18, based on a 
no-policy change assumption, deficits larger than 
the 3% of GDP reference value are projected in 
France and Romania. Over the forecast horizon, 

deficit reductions are expected in a majority of 

Member States, most prominently in Greece, Spain
 and Slovakia, while a large increase in the deficit 

is expected in Romania.
  Several factors explain the change in the headline 

budget balance for the euro area (see Graph
 I.42
). 
The ongoing economic expansion, as reflected by 

the improvement in the cyclical component, is 

projected to reduce the aggregate deficit in the 

euro area 
by around 0.3
 pps.
 of GDP every year 
over the period 2016
-18. (

                                                           (36) 
For an explanation of the EU methodology for adjusting 
the budget balance for the business cycle, see Mourre, G., 
C. Astarita and S. Princen (2014). 
‚Adjusting the budget 
balance for the business cycle: the EU methodology
™. European Commission, 
European Ec

Economic 
Papers 536.
 After several years of increases, the structural 
balance
 (
37) in the euro area is expected to have 
fallen by 0.1
 pps. of GDP in 2016. The structural 
deficit is expected to increase slightly f
urther in 
2017 (by 0.1
 pps.) and, under a no
-policy
-change 
assumption, in 2018 (by 0.2
 pps.) (see Section
 I.8).
  The structural balance
 (
38) continues to benefit 
from a positive impact related to the reduction in 

interest expenditure, although this effect 
is 

expected to decrease over the forecast horizon, 

from 0.2
 pps.
 of GDP in 2016 to 0.1
 pps.
 in both 
2017 and 2018. The decline in interest expenditure 

reflects depressed long
-term interest rates amid 
negative policy rates, subdued GDP growth 

expectations a
nd also non
-standard monetary 
                                                           (37) 
The structural balance corrects the headline balance for 
both cyclical and one
-off and other temporary budgetary 
factors, and hence isolates the impact of autonomous 
government policy action and interest expenditure.
 (38) 
The
 evolution of the structural balance can be broken down 
into the change in interest expenditure and the change in 

the structural primary balance.

39) The 
slight increase in the structural deficit is therefore 
explained by developments in the structural 

primary balance, which excludes interest 

expenditure, indicating a departure from the strong 

fiscal consolidation efforts undertaken in previous 

years.
  
Expenditure driving headline deficit 
developments– 
The slowdown in the reduction in the aggregate 
general government deficit
-to-GDP ratio over the 
forecast horizon is expected to be driven by the 

slower decline of the general government 

expenditure
-to-GDP ratio,
 both in the euro area 
and the EU (see Graph
 I.43
).  The government expenditure
-to-GDP ratio in the 
euro area is expected to decline over the forecast 

horizon from 47.9% in 2016 to 47.4% in 2018, 

under a no
-policy
-change assumption. This decline 
reflects factors including the reduced expenditure 

(as a percentage of GDP) on social transfers due to 

the economic recovery and falling u
nemployment, 
wage bill moderation in the public sector, and 

lower interest expenditure.
 The public investment
-to-GDP ratio for the euro 
area as a whole is set to 
edge up from 
2.6% 
to 
2.7
% over the forecast period, still standing below 
the pre
-crisis average. In some Member States, 
positive contributions to total investment growth 

are expected as projects from the new 
                                                           (39) 
An increase in the average maturity of debt has also been 
associated with a reduction in the long
-term int
erest rate. 
See, Beetsma, R., M. Giuliodori, and I., Sakalauskaite 
(2016).

programming period of EU funding enter the 
implementation phase. Also, the Investment Plan 

for Europe should have a positive impact on public 

investment over the forecast horizon. Increases in 

public investment could boost domestic demand 

and have positive spillover effects on other 

Member States.
 (
40) 
The government revenue
-to-GDP ratio 
is also 
expected to decline 
in 2017 and 2018
, 
although
 to 
a lesser extent than the government expenditure 

ratio. The revenue
-to-GDP ratio in the euro area is 
set to continue its gradual decrease from its peak 

of 46.8% in 2014 to 46.0% in 2018, under a no
-
policy change assumption. This decrease reflects 

factor
s including a reduced weight (as a percentage 
of GDP) of income taxes and social contributions, 

stemming from measures to reduce the tax burden 

on labour (
for instance in France and Italy)
.  –while government debt is set to continue to 
decline from a high level. 
In 2016, the general government debt
-to-GDP ratio 
is expected to have continued its downward trend 
to 91.5% in the euro area (85.
1% in the EU). In 
2017 and 2018, the government debt ratio is 
projected to continue declining gradually. In the 

euro area, it is forecast to decline to 90.
4% in 2017 
(84.
8% in the EU) and, under a no
-policy
-change 
assumption, to 89.
2% in 2018 (83.
6% in the EU). 
Debt reduction finds its roots both in primary 

surpluses and in a more favourable snow
-ball 
effect
, 
driven by redu
ced interest expenditure, 
modest real GDP growth
, 
and the expected uptick 
in 
inflation (
see 
Table
 I.7
). At the Member State 
level, debt is
 expected to exceed 100% of GDP in 
four Member States (Belgium, Greece, Italy and 

Portugal) over the whole forecast horizon and 
in 

Cyprus in 2016 and 2017, while it is expected to 

remain
 just below this level in Spain. While debt 
ratios are expected to dec
line in a 
vast 
majority of 
Member States, some increases are nevertheless 

projected, notably in 
France, Italy, Luxembourg, 

Finland
, Poland
 and Romania.

   43 8. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES IN THE 
EURO AREA 
Monetary conditions in the euro area 
remain 
accommodative, with
 low financing costs and 
credit supply conditions that have been easing. 

Based on the customary assumptions,
 (
41) financing conditions are set to remain 
favourable 
over the forecast horizon, further supported by 

increasing inflation rates that should lead t
o somewhat lower real financing costs in the short 

run. As regards the fiscal policy stance, it turned 

broadly neutral in 2015 and is expected to 
remain 

broadly neutral
 over the forecast horizon. These 
developments should be seen against 
the
 backdrop 
of 
a soft 
global recovery that has become 
even 
more
 subject to considerable political and 
economic risks.
 Monetary conditions are expected to remain 
accommodative 
The full implementation of the set of monetary 
policy measures introduced in recent years is 

expec
ted to 
keep 
financing conditions loose. The 
recent extension of the 
duration of the 
ECB
™s asset 
purchase programme until at least December 2017 

should ensure that nominal long
-term rates stay at 
overall low levels, additionally supported by the 

ECB
™s polic
y of reinvesting the proceeds from 
maturing securities, which should come into effect 

from March 2017. The ECB
™s asset purchases 
under the corporate sector purchases
-programme 
(CSPP) that started in June 2016
, 
should 
also help 
to ease financing conditions 
for non
-financial 
corporations directly as well as indirectly through 

portfolio rebalancing effects, e.g. by freeing up 

space in bank balance sheets for lending to SMEs. 

At the same time, the effects of the negative 

deposit facility rate on money markets a
nd lending 

conditions should be reinforced by the growing 

excess liquidity generated through the asset 

purchases, thereby exploiting the synergies 

between the different policy instruments in the 

transmission of the effects of the ECB
™s asset 
purchases to t
he real economy through both banks 
and financial markets. Indeed, in the money 

market, the overnight rate (EONIA) continued to 
                                                           (41) 
The interest rate assumptions underlying the forecast are

-based; nominal exchange rates are assumed to

 trade closely above the ECB
™s deposit facility rate 
over the past months, reflecting the high and still 
growing excess liquidity in the banking system. 

Similarly, the three
-month Euribor declined only 
marginally towards the end of last year, leaving the 

three
-month Euribor

vernight 
Index 
Swap
 spread, a measure of interbank market stress, 

broadly unchanged. 
 In real terms, short
-ter
m rates continued to fall 
deeper into negative territory, displaying a 
significant drop towards the end of 2016 on the 

back of the recent pick
-up in inflation (see 
Graph
 I.44
). (
42) Real long
-term interest rates 
derived from inflation and interest rate swaps, 

which have been negative since mid
-2014, have 
remained comparatively stable over the past few 

months, as increases in nominal long
-term rates 
were offset by similar increases i
n longer
-term 
inflation expectations. 
  In line with the ECB Governing Council
™s forward 
guidance on interest rates,
 (
43) overnight rates are 
expected to remain close to current levels over the 

forecast horizon, as suggested by EONIA forward 

rates. As 
inflation is expected to increase further, 

this should altogether lower real short term interest 

rates. At the same time, forward rates suggest a 
                                                           (42) 
Real rates are derived from the respective short or long
-term rate minus annual HICP inflation and expected 
average inflation according to 10
-year inflation swaps, 
respectively. Forecasts are derived 
from 
futures and 
forward rate
s, 
deflated by the inflation forecast and market
-based measures of inflation.
 (43) ﬁThe Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB 
interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an 
extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the 
net asset purchases.

   44 gradual increase in nominal long
-term rates over 
the forecast horizon. However, due to increased 
long
-term inf
lation expectations, real long
-term 
rates should further decline in 2017 before edging 

up in 2018 while remaining in negative territory.
 While there is no single indicator which is able to 

fully 
reflect the monetary policy stance at the 
current 
juncture, two indicators are presented 
here.
 (
44) The 
shadow interest rate is displayed as 
an approximate measure of the monetary policy 

stance in times when the policy rate is restricted by 

the lower bound on interest rates (see Graph
 I.45). 
While the overall level of the shadow rate should 

be interpreted with caution,
 (
45) its change over 
time nonetheless illustrates the support provided 

by the conventional and unconventional monetary 
policies pursued by the ECB in recent years. In 

particular, the accommodative effect of the ECB
™s 
expanded asset purchase programme that started in 

March 2015 is reflected in a steep downward 

movement in the sh
adow interest rate, while the 
                                                           (44) 
Monetary policy uses a variety of (standard and non
-standard) tools, affecting various economic variables with 
different and time
-varying lags. Any indicator reflecting 
the monetary policy stance or 
monetary conditions 

therefore bears the risk of oversimplifying a complex 
reality.
 The shadow interest rate is a hypothetical estimated 
short term rate that would be consistent with the OIS curve 
term structure in the absence of a lower bound on interest 
rates. The estimates presented here are based on the 
methodology of 
Krippner, L. (2016), 
‚Documentation for 
measures of monetary policy
™, Reserve Bank of New 
Zealand. 
There are considerable uncertainties in particular 
surrounding the level of shadow rate es
timates, which 
should therefore be interpreted cautiously.

(2016).

. 
slight uptick at the current juncture is the result of 
the recent steepening of the yield curve.
 (
46) 
 The transmission of these developments to the 

nominal financing conditions in the non
-financial 
private sector is captured by the composite credit 

cost indicators (CCCI)
 (
47) for non
-financial 
corporations and households (see Graph
 I.46
). 
While credit costs decr
eased further for households 
over the past months, they remained broadly 

unchanged on balance for non
-financial 
corporations, owing to increasing yields on 

corporate sector bonds that compensated further 
                                                           (46) 
To the extent that this reflects factors outside of the control 
of monetary policy, it should not be interpreted as a 
tightening of the monetary policy stance. While part of the 

recent steepening of the yield curve might be due to
 the 
ECB™s December monetary policy decisions and can thus 

be attributed to monetary policy, it also likely reflects a 
global rise in inflation expectations on the back of 
increased oil prices 
and increasing expectations of a fiscal 

sti
mulus in the US unde
r the new
 administratio
n.
 (47) 
The CCCIs are calculated as weighted averages of interest 

rates on different types of bank loans and corporate bonds 
(in case of non
-financial corporations).

  Fiscal policy is no longer restrictive 
The fiscal stance in the euro area, as measured by 
the change in the structural balance, stopped being 

restrictive in 2015 and 
is expected to remain 

broadly neutral
 over the forecast horizon.
 The 
discret
ionary fiscal effort, which is an alternative 
measure of the size of discretionary fiscal policy 

(computed by adding up discretionary measures on 

the revenue side and by measuring the gap 

between potential growth and expenditure growth 

on the expenditure s
ide) signals the same departure 
from the strong fiscal consolidation efforts 

undertaken in previous years (see Graph
 I.47
).  The picture varies significantly 
across 
individual 
Member States. 
Individual countries are widely 
dispersed in terms of the change in their structural 

balance in 2017 (see Graph
 I.48
). 
The projected 
change in the structural balance is largely 

uncorrelated with the level of the output gap, even 
in the Member States in which the output gap 
has 

been negative for several years.
  The policy mix 
in the euro area in 2017 reflects the
 interplay between financing conditions and fiscal 

policy (see Graph
 I.49
). The additional measures 
taken by the ECB since the end of 2014 have 
continued to exert
 downward pressure on nominal 
long
-term rates. However, monetary easing was 
only partially transmitted to real rates as long
-term 
inflation expectations also declined. For 2017, real 

long
-term ra
tes (derived from the 10
-year swap 
rate deflated by inflation expectations) are 

expected to decline marginally as inflation 

expectations pick up. At the same time, as 

illustrated by the discretionary fiscal effort, fiscal 

policy has significantly eased 
in 
recent
 years and is 
not expected to become restrictive.
 Overall, the policy mix in the euro area should be 

considered in the context of a soft global recovery 

and elevated uncertainty.

   46 9. RISKS 
The macroeconomic and financial landscape is 
being strongly 
challenged and uncertainty 
surrounding these wi
nter 2017 projections is 
exceptional, associated amongst other
 things with
 the expected sharp shift in US polic
ies
, the 
uncertain outcome of the UK
™s ‚Brexit
™ 
negotiations
, increasing monetary policy 
divergenc
e at the global level
 and
 upcoming 
elections 
in large Member States
. 
Downside risks 
to the growth outlook have intensified since the 

autumn, but along with that upside risks have
 also
 emerged. 
However, the factors supporting these 
upside risks in the short
 term 
could generate other 
problems of their own later on (economic policies 

in the US, the aftermath of the UK leave vote and 

growth stimulus measures in China)
. 
The growth outlook is subject to huge 
uncertainty– 
On the external side, uncertainty and risk
s to the 
outlook have increased greatly since the autumn 

forecast
 and include 
also 
some tangible upside 
risks. First, in the short term, the eventual package 

of US fiscal stimulus and pro
-business reforms 
could 
provide a stronger near
-term boost to US and 
global GDP than currently expected. However, for 

the medium term, new downside risks have also 

emerged related to potential disruptions associated 

with shifting US positions on trade policy, a faster 

reversal of the US monetary policy stance and its 

impact
, 
especially on emerging markets. 
A stronger
-than
-expected rise in the US dollar would 
hit emerging markets with unhedged US
D- 
denominated debts by making such debts far more 

burdensome to pay
.  
A sudden and abrupt drop in global risk appetite 

and sharp an
d sustained rise in global risk premia 
are another
 downside risk. The search for yield 
fuelled by the exceptionally low interest rate 

environment has lifted prices of assets in most 

market segments, including in the EU. Risk premia 

are quite compressed des
pite several uncertainties
, 
and a re
-assessment of these compressed risk 
premia could cause significant turmoil in global 

financial markets, triggering a very adverse 

feedback loop to the real economy and the 

financial sector.
 These risks come on top of (a
nd partially 

reinforce) long standing concerns
, 
including risks 
of a disorderly adjustment in China
 (see 
Box 
I.1
), a 
more protracted slump in emerging market 
economies reflecting ongoing fiscal adjustment 

pressures and domestic imbalances, as well as 

polit
ical uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. 
The 

materialisation of 
these risks 
would 
affect the euro 
area and the EU more negatively than currently 

expected. 
 On the domestic side, the UK 
‚leave
™ 
vote 
continues to pose a significant downside risk to the 

UK and
 to a lesser extent
 the overall European 
economy. While GDP growth in the UK has so far 

remained robust 
since 
the referendum, the sharp 
increase in policy uncertainty related to the exit 

scen
arios is expected to persist and to weigh on 
economic activity over the forecast horizon. 

Domestic downside risks to the outlook also 

include political uncertainty in view of upcoming 

elections 
in large Member States
. Also, banking 
fragilities remain a concern. The low profitability 

of European banks remains a structural problem
, even though the recent steepening of the yield 

curve provides limited relief
. Renewed tensions in 
the banking sector
 are not excluded
. Finally, the 
risk of remaining stuck in a low
 growth, low 
inflation equilibrium due to self
-fulfilling 
expectations remains.
 –and the balance of risks remains titled to the 
downside. 
Overall, the uncertainty around the growth 
projections is larger than at the time of the autumn 

forecast. This can be 
seen in the fan chart (see 

Graph
 I.50
) which depicts the probabilities 
associated with various outcomes for euro
 area 
GDP growth over the
 forecast horizon. The darkest 
area indicates the most likely development. While 

the intensification of risks leads to a widening of 

the confidence bands for given probabilities, the 

dominance of the downside risks can be seen in the 

asymmetry of these ban

-Uncertainty linked to the balance of risks
EA and EU outlook
   47 The inflation outlook also surrounded by high 
uncertainties 
Risks to the inflation outlook 
remain balanced
. On 
the upside, a higher
-than
-expected rise in oil prices 
due to the rebalancing in oil could push headline 
inflation further upwards. 
While 
oil prices are 
likely to play a key role in shaping the profile of 

inflation developments, there is considerable 

uncertainty about their future direction. The 

November 2016 OPEC deal covers only the first 

half of this year and its further extension for the
 whole year will be decided 
at the 
OPEC 

Ministerial 
meeting 
in May, which leads to large 
uncertainties regarding the direction of oil prices 
 for the second half of this year and forward. 

Moreover, the current price recovery may provide 

some relief and in
centives to raise output 
 for other oil producers, including 
shale producers 
in the 
US.
  
On the downside, structural impediment
s 
to wage 
growth like weak labour productivity, ongoing 

labour market reforms or the still
-high 
unemployment rate could weigh negatively on 

domestic prices and prevent core inflation from 

accelerating further and take over from the fading 

impact of high energy inflation. Moreover, the 

downside risk to the economic outlook translates 

into downside risks to the inflation outlook.

Economic growth in the Czech

household consumption growth was dampened by weaker investment activity. In 2017 and 2018, GDP is 
forecast to grow at 2.6% and 2.7% respectively, driven by domestic demand. After two years o
f subdued 
price pressures, inflation picked up in 2016 and is expected to rise further in 2017. The headline

Ireland 
-Real GDP growth and contributions
GDP growth is projected to remain firm over the forecast horizon but to gradually decelerate amid 
heightened risks and an uncertain global backdrop. Domestic demand is expected to remain the main 
driver of the economy 
supported by the improving labour market. The general government deficit is 
estimated to have fallen to 0.9% in 2016 and Ireland™s debt
-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline 
gradually, but risks to the fiscal outlook remain.

Main features of country forecast - LITHUANIA














 After a relatively weak performance in the first 
quarter
 of 2016
, closely related to the negative 
evolution of financial markets at the beginning of 

the year, economic activity gained momentum in 

the following two quarters, supported by a sharp 

improv
ement in 
the 
net exports of services, 
particularly
 financial services
. 
Based on available 
soft and hard indicators signalling a surge in the 

confidence of both households and corporations, 

growth is likely 
to 
come in strong
 in the last 
quarter of the year
. 
Over 2016 as a whole, 
Luxembourg™s 
economic 
growth is expected to 
have slightly accelerated to 3.8% 
from 
3.5% in 
2015.
  In 2017, GDP 
growth 
is expected to 
rise 
to 4.0%. 
An
 improvement in household disposable income 
should 
support private consumption exp
ansion
 growth, as
 disposable income
s benefit from the 
tax
-decreasing reform that took effect at the start 
of the year
. F
avourable financial conditions and 
strong 
employment prospects
 should
 also outweigh 
the impact of higher oil prices. Finally, household 

purchasing power 
should 
also benefit from indexed 
wage increases, which took place at the beginning 

of the year. Favourable lending conditions are 

projected to continue boosting investment. In 

particular, construction is 
expected 
to remain 
robust over the 
forecast period, supported both by 

household and public sector investment plans, the 

latter being engaged with the execution of large 
public infrastructure projects. In line with a 

recovery in capacity utilisation 
rates 
and the 
accommodative credit stance,
 an improvement in 
equipment investment is also expected. In light of 

the high share of import content in investment
, 
a slight decrease in the growth contribution of net 

exports 
is expected in 2017.
 In 2018, as the impact of the tax reform on 

households
™ p
urchasing power is set to fade away, 
private consumption is 
expected 
to lose
 some
 momentum. Economic growth is then projected to 

be sustained by a recovery 
in 
the external 
environment, especially the euro area, and growth 

is projected to 
ease
 to 3.9%. 
 Job creation remains robust In 2016, employment growth is expected to have 

accelerated to 
3.0
% from 2.6% in 2015. In line 
with the buoyant economic outlook, job creation is 

projected to remain robust both in 2017 and 2018. 

As non
-residents are likely to benef
it more than 
residents, the labour market developments will 

prove to be insufficient to substantially lower the 

unemployment rate, which will
 gradually
 decrease 
to 6.
2% by the end of the forecast horizon
 from 
6.5% in 2015
. The unemployment rate is then 
for
ecast to stabilise at that level by the end of the 
forecast horizon.
 A rebound in inflation  Headline HICP inflation 
turned out flat
 in 2016, 
mainly because of the pronounced drop in oil 

prices. As oil prices bottomed out at the beginning 

of 2016 and since
 then have progressed 
substantially, a rebound in inflation is projected in 

2017
 and in 2018, respectively 
to 
2.0
% and 
2.1
%. 
The automatic indexation of wages, triggered at 

the start of 2017, is expected to be triggered again 

in the course of next year. In
creases in the headline 

inflation are 
then expected 
to 
gradually 
push up 
core inflation, which is projected to 
increase to
 1.6% in 2017 and to hit 2.1% in 2018.

Luxembourg 
-Real GDP growth and contributions
Luxembourg™s growth is expected to remain 
close to
 4% throughout the forecast horizon. In line with 
the recovery 
in 
oil prices, inflation is projected to rebound.  Employment growth will remain solid, 
while unemployment is expected to decrease only marginally. 
Even after a tax reform
, 
that 
will 
decrease
d 
the tax burden
 overall
, public finances are projected to remain so
und.
 
 Public finances remain sound In 2016, the general government balance is 
expected to post a 
surplus of 1.
6% of GDP. Low 
inflation combined with the incremental impact of 

saving measures adopted with the 2015 budget will 

help to contain expenditure, in spite of 
the 
high 
level of public investment maintained by the 

authorities. At the same time, re
venues remained 
firm in line with the robust economic growth 

projected. 
 The general government balance is then expected 

to shrink to a small surplus of 0.2% of GDP in 

2017, mostly due to the impact of the tax reform 

that took effect at the beginning of th
e year. In 

addition to repealing the temporary budgetary levy 

introduced in 2015, tax brackets were revised to 

become less progressive, while two new tax 

brackets for high revenues were introduced. In 

addition, tax credits related to house purchases 

were i
ncreased. Moreover, the corporate income 
tax rate was reduced from 21% 
to 19% in 2017 and 
to 18% from 
2018. A m
ore favourable tax 
treatment for small enterprises 
was
 also
 introduced. All in all, the tax 
reform is 
expected to 
shave revenues by an estimated 
0.8% of GDP. 
 Finally, due to a change in legislation, the share of 

VAT revenues held by Luxembourg on 

e-
commerce related transactions will decline to 
15% from 30%. 
 Based on a no
-policy
-change assumption, 
 the surplus of the general government 
 balance is projected to 
edge
 up to 0.3% of GDP
  
in 2018. 
 The general government™s structural surplus, 

mirroring the drop in the headline balance and in 

the light of the closing of the output gap towards 

the end of the forecast period, is expected to 

narrow by 
about 2
 pps.
 of GDP 
over the forecast 
horizon
, still remaining in positive territory.
 Luxembourg debt
-to
-GDP ratio 
is expected to 
decrease from 
22.1% of GDP in 2015 to 21
.0
% of 
GDP in 2016
. It is then projected to increase to 

23.5% of GDP over the forecast horizon
 in spite of 
the regular primary surplus. The
 surplus of the 
social security sector cannot be used to finance
 the 
deficit of the central government, which is 

projected to widen from 2017 onward as for effect 

of the tax reform and thus
 has to be financed with 
new 
debt issuance

Malta™s economic growth has settled down from the exceptional levels of 2014 and 2015 but is
 forecast 
to remain well above the EU average. Unemployment is set to remain at record lows while productivity 
gains contain unit labour costs and preserve competitiveness. The budget deficit is only expected to 
improve marginally, however, as growing tax 
revenues are largely offset by rising expenditure.

The Dutch
 economy is expected to grow at a steady rate of around 2% per year over the forecast 
horizon, driven by private consumption and investment. The labour market is performing well, with the 
decline in unemployment accelerating in the final months of 2016. In
flation is rising from very low 
levels recorded in the past years. Strong revenue growth points to a small budget surplus in 2017 and 
2018. Although the outlook for the short run is strong, the balance of risks is tilted to the downside.

Investment is set to remain the main driver of growth. However, the high import content of investment

implementation of the budget consolidation plan; but then again, the reprisal this year of extensive 
public works is expected to continue to feed higher budget deficits and debt beyond
 2018.

Driven by stronger domestic demand and double
-digit export growth, GDP expanded again in 2016. 
Economic growth is forecast to pick up further on the back of rising private consumption and to be 
supported 
by continuously robust export and investment. Despite increasing pressure from stronger 
demand and higher international oil prices, price stability is expected to be preserved. Fiscal 
consolidation is envisaged to slow down, but to remain sufficient to sus
tain a further reduction of 
government debt.

A stronger loss in momentum 






















































In the third quarter of 2016, the Turkish economy shrank for the first time in seven years. Under the new 
national accounting methodology, the change in momentum is even stronger than foreseen at the time of 
the autumn forecast. Leading in
dicators suggest the economic headwinds are likely to continue in 2017. 
The depreciation of the Lira may offer some relief by supporting export growth. Uncontrolled Lira 
volatility, however, would pose a risk to the Turkish economy.

Economic growth is picking up gradually based on household spending

 Strong rebound from weak first half of 2016 Following a weak first half of the year, activity in 
the US rebounded strongly in the third quarter. 

Real GDP growth accelerated to 0.9% 
(q-o-q) 
to moderate to 0.5% 
(q-o-q) 
in t
he fourth quarter
 (in 
the advance estimate)
, 
as private consumption 
continued at a robust pace and drags from energy 

investment and inventories began to dissipate.
 K
ey 
drivers of the US economy, including private 

consumption, the labour market and business
 
investment, appear to be in place to sustain this 

relatively strong momentum into 2017.
  Election result has increased policy uncertainty The Presidential election
 has greatly increased
 uncertainty regarding the future course of 
US 
domestic and foreign
 policies
. Throughout the 
election campaign, 
the new president
 proposed 
numerous tax cuts, increased infrastructure 

investment, deregulation, a tougher stance on 

immigration, repeal of the Affordable Care Act 

and greater protection of US manufacturing from 

foreign competition. How these announcements 

translate into concrete policy actions still remains 

to be seen and will impact the 
US 
outlook 
over the 
forecast horizon and beyond. Overall, however, 

while the 
fiscal stimulus would likely boost growth 
in the short term, a shift towards more protectionist 
policies h
as the potential to dampen medium
-term 
growth prospects.
 Initial reactions from financial markets to the new 

Administration's stimulus 
and deregulatory 
proposals have been positive, 
with
 consumer and
 businesses 
confidence 
also rising
 to multi
-year 
highs.
 While there is a risk that this investor 
optimism may reverse (e.g. 
if 
actual policies fall 
short of expectations), improved confidence, if 

sustained, has the potential to materially impact on 

both consumption and investment levels.
 Near-term outlook boosted by fiscal stimulus– Although there is growing anticipation of a 

stimulus package in the near term, details 
of its 
size, timing and composition remain unclear. This 

forecast is therefore based on a 
technical 

assumption that
 
 of GDP is 
implemented in 2017, followed by an additional 

1% of GDP in 2018.
 Although providing a boost to 
growth, its benign impact w
ould 
be constrained by 
the already advanced stage of the US cycle, with 

the
 labour market
 entering 2017 at 
close to full 
employment. The re
-emergence of upward wage 
pressures over recent months further points to 

limited remaining slack.
 –offset in part by tightening monetary policy. The trend of gradually firming wage and price 

pressures, visible throughout 2016, is thus set for a 
marked upgrade. 
Assisted in part by rising energy 
prices, c
onsumer price inflation is 
expected to rise 
from 1.3% in 2016 to 
around 2.
5% 
in 2017 and 
2018
. In turn, nominal wage growth is set to 
double fro
m 2016 to 
about 
5% in 2018.
 The 
release
 of these
 pressures 
is likely 
to trigger
 an 
accelerated monetary policy tightening cycle.
 As 
widely anticipated
, the
 Fed raised its policy 
interest 
rate in December 2016 (to 0.5
-0.75%), as 
well as raising its 
projections
 for 
its future path. 
Fed expectations now suggest three hikes in 
both 
2017 and 2018
, 
prompting
 dollar appreciation and 
US Treasury bill yields
 reach
ing 2½
-year highs.

US economic growth is forecast to pick up from 1.6% in 2016 to 2.3% and 2.2%
 in 2017 and 2018, 
respectively.
 The near
-term outlook has been revised up in line with assumptions concerning fiscal 
stimulus measures. Nonetheless, the economic cycle is maturing and risks to the outlook have increased, 

particularly given the uncertain future policy directions of the n
ew Administration among key areas.
 

 A stronger 
dollar 
and
 higher 
interest rates are 
expected to 
partially offset
 the growth impulse 
provided by
 fiscal stimulus. 
In the near term, 
business investment is 
forecast
 to recover in 2017 
as higher oil prices support 
energy
-related activit
y, 
while 
surging business sentiment 
has improved 
the 
outlook for capital expenditures i
n other sectors.
 However, 
rising financing costs
 are expected to 
begin weighing on business and residential 
investment from 2018 onwards. 
 Private consumption to remain growth driver Strong labour market 
dynamics 
ensure that private 
consumption 
will continue to grow at robust rates 
over the coming period (2.
5% and 2.8% in 2017 
and 2018, respectively)
, 
with high wage growth 
providing considerable impetus. US dollar strength 

over the forecast horizon is also expected to 

contribute to a surge in import growth
; while 

export growth, although recovering moderately 
in 

line with
 rising demand among trading partners, is 
set to be constrained.
 As a result of
 these 
dynamics, the current
-account deficit is 
forecast
 to
 deteriorate by 1
 pp. 
(to 
-3.5% of GDP
) 
by 2018.
 On the whole, GDP growth is 
forecast to increase 

from 
1.6% in 2016 to around 2¼% in 
the 
2017

period. This

largely
 reflects the 
assumed s
hort
-term impacts of fiscal stimulus
. 
Even with this upward revision, however, the
 economy's signs of gradual maturation persist.
 Fiscal deficit and debt set to deteriorate– Public deficit and debt dynamics will also be 

materially impacted 
by any stimulus 
measures, 
with the deficit forecast to reach 
around
 5½% 
of 
GDP by 2018 and debt levels 
resuming their 

upward trend to reach 110
% 
of GDP
 by 2018
. 
–while other risks have increased. The principal downside risk facing the US 

economy is a potential shift 
of ec
onomic policy 

towards 
a more 
protectionist 
stance, implying 
significant losses for the US and global economy. 

On the upside,
 the size or growth impulse arising 
from fiscal stimulus measures 
and deregulation 

may be greater than currently assu

The outlook for the Russian economy has improved over recent months, driven largely by a stabilisation 
in oil prices and the rouble exchange rate. Economic activity is expected to return 
to growth in 2017

room for monetary policy easing; while persistent structural weaknesses should also limit the scale of
