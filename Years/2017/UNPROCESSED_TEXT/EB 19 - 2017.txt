 Summary
 The ECB™s
 monetary policy measures have continued to preserve the very 
favourable financing conditions that are necessary to secure a sustained 
convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the 

medium term. Incoming data since the Governing Council™s
 meeting in early March 
confirm that the cyclical recovery of the euro area economy is becoming increasingly 

solid and that downside risks have further diminished.
1 At the same time, underlying 
inflation pressures continue to remain subdued and have yet to show a convincing 
upward trend. Moreover, the ongoing volatility in headline inflation underlines the 
need to look through transient developments in HICP inflation, which have no 
implication for the medium
-term outlook for price stability.
 Available indicators point to sustained global growth at the beginning
 of 2017, while 
the recovery in 
international
 trade has continued.
 T
he global 
recovery is broadening, 
with the improvement in growth being widespread across countries. 
International
 finan
cial conditions have remained overall supportive, despite significant policy 
uncertainty. Global headline inflation has increased further, mainly driven by energy 

prices.
 However, oil prices have recently undergone some volatility.
 Euro area financing conditions remain very favourable. Comparing developments 
between the Governing Council meetings of 9 March and 27 April, bond, equity and 

foreign exchange markets overall show only small movements. 
 Incoming data, notably survey results, suggest that the ongoing economic expansion 

will continue to firm and broaden. The pass
-through of the monetary policy measures 
is supporting domestic demand and facilitates the ongoing deleveraging process. 
The recovery in investment continues to benefit from very favourable 
financing 
conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. Employment gains, which are 
also benefiting from past labour market reforms, are supporting real disposable 
income and private consumption. Moreover, the signs of a stronger global recovery 
and increasing global trade suggest that foreign demand should increasingly add to 

the overall resilience of the economic expansion in the euro area. However, 
economic growth continues to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of 
structural reforms, in particular in product markets, and by remaining balance sheet 

adjustment needs in a number of sectors. The risks surrounding the euro area 
growth outlook, while moving towards a more balanced configuration, are still tilted to 
the downside and relate predominantly to global factors.
                                                                     1

Update on economic and monetary developments
 Summary
 3 Inflation has been recovering from the very low levels seen in 2016, largely owing to 
higher energy price increases. After reaching 2.0% in February, euro area annual 
HICP inflation declined to 1.5% 
in 
March 2017. 
Measure
s of underlying inflation, 
however, have remained low and are expected to show only a gradually rising trend 
over the medium term, supported by 
the 
monetary policy measures, the expected 
continuing economic recovery and the corresponding gradual absorption
 of slack.
 Broad money growth remained robust, while the recovery in loan growth to the 

private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. 
The euro area 
bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2017 indicates that net loan demand has 
increased and bank lending conditions have eased 
further 
across all loan categories. 
The pass
-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 
thus 
continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households 

and credit flows across the euro area.
 Moreover, financing costs for euro area non
-financial corporation
s 
are estimated to have remained favourable in the early months 
of 2017.
 At its meeting on 
27 April 2017
, 
based on 
the
 regular economic and monetary 
analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the
 key ECB interest rates
 unchanged. 
The Governing Council continue
s 
to expect the key ECB interest rates 
to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the 
horizon of 
the 
net asset purchases. 
Regarding
 non-standard monetary policy 
measures, the Governing Council confirm
ed that the
 net asset purchases, at the new 
monthly pace of •60 billion, are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or 

beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained 
adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.
 The net purchases 
will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing 

securities purchased under the 
asset
 purchase programme
. 
Looking ahead, the Governing Council 
confirmed 
that a
 very substantial degree of 
monetary accommodation is needed for euro area inflation pressures to build up and 

support headline inflation in the medium term. If the outlook becomes l
ess 
favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress 

towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stand
s 
ready to increase 
the 
asset purchase programme in
 terms of size and/or duration.

In quarterly 
terms, the PMI remained at about the same level in the first quarter of 2017 relative 
to the previous quarter, pointing to ongoing robust growth. Quarterly PMIs 
weakened 
in the United Kingdom
 and to a lesser extent in the United States, but picked

7. The recovery is broadening, with the improvement in growth being widespread 

across countries
. Indeed, the dispersion of quarterly growth rates across countries 

has narrowed considerably in recent quarters. In particular, activity in commodity 

exporters has stabilised 
following
 the rebound in commodity prices, 
while
 temporary 
downturns
 caused by
 domestic fac

Global financial conditions 
remain broadly supportive
. Equity markets have

had some concerns about the ability of the new US 
administration to follow
 through on policy 
pronouncements
. Yet despite significant 
policy uncertainty, financial markets have been generally resilient, with risk aversion 
low
. The Federal Reserve 
System increased 
its official 
interest rates at its March 
meeting.
 While other major central banks are expected to maintain an 
accommodative stance, markets have also been buoyed by expectations that 

monetary tightening in the United States
 will be gradual. In China, financial

Financial conditions in most other 
EMEs have improved with financial markets rebounding and, following some weeks 
of outflows, capital has flowed back towards EMEs

 Global inflation increase
d further
 in February,
 mainly driven by energy prices
. Annual consumer price inflation in the countries of the Organisation for Econo
mic 

Co-operation and Development (OECD) reached
 2.5
% in 
February, 
a level not seen 
in almost five years
. 
Excluding food and energy, OECD annual inflation remained 
unchanged at 1.9% compared 
with figures for
 January. 
Slowly diminishing spare 
capacity at the
 global level is expected to give some support to underlying inflation
 looking forward, 
while the current oil futures curve anticipates very stable oil prices, 
pointing to a very limited contribution from energy prices to inflation
. 
Since
 late last year when
 members of the Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC)
 and 11 non
-OPEC producer countries agreed to 
cut oil production, Brent crude oil prices have 
fluctuated
 in the range of 
USD
 49 to USD 56 per barrel
. While global oil production dropped in January as 
expected, in February oil supply in both OPEC and non
-OPEC countries increased, 
raising
 concerns about whether the supply curtailment would be complied with
. At 
the same time rising US crude oil inventories and shale oil
 supply further weighed 
negatively on oil prices, sending them back 
to 
USD 50 per barrel 
where they 
had stood at the end of November 2016. Since the beginning of April, prices have

 6 reverted to a mild positive trend owing to a new decline in US inventories 
and outages in Libya™s largest oilfield due to renewed geopolitical tensions. Expectations 
that the OPEC cut would be extended
 for the second half of 2017 ha
ve also recently 
been priced in
. Non
-oil commodity prices have decreased by around 5%
, in US 
dollar
 terms
, since early March. This has been driven largely by a substantial decline 
in the price of iron ore
, due to high stocks at Chinese ports and expectations of a 
moderation 
in Chinese steel demand and
, to a lesser extent, due to a decline in food 
prices
. Other non
-ferrous metal prices remained broadly stable.
 The outlook for economic activity in the United States remains broadly robust
. Real 
GDP 
expanded at an annualised rate of 2
.1% 
in the fourth quarter of 2016, 

supported primarily by consumer spending
 and private investment. Survey and hard 

data have diverged at the start of 2017, with consumer and business sentiment 
continuing to be robust, while industrial production, core capital goods orders and 
consumer spending are softening. However, some of the
 factors holding back 

consumption are temporary, including exceptionally warm weather weighing on 
energy consumption
, and delays in tax refunds. At the same time, labour market 
conditions continued tightening in March, with 
the
 unemployment rate 
reaching 4.5% 
(below the Federal Open Market Committee™s
 estimate of full
 employment
) and 
annual growth in average hourly earnings at 2.7%. 
In 
March
 annual headline 
consumer price index (CPI)
 inflation 
in the United States decreased
 to 2.4
%, mostly 
stem
ming
 from a 
decline
 in the energy component. The main components of core 
inflation also moderated, leading to a fall in CPI excluding food and energy to 2.0
%. Economic growth in Japan remains modest.
 Real GDP increased by 0.3% 
quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, with both domestic demand growth 

and net trade remaining subdued
. 
After some weakness in January, industrial 
production and real exports 
have 
rebounded and remain on average above last 
year™s levels for the same period. Moreover data
 on private consumption point to 
some tentative signs of a recovery, supported by developments in the labour market
. However, the tightening in the labour market, with the unemployment rate at its 
lowest level since 1994, has not led to an acceleration in wage growth. H
eadline 
CPI 
inflation 
increased to 0.4% in January year on year. At the same time, annual growth 
in 
CPI excluding fresh food and energy
 Œ t
he Bank of Japan™s preferred measure of 
core inflation
 Œ 
also strengthened somewhat, to 
0.2%. Following robust growth
 in the UK economy last year, recent indicators point 

to a softer start into 2017
. In the final quarter of 2016, real GDP increased by 0.7% 

quarter on quarter. However, recent indicators overall suggest that the pace of 

economic expansion softened at the start of this year. In particular, there are signs 

that rising inflation is curtailing real incomes and private consumption. The pick
-up in 
inflation over recent months has been driven largely by energy prices and the 

depreciation of the pound sterling since the UK referendum on EU membership. In 

March 2017 annual CPI inflation stood at 2.3%. 
On 29 March 2017 the UK 
government gave formal notice of its intention to withdraw from the European Union

 7 quarter. 
Growth was mainly driven by consumption
, while the contribution of gross 
fixed capital formation was 
the
 lowe
st since early 2015. However, overall momentum 
in the first quarter was weaker than in the last quarter of 2016. It was also weaker 

than what some available indicators suggested, in particular for investment and 

construction, which could reflect a residual seasonality affecting the estimate for the 
first quarter. Annual CPI inflation fell to 0.8% in February, from 2.5% in January, as 
food and tourism services prices fell after the Chinese New Year holiday. Inflation 

excluding food and energy decreased to 1.8% from 2.2%
. Meanwhile,
 annual 
producer price inflation rose to 7.8%, which 
is attributed to rising ferrous metal and 
energy prices. Reductions in overcapacity in heavy industry have pushed up raw 
mate
rial prices but this is likely to be temporary
.

 Overall, euro area government bond yields have slightly declined since early 
March.
 The slight decline during the period under review (9
 March to 26
 April 2017) 
has taken place in the
 context of heightened political uncertainty surrounding the 
French presidential elections. As a result, a phase of declining yields between late 
March and the day before the first
-round results of the French elections were known 
was partially offset by rising yields in the aftermath of the vote. Overall, the euro area 
ten
-year overnight index swap (OIS) yield declined by 5 basis points while sovereign 
bond yields decreased on average by around 15 basis points. Across countries, the 
declines ranged from a few basis points to around 70 points, while some marginal 
increases were observed in Italy and the Netherlands. Spreads vis
-à-
vis the rate on 
German ten
-year bonds overall remained unchanged or decreased slightly in most 
countries, with the exception of Greece and Portugal (where the declines reached 

around 70
 basis points) and Italy and the Netherlands (where spreads rose 
marginally).

financial corporations underperformed relative to NFCs in all three economic areas. 
Market expectations of equity price volatility increased significantly in the euro area
 to around 23% ahead of the French elections, but reverted to the levels prevailing in 

early March, i.e. around 14%, in the aftermath. In the United States, by contrast, 
market

early March 
and still around 25 basis points

than in March 2016, when the Governing 
Council announced the launch of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). 

Spreads on non
-investment grade NFC and financial sector debt (which is ineligible 
for purchase under the CSPP) also declined over the same period, by 10

points respectively.
 In foreign exchange markets, the euro recorded a small depreciation
 in 
trade

 In bilateral terms, 
from
 9 
March
, the euro appreciated by 
3.2
% against the US dollar and by 2.9% against the
 Chinese renminbi. Such 
developments were more than offset by a weakening of the euro vis

currencies of other principal trading partners of the euro area. In particular, the euro 
depreciated against the pound sterling (by 2%) and against the currencies of most 

other non
-euro area EU Member States. In the case of the Czech koruna, the euro 
weakened against it slightly (by 0.3%) following the discontinuation of the koruna™s

 Quarterly private consumption 
growth 
increased further to

This 
improvement in growth took place despite a 
rise in the euro price of oil of almost 15% between the third and fourth quarter of last 

year. 
On an annual basis, consumption rose by 1.
9% in the 
fourth quarter, after
 1.8% in the 
third 
quarter. This slight 
incre
ase was in contrast to a sharp slowdown in 
the 
growth of households™ real disposable income, to 1.
1%, year on year
, from 
1.6
% in 
the third
 quarter. 
This decline, in turn, mirrored the increase in annual inflation, as 
measured by the private consumption deflator, between the third and fourth quarter. 
It should be borne
 in mind
, however, 
that income growth, despite the latest decline, 
remains relatively 
high by historical standards. Indeed, consumer spending during 
the ongoing recovery has been benefiting from rising real 
labour
 income for
 households, which has primarily reflected rising
 employment and lower oil prices. 
The slightly higher consumption growth, alongside falling real income growth, 
between the third and fourth quarter resulted in a fall in the household saving rate.

 result, consumer sentiment stands well above its long
-term average
 and close to its 
pre
-crisis peak level in 2007. Moreover, data on retail trade (up to 
February 201
7) and new passenger car registrations (for the full 
first 
quarter) are in line with posit
ive 
growth in consumer spending in the 
first quarter
 of 2017
, at a 
similar pace
 to that 
observed 
in the 
fourth 
quarter. Moreover, further employment growth, as suggested 
by the latest survey indicators, should also continue to support aggregate income 

and consumer spending. Finally, households™ net worth relative to disposable income 
continues to rise, 
owing largely to
 valuation gains on real estate holdings
. This 
development should add support to
 overall consumption growth.

 13 investment in intellectual property products, in turn reflecting the transaction of 
assets by a small number of large economic operators in Ireland. By contrast, 
investment in machinery and equipment 
con
tracted slightly in the fourth quarter. 
Meanwhile, 
the small 
increase 
in construction investment, 
of 0.1%, 
quarter on 
quarter, reflected 
a ris
e in 
investment
 in home
s, which was partly offset by a decline 
in investment in other buildings and structures
. 
Incoming information suggests that
 both 
business investment 
and 
construction investment continued to rise
 in the 
first 
quarter of 201
7.
 Continued positive growth in business investment is indicated by the average level of 

industrial production of capital goods in January and February, which was 
0.2
% up 
on that in 
the fourth quarter
 of 2016. Moreover, confidence in the capital goods 
sector was, on average, higher in the 
first 
quarter than in the 
previous
 quarter
, and the assessment of order books in the capital goods sector improved both overall and 
in terms of orders from abroad, alongside the observed gradual improvement of the 

external environment. With regard to construction investment, monthly construction 
production data point to 
positive 
growth in the 
first 
quarter of 201
7. Furthermore, 
survey indicators on the demand situation and the assessment of order books in the 
sector
, as well as building permits
, are still in line with positive underlying dynamics 
in the short term.
 The recovery in investment is expected to continue 
in the medium
 term.
 Business investment is 
expected
 to be supported by domestic and external 
demand
 and favourable financing conditions
, in the context of the accommodative monetary 
policy
. Improving
 corporate
 profits should also support investment. As regards 
construction investment, factors such as 
households™ 
rising disposable income and 
improving lending conditions should underpin demand in the sector. Downside risks 
to the 
outlook for 
business investment relate to remaining deleveraging needs in 
some countries
. Monthly trade data point
 to a continued
 rise in
 euro area 
export
s 
in the 
near 
term
. Total euro area exports rose by 1.8% in the fourth quarter,
 mainly 
on account 
of a rebound in goods exports, supported by a weaker effective exchange rate of the 
euro and a gradual rebound in global trade. M
onthly 
trade in goods outcomes for 
January
 and February 
suggest that extra
-euro area export
s 
continued to firm 
in the 
first 
quarter
 of 2017
. 
The export growth momentum (in three
-month
-on-three
-month 
percentage changes) seems to be
 driven by demand mainly from Asia (including 
China) and improvements in Russia as well as the United States
. 
Euro area exports are expected to 
rebound as 
global trade
 continues to firm
. Survey indicators
 signal improvements in foreign demand
, and new export orders
 have risen. In addition, the effective exchange rate of the euro depreciated 
in the first 
four months of 2017
 and could 
spur
 competiveness
 gains
 for euro area exporters. 
However, any emergence of protectionist tendencies around the world could pose 
downside risks to the outlook for foreign demand
 and hence euro area exports
 in the 
longer term.
 Overall, the latest economic indicators are, on balance, consistent
 with 
ongoing real GDP growth in the first and second

. Industrial production 
(excluding construction) displayed a small decline in February 2017 following a 
rise 
of the same magnitude in the previous month. As a result, 
average 
production over 
these two months stood broadly at the same level as in the 
final 
quarter
 of 2016
, 
when production rose by 0.
9% on a quarterly basis. More timely survey data are also 
in line with 
continued
 positive growth 
dynamics 
in the near term. The composite 
output Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) averaged 5
5.6 
in the 
first 
quarter of 201
7, compared with
 53.8 
in the 
fourth
 quarter, 
before rising to 56.7 in April from 56.4 in 
March 
(see Chart
 5). At the 
same time, the European Commission™s Economic 
Sentiment Indicator (ESI) rose to 10
7.9
 in the first quarter
 from 10
6.9 
in the 
fourth
 quarter. Consequently
, both the ESI and the PMI, which
 remain above their 
respective long
-term averages, are approaching their recent peaks at the beginning 
of 2011
. 
Looking ahead, the 
ongoing 
economic expansion is expected to 
continue to 
firm 
and broaden
. The pass
-through of the monetary policy measures is supporting 
domestic demand and facilitates the ongoing deleveraging process. The recovery in 
investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and 

improvements in corporate profitability. Employment gains, which are also benefiting 
from past labour market reforms, are supporting real disposable income and private 
consumption. Moreover, the signs of a stronger global recovery and increasing 

global trade suggest that foreign demand should increasingly add to the overall 
resilience of the economic expansion in the euro area. However, economic growth 
con
tinues to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural 

reforms, in particular in product markets, and by remaining balance sheet adjustment 
needs in a number of sectors. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, 
while moving towards a more balanced configuration, are still tilted to the downside 

and relate predominantly to global factors.
 The results of the latest round of the 
ECB™s Survey of 
Professional Forecasters
, conducted in early 
April
, show that 
private sector GDP growth forecasts were revised upwards for 2017 and 2018

 After reaching 2.0% in February, headline

. The annual rate of 
HICP inflation excluding food and energy declined to 0.7% in March 2017 from 0.9% 

in February 
Œ 
the lowest level over the last two years. The decline resulted to a large 
extent 
from the deceleration in the very volatile travel

. This 
most likely reflect
ed mainly price effects linked to the timing of 
the 
Easter holidays (with Easter being in April this year but in March last year), which are 
thus 
likely to be of a
 more temporary nature
. HICP inflation excluding food and 
energy 
has remained 
well b
elow its long

 most 
alternative measures 
also 
do not indicate a pick
-up in 
underlying inflationary 
pressures. This may reflect in part 
the
 lagged downward indirect effects of past low 
oil prices but
 also, more fundamentally, continued weak domestic cost pressures.
 Some pipeline pressures have 
buil
t up at the 
early 
stages of the production 
and 
pricing chain
. At the early stages of the pricing
 chain, above
-average global 
producer price inflation (excluding oil) and strong growth in import prices for 

intermediate goods point to a build
-up of pipeline price pressures. Intermediate 
goods are also the main driver of recent increases in producer price inflation for total 
industry (excl

February 2017 from 1.5% in January. Further along the pricing chain some upward

Factors that may have been weighing on wage growth 
include still significant slack in the labour market, weak productivity growth and the 

ongoing impact

 Domestic counterparts other than credit to general government

hand, the significantly negative

ng rates, which started in early 2014, has flattened at 
the beginning of 2017

 Between May 2014 and 
February

. 
Composite lending rates for NFCs and households 
have de
creased 
by significantly more than market reference rates since 
the 
announcement of the ECB™s credit easing measures in June 2014. The reduction in 
bank lending rates on NFC loans was especially
 strong in vulnerable countries, 
thereby contributing to mitigating previous
 asymmetries in monetary policy 
transmission across countries. Over the sa
me period, the spread between interest 
rates charged on very small loans (loans of up to
 •0.25 million) and those charged 
on large loans (loans of above •1 million) in the
 euro area narrowed considerably. 
This indicates that small and medium

 The ECB™s asset 
purchase programme and TARGET balances: monetary policy 
implementation and beyond
 21 Boxes
 1 The ECB™s asset purchase programme and 
TARGET 
balances
: monetary policy implementation and beyond
 This box analyses the increase in TARGET balances since the start of the 
asset 
purchase programme (APP) and explains why the current dynamics 
differ from those observed during previous episodes of rising balances.
2 TARGET balances are the claims and liabilities of euro area national central banks 
(NCBs) vis
-à-
vis the ECB that result 
from cross
-border payments settled in central 
bank money.
3 Net payment inflows into a country increase the TARGET claim (or 
reduce the TARGET liability) of its NCB while net payment outflows have the 

opposite effect. The total TARGET balance, which is the sum of all positive balances, 
is only affected when central bank money flows between countries with positive and 
negative balances.
4 Cross
-border flows of central bank money, as reflected in 
changes in TARGET balances, are recorded in the balance of payments of euro area 
countries.
5 According to balance of payments accounting, these flows
 must be 
mirrored in other components of the balance of payments, such as the current 
account or portfolio investment flows.
 Sizeable TARGET balances can be a consequence
 of the injection of large 
amounts of excess liquidity 
by the euro area™s decentralised central banking 
system
. TARGET balances emerge when the central bank reserves created in one 
jurisdiction flow to another.
 During the sovereign debt crisis, there was a 
demand
-driven
 increase in excess liquidity as banks substituted Eurosystem funding for 
market
-based funding that had dried up. Although the initial provision of liquidity via 
refinancing operations was TARGET
-neutral,
6 TARGET balances increased as this 
liqu
idity subsequently flowed from vulnerable to less
-vulnerable countries in the 
context of severe market stress.
7 Since the start of the expanded APP, however, the 
                                                                    2  ﬁ
TARGETﬂ stands for ﬁTrans
-European Automated Real
-time Gross settlement Express Transfer 
systemﬂ. In May 2008, TARGET2 fully replaced the 
former
 TARGET system as the real
-time gross 
settlement system owned and operated by the Eurosystem. In the interests of readability, the term 
ﬁTARGET balancesﬂ is used here to describe the balances accumulated in 
TARGET and TARGET2.
 3  
In addition, the ECB and the NCBs
 of five non
-euro area Member States that participate in TARGET2 
(Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Poland and 
Romania) also have TARGET balances.
 4  
The total TARGET balance increases if, on a net basis, central bank money flows from a country with a 

liability to a country with a claim, and it decreases if that money flows in the opposite direction. By 

contrast, f
lows between two countries with claims (or two countries with liabilities) change the 

composition, but not the size, of the total TARGET balance.
 5  
If a euro area country sends more funds abroad via TARGET than it receives, this will be offset by an 

equal
ly-
sized liability of the 
country™s NCB
 vis
-à-vis the ECB in the financial account of the balance of
 payments 
under the item ﬁother investment 
of the national central bank
ﬂ. 
6  
Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) can only participate in refinancing oper
ations through their NCB. 

The liquidity is allotted to the participating MFI via a credit to its current account held at the NCB. 
The 
implementation of refinancing operation
s 
entails no cross
-border payments and is therefore TARGET
-neu
tral
. 
7  
Under the fi
xed
-rate, full allotment tender procedure, demand for Eurosystem refinancing was fully 
accommodated subject to collateral availability, which allowed significant growth in excess liquidity. For

Netherlands, while the three with the largest TARGET liabilities were Italy, Spain and Portugal (although the ECB™s 
liability is actually 
greater than that of Portugal). The vertical black lines mark the commencement of purchases under the APP and the PSPP in Oct
ober 
2014 and March 2015, respectively. The latest data are for March 2017.
 The financial structure of the euro area contributes to the current increase in 
TARGET balances because cross
-border payments are an inherent feature of 
decentralised APP implementation in an integrated market.
 APP implementation 
is distinct from that of refinancing operations because it can entail immediate cross
-border payments, as purchases are not limited by national borders. In fact, around 
80% of APP purchases by volume have involved non
-domestic counterparties, while 
around 50% have involved counterparties resident outside the euro area, many of 
which are concentred in the United Kingdom.
9 The latter have historically accessed 
TARGET2 via major euro area financial centres, particularly Germany and, to a 
                                                                    8  
Around 85% of the increase in liquidity provided through euro
-denominated open market operations 
between the end of February 2015 (i.e. prior to the commencement of the PSPP) and 31
 March 2017 
was due to the APP. All of the increase in recourse to Eurosystem refinancing operations over the same 
period reflects participation in targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). Participation in 
TLTROs should not be interpreted as a sign of stress
-related recourse to Eurosystem refinancing, as 
the very att
ractive pricing of these operations was a key motive for participation (see, for example, the 
January 2017 euro area bank lending survey).
 9  
In this context, ﬁnon
-domesticﬂ refers to a counterparty located in a country which is different from that 

of the purchasing NCB. This includes counterparties located in other euro area countries. 

Counterparties 
may not necessarily be the legal owner of the security
; they may 
be acting 
as 
intermediaries, holding securities and managing tr
ansactions on behalf of the ow
ners.

10 The main financial centres in the euro area have
 always been located in countries which, during the sovereign debt crisis, came to be 
viewed as less vulnerable.
11 The settlement of APP transactions is therefore 
associated with structural cross
-border flows to these locations.
12 The rise in the total TARGET balance has followed the upward path implied by 
cross
-border payments for APP transactions, suggesting that other financial 
flows did not further increase the balance after the implementation of the APP.
 Chart
 B shows how the total TARGET balance has actually evolved alongside a 
simulated balance illustrating how it would have evolved if the only cross
-border 
payments in the system had been those stemming from APP implementation.
13 The 
actual balance is currently below the simulated balance, indicating that subsequent 

cross
-border liquidity flows are not giving rise to additional increases in the total 
TARGET balance; it instead suggests that there are some net cross
-border liquidity 
flows back to countries with TARGET liabilities from those with claims.

The simulated

the location of 
the

of 
APP counterparties (the ECB™s balance is treated separately from balances of non

accounts resulting from APP purchases.
 The latest data 
are for March 2017.

The locations used 
by non
-euro area banks 
for participation in TARGET2 are the result of free choice. 
Banks located in the European Economic Area (EEA) that are eligible to become direct participants in 
TARGET2 can choose the NCB with which they want to open a TARGET2 account, while other non
-euro area banks choose correspondent banks for accessing TARGET2
, typically refl
ecting historical 
relationships. The locations have remained largely unchanged since TARGET2 went live in 2007/08.
 11  
Evidence fr
om the original TARGET payment system indicates that Germany and the United Kingdom 

were major financial centres well before the onset of the global financial crisis (see Cabral, I., Dierick, F. 

and Vesala, J., ﬁBanking integration in the euro areaﬂ, 
Occas
ional Paper Series
, No 6, ECB, 2002)
. 
This 
is still the case, but the United Kingdom is not a direct participant in TARGET2; Germany is the main 

location through which UK
-based banks access TARGET2, reinforcing Germany™s role as a major 
financial centre.

 24 Payments related to subsequent
 portfolio 
rebalancing
 are also affected by the 
financial structure and keep TARGET balances elevated.
 Since the launch of the 
APP, there has been a broad
-based rebalancing towards non
-euro area debt 
securities
 in the euro area as a whole which has been driven to a significant 
extent 
by the persistently negative interest rate differentials between euro area bonds and 
bonds issued by
 other advanced economies
.14 Euro area residents™ net purchases of 
non-euro area debt securities in 
this period have 
consisted almost exclusivel
y of d
ebt 
securities 
issued by
 other advanced economies, in particular the United States. Such 
international portfolio rebalancing usually takes place through actors located in major 
euro area financial centres, thereby contributing to the accumulation of reserves in 

particular locations and to the persistence of TARGET balances.
15 This mechanism 
is evident in the net external assets of a country™s MFIs, which mirror the 

transactions of the non
-banking sector with the rest of the world (see Chart
 C) and 
the way in
 which the associated payment flows are channelled (see Chart
 D).
16 A breakdown of MFIs™ net external assets for the largest TARGET
-liability countries 
shows that the payment flows associated with international portfolio rebalancing are 
mainly channelled vi
a TARGET.
17                                                                     14

 developments in the balance of payments of

 countries with
 the largest
 TARGET
 claims and those with the largest 
TARGET 
liabilities
 have 
differ
ed markedly from 
the developments 
observed 
during the 
sovereign debt crisis and have followed broadly similar patterns
 in 
both groups
. In the period from mid
-2011 to mid
-2012, TARGET
-liability
 countries 
experienced a sudden stop in foreign inflows to domestic MFIs and bond markets
 (see Chart
 Ea)
. At the same time, domestic residents reduced their holdings of 
foreign securities to repatriate liquidity, while domestic MFIs shifted funds into foreign 
deposits. Moreover, 
TARGET
-liability countries were running a
 combined
 current 
account deficit.
 Correspondingly, TARGET
-claim countries received foreign inflows to 
domestic MFIs and securities, while recording a surplus in the current account. 
Since 
the start of the 
PSPP
, foreign investors have reduced their exposure to debt 
securities in TARGET
-liability countries, 
albeit
 on a markedly smaller scale than 
during 
the sovereign debt crisis
, and in 
a similar
 fashion as 
in TARGET
-claim 
countries
 (see Chart
 Eb). Moreover, 
residents from both country groups
 have 
rebalanced towards foreign debt and equity securities, while 
recording inflows into 
domestic equities.
18 Following the external adjustment process in TARGET
-liability 
countries over recent years, the current account has registered a surplus since the 
start of the 
PSPP
, as has continued to be the
 case in TARGET

.

Cross
-border banking flows have been relatively subdued since the launch of the APP, with MFIs in 
both country groups slightly reducing their foreign assets in 
terms of 
loans and deposits. In TARGET

a 
reduction in cross
-border banking
 liabilities, while 
these increased 
somewhat in TARGET claim countries.

triggered by a replacement of private sector funding of banks

statistics.
19 By contrast, the current increase in TARGET balances is largely 
attributable to the interplay between the decentralised implementation of the APP 
and the financial structure of the euro area.

 Recent developments in youth unemployment
 27 2 Recent developments in youth unemployment
 The 
rate of 
youth unemployment 
peaked at above
 24% in the euro area in 2013 
for the age group 15
-24. Since then, the youth unemployment rate has declined 
faster than the total unemployment rate and remained around 21% in 2016, about 
6 
percentage points higher than in 2007. Against this background, this box
 describes 
some key recent features of youth unemployment across the euro area countries. 
 A close monitoring of developments in youth unemployment is necessary in 
view of potential scarring effects of unemployment, especially at the beginning 
of one™
s career
.20 Long periods of unemployment at a young age can result in 
increased risks of future unemployment, human capital losses and lower earnings. 
Youth unemployment rates are normally higher than total unemployment rates, but 
large differences across countries point to potential problems with labour market 
functioning in some countries.
 Youth unemployment in the euro area rem
ains above its pre
-crisis level,
 but 
the 
ratio 
of youth unemployment to 
total unemployment has hardly changed.
 Youth unemployment is particularly high in Greece, Spain and Italy, following sharp 
rises during the crisis (Chart
 A). However, in spite of the very high youth 
unemployment rates, the ratio of youth unemployment to total unemployment did not 
change significantly between 2007
 and 2016, which suggests that youth 
unemployment has moved in line with total unemployment (Chart
 B). Thus the very 
high levels of youth unemployment during the crisis reflect both the intensity of the 
crisis and relatively high youth unemployment in the 
pre
-crisis period. In this regard, 
it is worth noting the large heterogeneity across countries. While for the euro area as 
a whole, the youth unemployment rate is 2.2 times higher than the total 
unemployment rate, in Italy and Luxembourg it is more than 3 times higher. By 
contrast, the youth unemployment rate in Germany is only about 1.7 times higher 
than the total unemployment rate.
                                                                     20

 The youth unemployment rate is declining faster than 
the 
total unemployment
 rate,
 reflecting its higher sensitivity to the cycle.
 Between 2007 and 2013 the 
youth unemployment rate in the euro area increased by about 9 percentage points. 
In the same period, the total unemployment rate increased by about 4.5 percentage 
points (i.e. half as much as youth unemployment). Similarly, during the recovery, 

youth unemployment has been declining faster than total unemployment. Between 
2013 and 2016, the youth unemployment rate declined by about 3.5 percentage 
points, while the total unemployment rate decreased by about 2 percentage points 

(Char

Œ 
followed by Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus 
Œ 
are among the countries with the largest reductions in youth unemployment.

 The share of young unemployed remain
ing
 unemployed for more than a year 
is
 lower than the share of total unemployed doing s
o. As expected, the share of 
young people that remain unemployed for more than one year is smaller than the 

corresponding figure for total unemployed, reflecting the fact that young people are 

more prone to intermittent transitions between activity and inactivity (e.g. to acquire 
further education or training). However, in some countries the share for young 
unemployed is close to the share for total unemployed (Chart
 D).
                                                                     21  
There was a general decline in youth participation during the crisis. 
At the same time, t
he share of 
young people who are not in education or training and also not looking for jobs has remained relatively 
stable since 2007, leading to the conclusion that the decline in participation during the crisis reflects 

decisions to stay in or return to education.

 Overall, the relationship between youth unemployment and total 
unemployment has not changed 
since 
the crisis
, but
 the high costs associated 
with youth unemployment indicate the need for policy measures to improve 
labour market functioning in some co
untries.
 Such policy measures include: 
(1)
 improving the quality and the labour market relevance of education, including via 
well
-developed apprenticeship systems; (2)
 ensuring a well
-functioning and 
responsible wage setting system, including when setting minimum wages; 
(3)
 enhancing the role of public employment services and the provision of active 
labour market policies with a view to supporting the unemployed during labour 
market transitions and increasing their employability; (4)
 increasing working time
 flexibility in order to facilitate a combination of work and education and to ease the 
transition from education to employment in the labour market.

 Assessing labour market slack
 31 3 Assessing
 labour market slack
 Despite broad improvements in euro area labour markets since the start of
 the 
recovery and a marked decline in unemployment rates across many euro area 
economies, wage growth remains subdued, suggesting that there is
 still 
a considerable degree of labour market slack. This box looks at developments in wider 

measures of labour ma
rket slack 
in comparison with
 the rather 
narrow definition of 
the unemployment rate
. The broadening of the recovery in activity is becoming increasingly apparent 
in euro area labour markets, with more countries and sectors
 recording 
positive 
employment gro
wth
. Overall, the ﬁemployment
-richﬂ recovery
22 has led to 
an increase in the number of persons employed of just under five million since the 
middle of 2013, offsetting virtually all of the employment losses seen over the crisis 
period. Moreover, there has been a notable broadening of the labour market 

recovery, as evidenced by the 
narrowing of
 the dispersion of employment growth 
rates across euro area economies and sectors over the past two years, 
and almost 
all euro area countries 
are 
now recording positive quarter
-on-quarter employment 
growth 
(see Chart
 A)
. Unemployment has declined somewhat faster than expected 
Œ 
albeit still remaining high compared with pre
-crisis levels (see Chart
 6 in Section
 3) Œ 
and labour shortages reportedly 
appear to be emerging in some countries (most 
notably in Germany).

 32 Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) labour shortages have 
typically 
tended to 
signal rising wage pressure, 
but the

 seems to have broken down over 
the course of the recovery, which may 
suggest that

degree of labour market

 and is containing wage growth.

s: The labour shortages

-term averages
. The latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2016 (compensation per employee and compensation per hour worked) and f
or 
the first quarter of 2017 (labour shortages indicators).
 The unemployment rate is based on a rather narrow definition of labour 
underutilisation
. According to the I
nternational 
Labour 
Organization™s
 definition of 
unemployment (on which the euro area headline unemployment rate is based), job
-seekers are considered unemployed if they are (i)
 without 
work; (ii)
 available to start 
working within two weeks; and (iii)
 actively seeking work
.24 However, wider 
definitions may also be relevant for assessing the overall degree of labour market 
slack, with two groups 
being 
particularly worthy of consideration: first, those who are 
without work but do not meet one of the other two
 criteria; and, 
second, those who 
are employed on a
 part
-time
 basis
 but want to work more hours. The first group 
falls 
within
 the inactive 
category 
and the second group 
within
 the employe
d 
category.
 Currently around
 3½
% of the 
euro area 
working age population 
are marginally

that is, categorised as inactive,

This is not to deny the importance of other factors. Structural reforms to labour markets and wage
-bargaining systems, as well as changes in the degree of forward and backward
-looking price 
indexing 
in wage agreements and the low inflation environment, are also likely to have played a role in 
interrupting this correlation.

 those who 
are
 actively seeking work, 
but are not (yet) available to begin work 
(perhaps because they 
have received a
 job
 offer 
with a start date
 some time in the 
future
 or because they are not able to start work within the next two weeks
). 
The 
latter sub
-group currently amounts to almost 1% of the euro area working age 
population, while the former sub
-gro
up is somewhat larger 
Œ 
currently amounting to
 around 2.6% of the working age population
 Œ 
with the majority being discouraged 
workers
 who are not actively seeking work because they do not think work is 
available. This 
sub
-group
, however, can be relatively
 quick to rejoin the labour force 
as labour market conditions improve.
26 While 
movements in the number
 of those 
who are ﬁavailable, but
 not seeking workﬂ are typically countercyclical (as is 
unemployment)
, the number
s reporting 
that they are ﬁseeking work
, but not
 available
ﬂ 
had 
been following a 
downward
 trend
 prior to the recovery, but
 have 
remained flat since the rebound.
 In addition, a further 3% of the working age population are currently 

underemployed
 (i.e. working fewer hours than they would like)
. Par
t-time 
employment has been rising across most euro area economies for over a decade, 

mainly owing
 to structural 
factors
 (such as the growth in services and in part 
reflecting the rise in female participation
 in the labour force
).27 However, a non
-negligible share of the
se part
-time workers would like to work 
more
 hours. Currently 
there are 
around 
seven million underemployed part
-time workers across the euro 
area
 Œ 
an increase of around 
one million since the start of the crisis. More
over
, the 
number ha
s 
declined only very modestly over the past two years, despite the robust 
employment
 growth seen during the recovery.
 Combining the estimates of the unemployed and the underemployed with the 
broader measures of unemployment 
suggests that
 labour market slack 
currently affects around 18% of the euro area extended labour force.
28 This 
amount of underutilisation is almost double the level captured
 by the unemployment 

rate, which now stands at 9.5
% 
(see Chart
 C). The broader indicator is widely
 used 
by both the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the OECD
.29 As well as suggesting a 
considerably higher estimate of labour market slack 
in 
the euro area than shown by 
the unemployment rate
, these broader measures have also recorded
 somewhat 
more moderat
e declines over the course of the recovery than the reductions seen in 
the unemployment rate
. 
                                                                     26  
However
, the
se workers
 may temporarily boost unemployment levels when they
 re-
enter the labo
ur 
force, before they find work.

Broader estimates of labour underutilisation across euro area countries
 (percentage

  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 Note: All measures
 are expressed as percentages of the extended labour force (i.e. the 
active labour force 
plus those available, but 
not seeking work and those seeking work, but not available). 
 While these broader measures cannot be taken entirely at face value, euro area 
labour markets appear subject to a greater degree of labour market slack than 

the level suggested by the unemployment rate.
 These broader measures may 
overestimate the effective degree of labour market slack somewhat, in that they 

(i)
 overestimate the rema
ining capacity of  underemployed part
-time workers 
somewhat, since a proportion of their time (typically around half) is already spent 
working; (ii)
 may overestimate how far those in the potential additional labour force are 
willing and able to find work (i.e., the extent to which they are suitably skilled for local 
labour markets); and (iii)
 do not make allowances for the lower job finding probabilities 
of many of the very long
-term unemployed (i.e., those out of work for two years or 
more 
Œ 
currently estimated to account for around one
-third of the unemployment totals 
across the euro area).
30 Adjustments to the broader measures to deduct the very long
-term unemployed and to allow for the time that the underemployed spend working still 

result in estimates of
 labour market slack of the order of 15% across the euro area in 
the final quarter of 2016 (on a four
-quarter moving average basis). 
 Despite a clear improvement in many labour market indicators, labour markets 

in most euro area countries 
Œ 
with the notabl
e exception of Germany 
Œ 
appear to 
still be subject to a considerable degree of underutilisation.
 The level of the 
broader indicator of labour underutilisation is still high, and this is likely to continue to 

contain wage dynamics.
                                                                      30  
It is, for instance, well
-documented that job
 finding probabilities
 differ considerably across sub
-groups 
of the unemployed, but it does not necessarily follow that 
the 
job finding 
probability 
of those in
 the 
inactive 
category 
is zero
 Œ 
although it is, empirically, 
well below that of the unemployed who are 
available and 
actively 
seeking
 work.
 Much
 depends both on the intensity of individuals™ job search 
and
 on employers™ perceptions of the various sub
-groups in the context of wider labour market conditions.
 On the other hand, many of the very long
-term unemployed may be 
similar
 to th
ose 
in the 
inactive 
category 
in terms of employability

 What can recent developments in producer prices tell us about pipeline pressures?
 36 4 What can recent developments in producer prices tell us 
about pipeline 
pressures
? 
Consumer price inflation of non
-energy industrial goods in the euro area has 
remained subdued thus far.
 The short
-term outlook for this component of the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) can typically be informed by what are 
known as
 pipeline pressures. These pipeline pressures may
 have already emerged 
at early
 stages in the overall pricing chain. This box discusses recent developments 
in global and domestic producer prices, which are
 impor
tant indicators in 
the
 pricing 
chain.
 Pipeline pressures often have their origin at the global level.
 In particular,
 commodity prices 
can
 pass through to euro area industrial producer prices via 
the 
cost of imported energy (see Chart
 A). This pass
-through 
can also be more indirect if 
commodity prices have an impact on
 global non
-energy 
producer prices
. This may 
subsequently also have an impact on
 the 
price of
 imported goods, which
 form part of 
the supply chains used in domestic production.
 The annual rate of import prices for 
intermediate goods is continuing
 to increase rapidly.
 This is not only a reflection of
 the recovery in producer prices globally but also 
of 
the recent euro exchange rate 
depreciation
. The recent upturn in euro area 
non-e
nergy 
producer price inflation
 mirrors
 to a large extent
 that in global 
non-energy 
producer price inflation (see

Producer prices for industry excluding energy for the euro area and globally

 Note
s: The global 
Producer Price Index (PPI)
 excluding
 the
 energy 
sector 
is 
an ECB estimate, compiled as a weighted average for 
20 euro area 
trading
 partners, using their share in 
the 
extra
-euro area export of goods. To the extent possible, the series use
s PPI 
excluding the energy sector. For countries where this measure
 is not available, PPI inflation of the energy sector was subtracted from 
the total PPI inflation using the energy sector™s weight in the respective economy. For a small number of countries, the contribution of 
the 
energy sector to the o
verall PPI was esti
mated.
 The latest observations are for March 2017 for the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro against the currencies of 38 of the euro 
area™s main trading partners (
NEER
-38) and February 2017 for 
the PPI
. 
Recent producer
 price developments 
early
 in
 the pricing chain point to 
evidence of some
 pipeline pressures.
 Movements in headline producer price 
inflation (industry excluding construction and the energy sector) are typically 
dominated by those for the intermediate goods sector, reflecting both the
ir 
high 

weight and amplitude (see Chart
 C). 
Headline producer prices
 can therefore
 not be 
taken as a direct indicator of price pressures for final consumer price inflation. 

However, 
the stronger and more sustained producer price developments 
are 
in intermed
iate goods industries that are 
further
 upstream in the production and pricing 
chain
, the greater the likelihood is that they
 may be
 passed 
through to producer 
prices in non
-food consumer goods industries. Correlation analysis suggests that 
producer price inflation in intermediate goods industries 
generally 
has its strongest 
co-movement 
(at 0.7 on average) with producer price inflation in non
-food consumer 
goods industries with a lag of 
somewhat more than half a year
31; however, there 
have been episodes where
 this co
-movement lapses. The recent upturn in producer 
prices for intermediate goods could hence tentatively point to some pipeline 
pressures emerging at 
later
 stages
 over the coming months
.                                                                     31  T
he ma
ximum correlation may be with a lag of more than half a year. However
, the impact 
that
 a change in producer prices for intermediate goods 
has in a given month 
on producer prices for non
-food 
consumer goods may 
begin to show as early as
 in the initial month
s thereafter
. A more rigorous 
pass
-through analysis would usefully draw on impulse responses derived from a dedicated model, but 
this is
 beyond the scope of this box

 38 Chart 
C 
Producer prices for total industry and components
 (annual percentage changes, percentage point contributions)
  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 Note: The latest observations are for February 2017.
 Pipeline price pressures tend to be gradually dampened along the production 
chain.
 It is likely that the degree of dampening
 depends 
on the number of production 

stages 
(from crude materials to final consumption goods
) 
and the timing of the 
respective pricing decisions. One explanation is that each stage 
may have
 some 
degree of manoeuvre to adjust margins a
nd that there may be sufficient leeway in 
the 
timing of pricing to gauge the persistence of cost shocks from upstream stages
. 
In this regard, firms may be making use of hedging instruments to protect 
themselves against the risk of, for example, exchange rate volatility. Moreover supply 
contracts can sometimes be fixed for several months ahead, thus offering a 
temporary buffer against cost shocks. The relative movements in 
Purchasing 

Manager
s™ Index (PMI)
 input and output prices in the industrial sector 
sugg
est that 
there may 
generally 
be stronger variation in margins in the intermediate goods sector 

than in the 
non-food 
consumer goods sector
 Œ 
where the latter would be at the later 
stages of the pricing chain for consumer prices for non
-energy industrial goo
ds (see 
Chart
 D).32 At the same time
 the upward movement in PMI input prices has been 
relatively stronger than in output prices in the non
-food consumer goods sector
, 
which
 according to correlation analysis could herald a pick
-up in producer price 
inflation
 in that sector around half a year later
.                                                                     32  
Input costs in the PMI survey do not include labour costs and so cannot be taken as an
 encompassing 
measure of production costs.
 A
ssess
ing the need and scope for adjusting margins 
is 
also difficult, since 
the
 data provide 
no reliable benchmark in terms of the level of margins

 Notes: Long
-term averages are calculated over the period October 2002 to March 2017. The latest observations are for March 2017.
 Producer prices of non
-food consumer goods industries have continued to 
increase very moderately
 so far
. Over the 12 months to February 2017, t
he year
-on-yea
r growth rate of prices charged in domestic sales hovered just above 
zero, while that of prices charged in sales 
in other euro area countries has 
often 
even been negative
 (see Chart
 E)33. 
Upward pipeline pressures for the 
corresponding prices at the consumer level have recently 
mainly
 come from import 
prices for non
-food consumer goods, which have picked up to 0.6% year on year in 
February, the first positive reading in a year
. Correlation analysis suggests that 
producer price inflation in 
non
-food consumer 
goods industries
 has its strongest 
co-movement 
(at almost 0.7) 
with consumer
 price inflation in non
-energy
 industrial 
goods with a lag of more than half a year.

Of the total non
-food consumer goods produced in the euro area, about 72% are produced and sold in 
the same euro area country (domestic sales) while 28% are produced in one euro area country and 
sold in another euro area country (intra
-euro area sales).
 34  
While p
roducer and import prices for consumer goods are indicators that refer to later stages of the 
pricing chain, any pressure emerging at these stages can still be enhanced or dampened by pric
ing 
behaviour at the distribution and retailing
 levels
. The 
PMI
 for margins in non
-food retailing, one of 
the 
few indicators available for these final stages, has hovered in a relatively narrow range in recent 

months and hence 
does 
not suggest that the latest indications from producer prices for consumer

have been significantly blurred
 by any shifts in marg

 Note: The latest observations are for March 2017 for HICP

 In summary
, producer price data 
currently provide 
mixed signals 
regarding

 While 
it is likely 
that 
some upward pressure has emerged at the early stages, it
 may
 take some more 
time for this to 
filter through
 to the later stages of the pricing chain. 
It is also likely 
that this upward pressure would
 be dampened through margin or other adjustments 
along the production chain unless firms could suspend such adjustment in an 
environment of strongly increasing dema
nd. In this regard, annual growth in 
production volumes remains positive despite softening somewhat in recent quarters 
(see Chart
 F). Moreover, survey data on capacity utilisation in the non
-food 
consumer goods industries, to the extent that they reflect the evolution of demand 
relative to supply, may point to some strengthening in pricing power.

 Targeted longer

provide financing to 
euro area credit institutions with a maturity of up to 
four
 years at attractive 
conditions.
 Two series of operations were launched. 
The
 first series of eight 
operations (TLTRO
-I) was announced in June 2014.
35 It was followed by a second
 series of four operations (TLTRO
-II), announced in March 2016.
36 Under TLTRO
-II, 
banks could borrow up to 30% of the amount of their existing stock of loans to non
-financial corporations and households (excluding loans to households for house 
purchase). Moreover, banks were given the opportunity to repay funds borrowed 

under TLTRO
-I early and switch to TLTRO
-II funds. Such a shift of funding was 
rendered attractive for two reasons: first, it lengthened the maturity of bank funding 

and, second, it lowered the cost as the average cost of TLTRO
-I funding stands at 
around 10
 basis points, while the maximum rate banks will have to pay for TLTRO
-II 
funding is zero.

lending over a reference period exceeded a bank
-specific benchmark could borrow 
more 
in the final six TLTRO
-I operations and the maximum additional amount was 
set at 
three
 times the amount by which 
their
 net lending 
had exceeded their
 benchmark. Second, banks which did not 
meet
 the
ir lending benchmarks were 
required to repay their TLTRO
-I borrowings early. 
Incentives for lending 
are
 provided 
in a different form under
 TLTRO
-II. Rather than penalising banks that fail to meet 
their benchmarks, TLTRO
-II provides rewards
, in the form of lower interest rates
, for 
banks which outperform their benchmarks. Banks whose eligible net lending in the 

period between 1
 February 2016 and 31
 January 2018 exceeds their l
ending 
benchmark
s 
will benefit from a rate reduction. The TLTRO
-II rate can be as low as

participated in
 the operations and

TLTRO
-I was 
part of the credit easing package 
of measures 
which 
also 
included cuts in policy rates 
(bringing the deposit facility rate into negative territory for the first time) and the announcement 
of the 
intensifi
cation of
 work towards outright purchases of 
asset
-backed
 securities
. In addition, the use of the 
fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment in main refinancing operations was prolonged and the 
weekly fine
-tuning operations to sterilise the liquidity injected 
under the Securities Markets Programme 
were suspended.

Counterparties will qualify for this rate (the deposit facility rate

for example for loan sales and purchases and for securitisation) exceeds their benchmark stocks of 

eligible loans by 2.5% or more

, provided them with 
incentive
s 
to increase their supply of targeted credit. The 
design of the measure thereby ensured that the reduction in 
funding 
cost
s 
that banks 
benefit from is passed on to borrowers. Moreover, to the extent that market
-based 
funding 
has 
been replaced with TLTRO
 funding,
 the measure has contributed to a 
reduc
tion in
 the supply of bank bonds. All other things being equal
, a decline
 in bank 
bond issuance generally reduces banks™ bond market funding costs, further 
easing
 funding conditions both 
for banks that 
bid
 in the TLTRO operations
 and for those that 
did not. The resulting more favourable credit conditions for borrowers (when the
 reduction in funding costs is passed on) 
in turn encourage borrowing and 
expenditure for investment and consumption.
 Banks

-II borrowings 
currently 
stand at 
•739 billion.
 The first 
TLTRO
-II operation (
TLTRO
-II.1, 
settled in June 2016) attracted bids amounting to 
•399 billion, which largely reflected shifts 
out 
of TLTRO
-I funding 
and into TLTRO
-II
 funding
 (see Chart
 A). The second and third 
TLTRO

(TLTRO

TLTRO

•45 billion and 
•62 billion respectively. Take
-up in the final 
operation 
(TLTRO
-II.4) 
was substantially higher at 
•233 billion, of which a significant 
share (
•216 
billion) constitute
d 
a net increase in TLTRO borrowings. The significant 
take
-up in the final operation reflects
 the overall attractive pricing of TLTRO

with

market
-based funding, and

, incentives for back

for several reasons. First, 
market participants were 
expecting
 further cuts in policy rates at the time of bidding for TLTRO
-II.1 and TLTRO
-II.2
. Postponing 
take
-up may have been preferable at that point in time in order to lock
-in the lowest 
possible rate. 
Moreover, back
-loading take
-up extends the tenor of the operation, over which market rates are likely 
to rise. Finally, it reduces the uncertainty surrounding the final TLTRO
-II rate, as banks had observed 
developments in their eligible loan
s for half of the reference period by the time they came to bid for 
TLTRO
-II.4 funding. This information allowed them to make a more accurate assessment of whether 
and by how much they were likely to outperform their lending benchmarks.

 The joint impact of TLTRO
-I and TLTRO
-II on bank intermediation cannot be 
easily split in
to the
 separate contribution
s 
of the two series
 at present.
 While 
high bidding volumes are welcome
, they do not constitute the right metric
 for
 assessing
 the effectiveness
 of the two TLTRO series. The measure of success is 
rather the improvement in funding conditions of final borrowers brought about by
 the 
TLTROs. Given the large set of banks that bid in both series, the significant rollover 
of TLTRO
-I funding into TLTRO
-II funding 
and the relatively short period
 since
 the 
settlement of the first TLTRO
-II
 operation for which bank lending data are available, it 
is current
ly difficult to split the overall impact of the TLTROs in
to
 the contribution of 
TLTRO
-I and the additional impact of TLTRO
-II. Instead, evidence of their joint 
impact on bank intermediation is provided below
. The
 TLTROs
, together with the other non
-standard measures introduced since 
June 2014, 
have proven effective in supporting
 the transmission of lower 
policy rates into better borrowing conditions for the euro area non
-financial 
private sector.
 The rates on loans to non
-financial corporations declined markedly 
immediately after the announcement of the first series of TLTROs (see Chart
 C). The 
declines were 
sharper
 in countries where the composite lending rates to non
-financial corporations had been elevated, 
thus,
 overall
, the cross
-country dispersion 
of lending rates also declined in parallel. Moreover, in vulnerable countries,
 banks 
that borrowed 
under
 TLTRO
-I 
reduced their rates by more
 than banks that abstained 
from bidding.
39 Finally, banks surveyed in the euro area bank lending survey 
have 
repeatedly reported that the TLTROs 
Œ 
including those 
of the second series 
Œ 
have 
cont
ributed to an easing 
of the terms and conditions on loans to enterprises and, 
albeit to a lesser extent, an easing of

 1 The slowdown in euro area productivity in a global
 context
 Higher labour productivity growth is 
a key 
factor in
 raising living standards in 
advanced economies
. 
However, labour productivity growth in the euro area 
has long 
been low, even before the recent global 
slowdown. Against 
such a backdrop, this 
article assesses the slowdown in euro area productivity growth 
from
 a wide range of
 theor
etical perspectives
 used 
to explain the global deceleration. These include the 
role of 
changes 
in sectoral composition of the economy
, 
the impact of the global 
financial crisis, 
the possibility of
 measurement errors
, a deceleration in the rate of 
technological progress and diffusion, declines in business dynamism
, and the 
misallocation of factors of
 production. 
The article also considers more specific local 
factors which may account for the longer
-lasting productivity weaknesses in the euro 
area, and argues that structural reforms are necessary to counter the area™s long
-standing productivity deficit
 with the United States.

Introduction
 Higher labour productivity growth is 
a key 
factor in
 raising living standards in 
advanced e
conomies.
 This is particularly the case
 in the euro area
, in view of the 
rapid
 increase projected in the age of the
 workforce
. Recent research suggests that 
while demographic effects have so far had only a modest impact on euro area 
productivity growth,
 rates of
 workforce ageing over coming decades 
are
 projected
 to 
increase, equivalent to forgoing around one
-quarter of projected
 productivity growth 
over the 2014
-35 horizon
.40 Recent l
abour productivity growth 
in the euro area 
has
, however,
 been low 
Œ 
by both historical and international standards 
Œ 
albeit against the backdrop of 
a generalised slowdown in global 
labour productivity
 growth.
 Given
 this broader
 deceleration, considerable debate remains as to the underlying causes. Some
 argue 

that the slowdown reflects factors which are mainly cyclical, related to the impact of 
the global financial crisis, 
while others emphasise longer
-standing structural drivers 
such as changes in the sectoral composition of the economy
, measurement errors
, a deceleration in the rate of technological progress and diffusion, or declines in 
business dynamism and misallocation of factors of production.

Some stylised facts on euro area productivity growth
 Regardless of the metric chosen to measure productivity, euro area labour 
productivity growth has slowed markedly since the onset of the global 
economic and financial crisis (see Chart 1).
 Over the period 2008
-16, annual 
growth in euro area 
labour 
productivity per person employed slowed to an average of 
around 0.5
% 
(based on a three
-year moving average), from an average of around 
1.1
% over
 the course of the decade to 2007. If we consider only the post
-crisis 
period of recovery from 2013 to 2016, euro area labour productivity growth averaged 
just 0.6% per year. Moreover, the slowdown is evident
 Œ 
albeit to varying degrees 
Œ 
regardless
 of whether productivity is measured as output per person employed, 
as 
output per hour worked
, or in terms of 
TFP.
                                                                     41  Throughout this article the ﬁpre

 and
 references to 
the ﬁcrisis periodﬂ
, without 
additional qualification,
 relate to the euro area crisis which runs
 from 2008
 to 20
12, encompassing the 
two euro area recessions and the intervening period
. The terms

-crisis periodﬂ and 
ﬁrecovery
ﬂ refer 
to the 
period
 from 2013 onwards (as far as

).

 The slowdown in euro area productivity in a global context
 50 The decline in euro area labou
r productivity growth is widespread 
at the 
sector 
level, reflecting a marked slowdown in within
-sector rates, rather than a shift in 
industrial structure towards 
sectors with 
low 
labour productivity.
 The secular 
trend towards 
services as 
an ever
-greater 
proportion
 of the total economy 
might
 be expected to result in a reduction in
 aggregate labour 
productivity growth, as
 productivity growth in these sectors is typically lower than in other (mainly industrial) 
sectors. However, a shift
-share analysis shows that the decline in aggregate 
labour 
productivity growth at the euro area level owes rather more to a marked slowing of 
within
-sector rates of 
labour 
productivity growth than to compositional effects. 
Using 
the standard ten
-sector national accounts breakdown
 of economic activities (NACE 
A10
42), 
Table 1 decomposes
 the 0.7
1 percentage 
point
 decline in 
average annual 
 labour productivity growth between the pre
-crisis period 1996
-2007 and the period 
2008-16 into (i) the share due to a slowing of within
-sector rates of 
labour 
productivity growth (holding
 employment shares 
constant at 2007 level
s); (ii) the 
decline due to the effects of a changing employment composition (holding sectoral 
labour 
productivity growth at 
pre
-crisis averages); and (iii) the cross
 effect, whereby 
aggregate labour 
productivity growth is typically boosted by faster employment 

growth in high 
labour 
productivity growth sectors.
43 The table shows that since the 
onset of the crisis
, within
-sector rates of 
labour 
productivity growth have fallen 
considerably
, while 
sectoral employment shifts
 have slightly supported aggregate 
labour 
productivity growth
, 
as the labour adjustment which occurred
 over the crisis 
was concentrated in 
sectors with 
low
er 
productivity. 
The predominance of the 
slowdown in within
-sector rates of growth as the main driver of the aggregate 
deceleration also holds if the crisis period is excluded (i.e. when considering the 
2013-16 period of recovery only).

A growth accounting approach
 for the euro area and the 
United States
 3.1
 Decomposing labour productivity growth
 Taking a growth accounting approach shows that the post
-crisis decline in 
average 
growth in labour 
productivity in the euro area and the United States 
can be traced back to 
both a marked reduction in TFP growth in comparison 
with pre
-crisis rates and, since 2013,
 a virtual absence of capital deepening.
 Using data from the European Commission™s AMECO database, Chart 
4 
decomposes the rate of labour productivity growth for the two economies into drivers 
                                                                    44  
Results are similar when productivity is measured on an hourly basis, 
al
though the 
picture is less 
com
prehensive, owing to the 
number of sectors for which data are available (only 22

the onset of the Great Recession in 2008 shows, overall, 
(see 
the first two 
columns for each economy
 in Chart 4) that the marked decline in labour productivity 
growth looks to be driven by a sharp reduction in the underlying rate of TFP growth 

in both economies. 
Over the 
2008-16 period as a whole, capital deepening did not 
decline in the euro area and 
suffered only a moderate decline 
in the United States; 
this was largely as a result of significant shedding of labour
 during
 the depths of the 
crisis period
 (in particular during the period 2008
-09).

(2008
-12 inclusive)
 was 
marked by strong declines in real GDP in both economies (albeit 
these declines did not last as long in the United States as in the euro area, where 
they spanned both the Great Recession and the sovereign debt crisis
). The second 
period covers
 the recovery, which began in 2013. D
ecomposing 
the interval since the 
onset of the crisis into these two sub

growth in
 the post

slowdown in capital deepening
 Capital deepening refers to the process of increasing the capital
-labour 
ratio 
by giving labour more capital to work with.
 However, 
the capital
-labour ratio may 
also indicate ﬁartificialﬂ capital deepening in periods of low net investment if 
significant shedding of
 labour mechanically increases the ratio of the existing net 
capital stock to a 
reduced
 workforce. Chart 5 shows that during the depths of the 
crisis, both economies saw some support to capital deepening
 Œ 
and, indeed, a slight 
increase in the rate of capital deepening in the euro area 
Œ 
mainly as a result of 
heavy
 shedding of labour in some countries and sectors (which mechanically 
supported
 capital deepening, notwithstanding
 markedly reduced net investm
ent45). Chart 5

Notes: 
Observations 
for 2016 are estimates based on the European Commission™s Winter 2016 Economic Forecast. Period averages correspond to 1996
-2007, 2008
-12, and 
2013-16, respectively.
 The slowdown in capital deepening since 2013 reflects both a slower rate of 

net investment and a recovery in employment growth
. Net investment has 
almost halved in the United States 
from pre
-crisis rates
, to around 1.7% per year 
over the 2013
-16 period, but has fallen much more in the euro area (and from a 
lower starting rate) to just 0.6% per year
 Œ 
which is 
around one
-quarter of the euro 
area™s pre
-crisis average annual rate of net investment.
46 However
, the decline in 
capital deepening in both economies
 since 2013
 also reflects a marked offsetting 
effect 
arising 
from 
growth in employment, which has been relatively strong in relation 
to the 
extent 
of the rebound
 in activity
. This 
effect 
has contained the rate of capital 
deepening
 and, in fact,
 fully offset the low 
(albeit now modestly expanding
) 
rate of 
inve
stment growth in the euro area.

 The slowdown in euro area productivity in a global context
 54 A number of reasons have been put 
forward to explain the slowdown in capital 
deepening 
since 2013
. These include 
(i) 
the strong concentration of the recovery in 
consumer
-driven sectors 
(common to
 both economies
) where
 growth 
is heavily 
concentrated in those services
 that are often the most labour
-intensive
47 and in 
which the potential for capital
-labour substitution remains somewhat limited, coupled 
with a persisting weakness
 in investment in construction (particularly in the euro 
area); 
(ii) 
the impact of the global financial crisis and ongoing credit constraints in its 
aftermath (discussed in Section 4.1, below
); 
and (iii) 
some 
further potential for
 offset 
to the ﬁ
artificial
ﬂ degree of capital deepening seen 
over
 the depths of the crisis. All 
three
 of these elements are likely to help explain the lower 
rates
 of capital deepening 
seen in both the United States and euro area economies over the period of 
recovery
. 
3.3
 A broader trend decline in TFP growth
 Considered o
ver the longer term, and from a more global perspective, it 
is
 the 
slowdown in TFP growth which seems to have been the key contributor to the 

slowdown
 in labour productivity growth since the mid
-1990s (see Chart 6).
 While estimates vary as to the magnitudes of pre
- 
and post
-crisis rates of TFP 
growth seen
 in each of the euro area and the United States (due mainly to 

differences in methodology
48), a consistent finding is that TFP growth in both has 
decelerated significantly since the crisis. 
Including estimates for 17 other
 advanced 
economies (see the shaded area in Chart 6),
 it becomes clear that
 a 
generalised 
decline in average rates of TFP growth 
is broadly detectable across advanced 
economies 
for the period since the mid
-1990s (albeit with a modest rebound
 from the 
negative rates of growth seen in the euro area during the depths of the global 

financial crisis)
. Euro area TFP performance ha
d 
been lacklustre, in comparison with 
most advanced economies, since the mid
-1990s.
                                                                     47

and (ii) the

organisations such as the IMF and the OECD,
 is that they
 typically suggest a marked decline in post

rates compared 
with pre

Causes of the 
productivity 
slowdown: contrasting views
 A range of competing explanations 
has 
been put forward in the literature to 
explain the secular decline over recent years 
in headline productivity growth 
generally, and 
in 
TFP growth in particular.
 This section assesses the 
potential
 of 
each of these factors in helping to explain the euro area™s recent slowdown in 
productivity growth
 in the context of the wider global deceleration.
 4.1
 The impact of the crisis on euro area productivity growth
 The global financial crisis which began in 2008 is likely to have contributed to 
the slower average rate of euro area productivity growth since the crisis.
 Several mechanisms are typically associated with slower productivity growth 
following financial boom
-bust cycles.
 First, the reallocation of resources previously 
associated with the build
-up of housing imbalances in some euro area economies 
prior to the onset of the Great Recession may be hindered by ongoing credit supply 

constraints in a slow
-to
-recover financial system.
49 These constraints 
are likely to 
limit the expansion of small and young
, but highly
 productive
, firms.
 Second, 
regulatory forbearance and inadequate insolvency regimes may also lock capital into 
                                                                    49

 though the crisis may have been in further reducing euro area
 productivity growth
 in the period since 2008, it does not, however, shed light 
on the more 
fundamental
 issue; why euro area productivity growth was 
comparatively slow (from an international perspective) 
before then
. This can be
 explained by an examination of the underlying determinants of 
labour productivity 
growth
; these are
 explored in detail below.
 4.2
 Measurement errors in output
s and inputs
 It is often suggested that mismeasurement may simply underestimate the real 
rate of 
productivity growth
 now seen in advanced economies
. A number of 
areas of concern regarding mismeasurement are discussed in the literature
. These 

include the
 mismeasurement of information and communications technology (
ICT
)-
related goods and services
, arisi
ng from
 the difficulty in measuring improvement
s in 
the quality
 of ICT hardware and software
 Œ 
in the United States, in particular,
 measured hardware prices 
have recently shown fall
s 
which some see as implausibly 
small in 
compar
ison
 with historical data.
 The literature also identifies the
 lack of 
an encompassing measurement of intangible investments in the national accounts
51; 
and considers the broader notion that many recent innovations are simply not 

marketed and th
erefore
 not captured in the national acco
unts
, so that the growth in 
GDP, on which productivity dynamics are based, is significantly understated
. 
 Notwithstanding
 the benefits of 
innovations
 associated with increasing 
numbers of free digital goods and the ﬁsharing economyﬂ
, market
-based
 TFP 
growth has slowed considerably over several 
consecutive decades
. As Robert 
Gordon
 notes, far
-reaching welfare 
implications for consumer
s 
associated with 
earlier innovations 
Œ 
including the invention of
 electricity and the telephone 
Œ 
have 
been around since well before
 the ICT revolution
.52  Potentially more relevant are the concerns regarding inadequate measurement of 
both 
intangible investments
 and improvements 
in the quality of
 ICT
-related goods 
and services and 
of labour, which may 
bias estimates of outputs and inputs and 
result in misleading conclusions regarding labour productivity and TFP growth.
 Attempts to mitigate these deficiencies are ongoing and include (i) concerted efforts 
                                                                    50

-based prices (and the wider link between 
ICT and productivity 
growth
); and (iii) greater efforts to better isolate the impact of improvements in skills. 
However, 
given the internationally synchronised slowdown in TFP growth seen since 
the 
onset of the Great Recession across countries at varying levels of economic 

development and with differing economic structures and varying degrees of 
educational attainment, mismeasurement seems unlikely to 
be a major cause of 
either 
the slowdown in TFP growth which has been measured across economies
, or 
the marked decline in euro area TFP growth observed since the onset of the crisis
. 
4.3
 A decline in the rate of technical progress
 A widely
-held view 
suggests that the decline in aggregate productivity growth 
across advanced economies is likely due to a slowing in 
the rate of 
technological progress across sectors, with technological innovations of 

recent years simply less ﬁrevolutionaryﬂ than in the past.
54 As a result, 
it is 
argued
, recent technological innovations may simply be less 
pervasive compared 
with earlier inventions such as the railway,
 electricity
 or the telephone, so that the 
impact on TFP growth is likely to be much lower.
 In a similar vein, others explain the slowdown in US TFP growth since the early 
2000s as a sign that the productivity
-enhancing 
effect of ICT innovations has 
run its course
 Œ 
as suggested by the fact that the slowdown in US productivity 

growth is most pronounced in sectors in which ICT is produced or 
intensively used.
55 However, 
many 
counter that the full impact of the ICT revolution has not yet been 
realised and point to the potential yields from, for example, miniaturised products 
with embedded connectivity, artificial intelligence, robotics, self
-driving cars, drones, 
3D printing, cloud services and
 big data, arguing that substantial gains in aggregate 
productivity are likely to be seen only with a considerable lag
56. Moreover, the 
argument that a slowdown in the pace of technological progress explains the marked 

deceleration in euro area TFP growth since the crisis seems somewhat 

unconvincing, not least 
because
 the euro area saw less of a boost to TFP growth 
from the ICT revolution 
than
 that seen in, for example, the United States
. 
                                                                    53

 More anecdotally, there have been important technological advances in recent 
years which may still bring substantial gains in aggregate productivity, albeit 
with a lag.
 These advances are likely to enhance networking and coope
ration, as 
well as to increase the accessibility of products and services
 and the speed at which 
they can be supplied.
 4.4
 A decline in the rate of technology diffusion
 and an increase in 
input misallocation
 Potentially 
more important than any possible waning of innovation may be 
the 
fact 
that the pace of technology diffusion has declined
, so that
 the latest 
inventions are not incorporated in
to the production process
es of 
businesses
 as rapidly
 as in
 previous
 years.
 For technological innovations to have a no
ticeable 
impact on 
the 
TFP growth of 
businesses
, corresponding changes in organisational 
structures and business models are often needed. One possible indicator of 
the 
extent of technology diffusion, as
 proposed by the OECD
, is the gap between 
the 
labour productivity growth of global frontier firms 
Œ 
those creating the new knowledge 
Œ 
and non
-frontier firms, also called ﬁlaggardsﬂ, operating in the same 
sector
.57 According to this indicator, technology diffusion declined in the early 2000s in 
advance
d OECD economies
 (when comparable cross
-country firm
-level data for 
Europe became available), as shown by the increasing gap in the labour 
productivity 
performance of frontier and non
-frontier firms operating in the same sector (see 
Charts 9
a and 9b).
 The 
slowdown in technology diffusion has been 
particularly 
pronounced in 
services in 
the euro area
, relative to other advanced economies.
 Using the
                                                                     57

a and 9b show that the
 gap in labour 
productivity between 
the 
frontier firms 
operating in the OECD and the non

widened
 prior to the global financial 
crisis. Although evident in both manufacturing and services, technological diffusion 
looks to have been noticeably slower in euro area serv
ices 
than in 
services in 
other 
advanced economies. This productivity gap declined moderately during the crisis, 

possibly due to the exit from the market of the least productive non
-frontier firms, but 
it appears to have widened again 
Œ 
at least as far as services are concerned.

 Business dynamism affects the
 allocation of capital and/or labour across firms 
and
 this
 can have a direct impact on within
-sector 
labour 
productivity growth.
 A significant determinant of 
labour 
productivity growth is the degree of efficiency with 
which such production inputs are allocated across firms, even within narrowly 

defined 
sectors (
ﬁallocative efficiency
ﬂ).63 Given the 
heterogeneity
 in the
 performance
 of firms
, 
significant aggregate labour productivity gains can stem from the 
reallocation of resources (including labour and capital
) 
from low
- 
to high
-productivity 
firms
; research suggests that this may explain up to half of 
the aggregate labour 
productivity growth in a mature economy.
64 The most frequently used, albeit 
imperfect, indicator of capital and labour misallocation is the dispersion in the 

marginal revenue product of capital and labour across firms within a given sector.
65 The intuition underlying this measure is that for allocative efficiency to be achieved in 
a given sector where firms are assumed to face the same marginal costs, resources 
should flow across firms until
 the marginal productivity of inputs is equalised. 
However, the presence of frictions in labour, product and credit markets
 may
 hinder 
reallocation
 and can thus 
significantly dampen 
labour 
productivity dynamics
. The 
larger th
e 
dispersion
 in the marginal revenue product of capital and labour
, the 
greater
 the potential 
drag on aggregate 
labour productivity
 growth
.

 The slowdown in euro area productivity in a global context
 63 There is evidence 
in 
several 
euro area countries of rising inefficiency in the 
allocation of capital, compared with flatter dynamics 
for the
 misall
ocation
 of 
labour
. Again using the 
cross
-country
, cross
-sector CompNet data, capital 
misallocation 
appears to have
 been rising since the early 2000s in most euro area 
countries
 for which data are available
 (with the exception of Slovakia
; 
see Chart 
12a). 
Moreover, this upward trend has been mainly driven by 
the 
services
 sectors. 
Meanwhile, the increase in labour misallocation has been much less marked (see 
Chart 1
2b), with Spain even recording a slight decrease. Similar trends have been 
noted
 for 
capital and for labour in other mature economies
, such as the United 
States and Japan.

Additional constraints in the euro area
 Aside from the global factors considered above, there may be a number of 
additional European
-specific factors,
 resulting from 
structural
 rigidities, which 
help to explain the long
-standing
 labour 
productivity gap between the euro 
area and the United States
. These may be connected with more highly regulated 
product, labour and financial markets, legal and regulatory
 obstacles
 to
 sectoral 
reallocation
, or wider structural impediments such as a lower prevalence of ICT
-relevant skills in the euro area
. Similarl
y, there may be a tendency in the euro area 

towards a less
 wholesale approach to restructuring (in order 
to 
better exploit the full 
                                                                    66

 The contribution
 of structural reforms 
to TFP
 growth
 and an assessment of the role of 
national productivity boards
 Over the past decade a growing body of literature has sought to assess the impact of
 structural and 
institutional conditions on 
TFP 
growth. The seminal work of Aghion and Howitt
69 showed that non
-frontier countries could gain from structural policies favouring cost
-efficient adoption of existing 
technologies, while countries operating at the frontier would profit more from policies 
to 
promote 
innovation 
(e.g. investment in higher education
, and research and development
). 
Robust evidence 
has 
since 
been collected showing how excessive regulation in certain sectors negatively affects 
TFP growth and helps explain the productivity gap
 between countries operating at the frontier and 

the followers.
 Improving institutional and structural factors can lead to higher TFP growth. Cette et al.
70 suggest 
that euro area countries could achieve significantly higher 
TFP growth if all moved towards best 
euro area practice in reducing tariff barriers and reducing employment prote
ction, with gains 
potentially largest for th
ose
 countries with the most regulated markets. Work carried out 
by the 
ECB
71 also suggests that the 
soundness
 of economic institutions (as evidenced, for example, by
 application of the rule of law, control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality), the 
complexity of 
the business environment (in terms of starting a business, 
obtaining
 credit, trading 
across borders), and the level of employment protection
, all contribute to the differences in TFP 
performa
nce across euro area countries.
 Structural and institutional reforms can improve 
TFP via different channels. They improve the 
allocation of resources by promoting more efficient product and labour markets and
 better 
institutional frameworks (including 
those addressing insolvency). Recent OECD
 work
72 has shown 
that
 improving the efficiency of insolvency regimes is a particularly important structural policy in 
shaping aggregate 
TFP growth, 
as it
 lessens the
 obstacles to orderly exit 
for
 failing firms. A more 
competitive and business
-friendly environment also increases
 dynamic efficiency, as higher 
levels 
of 
competition increase incentives to innovate, thus facilitating technological progress. Structural 

reforms tend to reduce the 
labour 
productivity gap between 
those 
firms operating at the frontier and 
the followers, 
since
 removing protection and barriers to entry promotes the diffusion of ideas to 
laggard firms and encourages improvements in management quality. There 
could
 also be important 
spillover
 effects of these reforms, particularly if the
y 
are concentrated in upstream service
s 
sectors 
and lead to cost and efficiency savings for downstream producers. The role of the newly 
established

 The slowdown in euro area productivity in a global context
 66 national 
productivity 
boards 
(NPBs) may
 contribute to fostering productivity
-enhancing reforms 
across the euro area countries.
 The role of 
national 
productivity 
boards
 On 20 September 2016 the European Council recommended the establishment of 
productivity 
boards at 
the 
national level
 across the EU. These boards are expected to be operational by March 
2018. The recommendation 
was
 laid down in the Five Presidents™ Report
73, which stressed the 
importance of convergence as a means of improving and equalising resilience of European 
economic structures. 
NPBs
 are expected to be a key element of 
Stage 1 of E
uropean 
Monetary 
Union
 deepening, 
whic
h aims to 
strengthen
 the current institutional setting and encourage greater 
progress of
 euro area countries towards best practice, leading to higher aggregate performance.
 The Council™s recommendation specifies that ﬁthese boards should analyse productivity and 

competitiveness developments including relative to global competitors, taking into account national 
specificities and established practices.ﬂ It also stresses that the notion
s 
of productivity and 

competitiveness should be 
considered comprehensive
ly, paying
 attention to the
ir long
-term drivers
 such as
 innovation and the capacity to attract investment, the quality of businesses and human 
capital,
 and cost and non
-cost factors. The recommendation allows for different types of institutional 
design (for example
 the tasks of NPBs may be carried out by bodies which already exist), provided 
that certain minimum requirement
s 
are met
 with regard to, in particular
, functional independence, 
analytical rigour and transparency.
 Some euro area countries 
Œ 
for example 
Belgium, 
Germany, Ireland, 
France
 and the Netherlands
 Œ 
already have bodies that perform tasks of a similar nature to the remit of the 
productivity 
boards. 
While there are differences across 
the countries
 mentioned, 
each of these bodies general
ly 
has 
both an ex
 ante role 
(in that it
 evaluates
 policies proposed by the 
relevant 
government) and 
an ex post role (
it monit
ors the implementation of such policies).
 The 
NPBs
 are expected to contribute to the concrete design
 and foster national ownership 
of 
productivity
-enhancing structural reforms. It appears to be crucial
 that awareness within individual 
euro area countries of the benefit of structural reforms is enhanced and that independent technical 

bodies 
assist
 in the design of these reforms 
and in 
monitoring the
ir implementation. These 
boards 
are also expected to increase coordination of structural reform
 implementation at the euro area 
level
. To meet this objective
, the Council™s 
recommendation
 proposes
 a regular exchange of views 
and best practice among the 
productivity 
boards of the euro area countries. Moreover, it is also 
envisaged
 that
 the
 work and recommendations
 of the productivity boards
 could be 
assisted
 by the 
Commission at the supranational le
vel, 
within the framework
 of the European Semester. Strong 
information sharing, exchange of best practice and a deeper understanding of the obstacles to 
higher 
growth in labour productivity and competitiveness should make it easier
 to 
align policies that 
are both in the best interests of the European Union as a whole and 
which 
target specific needs at 
the country
 level.

 The slowdown in euro area productivity in a global context
 67 6 
Concluding remarks
 The slowdown in euro area productivity growth since the economic and 
financial crisis is likely to stem from
 a combination of cyclical and secular 
forces.
 On the cyclical side, increased uncertainty and credit restrictions 
arising
 from 
the long
-running
 crisis are likely to have held back some innovative activities and 
growth of firms
 with high productivity, slowed the reallocation of resources from less 
to more productive units, as well as
 reduced the willingness of firms to take on 
entrepreneurial risk. Nevertheless, the marked slowdown seen 
since 
the 
crisis 
represents the continuation of a downward trend in labour productivity growth across 
advanced economies,
 which began in the 
mid
-1990s.
 From a longer
-term perspective, 
labour 
productivity growth 
in the euro area 
has been weak by international standards for two decades
. This deficit is likely 
to reflect long
-standing structural rigidities
 Œ 
including more highly
-regulated product 
and labour markets 
Œ 
which constrain business growth and innovation in the euro 
area to a greater extent than in many other advanced economies. There is now a 
significant and growing body of evidence highlighting the mechanisms and extent of 
ﬁbusiness unfriendlyﬂ administrative and bureaucratic burdens on labour productivity 

growth. These relate, 
inter alia, to deficiencies in institutional and regulatory quality, 
impediments to entry and exit of
 firms, limitations on credit availability, higher debt 
workout costs, deficiencies in systems of contract enforcement, and the design of 
employment protection legislation.
 Structural reforms to boost labour productivity growth in the euro area are 
particularly pressing in the light of the area™s aging population and because 

the full beneficial effects of such reforms are only visible over the medium 

term
. While the economic recovery is firming, a reinvigoration of the reform process 
is needed to translate the cyclical pick
-up in
to
 a stronger trend 
productivity growth. 
Reforms addressing key institutional weaknesses such as
 bottlenecks and 
inefficiencies in the regulatory system, inefficiencies and waste in public 

administration, poor control of corruption and malfunctioning judicial systems appear 

to be critical
 in many euro area countries. Better debt workout mechanisms, 
including enhanced efficiency of judicial processes and out
-of-court mechanisms
, would help alleviate the debt burden of viable
, productive firms, facilitate exit of 
unviable firms and open
 markets for new start
-ups. In many cases, these reforms are 
likely to entail relatively low short term economic costs, yet
 are key to instilling 

confidence, improving the business environment, and 
boosting labour productivity
. The completion of a capital markets union
 would also
 provide entrepreneurs and 
innovators with alternative sources of financing for innovative projects. Finally, 

enhancing
 further efforts to improve skill
s 
acquisition and mobi
lity 
would 
aid sectoral 
reallocation and thus allow all citizens to benefit from a higher growth economy
. 
 By placing 
labour 
productivity growth firmly at the core of post
-crisis 
economic policy, the newly created National Productivity Boards could help to
 
increase the impetus for further structural reforms which are needed to boost 

labour 
productivity growth 
in the euro area 
Œ 
in a sustainable way 
Œ 
over 
coming decades.
 The success 
of the NPBs will, however, depend in large part on 
the various agents 
involved 
being willing to 
undertake the necessary reforms

 Harmonised statistics on payment services in the Single Euro Payments Area
 68 2 Harmonised statistics on payment services in the Single 
Euro Payments Area
 The annual payments statistics compiled by the E
uropean 
System of 
Central 
Banks 
(ESCB)
 have recently been significantly enhanced. This is due to the need to reflect 
substantial
 developments in the payments market in Europe, in particular the 
implementation of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). This article presents the 
rationale for the 
enhancements
 made
 to the payments statistics and describes 
how 
reporting 
has been improved and harmonisation
 increased
. It provides an overview 
of the results of the first production rounds in accordance with the 
new reporting
 framework
, highlighting the 
enhanced
 detail, quality, comparability and usa
bility
 of 
the statistics. Moreover, the article 
highlights 
the need for further updat
ing
 of the 
reporting requirements to keep the statistics fit for use.
 Introduction
 Payments statistics serve two main purpose
s: 
(i) 
to provide an overview to the 
general public and relevant stakeholders of the
 world of payments in Europe in 
terms of volumes, values, services
, providers
 and systems
; 
and
 (ii)
 to support 

ESCB 
policy decisions
 in this area with relevant statistical 
information
. Both 
purposes entail updating the reporting framework
 to take into account the evolution 
of the payments market. 
A new 
legal act
74 was adopted in late 2013, which led to the 
enhancem
ent of European payments statistics by requiring them to 
reflect 
Œ 
among 
other
 things
 Œ 
changes brought about by the implementation of SEPA 
through
 the 
related European legislation
, in particular
 the
 Payment Services Directive
75 (PSD). 
The 
new legislation was
 also aimed at better covering innovations, especially 
regarding payment initiation
 channels. Further 
work
 on these aspects
 is still needed 
in the
 light of ongoing developments in technology and legislation.
 In order to enhance the legal framework for European payments statistics, a 

structured 
merits and costs procedure
 was followed, which involved the relevant 
ESCB
 committees and w
orking 
groups and culminated in
 the final decision of 
the ECB Governing Council
 in 2013
. The
 procedure was set up to assess the 
merits and costs of preparing new or enhanced ESCB statistics, with the aim of 
minimising the reporting burden. It
 was launched in 2011
, prior
 to an overhaul of the 
existing statistics on payments aimed at reflecting new conditions, in particular those 
created by SEPA.
 The procedure
 comprised a fact
-finding exercise, a 
costs
 assessment and a 
merits
 assessment, followed by the matching of merits and costs
 related to the proposed enhancements
. The 
fact
-finding exercise 
enabled
 input to be
                                                                     74

 Harmonised statistics on payment services in the Single Euro Payments Area
 69 gathered
 from the perspective of data report
ers
, collectors and users, at both
 the
 national and European level
s; it was intended to support the development of an 
appropriately define
d 
and harmonise
d 
reporting population, and 
to 
prepare for the 
costs assessment
 through the establishment of
 various options for future reporting
. 
The cost
s 
assessment distinguished between implementation costs and running 
costs, specified 
per actor involved in the reporting process
 and per new item to be 
reported. The merits assessment combined quantitative and qualitative 
considerations
 regarding
 the usefulness and relevance of the data for the fulfilment 
of 
ESCB
 tasks
. 
The proposed enhancements (especially those with higher costs) 
wer
e then reviewed, taking into account their merits, in order to determine the actual 
changes to implement under a cost
-conscious approach. Following
 the
 merits and 
costs
 procedure
 the reporting population was expanded and
 the reporting framework 
enhanced
 and harmonised to ensure better comparability, in particular
 through 
methodological changes
 and new breakdowns. The enhancements help ensure that
 payments carried out in both SEPA and domestic formats are more closely 

monitored
, and 
that 
new information
 is s
et out
 on payment service providers and 
payment services.
 These enhancements are analysed in more detail in the 
subsequent sections of this article.
 This article considers the process
 that led to the current 
enhanced 
payments 
statistics, their implementati
on and prospects for further enhancements.

 the recently enhanced legal framework
. The third section 
focuses 
on the results of the first production rounds based on the new methodology. 

The fourth section
 concludes

 to the next review of the legal 
framework for European payments statistics.
 Legal framework and recent enhancements
 The legal framework for the compilation of payments statistics has
 recently
 been enhanced
 following the ECB™s merits and costs procedure
. Up to 
reference year 2013 these statistics were collected on the basis of the reporting 

framework set out in 
an ECB Guideline
76 addressed to Eurosystem national central 
banks (
NCBs
). In the absence of actual data, the Guideline allowed for 
NCBs 
to
 compile the statistics on a best efforts basis, relying on external data sources.
77 NCBs could also provide
 estimates or 
provisional
 data 
if actual figures were 
not 
available
. In order to increase the quality
 and comparability of data across countries,
 and 
thus
 the
 usa
bility
 of the statistics, it was 
consider
ed necessary to harmonise 
the reporting obligations and to expand the reporting population to all relevant 
                                                                    76  
Guideline of the European Central Bank of 1 August 2007 on monetary, financial institutions and 
markets statistics (recast) (ECB/2007/9) 
(OJ L 341, 27.12.2007, p. 1).
 77  
ECB Regulations concerning the collection of statistical information are legal acts directly addressed to 

the relevant reporting agents. ECB Guidelines on statistics are addressed to NCBs, 
establish
ing
 obligations for them
 to report statistics to the ECB
, without having a direct legal effect on the reporting 
agents and their reporting burden. Therefore, in the absence of actual data already available at the 

NCB, external data sources may also be used. Consequently, the cove
rage of the statistics collected 
based on an ECB Guideline may vary between countries owing to different reporting populations.

 Harmonised statistics on payment services in the Single Euro Payments Area
 70 institutions.
 Accordingly, as of reference year 2014, payments statistics have been
 collected 
on an annual basis in line with 
Regulation
 ECB/2013/43,
 which is 
addressed to all
 payment service providers and payment system operators
 resident 
in the euro area
.78 Payment service providers (PSPs) are institutions 
Œ 
defined in the 
PSD 
Œ 
which provide
 payment services
 throughout the 
European Union. They 
comprise mainly credit institutions, electronic money institutions and payment 
institutions. Payment system opera
tors (PSOs) are
 legal entit
ies
 that 
are
 legally 
responsible for operating a payment
 system
. In accordance with the provisions of the 
Regulation, 
the ECB
 maintains and publishes a list of institutions operating in the 
European 
Union
 with relevance for payments statistics.
 This list comprises all PSPs
 and PSOs resident
 in EU countries
. Payments statistics are compiled through harmonised data collection 
managed at
 the
 national level by each 
EU NCB.
 PSPs and PSOs 
report the 
statistics 
to the NCB of the Member
 State 
of residency. The NCBs then aggregate 
the data and submit the national statistics to the ECB. The latter carries out the final 

level of aggregation to
 produce
 euro area
 and EU figures and
 publishes
 all 
the 
datasets
.  
Close cooperation between the ECB
 and the statistical departments of the 
NCBs is crucial for the production of high
-quality statistics.
 During the annual 
production rounds
 for payments statistics
, 
the ECB and NCBs closely cooperate 
through bilateral and multilateral interactions
, and
 the 
ECB ensur
es the required 
degree of 
cross
-country harmonisation
. In particular,
 in accordance with the ECB™s 
Statis
tics Quality Framework and quality assurance procedures
, 
the ECB carries out 
a 
comprehensive set of
 quality checks on the data reported by each NCB. These 
checks have been jointly developed and agreed on within the ESCB and relate to the 

completeness of 
the 
data provided 
and the consistency of the statistics. Revisions to 
previously transmitted data are also analysed and plausibility checks are performed 
to detect outliers in the reported data (i.e. observations with a clearly larger or 
smaller value than other observations of the time series). During the produ
ction
, the 
NCBs are given enough time to 
address
 the issues detected and to correct any 
potentially
 incorrect data. More in
-depth analysis of the statistics takes place outside 
the regular production round
s, when there is more time for fine
-tuning concepts
 related to the technical reporting or the underlying methodology
.                                                                     78  
Additional requirements are laid down in Guideline ECB/2014/15 
(as amended), addressed to euro 
area NCBs. See 2014/810/EU: Guideline of the European Central Bank of 4 April 2014 on monetary 

and financial statistics (recast) (ECB/2014/15) (OJ L 340, 26.11.2014, p. 1). In addition, 

Recommendation ECB/2013/44 encourages
 the
 NCBs of Member States whose currency is not the 
euro to i
mplement the reporting framework set out in the Regulation
. See Recommendation of the 

European Central Bank of 28 November 2013 on payments statistics (ECB/2013/44) (OJ C 5, 

9.1.2014, p. 1).

 Harmonised statistics on payment services in the Single Euro Payments Area
 71 Results of the first annual production rounds based on the 
enhanced methodology
 Compared with the previous reporting framework, several important 
methodological changes 
Œ 
in addition to the
 expansion of the reporting 
population 
Œ 
have been introduced in the enhanced statistics.
 Overall, the 
methodology applied to both existing and new requirements has been aligned with 

the definitions given in the relevant EU legislation, such as the PSD, 
Electronic 
Money Directive
79, 
Regulation on MFI balance sheet statistics
80 and European 
System of Accounts (ESA 2010) Regulation
81. First of all, to monitor the changes 
brought about by SEPA, a new concept of residency has been adopted: the new 
statistics mark a shift from using the location of the payer or the terminal
82 as the 
basis for the reporting to using the residency of the PSP. This is in line with the 
principle that, within SEPA, consumers, businesses and public administrations
 can 
advanta
geously execute both domestic and cross
-border
83 payments in euro
 via a 
single institution
 and under the same conditions, irrespective of the physical location 
of the payer, the payee or the PSPs involved.
 The enhanced requirements now enable payments involving domestic PSPs 
only to be distinguished from those also involving PSPs resident outside the 
reporting country
. Moreover, for all main categories of sent payment
s, a breakdown 
by counterparty country is required when the counterparty belongs to the E
uro
pean Union
. Information is also requested on cross
-border payments
 received. 
This
 enables cross
-country payment patterns within SEPA
 to be detected.
  The statistics show that in
 the
 European 
Union
 most payment
s 
are still carried 
out between 
PSPs resident 
in the same country
. In particular, as can be seen 
in Chart 1 below, 
with
in the 
euro area, around
 2.5% of credit transfers and 1.7% of 
direct debits initiated in 2015 were sent to an account held 
at a PSP resident in 
another country.
 This means that the vast majority 
Œ 
above 97% 
Œ 
were still 
domestic.
 For the E
uropean 
Union
 as a whole, the shares 
were
 2.9% and 1.7%
 respectively
; however
, data are not available for all non
-euro area 
countries. 
Compared with cross
-border credit transfers and direct debits, t
he share of 
cross
-border 
card payments is higher for both
 the
 euro area and 
the 
European 
Union
: in 
the 
euro area
, 7.6% of card payments sent from accounts held 
at euro area 
PSPs were cross
-border payment
s; for the
 European Union as a
 whole
, the share 
was 7.
4%.
 Around 92.5% of EU card payments were still domestic.
                                                                     79

 Overall, the new statistics illustrate how the usage of card payments has 
increased in recent years to the extent that they account for almost half of all 
cashless payments in the European Union.
 In particular, in the five
-year period up 
to the end of 2015, the share of card payments increased from 39% to 47% in the 
European Union and from 34% to 41% in the euro area.
84 Consequently, the relative

and 21% respectively in the European Union and 25% and 26% respectively in the 

euro area (see Chart 2)

* *2014/810/EU: Guideline of the European Central Bank of 4 April 2014 on monetary and financial statistics (recast) (ECB/2014/15) (OJ L 340, 26.11.2014, p. 1).
 **Non
-MFIs are natural or legal persons who do not belong to the monetary financial institutions (MFI) sector. For the purpose of payments statistics, all PSPs are excluded from the 
non-MFI sector.
 The harmonisation of the reporting population and underlying methodology 
across countries, made possible by framing the requirements within an ECB
 Regulation, has resulted in a clear improvement in the comparability and 
usability of the statistics.
 In particular, in contrast with the previous reporting 
framework, the Regulation provides a comprehensive set of data definitions to be 
applied in a similar way by all reporting agents. When needed, further clarifications 
have been agreed on within the applicable ESCB committees and working groups. 
This is to ensure that the quality of the statistics remains high and that the national 

figures can be used f
or country comparisons despite certain country
-specific 
phenomena.
 As an example, in Germany one
-off direct debits initiated by a payment 
card (electronic direct debits known as ﬁELVﬂ transactions) were previously reported
 
under card paymen
ts
. With the
 adoption of
 Regulation ECB/2013/43, as of
 reference 
year 2014 these transactions have been
 reported as direct debits, in accordance 
with 
the underlying payment 
service
 used. This change enhance
s 
the comparability 
of data across countries.
 The new requirements
 have significantly enhanced the quality
 and overall 
comparability
 of the statistics, and
 remaining
 instances of inconsistency 
within and across countries
 are expected to be phased out soon
. These 
inconsistencies are
 mainly due to the reclassification of 
certain
 data. Relevant 
examples are offered by the figures on credit transfers, direct debits and book entries

Finally, the expectation is for the homogeneity and reliability of data to 
increase over time.
 In fact, different practices followed by NCBs have been further 
harmonised through continuous dialogue within the central bank community and with 
the reporting agents.
 Next review of the ECB legal framework for European payments 
statistics 
As technological, regulatory and other developments are impacting the retail 
payments landscape, th
e data collection
 may be reviewed 
at regular intervals
 and adjusted to market developments
 to keep the statistics fit for use.
 The
 need to continuously enhance statistical reporting in the field of payments is felt 

worldwide. 
The
 ECB and some Eurosystem
 NCBs are actively contributing to the 
work underway at the global level in their capacity as members
 of the Committee on 
Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) of the Bank for International 

Settlements
 (BIS)
. Methodological and definitional issues
 are
 currently being 
analysed by CPMI members,
 and a more general restructuring of the format of the 
statistics 
on payments, clearing and settlement systems published by the 
BIS is 
underway

rmation and the addition of new indicators relevant in analysing today™s evolving 
landscape.
 Payments fall within the scope of 
this 
analysis, especially 
considering
 the 
high relevance of technological advances and regulatory changes for the demand 
and the supply side of the payment industry.
 Box
 Business developments in the field of payment services in Europe
 Notable examples of 
potential
 information to be captured 
following
 further enhancements to
 payments statistics, from a technological perspective, 
incl
ude (i) 
whether a card payment was made 
in a 
contact or contactless
 mode, 
(ii) 
whether a mobile device was used for making a 
person
-to
-p
erson (P2P) or 
consumer
-to
-b
usiness (C2B) payment, and (iii)
 whether the payment 
was made using an e
-commerce payment solution. Other relevant developments that enhanced 
payments statistics may help monitor are those related to instant payments
, i.e. immediate or 
close
-to
-immediate transfers of reusable funds between end users, with 24/7/365 availability. From 
a regulatory perspective, the 
revised Payment Services Directive (EU/2015/2366)
85 (or ﬁ
PSD2
ﬂ) has 
introduced two new payment services, payment initiation services and account information services, 
which may generate the need to collect additional data from payment service providers.
 New or existing means of performing payments must first and foremost
 be secure. Enhanced 
payment
s 
statistics could also support 
the
 ECB and central
 banks 
in monitoring
 fraud levels as part 
of their
 oversight of payment instruments. The PSD2 has reinforced th
e 
need for fraud monitoring
 and requires PSPs to collect and report data on fraud relating to different means of payment.
86 In any case, 
further 
enhance
ments to the payments statistics intended to cover the above 
developments would need to take into account the timeline for the PSD2 and the related Regulatory 

Technical Standards to become applicable and for harmonised instant payments in euro to bec
ome 
available to end users. 
  As was the case with the 
latest
 update of the reporting framework, 
where
 a new or substantially enhanced regulation on statistics is introduced 
by the 

ECB
, it will
 always
 be preceded by a systematic assessment of the merits an
d costs 
associated with collecting
 the new data.
87 A 
review of the appropriateness 
of current reporting requirements, i.e. a post
-implementation assessment, is also part 
of the procedure
. 
The purpose is to 
evaluate 
the continued relevance of 
the
 statistics
, in particular
 whether
 they adequately 
meet
 the specified needs of the 
users and
 the
 new requirements. In the initial stage of the procedure the existing 
                                                                    85  
Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on

2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repea
ling Directive 2007/64/EC
 (OJ L 337, 
23.12.2015, p. 35
). 
86  
In this respect, overlaps and dual reporting to different authorities should be avoided.
 87  
Any future review of the reporting framework will be preceded by a merits and costs procedure before a 

decision is made as to the actual implementation of the proposed changes.

88 The implementation of any additional new 
requirements would increase
 the burden on businesses and should therefore be 
preceded by a careful, in
-depth assessment of the associated benefits and costs.
 Conclusions
 Significant
 developments in the European payments market called for the 
payments statistics compiled by the E
SCB to be updated
. Following
 a merits 
and costs procedure carried out in 2011 and 2012, a new ECB Regulation on 

payments statistics was introduced 
at end-2013. Correspondingly, as of reference 
year 2014
, all payment service providers and payment system operators resident in 

the euro area have been
 obliged to report the information included in the Regulation 
to the NCB of the Member State of residency
. In addition to the expansion of the reporting population, several new 
requirements 
and enhancements 
were added
 to keep the statistics fit for 
purpose.
 Existing definitions and concepts 
were
 clarified and
 aligned with the 
relevant European legislation. 
The ECB and NCBs
 cooperated closely in making 
these amendments
. 
 The new statistics show that the quality
 and comp
arability
 of the data has 
improved 
thanks
 to more harmonised reporting
 across countries and 
institutions
. However, some inconsistencies still exist across countries. These are 
currently being analysed and further clarification is being provided. Overall, i
t is 
expected that the homogeneity and reliability of the data 
will 
increase over time.
 In order to keep 
pace
 with the technological, regulatory and other 

developments that are impacting the payments landscape in Europe, the 

statistical reporting requireme
nts 
may
 be reviewed at regular intervals.
 In addition to European payments statistics, the ECB and some Eurosystem 

NCBs are also contributing to the work related to updating statistics on 

payments, clearing and settlement systems in CPMI countries publishe
d by 

the BIS.
                                                                       88  
For instance, the definition 
of cross
-border card payments 
used in payments statistics 
may
 need to be 
fine
-tuned to take into account the definition introduced in the Regulation on
 interchange fees for 
card
-based payment transactions. See Regulation (EU) 2015/751
 of the European Parliament and of 
the Council of 29 April 2015 on interchange fees for card
-based payment transactions (OJ L 123, 
19.5.2015, p. 1).
