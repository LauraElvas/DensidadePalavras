 Notes: The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2017. ﬁOtherﬂ refers to the difference between the total and the cr
editor sectors included in the chart.
 The increasing share of non
-bank financing in total euro area NFC exter
nal financing since 2008 
reflects both cyclical and structural factors. In the past, firms relied primarily on bank lending for 
their new external financing.
40 The net flow of finance from banks to firms contracted in the euro 
area at the height of the Grea
t Recession and of the euro area financial and sovereign debt crisis, 
before recovering gradually (see Chart B). The decline in bank lending reflected both demand and 
supply factors. The contraction of economic activity and the need to repair balance sheet
s reduced 
loan demand by NFCs, while the deterioration in the debt servicing capacity of firms and balance 
sheets of banks led to the tightening of credit standards and a decline in loan supply.
41 Moreover, 
NFCs increased their net issuance of debt securiti
es during the crisis to compensate for the decline 
in the availability of bank loans and, more recently, to benefit from the favourable market financing 
conditions supported by the ECB™s corporate sector purchase programme. Lending from OFIs to 
firms has a
lso increased, mirroring an increase in loans granted by financing SPEs to their parent 
companies. At the same time, NFCs increased their recourse to trade credit and intra
-sectoral loans 
and financed a larger share of their activities with internally gene
rated funds and higher retained 
earnings to mitigate the negative impact of lower credit supply on the availability of external debt 
financing. Overall, since the onset of the crisis, non
-bank financing sources have become 
significantly more important.

 1 Purpose of the ECB™s management report
 The management report is an integral part of the ECB™s Annual Accounts and is 
designed to provide readers with contextual information related to the 
financial 
statements.
1 Given that the ECB™s activities and operations are undertaken in 
support of its policy objectives, its financial position and result should be viewed in 
conj
unction with its policy actions.
 To this end, the management report presents the ECB™s key activities and 
operations
, as well as
 their impact on
 its financial statements. Furthermore, it 
analyses the main developments in the Balance Sheet and 
the 
Profit and Loss 
Account
 during the year
 and includes information on the ECB™s financial resources. 
Finally
, it 
describes 
the risk environment in which 
th
e ECB operates, providing 
information on the financial and operational risks 
to 
which the ECB is exposed, 
and the risk management
 policies used to mitigate risks.
 2 Activities 
The ECB is part of the Eurosystem, which has the primary objective 
of maintaining
 price stability. The ECB™s main tasks, as described in the Statute of the ESCB,
2 comprise the implementation of the monetary policy of the euro area, the conduct of 
foreign exchange operations, the management of the official foreign reserves of the 

euro area countries and the promotion of the smooth operation of payment systems.
 The ECB is 
also 
responsible for the effective and consistent functioning of the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), with a view to carrying out intrusive and effective 

banking supervision, contributing to the safety and soundness of the banking system 

and the stability of the financial system.
 The Eurosystem™s monetary policy operations are 
recorded
 in the financial 
statements of the ECB and of the euro area national central banks (
NCBs
), reflecting 
the principle of decentralised implementation of monetary policy in the Eurosystem. 
Figure
 1 
below provides an overview of the main operations and functions of the 
ECB in pursuit of its mandate, and their impact on the ECB™s financial stat
ements.

Implementation of 
monetary policy
Standard monetary 
policy 
operations in euro
Securities held for monetary policy 
purposes
Monetary policy operations conducted with the standard 
set of instruments (i.e. open market operations, standing 

facilities and minimum reserve requirements for credit 

institutions) are implemented in a decentralised manner by 

the NCBs of the 
Eurosystem
. Accordingly, these 
operations are not reflected in the ECB's 
financial 
statements.
Purchases 
of these securities are conducted by the ECB 
and NCBs of the 
Eurosystem
and are recorded under the 
balance sheet item ﬁSecurities held for monetary policy 

purposesﬂ. The securities currently held are accounted for 

at amortised cost, subject to impairment. 

Coupon accruals and amortised premiums and discounts 

are included in the Profit and Loss Account on a net basis 

under either ﬁOther interest incomeﬂ or ﬁOther interest 

expenseﬂ, depending on whether the net amount is 

positive or negative.
Securities lending
Liquidity
-providing operations in foreign 
currency
Securities held for monetary policy purposes are available 
for lending in the Eurosystem.* For the ECB, these 

operations are conducted via a 
specialisedinstitution. 
These operations are recorded in the balance sheet items 

ﬁOther liabilities to euro area credit institutions 

denominated in euroﬂ and ﬁLiabilities to non
-euro area 

residents denominated in euroﬂ if collateral is provided in 

the form of cash and this cash is still 
uninvested
. Otherwise, the related securities lending operations are 
recorded in 
off

The ECB acts as an intermediary between non
-euro area 
central banks and the 
Eurosystem
NCBs by means of 
swap transactions 
aimed 
at offering short

 3.1
 Balance 
Sheet
 Chart
 1 presents the main components of the ECB™s Balance Sheet over the period 
2013-17. The expansion of the ECB™s Balance Sheet started in the fourth quarter of 
2014, triggered by the acquisition of securities under the third covered bond 
purchase programme (CBPP3) and the asset
-backed securities purchas
e programme (ABSPP). This expansion
 has 
continued in 
subsequent
 years, owing 
mainly to the acquisition of securities under the public sector purchase programme 
(PSPP).
 In 2017 
the
 ECB™s total assets
 increased by 
•65.2
 billion to •41
4.2
 billion
, mainly 
owing
 to
 its share of
 purchases of securities under the asset purchase programme 
(APP)
3. These purchases resulted in an increase in the item ﬁSecurities held for 
monetary policy purposesﬂ, whil
e 
the cash settlement of those purchases via 
TARGET2 accounts led to a corresponding increase in ﬁIntra
-Eurosystem liabilitiesﬂ.

Increase in total assets 
in 2017
A 6 Euro
-denominated securities held for monetary policy purposes
 constituted 
55% of the 
ECB™s 
total assets as at 
the end
 of 2017
. Under this balance sheet 
position the ECB holds securities acquired in the context of the Securities Markets 
Programme (SMP), the three covered bond purchase programmes (CBPP1, 
CBPP
2 and CBPP
3), the ABSPP and the PSPP.
4 In
 2017 purchases of
 securities under the 
CBPP3, ABSPP and PSPP
5 continued
 on the basis of 
the Governing Council™s 
decisions on the overall monthly Eurosystem purchases and subject to 
predetermined eligibility criteria.
 As a result of the purchases, in 2017
 the 
portfolio of securities held for monetary 
policy purposes by the ECB increased by 
•67.6
 billion to •228.4
 billion
 (see 
Chart
 2), 
with PSPP purchases accounting for the majority of this increase. The decrease in 
holdings under the CBPP1
, CBPP2
 and SMP was due to redempt
ions, which 
amounted
 to •
1.5 
billion.

 In 2017 the total euro equivalent 
value 
of the 
ECB™s foreign reserve assets
, which 
consist of gold, special drawing rights, US dollars,
 Japanese yen and, 
commencing 
in 2017, Chinese renminbi, 
decreased
 by •5.7
 billion to •65.7
 billion.
 The 
euro equivalent value of the 
ECB™s 
holdings of gold and gold receivables 
decreased
 by •0.3
 billion to •17.6
 billion 
in 2017 
(see 
Chart
 3), 
owing to a decline in 
the market price of gold in euro terms, while
 the 
size of these
 holdings in fine ounces 

remained unchanged. This 
decrease
 also 
led to a 
reduction
 in the ECB™s revaluation 
accounts
, which fell
 by 
the same amount (see 
Section
 3.2).

The ECB does not acquire 
securities 
under the 
CSPP.

No further purchases were conducted under the first two 
covered bond 
purchase programmes
 or the 
SMP in 2017, as the Governing Council decided to cease these programmes.

 2017 the ECB invested 
the

 billion in Chinese renminbi
, making it the third currency in its foreign currency reserves.
6 The ECB funded this 
investment 
by 
selling
 a small portion of its US dollar holdings
 and reinvesting the full

ECB™s foreign currency holdings, accounting for approximately 
76% 
of the total.
 The ECB manages 
the
 investment of 
its 
foreign currency reserves 
using 
a 
three
-step
 process
. First, a strategic benchmark portfolio is designed by the ECB™s risk 
managers and approved by the Governing Council. Second, the ECB™s portfolio 
managers design the tactical benchmark
 portfolio, which is approved by the 
Executive Boar
d. Third, day
-to
-day investment operations are conducted in a 
decentralised manner by 
the 
NCBs.
 The ECB™s foreign currency reserves are mainly invested in securities and money 

market deposits or are held in current accounts (see 
Chart

s portfolio are valued at year
-end market prices.

 The purpose of the ECB™s foreign currency reserves is to finance potential 
interventions in the foreign exchange market. For this reason, the ECB™s foreign 
currency reserves 
are managed 
in accordance 
with three objectives
. In order of 
priority, 
those objectives are liquidity, safety and return. Therefore
, this portfolio 

mainly comprises securities with

 The net income resulting from the ECB™s assets and liabilities in a given financial 
year can
 be used to absorb potential losses incurred in the same year. In 2017 the 
ECB™s net income
 was 
•1.3
 billion, •0.1
 billion higher than in 
2016. In view of 
its
 exposure to financial risks 
(see
 Section
 4.1
), 
the ECB maintains a 
provision for foreign exchange rate (currency), interest rate, credit and gold 
price (commodity) risks
. The size of this provision is reviewed annually, taking a 
range of factors into account, including the level of holdings of risk
-bearing assets, 
the 
projected results for the coming year and a risk assessment. The risk provision, 

together with any amount held in the ECB™s general reserve fund, may not exceed 
the value of the capital paid up by the euro area NCBs. Since 2015 this provision has 
stood at its maximum 
permitted
 level of •7.6

as a result of the maturing of securities. In 2017, securities

 as a result of the 0% interest rate used by the Eurosystem in

 on financial assets 
amounted to •56
 million, which 
was 
•20 million lower 
than in 2016 (see Chart
 16), 
mainly as a result of the lower net realised price gains.
 The decrease in net realised price gains was mainly 
due to lower price gains on US
 dollar
-denominated securities, as their market value was negatively affected by the 
increasing trend in US dollar yields which started in 2015.
 This negative impact on the market price of the US dollar portfolio in 2017 was less 
than the corresponding impact in 2016, which explains the lower price write
-downs in 
2017 compared 
with
 the previous year
. The increase in net realised exchange rate and gold price gains was due to 
the 
realised currency gains resulting primarily from the sale of US dollar holdings 
to fund 
the creation of the Chinese renminbi portfolio.
 The

Risk management cycle
 The ECB is 
exposed
 to both financial and operational risks. The 
following 
sections 
focus on these risks, their sources and the applicable risk control framework
s. 
4.1
 Financial risks
 The Executive Board proposes policies and procedures that ensure an 
appropriate level of protection against 
the 
financial risks 
to which 
the ECB
 is 
exposed

the balance sheet
 of the Eurosystem, 
and it 
defines
 and review
s 
the associated methodologies and frameworks
. In this way, the 
RMC helps the decision
-making bodies to ensure an appropriate level of protection 
for the Eurosystem
. Financial risks arise
 from the ECB™s core activities and associated exposures.
 The risk control frameworks and limits that the ECB uses to manage its risk profile 

differ across types of operation, reflecting the policy or investment objectives of the 
different portfolios and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
 To monitor and assess the risks, the ECB relies on a number of risk estimation 
techniques developed in
-house
. These techniques are based on a joint market 
and credit risk simulation framework. The core modelling concepts, techniques and 
assumptions underlying the risk measures draw on industry standards and 
available 
market data. The risks are 
typically
 quantifie
d by
 the Expected Shortfall (ES),
11 estimated
 at the 99% confidence level, over a one
-year horizon. Two approaches
 are

The

number of risk 
estimation techniques 

developed in

A 20 used to calculate risks
: (i)
 the accounting approach, under which the ECB™s 
revaluation accounts are considered as a buffer in the calculation of risk estimates
 in 
line with all applicable accounting rules
; and (ii)
 the financial approach, under which 
the revaluation accounts are not considered as a buffer 
in the risk 
calculation
. The 
ECB also regularly 
calculates
 other risk measures at different confidence levels, 
performs sensitivity and stress scenario analyses, and 
assesses
 longer
-term 
projections of exposures and income to maintain a comprehensive picture of the 
risks.
12 The total risks of the ECB increased 
during 
the year.
 As at 31
 Dec
ember
 2017 the 
total financial risks for all the ECB™s portfolios combined, as measured by the 
ES at the 99% confidence level over a one
-year horizon following the accounting 
approach, stood at •10.6
 billion, which was •1.4
 billion higher than the risks 
estimated as at 31
 December
 2016. This increase was mainly due to the continued 
securities purchases in the context of the APP.
 Box
 1 
Change in the risk measure disclosed in the Annual Accounts
 Since 2007 the ECB has 
reported 
in its Annual Accounts the financial risks relating to 
all 
of its
 portfolios combined as measured by the financial 
Value at 
Risk (VaR) at a 95% confidence level 
over a one
-year horizon. 
As at 31
 December
 2016 Œ 
as 
reported in the 2016 Annual Accounts
 Œ 
thi
s 
amounted to 
•10.6
 billion
. 
In recent years the ECB has enhanced its risk modelling framework. Some of the changes 

implemented 
include the following:
 the ECB now uses 
the 
Expected 
Shortfall (
ES) 
at a 99% confidence level as the main measur
efor risk calculations, with other risk measures and confidence levels being used to provi
decomplementary information;
an ﬁaccounting approachﬂ has been devised in addition to the existing ﬁfinancial approachﬂ
.Under the financial approach the revaluation accounts are not considered as a buffer
 in thecalculation
 of risks, whereas under the accounting approach risks are quantified after
considering the revaluation accounts, in line with
 the applicable accountin
g rules. Therefore,
the two approaches reflect two different ways of looking at risks: the financial approac
hconsiders their impact on the ECB™s net equity, whereas the accounting approach considers
their impact on the ECB™s 
Profit and 
Loss 
Account.
The accounting approach is deemed more appropriate in the context of the Annual Accounts as it 

offers a clearer picture of the risks in terms of their accounting consequences. Therefore, also 

seeking to
 align 
published data with the internal risk modelling and reporting approach, the ECB
™s Annual Accounts will, 
henceforth
, report the ES at a 99% confidence level following the accounting 
approach, instead of the VaR at a 95% confidence level following the financial approach.

accounting

A 21 Depending on the size of the ECB™s revaluation accounts, the financial and accounting approach
es for measuring risks can result in significantly different risk estimates in terms of 
their 
size and 
composition. In particular, the financial approach, using the same risk measure and confidence 
level,
 results in larger risk estimates, mainly dominated by sizeable market risks associated with 
foreign reserve holdings. Since significant revaluation accounts exist for such exposures, the 

accounting approach results in lower risk figures, mainly driven
 by potential credit risk events.
 The change
over
 from the financial VaR
 95% to the accounting ES
 99% in 
the 
Annual Accounts 
for 
2017 results in a 
higher 
risk estimate in nominal terms (see Table
 1), as the increase in the risk 

estimate 
from choosing a higher confidence level (99% instead of 95%) and a more conservative 
risk measure (ES instead of VaR)
 more than compensates for the 
reduction in the risk estimate 
brought about by 
considering
 the
 revaluation accounts
 as a buffer
.

Credit risk arises from the ECB™s monetary policy portfolios, its euro
-denominated own funds portfolio and its foreign 
reserve holdings.
 While 
securities held for 
monetary policy
 purposes 
are valued at amortised cost subject to 
impairment
 and are therefore, in 
the 
absence of sales,
 not subject to price changes 
associated with 
credit migrations, they are still subject to credit default risk. Euro
-denominated own funds and foreign reserves are valued at market prices and, as 
such, are subject to credit migration and default risk. As a result of the continued 

purchases under the APP in 2017, the credit risk of the ECB increased compared 

with 
the previous 
year.
 Credit risk is mitigated mainly through the application of 
eligibility criteria
, due 
diligence procedures
 and limits that differ across portfolios.
 Currency and commodity risk
s 
arise from the ECB™s
 foreign currency an
d gold 
holdings.
 As a result of
 the 
decrease in revaluation accounts for these holdings, 
mainly owing to the appreciation of the euro against the US dollar, the currency and 

commodity risks, as measured following the accounting approach, increased 
compared
 with the previous year.
 In view of the policy role of
 these assets, the ECB does not hedge the
 related 
currency and commodity
 risks
. Instead, these risks are mitigated through the 
existence of revaluation accounts and the active diversification of the hol
dings 
across different currencies and gold
. The ECB
™s 
foreign reserves and euro
-denominated own funds are 
mainly 
invested in fixed income securities
 and are 
subject to 
mark
-to-market interest 
rate risk,
 given
 that they are valued at market prices. The ECB™s foreign reserves 
holdings are mainly invested in assets with relatively short maturities (see 
Chart
 6 in 
Section
 3.1
), while the assets in the own funds portfolio generally have longer

This risk, as measured following the 
accounting approach
, remained unchanged compared with 2016.
 The mark
-to
-market interest rate risk of the ECB 
is mitigated
 through asset allocation 
policies and the revaluation accounts.
 The ECB is also subject to interest rate r
isk 
arising from 
mismatches
 between 
the interest rate earned on its assets and the interest rate paid on its liabilities
, which has an impact on its net interest income. This 
risk 
is not directly linked to any 
particular portfolio but rather to the structure of the ECB™s 
Balance 
Sheet as a whole
 and, in particular, the existence of maturity and yield mismatches between assets 
and liabilities
. 
It is monitored by means of a forward
-looking analysis of the ECB™s 
profitability, which indicates that the ECB is expected to continue to earn net interest 

income in the coming years
, 
despite the increasing share of monetary policy assets 
with low yields and long maturities on its 
Balance 
Sheet. 
This type of risk
 is managed
 through
 asset allocation policies and 
is further mitigated 
by 
the existence of unremunerated liabilities on the ECB™s 
Balance 
Sheet. 
4.2
 Operational risk
 The 
ECB™s 
operational risk
13 management (ORM) covers all 
non-financial risks
. 
The Executive Board is responsible for and approves the ECB™s ORM policy and 
framework. The Operational Risk Committee (ORC) supports the Executive Board in 

the performance of its role in overseeing the management of operational risks. 
ORM 
is an integral part of the 
ECB™s 
governance structure
14 and management 
processes.
 The main objective of the ECB™s ORM framework is to 
contribute to ensuring that 
the ECB achieves its mission and objectives, while protecting its reputation 
and assets against loss, misuse and damage.
 Under the ORM framework, each 
business area is responsible for identifying, assessing, responding to, reporting on 

and monitoring its operational risks, incidents and controls. In this context, the ECB™s 

risk tolerance policy provides guidance with regard to risk response strategies and 
risk acceptance procedures. It is linked to a five
-by-five risk matrix based on impact 
and likelihood grading scales applying quantitative and qualitative criteria.
 The ECB operates in an increasingly complex threat landscape
 and there are a 
wide range of operational risks associated with its day
-to
-day activities. The main 
areas of concern for the ECB include: information security risks (e.g. cyber threats), 
IT

 A 27 Accounting policies
15 Form and presentation of the financial statements
 The financial statements of the ECB have been drawn up in accordance with the 
following accounting policies,
16 which the Governing Council of the ECB considers to 
achieve a fair presentation of the financial statements, reflecting at the same time 
the 
nature 
of central bank activities
. Accounting principles
 The following accounting principles have been applied: economic reality and 

transparency, prudence, recognition of post
-balance
-sheet events, materiality, going 
concern, the accruals principle, consistency and comparability.
 Recognition of assets and liabilities
 An asset or liability is only recognised in the Balance Sheet when it is probable that 

any associated future economic benefit will flow to or from the ECB, substantially all 

of the associated risks and rewards have been transferred to the ECB, and the cost 

or value of the asset or the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably.
 Basis of accounting
 The accounts have been prepared on a historical cost basis, modified to include the 

market valuation of marketable securities (other than securities held for monetary 

policy purposes), gold and all other o
n-
balance
-sheet and off
-balance
-sheet assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency.
 Transactions in financial assets and liabilities are reflected in the accounts on the 
basis of the date on which they were settled.
 With the exception of spot transactions in securities, transactions in financial 
instruments denominated in foreign currency are recorded in off
-balance
-sheet 
accounts on the trade date. At the settlement date the off
-balance
-sheet entries are 
15  
The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in 
Decision (EU) 2016/2247 of the ECB of 
3 November
 2016 on the annual accounts of the ECB (ECB/2016/35) (OJ L
 3
47, 20.12.2016, p.
 1
), as 
amended
. In order to ensure the harmonised accounting and financial reporting of Eurosystem 
operations
 the 
Decision 
is based on 
Guideline (EU) 2016/2249 of the ECB of 3
 November
 2016 on the 
legal framework for accounting and financial reporting in the European System of Central Banks 

(ECB/2016/34) (OJ L
 347, 20.12.2016, p.
 37
). 
16  
These policies, which are reviewed and updated regularly as deemed appropriate,
 are consistent with 
the provisions of Article
 26.4 of the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised approach to the 
rules governing the accounting and financial reporting of Eurosystem operations.
 A 28 reversed and transactions are booked on
-balance
-sheet. Purchases and sales of 
foreign currency affect the net foreign currency position on the trade date, and 
realised results arising from sales are also calculated on that date. Accrued interest, 
premiums and discounts related to financial instruments denominated in foreign 

currency are calculated and recorded daily, and the foreign currency position is also 

affected daily by these accruals.
 Gold and foreign currency assets and liabilities
 Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into euro at the 

exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are 

converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the recording date. The revaluation of 
foreign exchange assets and liabilities, including on
-balance
-sheet a
nd off
-balance
-sheet instruments, is performed on a currency
-by-currency basis.
 Revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency is treated separately from the exchange rate revaluation.
 Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at the balance sheet date. No distinction 
is made between the price and currency revaluation differences for gold. Instead, a 
single gold valuation is accounted for on the basis of the price in euro per fine ounce 

of gold, which, for the
 year 
ending 31
 December
 2017, was derived from the 
exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar on 29
 December
 2017. The special drawing right (SDR) is defined in terms of a basket of currencies
 and its 
value is determined by the weighted sum of the exchange rates of five major 

currencies (the US dollar, euro, Chinese renminbi,
 Japanese yen
 and pound sterling)
. The ECB™s holdings of SDRs
 were 
converted into euro using the exchange 
rate of euro per SDR as at 
29 December
 2017. Securities 
Securities held for monetary policy purposes
 Securities currently held for monetary policy purposes are accounted for at 
amortised cost subject to impairment.
 Other securities
 Marketable securities (other than securities held for monetary policy purposes) and 
similar asset
s are valued either at the mid
-market prices or on the basis of the 
relevant yield curve prevailing on the balance sheet date, on a security
-by-security 
basis. Options embedded in securities are not separated for valuation purposes. For 

the year ending 31
 December
 2017, mid
-market prices on 29
 December
 2017 were 
A 29 used. Illiquid equity shares and any other equity instruments
 held as permanent 
investments are valued at cost subject to impairment.
 Income recognition
 Income and expenses are recognised in the period in which they are earned or 
incurred.
17 Realised gains and losses arising from the sale of foreign currency, gold 
and securities are taken to the Profit and Loss Account. Such realised gains and 
losses are calculated by reference to the average cost of the respective asset.
 Unrealised gains are not recognised as income 
and are transferred directly to a 
revaluation account.
 Unrealised losses are taken to the Profit and Loss Account if, at the year
-end, they 
exceed previous revaluation gains registered in the corresponding revaluation 
account. Such unrealised losses on any one security or currency or on gold are not 
netted against unrealised gains on other securities or currencies or gold. In the event 
of such unrealised loss on any item taken to the Profit
 and Loss Account, the 
average cost of that item is reduced to the year
-end exchange rate or market price. 
Unrealised losses on interest rate swaps that are taken to the Profit and Loss 
Account at the year
-end are amortised in subsequent years.
 Impairment 
losses are taken to the Profit and Loss Account and are not reversed in 
subsequent years unless the impairment decreases and the decrease can be related 

to an observable event that occurred after the impairment was first recorded.
 Premiums or discounts arising on securities are amortised over the securities™ 
remaining contractual life.
 Reverse transactions
 Reverse transactions are operations whereby the ECB buys or sells assets under a 

repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral
. 
Under a repurchase agreement, securities are sold for cash with a simultaneous 
agreement to repurchase them from the counterparty at an agreed price on a set 
future date. Repurchase agreements are recorded as collateralised deposits on the 

liability side
 of the Balance Sheet. Securities sold under such an agreement remain 
on the Balance Sheet of the ECB.
 Under a reverse repurchase agreement, securities are bought for cash with a 

simultaneous agreement to sell them back to the counterparty at an agreed price on 

a set future date. Reverse repurchase agreements are recorded as collateralised 
17  
A minimum threshold of •100,000 applies for administrative accruals and provisions.
 A 30 loans on the asset side of the Balance Sheet
, but are not included in the ECB™s 
security holdings.
 Reverse transactions (including securities lending transactions) conducted under a 
programme offered by a specialised institution are recorded on the Balance Sheet 
only where collateral has been provided in the form of cash and this cash remains 
uninvested.
 Off
-balance
-sheet instruments
 Currency instruments, namely foreign ex
change forward transactions, forward legs 
of foreign exchange swaps and other currency instruments involving an exchange of 
one currency for another at a future date, are included in the net foreign currency 
position for the purpose of calculating foreign exchange gains and losses.
 Interest rate instruments are revalued on an item
-by-item basis. Daily changes in the 
variation margin of open interest rate futures contracts, as well as interest rate swaps 
that are cleared via a central counterparty, are recorded in the Profit and Loss 

Account. The valuation of forward transactions in securities and of interest rate 
swaps that are not cleared via a central counterparty is carried out by the ECB based 
on generally accepted valuation methods using observable market prices and rates, 
as well as discount factors from the settlement dates to the valuation date.
 Post
-balance
-sheet events
 The values of assets and liabilities are adjusted for events that occur between the 
annual balance sheet date and the date on which the Executive Board authorises the 
submission of the ECB™s Annual Accounts to the Governing Council for approval, if 

such events materially affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the balance 

sheet date.
 Important post
-balance
-sheet events that do not affect the condition of assets and 
liabilities at the balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes.
 Intra
-ESCB balances/intra
-Eurosystem balances
 Intra
-ESCB balances result primarily from cross
-border payments in the EU that are 
settled in central bank money in euro. These transactions are for the most part 
initiated by private entities (i.e. credit institutions, corporations and individuals). They 
are settled in TARGET2
 Œ 
the Trans
-European Automated Real
-time Gross 
settlement Express Transfer syste
m Œ 
and give rise to bilateral balances in the 
TARGET2 accounts of EU central banks. These bilateral balances are netted and 
then assigned to the ECB on a daily basis, leaving each national central bank (
NCB) 
with a single net bilateral position vis
-à-
vis 
the ECB only. Payments conducted by the 
ECB and settled in TARGET2 also 
affect 
the single net bilateral positions. 
These 
A 31 position
s 
in the books of the ECB represent the net claim or liability of each NCB 
against the rest of the European System of Central Banks (
ESCB
). Intra
-Eurosystem 
balances of euro area NCBs vis
-à-
vis the ECB arising from TARGET2, as well as 
other intra
-Eurosystem balances denominated in euro (e.g. interim profit distributions 
to NCBs), are presented on the Balance Sheet of the ECB as a single net asset or 
liability position and disclosed under ﬁOther claims within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ or 
ﬁOther liabilities within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ. Intra
-ESCB balances of non
-euro area 
NCBs vis
-à-
vis the ECB, arising from their participation in TARGE
T2,
18 are disclosed 
under ﬁLiabilities to non
-euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ.
 Intra
-Eurosystem balances arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystem are included as a single net asset under ﬁClaims related to the allocation 

of euro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes 

on accounting policies).
 Intra
-Eurosystem balances arising from the transfer of foreign reserve assets to the 
ECB by NCBs joining the Eurosystem are denominated in euro and reported under 
ﬁLiabilities equivalent to the transfer of foreign reservesﬂ.
 Treatment of fixed assets
 Fixed assets, including intangible assets, but with the exception of land and works of 
art, are valued at cost less depreciation. Land and works of art are valued at cost. 
The ECB™s main building is valued at cost less depreciation subject to impairment. 

For the depreciation of the ECB™s main building, costs are assigned to the 
appropriate asset components which are depreciated in accordance with their 
estimated useful lives. Depreciation is calculated on a straight
-line basis over the 
expected useful life of the assets, beginning in the quarter after the asset is available 

for use. The useful lives applied for the main asset classes are as follows:
 Buil
dings
 20, 25 or 50 years
 Plant in building
 10 or 15 years
 Technical equipment
 4, 10 or 15 years
 Computers, related hardware and software, and motor vehicles
 4 years
 Furniture
 10 years
 The depreciation period for capitalised refurbishment expenditure relating to the 
ECB™s existing rented premises is adjusted to take account of any events that have 
an impact on the expected useful life of the affected asset.
 Since
 2017 the ECB has performed
 an annual impairment test of its main building 
based on International Accounting Standard (IAS) 36 ﬁImpairment of assetsﬂ. If an 

impairment indicator is identified signalling that the main building may be impaired, 
18  
As 
at 31
 December
 2017
 the non
-euro area NCBs participating in TARGET2 were 


(Bulgarian National Bank), Danmarks Nationalbank, Hrvatska narodna banka
, 
Narodowy Bank 
Polski 

 A 32 the recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recorded in the Profit 
and Loss Account if the recoverable amount is less than the net book value.
 Fixed assets costing less than •10,000 are written off in the year of acquisition.
 Fixed assets that comply with the capitalisation criteria
, but are still under 
construction or development
, 
are recorded under the heading ﬁAssets under 
constructionﬂ. The related costs are transferred to the relevant fixed asset headings 
once the assets are available for use.
 The ECB™s post
-employment benefits
, 
other long
-term 
benefits
 and termination benefits
 The ECB operates defined benefit plans for its staff and the members of the 
Executive Board, as well as for the members of the Supervisory Board employed by 
the ECB.
 The staff pension plan is funded by assets held in a long
-term employee benefit 
fund. The compulsory 
contributions made by the ECB and the staff are reflected in 
the defined benefit pillar of the plan. Staff can make additional contributions on a 
voluntary basis in a defined contribution pillar that can be used to provide additional 

benefits.
19 These additional benefits are determined by the amount of voluntary 
contributions together with the investment returns arising from th
ose contributions.
 Unfunded arrangements are in place for the post
-employment and other long
-term 
benefits of members of the Executive Board and members of the Supervisory Board 

employed by
 the ECB. For staff, unfunded arrangements are in place for post
-employment benefits other than pensions and for other long
-term benefits
 and termination benefits
. 
Net defined benefit liabilit
y The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet under ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ in respect of the 

defined benefit plans
, 
including other long
-term benefits and termination benefits
, 
is 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the 

fair value of plan assets used to fund the 
related obligation.
 The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using 

the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation 

is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using a rate which is 
determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high
-quality 
euro
-denominated corporate bonds that have similar terms of maturity to the 
related 
obligation.
 19  
The funds accumulated by a staff member through voluntary contributions can be used at retirement to 
purchase an additional pension. This pension is included in the defined benefit obligation from that 

point on.
 A 33 Actuarial gains and losses can arise from experience adjustments (where actual 
outcomes are different from the actuarial assumptions previously made) and 

changes in actuarial assump
tions.
 Net defined benefit cost
 The net defined benefit cost is split into components reported in the Profit and Loss 
Account and remeasurements in respect of post
-employment benefits shown in the 
Balance Sheet under ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ.
 The net amount charged to the Profit and Loss Account comprises:
 (a)
the current service cost of the defined benefits accruing for the year;
(b)
the past service cost of the defined benefits resulting from a pl
anamendment;
(c)
net interest at the discount rate on the net defined be
nefit liability;
(d)
remeasurements in respect of other long
-term benefits
 and terminati
onbenefits of a long
-term nature, if any, in their entirety.
The net amount shown under ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ comprises the following items:
 (a)
actuarial gains and losses on
 the defined benefit obligation;
(b)
the actual return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in the net
interest on the net defined benefit liability;
(c)
any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included i
nthe net interest on the net
 defined benefit liability.
These amounts are valued annually by independent actuaries to establish the 
appropriate liability in the financial statements.
 Banknotes in circulation
 The ECB and the euro area NCBs, which together comprise the Eurosystem, issu
e euro banknotes.
20 The total value of euro banknotes in circulation is allocated to the 
Eurosystem central banks on the last working day of each month in accordance with 
the banknote allocation key.
21 The ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of the total value of euro banknotes in 
circulation, which is disclosed in the Balance Sheet under the liability item

incl
uded in the Profit and Loss Account under the item ﬁInterest income arising from 
the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ.
 Interim profit distribution
 An amount that is equal to the sum of the ECB™s income on euro banknotes in 
circulation and income arising from the securities held for monetary policy purposes 

purchased under (a)
 the Securities Markets Programme; (b)
 the third covered bond 
purchase programme; (c)
 the asset
-backed securities purchase programme; and 
(d)
the public sector purchase programme is 
distributed 
in January of the followi

23 It is distributed in full unless it is higher than the ECB™s net
profit for the year and subject to
 any decisions by the Governing Council to mak
etransfers to the provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gol
dprice risks. The Governing Council may also decide to reduce the amount of 
theincome on euro banknotes in circulation to be distributed in January
 by the amount
of the costs incurred by the ECB in connection with the issue and handling of eur

A 35 Notes on the Balance Sheet 
1 Gold and gold receivables
 As at 3
1 
December
 2017 
the ECB held 16,229,522 ounces
24 of fine gold. No 
transactions in gold took place in 201
7 
and the ECB™s holdings therefore remained 
unchanged compared with their level as at 31
 December
 2016. The 
decrease in the 
euro equivalent value of these holdings was owing to a decline in the market price of 
gold in euro terms
 (see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes 
on accounting policies and 
note
 14, ﬁRevaluation 
accountsﬂ).
 2 Claims on non
-euro area and euro area residents 
denominated in foreign currency
 2.1
 Receivables from the IMF
 This asset represents the ECB™s holdings of SDRs as at 3
1 
December
 2017. It arises 
as the result of a two
-way SDR buying and selling arrangement with the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), whereby the IMF is authorised to arrange sales or purchases 

of SDRs against euro, on behalf of the ECB, within minimum and maximum holding 
levels. For accounting purposes, SDRs are treated as a foreign currency (see ﬁGold 
and foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).
 The 
decrease in the euro equivalent value of the ECB™s holdings of SDRs was due to the 

depreciation of the SDR against the euro during 2017.
 2.2
 Balances with banks and security investments, external loans and 
other external assets; and claims on euro area residents 
denominated in foreign currency
 These two items consist of balances with banks and loans denominated in foreign 
currency, and investments in securities denominated in US dollars
, Japanese yen
 and Chinese renminbi
. 24  
This corresponds to 50
4.8
 tonnes.

 changing the composition of the ECB™s foreign 
reserves. The ECB sold
 a small portion of 
its 
US dollar holdings
 and reinvested the 
full amount in Chinese renminbi

A 37 4 Securities of euro area residents denominated in euro
 4.1
 Securities held for monetary policy purposes
 As at 3
1 
December
 2017 
this item consisted of securities acquired by the ECB within 
the scope of the three covered bond purchase programmes
 (CBPP
s)
, the Securities 
Markets Programme (SMP), the asset
-backed securities purchase programme 
(ABSPP) and the public sector purchase pro
gramme (PSPP).
27 Purchases under the first 
CBPP
 were completed on 30
 June
 2010, while the second 
CBPP
 ended on 31
 October
 2012. The 
Governing Council decided to cease further 
SMP 
purchases 
on 6
 September
 2012. In 201
7 
the Eurosystem continued its securities purchases under the asset purchase 
programme (APP)
, 
which consists of the third CBPP, the ABSPP, the PSPP and the 
corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP).
28 The monthly pace of 
combined 
net 
APP purchases
 by the NCBs and the ECB
 was •80
 billion on average 
until
 March
 2017, and 
•60 billion
 from April
 2017 until the end of the year. Based on the 
Governing Council decision in October
 2017,29 these purchases are intended to 
continue at a monthly pace of 
•30 billion 
from January to
 September
 2018, 
or 
beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained 
adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with its inflation aim. The net 
purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments
 from 
maturing securities purchased under the APP.
 The securities purchased under all of these programmes are valued on an amortised 
cost basis subject to impairment (see ﬁSecuritiesﬂ in the notes on accounting 
policies).
 The amortised cost of the securities held by the ECB, as well as their market value
30 (which is not recorded on the Balance Sheet 
and is provided for comparison 
purposes only), are as follows:
 27  
The ECB does not 
acquire
 securities under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP).

Further details on the APP can be found on the 
ECB™s website

See the ECB™s press release
 of 
26 October

Market values are indicative and 
are
 derived on 
the basis of 
market quotes. When market quotes 
are
 not available, market prices 
are
 estimated using internal Eurosystem models.
 A 38 The decrease in the amortised cost of the portfolios held under the first and second 
CBPPs 
and the SMP was due to redemptions.
 The Governing Council assesses on a regular basis the financial risks associated 
with the securities held under all these programmes.
 Impairment tests are conducted on an annual basis, using data as at the year
-end, 
and are approved by the Governing Council. In these tests, impairment indi
cators 
are assessed separately for each programme. In cases where impairment indicators 
were observed, further analysis has been performed to confirm that the cash flows of 

the underlying securities have not been affected by an impairment event. Based on 
the results of this year™s impairment tests, no losses have been recorded by the ECB 
for the securities held in its monetary policy portfolios in 2017.
 5 Intra
-Eurosystem claims
 5.1
 Claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystem
 This ite
m consists of the claims of the ECB vis
-à-
vis the euro area NCBs relating to 
the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem (see ﬁBanknotes in

calculated daily at the latest available marginal interest rate used by the Eurosystem 
in its tenders for main refinancing operations
31 (see note
 22.2
, ﬁInterest income 
arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ).
 31  
Since 16

 19, ﬁForeign exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). These valuation 
changes 
amount to 
•450.3
 million (201

837.4
 million
) and are the result of the 
conversion of such transactions into their euro equivalents at the exchange rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date, compared with the euro values resulting from 
the conversion of the transactions at the average cost of the respective foreign 
currency on that date (see ﬁOff

 7 Banknotes in circulation
 This item consists of the ECB™s share (8%) of total euro banknotes in circulation (see 
ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).
 8 Other liabilities to euro area
 credit institutions 
denominated in euro
 The 
Eurosystem central banks have the possibility of accepting cash as collateral in 
their PSPP securities lending facilities without having to reinvest it. In the case of 
the 
ECB, these operations are conducted via
 a specialised institution.
 As at 3

the outstanding value of such PSPP securities lending 
transactions 
conducted with euro area credit institutions 
was 
•1.1
 billion 
(2016:
 •1.9
 billion
). Cash received as collateral was transferred to TARGET2
 accounts. As the cash remained uninvested at the year
-end, these transactions were 
recorded on the Balance Sheet (see ﬁReverse transactionsﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).

 Other liabilit
ies
 This item amounts to

) and comprises 
deposits 
or payments of funds accepted by the ECB and made by or on behalf of the 
participants
 in EURO1 and RT1
33, which are used as a guarantee fund for EURO1
 or 
to support 
settlement
 in RT1
. 32  Securit

 A 42 10
 Liabilities to non
-euro area residents denominated in 
euro
 As at 3
1 
Dec
ember
 2017, the largest component
 was 
a liability amounting to
 •10.1
 billion (201
6: •
4.1
 billion) arising from the standing reciprocal currency 
arrangement with the Federal Reserve
 Bank of New York. Under this arrangement, 
US dollars are provided by the Federal Reserve to the ECB by means of swap 
transactions, with the aim of offering short
-term US dollar funding to Eurosystem 
counterparties. The ECB simultaneously enters into back
-to
-back swap transactions 
with euro area NCBs, which use the resulting funds to conduct US dollar liquidity
-providing operations with Eurosystem counterparties in the form of reverse 

transactions. The back
-to
-back swap transactions result in 
intra
-Eurosystem 
balances between the ECB and the NCBs (see 
note
 11.2
, ﬁOther liabilities within the 
Eurosystem (net)ﬂ). Furthermore, the swap transactions conducted with the Federal 

Reserve and the euro area NCBs result in forward claims and liabilities that are 
recorded in off
-balance
-sheet accounts (see 
note
 19, ﬁForeign exchange swap and 
forward transactionsﬂ).
 This item also 
include
s 
an amount of •
6.1
 billion (201
6: •
9.5
 billion), consisting of 
balances held with the ECB by non
-euro area central banks that arise from, or are 
the counterpart of, transactions processed via the TARGET2 system. The 
decrease 
in these balances in 201
7 
was due to payments from 
non-euro area residents to 
euro area residents
. The remainder of this item consist
s 
of an amount of •
3.4
 billion (201
6: •
3.1
 billion
) arising from outstanding PSPP securities lending transactions conducted with non
-euro area residents in which cash was received as collateral and transferred to 
TARGET2 accounts 
(see note
 8, ﬁOther liabilities to euro area credit institutions 
denominated in euroﬂ).

 The remuneration of these liabilities is calculated daily at the latest available 
marginal interest rate used by the Eurosystem in its tenders for main refinancing 

operations, adjusted to reflect a zero return on the gold component (see 
note

ﬁRemuner
ation of NCBs™ claims in respect of foreign reserves transferredﬂ).
 11.2
 Other liabilities within the Eurosystem (net)
 In 201
7 
this item consisted mainly of the TARGET2 balances of euro area NCBs vis
-à-
vis the ECB (see ﬁIntra
-ESCB balances/intra
-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies). The increase in this position resulted mainly from 
net purchases 
of securities under the APP (see 
note
 4, ﬁSecurities of euro area residents 
denominated in euroﬂ), which were settled via TARGET2 accounts
. The imp
act of the 
net purchases was partially offset by 
the 
increase in the amounts related to the back
-to
-back swap transactions conducted with NCBs in connection with US dollar 
liquidity
-providing operations
. The remuneration of TARGET2 positions, with the exception of balances arising from 
back
-to
-back swap transactions in connection with US dollar liquidity
-providing 
operations, is calculated daily at the latest available marginal interest rate used by 
the Eurosystem in its tenders for main refinancing operati
ons.
 This item also include

the amount due to euro area NCBs in respect of the ECB™s 
interim profit distribution (see ﬁInterim profit distributionﬂ in the notes on accounting

 This item is composed mainly of valuation changes in swap and forward transactions 
in foreign currency that were outstanding on 3

 2017 
(see note

ﬁForeign exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). These valuation changes are 

the result of the conversion of such transactions into their euro equivalents at the 

exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, compared with the euro values 
resulting from the conversion of the transactions at the average cost of the 
respective foreign currency on that date (see ﬁOff

increased in 201

to •
155.1
 million (
2016: •106.

), 
mainly owing 
to the introduction of the temporary Career Transition 
Support
 (CTS)
 scheme
 in 2017
 addressed to long
-serving staff members to facilitate the
ir voluntary 
transition to a career outside the ECB under specified conditions. The impact on staff 
costs was partially offset by the release of 
a dedicated provision amounting to 
•9.0
 million
 that was set

 for this purpose
. 
The past service cost in 2017 is due to the introduction of the

which is a defined benefit plan 
designed 
to cover 
non-medical assistance. The past 
service cost relates to the current pensioners who are entitled to receive benefits 
from the new plan with immediate effect.

 Key assumptions
 In preparing the valuations referred to in this note, the actuaries have used 
assumptions which the Executive Board has accepted for the purposes of 
accounting and disclosure. The principal assumptions used for the purposes of 

calculating the liability 
for
 post
-employment benefits and other long
-term benefits 
are 
as follows:
 2017  
% 
2016

 Future pension increases
 38 1.30

 Furthermore,
 voluntary contributions made by staff in a defined contribution pillar 
in 2017 
amounted to •
149.9 
million (
2016: •1
33.2 
million
). These contributions are 
invested in the plan assets 
and 
give rise to a corresponding obligation of equal 
value.
 13
 Provisions 
This item consists mainly of a provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit 
and gold price risks.
 The provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks will 
be used to the extent deemed necessary by the Governing Council to offset future 
realised and unrealised losses. The size of and continuing requirement for this 

provis
ion is reviewed annually, based on the ECB™s assessment of its exposure to 
these risks and taking a range of factors into account. Its size, together with any 
36  
These assumptions were used for calculating the part of the ECB™s defined benefit obligation which is 
funded by assets with an underlying capital guarantee.
 37  
In addition, allowance is made for prospective individual salary increases of up to 1.8% per annum, 

depending on the age of the plan participants.
 38  
In a
ccord
ance
 with
 the ECB™s pension plan rules, pensions will be increased annually. If general salary 
adjustments for ECB employees 
are
 below price inflation, any increase in pensions will be in line with the 
general salary adjustments. If the general salary adjustments e
xceed price inflation, they will be applied 
to determine the increase in pensions, provided that the financial position of the ECB™s pension plans 

permits such an increase.
 A 49 amount held in the general reserve fund, may not exceed the value of the ECB™s 
capital paid up by
 the euro area NCBs.
 As at 3
1 
Dec
ember
 2017 
the provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit 
and gold risks amounted to •7,619,884,851, unchanged from 201
6. This amount 
corresponds to the value of the ECB™s capital paid up by the euro area NCBs as at 
that date.

 Revaluation accounts
 This item consists mainly of revaluation balances arising from unrealised gains on 
assets, liabilities and off
-balance
-sheet instruments (see ﬁIncome recognitionﬂ, ﬁGold 
and foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ,
 ﬁSecuritiesﬂ and ﬁOff
-balance

instrumentsﬂ in the notes on accounting policies). It also includes the 

remeasurements of the ECB™s net defined benefit liability in respect of post

 and termination benefitsﬂ in the notes on accounting policies and

 Securities lending programmes
 As part of the management of the ECB™s own funds, the ECB has a securities 
lending programme agreement in place under which a specialised institution enters 
into securities lending transactions on behalf of the ECB.
 In addition, in accordance with the Governing Council™s decisions, the ECB has 
made available for lending its holdings of securities purchased under the first, 
second and third 
CBPP
s, as well as its holdings of securities purchased under the 
PSPP and those purchased under the SMP that are also eligible for purchase under 

the PSPP.
41 Unless 
the
se securities lending operations are conducted against 
cash collateral
 that 
remains uninvested at the end of the year, they
 are recorded in off
-balance
-sheet 
accounts.
42 Such securities lending operations with
 a value of •1
3.4 
billion (201

 Contingent liabilities from pending lawsuits
 Four lawsuits have been filed against the ECB and other EU institutions by a number 
of depositors, shareholders and bondholders of Cypriot credit instituti
ons. The 
applicants allege that they ha
ve suffered financial losses as a result of acts that they 
deem to have led to the restructuring of these credit institutions in the context of the 

financial assistance programme for Cyprus. The General Court of the EU found 
twelve similar cases inadmissible in their entirety in 2014. Appeals were brought 
against eight of these verdicts and in 2016 the Court of Justice of the European 
A 54 Union either confirmed the inadmissibility of the cases or ruled in favour of the ECB
 in these appeals. The ECB™s involvement in the process leading up to the conclusion 
of the financial assistance programme was limited to the provision of technical 
advice, pursuant to the 
ESM 
Treaty, acting in liaison with the European Commission, 
as well
 as the issuance of a non
-binding opinion on the Cypriot draft resolution law. It 
is therefore considered that no losses will be incurred by the ECB as a result of 
these cases.

The overall increase in net interest income in 201
7 
was due mainly to higher interest 
income generated on the US dollar portfolio.
 22.2
 Interest income arising from the allocation of euro banknotes withi
n the Eurosystem
 This item consists of the interest income relating to the ECB™s 8% share of the total 

euro banknote issue (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies and 
note
 5.1
, ﬁClaims related to the allocation of euro banknotes
 within the 
Eurosystemﬂ). 
For
 201
7 this interest income was zero,
 owing to the fact that the rate 
on the main refinancing operations remained at 0% during the entire year
. 
22.3
 Remuneration of NCBs™ claims in respect of foreign reserves 
transferred
 Remuneration paid to euro area NCBs on their claims in respect of the foreign 
reserve assets transferred to the ECB (see 
note
 11.1
, ﬁLiabilities equivalent to the 
transfer of foreign reservesﬂ) is disclosed under this heading. The remuneration in 
2017 
was 
zero
, reflecting
 the fact that the rate on the main refinancing operations 
was 
0% during the entire year
. A 56 22.4
 Other interest income; and other interest expense
 In 201
7 
these items comprised mainly net interest income of •
1.1

 securities 
held
 by the ECB for monetary policy purposes. 
Of this amount, •0.

bonds.
 The remainder of these items consisted mainly of interest income and expense on 
the ECB™s own funds portfolio (see

 224,541,742
 (63,472,699)
 Net realised price
 gains include realised gains and losses on securities, interest rate 
futures and interest rate swaps. The decrease in net realised price gains in 201
7 
was 
due mainly 
to lower realised price gains generated on securities in the US dollar
 portfolio.
 The overall increase in net realised exchange rate and gold price gains was due 
mainly to the sale of a small portion of US dollars holdings in order to fund the 
creation of the Chinese renminbi
 portfolio

 2.2
, ﬁBalances with banks and 
security investments, external loans and other external assets; and claims on euro

 The market value of a number of securities held in the US dollar portfolio further 
declined in 2017
, alongside
 an increase in the 
corresponding yields
. This resulted 
in 
unrealised price losses 
during the 
year
. 
The unrealised exchange rate losses are mainly due to the write
-down of the 
average acquisition cost of the ECB™s holding of 
Chinese
 renminbi to its 2017 year

the purchases were made

s related to supervisory tasks
 On November
 2014 the ECB assumed its supervisory tasks in accordance with 
Article
 33 of the SSM 
Regulation
.45 In order to recover expenditure incurred for 
performing these tasks the ECB levies annual fees on supervised entitie
s. The ECB 

announced in April
 2017 
that the annual supervisory fees in 201
7 would amount to 
•425.0
 million.

figure 
was based on estimated annual 
expenses

supervisory tasks

and (ii)

. 
Based on the actual 
expenses
 incurred by the ECB in its performance of 
banking 
supervisory tasks, the supervisory
 fee income for 201
7 
stood at •
436.7
 million.
 The 
net 
surplus of •
27.9
 million arising from the difference between the estimated 
expenses 
(•464.7
 million) and the actual 
expenses 
(•436.7
 million)
 for 201
7 
is 
shown under the heading ﬁAccruals and income collected in advanceﬂ (see 
note
 12.2, ﬁAccruals and income collected in advanceﬂ). It will be offset against 
the 
supervisory fees to be levied in 201
8. 
The 
ECB is 
also 
entitled to impose administrative penalties on supervised entities 
for 
failure to comply wi
th 
the EU banking regulation
s 
on prudential requirements 
(including ECB supervisory decisions).
48 The related income is not considered in the 
calculation of the annual supervisory fees. Instead
, it is recorded as income in the 
ECB™s 
Profit and 
Loss 
Account 
and is distributed to euro
 area NCBs as part of the 
ECB™s profit distribution regime. In 2017 penalties imposed by the ECB on 
supervised entities amounted to •15.3
 million.
 Thus

 Banking supervision
-related
 expenses
 result from the direct supervision of significant 
entities, the oversight of the supervision of less significant entities and the 
performance of horizontal tasks and specialised services. 
They
 also include 
expenses
 arising from support areas, including pr
emises, human resources 
management, administrative services, budgeting and controlling, accounting, legal, 

internal audit, statistical and information technology services needed to fulfil the 

ECB™s supervisory responsibilities.
 In addition, the collection 
of 
an amount of •11.2
 million related to administrative 
penalties imposed by the ECB on a supervised entity was considered uncertain
, as 
47  
Based on Article
 7 of 
Regulation (EU) No
 1163/2014 of 
the ECB of 22
 October 2014 on supervisory 
fees (ECB/2014/41)
 (OJ
 L 
311, 31.10.2014, p.
 23
), in cases where (i)
 a supervised entity or a 
supervised group is supervised for only part of the fee period or (ii)
 the status of a supervised entity or 
a supervised group changes from significant to less si
gnificant, or vice versa,
 the individual supervisory 
fee
s 
are amended. Any such amounts 
received or refunded are taken into account for the calculation of 
the total annual supervisory fees to be levied in subsequent years.

Further details on the adminis
trative penalties imposed by the ECB can be found

Supervision website

Consequently, totals in the tables of this 
note may not add up due to rounding.
 A 59 the banking licen
ce of this entity has been subsequently withdrawn and it is currently 
in liquidation. 
In accordance wi
th 
the prudence principle
, an allowance for the full 
amount of this claim was created at 
the year
-end (see 
note
 31, ﬁOther expensesﬂ). 
The related expense is not considered in the calculation of the annual supervisory 
fees
, but it is recorded in the 
Profit and 
Loss 
Account of the ECB and reduces its net 
result.
 For 201

The 
rise
 in the total number of staff working in ECB Banking Supervision
 and an increase in 
costs for 
external consultative support, primarily in connection with 
the 
Targeted
 Review of Internal Models (TRIM), contributed
 to the 
growth
 in actual

rests
 Dividends received on shares which the ECB holds in the BIS (see 
note

 Other income
 Other miscellaneous income during 2017 mainly arose from the accrued 

contributions of the euro area NCBs to the costs incurred by the ECB in connection 
with joint Eurosystem projects.
 28
 Staff costs
 The higher average number of staff employed by the ECB in 201
7 and the expenses 
in relation to termination benefits arising under the 
CTS 
scheme introduced by the 
ECB
 in 2017 (see note
 12.3
, ﬁSundryﬂ) 
led to an overall increase in staff costs.
 Salaries, allowances, staff insurance and other miscellaneous costs of •
366.0 
million 
(2016: •349.5
 million
) are included under this heading. The item also includes 
an amount of 
•169.2
 million (
2016: •117.0
 million
) recognised in connection with the 
A 60 ECB™s post
-employment benefits
, 
other long
-term benefits and termination 
benefits 
(see note
 12.3, ﬁSundryﬂ).
 Salaries and allowances
 are modelled in essence on, and are comparable with, the 
remuneration scheme of the European Union.
 Members of the Executive Board and the members of the Supervisory Board 
employed by the ECB receive a basic salary, while part
-time members of the 
Supervisory Board employed by the ECB 
may 
receive additional
 remuneration based 
on the number of meetings attended. Furthermore, the members of the Executive 

Board and the full
-time members of the Supervisory Board employed by the ECB 
receive additional allowances for residence and representation. In the case of th
e President, an official residence owned by the ECB is provided in lieu of a residence 
allowance. Subject to the Conditions of Employment for Staff of the European 

Central Bank, members of both boards 
may be
 entitled to household, child and 
education allowances, depending on their individual circumstances. Salaries are 

subject to a tax for the benefit of the European Union, as well as to deductions in 

respect of contributions to the pension, medical and accident insurance schemes. 

Allowances are non
-taxable
 and non
-pensionable.
 In 201

the basic salaries of the members of the Executive Board and members of 

the Supervisory Board employed by the ECB (i.e. excluding representatives of 
national supervisors) were as follows:

The salaries of the President and the Vice President published last year included the annual 
general 
salary a

The increase compared with 2016 was mainly the result of a new 
member joining the Supervisory Board in February
 2017. Pension payments, including
 post
-employment
 allowances, 
and contributions to the 
medical and accident insurance schemes 
for
 former board members

other services and supplies, together with staff
-related expenses
, including 
recruitment, relocation 
and training expenses.

 Banknote production services
 This expense arises predominantly owing to the cross
-border transportation of euro 
banknotes between banknote printing works and NCBs, for the delivery of new 
banknotes, 
and between NCBs, for the compensation of shortages with surplus 
stocks. These costs are borne centrally by the ECB.

first operation following the date indicated. The change on 18 September 2001 was effective on that same day. From 10 March 2004 the date refers both to the deposit and

marginal lending facilities, and to the main refinancing operations (with changes effective from the first main refinancing operation following the Governing Council decision),

unless otherwise indicated.2) On 22 December 1998 the ECB announced that, as an exceptional measure between 4 and 21 January 1999, a narrow corridor of 50 basis points would be applied between the
interest rates for the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility, aimed at facilitating the transition to the new monetary regime by market participants.
3) On 8 June 2000 the ECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem would be conducted as
variable rate tenders. The minimum bid rate refers to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids.4) As of 9 October 2008 the ECB reduced the standing facilities corridor from 200 basis points to 100 basis points around the interest rate on the main refinancing operations. The
standing facilities corridor was restored to 200 basis points as of 21 January 2009.5) On 8 October 2008 the ECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 15 October, the weekly main refinancing operations would be carried out through a
fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment at the interest rate on the main refinancing operations. This change overrode the previous decision (made on the same day) to cut

by 50 basis points the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations conducted as variable rate tenders.1 Financial and monetary developmentsS 3 ECB Annual Report 2017 - Statistical section1.2 Eurosystem monetary policy operations allotted through tender procedures 1) (EUR millions; interest rates in percentages per annum)1.2.1 Main and longer-term refinancing operations 2), 3)  Main refinancing operations    Date ofBidsNumber ofAllotmentFixed rate tender   Variable rate tenderRunning for

Source: ECB.1) Only the 10 last operations until the end of 2017 are displayed in each category.
2) With effect from April 2002, split tender operations (i.e. operations with a one-week maturity conducted as standard tender procedures in parallel with a main refinancing
operation) are classified as main refinancing operations.3) On 8 June 2000 the ECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem would be
conducted as variable rate tender procedures. The minimum bid rate refers to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids. On 8 October 2008 the

ECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 15 October 2008, the weekly main refinancing operations would be carried out through a fixed rate tender

procedure with full allotment at the interest rate on the main refinancing operations.  On 4 March 2010 the ECB decided to return to variable rate tender procedures in the

regular three-month longer-term refinancing operations, starting with the operation to be allotted on 28 April 2010 and settled on 29 April 2010.
4) In liquidity-providing (absorbing) operations, the marginal rate refers to the lowest (highest) rate at which bids were accepted.

5) For the operations settled on 22 December 2011 and 1 March 2012, after one year counterparties have the option to repay any part of the liquidity that they have been allotted
in these operations, on any day that coincides with the settlement day of a main refinancing operation.6) Targeted longer-term refinancing operation. Further information can be found in the ````Monetary Policy'''' section of the ECB's website (https://www.ecb.europa.eu) under 
````Instruments'''' then ````Open market operations''''.
7) In this longer-term refinancing operation, the rate at which all bids are satisfied is indexed to the average minimum bid rate in the main refinancing operations over the life of the
operation. The interest rates displayed for these indexed longer-term refinancing operations have been rounded to two decimal places. For the precise calculation method,
