Growth Is Moving into a Higher GearGrowth is strengthening and broadening across 
Europe, driven by buoyant domestic demand 
(Figure
 1.1). Following a pickup in economic 
activity in the second half of 2016, the European 
economy accelerated further in the ˜rst half of 

2017, with growth outcomes surprising on the 
upside in most countries.Ł In 
advanced Europe
, growth is running about 
2 percent on average, with some economies 
seeing appreciably higher rates (Figure
 1.2, panel 1). All euro area
 countries are growing, 
and the dispersion of growth rates is the lowest 
in nearly two decades. ˚e Nordic economies
 
(Nordics)
 and other advanced European 
economies are seeing similarly strong domestic 
demand. In 
the United Kingdom
, weakness in 
the pound has led to a squeeze of real incomes 
and some slowdown in demand.
Ł In 
emerging Europe
, growth increased to about 
3 percent in the ˜rst half of 2017, up from 
1.5 percent in 2016 (Figure
 1.2, panel 2). ˚is has been helped by a rebound from recession 
in Russia
 and a strong, policy-assisted pickup 

in activity in Turkey
, following a dip related 
to the failed coup attempt. Several economies, 
especially those that are EU members, are 
seeing growth much faster than 3
 percent. 
In these economies, private consumption is 

expanding rapidly, as low unemployment and 

labor shortages have pushed up wages and 
boosted household con˜dence. Concurrently, 
investment has strengthened, partly due to 

the growing absorption of EU structural

funds from low levels in 2016. In 
Poland
 and Romania
, expansion is also fueled by 
government spending programs (for example, 
child subsidies in Poland
) or large value-added 
and excise tax cuts (in 
Romania
).Recent high frequency indicators suggest that the 
growth momentum has likely continued in the 

second half of 2017. Manufacturing Purchasing 
Managers Indices (PMIs) are strengthening further 
in advanced Europe 
and are ˜rmly in expansionary 

territory in 
emerging Europe 
(Figure
 1.3). Consumer con˜dence also gradually improved 
in 2017, with most households in both advanced
 and emerging Europe
 expressing optimism about 
their future economic prospects, suggesting 

sustained upward momentum in private spending. 

Speci˜cally, economic sentiment (a survey-based 
measure of business and consumer con˜dence) 
in the euro area
 reached its highest level in more 
than a decade, led by rising con˜dence among 
industrial companies and in the services sector.

Slack Is DisappearingIn 
advanced Europe
, output gaps are closing, while 
in emerging Europe
, the cyclical recovery appears 
largely complete (Figure
 1.4). Except for 
Greece
, in advanced Europe,
 output gaps are estimated to 
be relatively small, closed, or positive; the output 
gap in the euro area
 is expected to be closed in 
2018. In 
emerging Europe
, output gaps in many economies appear already small or closed, with 
several countries experiencing positive gaps for 

a while now (May 2017 and November
 2016 Regional Economic Issues: Central, Eastern, and 
Southeastern Europe
). However, output gap estimates are uncertain. 

Indicators of economic slack are still inconclusive. 

On the one hand, subdued in˝ation suggests 
there is ample slack; on the other hand, indicators 
such as high capacity utilization and low 
unemployment rates point to limited remaining 
slack (see below). Measuring slack is complicated, 

and estimates are frequently revised over time 
(Grigoli and others 2015). An examination 
of past recoveries suggests that the extent of 

economic slack in the year that growth resumed 
has generally been underestimated (Figure
 1.5, panel 1). Regarding revisions of slack after the 

global ˜nancial crisis, output gaps were initially 
underestimated (Figure

in the United States
 and to a lesser extent in the euro area 
(as a whole). In subsequent revisions, 
as the recovery strengthened, potential growth 
was gradually revised up. However, the current 

rebound of activity in Europe is not entirely 
comparable with past recoveries from recessions, 
so caution is warranted in drawing conclusions. 
˚e fundamental problem is that disentangling 
the cyclical and structural components of a 
growth rebound is complicated, particularly after 
prolonged periods of subdued growth. 
Recent survey indicators suggest that the current 
recovery in Europe appears also driven by 
structural factors. Higher growth partly re˝ects 
a pickup in investment that, if sustained, could 
help improve potential growth. Surveys of ˜rms in 

EU countries show an increasing number of them 
expect to face equipment shortage and capacity 
constraints in meeting demand (Figure
 1.6). ˚is 
suggests that the pickup in investment could 
continue across the region, adding to productive 
capital. In 
emerging market economies
 that are 
EU 
members, the increase in investment is also helped 
by the new cycle of EU Structural and Investment

Funds. Still-subdued wage growth in 
the euro 
area
 and other advanced economies
 also supports 
the view that slack in the economy and potential 
output could be greater, although wage growth 

is increasingly robust in a few advanced and a 
growing number of emerging market economies 
(see below). 
Accordingly, on the back of the ˜rming recovery 
in 2017, potential growth in the near term has 
been revised up in many European countries 
(Figure
 1.7, panel 1). Cyclical factors are also 

at play, particularly in countries where in˝ation 
is expected to be higher than previously 
estimated and output gaps are more positive 

(Figure
 1.7, panel 2).
Greater in˝ationary pressures are visible mainly 
in wages in economies where unemployment 
rates have returned to precrisis levels, while 
productivity growth is weak. In most 
advanced 

European economies
, wage growth has been 
subdued, re˝ecting anemic productivity growth 
and low in˝ation (Figure
 1.8). In contrast, in a few 

advanced European economies
ŒŒthe Baltics
 and the Czech Republic
ŒŒand emerging market economies 
in Southeastern Europe
, wage growth has been strong 

for some time and has outpaced labor productivity 
growth since 2016. In 
Ukraine
, nominal wage growth has averaged 35
 percent in 2017Š
re˝ecting a doubling of the minimum wage and 
very strong growth in public sector wages, which 

has triggered large increases in unit labor costs and 
poses a risk of second-round e˛ects on in˝ation.

However, in˝ation, while rising, remains generally 
subdued across Europe.
Ł In many 
advanced European economies
, in˝ation has picked up somewhat, but 
remains low (Figure
 1.9, panel 1), in line with sluggish wage growth over the past several 
years. In 
the euro area
, core in˝ation, while 
gradually increasing to 1.3
 percent in August 

from 0.9
 percent in January, remains subdued 
(Figure
 1.9, panel 2). In˝ation expectations 
have increased from a year ago, and de˝ation 

risk has receded, but expectations remain well 
below 2
 percent (Figure
 1.10). In 
the United 
Kingdom, in˝ation is running at a higher level 
owing to the pass-through of the pound™s 
depreciation following the Brexit referendum.
Ł In other 
advanced European economies
, particularly 
the Czech Republic
 and the Baltics
, in˝ation has picked up but is still relatively subdued, despite strong wage growth 
over the past several years. Most 
emerging European economies
 (notably, 
Central Europe
 
and Southeastern Europe
) have witnessed 
similar developments: somewhat higher but 
still-low in˝ation since early 2017, despite 

an acceleration in wage growth. In these 
economies, in˝ation expectations point to further increases in in˝ation.
Ł In 
Russia
, consumer price in˝ation hit a 
post-Soviet low of 3.3
 percent in August, 
below the central bank™s target of 4
 percent, 
re˝ecting a small negative output gap, 
recent appreciation of the ruble, a one-o˛ 
e˛ect of declining food prices from a strong 

harvest, and a tight monetary policy stance.

the other members of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) 
has been hovering 
around 11.5
 percent throughout 2017, driven 
by persistent double-digit in˝ation in 
Ukraine
.Ł Turkey™s
 annual in˝ation rate rose to 
10.7 percent in August 2017 from 9.2
 percent 
in January, more than double the central 
bank™s in˝ation target of 5
 percent. Prices 
of food, nonfood goods, and fuels climbed 
at double-digit rates, and core in˝ation 
reached a three-year high, driven in part by 
oversimulative macroeconomic policies.
˚e divergent wage growth trends appear to 

re˝ect di˛erences in the degree of slack in labor 
markets. While headline unemployment rates have 
trended down across Europe since early 2013, the 

decline in labor market slack in 
the Baltics, Central 
Europe
, and Southeastern Europe
 has been much larger than in most advanced European economies
 (Figure
 1.11). In particular, both unemployment 
and underemployment (which includes 

involuntary part-time workers) in 
the Baltics, 
Central Europe
, and Southeastern Europe
 are now 
at the lowest level since 2008, and business survey 

data indicate that shortages of skilled labor are

seen as beginning to constrain the expansion (see the spring 2017 Regional Economic Issues: Central, 
Eastern, and Southeastern Europe
). In contrast, 
there is still labor market slack in some 
advanced 

economies (see Chapter 2 of the October 2017 
World Economic Outlook
). Exposure to external competition and 
technological progress is shaping wage growth 

patterns at sectoral levels
 (Figure
 1.12). Exposure 
to external competitionŠparticularly in 
sectors where companies can increasingly move 

production globallyŠmay explain why, for many 
countries in advanced Europe
, wage growth trails 
signi˜cantly behind productivity growth in the 
manufacturing sector. In addition, automation 
and technological progress may also dampen wage 

and employment growth for middle-skill jobs in 
manufacturing (see OECD 2017 and IMF 2017). ˚is gap is much smaller in service sectors. In 
the 
Baltics, Central Europe,
 and Southeastern Europe
, wage growth has been noticeably stronger in 
service sectors (including professional services, 

wholesale and retail trade, and real estate) relative 
to industrial sectors, which are more exposed to 

external competition. ˚us far, many economies 
where economy-wide wage growth is running 
high, have not experienced major reductions 

in export market shares, as wage growth in the 
manufacturing sector has been relatively weaker.
1 For 
the Baltics
, Central Europe
, and Southeastern 
Europe
, higher wage growth in the service sectors 

will likely lead to higher domestic services 
in˝ation. In recent years, in˝ation in services 
has generally outpaced in˝ation in goods prices (Figure
 1.13)Ša phenomenon that is also observed globally outside Europe. Policymakers 

have shown more tolerance of higher services 
in˝ation as it is o˛set by low goods price in˝ation. 
Going forward, higher wage growth in the service 

sector could exert more pressure on headline

up some steam.2The Credit Recovery Is Catching Credit growth is picking up in many European 
countries, but continues to lag domestic demand and output. As investment continues to garner 
strength, credit growth should follow, with 

bene˜cial e˛ects for bank pro˜tability and 
balance sheets.Ł In 
advanced Europe
 and the euro area
, bank credit to the private sector is picking up 

(Figure
 1.14, panel 1), mainly driven by 
credit to households (Figure
 1.14, panel 2). Growth in credit to businesses remains uneven 

(Figure
 1.14, panel 4) and is particularly weak 
in countries with high levels of nonperforming 
loans (NPLs). In 
the Nordic economies
, credit

to businesses is robust, in line with a pickup in 
investment and exports, while credit growth 
to households has slowed somewhat following 
the recent macroprudential measures aimed 
at containing the housing boom and elevated 
household debt levels.
Ł In 
emerging Europe
, outside the CIS, credit 

growth, both to non˜nancial corporations 

and households, is increasing, particularly 
in Central Europe
 and Southeastern European 
EU member states (SEE-EU), in line with 
continuing strong real GDP and investment 
growth (Figure
 1.14, panel 3). On a 
transactional basis, credit growth may be 
higher in those countries where the cleaning 
of loan portfolios lowers credit stocks (for 
example in Albania
, Croatia
, and Hungary
). In 
Russia
, after a period of decline, credit 

is growing as the economy exits recession 

(Figure
 1.14, panel 3). In the rest of 
the CIS, credit contraction has continued, albeit 
at a slower pace. In 
Turkey
, credit initially 

slowed in 2016 in the aftermath of the failed 
coup attempt, but rebounded strongly to 
about 18 percent in July 2017, driven by

non˜nancial corporations (Figure
 1.14, panel 4). ˚is was also driven by various stimulus 
measures, notably a credit guarantee scheme 
for lending to businesses.NPL levels have declined, but are still a drag 

on pro˜tability and the credit supply in several 
countries (see Chapter 3). NPL ratios have 
declined across Europe from their postcrisis peaks 
(Figure
 1.15, panels 1 and 2). In 
advanced Europe
, NPLs in the euro area
 have been reduced by about 

•160 billion (predominantly in the household 
sector) since their peak in 2014, but the stock remains high at just below •1
 trillion (Figure
 1.15, panel 3). Spain
 and Ireland
 account for a large portion of the reduction in NPLs. In 
Italy, 
the recent pickup in NPL sales is encouraging. Legacy 
assets together with cyclical and structural factors 
are a drag on pro˜tability. For an appreciable part 

of the banking system, the return on equity is 
persistently below the cost of equity. ˚e economic 
recovery may not be enough to boost returns to 
meet investor expectations; further consolidation 
and restructuring will be needed. NPL levels have 

been declining across 
emerging market Europe
 but remain higher than 10
 percent in eight
 countries. While disentangling demand and supply e˛ects 
is di˙cult, high NPL levels in several economies 
appear to be a factor that is hindering credit 
growth (Figure
 1.15, panel 4). In this regard, 

more actions are needed to reduce legacy bad

The European Recovery Is Spilling Over to the 
Rest of the World
Europe has ˜nally become an engine for global 
trade. ˚e improved prospects for Europe 
account for the bulk of the upward revision 

to global growth in 2017 from the April 2017 
World Economic Outlook
 (Figure
 1.16). Also, the strengthening domestic-demand-driven recovery 
in Europe has boosted global trade, with Europe™s 
contribution to the growth of global merchandise 

imports in 2016Œ17 similar to that of 
China and 
the United States
 combined. ˚e improving fundamentals in Europe have 

been accompanied by appreciation of the real 

e˛ective exchange rate of the euro and some 
other European currencies. Between March and 
September 2017, the euro appreciated by about 

4 percent in real e˛ective terms (Figure
 1.17), largely due to the improved euro area growth 
prospects (Box
 1.1). Another currency that 
appreciated about 6
 percent is the Czech koruna. 
˚e appreciation of 
Turkey™s
 lira, despite a large 
current account de˜cit, follows a more than 
10 percent depreciation after the coup in the 
second half of 2016, as activity and con˜dence rebounded faster than expected. In 
Russia
, the ruble has depreciated by about 5
 percent since 

March, following a 25
 percent appreciation from 

the trough reached in early 2016 that was driven 
by stronger oil prices and tight monetary policy

to reduce in˝ation. Meanwhile, in 
the United 
Kingdom, sterling has moved broadly sideways 
since the depreciation in 2016.
Despite the acceleration in imports and 
appreciation of the euro, current account surpluses 
remain noticeably larger than before the crisis in 
most countries. Net external debtor countries that 
had persistent and large current account de˜cits 

prior to the crisis have seen appreciable current 
account adjustments (Figures 1.18, panels 1 and 
2), driven by both a permanent reduction in the 

level of demand and some labor cost reductions. 
At the same time, elevated external surpluses 
have persisted in 
Germany
, the Netherlands
, and 
Switzerland
, as well as in 
Sweden
.Ł In 
advanced Europe
, euro area members
 that earlier had de˜cits have maintained surpluses 
(Estonia, Portugal, Spain
) or reduced the 

de˜cits (Greece
, Latvia, Lithuania
) over the 
past several years (Figure
 1.18, panel 1). ˚is was partly driven by adjustments in unit labor 

costs (Figure
 1.18, panel 4). However, this has 
led only to a gradual improvement in their 
net foreign asset positions (Figure
 1.18, panel 
3), and thus surpluses need to be maintained for some time. Recent indicators of 
competitiveness, while not conclusive, suggest 
some erosion of competitiveness in
 the Baltics
, 
where real e˛ective exchange rate appreciation, 
fast wage growth, and modest productivity 
gains have led to a notable increase in unit 

labor costs, bringing them close to the precrisis peak (Figure
 1.18, panel 5). Excess 
external surpluses have persisted in 
Germany
 and the Netherlands
, indicating that automatic adjustment mechanisms are weak. ˚at is, 

prices and saving and investment decisions 
are not adjusting fast enough to correct 
the imbalances, partly re˝ecting currency 
arrangements but also likely structural features 
(IMF 2017b).Ł In 
emerging Europe
, there has been a 

signi˜cant improvement in current account 

balances since the global ˜nancial crisis, with some economies replacing large current 
account de˜cits with small surpluses, but here 
too net external liability positions remain 
elevated (Figure
 1.18, panels 2 and 3). In 

Central Europe
 and SEE-EU, real e˛ective 
exchange rates have edged up somewhat as 
wages grew faster than productivity in the 

past two years (Figure
 1.18, panel 5). ˚e level of economy-wide pro˜t shares in these 
economies is higher than the EU average 

(Figure
 1.18, panel 6), which suggests that companies have some room to absorb the 
higher labor costs. However, the impact of 
high wage growth on competitiveness needs to 
be monitored closely.
Ł In 
Turkey
, strong domestic demand pressures 

and high in˝ation have contributed to a 

larger current account de˜cit since the crisis. 
Amid easy global ˜nancial conditions, Turkey™s
 year-to-date current account de˜cit exceeded 
5 percent of GDP. In 
Russia
, the current 
account balance has been driven by oil prices 
and sanctions, although the e˛ect of the latest sanctions is believed to be modest. Given 
current oil price projections, and with the 

recovery of domestic demand, 
Russia™s
 current 
account is projected to be in a surplus of 
3Œ4 percent of GDP in the near term.

External Conditions and 
Will Support Growth
Looking ahead, external demand conditions remain favorable. ˚e global expansion continues 
to strengthen and broaden. ˚ere has been an 
upturn in manufacturing and investment, and 

stronger trade growth. Expansionary PMIs, 
especially in advanced economies, point to 
continued strong global growth in the third 
quarter of 2017 (Figure
 1.19, panel 1). New 
orders for euro area manufacturing goods, 

particularly from foreign markets, also continue 
to rise and are at levels not seen in recent years, 
which bodes well for further growth (Figure
 1.19, 
panel 2). Accordingly, the October 2017 
World 
Economic Outlook
 projects global growth to reach 
3.6 percent and 3.7
 percent in 2017 and 2018, 
respectively, up from 3.2
 percent in 2016. 
Financial conditions are very supportive of 
activity. As discussed in the October 2017 
Global 
Financial Stability Report
, the environment of 
benign macroeconomic conditions and continued 
easy monetary and ˜nancial conditions with 
sluggish in˝ation is fueling a marked increase 
in risk appetite, broadening investors™ search for 

yield. Policy rates, term premiums, and corporate 

spreads generally remain very low, while global 
stock markets have been posting strong gains for 
some time. On the back of positive economic 
news and expectations of some tapering of the 
Asset Purchasing Program of the European 

Central Bank (ECB), yields in 
advanced Europe 
have edged up since September 2016, but remain 
at low levels (Figure
 1.20, panel 1). In 
the euro 
area economies
 with limited ˜scal bu˛ers, spreads 
relative to German bunds have declined since 

mid-2017 (Figure
 1.20, panel 2). In
 emerging Europe
, both local and foreign currency yields 
have gone up somewhat in some countries 

(Figures 1.20, panels 3 and 4), and spreads have 
declined for all countries since October 2016 on 
the back of an improved global environment and 
sentiment toward emerging market economies 
(Figure
 1.20, panel 5). ˚e declining spreads 

have been underpinned by continued strength 
in capital in˝ows to emerging market economies 
(Figure
 1.20, panel 6).Industrial productionManufacturing PMI(index; 50+ = expansion, right scale)

policy is expected to tighten gradually from a 
very accommodative stance, given a relatively 
closed output gap and in˝ation close to target (Figure
 1.21, panel 1). In the rest of 
advanced 

Europe
, markets expect a tightening bias (for 
example, the Czech Republic
), but monetary 
policy is expected to remain supportive, 

re˝ected in negative real policy rates across the 
region (Figure
 1.21, panel 2).Ł Emerging Europe
 is also expected to experience generally accommodative ˜nancial conditions 

on the back of easy monetary policy and 
strong risk appetite, as signaled by lower 
sovereign bond spreads and higher equity 

prices. Market expectation is for some 
tightening in Romania
, given the closing 
output gap and rising in˝ationary pressures 

(Figure
 1.21, panel 2). In 
Turkey
, after the increase in the average funding rates in early 
2017, the market expects the rates to go 

modestly down, as in˝ationary pressures from 
the depreciation of the Turkish lira subside. 

In 
Russia
, policy rates have been lowered since 
March, following the decline in in˝ation and 
in˝ation expectations, and the market expects 

further cuts over the next few quarters, though 
expectations a year ahead are more mixed.
Fiscal policy is not projected to change appreciably 
going forward, staying broadly neutral in 
advanced 
Europe
 and neutral to expansionary in 
emerging Europe
 (Figure
 1.22). ˚e cumulative ˜scal 

impulse over 2017Œ18, de˜ned as the change in 
the structural ˜scal balance as a share of potential 
output between 2016 and 2018, is forecast to be 

slightly expansionary in some 
advanced European
 economies, including Germany
 and the Netherlands
 (Figure
 1.22, panel 1). In most 
advanced 

economies, ˜scal policy is neutral or slightly tighter (for example, Spain
, and the United Kingdom
). In

 However, structural ˜scal balances remain 
negative for most countries in the region and are, 
in case of oil-dependent Norway
 and Russia
, sizable (Figure
 1.22, panel 2).to Stay StrongWith improving external demand and 
accommodative macroeconomic policies and 
˜nancial conditions, strong growth momentum 
will likely continue in the near term (Table
 1.1):Ł In 
the euro area
, growth has been revised 
up to 2.1 percent (from 1.7
 percent in the 

April projection) for 2017 and to 1.9
 percent 
for 2018 (from 1.6
 percent in April), 
re˝ecting stronger-than-expected growth 

in the ˜rst half of this year and improved 
high frequency economic and con˜dence 

indicators. In addition to cyclical factors, the 
improved growth prospects also re˝ect higher 
estimates of potential growth on the back of 

stronger investment.
Ł ˚e near-term outlook has also improved in 
the Nordics 
and other advanced Europe
, except 
the United Kingdom and Switzerland
. Growth 

in the Nordics, the Czech Republic
, and Israel
 is revised up re˝ecting strong momentum so far. 
In contrast, growth in 
the United Kingdom
 is 
projected to slow to 1.7
 percent in

Ł In most of 
emerging Europe
, growth forecasts 
have also been revised up re˝ecting stronger 
domestic demand and ˜rming euro area 
activity. Outside 
the CIS and Turkey
, growth is 

revised up in 
the EU member countries, partly 
due to higher absorption of EU funds, but the outlook is softer in the Southeastern Europe 

non-EU countries, partly due to ongoing ˜scal 
consolidation. Economic activity in 
Russia
 is projected to expand by 1.8
 percent in 
2017 (0.4 of a percentage point up relative 
to April), helped by higher oil prices, easier 

˜nancial conditions, and improved consumer 
con˜dence. ˚e most notable revision is 
for Turkey
, where growth in 2017 has been 

revised up by 2.7
 percentage points to 
5.1 percent re˝ecting a very strong outturn 
in the ˜rst quarter of the year. However, 
growth is projected to be more subdued in the 
second part of 2017 and in 2018, as the ˜scal 

stimulus fades and monetary policy continues 
to cool demand.In˝ation is expected to remain subdued across 
most of the European economies (Table
 1.2). 
In 
advanced Europe
, in˝ation is projected to 
increase, but by less than anticipated in the 

April 2017 
World Economic Outlook
, re˝ecting 
mainly downward revisions in 
the euro area
 (by 
0.2 percentage point for 2017), as a stronger euro 

has dampened in˝ation pressure. Underlying 
in˝ation remains stubbornly low and wage growth 
subdued amid still-high unemployment in some 

countries. Headline in˝ation is projected to 
approach the ECB™s medium-term objective of 
below but close to 2
 percent gradually over the 
next few years. In˝ation in the rest of 
advanced 
Europe
 is revised up slightly, re˝ecting mainly 

an upward revision in 
the United Kingdom,
 where headline in˝ation is projected to reach 
2.6 percent this year and next, but gradually 

decline thereafter as the temporary e˛ects of the 
pound™s depreciation wane. In most countries of 
emerging Europe
, in˝ation is revised down slightly 
relative to the April 2017 
World Economic Outlook
 projections. But there are risks for higher in˝ation 

should high wage growth ˜nally push up headline 
in˝ation as external disin˝ationary pressure wanes.
Looking further ahead, the question is how strong 
and sustainable the cyclical recovery can be. 
On the one hand, growth has surprised on the 

upside, and estimates of potential growth have

been revised up. More upward revisions could 
follow in response to the cyclical rebound. On 
the other hand, the risks to global growth over 
the medium term appear mainly to the downside 
(see below), and Europe is swimming against a 
tide of still-weak productivity growth and adverse 

demographics. Accordingly, the projections are for 
more moderate growth over the medium term.
Less Downside Risk in the Short Term, but Not in the Medium Term
Risks to the outlook have been lowered by the 
strong recovery and supportive policies in the 
short term, but medium-term risks continue to be 
tilted to the downside.
Ł On the 
upside, a stronger-than-anticipated 
global recovery in the short run could 
facilitate countries™ reform e˛orts, further 
boosting con˜dence and investment and 

sustaining the momentum in activity. In 
addition, there may still be more slack than 
estimated in various European economies, and 

the rebound in activity through 2018 could 
thus be stronger than projected.
Ł External 
downside
 risks facing the entire 

region include rising protectionism and 
policy changes in major economies that could weigh on the global economy and 
European economies through trade, ˜nancial, 

and investment channels. Geopolitical risks 
(for example, those associated with North 
Korea
) are more of a concern than usual. In 
addition, the prolonged search for yield in 
˜nancial markets has raised the sensitivity of 

the ˜nancial system to shocks as well as the 
system™s susceptibility to reversals of investor 
sentiment. Adjustments could be disruptive 

if there are monetary policy surprises in 
major economies. Higher debt service and 
re˜nancing risks could stress leveraged ˜rms, 
households, and vulnerable sovereigns. Finally, 
a downturn in 
China could signi˜cantly a˛ect 
European exports.
Ł Domestic 
downside
 risks vary within the 

region with impact more tilted to the 
medium term. oIn 
the euro area, 
high-debt countries may have di˙culties coping with

higher borrowing costs when monetary 
accommodation is reduced.
 oStructural weaknesses in pockets of the 

European banking system in the form of weak 
pro˜tability and high NPL levels could trigger 

˜nancial distress.
 oFor several 
emerging European
 countries, faster 
wage growth could result in higher in˝ation 
and adversely a˛ect competitiveness. ˚is 
could interact with a tightening of global 
˜nancial conditions in response to shifts 
in investor sentiment and undercut capital 
in˝ows and growth.
 o˚e lack of real income convergence along 

with elevated unemployment in many 
euro 
area 
countries could challenge the cohesion of the Economic and Monetary Union.
 o˚e lower appetite for European integration 

could a˛ect the reform e˛orts of non-EU 
members in the region aspiring to 
EU membership.
 o˚ere could be protracted policy and 

economic uncertainty on a broad range of 

issues for both the European Union and 
the United Kingdom
, because of the complex and drawn-out process and compressed 
timeframe for negotiations on the post-Brexit
 economic relationship. If 
the United Kingdom
 
leaves the European Union without an 
agreement, there will be a notable increase 
in trade barriers, potentially accompanied 
by disruption of services in various sectors, 
with signi˜cant negative impact on economic 
activity.
 In addition, while political risks 

in Europe have receded somewhat, new 
risks are emerging, including from tensions 
and uncertainty related to the Catalan 

independence movement.
With relatively strong activity and upside risks 

in the short term, but downside risks over the 
medium term, macroeconomic policies need to 

rebuild room for policy maneuver. ˚e strength 
of cyclical growth has surprised on the positive 
side, but ˜scal bu˛ers are thin in several countries, 

prospects for productivity growth are weak 
(despite the modest recovery in investment), and 
crisis legacies are still unresolved. Accordingly, 

policy priorities for most of the region should be 
reducing ˜scal de˜cits, while keeping monetary 
policies supportive where warranted to sustain an 

increase in in˝ation to targets. In addition, faster 
progress in structural reforms is needed to boost 
productivity and accelerate income convergence, 
which has stalled, including in the euro area
 (see IMF 2017a). Should downside risks materialize, 

further monetary accommodation would be 
appropriate, supported by a relaxation of ˜scal 
policies where space is available. At the same time, 

relatively strong GDP and employment growth 
mean that this is a good time for structural reforms 
to boost an otherwise mediocre medium-term 
growth outlook.
Ł For 
the euro area
 and most of advanced 
Europe
, subdued underlying in˝ation points to the need for monetary policy to remain 
accommodative for an extended period. Any 
further change in the forward guidance or 
policies should be underpinned by a clear 

shift in the path of actual in˝ation or a much stronger assessment of the in˝ation 
outlook. In particular, for the ECB to reach 

its medium-term in˝ation objective, it is 
inevitable that countries with the strongest 
cyclical position will have to accept in˝ation 

rates above this objective for some time. In 
the United Kingdom
, a gradual tightening of monetary policy is warranted to help bring 

in˝ation back to target.Ł In Russia
, with in˝ation now below target, 
further monetary easing should continue at 

a gradual pace, given risks to the in˝ation 

outlook linked with the uncertain size of the 
231. E
UROPE™S ECONOMY HITTING ITS STRIDEInternational Monetary Fund

output gap and the potential reversal of the 
exchange-rate-driven disin˝ation.
Ł In 
Turkey
, tighter monetary policy, within a 

simpler monetary framework, is needed to 
anchor expectations and reduce in˝ation.
Ł In the other 
emerging market economies
, 
preparations should be made to gradually 

normalize monetary policy in order to keep 
in˝ation expectations anchored if underlying 
in˝ation rises persistently in response 

to growing wage pressure and/or higher 
external in˝ation.In 
advanced Europe,
 a number of countries have 
high public debt ratios and limited ˜scal bu˛ers, including Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain
, and the United Kingdom.
 With growth picking up 

and output gaps closing, these countries should gradually consolidate to rebuild policy room and 
put debt on a downward path. In those economies 
with stronger ˜scal positions, notably 
Germany, 
the Netherlands
, and Sweden
, the available space 

can be used to help lift potential growth, which 
will help healthy external rebalancing. ˚is could 
include, for example, greater public investment in 

education and training (Germany
, the Netherlands
), digitalization, the integration of refugees, 
infrastructure (
Germany
), and housing (Sweden
). 
Importantly, in all countries, ˜scal policy could 
be made more growth and distribution friendly. 
Making public spending more e˙cient and 
growth oriented, while designing taxation to be 
more supportive of job creation and productivity 
growth, could further strengthen the foundations 
of the recovery and underpin the medium-term 

growth potential. As discussed in the October 
2017 Fiscal Monitor
, ˜scal and redistributive 
objectives can be achieved through revenue-neutral 

increases in tax progressivity, spending 
reallocations, and improved spending e˙ciency.
In 
emerging Europe
, many countries need to tighten ˜scal policy, enhance the quality of 
expenditure, and improve revenue composition. 

Despite a broadly complete cyclical recovery, 
the size of ˜scal de˜cits is still relatively large in 
Hungary,
 Poland
, and Romania 
as well as in a 
number of Western Balkan
 and CIS economies. 
Given the need to preserve competitiveness and 
build room for policy maneuver, more ˜scal 
consolidation is appropriate in these economies. 

In 
Russia
, ˜scal adjustment should rely on better-
targeted and more permanent reforms to the 
pension system, tax exemptions, and subsidies 

while protecting public and human capital 
investment. In addition, a credible ˜scal rule is 
paramount to support medium-term sustainability 

and mitigate the e˛ect of oil price volatility. In 
Turkey
, given strong growth momentum, there is 
a need to reevaluate the degree of accommodation 

and to plan for credible medium-term 
consolidation.In 
advanced Europe
, policymakers can take a number of actions to facilitate the repair of 
banks™ balance sheets. ˚e ECB™s March 2017 
guidance on NPL management and the most 
recent proposals that set supervisory expectations 
for provisioning new NPLs are positive steps. 
˚ey need a strong follow-up. Countries should 
agree on ambitious reduction targets, with 
vigorous supervisory follow-up. Moreover, 

member states should apply the framework, with 
due proportionality, to smaller banks that are 
not covered by the ECB guidance. Legislative 

changes to harmonize corporate insolvency and 
foreclosure frameworks and improve judicial 
e˙ciency would help stimulate secondary markets. 

Banks™ persistently low pro˜tability points to a 
need for further consolidation and restructuring 
of the system. Consolidation is a private-sector-led 

process, but policymakers and supervisors can help 
incentivize banks™ adjustment, including through 
supervisory pressure.
In 
emerging Europe
, in many economies, resolving 
elevated NPLs requires a multipronged approach, 
as discussed in detail in Chapter 3 of this report. 
24REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EURO
PEInternational Monetary Fund
 | November 2017
In particular, comprehensive asset quality reviews 
on the scale of impaired assets and adequacy 
of provisioning, coupled with supervised and 
time-bound action plans, would help. ˚ere is also 
a need to improve the bankruptcy and insolvency 

regimes, speed up the slow court procedures, and 
improve land registries and cadastral systems to 
enhance collateralization.
In 
advanced Europe
, countries should take advantage of the recovery to push forward 
with structural reforms to lift potential growth, 
close competitiveness gaps, and enhance their 

resilience to shocks. For example, in 
the euro 
area, 
many countries need ambitious labor and product market reforms. At the EU level, 

stricter enforcement of the Macroeconomic 
Imbalance Procedure could be combined with 
incentives for structural reforms in the form 

of targeted support from central funds and 
outcome-based benchmarks.
In addition, 
euro area 
policymakers should seize 
the moment of steady recovery and a more 

favorable political environment to push ahead with 
architectural reforms to strengthen the Economic 
and Monetary Union. First, while much progress 

has been made since the crisis, further actions are 
needed to complete the Banking Union, including 
by establishing common deposit insurance and a 

common ˜scal backstop. Second, with Europe™s 
largest ˜nancial market leaving the single market, 
it is more urgent than ever to build the Capital 
Markets Union. ˚ird, a central ˜scal capacity 
would help improve 
the euro area™s
 ability to o˛set 
shocks, by reducing ˜scal space constraints at the 
national level. Such architectural reform needs 
simultaneous action on resolving banking sector 

legacies and stricter implementation of common ˜scal rules and should be complemented by policy 
e˛orts at the national level. In some countries, 

reforms to improve public sector e˙ciency and to 
increase labor force participation through better 
active labor market policies are also important.
In 
other advanced European economies 
and the Nordics
, reform priorities vary. For example, in 
the United Kingdom, 
reforms
 to boost potential 
growth could include increasing infrastructure 
spending, easing planning restrictions on housing, 
and reforming property taxes
. In 
Sweden, 
reforms 

to improve the housing supplyŠincluding by 

streamlining building regulations, harmonizing 
planning and approval processes across 
municipalities, and promoting the e˙cient use of 

property by phasing out rent controls and shifting 
the composition of property taxesŠcould help 
housing market rebalancing.
In 
emerging Europe
, structural reforms should 
focus on strengthening institutions, particularly 
judicial independence (see Chapter 2), and 
improving public sector e˙ciency. ˚is will also 

require restructuring state-owned enterprises 
and strengthening public sector investment 
management frameworks, for example, in project 
appraisal and management (see the November 
2016 Regional Economic Issues: Central, Eastern, 

and Southeastern Europe
). Other priorities 
include labor market reforms to boost labor 
force participation rates of women and reduce 
high youth unemployment rates, especially in 
the Southeastern Europe non-EU
 and several 
CIS 
countries, as well as institutional improvements 
to lift the investment climate (see Chapter
 2). In 
Russia
, improvements in the institutional 

and business environment are prerequisites to 
realizing dividends from investing in innovation 
and other reforms. In 
Turkey
, the priorities 
include improving the business climate (especially 
institutional stability and quality), enhancing the quality of human capital, increasing domestic 
private savings, and addressing labor market 
rigidities to reduce informality and better 

integrate refugees.

˚e euro has appreciated considerably against the US dollar in the past few months (about 11
 percent from 
April to September 30, 2017). From a policy standpoint, it is important to know the factors behind the euro 

rally. Conceptually, the euro-dollar exchange rate would appreciate because of favorable economic prospects 

or tight monetary policy that raises interest rates in the euro area relative to the United States. Discriminating 

between these two factors, that is, economic news and monetary policy, is important since they can have 

di˛erent implications for exchange rate dynamics. ˚is box sheds light on these factors.
˚e empirical approach broadly follows Matheson and Stavrev 2014. It estimates economic news and 
monetary shocks for the euro area using a vector autoregression model. ˚e model includes 10-year bond 

yields and stock prices for the euro area and for the United States and the euro-dollar bilateral exchange 

rate at monthly frequency. News shocks in the euro area are identi˜ed using economically meaningful sign 

restrictions as follows: stock prices and bond yields increase following favorable economic news in the euro 

area. Additional restrictions are imposed to estimate a favorable news shock in the euro area relative to the 

United States, namely, that stock prices and bond yields in the United States decline following such a shock. 

˚e latter set of sign restrictions ensures that the identi˜ed favorable news in the euro area is not related to 

favorable news in the United States. Adverse monetary shocks in the euro area are identi˜ed by imposing that 

stock prices decline and bond yields increase in the euro area, and as before, to isolate adverse euro area shocks 

versus the United States, it is assumed that stock prices increase and bond yields decline in the United States. 

Using the model, the e˛ect of euro area news on the euro-dollar exchange rate since April 2017 is evaluated as 

follows: the estimated euro news shocks are set to zero, and the model is used to trace out the counterfactual 
Prepared by Raju Huidrom and Emil Stavrev.

euro-dollar exchange rate. ˚e simulation shows how the euro would have evolved relative to the dollar in the 
absence of the euro news shocks during that time. A similar counterfactual is constructed for monetary shocks 

in the euro area.
˚e estimation results suggest that ongoing improved economic prospects for the euro area vis-à-vis the 
United States were the main driver of the euro surge during AprilŒSeptember of this year. Market perceptions 

of monetary tightening have played a smaller but nontrivial role. In the absence of favorable economic news 

in the euro area (Box Figure
 1.1.1, panel 1), the euro-dollar appreciation since April 2017 would have been 

about 7½ percentage points lower than the actual 11
 percent, while absent the euro area monetary shocks it 

would have been only 1½
 percentage points lower (Box Figure

˜e countries of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern 
Europe (CESEE) have made major progress in 
raising living standards over the past two and a half 
decades. ˜is progress was supported by a radical 
transformation of their economies and institutions. 

Using case studies and empirical analysis, this chapter 
explores the role of internal and external factors, 
particularly accession to the European Union (EU), 

in supporting reforms to strengthen the e˚ectiveness 

of the judiciary. ˜e ˛ndings suggest that, beyond 
initial conditions, an enabling environment for 
judicial reforms was created by factors and policies 

that (1) improved the distribution of resources and 
opportunities, (2) upgraded rules and procedures to 
recruit and train civil servants, and (3)
 increased 
transparency and accountability. ˜e European 
Union and the Council of Europe (CoE) acted 

as strong external anchors in catalyzing reforms. 
However, there were also some reversals of reforms, 
and the sustainability of reforms appears to depend 
mainly on domestic factors. ˜ese ˛ndings might o˚er insights in particular for countries aiming to join 

the European Union, but also for others seeking to 
improve the e˚ectiveness of their judiciary.
Why Focus on Judicial Reforms?CESEE countries have made signi˜cant progress 
in improving institutions since the transition to 
market economies, but they need a new wave of 
structural reforms to sustain the rapid convergence 

of incomes. ˚e fast convergence before the global 
˜nancial crisis, particularly in the CESEE EU 
countries, was supported by high productivity 
gains from rapid integration into European 
˚is chapter was prepared by a sta˛ team consisting of Vizhdan 
Boranova, Raju Huidrom, Mariusz Jarmuzek, Martin Petri, Faezeh 
Raei, Tiberiu Scutaru, Ara Stepanyan, and Svetlana Vtyurina, with 

input from Nadeem Ilahi, Ricardo Llaudes, Pamela Madrid Angers, 

Francisco Parodi, Brett Rayner, Jason Weiss, and Ruifeng Zhang, 

as well as from country teams. ˚e team was led by Laura Papi,

supply chains, strong capital in˝ows attracted by 
underbanked economies, and extensive economic 
and institutional reforms implemented during the 
transition and EU accession. However, total factor 
productivity growth dropped substantially after 

the global ˜nancial crisis, and investment su˛ered. 
Projected declines in the working-age population, 
partly because of continued emigration, along with 

skill shortages compound the looming headwinds. 

With external conditions expected to be less 
supportive than during the transition, boosting 
potential growth requires a better environment for 

domestic savings and investment and, hence, new 
and more di˙cult institutional and governance 
reforms (˚omsen 2017a, 2017b). Sound legal 
institutions are vital in this regard.
Judicial reform and control of corruption are 
viewed as key structural reform priorities in 

many European countries. For example, the 

IMF has highlighted enhancing justice systems™ 
e˙ciency and capacity to facilitate debt resolution 
in several countries (IMF 2015); improving 

contract enforcement and protection of property 
rights in Kosovo, Serbia, and Slovenia; and 
strengthening anticorruption e˛orts in Bulgaria, 
Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and Ukraine. 
Recognizing progress made in many other 

structural reform areas, the May 2016 
Regional 
Economic Issues: Central, Eastern, and Southeastern 
Europe
 suggested that incomplete reforms of 
judicial systems and protection of property 
rights in many CESEE economies may explain 
a signi˜cant part of the productivity gaps with 
the EU15.1 Hence, judicial reforms may have 
considerable potential to boost incomes in the 
region (Figure
 2.1). Judicial reforms continue to 
be high on policymakers™ agendas and are relevant 

for all EU countries, but particularly for countries 
that aspire to join the European Union.

˚e IMF has long recognized the importance 
of good governance, including the rule of law, 
for long-term, inclusive growth (IMF 1997, 
2017a). Institutions that contribute to good 
governance need to be e˛ective in serving the 

well-being of all in society as opposed to only a 
few (Box
 2.1). Recently, the IMF has highlighted 
the pernicious e˛ects of corruption, especially 

on inclusive growth and on citizens™ trust (IMF 

2016a). In discussing the 2017 Board Paper on 
the IMF™s role in governance, Directors called 
for further work in this area. In the October 

2017 Global Policy Agenda, the IMF Managing 
Director stated that ﬁ[s]trengthening governance 
is essential in building support for reforms needed 
to raise long-term growth and ensure a domestic 
level-playing ˜eldﬂ and that ﬁ[t]he Fund will 

strengthen its engagement on governance and 
corruption issuesﬂ (IMF 2017d). ˚is study seeks 
to contribute to this work stream.
CESEE countries greatly improved their 
institutions, including the judiciary, during 

the transition and EU accession, and hence their experiences can provide useful insights. 
By choosing to join the European Union, most 
countries in the region have committed to the 
goal of e˛ective rule of law. ˚e di˛erences in 

the institutional quality in these countriesŠdespite somewhat similar settings, major 
reforms everywhere, and the common goal of 
EU accessionŠprovide historical and recent 
background to study the factors a˛ecting 

institutional progress. Hence, this chapter focuses 
on the 20 CESEE countries that are EU members 
or seek to join the European Union.

justice systems and, to a more limited extent, 
the protection of property rights.

interactions and hence economic outcomes. ˚e World Bank™s 
2017 World Development Report
 emphasizes that the rule of law is ﬁthe very basis of 
good governance needed to realize full social and 

economic development,ﬂ but that the existence 
of laws does not assure these outcomes (World 
Bank 2017). Hence, the report calls for a focus 
on ﬁthe role of law,ﬂ which means its e˛ect on 
the functions of the legal system rather than its 
form. E˛ective rule of law also plays a key role 
in control of corruption (Lagarde 2016, 2017). 
Within the rule of law, the e˛ectiveness of the 

justice system and protection of property rightsŠ
which depend on the justice system to a large extent, but also on other elementsŠare critical to 
economic outcomes.4˚is chapter explores the question of what

a comprehensive empirical analysis, with a view 
to distilling concrete policy lessons for countries 
that endeavor to improve the e˛ectiveness of their 
judiciary systems. Importantly, the analysis does 
not provide legal assessments, but tries to address 

the following questions:
Ł What were the speci˜c reforms of the justice 
system and protection of property rights and 
the context in which they took place?Ł How have judicial reforms evolved over time, 
and how do they compare across countries?
Ł Which factors facilitated these reforms?
Ł What was the role of domestic factors and of 

the European Union in enabling change?
˚e chapter begins with an analytical framework 

that explores factors a˛ecting institutional quality. 

Drawing on the framework, the section that 
follows presents country experiences. ˚e chapter 
then o˛ers a stocktaking of CESEE progress on 

judicial e˛ectiveness, discusses factors that may 
have contributed to judicial reforms, and puts 
forth conclusions.
How to Analyze Institutional 
Quality: Conceptual Framework˚e literature o˛ers several theories to analyze 
di˛erences in institutional quality that are 
combined in this chapter into a uni˜ed framework. As factors a˛ecting judicial 

e˛ectiveness are likely to be similar to those 
determining broader institutional quality, this 
section draws on the literature on institutions. 

Institutions that contribute to good governance 
need to be e˛ective in serving the well-being of 
everyone in society.
5 Institutional theories can be 
grouped into several approaches (Annex
 2.1). ˚is 
chapter adopts a political economy framework, 
5Acemoˆlu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005) refer to e˛ective insti
-tutions as ﬁinclusive institutionsﬂ and contrast them with ﬁextractive 
institutions,ﬂ Fukuyama (2011) speaks of ﬁaccountable governmentﬂ 

versus ﬁpatrimonialism,ﬂ and Mungiu-Pippidi (2015) refers to ﬁethi
-
cal universalismﬂ versus ﬁparticularism.ﬂ
building mainly on Acemoˆlu, Johnson, and 
Robinson (2005), a seminal paper on the political 
economy approach. ˚is framework encompasses 
two critical features: (1)
 economic institutions™ 
distributional consequences, which in turn a˛ect 
institutions, giving rise to important feedback 
loops; and (2) politicians™ inability to commit 
to act only in the public interest, exacerbating 

collective action problems (Figure
 2.2).6 De jure 
political power depends on political institutions, 

which result from initial conditions, ideology, 
and state capacity. De facto political power 
also depends on resource distribution and how 
di˛erent groups in society interact via bargaining. 
Given preferences of di˛erent groups in society, 

those with the most political power (both de facto 
and de jure) determine prevailing institutions 
and use them in their interest. Institutions then 

a˛ect economic outcomes, the distribution of resources, and state capacity in subsequent 
periods, generating feedback loops between 
resource distribution and political and economic 
institutions.According to this framework, in societies without 
dominant players, gaining political power is 

more competitive, leading to rules-based decision 
making and e˛ective institutions. A concentrated 
distribution of resources and opportunities limits 

possibilities for many people to gain power. Many 
have expressed concern about large ˜rms™ in˝uence 
on the rules of the game (Guriev 2017; Zingales 
2017). Conversely, civil society tends to promote 
participatory processes and e˛ective institutions.
˚e greater a society™s ability to solve collective 
action problems, the more likely it is to 

establish e˛ective institutions. Societies with less 
fragmentation along various dimensions (for 
example, ethnicities and cultures) tend to ˜nd it 
easier to reach agreement and solve their collective 
action problems (Trumbull 2012). Fragmentation 

in this context measures divisiveness and power 
imbalances as opposed to diversity. More diverse 
societies, particularly those where the views 

of di˛erent groups are well represented and 
6In this context, the collective action problem is the inability to 
take actions that maximize the well-being of society as a whole.

respected (that is, minority rights), might actually 
be better at ˜nding common ground. Higher 
levels of transparency and accountability alleviate 
information asymmetries, discourage rent-seeking 
behavior, and may help overcome trust de˜cits, 
thereby facilitating time-consistent behavior in 

the pursuit of long-term goals, coordination, and 
cooperation (World Bank 2017).
˚e capacity of the public administration is also important for institutional quality. In 
countries with established rules and procedures 

for hiring and training public employees, 
political interference in public administration 
decision making is more limited and public 
service provision is better (Andrews, Pritchett, 
and Woolcock 2012). However, the capacity of 

the public administration itself may depend on powerful groups™ decisions regarding state capacity.
Initial conditions and the external environment 
in˝uence many of the above-mentioned elements 
through di˛erent channels:
Ł Initial conditions:
 History, geography, 
culture, societal norms, the initial level of 

development, and legal origins can matter in 
various ways.
Ł External shocks:
 ˚reats to sovereignty or crises 
could create a common purpose and make 
it easier to solve collective action problems, 
though the opposite could also occur. 
Technological change and other shocks could 
alter the distribution of resources and change 

the balance of power.
Ł Openness:
 Greater openness may promote a 

better judiciary to the extent that investors 
reward rules-based business environments and 
businesses adapt to global standards. Import 

competition in domestic markets may reduce 
the monopolization of power.
Ł External anchors:
 A prominent example is the 
European Union. ˚e expected bene˜ts from 

EU accession may have outweighed the loss 
of domestic policy autonomy for politically powerful groups, helping overcome domestic 

resistance to reforms (Box
 2.2). ˚e CoE (all countries concerned except Kosovo are 
members) has also helped CESEE countries advance judicial reforms through its binding 
and nonbinding legal standards. Assistance 

from international ˜nancial institutions 
may also provide incentives for broader 
institutional reforms.

˚e empirical analysis in this chapter considers all the factors presented in the above framework, 
while most previous studies test the relevance 
of speci˜c hypotheses. ˚e September 2005 
World Economic Outlook
 found that openness 
and accountability were associated with higher 
institutional quality, while natural resource 
abundance was negatively associated with it. 

More recent studies suggest that imperfect 

accountability, limited transparency, and high 
income inequality hinder institutional quality (Ganiou Mijiyawa 2013; EBRD 2013). Several 

studies provide evidence of the bene˜cial role of 
an external anchor, such as the European Union 
(EBRD 2013; September 2005 
World Economic 
Outlook
). However, others argue that institutional 
reforms slowed after countries were o˛ered EU 

membership and even reversed in some cases after 
the countries joined (Mungiu-Pippidi 2015). 
Prima facie, high and positive correlations are 
observed between the current level of economic 
aspects of the rule of law and the initial equality 

of resource distribution, transparency, and the 
capacity of public administration (Figure
 2.3).7 However, more analysis is needed to understand 

causality given the feedback loops between 
institutions and economic outcomes.˚is section refers to the EU concepts of e˛ective 
justice systems and protection of property rights. 
˚e European Commission™s Aquis Judiciary and 
Fundamental Rights Chapter states that ﬁthe 

establishment of an independent and e˙cient judiciary is of paramount importance. Impartiality, 
integrity and a high standard of adjudication by 

the courts are essential for safeguarding the rule of 
law. Equally, member states must ˜ght corruption 
e˛ectively, as it represents a threat to the stability 

of democratic institutions and the rule of law.ﬂ 
˚e Acquis notes that e˛ective protection of 
property rightsŠestablished by the European 

Human Rights Convention and the EU Charter 
of Fundamental RightsŠhinges on enforcement 
capacity, which requires an e˛ective judiciary.

independence, and impartiality in order to capture 
the overall e˛ectiveness of the judicial system.
˚is chapter uses a wide range of information sources.
 It relies extensively on the standard 
setting and evaluations of the CoE bodiesŠthe 

European Commission for the E˙ciency of 
Justice (
Commission européenne pour l™e˝cacité 
de la justiceŠCEPEJ) and the Group of States 
against Corruption (GRECO)Šand the European 
Commission™s reports, as well as on other studies 

and experts. However, CEPEJ data and the EU 
Justice Scoreboards start in 2010 or later. To have 
quantitative indicators over a long period for 
more countries and dimensions, and following 
most previous studies, we also employ data from 

the World Bank™s 
Worldwide Governance 
and Doing Business Indicators
, the World Economic 

Forum, the Varieties of Democracy Institute, and 

other sources (Annex
 2.2). Most of these data are 

perception based and thus more subjective than 
other economic indicators. Nevertheless, economic 
decisions are based on agents™ perceptions of many 

factors, including governance, e˛ectiveness of the 
judiciary, and property rights protection. CoE 
2015 notes that ﬁ . . . other factors, such as public perception, political culture and safeguards against 
corruption have a clear impact on the ability of 

courts and judges to command legitimacy and do 
their job.ﬂ ˚e case studies that follow here rely on 
many sources to understand the context in which 
judicial reforms took place.
Country Case Studies˚is section analyzes judicial reform episodes 
in six countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
Croatia, Estonia, Poland, Romania, and Serbia. 
Employing the framework presented earlier, 

the section discusses factors shaping judicial e˛ectiveness, such as the equality of resource 
distribution, transparency and accountability, 
state capacity, political power, and the role of 
external anchors. ˚e mix of cases aims to ensure 

adequate representation across the region. We

conducive to an e˛ective judiciary (Estonia,

domestic fundamentals (Romania), and countries 

that went through civil strife (Bosnia and

drivers of change.

EstoniaConducive initial conditions and carefully 
designed policies helped establish e˛ective 
institutions in Estonia. Estonia™s favorable initial 
conditions included a vibrant civil society. 
A relatively inclusive reform process ensured 

widespread distribution of privatized assets and 
eliminated barriers to foreign trade and investment 
by reducing high tari˛s and nontari˛ restrictions. 

˚is limited the formation of national oligopolies 
and enhanced transparency and accountability to 
enable the involvement of citizens in the political 
process. Signi˜cant early investment in the 

capacity of the judiciary was also instrumental for 
judicial independence.Estonia™s transition involved a major and 
rapid overhaul of the institutional framework. 
Initial reforms laid out solid foundations for 
an independent judiciary. ˚e Court Act and 

the Legal Status of Judges Act, adopted in 

1991, regulated the functions of the judiciary 
(Gherasimov 2015). Drawing on Estonia™s 1938 
constitution, a new constitution adopted in 

1992 provided the basis for the separation and 
balance of powers and guarantees for judicial 
independence. ˚e new constitution reinstated 
a parliamentary democracy founded on legal 
continuity with the pre-Soviet Estonia (Pärna 

2005). ˚e guarantees took the form of life tenure for judges and protection against their 
removal from o˙ce (OSI 2001), while decisional 
independence and impartiality were assured by 
limits on judges™ cross-branch or outside activity 

(GRECO 2013). ˚e new judicial system became 
operational in 1993.Subsequent reforms solidi˜ed the judiciary™s 
independence and e˙ciency. ˚e 2002 Courts 
Act helped reduce the in˝uence of the Ministry 
of Justice and eliminated political involvement in 
disciplining judges by transferring the authority 
to initiate proceedings against judges from the 

ministry to the Legal Chancellor. Further, the 
2010 Courts Act introduced shared oversight of 
the administration of courts by the Ministry of 
Justice and the Court Administration Advisory 
Council (leaving the Ministry of Justice in charge 
of budgetary issues, however). In recent years, 

the integrity of the judiciary improved further 
(for example, via supervision of judges™ assets 
and interest declarations), and so did e˙ciency 

(Figure
 2.4). ˚e privatization process ensured broad 
distribution of resources, fostering e˛ective 
institutions. Estonia™s privatization aimed at 

putting assets into the hands of those with the incentives and skills to use them e˛ectively, while 
ensuring wide participation across society (Nellis 

1996). ˚e 1993 Privatization Law guaranteed 
broadly equal rights to domestic and foreign 
investors and physical and legal persons, while 

entities with more than a 30
 percent public 
stake were excluded. By 1995, divestiture was 
largely completed, having turned many people into private owners and contributed to attaining 
income inequality levels similar to the EU average 
(Taube and Weber 1999; Laar 2007).
88However, some point to limited integration of the 
Russian-speaking minority as a cost of the otherwise inclusive reform 
strategy (OSCE 2014; ECRI 1999, 2015).

˚e rapid and sustained progress on institutional 
reforms was underpinned by favorable domestic 
factors (Figure
 2.5). Speci˜cally:
Ł ˚e distribution of resources and 
opportunities in Estonia in the mid-1990s was 

similar to the EU average.
Ł ˚e strength of civil society and the control of 

political corruption were similar to the EU15 
average by the mid-1990s, providing checks 
and balances.9Ł Government censorship was e˛ectively 

abolished following the establishment of a 
private press and private broadcasting during 
1991Œ94. Further, the media assumed a 
watchdog role regarding political scandals 
(Vihalemm and Masso 2003). Legal 
guarantees of access to information and extensive use of e-government increased 

transparency and accountability.
9Control of corruption declined between 2001 and 2011, but has 
improved again in the past few years and is now comparable to the 
EU15 average.
Ł ˚e introduction of a modern legal and 
administrative framework for the civil service 
greatly strengthened public sector capacity, 
with assistance from various countries and 
institutions. A large part of the civil service 
was replaced with new personnel selected 

based on merit. ˚is was considered one of the 
most comprehensive administrative reforms 
in the region (Sarapuu 2012; Tõnnisson and 

Randma-Liiv 2008).Given the strong domestic drive for reforms, the 
European Union mainly provided benchmarks 
guaranteeing high standards in Estonia. EU 
accession negotiations began informally in 1993. ˚e Free Trade Agreement with the European 
Union came into force in 1995 (Figure
 2.6). ˚e European Commission deemed Estonia™s respect 

for the rule of law and protection of property 

rights in line with its requirements in 1998.

PolandFavorable initial conditions combined with the 
commitment to EU membership helped Poland 
achieve signi˜cant progress in judicial reform, but 
the process has been neither smooth nor linear. 

While Poland had strong initial conditions in 
terms of an active civil society and freedom of 
information that promoted signi˜cant reforms 

early in the transition, these conditions were not 
enough to ensure sustained progress in judicial 
reforms. Insu˙cient e˛orts to build the capacity 
of the judiciary, combined with deterioration in 
the equality of incomes and opportunities, appear 

to have contributed to some reversals in judicial 
independence. Commitment to EU membership supported by the country™s vibrant civil society 

helped overcome some of these setbacks. However, 
in 2017 the European Commission launched 
an infringement procedure against Poland over 

legislation regarding the judiciary on concerns that 
the legislation may undermine its independence.Poland™s active civil society before the transition 
provided some favorable initial conditions for 

institutional reform (Figure
 2.7). According to 
Bruszt and others (2009), political opposition 
before 1989 was more intense in Central and 

Eastern Europe, especially in Poland, compared 
with other communist countries. A vibrant civil society, and notably the role of the trade unions, 

was important for the formation of institutions 
that provided checks and balances. Moreover, 

a massive expansion of media outlets enabled 

debates over social problems.
With a strong civil society and freedom of 
information, reforms of property rights and the 
judiciary started early. ˚e 1989 constitutional 
amendments sanctioned the independence of 
judges and introduced the separation of the 
judiciary from other branches of government. 
Together with the 1988 Law on Economic 
Activity, this laid the foundation for freedom of 
business activity and property rights protection 

(Figure
 2.8). A critical step in establishing judicial autonomy was the creation of the 
National Judicial Council, which recommends 

judgeship candidates to the president. When the 
preaccession process started in 1994, the judiciary 
had already been deeply transformed. In its ˜rst 

report, the European Commission stated that ﬁthe 
independence of the Polish judiciary vis-à-vis other 
institutions appears securedﬂ (EC 1997). A new 

constitution approved in 1997 further separated 
powers and strengthened the Constitutional 
Tribunal and property rights protection. Perceived 
judicial independence was at a high level already in 
1995, but deteriorated thereafter.
While privatization was not smooth, neither was it 
hasty, which helped limit resource concentration.

(Iwanek and Wellisz 1993). However, large-scale 
privatization took much longer than expected 
(Patena 2015). ˚is slow process allowed private 
˜rms to emerge and compete for acquisition of public assets, which may have limited resource 
concentration. Meanwhile, state-owned enterprises 

(SOEs) still play an important role in the economy 
and dominate some sectors.However, Poland™s judicial system witnessed a 
considerable deterioration during 1997Œ2003. ˚e systemic judicial reforms and sizable changes 

in the opportunities available in the private and 
public sectorsŠas growth rapidly expanded jobs 
and pay in the former, while the latter did not 

adjust as quicklyŠcreated signi˜cant challenges 
for judiciary e˛ectiveness. ˚e system was not 
prepared for the large in˝ux of cases caused by 
the systemic changes to the legal system and the economy (Freedom House 2003; Kucharczyk and 

Zbieranek 2010). ˚is resulted in long processing 
times for legal cases and di˙culties in enforcing 
court decisions (EC 1997). Many low-paid judges 
left to join the private sector, further diminishing 
judiciary capacity. Instances of corruption among

the judiciary were observed in the 2000s, as long 
waits for routine commercial court decisions 
created incentives for bribery (EC 2000). ˚e 
perception of corruption, the capacity of public 

administration, and equality of incomes and opportunities deteriorated during 1998Œ2003 
(Kucharczyk and Zbieranek 2010).
Despite these setbacks, the commitment to 
reforms under the EU accession framework 
provided a strong impulse to rebuild trust in the 
judiciary (Figure
 2.9). Poland™s vibrant civil society 

once again fostered a civil movement resulting 
in a high turnout in the 2007 elections. Voters 
expressed dissatisfaction with some government 

measures viewed as undermining the rule of law. 
˚e EU oversight combined with the media™s role 
helped address these challenges, as re˝ected in the 

improvement in Poland™s ranking on the control of 
corruption index over its 2006 ranking (Ekiert and 
Soroka 2013). Another positive development was 
the reestablishment of an open and competitive 
process for recruiting senior government o˙cials 

after 2007, resulting in a notable improvement 
in Poland™s ranking on the index of public 
administration capacity. 
˚e con˝uence of these positive developments 
may have contributed to the improvement in 
the 2007Œ09 perceived judicial independence. 
In response to several rulings by the European 

Court of Human Rights against Poland due to 
the length of proceedings, the government passed 

a law in 2004 aimed at addressing the undue 
length of court proceedings (Kucharczyk and 
Zbieranek 2010). In 2009, the government also 

increased judges™ salaries in response to massive 
protests (Kucharczyk and Zbieranek 2010). 
In October 2009, the Parliament revised the 

1985 Act on Public Prosecution, separating the 
Ministry of Justice and the O˙ce of the Public 
Prosecutor General, although this was reversed in 
2016. ˚e CoE acknowledged the constitutional 
independence of the Polish judiciary, pointing to 

only limited involvement of the Justice Minister 
(GRECO 2013).In the summer of 2017, the EC launched an 
infringement procedure against Poland on 
concerns about judicial independence arising from 

new legislation. ˚e government is undertaking 
judicial changes with the stated purpose ﬁto 
meet people™s expectations and increase the 
democratization of the judiciaryﬂ (Polish Justice 
Ministry 2017), including raising the e˙ciency 

of courts and reducing case backlogs. In 2016, 
the European Commission used a new EU 
framework (see Box
 2.2) and initiated the rule of 

law investigation regarding the amendments to the 
Constitutional Tribunal adopted during 2015Œ16. 
˚e 2017 Law on Ordinary Courts Organization 

gives discretionary power to the minister of justice 
to prolong the mandate of judges who have 
reached retirement age (di˛erentiated for women

and men), as well as to dismiss and appoint 
court presidents. ˚e EC is concerned that the 
minister™s discretionary power will undermine the 
courts™ independence, and it is also concerned 
about gender discrimination. ˚e EC launched 
the infringement procedure in July 2017 and 
issued a reasoned opinion in September 2017 after 
receiving the Polish authorities™ letter regarding the 

approved law (EC 2017a, 2017c). Two additional 

draft laws that concern the Supreme Court and the 
National Judicial Council, vetoed by the president 
in July 2017, are currently being redrafted. 

Discussions between the Polish authorities and the 
EC are ongoing.
RomaniaRomania™s experience demonstrates the key role 
of an external anchor when domestic dynamics pose challenges to strengthening institutions. 
Civil society had been suppressed and the 

post-transition government did not have an 
appetite for reform. Privatization resulted in 
more concentrated resource distribution. Little 
investment in the capacity of the judiciary left 
the system with politically connected judges 
who resisted reforms. ˚e EU accession played 
a catalytic role in strengthening civil society, 
freedom of information, and state capacity. ˚is 

led to greater demand for and improvement in 
judicial independence and capacity. Nevertheless, 
Romania™s achievements in judicial reform 

remain incomplete, and problems persist with the 
implementation of court decisions (EC 2016a; 
GRECO 2016).In an environment of weak civil society, the 
government that came to power in 1990 made 
little progress on reforms. ˚e austerity program 
introduced in the 1980s to repay the country™s 

national debt resulted in shortages of basic goods 
and frequent electricity blackouts (Dˇianu 2004). 
Oppression coupled with feelings of mistrust and 

secrecy cultivated by the old regime weakened 
civil society (Rossi 2012). Neither the student 
movement nor peripheral grassroots movements 

had the organizational capacity to replace the 
National Salvation Front (NSF) Party, which 
originated in the Communist Party. ˚e NSF 
stayed in power longer than the originally expected 
interim role (Agh 2004; Siani-Davies 2005;
 Pralong 2004; Paramio 2002; Rossi 2012). Also, 

prevalent corruption hindered reforms, which 
previous elites bitterly opposed (Roman 2002; 
Dallara 2014).
In this challenging environment, judicial reforms 
faced many di˙culties despite the EU accession 
process. Magistrates were generally loyal to the 
old regime, which limited judiciary independence 
(Demsorean, Parvulescu, and Vetrici-Soimu 
2009). In 2002, the European Union postponed 
Romania™s accession until 2007. ˚e 2003 
constitution institutionalized a powerful Superior 
Council of the Magistracy (SCM) charged with 

the careers, appointments, promotions, and 

evaluations of magistrates. However, de facto, 
all these competencies were exercised by the 
Justice Ministry (Coman 2009). ˚e lack of 
judicial independence also weighed on property 
rights protection.
Romania™s postcommunist privatizations 
contributed to the emergence of political and business elites who resisted reforms to the 
judiciary and protection of property rights. ˚e 

privatization of large enterprises was long and 

contentious. Many viable large-scale enterprises 
were sold at ˜re sales, while the insolvent ones 
continued to burden the state (Gabanyi 2004; 
Bacon 2004). Members of the elite used their 
political power and control over state resources to 

solidify their control over the economy, politics, 
and the judiciary (Gabanyi 2004). Moreover, 
several nationalist political forces opposed 
foreign investors™ participation in privatization 
(Paramio 2002). All this resulted in a signi˜cant 

concentration of resources, with the Gini 
coe˙cientŠa measure of inequalityŠrising by 
10 percentage points by the late 1990s.
A turning point came in 2004, when civil society gathered strength, capitalizing on the move toward 
EU accession. Civil society organizations launched an anticorruption campaign for the 2004 election, 

o˛ering to screen political parties™ candidates 
512. R

on integrity criteria (Mungiu-Pippidi 2015). 
˚e earlier adoption of freedom of information 
legislation driven by EU accession facilitated 
this campaign. Civil society organizations used 
it to expose politicians™ dishonest behavior 
and won several litigation cases against the 
government. ˚is coincided with some decline 

in the perception of the corruption in politics. 
˚ese factors, together with the prospect of 
EU accession, created common ground for the 
formation of an opposition coalition, despite unfavorable initial conditions (Vachudova 2006). 
Tangible reforms started in 2004 (Figure
 2.11). Following the elections, the new minister of justice 

quickly implemented judicial reforms and an 
anticorruption strategy to ful˜ll EU requirements 
(Dallara 2010; Mendelski 2012). A law envisaging 
the appointment of the courts™ presidents and 
prosecutors was approved against the SCM™s 

opposition (Coman 2007; Carp 2007), but declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional 
Court, which included several members of the 

SCM and the old Communist Party (Dallara 
2014). A revised version of the law was adopted, 
which included weaker provisions for judicial 
reforms. Although the European Union accepted 
this version, it introduced the Cooperation and 
Veri˜cation Mechanism (CVM) to address areas 

deemed in need of further progress, including the 
judiciary™s independence and impartiality and the 
˜ght against corruption (EC 2007; Dallara 2014).
After EU accession in 2007, judicial reform 
slowed (Figure
 2.12). ˚e reform-minded minister 
of justice was replaced in the reshu˘ing of the 
government in 2007. Parliament endorsed a 

revised criminal code providing legal ways to 
protect corrupt o˙cials, although adoption of 
the code was postponed and it was later modi˜ed 
(Dallara 2014). In addition, the government 
attempted to restrict the Constitutional Court™s 
powers and threatened to impeach judges (Blokker 
2013; Dallara 2014). ˚e European Union also 
criticized Romania for not respecting values of 

democracy and the rule of law (EC 2009), and 
the country™s ranking on the index of perceived 
judicial independence deteriorated.Average 2001Œ05

˚e situation improved after 2011 with the 
emergence of a new generation of judges more 
open to reforms and a further strengthening 
of civil society. ˚e National Institute for the 

Magistracy, which implemented the EU-driven 
reform of judicial training, started to graduate a 
new generation of well-trained judges (Piana and 
others 2013). Many Romanian judges involved 
in some CoE expert committees and other 

international judicial networks supported the 
di˛usion of best practices (Piana 2009). GRECO™s 
recommendations and the CVM promoted 
transparency, independence, and accountability 
of the justice system. ˚e judiciary™s e˙ciency 
also improved, as evidenced by a 30
 percent 

decline in disposition time for noncriminal cases over 2010Œ14 and more recently supported by 
increased resources allocated to the judiciary.
˚e trend regarding judicial reforms in Romania 
was positive until 2016, but since early 2017 

some signs of slowing down seem to be emerging. 
As described in several CVM reports, a track 
record pointing to good progress and growing 
irreversibility of the reforms was evident with 
stronger judicial institutions and strengthened 
corruption prevention. However, ﬁa number of 
key issues already identi˜ed in earlier reports have 

remained outstandingﬂ (January 2017 CVM).

of the judiciary and the e˛ectiveness of the

public demonstrations. Overall the Romania case

but requires sustained e˛orts for the reforms to 
become embedded and deliver a better functioning 
judiciary for all its citizens.
CroatiaInstitutional reforms in Croatia were slow 
during the initial stages of the transition, mainly owing to military con˝ict, but prospects for 
EU accession catalyzed reforms. Citing national 

security concerns, the government monopolized 
power, including over the justice system, during 
1991Œ2000 (Blitz 2003; Dallara 2014; Jo

2006). ˚e 1993 Court Act created the State 
Judicial Council (SJC), an independent body 
responsible for the selection and dismissal of 
judges. However, in practice, the SJC became a 
ﬁlever in the hands of the executiveﬂ (Uzelac 2003) 

and political in˝uence over judges™ removals and 
appointments continued until 2000 (GRECO 2014). A large out˝ow of judges limited the 

judiciary™s capacity (Dallara 2014). After the 
war ended, civil society increasingly demanded 
institutional changes, and transparency improved. 
EU accession prospects were instrumental in 
encouraging reforms, though implementation 
gaps remain.
˚e judiciary™s ine˙ciency and poor 
implementation of privatization hindered 
property rights protection. Slow and ine˙cient 

court proceedings, poor case management, and 

low administrative and professional capacity 
were factors that undermined trust in e˛ective 
enforcement of creditors™ and property rights. 

Privatization, which mostly took place in the 
1990s, at times involved appointing new managers 
close to the ruling party, a trend that discouraged 
foreign investors and concentrated resources 
(Bartlett 2007).
˚e power of civil society groups increased and 
transparency improved starting in the late 1990s, 
catalyzing reforms (Figure
 2.13). With the end 
of the war, and despite the unfavorable initial 

conditions, civil society gained some strength. 
˚e Croatian Judges Association became more 
critical of government actions and recorded 
signi˜cant victories against SJC rulings (Dallara

2014). In the late 1990s, the ˜rst public survey 
conducted regarding the Croatian judiciary 
highlighted the long duration of proceedings and 
case backlogs, helping to build reform momentum 

(Dallara 2014). 
EU accession prospects and membership in several 
CoE bodies incentivized reforms.
 ˚e government 
that took o˙ce in 2000 embarked on major 

reforms, including judicial reform. ˚e signing 
of the association agreement with the European 
Union followed in 2001 (Figure
 2.14). After 
2000, the appointment procedures for judges 
were radically modi˜ed, providing limitations on 
political appointments (Dallara 2007). ˚e main 

measures aimed at reducing political interference 
and making SJC membership incompatible with being chief justice. Other provisions gave the 

Constitutional Court broader powers to appeal 
SJC decisions. ˚e process of EU accession was instrumental 
in advancing judicial reforms (Figure
 2.15). 
Croatia adopted the ˜rst Justice System Reform 
Strategy in 2005 and implemented one of the 
best rationalization reforms for the territorial 
reorganization of courts, achieving a 50
 percent 
reduction in backlogged cases (Madir 2011; 

Carnevali 2013). In 2008, Croatia adopted a 
revised Justice System Reform Strategy that 
broadened justice reform as a prerequisite for 

continuing negotiations with the European 
Union. In 2010, the constitution was amended 

to strengthen judicial independence and 
reduce political interference in the SJC. 
Also, new selection procedures based on 

veri˜ed quali˜cations were introduced for the 
appointment of judges and prosecutors, limiting 
the Justice Ministry™s power and increasing the 

autonomy of the SJC and the State Prosecutorial 
Council. In 2010, a new strategy was adopted for 
the period until 2015 as a requirement for closing

negotiations with the European Union. Due 
to a challenging political environment, initially 
the Croatian government™s cooperation with the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 

Yugoslavia (ICTY) was erratic, despite this being 
a condition of European Union membership 
(Rajkovic 2012; Menz 2013). By 2013, however, 

Croatia complied, which was deemed a major step 
in judicial reform progress, paving the way to its 
joining the European Union. 
By 2008, the EC deemed the protection of 
property rights to be generally assured, but 
enforcement to be weak. While the legal system 
put heavy emphasis on the rule of law, in practice, 

legal certainty was often limited. Regulations 
were sometimes inconsistent, and administrative 
bodies frequently lacked legal expertise. ˚us, 
executive ordinances did not always comply with 
the original legal mandate. As a result, citizens 

and companies often lacked con˜dence in administrative procedures and frequently perceived 
acts of administrative bodies as arbitrary (Bartlett, 

Bnker, and Petak 2014). Reported threats and 
harm to prosecutors also undermined judicial 

independence (CoE 2016).SerbiaSerbia™s institution-building path was uneven, 

as lingering e˛ects of civil strife adversely 
a˛ected domestic factors and relations with 
the European Union, weakening its role as an 
external anchor. ˚e limited progress in judicial 
independence achieved after the fall of President 

Slobodan Meforms 
were stop-and-go, probably owing to increased 
concentration of resources related to ˝awed 

privatization and limited progress on transparency 
(Figure
 2.16).After the war, improving the e˛ectiveness of the 
justice system became a priority as part of the 
broader reform agenda and possible EU accession 

(Figure
 2.17). ˚e e˙ciency of the judiciary had 
been undermined by an uneven workload between 
urban and rural courts, case backlogs, and the lack 

of a free legal aid system (EC 2016b). Political

of judges was common (Dallara 2014). When 
reforms started, about half of active judges were 
dismissed. In 2001, a temporary government 
embarked on overhauling legislation and strongly 
encouraged judges in important positions to 

resign. But because of the lack of su˙cient 
candidates to ˜ll positions, this measure had a 
limited e˛ect compared with that in other CESEE 

countries (Pavlovic 2003). 
Various domestic players continued to resist 
judicial reforms, though increased transparency 
helped achieve some progress. In 2001, several 
laws were enacted to provide a legal basis for the 
operation of general and specialized courts and 
prosecutors™ o˙ces, and for professional freedoms 

and guarantees for judges and public prosecutors 
(OSCE 2011). ˚e introduction of a self-governed 
body responsible for recruiting and selecting 

magistrates was a major change. However, its 

establishment was delayed when the National 
Assembly attempted to amend the bill to control 
nominations. Under pressure from civil society, 

freedom of information improved, which appeared 
to promote more rules-based systems.
Increased cooperation with the European Union 
succeeded in advancing judicial reforms in the 
early and mid-2000s, the period that saw the greatest improvement. In 2001, the European 

Union launched the Stabilization and Association 

Process with Serbia and identi˜ed the country as 
a potential EU candidate in 2003 (Figure
 2.18). Cooperation with the European Union helped 

overcome political resistance to judicial reforms, 
particularly concerning the self-governing body 
(Dallara 2014). With the new 2006 constitution 
approved, a new wave of judicial reforms 
established the self-governing High Judicial 

Council and reformed the State Prosecution 
Council (GRECO 2015a). ˚ese steps led to a considerable improvement in perceived judicial 

independence in 2005Œ07.However, reforms stalled, re˝ecting continued 
power struggles and a deteriorating relationship 
with the European Union as a consequence of 
lingering e˛ects of the war. In 2006, the European 

Union suspended negotiations with Serbia due to 
lack of collaboration with the ICTY. A distinct 

antireform alliance formed between judges 
worried about losing their jobs and political parties seeking to maintain e˛ective control over 

the judiciary (Begoiber 2006). ˚e 
lack of further progress on transparency and 
accountability, and considerable deterioration 
in income inequality, may have supported the 
formation of this alliance. Serbia™s 2005 Gini 

coe˙cient was 5 percentage points higher than 
in 2000. Moreover, privatization was hasty, and 
special groups, some connected to the ruling party, 
received special treatment and protection for 
their ˜rms (Raduloragutino

Domestic business elites utilized their connections 
with politicians to preserve and even tighten 
barriers to entry (Pesic 2007; Bego

˚e independence of self-governing bodies was 

hampered by the selection of the High Judicial 
Council members by the National Assembly 
instead of by peers (GRECO 2015a). ˚e country 

still faces important challenges in cooperating with

In this environment, the improvement in judicial 
independence and e˙ciency was not sustained, though some progress has been made recently. 
˚e 2009 judicial reforms failed to improve 

judicial e˙ciency (GRECO 2015a). ˚e perceived 
independence of the judiciary deteriorated, and 
by 2010 it was at the level of 2005. ˚e main 

concern was related to the provision requiring 
reappointment of judges, which limited judges™ 
protection against removal and was denounced by 
the CoE (Murret 2010). Despite this criticism, 
in 2009 many judges were dismissed without 

clear criteria and without the right to contest the decision (Dicosola 2012). Closer integration 
with the European Union after 2010 provided 

a new impetus for judicial reforms, and the 
Constitutional Court reversed the 2009 decision 
on reappointment of all judges. Despite the 

improvement, perceived judicial independence in 
2015 did not return to the level achieved in the 
mid-2000s, and trust in the judiciary remained 

limited (GRECO 2014, 2015a). As of 2014, a signi˜cant portion of judges (25
 percent) 
and prosecutors (33
 percent) reported that the 
judiciary was not independent, according to the 
World Bank Judicial Review. Judicial e˙ciency 

also remained troublesome, with disposition time 
some 30 percent higher than in other non-EU 
CESEE countries. ˚e 2016 EC report notes that 
ﬁthe judicial system has reached some level of 
preparation,ﬂ but that further steps are needed to 
tackle its independence (EC 2016b).Bosnia and HerzegovinaBosnia and Herzegovina has made some progress 

in institutional reforms, but its case demonstrates 
that external intervention cannot substitute for a 
domestic reform drive.
 ˚e rigid and decentralized 
structure enshrined by the Dayton Peace 
Agreement has allowed ethnicity-based politics to 

weaken reform e˛orts, including judicial reforms. 
Bosnia and Herzegovina™s current governance 
framework resulted from the 1995 Dayton Peace 

Agreement, which vested most government 
functions in the two semiautonomous entitiesŠthe Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the 

Republika SrpskaŠand established above these 
entities the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
(or ﬁStateﬂ), though with a limited mandate. 
˚e countries guaranteeing the peace settlement installed the O˙ce of the High Representative, 
which has extraordinary power to dismiss 
elected governments and o˙cials. Although this 

architecture has succeeded in maintaining peace 
for a quarter century, it has not helped the country 
develop e˛ective institutions (Figure
 2.19).Judicial reform momentum picked up in the early 
2000s as the O˙ce of the High Representation 

took on a forceful role (Figure
 2.20). With EU

support, it began formally coordinating judicial 
reforms. ˚e entities adopted laws on judicial and 
prosecutorial functions that represented the ˜rst 
major step toward the creation of a harmonized 
legal framework. In 2003, the O˙ce of the High 
Representation introduced procedural laws that 

introduced harmonized country-wide civil and 
criminal procedures (HJPC 2017).
 Mid-decade 
reforms of the state-level judiciary also helped 

strengthen judicial independence. In 2004, the 
entities and the State agreed to establish the 
High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council, an 

independent body with the power to appoint and 
discipline judges and prosecutors. ˚e State-level 
court and prosecutors became functional in 2005 

(OSCE 2017). Early compliance problems with 
the ICTY were overcome in the early 2000s. 
After 2006, judicial reform momentum 
weakened even as the country™s domestic revenue 

mobilization improved and external anchors 
shifted. ˚e international community began to shift away from supporting the direct approach 

of the O˙ce of the High Representative to the 
incentive-driven EU accession process. While

the latter provided long-term incentives for 
institutional reforms, implementation over 
the short term was hampered by Bosnia and 
Herzegovina™s heavily decentralized structure 

and inter-entity tensions. Reforms stalled, and a 
constitutional reform package was defeated in the 
State Parliament in 2007. While discussions to 

reengage on judicial reform subsequently picked 
up, progress on the ground was not as strong as 
that indicated by the index shown in Figure
 2.20, which is based on perceptions.
Despite episodic improvements, judicial 
performance in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains 
weak. ˚e structure of governance is fragmented, 

contributing to judicial ine˛ectiveness. Entity laws 
are not harmonized horizontally, coordination 
among judicial institutions is lacking, and 
governments exercise undue in˝uence on 
judicial budgets (OSCE 2017; CoE 2016). Persistent interethnic squabbles have prevented 

implementation of many Constitutional Court 
decisions (EC 2016c). Courts are slow to issue 
judgments, despite some improvement in the 
clearance rate and disposition time of cases. Because judgments remain unenforced (EBRD 

2017), plainti˛s often reinitiate new lawsuits. 
Judges are perceived as subscribing to legal 
approaches seen as more favorable to political 
parties representing their ethnicity. ˚e quality 
of judgments on economic and ˜nancial cases is often poor; many judges award disproportionate 

compensation without addressing the underlying 
problem. International indicators also re˝ect the 
weaknesses in Bosnia and Herzegovina™s judicial 

system: the overall state of judicial e˛ectiveness 
in the country is poor compared with regional 
peers (European Commission for E˙ciency of 

Justice 2016), and the public™s perception of the 
judiciary is also negative (GRECO 2015b). ˚e 
enforcement of property rights is also weak.
Judicial reforms are back in focus, supported 
by the European Union, but the outcome is 
uncertain. In 2015, the authorities adopted the 
Reform Agenda, which lays out plans to improve 

the rule of law and is supported by Bosnia and 
Herzegovina™s international partners, with the 
European Union in the lead (meaningful progress 

on the agenda is a prerequisite for EU candidate 
status (Figure
 2.21).) ˚e IMF™s Extended Fund 
Facility, approved in 2016, contributes to this 

agenda by aiming to strengthen governance of 
state development banks and SOEs. Box

Evolution of the Effectiveness of CESEE Justice Systems and 
Property Rights Protection˚is section reviews the evolution of judicial 
e˛ectiveness in all the 20 CESEE countries 
covered. We include the rule of law indicator, 
for which data are available starting in the 
1990s; indicators on the judiciary™s e˙ciency, 
independence, and impartiality; and protection 

of property rights, for which data start in the 
2000s. ˚e data show signi˜cant progress as well 
as setbacks over the past two decades, as seen in 

the case studies.10 ˚e average standard deviation 
across indicators from di˛erent sources measuring 
judicial system e˛ectiveness and protection 
of property rights provides an indication of 

whether di˛erent sources of information agree 
(Figure
 2.22). For some countries, the di˛erences 
are relatively small, suggesting that there is broad 
consensus, while for others, indicators from 
10˚e rule of law is a broader indicator, while the judiciary™s e˛ec
-tiveness (including e˙ciency, independence, and impartiality) and 
the protection of property rights are components of the rule of law.
di˛erent sources vary signi˜cantly, suggesting 
greater uncertainty and hence the need for a more 
cautious assessment.CEPEJ data indicate that CESEE EU countries 
perform well in terms of justice system e˙ciency 

compared with the EU15, but there is signi˜cant 
heterogeneity. CEPEJ hard data indicate 
that CESEE EU countries, on average, have 

slightly higher resolution rates compared with 
CESEE non-EU countries, or even the EU15 
(Figure
 2.23). For insolvency cases, however, 

the resolution rate in CESEE non-EU countries 
is signi˜cantly lower than in EU countries. 
Further, substantial variation exists, with the 
Czech Republic and Slovenia at the high end of 
the spectrum and Croatia and Romania at the 
low end. Disposition time data show comparable 
e˙ciency levels in CESEE-EU countries and 

the EU15, with similar variation within the two 

groups. Other e˙ciency indicators presented by 
the EU Justice Scoreboard also point to some 
CESEE EU countries having greater judicial 

e˙ciency than some of the EU15 countries (EC 2017). CESEE non-EU countries have

longer disposition times and hence overall lower 
e˙ciency. 
Despite signi˜cant progress, the CESEE™s 
perceived judicial indicators on average still 
appear weaker than in the EU15. Comparing 
the four indicators presented in Figure
 2.24, the perceived di˛erences between the CESEE and 
the EU15 average are smallest for the rule of law 

and largest for judicial independence. ˚e 2016 Eurobarometer Survey suggests that the perceived 
independence of courts and judges among 

the general public and companies is lower in 
CESEE-EU countries than in the EU15 (though with signi˜cant in-group variations), which is 

attributed to greater interference by governments 
or politicians (Figure
 2.25). ˚is is despite the fact that the EU Justice Scoreboard suggests 

that CESEE-EU countries do not signi˜cantly deviate in terms of de jure safeguards of judicial 
independence from the EU15.
11 Typically, 
11˚e EU Justice Scoreboard provides information on safe
-guards related to the status of judges regarding their appointment, 
evaluation, possible transfer without consent, and potential dis
-
missal (EC 2017b).
CESEE-EU countries perform better than CESEE 
non-EU countries.Cross-country variations are signi˜cant for all 
four indicators, with the best-performing CESEE 
countries perceived to have judicial indicators 
exceeding those of some EU15 countries. 
Importantly, while many CESEE countries are in 
the middle two quartiles of the global distribution 

for the rule of law indicator, 10
 or 11 CESEE countries are in the lower quartile for the other 
three indicators, broadly in line with the case 

study ˜ndings and GRECO™s evaluations. ˚ere 
are also up to three EU15 countries in the lower 
quartile for judicial independence and impartiality, 

in line with GRECO reports that note concerns 
arising especially regarding judicial independence 
and impartiality in over a third of CoE member 

countries (CoE 2015, 2016).Regulatory enforcement in CESEE countries 
seems weaker than de jure indicators suggest. On 
average, the CESEE countries in the study rank 

around the 57th percentile of the rule of law 
index global distribution. However, the region 
ranks lower, around the 48th

the regulatory enforcement index compiled by 
the World Justice Project. ˚is suggests weaker 
performance in regulatory enforcement in CESEE 
countries than the performance in establishing 
the regulatory framework. GRECO (2017) ˜nds 
that while solid legal and institutional foundations 
have been established on paper, in many CESEE 
countries e˛ective implementation is lacking. 
˚e Global Integrity Report also estimates a large 

gap between the regulatory framework and its 
actual implementation in the regionŠon average 
about 30 percentage pointsŠthat is similar to the 

report™s estimates for emerging market economies.
Despite much progress, the pace of improvement 
appears to have slowed or even reversed since the 
global ˜nancial crisis.Ł In general, countries farther behind have 
recorded larger improvements in judicial 

indicators since 2001 (Figure
 2.26).Ł While the perceived rule of law has continued 

to improve in several CESEE countries in 
recent years, in about half of them the pace 
of improvement has slowed or even reversed 
since 2007, as shown in the case studies 
(Figure
 2.27). ˚e evolution is worse for 
the other indicators, especially for judicial impartiality and independence. 
Ł ˚ese ˜ndings are consistent with those of 
other authors highlighting a slowdown or 
reversal of judicial reforms and anticorruption 
e˛orts after EU accession (Mungiu-Pippidi 
2015; EBRD 2013, 2016). Aslund and Djankov (2014) maintain that several of 

Bulgaria™s and Hungary™s reforms have proved 
vulnerable,12 and the EC recently registered 
concern about Poland™s judicial independence.
Main Findings˚is section presents the main ˜ndings from all 
the strands of analysis carried out in this chapter, 
including some econometric evidence. It draws 
from the case studies, the judicial indicators, and 

regressions covering all
 advanced and emerging 
market economies that explore the determinants of 
judicial independence and protection of property 
rights in a global setting. Panel regressions 
were estimated with ˜ve-year, nonoverlapping 

averages using model speci˜cations based on the 
conceptual framework presented earlier in this 
chapter (Box
 2.4).˚is chapter ˜nds empirical support for the 
importance of the distribution of resources and of 

opportunities for strengthening judicial systems 
and the protection of property rights.
Ł From the case studies, countries that managed 
to prevent large increases in inequality 

and the emergence of oligarchic structures 
attained better institutions (see also Guriev 
2017).13 Policies implemented as part

of the transition, such as privatization, 
deregulation, restructuring of SOEs, and 
implementation of competition policies, had a considerable impact on income inequality 
and on preventing the emergence of 
oligarchic structures, a ˜nding that Djankov 
(2014b) also highlights. In particular, the 

way privatization was conducted played a 
signi˜cant role in resource distribution, with 
implications for institutional quality. For 

example, most members of Romania™s elite 
used insider knowledge, political power, 
and control over state resources to solidify 
their control over the economy during 
privatization, resulting in a much higher Gini 

coe˙cient by the late 1990s and contributing 
to considerable resistance to judicial reforms 
command economies likely underestimated the degree of inequality 
due to price controls and shortages.
(Gabanyi 2004). In contrast, Estonia™s 
privatization, which aimed to put assets into 
the hands of those with the incentives and 
skills to use them e˛ectively, combined with 

wide participation across society, appears 
to have been vital for Estonia™s success in 
institution building. In Serbia, members 

of the business elite managed to increase 
their control over resources, undermining 
judicial independence. In Poland and 

Hungary, far-reaching policies to liberalize 
trade and commercial activities succeeded in 
demonopolizing the economy early in the transition, which may have aided judicial 
independence and control of corruption (Slay 

1995).14 But setbacks also occurred in several 
countries, as documented in the case studies 14OECD (2014) notes that more competition results in 
less corruption.

and in the indicators. EBRD (2016) links these to a perceived unfair distribution of 
earlier reform gains, and Aslund and Djankov 
(2014) attribute some of the deterioration 
to the in˝uence of business groups with 
strong ties to the government. In some cases, 
the private sector may also in˝uence the 

independence of the courts directly.
Ł As in several previous empirical studies, the 
econometric work for this chapter ˜nds that 
the Gini coe˙cient has a negative correlation 

with judicial institutions, but is not always statistically signi˜cant. However, a broader 
index of resource distributionŠwhich 
besides income equality also includes equality of access to education and healthcare and 

the distribution of power among di˛erent 
socioeconomic groupsŠhas a more robust 
association with higher independence of the judiciary and better protection of 

property rights.
˚e capacity of the public administration is critical to achieving judicial independence and overall e˛ectiveness. In several countries, for 
example in Kosovo and Poland, rapid changes 
in the legal framework, an increasing number 

of court cases, and opportunities for better-paid 
jobs emerging in the private sector (especially for 
legal, ˜nance, and economist professions) initially 

put pressure on the capacity of the judiciary. In 
almost all the cases studies, the creation of an 
independent, self-governing body responsible for 
recruiting and selecting magistrates helped limit 
political involvement in selecting and disciplining 

judges. While most countries in the case studies 
created, de jure, an independent self-governing 
body, de facto independence varied signi˜cantly

across countries. Ensuring the independence of 
the self-governing body was easier in countries 
such as Estonia that early on managed to replace 
most of the communist-era political appointees in important judiciary positions. However, 

the case studies show that in countries where 
replacement of judges with integrity problems or 
political connections was not comprehensive, an 

antireform alliance formed among judges worried 

about losing their jobs and political parties that 
wanted to keep control over the justice system. 
˚is appears to have been the case in Romania 

and Serbia early in the transition, and it delayed 
the establishment of a de facto independent self-governing body. Where a quali˜ed and 
professional bureaucracy was established, the 
e˛ectiveness of the judiciary was fostered and 

de jure reforms appeared to be implemented 
more successfully. ˚e variable capturing merit-
based procedures to recruit and promote civil 
servants has a robust association with judicial 
independence and property rights protection in 

the regressions.
Transparency and accountability mechanisms 
feature prominently in the case studies, and 
they seem to play a particularly important role 
when the environment is unfavorable to robust 

institutions. Transparency took many forms. For 
example, Estonia™s publishing of formal coalition 
agreements contributed to the continuation of 
reforms despite frequent government changes. 
In Croatia, the publication of results of surveys 

on the judicial system enabled public scrutiny 
and helped catalyze reforms. Romania™s civil 
society organizations used the freedom of 

information legislation adopted during the EU accession process to expose politicians™ dishonest 
behavior, facilitating judicial reforms. In Ukraine, 
legal reforms requiring the identi˜cation of 
ultimate bene˜ciaries made bank owners liable 

for losses from related-party lending. Freedom 
of information gets some support in our 
econometric analysis in line with earlier results 

(IMF 2005; Borner, Bodmer, and Kobler 2004), 
and its marginal impact rises when resource 
distribution or public administration capacity 
are not conducive to robust institutions. ˚ese 
˜ndings echo others™ ˜ndings that transparency, 
especially related to ˜scal issues, including 
public procurement, increases the e˛ectiveness 
of laws that otherwise exist only on paper 
(Mungiu-Pippidi and Dadasov 2017; OECD 

2014). To improve the e˙ciency of the judiciary, 
GRECO recommends transparency in the 
recruitment, promotion, and case assignments 

of judges and in measures of judicial system 

performance.
In line with the literature, openness tends to be 
positively associated with judicial independence 
and protection of property rights. Estonia™s 
experience suggests that substantial reductions 
in trade tari˛s and nontari˛ barriers, elimination 
of export restrictions, and guarantees for equal 
rights for both foreign and domestic investors 
during the privatization process facilitated 

institutional reforms by increasing competition 

and discouraging rent seeking. In Poland, the 
Balcerowicz Plan replaced import restrictions 
and foreign trade monopolies with tari˛s (IMF 

2014), thereby reducing opportunities for 
rent seeking. Foreign ownership of banks also 
fostered competitive credit allocation and limited 
connected lending, for example in Estonia and Poland, strengthening the constituency for 

more rules-based institutions (Poghosyan and 
Poghosyan 2010; Bonin, Hasan, and Wachtel 
2005; Nikiel and Opiela 2002). In the regressions, 
lower barriers to trade and the institutional quality 
of trading partners have a signi˜cant positive 

correlation with judicial independence and the 
protection of property rights.
˚e case studies suggest that the European Union 
and the CoE played di˛erent roles as external 
anchors, depending on the dynamics of domestic 
factors a˛ecting institutional quality. In countries 
like Estonia, with strong domestic fundamentals 
for e˛ective institutions, institutional reforms 

were largely domestically driven and used EU and 
CoE standards as benchmarks. In countries where 
domestic fundamentals were not as conducive to 
e˛ective institutions, such as, Croatia, Romania, 
and Serbia, the European Union and the CoE 

helped overcome political resistance to reforms.

While EU-driven reforms initially were largely 
de jure, they did facilitate improvements in 
domestic fundamentals as well, and ultimately in 
the judiciary™s de facto e˛ectiveness. In Croatia 
and Serbia, incentives from EU accession coupled 

with recommendations by CoE monitoring 
bodies helped establish magistrates™ self-governing 
bodies. However, when the incentives o˛ered by 

the European Union were viewed as unattractive, 

as in Serbia in 2005Œ07, anti-EU political parties 
blocked reforms. For Croatia and Romania, 
EU conditionality was instrumental for the 

adoption of a judicial reform strategy aimed at 
separating the judiciary and the political branches 
of government. Also, the European Union and 
the CoE continue to encourage reforms via, 
for example, the Cooperation and Veri˜cation 

Mechanism for Bulgaria and Romania. Some 
previous studies also support the view that 
the EU ﬁanchorﬂ played a positive role for 
institutional improvement (IMF 2005; EBRD 
2013; Mulas-Granados, Koranchelian, and 

Segura-Ubiergo 2008), though Mungiu-Pippidi 
(2015) warns that the EU impact is limited if reforms are implemented as bureaucratic 

requirements and do not engage civil society 
and change domestic agents™ incentives. In the 
regression, the EU impact is captured via trading 

partners™ institutional quality, which is found to be 
signi˜cant for judicial independence, but not for property rights protection.
Additional noneconomic factors that appear to 
matter for judicial e˛ectiveness and property rights 
protection are
Ł Societal fragmentation: 
In Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia, long 
wars delayed the transition, and societal 

fragmentation sti˝ed judicial reforms. 
Also, fragmentation along rural and urban 
population lines may have complicated 

institutional reforms in Poland and 
contributed to reform reversals in other 
countries. ˚ese results are in line with 
the literature (Guriev 2017). ˚e negative 
association of the old-age dependency 
ratio with institutional quality may re˝ect 
di˙culties in solving collective action 
problems in societies with a large share of 
retirees who may favor the status quo and 
oppose reforms with long-term payo˛s.
15Ł ˜e strength of civil society
, which appears to help judicial reforms, as illustrated in 
Estonia, Poland, and Romania: Some authors 
(Bakolias 2000; Mungiu-Pippidi 2017; 
Rodríguez-Ferreira 2013) argue that civil 
society is critical to supporting e˛ective justice 

systems, for example by fostering public 
debate, increasing awareness, and demanding 
transparency and accountability.
Ł Favoritism in politics,
 which has a strong 

negative link to judicial independence and 

property rights protection in the regressions: 
Clientelism enables some groups to capture 
institutions, as found in the case studies. 
At times, state-owned banks were an 
important conduit of weak governance. 
Ukraine™s experience suggests that high 
levels of corruption and entrenched vested 
interests impede governance and judicial 

reforms. In Poland, instances of corruption 
among the judiciary and members of the 
political elite during 1998Œ2003 coincided 
with the perceived deterioration in judicial 
independence. ˚e power struggles between 
di˛erent groups are deemed a cause for 

the ups and downs in judicial reforms in 
most of the case studies. A 2017 GRECO report attributes implementation gaps in 

many CESEE countries™ legal frameworks to 
remaining corruption and clientelism among 
those who wish to preserve their grip on 
power and the status quo. Surveys such as 
the 2017 EU Justice Scoreboard also point to 

political pressure as one of the main reasons 
for perceived lack of judicial independence.
15Atoyan and others (2016) ˜nd that the exit of young and 
skilled people from the region over the past 20 years (the largest 
economic emigration in modern history as a share of home popu
-
lation) removed a voice that could have been critical for improving 

institutions.68REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE

ConclusionCESEE countries signi˜cantly strengthened the 
e˛ectiveness of judicial systems and property rights 
protection, though achievements varied across 
countries, and progress was not linear. Looking 
ahead, a number of countries aspire to join the 

European Union. For these countries, but also for 
others seeking to improve the e˛ectiveness of their 
judiciary and institutions, the main policy insights 

from the case studies, indicators, and econometric 

analysis are
Ł ˚e importance of distributional factors in 
countries™ success in judicial reforms calls 
for careful examination of the distributional 

impact of policies. ˚e way privatization 
was implemented, as well as the opening up 
of the economy, had a critical bearing on 
whether a few dominant players emerged 
or more balanced economic structures 

prevailed. ˚is had attendant implications 

for judicial e˛ectiveness, especially for 
independence and impartiality. ˚is calls for 
careful consideration of the distributional 

implications of all policies and other drivers of inequality and argues for reforms 
that can help ensure a level playing ˜eld. 
Strong enforcement of competition rules 
and lower trade and entry barriers can 

reduce monopolistic power. Redistributive 
˜scal policies can be another policy lever, 
with attention also given to equality of 
opportunities.
Ł Selecting and promoting public o˙cials 
(judicial and otherwise) strictly on merit and 
strengthening the independence of the civil 
service can improve institutional quality.
Ł Countries™ experiences suggest that better 
transparency and accountability can foster 
reforms. Besides freedom of information 

legislation, economic policies that can 
contribute to transparency include ˜scal 
transparency, accountability on the use of 
public resources, e-government, ˜nancial 

disclosures of public o˙cials, and transparency 
of ownership structures of ˜nancial and 
non˜nancial corporations. ˚e impact 
of transparency and accountability seems 
stronger when other fundamentals were 

not conducive to high institutional quality, 

suggesting that this could be an area that 
presents several entry points for policymakers.
Ł ˚e European Union and the CoE played 
a key role as external anchors, though 
the sustainability of reforms rested more 
on domestic factors. In countries with 

domestically driven reforms, EU and CoE 
legal standards acted as a benchmark for 
high institutional quality. In countries with 

a limited domestic drive for institutional 

reforms, the incentive of EU membership 
helped overcome some political resistance to 
reforms, though setbacks were common. EU 

conditionality helped align domestic legal frameworks to those of the European Union. 
While this generated de jure changes, de 
facto improvements appear to have followed 
a less linear path. Yet in many cases, EU and 

CoE standards facilitated improvements in 
domestic factors conducive to institutional 
reforms. For example, the adoption of 
freedom of information laws enabled civil 
society to be more successful in exposing 

rent-seeking behavior of government o˙cials. 
˚e European Union and the CoE continue 
to play a catalytic role through technical 

assistance and enforcement procedures, 
though their e˛ectiveness after accession may 
be more limited.
Ł IMF-supported program cases also indicated 

that operating on domestic levers can help 
nudge institutional reforms. ˚e IMF can 
enhance its analysis of distributional impacts 
and promote policies that favor a more equal 
distribution of resources and opportunities. 
Its technical assistance can help strengthen 

state capacity in many ways, though other institutions are more active in overall civil 
service reform. ˚e IMF can contribute to 
transparency in many waysŠfor example, 
via comparative analyses, standard setting, 

data, ˜scal and ˜nancial transparency, and 
692. R

anti-money-laundering initiatives, as well as in 
increasing accountability mechanisms.
Ł Many of these factors interacted with each 

other due to important feedback loops, 

suggesting that there can be several entry 
points for policy intervention. ﬁ˚e insight 
that ‚everything matters™ can be both paralyzing 
and empoweringﬂ (˚aler and Sunstein 2009). 
Transparency presents many opportunities for 

nudges to start a virtuous cycle.
˚ese ˜ndings are tentative, and more work is 

needed to understand institutional reforms. Judicial 
e˛ectiveness and property rights protection, as 
well as a host of socioeconomic factors that may 

determine them, are inherently di˙cult to measure 
and assess. Complex political economy interactions a˛ect reforms, making it hard to uncover how 
agreement was reached and maintained. More 
work is needed to understand factors and policies 

that a˛ect the balance of power and increase the 
chances that institutional reforms are undertaken, 
make a di˛erence in practice, and are sustained. 
70REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
International Monetary Fund

E˛ective institutions, which encompass an e˛ective rule of law, play a key role in promoting more equitable 
and sustainable growth. A well-documented stylized fact is that societies with high institutional quality 

tend to be more prosperous. Several authors identify causal e˛ects from institutions to per capita income 

and underscore that di˛erences in institutional quality can explain cross-country variations in economic 

development. ˚e World Bank™s 2017 
World Development Report 
argues that peace, justice, and strong 

institutions (UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16) hold ﬁimportant instrumental value because the 

attainment of the goal will aid in the attainment of all the other SDGs.ﬂ It highlights that ﬁthe achievement of 

all the SDGs will require a solid understanding of governance to enable more e˛ective policies.ﬂ
Institutions foster equitable and sustainable growth through several channels. ˚e main ones include

Ł Ensuring more equal access to opportunitiesŠa level playing ˜eldŠand appropriate rewards to those 
who provide labor, capital, and ideas.
Ł Providing checks and balances that discourage rent-seeking behavior and promote more e˙cient/fairer 

use of public resources and better government services. Checks and balances make decision making less 

dependent on individuals, thereby limiting policies that bene˜t only particular interest groups.
Ł Securing a high level of responsiveness to citizens™ preferences and demands, which is key 

for building public trust in government and institutions, thus facilitating consensus around 

growth-enhancing reforms.
Institutions can a˛ect growth by enhancing commitment and collective action (World Bank 2017). ˚ese 

factors are particularly relevant for investment and e˙ciency. ˚e ˜rst factor, commitment, involves preparing 

an environment where ˜rms and individuals feel secure to invest resources in productive activities. ˚e second 

factor, trust and collective action, pertains to the ability to form partnerships and undertake specialization in 

production and correct potential market failures (World Bank 2017). Recent microeconomic studies provide 

evidence for these mechanisms and highlight how institutions a˛ect factors of production. We focus on the 

following three direct channels, recognizing that they are also interrelated:
Ł Labor: Empirical studies have found a strong e˛ect of weak institutions and governance on the emigration 
of skilled workers (Cooray and Schneider 2016). Similarly, Atoyan and others (2016) argue that better 

institutions hold the promise of retaining and slowing emigration of skilled workers.
Ł Investment:
 In the absence of e˛ective protection of property rights, incentives for investment and 

innovation will be harmed. Micro studies ˜nd that ˜rms that feel more secure from the threat of 

expropriation invest a larger share of their pro˜ts in their business (Johnson and others 2002). 

Institutions also a˛ect foreign direct investment, which in turn a˛ects productivity and technology 

adoption (Bénassy-Quéré, Coupet, and Mayer 2007; Bevan and Estrin 2004).
Ł E˝ciency (total factor productivity):
 ˚e theory predicts that institutions a˛ect innovation and productivity 

through enhanced trust, cooperation, commitment, and contract enforcement (World Bank 2017). 

˚e rule of law is critical, as weaknesses in contract enforcement prevent specialization and optimal 

allocation of labor and capital (North 1990), which sti˝es total factor productivity. Firms and workers are 

hesitant to specialize if they are not sure whether all parties will adhere to the agreed contract. As market 

size grows and products get more complicated, trust, specialization, coordination, and enforcement of 

contracts matter more (Dixit 2007; World Bank 2017). Better contract enforcement helps ˜rms expand 

their pool of suppliers by enhancing trust between unknown parties (Johnson and others 2002).

Institutions also a˛ect intermediate variables that matter for growth, including but not limited to
Ł Government expenditure, revenue, and services: 
For a government to collect taxes needed to provide public 
goods, its citizens must be willing to comply and cooperate. Legitimacy and cooperation are maximized 

if the rule of law is applied consistently, trust is built, and decision-making processes are inclusive (World 

Bank 2017). Weak institutions and governance can lead to forgone tax revenue, larger uno˙cial economy 

size (IMF 2016a), and government™s inability to deliver quality public services (World Bank 2017). 

Studies show that better public investment management institutionsŠtransparent procurement and 

project appraisal processesŠare associated with more e˙cient public infrastructure and higher absorption 

of EU funds (IMF 2016a).Ł Access to credit:
 ˚e strength of the legal system in credit protection and collateral execution a˛ects how 

much ˜nancing creditors are willing to extend (Townsend 1979; Aghion and Bolton 1992; Hart and 

Moore 1994). Similarly, better contract enforcement is associated with higher lending and fewer defaults 

(Bianco and others 2005). In addition, weak debt enforcement and ine˛ective insolvency frameworks 

tend to lower recovery values of problem loans (IMF 2015).
Ł Economic resilience:
 ˚e ability to withstand negative shocks is a˛ected by institutions because they 

govern the quality of policies and their implementation (OECD 2016). Better institutions are associated 

with greater ˜scal policy countercyclicality (Frankel, Vegh, and Vuletin 2013) and with more e˛ective 

monetary policy transmission (Mishra and others 2014). Countries with stronger protection of property 

rights are found to have lower probability of market crashes (Blau 2017). Better policies and institutions 

may enable countries to avoid or withstand episodes of debt distress (Kraay and Nehru 2006; IMF 

2017a).Ł Some credit rating agencies and capital market participants acknowledge the importance of institutions 

and governance for macroeconomic stability and sovereign risk assessment (for example, Standard and 

Poor™s 2011, 2013; Moody™s 2016; Briegel and Bruinshoofd 2016, Bruinshoofd 2016).
Institutions have an important impact on inequality and inclusive growth. Corruption can undermine the 

state™s ability to deliver inclusive economic growth through its adverse e˛ect on macro and ˜nancial stability, 

lower investment, and reduced human capital accumulation and social spending (IMF 2016a, 2017a). 

E˛ective institutions enhance cooperation and trust, making it easier to undertake reforms, collect taxes, and 

provide quality public services, thus helping achieve more sustainable growth (World Bank 2017).
Many cross-country studies suggest a causal relationship from institutions to growth. While it is likely that 
causality runs both ways (Barro 2015), or that some third factor (such as accumulated physical and human 

capital) a˛ects both institutions and growth, several cross-country studies provide evidence that institutions 

matter for long-term growth (Mauro 1995; Hall and Jones 1999; Acemoˆlu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001; 

and Banerjee and Iyer 2005). To overcome the challenge of endogeneity of institutions, these studies focus 

on di˛erences in strength of certain institutionsŠfor example, property rights that were driven by exogenous 

factors such as culture or historical events. Acemoˆlu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001), for example, used 

European mortality rates during colonization as an instrument for current institutions and estimated large 

e˛ects of institutions on income per capita. Nonetheless, disagreements remain. Several papers challenge the 

measurement of institutions (Hoyland, Moene, and Willumsen 2012; Donchev and Ujhelyi 2014) or argue 

that the instruments used to identify causal e˛ects are not appropriate (Docquier 2014). A large body of social 

science literature deals with two-way linkages between economic and political institutions and the sequencing 

of reforms. Changes in state capacity or partial improvement in property rights could jump-start development 

and lead to citizens demanding better institutions (Fukuyama and Levy 2010; Fukuyama 2008).

treaty, and, ˜nally, membership. ˚e process requires the adoption of EU laws and preparations to be able 
to properly apply such laws, known as the Acquis Communautaire. ˚e Acquis is divided into 35
 chapters 
for negotiations between the European Union and candidate states. Each chapter covers a major aspect of 

EU policy, such as free movement of goods, capital, and workers; economic policy; energy; transportation; 

regional and foreign policy; fundamental rights; and the judicial system. Chapter
 23 of the Acquis, Judiciary 

and Fundamental Rights, deals with the judicial system.
˚e Judiciary and Fundamental Rights chapter requires reforming the judicial system to ensure its 
independence and e˙ciency. It promotes the establishment of an independent, e˛ective, and impartial 

judiciary to e˛ectively safeguard the rule of law. In particular, it requires eliminating external in˝uences over 

the judiciary, putting in place legal guarantees for fair trial procedures, and providing adequate ˜nancial 

resources and training. Relatedly, members are required to deter and ˜ght corruption e˛ectively, since 

corruption represents a threat to the rule of law.
Speci˜c benchmarks guide transposing the chapter on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights into local law 
and the country™s institutional setup. For most chapters, the European Union sets what are called closing 

benchmarks, which need to be ful˜lled by adopting laws and putting in place institutions. ˚ese benchmarks 

fall into two interlinked categories: (1) independence, accountability, and transparency of the judicial system 

and protection of property rights; and (2) ˜ghting high-level corruption. Some recommended actions include 

establishing a judicial inspectorate to monitor the integrity of the judicial system and follow up on complaints; 

legal provisions for independent sta˙ng of the inspectorate; random assignment of judicial cases to reduce 

political in˝uence; and merit-based guidelines for the progression of judicial sta˛. Some recommended 

actions related to the prevention of high-level corruption include (1) establishing a specialized institution for 

the prosecution of high-level corruption; (2) independent sta˙ng of such an institution; (3) creating legal 

provisions for whistle-blowers; (4) implementing a system to verify asset declarations of public o˙cials; (5) 

investigating inexplicable wealth; and (6) publishing statistics on investigation and conviction cases.
˚e process of reforming the judiciary in line with the chapter on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights could 
extend well beyond EU accession. Creating and maintaining an independent and impartial judiciary and 

administration is a long-term process. For this reason, the European Commission allows some of the required 

actions to take place after accession by setting interim benchmarks and through continuous monitoring and 

progress reports. For example, a Cooperation and Veri˜cation Mechanism has been in place in Bulgaria and 

Romania to monitor and guide reforms of the judicial system and ˜ght corruption after those countries joined 

the European Union in 2007. As European Commission reports indicate, despite progress, e˛orts are still 

needed to demonstrate a track record, ˜nalize the adoption of legal codes, and ensure the implementation of 

court decisions in these countries.
˚e European Union also has a framework aimed at respecting and strengthening the rule of law in all 
its members. If the mechanisms established to secure the rule of law at the national level cease to operate 

e˛ectively, there is a systemic threat to the rule of law and, hence, to the functioning of the European Union 

(EC 2010). In such situations, the European Commission can act to protect the rule of law by launching 

infringement procedures and activating Article 7 of the Treaty of the European Union. Given, however, 

the very high thresholds for activating Article 7, a new framework aimed at preventing the emergence of a 

systemic threat to the rule of law was enacted in 2014 (EC 2014).

˚is box focuses on speci˜c reforms in Kosovo and Ukraine in the context of IMF-supported programs. ˚e 
reforms have a narrower focusŠcontrol of corruption in Ukraine and clearing court backlogs in Kosovo. 

˚eir experiences highlight the di˙culty in making progress in judicial reforms and the need to learn by doing 

and adapting to the local context. External actors have the strongest impact when they support domestic 

reform actors.
Ukraine
Corruption and oligarchic structures thwart improvements in the rule of law in Ukraine. Multiple data 
sources suggest that corruption is more prevalent in Ukraine than in other countries of Central, Eastern, and 

Southeastern Europe (CESSEE)
 or the European Union (EU) (IMF 2017b). Less-active civil society groups, 

˝awed and minimal privatization, and weak initial reform strategies are often cited as reasons for the lack 

of progress (Yemelianova 2010; Valdai Discussion Club 2014). Vested interests continue to resist reform, 

and political fragmentation makes progress more challenging, but civil society is currently quite active and 

gathering support and is calling attention to corruption.
˚e IMF-supported program in Ukraine focuses on tackling corruption. Reforms have included (1) the 
independent National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), (2) comprehensive asset declarations 

for high-level o˙cials, and (3)
 a business ombudsman. Over 85
 cases have been sent to court by the NABU, 

˜nancial assets have been seized, and prominent ˜gures have been arrested. However, there have been no 

major convictions yet. ˚e program includes policies to reduce opportunities for corruption by streamlining 

business licenses, improving public procurement, bringing energy prices to import parity, overhauling tax 

administration, cleaning up the banking system, and putting in place an e˛ective anti-money-laundering 

framework. But additional e˛orts are needed to address the perception of impunity.
Progress in the reform of state-owned enterprises has been limited, although progress has been made in 
the banking sector. Weak governance of state-owned enterprises has led to ine˙ciencies and corruption. 

Amendments to the privatization law were adopted in January 2016, but no large state-owned enterprises 

have been privatized. A new law on governance of these enterprises requires independent supervisory boards 

and adequate auditing principles. Ukraine has oligarch-owned banks, which use deposits to fund dubious 

related-party transactions (Baum and others 2008). Weaknesses in the rule of law and supervisory powers 

made it di˙cult to e˛ectively control the banks, which allowed some owners to earn ˜ctitious pro˜ts at the 

expense of taxpayers and depositors. A break came in 2014Œ15, when reform-oriented management was 

appointed at the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), which saw its independence and powers strengthened 

(due in part to prior actions under the IMF Extended Fund Facility). Legal reforms required the identi˜cation 

of ultimate bene˜ciary owners, made bank owners liable for related-party lending losses, and shifted the 

burden of proof from the NBU to the banks. ˚e NBU has closed nearly 90 of 180 banks since 2014, and the 

largest private bank was recently nationalized, but ˜rmer e˛orts to collect related-party loans are needed.
Kosovo
Although Kosovo has a short history with institution-building, some progress has been made in improving 
the court system. ˚e most recent IMF-supported program emphasized Kosovo™s ine˙cient court system 

as a major impediment to bank lending and growth. Kosovo™s courts had large case backlogs due to low 

institutional capacity, weak management, and poor incentives. Creditors could not e˙ciently obtain and 

enforce judgments and hence required more collateral and higher lending rates

˚e authorities decided to confront the backlog of open 
cases (Figure
 2.3.1). With help from the US Agency for 

International Development, the authorities (1)
 introduced 

a system of private enforcement agents that helped 

creditors enforce court judgments and recover assets 

and reduced the burden on courts; (2)
 established a 
centralized registry of bank account holders at the Central 

Bank of Kosovo, which enables the private enforcement 

agents to garnish accounts; and (3) improved court case 

resolution procedures. A large reduction in court cases was 

achieved. In parallel, private enforcement agents resolved 

numerous
 cases and recovered millions of dollars in assets. 

˚e progress in contract enforcement likely contributed to 

the sharp recent decline in lending rates. However, there 

are remaining gaps in judicial e˛ectiveness, as debtors can 

sometimes sidestep enforcement actions.

We estimate panel regressions with ˜ve-year nonoverlapping averages with time dummies and random e˛ects, 
conduct robustness checks, and attempt to mitigate endogeneity.
Dependent Variables
˚e main variables are judicial independence and protection of property rights indices from the World 
Economic Forum (WEF). For robustness, we also use the protection of property rights index from the 

Heritage Foundation and an indicator of court impartiality based on WEF data.
Explanatory Variables
To capture power asymmetries owing to the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities, we employ 
a composite indicator of resource distribution encompassing socioeconomic groups, education, health, and 

gender, with some of these aspects regressed separately as well. Also, we use indicators of market dominance, 

natural resource availability, and corruption in politicsŠthe latter re˝ecting the prevalence of favoritism in 

politics. For the ability to solve collective action problems, we use the press freedom index, several measures 

of transparency and accountability, the old-age dependency ratio, and the urbanization rate. State capacity 

is represented by the variable covering the extent of established rules and procedures to hire and train 

government employees. We include trade barriers and trading partners™ institutional quality to analyze the role 

of external factors. We control for GDP per capita. ˚e sample includes 26 advanced and 53 emerging market 

economies from 1990 to 2014.
˚e baseline econometric analysis provides support for some variables capturing power asymmetries, 
transparency, state capacity, and openness, as well as noneconomic factors (Table
 2.4.1). We identify a 

positive association between institutional quality and more equal distribution of resources, higher information 

freedom, state capacity, lower trade barriers, trading partners™ institutional quality, and less corruption in 

politics. Another relatively new factor that seems to matter is the old-age dependency ratio, which is negatively 

associated with institutional quality.
1 Perhaps this captures the higher demand for checks and balances in 
societies with a larger share of working-age population. Gorodnichenko and Roland (2011) emphasize 

that attitudes in societies change slowly due to culture. ˚ese ˜ndings are broadly in line with the more 

recent literature, which ˜nds that many factors contribute to institutional quality (see EBRD 2013; Ganiou 

Mijiyawa 2013).
Some interaction terms between the explanatory variables matter. ˚e positive impact of information freedom 
is larger when the quality of public administration is low, resources are more concentrated, or the level of 

GDP per capita is lower. ˚is suggests that when resource distribution or public administration capacity is not 

conducive to strengthening institutions, the marginal impact of checks and balances imposed by information 

freedom on politicians and government o˙cials rises.
˚e baseline results are fairly robust to various model speci˜cations and alternative measures (see Annex
 2.3). Market dominance indicators are strongly associated with both judicial independence and property rights 

protection, but their presence eliminates the signi˜cance of trade barriers. ˚is is possibly because market 

power indicators and openness operate through the common channel of competition.
Alternative measures for property rights protection, resource distribution, trade openness, and transparency 
and accountability do not alter the results materially. Some measures of transparency and accountability,

while having the expected sign, are not statistically signi˜cant. We could not identify a statistically signi˜cant 
correlation with the urbanization rate and educational attainment (though education opportunities are 

included in the composite indicator of resources and opportunities distribution). Dropping variables that 

might be considered as institutions themselvesŠcorruption in politics, state capacity, and transparency and 

accountabilityŠmaintains the signi˜cance of variables capturing power asymmetries and openness.
Caveats abound, given di˙culties in assessing the e˛ectiveness of judicial systems and protection of property 
rights and the feedback loops between these institutions and their potential determinants. While we have used 

the instrumental variable approach by including lagged variables to mitigate the potential reverse causality 

between institutional quality and economic performance, some residual endogeneity bias is likely to remain. 

Cross-sectional regressions, however, broadly con˜rm the panel results. Controlling for GDP per capita 

addresses concerns that some of the identi˜ed associations might re˝ect the impact of better institutions on 

the explanatory variables through high income. However, other factors not included in our regressions may 

drive both the dependent and explanatory variables.

Annex 2.1. Institutions: Literature ReviewAnnex Table 2.1.1. Summary of the Theoretical Literature on Institutions
Theory
DescriptionReferencesEconomic:Efficient institutionsSocieties choose efficient economic institutions that facilitate the maximization of the income 

of society as a whole. 
However, the distribution of the resulting income is independent of the 

distribution of political power. If the existing economic institutions in a country penalize some 

groups and benefit others, the two groups can engage in negotiations to modify the existing 

institutions or to create new institutions. This would produce beneficial outcomes for all. 

Institutions are therefore created when the social benefits of their creation exceed their social 

costs, so the search for efficiency prevents the existence of inefficient economic institutions. 

This is more likely to materialize when the economy is large or expanding.
Coase 1960
Demsetz 1967
Williamson 1985
Grossman and Hart 1986Cultural: 

Ideological beliefs and 
behavior
Institutions are different because of cultural differences. There are three main strands of 

theory. 
First, different societies have different beliefs and behaviors, which shape collective 
action and consequently the quality of governments and institutions. One interpretation is 

that some societies have cultural values favorable to the emergence of efficient institutions, 

while others do not. Another interpretation is that cultural values favoring trust in strangers 

serve to facilitate collective action and increase the supply of public goods, including 

efficient economic institutions. 
Yet another interpretation is that cultural values that incite 
intolerance, xenophobia, and closed-mindedness hinder economic development and the 

emergence of efficient institutions. 
Second, countries choose their economic institutions 

based on that society™s conception of what is most beneficial for its citizens. 
Since societies 
do not have the same concept of what is ﬁgoodﬂ for their members, economic institutions 

vary from country to country. This difference is reinforced by the uncertainties about the ex 

ante knowledge of what constitutes a ﬁgoodﬂ economic institution. Third, in societies whose 

primary social institutions legitimize individuals™ expression of their own preferences and 

emphasize the moral equality of individuals, more specific norms of governance are expected 

to promote legal entitlements, authority undistorted by bribes, and feedback mechanisms of 

accountability. Cultural differences are expected to be reflected by religious affiliation and 

cultural profiles of nations.

Williamson 2000
Roland 2004
Licht and others 2007Historical: 
 Past events
Institutions are the consequences of historical events. These events occur at a certain 

point in time, which subsequently determines the nature of institutions and makes them 

persist over time. There are two main strands of thought here. 
First, class coalitions and 
the way agriculture is organized determine which political institutions will emerge, although 

organization of agriculture is not predetermined to influence political institutions, and these 

institutions are just an unintended consequence. 
Second, the organization of a country™s 

legal system is the result of historical circumstances. More specifically, legal origins have 

an important impact on the quality of property rights protection, which in turn determines 

institutions. 
Moore 1966
Glaeser and Shleifer 2002Political economy: 

Social conflictInstitutions are not chosen by all members of society, but rather by a group of individuals 

who control political power at a given point in time. The dominance of the group holding 

political power is the result of social conflict, and this group will therefore set up institutions 

that maximize personal payoffs, regardless of whether this will increase the income of the 

society as a whole. Two main strands dominate here. 
First, individuals who control political 
power as economic agents pursue their personal interests. Transaction costs associated with 

monitoring and verifying the agents™ behavior generate a gap between the institutions chosen 

by policymakers for the maximization of their personal payoffs and the institutions that 

maximize the income of the society as a whole. 
Second, economic institutions determine 

not only the level of income, but also income distribution. Consequently, the existence of 

individuals who do not benefit equally from institutions may result in divergent individual 
preferences pertaining to institutions. Institutions should therefore be considered endogenous 

because they depend on political power, which in turn is endogenous as it depends on de jure 

political power conferred by political institutions and de facto political power conferred by the 

distribution of resources.North 1981

State capacity
This theory claims that in many countries state capacity is not sufficient to adopt and 

implement economic institutions consistent with best practices that support an efficient 

functioning of markets. The argument is that policy choices in market regulation 

(including˚property rights) and taxation are constrained by past investments in legal and fiscal 

capacity.

Annex Table 2.1.3. Institutions and Economic Outcomes
Economic OutcomesEvidenceStudiesSustainable and inclusive 
growth
Institutions matter for long-term growth and help achieve growth that is 

more sustainable and inclusive. Effective institutions, which encompass 

effective rule of law, ensure a level playing field and provide checks and 

balances. The latter discourages rent-seeking behavior and promotes more 

efficient and fairer use of resources. Within the rule of law, the effectiveness 

of the justice system and protection of property rights are critical functions 
for economic outcomes.Mauro 1995

Growth via factors of 

productionInstitutions can affect growth via the factors of production by enhancing 

commitment, that is, by creating an environment where economic agents 

feel secure to invest in productive activities. By enhancing trust, contract 

enforcement, and collective action, institutions promote partnerships, 

specialization in production, and the solving of market failures. 
Labor: Weak institutions and governance have a strong effect on the 
emigration of skilled workers. Better institutions hold the promise of 

retaining and slowing emigration of skilled workers.
Investment: Firms that feel more secure from expropriation invest a larger 
share of their profits in their business. A well-functioning, independent, and 
impartial judicial system improves foreign direct investment, the availability 

and cost of credit, investment, and growth.
Efficiency (total factor productivityŠTFP):
 Weaknesses in contract enforcement 
prevent specialization and optimal allocation of labor and capital, hence 

hampering T
FP. Better contract enforcement can help firms expand their pool of 

suppliers by enhancing trust and cooperation between unknown parties.

Cooray and Schneider 2016Growth via intermediate 

factorsInstitutions also affect a host of intermediate factors that ultimately matter 

for growth, including but not limited to
Government finances: Institutions help government tax collection efforts by ensuring compliance and cooperation from citizens. Weak institutions and 

governance can lead to forgone tax revenue, a larger informal economy, 

and the inability of government to deliver quality public services. Better 

institutions, particularly in the areas of public investment managementŠ

such as transparent procurement and project appraisal processesŠare 

associated with more efficient public infrastructure and higher absorption 

of EU funds.Access to credit: The strength of the legal system in credit protection and 
collateral execution affects how much financing creditors are willing to 

extend to the economy. Better contract enforcement is associated with higher 

lending and fewer defaults. In addition, weak debt enforcement and ineffective 

insolvency frameworks tend to lower recovery values of problem loans.
Economic resilience: Institutions affect the ability of countries to withstand 
negative shocks because those institutions govern the quality of policies and 

their implementation. Better institutions are also associated with greater fiscal 

policy countercyclicality and with more effective monetary policy transmission. 

Countries with stronger protection of property rights have lower probability of 

market crashes. Better policies and institutions may enable countries to avoid 

or withstand debt distress. 
Some credit rating agencies and capital market 

participants acknowledge the importance of institutions and governance for 

macroeconomic stability and sovereign risk assessment.

Causality between growth 

and institutionsEven though causality between growth and institutions likely runs both 

ways, several cross-country studies suggest that institutions matter for 

long-term growth. These studies have used various techniques to establish 

a causal relationship, including instrumental variables, natural experiments, 

and more narrative approaches.
Nonetheless, disagreements remain. 
Several studies challenge the measurement of institutions and instruments used for identifying causal 
effects. A large body of social science literature deals with two-way 

linkages between economic and political institutions, and the dynamics 

of sequencing of reforms from one area to another. 
For example, it is 
argued that changes in state capacity or even partial improvements in 

property rights can jump-start development, which in turn could lead to the 

emergence of a citizen class demanding better institutions.

Governance Indicators˚e Worldwide Governance Indicators draw 
on four di˛erent types of source data: surveys 
of households and ˜rms, including the 
Afrobarometer surveys, the Gallup World Poll, 
and Global Competitiveness Report surveys; 
commercial business information providers, 
including the Economist Intelligence Unit, 
Global Insight, and Political Risk Services; 

nongovernmental organizations, including Global 

Integrity, Freedom House, and Reporters Without 
Borders; and public sector organizations, including 
the Country Policy and Institutional Assessments 

of the World Bank and regional development 
banks, the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development Transition Reports, and 
the French Ministry of Finance Institutional 
Pro˜les Database.
World Economic Forum Global 
Competitiveness Index˚e Global Competitiveness Index is a composite 
index based on data largely obtained from an 
opinion survey asking business executives to 
evaluate aspects of their economy. ˚e survey 
is conducted with the help of a network of 
160 partner institutes that follow detailed 
sampling guidelines to ensure that the sample of 
respondents is the most representative possible 

and comparable. To improve comparability, 4 of 

10 questionnaires are ˜lled out by executives who 
have previously taken part in the survey. O˙cial 
statistics are also used.
World Bank Doing Business Index
˚e Doing Business Index looks at domestic 
small and medium companies and measures the 
regulations applying to them through their life 
cycle. To provide di˛erent perspectives on the 
data, the index presents data both for individual 

indicators and for two aggregate measures: the 
distance to frontier score and the ease of doing 
business ranking. Doing Business uses a simple 

averaging approach for weighting component 

indicators, calculating rankings, and determining the distance to frontier score.
European Commission for the  (Commission CEPEJ)˚e CEPEJ maintains a comprehensive database 
with data on judicial systems of Council of Europe member states for 2010, 2012, and 2014. 
˚e data are based on reports submitted by 

country authorities. Since 2008, the CEPEJ has 
implemented a peer evaluation process for the 
systems for judicial data collection and reporting 

in Council of Europe members. ˚e CEPEJ data 
cover topics such as the budget of judicial systems 
and legal aid, professionals, courts and users, and 
the e˙ciency of the justice system.Group of States Against 
Corruption (GRECO)GRECO™s objective is to improve the capacity 
of its 49 member states to ˜ght corruption by 
monitoring their compliance with the Council of Europe™s anticorruption standards and their 
e˛ective implementation. GRECO uses a 
dynamic process of mutual evaluation and peer 
pressure. Its country-by-country evaluations

Varieties of Democracy 

˚e V-Dem Project is a collaborative international 
e˛ort that unites thousands of social scientists 
working in the sphere of democracy and 

governance. It is coordinated by the University of 
Gothenburg™s V-Dem Institute and the University 
of Notre Dame™s Kellogg Institute. Approximately 
half of the indicators in the V-Dem data set are 
based on factual information obtainable from 

o˙cial documents such as constitutions and 
government records. ˚e other half consists of 
more subjective assessments on topics like political 
practices and compliance with de jure rules. On 

such issues, typically, ˜ve experts per country 
provide ratings. ˚ese experts are generally 
academics or professionals working in government, 

media, or public a˛airs. ˚ey are also generally 
nationals of and/or residents in the country and 
have documented knowledge of both that country 
and a speci˜c substantive area.
International Country Risk Guide (ICRG)˚e ICRG provides ratings based on indicators 
for countries that forecast political, ˜nancial, and 
economic risk. A separate index is created for each 
of the subcategories. ˚is data set is produced 
by the PRS Group of Syracuse, New York. 

Political risk assessments are based on a compiler™s 
judgement, while ˜nancial and economic ratings are based on macro-˜nancial data. Weights 

assigned to each variable and subcategory are 

predetermined and identical for every country.

Annex 2.3. Econometric Analysis: Additional Results
˚is annex presents three sets of robustness checks. 
First, some of the explanatory variables that could 
be considered measures of institutional quality 
themselves are removed from the regressions. 
Second, we examine additional variables, such as 

market dominance. Finally, we attempt to address 
endogeneity issues.Following Acemoˆlu and others (2003), who 
argue that historically determined components of institutions are slow-moving and can be 

considered exogenous, we do not include 
individual e˛ects. ˚e Breusch-Pagan test is 
employed to determine whether random e˛ects 

should be included, with results broadly in favor 
of random e˛ects. ˚is serves as a benchmark for 
robustness checks.
Some of the explanatory variables in the baseline 
regressionsŠfreedom of the press, impartiality 

of public administration, and corruption in 
politicsŠcould also be considered as measures 
of institutional quality themselves. To address 
this concern, we remove each of these, one by 
one and all of them at the same time, from the 

set of explanatory variables, and reestimate the 
model. Variables capturing power asymmetries and 
openness remain signi˜cant (Annex Table
 2.3.1). We also continue to ˜nd a statistically signi˜cant 
association with institutional quality of 
trading partners, old-age dependency, and per 

capita income.We tried adding corporate market dominance, 
as it could be a source of power asymmetries. 
Hence, excluding this measure could result in 
an omitted variable bias. We ˜nd a positive and 
signi˜cant association between market dominance 

and judicial independence and property rights 
protection (Annex Table
 2.3.2). However, when 
openness and corporate market dominance 
are jointly included, openness is not always 
statistically signi˜cant, though the signs are as 

expected. ˚is likely re˝ects the fact that openness 
a˛ects competition, as does market dominance.
Finally, we try to mitigate endogeneity concerns 
by using lags of variables as instruments in 
a generalized methods of moments (GMM) 
framework. Since including lags of variables 
as instruments may not satisfactorily address 

endogeneity, we also try cross-sectional regressions, 
and regress the most recent ˜ve-year period for the 
dependent variables on longer lags (average over 

1990Œ2000) of explanatory variables. We ˜nd that 
measures of resource distribution, openness, and 
the old-age dependency ratio remain associated 

with the expected sign with judicial independence and protection of property rights, even though 
they are not always statistically signi˜cant (Annex 
Table
 2.3.3). Other explanatory variables (for 
example, impartiality of public administration 

and transparency) have the expected sign as in the 
baseline in most alternative speci˜cations, but lose 
signi˜cance.86REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE

Income
 convergence in the Western Balkans 
has stalled at low levels.
1 Measured in 
purchasing-power-parity (PPP) terms, income 

levels in the region today are less than 30
 percent 
what they are in the euro area (Figure
 3.1). Equally 

noteworthy, the ratio has not changed since 2008. 
˜is is in sharp contrast to the experience of the New Member States of the European Union (EU), 
where relative incomes have continued to grow 
strongly since the global ˚nancial crisis and are 

now at nearly two-thirds those of the euro area. 
˜ere are many reasons for this disappointing 
performance,
2 including an un˚nished transition, exempli˚ed in some countries by a large swath of 
ine˛cient state-owned enterprises; shortcomings 
in the rule of law and the business environment; 
limited human capital, exacerbated in some countries by signi˚cant emigration of quali˚ed 

human resources, or ﬁbrain drainﬂ; and scant 
and poor-quality public infrastructure. While 
acknowledging these issues, this chapter focuses 

on another important plank for the region™s 
development: the health of its banking sectors. 
Implicit is the assumption that, even if reforms in 

the other areas bring about high-quality bankable 
projects, their potential, and with it overall 
economic growth, will not be fully realized if 

banks are not in a good position to fund them. 
In many ways, banks in the region are still reeling 
from the e˝ects of a boom-and-bust cycle that was 
as severe as it was in other parts of Eastern Europe. 

In the precrisis boom years, most countries in the 
Western Balkans saw foreign parent banks ˚nance

and fuel a credit boom that boosted growth but 
also contributed to rising imbalances. When the 
global ˚nancial crisis broke, this foreign funding 
suddenly stopped, and the boom ended. ˜e result 
was a pronounced slowdown in GDP growth, a 
large increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs), and 

a sharp drop in pro˚tability.
˜is legacy is constraining credit growth at a time 
when credit is most needed.
 In most countries in 
the region, credit-to-GDP ratios are still below the 
levels predicted by fundamentals. Boosting credit 

penetration thus appears necessary to reinvigorate 
income convergence. Unfortunately, credit growth 
remains timid, despite a modest improvement in 
recent years, and the factors holding it back are 
unlikely to be resolved soon:

stabilized, and further contractions cannot

prospects in the region, and many of them 
are following global trends toward self-funded 
subsidiaries. In addition, some parent banks of 
important subsidiaries in the Western Balkans 
have themselves faced stress in the past, 

while others remain vulnerable. In addition, 
restructuring plans by Greek banks submitted 
as part of the EU-led bailout envisage a 

signi˚cant scaling back of their activities in 
the Western Balkans, and some Greek banks 
have in fact started to sell their subsidiaries 
in the region. Also, global and EU regulatory 

changes are having signi˚cant indirect e˝ects 
on Western Balkan banking systems via the 
dominance of foreign subsidiaries. ˜e region™s 
banks have been successful in attracting 
deposits since the crisis, but it remains to be 

seen whether in a region of historically low 
savings deposits alone will su˛ce to propel 
credit penetration forward. Meanwhile, 
fresh capital from non-EU groups has been 
limited, not least because they see that some 
countries already have too many banks, 
limiting the upside.Ł High levels of nonperforming loans and impaired 

pro˚tability: 
NPLs are gradually declining, 
and pro˚tability is increasing. Yet in many 

countries NPLs are still at levels that are far 
from healthy. Econometric analysis in this 
chapter shows that weakened balance sheets 
are a large, negative damper on credit growth. 
Further analysis shows that, in the absence 

of forceful policy action, it will take a long 
time to repair balance sheets via the ongoing 
macro recoveries.
Ł Structural nonbank factors:
 Weak bankruptcy 

and insolvency regimes in some countries 

are perpetuating the debt overhang, with 
knock-on e˝ects on banks. Uncertain property 
rights mean that a range of assets cannot be 
easily collateralized, while weak judiciaries 
make banks wary of lending for fear that debts 
will not be recovered.
In this setting, policymakers are advised to take 

a range of policy actions to speed up the healing of the banking system and mitigate risks. ˜ese actions include strengthening balance sheets, 
expanding funding bases, and tackling nonbank structural obstacles to credit. Speci˚cally:
Ł Elevated levels of nonperforming loans in most 
of the Western Balkans require a multipronged 
policy response.
 Comprehensive asset quality 
reviews, as done in Serbia, would help 
shed an honest light on both the scale of impaired assets and the adequacy of banks™ 

provisions. ˜ese reviews should be followed 
by a requirement that vulnerable banks draft 
time-bound remedial action plans that are 
supervised. Country authorities should also 
take steps to reduce impediments to NPL 

write-o˝s and facilitate more active markets 
for NPLs and distressed assets.
Ł Expanding funding bases is key. 
Managing 
external deleveraging, including potentially 
disruptive episodes, will be key to maintaining 
adequate funding bases across the region. 
As such, the authorities should remain in 
close communication with parent banks and 

home supervisors. At a minimum, Western 
Balkan supervisors should ensure that banks 
under their authority maintain updated contingency plans for any such event. In 
parallel, it is paramount to implement policy 
measures that help diversify bank funding 

sources and thus reduce dependence on 
external parent funding. Realistically, though, 
the development of local capital markets 

or initiatives that could boost domestic 
savings will take time to bear fruit. Similarly, 
enhancing the attractiveness of the region to 
new banking groups will require that some 
countries face the fact that they already have 

too many banks, which deters the upside perceived by foreign groups.
Ł Addressing weak bankruptcy and insolvency 

regimes, improving cadastral systems, and 
speeding up slow court procedures and 

judgments cannot be sidestepped if the region 
is to realize the full potential of ˚nancial 
intermediation. ˜is chapter proposes 

concrete recommendations in this regard.

The Boom and BustMuch of what ails banks in the region today stems 
from the boom-and-bust cycle of the past 15 years. 
Understanding the cycle as it a˝ected the region™s 
banks is thus key to evaluating future prospects.
While much has been written about the boom and bust in the New Member States of the European 
Union (Bakker and Gulde 2010, Bakker and 
Klingen 2012), much less has been said about the 
equally sharp cycle that gripped Western Balkan 
banking sectors.3 During the precrisis boom years, 
external bank funding across the Western Balkans 
rose by more than 500
 percent or by 20
 percentage 
points of GDP (Figure
 3.2). ˜is regional picture 
masks important variations across countries: 

Montenegro experienced a larger increase than the 
others (by 40
 percent of GDP, one of the largest 
in the world), followed by Serbia and Bosnia 
and Herzegovina. At the other end, the ramp-up 
in funding was less noticeable in Albania and 
Macedonia. When measured in
 percent of GDP, 
the rise in external funding prior to the crisis was 3An important exception is IMF 2015a.
comparable to that in the New Member States and 
double that in Asia and Latin America before their 
famous banking crises (Figure
 3.3). In
 percentage 
terms, the increase in funding was much higher in 

the Western Balkans than in other regions, owing 
to the low starting base.
˜e rise in external funding re˙ected both push 
and pull factors. On the supply side, much of 

the banking system in Southeastern Europe was 
foreign owned (Figure
 3.4), and for the parent 
banks, banking in the Western Balkans was very 

pro˚table. In the region, foreign banks accounted 
for between 70 and 95
 percent of banking sector 
assets before the crisis. In turn, the foreign 

presence was and remains dominated by EU 
banks, which before the crisis accounted for about 

90 percent of total foreign banks by assets.
4 On 
the demand side, credit penetration in the region 
was low, and pent-up demand high. 
˜e large expansion of funding led to a big jump in credit penetration.
 Across the region, 
credit-to-GDP ratios increased by an average of

30 percentage points of GDP in the 2000s up to 
the crisis, ranging from 20
 percentage points in 
Serbia to 70
 percentage points in Montenegro, 
one of the largest jumps in the world (Figure
 3.5). 
Consistent with the push from parent funding, 
foreign banks increased credit faster than domestic 
banks (Figure
 3.6). Adding to ˚nancial stability 

concerns, a large proportion of credit was in 
foreign currency (IMF 2016). In ˙ow terms, 
this credit expansion bene˚ted households most, 
although on a stock basis corporate loans still dominated banks™ books (Figure 3.7). 
˜e credit boom contributed to rapid growth 
(Figure
 3.8), but also led to rising imbalances. 
Between 2003 and 2008, current account de˚cits 
increased most sharply in Montenegro and Serbia, 
followed by Albania and Macedonia (Figure
 3.9). 
By 2008, the current account de˚cit in all Western 
Balkan countries was in double digits. 
As in other regions, the onset of the global 
˚nancial crisis brought about a reversal in external 

funding, though less severe than elsewhere. 
˜e decline in external funding averaged 
about 8 percentage points of GDP across the 
region, ranging from almost no change or even 

a slight increase in Albania and Macedonia 

to a 20 percentage point of GDP decline in 
Montenegro (Figure

itself was signi˚cantly less sharp than in the New

Member States during the same period. It was also 
less severe than in Asia and Latin America during 
their respective crises (Figure
 3.11). ˜is is partly 
because banks in the region were not particularly 
highly leveraged despite the sharp run-up in credit, 
because the starting level was low. For instance, 

loan-to-deposit ratios were below 100
 percent in 
all countries but Montenegro (and in the case of 
Albania and Kosovo, well below). Montenegro 

had a loan-to-deposit ratio of 147 percent in 
2008, comparable to such ratios in the Baltics, 
and consequently su˝ered the largest external 

deleveraging. 
˜e sudden stop in external funding, the increase 
in global uncertainty, and lower external demand 
led to a sharp decline in growth,
 which fell by an
 average of 4½
 percentage points in the aftermath 
of the crisis. With credit hit both from the funding 

(supply) side as well as from lower demand, 

credit growth went from about 30
 percent before 
the crisis to about zero after, closely mirroring 
developments in the New Member States 

(Figure
 3.12). Not surprisingly, the country with 
the biggest run-up during the leveraging episode 
(Montenegro) su˝ered the largest crash in terms of 
credit (and GDP) growth (Figure 3.13). But credit 
growth fell by more than 15
 percentage points 
in every country in the region, with EU-owned 
banks experiencing the sharpest falls, as expected (Figure
 3.14). And just as household credit

outpaced credit to ˚rms during the boom, it also 
su˝ered the biggest slowdown.
5 Credit growth 
has since picked up a bit from its trough, but it 
remains well below precrisis levels.
˜e feedback loops between the ˚nancial sector 
and the overall economy crystallized in a sharp 
increase in NPLs and a decline in pro˚tability 

that are both still hurting banks today.
 ˜is was notably true in Montenegro and Serbia, which 
su˝ered the two largest growth slowdowns in the 
region, but also in Albania. Given the extent of 
the growth and credit slowdown in Montenegro, 

it is perhaps surprising that NPLs did not increase 
more there, but this could re˙ect the extent 
to which they were moved o˝ balance sheets 

(Figure
 3.15). Going by NPL data, the greatest 
distress was found in the corporate (often real 
estate) rather than the household sector. Corporate 

NPLs were higher not just because corporate loans 
represented a higher share of the total, but also 
because the NPL ratio within the corporate loan 
book was typically twice as high as for household loans, except in Kosovo. In the face of such NPLs

concerns that NPL provisioning rates overstate 
actual loan loss coverage because of optimistic 
collateral valuations (Box
 3.1).On balance, strong foreign ownership has 
served the region well but lessons need to be 

learned. Foreign banks were key to introducing 
modern banking practices to the region, as 
well as improving governance in the sector and 

access to credit.
6 Nevertheless, the lessons from 
heavy reliance on foreign funding should not be 
forgotten. In good times these ˙ows can amplify 
credit booms to unsustainable levels, and they are 
di˛cult for policymakers to control. In times of 
tight global liquidity, reliance on foreign funding 

exacerbates the retraction of credit supply, again

during which banks were privatized so that strategic foreign investors

Europe. Despite some intraregional variation, 
the overall picture that emerges is of banking 
systems still reeling under high NPL levels, low 
pro˚tability, and weak credit. Can banks in 
the region escape this cycle and contribute to 

sustained economic growth?
Looking AheadAre Current Levels of Credit Compared with other countries of Central and 
Eastern Europe, ˚nancial intermediation levels 
in the Western Balkans are relatively low.
 ˜e average credit-to-GDP ratio in the Western 

Balkans (45
 percent) is below the average for 
Eastern Europe and below that for all Eastern 
European regions except Southeastern Europe 

(Figure

even more pronounced in the bank-assets-to-GDP 
ratio, because nonlending activities of banks in the Western Balkans are largely limited to holding 
cash and government securities.

Low ˚nancial intermediation re˙ects in part low 
incomes in the region, but credit to GDP still 
seems to fall short after adjusting for income 
and other fundamentals (Figure

countries tend to have low credit-to-GDP 
ratios. Once this is taken into account, ˚nancial 
intermediation levels in the Western Balkans no 

longer stand out dramatically. Nevertheless, they 
are all lower than can be explained by income 
alone, notably in Albania and to a lesser extent in Kosovo, Macedonia, and Serbia. More systematic

Can Credit Intermediation Be Despite the need to bolster ˚nancial penetration, 
the credit recovery remains timid, with 
credit-to-GDP ratios moving sideways or 
contracting (Figure
 3.20). Relative to the end of 

2013 (close to the trough for most countries), 
credit growth increased by about 3
 percentage 
points on average across the region. However, this 

masks signi˚cant cross-country variation. While 
credit growth fell over this period in Albania 
and stayed ˙at in Macedonia, it improved by 
more than 5
 percentage points in Kosovo and 
10 percentage points in Montenegro (though 

from a very low base). Notably, credit is clearly 
outpacing nominal GDP in Kosovo; in other 
countries, the credit-to-GDP ratio moved sideways 

(Macedonia and Serbia) or contracted, notably 
in Albania. Understanding the reasons for this 
weak credit performance is key to understanding 
prospects going forward.
Weak Funding
Funding constraints appear to be a key reason for 
continued modest credit growth. In particular, 
parent bank funding has not returned to the 
region™s banks following the sharp deleveraging.
9 After a modest recovery in 2015, parent funding 
fell again slightly last year and remains more 
than 10 percentage points of GDP below its 

peak (Figure
 3.21). Moreover, prospects for 
a turnaround in parent funding do not seem 
particularly promising, and there is a possibility 

that foreign funding will continue to contract. 
˜ere are various factors supporting this stance 
(Figure
 3.22):Ł Foreign banks see limited prospects in the 
region. 
˜is phenomenon is, at some level, 
a vicious circle. Limited prospects are 
in˙uenced by current modest pro˚tability, 

which in turn in˙uences funding decisions, which limit opportunities and pro˚ts. In the 
latest European Investment Bank survey, no 
9In this context, it is worth noting that the largest three foreign 
banks in the Western Balkan countries account on average for almost 
half of the market share in the region. In contrast, they account for 

less than 6 percent of the assets of their parent groups on average.

foreign banking group said it plans to expand 
operations in the region, slightly more than 
half said they will only selectively
 expand operations, and the rest said they will either 

maintain or reduce operations.
Ł Parent bank stress. 
Some parent banks of key 
subsidiaries in the Western Balkans have 
themselves faced stress in the past, and others 

remain vulnerable. ˜is stress has impinged 
on the region™s banking systems, either via 
pressure to consolidate capital at the parent 

level or in some cases via outright deposit 
out˙ows in the subsidiaries themselves when 
depositors lost con˚dence in the group 
(Box
 3.2). In addition, the restructuring 
plans submitted by Greek banks as part of 

the EU-led bailout foresee signi˚cant scaling 
back of activities in the Western Balkans. 
Greek banks have in fact started to sell their 

subsidiaries in the region.
1010˜is would of course be positive going forward if the subsidiar
-ies are sold to banking groups on a more solid footing.
Ł Global regulatory changes. 
In addition to stress 
at speci˚c banks, global and EU regulatory 
changes are having signi˚cant indirect 
e˝ects on Western Balkan banking systems 
via the dominance of foreign subsidiaries 

(Annex 3.2). To give but one example, as of 
January 2018 risk weights on government 
bond exposures in non-EU countries will 

be gradually adjusted (the risk weights are 

currently at zero), even when funding is in 
local currency. ˜is is a particular worry 
in Southeastern Europe, where banks are 

signi˚cant buyers of government securities.
Western Balkan banks were able to mitigate 

the decline in foreign funding via deposit 
growth. Resident deposits increased by close to 
8 percentage points of GDP between the peak and 

trough of parent funding (2014),
11 making up for the decline in external funding (Figure
 3.23). Bosnia, where deposit growth was disappointing, 
has been an exception. In contrast, the New 

Member States saw a similar increase in deposits 
but a sharper decline in parent funding postcrisis, 
for a net loss. In comparison, Latin America 
and Asia did much worse after their crises, with a signi˚cantly sharper decline in external 
funding barely mitigated by deposit growth. 
Deposit growth in the Western Balkans held up 
in part because the region™s economies su˝ered 

comparatively less during the global ˚nancial crisis 
than other economies in Europe. 
However, deposit growth is unlikely to be enough 
on its own to fund a meaningful expansion in 
credit in the medium to long term.
 Assuming deposits continue to grow in line with recent 
trends and that this deposit growth funds an 

expansion in credit, credit-to-GDP ratios would 
rise more than 10
 percentage points over the 
next 10 years in Montenegro and SerbiaŠ 

between 5 and 10
 percentage points in Kosovo 
and Macedonia. But they would contract
 11However, as mentioned previously, parent bank funding did 
not stop falling in 2014 (and in fact declined in 2016 as well). ˜e 
increase in parent bank funding in 2015 means that, strictly speak
-
ing, the trough was recorded in 2014. ˜e level at the end of 2017, 

however, could be below what it was in 2014.

assume no further external deleveraging. If foreign

credit-to-GDP ratios can be expected to fall

the medium-term upside for deposit deepening (Figure

region, some involved nonŒWestern European 
groups (US-based and Turkish companies), ˚lling

(Table
 3.1). New entrants to the market from 
abroad were rare during the period, although 
Kosovo attracted investors from Slovenia and 
Turkey, re˙ecting better market conditions and 
higher potential relative to its peers. Investors from 

the United Arab Emirates opened a bank in Serbia 
that started operations in 2015.
Why has interest from new investors been limited?
 Certainly, factors similar to those deterring 
existing foreign groups are at play: low cyclical 

pro˚tability, perceptions of limited growth 
prospects, and structurally low saving rates. 

In addition, new entrants have to face the fact 
that, in some countries in the region, there may 
already be too many banks (Figure
 3.26). When looking across a large sample of similar-scale 
countries at the relationship between population 

and number of banks, all countries in the region 

lie at or above the predicted (sample average) 
value. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro 
stand out in this regard, but Albania, Macedonia, 

and Serbia are not exempt. Only Kosovo seems 
to have an average number of banks relative

to its population. Other indicators such as the 
H-statistic, Lerner index, and Boone indicator also suggest that bank competition is particularly 
˚erce in Serbia (Figure
 3.27). While healthy bank 

competition may bene˚t consumers and the country, too much competition in the presence 
of imperfect regulation could lead to risk-taking 

above the social optimum, and would likely deter 
potential entrants.Impaired Balance Sheets
Balance sheets have improved in the region in 
recent years as the economy has recovered from 
the postcrisis slump.
 GDP and domestic demand have bounced back from the trough in line 

with the global economy and domestic policy e˝orts. Various countries in the region are now 
growing north of 3
 percent, better than before but 

below what would be desirable from an income 
convergence perspective (and well below precrisis 
levels in most countries). ˜e economic recovery 
has brought NPL ratios down (Figure
 3.28) and increased bank pro˚tability (Figure
 3.29), and 
bank lending standards have eased with improved 
con˚dence in economies and in the banks themselves (Figure
 3.30). However, asset impairment is still above precrisis 
levels, and weak balance sheets remain an 
important drag on credit growth (ECB 2015).
 
˜e decline (increase) in NPLs (pro˚tability) 
shown above, while welcome, falls far short of 
fully repairing the damage brought about by the

crisis. Econometric analysis using bank-by-bank 
data that disaggregate credit developments into 
demand factors (proxied by GDP) and supply 
factors (NPL ratio, provisioning ratio, liquidity 

ratio, loan-to-deposit ratio, equity to net loans, and return on equity)
13 shows that supply 
factors explain about half of the postcrisis credit 

slowdown (Figure
 3.31).14 Perhaps more relevant, 
as recently as 2016, credit supply factors still 

explained about 40 percent of the di˝erence in 
credit growth relative to the precrisis period, 

despite recent improvements in balance sheets. 
Put another way, if NPLs, pro˚tability, and other 
bank-speci˚c factors were back at precrisis levels, 
credit growth today would be about 10
 percentage 
points higher even at current levels of aggregate 

and credit demand. ˜ese results are quite 
consistent across all countries in the region. And, 
not surprisingly, weak balance sheets have been 

and remain a bigger drag on credit in EU-owned 
banks that experienced a greater boom and bust. 
At the same time, the model result that weak 

demand explains about half of the credit slowdown 
should not be overlooked. After all, GDP growth 
remains well below precrisis (unsustainable) levels 
despite the recent recovery, and many borrowers 
remain trapped in a debt overhang, not least 
because of ine˛cient restructuring and insolvency 
frameworks, slow courts, and other issues, as 

discussed below. 
13See Annex
 3.1 for details.
14Note that in the econometric model we count NPLs as a supply 
constraint to credit, when in fact NPLs are also a sign of distressed 
borrowers and hence could be a demand constraint as well. Adjust
-
ing for this in the model does not materially change the key results.
If impaired balance sheets are a problem, an 
important question is whether banks can ride the 
ongoing recovery to grow out of their balance 
sheet issues. ˜e answer is that this would be a 

risky strategy. ˜e main reason balance sheets 
have started to improve is less the recent recovery 
and more the forceful policy action undertaken in 

the region (see below). Another way to see this is 
to consider the counterfactual question: without 
additional policy e˝orts, how fast would the 
region™s economies need to grow for banks™ NPLs 
to return to 2007 levels? Econometric modeling of 

NPLs (see Annex 3.4) shows that, in all countries 
except Kosovo and Macedonia, reducing NPLs 
in three years via growth alone would require 

signi˚cantly faster expansions than those currently 
observed (Table
 3.2).15 Alternatively, countries 
would need to sustain their current (relatively 

positive) growth rates for another ˚ve years to 
reduce NPLs to healthy levels. ˜e ˚rst scenario 
is highly unlikely. ˜e second scenario is still a 
stretch, and the wait would be costly. ˜e bottom 

line is that policy e˝orts to repair balance sheets 
need to be sustained, and the current recovery 
should not give rise to complacency.
Nonbank Structural FactorsIn addition to issues such as bank funding and 

impaired balance sheets, other nonbank factors 
have constrained and will continue to constrain 
15Moreover, this exercise simply considers the current stock of 
NPLs and assumes no new NPL formation going forward; hence the 
estimated time needed to clear NPLs is a lower bound.

credit provision in the Western Balkans. Across 
much of the region, large gaps in land titling and 
cadastral systems impede the collateralization of land and real estate property, and in other cases 
delay foreclosure when property is collateralized. 

˜ese gaps are often a legacy of the wars in the 
1990s, but not always. In Macedonia, the public 
real estate registry does not provide prices for real 

estate transactions or details on properties and is 

not regularly updated. In Kosovo, many properties 
are not recorded at all. In some countries, the lack 
of a regulated appraisal profession or licensing 

standards combined with an illiquid real estate 
market make valuation di˛cult. Even if property 
is properly titled and valuated, di˛culty executing 
the collateral if necessary limits its value as 
collateral ex anteŠcultural factors such as the 
stigma of purchasing an acquaintance™s repossessed 
property from a bank also play a role.
Poor credit registries have been another 
bottleneck. Credit registries play a critical role in 
enhancing disclosure and making information 

available for creditors to make informed decisions 
about borrowers. Unfortunately, credit registries 
in the region are either incomplete (covering, 
for instance, only secured debt or only a subset 
of borrowers), in the process of being set up, 

or simply lacking altogether in some countries. And, for many ˚rms in the region, particularly 
smaller ones, ˚nancial disclosure forms are either 
incomplete or untrustworthy, compounding 
the information asymmetry between borrowers 

and lenders.Slow court procedures have also driven weak credit 
supply across the Western Balkans.
 Understa˝ed 
courts and large case backlogs throughout the 
region have meant that recovering assets through 

the court system can be extremely slow. ˜is, 
in turn, leads banks to withhold credit and 
discourages the cleanup of NPLs. However, 

some countries in the region have taken steps 
in recent years to alleviate or circumvent such 
bottlenecks (see Vienna Initiative 2017). One 
promising avenue introduced in various countries 
in the region is using private enforcement 

agents tasked (by the creditor) with enforcing 
court orders. Kosovo introduced a system of 

private enforcement agents in 2014, which 

has signi˚cantly reduced court backlogs and 
eased asset recovery (Figure
 3.32). Montenegro 
introduced a similar system. In both countries, 

however, the reforms remain a work in progress, as 
discussed below.
Weak insolvency regimes also discourage banks 
from lending, and such regimes are particularly 

damaging in a debt overhang context.
 ˜e sharp increase in private debt across most of the Western 
Balkans in the run-up to the ˚nancial crisis means 

that banks have often had to deal with highly 
indebted borrowers. ˜is is an ongoing problem 
in the region, re˙ecting weak insolvency regimes 

in many countries. In some Western Balkan 
countries, the insolvency of ˚rms is too narrow 
(that is, debt restructuring often excludes debts in 

serious ˚nancial distress or insolvency). Lengthy 
court procedures lead to low reorganization 
prospects. Regarding personal insolvency, 

some countries in the region, such as Kosovo, 
Macedonia, and Serbia, have yet to introduce a 
dedicated framework.
In short, funding constraints, impaired balance 
sheets, and nonbank structural factors are holding 
back credit. And, as we have seen, the odds of

in terms of the scale of impaired assets as well 
as the adequacy of banks™ provisions. Serbia 
completed a comprehensive asset quality 

review in 2015 that covered the top 14 banks, 
or some 88 percent of banking sector assets. 
It resulted in signi˚cant adjustments in bank 

capital ratios.Ł Supervised action plans:
 Once the true scale of 

the problem is established, authorities should 
require vulnerable banks to draft time-bound 
remedial actions that include, where 
necessary, capital injections by shareholders 
to cover actual and anticipated losses and 

resolution plans. As part of these action plans, 
impediments to loan restructuring must be 
tackled head-on. ˜e authorities can play 
a key facilitation role here by coordinating 
multiple lenders, sharing information, and monitoring progress.
Ł Development of distressed asset markets:
 Beyond 

the two previous measures, country authorities 

should take additional steps to reduce 
impediments to NPL write-o˝s and facilitate more active markets for NPLs. Measures 
16See Table
 3.3 for detailed country-by-country recommendations.
can include providing tax and regulatory 
incentives for banks to write o˝ NPLs and 
removing entry barriers to the market for 
distressed assets (for example, nonbank 
˚nancial institutions and private asset 

management companies). For example, in 
Bosnia and Serbia retail NPLs can be sold only 
to banks. Albanian authorities recently created 

a category of nonbank ˚nancial institutions 

specializing in administering NPLs that are 
subject to lower capital requirements.
Ł Elimination of tax disincentives for NPL sales:
 In Albania, an NPL write-o˝ is considered 
tax-deductible for provisions and write-o˝s, 
but if the collateral on the debt is recovered 

(or income is received from the sale of the 
NPL), it is considered extraordinary income 
and is taxed at a higher rate. In Serbia, 

recognizing write-o˝s for tax purposes and 

adjusting the treatment of debt forgiveness 
for personal income tax purposes will also support NPL market development. ˜e 

Bosnian authorities should eliminate existing uncertainty over whether NPL transactions are 
subject to the value-added tax.
Ł Enhanced supervision: 
E˝orts should continue 
to bolster bank supervision in order to ensure 
that banks apply proper credit underwriting 

standards and risk management practices. 

In hindsight, the large increase in NPLs 
following the crisis revealed weak risk 
management and lax credit standards before 

the crisis, which should have been spotted by 
supervisors.
Ł ˛e macro-˚nancial impact of NPL cleanup 
should be manageable. NPLs are about 6 to 
7 percent of GDP in Albania, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, and Serbia and less than half 

in Kosovo and Macedonia. ˜is is much 

less than in, for example, Slovenia in 2012 
(18 percent of GDP), where a banking crisis 
necessitated a large capital injection by the 

government in state-owned banks. NPLs 
net of provisions are 25
 percent of capital in 
Montenegro and less in other countries. By 

comparison they were 85
 percent of capital

in Slovenia in 2012. Moreover, because most 
banks are foreign owned, any capital shortfalls 
would typically be covered by the private 
sector and not by the government.
Expand Funding BasesManaging external deleveraging, including 

potentially disruptive episodes, will be key to 
maintaining adequate funding bases across the 
region. As discussed in detail previously, external 
funding is unlikely to return in force, and could 

potentially continue to wither. As such, authorities 
should closely monitor banks and remain in 
close communication with parent banks and 

home supervisors in the event that any additional 

pullout from the region occurs. In this context, 
the Vienna Initiative will continue to play a crucial 
role.
17 In some cases, deeper and more targeted 
measures than those discussed in Box
 3.3 may be in order, particularly in cases of either disruptive 
deleveraging due to a crisis a˝ecting the parent 

group directly, or sharp deposit withdrawals 
triggered by lack of con˚dence in the parent. At 
a minimum, Western Balkan supervisors should 

ensure that banks under their authority maintain 
updated contingency plans for any such event.
In some countries, attracting fresh capital from 
new banking groups or even from private equity 

investors (with day-to-day management provided 
by bank experts) will require tackling overbanking. 
Country authorities should respect market 

discipline and let weak banks fail if their failure 
does not pose a systemic risk. ˜ey should also 17˜e Vienna Initiative and related agreements with foreign 
banks were a key part of the IMF program design in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and Serbia. Since 2012, Vienna 2 has focused on 

improving cooperation between home and host authorities while 

monitoring the pace of deleveraging with a view to keeping it 

orderly. Recommendations have been made to relevant European 

institutions to improve supervisory coordination and cross-border 

bank resolution. ˜e initiative has been a favored venue for dialogue 

between the banks that are systemically important in a country 

and the major interlocutors of those banks: the monetary authority 

and regulator, the parent international banking groups, and the 

latter™s regulators.
avoid granting licenses to banks or other investors 
that lack robust business plans (supported, in 
the case of private equity investors, by a credible 
investment horizon) or su˛cient capital bases. 
Encouraging consolidation, including through 

takeover of exiting banks by banks already 
operating in the country, would help further.
Looking toward the medium term, countries 
should also consider policy measures to diversify 
bank funding sources and expand domestic 

savings. For most of the banking systems in the 
Western Balkans, residential deposit bases are 
su˛cient to maintain current levels of lending but 
not to foster meaningful ˚nancial deepening, even 
with somewhat greater rates of deposit growth. 

˜e development of local capital markets where 
banks could issue corporate bonds could help expand the funding base. Setting up private sector 

pension funds and insurance companies would 
help create demand for bank bonds and could 
more generally spur domestic saving. However, 
capital markets are nascent or nonexistent in 

most of the Western Balkans and will not be a 
meaningful alternate funding source in the near 
term. For example, there have been few bond 
issuances in Albania (one in 2016), because most non˚nancial companies do not comply with the 
necessary accounting and transparency standards, 
and banks are liquid and easily funded with 
deposits. Building capacity at the supervisory level 
to oversee capital markets and deepen secondary 
government bond markets should be a ˚rst step in 

˚nancial development.
Tackle Nonbank Structural 
Obstacles to CreditImproving land and property titling will be key 
to facilitating the use of property as collateral and 

the development of mature mortgage markets. 
˜e legacy of the 1990s wars, during which thousands of property records were stolen, lost, or 
destroyed, will not be easily overcome. However, 
there have been ongoing e˝orts in the region 

(often with the support of donors) to improve 
the capacity of municipal cadastral o˛cesŠ116REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EURO

including using modern GPS systemsŠand to raise public awareness about the importance of 
recording transactions. ˜is has resulted in notable 
increases in the number of properties recorded 
and reduced the time needed to record them. 

˜ese e˝orts need to be sustained at all costs. 
In parallel, strengthening licensing standards 
and methodologies for appraisers would help 
improve collateral valuations and facilitate sales 

of collateral. Finally, it will take time to change 
cultural factors that limit the sale of repossessed 
collateral, but this should not mean that banks 
cannot be incentivized to sell this collateral more 
quickly. Along these lines, Albania recently limited 
the time that a bank can hold repossessed collateral 
to seven years and now applies a 150
 percent risk 
weighting to such assets.
Accelerating slow court procedures is another 
priority. Boosting sta˛ng and budgets in the 

courts would be the standard approach to address 
this issue. However, the recent introduction of 
private baili˝s to accelerate the execution of court 

orders is a promising alternative. Despite the 
attractiveness of this option, the introduction of 
private baili˝s is a complex reform that requires a 
learning-by-doing attitude. For instance, Kosovo 
recently introduced variable fees for the private 

enforcement agents, as the ˙at fees introduced in 
the original reform meant the baili˝s were mostly 
going after small debtors. More generally, the 
licensing, training, and oversight of the private 

baili˝s is paramount to avoid abuses and preserve 
the buy-in to the reform.
Insolvency frameworks remain un˚nished 
business. Countries that lack personal insolvency 
regimes to enable overindebted individuals to get 

a fresh start within a reasonable period should 
consider developing such regimes, provided 
institutional preconditions are met. Personal 
insolvency in the context of a poorly designed 
regime, weak institutional capacity (for example, 

courts, insolvency practitioners, debt counselors), 
or weak transparency of debtors™ assets can lead to 
signi˚cant moral hazard. Regarding the insolvency 

of ˚rms, countries where minority creditors can 

de facto block restructuring should put in place 
fast-track procedures to con˚rm workout plans 
previously approved by a majority of creditors, 

making such plans binding for all creditors. ˜is 
would encourage out-of-court negotiations and 
limit threats from minority holdouts.

Optimistic
 valuation of real estate collateral overstates actual loan loss provisioning, because the value of the 
collateral reduces the capital needed to build provision reserves. If banks cannot execute collateral at the book 

price, losses will be larger than shown in the books.
In the Western Balkans, an illiquid real estate market is a source of concern for collateral overvaluation. 
Lack of reliable and robust data on real estate prices leaves signi˚cant room for discretion when determining 

collateral value. Central banks in the region have aimed to address these issues through regulation and 

guidelines for property appraisals. Two recent experiences illustrate these e˝orts:
Ł ˜e National Bank of Serbia in 2015 launched an asset quality review accompanied by a new regulation 
requiring banks to submit appraisals of collateralŠby valuation expertsŠto the National Bank of Serbia. 

˜is information will be consolidated into a database of real estate transactions to allow for accurate 

collateral valuation and improve real estate appraisal practices. Adjustments to collateral values were a 

material driver of the Serbian asset quality review ˚ndings, which resulted in adjustments to capital of 

about •200 million, equivalent to a 175 basis point reduction in the adjusted capital adequacy ratio.
Ł ˜e Bank of Albania responded even more aggressively by setting the value of real estate collateral to zero 

for the provisioning of nonperforming loans. While this does not enhance collateral valuation practices, it 

allays any fears of collateral overvaluation.

Foreign
 bank subsidiaries from European Union (EU) countries that have experienced appreciable ˚nancial 
stress represent a sizable share of banking systems in the Western Balkans. As of the end of 2015, claims of 

Italian and Greek banks, for example, accounted for an average of more than 18
 percent of GDP in Albania, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Serbia 

(Figure
 3.2.1). Kosovo
 and Montenegro do not have 

meaningful exposures. Currently, concerns relate to some 

Greek banks
Subsidiaries of Greek banks have been under pressure 
from liquidity-starved parents in recent years. ˜e 2015 

˚nancial turbulence in Greece triggered a deposit run 

against the subsidiaries of Greek banks in Macedonia. 

Greek subsidiaries in Serbia also experienced some loss of 

their retail deposits during the same episode. Authorities 

in the region dealt successfully with the pressures via a 

wide range of tools, including closely monitoring banks™ 

placements in Greek parents or other subsidiaries overseas; 

encouraging Greek subsidiaries to gradually eliminate 

exposures to Greece; instituting pre-approvals for large 

transactions; introducing time-bound capital ˙ow 

measures aimed at preventing Greek-owned businesses 

from borrowing from local banks and transferring the 

funds to Greece; and imposing the mandatory transfer 

of deposits held at parent banks and group companies to 

accounts at the central bank.While the turbulence has receded, the next step will be to 
manage the withdrawal of Greek banks from the region. 

˜e restructuring plans submitted by Greek banks as part 

of the EU-led bailout envisage a sizable scaling back of 
their activities abroad. Piraeus, Greece™s largest bank in 

terms of assets, plans to sell its subsidiaries in Albania and 
Serbia (in addition to those in Bulgaria, Romania, and 
Ukraine). Greece™s second-largest lender, National Bank, might have to sell its subsidiaries in Southeastern 

Europe by June 2018, including those in Albania, Macedonia, and Serbia. National Bank agreed in early 

August to sell its subsidiary in Serbia to Hungarian-based OTP. Alpha Bank announced January 31, 2017, 

that it has agreed with Serbia™s MK Group on the sale of its 100

Faced
 with some of the highest nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios in the region, Albania and Serbia have 
designed comprehensive strategies to tackle the multidimensional nature of the problem (Figures 3.3.1 

and 3.3.2). Launched in the second half of 2015, the strategies cover banking supervision, tax issues, court 

procedures, and legal aspects, among other areas. Each strategy requires a joint approach that coordinates 

central banks, ministries of ˚nance, tax authorities, and the judicial system. ˜e strategies include a write-o˝ 
phase to reduce NPLs and a structural reform phase to prevent new NPLs and accelerate their resolution.
˜e ˚rst phase, focused on write-o˝ policies, has helped lower NPL levels. Previously, write-o˝s were 
resisted by banks due to insu˛cient provisions, parent group credit targets, and tax issues. While in Albania 

regulations on write-o˝s had been amended before the comprehensive strategy, write-o˝s accelerated after 

the launching of the strategy. ˜e Bank of Albania also increased bank inspections, resulting in additional 

NPLs being uncovered. In Serbia, write-o˝sŠdriven by asset quality reviews tailored for each bank and by 

regulation amendmentsŠalso contributed to reducing NPLs after the strategy was launched. Over 2015Œ16, 

write-o˝s reached about 6
 percent of total loans in Albania, and more than 3
 percent in Serbia.
While write-o˝s reduced NPL ratios, slow court execution processes and low collateral recovery remained 
downstream problems. NPLs have been moved o˝ balance sheets, providing incentives for renegotiation and 

sales. Nevertheless, NPL sales have been limited in Albania and Serbia, as asset management companies expect 

low recovery rates. Challenges for recovering and selling collateral are attributed to long court procedures,

owner), and a lack of economies of scale. Asset management companies prefer more pro˚table large NPL 
markets like Italy over small markets like Albania or Serbia.
A second phase of the strategies includes measures to improve NPL resolution by accelerating court execution, 
but this phase will require some time to be fully deployed. ˜ese measures have been lagging in part due 

to the complex coordination required to amend laws, such as insolvency and civil codes, which are needed 

to accelerate court processes and collateral execution. Albania approved new laws on insolvency and baili˝s 

(December 2016), but their implementation is pending until bylaws are issued. Serbia adopted a law 

regulating real estate appraisals (December 2016), which is critical for sound collateral valuation. Despite this 

progress, core legislation is still in the process of being approved in Serbia. ˜e approval of draft amendments 

to the corporate insolvency lawŠsubmitted to Parliament in August 2007Šare still pending. In both Albania 

and Serbia, the strategies call for out-of-court restructuring frameworks, but such mechanisms require the 

threat of an e˛cient judiciary system if out-of-court agreement is not reached.
Finally, having monitoring mechanisms in place is key to the success of the strategies. Regular reporting on 
progress and follow-up help ensure accountability and implementation. While Serbia™s strategy requires a 

regular progress report every six months, Albania™s strategy involves only ad hoc monitoring, which could 

undermine accountability and implementation.Box 3.3 (continued)1233. B

Annex 3.2. Impact of Global and Local Regulatory Changes˜e European banking sector has experienced 
signi˚cant changes in its regulatory environment 
since the global ˚nancial crisis. New Basel III 
requirements and their European Union (EU) 
transposition can constrain the funding of 
international parent groups, initiating ripple 
e˝ects on their Southeastern European (SEE) 
subsidiaries. Completion of the EU Banking 

Union is expected to further a˝ect SEE banking 

systems. Uncertainties associated with these and 
other ongoing regulatory developments can lead 
cross-border banking groups to precautionary 

scaling down of operations in SEE countries.
SEE banking systems have been a˝ected by 
regulatory changes implemented in home 
countries of cross-border banking groups. ˜ese 
changes include tightened regulations on the 
quantity and quality of capital, deleveraging, 

funding pro˚les, bail-in-able debt, and risk 

management practices. While both home and 
host countries tightened their own regulations 
on banks™ international operations between 2006 

and 2017, regulatory changes in home countries 
seem to have been more important in explaining 
the decline in foreign lending (Ichiue and 
Lambert 2016).
As an example of how Basel III requirements and 
their EU transposition constrain the funding of 
international parent groups, with rippling e˝ects 

on their SEE subsidiaries, higher risk weights for 
parent banks when subsidiaries hold SEE-based 
securities may reduce parent funding of local 

banks. ˜ere are also tensions in the application of 
the liquidity framework, for instance with respect 
to the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable 

funding ratio. On the asset side, liquid assets of 
SEE banks are to a large extent domestic central 
bank bills and treasury bills that do not have an 
investment grade. On the liability side, banks 
have limited options to fund themselves through 

alternative sources such as local bond markets.
˜e non-EU SEE countries will be a˝ected by 
the ongoing shaping of the EU Banking Union.
 While these countries will not be members of the 
union, euro-area headquartered banks often have 
a systemically important presence in non-EU 
SEE countries, particularly banks from Austria, 

Greece, Italy, France, and Slovenia.
 Non-EU SEE 
banking systems face common challenges in the context of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the 
Single Resolution Mechanism, and the potential 
European Deposit Insurance Scheme. Speci˚cally:
Ł From January 2018 on, risk weights on 
government bond exposures in non-EU 

countries will be gradually adjusted (risk weights are currently at zero), even when 
funding is in local currency. For example, 

if an Albanian subsidiary has used local 
deposits to buy Albanian government bonds, 
the risk weights for the parents will be 
non-zero. ˜is is particularly worrisome in 
the SEE region, because it would put banks 

under pressure to reduce their exposure to 
governments. However, Article 114 of the 
Capital Requirements Regulation allows for 

an exemption in case of ﬁthird countries, 
which apply supervisory and regulatory 
arrangements at least equivalent to those

applied in the Union.ﬂ ˜is means that the 
European Banking Committee needs to decide 
whether SEE countries can be exempted, but 
there is no clarity as to the conditions for 
the exemptions.
Ł Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM): For 
SEE host supervisors, the European Banking 
Authority (EBA) is the key counterpart to 
facilitate access to the ﬁcoreﬂ supervisory 
colleges of EU bank groups. As 13 of 

17 euro-area-headquartered banks operating 
in SEE countries are deemed ﬁsigni˚cant,ﬂ 
the European Central Bank (ECB) has 
become the home supervisor of SEE-based 
subsidiaries. While the cooperation between 

the EU and SEE authorities was formalized 
through a memorandum signed with the 
EBA under the auspices of the Vienna 

Initiative, the memorandum does not 

guarantee the integration of SEE authorities into EU supervisory college activities. 
Re˙ecting the minor share of SEE EU-owned 

subsidiaries at the consolidated-group level, 
SEE authorities worry about potential 
negligence by centralized decision makers 
regarding spillovers to SEE banking systems. 
Moreover, there is concern that competitive 

distortions that negatively a˝ect domestically 
owned banksŠas a result of euro area bank 
subsidiaries™ indirect access to ECB liquidity 
through their parentsŠwill be reinforced by 
the EU Banking Union.
Ł Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM): 
Subsidiaries of European globally systemically 
important banks (G-SIBs), as well as banks 
that are domestically systemically relevant 
(D-SIBs), may be required to issue more 

liabilities with high loss-absorption capacity, 
which would reshape SEE banks™ funding 
model. ˜e issue of participation of host 

countries in the resolution of cross-border 
banks, for instance by avoiding ring-fencing 
and by providing domestic ˚nancial support 
in case of a crisis, remains problematic. 
It is within reason, for example, that host 

subsidiaries might fall back on their core 
equity capital and repay their parent™s 
subordinated loans to prevent sudden 
withdrawal in case of group-wide distress. 

As with the implementation of the SSM, con˙icts of interest between the home and the 
host authorities may appear if a subsidiary is 

systemically important in a host country but is 

only a minor fraction of the group.
Ł European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS): 
Prospects for a harmonized EDIS may 
in˙uence cross-border allocations of deposits. 
˜e EDIS will be necessary to complement 
the EU Banking Union so as prevent national 

governments and domestic deposit schemes 
from remaining as the ultimate backstop in 
case of a cross-border banking crisis. It is 

also needed to avoid a ﬁdeath loopﬂ between 

sovereigns and banks. ˜e peripheral situation 
of SEE countries may trigger uneven levels 
of depositor con˚dence, which could lead to 
deposit ˙ight toward institutions a˛liated 
with a mutualized European safety net, 
possibly backstopped by the European 
Stability Mechanism.
Ł General uncertainty regarding the above 
regulatory developments engenders risk in 

the form of precautionary scaling down of 

regional operations by cross-border banking. 
Remaining shortcomings in the antiŒmoney 
laundering/combating the ˚nancing of 
terrorism framework in recipient countries, 
economies of scale in compliance, broader 
reorientation of bank business models, and 
reputation concerns about banks dealing 
with o˝shore companies or countries 

may spur reevaluation of business models 
and precautionary retrenchment from 
correspondent banking relationships. As in 

other jurisdictions, there is anecdotal evidence 
of a sometimes signi˚cant decline in foreign 
correspondent banking relationships in the 
region (ﬁderiskingﬂ).

Annex 3.3. Contributions of Supply versus Demand Factors to Credit Growth˜is annex details the estimation of demand and supply contributions to credit growth. ˜e 
estimation follows the speci˚cations in IMF 2013 
and Everaert and others 2015 and tailors them to 
the Western Balkan region.
Data˜e sample covers 70 banks (unbalanced panel) 
for the period 2006Œ15. Data were extracted from 
the FitchConnect Database. Total loans were 

used as a proxy given the limited availability of 
bank-level data on lending to the private sector.
Estimation Method˜e estimation of demand and supply drivers of 
credit growth is done using ordinary least squares 
random e˝ects. We tested for autocorrelation as 
well as for robust standard errors. As the results are 

relatively stable, we present the basic estimations 
to facilitate the presentation.
Demand drivers are approximated with aggregate 
macro variables. ˜ese can be considered 
exogenous for each bank. Supply drivers are 
approximated mostly with lagged balance sheet 

indicators of each bank. Among the supply drivers, the Emerging Market Bond Index spread 
is included to capture risk aversion of the banks 
in the absence of lending standards at the bank 
level. ˜e contemporaneous change in provisions 

can be considered exogenous for two reasons: 
(1) a part of the provisions is dependent on the 
aging of nonperforming loans (NPLs); and (2) 

banks™ provisions largely follow the banks™ business 
plans, which are determined ex ante based on 
idiosyncratic information of their customers and the forecast cycles.
Credit growth is decomposed into demand 
and supply contributions using the regression 
coe˛cients. ˜e subscript c denotes country,

ESTERN BALKANS: 
PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGESAnnex 3.4. The Macroeconomic of Nonperforming LoansSince the share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) in 
total loans is explained by both macroeconomic 
and bank-speci˚c factors, the econometric analysis uses the Arellano-Bond (1991) dynamic panel 
approach to isolate the persistence of NPLs and 

evaluate the e˝ect of the variables of interest. ˜e 
econometric model as speci˚ed is:  NPLratio
  i,j,t   =  
NPLratio
  i,j,tˆ1   +  
˚ k=1  k     
˛  k

˚ n=1  n     
˝  j    
Y  n,j,t   +  
Z  j   +  
u  i,j,t  , in which X is a vector of bank-speci˚c indicators 
for bank i in country 
j at time t. Y is a vector 
of country-speci˚c indicators for country 
j at time t. Z is a ˚xed e˝ect for country 
j, and u is the stochastic error term with errors assumed 
as independently and identically distributed. A lag of the dependent variable is included in 
some versions of the econometric speci˚cation to 
capture the e˝ect of omitted explanatory variables 

and the persistence of the NPL ratio.
Variables
˜e set of explanatory variables includes a broad 

range of bank-speci˚c and macroeconomic 
variables. Bank-speci˚c indicators include 
pro˚tability measures (return on equity, net 

interest margin), provisioning, capital adequacy 
(Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted capital), market 
share (share of total banking sector deposits), and 
loan growth (total loans net of impaired loans). 
Real GDP growth is used as an indicator of 

general macroeconomic performance. In˙ation, 
the lending rate, and the exchange rate vis-à-vis 
the euro are included as additional indicators 

of the state of the macroeconomic and ˚nancial 
environment, which a˝ects loan quality. Another 
variable of importance is the private sector 

credit-to-GDP ratio, which acts as a proxy of 
the aggregate debt burden of households and 
businesses. Data on banks™ risk-taking behavior 

are limited.
˜e relevance and expected signs of the 

relationships between NPLs and the selected 

macroeconomic variables are as follows:
Ł A slow economy is likely to be associated 
with sluggish incomes and increased ˚nancial 
distress, so low or negative GDP growth may 

contribute to high levels of NPLs.
Ł A hike in interest rates weakens borrowers™ 
debt-servicing capacity, more so if loan rates 
are variable. ˜erefore, NPLs are expected to 

be positively related to interest rates.
Ł In˙ation a˝ects borrowers™ debt-servicing 

capacity through di˝erent channels, and its 

impact on NPLs can be positive or negative. 
Higher in˙ation can make debt servicing 
easier either by reducing the real value of 
outstanding loans or simply because it is associated with low unemployment. However, 

it can also weaken some borrowers™ ability to 
service debt by reducing real incomes when 
wages are sticky.
Ł An appreciation of the exchange rate can have 

mixed implications. On the one hand, it can 

weaken the competitiveness of export-oriented 
˚rms and adversely a˝ect their ability to 
service their debt (Fofack 2005). On the 
other hand, it can improve the debt-servicing 
capacity of borrowers who borrow in foreign 

currency, but it makes the loans more 
expensive in domestic currency.
Data˜e sample covers 67 banks (unbalanced panel) 
for the period 2006Œ15. Bank-level data were 
extracted from Fitch. Country-level data come 
from the IMF™s Intentional Financial Statistics and 

World Economic Outlook databases.
EstimationIn order to capture the persistence of the growth of 

the NPL ratio, we use the Arellano-Bond (1991) 
130International Monetary Fund
 | November 2017
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EURO
PEdynamic panel approach. Since NPLs are highly 
persistent, ˚xed-e˝ect estimations can give rise to 
endogeneity issues. In contrast, Arellano-Bond 
is designed for situations with (1) ﬁsmall T, 
large Nﬂ panels, meaning few time periods 

and many individuals; (2) a linear functional relationship; (3) one left-side variable that is 
dynamic, depending on its own past realizations; 

(4) independent variables that are not strictly 

exogenous, meaning they are correlated with past 
and possibly current realizations of the error; (5) 
˚xed individual e˝ects; and (6) heteroscedasticity 

and autocorrelation within individuals but not 
across them.
Moreover, we would like to treat real GDP and 
nominal e˝ective exchange rates as endogenous, 
since the causality can run in both directions, 
and both variables can be correlated with the 
error term. Simple pair-wise regressions suggest 
that NPLs do have a signi˚cant impact on real 
GDP and the nominal e˝ective exchange rate. 
For the other variables included in the model 
this is not the case. Finally, to avoid problems of 

correlation among errors and to obtain additional 
e˛ciency gains, a generalized method of moments 
(GMM) with instrumental variables is needed 

for our analysis. All the issues discussed above are 

addressed by the Arellano-Bond di˝erence GMM 
estimation, with robust standard errors.
We use this estimation to ˚nd the determinants of 
the NPL ratio as well as bank pro˚tability.
