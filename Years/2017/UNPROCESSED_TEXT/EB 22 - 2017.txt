 2 Economic and monetary
 developments
 Overview
 At its monetary policy meeting on 
7 September
 2017, the Governing Council
 assessed that 
while the ongoing economic expansion provides confidence 
that inflation will gradually head to levels in line with 
its
 inflation aim, it has yet 
to translate sufficiently into stronger inflation dynamics.
 The economic 
expansion, which accelerated more than
 expected in the first half of 2017, continues 
to be solid and broad
-based across countries and sectors. At the same time, the 
recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which 
requires monitoring with regard to its possible i
mplications for the medium
-term 
outlook for price stability.
 Measures of underlying inflation have ticked up slightly in 
recent months but, overall, remain at subdued levels. Therefore, a very substantial 
degree of monetary accommodation is still needed fo
r underlying inflation pressures 
to gradually build up and support headline inflation developments in the medium 
term. 
The Governing Council thus maintained its monetary stance and 
will decide 
in 
the autumn
 on the calibration of 
the
 policy instruments beyo
nd the end of the year
. Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 
7 September
 201
7 The euro area economic expansion is continuing and becoming increasingly 
resilient, with the ECB™s monetary policy measures supporting
 domestic 
demand.
 Euro 
area real GDP increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the second 
quarter of 2017, after 0.5% in the first quarter. Real GDP growth is supported 
primarily by domestic demand. Private consumption is underpinned by employment 
gains, w
hich are also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by increasing 
household wealth. The recovery in investment continues to benefit from very 
favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. Surveys 
and short
-term indi
cators confirm the outlook for robust growth momentum in the 
near term.
 The 
broad
-based global recovery 
will support euro area exports.
 Global 
economic activity is projected to accelerate moderately, underpinned by continued 
monetary and fiscal policy supp
ort in advanced economies and a recovery in 
commodity
-exporting emerging market economies. After showing a marked 
improvement at the turn of the year, global trade has softened recently, but leading 
indicators continue to signal positive prospects. 
Overall
, the broad
-based global 
recovery will mitigate the potential impact 
on exports 
of a stronger exchange rate, 
which has appreciated by 3.4% in trade
-weighted terms since the Governing 
Council™s monetary policy meeting in June
. The September 2017 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for euro area real 
GDP growth are 2.2% in 2017, 1.8% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019.
 Compared with the 
ECB Economic Bu
lletin, Issue 6 / 2017
 - Economic and monetary developments
 Over
view
 3 June 2017 
Eurosystem
 staff projections, the expected growth rates 
have been
 revised up for 2017 and 
are 
broadly unchanged thereafter.
 Risks surrounding the 
euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. On the one hand, the current 
positive cyclical momentum increases the chances of a stronger than expected 
economic upswing. On the other hand, downside risks continue to exist, primar
ily 
relating to global factors and developments in foreign exchange markets.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation in 
August 2017 was 1.5%, up from 1.3% in July.
 This reflected higher energy and, to 
a lesser extent, higher
 processed food inflation.
 On the basis of current oil futures 
prices, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to temporarily decline towards the 
turn of the year, mainly reflecting base effects in energy prices
, before rising again
. While measures o
f underlying inflation have ticked up moderately in recent 
months, they have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, HICP inflation excluding energy and food was 
1.2% in August, unchanged from July,
 but 0.4 percentage point higher than the 
average for the final quarter of 
2016. Domestic cost pressures, notably from labour 
markets, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise 
gradually over the medium term, supported by
 the ECB™s
 monetary policy measures, 
the continuing economic expansion, 
and the corresponding gradual absorption of 
economic slack and rising wages
.  The September 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual HICP inflation at 
1.5% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019.
 Compared with the June 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the 
outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised down slightly, mainly reflecting 
the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate
. The euro area budget deficit is foreseen to decline further over the projection 
horizon (2017
-19) 
owing
 to improving cyclical conditions and decreasing 
interest payments.
 Based on the September 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections,
 the general govern
ment deficit ratio for the euro area is expected to fall 
from 1.5% of GDP in 2016 to 0.9% of GDP in 2019
.Structural deficits, however, are 
not declining, despite the favourable growth dynamics. 
 Money growth remained robust 
despite some monthly volatility
. The recovery in 
the 
growth 
of loans 
to the private sector has been proceeding. At the same time, the 
annual flow of total external financing to non
-financial corporations is estimated to 
have eased somewhat in the second quarter of 2017
. The pass
-through 
of the monetary policy measures put in place 
in recent years
 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions.
 Euro area sovereign 
bond yields have remained broadly unchanged since the Governing Council™s 
monetary policy meeting in June. Corporate b
ond spreads vis
-à-vis the risk
-free rate 
have declined marginally and remain below the levels observed in early March 2016 
when the corporate sector pu
rchase programme was announced.

 Overview
 4 Monetary policy decisions
 Taking into account 
the outcome of the economic analysis 
and
 the signals 
coming from the monetary analysis, the Governing Council concluded that 
a continued very substantial degree of monetary accommodation
 is needed
 to 
secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards lev
els that are below, but 
close to, 2%.
 The Gov
erning Council decided to 
keep the
 key ECB interest rates
 unchanged
 and expect
s them to remain at their present levels for an extended 
period of time, and well past the horizon of 
the
 net asset purchases. Regard
ing
 non-standard monetary policy measures, 
the Governing Council
 confirm
ed that 
the
 net 
asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of •60 billion, are intended to run until 
the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the 
Gove
rning Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent 
with its inflation aim. The net purchases are made alongside reinvestments of the 
principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase 
programme
 (APP)
. In addition, the Governing Council reconfirmed its commitment to 
increase 
the
 APP 
in terms of size and/or duration
 if the outlook 
becomes
 less 
favourable, or if financial conditions 
become
 inconsistent with further progress 
towards a sustained adjus
tment i
n the path of inflation. 
This autumn 
the Governing 
Council 
will decide on the calibration of 
the
 policy instruments beyond the end of the 
year, taking into account the expected path of inflation and the financial conditions 
needed for a sustained return of
 inflation rates towards levels that are below, but 
close to, 2%.

 5 1 External environment
 The global economy is 
continuing to expand at 
a solid rate. After a temporary dip in 
momentum in some countries at the start of the year, data point to a rebound in 
global 
GDP growth. Looking ahead, global economic activity is projected to 
accelerate 
moderately, 
underpinned by continued monetary and fiscal policy support
 in advanced economies and a recovery in commodity
-exporting emerging market 
economies
. 
After showing
 a marked improvement at the turn of the year
, g
lobal trade 
has softened recently
, 
but leading indicators 
continue to
 signal positive prospects. 
Global inflation 
is expected
 to rise 
as 
spare capacity at the global level 
diminishes
. Global economic activity
 and trade
 The global economy 
has 
continued 
to expand 
stead
ily
. Following a temporary 
dip in growth in some economies in the first quarter, 
the 
latest data and survey
-based indicators 
show
 a rebound in global growth. 
With regard to advanced 
economies, 
GDP 
growth rebounded in the United States in the second quarter, as 
consumer spending and inventories recovered from previous weak outcomes, 
supported by the tightening labour market and strong household confidence. In 
Japan, activity grew strongly in the seco
nd quarter supported by a favourable 
external environment and fiscal stimulus. By contrast, activity in the U
nited 
Kingdom 
remain
ed relatively muted, as household incomes were affected by 
rising inflation 
and falling real wages. 
With regard to
 emerging 
mar
ket 
economies
, in Brazil and 
Russia, 
activity has been supported by the rebound
 in growth
 following
 deep recession
s, while economic growth remained
 resilient in India and China.
 Survey indicators suggest 
sustained global 
growth in the near term.
 The global
 composite output PMI (excluding the euro area) 
rose in August to just above the 
long
-term average. The survey indicates the fastest pace of expansion since early 
2015 (see Chart 1). S
entiment survey 
indicators 
have also 
risen over the past few 
months.

 Notes: The latest observations are for August 2017. ﬁLong
-term averageﬂ refers to the period from January 1999 to August 2017.
 Global 
financial conditions remain supportive
 overall.
 Equity markets in 
advanced economies 
were 
broadly un
changed over recent weeks amid subdued 
volatility and low risk aversion
. Long
-term interest rates in the United States and 
United Kingdom have moderated 
in 
the past couple of months. In Japan,
 yields were 
stable, reflecting the Bank of Japan™s yield curve control programme. 
Financial
 conditions in 
emerging market economies 
are 
also 
benefitting from expectations of 
a brighter global growth outlook 
amid resilie
nt 
capital f
lows. I
n China
, financial 
conditions have eased somewhat after a period in which authorities tightened 
financial conditions substantially in an effort to curb leverage in the financial system
. Monetary policies remain accommodative in advanced 
economies, and
 central 
banks in 
some emerging 
market 
economies have lowered
 their
 interest rates.
 In line with market expectations, t
he Federal Reserve 
System 
increased interest 
rates at its June meeting. It also announced the intention to start normalisin
g its 
balance sheet later this year. 
However, markets continue to price in a very gradual 
monetary tightening in the United States, while c
entral banks 
in other advanced 
economies are expected to 
maintain their accommodative stance.
 Among 
emerging 
market e
conomies
, some commodity
-export
ing countries
 lowered 
their 
policy rates, 
as inflation pressures subsided and exchange rates firmed.
 Looking ahead, global economic activity is 
projected 
to accelerate gradually.
 The outlook amongst advanced economies 
is for
 a modest expansion, underpinned 
by continued monetary and fiscal policy support, as the cyclical recovery continues 
and output gaps close
 gradually. Amongst 
emerging market economies
, the outlook 
is supported by resilient growth in China and India
, and th
e recovery of 
commodity
-export
ing countries
 from significant adverse 
shocks to their 
terms of trade. 
Nonetheless, the pace of global expansion wil
l remain below pre
-crisis rates, which 
is consistent with 
estimates 
suggesting 
that the growth potential has d
eclined across 
most advanced and emer
ging market economies in recent years. One of the factors

 7 behind this slowdown has been the weakness in capital contributions. 
Box 
1 elaborates on the factors underlying
 subdued investment in advanced economies.
 In the 
United States
, activity is expected to strengthen.
 The recent depreciation 
of the US dollar and the pick
-up in global growth 
are expected to
 boost the 
contribution of 
net exports
 to growth. 
Gains in housing and equity prices, coupled 
with 
buoyant 
consumer 
confidence and 
tight
 labour market conditions should all 
strengthen consumption spending further. With companies reporting 
improved 
earnings and solid business confidence, investment is projected to increase at a 
steady
 pace. 
However
, 
market 
expectations o
f a smaller fiscal stimulus will provide 
less impetus to economic activity than previously foreseen
. Moreover, in the near 
term there is some uncertainty about the impact of hurricane Harvey on economic 
activity in affected regions.
 In the United Kingdom, 
real GDP growth is expected to remain relatively muted 
in the near term
. Although the depreciation of the pound sterling is 
likely
 to support 
exports, the increase in inflation 
will lower
 real household incomes and 
private 
consumption. Heightened uncertainty about the 
United Kingdom™s 
future trade 
arrangements 
is also 
weighing on investment.
 In Japan, 
accommodative policies continue to support expansion.
 In the near 
term accommodative monetary policy and the 
fiscal s
timulus programme should 
support domestic demand, while exports gradually recover as external demand 
improves. 
Further ahead, however, activity is projected to decelerate towards its 
potential as 
fiscal support 
wanes and economic slack diminishes. Moreover
, de
spite 
robust job creation, wage increases have remained modest, dampening
 private 
consumption prospects.
 In 
China
, activity continues to expand at a robust pace
, supported by resilient 
consumption and the buoyant housing market.
 While fiscal policy sho
uld 
continue to be supportive, 
the focus of 
authorities on 
also 
containing financial 
stability risks 
is expected to 
underpin a gradual rebalanci
ng as investment slows.
 Central and eastern European countries benefit from strong 
consumption and 
investment
, t
he latter
 supported by EU structural funds
. Although inflation is 
foreseen 
to increase
 gradually
, reflecting 
the 
fading effects of energy price falls, real 
disposable income is forecast to support GDP growth on the back of 
a further 
strengthening of the la
bour market and growth
 in wages
. The l
arge commodity
-export
ing countries
 are continuing their recovery 
following deep recessions.
 In Russia, 
the rebound in activity since the start of the 
year is 
likely
 to continue
, supported by oil prices, a benign 
external 
environment and 
an accommodative monetary policy. Consumption 
should
 improve at modest rates in 
response to rising real wages and 
growing 
consumer confidence, albeit from very 
low levels. Fiscal challenges will continue to weigh on growth. 
Economi
c activity in 
Brazil is expected to benefit from s
tabilising business confidence
, 
improving terms of 
trade and loosening financial conditions
. At the same time, recurring political 
uncertainties and fiscal consolidation needs continue to weigh on the mediu
m-term 
outlook.

 8 Growth in g
lobal trade slowed during the second quarter
, but leading 
indicators 
continue to
 signal positive prospects.
 The volume of globa
l goods 
imports increased by 0.5
% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2017, which 
was below th
e pace of the previous quarter (see Chart 2). 
The slowdown in 
trade in 
merchandise was driven mainly by 
emerging market economies
. 
Leading indicators
, 
however, signal a positive outlook for global trade in the near term, with the 
global 
PMI
 for new export 
orders rising in August. Looking f
urther ahead, world trade 
is projected to expand
 broadly in line with global activity.

 Note: The latest observations are for August 2017 (PMIs) and June 2017 (trade).
 Overall, global growth is projected to increase gradually over 
the period 2017
-19. According to the September 2017 ECB staff macroeconomi
c projections, world 
real GDP growth (excluding the euro area) is projected to accelerate from 3.2% in 
2016 to 3.7% in 2017 and 3.8% in 2018
-19. Growth in euro area foreign demand is 
forecast to increase from 1.6% in 2016 to 4.7% in 2017, followed by growt
h of 3.4% 
in 2018 and 3.5% in 2019. Compared with the June 2017 projections, global GDP 
growth is largely unrevised, with downward revisions to prospects in the United 
States reflecting expectations of a smaller fiscal stimulus, which is offset by a 
bright
er outlook in some emerging market economies. Growth in euro area foreign 
demand has been revised 
upwards 
for 20
17, 
reflecting stronger 
import data
 in the 
first quarter.
 The uncertainty surrounding the baseline projections for global activity 
remains eleva
ted, with
 the balance of risks tilted to the downside.
 On the 
upside, there is 
a possibility that improved sentiment 
Œ as evidenced in surveys and 
financial markets 
Œ will 
translate into a faster
 revival of activity and trade in the short 
term. 
Key 
downside risks include an increase in trade protectionism
; 
a disorderly 
tightening of global financial conditions
, which could 
affect
 vulnerable 
emerging 
market economies 
in particular
; possible 
disruptions associated with China™s reform 
and liberalisation
 process
; and
 the potential for volatility derived from

 9 geopolitical uncertainties
, including those related to the negotiations on the future 
relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Finally, there is 
considerable uncertai
nty about the outlook for fiscal policy in the United States.
 Global price developments
 Global consumer price inflation 
remains relatively subdued.
 After falling during 
the early part of this year as the contribution of energy prices faded, a
nnual 
consumer
 price inflation in the OECD area 
rose slightly in July to 2.0% (see Chart 3). 
Excluding food and energy, OECD annual inflation 
was stable at 1.8% in July.

 Note: The latest observation is for July 2017.
 Oil prices have risen in recent weeks.
 After falling during the early weeks of the 
summer, B
rent crude oil 
prices have since 
recovered to 
around USD 52 per barrel. 
This increase reflected expectations of a moderately faster rebalancing of the oil 
market. 
US crude oil inventories
 fell by more than the market had expected, while 
oil 
demand 
was somewhat stronger 
in 
the second quarter of 2017. At 
the same time, 
supply constraints bolstered prices amid 
a slowdown in the growth rate of 
the 
US 
oil 
rig count and expectations 
that 
Saudi Arabia 
may curb
 exports of 
crude 
oil
. So far, 
Brent crude oil prices or futures quotations have not been affected by
 tropical 
storm 
Harvey, which 
hit
 the US Gulf of Mexico
. Looking ahead
, after a slight moderation in the near term, global inflation is 
expected 
to rise slowly.
 The oil futures curve 
indicates 
a modest increase in oil 
prices over the projection horizon,
 with
 energy prices
 providing a small positive 
contribution
 to inflation. At the same time, slowly diminishing spare capacity at the 
global level 
should support underlying inflation.

 Excess 
liquidity increased by about •100 billion, to around •1,770 billion. This increase is 
attributable to ongoing purchases under the expanded asset purchase programme. 
Liquidity conditions are discussed in more detail in Box 2.
 Spreads on
 bonds issued by NFCs declined marginally during the period 
under review (see Chart 7).
 On 6 September investment

(over the corresponding AAA

on average 
5 basis points 
lower 
than in 
early June and around 70 
basis points
 below their levels 
in March 2016, prior to the announcement and subsequent launch of the CSPP. 
Spreads on non

-grade NFC and financial sector debt also declined 
during the period under review, falling by 39 b
asis points and 6 basis points 
respectively. The low level and further compression of corporate bond spreads is 
consistent with a firming economic recovery.

 Euro area equity prices have decreased since early June (see Chart 8).
 Equity 
prices of euro area NFCs ended the review
 period around 3% lower, while share 
prices fell by 2.5% for financial corporations. The falls primarily reflect an increase in 
perceived geopolitical risk. Nevertheless, bank equity prices still stand around 65% 
higher overall than the low levels recorded
 in the aftermath of the United Kingdom™s 
referendum on EU membership in June 2016 (NFC equity prices are only 25% 
higher). By contrast with the falls in euro area NFC equity prices, the equity prices of 
US NFCs ended the review period 1.5% higher. One pos
sible reason for the 
underperformance of euro area NFC equities is that the appreciation of the euro 
exchange rate has dampened market expectations regarding short
-term earnings of 
firms that are heavily dependent on exports. Longer
-term earnings expectati
ons 
have, however, remained strong and have continued to support NFC equity prices. 
Market expectations regarding equity price volatility in the euro area 
increased 
in

 In foreign exchange markets, the euro

macroeconomic outlook. In
 bilateral terms, since

 the euro 
has strengthened 
by 
6.3% against the

Chinese renminbi (by 2.0%), as well as the currencies of other economies in Asia, 
whereas it has slightly depreciated vis
-à-vis the currencie

EU Member States
. The appreciation of the euro vis

driven by three forces, of roughly equal strength: the 
improve

growth prospects, a tightening in the monetary policy stance 
relative to
 the United

, and 
an exogenous component 
possibly reflecting improved market sentiment

 remained the engine for growth, 
alongside a smaller contribution from net exports, whereas changes in inventories 
provided a small negative contribution. On the production side, economic activity 
was br

has shown a marked
 decline
 after peaking at 12.1% in the second quarter 
of 2013. In 
July 2017 the 
unemployment rate
 stood at 9.
1%, the lowest 
level
 since 
February
 2009. 
Survey
 data
 available up to August 2017 point to 
further improvements 
in labour market 
conditions, with increasin
g reports of labour shortages across the large euro area 
economies
. The swift decline in euro area unemployment is particularly encouraging 
against a background of increasing labour supply
. The increase in labour supply, 
which has continued throughout the 
crisis
 and into the recovery
, can primarily be 
explained by growing labour force participation rates for older workers and women 
(see Box
 3 entitled ﬁRecent developments in euro area labour supplyﬂ in this issue of 
the Economic Bulletin). Nevertheless,
 bro
ader measures of unemployment suggest 
that slack is still elevated in many euro area labour markets. A survey of large euro 
area firms (see Box
 5 entitled ﬁ
Structural reform needs in the euro area: insights from 
a survey of large 
companiesﬂ
 in this issue o
f the Economic Bulletin) suggests that 
further structural reforms to euro area labour markets would improve their functioning 
and strengthen the broader growth outlook.

 Euro area housing market deve
lopments continue to support the growth 
momentum
. Housing investment increased by 1.3% in the second quarter of 2017, 
reflecting a continuation of the recovery in the euro area and in many euro area 
countries. 
This recovery, albeit from very low levels
 in 
some countries
, has been 
supported by
 the
 strong growth 
in household
 disposable income,
 improved labour 
market conditions,
 favourable financing conditions and an increased preference for 
housing investment in the context of low yields on interest
-bearing a
ssets. In 
addition, 
business confidence 
has risen
 very
 strongly 
in the construction sector. 
Moreover, the rising number of building permits issued,
 increasing demand for loans 
for house purchase
 and improved bank lending conditions
 should 
continue to 
suppo
rt the 
broad
-based
 upward 
trend in
 euro area housing investment.
 Business investment rebounded in the second quarter of 2017.
 The increase 
(1.0%, quarter on quarter) was driven by investment in intellectual property products; 
and machinery, equipment and weapons systems, other than transport equipment. 
Moreover, data such as industrial production in the capital goods sector 
Œ which 
grew by 0.7%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2017

-up in euro area business investment.

 18 investment. Some factors, however, are expected to continue to weigh on the 
outlook for business investment. These include expectations of weaker long
-ter
m growth potential than in the past, rigidities in product markets and the slow pace of 
change
 in the regulatory environment.
 Low 
bank profitability and the still high 
level 
of 
non-performing loans on banks™ balance sheets in a number of countries 
are also
 expected to 
continue to weigh on the intermediation capacity of banks and

 Euro area trade has continued to rebound.
 Euro area exports of goods and 
services rose by 1.1%, quarter on quarter, in the s
econd quarter of 2017 and the 
momentum in extra
-euro area trade in goods has been improving steadily since the 
summer of 2016. According to monthly trade data, extra
-euro area goods exports in 
the first half of 2017 were driven mainly by exports to China, 
the rest of Asia and 
non-euro area EU Member States. 
This 
bodes well for the overall growth outlook, as
 euro area foreign demand 
has 
become increasingly broad
-based. Short
-term 
indicators such as s
urveys and new export orders with a bearing on the 
second h
alf 
of 2017 point to 
sustained export momentum, despite the recent strengthening of the 
effective exchange rate of the euro (see Chart
 13).
 Looking further ahead, 
the broad
-based global recovery will support euro area exports
. 
However, risks to trade remai
n elevated and primarily relate to geopolitical tensions that have the potential to 
hamper global growth.

 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro a
rea annual HICP inflation in August 
2017 was 1.5
%, 
up from 
1.3% in 
July
. Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil 
futures prices, 
annual rates of headline inflation are likely to temporarily decline 
towards the turn of the year, mainly reflecting base effects in energy prices.
 At the 
same time, measures of underlying inflation have ticked up moderately in recent 
months, but have yet 
to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. 
The 
September
 2017 ECB
 staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee 
annual HICP inflation at 
1.5
% in 2017, 
1.2
% in 2018 and 
1.5
% in 2019.
 Headline inflation increased in August.
 According t
o Eurostat™s flash estimate, 
headline HICP inflation 
rose to 1.5% in August, after standing at 1.3% in June and 
July
 (see Chart
 16). 
This reflected higher energy and, to a lesser extent, higher 
processed food inflation. 
The increase
 in energy inflation was
 anticipated, as it 
reflect
s the impact of an upward base effect and 
the upward pressure stemming from 
the latest increases in oil prices.

 August 2017 (flash estimate) for HICP excluding food and energy
, and July 2017 for all other

 The recent appreciation of the euro implies some moderation in price 
press
ures at the early stages of the production and pricing chain.
 The appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) of the euro in recent 
months 
has started to 
exert downward pressure on import prices. 
The annual 
change
 in import prices 
of non
-foo
d consumer goods 
decreased from 1.3% in April to 
0.1% in 
July (see Chart
 18). This downward pressure will 
mitigate
 the upward 
pressure resulting from the strong pick
-up in global non
-energy producer price 
inflation 
that began in 
mid
-2016. Despite strong 
pipeline pressures
 from the external 
side, which may now ease somewhat,
 domestic producer prices 
for non
-food 
consumer goods have remained broadly stable, with
 only 
a marginal upward 
movement 
from 0.2% in May to 
0.3% in
 June and
 July. The pass
-through of the
 recent
 euro
 appreciation on domestic pipeline pressures is surrounded by a large 
degree of uncertainty and also depends on a potential adjustment of profit margins.

. Wage growth 
remains subdued
. The annual change in n

1.4% in the s

quarter of 2017, down slightly from 1.6%, but was 
unchanged when volatile one

employee ha
s also remained low up to the first quarter of 2017 but has diverged 
from compensation per hour owing to the 
decline in the average

 In general, factors that may have been holding back wage

 the still signi

, 
low inflation, weak

 Note: The latest observations are for 
6 September
 2017. Looking ahead, 
the increase in 
HICP inflation in the euro area is 
expected to be 
slightly lower than previously expected.
 On the basis of the infor
mation available 
in mid
-August
, the 
Septemb
er 2017 ECB
 staff macroeconomic projections for the 
euro area foresee HICP inflation 
to be 
1.5% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019
 (see Chart
 20).
2 By 
comparison with the June 2017 Eurosystem
 staff 
macroeconomic projections, the outlook 
for headline 
HICP inflation has been revised 
down slightly, mainly reflecting the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate.
 Base effects imply a significant drop in the contribution from HICP energy 
inflation 
to 
headline inflation between 
the last quarter of 
2017 and the first quarter of 
2018 (see 
also the box entitled ﬁ
The role of base effects in the projected path of HICP inflation
ﬂ in this issue of the Economic Bulletin)
. The assumed increase, albeit modest, in oil 
prices over the remainder of the projection hor
izon, as reflected in the oil price 
futures curve, implies some rebound in
 HICP energy inflation in 2019.
 HICP inflation excluding energy and food is
 expected to 
rise gradually over the 
medium term
. HICP inflation excluding energy and food is
 envisaged to 
be 1.1% in 
2017, 1.3% in 2018 and 1.5
% in 
2019. 
While the euro exchange rate appreciation 
will exert downward pressures on underlying inflation over the projection horizon, this 
is partially offset by an improved outlook 
for
 euro area domestic demand
. On t
he 
domestic cost side, one important
 factor behind th
e gradual pick
-up in underlying 
inflation 
is the envisaged 
reduction in
 labour market 
slack 
and the 
increasing labour 
supply shortages in some parts of the euro area
, which
 are 
expected to drive an 
uptur
n in wage growth. Beyond this, the recent significant 
rise
 in headline inflation 
can 
also 
be expected to translate 
over time 
into higher nominal wage increases in 
                                                                    2  See the

 26 5 Money and credit
 Money growth expanded at the robust pace generally witnessed since mid
-2015 in 
the second quarter of 2017 and showed a moderation in July. The recovery in loan 
growth to the private sector continued to 
proceed
. And the 
annual flow of total 
external financing to non
-financial corporations (NFCs) is estimated to have eased 
somewhat in the second quarter of 2017.
 Broad money growth was robust at 5% in the second quarter of 2017, in line 
with its expansion
 since mid
-2015, an
d then moderated in July.
 The annual 
growth rate of M3 decreased to 4.5% in July 2017, likely on account of temporary 
factors (see Chart 21). The low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid 
instruments in an environment of very low interest rates, as w
ell as the impact of the 
ECB™s monetary policy measures, continued to lend support to money growth. 
However, the contribution of the most liquid components to annual 
M3 
growth
 decreased, with the annual growth rate of M1 declining to 9.1% in July (compared
 with 9.3% in the second quarter of 2017 and 9.7% in June).
 Chart 21

 (annual percentage changes; adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects)
  Source: ECB.
 Notes: Loans are adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and 
notional cash pooling. The latest observation is for July 2017.
 Overnight deposits continued to be the main driver of M3 growth.
 Specifically, 
the annual growth rate of overnight deposits held by households and non
-financial 
corporations remained strong in the second quarter of 2017 but softened in July 
2017, likely owing to temporary factors. The annual growth rate of currency in 
circulation also decreased in July, indicating no tendency on the part of the money
-holding sector to substitute deposits with cash in an environment of very low or 
negative interest rates. Short
-term deposits other than overnight deposits (i.e. M2 
minus M
1) continued to have a negative impact on M3 in the second quarter and in 
July. The annual rate of change of marketable instruments (i.e. M3 minus M2) 
Œ a small component of M3 
Œ became significantly negative in July, contributing to the 
moderation in M3 g
rowth observed at this time. This development followed a positive 
contribution in the second quarter of 2017 and was mainly driven by a further decline

 27 in monetary financial institutions™ (MFIs) issuance of short
-term debt securities. In 
contrast, the annu
al growth rate of money market fund shares/units
 remained 
positive.
 Domestic sources of money creation were again the main driver of broad 
money growth (see Chart 22).
 From a counterpart perspective, the Eurosystem™s 
purchases of general government debt se
curities (see the red parts of Chart 22), 
conducted mainly in the context of the ECB™s public sector purchase programme 
(PSPP), contributed positively to M3 growth.
3 The ongoing recovery in credit to the 
private sector (see the 
blue parts of Chart 22) also
 continued to support M3 growth. 
This includes both MFI loans to the private sector as well as MFI holdings of debt 
securities issued by the euro area private non
-MFI sector. As such, it also covers the 
Eurosystem™s purchases of debt securities under the c
orporate sector purchase 
programme (CSPP). Longer
-term financial liabilities and other counterparts together 
had a slightly negative effect on M3 growth as a result of the other counterparts 
(mainly repurchase agreements) (see the dark green parts of Chart
 22). The 
persistent contraction in MFIs™ longer
-term financial liabilities (excluding capital and 
reserves), however, helped to increase M3 growth. The annual rate of change of 
such liabilities has been negative since the second quarter of 2012, partly ow
ing to 
the impact of the ECB™s targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO
-II), 
which may be acting as a substitute for longer
-term market
-based bank funding. 
Finally, government bond sales from euro area MFIs excluding the Eurosystem 
contributed to
 the negative annual growth of credit to general government by MFIs 
excluding the Eurosystem and thus dampened M3 growth (see the light green parts 
of Chart 22).
                                                                     3  See also the box entitled ﬁBase 
money, broad money and the APPﬂ in this Economic Bulletin, which 
describes the development of base money during recent years and the impact of the ECB™s non
-standard measures on base money developments.

 Notes: Credit to the private sector includes MFI loans to the private sector and MFI holdings of debt securities issued by th

private non
-MFI sector. It thus includes the Eurosystem™s
 holdings of debt securities in the context of the corporate sector purchase 
programme (CSPP). The latest observation is for July 2017.
 MFIs™ net external assets still
 weighed on annual M3 growth.
 While the annual 
flow of net external assets remained negat
ive in the second quarter of 2017 and in 
July, a monthly inflow was registered in July 2017. This helped to lower the related 
downward pressure on M3 growth (see the yellow parts of Chart 22). The annual 
flow 
continued to reflect
 capital outflows from the 
euro area, which were partly 
explained by PSPP
-related sales of euro area government bonds by non
-residents. 
Recent developments suggest no major PSPP
-related Eurosystem purchases from 
non-residents.
 The recovery in loan growth observed since the beginning
 of 2014 
has been 
proceed
ing
. The annual growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for 
loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling) was broadly stable in the 
second quarter of 2017 and in July (see Chart 21). Across sectors, the ann
ual growth 
of loans to non
-financial corporations increased to 2.4% in both periods, following a 
temporary decline in June on account of special effects in some countries (see Chart 
23). The growth of loans to NFCs has recovered significantly from the trou
gh in the 
first quarter of 2014. This development is broad
-based across the largest countries, 
although loan growth rates are still negative in some jurisdictions. The annual growth 
rate of loans to households also increased in the second quarter of 2017, 
standing at 
2.6% in July (see Chart 24). The significant decrease in bank lending rates seen 
across the euro area since summer 2014 (notably owing to the ECB™s non
-standard 
monetary policy measures) and overall improvements in the supply of, and demand 
for
, bank loans have supported these trends. In addition, banks have made progress 
in consolidating their balance sheets, although the level of non
-performing loans 
remains high in some countries and may constrain bank lending.

 Banks™ composite cost of debt 
financing declined to a new historical low in July, after broadly stabilising in the 
second quarter of 2017 (see Chart 25). This trend was mainly driven by 
developments in the cost of deposits, which decreased marginally to a
 new historical 
low in July after pursuing a broadly stable path in the second quarter of 2017. In 
addition, bank bond yields generally stayed steady in the second quarter, despite a 
temporary increase in June, and declined in July. The ECB™s accommodative

the strengthening of bank balance sheets and receding fragmentation across

 Notes: The composite cost of deposits is calculated as an a
verage of new business rates on overnight deposits, deposits with an 
agreed maturity and deposits redeemable at notice, weighted by their corresponding outstanding amounts. The latest observatio
n is 
for July 2017.
 Bank lending rates for NFCs and households
 remained at or close to their 
historical lows in the second quarter of 2017 and in July (see charts 26 and 
27).
 Composite bank lending rates for both NFCs and households declined between 
early 2014 and end
-2016 but have since moved differently, with the c
omposite bank 
lending rate for housing loans increasing slightly until July 2017 and the composite 
bank lending rate for NFC loans declining further to reach a new historical low in 
July. Overall, composite bank lending rates for loans to NFCs and househol
ds have 
decreased by significantly more than market reference rates since the ECB™s credit 
easing measures were announced in June 2014; signalling an improvement in the 
pass
-through of monetary policy measures to bank lending rates. The 
aforementioned decr
ease in banks™ composite funding costs has supported the 
decline in composite lending rates. Between May 2014 and July 2017, composite 
lending rates on loans to NFCs and households fell by 119 basis points and 103 
basis points, respectively. The reduction 
in bank lending rates on NFC loans was 
particularly strong in vulnerable euro area countries, supporting a more 
homogeneous transmission of monetary policy to such rates across countries. Over 
the same period, the spread between interest rates charged on v
ery small loans 
(loans of up to •0.25 million) and those charged on large loans 
(loans of above •1 
million)
 in the euro area narrowed considerably and stood close to its historical low in 
July 2017. This indicates that small and medium
-sized enterprises ha
ve generally 
benefited to a greater extent from the decline in bank lending rates than large 
companies.

 The annual flow of total external financing to euro area NFCs is es

 This moderation 
reflects a weakening in both bank lending dynamics and debt securities issuance, 
partly attributable to special factors and of a temporary nature in the case of bank 
loans.
 Overall, the recovery in NFCs™ external financing observed since early 2014

mergers and
 acquisitions. At the same time, NFCs™ record high cash holdings have 
reduced the need for external financing.
 Gross issuance of debt securities by NFCs was subdued in July and August 
2017, after strengthening in June.
 The latest ECB data indicate that iss
uance 
activity was robust in June, following moderations in April and May. Having said this, 
issuance activity was negative on a net basis owing to significant redemptions of 
short
-term paper. In addition, it should be noted that the market data pointing t
o low 
issuance activity in July and August largely reflect seasonal factors. Around this time,
 net issuance of listed shares by NFCs was more buoyant than in the first months of 
2017, when it was dampened by significant share buy
-backs. 
 Financing costs fo
r NFCs remain favourable.
 The overall nominal cost of external 
financing for NFCs, comprising bank lending, debt issuance i
n the market and equity 
finance, 
is estimated to have declined slightly to 4.4% in August 2017, after 
increasing moderately in June a
nd July. These developments largely reflect 
developments in the cost of equity. The cost of financing now stands 40 basis points 
above its historical low of July 2016, but remains considerably lower than the level 
observed in summer 2014 (before markets st
arted to price in 
expectations about the 
asset purchase 
programme
). The cost of debt, expressed as the weighted average 
of the cost of bank lending and the cost of market
-based debt,
 is still fluctuating 
around its historical low.

 The
 euro area budget deficit is 
foreseen
 to 
decline
 further over the projection horizon 
(201
7-19) owing to
 improving cyclical conditions and decreasing interest payments. 
The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is projected to be 
mildly expansionary 
in 
2017 and broadly neutral in 2018
-19. 
Although the e
uro area government debt
-to
-GDP ratio
 will continue to decline
, it is still
 elevated.
 In particular the countries with 
high debt levels would 
benefit from
 additional consolidation efforts to set their public 
debt ratio firmly on a downward path.
 The euro area general government budget deficit is 
forecast
 to 
gradually 
decline
 over the projection horizon.
 Based on the 
September
 201
7 ECB
 staff 
macroeconomic projections
,4 the general government deficit ratio for the euro area is 
expected to 
fall from 1.5% of GDP 
in 2016 to 0.9% of GDP in 2019 
(see the table). 
The improvement
 in the fiscal outlook, which is slightly better compared with the
 June 2017 projections, 
is mainly 
supported by favourable cyclical conditions
 and declining interest payments.

measures, such as government support for the fina
ncial sector. For more details on the concept of the

 34 in revenues and government expenditures
. At the same time, the broadly neutral 
fiscal stance indicates that countries are not making full use of the favourable 
economic growth m
omentum to build up fiscal buffers.
 The high e
uro area government debt 
levels are expected to continue to fall
. The euro area debt
-to
-GDP ratio, which peaked in 2014, 
is predicted to decline from 
89.1% of GDP in 2016 to 
84.2% of GDP by the end of 2019
. Th
e decline
 is supported 
mainly 
by 
a rise in the primary surplus and a 
favourable interest rate
-growth differential, 
the latter reflecting the relatively stable
 macroeconomic outlook
. 
The 
deficit
-debt adjustments
 are expected to have a small negative impact a
s of 
2018. 
While the outlook has changed little from the one in 
the 
June
 exercise
, the 
debt level in 2017 is expected to be somewhat lower reflecting in particular a more 
favourable interest rate
-growth differential. The debt outlook, when considered from 
a country perspective
, 
is forecast
 to 
improve
 in the majority of euro area countries, 
while in 
a few countries the government debt ratio is expected to increase over the 
projection horizon.
 In particular the countries with high debt levels would benefit fr
om 
additional consolidation efforts to set their public debt ratio firmly on a downward 
path.
 This would help to reduce their vulnerability 
should there be renewed financial 
market instability or a rebound in interest rates.
  All euro area countries would 
benefit from stepping up efforts towards 
achieving a more growth
-friendly composition of public finances.
 Shifting 
expenditure to the most growth
-enhancing categories, such as education and 
infrastructure, or the tax burden to less distortive taxes like co
nsumption or property 
taxes can exert positive effects on output growth and thereby contribute to the 
building
-up of fiscal buffers.
7 Looking ahead, i
t will be important that the draft budgetary plans
, to be
 submitted 
by mid
-October
, are in full compliance
 with the requirements
 of the 
Stability and Growth Pact
. The process around the draft budgetary plans, if fully 
and consistently implemented, is an important and effective early warning and 
correction tool. Following the submission of the draft budgetary plans by the euro 
area countries, the Commission will ass
ess whether they are fully in line with the 
requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. In the event of non
-compliance, the 
Commission will have to send the draft budgetary plans back to the countries 
concerned.

 Investment dynamics in advanced economies since the financial crisis

 1 Investment dynamics in advanced eco
nomies since the 
financial crisis
 This box aims to shed 
some 
light from a cross
-country perspective on the shocks 
affecting investment in advanced economies 
since the financial crisis
. It is often argued that one of the key factors holding back the global 
economic 
recovery in the current economic cycle has been the 
subdued pace
 of 
investment activity, particularly in advanced economies
. This 
has been
 attributed to
 impaired financial markets, public sector budget constraints, heightened 
policy uncertainty an
d weak economic prospects. At the same time th
e lack of 
dynamism 
in the business sector appears 
more accentuated than in previous 
recoveries, which
, together with the sharper decline in investment expenditure 
in the 
aftermath of the Great Recession, has le
d to
 significant investment gaps
, i.e. 
persistently negative deviations from long
-term averages
. The usual pattern in business investment of reaching a trough 
soon
 after a 
recession and returning relatively 
quickly
 to pre
-recession 
levels 
did not 
materiali
se to the same extent 
after the Great Recession.
8 While this
 pattern was 
visible in 
business cycles in 
the 1990s and early 2000s, 
it has not been seen
 in the 
current cycle
: the initial rebound in investment after the trough in the first quarter of 
2009 was
 interrupted by a second recession in the euro area amid the sovereign 
debt crisis. Th
is pause in the recovery 
can be observed
 in 
Chart
 A, which depicts the 
ratio of investment 
to
 GDP
 in advanced economies
. 
This ratio
 started 
to decline 
from 
a relatively l
ow 
level (12.5%) 
compared 
with
 past cycles 
and
 fell to close to 10
.5
% in 
2009. At this level, business investment initiated a sustained and quick recovery that 
was halted by the euro area sovereign debt crisis. 
The ratio 
of investment
 then 
recorded a 
renewed decline between the second half of 2015 and the end of 2016. 
This was mainly 
caused
 by commodity producers, 
such as
 Canada, Australia and to 
a lesser extent the 
United States
, 
reducing their investment, in part because of 
the 
sharp 
fall in commodity pri
ces (particular
ly oil)
 to very low levels
. Only very recently, 
at 
the beginning of 2017
, 
did 
a rebound 
in 
investment emerge
. Overall, 
however, 
the 
ratio of business investment 
to
 GDP 
in advanced economies was 
still below its long
-term average in 
the first 
quarter of 2017
.                                                                     8  The concept of investment 
adopted here
 is business investment (private non
-residential)
 and
 includes 
private sector investment 
in structures, equipment (information, industrial and transportation) and 
intell
ectual property rights
. The
 concept may vary marginally across countries

 areas refer 
to 
a combined indicator 
for the periods of recession in the
 euro area 
(Centre for Economic Policy Research) 
and the United States
 (National Bureau for Economic Research)
. The latest
 observation 
is for the first quarter of 2017
. Four factors 
have 
commonly 
been
 considered as potential drivers of 
investment at a macroeconomic level, namely demand expectations, financial 
conditions, uncertainty and supply shocks
.9 Since the financial crisis these
 factors have been 
central to
 the debate on investment, from both a t
heoretical and 
an empirical perspective. 
Tight financial conditions 
and negative demand shocks 
are 
seen as
 detrimental 
to
 business investment.
10 In particular, weakening economic 
prospects globally are expected to lead to 
a decline in the returns on investm
ent, th
ereby
 dampen
ing
 the formation of new capital and delay
ing
 the 
replacement
 of old 
capital. 
Uncertainty shocks 
may
 also have 
persistently negative effects on business 
investment.
11 Finally, unexpected negative supply shock
s, such as the fall in 
labour 
productivity
 across countries,
 could diminish
 future profit 
expectations and 
lead to a 
decline
 in investment activity
. The patterns of investment following the various shocks considered are 
empirically confirmed by i
mpulse response functions
. Based on the 
model used, 
the main findings are
 that
 uncertainty 
shock
s have a persistent
ly hump

 professional forecasters; financial 
conditions, financial condition indices based on short

and

prices; expected growth; 
and 
price devel
opments
. Structural shock identification is achieved by means 
of zero, sign and magnitude restrictions.
 10  As uncertainty and financial variables are highly correlated, relative magnitude restrictions 
are used 
to 
identify structurally meaningful shocks

 37 pro
ductivity continuously
 raises 
business investment
. Across countries, 
demand 
factors 
have been 
the most 
important driver of investment, 
account
ing
 for 
more than 
half 
of the variance in the U
nited 
States,
 the U
nited 
Kingdom
 and Japan, 
whereas in 
Canada it wa
s only 
about 
40% 
(after 16 quarters
). 
The second most relevant 
determinant is supply factors (
in the U
nited 
States
 and the U
nited 
Kingdom)
, 
uncertainty 
(Canada
) and financial factors 
(Japan
). During the Great Recession adverse demand factors were 
clearly 
the main 
driver 
of the downturn in business investment in 
the sample of
 countries
 analysed; however
, 
in the post
-crisis period
, 
developments across countries 
have been
 more heterogeneous 
(see Chart
 B).13 By 2012 US 
investment ratios
 had returned to their 
tr
end, and fluctuated around that level thereafter
. 
The model 
indicates that receding negative 
demand
, declining uncertainty and
 favourable 
financial 
conditions 
contributed to the recovery
. In 2015, however, investment 
weakened again, partly owing to the fal
l in oil prices and its strong impact on 
investment in the US shale oil industry. I
n Japan
, the recovery
 was mainly 
driven by 
more 
positive 
financial conditions, linked to monetary easing, and less negative 
demand
 expectations
. 
In Canada
, on the other hand
, the investment ratio 
recovered 
quickly after the Great Recession and moved above trend levels 
until the second half 
of 2014
. The model suggests that business investment was buoyed by p
ositive 
demand 
prospects
, low uncertainty and 
accommodative
 financial 
conditions, 
supported by strong 
commodit
y price developments
. 
The fall in commodity prices in 
2015 led to a sharp fall in business investment, which was later accentuated by a 
rise in 
uncertainty
 and tighter financial conditions
. By contrast, the 
investment ratio in 
the 
United 
Kingdom
 mostly remained below its 
long
-term levels
. The model suggests 
that 
both negative demand and supply shocks 
more than offset the somewhat 
favourable financial conditions 
and the support provided by an environment of 
low uncertainty. More recently, in the second half of 2016, increased uncertainty following 
the 
outcome of the United Kingdom™s 
referendum 
on membership of the European 
Union
 brought
 the investment ratio
 down
. 
At the start of 
201
7 investment ratio
s were
 arou
nd trend levels in the 
United States
 and the United Kingdom, 
and above trend in 
Japan, while in Canada the investment gap was negative
. Extending the analysis to the euro area confirms the role of demand factors as 
the main driver of the downturn in busine
ss investment following the financial 
crisis.
 However, in contrast to other advanced economies, 
the recovery in the 
investment ratio came to a halt when the sovereign debt crisis intensified. This led to 
renewed negative and persistent demand shocks, toget
her with negative economic 
uncertainty and financial shocks until early 2015. By early 201
7, the euro area 
investment ratio was slightly above trend levels, pushed by favourable financial 
conditions and subdued uncertainty
.                                                                     13  Results are robust to different measures of uncertainty (economic policy uncertainty), demand and 
financial factors (including survey measures and activity indicators) and price measures (producer 
prices)

 reserve maintenance periods of 201
7, which ran from 
3 May 
to 
13 June
 2017 and from 1
4 June to 2

 2017 respectively.
 During this period
, the 
interest rates on the main refinancing operations (MROs), the marginal lending 
facility and the deposit facility remained unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and 
-0.40% 
respectively.
 In 
parallel
, the Eurosyste

purchasing
 public sector securities, covered 
bonds, asset
-backed securities and corporate sector securities as part of its 
expanded asset purchase programme (APP), with a target of •
60 billion of 
purchases on average per month
. Liquidity needs
 In the period under review, the average daily liquidity needs of the banking 
system, defined as the sum of autonomous factors and reserve requirements, 
stood at •
1,168.7
 billion, an increase of •
82.5
 billion compared with the 
previous review period (i.e. t
he 
first
 and 
second 
maintenance periods of 
2017). This increase in liquidity needs was attributable almost exclusively to an increase in

 broadly 
unchanged from the previous review period.
 That volatility primarily reflected 
fluctuations in 
both 
government deposits 
and net assets denominated in euro.

 The average amount of liquidity provided through open market operations 
Œ both tender operations and the 
outright APP

 Excess liquidity
 As a consequence of the developments detailed above, average excess 
liquidity in the period under review rose by •
231 billion
 compared with the 
previous period,
 to stand at •1,
645.8
 billion (see 
the c

 As mentioned above, 
this
 increase 
largely reflects 
the liquidity provided 
through the APP at a pace of 
•60 billion per month, as well as the allotment of 
•233.4
 billion from the fourth
 TLTRO

somewhat offset by an increase in liquidity needs resulting from autonomous factors
. Focusing only on the period under review, a more detailed analysis shows that 
excess liquidity 
increase
d in the 
third
 maintenance period,
 growing
 by •
139.8
 billion 
on account of liquidity provided by the 
fourth TLTRO
-II operation and the APP 
purchases. The fourth maintenance period, however, saw a small decline in excess 
liquidity of 
•8.3
 billion, as the liquidity injected via the APP purch
ases was more than 
offset by the increase in the liquidity
-absorbing effect of autonomous factors and a 
decrease in the take
-up of MROs and three
-month LTROs, as mentioned earlier
. The increase in excess liquidity 
corresponded
 to 
higher average current acc
ount 
holdings, which rose by •
153 billion to stand at •
1,174
 billion in the period under 
review
, while the a
verage recourse to the deposit facility increased by •
79.9
 billion to 
stand at •
594.5
 billion.
 Interest rate developments
 Overnight money market rat
es remained close to the deposit facility rate
, with 
some rates falling below it for specific collateral baskets in the secured 
segments
. In the unsecured market, the EONIA (euro overnight index average) 
averaged 
-0.35
8%, down marginally from an average of
 -0.3
54% in the previous 
review period. The EONIA fluctuated within a relatively narrow range, with a high of 
-0.3
31% ahead of the Whit Monday holiday in early June 2017
 and the historical
 low 
of 
-0.3
73% in its immediate aftermath
. Furthermore, in the secu
red market, average 
overnight repo rates in the GC Pooling market declined slightly to
 stand at
 -0.4
33% for the standard collateral basket, down 0.0
01 percentage point
s relative to the 
previous review period
, while for the extended collateral basket the re
spective 
average overnight repo rate stood at 
-0.401%, up 0.002
 percentage points compared 
with the previous review period
. The 
June 2017
 quarter
-end decline in the core repo rates was 
relatively mild 
compared 
with
 the 
2016 year
-end decline and the March 
2017 quarter
-end decline.
 This suggests 
that market participants 
have adopted more efficient collateral 
management practices. 
Moreover, this development 
also suggests 
positive effects 
from the cash

 Recent developments in euro area labour supply
 44 3 Recent 
developments in euro area labour supply
 Labour supply developments are
 an important 
driver of both the economic 
recovery and longer
-term growth
. On the structural side, labour supply 
can be a
 signific
ant contributor to potential growth
, while,
 from a cycli
cal perspective
, it 
has a 
direct 
impact
 on employment and unemployment. 
Furthermore, it is not only the size
 of the labour force that matters, but also its composition. Labour supply in the euro 
area has been increasing for a long time, but, while this has
 continued during the 
recent recovery, its growth rate has moderated in comparison with both the pre
-crisis 
and crisis periods (see Chart A). This box looks at the factors underlying the 
increasing labour supply over the course of the economic recovery and
 the 
moderation in its growth rate, as well as the changes in its composition.

countries
 (average year
-on-year growth rates, percentages)

national accounts and short
-term statistics.
 Note: The labour force is defined as the sum of employment as measured by national accounts and the number of unemployed.
 Although the labour supply in the euro area is continuing to rise, over the past 
decade t
here has been moderation in the rate at which it is increasing
. In the 
immediate aftermath of the Great Recession, the average growth rate of the labour 
force moderated in all of the largest euro area countries compared with the pre
-crisis 
period. This mod
eration continued in the recovery period (from the third quarter of 
2013 to the first quarter of 2017), with the notable exception of Germany, where 
there has been an acceleration in labour force growth that now exceeds the rates of 
expansion seen before t
he crisis. The weakening in labour force developments was 
most dramatic in Spain, which can be explained primarily by the effect of changing 
migration flows. Before the crisis, there was significant net inward migration to Spain, 
which reversed after Spain
 experienced a marked increase in its unemployment rate. 
This had a large negative impact on both the working age population and labour 
supply in Spain, and was also reflected in euro area labour supply developments. In 
the euro area as a whole, however, i
mmigration has made a large positive 
contribution to the working age population during the recovery, reflecting primarily 
the inflow of workers from new EU Member States. In turn, this is likely to also have

 Recent developments in euro area labour supply
 45 had a significant impact on the labour force, pa
rticularly in Germany and Italy, but 
also in some smaller euro area economies. 
 Since the start of the recovery, the rise in the participation rate has been a very 
important driver of growth in the labour force (see Chart B)
. The change in the 
labour force
 can be decomposed into contributions from changes in the working age 
population (15
-64) on one hand and the participation rate on the other. The 
slowdown in the growth of labour supply compared to the pre
-crisis period reflects a 
moderation of growth in b
oth the working age population and the participation rate, 
although the contribution from both components has remained positive over the 
course of the recovery. However, the largest contribution to the growth in the labour 
force has come from the rising pa
rticipation rate.

-64 age group. Non
-seasonally adjusted data.
 The change in the labour force can be decomposed into the change in the 
working age population and the change in the participation rate. The latter can be decomposed further into developments in th
e relative sizes of the age groups in the population and c
hanges in the participation rates of the different age groups. For the 
calculations, we used five
-year age groups. The residual includes other compositional changes, for example by gender. 
 The euro area labour force 
is 
ageing
, and
 more people are remainin
g economically active later in life
. The share of those aged 50
-64 in the 15
-64 labour 
force has increased from 30% to 32% over the course of the recovery, following a 
longer
-term upward trend.
14 As this age group has traditionally had relatively low 
labour
 force participation rates, its increasing share of the population might be 
expected to reduce the overall labour force participation rate. However, participation 
rates have increased among those aged 50
-64 in the past four years (between the 
second quarte
r of 2013 and the first quarter of 2017 the participation rate increased 
by 0.7, 3.8 and 7.6 percentage points in the 50

in the older generations reflects the fact that the post

 Recent developments in euro area labour supply
 46 respectively), driven by the increasing pension age in most countries, as well as 
other factors, for exa
mple the increasing education level of the population (which is 
discussed later). This is driving up the overall participation rate, counterbalancing the 
otherwise negative impact of the changing age composition (see the red bar in Chart 
B). Furthermore, t
he declining share in the population of the 15
-24 age group has 
also contributed to the increase in the overall participation rate, as this age group 
typically has a relatively low participation rate. This positive compositional effect, 
however, has been p
artly offset by a decline in the group™s participation rate since 
2008. Continuing a long
-term trend, the increase in the labour force during the 
economic recovery has been driven by the participation of women
. While the 
increasing share of the older age g
roups is characteristic of both genders, for 
women, growth in the participation rate over the course of the recovery has been 
larger and the decline in the prime
-age labour force has been smaller (see Chart C). 
The rising participation rate for women and t
he way in which female participation 
differs from male participation are explained to a large degree by diverging 
developments in the educational levels of men and women. The share of women 
with tertiary education in the female working age population is gr
eater than the 
corresponding share for men.
15 It has also increased more steeply over the last 
decade in both the prime and older age categories and is a major driver of the 
increasing female participation in the labour force.
16                                                                     15  In the working age population, the share of those with tertiary education is only lower for women than 
for 
men in the older (55
-64) age range, but the gap with men has been closing considerably over the 
last decade.

 Cyclical effects have contributed to d
iverging developments in 
prime
-age 
male 
and female participation rates.
 The participation rate 
of prime
-age males has been 
declining since the start of the crisis, likely driven by the cyclical decline in 
employment in sectors and positions which are traditionally male
-dominated (namely, 
construction and low
-skilled physical work).
17 The recent moder
ation in this rate of 
decline over the course of the recovery reflects the improving labour market situation 
in these male
-dominated sectors. At the same time, the female participation rate may 
have been impacted 
over the business cycle 
by the ﬁadded worke
r effectﬂ 
Œ the 
tendency for women to enter the labour market when their male partner loses his job 
or withdraws from participation. The added worker effect 
may have become 
particularly relevant 
given 
the 
strong impact of the crisis on
 income (and wealth)
, and thus it is likely to have played a role in the increasing female participation during the 
crisis in several euro area countries.
18 More recently the 
participation rate of prime
-age women 
has been increasing at a slower rate during 
the recovery 
than bef
ore, 
which again may reflect the fact that, with an increase in male employment, there is 
now a reduced need for women to enter the labour market solely to maintain family 
income.
                                                                     17  See Black, S.,

in Italy, but some moderation has also been seen in Germany and France (in the latter, even before the

 Recent developments in euro
 area labour supply
 48 The composition of the labour force by skill is also changing, which is 
expl
ained by structural forces
. Over the course of the recovery, the increase in 
labour supply has been dominated by the highly skilled. There is a clear longer
-term 
shift towards a growing number of the highly skilled in the labour supply, while the 
numbers o
f those who have only primary education or less have been declining 
since the second quarter of 2013. The number of those with medium
-level skills has 
been increasing only moderately, as a result of increasing labour supply of the 
medium
-level skilled in t
he older age categories and declines in the prime
-age segment (see Chart D). All these changes are driven primarily by developments in 
the composition of the population by educational level.

 Overall, while the pace of growth has moderated, the labour supply has 
continued to increase over the course of the recovery
, largely driven by 
ongoing structural factors
. The increase in the participation rates of the older 
generations is the single most important explanatory factor behind the recent 
increases, but the growing participation of women has also contributed positi
vely. By 
contrast, the changing age composition of the labour force and the declining 
participation of prime
-age males and the young have both made a negative 
contribution to the labour supply. Finally, the increase in the labour force has been 
driven by t
he highly skilled, while the supply of low
-skilled labour has decreased. 
These developments follow longer
-term trends, while the business cycle has had a 
smaller impact on labour supply. The increasing contribution of older age groups, 
women and the highly
 skilled to the labour supply are also reflected in the changing 
composition of employment. 
At the same time
, there is potential for policies to 
enhance labour supply, 
which is 
also 
indicated 
by the heterogeneity in participation 
rates across the euro area
. 
Such 
policies
 could include
, among others, increased 
flexibility in working time arrangements, tax systems that incentivise 
the 
participation

 Reducing unemployment from a historical perspective
 50 4 Reducing unemployment from a historical perspective
 This box reviews the macroeconomic and structural conditions that have led 
to large reductions in unemployment from a historical perspective.
 The sample 
under inv
estigation covers all OECD countries over the past 35 years. By comparing 
the features of the historical experiences with those of the current job
-rich recovery 
in the euro area it is possible to draw lessons that may be useful in analysing future 
unemploy
ment developments.
 In line with the existing literature, this box defines 
an episode 
of large 
unemployment
 reduction as one which
 fulfil
s three conditions
: 1) the 
unemployment rate declines by at least 3
 percentage points
 in a three
-year period 
after the p
eak 
in the unemployment rate;
 2) the decline in the unemployment rate 
over a three
-year period is at least 25% of the initial unemployment rate;
 3) after five 
years the unemployment rate remains below that 
at the beginning of the episode.
19 When applying 
these three conditions
 to the European Union (EU) and other 
OECD countries 
over the period 1980
-2015, 25 
episodes in which there were 
large 
unemployment reduction
s can be identified.
 On average, for these 25 
episodes, the initial level of unemployment was 
13.4%; after three years it declined 
by 4.5
 percentage points, representing 35% of the initial unemployment rate; and 
after five years the unemployment rate was almost halved (see the table). Across the 
euro area countries, the majority of these episodes s
tarted in the mid
-1990s.
20 In the 
first half of the 1990s the unemployment rate reached historical
ly high levels and 
Europe 
experienced
 jobless growth. The period 
from
 the second half of the 1990s 
to
 the early 2000s coincided with the highest 
intensity of 
reform
s in labour and product 
markets.
 This
 increase in 
the
 momentum 
of reform was induced 
not only
 by the high 
unemployment rate
, but also
 in all likelihood
 by the introduction of the euro and the 
process of EU integration
.21 Currently, 
five
 euro area count
ries seem to fulfil the above
-mentioned
 criteria 
(see the t
able).
22 These countries are Ireland, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovakia. 
Other countries
 with high unemployment, and
 which are 
currently 
observing a 
reduction
 in unemployment,
 are Greece, Italy and Slovenia. However, they
 do not yet 
fulfil the three criteria
. 
Italy and Slovenia do not fulfil any of the three criteria
, while 
Greece can be considered a borderline case, as only 
the second 
criteri
on, 
i.e.
 a decline that is 
at least
 25% of the initial unemployment rate after 
three
 years, 
has not 
been met.
                                                                     19  Freund, C. and Rijkers,

 Notes
: * Data up to four years since the start of the unemployment 
reduction. The historical average refers to the simple average of the 
25 episodes identified across 41 EU and OECD countries between 1980 and 2010.
 The macroeconomic and structural conditions at the onset of episodes of 
large reductions in unemployment wer
e significantly different to those where 
such unemployment reduction did not occur.
 Chart A compares the 
macroeconomic and structural features of the 25 episodes of large reductions in 
unemployment with those of a group of countries that did not experience
 such an 
episode, notwithstanding the fact that in the latter group the unemployment rate was 
at least as high as the average unemployment rate of the former group at the onset 
of the episode. 
 Generally
, the o
nset of an episode
 of large unemployment reduc
tion occurs in 
the presence of a large degree of economic slack
. Chart
 A(a) shows that 
countries undergoing an episode of large unemployment reduction have a larger 
negative output gap than countries in which the unemployment rate remains high.
 Episodes 
of large 
reductions in 
unemployment 
occur
 in the presence of more 
efficient structures and institutions.
 When comparing the group
 in which there is 
a large reduction in unemployment with the group in which there is not,
 the latter is 
characterised by signifi
cantly weaker structures/economic institutions
, as measured 
by product market efficiency and overall efficiency of economic institutions (see 
Chart
 A(b) and (c))
. This seems to suggest that successful episodes 
of 
unemployment reduction 
come about
 when 
stru
ctural conditions
, including
 product 
and labour market
 regulations
 and the overall 
quality of institutions
, are
 more 
sound.

unemployment that saw a large reduction in unempl
oyment (A) with those of 
countries that did not see a large reduction in unemployment (B)
  Source:
 ECB staff calculations based on Eurostat data.
 Notes: A refers to observations with average unemployment rate above 13%, followed by a large reduction in 
unemployment.
 B refers to observations with average unemployment rate above 13%, not followed by a large reduction in unemployment.
 The 13% threshold relates to the average unemployment rate at the onset of episodes of large reductions in unemployment (see
 table).
 The evolution of key macroeconomic and structural variables around historical 
episodes of unemployment reduction can shed further light on patterns of 
unemployment reduction.
 Chart
 B shows 
developments in
 the unemployment rate, 
GDP growth, compens
ation per employee and the reform stance
23 in the countries 
that witnessed large reductions in unemployment compared with
 the sample 
average.
24 It shows that r
eal compensation per employee moderates substantially 
before an episode
 of large reduction in unemployment
 starts and sees 
hardly 
any 
growth until 
three 
year
s after the start of
 the episode. GDP growth falls substantially 
in the two years 
preceding
 the episode. Following the start of the episode
 of large 
reduction in unemploy
ment
, GDP grows significantly during the five
-year period.
 In 
addition to the role played by the economic cycle, the increase in reform 
efforts
 is associated with a subsequent reduction 
in the unemployment rate
. This can be seen 
in Chart
 B, as the number o
f reforms peaks before the episode of unemployment 
reduction starts.
                                                                     23  The reform stance is computed using the change in the OECD™s indicators of employment protection 
legislation (EPL) and of regulation in network industries, i.e. energy, transport and communications 
(ETCR), and a measure of the degree of centralisation of wage bargaining, as compiled by the Fraser 
Institute. The changes in these series are used as a proxy for labour and product market reforms, 
which are likely to have an impact on labour demand and suppl
y and thus on the unemployment rate. 
The focus is on relatively large reforms, which are defined as reforms that exceed two standard 
deviations of the change in the indicator over all observations in each serie
s. The reform stance 
indicator assumes a value
 of 0 if no large reforms are implemented, 1 if a large reform is implemented, 
2 if large reforms are implemented in two areas, and 3 if large reforms are implemented simultaneously 
across the three indicators.

 Structural reform needs in the euro area: insights from a survey of large companie
s 54 5 Structural reform
 need
s in the euro area: 
insights from 
a 
survey 
of large 
companies
 This box summarises the results of an ad hoc 
ECB 
survey of leading euro area 
businesses on structural reforms in the euro area.
25 The importance of structural 
reforms as a means of increasing the rate of potential growth and strengthening the 
resilience of the euro area economy has been repeatedly emphasised by 
policymakers over rec
ent years
.26 But, so far
, there have been few attempts to 
gauge the opinion of 
the business community
 on this subject
. The survey 
had three 
objectives
: (1)
 to gain information on the impact of recently implemented reforms in 
the euro area 
and see these 
from
 a business perspective; (2)
 to understand the 
major perceived obstacles to 
implementing 
reforms; and (3)
 to 
acquire 
insights into 
the 
reform priorities 
needed to further improve the euro area business environment 
and labour markets, as well as to complete
 the European Single Market.
 Responses were received from some 55 leading euro area 
enterprises
, 
non
-financial companies 
active across a wide range of sector
s. Respondents were 
typically among the leaders 
in their respective sectors. Together, the 55 
compa
nies
 account for approximately 
1% of total euro area employment. In terms of sectoral 
composition, some 30 respondents were principally active in the broader industrial 
sector (including construction), while 25 companies were service providers. Around 
two
-thirds of companies were primarily engaged in the provision of business
-to
-business products and services, while the remaining third were mainly business
-to
-consumer 
companies
. The
 majority of 
companies indicated that 
the recent structural reforms have 
had
 a positive impact on their business
 operations
. Positive assessments 
were 
mainly 
related to the 
effect
 of labour market reforms. Respondents noted, in 
particular, the impact of the 2012 reforms in Spain
27, which have improved labour 
market flexibility
. The
 pace of reform over the period 2013
-16 (
see Chart
 A) was characterised as 
ﬁslow and fragmentedﬂ
 by over 60% of respondents.
 Just over a quarter of 
respondents 
Œ from
 a wide range of sectors 
Œ perceived implementation to have 
been ﬁslow but comprehensiveﬂ.
 Notable exceptions were companies heavily active 
in Spain, which tended to 
be more positive on 
this front
. Overall, however,
 only a 
few
 companies 
(mainly operating 
in 
a services sector) 
considered 
reform implementation 
as ﬁfastﬂ
, while no respondent chara
cterised recent reforms as ﬁfast and 
comprehensiveﬂ.
                                                                     25  The survey was 
sent out
 in spring 2017.
 26  For example, see:

monetary policy and structural reforms
, remarks at 
the 
Observatory Group roundtable
, New York, 
18 
November 
2016.
 27  For 
Spain
, around a third of respondents assessed 
the 
reforms enacted since 2008 to have had a 
positive impact on in
vestment (particularly 
by
 increasing the share of total investment allocated to 
research and develo
pment
, and 
thereby enhancing support for innovation
). Meanwhile, more than 40% 
considered 
reforms supportive to productivity growth
, and nearly 40%
 felt that
 reforms had contribute
d to stronger employment growth
 by reducing the risks (and costs) of hiring and by helping to increase 
wage flexibility.

political constraints and opposition from vested interests.
 Few

participants 
saw reform efforts

because of 
a lack of clarity 
on reform needs. Instead, some 85% of

 suggested that reform

highly as obstacles to reform efforts (at least 40% of respondents cate

 Structural reform needs in the euro area: insights from a survey of large companies
 56 When a
sked about ongoing reform needs, 
businesses
 consistently highlighted
 labour market reforms as the most pressing area
 for further action, while 
further reforms 
aimed at
 product markets and the broader busi
ness 
environment were also seen as important.
 This finding reflects both 
the 
consistently higher rankings of labour market variables
, rated 
as ﬁimportantﬂ and 
ﬁvery importantﬂ 
under standardised 
questions on reform needs in three different 
areas 
(completio
n of the European Single Market
, 
country
-level business 
environments and labour markets
), as well as responses to a
 more 
open
 question 
requesting 
respondents to specify 
ﬁthe most pressingﬂ ref
orms from their point of 
view.
28 Concerning 
the 
labour market (
see Chart
 C), 
reforms
 aimed at further 
improving workforce ﬁflexibilityﬂ were deemed worthy of prioritisation, with 
efforts supporting more 
flexibl
e working time arrangements, eas
ier
 usage
 of 
temporary contracts and 
less stringent 
employment protection legis
lation
 being 
three of the top four priorities 
for 
at least 80% of 
companies
. Moreover, 
around 50% of respondents suggested that reforms aimed at enhancing workforce 
flexibility were likely to have the single greatest impact on business outcomes 
Œ given the
ir importance for regaining competitiveness and also because they would 
allow companies to better respond to growing volatility in demand and changing 
demand patterns.

-intensive skill
 sets, digitalisation and 
long

move
 taxes 
and social charges away from labour were also widely reported as important areas 
for additional reform
s, while furthe
r reforms to wage bargaining systems and wage 
setting frameworks (including minimum wages) were 
underlin
ed less often.
 As regards 
potential reform priorities 
for enhancing 
the wider business 
environment (
see Chart

ns were 
also 
emphasised 
by more than 90% of 
companies
. Indeed, almost 60% 
indicated that 
further work in this area 
was ﬁvery importantﬂ
29. 
Survey participants
 suggested that 
such reforms would be likely to help reduce 
the 
administrative costs of suppliers, 
refocus resources away from compliance procedures and speed up the opening of 
new stores.
30 Network constraints were also deemed important
, 
with around 80% of 
companies
 highlighting 
the necessity of 
further improvements 
to the

euro area countries and 75% 
indicated that more reforms were still needed to 
reduce 
the

 The role of base effects in the projected path of HICP inflation
 59 6 The role of base effects in the p
rojected path of HICP 
inflation
 Base effects will exert a s
trong impact on the projected path for headline HICP 
inflation
 in the coming quarters
. The September 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections for the euro area foresee a V
-shaped path for headline inflation 
developments in the coming quarters, with a troug
h of 0.9% in the first quarter of 
2018.32 This profile essentially reflects the impact of base effects on the annual rates 
of change in energy and unprocessed food prices, which are the most volatile 
components of HICP inflation.
 The pronounced swing in the
 annual rate of change in oil prices will be 
mirrored in energy inflation one year ahead assuming the current path of 
futures oil prices.
 Oil prices increased from early 2016 to February 2017 but then 
declined up to June 2017. These developments implied la
rge increases in the annual 
rate of change
 of oil prices, followed by large declines, with both movements also 
reflected in HICP energy inflation developments (see Chart A). Looking ahead and 
assuming that oil prices follow the smooth and moderately upward
-sloped path 
suggested by oil futures prices, this implies that annual rates of change in oil prices 
and energy inflation will mainly mirror the past swing in oil prices. The pattern of the 
annual growth rate of oil (and thereby energy) prices will thus be
 driven by base 
effects, i.e. ﬁatypicalﬂ month
-on-month changes in the index 12 months earlier.

change of oil prices calculated on spot prices from those calculated on futures prices 
of 14 August 2017, the cut
-off date for the assumptions of the ﬁSeptember 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro 
areaﬂ.
 Unprocessed food inflation also re
corded a strong
 temporary
 increase in the 
first few months of 2017
. This increase reflected a weather
-related upward impact 
                                                                    32  See the article entitled ﬁSeptember

40% of the unprocessed food component (see Char
t B). As a consequence of the 
strong changes in these prices, the profile of unprocessed food inflation will also be 
affected by negative base effects, in particular in February 2018.

. The combined impact of base effects from the energy and unprocessed food 
HICP components will lower headline inflation in the first quarter of 2018 but 
raise it in the following quarter.
 The quantification 
of base effects 
is subject to a 
degree of 
uncertainty, as there is no single way to compute the impact of an atypical 
month
-on-month change. In past analyses reported in the ECB™s Bulletin, this impact 
has been computed by subtracting the actual month
-on-month change from the 
typical movement (i.e. an estimated seasonal effect and a ﬁtrendﬂ, quantified as the 
average month
-on-month change since the mid
-1990s).
33 Chart 
C shows the 
estimated contribution
 of base effects from the energy
 and unprocessed food 
com
ponents to the change in the annual HICP inflation rate from one month to the 
next, which will occur over the rest of 2017 and in the first half of 2018. It is 
estimated that 
base effects 
in the energy component will be mostly negative up to 
January 2018 a
nd positive thereafter, while for the unprocessed food component 
they will 
be negative 
from December 2017 to February 2018 and positive from March 
2018. The cumulative impact of such base effects
 on overall HICP 
inflation is always 
shown relative to a spec
ific 
reference 
month. For example, relative to the annual 
headline inflation rate in July 2017, the cumulative negative impact of these base 
effects 
on headline HICP 
inflation in February 2018 will amount to half a percentage 
point. However, as base effect
s will be positive in the following months, the 
cumulative impact on headline HICP inflation will change sign and amount to about 
plus 0.2 percentage points by July 2018 (see Chart C).
                                                                     33  See, for instance, the box entitled

 When assessing the impact of base effects on likely outcomes of

also be borne in mind that future annual rates of inflation will, of course, also depend 
on actual month
-on-month changes in energy and unprocessed food prices in the 
intervening period.

 Base money, broad money and the APP
 62 7 Base money, broad money and the APP
 The 
significant expansion
 in base money induced by the 
asset 
purc
hase 
programme (APP) has
 attracted growing
 public attention.
 This box provi
des an 
overview of recent developments in base money
34 and discusses to what extent
 the
y have
 had implications for broad money
35. In 
the pre
-crisis period
, base money developments 
largely reflected
 changes in 
currency in circulation and required central bank
 reserves
 (see Chart 
A). In 
periods when 
interbank markets
 are functioning normally
, the Eurosystem 
provides
 the central bank reser
ves in euro needed by the banking system on aggregate, 
which a
re then
 traded among banks and 
thereby
 redistributed within the banking 
system as necessary. 
The aggregate demand for central bank reserves 
is thus 
effectively accommodated by t
he Eurosystem 
with very limited levels of excess 
reserves. In the pre
-crisis period, base money developments in the e
uro area were 
therefore largely a reflection of changes in currency in circulation and 
required
 central bank reserves.

 Note: The latest observation is for August 2017.
 Prior to the financial crisi

developments 
were 
unfolding along 
similar
 trends (see Chart B)
. The growth i

                                                                    34  Base money consists of 
banknotes
 in circulation, the deposits that credit inst
itutions are required to 
hold in 
their current accounts 
with
 the Eurosystem in order to cover the minimum reserve requirement 
(required central bank reserves) and credit institutions™ holdings of highly liquid deposits with the 
Eurosystem over and beyond t
he level of required central bank reserves (excess central bank reserves 
and recourse to the deposit facility).
 35  Broad money, or M3, consists of very liquid liabilities of domestic MFIs held by the money
-holding 
sector (i.e. 
non
-MFIs resident
 in the euro
 area, 
except central
 government
): currency in circulation, 
overnight deposits, 
deposits with
 maturities of up to two years, 
deposits
 redeemable 
at notice of up to 
three months, repurchase agreements, money market fund shares/units and MFI debt securities 
of up 
to two years. From a monetary analysis perspective, broad money is relevant because it is associated 
with the total resources available in the economy for the purchase of goods, services and non
-monetary assets as well as for investment expenditures.

the 
evolution of 
banks
™ reserve requirements
, which in turn depended on the evolution of 
banks™ short
-term liabilities (deposits and debt securities with a residual maturity of 
up to two years)
. 
As a result, the money 
multiplier (the ratio of broad money to base 
money) was rather stable.
 Chart 
B Base money and the money multiplier
 (left
-hand side: index: 1999=100; right
-hand side: money multiplier
)  Source: ECB. 
 Notes: The money multiplier is the ratio of broad money 
to base money. The latest observation is for July 2017.
 Since the financial crisis, base money has been increasingly driven by 
Eurosystem 
monetary policy 
operations
. In line with t
he responses of all major 
central banks to the
 financial crisis,
 the volume
 of monetary policy operations 
undertaken
 by the Eurosystem 
increased
 substantially from 2007 onwards and in 
particular after September 2008. 
In 
a situation of malfunctioning
 money markets
 and liquidity stress 
on banks™ balance sheets
, the Eurosystem suppl
ied central bank 
reserves to each counterparty
 elastically
 at a level
 well 
above the banking system 
aggregate demand, through fi
xed rate tenders with full
 allotment. Moreover, in 2009 
the first programme of outright purchases of covered bonds (CBPP1) was la
unched. 
The 
resulting 
increase in 
excess central bank liquidity 
was mirrored by a
 signifi
cant 
expansion of
 base money
 (see Chart A). T
he volume of monetary policy operations 
increased 
again 
sharply in the second half of 2011, mainly as a consequence of the
 two longer
-term refinancing operations (
VLTROs) with
 a three
-year maturity 
conducted in December 2011
 and February 2012
, and, to a lesser extent, outright 
purchases of securities under the CBPP2
. As a result of these operations,
 excess 
reserves and, there
fore, 
base money
 displayed a further sizeable increase.
 Since the introduction of 
non
-standard measures
, broad money has stopped 
closely mirroring developments in base money.
 Since 2008, the trends in base 
money and broad money have decoupled, as the expansion in base money due to 
non-standard measures has not supported a similar uptrend in monetary holdings 
outside the banking sector. In the context of considerable financial fr
agmentation, 
economic uncertainty and weak credit demand, it was not surprising that the

 Base money, broad money and the APP
 64 increase in banks™ holdings of central bank reserves, often as liquidity insurance, did 
not result mechanically in an increase in the supply of credit to the non
-finan
cial 
private sector, and hence in broad money, the levels of which remained subdued.
36 At the same time, the expansion in base money was instrumental in avoiding fire
 sales and a curtailment of credit with potentially severe consequences for the real 
econom
y. 
Given this weak link between base money and broad money,
 the money 
multiplier was on a declining path from the onset of the financial crisis until the end of 
2012. In 201
3 banks™ preference f
or central bank liquidity waned and 
base money 
returned 
to the
 levels implied by the pre
-crisis trend.
 Receding financial 
fragmentation and improved funding conditions in euro area financial markets from 
mid
-2012 reduced the incentive for banks to keep high levels of liquidity. Thus, banks 
in 2013 used the option off
ered by the ECB of a voluntary early repayment of the 
VLTROs, leading to a return of base money closer to the levels implied by the 
extrapolation of the pre
-crisis trend. The decline in base money combined with non
-decreasing broad money, which was support
ed by some recovery in monetary 
assets, implied an increase in the money multiplier.
 The 
expanded 
APP mark
ed the 
start
 of a new phase of 
supply
-side
-induced 
increases in the volume of base money.
 The announcement of the APP 
repres
ented a change in regime
 that was in clear contrast to the previous practice 
consisting of banks expressing their demand for central bank liquidity, which was 
accommodated in an elastic way. Under the APP, t
he Eurosystem 
supplies central 
bank 
reserves 
when
 purchasing 
assets. Sinc
e banks
 are 
typically 
the 
only 
entities
, apart from central government, 
that hold deposit accounts with the central bank, 
purchases are always settled through them, regardless
 of who the ultimate seller is. 
Therefore, p
urchases conducted under the APP resu
lted in a mechanic, direct 
increase in
 base money
. The APP has been an important driving force behind the robust developments 
in broad money recorded since 2015, with indirect effects playing a major 
role.
37 Non
-residents and banks have so far been the main
 sellers of government 
bonds under the p
ublic 
sector 
purchase 
programme
 (the largest purchase 
programme under the APP), while sales by the domestic money
-holding sector have 
                                                                    36  Ultimately, 
overall broad money balances in the economy are determined by many other factors, 
including economic activity and bank lending, banks™ preference to fund themselves via retail deposits 
or via debt securities issuance, and the percentage of 
securities actually sold by resident banks or the 
non
-resident sector. In addition, 
the growth of bank credit depends on a set of factors that determine 
credit demand and on other factors linked to the supply of credit. The demand factors include 
accumulated debt, 
borrowing costs and income prospects. Factors relating to the credit supply are the 
risk
-adjusted return on lending, the bank™s capital position, its attitude towards risk, the cost of funding 
and the liquidity risk.
 37  The recent expansi
on of broad money has also benefited from the ECB™s other non
-standard monetary 
policy measures, such as 
negative interest rate
s, which contributed to reducing the 
opportunity costs of 
holding monetary instruments 
to historically low levels
, and the target
ed 
longer
-term refinancing 
operations 
(TLTROs), which represented a valid alternative to long
-term market
-based funding. The 
TLTROs have also contributed to the recent developments in broad money by 
provid
ing
 an incentive
 for 
expanding
 lending to firms and
 households

 65 been moderate, implying a contained direct impact of the APP on broad money.
38 A large part of the effects of the APP on broad money have materialised via indirect 
effects. First, 
indirect effect
s arise 
from the portfolio rebalancing
 that the programme 
is intended to bring about.
 Moreover, banks have expanded loans to domestic firms 
and households, implying an increase in the deposits held by the euro area money
-holding sector. Some b
anks 
have
 also 
use
d the increased liquidity at their disposal to 
pay down their more costly liabilities.
 Further indirect effects of the APP on broad 
money h
ave materialised via a wide set of channels through which the APP has 
influenced financial markets and economic activity. The APP has
 indeed 
resulted in a
 broad
 easing of financing conditions
 and favourable wealth effects, crucially 
supporting the recovery in lending and economic growth.
 The money multiplier has 
been declining since the start of the APP, mechanically reflecting the proportionately 
larger 
positive 
impact
 of the programme on bas
e money than on broad money. 
While 
the former displays a 
direct
 relationship with the purchases,
 the latter is mainly 
affected via complex indirect effects, as discussed above.

 1 Modelling euro banknote quality
 Central banks are the guardians of bank
note quality. In 2016 euro area national 
central banks (NCBs) checked 32.3 billion euro banknotes on their high
-speed 
machines 
for
 quality and authenticity. Commercial cash
 handlers (CHs)
39 processed 
a similar number. CHs disburse banknotes of good quality 
to their customers 
and return poor
-quality 
ones 
(unfit banknotes) and surplus stocks to the NCBs. Th
ese 
destroy all unfit banknotes after a final authenticity check. In 2016 NCBs replaced 
5.4 billion unfit banknotes (around 27% of the banknotes in circulat
ion) with new 
ones. 
Note
 consumption and 
the 
quality
 of notes
 in circulation
 differ by country
. The 
ECB
 has 
therefore 
developed a computer
-based model to better understand the 
differences in euro area cash cycles. The model simulates a cash cycle using a 
theoretical approach based on key
 figures. 
The simulations identify 
the 
resistance of 
banknote
s to soil and defects, the frequency with which banknotes are returned to 
the NCB and 
the NCB sensor threshold as
 the
 three 
main drivers 
of banknote quality 
and ca
sh cycle costs.
 1 Introduction
 At the end of December 2016 20.2 billion euro banknotes with a nominal value 
of •1.12
 trillion were in circulation.
 Compared 
with
 end-2015, 
this marked an
 increase
 of 7.0% in volume and 3.9% in value. These figures are in lin
e with the 
average annual increase over the last 
five
 years
, which was
 7.8% in volume and 
6.1% in value (
see
 Chart 1
). 
Euro banknote circulation increases if NCBs issue 
banknotes; it decreases if NCBs receive 
banknotes
, usually 
of

. Note: The volumes for the •5 to •50 notes are the sum of first series and Europa
 series notes
. The Eurosystem has a duty to ensure public confidence in euro banknotes by 
maintaining their quality in circulation.
 Poor
-quality banknotes are likely to be 
rejected by vending machines, and 
also 
make it 
less easy
 for 
the public and retailer
s to spot counterfeits. 
Two factors are mainly responsible for maintaining
 quality
. The 
first is 
providing durable banknotes: the 
lifespan
 of the Europa series •5 and •10 
banknotes has been enhanced by applying an additional protective varnish layer
. 
The s
econd is 
the 
involvement of 
NCBs
 in the cash cycle
, replacing soiled and 
defective notes detected during machine
 processing. However, 
banknote quality in 
circulation 
also 
depends on various 
other 
factors
. For example, if few ATMs dispense 
•5 banknotes, 
the
se will stay longer in active circulation 
to make up
 for the
ir limited 
availability as change. Retailers will 
retain them for use rather than return
 them
 to the 
NCB, which is therefore unable to remove any
 soiled notes
 from circulation
. Since
 2011 
CHs have
 been able to
 disburse 
(recirculate) 
used banknotes
, provided
 they observe 
the 
rules set 
out 
in ECB Decision ECB/2010/14 on the 
authenticity and fitness checking and recirculation of euro banknotes (the 
ﬁRecirculation Framework
ﬂ)40. More specifically, any r
ecirculated euro banknotes 
must have been processed on banknote sorting machines which have been tested 
by the Eurosystem and are listed on the ECB
™s website. In addition, 
CHs
 are obliged 
to report 
every six months on
 the number and type of machines in use
, as well as on
 the volume of notes processed, recirculated and sorted 
out as
 unfit. The 
Recirculation Framework has been adopted swiftly by CHs. Since the initial reporting 
of machines used in accordance with the Recirculation Framework the number of 
comp
liant banknote handling machines in operation has almost doubled (from 
                                                                    40  In some euro area 
countries the recirculation of banknotes was not allowed before that time
, in others, 
recirculation was carried out under bilateral agreements between CHs and the NCB

. As for
 the quality of euro banknotes in circulation in different euro area 
countries, the intuitive assumption is that a higher 
level of 
destruction of poor 
quality banknotes 
Œ and replacement with new notes 
Œ should 
result 
in 
improved quality.
 When 
countries™
 quality in circulation 
is compared 
with the per 
capita 
rate of 
note destruction, 
however, this is not apparent 
(see 
Chart 3
). The chart
 shows a 
mixed
 picture
, with most countries having a low destruction 
rate 
of about 
one note per person 
per year, but 
with
 significant outliers. Some countries have a 
lower quality in circulation despite a high destruction
 rate
; other
s have a very high 
quality in circulation 
even 
though they destroy less than half as many notes as the 
euro
 area average. 
This indicates
 that differences in national cash cycles play a 
significant role. These specific national influences are not yet sufficiently understood.

 Overview of stakeholders
 The cash cycle involves several interacting processes and stakeholders.
 An 
overview of a typical euro area cash cycle is 
shown in 
Figure 1
. NCBs issue euro 
banknotes (printed by 
multiple 
accredited printing works)
. From here
 they are picked 
up by CHs, usually 
using
 cash
-in-transit companies (CITs)
, which
 deliver them to 
commercial banks
 or retailers
, or directly to ATMs. The public receive ban
knotes 
primarily 
from
 ATMs or as change from retailers
, and to a lesser extent over the 
counter at banks. Retailers™ excess banknotes are deposited at a bank branch or 
                                                                    42  The model 
will be
 available 
for download on the ECB™s website

 70 picked up by CITs. They are then either returned to the NCB for quality and 
authenticity
 checks or recirculated by a CH. Depending on the denomination of the 
note 
and the country, a note 
may be
 processed and returned to the cash cycle 
multiple times before becoming unfit and sorted out for destruction.
 Figure 1
 The banknote 
lifecycle
   Euro 
banknotes are 
also
 exported to and imported from countries outside the 
euro area by
 both
 specialised CHs (
e.g. 
banknote wholesale banks supplying 
bureaux de change)
 and 
the public, for touris
m or commercial purposes.
 Cumulat
ive
 net exports to non
-euro area
 countries 
in the form of
 bulk shipments of 
euro banknotes by banknote wholesale banks by
 the
 end of 2016 amounted to 
•172.8
 billion. As there are also large unregistered flows, other sources
43 estimate 
that more than 30% of euro banknotes 
issued in Germany
 by value circulate outside 
the euro area. 
Estimat
es of
 a denominational breakdown 
are not yet available
. These
 in
flows
 and outflows from
/to
 outside the euro area, 
or 
between the 
different countries 
within it
, 
have a 
substantial 
impact on
 national cash cycles.
 Some euro area countries experience negative net
 issuance of certain 
denominations
, i.e. 
an NCB receives
 more banknotes 
from CHs 
than it issues. 
This 
occurs when
 notes
 migrate
 into the country from abroad, either from another euro 
area country or from regions outside
 the euro area
. 
Banknote migration is caused 
primarily by tourism and cross
-border commuting.

ﬂ flows,

 While the general cash cycle holds true for all NCBs, the share
 processed by
 NCBs and CHs 
and their respective roles 
vary 
considerab
ly from country to 
cou
ntry.
 This is due to national specificities. 
In 2016 the aggregate ratio of
 processing by
 CHs to
 processing by
 NCBs was close to 1.1 (
see 
Chart 2
), 
but 
national
 figures range from 0 (i.e. no recirculation

 at all) to CHs processing 
more than five tim
es the NCB note volume.
 2.2
 Banknote fitness 
as judged by
 humans and machines
 Over
 their life banknotes deteriorate and their quality, i.e. fitness
, decreases. 
The fitness of a banknote is defined by its soil level and whether it carries any 
defects.
 Recent research 
into
 the ageing of banknote
s has
 identified soiling as 
one of the
 main reason
s circulating note
s become unfit. Soil consists primarily of human 
sebum (a waxy substance produced by skin glands) transferred onto note
s by 
handling, 
and dirt p
articles
.44 The second unfit category comprises defects such as 
stains, graffiti markings, tape, dog
-ears and tears. While soiling is typically a gradual 
process, a banknote usually becomes defective at a 
particular
 moment in time (e.g. 
when it is torn or s
tained).
 The difficulty for all automated fitness measurements is to ensure that the 
machine judgement correlates well with the human perception of the condition 
of a banknote.
 Fitness is usually 
measured
 by sorting machines that process up to 
33 banknotes
 per second, capture an image of 
a banknote, apply different algorithms 
to the image and finally decide whether
 or not
 it is fit for circulation. However, 
the 
fitness
 assessment 
by sorting machine 
can be influenced by different factors.
 The most prominent 
are: (1)
 imperfections in the note transport and camera system
; (2)
 dust from the processed banknotes (such as residues of paper fibres or ink) affecting 
the image quality
; (3)
 the gloss o
n new banknotes
, which has been shown to 
significantly 
affect
 soil
ing assessment
; (4)
 potential production variations, d
espite 
strict quality control
s, resulting in slight differences in new batches
 of notes
. To ensure NCBs
 apply standards that match human perception, the ECB has 
created a standardised batch 
or ﬁ
test
 deck
ﬂ of euro notes from circulation for 
evaluatin
g sorting machines.
 The test
 deck contains banknotes of all fitness 
levels. 
On the basis of
 a visual assessment by Eurosystem experts (i.e. human 
perception), a 
ﬁtrue
ﬂ fitness value has been allocated to each banknote in the test
 deck. Naturally, 
no judgement 
by an
 automated fitness sensor will exactly match th
e fitness value derived 
from
 human expert judgement, 
so 
there will be 
some 
cases of 
misclassification. Either f
it banknotes are incorrectly prematurely destroyed (false
 unfit notes) or unfit banknotes are judged fit and reissued (false
 fit notes). 
Eurosystem research has confirmed
, by applying the test
 deck, that different high
-                                                                    44  See

 to 
the

.46 2.3
 Eurosystem standards for measuring banknote fitness
 The Eurosystem 
has 
defined minimum thresholds at which an NCB 
must
 classify a banknote as unfit for circulation (
the ﬁ
Eurosystem threshold
47ﬂ). These thresholds include limits for soiling 
and all
 defect categories. All NCBs 
must
 adhere to these minimum requirements
, and only a small percentage of the notes 
they reissue 
are allowed to not fulfil these criteria. This tolerance margin 
(8% of 
notes reissued
) takes into account the uncertainties of machine note classification. 
NCB
s can apply a stricter sorting policy to counteract low quality of banknotes in the 
national cash c
ycle.
 The minimum fitness standards for CHs (
ﬁCH threshold
ﬂ) are defined 
in
 the 
Recirculation Framework and are lower than those for NCBs.
 This to ensure 
that
, even including the measuring tolerances,
 the banknotes reissued by an NCB 
are fit for the CHs an
d can be recirculated a number of times 
before 
reaching the 
end of their life.
 2.4
 How the Eurosystem
 measures quality in circulation
 Every year t
he Eurosystem collects a representative sample of 
the 
ﬁtransactional
ﬂ denominations (•5 
Œ •100) and determines the 
percentage
 of 
unfit banknotes in this sample according to the Eurosystem threshold.
 Samples 
taken from
 circulation 
in each euro area country are processed on the high
-speed sorting machines of two NCBs and the 
average 
percentage
 of unfit notes
 in 
each sample
, 
whether
 due to soil or 
to 
defects, is 
calculat
ed. The results of this 
annual quality survey 
among other things help the 
NCB
s decide whether banknote 
quality
 in circulation is adequate
 and if necessary 
adjus
t 
their
 sorting policy.
  The Eurosystem also carries out a survey of public perceptions of note quality 
(every two years) and an online poll
48 (since 201
2), 
both of which 
correlate well 
with the quality survey
. Both polls focus on the quality of the •5 and 
•50 note
s. 
The •5 note usually has a lower quality because it remains in circulation
 as change
, 
returning to
 NCBs less often
. Taking the
 euro area average, 
the 
quality 
of the •5 
note 
is considered good
, with 7
5% of participants ranking quality as acceptabl
e or higher
 (see Chart 4)
. For the •50 
note 
almost all respondents (99%) consider the note to be 
of at least acceptable quality. 
Comparing the national results of the quality survey 
                                                                    45  Alternative methods 
have also shown that the accuracy of a sensor is dependent on the 
denomination 
and is not consistent along a normalised fitness range.

 The life
span
 of a banknote
 All euro banknotes within a 
single 
denomination have the same 
substrate and 
print specifications; however, the life of a note from first issuance to 
destruction at an NCB depend
s on 
both 
its physical durability 
and
 national 
cash cycle characteristics.
 How banknotes are used by the public (e.g. whether 
they
 are stored
 in wallets or in trouser
 pockets) 
and even
 environmental factors such 
as humidity play a 
significant
 role 
in the time it takes for a note to become unfit. The 
frequency 
with which
 notes
 are returned
 to either CHs or NCBs then has an impact 
on how soon 
the
 unfit 
ones
 can be removed from circulation.
 The life
span
 of a banknote is commonly defined as the total number of notes 
in circulation divided by the notes destroyed per year.
 However, this approach 
does not take into account banknotes that 
are
 not actual
ly circulat
ing at all
 because 
they are 
being 
used as a store of value, 
have been 
lost
, or have migrated out of 
the
 national cash cycle or even 
out of 
the euro area
 entirely.
49 More accurately, the life of 
a banknote 
can
 be stated as:
 
[
]=
 
 
 


 
 
 
 However, 
the
 data
 available
 does not allow the active circulation for each 
country and denomination
 to be determined accurately
. The Eurosystem 
therefore 
has to rely on estimates which take into account national data on NCB and 
CH processing 
and NCB destruction volumes. 
Known banknote flows due to 
commuting, tourism or CH shipments are 
also 
included in these estimates. 
 3 The model 
Œ definitions 
and methodology
 The 
ECB™s 
model simulat
es a cash cycle.
 The most important results 
generated 
are
 the NCB shred rate, the quality in circulation (
the percentage of
 unfit 
banknotes 
in circulation)
, the replacement cost 
and the actual 
bank
note life in circula
tion. The 
model starts with a population of banknotes 
which can be defined by the operator. 
After the model is started, the population 
evolve
s over a number of iterations until a 
steady
 state is reached. Each iteration in the model simulates the sorting an
d ageing 
within the cash cycle over
 one week. 
Steady
 state
 in the cycle is reached
 at the
 equilibrium where the sorting activities of CHs and the NCB counteract the ageing of 
notes in circulation due to soiling and defects, 
increases or decreases in 
circul
ation 
volume and in
flows
 and outflows
.50 The cash cycle as implemented in the model is 
shown in 
Figure 2

 The note circulation model
   The model
 defines
 bank
note fitness 
on a scale of
 1 to 100
, with the 
Eurosystem
 threshold set 
at 50. A fitness level of 1 
is the cleanest new note
, and 100 
is
 any note which is more than twice as soiled as the threshold.
 Defects are binary and 
assigned
 a fitness level of 100, which ensures that they are 
consistently sorted 
out as
 unf
it by CHs and NCBs
.51 Any population of banknotes in 
the model 
has a fitness profile, which 
shows
 the frequency of 
fitness
 levels 
within it
. The model 
starts with a
 note population which represents the banknotes in active 
circulation. 
In every iteration the
 following steps are carried out:
 1. Part of the note population is 
sorted into fit and unfit notes
 by CHs.
 2. A further 
portion
 of the
 notes is then sorted by the NCB. The
se notes 
are
 a mix 
of notes from circulation, the 
notes found by 
CHs to be 
unfit and 
notes
 found by 
CHs to be 
fit 
but 
sent back to the NCB as surplus. The banknotes processed by 
the NCB are sorted into fit and unfit, with all unfit banknotes being removed 
from circulation.
                                                                     51  This is the predominant case in reality, as camera systems usually have no problem detecting defects 
such as dog

,52 equivalent
 to the number of notes sorted 
out as
 unfit by 
the NCB plus an additional correction for general circulation growth or decrease 
and compens
ation for any inflows and outflows.
 4. All notes in circulation (
i.e.
 notes not processed in the cycle, notes sorted 
as fit 
by CHs and the NCB
 and any new notes
) are aged. Ageing entails applying 
algorithms t
o simulate 
how banknotes gradually
 become 
soil
ed and suffer 
defects.
 5. Lastly, the fitness profile of the population at the end of the cycle is compared 
with
 what it was
 at the beginning. If the two are 
suffici
ently 
similar, steady state 
has been reached and the final results are displayed. Otherwise steps 1
-5 are 
repeated
 as long as necessary
. The ageing of a banknote is simulated in two steps, 
representing 
soiling and 
defects.
 The average soiling per cycle is determined by the 
ﬁtheoretical note life
ﬂ and applied to each note via a definable distribution function
.53 The theoretical note 
life is the time it takes for a new banknote to become unfit, i.e. to go from fitness 
level 1 
to 50. It is an input parameter 
for
 the model and dependent on banknote 
durability but also on environmental factors, such as how intensively banknotes are 
used by the publ
ic in the simulated cash cycle.
 In the next step, defects are simulated by 
the
 likel
ihood (expressed as 
a percentage 
per year) 
of each banknote
 suffer
ing
 a defect (i.e. being moved
 instantly
 from its 
current fitness level to 100). The defect likelihood is applied to the banknote 
distribution according to a selectable profile in relation t
o the notes
™ fitness level
s. 
With
 this approach
, it can be modelled
, for example,
 that banknotes with a higher soil 
value have a higher likelihood of becoming defective
.54 The 
NCB and CH 
sorting step
s are
 both 
simulated by applying a model sensor 
with inacc
uracies following a Gaussian distribution
55 to the fitness profile of 
incoming notes.
 The inaccuracy of the model sensor is 
expressed as standard 
deviation
 (SD) in relation to the fitness scale. 
Chart 6
 shows how a fitness sensor, 
operating at a threshold o
f a fitness level of 
45 and having an inaccuracy 
modelled 
by an SD of
 5 fitness levels
, separat
es a typical note circulation profile (with 20% 
unfit notes) into fit and unfit notes. In the example, sensor inaccuracies
 mean that
 a small number of the notes 
sorted 
as fit are more soiled than the Eurosystem 
threshold (false
 fit 0.4%
56), but also 
that 
a substantial number of notes sorted 
as unfit 
are well below the Eurosystem threshold (false
 unfit 9%).
                                                                     52  The model allow
s any 
fitness 
profile for 
new banknotes to be specified
. Typically
, a Gaussi
an 
distribution reflecting 
some
 production variations is used.
 53  A Poisson distribution is used as a standard, with other distribution functions also supported.
 54  Studies 
have shown that 
the closest correlation to real
-life quality data can be achieved 
by applying
, in each
 cycle
, a defect probability which increas
es linearly
 with the fitness level.
 55  The Gaussian behaviour was identified during earlier large
-scale studies on sorting machines.
 56  False fit and false unfit figures are the share of total s

 Banknote Circulation Model
. Notes: The spike at 
the 100 
fitness level denotes defective and very unfit notes
. Modelled banknote 
inflows can have any fitness profile.
 The fitness profile of 
outflows is assumed to be the same as 
that
 of the current note circulation in the cash 
cycle. Both 
inflows
 and outflows are modelled to be neutral to the circulation volume. 
For outflows this is 
achieved by replacing the missing notes in each model cycle with 
additional new notes issued by the NCB. For inflows the 
volume of new notes added 
by the NCB as a
 replacement in each cycle is reduced accordingly.
 Total cash cycle costs are modelled as the 
sum of NCB sorting costs 
and
 the 
note replacement costs.
 Model inputs for the two cost components are the NCB
™s sorting costs (per 1,000 notes sorted)
57 and the issuance costs for new notes
.58 As 
shown in
 Figure 2
 the 
new 
notes which have to be 
issued are eq
uivalent to 
unfit 
notes destroyed by the NCB, outflows and any circulation increases
.59 A third 
component is the processing costs for 
CHs; this is not modelled
 as no consolidated 
data exists.
 4 Application of the model to two theoretical cash cycles
 The section presents an analysis of two theoretical cash cycles, both of which 
resemble typical national cash cycles 
for
 different NCBs and/or 
denominations.
 Following a sensitivity analysis conducted on the two base
 cases
,                                                                     57  Including all NCB costs for lodging, unpacking, processing, destruction of unfit notes, repackaging of fit 
notes, storing and reissuing.
 58  Including production, transport, storage and handling costs. 
 59  For more in
-depth studies the model
 also outputs the residual value of false
 unfit notes using a linear 
depreciation from fitness level 1 to a definable residual value at the Eurosystem threshold (50).

are 
discussed in more detail
. 4.1
 Definition of two cash cycles
 The two cash cycles 
used, representing the cash cycles of
 two theoretical 
countries
, are identical in all aspects (e.g. theoretical life of 
a banknote, 
accuracy of sorting sensors used) except for the involvement of the CHs and 
the NCB.
 In Cash Cycle
 1, the NCB is actively involved
 and recirculation by CHs is 
limited. 
Cash Cycle
 2 represents a country where CHs 
recirculate 
a large share of 
the vol
ume of banknotes in circulation. The values 
of the input parameters 
for
 the 
two cycles are shown in
 Table 1

. * The note replacement volume and costs quoted here do not include notes needed to increase the circulation volume 
(as they are not 
replacing unfit notes). The additional cost due to new notes needed to increase circulation volume is, in this case, •2.5 mil
lion in the 
first year for both cash cycles ([1billion notes in circulation] increased by [5%], at [•50 per 1,000 
new notes]).
 ** Excluding CH processing costs.
 The two cycles studied, despite using notes with the same theoretical note life, 
result in a different note life in circulation.
 In Cash Cycle
 2 fewer banknotes are 
returned to the NCB (2
 billion against 5 
billion in Cash Cycle
 1), but these are more 
soiled. This can be seen by the NCB destruction (shred) rate, which is much higher in 
Cash Cycle
 2. Even though a higher percentage of NCB
-sorted notes are destroyed in 
Cash Cycle
 2, the absolute volume of shred
ded banknotes is lower, resulting in a lower 
annual replacement of about 100 million notes. As a result notes are about 4.5 months 
longer in circulation, resulting in a substantially lower quality in circulation (14.7% unfit 
compared with 6.8% for Cash Cyc
le 1). This is expected, as the CH threshold is more 
lenient (70) than the NCB threshold (50) and the proportion of notes recirculated is 
substantially higher in Cash Cycle 2. Cost
-wise, Cash Cycle
 1 has almost twice the 
annual costs of Cash Cycle
 2. This 
is due primarily to the substantially higher NCB 
sorting volume/costs and only to a small extent to the increased replacement costs.
 4.2
 A sensitivity analysis of the model 
based 
on the two cycles
 All the model input parameters affect the final note qualit
y in circulation and 
total costs; this section examines the sensitivity of the results to the input 
parameters, identifies key drivers and examines whether changing the input 
parameters affects the two theoretical cash cycles in the same way.
 The analysis 
is based on a scenario approach. The base values of the input parameters for the two 
cash cycles (as defined in Table
 1) are modified to give new scenario values. The 
scenario values are set within ranges considered to be either within the inaccuracy of 
the respective parameter or within the expected range in which they can be adjusted 
by the Eurosystem. Parameters which are either fixed (e.g. the NCB or CH sorting 
volume) or have no impact on quality (e.g. banknote replacement or sorting costs) are 
not inc
luded in the analysis. Table
 3 presents an overview of the modification of each 
model input for each scenario. For most input parameters both an increase and a 
decrease from the base value are simulated. For every scenario the results for note

ressed as the percentage of unfit notes in circulation) and total cash cycle

 81 threshold and theoretical banknote life.
 These parameters are studied in more 
detail in Sections
 4.3.1
 and 4.3.2
. Other parameters such as banknote outflows have 
a comparable impact, but
 they are outside the control of a central bank.
 The new note fitness variations, which in the model are expressed as 
SD 
in
 fitness levels
, also significantly affect
 quality and costs
. For Cash Cycle 1, 
changing 
the SD between
 1 (highly uniform production) 
and 15 (substantial 
variations which affect soil detection
60) fitness levels 
can 
result in
 either savings of 
•1.96 million or additional costs of •5.60 million compared with the base case. The 
overall range covers about 10% of th
e total cash cycle costs. In addition, the 
simulated increase compared with the base case has a negative impact on quality, 
adding an additional 1.2 percentage points to the proportion of unfit notes
 in 
circulation. The same trend is visible for Cash Cycle
 2, with, however, a slightly 
different magnitude regarding quality and costs.
 The 
Œ difficult to determine 
Œ number of notes in active circulation has a 
substantial impact on the model results.
 As a larger note circulation volume 
results in notes
 being re
turned less frequently
 to the NCB or CHs
,61 this leads to 
more unfit notes in circulation. Subsequently the NCB note destruction volume 
increases, resulting in additional replacement costs. The behaviour is similar for both 
cycles. For an accurate modelling
 of any specific national cash cycle a good 
knowledge o
f the active circulation is required.
 Changes to the NCB sensor accuracy and CH sorting threshold or sensor 
accuracy affect the two cash cycles very differently.
 Cash Cycle
 2 reacts about 
ten times
 mor
e strongly
 to changes in 
the 
CH sensor performance (
expressed as 
SD in fitness levels
) or sorting threshold than Cash Cycle
 1. This was expected, but to a 
lesser extent, considering that the CH sorting volume in Cash Cycle
 2 is only 2.5
 times
 the CH sortin
g volume in Cash Cycle
 1. Yet it is a clear indication that in cash 
cycles with substantial recirculation, the performance of the machines used by CHs 
needs to be carefully monitored. NCB sensor accuracy has an impact on cash cycle 
costs 
which is about 3
-7 times higher 
for Cash Cycle
 1, 
indicating
 that efforts to 
improve the NCB sensor performance are most cost
-effective where the NCB 
accounts for the largest share of note sorting. The result that better CH or NCB 
sensors lead to a slightly lower note quali
ty in circulation is counter
-intuitive. The 
reason is that ﬁbadﬂ sensors sort out a substantial amount of fit notes which are close 
to the threshold (e.g. notes with 40 
Œ 50 fitness levels), which are in turn replaced 
with brand new notes. This has the sid
e-effect of cleaning the circulation, at the 
expense of destroying still fit notes.
 The model confirms that in
flows
 and outflows of notes play a substantial role 
in
 the national cash cycles of the euro area.
 In the sensitivity analysis annual 
inflows
 and o
utflows of one
-quarter of the total note circulation volume 
are
                                                                     60  Such as
, for example,
 differences in the w
atermark or paper tint
. The estimations o
f the
 SD for 
production variations are based on internal 
ECB 
studies and in the past are estimated to have 
occurred. The Eurosystem is constantly trying to reduce such production variations.

lling euro banknote quality
 82 simulated
.62 As outflows are replaced in the model with new banknotes, an increase 
in the quality in circulation, together with an increase in the replacement costs
, is observed. For incoming n
otes
, the sensitivity analysis 
studies 
inflows of two note 
qualit
y levels
 (5% and 20% unfit in the note population). 
Even when banknotes of 
good quality (with 5% unfit) enter a cash cycle, such an inflow has a negative impact 
on the circulation quality as 
it restricts the NCB™s possibility to issue new notes. This 
effect becomes more pronounced the lower the incoming note quality becomes. In 
both inflow cases
 the NCB has 
a substantially lower need for new notes as a result 
of the inflows and accordingly low
er replacement costs. 
The impact is very similar for 
both cash cycles.
 The impact of other parameters, such as the ageing model or the defect likelihood in 
relation to note fitness (increasing or constant), is small and therefore not included in 
Table
 3. 4.3 Detailed analysis of key cash cycle parameters
 The sensitivity analysis above changed 
individual
 model parameters, but kept the 
NCB sorting threshold at the Eurosystem 
threshold
 (50). In reality
, however
, an NCB 
can
 modify the sorting threshold on 
its
 machines. 
This section 
looks at 
the possibility 
of adjustments of the NCB sorting threshold
, to steer the note quality (
4.3.1
) or 
benefit 
from
 an extended note
 life (
4.3.2
). 4.3.1
 NCB sorting threshold
 An adjustment of the sorting threshold by an NCB has an
 impact both on the 
quality in circulation and replacement costs.
 In real
 life NCBs select a sorting 
threshold which meets the requirements of the cash cycle in their country. Cash 
cycles 
can be different
 owing
 to geographical, cultural and societal differ
ences. 
Chart 
7 shows the effect of 
adjusting the NCB sorting threshold
 on the two cash cycles. 
The dotted part
s of the lines indicate sensor thresholds where the notes reissued by 
the NCB would 
include
 too many unfit notes (false
 fit > 8%) and no longer co
nform to 
the minimum note quality allowed within the Eurosystem
.63                                                                     62  On the basis of Eurosystem estimates, such inflows and outflows commonly occur in national cash 
cycles.
 63  Additionally, f
or 
Cash 
Cycle
 2, no steady
-state condition could be derived at NCB sensor settings 
hi
gher
 than 75 as the resulting quality in circulation would be too low and the number of notes returned 
by CHs as unfit would be larger than the total 
annual 
NCB sort
ing capacity of 2 billion notes.

, the quality can be improved to about 2% unfit
 notes
 in circulation
. In Cash 
Cycle
 2, 
even 
with
 all notes received
 destroyed
 and replaced with new notes
,64 the
 best quality that can be reached is about 4% unfit 
notes 
in circulation. The total costs 
for Cash Cycle
 1 remain in all cases higher than for Cash Cycle
 2 owing
 to the 
constant difference of •30
 million p.a. for the additional NCB processing in Cash 
Cycle
 1 (5
 billion notes 
compared 
with
 2 billion for Cash Cycle
 2).
 The question arises 
of whether
 a higher NCB sorting volume
 is beneficial.
 This 
is not immediately evident
 from Cash Cycles 1 and 2
, as a substantial difference in 
the
 cash cycle 
costs is due to 
a different quality in circulation
 but also to the different 
annual NCB processing costs
. To answer this question we therefore need to look at 
note replacement costs
 for the two cash cycles 
in relation to the 
percentage of unfit 
note
s in ci
rculation
 (see 
Chart 8
).                                                                     64  By sorting at an NCB fitness threshold of 1.

. Note: The chart refl

by adjustment of 
the 
NCB sorting threshold.
 Chart 8 shows that a
s long as there are more than about 10% unfit notes in 
circulation, the replacement costs are identical in both cycles. However, with a hig
her 
frequency of notes 
being returned 
to the NCB (as in Cash Cycle
 1), the quality of 
notes in circulation can be raised to about 5% with only a linear increase in 
replacement costs. 
If NCB processing volumes 
are lower 
(Cash Cycle
 2), the point 
where any f
urther improvement in note quality comes at exponentially higher 
replacement costs is already at about 10% unfit in circulation.
 Understanding the relationship between 
the extent of NCB note processing, 
the note replacement volume
 and the achievable note q
uality in circulation is 
especially relevant for the Eurosystem.
 The replacement costs for banknotes are 
shared by an allocation of the total note production volume according to each NCB™s 
share in the ECB™s capital
.65 The 
NCB 
note processing costs are
, on the other hand
, covered by 
the
 NCB
 in question
. 
Each NCB must therefore ensure that its 
involvement in the cash cycle is sufficient to achieve the required national note 
quality without an overproportionate note consumption. The level of the NCB™s 
invo
lvement also needs to take into account the other factors influencing the national 
cash cycle, such as national differences in note life, inflows/outflows or the role of 
CHs.
 4.3.2
 Increasing banknote life
 As already mentioned, 
one input in 
the model 
is th
e theoretical note life, which is the 
average time a note 
takes 
to become gradually soiled from new (fitness level 1) to 
the Eurosystem threshold (50). An increase in this parameter corresponds either to 
                                                                    65  Using a

 The total cost savings due to an extended note life could become even larger if 
the NCB decides to 
maintain
 its existing
 level of 
quality in circulation despite 
issuing notes with a longer 
life.
 An NCB can achieve this by adjusting 
its
 sorting 
threshold to settings which are more lenient than the Eurosystem threshold. This 
change in sorting policy is of course only possible within the limit of 8% false
 fit notes 
which can be 
reissued by the 
NCB
.

banknotes
, which have been 
protected 
against soiling 
by an additional varnish 
layer.
 Varnishing has resulted in a substantial decrease
 of about 50%
 in the note 
replacement volume, resulting for the •5
 note
 in annual savings of about 500 million 
new banknotes at a stable quality in circulation 
as 
found by the 
quality survey
. The 
2012 annual destruction of the first series •5 notes amounted to 1.1
 billion notes,

be replaced at 
a similar note volume in 
circulation.

 Box 
1 Modelling country
-specific cash cycles based on real data
 The circulation model 
developed 
can be a valuable tool for decision
-making. In the case of well
-defined cash cycles, 
such 
as 
those
 presented in the sensitivi
ty analysis, the impact of various 
policy
-related factors can be comprehensively studied and 
better
 informed decisions can be made.
 When, however, 
more detailed 
quantitative results are needed for a specific country, the success of 
such an analysis depends
 heavily on how well the cash cycle can be defined, in other words on the 
calibration of the model. Some of the parameters are known for every country: for example
, the 
NCB sorting threshold or the NCB and CH processing volumes. Other parameters of the model
, however, might not be well defined, or even not obtainable 
from
 the 
data 
current
ly available. Such 
parameters 
are the active circulation, the theoretical note l
ife, the likelihood of defects, or the 
inflows
/outflows. In this case, the inputs 
for
 the model 
are calibrated
 on the basis of
 expert 
estimation, which carries the danger of inaccuracy or error.
 With an increasing volume of real
-life data becoming availabl
e and increasing possibilities 
for
 processing incoming data streams, it becomes less and less necessary to rely on expert 
estimation to model a cash cycle.
 There is currently a clear trend 
towards
 new sorting machines 
collect
ing
 and stor
ing
 detailed fitnes
s data per banknote. This in principle allows 
banknotes to be 
monitored 
individual
ly and the model
 parameter
s that govern the main steps of the cash cycle
 to be 
extracted
. With this outlook in mind, the possibility 
of build
ing
 an alternative 
circulation 
model based 
on available data from sorting centres was explored.
 Data 
were taken 
from an 
external 
circulation 
trial (ECT) that took place in three countries. An ECT is an exercise
, designed to 
accurately simulate country
-specific cash cycles, 
where one or 
more NCBs issue within a very short

 Modelling euro banknote quality
 88 period (1
-2 weeks) a statistically relevant number of banknotes, which are then monitored, typically 
by serial number reading in NCB cash
 centres. 
The alternative model
 treats each banknote as an 
independent agent, which
 has a number of attributes: soil value, age (since issuance) and time 
since last sorting. This allows more complex relationships to be modelled. The work carried out 
focused on extracting statistical estimates of the ageing rate, the return frequ
ency and 
the defect 
likelihood.
 The alternative
 model
™s
 results were validated 
for
 the three countries participating in the 
ECT against known figures on a number of aspects, covering the quality in circulation and 
the unfit rates at NCB and CH sorting.
 The overall 
results 
were considered to be relatively
 promising. In most of the cases the quality in circulation 
was
 predicted with reasonable accuracy
, taking into account the uncertainty of the real
-life figures on note quality in circulation. However
, there were som
e non
-negligible discrepancies between the model results and the real
-life figures. 
These were attributed mainly to inaccuracies in the data (
due for instance 
to 
technical limitations of 
fitness sensors or the difficult
y of account
ing
 for effects of CH sor
ting on the note quality at the 
NCB) or unknown/not included parameters (e.g. migration was not modelled because of the 
absence of information on 
the fitness profiles of 
inflowing notes).
 Lessons 
were 
learnt from this modelling approach
. The data collection used was not specifically 
designed for the purposes of modelling banknotes in circulation. It is clear that the quality of the 
data has a significant impact on the quality of the data
-based model itself. Moreover, simulating all 
the re
levant aspects of a cash cycle can be challenging 
owing
 to the lack of accurate data, for 
instance data on the CH sorting. The success of such a modelling approach, therefore, lies in the 
existence of a well
-designed and controlled data collection, reflect
ing the actual circulation and 
mitigating technological limitations.
  5 Conclusions
 Applying 
the ECB™s
 computer
-based circulation model to two theoretical cash 
cycles
 enabled
 significant
 parameters governing 
bank
note quality and overall 
cash cycle costs 
to be identified
. 
The model showed that the quality of notes in 
circulation increases when (1) 
notes 
are returned more frequently 
to the central 
bank, (2) sorting at the central bank becomes more severe and (3) banknotes have 
an increased resistance to soil 
and defects. The first two factors imply additional 
costs, however; the former
 for note
 processing and transport
, and the latter
 for 
replacement notes. 
A balance between the ideal return frequency and severity of 
central bank sorting 
must be struck
 for 
each individual 
cash cycle.
 Increasing 
banknotes™ resistance to soil increases the note quality in circulation and reduces the 
annual replacement costs. Further savings can be achieved if a central bank applies 
a more lenient sorting policy, so that the incre
ase in quality is traded for additional 
savings in the replacement note volume.
  The model also quantified the impact of additional factors. 
Increasing the 
accuracy of NCBs™ fitness sensors yields savings primarily in cash cycles 
with a 
higher 
NCB involvem
ent in 
the 
sorting of notes 
directly 
from circulation.

 Modelling euro banknote quality
 89 CHs play a substantial but comparatively smaller role in quality and cash cycle costs. 
Model assumptions for note ageing were shown to have an even smaller impact on 

note quality.
 The studies showed that the note quality in a cash cycle is 
also 
heavily 
influenced by 
factors outside the control of the Eurosystem such as 
the active 
circulation volume 
and
 inflow
s 
and outflows of banknotes due to migration 
and tourism.
 While data
 on such factors 
are difficult to obtain
, a 
consistent 
individual data recording of the fitness properties of each single banknote processed 

at NCB level
 would
, while ensuring an anonymous
 use of banknotes, substantially 
improve figures compared 
with
 current estimates.
 The Eurosystem is currently working to 
evaluate and improve its fitness 
sensors and algorithms in order to deliver consistent and linear fitness values 

which are linked to 
human perception.
 This will allow NCBs to better monitor and 
adjust their circulation quality as well as provide more reliable data to be used in 
future modelling.
