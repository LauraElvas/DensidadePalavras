 Overview
 At its monetary policy meeting on 
9 March
 2017, 
the Governing Council 
concluded that 
a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still 
needed
 for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline 
inflation in the medium term.
 The ECB™s monetary policy measures have 
continued to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are necessary to 
secure a sustained convergence o
f inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 
2% over the medium term.
 The ongoing pass
-through 
of these measures 
to 
borrowing conditions for firms and households benefits credit creation and supports 
the steadily firming recovery of the euro area 
economy. Headline inflation has again 
increased, largely on account of rising energy and food price inflation. However, 
underlying inflation pressures continue to remain subdued. The Governing Council 
will continue to look through changes in HICP inflation
 if judged to be transient and to 
have no implication for the medium
-term outlook for price stability.
 Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 
9 March

7 Global activity 
has continued its recovery.
 Global growth
 improved in the second 
half of last year and is expected to 
have 
remain
ed sustained at the start of 2017, 
albeit at a modest pace 
from a
 historical perspective.
 Global headline inflation 
has 
increased in recent months, following the rebound in oil prices, w
hile slowly 
diminishing spare capacity is expected to give some support to underlying inflation 
over the medium term.
 Since the Governing Council™s monetary policy meeting in December
 2016 euro area sovereign bond yields have risen slightly and have exhibi
ted some 
volatility.
 Corporate bond spreads have fallen and remain lower than 
the levels 
recorded 
in early March 2016 when the corpo
rate sector purchase programme
 was 
announced. Broad equity prices have risen in the euro area 
and a similar increase 
has bee
n observed in the United States. The value of the euro 
has 
depreciated 
slightly
 in trade
-weighted terms.
 The economic recovery in the euro area is 
steadily firming
. Euro area real GDP 
increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2016, following a 
similar pace of growth in the third quarter. Incoming data, notably survey results, 
have 
increase
d the Governing Council™s
 confidence that the ongoing econ
omic 
expansion will continue to firm and broaden.
 Looking ahead,
 the pass
-through of the ECB™s monetary policy measures is 
supporting domestic demand and facilitates the ongoing deleveraging 
process

 3 financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. Moreover, rising 
employment, which is also benefiting from past structural reforms, is having a 
positive impact on households™ real disposable income, thereby providing suppor
t for 
private consumption. 
In addition
, there are signs of a somewhat stronger global 
recovery and increasing global trade. However, economic growth in the euro area is 

expected to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms 
and remaining balance sheet adjustment needs in a number of sectors.
 The 
March
 2017 ECB
 staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.
8% in 201
7, by 1.7% 
in 2018 and 
by 
1.6% in 
2019. Compared with the December 2016 E
urosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised upwards slightly 
for
 2017 and 2018. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have become 
less pronounced, but remain tilted to the downside and relate pre
dominantly to 
global factors.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate
, euro area annual HICP inflation 
increased further to 2.0% in February
, up from 1.8% in January 2017 and 1.1% in 
December 2016.
 This reflected mainly a strong increase in annual energy an
d unprocessed food price inflation, with no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in 
underlying inflation.
 Looking ahead, headline inflation is likely to remain at levels 
close to 2% in the coming months, largely reflecting movements in the annual rate of
 change of energy prices.
 Measures of underlying inflation, however, have remained low
. They
 are 
expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by 
the ECB™s
 monetary policy measures, the expected continuing economic recovery and the 
corres
ponding gradual absorption of slack.
 The 
March 2017 ECB 
staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual HICP inflation at 
1.7
% in 201
7, 1.
6% in 201
8 and 1.7% in 201
9. By comparison with the December 2016 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic 
projections, the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised upwards 
significantly for 2017 and slightly for 2018, while remaining unchanged for 2019. The 
staff projections are conditional on the full implementation of all 
the
 ECB™s
 monetary 
policy measures.
 The 
ECB™s 
monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 are 
providing 
significant support
 for
 borrowing conditions for firms and 
households and thereby credit flows across the euro area.
 Broad money growth 
remained 
generally
 stable in January 2017. At the same time, lending to the private 
sector continued its gradual recovery in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in January. 
Low interest rates and the effects of the ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy 
measures continue to
 support 
the financing conditions of the real economy
. The 
annual flow of total external financing to non
-financial corporations is estimated to 
have strengthened further in the fourth quarter of 2016.
 Over the coming years, the general government budget d
eficit and debt ratios 
for the euro area are projected to remain on a downward path.

However, e

 Monetary policy decisions
 Based on the regular economic and monetary analyses
, the Governing Council
 confirmed the need for a continued very substantial degree of monetary 
accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels 
that are below, but close to, 2% w
ithout undue delay.
 The Governing Council 
decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged
 and continue
s to expect them 
to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the 

horizon of 
the net asset purchases. Regarding
 non-standard monetary policy 
measures, 
the Governing Council
 confirm
ed that 
it will continue to make purchases 
under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of •80 
billion until the end of 
March
 2017 and that, from April 2017, 
the
 net asset purchases 
are intended to continue at a monthly pace of •60 billion until the end of December 
2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a 
sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its infla
tion aim. The net 
purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from 
maturing securities purchased under the APP.
 Moreover, the Governing Council 
confirmed that i
f the outlook bec
ame less favourable, or if financial conditions 
became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the 
path of inflation, 
it would stand
 ready to increase 
the
 asset purchase programme in 
terms of size and/or duration.

 Global activity improved in the second
 half of 
last
 year and 
growth is expected 
to
 remain sustained in the first quarter of 2017
, 
albeit
 at a modest pace when seen in 
historical perspective
. 
Global headline inflation 
has 
increased in recent months, 
following the rebound in oil prices
, while 
slowly diminishing spare capacity is 
expected to give some support to underlying inflation over the medium term
. Global economic activity and trade
 Global growth is expected to remain sustained, albeit modest by historical 
comparison
. Recent data releases co
nfirm the improvement in global economic 
activity in the second half of 2016 and point to sustained growth in early 2017. 
Looking forward, both advanced 
economies 
and emerging market economies 
(EMEs) are anticipated to 
support growth
. In particular, 
fiscal
 policy stimulus 
is expected to strengthen activity in the 
United States
 while 
the gradual easing of deep 
recessions in some of the larger commodity exporters 
will support growth in EMEs.
 However, 
uncertainty remains elevated 
owing to a number of factors, 
including 
the 
design
 of the new US administration
™s policies 
and their effects 
on the US economy
 and any spillovers to global activity
; the strength of
 the recovery in commodity 
exporters
; 
the gradual rebalancing of the Chinese economy
; and
 future 
relations 
between the United Kingdom and the European Union.
 Although financial conditions 
have overall 
remained supportive, they 
tightened in some EMEs
. Volatility 
has 
remained low across financial markets in 
the last few weeks
, with stock markets in adva
nced economies recording further 
gains. US long
-term bond yields rose slightly, while 
remaining
 at low levels in other 
advanced economies. By contrast, financial conditions tightened in some EMEs, as 
sovereign spreads increased and currencies depreciated, 
particularly the Turkish lira 
and the Mexican peso. Capital outflows from EMEs 
overall 
showed some relief, 
being less persistent than in previous episodes of uncertainty
; however,
 outflows 
from China were 
significant
 in December, halted only by strong cont
rol measures 
from authorities
. Box

US election and compares them with the

 of 2013.
 Monetary policies remained accommodative, but divergence across advanced 

economies is incr
easing
. The 
federal 
funds futures
 curve has shifted upwards
 in 
recent months
, following the 
Federal Open Market Committee™s decision in 
December
. By contrast, 
the stance of 
the Bank of England and 
of 
the Bank of Japan 
remained accommodative (see Chart 1). 
This divergence, which reflects 
heterogeneous economic performance across advanced economies
, has also been 
reflected in exchange rate adjustments

. Recent data releases 
confirm a sustained momentum in global growth in the 
last quarter of 2016
. Excluding the euro area, the global composite output 
Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI)
 rose to 53.3 in 
the fourth quarter of 2016
, from 
51.5 in the previous quar
ter, pointing to a 
recovery
 in global growth in the second 
half of 
last
 year. The global composite output PMI 
at the start of 2017
 reaffirmed this 
trend (see Chart 
2). At the country level, quarterly PMIs rose in all major advanced 
economies
 in the last qu
arter of 2016
. Among 
EMEs
, quarterly figures also edged 
higher in China and Russia, but retreated 
in India 
Œ in 
the aftermath 
of the recent 
demonetisation policy 
Œ and in Brazil, remaining below the 50

 in both 
of these countries
.

-term averageﬂ refers to the period from January 1999 
to February 2017.
 Economic activity in the United States ended the year on a more solid note
, supported by consumer spending and a recovery in investment
, as the adjustment in 
the energy sector and the negative effects of the strong dollar on firms™ profitability 
diminished
. S
olid consumer spending and a recovery in private investment
 should 
support a moderate expansion in 2017. Thereafter,
 economic activity i
s expected to 
expand at a stronger pace, mostly 
on account of a more expansionary fiscal stance 
that
 is likely to be pursued by the new administration
. In the United Kingdom, 
economic activity has been surprisingly resilient in the 
aftermath of the referen
dum on EU membership
. While investment stagnated in 
the last quarter
 of 2016 
amid the 
ﬁBrexit
ﬂ-related uncertainty, private consumption 
contributed 
significantly 
to GDP growth
, its 
slowdown c
ompared with the previous 
quarter notwithstanding. However, e
cono
mic activity is expected to slow down over 
the course of 2017. The exchange
-rate driven increase in consumer prices is 
expected to curtail private consumption, while firms™ investment decisions are likely 

to be affected by the 
uncertainty surrounding Brexi
t. In Japan, real GDP 
decelerated in the last quarter of 2016, as domestic demand 
weakened
. Net exports supported by 
a weaker yen and recovering activity abroad 
contributed 
more 
to real GDP growth than 
did 
domestic demand
. 
In the short
-term 
horizon, 
growth
 should be 
supported by significant fiscal and monetary policies

as well as 
foreign demand
. Looking further ahead, a
s support from last year
™s fiscal stimulus package gradually vanishes
, economic activity 
is expected to
 decelerate 
over time 
towards
 the potential output growth rate
. China™s growth 
strengthened in the last quarter of 2016, supported by strong

 8 growth is expected to remain on a gradual downward trend. 
In particular, i
nvestment 
growth will continue to moderate as overcapacity is gradually cut back
. Real GDP growth in 
central and eastern Europe 
decelerated 
over
 2016 due to 
the slower 
drawdown of EU funds at the beginning of the new budget period
. Weaker external demand has also contributed to the slowdown. 
However, i
n the 
medium term, economic activity is projected to remain relatively resilient, on the back 
of solid consumer spending,
 improving labour markets and higher absorption of EU 
funds
. Signs of
 a rebound
 from the deep recessions 
in large commodity exporters 
are 
mixed
. In Russia, 
quarterly real GDP growth turned positive in 
the third quarter of 
2016, supported mainly by net expo
rts
. While
 the
 central bank has kept its key 
interest rate unchanged, the 
Russian 
rouble strengthened and equity markets surged 
on the back of
 the rebound in oil prices
. However, going forward, 
fiscal challenges 
are expected to 
weigh on the business enviro
nment and the lack of fixed investment 
and structural reforms 
may well undermine
 growth potential
. In Brazil, 
real GDP 
dropped more than expected in 
the second half of 
2016. Economic activity in the 
near term should benefit from 
slowly stabilising business
 confidence, improving 
terms of trade and loosening financial conditions
; however, 
recurring political 
uncertainties and fiscal consolidation needs continue to weigh on the medium
-term 
outlook
. Global trade improved in the second half of 2016 and is expect
ed to maintain 
its momentum 
in the first quarter of this year
. Excluding the euro area, global 
imports were revised slightly upwards in the third quarter of 2016, confirming the 

rebound from the first half, and available indicators 
suggest
 positive short
-term 
prospects. According to 
data from CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Analysis 
(CPB)
, the volume of world imports of goods increased by 0.
6% in 
Dec
ember (in 
three
-month
-on-three
-month
 terms), slightly below the pace in the third quarte
r but 
still pointing to sustained growth
 (see Chart 3). The global PMI for new export orders 
has continued to increase in the last few months, pointing to improving global trade 
momentum at the start of this year. 
Further ahead, while the outlook is subjec
t to 
some uncertainties 
regarding
 the 
United States™ future 
trade policies, world trade 
is expected to 
expand broadly in line with global activity

 Overall, global growth is projected to increase gradually over 
the period 
2016-19. According to the Marc
h 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, world 
real GDP growth excluding the euro area is projected to accelerate from 3.1% in 
2016 to 3.5% in 2017 and 3.8% in 2018
-19. Euro area foreign demand growth is 
expected to increase from 1.6% in 2016 to 2.8% in
 2017, 3.4% in 2018 and 3.5% in 
2019. Compared with the December 2016 projections, global growth 
has been 
revised slightly upwards, reflecting some data revisions and the inclusion of 
the 
expectation of some 
fiscal stimulus in the US
 baseline projection. M
eanwhile euro 
area foreign demand growth has been revised 
upwards in 2016
-17, 
reflecting 
stronger import data in the second half of 2016
; but 
marginally downwards in 2019, 
largely on account of expectations of weaker import growth in 
Latin America and 
Chin
a. The uncertainty surrounding the baseline projections for global activity 
remains elevated, with
 the balance of risks tilted to the downside.
 Key 
downside risks include an increase in trade protectionism 
that is gaining strength 
across advanced economies
; 
a disorderly tightening of global financial conditions
, 
which could 
affect
 in particular 
vulnerable EMEs
; possible 
disruptions associated 
with China™s reform and liberalisation process
; and, lastly, possible disruptions 
caused by 
political and 
geopolitical uncertainties
, 
such as
 future relations between 
the United Kingdom and the European Union.
 Global price developments
 Global headline inflation increased in recent months, following the rebound in 
oil prices
. In the OECD countries, annual consumer price index (CPI) inflation 

increased to 2.3% in January, 
going back to levels not seen 
in almost five years. This 
was
 mainly driven by the 
increase in 
energy prices, which 
rose by 8.5% year on

USD 
52 to 
USD 
56 per 
barrel since the agreement 
of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC) on 30 November 2016 
to cut output
. Global oil production 
dropped in January, mirroring declines in both 
OPEC and non
-OPEC countries. 
While OPEC production recorded one of the largest output cuts in its history, 
non-OPEC members participating in the output deal also contributed to what 
was
 the 
biggest month
-on-month decline in global oil supply since Septembe
r 2008
. 
However, looking forward, non
-OPEC output is set to increase in 2017 driven mainly 
by countries outside the output deal (
the United States
, Canada and Brazil), with US 
shale production already showing production increases in December 2016
. 
Non
-oil 
commodity prices have increased by around 1% (in 
US dollar
 terms) over the past 
few weeks, mainly driven by a rise in the price of iron ore to a near three
-year high, 
which was partly offset by a fall in food prices
. Looking ahead, global inflation is expe
cted to rise slowly
. The recent increase in 
oil and other commodity prices are expected to support headline inflation in the short
 term. Further ahead, slowly diminishing spare capacity at the global level is expected 

to give some support to underlying inf
lation over the medium term
. However, as 
the 
current oil futures curve anticipates very stable oil prices over the projection horizon, 
the future 
contribution from energy prices to inflation 
is expected to be 
very limited

 Within the euro area, sovereign yield spreads have widened as a result of 
political uncertainty. 
The overall stable developments in the GDP
-weighted 
average of sovereign bond yields mask some heterogeneo
us intra
-euro area 
developments. Sovereign yield spreads widened in several countries (see Chart 6). 

This was especially evident in France, where increased political uncertainty 
surrounding the upcoming presidential election led to some volatility in sover
eign 
yield spreads. The ten
-year French yield spread to the risk
-free overnight interest 
swap rate ended the review period around 20 basis points wider, after widening by 

up to 40
 basis points during the review period. In countries with a lower rating, a 
similar widening of the spread was observed.

of further decreases in the deposit facility rate (DFR).
 The

that 
market participants continue 
to expect a prolonged period of negative EONIA rates with no 
further cuts to the DFR

2016, where the shorter segment of the curve was down
ward

indicative of expectations of further reductions in the DFR.

expansion is continuing and is supported by 
domestic demand
. Real GDP increased by 0.4%, 
quarter on quarter, in the fourth 
quarter of the year
 (see Chart 11).
 Domestic demand and changes in inventorie

 Notes: The latest observation is 
for 
the fourth quarter of 2016 for the unemployment rate and the third quarter of 2016 for the 
ﬁU6 
measure
ﬂ. U6 is a broader measure of labour underutilisation that also takes into consideration estimates of ﬁdiscouraged workers, 
marginally attached labour market participants and underemployed part
-time workersﬂ.
 Although the overall tendency in unemployment is 
clearly positive, labour 
market slack remains considerable when broader measures of labour 
underutilisation
 are taken into account
. While there are fewer unemployed in the 
labour market, there are still many who are not counted as unemployed, but who 
may b
e capable of competing for jobs, thus constraining wage pressures. Broader 
measures of labour underutilisation (
known as
 the ﬁ
U6 measure
ﬂ, which includes
 estimates of the numbers of 
ﬁdiscouraged workers
ﬂ, other potentially more marginally 
attached labour 
market participants and underemployed part
-time workers, who 
currently have jobs, although not with the weekly hours they would like
) remain 
elevated and have declined 
by less than has been observed for t
he unemployment 
rate (see Chart 12).This suggests
 a still considerable amount of slack in the wider 
euro a
rea labour market.
 Euro area housing markets are increasingly supporting the growth 
momentum
. The recovery in euro area housing markets has been more delayed 
and much weaker compared 
with
 overall euro a
rea economic activity. Recently
, however, increasing numbers of countries 
have been showing
 positive year

growth rates in major housing market indicators (see Chart 1
3). It thus seems 
that
 many euro area housing markets are moving into an expansion
ary phase. However, 
the strength of this recovery is overall 
still 
relatively muted and heterogeneous 
across countries. Looking ahead, improving financial conditions, higher confidence in

The figures, which are unweighted, can range from 0 to 19.
 Business investment also seems to have expanded in the fourth quarter
, although likely at a slower rate than in the third quarter
, as c
apital goods 
production grew only modestly.
 At the same time, according to the European 
Commission
™s survey in the first quarter of 2017, demand as a perceived constraint 
on the production of capital goods has fallen further and remains at the lowest level 
since the onset of the Great Recession. Ca
pacity utilisation also increased above 
average pre
-crisis levels in the first quarter of 2017.
 Looking ahead, t
otal investment should be further supported by the ECB™s 
very accommodative monetary policy.
 Financing conditions remain very 
supportive and pro
fit mark
-ups are expected to pick up in the context of an already 
cash
-rich non
-financial corporate sector. Moreover, the observed strong recovery in 
equity
 prices and moderate debt financing growth ha
s brought down the leverage 
ratio (debt
-to
-total assets
). The increase in profits of non
-financial corporations 
should encourage investment, 
particularly
 in the light of the need to replace capital 
after years of subdued fixed capital formation. However, the recovery of investment 
will still be held back by ri
gidities in product markets, expectations of weaker 
long
-term growth 
than in
 the past, and 
the continuing need
 for deleveraging in some 
euro area countries. In addition, the ongoing adjustment to changes in the regulatory 

environment, low bank profitabilit
y and the still high stock of non
-performing loans on 
banks™ balance sheets in a number of countries continue to weigh on the 
intermediation capacity of banks and
, in turn
, firms
™ investment funding in the near 
term.
 Euro area export growth has continued 
to pick
 up on the back of
 a gradual 
improvement in global trade.
 Total euro area exports expanded by 
1.5%, quarter 
on quarter, in the fourth quarter, driven both by services and goods trade.

same time, Latin America made a positive contribution 
alongside the
 United States. 
Up until November exports
 to the United Kingdom fell
, whereas export
s to other 
European countries 
rose. 
Indications are that euro area goods exports have 
outpaced global 
goods 
imports in the fourth quarter of 2016, thus signalling a 
possible gain in euro area export market shares
 against the backdrop of a 
depreciation of t
he effective exchange rate of the euro. 
Surveys and new export 
orders with a bearing on the first quarter of 2017 point to improving export 
momentum in the near term. Looking further ahead, exports
 to outside the euro area
 are expected to 
grow
 following a 
gradual rebound in global trade. Risks to the trade 
outlook, however, relate to possible adverse effects stemming from increased 
uncertainty relating to trade policies globally.
 Overall, surveys point to 
a robust 
growth momentum in the first quarter of 
2017. The European Commission™s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) displayed 
broad
-based improvements in January and 
remained unchanged at high levels in 
February

hand was stable in January a
nd displayed broad

The rise in the first two months of 2017 compared 
with
 the fourth quarter of 2016 
reflected an improved assessment of the current situation and robust order book

 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation in February 
2017 was 2.0%, up from 1.8% in January. Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil 

futures prices, headline inflation is likely to remain at levels close to 2% in the 
comin
g months. 
Measures of underlying inflation, however, 
have remained low and 
are expected to rise only gradually over the medium term
. T
he March 2017 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.7% 
in 2017, 1.6% in
 2018 and 1.7
% in 2019.
 Headline inflation 
increased further in February
. According to Eurostat™s flash 
estimate, HICP inflation increased further to 2.0% in February, up from 1.8% in 
January and 1.1% in December 2016 (see Chart 16
). The increase in recent
 months 
was mainly 
driven by energy inflation and
, to a lesser extent
, food inflation
, and 
brought headline inflation in February of this year to 
the highest lev
el recorded since 
January 2013.

downward indirect effects of past low oil prices but, more fundamentally, also

17 Measures of underlying inflation
 (annual percentage changes)
  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 Notes: 
The range of underlying measures
 includes
 the following: HICP excluding energy; HICP excluding unprocessed food and 
energy; HI
CP excluding food and energy; HICP excluding food, energy, travel
-related items and clothing; 
the 10% 
trimmed mean; 
the 
30% 
trimmed mean; the median of the HICP; and a measure based on a dynamic factor model. The latest observations are for 
February 2017 (
HICP excluding food and energy) and January 2017 (all other measures).
 There are only weak signs of upward pipeline price pressures
. The strong 
increases in producer price inflation for total industry (excluding construction and 
energy) since spring 2016 r
eflect mainly strong increases in producer prices for 
intermediate goods (see Chart 18). Part of these increases may 
Œ with some lag 
Œ be feeding through to prices of non
-food consumer goods further down the production 
and pricing chain. Furthermore, impor
t price inflation for non
-food consumer goods 
recorded a notable increase to 0% in January, up from 
-0.1% in December and 
-1.0% in Nov
ember.
 However, at the start of 2017, domestic producer price inflation 
for non
-food consumer goods had yet to show a clea
r upward trend, only increasing 
to 0.3% in January after fluctuating around 0.1% throughout 2016
. 
A possible 

explanation is that higher costs and prices emerging at the level of intermediate 

goods were absorbed by
 margins
 at different stages of the product
ion process, and 
that the pricing power of firms remained constrained by strong global competition.

 Wage growth has remained low by historical standards
. Annual
 growth of 
negotiated wages in the euro area was 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016
, slightly 
down 
from 1.5% in the second and 
third quarter
s of 2016. Factor
s that may be 
weighing on wage growth include still significant slack in the labour market, weak 
productivity growth and the ongoing impacts from labour market reforms 
implemented in some countries during the crisis
1. Additionally, the low inflation 
environment over 
recent
 years may still contribute to lower wage growth through 
formal and informal indexation mechanisms.
 Market
-based measures of long
-term inflation expectations have been broadly 
stable since early Dece
mber 2016, remaining somewhat below survey
-based 
measures.
 The 
upward 
trend in market
-based measures of inflation expectations
, which had been 
observed since the end of September
, flattened after 
early 
December
. Long-term market
-based inflation expectation
s were
 broadly stable
, while 
an increase 
was
 observed in the short end. More specifically, the 
five
-year forward 
rate 
five
 years ahead now stands 
at around 1.71%, or close to 50 basis points
 higher 
than the low level
s seen i
n autumn 2016 (see Chart 19
). 
Irrespective
 of the 
significant increase

 a gradual return to an inflation

 Looking ahead, HICP 
inflation in the euro area is projected
 by ECB staff
 to increase strongly from 0.2% in 2016 to 1.7% in 2017.
 The outlook for headline 
inflation 
for 2017 
has been revised significantly following the recent rise in oil prices. 
However, there are contrasting 
patterns in energy and non
-energy inflation. 
Energy 
prices are expected to account for the
 bulk of the
 strengthening in HICP inflation
 between 2016 and 2017
. 
This, in turn, reflects u
pward base effects
, together with 
recent significant increases in oil pri
ces.

at 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019
 (see

 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro areaﬂ, published on the

9 March 2017
. Note: The latest observations are for the 
fourth
 quarter of 2016 (ac
tual data) and the fourth quarter of 2019 (projection).
 In contrast to energy inflation, the expected pick
-up in HICP inflation excluding 
energy and food is 
likely to be 
much more gradual over the projection horizon.
 HICP inflation excluding energy and foo
d is
 envisaged to increase from 0.9% in 2016 
to 1.1% in 2017 and to rise to 1.6% and 1.8
% in 2018 and 2019 respectively. A main 
factor behind this gradual pick
-up is the envisaged increase in 
wages and 
unit labour 
costs as the recovery progresses and conso
lidates. Declining labour market slack 

and a gradual fading of crisis
-related factors
, which
 have held down wage growth 
over the past few years
, are expected to lead to a rebound in 
the growth of 
compensation per employee and, given a more modest projected
 recovery in 

productivity, in unit labour cost growth.
 Overall, a gradual pick
-up in underlying 
inflation should support 
the level of 
headline inflation over 2017

 Broad money growth remained broadly stable in January 2017. At the sam
e time, 
lending
 to the private sector continued its gradual recovery in the fourth quarter of 
2016 and in January. 
The annual flow of total external financing to non
-financial 
corporations is estimated to have strengthened 
further 
in the fourth quarter of 
2016.
 Growth in b
road money 
remained broadly stable in January, continuing the 
robust pace that has been largely observed since mid
-2015. The annual growth 
rate of M3 
stood at 4.9% in January 
(see Chart 2
1). 
The l
ow opportunity cost of 
holding the most liquid instruments 
in an environment of very low interest rates,
 as 
well as
 the impact of the ECB™s monetary policy measures
, continued to support 
money growth. 
In addition, a
nnual M1 growth 
remained broadly stable i
n the fourth 
quarter of 2016, as the moderating trend observed since mid
-2015 paused,
 before it 
decreased somewhat in January (8.4%, after 8.8% in December 2016).

 27 Domestic sources of money creation 
remained
 the main driver of broad money 
growth
 (see Chart 22).
 Among 
the 
M3 counterparts,
 the

™s purchases of 
general government debt securities 
(see the 
red
 portion of the 
bars in Chart 2
2), 
mainly in the context of
 the 
ECB
™s public sector purchase prog
ramme (PSPP), 
contributed positively 
to M3 growth
. 
In addition, M3 growth 
continued to be 
supported by 
domestic counterparts other than credit to general government (see the 
blue
 portion of the 
bars
 in Chart 22
). This 
was driven by the ongoing recovery in 
credit to the private sector
, together with the persistent contraction in
 MFI

. These
 longer

reserves)
, whose 
annual rate of change has been negative since 
the second quar
ter 
of 2012, 
decrease
d further
 in 
the fourth quarter of 2016 and in January. The negative 
annual growth rate was partly due to
 the 
impact of the ECB™s targeted longer
-term 
refinancing operations (
TLTRO
-II
), which act as a substitute
 for longer
-term market
-based bank funding
 and reduce the attractiveness for investors to hold long

7. MFIs™ net external assets continued to exert downward pressure on annual M3 
growth
. However, they registered a small positive monthly inflow in December and 
January. This reduced their downward pressu
re on annual M3 growth 
(see the 
yellow
 portion of the 
bars
 in Chart 22) and might suggest that the share of bond sales by 
non-residents in the context of the PSPP is moderating. PSPP

euro 
area government bonds by non

 contributed 
to the annual decline in MFIs™ 
net external assets provided that their proceeds were invested mainly in non

 According to the
 January
 2017 euro area bank lending survey
, competitive pressure 
continued to have an 
easing impact on credit standards 
for
 loans to enterprises
 and households, while banks™ willingness to tolerate risk had a tightening impact. 
Rejection rates for loan applications decreased across all loan categories. The low 

general level of interest rate
s continued to be a key factor behind the net increase in 
loan demand by enterprises and households. In addition, 
financing needs 
for 
mergers and acquisitions, as well as continued favourable housing market prospects 
and consumer confidence, contributed po
sitively to loan demand
 (see 
survey
). In this 
context, 
banks surveyed also indicated that profitability motives were the main 

reason for participating in the third TLTRO
-II operation. According to the banks, the 
main effect of the past TLTROs on loan supply was an easing of credit terms and 

conditions, while the easing impact on credit standards increased.
 Banks
™ funding conditions remained favourable.
 Banks™ 
composite 
cost of debt 
financing increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in January 2017 (see

Despite the recent increase,

7. Bank lending rates 
for NFCs and households remained at very low levels in the 
fourth quarter of 2016 and in January 2017 
(see Charts 26 and 27).
 The 
composite lending rate for 
NFC loans decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2016 
and remained broadly stable in January, at a new historical low. Over the same 
period, the composite bank lending rate for 
households 
for house purchase declined 
somewhat further in the fourth quarter of 2016, reaching a new historical low in 
December, and 
increased slightly in January. Since the announcement of the ECB™s 
credit easing measures in June 2014, composite bank lending rates for loans to 
NFCs and households 
have de
creased 
by significantly more than market reference 
rates
, signalling an
 improvemen
t in the pass
-through of monetary policy measures to 
bank lending rates. 
The decrease in banks™ composite funding costs has supported 
the decline in composite lending rates
. 
Between May 2014 and 
January
 2017, composite lending rates on loans to 
both
 NFCs and households
 fell by 
around 
110
 basis points
. The reduction 
in bank lending rates
 on NFC loans was especially 
strong in 
vulnerable countries
, thereby contributing to mitigating previous 
asymmetries in monetary policy transmission across countries
. Over the same 
period, the spread between interest rates charged on very small loans (loans of up to 

•0.25 million) and those charged on large loans 
(loans of above •1 million)
 in the 
euro area 
narrowed considerably and fluctuated around the low levels reac
hed in the 
fourth quarter of 2016 and in January 2017
. 
This indicates that small and medium
-sized enterprises 
have generally been
 benefiting to a 
greater
 extent from the 
decline 
in bank 
lending rates than large 
companies

been supported by the strengthening of economic activi
ty, further declines in the cost 
of bank lending, the easing of bank lending conditions, the very low cost of market
-based debt and larger numbers of mergers and acquisitions. At the same time, 
NFCs™ record high cash holdings have reduced the need for exte
rnal financing
. Net issuance of debt securities by NFCs increased again in early 2017, after 
moderating towards the end of 2016
. The 
latest ECB data show that issuance 
activity declined in December mainly due to seasonal factors. Preliminary data 
suggest t
hat issuance increased again in January and February. It continued to be 
supported by the ECB™s corporate bond purchases, among other factors. The net 
issuance of listed shares by NFCs contracted in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result 
of marked share bu
ybacks
, which amounted to around •7½ billion both in November 
and December
. Financing costs for NFCs 
remain 
very 
favourable
. The 
overall nominal cost of 
external financing for NFCs is estimated to have increased slightly
, on average
, in 
January and Februar
y 2017, after return
ing
 in December
 to 
its
 historically low level 
of 
July 2016
. The rise in the overall cost of financing was explained by a modest 

increase in the cost of equity
, which
 was attributable to a slight increase in the risk 
free rate, while equ
ity risk premia

 33 6 Fiscal developments
 Over the period 201
7-19 the 
general 
government budget deficit and debt ratios 
for 
the euro area 
are projected to
 remain
 on a downward path
. The 
euro area fiscal 
stance
, which was 
mildly 
expansionary
 in 2016
, is projected 
to turn broadly neutral in 
2017-19. However, e
uro area countries™ follow
-up to the 
European Commission™s 
review of 
their 
draft budgetary plans for 2017 has been unsatisfactory
, as none
 of 
the 
countries that were considere
d at risk of non
-compliance with the 
Stability and 
Growth Pact 
(SGP
) has implemented significant measures
. The euro area general government budget deficit is projected to decline over 
the projection horizon.
 Based on the 
March 
2017 ECB
 staff macroeconomic 
projections
,4 the budget deficit is expected to decline from 
1.6
% of GDP in 2
016 to 
0.9
% of GDP in 2019 (see the table). 
The projected reduction is driven by a further 
decline in interest payments and a higher primary fiscal surplus, also reflecting 

cyclic
al conditions. Compared with the December 2016 
Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections, the fiscal outlook is more favourable. Unexpected 

revenue windfalls in a few countries resulted in a better than expected outcome in 

2016. This will also positively 
affect the outcome in 2017, which, together with lower 
primary expenditures, explains the more favourable budgetary outlook for 2017
-19. Table

 34 in direct taxes in a number of countries. In
 the period 2017
-19 further 
deficit
-increasing measures on the revenue side are likely to be offset by less dynamic 
grow
th 
in 
components of 
government spendi
ng. I
n particular, compensation of 
employees and intermediate consumption are projected to grow below nominal trend 
GDP growth
 rates
, while other items, such as government investment, are foreseen 
to grow above potential.
 The changes compared with 
the 
Dece
mber 2016
 projections
 are very
 limited.
 In view of the need to find a 
balance 
between economic 
stabilisation and fiscal sustainability 
in 
a number of
 euro area countries
, a broadly
 neutral fiscal stance in 
the period ahead 
can be regarded as appropriate.
 The high
 level of
 aggregate 
euro area government debt 
is 
projected to 
continue 
to 
declin
e gradually
. The euro area debt
-to
-GDP ratio
, which peaked in 
2014, 
is projected to decline 
from 89.3% in 2016 
to 8
4.5
% by the end of 2019.
 The 
reduction in debt largely stems from 
the favourable interest
 rate
-growth differential
, which reflects better cyclical conditions
 and low interest rates. Small primary 
surpluses 
are 
also 
expected to 
have a favourable impact on the projected debt path. 
Compared with the 
December
 2016 projections, the euro area debt
-to
-GDP ratio 
has 
been revised downwards over the whole projection horizon owing to the better 
budgetary outlook and a larger contribution to debt reduction from the interest rate
-growth differ
ential
. 
Nevertheless, the ratios of m
ore than half of 
the 
euro area 
countries 
are projected to 
exceed the 60% 
of GDP reference value
 by the end of the 
projection horizon 
and in a few 
cases
 the
y are
 expected to 
actually 
increase
 over the 
projection horizon.
 Further consolidation efforts are 
needed
, notably in countries with high 
levels 
of 
debt.
 These 
countries need to set their public debt ratio firmly on a downward 
path, as they are particularly
 vulnerable to renewed financial market instability or a 
reboun
d in interest rates. Full compliance with the SGP would ensure the correction 
of budgetary imbalances and 
the 
achievement of a sustainable debt trajectory. 
By 
contrast, e
uro area countries with fiscal space 
can
 make use of the 
available 
room 
for manoeuvre
, for example by expanding public investment
. Striving for a 
more 
growth
-enhancing composition of government budgets
 would be beneficial for all 
countries. For a discussion on the concept of fiscal space, see Box 6.
 Euro area c
ountries™ follow
-up to the rev
iew of 
their 
draft budgetary plans for

6 On 
16 November, based on its a
utumn 
2016 forecast, the European Commission concluded that the draft budgetary plans of 
eight
 of the 18 Member States participating in the review were at risk of non
-compliance 
with the provisions of the SGP. These

Belgium, Italy, Cyprus, Lithuania, 
Slovenia and Finland under the

and

 reflect the fact that

 was
 broadly compliant with the SGP. 
In 
the 
subsequent 
Eurogroup 
meetings, 
the governm
ents of the countries 
that were considered at risk of non
-compliance
 committed to adopt
ing
 the measures needed to ensure compliance with 
the EU™s fiscal rules. 
However, based on the Commission™s wi
nter 
2017 forecast, 
none of the
se countries has implemented
 significant measures to address the 
identified 
consolidation gaps.
 On 22 February 
2017 the Commission released its report 
on Italy™s compliance 
with
 the debt criterion, 
which 
conclud
ed that the criterion is currently not 
complied with.
8 In line with past 
practice, compliance with the SGP™s preventive 
arm could be a mitigating factor in the assessment of compliance with the debt 
reduction benchmark. However, according to the Commission™s winter 2017 forecast, 

Italy™s public finances are assessed to be at ri
sk of a significant deviation from the 
requirements of the SGP™s preventive arm. 
According to t
he Commission
™s report, a
n additional fiscal effort of 0.2% of GDP in 2017 would be crucial 
for 
Italy to 
return to
 the adjustment path towards the 
medium
-term ob
jective (
MTO
) in 2017
. 
However, 
taking all the relevant flexibility provisions of the SGP into account
, 
this adjustment 
would only be sufficient to ensure ﬁbroadﬂ compliance with the preventive arm 

requirements
 in 2017
. 
In addition
, 
the Commission expects public investment to have 
decreased slightly in Italy in 2016, whereas the level of investment should be 
at least 
preserved
 in order to be eligible for the ﬁinvestment clauseﬂ. 
The Commission will 
take a final decision 
on whether to 
recommend the opening of an 
EDP for Italy in
 the 
spring
, based on 
the final 
data for 2016 and the C
ommission™s spring 2017 f
orecast
, as well as the implementation of 
the 
fiscal commitments 
made
 by the Italian 
authorities in February 2017.
 It is important t
hat the tools 
under
 the strengthened governance framework 
be effectively applied in a manner which is consistent over time and across 
countries.
 It is 
essential
 that 
these tools
 be used as intended to ensure sustainable 
fiscal positions in euro area countr
ies. 
In particular
, 
there is a risk that 
the debt 
rule
 may be
 sidelined if it is de facto subordinated to the 
SGP™s 
preventive arm
, which 
may give
 insufficient 
weight
 to debt sustainability concerns. 
Ultimately
, full and 
consistent implementation 
of the SG
P is key for confidence in the European fiscal 
framework.
 Moreover, on 22 February 2017 the Commission also published its assessment 
of the transposition of the fiscal compact into national legislation
.9 The Treaty 
on Stability, Coordination and Governance
 in the Economic and Monetary Union 
(TSCG) includes as its 
main provision the requirement to have a balanced budget 
rule in 
place in 
national legislation
 Œ the so

 entered into force on 1 January 2013, with a one

for transposition
 into

 on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union (TSCG),

 36 national legislation (i.e. by 1 January 2014).
 According to 
Article 8(1) of the 
TSCG, 
the Commission 
should
 report in due time on the 
transposition
 of the fiscal compact
 into national legislation
. The Commission™s assessment, which was published on 22 
February 2017, only considers the 
transposition
 of the fiscal compact into law and 
not its practical application. The Commission concluded that all ﬁcontracting parties 
have 
significantly adapted their national fiscal frameworks as a result of the fiscal 
compact requirementsﬂ, notwithstanding national differences. In particular, all 

contracting parties were found to have put in place a binding balanced budget rule, 
which is ba
cked by a correction mechanism that will be automatically triggered in the 
event of significant deviations from the MTO or from the adjustment path towards it. 
Moreover, the Commission confirmed that compliance with the rule is monitored by 
an independent 
national fiscal institution. However, for a significant number of 
countries, the Commission™s assessment of ﬁcompliantﬂ is conditional on formal 
commitments by national authorities to implement remaining parts of the fiscal 
compact. These reservations rela
te in particular to the substance of the balanced 
budget rule; the application of the ﬁcomply or explain principleﬂ if governments do not 

follow the recommendations of the independent monitoring institutions; and the 
procedures
 governing the activation
 of 
the correction mechanism
. As these are 
central elements of the fiscal compact, it remains to be seen whether the way the 
fiscal compact has been put in place will be satisfactory and sufficient for national 
fiscal frameworks to be effective.

 In both episodes

 caused a

. 
Since

stock markets in the United States have rallied, market

 38 yields and the US dollar exchange rate suggests that a positive demand shock is 
driving US asset market developments. Rising equity prices and falling bond prices, 
in particular, s
eem to have 
reflected market 
expectations of fisc
al stimulus measures
. 
Following the tapering talk in 2013, by contrast, it seems that a monetary policy 
shock 
Œ a shift in market expectations regarding the future path of monetary policy 
Œ led to the rise in US bond yields.
 As a result, t
he reaction of EM
E financial markets in recent months 
has been 
milder overall than during the tapering talk episode.
 In the weeks after the US 
presidential election, EME 
currencies
 depreciated, bond prices declined (i.e. yields 
rose) and equity prices fell markedly. The initial 
decline in
 EME bond and equit
y prices has since reversed,
 with 
EME equity prices even ris
ing
 to levels above those 
prevailing before the election, and EME 
currencies
 have bounced back. 
Conversely, 
during the tapering talk episode the decline in
 EME exchange rates and in 
bond and equit
y prices
 was significantly more persistent (see Chart B
). Indeed, the sell
-off in 
May 2013 marked the beginning of a long
-term d
ownward trend in EME asset prices 
that persisted until early 2016.

. Despite the overall benign financial market developments, downside risks 
to EME activity 
prevail
, 
related in 
particular
 to a potential incre
ase in protectionist 
sentiment targeted at key EMEs, which would harm global trade
. If 
implemented, 
protectionist 
measures could more than offset the 
potential 
gains from 
stronger 
US activity and 
would 
overall 
weigh on 
EMEs
™ economic growth. 
For 
instance, 
the possibility 
of 
rising 
protectionism has already 
contributed to 
a high
er degree of uncertainty about Mexico™s future trade prospects with 
the 
United 
States
, 
which is 
weighing on the country™s growth prospects. 
Moreover, exports of many 
EMEs typically have a high import content. These closely 
interlinked supply
 chains
 imply that any rise in 
trade barriers
 would have major r
epercussion
s and would lead 
to global feedback loops.
 Moreover, the build
-up of EME
s™ forei
gn debt
, coupled with the 
preference of 
EME 
firms
 and banks for US dollar funding
, may 
leave
 some 
EMEs
 in a 
vulnerable position
. The external debt 
of many
 EMEs expanded after the global 
financial crisis and has continued to 
expand
 since
 the 
taper tantrum
 episode
, owing 
mainly to very 
loose
 global financial conditions
 (see Chart D)
. 
As the US dollar 
strengthens and interest rates 
rise 
globally
, d
ebt service payments become 
increasingly 
onerous.
 In addition, in countries confronted with intensified inflationa
ry 
pressures 
stemming 
from the sharp depreciation of their currencies, central banks 
may
 need to tighten further their monetary policy stance, 
further 
increasing the debt 
service burden 
stemming from
 domestic currency
-denominated credit. Overall, 
the 
highe
r debt service ratio 
could 
weigh on economic activity
, causing
 negative

 recent developments in portfolio investment flows 
in
 the 
euro area financial account

 2016 the euro area™s current account surplus was 
mainly mirrored in the financial account of the balance of payments by net
 outflows 
for
 portfolio investment 
and Œ to a lesser extent 
Œ direct investment
. In 201
6 the euro area recorded net outflows 
for
 portfolio investment
, owing
 to 
rebalancing towards 
non-euro area
 debt securities
 on the part of both euro 
area and non
-euro area investors
 (see Chart A).
 In the 
case of

 pronounced shift towards 
non-euro

that had been observed 
since the second half of 2014.

 Impact of the ECB™s non
-standard measures on financing conditions: taking stock of recent 
evidence
 46 3 Impact of the ECB™s 
non
-standard measures
 on financing 
conditions: taking stock of recent evidence
 Since June 2014 the ECB has adopted a series of non
-standard monetary 
policy measures to bring infl
ation rates back to levels below, but close to, 2% 
over the medium term.
 These measures have included targeted longer
-term 
refinancing operations (TLTROs); lowering the deposit facility rate into negative 
territory; and an expanded asset purchase programme
 (APP) targeting 
a variety of
 investment
-grade
 private and public sector securities. This set of measures has been 
underpinned by forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, which are expected 

to 
remain at present or lower levels for an extended period
 of time, and well past the 

horizon of 
the
 net asset purchases
; and on asset purchases, which are intended to 
continue at their current pace 
ﬁuntil the end of December 2017, or beyond, if 
necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustai
ned adjustment 
in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aimﬂ
. In the context of its forward 
guidance, the ECB has also reiterated its readiness to increase the asset purchases 

in terms of size and/or duration, if a less favourable outlook or 
an unwarranted 
tightening in financial conditions were to materialise.
 This box takes stock of 
recent 
evidence 
on the 
eff
ectiveness
 of th
ese measures
 in supporting 
financing conditions and credit intermediation.
 The 
adoption of non
-standard monetary policy
 measures by major central banks, as well 
as their effects and the mechanisms by which they operate, have been the subject of 
much academic research in the past few years.
13 This box reviews some key lessons 
that can be distilled from this research on the e
uro area
, focusing on 
adjustments in 
financial market prices and in bank lending behaviour, which constitute the essential 
early stages of the monetary policy transmission process.
14 The box organises the 
empirical evidence according to three stylised trans
mission channels, namely the 
signalling channel, the direct pass
-through channel and the portfolio rebalancing 
channel.
 Via the signalling channel, the non
-standard measures have underpinned the 
ECB™s intention to keep short
-term interest rates low for an 
extended period of 
time and have supported inflation expectations.
 The reduction in the deposit 
facility rate to levels below zero has been a powerful instrument signalling that short
-term interest rates may stay low, or even be reduced to lower levels, fo
r a longer 
period
 than would have been expected otherwise; this has reinforced the effect of 
the ECB™s APP on the entire yield curve.
                                                                     13  For the United States, s

 Impact of the ECB™s non
-standard measures on financing conditions: taking stock of recent 
evidence
 47 A substantial part of the 
decline in the expected path of 
short
-term interest rates can be ascribed to the non
-standard monetary policy measures.
 Chart A compares 
two constellations of three
-month overnight index swap 
(OIS) forward rates (which are a proxy for market 
expectations r
egarding the evolution of nominal short
-term interest rates).
15 The first constellation is observed 
in May 2014, 
i.e
. just prior to the launch of the non
-standard measures; the second constellation is 
observed immediately after the Governing Council 

meeting
 on 22 January 2015 when the APP was 
announced. Over the period from May 2014 to January 
2015 market expectations regarding interest rates were 

revised downwards markedly, as reflected, for instance, 
in the decline of OIS rates three years ahead, which fel
l by around 70 basis points
. In addition to the monetary 
policy measures, a variety of factors may possibly have 

contributed to these changes in market expectations. 
Within the literature, one method used to identify the contribution of the ECB™s 
measures 
is to examine 
changes in asset prices 
around policy 
announcement
 dates
 (an approach often referred to as ﬁevent
-study evidenceﬂ).
16 This approach confirms 
that a relevant part of the decline in the expected path of short
-term rates can be 
ascribed to the no
n-standard monetary policy measures.
17 Moreover, this approach 
shows that the measures have exerted signalling effects on infl
ation expectations
, 
which have increased markedly, in particular around the various APP announcement 
dates.
18 This re
-anchoring of i
nflation expectations is instrumental in achieving a 
sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.
19                                                                     15  In principle, 
OIS 
forward 
rates
 may not fully reflect expected future short
-term rates because they may 
embody
 a term premium component
. In view of t
he focus
 on short 
and 
medium
-term maturities
, this 
consideration is somewhat less relevant,
 given 
that 
for
 such maturities the
 compensation for term 
risk 
tends 
to be
 more
 contained
. 16  As financial markets are forward looking, asset prices will respond to policy measures when
 expectations of those measures are formed and revised, notably around the tim
e of policy 
announcements. Similar event
-study approaches have been used to assess the policy measures 
adopted in the United States and the United Kingdom. For the United States, see, for instance, 
Krishnamurthy, A. and Vissing
-Jorgensen, A.,
 op. cit
.; and
, for the United Kingdom, see Joyce, M.A.S., 
Lasaosa, A., Stevens, I. and Tong, M.,
 op. cit
. 17  The signalling channel has also contributed to reducing uncertainty surrounding future interest rates. As 
lower interest rate volatility decreases the likelihoo
d of large swings in the interest rate, it also makes 
bonds with long maturities less risky, and hence induces a compression in term premia
. 18  For instance, it has been found that the APP announcement in January 2015 raised inflation 
expectations across all maturities, with an impact ranging between 10 and 30 basis points for a 
maturity of five years on inflation expectations derived from inflati
on
-linked swap contracts. See

 48 Via the d

pronounced easing in the market segments targeted by the non

 As well as inducing a broad

 been designed 
to
 directly
 improve the way in which the 
resultant stimulus is passed through to the borrowing conditions of households and

banks located in vulnerable countries that have 
participated in TLTROs 
have lowered their lending rates by more than non
-participat
ing banks
.21 This has 
helped steer the monetary stimulus to private sector borrowers in the euro area who 
have been most in need of accommodation.
 Finally, via the portfolio
-rebalancing 
channel
, the ECB™s non
-standard 
measures have compressed risk premia across a wide range of asset classes.
 Central bank asset purchases
 typically entail the absorption of medium to
 long
er-                                                                    20  The TLTROs are 
targeted operations, as the amount that banks can borrow is linked to their loans to 
non
-financial corporations and households
. The incentive mechanism works through price effects under 
TLTRO II
: if
 participating banks 
outperform their specific quantitativ
e benchmark for credit creation,
 the 
interest rate on their TLTRO II borrowings 
decreases relative to the standard borrowing cost 
Œ equal to 
the rate on the main refinancing operation applicable at the time of settlement 
Œ and can fall as low as 
the intere
st rate on the deposit facility applicable at the same time.

 49 term bonds

-duration
ﬂ central bank re
serves. 
As a result, 
investors
 have an incentive to rebalance their portfolios towards other, riskier market 
segments, while accepting lower compensation for holding this risk. This is because 
central bank purchases free up risk
-taking capacity in the priv
ate sector and drive 
down risk
-adjusted returns on the assets targeted by the purchase programmes, 
hence inducing investors to consider alternative
 investments.
 In order to shed light 
on this channel, Charts D and E show changes in the yields on securities
 for 
selected euro area sovereigns during the press conference on 22 January 2015 
when the APP was announced.
22 As the theory predicts, 
the longer the term to 
maturity
, the sharper the decline in yields was. Broader asset price reactions are also 
consistent
 with the view that the ECB™s measures have brought about an easing in 
financial conditions, which was evident from the improvement in stock markets and 
the decline in corporate bond yields around this announcement. Arguably, c
onfining 
th
e assessment to th
e market reaction on 22 January 2015 when the official 
announcement was made does not 
captur
e the 
evidence
 that 
ECB communications 
hinting at 
the
 imminent
 launch of a 
purchase programme began 
to 
affect market 
expectations as early as September 2014
. When these anticipation 
effects are 
accounted for
, the response of asset prices is qualitatively similar to the response 
seen following the APP announcement 
on 22 January 2015
; quantitatively, 
the APP 
explain
s the bulk of the decline observed in euro are
a long
-term 
bond yields
 since 
September 2014.
23 Moreover, risk premia 
have 
been compressed across a wide 
range of asset classes, 
suggesting
 spillovers to non
-targeted assets.
 In the case of 
later recalibrations of the APP, it has become increasingly challen
ging to identify their 
effects via event studies, because
 market participants have
, over time,
 gradually 
revised their expectations 
regarding
 policy packages 
on the basis of
 the 
continuous 
stream of economic data releases.
24 At the same time, available stud
ies that seek to 
address this challenge by using time series and 
cross
-sectional 
variation in asset 
prices and asset purchase volumes also confirm that the ECB™s measures 
explain 
the bulk of the decline 
observed 
in euro area long

since Sep

 The rebalancing channel has not only affected financial assets, it has also 
given banks incentives to improve credit conditions 
for hous
eholds and non
-financial corporations
 alike.
 A host of empirical analyses highlight that the different 
measures have had a mutually reinforcing impact on bank lending conditions.
26 For 
instance, on the liability side, the TLTROs have brought funding relief 
for banks 
participating in the operations; at the same time, the APP and the interest rate cuts 
have led to a compression of funding costs for the banking system as a whole. On 
the asset side, the negative interest rates on excess liquidity have reinforced
 
portfolio rebalancing effects. This is because the implicit charge applied on excess 
reserves has increased the velocity of circulation of excess reserves in the money 
market, and thus has improved the relative attractiveness for banks of granting loans 

or holding securities with a higher return. At the same time, the precise patterns of 
the resultant improvements in credit conditions have varied across different types of 
bank and/or across countries.
 In the case of banks with greater recourse to TLTROs an
d tighter balance 
sheet constraints, the measures have tended to be transmitted as a reduction 
in lending rates.
 For instance, banks located in vulnerable countries with high levels 
of participation in TLTROs have responded to policy measures primarily by 
lowering 
                                                                    26  See, for instance,

 Impact of the ECB™s non

evidence
 51 interest rates on lending to non
-financial corporations.
27 In such cases, the flow of 
credit has recovered only gradually amid, 
inter alia
, a structural need for 
deleveraging and weak cyclical demand on the back of a slow economic recovery in 
vulne
rable countries. The strong pass
-through to lending rates 
in 
the 
countries that 
were hit hardest by the 
financial 
crisis largely reflects a
 normalisation from earlier
 impair
ments
. This has also resulted in a reduction in the dispersion of bank lending 
rate
s and receding fragmentation in terms of financing conditions across euro area 
countries.
28 In the case of banks holding excess liquidity and facing significant demand for 
credit, the stimulus has tended to result in an improvement in credit volumes.
 As a r
esult of the ECB™s measures, banks located in countries where the economic 
recovery has been firming more rapidly have rebalanced their portfolios by extending 

the provision of credit. In these countries, the impact on the cost of borrowing is less 
signifi
cant than in more vulnerable economies, possibly because spreads and 
premia were already compressed. Moreover, the relatively solid balance sheet 
positions of banks in less vulnerable economies have provided scope for asset 
expansion. Finally, complementar
y evidence suggests that 
negative policy rates
 have amplified portfolio rebalancing incentives, as 
increase
s in 
credit volumes have 
been found to be particularly significant in the case of banks
 with 
high 
levels of 
excess liquidity
.29 Taken together, t
he evidence supports the ﬁbank lending viewﬂ of monetary 
policy 
transmission, according to which banks™ balance sheet conditions 
affect 
the terms and conditions of bank credit.
 The evidence also shows that the 
transmission of asset purchases in a bank
-based 
system such as the euro area is 
not weaker than in systems in which 
capital market
s take centre stage. Coupled with 
negative interest rates and targeted lending operations, the 
ECB stimulus has 
led to
 tangible improvements 
in borrowing conditions 
for
 the r
eal economy

 52 4 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the 
period from
 26 October 2016 to 24 January 2017
 This box describes the ECB™s monetary policy operations during the seventh 
and eighth reserve maintenance periods of 2016, which ran fr
om 26 October to 
13 December 2016 and from 14 December 2016 to 24 January 2017 
respectively.
 During this period
, the interest rates on the main refinancing 
operations (MROs), the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility remained 
unchanged at 0.00
%, 0.25% and 
-0.40% respectively.
 On 21 Dec
ember, the third targeted longer
-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) in the 
second series of TLTROs (TLTRO
-II) was settled for an amount of •62.2 billion. The 
liquidity injected by that operation was partially offs
et by voluntary repayments for the 
second TLTRO
-I operation, which 
totalled
 •14.2 billion. The net liquidity injection of 
•48.0 billion resulted in the total outstanding amount for both TLTRO programmes 
rising to •545.7 billion at the end of the review per
iod. In addition, the Eurosystem 
continued buying public sector securities, covered bonds, asset
-backed securities 
and corporate sector securities as part of its expanded asset purchase programme 
(APP), with a target of •80 billion of purchases on average 
per month.
 Liquidity needs
 In the period under review, the average daily liquidity needs of the banking 
system, defined as the sum of autonomous factors and reserve requirements, 

stood at •993.2 billion, an increase of •85.2 billion compared with the previ
ous 
review period (i.e. the fifth and sixth maintenance periods of 2016).
 This 
increase in liquidity needs was attributable almost exclusively to an increase in 

average net autonomous factors, which rose by •84.3 billion to a record high of 
•875.2 billion,
 while minimum reserve requirements rose only marginally (see the 
table).

 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 26 October 2016 to 24 
January 2017
 54 The increase in autonomous factors was largely the result of an increase in 
liquidity
-absorbing factors.
 The main contributor to that increase was 
average
 demand for banknotes, which increa
sed by •14.9 billion to 
stand at 
•1,110.5 billion
, broadly in line with usual year
-end patterns. 
Average o
ther autonomous factors also 
increased, rising by •13.0 billion to stand at •682.3
 billion. 
Average g
overnment 
deposits were more or less unchanged, i
ncreasing by just •0.1 billion to 
stand at 
•152.0 billion.
 Liquidity
-providing autonomous factors decreased over the review period, 
as a 
result of
 the continuing decline in net assets denominated in euro, coupled 
with a slight decrease in net foreign asset
s. Average net assets denominated in 
euro fell to •388.4 billion, down •51.5 billion from the previous review period, on 

account of a decline in financial assets held by the Eurosystem for purposes other 
than monetary policy, combined with an increase in l
iabilities held with national 
central banks by foreign official institutions. It is likely that these institutions 
increased their holdings 
as a result of
 limited investment opportunities in the market. 
Average n
et foreign assets decreased by •4.7 billion 
to •681.5 billion.
 The volatility of autonomous factors remained elevated, broadly unchanged 

from the previous review period.
 That volatility primarily reflected fluctuations in 
both 
government deposits and net assets denominated in euro.
 Liquidity 
provided through monetary policy instruments
 The average amount of liquidity provided through open market operations 
Œ both tender operations and the asset purchase programmes 
Œ increased by 
•257.2 billion to stand at •2,179.9 billion (see the chart).
 This
 increase was 
primarily due to the ECB™s expanded asset purchase programme.
 The average amount of liquidity provided through 

tender operations increased by 
•29.7 billion to 
stand at •563.2 billion.
 The increase in the liquidity 
provided by TLTROs more than offset the dec
lin
e in the 
liquidity supplied via regular operations. 
Average 
liquidity provided via MROs and three
-month LTROs 
decreased by •6.4 billion an
d •6.1 billion respectively, 
while the 
average 
outstanding amount of TLTROs 
increased by •42.1 billion
, largely
 as a net effect of the 
settlement of the third TLTRO
-II operation and voluntary 
early repayments for funds borrowed via the second

-I opera
tion.

 55 backed securities purchase programme and the corporate sector purchase 
programme rose by •198.2 billion, •11.2 billion, •1.9 billion and •24.2 billion 
respectively. The redemption of bonds held under the Securities Mar
kets Programme 
and the two previous covered bond purchase programmes totalled •8.1 billion.
 Excess liquidity
 As a consequence of the developments detailed above, average excess 
liquidity rose by •172.0 billion to stand at •1,186.7 billion in the period und
er 
review (see the chart).
 In the seventh maintenance period, 
average 
excess liquidity 
rose by •98.9 billion on account of liquidity provided by the APP. The smaller 

increase of •88.8 billion in the eighth maintenance period was mainly the result of a 

•51.8 billion dec
line
 in liquidity
-providing autonomous factors, which partially offset 
the liquidity provided by the expanded asset purchase programme. In addition, the 

pace of asset purchases under the purchase programmes was somewhat slower in 
the eighth ma
intenance period 
owing
 to the Christmas period.
 The increase in excess liquidity was mainly reflected in higher average current 
account holdings, which rose by •105.8 billion to stand at •867.8 billion in the period 
under review. Average recourse to the de
posit facility increased by •67.2 billion to 
stand at •437.1 billion.
 Interest rate developments
 Overnight money market rates remained close to the deposit facility rate
 (with 
some rates falling below it)
, while record low rates were observed over the 
year
-end 
period 
in the repo market.
 In the unsecured market, the EONIA (euro 
overnight index average) averaged 
-0.350%, down marginally from an average of 
-0.342% in the previous review period. The EONIA fluctuated within a relatively 
narrow range, with a high
 of 
-0.329% on the 
final
 day of 2016 and a low of 
-0.356%. 
Furthermore, in the secured market, average overnight repo rates in the GC Pooling 
market declined slightly to
 stand at
 -0.405% and 
-0.399% for the standard and 
extended collateral baskets respecti
vely, both down 0.004 percentage point relative 
to the previous review period.
 Core collateral rates reached historic lows over 
the 
year
-end period
 amid supply 
constraints. For instance, the 
one-day RepoFund
s Rate for German collateral 
reached 
-4.9% over 
the 
year
-end period
, while the French equivalent reached 
-5.3%. 
In comparison, the 
one-day RepoFund
s Rate for German collateral averaged 
-0.86% 
over
 the 
whole of the 
period under review, while the 
rate for French collateral 
averaged 
-0.75%. 
Rates for 
Itali

 with 
data for the third quarter of 2016. These data (together with a separate

In 
particular,

 Conceptual issues surrounding the measurement of fiscal space
 59 6 Conceptual issues surrounding the measurement of fiscal 
space
 Recommendations 
for the conduct of budgetary policies frequently refer to 
countries' ﬁfiscal spaceﬂ.
 For example, on 5 December 2016 the Eurogroup 
highlighted that 
ﬁthere a
re considerable differences across 
Member 
States in terms 
of fiscal space and budgetary consolidatio
n needs
ﬂ.30 Accordingly, policy 
recommendations often refer to how fiscal space can be generated, for example 
through the implementation of growth
-friendly structural reforms.
31 Fiscal space generally describes governments™ scope for budgetary 
manoeuvre whil
e preserving overall fiscal soundness.
 However, there is no 
commonly agreed approach to measure it. Instead, estimates of ﬁfiscal spaceﬂ differ, 
depending on the method or model used. Different approaches have evolved in 
recent policy discussions. They can
 be grouped into three broad categories, 
depending on whether they account for possible constraints on fiscal policies arising 
from (i) existing fiscal frameworks, (ii) risks to debt sustainability or (iii) so
-called 
ﬁdebt limitsﬂ, i.e. estimates of debt r
atios beyond which governments™ ability to 
honour debt obligations becomes questionable.
32 This box reviews and assesses 
these different concepts in the context of the EU™s fiscal governance framework.
 Starting with the first constraint, EU Member States™ f
iscal space derives from 
the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and from national fiscal frameworks.
 The 
provisions of the SGP guide countries towards sustainable budgetary positions over 
the medium term. 
The
se are captured by so
-called ﬁmedium
-term budgetary
 objectivesﬂ (MTO), which are 
defined 
as structural budget balances
, i.e.
 corrected for 
the impact of the economic cycle and temporary measures. 
MTOs
 are country
-specific and set by 
the government
, 
and are 
conditional on respecting minimum 
values 
that are 
calculated according to a common methodology.
33 Against this 
background, the si
mplest
 measure of fiscal space 
within
 the SGP is the distance 
of a 
country's structural balance 
to the MTO.
 According to the European Commission's 
2017 winter forecast, only three euro area countries (Germany, Luxembourg and the 
Netherlands) are expected to outp
erform their MTOs in 2017 (see the t
able).
 For 
countries that have not yet met their MTOs, t
he SGP 
recommends an 
appropriate 
effort to do so.
34 Compared with the 
country
-specific recommendations for 2017
, 
structural efforts towards achieving sound budgetary positions are expected to fall 

short of commitments under 
the SGP in many countries (see the t
able).
 Thus, o
nly 
a                                                                     30  See the main results of the 
Eurogroup meeting on 5 December 2016
. 31  See, for 
example, ﬁ
Priorities for structural reforms in G20 countries

background

surveillance note, IMF, Washington, 2016.
 32  For another way to categorise existing approaches, see ﬁU
sing the fiscal levers to escape the low
-growth trapﬂ, 
Economic Outlook
, OECD, November 2016.
 33  According to the SGP, MTOs are designed to serve three goals: (i) Member States maintain a safety 
margin that prevents them from breaching the 3% Maastricht Tr
eaty deficit reference value during 
cyclical downturns; (ii) Member States™ debts are sustainable
, taking into consideration the economic 
and budgetary impact of ageing populations; and (iii) Member States have room for budgetary 
manoeuvre, particular
ly when it comes to preserving public investment.

 Conceptual issues surro
unding the measurement of fiscal space
 60 few countries are likely to have any 
Œ limited
 Œ fiscal space
 relative to the adjustment 
requirement this 
year
. The EU
™s fiscal framework is asymmetric
. Countries falling short of adjustment 
requirements are asked to step up consolidation eff
orts. In addition, in some 
countries, the national fiscal frameworks may impose fiscal adjustments that are 
more demanding than those under the SGP. 
By contrast, the SGP does not require 
countries with room for budgetary manoeuvre to use it.

The table excludes Greece, which is subject to a financial assistance programme. 
*The structural effort requirements refer to those outlined in the country
-specific 
recommendations for 2017; they may 
be lower 
if countries 
are
 granted flexibility for, inter alia, the implementation of structural reforms or government investment. In turn, adjustment 
requirements are higher for countries 
whose
 debt reduction benchmark is the binding requirement under the SGP. This aim
s to ensure sufficient progress in reducing high debt levels 
towards 60% of 
the 
GDP debt reference value. 
**This grouping into risk categories refers to the risks identified in the Commission™s 
ﬁmedium
-term
ﬂ debt sustainability analysis
. The 
Commission™s sustainability framework includes a comprehensive ﬁmedium
-termﬂ 
analysis
 (over a 
ten
-year horizon)
, along with the ﬁS1ﬂ indicator. Two additional indicators are used 
by the European Commission to capture risks: the ﬁS0ﬂ indicator
 (for ri
sks over the short run
) and 
the ﬁ
S2ﬂ indicator
 (for risks over the (very) long run
). In particular, 
ﬁS2ﬂ calculates 
the upfront fiscal adjustment required in order to stabilise the debt
-to-GDP ratio over the infinite horizon, including financing for any ad
ditional expenditure arising from an ageing 
population
. The availability of fiscal space under the EU™s fiscal rules also reflects 
economic and other developments.
 A number of provisions in the SGP explicitly 
allow for
 cyclical developments and other facto
rs. Following the Commission™s 
January 2015 communication on flexibility within the EU™s fiscal framework, 

adjustment requirements under the SGP's preventive arm have been made 
dependent on the output gap. Adjustment towards the MTO may also be carried out
 more slowly in the event countries implement structural reforms or raise

 Conceptual issues surrounding the measurement of fiscal space
 61 investment.
35 Regarding debt reduction requirements, various relevant factors such 
as low inflation and growth may reduce the necessary adjustment needs.
36 Furthermore, the ﬁgeneral es
cape clauseﬂ, which has so far never been applied, in 
principle allows amendments to fiscal adjustment in the event of a severe economic 
downturn, provided debt sustainability over the medium term is not endangered.
 Turning to the second constraint above, 
available f
iscal space 
can be derived 
from
 the comprehensive analysis of 
debt sustainability
. There is no single 
measure of whether, in practice, debt is sustainable. Comprehensive debt 
sustainability analysis (DSA) presents
 both 
projected 
debt dynamics 
and the level at 
which debt stabilises
 in a central scenario (benchmark) and
 in the presence of 
various adverse 
shocks. DSA also takes into 
account other relevant indicators
, such 
as a government™s gross financing needs, 
its fiscal framework, 
the 
maturity 
structure 
of government debt, the scope for contingent liabilities, the quality of institutions and 

political risks.
37 Given the need to project debt developments over long horizons, a
ny 
DSA 
is sensitive to the assumptions applied. 
According to the European 
Commission™s latest Debt Sustainability Monitor
38, a sizeable number of countries 
are facing elevated or high risks to debt sustainability over the medium term (see the 

table)
39. Most euro area countries thus have very little or no room for budgetary 
manoeuvr
e under this methodology. As the table shows, the results following this 
approach are closely related to those derived from rules
-based fiscal space: 
generally, countries with elevated or high risk
-to
-debt sustainability are also those 
whose debt ratios ex
ceed the 60% of GDP reference value by the greatest margin 
and whose structural budgetary position is furthest from the MTO.
40 Regarding the third constraint, t
he concept of fiscal space in relation to 
ﬁdebt 
limits
ﬂ captures the room for budgetary manoeuvre as 
the 
distance between 
current debt ratio a
nd a level
 beyond which sovereigns 
risk not honouring 
their debt obligations.
41 The specification of such debt limits is either directly linked 
to the government™s abilit
y to raise revenue, or it is gauged more broadly as the point 
where political fatigue is estimated to prevent the consolidation measures necessary 

to stabilise rising debt. Different approaches model the 
shocks assum
ed to
 hit 
                                                                    35  For details, see the box entitled ﬁFlexi

 39  No 
euro area c
ountry 
is facing high risks in the short run according to the results based on the ﬁ
S0ﬂ indicator, while only one country is facing high risks over the (very) long run according to results based 
on the ﬁS2ﬂ indicator.
 40  In principle, a low interest rate environme
nt increases a government™s fiscal space derived both from 
the SGP and from constraints associated with the level of debt: lower interest payments improve 

structural balances and debt sustainability.
 41  See, for example, Gosh, A.R., Kim, J.I., Mendoza, E.,
 Ostry
 J.D. and Quereshi,
 M., ﬁFiscal fatigue, 
fiscal space and debt sustainability in advanced economiesﬂ, 
Economic Journal
, Vol. 123, 2013. 
Another approach is related to capturing the steady
-state debt level, i.e. the debt
-to-GDP ratio towards 
which an 
economy tends to converge in the long term. It is operationalised by discounting historical 

primary balances by a positive interest
-growth differential. In Gosh et al., estimates of sustainable debt 
ratios captured like this range from 62% to 74% of GDP ac
ross euro area countries.

 The 2017 macroeconomic imbalance procedure and implementation of the 2016 country
-specific recommendations
 63 7 The
 2017 macroeconomic imbalance procedure and
 implementation of the 2016 country
-specific
 recommendations
 On 22 February 2017 the European Commission published the European 
Semester Winter package
 which includes the conclusions reached following the 
applicat
ion of the 
macroeconomic imbalance procedure (MIP)
, as well as an 
assessment of the progress with reforms in each Member State since the adoption of 
the relevant country
-specific recommendations (CSRs) in July 2016.
 Outcome of the 2017 MIP assessment by th
e European 
Commission
 The MIP was introduced in 2011 and is now in its sixth year of application.
 It 
seeks
 to prevent the
 emergence of harmful macroeconomic imbalances 
in EU 
countries 
and to 
correct them whe
re they are excessive.
 Following 
a screening 
exercise in autumn each year 
on the basis of a set of indicators, the 
European 
Commission
 conducts in
-depth reviews 
of selected countries (included in the annual 
country reports) to 
assess the severity of 
any imbalances. If 
such 
imbalances are 
found to exi
st, the Member State
 concerned receives policy recommendations from 
the Council
 of the European Union 
Œ based on recommendation
s by 
the 
European 
Commission
 Œ under the 
preventive arm
 of the procedure
. 
Where
 the 
imbalances are 
found to be excessive
, the exc
essive
 imbalance procedure 
(EIP) may be 
initiated 
following
 a recommendation 
to the Council by
 the Commission.
43 Under
 this 
corrective arm
 of the procedure,
 a corrective action 
plan must be provided to explain 
how the excessive imbalances will be addressed
. In 
the event
 of repeated failure
s to 
provid
e an adequate plan
, or 
if 
an approved plan
 is not complied with
, the
 Council 
may impose financial sanctions on the euro area country in question.
 In its assessment
, the European Commission identified six countries with 
excessive imbalances: Bulgaria, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal 
(see Table A).
 Excessive imbalances have been identified in each of these 
countries, with the exception of Cyprus, since 2015
. Cyprus was added to this list in 
2016, after exiting its economic and financial adjustment programme in March of that 
year. Looking back over a longer period, the number of countries assessed by the 
Commission as having excessive imbalances has increased
 each year since 2012, 
and only stabilised this year (see Chart A). This trend has to some extent been 
driven by countries whose economic adjustment programmes have ended and which 
have therefore been automatically reintegrated into the regular EU surveill
ance 
processes. While the adjustment programmes have helped to reduce imbalances, 
overall vulnerabilities in those countries remain high and therefore close monitoring 
is still essential. Nevertheless, even allowing for such ﬁautomaticﬂ inclusions, the 
number of countries in the ﬁexcessive imbalancesﬂ category has not declined. This 
                                                                    43  See R

(EU)

il of 16

 The 2017 macroeconomic imbalance procedure and implementation of the 2016 country
-specific recommendations
 64 appears to be consistent with the finding from the assessment of the implementation 
of CSRs made in 2016 (see below) that reform remains slow despite the challenges 
faced by the
se countries. Only Spain and Slovenia have managed to move out of the 
ﬁexcessive imbalancesﬂ category, while Italy has now been included in it for the 
fourth year.

These countries were each the subject of an in

were assessed in 
the alert mechanism report 
Œ which is 
the first stage of the MIP 
Œ as having no imbalances.
 ** In the cases of Italy, Cyprus

 the Commission will specifically review whether their respective National Reform Program

policy measures. If satisfied that this is the case, the Commission will not invoke the corrective arm of the MIP

country

 The 2017 macroeconomic imbalance procedure and implementation of the 2016 country
-specific recommendations
 65 As in the previous year
, the Commission 
has again 
identified
 imbalances
 (although not excessive)
 for 
Germany, Ireland, Spain, Netherlands, Slovenia and 
Sweden
. By contrast, in the case of Finland the 
Commission closed the procedure after concluding that 
the imbalances identified last year were no longer 
present, owing (among other things) to strong policy
 measures implemented by the government to recover 

competitiveness.
 While one can observe an increase in the number of 
countries with no imbalances
 in 2016
, 
it does not 
follow
 that
 their
 endeavour
s to implement reforms
 should cease
. Most euro area countrie
s are still far 
from achieving best practice in terms of well
-functioning 
labour and product market policies.
44 Empirical work 
also suggests that there is a strong link between higher 
quality institutions and both higher resilience to shocks 
and higher grow
th performance.
45 Such countries thus 
require further reforms to increase their resilience and 
competitiveness.
 Despite having identified excessive imbalances in 
six
 countries, the 
European 
Commission is 
not 
proposing 
at this stage 
to activate the excessive
 imbalance 
procedure (
i.e. the corrective arm of the procedure
). Since the creation of this 
procedure it has been the view of the ECB that the MIP tools 
Œ including the full 
corrective arm of the procedure 
Œ should be fully employed in relation to those 
countries with excessive imbalances. This has also been explicitly called for by the 
five Presidents in their 2015 report.
46 The use of such tools is desirable not only in 
order to increase the economic prospects of the relevant country itself, but also to 
help facilitate economic adjustment processes inside the euro area and reduce euro 
area
-wide vulnerabilities. It is thus in the interest of the euro area as a whole.
 Although t
he Commission
 has not for the moment activated the corrective 
arm,
 it has 
announced that t
hree of the countries with excessive imbalances 
(Italy, Cyprus and Portugal) have been asked to propose particularly ambitious 
policy measures in their National Reform Programmes (which are to be 

submitted by April
 2017). In the event that 
those programmes do not contain the 
required policy measures, the excessive imbalance procedure could be opened in 
May. For each country which it has assessed as having an imbalance or an 

excessive imbalance, the Commission will conduct a specific monitori
ng mission 
appropriate to the severity of the imbalance.
                                                                     44  ﬁIncreasing resilience and long

 66 Assessment of the implementation of the 2016 country
-specific 
recommendations
 Overall, EU Member States have taken insufficient steps to implement reforms 
in response to the CSRs made in 
2016 (Table 
B).
 The European Commission has 
concluded that the overwhelming majority 
Œ more than 90% 
Œ of reform 
recommendations have been followed by only ﬁsomeﬂ or ﬁlimitedﬂ progress in 

implementation, while just two (out of around 90) CSRs have been substantially 
implemented, and none have been fully implemented. This weak reform momentum 
stands in stark contrast to the finding that the number of countries with excessive 
imbalances has not fallen.
 Despite their greater vulnerability, the six countries 
identified las
t year as having excessive imbalances did not on average 
Œ with the 
exception of France 
Œ achieve significantly higher implementation rates than the 
average EU Member State. This is particularly surprising in the case of Portugal and 
Croatia, as these coun
tries committed themselves to an ambitious reform agenda in 
2016, following which the Commission decided not to apply the EIP.

 The 2017 macroeconomic imbalance procedure and implementation of the 2016 country
-specific recommendations
 67 Looking back at the implementation of CSRs during 
the past three years, reform efforts have continued 
to weaken despite the fact that the number of CSRs 
has fallen.
 Last year the Commission concluded t
hat 
most countries had made only ﬁsomeﬂ or ﬁlimitedﬂ 
progress in implementing the CSRs made in 2015. This 
year, the number of cases where ﬁsubstantial progressﬂ 

has been made or where CSRs have been ﬁfully 
addressedﬂ is even lower (see Chart B). The 
Commis
sion™s decision to 
significantly 
reduce
 the 
number of 
CSRs made in 2015
 in order to allow 
Member States to focus on 
key priority
 issues of 
macroeconomic and social relevance
 did not produce 
the desired effect of increasing reform efforts.
 Overall, Member S
tates have implemented 
proportionally fewer recommendations on product 
market policies than on labour market policies.
 According to the Commission™s assessment, the 
implementation of product market reforms was 
particularly weak when viewed in comparison wi
th other 
policy areas (e.g. labour market reforms). Examples of 
product market
-related CSRs include calls for Member States to: (i) lower barriers 
preventing new firms from entering network industries (energy, transport, 
communication, etc.); (ii) open up 
closed professions; and (iii) improve regulatory 
frameworks in order to foster competition. Improvement in all of these areas is key to 
achieving stronger productivity growth and fostering investment.
 Full and effective use of all instruments available 
under the MIP 
Œ including its 
corrective arm 
Œ is needed
 to increase the momentum of reform
. The further 
slowdown observed in the implementation of reforms is in sharp contrast to both the 
need to address major vulnerabilities that continue to exist in man
y euro area 

countries and the need to increase resilience. The poor track records of countries in 
this regard suggest that policy commitments made by Member States in their 
National Reform Programmes and repeated calls by the Commission for decisive 

action
 are insufficient to evidence and enforce reform. The tools available under the 
corrective arm of the MIP are well suited to improving reform efforts, thereby 
increasing the resilience of individual countries and enhancing the functioning of 
Economic and M
onetary Union.

 1 The impact of global value chain participation on current 
account balances
 Œ a global perspective
 Participating in global value chains may improve an economy™s competitiveness and 
thereby raise its current account balance. Specifica
lly, an economy™s 
competitiveness may increase as a result of substituting imported for 
domestically
 produced
 intermediate goods. The increase in competitiveness boosts the 

economy™s exports and raises its income. If it is expected that other economies wil
l eventually catch up in terms of competitiveness by also participating in global value 

chains, the economy™s competitive edge 
Œ and thus the rise in income 
Œ is only 
temporary. As a consequence, part of the income gain will be saved, raising the 
economy™s
 current account balance. 
This article provides empirical evidence 
suggesting that a rise in global value chain participation 
relative to the rest of the 
world 
has a positive impact on 
an economy™s current account balance
. 
Results from 
widely
 used reduced
-form current account regression models suggest that 
economies 
that
 participate more in global value chains 
than their trading partners 
also display larger current account surpluses 
or smaller current account 
deficits. 
Differences in the extent to which cou
ntries participated
 in global value chains 
appear to
 explain a substantial fraction of the current account surpluses 
that were 
observed 
in the run
-up to the global financial crisis.
 1 Introduction
 A salient feature of the global economy 
over
 the last 
few 
decades has been the 
existence of large and persistent 
global
 imbalances.
 For example,
 the years prior 
to the global fi
nancial
 crisis were marked by
 some emerging market economies, 
commodity exporters and some advanced economies 
running
 large
 current a
ccou
nt 
surpluses, matched by defi
cits in particular 
in 
the
 United States
. Several 
studies
 have shown that part of these global imbalances can be 
explained
 by differences in 
financial market development across economies, in particular by the lack of fi
nancial 
development in emerging market surplus economies.
47 At the same time, the debate 
about the driving forces
 underlying large 
and persistent 
current account surpluse
s in 
several advanced economies 
is still ongoing. Understanding the determinants of 
external imb
alances is critical for academics
 and po
licymakers, because such 

determinants play an important 
role in the transmission of 
domestic shocks and 
policies
 across borders 
in an 
increasingly
 integrated world.
                                                                     47  See, for example,

 The impact of global 
value chain participation on current account balances 
Œ a global 
perspective
 69 Another 
striking
 feature of the global economy duri
ng the last 
few 
decades 
has been the rise 
of 
global value chains.
 The increasing dispersion of 
stages of
 production across countries
 was s
purred by 
a number of factors. The decline in 
transportation costs amid large wage differences between advanced and em
erging 
market economies made the internationalisation of supply chains profitable. 
Moreover, a
dvance
s in information a
nd communication technologies made the 
complex coordination of production processes at distance possible
.48 A further factor 
was 
the adopti
on of trade
-liberalising policies
 over the past few decades.
 The fragmentation of 
production chains 
across countries led to a steady 
increase in
 the share of
 trade 
accounted for by intermediate goods
. This 
development continued at least until the start of the global financial crisis
. 
Trade in 
intermediate goods and services now accounts for 
a very large share of 
overall trade 
flows in goods and services.
49 The regional dispersion of
 the research and 
development underlying the iPod, the manufacturing 
and assembly 
of its 
components as well as its sale and distribution in local markets is a 
well
-known
 example of global value
 chain fragmentation
.50 Global value chains 
may have effects on a wide range of econo
mic outcomes
. Several
 studies
 have 
shed light on the effects
 of global value chains by documenting 
the increas
ed fragmentation of production across borders. Drawing on newly 
developed input
-output tables,
 these 
studies
 have developed frameworks to 
measure 
trade in valued added and econom
ies™ and individual sectors™ 
integration in 
global value chains.
51 Building on these 
insights
, other
 studies
 have been concerned 
with the economic implications of global value chains. For example,
 participation in 
global valu
e chains appears to boost growth
52, amplify cross
-country
 monetary policy
 spillovers
53 and render an economy
™s income
 distribution more uneven
. This article 
examines
 the role of global value chain
s in current account
 balances
 from a global perspective
.54 It presents empirical evidence suggesting 
                                                                    48  See, for example,

 The impact of global value chain participation on current accou
nt balances 
Œ a global 
perspective
 70 that economies which participate more in global value chains than other economies 
exhibit larger current account surpluses or smaller current account deficits.
 The 
evidence
 also 
suggest
s that the impact of global 
value chain participation on current
 account 
balances is economically significant.
 For example, 
about 
a quarter of the 
large US 
current
 account 
deficit during the run
-up to the global financial crisis that 
cannot be explained by other fundamentals
 can be e
xplained by its
 limited 
relative 
participation
 in g
lobal value chains
. The 
finding that
 global value chain participation improves an economy™s 
current account balance
 has important policy implications.
 In particular
, 
it 
implies that
 persistent 
deviations f
rom a balanced 
current account
 do not, as is often 
argued, reflect
 domestic distortions, but 
are in fact welfare
-maximising outcomes 
against the background of diff
erences in economies
™ competitiveness. As a 
consequence,
 policies 
aimed at n
arrow
ing
 global i
mbalances should focus 
on measures that facilitate participation
 in global value chains. For example, 
adopting 
policies that facilitate innovation and reduce
 protectionist 
barriers
 may 
help
 to 
improve 
an economy™s
 competitiveness by fostering 
its
 global va
lue
 chain 
participation; similarly, 
multilateral initiatives aimed at trade and fi
nancial 
liberalisation
 may also 
reduce an economy™s
 external imbalances by fostering 
participation in 
global value chain
s. The article is structured as follows:
 Section 2 reviews the evolution of global 
imbalances and global value chain participation over the last 
few 
decades
; Section 3 
discusses the mechanism through which global value chain participation may 
affect
 an economy™s current account balance;
 Section 4
 reports results from 
an analysis of 
cross

 empirical
 relevance of 
participation in 
global value chains for
 current account balances
; and
 Section 5 concludes.
 2 The evolution of global imbalances and participation in 
glo
bal value chains
 2.1
 Global current account imbalances
 The period before the global financial crisis was 
characterised
 by a build
-up of 
large external imbalances
 (see Chart 1)
. While the
 United States accumulated 
large current account deficits, China, Japa
n and oil
-exporting economies recorded 
large surpluses. At the time, the consensus view was that an eventual 
Œ possibly 
rapid 
Œ unwinding of these imbalances could trigger a crisis.
55 The International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) repeatedly advocated policy measure
s that would facilitate a 
smooth unwinding in the context of a multilateral consultation process.

 The impact of global value chain participation on current account balances 
Œ a global 
perspective
 71 The global financial crisis was followed by a rebalancing process.
 Between 
2007 and 201
5 surpluses and
 deficits 
declined markedly
. For G20 economies, the 
ave
rage absolute current account balance relative to GDP fell from 4.7% in 2007 to 
3.9% in 2015; in GDP
-weighted terms, it fell from 3.6% to 2.6%, as larger economies 
underwent a stronger rebalancing.
 The global financial crisis that was triggered by 
other fa
ctors thus preceded the unwinding of global imbalances. While it is difficult to 
decompose current account balances into structural and cyclical components, the 

evidence suggests both contributed to the rebalancing after the global financial 

crisis.
57 Chart
 1 Evolution of global current account balances
 (percentages of world GDP)
  Source: 
IMF World Economic Outlook.
 Adjustments in 
major surplus and deficit 
economies
 contributed markedly to 
the reduction in global imbalances
. For example, the US current account deficit 
fell from 1.6% of world GDP in 2006 to 0.6% in 2015. In China, the current account 
surplus dropped from 0.6% of world GDP in 2007 to an average of about 0.3% 

between 2009 and 2015.
 In Japan, the persistent curre
nt account surplus of around 
0.3% of world GDP between 2005 and 2010 subsequently almost disappeared, 

partly on account of a changed economic policy environment with the temporary halt 

in nuclear energy production and the effects of the ﬁAbenomicsﬂ policie
s introduced 

in 2012.
 Rebalancing 
was
 a global 
phenomenon
 across advanced and emerging market 
economies
. This can be seen by the relationship between the current account 
positions of the countries monitored in the IMF World Economic Outlook in 2007 and 
the
 changes in their current account balances between 2007 and 2015 (see Chart 2).

economies, the constellation of 
current account 
surpluses and deficits remained broadly 
unchanged
. Chart 3 shows that the bulk of economies

1990-2005 remained in surplus (deficit) in the

The rebalancing process 
seems to have come to a halt across G20 economies in 

general, as there is a positive correlation between 
current account balances in 2013 and the change in 
current account balances between 2013 and 2015 
(see

 73 2.2
 Global value chain participation
 Measuring global value chain participation is challenging
. One 
measure 
of 
ﬁdownstream participationﬂ, i.e. how much a country is using imports in its production 
of exports, 
is the ratio of domestic 
value added
 in an economy™s gross exports, or 
ﬁVAXﬂ ratio.
58 Low values of the VAX ratio
 indicate that a large share of an 
economy™s 
gross 
exports 
reflect
 the value added of 
foreign inputs
. The production of 
the iPod may again serve as an illustrative examp
le of downstream participation: 
while the iPod is exported from China, 
the 
actual 
value added 
in China is very 
limited, consisting
 mainly 
of low
-skilled assembly services
. 
The major part of the 
value is 
produced 
by firms in the 
United States
, Japan, 
South 
Korea and Taiwan 
through delivery of sophisticated intermediate inputs
.59 China therefore has a low 
VAX ratio in terms of the iPod, and is, according to this downstream metric, 
participating strongly in the global value chain of the iPod. Another measure of
 downstream participation, the ﬁbackward participationﬂ measure,
 can be constructed 
as the ratio of an economy™s gross intermediate inputs to total gross output on the 

basis of data from the World Input
-Output Database (WIOD).
60 Box 1 presents a 
discussion 
of 
the WIOD and the backward participation measure
. Global value chain participation has risen significantly since the 1970s.
 Historical data show that there has been a secular decline in the VAX ratio (see 
Chart 5). An increasingly large share of an econo
my™s gross exports thus represents 
imported value added, i.e. imported intermediates that are used in the production of 
exports. Global value chain participation has also risen when measured by backward 

participation (see Chart 6).
 The rise in global value
 chain participation has been a global phenomenon
. The cross
-country mean of back
ward participation has increased 
in tandem with 
its 
dispersion
, measured by the standard deviation
 (see Table
 1). This
 suggest
s that the 
rise 
in back
ward participation over th
is period has been spread relatively evenly 
across economies
 and in line with the limited increase in the range between the 
minimum and maximum values of backward participation
.                                                                     58  See Johnson,

he solid line

 Very recently, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, measures of 
downstream participation have pointed to a slowdown in the rise of global 
value chains.
61 As the
 levelling
-off in the expansion of 
global value chains
 has been
 geographically widespread
, the
 causes
 of 
the 
slowdown are
 unlikely 
to be 
country or 
region
-specific.
 Possible explanations that have been put forward include 
reduc
tions 
in the length of 
firms™
 supply chains 
aimed at improving risk management (for 
example, in response to the 2011 earthquake in Japan), the adoption of l
ocal content 
requirements 
and other regulatory measures
, and changes in the composition of 
demand.

 75 Box 
1 Measuring global value chain participation on the basis of international input
-output tables
 This article 
use
s the WIOD
 to construct measures of economies™ global value chain participation
. 
In 
two editions, t
he WIOD provides global 
input
-output tables
 at annual frequency for 
a large number 
of countries and sectors
. The 
2013 edition covers the period 
1995-2011
 and the 
2016 edition the 
period 
2000-14. Unfortunately, the two editions of the WIOD are not consistent in terms of country 
and sector coverage. For example, while the 2013 edition covers 35 sectors in 40 countries, the 
2016 edition covers 56 sectors in 43 countries. Both editions also cover a block of countries 
constructed as the ﬁrest of the worldﬂ. For many purposes, therefore
, the data from the two WIOD 
editions cannot be combined in order to construct continuous measures of global value chain 
participation for the entire period 1995
-2014. This article uses changes in the backward global value 
chain participation measure for 2
011 to 2014 from the 2016 vintage in order to extrapolate the 
values of the measures constructed using the 2013 vintage beyond 2011.
 Various concepts and metrics have been proposed to measure trade in value added and global 
value chain participation 
on the
 basis of global input
-output tables.
63 In this article, a simple
 measure of 
global value chain participation
 is constructed on the basis of the WIOD data: the 
ﬁbackward participationﬂ measure reflects 
a country
™s downstream 
participation, and is
 defined as
 the ratio of 
an economy™s 
gross intermediate imports 
relative 
to 
its 
total 
gross output
. Another framework for the measurement of trade in value added has been developed and 
established by the 
Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (
OECD
).64 In this 
framework, the OECD has defin
ed backward participation as 
ﬁforeign
 value addedﬂ
.65 This indicator 
is constructed on the 
basis of the OECD
-World Trade Organization (WTO)
 Trade in Value Added 
database
, which covers 61 countries and 34 sectors for199
5, 2000, 2005, 2008 and 2011
. The 
correlation between 
the
 backward 
participation 
measure 
used in this article 
and the measure 
of foreign value added based on the OECD definition is 0.94. 
The correlation between the VAX ratio 
and the 
backward 
participation 
measure
 used in this article is 0.97.
  3 The impact of participation in global value chains on the 
current account
 Participating in global value chains may give an economy a temporary 
competitive edge that results 
Œ in order to smooth consumption over time
 Œ in 
a rise in its current account balance
. This could occur in a situation where 
domestic and imported intermediate
 goods are substitutes in production
 and the 

economy experiences a shock that reduces the 
cost
 of imported intermediate goods 
relative to t
hose produced domestically; such a shock could reflect
 the
 adoption of 
trade and capital fl
ow liberalising policies or
 advances in information and 
communication technologies, which have been identi
fie
d in the literature
 as 
the 
                                                                    63  See, for example, Hummels et al., op. cit.;

 The impact of global value chain participation on current a

Œ a global 
perspective
 76 driving
 forces 
behind
 the rise 
in global value chain p
articipation. By
 substituting less 
expensive imported intermediate goods for those produced domestically, domestic 
firms participate in global value chains and, at the same time, achieve a gain in 
competiveness relative to 
exporters in the rest of the world. As a result, the 
economy™s trade balance improves, driven by a rise in its exports.
66 As it is expected 
that foreign economies will 
Œ possibly with a delay 
Œ also adopt 
trade and capital flow
 liberalising policies 
and exp
loit
 advances in information and communication 
technologies
, the gain in competitiveness for domestic exporters is perceived to be 
only temporary. As a consequence, in order to smooth consumption over time, part 

of the income gain in the domestic economy w
ill be saved, which improves the 
current account balance.
67 A key element in this hypothesised mechanism is that 
participating in global value chains (by substituting imported for domestically 

produced intermediate goods) raises the efficiency of production
 in the domestic 

economy. Box 2 discusses the empirical evidence on the effect of global value chain 
participation on productivity. Moreover, it is crucial that the gain in competitiveness 
achieved through the substitution of imported intermediate goods fo
r domestic goods 
is only temporary. If the competitive edge is permanent, or perceived to be so, the 
current account balance is likely to deteriorate as consumption, and thus imports, 
rise commensurately to permanent income.
 Box 
2 Empirical evidence on the
 effect of participation in global value chains on productivity
 Participation in global value chains affects firm
-level productivity
, mainly 
by allow
ing
 firms to benefit 
from specialisation gains.
68 Studies that explore this link using industry
-level data t
end to conclude 
that off
-shoring affects productivity positively. For example, Amiti and Wei
69 estimate the effects of 
off
-shoring on productivity in US manufacturing industries, concluding that services off
-shoring has 
a positive effect on productivity; of
f-shoring of material inputs also has a positive effect on 
productivity, but the magnitude is smaller. Winkler
70 obtains similar results 
for Germany using 
input
-output data for 1995
-2006. 
Crinò
71 uses comparable data for nine European countries and 
finds tha
t services off
-shoring exerts a positive and economically large effect on domestic 
productivity. Egger and Egger
72 analyse how off
-shoring affects the productivity of low
-skilled 
workers employed in the EU manufacturing sector. They find a negative effect o
n productivity in the 
                                                                    66  In principle the rise in imports of intermediates could also lead to a deterioration of the economy™s trade 
balance. However, in a standard structural open economy model in general equilibrium the rise in 
exports
 dominates the rise in imported intermediates: see Brumm, J.,

73 combines industry
-level

-level data for nine European countries between 1995 
and 2008
. The study
 finds that off

ing of services and of non
-core manufacturing activities 
contributed to an increase in productivity
; however,
 no significant effect is found for o

. Schw
örer also finds evidence for additional productivity gains fo
r multinational firms.
 Other studies have used firm

örg and Hanley
74 examine the effect of international 
outsourcing on productivity at the plant
 level in the electronics industry in Ireland. 
They
 find that 
total international outsourcing incre
ases plant

plants with low export intensities. When distinguishing between off
-shoring of services and 
materials, 
their study finds
 that the positive impact on productivity is limited to materials 
outsourcing. G
örg et al.
75 investigate the impact of international outsourcing on productivity with 
plant
-level data for Irish manufacturing, finding that being more embedded in international
 markets 
leads to larger productivity gains from outsourcing. McCann
76 also finds that an increase in 
outsourcing intensity leads to productivity gains for foreign
-owned firms and for indigenous 
exporters in Ireland. In contrast, being an outsourcer matters
 strongly for Irish firms that are not 
exporting, while for exporters and foreign affiliates productivity increases are much lower. Using a 
dataset of Japanese firms, Ito et al.
77 find productivity gains for firms 
that outsource
 both 
manufacturing and servi
ces tasks, but not for firms 
that outsource 
only 
one or the other
. Hijzen et 
al.
78 also use firm
-level data for the Japanese manufacturing industries
, and find that intra
-firm 
off
-shoring has generally a positive effect on productivity of the off
-shoring fi
rm, while arm
™s length 
off
-shoring does not. Kasahara and Rodrigue
79 find evidence 
of a positive impact of imported 
intermediates 
on productivity 
in Chilean manufacturing plants. Morrison Paul and Yasar
80 find that 
higher shares of imported materials and sub
contracted inputs are associated with higher 
productivity for Turkish textile and apparel manufacturing plants. The results of Fari
ñas and 
Mart
ín-Marcos
81 suggest that foreign outsourcing has a positive impact on total factor productivity 
growth at the firm
 level in a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms. Jabbour
82 finds positive effects 
of off
-shoring on productivity and profitability for French manufacturing firms, but only in the case of

  4 Empirical evidence on the effect of global value chain 
participation on current account balances
 Global value chain participation and current 
account balances are positively correlated.
 Consistent with the mechanism discussed in the 
previous section
, the unconditional cross
-country 
correlation between current account balances and 
economies™ backward participation relative to the rest of 
the world is positive, albeit not statistically significantly 
different from zero (see Chart 7). Moreover, for sele
cted 

economies with large and persistent current account 
imbalances, there is a noticeable co
-movement 
between backward participation relative to the rest of 
the world and the current account balance over time 
(see Chart
 8).
84 For example, for the United St
ates, the 
rise and fall in the current account deficit over the past 
two decades has been accompanied by a similar 
decline and subsequent increase in the country™s 
backward participation relative to the rest of the world. 
Likewise, for Germany and China th
ere is a markedly 
positive correlation between their backward 
participation relative to the rest of the world and their 
current account balances.
                                                                     83  See Wa

relative to the rest of the world. A

Œ a global 
perspective
 80 Box 
3 The 
External Balance Assessment 
model
 In order to identify the determinants of current account balances,
 one strand of the literature has
 used
 structural models inspired by the 
new 
open economy 
macroeconomics paradigm.
86 Under this 
inter
-temporal approach, curr
ent account imbalances are the outcome of decisions taken by 
forward
-looking agents who maximise utility given expectations of future productivity, fiscal policy 
and financial market conditions. While these models allow a structural analysis of current acc
ount 
dynamics, their empirical fit tends to be relatively poor. 
Another strand of the literature has 
examined
 the 
determinants
 of the current account 
in empirical 
frameworks 
that 
are
 not tied to a 
particular structural model.
87 In this spirit, 
reduced
-form
 panel regressions for the determination of 
the current account 
have been explored
. 
The IMF™s External Balance Assessment (EBA) model is a 
version of such a
 reduced
-form
 panel regression model.
88 The backbone of 
the 
EBA consists of the 
panel data regression
      =   +       +    , where 
ca denotes the current account balance relative to GDP for country 
i in period 
t, and x is a set of 
economic fundamentals
 that 
are believed to 
determine the current account. Importantly, most 
of the explanatory 
variables
 in x are measured relative to rest
-of-the
-world averages; this is done 
because a change in, for example, the fiscal balance in country 
i can affect its current account 
balance only to the extent that other countries™ fiscal balances d
o not change
 commensurately. The 
explanatory variables in the 
EBA include the net foreign asset position, the oil balance,
 output per 
worker, population growth
, 
the old
-age dependency ratio, 
capital account openness, expected 
output growth, the terms of trade, the out
put gap and the fiscal balance.
 The residuals from the EBA 
regression are commonly interpreted as those parts of the observed current account balances that 
cannot be explained by economic fundamentals.
  The results from EBA regression models suggest that h
igher global value 
chain participation relative to the rest of the world improves economies™ 
current account balances, even after controlling for other economic 
fundamentals.

 The evidence suggests that the effect of global value chain participation on the 
current account operates through the trade balance.
 The 
mechanism laid out in 
Section 3
 suggests t
hat 
participation
 in 
glo
bal value chains aff
ects 
an economy™s
 current
 account
 balance
 by boosting its exports and thereby its 
trade balance. 
The 
empirical evidence reported in the second column of 
Table 
2 provides support to this 
hypothesis, suggesting tha
t participation in global value chains indeed improves 
economies™ trade balances.
 Cross
-country differences in global value chain participation account for a 
significant fraction of the unexplained component of observed current account 
balances.
 Despite 
some success in terms of empirical
 fit, a general 
finding
 in th
e literature
 on reduced
-form empirical models 
is that the unexplained part of 
the 
observed 
current account balances remains large.

. The

 EBA model

participation in global value chains 
are plot
ted as additional
 bars. Chart 9 suggests
 that 
there are large unexplained current account balances for 
surplus 
and deficit 
economies 
in the standard EBA model
 without global value chain participation 
measures
. 
The unexplained current account balances are
 considerably
 smaller
 when 
economies™ participation in global value chains is accounted for
. For example, for 
the 
United States
 about 
half 
of the unexplained part of the 
observed 
current account 
deficit 
of 
2.6
% of GDP in 2009 
can be accounted for 
by 
the coun
try™s limited 
participation in global value chains
 relative to the rest of the world.
                                                                     89  Analogously to the IMF™s original EBA model, the results are obtained from general
ised least squares 
estimation using data for 29 economies over the period 1995
-2011. The regression results reported are 
robust to heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the error term.
 90  The results also imply that an economy™s current account balance
 improves if its global value chain 
participation falls by less than that of the rest of the world.
 91  There is also some evidence that, in addition to backward participation, increased forward participation 
can improve the current account balances of econ
omies, even though the effects are quantitatively 
weaker and operate through other mechanisms (see 
Brumm
 et al., op. cit.).

 5 Conclusion
 The 
empirical 
evidence
 suggests that
 apart from fostering
 growth, magnifying cross
-country spillovers and changing an economy
™s income distribution
, 
global value 
chain participation improve
s current account balances
. Against the background of the recent stalling in the 
rise in global value chain 
participation, it is natural to ask whether this will have implications for global current 
account balances. However, it must be borne in mind that an economy™s global value 

chain participation only affects its current account ba
lance if the former changes 
relative to that in the rest of the world. As highlighted in the recent literature, the 
observed slowdown in the fragmentation of production across borders has been a 
global phenomenon and is unlikely to impact global current ac
count configurations.

 Firm heterogeneity and competitiveness in the European Union
 83 2 Firm heterogeneity 
and
 competitiveness
 in the European 
Union
 Firms are very heterogeneous in terms of economic performance within even 
narrowly defined sectors, as is confirmed by the evidence provided in this article for 

several EU
 countries. This has major implications for a country™s competitiveness, 
understood as its ability to export or, more broadly, as its aggregate productivity 

growth. The article discusses those implications and the ensuing policy 

recommendations to enhance 
competitiveness in the EU. Regarding trade 
performance, only a relatively small number of
 firms
 Œ the largest and the most 
productive in a given sector 
Œ are able to 
export
. This implies that the 
aggregate 
export 
performance 
of each country crucially 
depends on the dynamics of 
these 
firms
. In turn, trade participation affects the productivity of exporting and, indirectly, 
non-exporting firms, thereby positively affecting developments in aggregate 
productivity. Furthermore, extensive firm heterogeneity means
 that 
aggregate 
productivity 
growth 
can be fostered 
significantly 
by a
 better
 allocation of 
capital and 
labour
 across firms
, with evidence suggesting that significant productivity gains can 
stem from enhanced allocative efficiency within sectors
. However, 
some indicators of 
capital misallocation
 have 
been trending upwards 
in several EU countries in recent 
years, on account of both uncertainty and frictions in the production factor and credit 
markets.
 1 Introduction
 Owing to the increased 
availability
 of 
firm
-level data
, various empirical studies
 have documented
 the e
xistence of a marked heterogeneity in performance 
across firms.
 Empirical literature based on granular data shows
 that firms are very 
different in terms 
of e.g.
 size, cost structure, profits a
nd productivity, even within 
finely disaggregated sectors.
92 This also holds true for 
EU countries
, as is confirmed 
by a database recently produced by t
he Competitiveness Research Network 
(CompNet)
.93 In
 the

ECB/ESCB, the European Commission and 
a number
 of European and internation
al organisations, universities, statistical institutes and think tanks. 
The CompNet
 dataset is based mainly on administrative data from firm registries and provides 
harmonised cross

 Firm heterogeneity and competitiveness in the European Union
 84 productive firms are
, on average
, nearly three times more productive than firms 
located at the bottom 10
% of the productivity distribution 
within
 each sector
 (see 
Chart 1)
.94 This figure is even higher for most
 of the ten
 ﬁnewﬂ EU Member States
 for 
which data are available.
95 Moreover, the productivity 
distribution
 is asymmetric as it 
displays a large density of low
-productive firms and few highly productive firms. 
Alt
hough this empirical regularity applies to all countries and sectors, the shape of 
the distribution can differ across countries, reflecting their structural characteristics. 

For example, the 
productivity distribution
s of the manufacturing sector in France 
and Germany
 are characterised by a 
higher mean
 and fatter 
right 
tail
 than
 those in 
countries such as
 Spain
 and Italy
 (see 
Chart 2).
 Firm heterogeneity has implications for the overarching assessment of 

competitiveness, which covers both trade outcomes and 
productivity 
developments.
 In a broad sense,
 competitiveness 
relates to 
the 
business 
environment and institutional framework
 that allow efficient firms to thrive
,96 thus 
supporting trade performance and
 productivity
. The existence of a significant degree 
of heterogeneity across firms has important implications for the assessment of 
competitiveness along both such dimensions.
 Regarding trade performance, both the empirical and the 
theoretical literature 
highlight a two
-way link between firm
-level trade and pr
oductivity.
 In line with 
empirical evidence based on granular data, the most recent theoretical international 

trade literature predicts that exporters are the most productive firms in an economy.
97 Moreover, in addition to the traditional gains from trade, 
both models and empirical 
analyses show that trade liberalisation can, in turn, boost aggregate productivity by 
reallocating resources to exporting, more productive firms.
 Firm heterogeneity also has implications for aggregate productivity growth.
 In the p
resence of heterogen
eous
 firm performance, aggregate productivity 
developments also depend on the 
efficiency with
 which production factors are 
                                                                    94  In most cases, the 
cross
-country
 evidence on trade outcomes provided in this article covers 16 EU 
countries:
 ten euro area countries (
Belgium,
 Estonia, France, 
Italy, 
Latvia, Lithuania, 
Portugal,
 Slovenia
, Slovakia and Finland
) and six other EU Member States
 (the Czech Republic,
 Denmark,
 Croatia,
 Hungary
, Poland 
and 
Romania
). The charts containing only productivity indicators also include 
German
y, Spain
 and Austria. The use of (slightly) different country samples is flagged in the note to the 
related chart. Information for 2013 is only available for 12 countries, since it is not available for 
Lithuania, Hungary, 
Romania and 
Slovenia
. This article considers 54 two
-digit sectors in the non
-financial business economy, 23 of which are in manufacturing, according to the NACE rev. 2 system. 
Moreover, throughout the article, only CompNet data referring to firms with more than 20 employees 
are considered. This sample is population
-weighted, which enhances cross
-country comparability. 
However, some comparability issues, related to, for example, sampling procedures, remain. For 
detailed information on the dataset, see Lopez
-Garcia et al., op. c
it., and Berthou et al., op. cit.
 95  Bartelsman
 et al. explain the differences in within
-sector dispersion in productivity between central and 
eastern European countries and western Europe with the fact that during the initial years of the 
transition, low
-productivity firms were able to survive in the market and coexist with new, far more 
productive firms created in the private sector (see

In the end, a
 competitive economy is 
one in which institutions and policies allow productive firms to thrive
.ﬂ 97  It should not be overlooked that this literature originates from the contribution of economists such as 
Joseph Schumpeter, who

heterogeneous economic agents in his work (see, for example,

 Firm heterogeneity and competitiveness in the European Union
 85 allocated across firms as a result of two fundamental developments: (i) the 
birth and 
death
 of firms
, and (ii) th
eir expansion and contraction. Factor reallocation is 
productivity
-enhancing when, as a result of such developments, resources 
shift 
from 
the least to the most productive firms.
 However, constraints such as credit frictions or 
structural rigidities may imp
air the efficient allocative process.
 The aim of this article is to take stock of the implications of firm heterogeneity 
for competitiveness in the EU.
 The structure of the article is as follows. Section 2 
examines the link between firm productivity and tr
ade from an empirical standpoint. 
Within that section, Box 1 discusses the workhorse theoretical trade models 
underpinning the empirical analysis, whereas Box 2 assesses the role of firm 
heterogeneity in explaining the reactivity of aggregate exports to ch
anges in real 
exchange rates, within and across countries. Section 3 focuses on the efficiency with 
which capital and labour are allocated across firms within a given sector, which is an 
important determinant of productivity growth. Section 4 concludes wit
h some policy 
implications.

 87 the hypothesis that new exporters 
display a productivity and size advantage in 
comparison with non
-exporters before they even start competing in international 
markets
.99 A key reason why
 export
ing 
firms 
need to be more productive is that only in 
this way can they afford
 to pay 
the 
related 
trade costs
, so that 
expan
sion
 into 
foreign markets
 is profitable
.100 Engaging in trading activities is costly. Examples 
of barriers to trade are infrastructure and 
logistic costs, tariffs and non
-tariff barriers, 
hedging costs to the nominal exchange rate, t
he cost of credit, 
and the cost of 
obtaining 
information 
on foreign markets.
101 As discussed in Box 1, both the 
theoretical and the empirical literature suggest that there is a productivity threshold 
above which firms find it profitable to pay these costs an
d expand in foreign markets. 

A proxy for this unobservable threshold is the estimated labour productivity 
advantage of new exporters versus non
-exporters operating in the same sector 
Œ the 
ﬁexporter productivity premiumﬂ.
102 In line with the literature, evid
ence on EU countries suggests that the lower the 
level of economic development of a country, the higher tends to be the 

exporter productivity premium
. Countries
 with low GDP per capita usually have 
less integrated markets; this
 allows
 non-exporters with lo
w levels of productivity to 
survive
, thus explaining the coexistence in the same sector of very productive firms
 that are 
able to afford the costs associated
 with exporting
 and low
-productivity 
domestically oriented firms.
103 As a result, the exporter productivity premium is larger 
in economies such as Romania than in, for example, Finland and Denmark (see 
Chart 5).
 GDP per capita is also a proxy of institutional quality. 
Better 
institutions 
decrease both 
the 
fixed and 
the 
var
iable costs of trade faced by firms.
104 The exporter 
productivity 
premium 
in Chart 5 
is indeed 
found to be 
low in countries where 
institutional 
quality is
 known to be
 high
.                                                                     99  Engagement in trading activities might in turn foster firms™ own productivity growth (on this issue, see 
Section
 2.2 below).

 Box 
1 Reconciling empirical evidence with theory: introducing heterogeneous firms in trade 
theory
 Until the 1990s 
most studies 
assumed that firms 
were homogeneous
 when assessing 
competitiveness, understood as trade p
erformance
. In neoclassical trade models, welfare gains 
from trade arise from the increase in world production and consumption following the speciali
sation 
of countries in industries where they have a comparative advantage. Specifically, countries export 
those products for which they have lower opportunity costs of production relative to other industries 

and to other countries. Later
 ﬁnew
-tradeﬂ
 models incorporated the empirical feature that countries 
exchange similar goods, implying that trade across coun
tries also occurs within the same industry, 

by assuming increasing returns to scale, monopolistic competition and consumers™ 
preference for a 
variety 
of products. In these models, the gains from trade arise because trade liberalisation leads to 
an increase
 in market size, which allows firms to reduce production costs and widens the availability 
of cheaper varieties of goods.
105 In all these models
, firms are assumed to be homogeneous.
 The so
-called ﬁnew
 new
-tradeﬂ theory acknowledges the presence of firm hete
rogeneity
, as unveiled by empirical studies, 
and provides for a tractable framework to analyse 
competitiveness through the link between trade and productivity
. In a seminal article of 2003, 
Marc Melitz introduced firm heterogeneity in productivity into the
 standard new
-trade theory 
                                                                    105  The reference point for this literature is Krugman, P.R.,

 89 models.
106 Building on earlier theoretical models of firm size and dynamics,
107 the 
Melitz
 model 
offers a tractable framework and 
has become the
 new cornerstone 
of trade theory
. 
In this model, 
firms need to pay a fixed cost 
to be abl
e to produce domestically.
 Participation in export activities 
also requires the payment of an additional fixed cost, as well as 
of 
a variable cost. This implies that 
firms will enter the market and produce, and eventually export, only if they find it profi
table (
i.e.
 if 
their revenues are larger than these fixed and variable costs). Since profitability depends on the 
productivity level of 
each
 firm, only a fraction of 
the total number of 
firms
 (i.e. those above a certain 
ﬁproductivity thresholdﬂ)
 will be ab
le to 
produce for 
the domestic market, and only a fraction of these 
firms will in turn be able to export.
108 At the same time, while t
rade liberali
sation leads to an 
increase in potential export market sales
, it also heightens domestic competition. 
Consequen
tly
, the 
most productive firms 
Œ those
 that are able to pay the cost o
f export
ing 
Œ engage in export activities 
and expand to take advantage of the larger foreign market
, whereas 
the least efficient producers 
tend to 
exit
 the market
 as increased competition c
auses
 their revenues
 to contract
. Resources are
, therefore
, reallocated towards the most productive producers
, which 
lead
s to an increase in 
aggregate productivity.

s how exporter competitiveness (measured as the 
residual of an export regression, once all possible characteristics

The countries considered are those in Chart 6. 
The correlation between these
 two 
series is 
-0.83. These findings also imply that
 the international performance of a given 
country will depend on its productivity distribution, as depicted in Chart 2, 
and, in particular, on the behaviour of relatively few exporting firms
. In the 15 
EU countries considered in 
Chart 
6, t
he top exporters 
(top
 ten
 firms in terms of 
exporting value) account for 
about 50% to 
80% of aggregate exports
, with the 
exceptions of France and, more starkly, Italy, where the shares of top exporters are 
lower
. 
There is evidence of the concentration of exports being high
er the smaller the 
size of a country™s manufacturing sector (see Chart 7).
109 The generally large 
concentration of exports in most countries implies that aggregate trade performance 
is driven by very few firms. Export concentration
 also varies significantly 
across 
manufacturing sectors
, the highest being recorded in sectors such as transport 
equipment and pharmaceuticals and the lowest in, for example, the machinery and 

equipment and fabricated metals sectors 
(see Chart 
8). Sector differences in export 
concen
tration can be partially related to sector
-specific technological characteristics 
of production processes, which require different firm sizes across sectors. Chart 9 

shows a positive correlation between the cross
-country average export concentration 
and th
e median size of firms in each sector, which is a proxy of the required scale of 

operations in the sector.
                                                                     109  Moreover, according to CompNet data, the median size of exporting firms in a given sector in Italy is 
about 60% the size of the median exporting firms in the same sector in all other countr
ies considered in 
Chart 6. The small size of exporters in Italy can contribute to explaining its low concentration of exports.

to

 92 Box 
2 The productivity distribution of firms
, real exchange rate movements and aggregate 
exports
 This box discusses how the 
distribution of 
productivity across firms
, which differs
 from 
country to country,
 can affect the external rebalancing process
es. Aggregate export dynamics 
depend, among other factors, on changes in a country™s price competitiveness, which is commonly 
measured by the real effective exchange rate (REER). While, 
all 
other things 
being 
equal, a 
depreciation of the 
REER generally leads to higher export growth, it is critical to 
recall 
that 
this
 impact takes place via two different channels, namely (i) the ﬁintensive marginﬂ (the changes in 

foreign sales of 
existing
 exporting firms) and (ii) the ﬁextensive marginﬂ (the entry of 
new exporting 
firms). Recent empirical literature has shown that the 
magnitude
 of such effects across countries 
depends 
Œ via 
each of the two channels 
Œ on two factors reviewed in this article: 
first, the extent to 
which exports are concentrated in few firms (as illustrated in Chart 
6) and second, 
the shape of the 
productivity distribution prevailing in a given country
™s manufacturing sector
 (as illustrated in 
Chart
 2). With respect to the 
intensive margin (i.e. the export intensity of existing exporters), large and 
more productive exporting firms tend to be less sensitive to real exchange rate 
developments, possibly because of higher market power, product diversification and import 
intensit
y. According to evidence based on 11 EU countries, 
the 
large
st and mo
st productive 
exporters are found to exhibit up to three times lower elasticities to REER movements than the 
smaller, less productive exporting firms.
111 Hence, 
all other factors being equa
l, 
the overall reactivity 
of exports to REER fluctuations 
will be
 the 
lower
, the larger the concentration of exports in few, 
highly productive firms. 
A first
 possible explanation of the different reactivity of firms to exchange 
rate shocks is that firms ha
ve heterogeneous 
pricing
-to
-market strategies
: for the large
st, mo
st productive 
exporters, 
it is easier to absorb exchange rate changes by varying their mark
-up, which 
leads to a weaker reaction of their export volumes.
112 More 
import
-intensive exporters
 are
 usually 
the largest and most productive firms even among exporters
; they thus need to 
adjust their export 
prices
 less
 to changes in 
REERs because their mark
-ups are larger and because 
the
re are
 offsetting exchange rate effects on their marginal costs.
113 Finally, large
 multi
-product firms
 are less 
sensitive to REER movements because, in response to negative exchange rate shocks, they 
can 
afford to 
pull out their least profitable products from the export markets.
114                                                                     111  This result is based on the estimation of export elasticities to unit labour cost
-deflated real effective 
exchange rates by firm
-level productivity quartile on CompNet data for 11 EU countries in the period
 from 2001 to 2008 (Berthou, A., Demian, V. and Dhyne, E., ﬁExchange rate movements, firm

 93 Turning
 to the extensive margin, i.e. the ext
ent to which more firms become exporters, this 
will also depend on the shape of the productivity distribution prevailing in the country 
in 
question
. A depreciation of the 
REER in a given country will trigger higher demand for its tradable 
goods, thus leadi
ng to a decrease in the ﬁproductivity thresholdﬂ of exporting firms, i.e. the threshold 
above which it becomes feasible for firms to enter export markets. The country™s aggregate exports 
will, therefore, increase as a result of additional sales 
by existing
 exporting firms, as well as 
on account of 
new firms becoming exporters. Against this background, the larger the pool of very 
productive firms in a given country, the higher the probability that new firms will be able to enter 

foreign markets when price co
mpetitiveness improves. 
All other things being equal, 
countries such 
as Germany
 and France
, 
which are 
characterised by a higher average productivity and a fatter right 
tail in the productivity distribution (i.e. a 
larger
 reservoir of relatively high
ly prod
uctive firms) than 
countries such as Italy and Spain (see Chart 2), may 
record a more marked impact of a given 
exchange rate
 change on their exports via the extensive margin.
115 Ultimately, the overall sensitivity of aggregate exports to real exchange rate changes will 
depend on the relative importance of the intensive versus the extensive margin. 
The existing 
empirical literature is inconclusive with respect to the relative impor
tance of the two channels 
through which changes in the REER can affect aggregate exports, since this
 varies across sectors
, 
the time
-span
 considered and the granularity of the data
 employed.
116 However, the intensive 
margin is generally found to matter more 
than the extensive margin in advanced economies.
117 This 
would imply that, all other things being equal, the smaller share of large exporting firms in, for 

example, Italy relative to France and Germany would play an important role in explaining the higher 
reactivity of aggregate exports to REER changes in Italy, as documented in 
the 
macroeconomic
 literature.

 The effects of trade on productivity
 Trade
, in turn
, can 
enhance
 aggregate productivity through two channels: first, 
through
 firms™ own productivit
y growth and
, second,
 through a better 
allocation of 
capital and labour 
across firms.
 Exposure to international trade can
, indeed, induce
 exporting firms 
to increase
 their own productivity (
ﬁwithin
-firm 
productivity growth
ﬂ). It can also 
result in
 a differ
ent allocation of production factors 
across exporting and non
-exporting firms
, both
 within a given sector and across 
sectors (
ﬁreallocation effect
ﬂ), with a potentially large impact on aggregate 
productivity

 Firm heterogeneity and competitiveness in the European Union
 94 Starting with the first channel, t
rade can alter 
within
-firm productivity for the following main
 reasons: (i)
 exporters 
ﬁlearn by exportingﬂ
, and (ii)
 exporters benefit from 
import
s of cheaper 
and/
or 
higher
-quality intermediate goods.
 Regarding the 
first reason
, empirical evidence documents that 
exporters are more likely to innovate, shift resources 

toward the most
 profitable product
s and broaden the 
scope of 
firm product
s.119 As a result,
 the productivity 
gap relative to non
-exporting firms
 tends to increase 
after entry into export markets. Indeed,
 on average in 
the sample of EU countries used here, 
the productivity 
growth of exporters 
a year
 after their entering foreign 
markets
 is higher than that of non
-exporting firms
 (see 
Chart 10)
.120 Hence, not only are the most productive 
firms those that enter into export markets, as discussed 

in Section 2.1, but export activity
 boosts their 
productivity further 
after entry
. Turning to the second 
reason
, importing intermediate goods is empirically 

found to foster within
-firm productivity.
121 This is 
because 
importers
 have access to a 
broa
der range of 
more sophisticated 
inputs
.122 In
 particular
, participation 
in global value chains (GVCs) acts as a mechanism of technology diffusion. Recent 
evidence based on CompNet data reveals
, for example
, that the 
productivity growth
 of the better
-performing 
firms (so
-called ﬁnational frontier firm
sﬂ)
 in 11
 EU 
countries 
in 
central and 
eastern Europe
 closely mimic
s the productivity
 growth 
of national 
frontier 
firms 
in EU countries
 outside central and eastern Europe that supply
 inputs to 
the 
former (the so
-called ﬁGVC frontierﬂ)
. 
Interestingly, the co
rrelation between these two 
series is higher than that between productivity developments of national frontier firms 
                                                                    119  For theoretical and empirical evidence s

. 120  Note also
 that 
persistent exporters
 increase their productivity to a larger extent than non
-exporting firms 
in the same sector
. 121  Based on a panel of Indonesian firms, 
Amiti and Konings 
show that a 10 percentage point fall in input 
tariffs leads to a productivity gain of 12
% for firms that import their inputs
 (see Amiti, M. and Konings,

ﬂ, The 
American Economic Review

 97, No

Similarly,
 focusing on 
trade 
liberalisation in India,
 Topolova and Khandelwal 
show that access to better inputs, due to lower input 
tariffs
, contributed to increas
ing
 firm
-level productivity
 (see Topolova, P. and Khandelwal, A., ﬁ

).
 122  For example, based on a panel of French firms,
 Bas and Strauss
-Kahn
 find that the average firm adds 
four 
types 
of imported 
inputs over the period
, leading to
 an increase of 2.5% in
 total factor productivity 
(TFP)
. Similarly
, the
y find that controlling for TFP, a 10
% increase in the number of imported input 
varieties raises export 
product 
scope
 by 10.5
% (see Bas, M. and Strauss

 Turning to the second channel through which t
rade can 
enhance
 aggregate 
productivity growth, exporting 
can also foster a better allocation of resources.
 When trade costs fall, the most productive, exporting firms 
are likely to
 expand to 
the 
detriment of the least productive firms
, thereby improving the allocation of resources 
across firms (see Box 1 for the theoretical framework). 
The empirical literature has
 also
 found 
robust 
evidence 
that a shift of resources towards producers that are 
exposed 
to international trade 
can boost aggregate productivity
. 
For example, b
ased 
on US census data for 1983
-92, around 40
% of aggregate

.125 3 Allocative efficiency and aggregate productivity growth
 In addition to trade boosting productivity via the two channels reviewed in the 
previous section, f
irm heterogeneity 
has other, more direct implications for 
competitiveness, understood as
 aggregate productivity growth.
 In the presence 
of firm heterogeneity, aggregate productivity growth will depend significantly on the 
degree of allocative efficiency.
126 All other things being equal, aggregate productivity gains from resource 
reallocation wi
ll be the larger, the more dispersed is the distribution of 
productivity across firms.
 Chart 12 shows that the within
-sector dispersion 
between the most and the least productive firms, measured by the ratio of 

productivity of the top 10% of firms relative 
to that of the bottom 10% of firms, is 
substantially larger than 
the difference
 in average productivity
 between 
firms in the 
non-tradable and tradable sectors
. This fact holds for all countries and time periods.
 The allocation of resources across firms wit
hin a sector is often not efficient; 
the most widely
 used, albeit imperfect,
 measure of 
resource
 mis
allocation is 
the dispersion in the marginal 
revenue 
productivity of capital and labour 
Œ MRPK(L)
 Œ across
 firms.
127 The idea behind th
is indicator is that in
 a given sector, if 
firms face the same marginal costs, labour and capital should flow across firms until 
the marginal return of hiring an extra unit of input is equalised across firms. However, 

the presence of different constraints 
that 
affect input alloc
ation (e.g. differ
ing
 access 
to financial resources, different degrees of exposure to regulation, etc.) could prevent 

such reallocation of resources and, therefore, 
induce
 firms to employ sub
-optimal 
amounts of inputs compared to their productivity level. 
The result would be that 
marginal revenue productivities of inputs are not equalised across firms within a 
                                                                    125  Berthou, A., Hyun Chung, J., Manova, K. and Sandoz, C., ﬁProductivity, Misallocation and Tradeﬂ, paper 
presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association, January 2017. The importance 
of the reallocation effect in boosting agg
regate productivity via trade is not only limited to advanced 
economies. For example, in the aftermath of trade liberalisations in Chile, roughly two
-thirds of the 
observed rise in aggregate productivity was found to be the result of reallocation from the 
least to the 
most efficient producers (see Pavcnik, N., ﬁTrade liberalisation, exit and productivity improvement:

. 127  In the presence of output distortions, Hsieh and Klenow show that: 
=
, i.e. firm 
i ™s 
marginal revenue product of labour is not equal to the average wage of the sector 
s in which it operates 
(and therefore not equal to that of all other firms in the sector), but rather it is larger than the average 
wage. In particular, it is the higher, the higher the firm™s output distortion. Similarly, 
=

, i.e. the marginal revenue product of capital is equal to the average sector interest rate, adjusted by 
both the firm™s capital
 and output distortions. This implies that MRPK is also not equalised across firms 
in the sector. A standard measure of within
-sector dispersion of MRPK(L) across firms is the standard 

deviation of MRPK(L), which is indeed the measure of capital (labour) m
isallocation suggested by

 Different empirical studies 
using this indicator 
have found that capital

developments in labour misalloca
tion have been flatter.
 Recent

Belgium, Spain, 
France and Italy 
(see 
Chart 1
3).128 Country
-specific studies on Spain, Italy and Portugal 
that are based on
 different data 
sources
 also 
point to similar results.
129 The rise in capital misallocation has been 
particularly apparent in services
. This could be related to the fact that the tertiary 
sector is more regulated and less exposed to international competition than, for 
example, manufacturing, as well as 
to the fact that it is 
more dependent on external 
finance
, which increases 
its
 exposure to c
redit constraints.

declined
 until 2012 (the last year for which German data are available, which is why this country has

 differences in 
the

 of 
capital and labour
 are
 associated with

 prevent firms from adjusting their workforce to optimal levels,

 Firm heterogeneity and competitiveness in the European Union
 99 In this chart,
 country
-sectors are split into two groups each year, depending on 
whether their exposure to regulation is above or below the median regulation 
indicator across all countries and sectors considered 
Œ the ﬁtighter regulationﬂ and 
the
 ﬁlooser regulationﬂ grou
p respectively. The indicator of factor misallocation is then 
computed for both sub
-groups of country
-sectors. The chart shows that capital 
misallocation in the post
-crisis period dropped in the country
-sectors with more 
flexible product market regulation 
(such as manufacturing, construction and 
distribution), as a result of the exit of less productive firms and an expansion of more 
productive ones. In country
-sectors with stricter regulation, by contrast, the crisis did 
not have a similar cleansing effect.
 Capital misallocation dynamics are 
also 
found to be correlated with demand
 uncertainty and credit market frictions.
 In
 addition to product market regulation
, 
demand uncertainty
134 is found to be
 strongly correlated with the observed changes 
in capital misal
location
, as illustrated in Chart 16 by using the same methodology 
and referring to the same euro area countries as in the previous chart
. While it is 
well
-known that demand uncertainty reduces 
investment, recent empirical evidence 
documents that it may al
so affect capital allocation across firms, and thus aggregate 
productivity dynamics. H
eightened uncertainty 
is indeed conducive
 to all firms 
adopting a ﬁwait
-and-see strategyﬂ
, which 
means
 that 
high
-productivity firms do not 
expand and low
-productivity fir
ms do not downsize, thereby stalling efficiency
-enhancing reallocation
 and leading to higher resource misallocation.
135 Moreover, 
higher uncertainty 
tends to 
reduce the productivity growth of firms that are 
relatively 
mor
e dependent on external finance, gene
rally small firms,
 irrespective
 of their level 
of productivity, thereby p
ossibly leading to a more inefficient input allocation
.136 Credit market frictions
 are also associated with an in
crease in capital misallocation. 
Indeed, in country
-sectors with a cost 
of credit above the median (see Chart 17) and 
tighter credit supply standards (see Chart 18), capital misallocation increased 
significantly more over the whole period considered than in country
-sectors with a 
lower credit cost and looser credit standards.
 This supports the idea that the 
existence of frictions in the financial markets m
ay prevent productive firms from 
obtaining the resources needed to expand, so that input choices differ systematically 
across firms in ways that are unrelated to their product
ivity.
137                                                                     134  Here, demand uncertainty is measured as the 
dispersion in the expectations of firms interviewed in the 
European Commission
™s monthly 
business 
survey
s, when replying 
to 
questions such as (depending on 
the sector) 
ﬁexpectations of the demand over the next three monthsﬂ, ﬁorder expectations over the next 
three monthsﬂ and ﬁproduction expectations for the months aheadﬂ.

higher negative impact on the relatively 
smaller and younger firms within a given sector, which present 
low net worth, but may potentially be more productive. See also Buera, F., Fattal

 Firm heterogeneity and competitiveness in the European Union
 101 4 Policy implications
 A core implication of the firm heterogeneity addressed in this article is that 
aggregate competitiveness outcomes vary depending on the distribution of 
productivity across firms in each economy.
 As, typically, only the relatively more 
pro
ductive firms are capable of exporting, the sector
-specific density of high
-productivity firms in a given country affects its international performance. Trade, in 

turn, positively affects aggregate productivity growth in a virtuous cycle; conversely, 

trade
 restrictions would lower productivity growth as a result of weaker productivity 
growth of individual firms, and of a less efficient input allocation across firms. The 
dispersion in the distribution of productivity across firms also determines the 

aggregat
e productivity gains of a reallocation of capital and labour. In light of this 
evidence, a set of broad policy recommendations can be identified which would help 
countries enhance their competitiveness.
138 First, policy action aimed at lowering trade
 costs e
nhance
s the scope f
or export
-related
 activities
 and 
firms™ ability to switch between domestic and 
foreign markets
. This 
means
, among other
 things
, reducing
 tariffs and non
-tariff 
barriers
, wherever needed. In some countries, it may also be helpful to enhan
ce the 
activities of 
export
-promotion agencies which provide
 networks and information to 
potential exporters
 and to reduce logistic and trade
-related transport infrastructure 
costs
. Second, 
measures designed to support firm productivity make it easier for 
a larger set of firms to access international markets.
 Potential reforms include 
incentives for research and development, e
nhancing the link between (university) 
research and (firm) innovation
, as well as the liberalisation of closed professions and 
certai
n closed sectors, which can have positive downstream effects on 
manufacturing firms.
 Third, p
olicies aimed at 
removing distortions that prevent a productivity
-enhancing reallocation of 
capital and labour
 across firms 
can 
significantly 
increase
 aggregate productivity, and thus
 competitiveness.
 In order to boost 
aggregate productivity growth
 and fully reap the gains of 
international 
trade, 
structural reforms 
aimed at 
removing barriers to 
the flow of production inputs from 
the least to the most pr
oductive firms are warranted. 
Examples of allocative 
efficiency
-enhancing measures include:
 (i) in 
product markets
, 
lowering the entry barriers for firms 
and promoting
 the creation 
of 
innovative 
start
-ups, 
enhancing
 bankruptcy regulations that facilitate t
he exit of 
unproductive firms
, 
remov
ing 
obstacles that prevent firms from reaching their optimal 
size
 (e.g. by redesigning size
-contingent regulations that set disincentives above a 
given employee threshold) and making further progress 
in the establishment
 of 
a fully fledged
 EU 
internal market
 for services
;                                                                     138  The specification of the ensuing policy measures would
, in turn
, hinge on a detailed analysis of 
institutions, governance and framework conditions
, country by country, which falls outside the scope of 
this article.
