At its monetary policy meeting on 
8 
June
 2017, 
the Governing Council 
concluded that 
a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still 
needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline 
inflation in the medium term.


























The ECB™s monetary policy measures have continued to preserve the very 
favourable financing conditions that are necessary to secure a sustained 
convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the 
medium term.















The ongoing econom
ic expansion 
in the euro area is increasingly resilient and 
has broadened across sectors and countries.






















Euro area 
activity
 is further supported by a sustained global recovery.









The June
 2017 E
urosystem
 staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area
, 
finalised in late May,
 which are conditional on the full implementation of all 
ECB monetary policy measures, foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.
9% in 
2017, by 1.8% in 2018 and by 1.7% in 
2019.







According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area
 annual HICP inflation was 
1.4% in May
,















Measures of underlying inflatio
n have remained low
 and have yet to show 
convincing signs of a pick
-up, as unutilised resources are still weighing on 
domestic price and wage formation
.





The June
 2017 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual HICP inflation at 
1.5
% in 201
7, 1.
3% in 201
8 
and
 1.6% in 201
9.



The euro area budget deficit is projected to fall further over the
 projection 
horizon (2017
-19),












 




Based on 
the regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council
confirmed the need for a continued very substantial degree of monetary 
accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels 

that are below, but close to, 2%.











































A temporary dip in global GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017 notwithstanding, 
global activity growth remained sustained in the first months of the year. 
Momentum 
in global trade 
improved markedly, 
driven mostly by increased trade from emerging 
market economies
. 
Global headline inflation 
has stabilised 
in recent months,
 as the 
effect of past commodity price increases has diminished. However, oil prices have 

declined in recent weeks, which should 
dampen global 
inflation rates in
 the short 
term
. 
A temporary dip in global GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017 
notwithstanding, global activity growth remained sustained at the start of 
year.























Survey indicators suggest that 
global 
growth will rebound in the near term.

In the United States
, activity is ex
pected to strengthen.







In the United Kingdom,

in the near term
.












In Japan, accommodative policies are expected to conti
nue to support 
expansion.







In China

Central and eastern European countries are expected to benefit from strong 

consumption and 
investment
, the latter
 supported by EU structural funds
.

arge commodity exporters are expected to continue their recovery after 
deep recessions.




















Momentum in global trade improved markedly at the end of last year and

Overall, global growth is projected to increase gradually over

price increases begins to wane.

Commodity prices have fallen recently.

































Looking ahead, after a slight moderation in the near term, global inflation is 

expected to rise slowly.




































Since 
the Governing Council
™s monetary policy 
meeting in 
March, 
euro area 
sovereign 
bond yields have declined slightly, with some intra
-period volatility. 
Corporate bond spreads have declined marginally and remain below the levels
 observed 
in early March 2016, when the corporate sector purchase programme 
(CSPP) 
was announced
. 
Broad equity prices have risen by a larger extent in the 
euro area than in other major economic areas
. The value of the euro has 
apprec
iated in trade
-weighted terms.
 Long-term euro area government bond yields have 
decreased 
slightly overall 
since early 
March
.

Sovereign bond yields declined markedly in a number of countries, mainly on 
account of the declining political uncertainty since late April as well as an 

improving economic outlook.

The 
euro overnight index average (

forward curve 
has shifted 
downwards by slightly more than 10 basis points on average across maturities 
since early March (see Chart

Euro area equity prices have increased since early March (see Chart

The ongoing economic expansion is increasingly resilient and has broadened across 
sectors and countries. Euro area growth is supported primarily by domestic deman
d, 

although tailwinds from the external environment have increasingly lent support to 
the outlook. Short
-term indicators, such as surveys, confirm robust growth 
momentum in the near term. Compared with the March 2017 ECB staff 
macroeconomic 
projections, t
he June
 2017 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic 
projections
 have been revised upwards and foresee euro area real GDP growing by 
1.9
% in 2017
, 1.8
% in 2018 and 
1.7
% in 2019
. The euro area e

New procedure for constructing 
Eurosystem and ECB staff projection ranges























According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation in May 2017 
was 1.4%, down from 1.9% in April. Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures 

prices, headline inflation is likely to fluctuate around 
current 
levels in the coming 
months. 
Looking through recent volatility, underlying inflation has yet to show 

convincing signs of a pick
-up and is expected to rise only gradually over the medium 
term. 
The June 2017 
Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual HICP inflation at 
1.5
% 
in 2017, 
1.3
% in 2018 and

 HICP inflation excluding energy and food is expected to rise only gradually 
over the medium term
. HICP inflation excluding energy and food is
 projected to 
increase from 0.9% in 2016 to 1.1% in 2017 and to 1.4% and 1.7% in 2018 and 2019 
respectively. 
One of the
 main factor
s 
behind this gradual pick
-up is the envisaged 
increase in wages and unit labour costs as the recovery progresses and 

consolidates. Declining labour market slack and a gradual fading of crisis
-related 
factors
, which
 have dampened
 wage growth over the past few years
, are expected to 
lead to a rebound in growth in compensation per employee and, given a more 

modest projected
 recovery in productivity, in unit labour cost growth.
 The rebound in 
oil prices since early 2016 is also expected to add, indirectly, somewhat to these 
upward cost pressures via higher production costs and their repercussions on 
nominal wages

 area countries
 Rising private sector debt
-to-GDP ratios ha
ve been 
a 
pre
-crisis feature of many 
euro area countries.
 In the run
-up to the financial crisis, buoyant 
demand growth 
and the associated credit boom led to the build
-up of large volumes of domestic debt 
in several euro area countries
. 
Private sector 
debt 
(i.e. debt of 
household
s 
and non
-financial corporations)
17 in the euro
 area as a whole rose from
 110% of GDP in 1999 
to
 147% of GDP in 2009 (
see 
Chart A). F
or most euro area countries the increase 
from 1999 to 
the 
peak has been significantly higher than 
that 
observed for the euro 
area as a whole (
see 
Chart B)
. 
Only in German
y has the private sector debt
-to
-GDP 
ratio been on a downwards path since 1999.
 The private sector 
debt-to
-GDP ratio
, 
which can be considered a measure of medium
- 
to long
-term affordability of debt
, 
clearly 
showed
 an upwards
 trend 
prior 
to 2009. But such a
 trend 
is much less 
evident when looking at 
debt 
as a 
percentage
 of total assets
 (the leverage ratio
) Œ 
which
, during 
the pre
-crisis 
expansionary period
, did not signal 
a possible build
-up of 
over
-indebtedness. The leverage ratio is measured on the basis o
f 
market prices
 of 
assets
, and the evolution of 
these 
asset prices has partially hidden the 
vulnerability 
associated with the 
increase in indebtedness. This box
 reviews recent
 developments 
in private sector indebtedness
 and deleveraging

bt-to

 as a measure

 Private sector indebtedness and deleveraging in the euro area countries
 56 Since reaching its peak in 2009, private sector debt as a percentage of GDP 
has been on a slight downwards trend in the euro area as a whole.
 From 147% 
of GDP in 2009, private sector debt fell to 139% of GDP in 2016. This relatively 

modest decline hides significant differences across countries. In some highly 

indebted countries 
private sector debt
-to
-GDP ratios have been falling significantly 
since their peak. The reduction in the ratio has been very 
marked
 in Spain (54 
percentage 
points
 since the peak in 2009), amounting to
 half of the increase over the 
previous ten years; 
the reduction has
 also been 
significant in 
Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal
 and Slovenia (
see

 Even after the post

have 
remained
 very heterogeneous across countries
 in the euro area
. Chart C shows 
that private sector debt ratios at the end of 2016 rang
ed from about 50% of GDP to 

350% of GDP. In most countries
, private sector debt ratios are above 100% of GDP 
and the threshold in the scoreboard of the M
acroeconomic 
Imbalance 
Procedure 
(133% of GDP) is exceeded by 
ten
 euro area countries (
see 
Chart C).
 While this 
threshold is a purely 
statistical
 indicator
18, which does not take into account 
economic fundamentals, it signals that in some countries deleveraging needs might 
still exist
. 
It should be noted that a conclusive 
assessment
 of 
the extent of 
deleveraging needs
 would also require a
 supplementary analysis
 of 
the distribution 
of debt across households and 
non-financial corporations
, together with
 their
 respective underlying characteristics
.

debt 
over the period 1995

 Note: 
The total 
debt 
(of non
-financial corporations and households) for CY is 350.
6%. The decomposition between debt held by households (HH
s) and 
by 
non-financial corporations (NFC
s) shows that 
the proportion of 
the latter is on 
average larger
. There are three exceptions: Germany, where the proportion of
 debt 
held by 
HHs 
is higher than that held by 
NFC
s; 
and Greece and
 the Netherlands, 
where the 
proportion
 of debt held by
 each
 sector is 
approximately equal
. The NFC 
debt-to
-GDP
 ratio is 
very
 high i
n Ireland, Cyprus
 and Luxembourg
. In these countries
 the 
value
 of NFC
-held
 debt is, however,
 particularly affected by large cross
-border 
intra
-company loans.
 There is a growing 
body of 
empirical literature 
which 
show
s 
that high 
levels of 
private sector 
debt can have significant adverse effects on future economic 
outcomes.
 While p
rivate indebtedness, at moderate levels, help
s 
to smooth 
consumption
 and enhance economic growth
, an excessive increase in private sector 
debt over the medium term 
can 
affect capital accumulation
 and lead to lower 
economic growth
.19 This occurs 
because
 investment is reduced as companies 
need income 
to repay their debt
 and
 private consumption is also reduced as 
overleveraged households need to increase savings to cover debt service 
obligations
. Moreover, 
banks™ lending suffers as high private sector 
indebtedness is 
often associated with rising non
-performing loans, which tend to erode banks™ capital 
buffers.
20 Some
 empirical 
analysis
 shows
 that
 these adverse effects occur only 
above
 a 
certain threshold
.21 There is 
also 
evidence that delays in dealing with debt 
overhang
s 
can lead to lower firm exit rates and can significantly affect the degree of 
capital and labour reallocation across firms and sectors which, in the medium term, 
                                                                    19

The deleveraging process across euro area countries has
 come about
 as a 
result of
 both nominal GDP growth and a reduction in 
private debt
. Empirical 
evidence show
s 
that a
 rapid
 and front
-loaded deleveraging process tends to be 
associated with medium
-term output gains
.23 This also seems to be the case in the 
experience of the euro area, where early and swift deleveraging episodes (e.g. in 
Estonia, Ireland, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia) have been associated with 
subsequent higher real GDP growth per capita (see Chart D).
 Chart E shows that in 
four countries
 (Greece, Spain, Portugal and Slovenia)
 the deleveraging process has 
occurred mainly 
through a reduction in nominal debt, i.e. via debt repayments or 

write
-offs. In five countries (Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania and the Netherlands
) it 
occurred 
as a result of
 a combination of 
a reduction in nominal debt and
 an increase 
in nominal GDP. In five countries (
Germany
, Estonia, Ireland, Malta a
nd Austria
) deleveraging was driven 
exclusively 
by nominal GDP growth. The chart also shows 
that unfavourable nominal GDP developments caused headwinds for the debt
-reduction process in Greece, Cyprus and 
Portugal.

 The current deleveraging process has been supported by a significant 
red
uction in interest payments.
 The maturity structure and the interest payments 
measure the short
-term debt burden and thus can 
provide information
 about short 
term risks associated 
with
 the ability to meet debt repayment schedule
s. While 
aggregate data on the average maturity structure of loans and securities across 
households and firms are not widely available, a short
-term indicator of borrower 
stress can be defined as the ratio of interest payments to income. This indicator is 
shown in Chart F, where the blue line represents the average interest payment
-to
-income ratio for the euro area, and the shaded areas represent the interquartile 

range across the euro area countries. Both 
HH and NFC interest payment
-to
-income 
ratios demonstrate a common downward
s 
tre
nd, in particular since 2009. For the 
euro area as a whole, the average of household interest payments has decreased 

from 4.1% (in 2008) to 0.9% (in 2016) of gross disposable income, while the average 

of NFC interest payments fell from 19.4% (in 2008) to 6.5% (in 2016) of gross 
operating surplus. However, heterogeneity across countries differs between the two 
sectors. While the cross
-country variation of the household interest burden seems to 
have fallen 
since the crisis, heterogeneity in interest payment
-to-
income ratios for 
NFCs remains relatively significant. The higher heterogeneity found 
for
 NFCs 
indicates that 
across 
countr
ies
 the risk premium associated 
with
 NFC debt is 
currently 
higher than that associated 
with
 HH debt.
 Looking forward,
 and 
given the
 high debt levels in some countries, 
deleveraging needs 
might 
continue to exist
. This box has shown that the
 recovery in 
GDP
 and the low interest rate environment have helped the deleveraging 
process. 
Further deleveraging 
could
 take place via 
the expansion 
of nominal GDP
. 
From a policy perspective, better debt workout mechanisms would facilitate balance 

sheet adjustments.

 Country
-specific recommendations
 for fiscal policies under the 2017 European Semester
 66 France nor Spain, the countries with a deficit above the reference value of 3% of 
GDP in 2016, are expected to deliver a noticeable structural adjustment over the 
period 2017
-18, i.e. a reduction of their budget deficit through factors other than the 
impact of the economic cycle and temporary budgetary measures. Moreover, 
significant shortfalls vis
-à-
vis structural adjustment requirements are anticipated in 
some countries that are currently under the SGP™s preventive arm and have not yet 

reached their MTOs. This comes at a time when these structural adjustment 

requirements have been lowered markedly for some countries in order to cater for a 
number of factors, including structural reforms, additional government investment 
and pension reforms, as well as costs incurred for hosting refugees and additional 

security spending. Overall, this flexibility could reduce the requirements for countr
ies 
to progress towards their MTO from, on average, an adjustment of around ½% of 

GDP to one of around ¼% of GDP in 2017.
29 Nevertheless, these countries are 
expected to conduct expansionary fiscal policies of, on average, 0.3% of GDP, i.e. 

policies that fu
rther deteriorate their structural balance.
 The Commission™s 
fiscal policy recommendations 
depart from those in the 
past in two 
respects
. First, only the recitals of the recommendations, rather than 
the enacting parts, specify
 the size of the structural 
adjustment
 that 
the Council 
recommend
s 
governments 
make to ensure full compliance with the SGP. It is usually 

the enacting parts that should provide clear ex
-ante guidance to governments on 
how to conduct public finances over the next 12
-18 months. They also s
erve as
 a 
guide to
 parliaments and the general public and as
 a 
reference
 for transparent 
ex-post assessment
s 
of compliance with the SGP
. It is therefore important that the 
fiscal guidance is fully incorporated, including in governments™ draft budgetary plan
s for 2018, in order to ensure sufficient progress towards sound public finances. 
Second, 
for all countries with structural adjustment requirements of 0.5% of GDP 

and above in 2018, irrespective of their level of government debt, the recitals state 
that ﬁ
the assessment of the 2018 Draft Budgetary Plan and subsequent assessment 
of 2018 budget outcomes will need to take due account of the goal to achieve a 
fiscal stance that contributes to both strengthening the ongoing recovery and 
ensuring the sustainabilit
y of 
[the respective Member State™s] 
public finances
ﬂ. This 
could imply reductions in structural adjustment requirements over and above those 
granted under the existing flexibility provisions in the SGP (as communicated by the 
Commission in January 2015)
.30 Going forward, it is important that a consistent 
implementation of the rules
-based SGP is ensured.
                                                                     29  
This excludes countries that have already achieved their MTO.

Note
s: 
In this table, the structural adjustment requirements are those recommended in the country
-specific recommendations (CSRs). For some countries under the preventive arm 
these have been reduced following the granting of flexibility to cater for the implementation of structural reforms, additional government investment, etc
. For other countries, these 
requirements can still be lowered if such flexibility is granted ex post. The expression ﬁat MTOﬂ reflects the fact that, according the European Commission™s forecast, countries are at 
their MTO at the beginning of the year in question. Structural adjustment requirements can be higher for countries subject to
 the debt rule. EDP refers to excessive deficit procedure.
 On 
22 May the 
European 
Commission also 
is
sued
 recommendations
 regarding 
the implementation of the 
SGP
. The Commission recommended abrogating the 
excessive deficit procedure (EDP) for Portugal by its 2016 deadline, and the Council 
adopted a corresponding decision on 16 June. Moreover, in reports prepared under 
Article 126(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the 

Commission examined the breach of the debt criterion in Belgium and Finland in 
2016 and decided against opening an EDP. In the case of Finland, the breach of the 
gover
nment debt reference value by 3.6% of GDP was explained by mitigating 
factors, including the provision of financial support to other euro area countries to 
safeguard financial stability and the negative impact of the economic cycle. As 
regards Belgium, the
 Commission concluded that, 
for 2016 and 2017 taken together
, the country
 was
 considered to be at risk of non
-compliance 
with the requirements of 
the preventive arm of the SGP
. 
The analysis 
nevertheless suggested
 that the debt 
criterion should be considered as currently complied with
 given that the projected 

deviation could still be corrected in 2017
. 
As regards Italy, the decision on opening a 
debt-based EDP was postponed. The Commission envisages reassessing Italy™s 
compliance with the debt criterion based on the draft budgetary plan for 2018 and 
the 
Commission™s Autumn 2017 Economic F
orecast.

In response to the sovereign debt crisis, the fiscal compact was set up to 
foster budgetary discipline and increase national ownership
 of the fiscal 
governance framework
.







To achieve these objectives, the fiscal
 compact
 obliges
 participating 
countries to commit legally to a balanced budget rule and to 
set up
 institutions 
to monitor adherence to 
this
 rule.


































































The European Commission published its review of the transposition of the 
fiscal compact into national legislation in February this year, three years after 
the 
transposition

ne (1
 January 2014).

Commodity price cycles contribute to 
understanding why the importance of 
global factors in relation to
 domestic inflation changes so 
widely
 over time. 








































To better understand the role of global and domestic factors in euro area 
inflation
, this section analyses the period after the crisis, disentangling the 
role of domestic and global factors and their relative importance over time
. 
Between 2008 and mid
-2013, headline inflation in the euro area has shown 
strong co
-movements with headline inflation 
in
 other advanced economies

Gauging the importance of global versus domestic factors in relation to 
developments in euro area consumer price inflation 
is not without its 
complications
.










An attempt to assess the relevance of global factors 
to headline inflation 
developments 
could begin by
 considering the individual HICP components.






A 
large part of the decline in headline inflation in the euro area
 and the OECD 
countries
 from 
the 
end of 2011
 until
 early 2016 has been on account of 
a decli
ne in energy prices
.



A striking difference between the euro area and
 the other
 OECD countries in 
general 
is that
, since 2013, 
lower 
HICP inflation excluding energy and food
 can 
explain
 a much more important, and more stable, part of the euro area 
disinflation
 and persistently low inflation
.

One approach for distinguishing domestic from global 
forces is to identify 
structural shocks and quantify their relative contributions to the dynamics of 
inflation.

































Working Paper Series

















































A decomposition 
of the driving forces of inflation in the euro area 
thus
 shows 
that 
both 
global and domestic shocks 
have 
play
ed a decisive role in shaping 
domestic inflation. The relative importance of these shocks can also
 change 
quite substantially over time.

Box 1 

Decelerating activity, excess capacity and falling producer 
pressures 
in China in recent 
years have focused interest on the role of China in shaping global inflation developments.



The integration of China into the global economy is likely to have influenced inflation 
dynamics in other economies through several channels. 
Supply and demand channels acted 























mostly in different 
ways
:




















Three decades of rapid expansion have meant a marked increase in China™s influence in the 
global economy, although its growth rate has slowed in recent years.

can affect CPI inflation in

As the pace of growth of 
activity in China 
has moderated, its influence on inflation in other 
economies has evolved (see Chart

World Economic Outlook

























The Phillips curve, which is broadly understood as the relationship between 
inflation and economic slack, is a standard framework for explaining and 
forecasting developments in inflation.



















Phillips
 curve analyses have traditionally focused
 on 
what role domestic slack 
has in relation to
 developments in 
underlying inflation.





























External factors are usually taken into account via import prices in Phillips 
curve specifications.




















































Economic Bulletin

A trad
itional Phillips curve decomposition of the changes in underlying 
inflation since the crisis illustrates reasonably well how inflation developed in 
the period from 2010 
Œ 
with the largest impact stemming from domestic slack.













































Is there any indication that globalisation has 
changed 
the impact of global 
cyclical conditions on domestic inflation in a way that cannot be captured by 
including import prices in Phillips 
curve analyses?























































One wa
y of assessing
 what role global influences have
 is 
to augment
 the 
traditional Phillips curve with a measure of foreign slack.
















More recently
 empirical studies have focused on
 an important transmission 
channel for the effects of global 
slack 
on domestic inflation, i.e. 
the 
increasing 
integration 
of GVCs
.




However, 
the literature 
provide
s 
only limited
 support for including a measure 
of foreign slack in traditional Phillips curve 
analyses
.
