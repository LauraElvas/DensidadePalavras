The range of efforts in which the European Central Bank 
(ECB) was engaged in 2014 was, by any historical standard, extraordinary. It gives me great satisfaction to be able to 
report here how the ECB, its Executive Board, its staff and 
the Eurosystem committees responded to challenges and empowered the Governing Council to deliver on our mandate and our responsibilities.In 2014 various strands of work initiated in previous years came together to produce a consistent policy response, one that allows us now to envisage with confidence that the weak and 
uneven recovery experienced in 2014 will turn into a more robust, sustainable upturn Œ and that inflation will return without undue delay to the ECB™s objective of below, but close to, 2% over the 
medium term.From a monetary policy perspective, the environment we faced in 2014 was complex. The muted recovery that had begun in 
2013 did not accelerate as initially expected. Monetary growth remained subdued and credit continued to contract, albeit at a gradually slower pace. In a context of low domestic inflationary pressures, the considerable fall in oil prices from the middle of 2014 resulted in further significant falls in inflation towards the end of the year. A key 
concern in this environment was that inflation would remain low for too long a period of time, ultimately also affecting inflation expectations over the longer term.
This called for monetary policy to act forcefully. We had to deploy unconventional 
monetary policy measures for two broad reasons. First, the transmission of our monetary policy had for some time been impaired across the euro area, with wide differences between countries. And second, the scope for using the standard 
instrument of monetary policy Œ short-term nominal interest rates Œ was limited as those rates were already near the effective lower bound.
In June and September, that remaining margin was exhausted as the Governing 
Council lowered policy interest rates to the effective lower bound, and introduced a 
negative interest rate on the ECB™s deposit facility. We also announced a series of 
targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) with the intention of supporting 
bank lending to the real economy. 
In September the Governing Council responded to a further worsening of the inflation outlook by announcing purchases of asset-backed securities and covered bonds, thereby initiating a monetary expansion by means of asset purchases, which 
was subsequently buttressed by the decision, announced in January 2015, to also purchase public sector securities.8Unusual challenges called for unusual responses. And this also applied to our 
communication. As the response of the economy to monetary policy impulses 
depends crucially on expectations, we had to make a greater effort to explain how 
we understood the new economic environment and to clarify our reaction function within it. In this vein, alongside the strengthening of the forward guidance which we had introduced in 2013, we laid out clearly in April the contingencies that would Œ and 
eventually did Œ prompt the Governing Council to take action. The monetary policy 
measures taken through the year were fully consistent with the road map laid out then. They confirmed the unanimous commitment signalled by the Governing Council 

to use both conventional and unconventional instruments to deal effectively with the 
risk of a too prolonged period of low inflation.Our focus on continuously enhancing the transparency of our deliberations and actions culminated in the announcement of our intention to start publishing accounts of the monetary policy discussion during Governing Council meetings. This began for 
the first meeting of 2015. Monetary policy does not, however, operate in a vacuum, and it benefited from 
another major undertaking by the ECB in 2014: the preparations for and start of operations of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). This extraordinary 

achievement, which involved hiring hundreds of new staff over a short period of time, 
provided the opportunity to conduct the largest-ever review of the quality of bank assets. The year-long comprehensive assessment of the balance sheets of the euro area™s 
130 biggest banks, which was completed in 2014, increased transparency and prompted many institutions to take pre-emptive action to strengthen their balance sheets, including via asset sales and capital raising. This in turn helped to put the 
banking system in a better position to transmit monetary policy impulses, and more generally to support the recovery by performing more normally its function of efficient 

credit allocation in the real economy.
Early evidence shows that our parallel policy initiatives, when combined, were effective. Bank lending rates to non-financial corporations started to decline in 
the second half of the year, and showed less dispersion across countries. The 
contraction of credit appears to be reversing. Growth projections, as well as inflation expectations Œ reflected both by outside observers and by ECB staff projections Œ 
have been revised upwards. And confidence overall has increased.
Our actions have therefore not only been consistent with our mandate. They have been 
credible, transparent and effective. They are continuing to underpin confidence in the 
euro, a currency whose attractiveness was confirmed at both ends of 2014: at the start, 
when Latvia became the 18th member country of the euro area; and at the end, as we 

were finalising preparations for the accession of Lithuania on 1 January 2015, bringing 
the number of states in the union to 19, representing 338 million people. 
One further major project that was successfully completed in 2014 merits a mention 
here. The latest addition to the Frankfurt skyline took its final shape. The cranes came 
9down, the internal fit-out was completed, and the ECB staff assigned to work in our 
new headquarters building moved into new office space on the banks of the river Main. 
This annual report goes into much richer detail on all these topics, describing our tasks and activities through 2014 and painting the wider macroeconomic picture. 
Compared with previous years, we have streamlined and enhanced the content in 
order to give you the best possible overview. While the coming year will bring with 

it fresh challenges, I speak on behalf of all ECB staff when I say we remain single-

minded in our commitment to deliver price stability for all euro area citizens.Frankfurt am Main, April 2015
Mario DraghiPresident10Chapter 1 The euro area economy, the ECB™s 
monetary policy and the European  financial sector in 20141 The euro area economy: low inflation and a weak 
recovery1.1 The global macroeconomic environment 
Three key developments in the world economy had a particularly significant influence on the euro area economy in the course of 2014: uneven growth developments across different regions of the world as well as continued weakness in global trade; 
falling oil and other commodity prices; and a weaker euro exchange rate.The global economic recovery remained gradual and unevenThe world economy expanded moderately in 2014, amid widening divergence 

across and within regions. Weakness in the first half of the year was largely due to 
temporary and one-off factors, such as the unusually cold winter in the United States 
and the shutdown of heavy-industry plants in China for environmental reasons. As

11year progressed, world activity gradually strengthened, setting the scene for more 
favourable, yet modest, external demand conditions for the euro area (see Chart 1).The shift in growth dynamics across regions that had already started in late 2013 continued in 2014, with momentum firming in most major advanced economies, while losing vigour in emerging market economies. Advanced economies 
increasingly benefited from waning private sector deleveraging, improved labour markets, rising confidence and accommodative policies. By contrast, in several emerging market economies, structural impediments and tightened financial conditions persisted, weighing on their growth prospects. Geopolitical risks, relating mostly to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and tensions in major oil-
producing countries, persisted throughout the year, but their direct impact on global 
activity remained rather limited (see also Box 1). Box 1The Ukraine conflict and its economic implications for the euro areaAs the conflict in eastern Ukraine escalated in the course of 2014, the sanctions imposed on Russia were progressively tightened. Most notably, the EU imposed financial market access 
restrictions on Russian banks and corporations in August, in close cooperation with the United 
States and other OECD countries. These measures were expanded in September to encompass 
a wider set of companies and financial instruments. In addition, the sale of defence equipment and the export of technologies to explore deposits of arctic, deep water and shale oil were prohibited. In retaliation, Russia introduced an embargo on food imports from the EU, the United States, 
Australia, Canada and Norway in August.
In combination with the considerable uncertainty 
triggered by the crisis and the fall in energy 
prices, the sanctions have placed a heavy 

burden on Russia™s economy. Already facing 
a protracted period of comparatively sluggish 
growth owing to widespread structural rigidities, 
economic activity was further dampened by the 
fallout from developments in Ukraine, mainly 
via two interrelated channels. First, funding 
costs for Russian banks, corporations and 

the government have soared (see Chart A), 
negatively affecting their financing options 

and therefore investment. Second, inflationary 

pressures have intensified, partly owing to 
the rouble™s steep depreciation, but also 
reflecting the adverse effects on domestic 
food prices from Russia™s embargo on imports 
of agricultural goods. This has eroded real 

incomes and forced the Bank of Russia to 
tighten liquidity conditions by means of foreign

and investment. Taken
 together, these factors caused the Russian economy to stagnate in 2014.
For the euro area, the impact of the crisis on growth and inflation seems to have been fairly 
moderate in 2014, notwithstanding notable trade links with Russia. Net of intra-euro area trade, 
Russia accounted for close to 5% of euro area merchandise exports, although exposure varies 

across individual euro area countries (see Chart B). Euro area exports to Russia primarily take 
the form of investment and consumer goods, whereas oil and gas constitute the euro area™s main 
imports from Russia. In 2014 exports to Russia fell tangibly for most euro area countries. However, 
it is difficult to disentangle the possible effects of the conflict in Ukraine, the associated sanctions and 
Russia™s food embargo from the lack of demand owing to the overall weakness of Russia™s economy. 
Similarly, indicators of consumer and business confidence deteriorated in some euro area countries 
after March 2014, but it is difficult to attribute 
such changes solely to events in Ukraine since 
other domestic or global factors may also have 
played a role. Finally, prices in the euro area 
in 2014 appeared to be little affected by the 
repercussions of the conflict.Just as the trade effects have been moderate, 
the Ukraine conflict has had limited financial implications for banks in the euro area. Nonetheless, claims on Russia by banks in 
some euro area countries are sizeable. In absolute terms, in the third quarter of 2014 the  cross-border claims against Russia of banks 
headquartered in France amounted to USD 47 billion, followed by institutions in Italy (USD 29 billion), Germany (USD 19 billion), Austria (USD 17 billion) and the Netherlands Chart BEuro area merchandise exports to Russia(as a percentage of total merchandise exports)0246

Austria). Not all euro area countries report their cross-border bank claims 
to the BIS.13(USD 14 billion) (see Chart C). However, these exposures are unlikely to constitute a systemic 
risk for the euro area as a whole. This said, potential spillovers from events in Russia may 
heterogeneously affect individual euro area countries and banking groups. 
Meanwhile, financial market volatility and risk aversion overall remained low during 
most of the year. However, two short-lived episodes of financial market turmoil 
occurred in early 2014 and in October 2014, when concerns about the resilience and pace of the global recovery emerged. Moreover, the US Federal Open Market 
Committee™s tapering of its asset purchases contributed to a gradual reduction 

in global liquidity from January 2014 onwards, further adding to financial market volatility at the beginning of 2014. The financial market tensions mostly affected 
those emerging market economies with significant domestic and external imbalances, 
having only very limited spillover effects on the euro area and the global economy. 
World trade remained weak overall in
 2014. Following several months of anaemic 
readings in the first half of the year, short-term trade indicators rebounded strongly in 
the second half of the year, albeit from very low levels. Overall, the volume of world 
imports of goods grew by 3.5% year on year in 2014, compared with 2.6% in 2013 
(according to data from the CPB Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy Analysis). 
As in the case of global activity, the sources of the underlying weakness in global 
trade shifted gradually from advanced economies to emerging market economies. 

The muted response of global trade to the gradual global recovery can be partly 
attributed to structural factors, such as the declining support from expanding global 
value chains. In addition, investment, which is typically a highly trade-intensive 
demand component, grew at an unusually subdued pace in a number of major 
economies. 
Falling oil prices put downward pressure on global inflation Turning to price developments, the main driving force behind subdued global inflation 

in 2014 was falling commodity prices, namely energy and, to a much lesser extent, food prices. The steady rise of global inflation until June was succeeded by a gradual 
slowdown in most advanced and emerging market economies, largely reflecting the sharp decline in international oil prices in the second half of the year. In the 
OECD area, average headline consumer price inflation edged up to 1.7% in 2014, 
from 1.6% in 2013, while average OECD consumer price inflation excluding food and energy increased to 1.8% from 1.6%.In the course of 2014 oil prices declined by 49% in US dollar terms and 41% in euro terms, as oil prices plunged from late June onwards. Following a period of relative stability at around USD 110
 per barrel in the first half of 2014, Brent crude oil prices 
reached levels below USD 60 per barrel by the end of the year (see Chart 2). Robust oil supply and weaker than expected oil demand explained the sharp decline in oil prices in the second half of the year. On the supply side, OPEC production increased 
as countries affected by geopolitical tensions, such as Libya and Iraq, provided 
surprisingly high oil output, which added to robust non-OPEC supply growth driven 14by unconventional oil production in North America 
(shale and tar sands). Moreover, within this context, 
OPEC decided at the end of November to leave its production target unchanged. At the same time, oil 
demand was weak, reflecting modest global growth.Non-energy commodity prices (denominated in US dollars) declined by about 12% compared with the beginning of the year. Food prices were mainly 
driven by developments in cereal prices. Following a sharp increase between February and May, cereal 

prices strongly declined on account of a record global harvest (in the United States and Europe in particular). Contrary to expectations related to the conflict situation in Ukraine, Black Sea grain production did not suffer 
significant disruptions. On aggregate, metal prices 
decreased as price increases for aluminium, nickel and zinc on the back of tightening supply were more than offset by a strong decline in the price of iron ore.
In addition to weaker international energy and food prices, inflationary pressures 
have been contained by the rather moderate global recovery. Growth in
 2014 was characterised by the very slow absorption of global spare capacity and labour market slack. At a country level, consumer price inflation was also affected by other factors, 
including exchange rate developments. For example, the appreciation of the US dollar and the pound sterling amplified the downward effect of falling international 

commodity prices on inflation in the United States and the United Kingdom respectively. 
Uneven growth momentum in major economiesIn the United States, economic activity accelerated in
 2014, with real GDP growth at 2.4% on average, 0.2 percentage point higher than in the previous year. Expectations at the beginning of the year had been higher: in January 2014 the average Consensus Economics forecast for annual GDP growth stood at 2.8%. One factor behind the eventual growth outturn was the adverse weather conditions at the turn of the year, which led to a significant decline in economic activity in the first quarter of 2014. In the remainder of the year economic growth was fairly strong and supported by final domestic demand, suggesting that the recovery became more 
sustainable. This development was consistent with the gradually improving economic fundamentals supported by accommodative monetary policy, buoyant financial market conditions, positive wealth effects from rising stock and house prices, and improvements in the housing and labour markets. Inflation remained relatively subdued in 2014 as a whole. This was mainly due to 
spare capacity in the economy, together with sharp declines in energy prices and 
an appreciation of the US dollar in nominal effective terms in the second half of the 

year. Average annual CPI inflation stood at
 1.6% in 2014 after 1.5% in 2013. Inflation excluding food and energy prices was 1.7% in 2014, following 1.8% in 2013. Chart 2Commodity prices(daily data)3040506070

In the context of generally improving economic prospects, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) gradually reduced its asset purchases over the course of the year and concluded them in October. In addition, the FOMC kept its target for the federal funds rate unchanged 
within a range of 0% to 0.25% throughout 2014. The threshold-based guidance 
based on the unemployment rate and projected inflation rate, provided by the FOMC since December 2012, was changed in March 2014 as the actual unemployment rate approached the threshold of 6.5%. The FOMC moved to a qualitative form of 

guidance, taking into account a wide range of variables in determining how long to maintain its federal funds rate target range. As regards fiscal policy, the federal fiscal 
deficit declined to 2.8% of GDP in the fiscal year
 2014, down from 4.1% in the fiscal year 2013 and the lowest since 2007.In Japan, economic activity slowed markedly during most of 2014. Headline inflation rose during 2014 following the consumption tax increase. However, underlying price pressures remained subdued, with consumer price inflation excluding the 
consumption tax increase well below the Bank of Japan™s 2% inflation target. The Bank of Japan expanded its quantitative and qualitative monetary easing programme by accelerating the annual pace of increase in the monetary base to about JPY 80 trillion (from about JPY 60-70 trillion previously) and made it open-ended, following downward pressure on prices and weak growth. In the United Kingdom, the pace of economic activity remained robust in the 
course of 2014. The decline in macroeconomic uncertainty and relatively loose credit conditions supported domestic demand, in particular private consumption and housing investment, leading to an acceleration in GDP growth from 1.7% 
in 2013 to 2.6% in 2014, according to preliminary estimates. Stronger growth was accompanied by a strengthening of the labour market. The unemployment rate declined to 5.7% at the end of 2014, compared with a level of more than 7% one year before. Despite the recovery in GDP growth, government borrowing in the first half of the fiscal year 2014-15 exceeded initial budget forecasts, owing in large part to weak earnings growth, and the government budget deficit stood above 5% of GDP. Inflation declined below the Bank of England™s target of
 2%. Inflation averaged 1.5% in 2014, mainly owing to moderate wage growth and the lagged effects of the 
appreciation of the pound sterling in the first half of the year. Throughout the year 

the Bank of England™s Monetary Policy Committee maintained an accommodative 
monetary policy stance, keeping the policy rate at 0.5% and the size of the asset purchase programme at GBP 375 billion.In China, real GDP growth continued to decline, owing to slower investment growth, in particular for residential investment. Exports were relatively robust on the back of a recovering external environment, while import growth remained lacklustre in line with weakening investment and lower oil prices, leading to a slight increase in 
the current account surplus to 2.1% of GDP. The authorities started implementing a considerable number of structural reforms, making progress in opening up the capital account and interest rate liberalisation, among other things. Credit expansion continued to be strong, while there were increasing signs of financial stress as 16the economy weakened. Inflationary pressures remained subdued owing to lower commodity prices, but also because of continued restructuring in construction-related industries. Notably, producer price inflation remained negative for another year. The appreciation of the renminbi slowed down markedly in 2014.The euro weakened In the course of 2014 the euro weakened in nominal effective terms. Euro exchange 

rate developments in 2014 largely reflected the different cyclical positions and 
monetary policy stances across major economies. In early May 2014 the euro peaked at levels similar to those in 2010-11
 both in nominal effective terms and 
vis-à-vis the US dollar, after undergoing a period of 

steady appreciation that had started in July 2012 (see Chart 3). From June 2014 onwards the euro depreciated in particular against the US dollar against 
the background of a continuously declining outlook for growth and inflation in the euro area, while the ECB announced additional monetary policy measures. In the last two months of the year the depreciation of the euro™s effective exchange rate was partly reversed by 

the pronounced weakness of the Japanese yen and the Russian rouble.The nominal effective exchange rate of the euro (as 
measured against 39 major trading partners) declined by 3.4% in annual terms. Bilaterally, the euro weakened 
most strongly against the US dollar (-12.6%), as the US Federal Reserve System continued to taper and eventually ceased asset purchases under its quantitative easing programme in an environment of 
steady domestic growth and improving labour market developments. In line with this, the euro weakened against currencies that are linked to the US dollar, 
including the Chinese renminbi (-10.2%). The euro also depreciated against the 

pound sterling (-6.8%). By contrast, the euro appreciated slightly against the Japanese yen (+0.4%). The appreciation largely occurred after the Bank of Japan 
announced that it would extend its unsterilised government bond purchases and use 
further non-standard monetary policy measures to achieve its medium-term inflation target. Finally, the euro appreciated strongly against the Russian rouble (+60%), in 
particular after the Bank of Russia officially adopted a floating exchange rate regime 
in November in an environment of persisting geopolitical tensions and declining energy prices.Turning to those European currencies that have close links to the euro,

1 The Bulgarian lev remained fixed to the euro and the Swiss franc continued to trade within a narrow range close to its official cap of CHF/EUR 1.20 until the Swiss National Bank decided to abandon its currency ceiling vis-à-vis the euro on 15 January 2015. Finally, the euro strengthened against the currencies of those EU Member States with floating exchange rate regimes. In particular, the euro appreciated against the Hungarian forint (+7.0%), the Swedish krona (+5.9%) and the Polish zloty (+2.8%), while it remained broadly stable against the Czech koruna (+1.1%), the Croatian kuna 
(+0.4%) and the Romanian leu (+0.3%).1.2 Financial developments The following key developments in the financial dynamics of the euro area stood 
out in 2014: the further normalisation of the situation in money markets, a significant decline in government bond yields and in intra-euro area sovereign spreads in most countries, a stabilisation in the cost of external financing for non-financial corporations and an improvement in the financial condition of households. Conditions in the euro area money market continued to normaliseTrading activity in the euro area money market continued to improve over 2014, 
although some fragmentation along national lines remained. The decisions of the 
ECB™s Governing Council to lower the main refinancing rate to close to zero and 
move the deposit facility rate into negative territory (see Section 2.1) implied that short-term money market rates became negative. For 
instance, in December 2014 overnight index swap rates were negative for maturities of up to three years, and at longer maturities the yield curve flattened. During the first half of 2014 short-term money market rates were characterised by slightly higher volatility, 

which, however, did not translate into an increase in 
either the level or the volatility of longer-term money market rates. In May the volatility observed in short-term rates was notably linked to the fluctuations in excess liquidity as counterparties adapted their recourse to Eurosystem operations against the background of high three-year longer-term refinancing operation (LTRO) repayments, as well as high volatility 
in autonomous factors (see Chart 4).While the introduction of the negative deposit facility rate in June 2014 was overly reflected in overnight 
money market rates, the subsequent rate cut by 1 The Danish krone traded slightly above its target rate of DKK/EUR 7.460 at the end of 2014, while the 
Lithuanian litas traded at a fixed peg before the country adopted the euro.Chart 4Short-term money market rates and excess liquidity(EUR billions; percentages per annum)-0.2-0.10.0

left overnight rates only slightly negative after the September rate cut, and they thus remained significantly above the deposit facility rate, also when the modest level of excess liquidity is taken into account. Several factors appear to explain the lagged pass-through. First, as expected, many banks were reluctant to pass on the negative deposit facility rate to parts of their deposit base. Second, as regards their own holdings, banks employed generic negative rate avoidance strategies, such as an intensified search for yield at longer-term maturities. Third, a number of other frictions accounted for the lagged pass-
through in specific areas of the market.Despite this lagged pass-through in very short-term money market rates, negative rates resulted in lower funding costs further along the curve, given the shift in 
investor preferences towards longer maturities. Government bond yields declined significantly Most euro area government bond yields declined significantly and reached new 
historical lows. During 2014 long-term yields on AAA-rated sovereign bonds in 
the euro area experienced significant declines (see Chart 5). This was a result of 
increasing concerns among investors about macroeconomic prospects, the likelihood of lower inflation, and the forward guidance and other monetary policy decisions of the ECB. Additionally, the very low money market rates triggered a search for 
yield. As the US Federal Reserve System began to phase out its quantitative easing 
programme, the long-term bond yield spread between the United States and the euro 
area widened to its highest level since 2004.Intra-euro area sovereign spreads declined further for 
most countries, notably for those which experienced more significant improvements in macroeconomic and fiscal fundamentals. Credit spreads also narrowed in the corporate bond market, despite a few episodes of volatility owing to geopolitical tensions and valuation 
concerns.Financial market indicators of inflation expectations declined in 2014, particularly at short to medium-term horizons. Longer-term inflation expectations also declined below 2% in the latter part of the year.

downward pressures on euro area stocks were stronger than those in other major markets, reflecting weaker than expected economic data releases for the euro area and the fact that geopolitical tensions weighed more heavily on euro area stocks as the macro-financial 
consequences of the Russia/Ukraine conflict were considered more severe for the euro area. Overall, although the recovery in euro area stock markets has been considerable in recent years, the EURO STOXX 
index still remains around 25% below its level at  end-2007.Cost of external financing for non-financial corporations stabilisedThe overall nominal cost of external financing for non-financial corporations was broadly unchanged. A marked decrease in the cost of market-based 
debt and in the cost of bank lending was almost fully compensated for by a significant increase in the cost of equity, which in turn was explained by a surge in 
equity risk premia in the first nine months of the year (see Chart 7). At the same time, although moderating 

somewhat, the heterogeneity in external financing costs across euro area countries remained significant.Recourse to external financing was broadly stable at low levelsIn 2014 non-financial corporations™ use of external 
financing was broadly stable at low levels (see Chart 8), after moderating between early 2011 and mid-2013. 

The net issuance of debt securities and quoted shares by non-financial corporations remained at robust 
levels and continued to more than offset the negative 
flows from the net redemptions of bank loans. Lending by non-MFIs and foreign entities was weak. This 
suggests that indirect bond issuance by non-financial corporations via their conduits resident in other member countries and outside the euro area was muted. Trade credit and inter-company 

lending remained weak, possibly as a result of firms using higher retained profits 
and deposit holdings to finance working capital. The net issuance of unquoted

Continued deleveraging may have been prevented by the weakness in economic activity.Household net worth continued to reboundIn 2014 households™ net worth continued to rebound, 

on account of continued increases in securities prices, while losses on real estate holdings decreased markedly (see Chart 9). Households™ financial 
investment, although having slightly increased, remained at levels close to its historical low, reflecting 
still weak income growth and deleveraging needs in a number of countries. Households continued to allocate 
savings to deposits, as well as to life insurance and pension products. At the same time, they increased 
their mutual fund share and direct equity holdings significantly and continued to move away from debt securities. The financing costs of households declined 

markedly, but continued to vary depending on the 
type and maturity of the loan and the country of origin. Households™ new borrowing from banks remained 
weak and their indebtedness continued to decline gradually, albeit remaining at relatively high levels. 
Households™ debt ratios continued to differ significantly 
across countries. The household debt servicing burden 

declined further owing to the ongoing weakness in credit dynamics and declines in bank lending rates.2 This was partly due to foreign multinational firms continuing to transfer retained profits out of the euro 
area. Such transfers are initially recorded, by statistical convention, under this item in firms™ balance

211.3 Economic activityFollowing two years of negative annual real output growth in the wake of the sovereign 
debt crisis, in 2014 the gradual recovery in the euro area that had started in the second 
quarter of 2013 continued, albeit unevenly throughout the year. As a result, average 
annual growth stood at 0.9% in 2014. This outcome reflected a positive and increasing 
contribution from domestic demand, given broadly neutral 

contributions from net trade and inventory developments 
(see Chart 10). At the same time, the acceleration in 
growth that had been expected to take place around the 

middle of the year did not materialise. This reflected weak 
external demand and a variety of factors across euro area 
countries, with insufficient progress in the implementation 
of structural reforms in some countries playing a key role.The economic recovery continued in 2014 but at a slow pace The return to positive average annual growth in 2014 was 
supported by the very accommodative monetary policy 
stance, improving financing conditions and sounder 
fiscal balances. These factors, in particular the various 
monetary policy measures implemented over recent 
years, supported primarily consumer confidence and 
private consumption, which was the main driver of the 
recovery. Business confidence also improved relative 

to the average in 2013, as financial market uncertainty 
declined and financial conditions, including those for small 
and medium-sized enterprises, improved, notably during the first half of the year. Later 

in 2014 the decrease in energy prices brought a significant recovery Œ after an extended 
period of decline Œ in real disposable incomes among firms as well as households, 

where the latter also benefited from the rise in employment. 
The growth trend in 2014 was at the same time dampened by a number of factors, mainly affecting investment. These factors related in particular to weak trade 
momentum, the high level of unemployment, the sizeable unutilised capacity, 
the ongoing adjustments of balance sheets in the public as well as the private sector and, not least, the insufficient impetus in, and uncertainties surrounding, 
the implementation of structural reforms in some euro area countries. A further 
dampening factor was related to geopolitical tensions, in particular in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, which implied higher uncertainty as regards economic prospects 
and profitability in the latter part of 2014. A number of factors weigh on long-term growth. Box

the highest contribution since 2007. Private consumption continued to strengthen

disposable income, supported by the decline in commodity prices. The household 
saving ratio broadly stabilised in the first half of 2014 and is expected to have 
remained at a relatively low level in the second half of the year, thus supporting 
consumption dynamics. Following declines in the previous two years, total investment 
rose overall in 2014, but contracted in the second and third quarters of the year, 
chiefly due to the persistent weakness in the construction component. This loss 
of momentum followed four consecutive quarters of positive quarterly growth and 

mainly reflects that the acceleration in growth that had been expected to take place 
around the middle of the year did not materialise. This held back investment as profits 
weakened and uncertainty regarding future demand prospects increased. Government 
consumption contributed positively to economic growth in 2014 mainly on account 
of slightly higher growth in social transfers in kind, which encompass items such as 

healthcare expenditure, whereas growth in compensation of public employees as well 
as intermediate consumption remained subdued or even slowed down. 
Box 2
Long-term growth prospects for the euro areaPotential output measures the level of economic activity that may be achieved in the medium to 
long term, when all resources are fully utilised. Estimates of potential output by international and 
European institutions, such as the European Commission, the IMF and the OECD, all show that the 
potential growth of the euro area has been negatively affected by the economic and financial crisis. It 
is estimated to have slowed to between 0.5% and 1.0% by 2014, from above 1.5% before the crisis. 

Looking ahead, longer-term projections indicate that potential growth in the euro area will gradually 
increase to pre-crisis growth rates, albeit remaining weaker than in the United States. This box 
reviews long-term growth prospects in the euro area and the underlying factors behind them.What are the reasons for past differences with the United States?Euro area potential growth in the early 

1990s is estimated to have been around 2%, 
considerably higher than estimates for the 
2010s. In addition, potential growth in the euro 
area has been lagging behind that in the United 
States for several decades (see Chart A). Of 
the three main components of growth, namely 
labour, capital and total factor productivity 

(TFP), the growth of the latter in particular has 
been slower for the total economy in the euro 
area than in the United States (for a comparison 
of the determinants of potential growth in 
the euro area and the United States, see 

Chapter 5 of ﬁPotential output from a euro area 
perspectiveﬂ, Occasional Paper Series, No 156, 
ECB, November 2014). Several reasons might 

be behind this. A number of indicators on

of the population, internet penetration and high-tech exports as a share of manufactured exports Œ 
suggest that the euro area is lagging behind in terms of innovative capacity. In particular, diffusion 
of information and communication technology (ICT) has played a larger role in the United States 
and its contribution to the productivity growth of the services sector has been higher (see Chart B). 
Although in the 2000s progress was made on product market reforms in the euro area, services 
and labour markets have remained more rigid than in the United States.The effects of the economic and financial crisisThe economic and financial crisis has reduced euro area potential output via two main channels: lower investment and higher structural unemployment. First, during the most severe phase of the crisis, investment rates declined considerably, with financing conditions, such as terms and 

availability of credit, worsening in particular. Increased economic and political uncertainty and an 
unfavourable economic outlook made it more difficult to assess investment projects and lowered 

the expected rate of return on investments. High indebtedness of non-financial corporations in some euro area countries also made deleveraging necessary, further reducing credit demand. 
Second, the crisis has also led to an increase in short to medium-term structural unemployment 
rates, indicated by the rise in long-term unemployment and an increase in skill mismatches. The 

unemployment rate of low-skilled workers has increased more than that of high-skilled workers, largely 
because the crisis triggered a sectoral relocation in many euro area economies, in particular a shift 
away from the construction sector. As it may be difficult for low-skilled workers dismissed from one 
sector to find jobs in other sectors, and as their human capital progressively erodes with the duration of 
unemployment, structural unemployment rates may remain elevated for an extended period.

personal respectively.
24The crisis has also affected the uncertainty 
related to estimates and projections of potential output, making the measurement of slack in the economy more difficult. Substantial downward 
revisions to potential growth estimates have been made since 2008 by international institutions as well as the European Commission (see Chart C). Moreover, potential 

growth is likely to have been overestimated prior to the crisis, as large macroeconomic imbalances in the pre-crisis period proved ex post that growth was unsustainable in many euro area countries.Long-term outlookIn the medium term the effects of the crisis 

are expected to fade away and euro area 
growth is expected to converge to its long-term 
potential, which might also be supported by 

the Investment Plan for Europe announced in 
2014. According to long-term projections by the 
OECD, potential growth in the United States is 
expected to accelerate to 2.5% in the medium 
term, while potential growth in the euro area 

is projected to remain lower, although rising. 
After 2025 growth in both regions is expected 
to gradually slow down, reaching around 1.5% 
by 2050 (see Chart D). This projection for the 
euro area might be optimistic, as it assumes 
the convergence of TFP growth towards the 
historical TFP growth of the leading OECD 

countries, as well as the convergence of product 
market and trade regulations towards the OECD 
average. In other words, the projections assume 
that structural reforms will be fully implemented.In the euro area, the main factor likely to 
weigh on potential growth in the long run 
is demographics. Although some support is expected from an increase in fertility rates and life 

expectancy as well as inward migration, the euro area population is projected to peak around 2040 

before starting to decrease gradually, as migration is unlikely to be able to continue to offset the 
natural decline in population. Employment is expected to increase only until around 2020, as rising 
employment rates will continue to offset the expected decline in working-age population until then, 
but it will start to decline thereafter. These developments are expected to result in a significant 
increase in the old-age dependency ratio (i.e. in the share of the population aged 65 years or 
over) from about 28% in 2014 to 50% in 2050. Therefore, in the long run, labour input will make a

25negative contribution to potential growth. The higher dependency ratios suggest that demographics 
could also weigh on capital accumulation, as ageing puts pressure on the pension systems and 
government financing and may lead to higher precautionary savings and lower investment.Given that, in the long run, the lack of labour supply is expected to weigh on economic growth, growth must come from productivity and ICT dynamics. As presented above, there is considerable 

room for improving TFP growth in the euro area. In market services and particularly in distribution 
services, there has been a large gap in TFP contributions, but also in the boost provided by ICT 
capital to sectoral growth, between the United States and the euro area (see Chart B). In addition, to avoid a long period of low growth, the euro area needs to catch up with best practices in terms of economic efficiency by improving conditions for innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as 
labour market institutions, and by relaxing regulations.Net trade is likely to have made a broadly neutral contribution to growth in 2014 as 
exports and imports displayed similar growth rates, which were both higher than in 2013. The year started off with relatively weak export growth in the first quarter. 
This probably reflected a number of factors, such as the deceleration in growth of the world economy, notably in a number of emerging market economies, and the 
lagged effects of the earlier euro appreciation. Exports rebounded from the second 
quarter onwards, on account of the recovery in global growth and, as of May, the 
depreciation of the euro exchange rate. As for imports, they followed a similar path to 
exports, showing relatively weak growth at the beginning of the year and recovering 
strongly in the second half.Changes in inventories are also expected to have made 
a broadly neutral contribution to GDP growth in
 2014, in line with the slow recovery that took place in the euro area in the course of the year. This outcome represents 
an improvement compared with the previous two years, in which inventories were a drag on overall activity.
The recovery in 2014 was relatively broadly based from a sectoral perspective. Value added in both industry 
excluding construction and services rose, following two years of contraction and of broad stability respectively. 
The recovery in the services sector has been the most prominent. Services value added stood on average during the first three quarters of 2014 slightly above its pre-crisis level in 2008, while value added in industry 
excluding construction remained below its pre-crisis level (see Chart 11). At the same time, value added in 
construction displayed a small decline, which implies that the construction sector has been shrinking for seven consecutive years. Chart 11

of persons employed, which had declined by 0.8% in 2013, rose slightly in 2014. As a result, by the 
third quarter of 2014 euro area employment stood about 0.6% above its level one year earlier. This is the 
highest annual growth rate recorded since the start 
of the crisis in 2008. Recent evidence also suggests that the speed of employment creation relative to the strength of output growth has somewhat increased since the onset of the crisis in 2008 Œ albeit with strong cross-country variation. While part of the more intense 
employment growth response to output growth can be explained by cyclical factors, this positive development might also reflect the impact of structural reforms in 
labour markets, which have been particularly wide-ranging in some euro area countries.The rise in employment reflected improvements in the services sector, while the 

number of persons employed in industry excluding construction was broadly stable compared with 2013. Meanwhile, employment in construction continued to contract in annual terms, albeit at a declining rate. In contrast to 2013, total hours worked increased slightly more than headcount employment in 2014. Since the acceleration in employment growth was somewhat lower than the increase in output growth, annual productivity growth per person employed averaged around 0.5% over the first three quarters of 2014, which compares with an annual rise of 0.3% in 2013. Although the rise in productivity growth was broadly based 

across sectors, it largely reflected developments in construction.The unemployment rate declined further in 2014, even though the rate of decline diminished somewhat throughout the year. The decline in unemployment since the 
first half of 2013 has been broad-based across gender and age groups. For 2014 as a whole, the unemployment rate averaged 11.6%, compared with an average rate 

of 12.0% in 2013.1.4 Price and cost developmentsThroughout 2014 headline HICP inflation in the euro area continued its downward 

trend, mainly reflecting oil and food price developments. The contribution from the 
services and non-energy industrial goods components was more stable but low, also 
reflecting low inflationary pressures stemming from domestic sources.Chart 12Labour market indicators(quarter-on-quarter growth rate, percentage of the labour force; seasonally adjusted)-1.0-0.8

Source: Eurostat.27Headline inflation declined further in 2014, driven mainly  by oil pricesIn 2014 headline HICP inflation in the euro area was
 0.4% on average, down from 1.4% in 2013 and 2.5% in 2012. This slowdown was more pronounced than 
expected in late 2013 and can be attributed primarily to global factors such as falling commodity prices, impacting in particular energy and 
food prices. Underlying inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding energy and food, was broadly stable 
in 2014, but remained low, reflecting the weak demand 
in the euro area over that period.Looking at the main components of the HICP in more 
detail, a large share of the fall in headline annual HICP 

inflation from the end of 2013 (see Chart 13) can be attributed to the energy component (around 70%). Energy inflation was negative in almost every month 
of 2014, owing mainly to developments in oil prices in euro terms (see also Box 3). After peaking in mid-June, 
the price of crude oil denominated in euro had fallen by around 40% by the end of the year, as the depreciation 
of the EUR/USD exchange rate only partly offset the 

sharp decline in crude oil prices in US dollar terms. Lower gas prices also added to the downward pressure on energy prices in 2014.Box 3
The impact of oil prices on euro area inflationThe developments in oil prices in 2014 affected euro area HICP inflation via both direct and 
indirect channels. The direct effects of oil prices can be gauged from the contribution that energy 
prices make to overall HICP inflation (see Chart A). Consumer energy prices, and in particular 
prices for transport and heating fuels, normally react to the euro price of oil with a very short lag of a few weeks and the pass-through is more or less complete. In this respect, the source of the 
oil price movement, whether supply or demand driven, or whether generated by the oil price in USD or the EUR/USD exchange rate, is typically not relevant. The depreciation of the euro since 

May 2014 only partly offset the disinflationary impact of the fall in crude oil prices in US dollars in 
the second half (and especially in the last quarter) of 2014.At the same time, the elasticity of consumer energy prices with regard to oil price developments 
depends on the level of oil prices. The reason is the typically large share of (fixed) excise duty in 
the litre price of fuels (see Chart B as an example for petrol prices). Together with broadly stable 
refining and distribution margins, this implies that a certain percentage change in the euro price of 

oil triggers a lower percentage change in consumer energy prices when oil prices are low compared 
with when they are at high levels. Although updated with a considerable delay, the share of energy 
goods in the HICP basket increases when oil prices are high, as demand for energy products tends 
to be inelastic; this, in turn, will increase the elasticity of the HICP to oil prices.Chart 13HICP inflation and contributions by components

obvious in the case of energy-intensive transportation services, but also applies to the production of many other goods and services. Producer prices in the euro area for domestic sales tend to respond to oil price developments with some lag (see Chart C). Overall, the degree of response depends on the adjustment of other costs and/or variation in producers™ mark-ups. Prices set 
by producers in the euro area and those set by producers in trading partner countries (in their national currencies) are highly correlated, 
suggesting that they are shaped by common 
global factors. Goods and services covered by the HICP 
basket can also be imported. Lower oil prices are also likely to influence producer prices in 
the economies of euro area trading partners and thus the prices of imported items reflected in the euro area HICP.
The quantification of indirect effects is 
surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty. 
Chart D shows the estimated indirect effect of 
oil price developments on euro area consumer prices excluding energy since the latest peak in inflation in the last quarter of 2011. Looking 

at the period as a whole, the downward trend in HICP inflation excluding energy reflects

estimates of indirect impacts characterise average responses over business cycles. The 
concrete pass-through at each point in time is linked to the behaviour of firms and their ability to adjust margins, which is influenced by the elasticity of demand, the degree of competition 
and the flexibility of other costs. Also, the 
pass-through depends on how long firms believe that the oil price movement will last. In the current environment of weak consumer demand and price adjustment needs in some 
euro area countries, it is conceivable that oil price changes might have a larger impact than in other situations.Overall, oil price developments dampened euro area HICP inflation in
 2014 largely via direct effects on consumer energy prices, but also via indirect effects through lower domestic costs 

and imported prices. It is important that such temporary developments do not affect longer-term 
inflation expectations and do not have a more lasting impact on the behaviour of wage and price-setters, which could trigger a more persistent impact on inflation via second-round effects.
The contribution of the food component to the fall in headline HICP inflation in
 2014 was also substantial, mainly as a result of the more favourable weather conditions than in 2013. Russia™s ban on the import 
of food products appeared to have a limited impact, 
with any downward pressure being offset by prices 
normalising after the positive weather-related supply shocks earlier in the year.
The two remaining components of the HICP, i.e. non-
energy industrial goods and services, are more likely to reflect developments in domestic demand. HICP 
inflation excluding energy and food remained low but broadly stable in 2014, standing at 0.8% on average (see Chart 14). This reflected relatively weak consumer 
demand, low pricing power among firms, modest wage developments in several euro area countries, the 
lagged effects of the earlier appreciation of the euro, 
and indirect effects stemming from the pass-through of 
lower commodity and energy prices.Chart DEstimated impact of crude oil prices on HICP

generally broad-based across the individual euro area countries and across goods categories. The annual rates of growth in the prices of durable, semi-durable and 
non-durable goods declined further in 2014, reflecting lacklustre domestic demand, but also external factors such as weak commodity prices and the past appreciation of the euro, which has an impact on import prices. Looking 
back over a longer period, non-energy industrial goods 
inflation was dampened by the rapid fall in the prices of high-tech goods, which are the subject of strong competition among retailers at both the national and international level.Pipeline pressures on consumer prices for non-energy industrial goods remained weak throughout 2014, reflecting weak energy and non-energy commodity 
prices, as well as low demand. Inflation in producer prices in the non-food consumer goods industries Œ which have a large impact on prices for non-energy industrial goods Œ remained low, hovering around levels 
just above zero throughout the year. Producer prices in 
the intermediate goods industries, as well as prices in euro for crude oil and other commodities, suggest that 
pressures were also subdued at the earlier stages of the price chain (see Chart 15).Annual services inflation bottomed out in 2014, reflecting a weak recovery in the euro area. It remained at a low level particularly in those countries suffering 
from market tensions. Items in the services component of the HICP tend to be produced domestically, which 
means that services prices are more closely linked to developments in domestic demand and labour costs.Domestic price pressures remained lowDomestic cost pressures stemming from labour costs 
eased further in the first three quarters of 2014, in line with the continued weakness in labour markets (see Chart 16). The pattern of wage growth at the 
euro area level continued to conceal considerable divergences in wage developments across countries. Most of the weakening in wage dynamics stemmed from substantial wage moderation in those countries 
suffering from market tensions, reflecting weak 
economic activity and the impact of reforms to enhance wage and price flexibility and boost competitiveness.Chart 15Breakdown of industrial producer prices(annual percentage changes)-25-20

By contrast, the annual rate of growth in negotiated wages was somewhat higher, suggesting a negative wage drift in the 
euro area over this period. The annual rate of growth in unit labour costs stayed low 
at levels around 1% and the slight increase towards the end of the year reflected weaker productivity growth which more than offset the moderation in wage growth.
Domestic cost pressures stemming from profit developments also remained low 
in 2014. The recovery in profits (measured in terms of gross operating surplus) 
continued in the first three quarters of 2014, but slowed in the course of the year. 
Profits per unit of output added only slightly to the increase in the GDP deflator in
 2014.Survey and market-based inflation expectations reacted to low inflation data releases and sharply declining energy prices. The dampening impact was particularly 

strong in the case of short-term inflation expectations, which moved in tandem with the fall in headline inflation. However, from mid-2014
 medium to long-term inflation expectations also began to decline, albeit staying close to 2% when gauged from surveys. The Survey of Professional Forecasters for the fourth quarter 
of 2014 showed five-year-ahead inflation expectations of 1.8%, while the level 
of longer-term inflation expectations in the October 2014 Consensus Economics survey was 1.9%. The decline in financial indicators of inflation expectations was 
stronger: in December 2014 the long-term forward inflation-linked swap rate stood at around 1.7%. These developments may have been affected by changes in inflation 
risk premia.1.5 Money and credit developmentsIn an environment of very low interest rates, two developments in 2014 stand out. 
Money growth remained subdued but started to recover, while the contraction in 
credit growth reached a trough.Money growth remained subdued while showing increasing signs of a recoveryBroad money growth in terms of the monetary aggregate M3 remained at subdued levels, but recovered over the course of 2014 (see Chart 17). In December 2014 annual M3 growth stood at 3.8%, compared with 1.0% at the end of 2013. As regards 
 monetary aggregates, two countervailing effects can be distinguished: while weak 

economic activity and investors™ search for yield limited monetary dynamics, the 

ongoing preference for liquidity in an environment of very low interest rates supported money growth. In addition, regulatory changes that encourage banks to increase their reliance on retail deposit-based funding supported M3 growth. Overall, the recovery in broad money growth followed the ECB™s interest rate cuts and the 
adoption of further non-standard monetary policy measures.32Ongoing credit contraction reached a troughCredit developments remained subdued, but the ongoing credit contraction reached a trough in 2014, and a moderate turnaround in loan dynamics was observed, in particular for non-financial corporations. The annual 

growth of MFI credit to euro area residents recovered throughout the year and converged to zero at the end of 2014. The annual rate of change in MFI credit stood at 
-0.1% in December, up from -2.0% in December 2013. 
This increase, which primarily occurred in the second 
half of the year, mainly reflected developments in loans 
to the private sector (see Chart 17) and in credit to general government. It confirms that a broad-based turnaround in loan dynamics occurred around the second quarter of 2014, in particular for non-financial 
corporations. This assessment is further supported by 
the euro area bank lending surveys. They indicate that, 
in addition to stronger loan demand, factors related to 
banks™ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints, 
together with increased competition, contributed to an easing of credit standards for loans both to enterprises and to households for house purchase. While the annual growth rate of loans to households increased gradually, the decline in loans to non-
financial corporations abated significantly over the year. 

This improvement in credit dynamics was significant since, in addition to relatively tight credit standards, weak credit dynamics constituted a constraint for the recovery in the euro area, keeping the degree of slack elevated and acting as a source of downward pressure 
on the medium-term inflation outlook. It was facilitated by improvements in financial market conditions and a sizeable reduction in bank funding costs, not least related to the ECB™s standard and non-standard 
monetary policy measures. International investors also drove M3 dynamicsAn assessment of the counterparts of M3 
 (see Chart 18) shows that during 2014 M3 dynamics 
were driven in particular by the preference of international 
investors for euro area assets. Furthermore, shifts away 
from longer-term financial liabilities supported M3 growth.

33The annual rate of change in MFI longer-term financial liabilities (excluding capital and 
reserves) held by the money-holding sector declined in the course of the year to stand 
at -5.5% in December, compared with -3.3% at the end of 2013. Regarding the other 
counterparts of M3, euro area banks continued to strengthen their capital positions, 
not least in view of the ECB™s comprehensive assessment of the balance sheets of 
significant banks. Finally, the accumulation of net external assets by euro area MFIs 
remained very supportive to M3 growth. In the 12 months to the end of July 2014, the 
net external asset position of euro area MFIs increased by a record amount of •412 

billion, reflecting current account surpluses and a generally strong interest on the part 
of international investors in purchasing euro area securities. Its contribution decreased 
over the remainder of the year, as the preference of investors for acquiring euro area 
securities moderated.The impact of very low interest rates As regards the main components of M3, the very low ECB policy rates and money market interest rates drove the robust annual growth of narrow money (i.e. M1), which stood at 7.9% in December 2014, compared with 5.7% in December 2013  (see Chart 19). The preference of the money-holding sector for the most liquid 

assets, in particular overnight deposits, points to a continued build-up of cash buffers 
in 2014. M1 benefited from the elevated growth of overnight deposits held by both households and non-financial corporations. The low and declining remuneration of 
less liquid monetary assets (see Chart 20) contributed to the ongoing contraction of 
short-term deposits other than overnight deposits (i.e. M2 minus M1), the pace of which started to moderate in May 2014. This recovery was mainly visible in short-
term time deposits. The pace of contraction in marketable instruments (i.e. M3 minus 
M2), which have a relatively small weight in M3, also slowed significantly, in particular

While holdings of short-term debt securities issued by MFIs continued to decline at a rapid pace, the annual growth rate of repurchase agreements and of money market fund shares/units turned positive at the end of 2014. 1.6 Fiscal policy and structural reformsFiscal consolidation slowed down in 2014, in part reflecting the progress achieved in 
past years. To ensure sustainable public finances, further fiscal effort is needed by 
most euro area countries in line with the strengthened fiscal governance framework. Given the weakness of the economic recovery and of the long-term growth potential, it is particularly important for fiscal consolidation to be pursued in a growth-friendly and differentiated manner and for structural reforms to be pursued in a determined 
manner. As also highlighted by the ECB on several occasions in 2014, the fiscal 
governance framework provides sufficient flexibility to account for the short-term 

budgetary costs of major structural reforms. However, progress in structural reforms 
has lost momentum during the past two years, which is a concern given that growth-enhancing structural reforms are crucial to boost productivity, employment and thus 
potential growth in the euro area. Fiscal consolidation slowed down in 2014Although fiscal consolidation continued in the euro area in 2014, its pace slowed notably, partly reflecting 
the progress achieved in past years (see Chart 21). In the December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections, the euro area general government fiscal deficit was projected to have declined from 2.9% of GDP in 2013 to 2.6% of GDP in 2014.
3 This was in line with the European Commission™s winter 2015 
economic forecast. The reduction in the 2014 deficit was mainly due to the cyclical improvement, reflecting in particular higher revenues from indirect taxes as a result of stronger private consumption, while structural fiscal adjustment had come to a standstill. Thus, the fiscal policy stance, as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, was broadly neutral in 2014.General government debt in the euro area continued to increase in 2014. According to the December 2014 
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the 
debt level reached 92% of GDP in 2014, up from 91%

35of GDP in 2013. This increase reflects high interest 
expenditure and the debt-increasing impact of the deficit-debt adjustment, which was largely related to financial sector support. These two factors were only 
partly offset by a small primary surplus and higher 
economic growth (see Chart 22). Another factor explaining changes in fiscal data is the transition to the new European System of Accounts 
2010 (ESA 2010). Its impact was limited for the deficit, 
but more pronounced for the debt figures. For 2013 
the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio was reduced by 0.2 
percentage point for the euro area as a whole, while the debt ratio was lowered by 1.6 percentage points, largely on account of an upward revision of the GDP 
denominator. For some euro area countries, the impact 

of the transition to the ESA 2010 was more pronounced, 
namely for Ireland, Luxembourg and Cyprus.4Progress in fiscal consolidation varied across countriesAt the country level, progress in fiscal consolidation was evident from the increasing number of countries exiting their excessive deficit procedures (EDPs). In recent years, first Finland, then Germany, Italy and Latvia have achieved a sustainable 
correction of their excessive deficits. This positive trend continued in 2014 with the 
EDP being abrogated for Belgium, Austria and Slovakia (which had deadlines to 
correct their excessive deficits by 2013), as well as for the Netherlands, one year ahead of its deadline. Moreover, Malta is expected to have achieved a correction of 
its excessive deficit by its 2014 deadline.More fiscal effort is needed
Nevertheless, it became clear in 2014 that in several countries the fiscal effort was 

insufficient to ensure compliance with the EDP requirements. In fact, on the basis of 
the European Commission™s winter 2015 forecast, a few countries were seen to be 

at risk of not meeting their annual EDP targets for 2014 and beyond, even though 
the targets had been loosened following the past EDP deadline extensions for a 

number of countries. To foster compliance with the requirements of the Stability and 
Growth Pact, the European Commission made use in 2014 of its new powers under the EU™s strengthened economic governance framework
5 and on 5 March 2014 issued autonomous recommendations to France and Slovenia, in which it requested the necessary measures to correct the excessive deficits by the 2015 deadlines. On 4 See the box entitled ﬁThe impact of the European System of Accounts 2010 on euro area macroeconomic 
statisticsﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, November 2014.5 Article 11(2) of Regulation (EU) 473/2013 (ﬁtwo-packﬂ regulation).

362 June the Commission said that it considered France to have broadly responded and Slovenia to have partially responded to the autonomous recommendations. In addition, in the fiscal-related country-specific recommendations (CSRs) adopted in July 2014 by the ECOFIN Council, most euro area countries were asked to reinforce their budgetary strategies in 2014 and to ensure in their budgetary plans for 2015 compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. In mid-October 2014 the euro area countries that were not subject to an EU-IMF financial assistance programme submitted their draft budgetary plans. In its opinions published on 28 November, the 
Commission judged that the draft budgetary plans of seven countries posed a risk of non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. This group comprises France, 

Spain, Malta and Portugal, which are still subject to an EDP, as well as Italy, Belgium 
and Austria, which exited their EDPs in 2012 or later. For Belgium, France and Italy, 
the Commission announced detailed follow-up assessments in early 2015.6 Only five draft budgets were regarded as compliant and four draft budgets as broadly compliant with the Pact. In its follow-up assessments published on 27 February 2015, however, the Commission decided not to step up the EDP for France and concluded that Italy and Belgium were found compliant with the preventive arm requirements and the debt rule.7Fiscal consolidation should be growth-friendly Given the slow pace of the economic recovery in 2014, it is very important to support 
the recovery through a growth-friendly fiscal adjustment. This is particularly relevant 
for those countries that have no fiscal space and need to increase their fiscal efforts. To this end, cutting unproductive spending can free up funds to preserve 
productive spending. Reform efforts on the revenue side should focus on addressing 
the distortionary impact of taxation as well as tax evasion. A key focus here is on 
reducing the high tax wedges in some countries. Against this background, the 
Eurogroup in September 2014 agreed on a set of common principles which should 
guide future tax reforms.8The Stability and Growth Pact provides sufficient flexibility
As also confirmed by the European Council at its June 2014 meeting, the existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pact provide sufficient flexibility to account for 
adverse economic developments and the short-term budgetary costs of major structural reforms, such as pension reforms. On 13 January 2015 the European Commission issued a communication which clarifies and extends the flexibility in applying the rules of the Pact in three major areas, namely the treatment of structural 6 For more information, see the Commission opinions published on 28 November 2014.
7 See the Commission reports published on 27 February 2015.
8 See the Eurogroup statement published on 12 September 2014.37reforms, investment and cyclical conditions.9 The available flexibility within the Pact must be used in a prudent manner, as highlighted by the ECB on several occasions (see Box 4).10Box 4Changes in the fiscal and macroeconomic governance frameworkIn response to the financial and economic crisis, the EU governance framework was strengthened in 2011 and 2013 with a view to helping restore confidence in public finances, through the ﬁsix-
packﬂ, the fiscal compact and the ﬁtwo-packﬂ regulations. In November 2014 the European Commission reviewed the effectiveness of the changes made to parts of the governance 
framework. The review was mainly backward-looking and found that, overall, the procedures 

worked properly. 
Generally, the reformed governance framework has proved to be very important as it has helped 
to foster countries™ fiscal consolidation efforts, to better identify macroeconomic imbalances and 
to provide country-specific recommendations. Nevertheless, as also highlighted by the European 
Commission in its review, its implementation needs to be strengthened, as consolidation efforts 
remain uneven across Member States and the identification of macroeconomic imbalances 
has not led to an appropriate use of the tools provided in the macroeconomic imbalance procedure to correct these imbalances. Furthermore, the implementation of the country-specific 
recommendations remains unsatisfactory. 
On the fiscal side, the Commission™s review confirmed that the Stability and Growth Pact has 
acted as an anchor of confidence and the strengthened fiscal governance framework has provided sound guidance for the Member States™ conduct of fiscal policies, with a focus on preserving 

fiscal sustainability. It is crucial that the rules of the Pact are applied in a consistent manner. This 
is essential to preserve the credibility of the new governance framework and effectively prevent 
the re-emergence of fiscal imbalances. The national fiscal councils which many countries have 
established in recent years and the transposition of the fiscal compact into national legislation are expected to play a key role in this respect. They can help in achieving better fiscal discipline 
and increasing national ownership of EU fiscal rules (for more details, see the box entitled ﬁFiscal councils in EU countriesﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, June 2014).As regards macroeconomic developments and economic structures, the macroeconomic 
imbalance procedure has been a valuable tool to identify imbalances and their degree of severity. 

It is important that this procedure is implemented in a more consistent and transparent manner, 
in particular by making full use of the excessive imbalance procedure in cases where excessive imbalances are identified. The European Commission called for contributions to its mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy through a public consultation. The Eurosystem, in its 
contribution, stressed that the 9 For an assessment, see the box entitled ﬁFlexibility within the Stability and Growth Pactﬂ, 
Economic Bulletin, Issue 1/2015, ECB.10 See, for example, Mario Draghi, 
ﬁRecovery and reform in the euro areaﬂ
, speech delivered at the 
Brookings Institution, 9 October 2014.38Europe 2020 strategy should focus on reforms that have an impact on potential growth and create employment, such as structural reforms in labour and product markets as well as reforms affecting overall business conditions. The contribution also underlined that the successful implementation of this reform agenda is dependent on the full, strict and consistent implementation of the strengthened economic governance framework.In the longer term, and given that structural reforms are not only in a country™s own interest but 
also in the interest of the euro area as a whole, EU governance of structural reforms should be further strengthened to help countries to improve competitiveness, productivity, employment and 
resilience within the euro area. Looking ahead, this could involve a move from rules to institutions and from coordination to joint decision-making. The forthcoming report by the President of the 
European Commission, in close cooperation with the President of the Euro Summit, the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the ECB, on next steps on better economic governance 
in the euro area will be a key starting point for further reflection on these matters, as evidenced by the Analytical Note prepared by the four Presidents and circulated to the Heads of State or 
Government. Progress in structural reforms has lost momentum since 2013Progress in structural reforms has lost momentum during the past two years, which 
is a concern given that growth-enhancing structural reforms are crucial to boost productivity, employment and thus potential growth in the euro area. While the 
need to make progress on structural reforms varies across countries, according to their level of imbalances and vulnerabilities, most euro area countries are still characterised by significant rigidities in labour and product markets. The push for 
reform was relatively strong in 2011-13 in countries that were subject to financial 
assistance programmes, while it was much more limited in the other countries, in 
particular during 2013 following the significant reduction of financial market pressures in stressed non-programme countries. Since the end of 2013 reform progress has lost further momentum across most euro area countries, against the background of the winding-up of assistance programmes, a buoyant financial market environment, reform fatigue and electoral cycle considerations (see Box 4). Notwithstanding a 
number of policies and measures that go in the right direction, euro area countries have fallen substantially short in implementing reforms. In some cases, measures actually go in the wrong direction, and past reforms have been watered down or 
reversed. Reform recommendations not fully addressedDuring 2014 the implementation of the CSRs continued to be relatively disappointing. 
According to the European Commission, only some or limited progress has been observed on the reform recommendations issued to euro area countries that were 39not subject to assistance programmes (see Table 1). None of the euro area countries 
has fully addressed any of the 2014 recommendations. While reform efforts have 
been stepped up in some countries (in Slovenia, in particular, substantial progress 
has been made in three out of the eight CSRs), in the majority of countries progress has been rather limited and not commensurate with the remaining vulnerabilities. Continued reform effort remains important in all countries. In particular, decisive 
action is needed in the euro area countries identified by the European Commission in February 2015 as having excessive imbalances, i.e. France, Italy and Portugal, 
and in the other euro area countries under specific monitoring by the Commission in 2014, i.e. Spain, Ireland and Slovenia.11The significant slowdown of reform efforts in euro area countries was confirmed by 
the OECD in its 2015 ﬁGoing for Growthﬂ report. In particular, reform activity was 
found to remain weak in the less vulnerable euro area countries and to be declining in the more vulnerable euro area countries. The timid reform progress stood in stark 
contrast to the still very large challenges and structural problems existing in most euro area countries. Compared with 2008, sovereign and private debt levels, as well as unemployment rates Œ especially for the young and long-term unemployed Œ were significantly higher in 2014. Investment as a share of GDP continued to disappoint 

and the long-term potential growth outlook was much lower in 2014 than six years earlier. The higher stock of debt and weaker growth outlook implied that it would be 
very challenging to reabsorb the employment losses within a reasonable time frame without a major impulse for reforms.11 See Results of in-depth reviews under Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 on the prevention and correction 
of macroeconomic imbalances, European Commission, 25 February 2015.Table 1

Substantial progress: the Member State has adopted measures, most of which have been implemented. These measures go a long way towards addressing the CSR. Fully

40Looking beyond 2014, the implementation of credible and decisive growth-enhancing structural reforms is criticalLooking ahead, in order to tackle the major structural bottlenecks which still existed in 2014, credible and decisive growth-enhancing reforms are more important than ever.
12 The call to strengthen the reform effort is a call for high sustainable growth. This is indispensable to bring the unemployment rate back to lower levels and to 
support debt sustainability. In terms of the sequencing of reforms, policies which have the capacity to increase expected potential growth and confidence, especially reforms of product markets and framework conditions, are particularly urgent. Special attention should be given to reforms which decisively tackle the still very large number of bottlenecks in framework and business environment conditions and in areas such as public (and tax) administration, judicial systems, excessive rents in 
sectors sheltered from competition and distortions in labour markets, such as nominal 
rigidities (e.g. limited wage adjustment) and real rigidities (e.g. segmentation). There are still too many bottlenecks in the business environment, for example excessive bureaucracy, which hinder an efficient allocation of resources and prevent 
a swifter recovery of private investment. Private investment is also being hampered by insufficient corporate debt restructuring tools and insolvency laws. Despite 
some progress in certain countries in 2014, policy measures in this area need to be stepped up further to facilitate the deleveraging process of firms (and households). Moreover, measures related to increasing competition in sheltered services sectors 
continue to be very difficult to implement, and many countries need to take significant 

policy action to increase competition by allowing new and often more productive and innovative firms to enter these markets. If reforms are credible and frontloaded, the positive impact on confidence, investment, job creation and growth will in general be much larger than possible negative impacts from short-term downward price pressures. There is at present no compelling evidence of large short-term costs stemming from reforms.13 In fact, the crisis has clearly shown that there is no alternative to structural reforms to lift growth and that postponing difficult decisions 
will only increase the cost of adjustment later on. A coherent, comprehensive and credible strategy for reforms is crucial not only to maximise the long-term benefits of reforms, but also to share the burden of the adjustment in an equitable manner. 12 See Benoît Cœuré, ﬁStructural reforms: learning the right lessons from the crisisﬂ, keynote speech at the

European Commission, 2014.412  Expanding the toolbox: monetary policy at the effective 
lower bound for key ECB interest ratesAgainst the backdrop of a subdued inflation outlook coupled with weak growth momentum, the Eurosystem has adopted a number of major additional monetary policy measures since June 2014. The policy package introduced in 2014 included three main elements: reducing the key ECB interest rates to the effective lower bound; introducing a series of 
targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs); and launching two purchase 
programmes for selected private sector assets. The package aimed to restore 
the normal transmission of monetary policy as well as to provide further monetary accommodation, thereby supporting lending to the real economy and the euro area recovery in order to maintain price stability over the medium term.The measures adopted in 2014 led to a further considerable easing of the effective 
monetary policy stance, with the liquidity injections via the TLTROs and asset 

purchase programmes set to reach their full scale over the subsequent quarters. 
In this context, the Governing Council communicated its intention to sizeably increase the Eurosystem™s balance sheet in order to provide a sufficient degree of 
monetary stimulus to raise annual HICP inflation rates to levels below, but close 
to, 2%. Moreover, the Governing Council remained unanimous in its commitment to 
using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate, should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation.In line with this commitment, in early 2015 the Governing Council conducted a thorough reassessment of the outlook for price developments and of the monetary stimulus achieved so far. It concluded that the medium-term inflation outlook had 

weakened, and that the monetary policy measures decided since June 2014, while generating a satisfactory pass-through of the amount of liquidity injected to private sector borrowing costs, did not result in a sufficient quantity of liquidity. 
The Governing Council judged the prevailing degree of monetary accommodation to be insufficient to adequately address heightened risks of too prolonged a period of 
low inflation. Therefore, at its meeting on
 22 January 2015, the Governing Council decided to launch an expanded asset purchase programme and to change the 
pricing of the six remaining TLTROs.142.1 The monetary policy environment required decisive 
 ECB actionIn 2014 the Eurosystem conducted its monetary policy in an environment which 

was challenging, with the economic recovery remaining weak, inflation gradually 
decreasing, monetary and credit dynamics remaining subdued and monetary policy 
transmission still being impaired.14 For details, see the box entitled ﬁThe Governing Council™s expanded asset purchase programmeﬂ, 
Economic Bulletin, Issue 1/2015, ECB.42As described in detail in Section 1 of Chapter 1, the gradual economic recovery that took hold over the second half of 2013 continued in early 2014. However, towards 
mid-2014 the euro area recovery showed signs of a loss in momentum, as weaker domestic demand, together with increased geopolitical tensions and insufficient 
implementation of structural reforms in some euro area countries, negatively affected 
economic conditions. While certain temporary factors related to calendar effects 
and weather conditions also contributed to the weakness, high unemployment and sluggish investment behaviour continued to be a drag on economic dynamism. 
In 2014 as a whole, real GDP increased by
 0.9%.As discussed above, headline inflation rates were low and declined in the course of 
the year, with average annual HICP inflation in
 2014 standing at 0.4%. The decline in 
HICP inflation was mainly driven by developments in energy and food prices, as well 
as Œ during the first few months of the year Œ the impact of contemporaneous and 
past exchange rate appreciation. HICP inflation excluding energy and food was also 
subdued, pointing to weakness in broad aggregate demand. Continuously low inflation 

and sharply declining energy prices affected inflation expectations. The dampening 
impact was particularly strong for short-term inflation expectations, which moved in 
tandem with the fall in headline inflation. From the summer of 2014 medium to long-term inflation expectations also began to decline visibly.
As already noted, euro area monetary and credit dynamics were still weak in 2014, although both showed signs of a recovery in the course of the year. While M3 growth 
was supported by higher M1 growth reflecting an ongoing preference for liquidity in an environment of low interest rates, the slow pace of the economic expansion limited monetary dynamics. Credit developments were subdued, despite the first signs of a turnaround reflecting the broad easing in borrowing conditions for euro area MFIs. Loans to the private 
sector contracted, as positive flows of credit to households were more than offset 
by still negative flows of credit to non-financial corporations. Credit conditions for households and firms remained tight, especially in some euro area countries, as improvements in financial conditions and Œ in particular Œ past monetary policy impulses were transmitted only imperfectly to private borrowing costs. As a result, 
bank lending rates were less responsive to policy changes, and remained relatively high despite the ECB™s accommodative monetary policy stance. Restrictive borrowing 

conditions in some countries suppressed aggregate demand and contributed to economic weakness. Weak credit dynamics constrained the recovery in the euro 
area, thus exerting downward pressure on the medium-term inflation outlook. Although financial market sentiment improved over the course of the year, there 
were occasional bouts of volatility. In addition, financial market fragmentation, while 
continuing to recede, remained elevated. As a result, significant heterogeneity 
persisted in financing conditions for households and firms across euro area countries. 

However, the monetary policy measures undertaken by the ECB were successful 
in contributing to an easing of constraints on bank funding. The completion of the 
ECB™s comprehensive assessment in October, and the related strengthening of bank 
balance sheets and access to market funding, is also expected to further ease bank funding conditions and banks™ willingness to lend.
43Against this backdrop of a deteriorating inflation outlook, weak growth momentum, 
subdued monetary and credit dynamics and still impaired monetary policy transmission, 
the Governing Council has adopted a comprehensive package of measures since 
June 2014. This package aims to enhance the transmission of monetary policy as well 
as to provide further monetary accommodation. In particular, by bringing the average 
borrowing costs for households and firms down to levels that are more consistent with 
the intended policy stance, the measures support lending to the real economy. Moreover, 
they are in line with the Governing Council™s forward guidance on the key ECB interest 

rates, contributing to the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.2.2 The June-October monetary policy package 
The policy package introduced between June and October included three main elements: 

reducing the key ECB interest rates to the effective lower bound; introducing a series of 
TLTROs; and launching two purchase programmes for selected private sector assets. 
The measures were designed to have a significant impact on credit conditions for 
households and firms in the euro area. They were also aimed at supporting the anchoring 
of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with the Governing Council™s 
price stability objective. In addition, the measures reflected significant and increasing 
differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies.
Key ECB interest rates reached the effective lower bound
Key ECB interest rates were reduced to the effective 
lower bound. The interest rate on the main refinancing 
operations (MROs) of the Eurosystem and the rate on 
the deposit facility were lowered in two steps by a total 
of 20 basis points, to 0.05% and -0.20% respectively, 
while the rate on the marginal lending facility was reduced 
in two steps by a total of 45 basis points, to 0.30% 
(see Chart 23). The cut in policy rates was in line with the 

Governing Council™s forward guidance.
15Moving the deposit facility rate into negative territory 
strengthened the impact of the reduction in the MRO rate and helped maintain the width of the interest rate corridor, providing an incentive for banks to trade 
in interbank markets, which is a precondition for satisfactory market functioning, market-driven price discovery and effective market discipline. Accordingly, 
the rate cut had a sizeable impact on spot as well as forward money market rates, while turnover in very short-term money markets remained largely unchanged. 15 For details, see the box entitled ﬁThe Governing Council™s forward guidance on the key ECB

44The implementation of the decision to introduce negative deposit rates proceeded smoothly, while some adjustments to the remuneration of certain Eurosystem 
balances were required, as shifts in holdings between accounts could otherwise have undermined the negative rate policy. In particular, the ECB made sure that the 
negative rate also applied to average reserve holdings in excess of the minimum reserve requirements and certain other deposits held with the Eurosystem, as detailed in a press release on 5 June 2014.Targeted longer-term refinancing operations provide better access 
to creditA series of TLTROs was 
announced on 5 June 2014 and aimed to improve bank lending to the euro area non-financial private sector. TLTROs provide long-term funding at attractive terms and conditions over a period of up to four years for all banks that meet certain benchmarks applicable to their lending to the real economy. The choice of this measure reflected the predominantly bank-based financing structure of the euro area economy and the significance of weak bank lending as a factor holding back the recovery. By providing incentives for lending to the real economy, the TLTROs were aimed at enhancing monetary policy transmission. 
Improved funding conditions for banks should contribute to easing credit conditions and stimulating credit creation. A key feature of the TLTROs is that the amount that a bank is entitled to borrow 
depends on its lending behaviour. Banks were entitled to an initial borrowing 
allowance equal to 7% of the total amount of their loans to the euro area  non-financial private sector as at 30 April 2014, excluding loans to households for house purchase. Banks had the option of drawing on their initial allowance in the first 
two operations in September and December 2014. Thereafter, between March
 2015 and June 2016, all counterparties will have the 
option to borrow additional amounts in further TLTROs, depending on the evolution 
of their eligible lending activities in excess of bank-specific benchmarks16. The more 
banks have lent beyond the benchmark, the more they will be allowed to borrow. This 

incentive is amplified by the use of a multiplier, with banks being able to borrow up to 
three times the difference Œ if positive Œ between their net lending and the benchmark. 
16 The benchmarks are determined by taking into account each counterparty™s net lending to the euro 
area non-financial private sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase, recorded in the 

12-month period up to 30 April 2014. The Governing Council decided that for banks that exhibited 

positive eligible net lending in the 12-month period to 30 April 2014, the benchmarks are always set at 

zero, and for banks that exhibited negative eligible net lending in the year to 30 April 2014, benchmarks 

are set as follows: the average monthly net lending of each bank in the year to 30 April 2014 is 

extrapolated for 12 months until 30 April 2015, while for the year from 30 April 2015 to 30 April 2016, the 

benchmark monthly net lending is set at zero.45The interest rate on the TLTROs is fixed over the life of each operation. For the first 
two TLTROs the rate was set at the rate on the Eurosystem™s MROs prevailing at 
the time of take-up, plus a fixed spread of 10 basis points. In order to support the effectiveness of the operations, in January
 2015 the Governing Council decided to eliminate the fixed spread of 10 basis points for the TLTROs to be conducted 
between March 2015 and June 2016. To ensure that the funds offered to banks are 
used to support an increase in lending, any counterparties that do not fulfil certain conditions regarding the volume of their net lending to the real economy would be 
required to pay back the borrowed amounts in September 2016, two years earlier than the TLTRO maturity. All TLTROs will mature in September
 2018.The combination of low long-term refinancing rates and positive incentives to lend (as well as negative consequences for not lending) should push up loan supply, 
forcing lending rates down. The TLTROs are therefore designed to encourage 
the passing-on of favourable lending conditions related to the ECB™s interest rate 
decisions to private sector borrowers. The combined take-up in the first two operations was •212.4 billion (•82.6 billion in September and •129.8 billion in December). A total of
 469 counterparties participated 
in the operations. Banks that were interested in participating but lacked the relevant loan book were allowed to team up with banks that did hold such loans by forming TLTRO groups. In this way, the operations in fact reached
 1,223 credit institutions. Overall, participation was broadly based across the euro area.17The borrowing allowance in the first two operations for each counterparty was 
calculated in advance, based on information submitted by counterparties regarding 
the amount of eligible loans they held on their books in April
 2014. Banks submitted 
templates specifying their eligible loans for an amount that gave rise to an initial 
allowance of •266.5 billion. This compares with a theoretical allowance of about 
•385 billion that could have been drawn if all banks with eligible loans had 
submitted templates.The TLTROs had a number of attractive features for banks. First, the price and 
maturity incentives embedded in the operations were, for many, favourable compared 
with market conditions. In particular, TLTRO funds in
 2014 could be obtained at 
the prevailing MRO rate of 5 basis points plus a margin of 10 basis points. On the settlement day of the second TLTRO, the take-up in both operations had extended 
the average maturity of outstanding Eurosystem refinancing to almost one and a half years (assuming the TLTRO amounts are kept for four years), from less than 
four months just before the settlement of the first TLTRO. At the end of
 2014 the 
average maturity of the operations stood slightly lower, at one year and four months. 
Second, banks that were less interested in participating as a result of their already comfortable funding situation reported that participation could benefit their corporate image, as they would be seen to be participating in an operation aimed at supporting the real economy. Third, by passing on the cheaper funding costs to their lending 
conditions, banks could improve their competitive position on the loan market.17 For a discussion of the results of the first TLTRO, see the box entitled ﬁThe targeted longer-term 
refinancing operation of September 2014ﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, October 2014.46The TLTROs contributed to the easing of financial market conditions, and the 
operations to be conducted between March 2015 and June 2016 will further ease the monetary policy stance and support credit creation.Private sector asset purchase programmes aim to ease credit conditions in the economyThe two private sector asset purchase programmes Œ an asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP) and a new covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) Œ were designed to permit selective intervention in markets where the pass-through to the borrowing conditions of the non-financial private sector in the euro area is high. They therefore complement the TLTROs in addressing weak credit 
conditions and enhancing monetary policy transmission. Under the ABSPP, the Eurosystem began purchasing simple and transparent 
asset-backed securities (ABSs) with underlying assets consisting of claims against the euro area non-financial private sector. Under CBPP3, the Eurosystem started 
purchasing euro-denominated covered bonds issued by MFIs domiciled in the euro 
area. The Governing Council announced that it expected these two asset purchase 
programmes to last for at least two years. The decision to purchase simple and transparent ABSs reflects the role of this 
market in facilitating new credit flows to the economy. In particular, the link between 
the interest rate spreads at which ABSs are traded and the lending rates which 
banks apply on the underlying credits is tight. As the European ABS market remains 
impaired, the potential for interventions to change dynamics in this market is high. 
The Eurosystem™s purchases thus strengthen the direct pass-through effect of the 
TLTROs, i.e. the extent to which the funding cost relief for banks is passed along to 
households and firms in the euro area. The reduction of spreads for ABSs creates 
arbitrage opportunities for banks, encouraging them to create ABSs and thereby 
increase loan supply, forcing lending rates down. 
In respect of covered bonds the link on the issuing bank™s balance sheet between 
the covered bond, on the one side, and the underlying loans, on the other side, is reasonably tight. As the prices for covered bonds are bid up, banks are expected to 
respond to the market incentives by creating more saleable covered securities,  and thus more loans to collateralise them. CBPP3 therefore further complements the TLTROs and the ABS purchases. Furthermore, outright interventions in the market 
for covered bonds have reinforced the portfolio rebalancing channel of transmission. The expansion in liquidity resulting from the combined outright operations has promoted a diversification of investment patterns and has thereby led to an easing  of financing conditions more broadly. 
47Implementation of asset purchase programmes under wayUnder the ABSPP, the Eurosystem started its purchases on
 21 November 2014 and had settled •1.7 billion of eligible securities by the end of the year (see Table
 2).  The purchase volumes depend on several factors, including the overall size of the market and its evolution, but also on considerations related to limiting the crowding-out of private investors from the market. The relatively limited purchase volumes 
during 2014 also reflect the fact that the purchases started just before the seasonal slowdown of market activity in December. However, the announcement of the ABSPP 
and its implementation led to a visible decline in ABS spreads, with price adjustments 

particularly pronounced in those market segments where the Eurosystem intervened directly.
Given the heterogeneous and broad nature of the euro area ABS market, 
the Governing Council considered that, in order to maximise the effectiveness 
of the ABSPP, it was appropriate to rely on four external asset managers, which 
complement each other within their respective areas of specialisation and expertise. 
In December 2014 the Banque de France took on the role of internal asset manager 

and started purchasing ABSs alongside the external asset managers. The role of the 
appointed asset managers is to conduct the ABS purchase transactions on explicit 
instructions from, and on behalf of, the Eurosystem, which undertakes price checks 

and due diligence prior to approving the transactions. The purchases across different 
segments of eligible euro area ABSs are allocated by the ECB to the different asset 
managers, taking into account their respective areas of specialisation. Once the 
Eurosystem has further developed its technical capabilities and expertise, it intends to 
take over the implementation of the ABSPP from the external asset managers. 
Under CBPP3, the Eurosystem started making 
purchases on 20 October 2014, and the book value of bonds settled stood at •29.6 billion at the end of 2014 (see Table
 2). The start of CBPP3 was smooth and 
effective. Purchases were made in a broad range of 
countries and in line with the targeted amount. The 
purchases are in principle conducted by the entire Eurosystem, while some specialisation has been applied for efficiency reasons. As was the case for the 
CBPP and CBPP2, the CBPP3 portfolio is available for securities lending. As with the 
ABSPP, the
 announcement of CBPP3 and its implementation led to a visible decline in spreads on the relevant assets. Purchases under both programmes are conducted on both the primary and secondary markets. In 2014 18% of covered bonds and 10% of ABSs were 

purchased on the primary market. The positive impact of the CBPP3 and ABSPP programmes on the respective 
markets was most visible directly after the announcement on 4 September and the publication of operational details on 2 October, when credit spreads tightened 
significantly, especially for securities issued in the more stressed jurisdictions. The

covered bonds weakened somewhat, owing to the relatively low spread levels, leading to a small increase in credit spreads. For each of the two programmes, the amounts outstanding, weekly settled amounts and weekly redemptions are disclosed separately on the ECB™s website and 
commented on in the Eurosystem™s 
weekly financial statements. In addition, the ECB publishes information on its website with regard to the split between primary and 
secondary market purchases on a monthly basis for CBPP3. Eligibility of assets for purchase programmesRegarding the eligibility of assets for purchase, the Eurosystem collateral framework is the guiding principle, with some adjustments to take into account the difference 
between accepting assets as collateral and buying assets outright. To ensure that 
the programmes can include assets from the whole euro area, ABSs and covered 
bonds from Greece and Cyprus, currently not eligible as collateral for monetary policy operations, are subject to specific rules with risk-mitigating measures.18In the case of CBPP3, the covered bonds need to fulfil the conditions for their 
acceptance as own-used collateral and some other requirements detailed in Article 2 of Decision ECB/2014/40. Entities suspended from Eurosystem credit operations are also excluded from purchases under CBPP3 for the duration of their suspension. Additionally, some limits apply to the holdings per security. As regards the ABSPP, the securities need to fulfil the additional requirements 
detailed in Article
 2 of Decision ECB/2014/45. In addition, the ECB conducts a credit risk assessment and due diligence in relation to such ABSs prior to their purchase and on an ongoing basis. Furthermore, some limits apply to the holdings per security. 2.3 ECB refinancing operations and liquidity developments
The Eurosystem continued to offer ample liquidity by means of the full allotment 
procedure in its regular refinancing operations, i.e. the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs). 

Consequently, and as in previous years since
 2008, the size of outstanding refinancing operations was determined by counterparties™ demand for Eurosystem 

liquidity. In order to continue to accommodate banks™ demand for central bank 
liquidity, the Governing Council decided as part of the June policy package to extend 
the full allotment policy in MROs and LTROs at least until December
 2016. Banks continued to make substantial use of the repayment option associated with the two three-year LTROs, repaying a total amount of •334
 billion in 2014, i.e. an 18 For more details, see Article 2(5) of 
Decision ECB/2014/40 of 15 October 2014 on the implementation 
of the third covered bond purchase programme
 and Article 2(8) of Decision ECB/2014/45 of 
19 November 2014 on the implementation of the asset-backed securities purchase programme.49average weekly repayment of •6.7 billion. In the context of overall rather stable liquidity needs in the strict sense, i.e. as determined by reserve requirements and autonomous factors19, the repayments led to a gradual but substantial decline in excess liquidity and in the Eurosystem™s balance sheet over the course of 2014 
(see Chart 24). The repayments were motivated by various factors, including the improvement in access to funding markets and more stable sources of funding, the tendency to reduce excess reserves held for precautionary reasons, and the process of balance sheet adjustment and deleveraging. In addition, repayments may also have been supported by the decline in the regulatory value of the funding once the maturity of the three-year LTROs fell below one year. Finally, 
repayments were also supported by the fact that banks turned instead to shorter-term Eurosystem operations, in order to manage liquidity more actively, or to the TLTROs. Indeed, repayments spiked ahead of the two TLTRO operations: to •19.9 billion on 24 September 2014 and to •39.8 billion on 17 December 2014. In June 2014 the weekly fine-tuning operations that had been conducted to absorb the liquidity injected by the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) were suspended. This measure, which was part of the June-October monetary policy package, led to an initial increase in the level of excess liquidity. Immediately after the suspension, 
excess liquidity increased to •160 billion on 18 June, from •122 billion the day before. 19 Autonomous factors are those items on the Eurosystem™s balance sheet, such as banknotes in 
circulation and government deposits, which have an impact on credit institutions™ current account 
holdings, but are not under the direct control of the ECB™s liquidity management function.Chart 24Eurosystem liquidity-providing and liquidity-absorbing operations since 2007(EUR billions)-1,200-1,000-800

that the liquidity that was no longer being absorbed by fine-tuning operations was offset by lower participation in other Eurosystem refinancing operations. Banks 
accelerated the repayment of three-year LTRO funds and reduced their recourse to 
the MROs. However, cash-rich banks that had regularly participated in the liquidity-
absorbing operations could not place all of their excess funds and saw a net increase in their current account and deposit facility holdings, which limited the decrease in excess liquidity. The fact that these banks apparently did not lend their excess 

holdings out to other counterparties is indicative of the continued presence of market fragmentation. At the same time, liquidity needs rose owing to higher autonomous 
factors, which resulted in a drag on excess liquidity. By
 10 July excess liquidity had returned to the levels seen just before the suspension of the weekly liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operations. In addition, the impact of the TLTRO allotments on liquidity provision depends on the 
extent to which banks change their participation in other Eurosystem credit operations 

settled during the same week by way of substitution. At the time of settlement, the 
September and December operations injected •47.9 billion and •95.3 billion in net 
terms respectively, as banks repaid three-year LTRO holdings and changed the 
amount of their participation in the relevant MRO and three-month LTRO. 
Overall, participation in regular Eurosystem refinancing operations was comparable 
in size with that in the previous year, although somewhat more volatile. The fact that 
the suspension of fine-tuning operations and the launch of new operations such as 
the TLTROs were largely offset by three-year LTRO repayments contributed to the 
overall stability of the regular operations. In particular, recourse to the MROs averaged 

•110
 billion in 2014, broadly unchanged from •108 billion in 2013. Recourse to the 
individual MROs fluctuated strongly between •82 billion and •174 billion in 2014. 
The average take-up of the three-month LTROs increased compared with the previous 
year, with •11
 billion allotted on average, compared with •7.2 billion in 2013. 
Taking all Eurosystem open market operations (excluding outright monetary 
policy portfolios) together, the amount of liquidity provided decreased from about 
•650 billion to around •600 billion at the end of 2014, even briefly dipping below •500 billion at the beginning of December (see Chart 24). This decrease was in line 
with the trend observed during the previous years. Consequently, excess liquidity 

averaged •129 billion in 2014, well below the •300 billion recorded in 2013. In the second half of 2014 the level of excess liquidity was supported by the new measures and varied from around •70 billion to •260 billion at the end of 2014. The capacity 
for further liquidity absorption remained high at the end of 2014, as •210 billion of three-year LTRO funding was still outstanding. However, further TLTROs and asset 

purchases are expected to raise the level of excess liquidity in 2015. Protection of the Eurosystem™s balance sheet
In the implementation of monetary policy, the Eurosystem conducts credit operations 

with counterparties fulfilling certain eligibility criteria defined in the ﬁGeneral Documentationﬂ on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures. 51Although the eligibility criteria require such counterparties to be financially sound, the Eurosystem may still be exposed to the risk of unexpected counterparty defaults. This risk is mitigated by requiring counterparties to submit adequate collateral, in line with the standard practice of central banks worldwide. In 2014 the Eurosystem continued to ensure that sufficient collateral was available 
to a wide set of counterparties, so that the Eurosystem could provide the appropriate amount of liquidity in its monetary policy operations.20 Moreover, the financial risks related to liquidity-providing operations were continuously monitored and quantified 
at the Eurosystem level and reported to the ECB™s decision-making bodies on a regular basis. In the course of 2014 the Eurosystem adopted several measures to enhance its eligibility criteria and the risk control framework that protects it against the risk of financial loss if assets have to be realised owing to the default of a counterparty. 
For example, the Governing Council further refined the loan-level data requirements for ABSs. In addition, the rules for assigning the appropriate rating to determine the 
eligibility of marketable assets and their related haircut were modified. As regards 
the temporary collateral framework, the Governing Council adopted Guideline ECB/2014/31, which recasts Guideline ECB/2013/4 in the interest of clarity and allows the inclusion, in the additional credit claims framework, of certain short-term debt instruments issued by non-financial corporations that would otherwise not satisfy the Eurosystem eligibility criteria for marketable assets, provided that they 
comply with a number of specific criteria. 2.4 Communication on the Eurosystem™s balance sheet
The Governing Council communicated that its monetary policy measures Œ both 
lending operations and asset purchases Œ would have a sizeable impact on the Eurosystem™s balance sheet. 
This communication was aimed at addressing uncertainty about the overall scale of the measures. The uncertainty arose because a key element of the June-October 
package Œ the volume of TLTROs Œ will largely be determined by the demand from 
the Eurosystem™s counterparties, i.e. the decisions by individual banks to participate 
in the operations. Therefore, while each unit of liquidity introduced through the 
June-October monetary policy measures has a lasting credit-easing impact, the total amount of stimulus injected could not be anticipated precisely. 
Thus, the communication on the balance sheet size reflected the Governing Council™s 
intention to ensure that the degree of monetary stimulus would prove appropriate to 
raise annual HICP inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2%. However, the size 
of the Eurosystem™s balance sheet is not a target of monetary policy. Rather, active 
balance sheet management remains an instrument employed in pursuit of the ECB™s 
price stability mandate once the effective lower bound for very short-term nominal 
interest rates has been reached. 20 Detailed information on eligible marketable assets as well as on the use of collateral and outstanding 
credit is published on the ECB™s website.523 Repair and confidence-building: the European financial 
sectorThe ECB™s activities in
 2014 included its substantial contribution to strengthening the stability of and building confidence in the European financial sector. In this 
context, the ECB undertook a series of actions, including regularly assessing emerging risks and the resilience and shock-absorbing capacity of the financial system; analysing the links between the financial system and the economy; carrying out a comprehensive assessment of significant credit institutions; and participating in discussions on shaping the regulatory framework at both the international and EU levels. Furthermore, with the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism 
(SSM) on 4 November 2014, the ECB formally assumed its micro- and macro-prudential tasks. This new framework will ensure that both institution-specific and 
systemic risks in the financial system are identified and addressed in a timely and effective manner, in close cooperation with authorities in participating Member
 States.This section describes the main developments in the above areas, focusing on how the ECB™s activities as well as institutional and regulatory changes contributed to the 
repair of the financial system, weakening the nexus between banks and sovereigns and building confidence in the EU financial sector.
3.1 Safeguarding financial stability21 Œ a key task for the ECBThe ECB™s financial stability analysis is regularly presented in, for example, its 

semi-annual Financial Stability Review.22 The ECB also provides analytical support to the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) in the area of financial stability analysis. During 2014 the ECB™s financial stability analysis supported in particular the development of the adverse stress-test scenarios for the EU-wide stress test of banks and insurance firms that were provided by the ESRB.23 These scenarios were used in the EU-wide bank stress-testing exercise conducted by the European 
Banking Authority (EBA) on which the ECB™s comprehensive assessment of banks built24, as well as in the insurance stress test of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)25.21 The ECB defines financial stability as a condition in which the financial system Œ intermediaries, 
markets and market infrastructures Œ can withstand shocks without major disruption in financial 

intermediation and in the effective allocation of savings to productive investment.22 See Financial Stability Review

25 See EIOPA insurance stress test 2014, EIOPA, November 2014.53Euro area financial system stress was contained in 2014 but risks remainFinancial system stress in the euro area remained contained throughout 2014. Indicators of stress among euro area banks and sovereigns declined further to levels last seen before the outbreak of the global financial crisis. Stress across the broader financial system also remained contained (see Chart 25).The financial stability risks faced by the euro area during 2014 can be divided into two broad categories. First, ﬁlegacyﬂ issues from the global financial crisis, while receding throughout the year, remained a 

concern. For the euro area, these mainly related to insufficient progress in addressing weaknesses on 
the part of both the banking sector and governments. 
The second broad set of risks were ﬁemergingﬂ risks, which mainly stemmed from a continued global search for yield. This left the financial system more vulnerable 
to an abrupt reversal of risk premia.Underlying all of the key risks to financial system stability was the uncertainty owing to the weak, fragile and uneven economic recovery. The very low rate of 

inflation also has the potential to aggravate existing vulnerabilities, should it remain at current levels for longer than expected or decline further.
Continued progress in resolving legacy issues from the global financial crisis Both banks and governments continued to take action in 2014 to address legacy risks from the crisis. Euro area bank balance sheets were strengthened further in the course of the year, with a clear shift towards capital increases Œ related to the comprehensive assessment carried out by the ECB Œ from deleveraging and  de-risking in previous years. At the same time, progress by euro area governments 
in implementing fiscal consolidation and structural reforms continued, although the pace was uneven across countries. The improved sentiment resulted in significantly declining yields on lower-rated euro area government bonds, which in some cases 
reached levels last seen before the eruption of the euro area-centred second wave of the global financial crisis in 2010.Despite this progress by both banks and governments, financial stability challenges persist. While the comprehensive assessment ensured that significant banks in the euro area have sufficient capital levels, the banking system needs to address 
remaining fragilities and uncertainties. The main challenge facing the euro area

Working Paper Series, No 1426, ECB, March 2012.54banking sector during 2014 was continued low profitability levels in large parts of the sector, which stemmed mainly from the weak economic environment. Persistently 
weak bank profitability could become a systemic concern if it limits banks™ ability 
to improve their shock-absorbing capacity via retained earnings and provisioning. This could prevent banks from engaging in new profitable lending activities and lead to more structural business model-related concerns in a low growth environment. In such circumstances, banks might be tempted to take on more risk to improve profitability, which in turn could make them more vulnerable to future shocks.
Banks™ return on equity during
 2014 stood well below their cost of equity (shareholders™ 
expected rate of return), which also points to a structural need for further balance sheet 

adjustment in parts of the banking system. Sluggish bank profitability was, however, 
a challenge that affected not only euro area banks during
 2014. Their aggregate 
financial performance closely resembled that of non-euro area European banks and Œ 
once loan loss provisioning is corrected for Œ also that of their US peers (see Chart 26). 
Sovereign debt-related stress remained contained in the euro area during 2014. Supported by the improved sovereign debt market conditions following the announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions in
 2012 and the ECB™s policy 
action during 2014, market sentiment remained relatively favourable. The gradual 
strengthening of cyclical economic conditions and the ongoing fiscal consolidation underpinned this development. Sentiment was also supported by continued progress in weakening the links between sovereigns and banks. The establishment of the SSM and regulatory initiatives Œ 
such as new bail-in rules Œ were crucial in this respect. However, the
 continued significant correlation between the borrowing costs of euro area banks and 
sovereigns highlights the need for continued progress. Chart 26Pre- and post-provision return on equity of euro area and global large and complex banking groups (percentages; medians; two-period moving average)a) Pre-provision return on equityb) Return on equity0510

half of 2014.55Public debt sustainability challenges persisted in 2014 owing to continued high debt levels in many countries, heightened downside risks to the economic outlook and a very low inflation environment. Uncertainties relating to the sustainability of sovereign debt are likely to remain a key issue. This highlights the 
need for further adjustment of the fiscal and economic fundamentals that are relevant for debt sustainability.
Supported by the progress made by banks and sovereigns in tackling legacy problems from the global 
financial crisis, the increase in euro area financial market integration witnessed since 2012 continued throughout 2014, reaching levels last seen before the onset of the euro area sovereign debt crisis (see Chart 27).26 Improvements in the state of financial market integration were registered to varying degrees in all key market segments Œ money, bond, equity and banking markets. In the money market, integration continued to increase at a gradual pace amid 
sustained action by banks to reduce balance sheet uncertainties and improve funding 
positions. This improvement was reflected in declining levels of excess liquidity Œ the 
amount of cash held by banks above usual requirements. Fragmentation also receded further in euro area bond markets during 2014. The improvement in bond market integration was the result of several factors. First, the disparity in economic sentiment across euro area countries declined further. 
Second, the ECB™s decisions on further monetary policy measures underpinned 

confidence throughout the year. Third, the monetary policy stance across other major 
currency areas remained accommodative overall, which contributed to a search for higher-yielding assets. This drove down the spreads of riskier assets and contributed 
to lower fragmentation in euro area bond markets. These factors also supported 
stock markets, where the degree of cross-country heterogeneity declined somewhat 
further in 2014 in the euro area.The integration of euro area banking markets improved somewhat during 2014 with regard to lending activity and the gathering of deposits. Cross-border banking activity increased moderately, although the level of integration in banking markets 
remained lower than before the onset of the financial crisis. This was illustrated, for 
example, by the persistent gap between the borrowing costs paid by non-financial corporations Œ particularly small and medium-sized enterprises Œ across euro area countries, which has not yet closed.While the Eurosystem considers financial market integration to be first and foremost a market-driven process, the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system clearly plays an important facilitating role. Numerous important achievements 26 For a more detailed analysis of financial market integration developments during 2014, see

financial integration. For further details, see Financial integration in Europe, ECB, 2015, forthcoming.56in the regulatory realm during 2014 supported financial market integration (see also Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of this chapter). The ECB assumed responsibility for banking 
supervision on 4 November 2014. The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and 
the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) are essential pillars of a more robust and resilient framework to help prevent future financial crises as well as to ensure effective intervention and, ultimately, the resolution of banks if needed. This will 
contribute significantly to the integration of European financial markets. Emerging risks needed close monitoring and analysis While prevailing financial stability challenges were to a large extent linked to legacy issues stemming from the financial crisis, signs of new potential risks emerged thereafter and in some cases gathered further momentum in 2014. These risks were 
largely linked to the low interest rate environment, which contributed to a search for yield in financial asset markets as well as in some real asset markets, where low borrowing costs fuelled price increases in some segments and countries. Despite bouts of volatility Œ linked to rising geopolitical tensions and weak economic data Œ a search for yield persisted during 2014 across global financial markets, which in Europe was most visible in corporate and government bond markets (see Chart 28). This was associated with an increased correlation within and 
across euro area bond, equity and money markets reminiscent of the years before the onset of the global financial crisis.The steady growth of euro area non-bank credit intermediation (which is considered by the Financial Stability Board to be a broad definition of, or proxy for, shadow banking, and includes all non-monetary 

financial institutions except insurance firms and pension funds) in recent years suggests that vulnerabilities are likely to have increased in this area (see Chart 29).27 The euro area shadow banking sector has expanded substantially over the past decade. The broadest measure of shadow banking shows that total assets doubled to reach •22 trillion in June 2014. Important changes have taken place within the sector that can be linked to three by-products of the financial crisis. First, the very low interest rate environment has created 
challenges for money market funds, the assets of which shrank from a pre-crisis peak of •1.3 trillion to •835 billion in mid-2014. Second, the assets of financial vehicle corporations involved in securitisations located in the euro area shrank by almost a third, to •1.9 trillion, 27 The Financial Stability Board defines shadow banking as ﬁcredit intermediation involving entities and 
activities (fully or partially) outside the regular banking systemﬂ. For a discussion on the euro area 

shadow banking sector, see Doyle, N., Hermans, L., Mikkonen, K. and Molitor, P., ﬁStructural features of

price/earnings ratio.57over the same period. Third, the decline in money market funds and financial vehicle corporations has been more than offset by the strong growth of the euro area investment fund sector (excluding money market funds). Against the backdrop of an intense global search for yield, the euro area investment fund sector (excluding money market funds) grew to •8.9 trillion in the third quarter of 2014.Shadow banking entities have become an important provider of credit to the euro area economy, especially 

as bank credit has contracted in recent years. Any problem confronting shadow banking entities could therefore propagate quickly to the banking sector and the real economy, since these entities are 
highly interconnected with euro area credit institutions. 
They are also an important source of funding for euro area banks, non-financial corporations and governments. Although the provision of banking 
services by such entities can have a number of benefits, such as increasing the real economy™s 
access to credit, supporting market liquidity and enabling the sharing of risk, further 
initiatives are needed to monitor and assess vulnerabilities in the growing shadow 
banking sector. At the same time, continued efforts are needed to improve macro-
prudential oversight and the policy tools available for mitigating action, as those that are currently available provide limited scope to deal with risks stemming from shadow banking activities.3.2 The ECB™s macro-prudential function
The ECB and the ESRB both exercise macro-prudential policy functions, each in the remit of their respective mandates and in close cooperation with one another. 
Macro-prudential policy and regulationWith the establishment of the SSM, the ECB assumed its macro-prudential tasks, 
meaning that it can apply, on its own initiative and subject to coordination with 
national authorities, measures that are defined in the relevant EU legislation. This notwithstanding, it is worth highlighting that the primary responsibility for the implementation of macro-prudential measures lies with the national competent or designated authorities. The ECB can apply higher requirements for capital buffers 
and more stringent measures than those applied by the national competent or designated authorities (see Article
 5 of the SSM Regulation).In view of the ECB™s new micro- and macro-prudential functions, an
 internal 
mechanism has been set up to foster ex ante coordination on macro-prudential Chart 29Assets of selected euro area financial sectors(Q1 2009 Œ Q4 2014; index: Q1 2009 = 100)80100120140160180200220240260200920102011201220132014shadow banks: overallshadow banks: investment funds (excluding money market funds)shadow banks: hedge fundsbanksSources: ECB and ECB calculations.58matters and key policy issues in prudential and financial regulation. Coordination mechanisms between the ECB and the national competent or designated authorities of participating Member States have also been established.The macro-prudential toolkit includes capital buffers as well as other measures 
defined in the Capital Requirements Regulation and the fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRR/CRD IV package), such as additional disclosure requirements, large exposure limits, risk weights for real estate and measures related to intra-financial sector exposures.However, the current CRR/CRD IV package does not include certain measures which 
could also effectively address specific types of systemic risk and may therefore be 
amended at a later stage. Additional measures could, for example, include (i) various 
asset-side measures, such as the application of limits to loan-to-value, loan-to-
income or debt service-to-income ratios, and (ii) the introduction of various exposure limits falling outside the current definition of large exposures. It should be noted that the CRR/CRD IV already envisages the possibility to impose specific requirements to address systemic liquidity risks as well as to apply stricter rules concerning liquidity requirements to address macro-prudential or systemic risk. Furthermore, the CRR 
provides for the possible introduction of a leverage ratio subject to a legislative proposal. In addition, the macro-prudential framework should include instruments to address risks relating to or stemming from non-banks.Further potential challenges to macro-prudential policy at the SSM level include a lack of harmonisation with regard to some instruments and the unavailability of certain tools in some countries. In addition, the assessment by authorities of the potential cross-border impact of national measures has been rather limited, although work on the matter has been carried out by the ESRB. In order to strengthen the effectiveness of macro-prudential policies, it would thus be beneficial to further reflect 

on whether and how to extend the application of such measures across borders. In addition, the supervisory colleges and the ESRB provide additional possibilities for information exchange and coordination with non-euro area countries.The ECB has established a process for information exchange and coordination among national authorities and with the ECB that facilitates the implementation of various instruments and the assessment of their cross-border implications. These include early discussion and coordination of planned policy measures. The SSM Framework Regulation, which implements the SSM Regulation, states that if a national authority intends to make use of a macro-prudential tool, it must inform the ECB as early as possible. A corresponding obligation towards national authorities falls upon the ECB if it intends to make use of its powers to apply higher requirements. This framework is complemented by regular assessments by the ECB and an in-depth discussion of risks and policy tools with countries where systemic risks have been identified.59Macro-prudential policy and regulation at the EU level: cooperation with the ESRBThe ECB continued to cooperate closely with the European Systemic Risk Board 
(ESRB), which is entrusted with overseeing the EU financial system as a whole. 
The main objective of the ESRB is to prevent and mitigate systemic risks (both cyclical 
and structural) to financial stability in all financial sub-sectors. It brings together 
representatives of the ECB, the NCBs and national supervisory authorities of the 
EU Member States, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), the European 
Commission and the Economic and Financial Committee. The ECB continued to 
provide analytical, statistical, logistical and administrative support to the ESRB 

Secretariat, which is responsible for coordinating the day-to-day business of the ESRB.In 2014 the ESRB focused on the identification of potential systemic risks in the form of: 
(i) global financial market repricing, (ii) macroeconomic risk, (iii) fragilities in banks™ and 
insurance companies™ balance sheets, (iv) sovereign issues, and (v)
 market structures. 
It also examined a number of new issues, such as over-banking, loan origination by 

investment funds, and the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures, and contributed 
to the design of the stress-test scenarios for both banks and insurance firms.Given its coordinating function as regards the use of CRR/CRD IV-based macro-
prudential instruments, the ESRB discussed a large number of national macro-prudential measures during 2014, taking into account in particular the cross-border effects of these measures. The ESRB also published a broad set of guidelines on 
the use of these instruments and continued to assess the implementation of its 
Recommendation on the macro-prudential mandate of national authorities, with a view to further strengthening the macro-prudential framework.Box 5
Comprehensive assessmentThe comprehensive assessment of banks expected to qualify as significant was a prudential exercise of unprecedented scope and depth and marked a crucial milestone in setting up the SSM. The wealth of in-depth information gathered on the banks subject to direct ECB supervision 
in this exercise serves as an important input for their ongoing supervision. The comprehensive assessment began in autumn 2013 and was finalised with the publication of results on 26 October 2014. The exercise consisted of an asset quality review (AQR) and a 
stress test, with three main objectives: (i) to establish transparency by enhancing the quality of 
information available on the condition of banks; (ii) to identify and implement corrective actions if and where needed; and (iii) to build confidence by assuring all stakeholders that banks are fundamentally sound and trustworthy. The AQR was a point-in-time assessment of the accuracy 
of the carrying value of assets on banks™ balance sheets as at
 31 December 2013 and provided a starting point for the stress test. The stress test provided a forward-looking examination of the 
resilience of banks™ solvency to two hypothetical scenarios, also reflecting new information arising 
from the AQR. 
60Overall, the comprehensive assessment identified a capital shortfall of •24.6 billion across 25 participating banks28 after comparing the projected solvency ratios with the thresholds defined for the exercise. Between 1 January and 30 September 2014 participating banks raised a total of •57.1 billion in capital. After such capital measures were accounted for, the shortfall was reduced to •9.5 billion distributed across 13 banks.Under the adverse scenario, the stress test 
led to a total capital depletion of •181.7 billion, and the increase in risk-weighted assets resulted in additional capital requirements of •47.2 billion. Together with the net AQR 
adjustment of •33.8 billion, this implies a total figure of •262.7 billion (see Chart A).
These results are testimony to the fact that the adverse scenario developed by the ESRB was the most severe scenario of all EU-wide stress tests conducted so far. The macro-
financial stress covered three years, not two 
as in previous exercises, which added to its relative severity. 
Looking at the market reaction to the results of the comprehensive assessment, developments 
in bank shares across Europe showed a high degree of heterogeneity, depending on the 
country of residence of the banks concerned. Overall, it can be argued that markets reflected the results of the comprehensive assessment in an 

adequate manner, by appropriately differentiating between institutions.
The comprehensive assessment succeeded in substantially increasing the level of transparency of 
banks™ balance sheets through the publication of bank-level results in very granular disclosure templates. 
The requirement for banks facing capital shortfalls to make up those shortfalls within six or nine months, 
depending on the source of the shortfall, constitutes a strong driver for the process of balance sheet 

repair. The implementation of the remedial capital plans submitted by these banks is being monitored by 
the relevant Joint Supervisory Teams. The corresponding capital actions will result in increased solvency 
levels and thus enhance the stability of individual banks and the system as a whole.All of this contributes to enhancing the confidence of all stakeholders in the fundamental soundness of the euro area banking system. However, the stress test cannot Œ and was not 
intended to Œ replace the day-to-day supervision that is now being conducted by the SSM, taking due account of bank-specific situations as well as of ongoing developments.28 These include two banks which are implementing restructuring plans agreed with the European 
Commission, under which one bank would have a zero shortfall and the other would have a small 

shortfall.Chart AComprehensive assessment adverse scenariocapital depletion(SSM bank sample; EUR billions)33.8181.747.2262.7050100150

Together with the national competent 
authorities (NCAs), the ECB will contribute to the safety and soundness of the 
banking system and the stability of the financial system. The start of the SSM 

followed months of highly intensive preparatory work, including the establishment 
of the SSM governance structures, the finalisation of the legal framework for SSM 
supervision, the organisational development and staffing of the ECB™s supervisory 

function, and the development of the SSM supervisory model. In parallel, the ECB 
carried out a comprehensive assessment of significant banks, subjecting them to an 
in-depth asset quality review and a stress test (see Box 5 for details).ECB/SSM preparations Œ getting ready for banking supervisionIn line with the SSM Regulation, the planning and execution of the tasks conferred 
on the ECB are fully undertaken by the Supervisory Board as an internal body 
of the ECB. The Supervisory Board takes draft supervisory decisions which are 

deemed adopted unless the Governing Council, as the ultimate decision-making 
body of the ECB, objects within a defined period of time. The establishment of the 

Supervisory Board, including the appointment of the Chair, Vice-Chair and three 

ECB representatives in late December 2013 and early 2014, was thus a key step The distribution of tasks within the SSMDirectsupervisionIndirectsupervisionoversees the system support ECB SignificantinstitutionsHorizontal divisions JSTsLess significantinstitutionsNCAs 62in setting up the governance structures of the SSM.29 The Supervisory Board has been operational since January 2014, meeting on a regular basis to discuss and prepare decisions on key matters related to the SSM. The establishment of the Steering Committee of the Supervisory Board, as well as the Administrative Board of Review and the Mediation Panel, were further important steps in completing the SSM governance framework. The mandate of the Administrative Board of Review is to review supervisory decisions if a request is submitted by any natural or legal person. The purpose of the Mediation Panel is to resolve Œ if so requested by an NCA Œ 
differences of views regarding an objection by the Governing Council to a draft decision prepared by the Supervisory Board. For details on the measures taken to ensure the separation between the monetary policy and supervisory functions of the ECB, see Section 6 of Chapter 2.The completion of the legal framework for SSM supervision required the adoption of the SSM Framework Regulation, setting out the practical arrangements for the implementation of Article
 6 of the SSM Regulation (concerning the cooperation 
between the ECB and the NCAs within the SSM), as well as the ECB Regulation on supervisory fees. The former was published in April
 2014, the latter in October 2014. Both regulations were subject to a public consultation before their finalisation.As regards the operational set-up of the ECB™s supervisory function, the 
establishment of the Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs), which are composed of ECB 
and NCA staff and are entrusted with the direct supervision of significant institutions, 
was a crucial step. A JST has been created for each significant institution. 
The organisational set-up of the indirect supervision of less significant institutions and the horizontal and specialised functions was further developed. Recruitment efforts 

for all SSM business areas of the ECB were enormous; overall, more than 960 staff 
out of an approximate total of 1,000 budgeted positions had been recruited by the beginning of January 2015.Another key aspect of the SSM preparations was the development of the SSM Supervisory Manual, which establishes the processes and methodology for the supervision of credit institutions and the procedures for cooperation within the SSM and with authorities outside the SSM.The manual is a ﬁliving documentﬂ that is updated to reflect new market developments and supervisory practices.In order to facilitate the exchange of information and ensure the best possible coordination within the SSM, various fora have been established. Several existing ESCB/Eurosystem committees now meet in an SSM composition to deal 
with aspects of banking supervision in their respective areas of responsibility. 
Where appropriate ESCB/Eurosystem committees did not exist, networks of experts have been established comprising experts from both the ECB and the NCAs.29 According to Article 26(1) of the SSM Regulation, the Supervisory Board must include four 
representatives of the ECB. The fourth representative was appointed in February 2015.63The way forward for the ECB/SSM Œ harmonisation to ensure the highest supervisory standardsOngoing supervision by the JSTs addresses a variety of issues that constitute 
important challenges for the supervised institutions. In particular, the SSM sets 
supervisory priorities which build upon the identification of the main risks with the potential to threaten the SSM banking system as a whole. At a general level, 
this includes the assessment of the profitability and sustainability of the specific business model of each bank in a low interest rate environment, as well as of the institutions™ governance and risk management processes and the transition to higher 
capital requirements required by the CRR/CRD IV. 
SSM supervisors use the full range of supervisory tools at their disposal to monitor these issues and induce corrective actions by the institutions where required. 
The Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process is a key instrument in this respect. It is conducted on an annual basis, with the key purpose of ensuring that institutions™ 
capital and liquidity, as well as their internal arrangements, strategies and processes, 

are adequate to ensure the sound management and coverage of their risks. In addition, this ongoing assessment may result in the need to issue recommendations and adopt supervisory measures.In all its activities, the establishment of a level playing field in the supervisory and regulatory treatment of institutions across all Member States is an important goal for the SSM. Specific horizontal and specialised functions at the ECB are tasked with (i) fostering the harmonisation of supervisory approaches; (ii) promoting an 
intrusive approach to banking supervision; and (iii) intensifying cooperation and communication inside and outside the SSM.Significant efforts are being made to drive forward harmonisation in areas where 
national rules and practices diverge. These efforts involve taking stock of existing 
national supervisory practices, developing standards, testing and further refining harmonised supervisory methodologies, conducting quality assurance reviews and measuring the effectiveness of actions implemented. 
Such efforts are not limited to the significant institutions under direct ECB 
supervision. The ECB also exercises indirect supervision of less significant 
institutions. In 2015 it will aim to finalise the design and set-up of its supervisory approach. This involves issuing guidelines and regulations to NCAs, conducting 

thematic reviews, organising staff exchanges and participating in crisis management, 

all in close cooperation with the NCAs. Harmonisation across the SSM is pursued with the objective of converging towards best practices and the highest supervisory standards in all areas, ensuring the SSM™s 
contribution to enhancing the stability of the euro area banking system and rebuilding confidence in this system.643.4 EU efforts to break the nexus between banks and sovereigns
Significant progress towards establishing a banking union was made in 2014. In parallel to the establishment of the SSM and the development of the single rulebook, the Eurosystem contributed to the preparatory work on the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), including the Single Resolution Fund (SRF). Together, 
the SSM, the single rulebook, the SRM and the SRF are essential pillars of a more robust and resilient framework to help prevent future financial crises and to ensure effective intervention and, ultimately, the resolution of banks in the event of a bank 
failure. During the recent crisis, the lack of a common resolution framework obliging investors (i.e. shareholders and creditors) to bear losses contributed to a nexus 
between banks and sovereigns. The existence of implicit and explicit state 
guarantees during the crisis had serious consequences in the form of increased fragmentation of the Single Market. One key objective of the banking union, and in particular of the SRM, is to break this link between banks and sovereigns by making efficient resolution a common attainable objective while simultaneously reducing the 

need for costly public intervention. The banking union will contribute to the integration 
of European financial markets and will be instrumental in the efforts to efficiently 
manage future financial crises and to break the harmful nexus between banks and 
sovereigns. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive complements EU state aid rulesDuring the financial crisis, the EU state aid guidelines and communications provided the framework for coordinated action in support of the financial sector. The
 framework sets out not only the conditions for access to state aid for the financial sector, but also 
the way in which restructuring plans are assessed and the minimum rules for burden-sharing with capital holders and junior creditors of distressed banks accessing public support. It also ensures that state aid and distortions of competition between banks and across Member States are kept to a minimum. In an environment where Member States had their own individual crisis management and resolution regimes in place, 
this framework created a minimum level of harmonisation for crisis management and resolution in the EU. However, it was clear that a single rulebook for the recovery 
and resolution of banks and large investment firms was needed, which would both harmonise and upgrade the powers and tools needed for effectively dealing with 
bank crises across the EU. As of 1 January 2015 the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) has to be implemented by all Member States.30 The BRRD establishes common and 30 The BRRD entered into force on 2 July 2014. Member States had to transpose the BRRD into national 
legislation by 31 December 2014, and to apply it as of 1 January 2015. However, the bail-in provisions 

will only be applicable as of 1 January 2016.65efficient tools and powers to address a banking crisis pre-emptively and to manage the failure of credit institutions and investment firms in an orderly manner throughout the EU. In particular, the BRRD lays out a comprehensive set of measures which ensure that banks and authorities make adequate preparations for crises and that national authorities are equipped with the necessary tools to intervene in a troubled institution at a sufficiently early stage. In addition, it allows national authorities to have harmonised resolution tools and powers to take rapid and effective action when a bank is deemed to be failing or likely to fail, and to cooperate effectively when 
dealing with the failure of a cross-border bank. One of the key objectives of the BRRD is to shift the cost of bank failures from the taxpayer to the shareholders and creditors of a failing bank, and the banking sector at large, via banks™ contributions to the resolution fund. This is important for 
many reasons, not least that of solving the too-big-to-fail problem of large banks, which Œ unless there is a credible resolution option Œ risk having to be bailed out by the taxpayers at huge cost during financial crises. These banks have often been 

perceived by markets as having an implicit state guarantee, which creates not only a moral hazard problem, but also an uneven playing field among banks. For
 example, the fact that large banks are expected to be saved by the state means that large banks in fiscally strong countries can fund themselves far more cheaply than smaller banks or banks in countries with weaker public finances. The
 introduction of a credible resolution framework thus contributes to breaking the link between banks and their sovereigns, which proved to be both costly and destabilising during the 
recent crisis. An important tool for attaining this objective is the bail-in tool, which 
enables the resolution authority to write down, or convert into equity, the claims of 
a broad range of creditors. This will ensure that shareholders and creditors first and 
foremost bear the losses and the costs of bank resolution. Finally, the BRRD is fully in line with the recommendations of the Financial Stability 
Board on effective resolution regimes for financial institutions
31 as well as with ongoing work to develop policy proposals on how legal certainty in respect of 
the cross-border recognition of resolution measures can be ensured. It delivers a comprehensive resolution toolkit that ensures that any bank failure is dealt with in an orderly manner, minimising the burden on taxpayers.
The Single Resolution Mechanism - breaking the link between banks and their sovereignsSince 1 January 2015 the SSM has been complemented by the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) for all countries participating in the SSM.32 The levels of responsibility and decision-making for supervision and resolution will be aligned on the basis of harmonised underlying legal frameworks, such as the BRRD, eliminating 31 See Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions
, Financial Stability Board, published in October 2011 and updated on 15 October 2014.32 While the preparatory work including the operation of the Board and the preparation of resolution plans 

and resolvability assessments apply from 1 January 2015, the SRM Regulation will be applicable only 

from 1 January 2016 as regards resolution powers.66the previous institutional fragmentation. This will further contribute to dissolving the link between banks and their sovereigns and therefore also help to open up the market for bank debt across Europe. The SRM consists of the national resolution authorities with a Single Resolution Board (SRB) at its centre. The SRB is a fully independent agency of the EU, financed 
by contributions from the banking sector. It has a Chair, a Vice-Chair and four further 
permanent members, and may also involve, as the case may be, the European Commission, the ECB and the national resolution authorities of the participating Member States. The European Commission and the ECB have the status of 
permanent observers, while the SRB may invite other observers on an ad hoc basis. 
The SRB is expected to be fully operational from 2016, when the Single Resolution Fund is established. The SRB will then have full access to the set of resolution 
powers endowed by the SRM Regulation, including the management of the Single Resolution Fund. However, in
 2015 the SRB will already be collecting information and cooperating with the national resolution authorities and other competent 
authorities, including the ECB, in preparation for its subsequent work.The Single Resolution Fund Œ preparatory work completedAn important element of the SRM will be the establishment of the Single Resolution 

Fund (SRF) in 2016. Although the SRF is established by the SRM Regulation, certain 
elements related to the functioning of the SRF are regulated in an intergovernmental 
agreement between the participating Member States.33 This agreement provides the 
legal foundations in line with national constitutional provisions for mutualising SRF funds. 
The scope of the agreement is mainly focused on arrangements to cover the period 
when the SRF is being built up. During this transitional period of eight years, the SRF will 
be composed of national compartments, which are to be progressively mutualised by 
the end of the transitional period. The agreement therefore covers: (i) the transfer of the 
contributions raised by the national resolution authorities to the national compartments; 
(ii) the frontloaded mutualisation of the funds available in the national compartments; 

(iii) the order in which financial resources are mobilised for fund resolution from the 
compartments and other sources; (iv) the replenishment of the compartments if needed; 
and (v) the temporary lending between national compartments if needed. It also includes 
provisions which apply in the event of the participation of non-euro area countries in the 
SRM via close cooperation within the SSM.The target size of the SRF, which is set at
 1% of the covered deposits of all banks in participating countries, should be reached within eight years. The precise amount 

that an individual bank will contribute is determined by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/63 and Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/81.  The individual contributions will be based on: (i) a fixed component, which is based 
on the relative size of an institution™s liabilities (excluding own funds and covered 
33 Representatives of all EU Member States except Sweden and the United Kingdom signed the 
intergovernmental agreement. Member States that have signed but do not participate in the SSM 

will only be subject to the rights and obligations stemming from the agreement once they participate 

in the SSM.67deposits with respect to the aggregate liabilities of all institutions authorised in the participating countries); and (ii) a risk adjustment, in accordance with the risk profile of each institution. The establishment of the SRF will entail a gradual shift from a 
national to a European target level of the resolution fund, which implies that national banking sectors may have to contribute more or less to the SRF than they would to a national resolution fund under the BRRD. In order to prevent abrupt changes,  the Council Implementing Regulation provides for an adjustment mechanism to 
mitigate these effects during the transitional period. This
 is accomplished by way of 
a non-linear phasing-in of the contributions calculated on the basis of a single target level and a non-linear phasing-out of the contributions calculated on the basis of national target levels in accordance with the BRRD (see Table
 3).European Stability Mechanism, backstops and borrowing capacity of the SRFEnsuring effective and sufficient financing of the SRF is of paramount importance to 
the credibility of the SRM. Given that situations may arise in which the means available 
in the SRF are not sufficient and the ex post contributions that can be raised in order 
to cover the shortfall are not immediately accessible, ways of dealing with such cases 
need to be developed. The SRM Regulation specifies that the capacity of the SRB to 
contract alternative funding means for the SRF should be enhanced in a manner that 
optimises the cost of funding and preserves the creditworthiness of the SRF. Concrete 
and meaningful steps are needed in 2015 to make progress in this field. 
In addition, a common backstop to the SRF will be developed before the end of the eight-year transitional period of the SRF. This backstop will also facilitate 

borrowing by the SRF. Meanwhile, in order to ensure continuous sufficient financing 
during the transitional period, the intergovernmental agreement specifies that the countries affected by a particular resolution action should provide bridge financing 
from national sources or, if needed, the European Stability Mechanism in line with 
agreed procedures. Cooperation between the SRM and the SSMCooperation within the banking union is a key priority. The EU crisis management 

framework creates a duty for supervisory and resolution authorities to cooperate. The interaction between the SSM and the SRM is structured around three main pillars: complementary institutional roles, cooperation and strong coordination. Table 3

The SSM and the SRM thus have 
complementary roles to play in the success of the banking union.To ensure that they play these roles, the SSM and the SRM will need to cooperate 
closely in order to ensure that the overall supervisory and resolution framework and any overlaps are effectively managed. The ECB has designated a representative 
entitled to participate, as a permanent observer, in the meetings of executive 
sessions and plenary sessions of the SRB. This representative will be entitled 
to participate in the debates and will have access to all documents. In the same vein, the ECB may invite the Chair of the SRB to participate as an observer in the 
Supervisory Board of the ECB.Structural reform of the banking sector Œ preventing banks from directly engaging in high-risk proprietary tradingThe banking union project is to be complemented by structural reform of the EU 
banking sector. On
 29 January 2014 the European Commission adopted a legislative 
proposal that focuses on European banks that are identified as being of global 
systemic importance and those that exceed certain thresholds. The proposal involves 
a ban on proprietary trading as narrowly defined, with the exception of those activities 
involving financial instruments issued by EU governments and cash management 
activities. Furthermore, it suggested the potential separation of certain trading activities, 
namely market-making, complex securitisation and complex derivatives, if certain 

metrics are exceeded. The 
ECB™s opinion34 on the subject generally supported the 
Commission™s proposal to ban proprietary trading, with the aim of preventing banks 
from directly engaging in high-risk proprietary trading in the future. From a financial 
stability perspective, there is also support for the separation of certain trading activities 
from the deposit-taking entity. However, the ECB considered it important to sufficiently 
preserve market-making activities, as they have an important role in increasing asset 
and market liquidity, moderating price volatility and increasing securities markets™ 
resilience to shocks. This is essential for financial stability, the implementation 

and smooth transmission of monetary policy, and the financing of the economy. 
Such market-making activities could, therefore, be allowed to continue within the 
deposit-taking entity. The opinion also supports the separation of certain trading 
activities when metrics of activities exceed certain thresholds, although with a higher 
degree of supervisory discretion for assessing the separation. To this end, the metrics 

proposed by the Commission could usefully be complemented by additional qualitative 
and quantitative information that also captures the risks entailed by trading activities. 
34 CON/2014/83.69Chapter 2 Other tasks and activities1 Market infrastructure and payments
Market infrastructures are the backbone of financial markets as they enable the safe flow of funds and financial assets in the economy. Their smooth operation is 
crucial to maintaining confidence in the currency and supporting monetary policy operations and the stability of the financial system as a whole. The integration of 
market infrastructures across national borders in Europe is a necessary condition for achieving a truly single market, which will increase efficiency for consumers, 
companies and banks. The Eurosystem plays a central role in this field. It provides payment and securities settlement services, oversees financial market infrastructures and payment instruments, and works with market stakeholders to achieve financial market integration. Cooperation and dialogue with other financial institutions and non-euro area central banks on policy aspects relating to regional and global developments in the field of market infrastructure and payments are also high on the Eurosystem™s
 agenda.1.1 Integration and innovation in retail payments
Retail payments are ﬁeverydayﬂ payments between, for example, private persons, 
companies, non-governmental organisations and government agencies which are of relatively low value and typically not of a time-critical nature.A major milestone was reached in this field on 1 August 2014 as the Single Euro 
Payments Area (SEPA) was successfully implemented for credit transfers and direct 
debits in the euro area, allowing consumers and businesses to use a single payment account for all euro credit transfers and direct debits. The migration period for 
 euro-denominated credit transfers and direct debits in non-euro area countries 
will end on 31 October 2016. The Eurosystem has shaped the implementation of 
SEPA from its inception, playing a catalyst role in this major integration project and 

facilitating dialogue between all players. Innovation in the field of retail payments, focusing on instant and mobile payments, and the integration of card payments are the next steps for SEPA. In April 2014 
the ECB published a report entitled ﬁCard payments in Europe Œ a renewed focus on SEPA for cards
ﬂ, which called for implementation of the vision of ﬁany card at 
any terminalﬂ. 70The Eurosystem also works with market stakeholders on the further development of 
an integrated, innovative and competitive market for euro retail payments via the 
 Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB). Through the ERPB, the Eurosystem is now 

actively involved in facilitating ﬁinstant paymentsﬂ in euro, i.e. payments that flow in 
real time from the sender to the recipient, allowing the recipient to re-use the funds 
immediately. In December 2014 the ERPB launched work to facilitate person-to-person 
mobile payments and contactless proximity payments. The ERPB also published a set 
of recommendations to address remaining SEPA post-migration issues. 
1.2 The large-value payment system for the euro: TARGET2
The Eurosystem operates the infrastructure for the real-time settlement of large-value  and urgent euro payments in central bank money, TARGET2. TARGET2 settles, 
among other things, Eurosystem monetary policy operations and interbank transactions, thus fulfilling a crucial function for the euro area. Reaching 24 central banks of the EU and around 55,000 banks worldwide, TARGET2 is one of the largest 
payment systems in the world. TARGET2 continued to function smoothly in 2014, reaching 100% availability. 
It settled a total of 90,337,036 transactions and had a turnover of •492,431 billion, corresponding to a daily average of 354,263 transactions and •1,931 billion. A reduction of 2.4% was observed in the settled volumes as compared with  end-2013, driven by a decrease in the number of customer payments following the completion of the migration to SEPA instruments. In 2014 work continued on migrating TARGET2 to new industry standards 
(ISO20022). Moreover, progress was made in ensuring that the system achieves 
full compliance with the ECB Regulation on oversight requirements for systemically important payment systems (see below for more details), particularly in the areas of risk assessment, liquidity stress testing and tiered participation.1.3 Integrated and harmonised securities settlement: TARGET2-
SecuritiesFrom June 2015 the Eurosystem™s new infrastructure, 
TARGET2-Securities
 (T2S), will offer securities settlement in central bank money across borders in Europe. Between June 2015 and February 2017 as many as 24 European central securities depositories (CSDs) will outsource their securities accounts to T2S, and 23 NCBs will open cash accounts in T2S for the simultaneous and final transfer of securities 
against central bank money.For T2S stakeholders 2014 was an intense year of testing and preparations. 
The T2S software, developed by the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banco de España, the Banque de France and the Banca d™Italia, was made available for user testing 
with CSDs and NCBs on 1 October, after completion of the Eurosystem acceptance 
testing in September. 
71The prospect of T2S has created the conditions for the securities industry to work 
together to harmonise the way securities settlement is carried out across borders and 
to achieve greater safety and efficiency as well as an open competitive environment.
351.4 Provision of Eurosystem collateral management services
Market players view the possibility of easily mobilising assets as collateral as crucial to their risk and liquidity management and to their compliance with regulatory requirements. In order to facilitate the cross-border use of collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, the Eurosystem offers the Correspondent Central Banking Model 
(CCBM). In 2014 two improvements were made to the CCBM. The requirement to 
repatriate securities back to the issuer CSD before mobilising them via the CCBM was removed on 26 May; in addition, triparty collateral management services became 
accessible at the cross-border level via the CCBM as of 29 September. These 
enhancements enable counterparties to consolidate their collateral holdings in one, 
or just a few, CSDs of their choice and to manage their collateral more
 efficiently. 
In view of market and regulatory developments that have led to higher demand for collateral, the ECB worked closely with the industry via its Contact Group on Euro Securities Infrastructures (COGESI), publishing three reports on important issues related to collateral eligibility, availability and mobility. 1.5 Oversight of market infrastructures and payment instruments
Disruptions in the financial market infrastructure can lead to major disruptions for 
the economy. The Eurosystem™s oversight function plays a key role in making sure 
that risks are controlled and prevented to the largest possible extent, also taking into account international oversight standards and regulatory developments.36To ensure the efficient management of risks and sound governance arrangements, 

the ECB adopted a Regulation on oversight requirements for systemically important payment systems, which entered into force on 12 August 2014. The Regulation is consistent with the Principles for financial market infrastructures issued by the Committee for Payments and Market Infrastructures of the BIS and the International 
Organization of Securities Commissions. On 20 August 2014 the ECB identified four systems as systemically important and therefore subject to the new Regulation: TARGET2 (operated by the Eurosystem itself), EURO1 and STEP2-T (operated by EBA CLEARING), and CORE(FR) (operated by STET). This list will be reviewed annually. The Eurosystem has conducted a gap analysis to ensure the compliance of TARGET2 with the new oversight requirements.35 More information on the post-trade harmonisation activities triggered by T2S can be found at 
 www.harmonisation.T2S.eu 36 More information on the Eurosystem™s oversight activities can be found in the 
Eurosystem oversight report 2014.72The Eurosystem also undertook a comprehensive review of the oversight standards for euro retail payment systems that are not systemically important. As a result, 
the ECB published on 21 August 2014 the 
Revised Oversight Framework for Retail Payment Systems, according to which non-systemically important retail payment 
systems are subject to selected Principles for financial market infrastructures, according to the level of risk posed to the market served.With regard to the oversight of securities and derivatives infrastructures, the main activities in 2014 were related to new regulation. The Eurosystem continued to work 
in the respective central counterparty colleges on the (re)authorisation of EU central counterparties with a large euro-denominated central clearing business under 
the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), and it contributed to the drafting of the technical standards for the CSD Regulation. In addition, the oversight assessment of the T2S design continued in 2014 and will be finalised before T2S goes live in June 2015.Payment instruments were also subject to oversight initiatives in 2014 aimed at increasing safety. In 2014 the Eurosystem finalised the assessment of 
23 international and major domestic card payment schemes operating in the euro 
area against the harmonised Eurosystem oversight framework for card payment schemes. Most card schemes were found to observe or broadly observe the oversight standards, and the Eurosystem has started a dialogue with the operators of these schemes to address any outstanding issues. In November 2014 the ECB also published two guides for the assessment of direct debit schemes and credit transfer schemes against the oversight standards for payment instruments.Finally, Eurosystem overseers continued to contribute to the work of the European 
Forum for the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay), a forum for voluntary cooperation for the European Banking Authority and the ESCB in their functions as 

regulators, supervisors or overseers.732 Financial services to other institutions
2.1 Administration of borrowing and lending operations 
In 2014 the ECB continued to be responsible for the administration of the borrowing and lending operations of the EU under the medium-term financial assistance facility (MTFA)
37, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM)38, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)39 and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)40. Under the MTFA the ECB processed interest payments on 11 loans in 2014. As at 
31 December 2014 the total outstanding amount under this facility was •8.4 billion. Under the EFSM the ECB processed payments, or interest payments, on 21 loans in 2014 and the total outstanding amount as at 31 December 2014 was •46.8 billion. On behalf of the EFSF the ECB processed four disbursement payments to the borrower countries (Portugal and Greece) and various interest and fee payments on the loans. On behalf of the ESM the ECB processed 26 payments in the form of ESM 
member contributions or in relation to the borrower countries (Cyprus and Spain).Finally, the ECB continued to be responsible for processing all payments related 
to the loan facility agreement for Greece.41 The balance outstanding as at 31 December 2014 was •52.9 billion.2.2 Eurosystem Reserve Management Services 
In 2014 a comprehensive set of financial services continued to be offered within 

the Eurosystem Reserve Management Services (ERMS) framework established in 2005 for the management of customers™ euro-denominated reserve assets. 
Individual Eurosystem NCBs (ﬁthe Eurosystem service providersﬂ) offer the complete 
set of services under harmonised terms and conditions in line with general market standards to central banks, to monetary authorities and government agencies located outside the euro area, and to international organisations. The ECB performs an 
overall coordinating role, ensuring the smooth functioning of the framework and the 
reporting to the Governing Council. 37 In accordance with Article 141(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Articles 17, 
21.2, 43.1 and 46.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, and Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 of 

18 February 2002.38 In accordance with Articles 122(2) and 132(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 

Articles 17 and 21 of the Statute of the ESCB, and Article 8 of Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 of 

11 May 2010.39 In accordance with Articles 17 and 21 of the Statute of the ESCB (in conjunction with Article 3(5) of the 

EFSF Framework Agreement).40 In accordance with Articles 17 and 21 of the Statute of the ESCB (in conjunction with Article 5.12.1 

of the ESM General Terms for Financial Assistance Facility Agreements).41 In the context of the loan facility agreement between the Member States whose currency is the euro 

(other than Greece and Germany) and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (acting in the public interest, 

subject to the instructions of and with the benefit of the guarantee of the Federal Republic of Germany) 

as lenders and the Hellenic Republic as borrower and the Bank of Greece as agent to the borrower, 

and pursuant to Articles 17 and 21.2 of the Statute of the ESCB and Article 2 of Decision ECB/2010/4 

of 10
 May 2010 concerning the management of pools of bilateral loans for the benefit of the Hellenic 
Republic and amending Decision ECB/2007/7.74The number of customers maintaining an ERMS business relationship with the Eurosystem was 296 in 2014, compared with 300 in 2013. With regard to the services themselves, in the course of 2014 the total aggregated holdings (which include cash assets and securities holdings) managed within the ERMS decreased by approximately 8% compared with the volume at the end of 2013. When the deposit facility rate became negative, the demand for cash services offered within the ERMS framework decreased sharply. At the end of July 2014 
the aggregated nominal figure for cash assets showed a decrease of •18 billion, when compared with end-June 2014 data, reflecting an accelerated cash outflow from the ERMS. At the same time, the holdings of euro-denominated securities kept 

with the ERMS registered a slight decrease of •3 billion. During the second half of 2014 the holdings of cash assets continued to decrease, while the amount of securities held within the ERMS steadily increased. These 
trends suggest that, after assessing the impact of the negative deposit facility rate, customers adjusted their portfolios accordingly.
753 Banknotes and coinsThe ECB and the euro area NCBs are responsible for issuing euro banknotes within the EU and for maintaining confidence in the currency. 
3.1 The circulation of banknotes and coins 
In 2014 both the number and value of euro banknotes in circulation grew by around 6%. At the end of the year there were 17.5 billion euro banknotes in circulation, with a total value of •1,016.5 billion (see Charts 30 and 31). The production of euro banknotes is shared by the NCBs, which were responsible for the production of 8.3 billion banknotes in 2014. It is estimated that, in terms of value, around a quarter of the euro banknotes in circulation are held outside the euro area, predominantly in countries neighbouring the euro area. In 2014 net shipments of euro banknotes by financial institutions to 
regions outside the euro area increased by 146%, or •19 billion. Euro banknotes, mainly high-value denominations, are held outside the euro area as a store of value and for settling transactions on international markets. In 2014 the total number of euro coins in circulation increased by 4.6%, standing at 110.9 billion. At the end of 2014 the value of coins in circulation stood at •25.0 billion, 
3.2% higher than at the end of 2013. In 2014 the euro area NCBs checked the authenticity and fitness for circulation of some 33.6 billion banknotes, withdrawing around 5.9 billion of them from circulation. The Eurosystem also continued its efforts to help banknote equipment manufacturers

handlers to check euro banknotes for authenticity and fitness prior to recirculation. Around 40% of the total number of euro banknotes that were put back into circulation in 2014 were processed by cash handlers using such machines. 3.2 Counterfeit euro banknotes In 2014 the Eurosystem withdrew some 838,000 counterfeit euro banknotes 
from circulation. When compared with the number of genuine euro banknotes in circulation, the proportion of counterfeits remains at a very low level. Long-term developments in the quantity of counterfeits removed from circulation are shown in Chart 32. Counterfeiters tend to target the •20 and •50 banknotes, which in 2014 accounted for 54.5% and 29.5% of total counterfeits respectively. The increase in the 
total number of counterfeits in the second half of 2014 was mainly driven by a rise in counterfeit •20 banknotes. Further details of the denominational breakdown are 
shown in Chart 33. The ECB continues to advise the public to remain alert to the possibility of fraud, to remember the ﬁfeel-look-tiltﬂ test, and never to rely on just one security feature. In addition, training is offered to professional cash handlers on a continuous basis, 
both in Europe and beyond, and up-to-date information material is made available to support the Eurosystem™s fight against counterfeiting. The ECB also cooperates with Europol, Interpol and the European Commission in pursuit of this goal. Chart 32Number of counterfeit euro banknotes recovered from circulation(thousands)050100150

Like the new •5 banknote, which entered circulation in May 2013, the new •10 banknote contains enhanced security features, 
including a portrait of Europa, a figure from Greek mythology, in the watermark and hologram. In the run-up to the introduction of the new •10 banknote, the ECB and the euro area NCBs conducted a campaign to inform both the public and professional cash handlers about the new banknote and its features. They also took several measures to help the banknote handling machine industry prepare for the 
introduction of the new banknote. In December 2014 the Governing Council decided that the new •20 banknote will be introduced on 25 November 2015. The other denominations of the Europa series will 
be introduced gradually over several years in ascending order. 
784 StatisticsThe ECB, assisted by the NCBs, develops, collects, compiles and disseminates a wide 
range of statistics which are important to support the monetary policy of the euro area, 
the supervisory functions of the ECB, various other tasks of the ESCB and the tasks 
of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). These statistics are also used by public 
authorities, financial market participants, the media and the general public. 
In 2014 the ESCB continued to provide regular euro area statistics in a smooth and timely manner. In addition, it devoted considerable efforts to implementing the new 
international standards in all ECB statistics, improving the accessibility of ESCB data and the availability and quality of granular data, and establishing a new collection framework supporting the ECB™s additional responsibility for banking supervision 

(see Section 3 of Chapter 1).4.1 New and enhanced euro area statistics
From October 2014 the ESCB started to produce statistics according to the new 
international and European statistical standards for national accounts and balance of payments statistics, a process which was coordinated with Eurostat and the European Statistical System (ESS) and which covers a wide range of ESCB and ESS statistics. The implementation of the European System of Accounts 2010 
(ESA 2010) and the sixth edition of the IMF™s Balance of Payments and International 
Investment Position Manual (BPM6) have led to an improved recording of financial 
and non-financial transactions and balance sheets in an increasingly globalised and 
interconnected economy.
4.2 Other statistical developmentsThe ESCB continued its work on enhancing the availability and quality of statistics on 
the basis of new or substantially improved micro-databases, as these provide more flexibility in meeting user needs and help to minimise the burden for reporting agents.In February 2014 the ECB adopted a legal act42 defining the preparatory work towards the step-by-step implementation of a long-term framework for the collection of granular credit data, i.e. data about the credit exposures of credit institutions or other loan-providing financial institutions vis-à-vis borrowers, based on harmonised ECB statistical reporting requirements. Work is ongoing on the final requirements and the final timetable for implementation.In November 2014 the ECB adopted a Regulation on the collection of money market statistics. It defines the reporting by credit institutions of their daily individual transactions relating to various segments of the money market with other MFIs, other non-bank financial institutions and the general government, as well as wholesale 42 Decision ECB/2014/6 of 24 February 2014 on the organisation of preparatory measures for the collection 
of granular credit data by the European System of Central Banks and the related Recommendation 

ECB/2014/7.79transactions with non-financial corporations.Other important micro-datasets continued to support the production of statistics in 2014. The security-by-security information contained in the Centralised Securities 

Database supported the production of new monthly statistical indicators on debt securities issuance and debt service by EU governments which were released in November 2014. Similarly, the new database on holdings of individual securities by 
institutional sectors as well as by the largest individual banking groups has been supplied since end-2013 by data collected by the ESCB, and it is expected to play a crucial role in enhancing the coverage and quality of statistics on securities.In November 2014 the ECB adopted a new Regulation43 on insurance corporations™ statistics, which allows the ECB essentially to re-use for monetary and financial stability purposes the data collected by supervisory authorities using the Solvency II quantitative reporting templates.In 2014 the ECB continued to provide statistical support to the ESRB. Among other 
things, it chaired the Contact Group on Data which coordinates this statistical work by bringing together the European Supervisory Authorities as well as representatives of 
the member countries of the ESRB Steering Committee.At the international level, the ECB takes an active role as co-chair of the Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities, which promotes inter-agency coordination 
and consistency in statistical practices, and as Vice-Chair of the Irving Fisher 
Committee on Central Banking Statistics, which contributes to the advancement of 
central bank statistics worldwide. Furthermore, the ESCB played a prominent role in the launch in November 2014 of the Special Data Dissemination Standard Plus, the third and highest tier of the IMF™s Data Standards Initiatives. Seven of the nine 
countries in the first cluster of adherents to the Fund™s initiative were EU Member 
States. This success reflects the continuous efforts of the ESCB Statistics Committee 

to enhance and broaden the base of European economic and financial statistics. 4.3 Accessibility of statistics Œ major steps in 2014
In October 2014 the ECB launched a new website called ﬁOur statisticsﬂ tailored to facilitate access to and the re-use of core euro area breakdowns and national statistics using visualisations. One of the functions it offers is the possibility to share the visualisations and integrate them into other websites and social media. Furthermore, in December 2014 a new tablet application called ﬁECBstatsAppﬂ was released, providing tablet users44 with easy access to statistics published in the ECB™s Statistical Data Warehouse in different formats, such as tables, charts and maps. The ECB also launched a new web service allowing professional and private users to automatically download large volumes of statistics into their own data 
systems on a frequent basis.43 Regulation ECB/2014/50 on statistical reporting requirements for insurance corporations.
44 The app is available for 
Android tablets
 and for iPads.805 Economic researchOne of the distinguishing features of central banks is that they have a long tradition of underpinning their policies with strong scientific foundations. In times of uncertainty and change, such as those currently being experienced, it is important that research pushes back frontiers by providing underpinnings for policies that have not been used before. The ECB continued to make considerable progress on this front in 2014. 
5.1 The ECB™s research clusters
Economic research at the ECB is conducted within 11 bank-wide research groups 
covering different topics of policy relevance. In 2014 research focused on five 
major areas: (i) financial instability and macro-prudential policies; (ii) monetary transmission, with an emphasis on non-standard monetary policy measures; (iii) the changing economic and financial structure since the crisis and its implications for growth; (iv) the interaction of monetary, fiscal and supervisory policies amid 
a changing EU institutional framework (notably the establishment of the SSM); and (v) forecasting, scenario analysis and country surveillance tools.Important findings emerged in particular from research on the effectiveness of 
non-standard measures in the euro area. For instance, evidence collected around 
the announcements on the Outright Monetary Transactions suggests that those 
announcements may have had a positive impact on GDP and credit in stressed 
countries. Changes in collateral eligibility rules Œ as introduced by the additional credit claims programme of February 2012 Œ in combination with the very long-term refinancing operations also appear to have supported the economy by reducing the 
yields on, and increasing the purchases of, the targeted assets (corporate loans). Furthermore, an analysis of the possible effects of an asset purchase programme 
indicates that such a programme can be useful for managing risks to price stability also in circumstances in which there is no severe financial instability. Purchases 
of assets with higher yield premiums appear to be more effective in supporting the 
economy but also potentially riskier for the central bank.A wide range of models and tools were developed in 2014 within the various 
research areas mentioned above. One such tool assesses the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations stemming from a spillover of short-term to long-term 
expectations. Results for the euro area suggest that this risk increased significantly around January 2014 and remained high until the end of the year.
5.2 The Eurosystem/ESCB research networks
Eurosystem/ESCB research networks continued to make a significant contribution in 2014.45 An important milestone was reached in June with the conclusion of the work of the Macro-prudential Research Network, which had been established in 45 See the ECB™s website for detailed information on each network. 
812010 to develop better analytical underpinnings for the new area of macro-prudential policy.46 One of the network™s key contributions has been the development of a series of macroeconomic models featuring financial instability, something that was virtually absent from the economic literature before the crisis. These developments provide the necessary tools for a meaningful analysis of macro-prudential policies, such as in the case of a new model that incorporates bank defaults and allows the assessment of both the benefits and the costs of capital adequacy regulation. The network also developed a coincident indicator of systemic financial instability, the now widely used composite indicator of systemic stress, and several early warning 
models for systemic banking crises, confirming the important role of credit growth and leverage. Finally, the network derived Œ in cooperation with payment systems experts Œ information on the unsecured money market from the TARGET2 system. The data can be used to calculate indicators and assess developments relating to the euro money market, notably cross-border bank contagion risks and aspects of 
the systemic importance of banks. One finding was that the impact of bank risk and excess liquidity provided by the Eurosystem on interbank market activity depends crucially on the fiscal health of the country in which borrowing banks reside. A second network
 Œ the Competitiveness Network Œ produced a new database based on non-financial corporations™ balance sheets. A major finding in this context is that, 
despite the drop in employment, the recent crisis may have had ﬁcleansing effectsﬂ 
on EU economies, as it appears to have accelerated resource reallocation towards the most productive firms, particularly in economies under stress. The crisis may 
also have caused the share of credit-constrained firms to increase at different rates 

across countries and along the percentiles of the productivity distribution, with the most productive firms not suffering from credit
 rationing.A third network Œ the Household Finance and Consumption Network Œ focused on 
the analysis of data made available by the Eurosystem™s Household Finance and 
Consumption Survey. Research was conducted on euro area households™ financial 
fragility, the distributional effects of inflation and monetary policy, cross-country 
differences in household wealth distribution, and the recent evolution of wealth, 
income and debt service. A major finding is that, while the mortgage debt service/
income ratios of individual households generally declined after the crisis, the fall was 
counteracted by the rise in unemployment and resulting drop in income.Finally, a previous ESCB network Œ the Wage Dynamics Network Œ was re-
established to conduct a third wave of the survey on firms™ price and wage policies. 
This wave aimed to assess how firms have adjusted in response to the crisis and to enable an evaluation of the relevance of recent labour market reforms in shaping these adjustments. The survey data have been collected and country-specific studies 
are ongoing.46 A complete summary of the network™s research output and conclusions can be found in its 
final report
. The ECB is involved in macro-prudential policy through its role in the European Systemic Risk Board 

and through the macro-prudential competencies of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (see Section 3 of 

Chapter 1).825.3 Conferences and publications
The ECB continued to be active in the organisation of research events. In addition to a large number of invited speaker seminars, the ECB hosted and/or co-organised several high-level conferences. Important events included the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, the concluding conference of the Macro-prudential Research Network and the International Research Forum on 
Monetary Policy. A large proportion of the ECB™s research output 

was published. In total, 131 new papers appeared in the ECB™s Working Paper Series in 2014, and 58 
ECB contributions featured in international refereed journals.ECB Working Papers in 201458131New papers featured in international refereed journals Published 
in the Working Paper SeriesECB Working Papers in 2014
836 Legal activities and dutiesIn 2014 the ECB adopted a number of legal acts and instruments in the area  of monetary policy and central banking, as well as in relation to its newly assumed supervisory responsibilities. The ECB also adopted numerous opinions in response 
to the Treaty-based requirement for the ECB to be consulted on any proposed EU act 
or draft national legislation falling within its fields of competence. In addition, the ECB took part in several judicial proceedings before the European courts. 6.1 Legal developments related to the SSM
As part of its new supervisory responsibilities, the ECB in 2014 adopted several legal 
acts in relation to the establishment of the SSM, most of which are discussed in the ECB Annual Report on supervisory activities 2014. From an institutional perspective, 
the following legal acts related to the establishment of the SSM are of relevance. In line with Article
 25 of the SSM Regulation, the Governing Council adopted,  in addition to the measures already taken regarding the separation between  monetary policy and supervisory tasks under Article 25, a Decision on separation47. This Decision contains, in particular, provisions relating to professional secrecy and the exchange of information between the two policy areas. The Decision entered into force on 18 October 2014. The ECB Decision on close cooperation48 was adopted by the Governing Council and entered into force on 27 February 2014. On the basis of Article 7 of the SSM Regulation, according to which non-euro area EU Member States may participate in the SSM under a regime of close cooperation, the Decision sets out the procedural aspects of close cooperation between the ECB and the competent authorities of a participating Member State.The Governing Council amended the ECB™s Rules of Procedure 
on 22 January 201449 in order to set out in detail the relationship between the Governing Council and the Supervisory Board as required by the SSM Regulation. In particular, the revised rules establish the interaction between the Governing Council and the Supervisory Board within the non-objection procedure. Under this 
procedure, draft decisions by the Supervisory Board will be deemed adopted unless the Governing Council objects within a defined period of time, not exceeding ten working days. Moreover, certain rules governing the Supervisory Board™s procedures have been incorporated into the ECB™s Rules of Procedure. On 31 March 2014 the 
Supervisory Board adopted its own Rules of Procedure50, after having consulted the 47 Decision ECB/2014/39 of 17 September 2014 on the implementation of separation between the 
monetary policy and supervision functions of the European Central Bank, OJ L 300, 18.10.2014, p. 57.48 Decision ECB/2014/5 of 31 January 2014 on the close cooperation with the national competent 

authorities of participating Member States whose currency is not the euro, OJ L 198, 5.7.2014, p. 7.49 Decision ECB/2014/1 of 22 January 2014 amending Decision ECB/2004/2 adopting the Rules of 

Procedure of the European Central Bank, OJ L 95, 29.3.2014, p. 56.50 Decision of 31 March 2014 establishing the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, 

OJ L 182, 21.6.2014, p. 56.84Governing Council. They supplement the ECB™s Rules of Procedure and also include rules concerning the composition of the Steering Committee.Under the SSM Regulation, the Governing Council is to establish and publish a Code of Conduct for the ECB staff and management involved in banking 
supervision. The ECB has adopted rules of ethical conduct as part of a general 
review of the Ethics Framework that applies to all ECB staff. These rules entered 
into force on 1 January 2015 and take account of the requirement under the SSM Regulation that comprehensive and formal procedures and proportionate periods are to be established and maintained in order to assess in advance, and prevent, possible conflicts of interest of ECB staff members engaged in supervisory activities 

resulting from subsequent employment. As codes of conduct are in place for both 
the Executive Board and the Governing Council, it was decided that a separate code was also required for the Supervisory Board. This Code of Conduct was 
approved by the Supervisory Board on 12 November 2014 and entered into force on 13 November 2014. Its purpose is to provide a general framework of high ethical 
standards which the members of the Supervisory Board and other participants in Supervisory Board meetings must observe and to establish concrete procedures  to deal with, for example, potential conflicts of interest.6.2 ECB participation in judicial proceedings at the EU level
The ECB also took part in various judicial proceedings at the EU level. On 6 February 2014 the Court of Justice of the European Union dismissed the appeal 
of Gabi Thesing and Bloomberg Finance LP against the ECB in case C-28/13
 P. The 
decision of the General Court of the EU in its judgement of 29 November 2012 that the ECB was entitled to refuse access to two internal documents related to the public deficit and the public debt of Greece was confirmed. The European courts 
agreed with the ECB™s defence that their disclosure would have specifically and 
effectively undermined the protection of the public interest as regards the economic 

policy of the EU and of Greece, and that the risk of that undermining was reasonably foreseeable and not purely hypothetical. The Court recognised that the ECB enjoys 
wide discretion in assessing whether the disclosure of ECB documents undermines the public interest as regards the economic, financial or monetary policy of the EU or of a Member State.By way of, among other things, a constitutional complaint, the Outright Monetary Transactions detailed in an ECB press release on
 6 September 2012 were brought 
before the German Federal Constitutional Court. Following a hearing in June 2013, the Constitutional Court decided on 14 January 2014 to request a preliminary ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union based on a set of questions on the interpretation of several provisions of EU law. As a follow-up, the Court of Justice 
conducted a hearing on 14 October 2014. The Advocate General of the Court of 
Justice delivered his opinion on 14 January 2015, and the preliminary ruling by the Court of Justice can be expected in the first half of 2015. On the basis of the 
preliminary ruling, the German Federal Constitutional Court will deliver its final judgement on the compatibility of the Outright Monetary Transactions with the 
German constitution. 85In the course of 2014 several depositors and shareholders of Cypriot credit institutions filed lawsuits against the ECB and other EU institutions, asking for damages and/or requesting the annulment of acts that they deemed to have led to the restructuring of these credit institutions in the context of the financial assistance programme for Cyprus. The General Court dismissed
 12 of these cases in their entirety as inadmissible. The involvement of the ECB in the process leading up to 
the conclusion of the financial assistance programme was limited to the provision of technical advice, pursuant to the Treaty establishing the European Stability 

Mechanism, acting in liaison with the European Commission, and the issuance of a non-binding opinion on the Cypriot draft resolution law.
51In 2014 holders of Greek government bonds continued to engage in litigation against the ECB. Applicants alleged that they had suffered financial loss and been 
deprived of their fundamental rights to property and economic freedom following the enactment of legislation by the Greek Parliament in February 2012 which led to a partial restructuring of Greece™s sovereign debt. The overall role of the ECB in the 
context of this restructuring was merely advisory and within the boundaries of its mandate under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The General 
Court has already ruled in favour of the ECB in the context of one dispute with Greek 
government bond holders, with the latter failing to establish direct and individual concern Œ an essential condition for admissibility of every action. No appeal has been filed with the Court of Justice. 6.3 ECB opinions and cases of non-compliance
Articles 127(4) and 282(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 

require that the ECB be consulted on any proposed EU or draft national legislation falling within its fields of competence.52 All ECB opinions are published on the ECB™s 
website. ECB opinions on proposed EU legislation are also published in the Official Journal of the European Union. In 2014 the ECB adopted 11
 opinions on proposed EU legislation and 81 opinions on draft national legislation falling within the ECB™s fields of competence. 
A significant number of consultations by national authorities concerned measures 
relating to financial market stability.
53 The ECB adopted opinions in relation to, among other things, consumer loan contracts denominated in forint or in foreign currency 
entered into by private persons in Hungary,54 a draft law establishing a systemic risk committee in Luxembourg,55 a draft law establishing a special legal framework for the treatment of deferred tax assets of companies and state-owned enterprises, including 51 See Case T-289/13 Ledra Advertising Ltd v Commission and ECB, 2014, paragraph 45.
52 The United Kingdom is exempt from the consultation obligation, pursuant to the Protocol on certain 
provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is annexed to the 

Treaty, OJ C 83, 30.3.2010, p. 284.53 See e.g. CON/2014/16, CON/2014/29, CON/2014/39, CON/2014/46, CON/2014/59, CON/2014/60, 

CON/2014/61, CON/2014/66 and CON/2014/67.54 CON/2014/59, CON/2014/72, CON/2014/76, CON/2014/85 and CON/2014/87.
55 CON/2014/46.86credit institutions, that are liable for corporation tax,56 measures accompanying the SSM Regulation in Austria,57 a framework for the resolution of credit and other institutions,58 the implementation of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive,59 and public access to specific information concerning the bad loans of certain banks60. In the context of central bank independence, the ECB commented on, among other things, legislative provisions on the remuneration of members of an NCB™s decision-
making bodies and its employees,61 on changes in the governance of the Banca d™Italia,62 on the use of funds resulting from a possible reduction in the remuneration of staff and members of decision-making bodies at the Banca d™Italia,63 and on the conflict of interest rules for senior officials of the Banco de España64.Other ECB opinions related to a draft law concerning the rounding of payments 
denominated in euro in Belgium,65 and to the amendments of the Rules of Procedure of the Slovak Parliament, which aim to ensure the proper and timely consultation of the ECB on draft legislative provisions proposed by Members of Parliament and parliamentary committees66. 25 cases of non-compliance with the obligation to consult were recorded, with the 
following cases being considered clear and important67. The Belgian authorities did not consult the ECB on an amendment to the Law 
of 21 December 1994 on various social provisions with a view to introducing 
complementary indicators intended to measure the quality of life, human development, social progress and the sustainability of the domestic economy. 
An obligation was imposed on the Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique to publish in its Annual Report a summary of the results of the 
complementary indicators compiled by the National Account Institute. 
Although the ECB was consulted by the Cypriot Ministry of Finance on certain draft amendments to the Resolution of Credit and Other Institutions Law, the amendments 
were voted into law before the ECB issued its opinion68 on the subject.56 CON/2014/66.57 CON/2014/43.58 CON/2014/60.59 CON/2014/67.60 CON/2014/39.61 CON/2014/7, CON/2014/12 and CON/2014/38.
62 CON/2014/19.63 CON/2014/38.64 CON/2014/22.65 CON/2014/6.66 CON/2014/54.67 These include (i) cases where a national authority failed to submit draft legislative provisions within the 
ECB™s field of competence for consultation to the ECB; and (ii) cases where a national authority formally 

consulted the ECB, but did not afford it sufficient time to examine the draft legislative provisions and to 

adopt its opinion prior to adoption of these provisions.68 CON/2014/60.87The ECB was consulted on draft amendments to the Law on the establishment of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund. However, the Greek Parliament adopted the draft 
amendments only a few days later, before the ECB could issue the relevant opinion
69. The following Greek legislation was not submitted to the ECB for consultation at all: 
Law No 4281/2014, related to the role of the Bank of Greece in ensuring compliance with the Code of Conduct for the management of non-performing private debt, the Law on out-of-court restructuring of corporate debt vis-à-vis financial institutions provisions70, an amendment71 to Law No 3213/2003 which, among other things, imposed an asset declaration obligation on the Governor, Vice-Governors, executive directors and directors of the Bank of Greece, and Law No 4308/2014 on Greek accounting standards and related provisions which affect the Bank of Greece. Draft legislative provisions on deferred tax assets of legal entities, including credit institutions, as well as amendments thereto, were submitted to the ECB for consultation but enacted prior to the adoption by the ECB of its opinion on the matter. The ECB was not consulted by the Luxembourg authorities on the Law of 28 July 2014 on the immobilisation of shares and corporate units issued in bearer form. The Hungarian draft law on certain measures relating to consumer loan contracts, as well as the draft law on the rules applicable to specific consumer loan contracts, were 
submitted to the ECB for consultation, but enacted shortly thereafter, before the ECB 
could adopt its opinions72. Likewise, the Hungarian authorities did not afford the ECB sufficient time to adopt its opinions on a draft law establishing a resolution framework 
for credit institutions and investment firms, a draft law on the general terms and conditions of consumer loan contracts and a draft law on the conversion of foreign exchange loans.73In addition, the failures to consult the ECB by Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, 
 Italy and Slovenia were considered to be clear and repetitive cases. 6.4 Compliance with the prohibition of monetary financing 
 and privileged accessPursuant to Article 271(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 

the ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring the compliance of the EU NCBs and the ECB with the prohibitions implied by Articles 123 and 124 of the Treaty and 
Council Regulations (EC) Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93. Article 123 prohibits the ECB 
and the NCBs from providing overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility to governments and EU institutions or bodies, as well as from purchasing in the 69 CON/2014/29.70 The relevant provisions are incorporated into Law 4307/2014 transposing three Council framework 
decisions on the application of the principle of mutual recognition in criminal matters, Government 

Gazette Vol. A 246/15.11.2014.71 Law on measures for the support and growth of the Greek economy, organisational matters of the 

Ministry of Finance and other provisions (Government Gazette Vol. A 160/8.8.2014).72 CON/2014/59 and CON/2014/72. 73 CON/2014/62, CON/2014/85 and CON/2014/87. 
88primary market debt instruments issued by these institutions. Article 124 prohibits 
any measure, not based on prudential considerations, which establishes privileged access by governments and EU institutions or bodies to financial institutions. In parallel with the Governing Council, the European Commission monitors Member States™ compliance with the above provisions. 
The ECB also monitors the EU central banks™ secondary market purchases of debt 
instruments issued by the domestic public sector, the public sector of other Member 
States and EU institutions and bodies. According to the recitals of Council Regulation 
(EC) No 3603/93, the acquisition of public sector debt instruments in the secondary market must not be used to circumvent the objective of Article 123 of the Treaty. 

Such purchases should not become a form of indirect monetary financing of the public sector.
The monitoring exercise conducted for 2014 confirms that the provisions of Articles 
123 and 124 of the Treaty and the related Council Regulations were in general 
respected. The monitoring exercise revealed that not all EU national central banks have remuneration policies for public sector deposits in place that fully comply with the remuneration ceilings74. In particular, a few NCBs need to ensure that the ceiling for 
the remuneration of public sector deposits is the unsecured overnight interest rate 
even when the latter is negative. The reduction of IBRC-related assets by the Central Bank of Ireland during 2014 is a step in the direction of the necessary full disposal of these assets. However, a more 
ambitious sales schedule, in particular for the long-duration floating rate notes, would further mitigate the persisting serious monetary financing concerns. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) launched several programmes not related to monetary policy, including a real estate investment programme, a programme to 
promote financial literacy and a programme of purchases of Hungarian artworks and cultural property, as well as transferring staff formerly employed by the Hungarian 
Financial Supervisory Authority to the MNB. Given the multitude of programmes, their 

scope and their size, these programmes could be perceived as potentially in conflict with the monetary financing prohibition, to the extent that they could be viewed as the MNB taking over state tasks or otherwise conferring financial benefits on the state. The ECB will closely monitor these operations with a view to ensuring that their 
implementation does not lead to a conflict with the prohibition of monetary financing.74 These ceilings are included in Decision ECB/2014/8 on the prohibition of monetary financing and the 
remuneration of government deposits by national central banks and Guideline ECB/2014/9 on domestic 

asset and liability management operations by the national central banks, as amended by Guideline 

ECB/2014/22.897 Institutional environment7.1 Euro area enlargementAdoption of the euro in Lithuania Œ a major step in European integrationOn 23 July 2014 the EU Council adopted a Decision allowing Lithuania to introduce 
the euro as its currency from 1 January 2015, increasing the number of euro area countries from 18 to 19. The Council™s Decision was based on the convergence reports published by the ECB and the European Commission in June 2014, and followed discussions by the European Council, an opinion of the European 
Parliament, a proposal from the European Commission and a recommendation by 
the Eurogroup. On the same day, the EU Council also adopted a 
Regulation fixing 
the irrevocable conversion rate between the Lithuanian litas and the euro. This 
conversion rate was set at LTL 3.45280 to the euro, which was equal to the central rate of the Lithuanian litas throughout Lithuania™s membership of the exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II).The logistics of the cash changeover Œ a successful operationOn 1 January 2015 Lithuania adopted the euro as its currency. The cash changeover 

went smoothly and, following a two-week period during which Lithuanian litas and euro cash circulated in parallel, the euro banknotes and coins became the sole legal tender in Lithuania. The Deutsche Bundesbank, which acted as the logistical counterpart, provided 132 million banknotes worth •4.76 billion. Lietuvos bankas, the central bank of Lithuania, will repay that loan in the form of banknotes in 2016. Lietuvos bankas procured 370 million euro coins worth •120.6 million from the Lithuanian Mint. In terms of value, 12% of the borrowed euro banknotes and nearly 55% of the procured euro coins were distributed to banks before the changeover date so that they could fill ATMs and provide retailers and other professional cash handlers with 
euro cash. In addition, about 900,000 starter kits, each containing euro coins with a 
value of •11.59, were distributed to the general public, helping to reduce the amount 
of change to be kept by retailers in the first few days of January. 
From 1 January 2015, for a period of six months, litas can be exchanged for euro at the fixed exchange rate free of charge at all bank branches providing cash services. Many post office branches and some credit unions provided the same service 
for 60 days after the changeover date. Lietuvos bankas will continue to redeem Lithuanian litas banknotes and coins for an unlimited period of time. 90The information campaign on the introduction of the euroThe ECB worked closely with Lietuvos bankas to prepare a comprehensive information campaign to familiarise the general public and cash handlers with the visual appearance and security features of the euro banknotes and to provide information on key facts and dates related to the changeover. 
The communication tools included a mass media campaign involving two television 
commercials, print, outdoor and online advertising, different types of printed publication
, dedicated internet pages and the ECB™s Euro Exhibition, which was held at the Palace 

of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in Vilnius from 23 October 2014 to 5 January 2015. 
Communication partners (mainly banks, supermarkets, public authorities and large 
retail chains) were given access to material produced by the ECB, which they could 

pass on to their customers and employees. 
In addition to the measures targeted at the general public, a high-level conference aimed at representatives of government, civil society and the media was held on 25 September 2014 with the participation of the President of the ECB, the Chairman of the Board of Lietuvos bankas, the European Commission Vice-President 
 for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro, and the Prime Minister and Finance 
Minister of Lithuania. 7.2 The integration of Lietuvos bankas into the Eurosystem
Legal aspectsPursuant to Article
 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 
the ECB reviewed the statute of Lietuvos bankas and other relevant Lithuanian legislation for compliance with Article
 131 of the Treaty. The ECB made a favourable 
assessment of the compatibility of Lithuanian legislation with the Treaty and with the 
Statute of the ESCB. The ECOFIN Council consulted the ECB on its proposals to amend the Council 
regulations which enabled the introduction of the euro in Lithuania and determined 
the irrevocably fixed exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis the Lithuanian litas. The ECB 
welcomed the proposed regulations and noted that they would enable the introduction 
of the euro as the currency of Lithuania following the abrogation of Lithuania™s 
derogation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article
 140(2) of the Treaty.
The ECB and Lietuvos bankas put in place a number of legal instruments with a view to ensuring the integration of Lietuvos bankas into the Eurosystem on 1 January 2015. The ECB adopted the necessary legal instruments to provide 
for the paying-up of the remaining capital and the transfer of foreign reserves to the ECB and established the banknote allocation key applicable from 1 January 2015. 
Pursuant to Article
 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Governing Council adopted a recommendation on Lietuvos bankas™ external auditors for the annual accounts 
starting from the financial year 2015. The ECB also reviewed its legal framework 
and introduced, where necessary, amendments resulting from Lietuvos bankas™ 
membership of the Eurosystem. This included a review of Lithuanian legislation 
91implementing the Eurosystem™s legal framework for monetary policy and TARGET2, 
which enabled Lithuanian counterparties to participate in the Eurosystem™s open 
market operations from 2 January 2015. The ECB also adopted a Decision on 
transitional provisions for the application of minimum reserves by the ECB following the introduction of the euro in Lithuania. Finally, the ERM II Agreement was 
terminated for Lietuvos bankas.The introduction of the euro in Lithuania and the integration of its central bank into the Eurosystem also required changes to some Lithuanian legal instruments. The 
ECB was consulted on national legislation governing the euro changeover and the minimum reserves framework.Operational aspectsThe ECB also conducted technical preparations with a view to fully integrating 
Lietuvos bankas into the Eurosystem. In line with the provisions of the Treaty, 
Lietuvos bankas joined the Eurosystem with exactly the same rights and obligations as the NCBs of the EU Member States that had already adopted the euro. The technical preparations for the integration of Lietuvos bankas into the Eurosystem covered a wide range of areas, notably financial reporting and accounting, monetary policy operations, foreign reserve management and foreign exchange operations, payment systems, statistics and banknote production. In the field of operations, preparations involved extensive testing of the instruments, procedures and technical systems for the implementation of monetary policy and foreign exchange operations. With effect from
 1 January 2015, 90 Lithuanian credit institutions, a list of which is published on the ECB™s website
, became subject to the Eurosystem™s reserve requirements. The entry of Lithuania into the euro area changed the liquidity conditions in the Eurosystem only slightly. The aggregate reserve requirements of euro area credit institutions increased by 0.15% (•154 million). Net autonomous liquidity factors in Lithuania for the period from 1 to 27 February 2015 were liquidity-absorbing, increasing the liquidity deficit of the entire euro area banking sector 
by 0.8% (•4.1 billion) on average. Contribution to the ECB™s capital and foreign reserve assets
Lietuvos bankas™ total subscribed share in the ECB™s capital amounts to •44.7
 million, 
equivalent to 0.4132% of the ECB™s subscribed capital of •10.825
 billion as at 1 January 2015. Upon joining the ESCB on 1 May 2004, Lietuvos bankas paid up 7% of its share of the subscribed capital of the ECB as a contribution to the ECB™s operational costs; in conjunction with the ECB™s capital increase 
on 29 December 2010 this contribution was reduced to 3.75%. In accordance with Article 48.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, Lietuvos bankas paid up the remaining part of its subscription, equal to •43.1 million, on 1 January 2015.Lithuania transferred its contribution to the foreign reserve assets of the ECB at the beginning of January 2015 (85% of which was in US dollars and 15% in gold). 92In order to reduce overall costs, improve efficiency and create a portfolio with an 
appropriate size in relation to the total amount of the ECB™s foreign reserve assets 
invested in US dollars, Lietuvos bankas decided to pool its contribution with the foreign reserves of the Banco de Portugal, sharing all functions and responsibilities in the management of the joint portfolio, as other NCBs have done in the past. Rotation of voting rights in the Governing CouncilThe entry of Lithuania into the euro area and the participation of the Chairman of the Board of Lietuvos bankas in the Governing Council triggered the implementation of rotating voting rights in the Governing Council as foreseen in Article
 10.2 of the Statute of the ESCB. The Statute and 
Decision ECB/2008/29 of 18 December 200875 establish that as soon as there are 19 governors represented in the Governing Council, the number of members who have a voting right is limited to 21. As the members of the Executive Board are not subject to the rotation, this means that the governors share on a rotating basis the remaining 15 votes. For this purpose, governors have been placed in two groups on the basis of economic and financial factors. The first group consists of five governors and shares four voting rights, while the second group comprises all the other governors and shares the 
remaining 11 votes. The rotation period is set at one month, which means that the composition of voting members will change every month (according to a schedule). 75 This Decision postponed the start of the rotation of voting rights in the Governing Council.

Frequently Asked Questions on the ECB™s website. 948 International and European relations
8.1 European relationsAs Europe continued to deal with the legacy of the economic and financial crisis, the ECB maintained its close dialogue with European institutions and fora, in particular with the European Parliament, the European Council, the ECOFIN Council, the Eurogroup and the European Commission. 2014 saw decisive steps to address financial sector fragmentation and the repair of the financial sector in the euro area with the agreement on the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) between the EU Council and the European Parliament and the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). At the same time, 
the economic situation in the euro area shaped the agendas of Eurogroup and ECOFIN Council meetings, in which the President of the ECB and other members 
of its Executive Board participated regularly. The need for a coherent strategy for 
monetary, fiscal, financial and structural policies in order to restore growth in Europe 
featured prominently in the European Council meetings and Euro Summits to which 
the President of the ECB was invited. The Euro Summit of 24 October 2014 called on the President of the Commission, in close cooperation with the President of the Euro Summit, the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the ECB, to prepare the next steps on better economic governance in the euro area in order ﬁto develop concrete mechanisms for stronger economic policy coordination, convergence and solidarityﬂ.8.1.1 2014 Œ a new start for EuropeIn 2014 European citizens were asked to elect a new European Parliament. It was the first time that Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union was put into practice 
and that the European Parliament elected, and did not simply approve, the President of the new European Commission. The new Commission, presided over by Jean-
Claude Juncker, took office on 1 November 2014. On
 6 November 2014 the Commission Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, Valdis Dombrovskis, 
participated in the meeting of the ECB™s Governing Council. The Commission™s 
internal structure was changed considerably. Among other things, the need for 

companies to have access to more diversified sources of financing was reflected in the creation of a new Directorate General for Financial Stability, Financial Services 
and Capital Markets Union, which has been given the task of helping to create an EU capital markets union. In addition, the European Council elected Donald Tusk as 
its second permanent President, who will again also serve as President of the Euro 
Summit. The ECB is primarily held accountable for its actions by the democratically elected representatives of European citizens in the European Parliament. In 2014 the ECB™s President attended four regular hearings of the Committee on Economic and 
Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, which took place on 
3 March,  9514 July, 22 September and 17 November. The ECB™s non-standard monetary policy measures, the worsening economic outlook including low inflation, and persistent financial fragmentation continued to be of great interest for MEPs at these hearings. At the hearing on 3 March, the President thanked the outgoing MEPs for their constructive role on a number of legislative dossiers. In addition to the President™s regular hearings, the Vice-President of the ECB presented the ECB™s Annual Report for 2013 to the committee on 7 April 2014, and the Parliament adopted its resolution on the matter on 25 February 2015. The ECB also discharges its accountability obligations through regular reporting and by answering written questions from MEPs. In 2014 the ECB replied to 46 questions 
by MEPs and published the replies on its website. Most of the questions focused on the implementation of the ECB™s monetary policy, the economic outlook and the 
situation in countries under an EU-IMF macroeconomic adjustment programme. In 2014 the European Parliament concluded a high-level own-initiative report on the work of the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB in relation to these programmes. Executive Board member Benoît Cœuré participated in an exchange of views on 13 February 2014 to explain the ECB™s role in this context. He also participated in the European Parliamentary Week on the European Semester for Economic Policy Coordination. In addition, the ECB provided input into the discussions of the European Parliament and the EU Council on legislative proposals falling within its fields of competence by explaining its legal opinions to relevant counterparts, for example in the cases of the SRM Regulation or the Payment Services Directive II. 8.1.2 Inter-institutional relations on the ECB™s supervisory tasks
The SSM Regulation, which outlines the ECB™s responsibilities with regard to 
banking supervision, also sets out a robust accountability framework for the ECB vis-à-vis the European Parliament and the EU Council concerning the related tasks. This framework is further detailed in an inter-institutional agreement between 
the European Parliament and the ECB, and in a Memorandum of Understanding between the EU Council and the ECB. In the context of this framework, the Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB attended two regular public hearings in 2014 (18 March and 3 November) and two ad hoc exchanges of views (4 February and 3 November) with the Committee 
on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In addition, the ECB regularly transmitted to 
the committee the confidential records of proceedings of its Supervisory Board meetings. Ten replies to written questions posed by MEPs were published on the ECB™s website.With regard to the EU Council, the Chair of the Supervisory Board attended ECOFIN Council and Eurogroup meetings on four occasions in 2014, and from 4 November began discharging her duties of accountability towards the Council through the Eurogroup. 968.2 International relationsAgainst the background of a very dynamic and at times challenging international environment, the ECB participated in discussions of international institutions and fora which deal with global economic, financial and monetary issues. The ECB 
also further developed its bilateral relations with central banks in advanced and emerging economies. Discussions at the global level on the subject of central banks™ actions demonstrated 
a broad consensus that the accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies, including unconventional monetary policy measures, had been supportive of the global recovery. At the same time, there was recognition of the 
need to remain mindful of unintended consequences and potential spillover effects 

on other countries, in particular as some advanced economies move towards monetary normalisation. 8.2.1 G20Amid the subdued global economic recovery, discussions in the G20 focused on 
the need to foster global growth and to tackle near-term risks to the economic outlook. In that context, at their summit in Brisbane, the G20 leaders remained resolute in their commitment to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth and to create new jobs. In line with the objective set in February in Sydney, G20 
members presented growth strategies aimed at raising their aggregate GDP level by 
(at least) 2% within five years. Those commitments, along with other measures to 
lift investment (such as the Global Infrastructure Initiative also agreed in Brisbane), 
to increase trade and competition, to boost employment and to strengthen the stability of the financial system and fairness of the international tax system, should support sustainable and inclusive development. In their Brisbane Action Plan, G20 
leaders stressed that G20 members will hold each other accountable for delivering on those commitments.8.2.2 Policy issues related to the IMF and the international financial architectureThe ECB contributed to discussions at the IMF on the international financial architecture and supported the coordination of common European positions in this respect. Drawing lessons from the crisis and thereby helping to reduce the likelihood of severe future crises was the focal point of many discussions. The IMF™s 2014 Triennial Surveillance Review took stock of the contribution of 
IMF surveillance to the Fund™s ultimate goal of promoting global economic and 
financial stability. It is vital that Fund surveillance and advice fully reflect the specific 
policy-making frameworks and respective competences of individual EU Member States, as well as at the euro area and the EU level, with a view to providing more consistent and effective surveillance, also in the light of the recent reforms to 

strengthen European economic governance and surveillance, notably in the euro 97area. EU central banks elaborated on this topic in a report by the Task Force on IMF Issues of the International Relations Committee of the ESCB. In 2014 the IMF made some modifications to its precautionary lending instruments with the backing of EU Member States. These instruments, including the flexible credit line and the precautionary and liquidity line, were introduced from 2009 in response to the global financial crisis as a way of strengthening the IMF™s crisis prevention toolkit and bolstering confidence in qualifying members. They play a useful role in the global financial safety net while complementing the efforts of countries to further strengthen 
the resilience of their economies. EU Member States have pointed to the need for the IMF to remain strong and adequately resourced, and affirmed the importance of the IMF as a quota-based institution. However, far-reaching reforms of the Fund™s quotas and governance agreed in 2010 remain pending, holding up discussions on the next General Review of Quotas. All EU Member States have ratified the 2010 Quota and 
Governance Reform and consider the implementation of these reforms by all IMF members a priority. IMF members also considered a possible direction for reform of the Fund™s lending framework in the context of sovereign debt vulnerabilities. From an EU perspective, any changes should aim to strengthen the Fund™s lending framework. 8.2.3 Technical cooperation
The ECB continued to broaden its technical cooperation with central banks 
outside the EU, with a focus on central banks in countries that have the prospect of joining the EU and in G20 emerging market economies. In the former case, the cooperation aims to enhance the technical readiness of central banks to assume the roles and obligations of a future ESCB member. The ECB has launched a 
Eurosystem cooperation programme offering a needs analysis with the Central 
Bank of Montenegro and another with the Bank of Albania, the Central Bank of 
the Republic of Kosovo and the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. These activities are implemented jointly with the NCBs and are funded by the EU. 
Technical cooperation complements the ECB™s regular monitoring and analysis of EU candidate and potential candidate countries and the policy dialogue with their central banks. In addition, the ECB started to organise regional seminars on issues of mutual interest. Furthermore, the ECB and the National Bank of Serbia in July 
signed a Cooperation Agreement for the prevention and detection of counterfeit 
euro banknotes in Serbia. In a global context, the ECB continued to develop its cooperation with G20 emerging market economies on the basis of Memoranda of Understanding. These activities have a technical as well as a policy component, aiming to support a better understanding of ECB policies and to share technical expertise and best practices in central banking.989 External communicationExplaining monetary policy and banking supervision to  European citizensToday central bank communication is right at the heart of monetary policy; indeed, 
 it is a monetary policy tool in itself. A transparent central bank can implement its 
policy more effectively. If the general public and financial markets can understand 
how the ECB is likely to respond in a given situation, they can form reasonable expectations about future monetary policy. This allows changes in monetary policy to 
rapidly feed into financial variables, which in turn can shorten the process whereby monetary policy is transmitted to investment and consumption decisions and accelerate any necessary economic adjustments. The ECB™s communication in
 2014 was shaped in particular by the need to communicate monetary policy in challenging times and to build the SSM. Building trust: communicating monetary policyBuilding trust among the 338 million citizens of the euro area is a major 

communication challenge. The ECB operates as of
 1 January 2015 across 
19 countries using 16 different languages. It deals with this plurality by making use 
of the inherent advantage of having 19 national central banks in the Eurosystem Œ 
that is, having colleagues in each country that can ensure that the ECB™s messages 
are heard and understood in the local context. The ECB also plays its part in 
building trust by opening up to the public. From the outset, the ECB has taken a 
lead in terms of transparency. It was the first major central bank to offer regular 

press conferences after every monetary policy meeting. Every month, the ECB 
receives and answers roughly 4,000 enquiries from the general public. 
 But in these challenging times, when monetary policy has to make use of 

unconventional tools, the ECB cannot stand still. At the start of 2015 the ECB 
began publishing accounts of the monetary policy meetings of the Governing 

Council. This is an additional way to explain the ECB™s actions and the 
 discussions that inspired them. 
Accountability and transparency: implementing the guiding principles of the ECB™s communication
The ECB™s communication activities focused on the ECB™s accommodative monetary 
policy and the preparations to assume responsibility for banking supervision.  The vast majority of public speeches delivered by members of the Executive  Board were related to these issues. 99The Executive Board further contributed to enhancing public knowledge and understanding of the Eurosystem™s tasks and policies by giving testimony before 
the European Parliament and granting interviews to the media. In terms of direct outreach to the public, the ECB launched a new banking supervision website and made greater use of social media. The ECB used its website to publish simple series 
of questions and answers on relevant topics, for instance on the expanded asset 
purchase programme and the negative deposit rate. The ECB™s Twitter
 account now has around 200,000 followers and is used to highlight publications and key messages from speeches, while YouTube
 is used to publish video content and Flickr for photographs. Explaining monetary policy: the Sintra conferenceThe first ECB Forum on Central Banking, held in Sintra, Portugal, from 

25 to 27 May 2014, brought together central bankers, academics and government 
officials to discuss current economic issues in the euro area. Hailed as the key European 
policy conference, it is already established as a major annual event. In 2015 the 
ECB Forum on Central Banking will be held from 21 to 23 May, also in Sintra. 
Explaining our money: the new euro banknotesCommunication activities in 2014 also focused on euro banknotes, in particular in relation to the preparations for the changeover in Lithuania and the issuance of the 
new •10 banknote, which was the second denomination of the new series of euro banknotes to be introduced. The ECB implemented a number of communication measures aimed at informing the general public and cash handlers about the new banknote and its updated security features. Building the SSM: a communication challengeThe year-long process of launching the SSM and a simultaneous health check of the 
banks to be supervised at times resembled a marathon. A year of communication 
challenges culminated with the publication of the results of the comprehensive 
assessment, an in-depth examination of
 130 banks, on 26 October
 2014 and 
with the official starting date of the ECB™s banking supervision a few days later. These challenges ranged from aligning messages among 18 different national supervisory authorities to developing relations with a new audience of banking supervision journalists unfamiliar with the ECB, as well as explaining the technical details and reasoning underlying this huge exercise. 4,840 tweetsECB on Twitter@ecb197,000 followersECB on Twitte
r @ecb100Cutting through complexityAs part of the drive to be as transparent as possible on how exactly the banks were examined, the ECB published all the related technical manuals. These were 
explained in regular technical briefings as well as in an animated video explaining the disclosure manuals. Reaching diverse stakeholdersFinancial markets naturally watched the outcome of the comprehensive assessment very closely. This meant that the ECB had to ensure that analysts were well informed 
at all times. Almost
 200 analysts participated in a conference call with ECB experts on the day that the results of the comprehensive assessment were released. The ECB also organised public consultations aimed at the general public and interested stakeholders, as required by the SSM Regulation, and liaised frequently and closely with counterparts at the European Banking Authority, the European 
Securities and Markets Authority, and the banks themselves. Academics and think 

tanks were also the focus of various briefing activities in several European capitals and in the United States throughout the year.

 impact on 
the 
ECB
™s financial statements
. Operation/Function Impact on the ECB™s Annual Accounts
 Monetary policy operations Standard monetary policy operations are implemented in a decentralised manner by the NCBs of the Eurosystem. Consequently, these operations have no direct impact on the ECB's Annual Accounts. Securities held for monetary policy purposes (CBPPs, SMP and ABSPP) Securities purchased by the ECB are recorded under the item ﬁSecurities held for monetary policy purposesﬂ. Holdings in these portfolios are accounted for at amortised cost and an impairment test is conducted at least annually. Coupon accruals and amortisation of discounts/premiums are included in the Profit and Loss Account.16 Investment activities (management of foreign reserves and own funds) The foreign reserves of the ECB are presented on-balance sheet17 or are reflected in off-balance-sheet accounts until the settlement date. The own funds portfolio of the ECB is presented on-balance sheet, mainly under the item 
ﬁOther financial assetsﬂ. Net interest income, including coupon accruals and the amortisation of discounts/premiums, is included in the Profit and Loss Account.18 Unrealised price and exchange rate losses, as well as realised gains and losses arising from the sale of securities, are also included in the Profit and Loss Account,19 while unrealised gains are recorded on-balance sheet under the item 
ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ. Payment systems (TARGET2) Intra-Eurosystem balances of euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the ECB arising from TARGET2 are presented on the Balance Sheet of the ECB as a single net asset or liability position. The remuneration of those balances is included in the Profit and Loss Account under the items ﬁOther Interest Incomeﬂ and ﬁOther Interest Expenseﬂ.  Banknotes in circulation The ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation. This share is backed by claims on the NCBs, which bear interest at the rate on the ma
in refinancing operations. This interest is included in the Profit and Loss Account under the item ﬁInterest income arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ. Expenses arising from the cross-border transportation of euro banknotes between banknote printing works and NCBs, for the delivery of new banknotes, and between NCBs, for the compensation of shortages with surplus stocks, are borne centrally by the ECB. These expenses are presented in the Profit and Loss Account under the heading ﬁBanknote production servicesﬂ. Banking supervision The annual costs of the ECB in relation to its supervisory tasks are recovered via the annual supervisory fee levied on the supervised entities. Since the beginning of November 2014 supervisory fees have been recorded on an accrual basis in the Profit and Loss Account under the heading ﬁNet income from fees and commissionsﬂ.                                                                      16  Under

 21 Accounting policies
1 Form and presentation of the financial statements
 The 
financial statements of the ECB have been designed to present fairly the 
financial position of the ECB and the results of its operations. They have been drawn 
up in accordance with the following accounting policies,
2 which the Governing 
Council of the ECB 
considers to be appropriate to the nature of central bank activity
. Accounting principles
 The following accounting principles have been applied: economic reality and 
transparency, prudence, recognition of post
-balance
-sheet events, materiality, going 
conce
rn, the accruals principle, consistency and comparability
. Recognition of assets and liabilities
 An asset or liability is only recognised in the Balance Sheet when it is probable that 

any associated future economic benefit will flow to or from the ECB, sub
stantially all 
of the associated risks and rewards have been transferred to the ECB, and the cost 
or value of the asset or the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably
. Basis of accounting
 The accounts have been prepared on a historical cost basis
, modified to include the 
market valuation of marketable securities (other than securities held for monetary 
policy purposes), gold and all other on
-balance
-sheet and off
-balance
-sheet assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. Transactions in
 financial assets and 
liabilities are reflected in the accounts on the basis of the date on which they were 

settled
. With the exception of spot transactions in securities, transactions in financial 
instruments denominated in foreign currency are recorded i
n off
-balance
-sheet 
accounts on the trade date. At the settlement date the off
-balance
-sheet entries are 
reversed and transactions are booked on
-balance
-sheet. Purchases and sales of 
foreign currency affect the net foreign currency position on the trade da
te, and 
realised results arising from sales are also calculated on that date. Accrued interest, 
premiums and discounts related to financial instruments denominated in foreign 
                                                                    1  The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in Decision ECB/2010/21 of 11 November 
2010, OJ L 35, 
9.2.2011, p. 1.
 This Decision was last amended by Decision ECB/2014/55 of 
 15 December 
2014, 
OJ L 68, 13.3.2015, p. 5
4. 2  These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 of the Statute of the ESCB, which 

require a harmoni
sed approach to the rules governing the accounting and financial reporting of 
Eurosystem operations.

; (b) 
the 
third covered bond purchase programme; and (c) 
the 
asset
-backed securities 
purchase 
programme is due to the euro area NCBs in the 
financial year in which it accrues. Unless otherwise decided by the Governing 
Council, the ECB dist
ributes this income in January of the following year by means of 
an interim profit distribution.
9 It is distributed in full unless the ECB™s net profit for the 
year is less than its income earned on euro banknotes in circulation and securities 

purchased un
der the aforementioned programmes, and subject to any decisions by 
the Governing Council to make transfers to the provision for foreign exchange rate, 
interest rate, credit and gold price risks. The Governing Council may also decide to 
charge costs incurre
d by the ECB in connection with the issue and handling of euro 
banknotes against income earned on euro banknotes in circulation
. Reclassifications
 Fixed assets costing less than 
10,000 were previously fully written off in the year of 
acquisition, and thei
r cost was recorded under the heading ﬁDepreciation of tangible 
and intangible fixed assetsﬂ. 
Owing
 to the nature of this expense, the ECB decided in 
2014 to include the related amounts under the heading ﬁAdministrative expensesﬂ. 

The comparable amounts fo
r 2013 have been adjusted as follows:
  Published in 2013  Adjustment owing to 
reclassification   Restated amount  Depreciation of tangible and intangible fixed assets (18,581,856) 8,113,170 (10,468,686) Administrative expenses (260,070,567) (8,113,170) (268,183,737) This reclassification 
had no
 impact on the net profit reported for 2013.
 Other issues
 Taking account of the ECB™s role as a central bank, the Executive Board considers 

that the publication of a cash
-flow statement would not 
provide the readers of the 
financial statements with any additional relevant information.
 In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute of the ESCB, and on the basis of a 

recommendation of the Governing Council, the EU Council has approved the 

appointment o
f Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the external 
auditors of the ECB for a five
-year period up to the end of the financial year 2017

Balance 
Sheet 1 Gold and gold receivables
 As at 3
1 December
 2014 the ECB held 16,178,193 
ounces
10 of fine gold 
(2013:
 16,142,871 ounces). The increase was due to the transfer by Latvijas Banka 
to the ECB of 35,322 ounces of fine gold
11 upon the adoption of the single currency 
by Latvia. However, the increase in the euro equivalent value of the E
CB™s holdings 
of fine gold was mainly due to 
the
 rise in the price of gold during 2014 (see ﬁGold and 
foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies and 
 note 15, ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ)
. 2 Claims on non
-euro area and euro area 
residents 
denominated in foreign currency
 2.1 Receivables from the IMF This asset represents the ECB™s holdings of SDRs as at 
31 December
 2014. It arises 
as the result of a two
-way SDR buying and selling arrangement with the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), whereby the IMF is authorised to arrange sales or purchases 
of SDRs against euro, on behalf of the ECB, within minimum and maximum ho
lding 
levels. For accounting purposes, SDRs are treated as a foreign currency (see ﬁGold 
and foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies). The 
increase in the euro equivalent value of the ECB™s holdings of SDRs was mainly d
ue to the appreciation of 
the 
SDR 
against
 the 
euro
 during 2014
. 2.2 Balances with banks and security investments, external loans and other external assets; and claims on euro area residents denominated in foreign currency These two items consist of balances 
with banks and loans denominated in foreign 
currency, and investments in securities denominated in US dollars and Japanese 
yen.

2014 55 Note on profit distribution/allocation of 
losses
 This note is not part of the financial statements of the ECB for the year 201
4. Pursuant to Article 33 of the Statute of the ESCB, the 
net profit of the ECB shall be 
transferred in the following order:
 (a)
 an amount to be determined by the Governing Council, which may not exceed 
20% of the net profit, shall be transferred to the general reserve fund, subject to 
a limit equal to 100% of the ca
pital; and 
 (b)
 the remaining net profit shall be distributed to the shareholders of the ECB in 
proportion to their paid
-up shares.
 In the event of a loss incurred by the ECB, the shortfall may be offset against the 
general reserve fund of the ECB and, if nece
ssary, following a decision by the 
Governing Council, against the monetary income of the relevant financial year in 
proportion and up to the amounts allocated to the NCBs in accordance with 
 Article 32.5 of the Statute of the ESCB.
1 After the transfer to t
he risk provision, the ECB™s net profit for 201
4 was 
988.8 million. Following a decision by the Governing Council, there was no transfer 
to the general reserve fund and an interim profit distribution, amounting to 
840.7 million, was 
paid out 
to the euro 
area NCBs on 3
0 January 201
5. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided to distribute the remaining profit of 
148.1 million to the euro area NCBs. 
 Profits are distributed to the NCBs in proportion to their paid
-up shares in the 
subscribed capital of the
 ECB. Non
-euro area NCBs are not entitled to receive any 
share of the ECB™s distributable profits, nor are they liable to fund any loss of the 

ECB.

158Annex 1 Institutional framework1 Decision-making bodies and corporate governance 
 of the ECBThe Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed by the decision-making bodies of the ECB: the Governing Council and the Executive Board. The General Council is 
constituted as a third decision-making body of the ECB, for as long as there are EU Member States which have not yet adopted the euro. The functioning of the decision-
making bodies is governed by the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the 
Functioning of the European Union, the Statute of the ESCB and the relevant Rules of Procedure.1 Decision-making within the Eurosystem and the ESCB is centralised. However, the ECB and the euro area NCBs jointly contribute, strategically and 
operationally, to attaining the common goals of the Eurosystem, with due respect to the principle of decentralisation in accordance with the Statute of the ESCB.1.1 The Governing CouncilThe Governing Council is the main decision-making body of the ECB. It comprises 
the members of the Executive Board of the ECB and the governors of the NCBs of the euro area countries. In view of Lithuania™s adoption of the euro as of 
January 2015, the Chairman of the Board of Lietuvos bankas, the central bank of Lithuania, was invited to attend the meetings of the Governing Council in an observer capacity between July and December 2014. In July 2014 the Governing Council decided that meetings dedicated to monetary policy would be held every six weeks instead of once a month, starting in January 2015.1 For the ECB™s Rules of Procedure, see: Decision ECB/2004/2 of 19 February 2004 adopting the Rules 
of Procedure of the European Central Bank, OJ L 80, 18.3.2004, p. 33; Decision ECB/2004/12 of 

17 June 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure of the General Council of the ECB, OJ L 230, 30.6.2004, 

p. 61; and Decision ECB/1999/7 of 12 October 1999 concerning the Rules of Procedure of the Executive 
Board of the ECB, OJ L 314, 8.12.1999, p. 34. These rules are also available on the ECB™s website.159The Governing CouncilMario Draghi President of the ECBVítor Constâncio Vice-President of the ECBJörg Asmussen

1631.4 Corporate governanceIn addition to the decision-making bodies, the corporate governance of the ECB encompasses high-level committees such as the ECB Audit Committee and the ECB 
Ethics Committee as well as a number of external and internal control layers.ECB Audit Committee
The ECB Audit Committee enhances the corporate governance of the ECB and of 
the Eurosystem as a whole. It supports the Governing Council by providing advice and/or opinions regarding its responsibilities in respect of (i) the integrity of financial information, (ii) the oversight of internal controls, (iii) compliance with applicable laws, regulations and codes of conduct, and (iv) the performance of audit functions. Its mandate is available on the ECB™s website. The Audit Committee is chaired by Erkki Liikanen and comprises four other members: Vítor Constâncio, Christian Noyer, 
Hans Tietmeyer and Jean-Claude Trichet.EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF CENTRAL BANKS (ESCB)

Auditors, which examines the operational efficiency of the management of the ECB. 
Internal control layers Other key components of the ECB™s corporate governance structure are the internal 
control structure of the ECB, the Ethics Framework and the rules concerning public access to ECB documents. The internal control structure of the ECB is based on a functional approach in which each organisational unit (section, division, directorate or directorate general) has primary responsibility for managing its own risks, as well as for ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations. It also comprises monitoring 
mechanisms and effective processes to achieve adequate control of financial and 
operational risks. A more detailed description of these control mechanisms and 
procedures is provided in the management report, which can be found in the Annual 

Accounts 2014 section. Independently from the internal control structure and risk monitoring of the ECB, audit 
missions are performed by the internal audit function under the direct responsibility of the Executive Board, in accordance with the ECB Audit Charter
3. ECB Ethics FrameworkThe ECB™s Ethics Framework consists of the Code of Conduct for the members of 
the Governing Council, the Supplementary Code of Ethics Criteria for the members of the Executive Board, the Code of Conduct for the members of the Supervisory Board and the ECB Staff Rules, as amended on
 3 December 2014 following the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).The Ethics Framework sets ethical rules and guiding principles to ensure the highest level of integrity, competence, efficiency and transparency in the performance of 
tasks. Following the establishment of the SSM, governance issues have acquired increased significance for the ECB. To ensure the adequate and consistent 
implementation of the Ethics Framework in place and to enhance the ECB™s 

corporate governance, on 17 December 2014 the Governing Council decided to establish an Ethics Committee. Finally, a Compliance and Governance Office was 
established to support the Executive Board in protecting the integrity and reputation of the ECB, to promote ethical standards of behaviour and to strengthen the ECB™s 
accountability and transparency.

3 This charter is published on the ECB™s website to foster the transparency of audit arrangements in place 
at the ECB. 165ECB Ethics CommitteeThe Ethics Committee will provide, among other things, advice on questions of ethics on the basis of individual requests and will assume the responsibilities assigned to the Ethics Adviser under the Code of Conduct for the members of the Governing 
Council and the Ethics Officer under the Supplementary Code of Ethics Criteria for 
the members of the Executive Board. The Ethics Committee will be composed of 
three external members, at least one of which will be an external member of the ECB™s Audit Committee. The members of the Ethics Committee must be individuals 
of high repute from Member States, whose independence is beyond doubt and who 
have a sound understanding of the objectives, tasks and governance of the ECB, the ESCB, the Eurosystem and the SSM. 1.5 Public access to ECB documentsThe ECB™s Decision on public access to ECB documents
4 is in line with the objectives and standards applied by other EU institutions and bodies with regard to 
public access to their documents. It enhances transparency, while at the same time taking into account the independence of the ECB and of the NCBs and ensuring the confidentiality of certain matters specific to the performance of the ECB™s tasks.5 In 2014 the number of public access requests remained limited. 4 Decision ECB/2004/3 of 4 March 2004 on public access to European Central Bank documents, OJ L 80, 
18.3.2004, p. 42. 5 In line with the ECB™s commitment to openness and transparency, the ﬁArchivesﬂ section of the ECB™s website provides access to historical documentation.166Annex 2  Eurosystem/ESCB committeesThe Eurosystem/ESCB committees have continued to play an important role in assisting the ECB™s decision-making bodies in the performance of their tasks. At the 
request of both the Governing Council and the Executive Board, the committees have provided expertise in their fields of competence and have facilitated the decision-making process. Membership of the committees is usually restricted to staff 
of the Eurosystem central banks. However, the NCBs of the Member States which 
have not yet adopted the euro take part in the meetings of a committee whenever it deals with matters that fall within the field of competence of the General Council. 
In addition, some of the committees meet in an SSM composition (i.e. one member from the central bank and one member from the national competent authority of each participating Member State) when dealing with matters related to banking supervision. Where appropriate, other competent bodies may also be invited to committee meetings.

The Budget Committee assists the Governing 
Council in matters related to the ECB™s budget. The Human Resources Conference 
is a forum for the exchange of experience, expertise and information among Eurosystem/ESCB central banks in the field of human resources management. The 
Eurosystem IT Steering Committee, which was established in 2007 with a mandate 
to steer continuous improvement in the use of IT within the Eurosystem, became a 
dormant committee in November 2014. Its operational tasks were assigned to other relevant committees, i.e. the Committee on Controlling, the Information Technology 

Committee and the Organisational Development Committee. 168Annex 3 Organisational and human resources

Executive BoardDirectorates General &DirectoratesDivisionsTHE ORGANISATION CHART OF THE ECB(as at 1 January 2015)169ECB human resources2014 was an extraordinary year for the ECB in the field of human resources developments, with a particular focus being placed on recruitment and staff 
development for the launch of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) on 4 November 2014. Gender diversity was also a focal point, with the proportion of women in high-ranking positions increasing in 2014. As at 31 December 2014 the ECB had 2,622 full-time equivalent approved headcount 
positions, compared with 1,907 positions at the end of 2013. The large majority of additional positions approved in relation to the establishment of the SSM were filled by 31 December 2014, with the number of actual full-time equivalent staff holding employment contracts with the ECB standing at 2,577 (compared with 1,790 on 
31 December 2013).1 A total of 779 new fixed-term contracts (limited in nature2 or convertible to permanent contracts) were offered in 2014 and 506 short-term contracts were issued during the year, in addition to a number of contract extensions, to cover absences of less than one year. Throughout 2014 the ECB continued to 
offer short-term contracts for periods of up to 36 months to staff from NCBs and international organisations. On 31 December 2014 151 employees from NCBs and international organisations were working at the ECB on various assignments, 26% less than at the end of 2013. In September 2014 the ECB welcomed ten participants in the ninth intake of its Graduate Programme, and on 31 December 2014 
155 trainees were being hosted by the ECB (7% more than in 2013). The ECB also awarded four fellowships as part of the Wim Duisenberg Research Fellowship Programme, which is open to leading economists, and five fellowships to young researchers under its Lamfalussy Fellowship Programme. Staff development remained an important issue at the ECB. 2014 saw a particular 
emphasis on the development and rollout of the SSM training curriculum and a large increase in ﬁknowledge-sharingﬂ training programmes for newcomers. The two-year 
career transition support programme came to a successful end, with 45 long-serving members of staff taking up the support provided to pursue their career outside the 

ECB. In addition, a women™s leadership training programme was launched in 2014. 
Following the decision of the Executive Board in June 2013 to introduce gender targets for women at management and senior management level, the representation of women in this group has increased. At the end of 2014 24% of positions at management level and 19% of positions at senior management level were held by 
women (compared with 18% and 15% respectively at the end of 2013). In parallel with the decision to establish gender targets, the Executive Board also endorsed a gender diversity action plan consisting of a series of operational measures and instruments (e.g. diversity ambassadors, a mentoring programme and additional teleworking opportunities), which were all subsequently implemented. 1 In addition to contracts based on full-time equivalent positions, this figure includes short-term contracts 
awarded to staff seconded from NCBs and international organisations and contracts awarded to 

Graduate Programme participants.2 Some non-convertible contracts were issued, in particular in ECB shared services, in order to cover the 

temporary tasks of launching the SSM.Actual full-time equivalent staff holdingemployment contracts31 December

At the end of 2014 259 staff members were working part time (228 at end-2013) 
and 29 staff members were on unpaid parental leave (26 at end-2013). In 2014, 
on average, around 781 staff members teleworked at least once a month. 
While the organisation grew in size, 53 members of staff employed on a fixed-term 
or permanent basis resigned or retired in 2014 (42 in 2013), while 396 short-term contracts expired in the course of the year. 
The ECB™s new premises 
In 2014 the ECB moved into its new headquarters, marking the successful completion of a 16-year process.The ECB launched a search for a suitable site for its own premises back in 1998, following a recommendation from the European Court of Auditors to all EU 
institutions that it is more economical in the long term to own premises rather than to rent office space. Having looked at 35 possible options across Frankfurt, the 
ECB decided in 2001 to purchase the site of the Grossmarkthalle, the city™s former 
wholesale market hall, and to retain the existing building. A feasibility study had 
shown that this site was the most economically viable, that it was well connected in terms of infrastructure, that the spatial requirements could be met and that it was 
the optimal site for implementing the security measures required by a central bank. Furthermore, it offered sufficient space for further construction and extension.
The design was developed by Vienna-based architects COOP HIMMELB(L)AU. 
It creates a working environment that facilitates open communication, promoting teamwork and interaction at every level. At the same time, the degree of flexibility in 
the design means that changing requirements can be accommodated with little effort. 
The distinctive glass office tower, which is linked to the market hall building via an 
entrance building, serves as a landmark in Frankfurt™s Ostend district, and the new 
building ensemble is a notable addition to Europe™s architectural heritage.
The Grossmarkthalle was built between 1926 and 1928 to serve as a central location for buying and selling fruit and vegetables in Frankfurt and the surrounding area. As 

an industrial building, it heralded Frankfurt™s ascent to the rank of metropolis during 
the 1920s. Martin Elsaesser, who was Director of Town Planning for the City of 
Frankfurt am Main at the time, designed the Grossmarkthalle as the world™s largest 
free-spanning reinforced concrete structure.The construction process included converting this industrial utility building into a public institution with an array of functions, which required the highest degree of care. From the outset, all decisions on the design, as well as its further development, were discussed in detail and taken in close cooperation with both the City of Frankfurt am Main and the historic preservation authorities. Converting the city™s former wholesale 

market hall and incorporating it into the design has made history part of the ECB, adding to the uniqueness of this landmark. 171The ECB has aimed from the start to create a sustainable building that is highly efficient in terms of energy and water consumption. Various energy design measures 
have been put in place to ensure that the new building is 30% more efficient than 
stipulated by the Energieeinsparverordnung (German energy saving directive) of 2007.2014 saw the finalisation of the construction works for the new premises. The 
installation of technical infrastructure and the fit-out works were completed inside the buildings, while construction of the two elements linking the Grossmarkthalle and the high-rise took place in the spring. Each floor was divided up into offices 
of various sizes using lightweight walls, and the furniture began to be set up from 
April. Headway was also made on the realisation of the landscape design in areas of the site that had already been cleared. Groups of trees, embankments and ditches began to take shape, with the landscaping work due to be completed in 2015.The procedure for obtaining formal building acceptance from the City authorities began in spring 2014. All technical systems were thoroughly tested over the summer, 
and a completely new IT infrastructure was installed in parallel. In the autumn the 
ECB received formal permission from the City authorities to operate the building.Finally, from 31 October to 23 November, 2,421 workplaces were successfully 
moved. This marked the successful completion of the process to build a functional, 

sustainable and modern headquarters for the ECB. The majority of staff members 
dealing with monetary policy are now working together under one roof. However, 
since the new premises were designed at a time when it was not foreseen that the ECB would assume responsibility for banking supervision in the euro area, the ECB decided in November 2013 to continue to rent its former headquarters to house its banking supervision staff. Staff providing shared services are located in 
both buildings.
