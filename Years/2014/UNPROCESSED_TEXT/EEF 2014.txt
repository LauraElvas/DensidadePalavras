EDITORIAL
The recovery is broadening. GDP growth in the EU, which has turned positive in the second quarter of
last year, is increasingly driven by domestic demand. This year, domestic consumption and investment
are set to expand further, reducing the dependency of the recovery on the external sector. Growth has also
returned in many of the vulnerable Member States, and growth differentials across EU Member States are
expected to narrow.
At the same time as we are observing more balanced growth prospects across the EU, the global economy
is becoming more differentiated. Among advanced economies, the US has displayed a strong resilience to
domestic fiscal shocks and the related uncertainty. Assessing the upswing there as sufficiently robust, the
Federal Reserve has initiated the gradual shift towards a less expansionary monetary stance. In turn, the
prospect of a gradual normalisation of benchmark interest rates and global liquidity has led international
investors to discriminate more strongly among emerging market economies, and capital flows to countries
with sizeable external imbalances and domestic weaknesses have dried up. This reallocation of capital
flows has led to financial market tensions in mid-2013 and again in early 2014. They are a reminder that
the global economy remains vulnerable, even as growth and trade are accelerating.
Within the EU economy, welcome recent improvements point to a path towards gradual normalisation.
However, the consequences of the crisis are still holding back growth and job creation and could do so for
some time. On the one hand, there are positive developments on several fronts. After years of necessary
front-loaded fiscal consolidation, the aggregate fiscal stance is now close to neutral, although efforts are
still required in a number of Member States. The ECB's comprehensive assessment of the banking sector
provides an opportunity to finalise the overdue repair of bank balance sheets that is a precondition for
overcoming financial fragmentation in the euro area and for getting credit to support the real economy.
There are first signs that recent reforms in a number of Member States start bearing fruit as they facilitate
internal and external adjustment and, crucially, improve the prospects for employment growth. On the
other hand, as long as debt in several sectors of the economy remains too high, unemployment is at record
levels and the adjustment of previous imbalances is incomplete, there is a serious risk of growth
remaining stuck in low gear. Indeed, should the impetus for reforms at EU and Member State level falter,
we would squander the opportunity to put the EU economy back on a higher growth trajectory. The
present very low inflation - well below the ECB definition of price stability - could exacerbate the risk of
protracted lacklustre growth if it becomes entrenched. Disinflation may have the positive effect of
improving real incomes and supporting demand. However, it also makes the competitiveness adjustment
in vulnerable Member States more challenging, as the required negative inflation differential to the rest of
the euro area could adversely affect debt dynamics. Going forward, much depends on the stability of
inflation expectations for the medium term. Should they shift lower, the corresponding increase of real
interest rates and the debt burden would make it harder for growth to accelerate.
Making 2014 the first year of a sustained recovery therefore requires continued and determined policy
efforts: bold structural reforms in both vulnerable and core countries to tackle slow growth and facilitate
rebalancing via demand rotation; full and effective implementation of the Banking Union to overcome
financial fragmentation, sever sovereign-bank links and unlock credit in support of the recovery;
improvement in the quality of public finances to boost investment and favour job creation. It can be done,
provided that policy makers at national and EU level do not mistake the recent signs of improvement as
definite normalisation. There is still some sailing to do before we reach harbour.

OVERVIEW
The EU recovery is
firming …

Europe's economic recovery, which began in the second quarter of 2013, is
expected to continue spreading across countries and gaining strength while at
the same time becoming more balanced across growth drivers. As it is typical
following deep financial crises, however, the recovery remains fragile.
Nevertheless, recent positive economic news means that the forecasts for
GDP growth this year and next have been raised slightly since the autumn.
EU GDP, which rose 0.1% in 2013, is now expected to rise 1.5% this year
and 2.0% next year, while growth in the euro area, which was -0.4% for 2013
as a whole, is expected to be 1.2% in 2014 and 1.8% in 2015. After two years
of contraction, domestic demand is gently firming, as the crisis' legacy of
excessive debt, financial fragmentation, economic uncertainty and the need
for adjustment and fiscal consolidation fades, and confidence is improving.
The fiscal stances of the EU and euro area this year are expected to be
broadly neutral. At the same time, rising import demand means that external
trade's contribution to growth will become more muted. In line with these
developments, unemployment should fall slightly from its peak, as the labour
market turns the corner. The forecast for inflation in the EU and the euro area

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2014

has been lowered significantly since the autumn. Inflation in the EU is now
expected to dip to 1.2% in 2014 before rising again to 1.5% in 2015. In the
euro area, inflation is seen at 1.0% in 2014 and 1.3% in 2015.
…while the global
environment is
differentiated

The world economy picked up in the second half of last year, driven by
stronger growth in advanced economies, especially in the US, but also by a
rebound in some emerging market economies. Growth is expected to
accelerate for most advanced economies outside the EU. In the US where the
headwinds from fiscal policy have been waning, private consumption is
gaining speed benefitting from robust job creation and rising house prices,
while the Federal Reserve has initiated a gradual shift towards less
accommodative monetary policy. In Japan, growth is expected to remain
relatively stable in 2014. Among emerging market economies, the picture is
uneven. There are continued signs of weakness in Russia and Brazil, some
stabilisation at more sustainable growth rates in China and an improved
outlook for India. Recent financial tensions have so far mostly affected
emerging markets with relatively weak macroeconomic fundamentals, such
as Argentina, Turkey and South Africa, while the EU Member States have
been largely spared so far.
After lacklustre 2013, economic activity outside the EU is expected to
accelerate to about 4% this year and 4½% in 2015. Global trade is forecast to
rise more than GDP, with world import growth doubling from 2½% in 2013
to about 5% in 2014 and rising to 6% in 2015, reflecting both the
strengthening of the global recovery and the impetus from trade-intensive
sectors. Over the forecast horizon, oil prices are forecast to continue
declining along the same path as assumed in November, supported by
adequate supply. The nominal exchange rate of the euro against main trading
partners (based on the technical assumption of unchanged nominal exchange
rates) is now projected about 2% higher than last autumn.

Adjustments within the
EU begin to bear fruit

The recovery in Europe is expected to be broad-based across EU Member
States as activity has also started to strengthen in the vulnerable countries of
the euro-area periphery. Growth differentials persist but the gap is projected
to narrow. In 2014, only Cyprus and Slovenia are still expected to register
negative annual GDP growth rates. By 2015 all EU economies are expected
to be growing again. Internal and external adjustment in vulnerable Member
States is progressing, underpinned in many cases by significant structural
reforms that are starting bearing fruit. Ireland has successfully completed its
financial assistance programme in December 2013. Driven by strong exports,
growth is significantly firming in Spain and Portugal, while a moderate
rebound is expected in Greece. Among the bigger economies, a steady
domestic demand-driven expansion is expected over the forecast horizon in
Germany, while in France economic growth is only slowly recovering,
supported by a timid pick up in private consumption. Mild economic
recoveries in the Netherlands and in Italy are set to be driven by net exports
and investment. Strong growth is foreseen in the United Kingdom and in
Poland on the back of increasingly robust domestic demand.

Final demand is
rebalancing …

The rebalancing of Europe's growth engines is confirmed as domestic
demand overtakes exports as main thruster. The strengthening of domestic
demand, though still expected to be modest in 2014, will be fuelled by all
components, both private and public.
Investment growth, in particular investment in equipment, is projected to
significantly strengthen, as the main impediments to firms' demand and

profits (uncertainty, financing conditions, deleveraging needs) are slowly
receding, and the improvement in the economic outlook is confirmed.
Uncertainty has significantly receded over the past year and a half and should
continue to do so under the assumption of smooth policy implementation at
the EU and Member-State levels. Financing conditions are also expected to
improve and to support further investment spending.
Private consumption showed only marginal growth at the onset of the
recovery but is expected to gain momentum over 2014-2015, as the labour
market slightly improves, real disposable incomes benefits from low
consumer price inflation and the drag of fiscal consolidation diminishes. In
line with improved confidence and lower precautionary savings, households
are expected to spend most of the increase in real income. Public
consumption is also expected to pick up as fiscal consolidation needs become
less acute.
…and external
imbalances are
receding in vulnerable
Member States

The current-account surpluses of both the EU and the euro area increased in
2013 and are expected to remain broadly stable (at respectively 1½% and
2¼% of GDP) this year and next. Most of the recent strengthening is the
result of significant adjustment, involving improved exports but also a largely
permanent contraction in domestic demand, in the euro-area Member States
that previously recorded high deficits. This external rebalancing is supported
by enhanced price competitiveness resulting from lower unit labour costs.
High external indebtedness, however, requires the external adjustment in
some Member States to go further still.

Financial market
conditions are
improving…

Financial market conditions in the EU improved in 2013, as a result of the
better macroeconomic outlook and sustained low-interest rate environment.
Financial fragmentation considerably receded in the sovereign- and
corporate-debt markets, with most bond spreads of vulnerable Member States
continuing to narrow, thanks to investor confidence in the success of the
ongoing fiscal adjustment and economic reforms. However, despite some
normalisation in bank funding conditions, financial fragmentation on the
euro-area lending market continues to impair the transmission of monetary
policy, hurting mainly small and medium-sized enterprises. The ECB's
comprehensive assessment of banks' balance sheets and a smooth
implementation of the Banking Union should further reinforce confidence in
European banks and fan the recovery.

…and the fiscal
stance is now close to
neutral

Substantial improvements in public finances have been achieved in the EU
since 2011. On the basis of policy measures already approved by national
parliaments or known with sufficient detail, the fiscal stance is expected to be
close to neutral over the forecast horizon. The fiscal effort this year,
measured in terms of change of the structural balance, is indeed expected to
be broadly neutral in the EU and in the euro area. At the same time, fiscal
consolidation is expected to move gradually from revenue measures to
expenditure control. Headline fiscal deficits are set to shrink further in 2014
(to around 2¾% of GDP in the EU and 2½% of GDP in the euro area) before
stabilising in 2015 under the assumption of no policy change. The debt-toGDP ratio is expected to peak in 2014 at 90% in the EU and at 96% in the
euro area.

Labour markets
improve only slowly …

Labour market conditions stabilised in mid-2013 but only a small
improvement is expected in 2014 and 2015 because labour markets typically
react with a certain lag to rebounds in economic activity and the recovery
remains modest. In the early phase of the recovery, private employment

3

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2014

growth is expected to be dampened by the usual adjustment in working
hours. Decisive structural reforms implemented in some Member States may
shorten this period and help prevent the very high level of unemployment
from becoming structural. Employment in the EU and the euro area is
expected to start rising modestly in 2014 by ½% and about ¼% respectively,
slightly better than projected last autumn. This increase will not yet be
sufficient to meaningfully curb unemployment in the EU, but it will trigger a
stabilisation of the unemployment rate in the euro area. In 2015, employment
growth is set to accelerate to ¾% in both areas, resulting in a slight reduction
of unemployment to 10.4% in the EU and 11.7% in the euro area. Labour
markets will continue to perform differently across Member States.
…and inflation
remains subdued

Headline inflation decreased markedly over the course of 2013, particularly
in the last quarter of the year, due to falling energy and commodity prices,
weak demand, the fading impact of some temporary factors, and the
continued appreciation of the euro. The expectation that the output gap will
close only slowly suggests that weak demand will continue to contribute to
low inflation. Subdued pressures are expected to keep consumer price
inflation down to 1.2% in the EU and 1.0% in euro area in 2014. Only a
slight increase is expected for 2015 when economic growth gains
momentum. Low inflation is expected to support private consumption
because it boosts real disposable incomes. However, since inflation
expectations have been sagging, real interest rates have actually risen since
the autumn. Moreover, low aggregate inflation makes it harder for vulnerable
countries to gain price competitiveness and increases the real value of both
public and private debts.

A risk of protracted
low growth

Risks to the growth outlook have become slightly more balanced, but still
weigh more heavily on the downside. The main risk to the forecast would be
stalling or partial implementation of structural, fiscal and institutional
reforms at Member States or European level, resulting in low actual and
potential growth and protracted high unemployment. A weaker than projected
labour market would have both short- and medium-term detrimental effects
on private consumption and also on potential growth. Moreover, the debt
overhang, the investment shortfall in recent years and slowing total factor
productivity could hurt growth in the medium term if they are inadequately
addressed by structural reforms, resulting in an extended period of low
growth. The risk of low growth would be exacerbated in the short term by
lower than expected inflation and a slower reduction in financial
fragmentation.
Inflation could turn out lower than the current forecast if economic agents
were to perceive the current very weak price pressures as becoming
entrenched. Lower inflation would increase real interest rates with negative
effects on growth and on the real debt burden. However, confidence is rising
and growth is picking up so there is only a marginal probability of shocks
large enough to initiate outright EU or euro-area wide deflation.
Credit growth could remain anaemic if the implementation of the Banking
Union and the Asset Quality Review (AQR) and stress tests were to fail to
clean up balance sheets and restore confidence, also given the still elevated
deleveraging needs in the private sector. The resulting prolonged weakness of
credit supply would impose a limit on the recovery of investment. Downside
risks could also stem from heightened financial instability in emerging
markets.

4

Overview

The recovery could also be stronger than envisaged if firmer domestic
demand in the core countries helps further the rebalancing process, while the
competitiveness boost in peripheral countries is larger than envisaged. In the
medium-term, the implementation of additional and bold structural reforms
could lift further the potential growth of Member States, with positive impact
also in the short-term, notably through increased confidence. Positive
confidence effects could lead to a stronger rebound of investment in
particular if financial fragmentation is reduced to a greater extent following a
successful AQR and the introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.

EA and EU outlook

RECOVERY GAINING GROUND
The EU economy returned to positive growth in the second quarter of 2013, and continued to recover in
the second half of the year, gathering pace towards the end. Short-term indicators suggest a continued
economic expansion in the coming quarters. However, the main impediments to growth stemming from
the crisis – high debt, financial fragmentation, uncertainty and difficult adjustment – are only slowly
receding, and the global economy is projected to grow at just a moderate pace. Looking ahead, GDP is
expected to grow by 1.5% in the EU and 1.2% in the euro area this year, before speeding up more
markedly in 2015 to 2.0% and 1.8% respectively.
The recovery is expected to become increasingly driven by domestic demand and to spread across EU
Member States. Domestic investment and consumption are set to continue firming this year and next,
replacing net exports as the main driver of growth. Differences in the expected rates of growth across
the EU should narrow, particularly as the recovery has now reached the large majority of Member
States, including those most affected by the crisis. Unemployment, however, is set to remain high, with
large differences among countries. Inflation, which has recently fallen faster than earlier anticipated, is
expected to remain low for some time before increasing slightly in 2015 on the back of decreasing
unemployment and excess capacity.

A slow and fragile recovery is taking place in the
EU and the euro area. GDP growth continued to be
positive in the third quarter and gathered pace in
the fourth. Survey-based confidence indicators
have continued to improve in recent months
suggesting a continuation of the gradual recovery.
Revisions to the autumn 2013 forecast are mild but
slightly positive, and the earlier projection that
growth would become broader-based across
countries and increasingly driven by domestic
demand has been confirmed.

A broader-based recovery across countries
and drivers of growth …

In the second half of 2013, the recovery continued
to broaden regionally. In the last quarter of 2013,
GDP increased by 0.4% q-o-q in the EU and 0.3%
q-o-q in the euro area, with the cyclical
improvement fairly widespread across the EU
countries. Only three of the EU economies that
reported quarterly GDP data (1) are estimated to
still be contracting, down from eight in the second
quarter of 2013. High frequency indicators also
show strong signs of improvements, with PMIs
expanding in a majority of countries.

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2014

Growth differentials among euro-area Member
States have fallen back to their 2010 levels but
remain larger than they were between 2000 and
2007, before the crisis. The remaining differentials
are a reflection of countries' different experiences
during the crisis and their related adjustment
needs, including in the financial sector.
Unaddressed rigidities in labour and product
markets also play a role in a number of Member
States. As the recovery proceeds, growth
differentials are expected to decrease further as the
drags on growth that weighted particularly on
vulnerable Member States recede and domestic
demand firms up.
Growth is becoming less dependent on external
demand. As anticipated in the autumn forecast,
domestic demand is firming, though its dynamics
now appear slightly stronger than previously
expected. All components of domestic demand
showed positive growth rates in the third quarter of
2013, and are expected to have increased further in
the fourth quarter (2), with investment notably
starting to pick-up more firmly. However, the
investment to GDP ratio in the EU stabilised at
around 18.9% in the third quarter of 2013, and
remains far below its share of about 21% in the
early 2000s. The fall in investment between 2008
and 2013 was extremely severe compared with
previous downturns, particularly driven by sharp
declines in business investment and, in some
countries where there were housing bubbles,
construction investment.
In most Member States, investment growth is
expected to strengthen more significantly over the
forecast horizon. Business investment, which
should be one of the main drivers of growth in a
period of recovery, contracted in recent years
because of weak fundamental factors, such as low
demand and profits, as well as abundant spare
capacity. Those weaknesses coupled with legacies
from the financial crisis such as high uncertainty,
tight financing conditions and the deleveraging
needs of firms are gradually fading and this is
unlocking business investment.
… as impediments to growth are slowly
receding.

As pointed out in previous forecasts, recoveries
from deep financial crises are slower and more
fragile than typical cyclical recoveries. Public and

private balance-sheet adjustment, financial
fragmentation,
uncertainty
and
resource
reallocation during internal and external
rebalancing,
have
temporarily
dampened
investment and consumption, and this is fading
only gradually.
In particular, the recovery of domestic demand has
so far coexisted with a continued contraction of
bank credit in the euro area. The absence of credit
growth has been a symptom of low cyclical
demand,
compounded
by
non-financial
corporations' deleveraging. During the early phase
of the recovery, creditless growth is therefore not
necessarily a major issue at the aggregate level. (3)
Financial market conditions in the EU have
continued to strengthen since the autumn, with
both sovereign and corporate spreads receding
substantially. However, data on bank lending
volumes and interest rates suggest that the euroarea lending market is still fragmented (see
graph I.3), with detrimental effects for small and
medium-sized enterprises (see section I.3).
Looking ahead, the ECB's comprehensive
assessment of banks' balance sheets and the
smooth implementation of the Banking Union
should help further sever the links between
sovereigns and banks, with positive implications
for credit growth, particularly for SMEs.

Substantial improvements in public finances have
been achieved in the EU since 2011, with
differentiated budgetary adjustments under the
strengthened EU framework. Those efforts have
allowed for a gradually reduced aggregate pace of
fiscal consolidation since 2013. An analysis of
measures already approved by national parliaments

EA and EU outlook

The negative impact of extreme uncertainty has
been fading, but further reductions would release
additional demand of goods and services. Policy
uncertainty became extremely high in the euro area
in 2011 and remained at high levels in the first half
of 2012 when the integrity of the euro area was
questioned.
Since
then,
decisive
crisismanagement measures, reforms of the euro area's
economic governance, and further steps towards
Banking Union, have significantly reduced
uncertainty. At the start of this year, policy
uncertainty stood well below its average during the
crisis years of 2008-13, but still above pre-crisis
levels. Assuming smooth and continued policy
implementation, uncertainty should continue
declining,
encouraging
consumption
and
investment decisions. (4) This would also have
immediate positive effects on manufacturing in the
euro area, through increased industrial new orders
(see box I.1).
Finally, the adjustment of external and internal
imbalances is progressing, but very high
unemployment will continue to hold back growth
in a number of vulnerable countries.
Significant progress in the reduction of imbalances
in the vulnerable Member States has been achieved
in recent years. Gains in competitiveness due to
decreases in unit labour costs, allowed for solid
export performance as firms successfully turned to
export markets. Moreover, prices and wages have
developed differently in the tradable and nontradable sectors. Non-tradables have seen deeper
reductions in wages, while tradables have seen
comparatively stronger price increases, a trend that
should help rebalancing. (5) The adjustment in
competitiveness and prices in vulnerable Member
States is expected to continue, along with higher
growth, still mostly led by exports.

Area, June 2013, Vol. 12, No. 2, pp. 7-16.

Area, October 2012, Vol. 12, No.3, pp. 19-25.

Evidence suggests that a significant part of the
current-account adjustment achieved so far is
structural, though largely due to a permanent fall
of domestic demand (see box I.3). However, in
several countries the adjustment of the structural
current-account balance is not yet sufficient to
significantly
reduce
large
negative
net
international investment positions. Moreover, the
reallocation of labour to more productive activities
has proven difficult given weak economic growth,
so unemployment is expected to retreat very
gradually from extremely high levels.

fiscal consolidation is set to further decrease. The
need for front-loaded fiscal consolidation in the

impact on growth in the short term but the benefits
are expected in the medium term.

THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

World GDP growth picked up in the third quarter
of 2013 to 0.9% q-o-q, up from 0.8% in the
second. Growth is increasingly being driven by the
improved performance in advanced economies,
primarily the US. In the third quarter, the
contribution from emerging market economies
(EME) remained unchanged, as a rising
contribution from China and India was notably
counterbalanced by the weaker performance of
Latin America.
Looking ahead, survey indicators suggest a
persistence of this pattern. Most Purchasing
Managers' Indices (PMI) in advanced economies
came out strongly in January while weakness was
concentrated in the emerging markets, with the
composite EME PMI edging down for the second
month in a row on the back of the deterioration in
China, Russia and Turkey. All in all, global GDP
growth is now expected to have reached 2.9% in
2013 and to accelerate to 3.6% in 2014 and to
3.9% in 2015 (see graph I.5 and table I.1).

Global trade growth is accelerating …

Mirroring the improvement in world GDP, global
trade growth strengthened at the end of 2013, with
improved outcomes for both advanced and
emerging economies (see graph I.6). According to
the CPB world trade indicator, trade volumes grew
sharply in the 3 months to November, increasing
by 2.1% over the previous 3 month period, the
fastest growth in almost 3 years. While trade grew
for both advanced and emerging economies, most
of the recorded improvement came from emerging
markets, primarily in Asia, which saw positive
trade growth in the 3 months to November, after
negative readings in the summer. This contrasts
with the forward looking PMI measures that
indicate stronger dynamics in advanced
economies.
In 2012 and 2013, global trade growth was
somewhat below the growth of global output. In
2014-15, global trade is expected to resume
growing more rapidly than GDP, as trade-intensive
sectors among which investment, provide a greater
impetus to economic expansion. Growth in trade
volumes is thus expected to accelerate, also
reflecting the gradual strengthening of the global
recovery, notably in advanced economies. Total
world export growth is now expected to have been
2.7% in 2013, and to accelerate more markedly to
5.1% in 2014 and 5.8% in 2015.
… as advanced economies outside the EU are
gathering speed …

Among advanced economies outside the EU,
activity has been gathering momentum faster than
expected in the US as headwinds from fiscal policy
wane, and private consumption gains speed,

12

Global PMI manufacturing (rhs)

The domestic short-term risks from fiscal and
monetary policy uncertainty in the US have also
clearly diminished following the budget deal in
December, the decision to extend the debt limit up
to 2015 in February, as well as the reinforcement
of forward guidance by the Fed. Momentum is
expected to improve over the forecast horizon with
fading fiscal drag, improving business investment
and steady recovery in the housing market. Japan's
economy is expected to grow in 2014 at the same
pace as in 2013, with some variability in the near
term reflecting the impact of fiscal policy
decisions. In 2015, GDP growth is forecast to slow
down on the back of fading monetary stimulus and
additional fiscal measures. All in all, output
growth in advanced economies is forecast to
accelerate from 1.2% in 2013 to 2.2% in 2014 and
2.5% in 2015.
… while growth prospects in emerging markets
have become more differentiated.

The situation in emerging markets has become
more and more differentiated. Late January 2014
saw renewed financial turbulence, with sharp
currency drops for a number of EMEs with weak
economic fundamentals (particularly Argentina,
South Africa, and Turkey) and sharp falls in stock
markets in both developing and developed
economies. Renewed uncertainty about the pace of
US monetary tapering, concerns over Chinese
growth dynamics, as well as political tensions in
some countries, have, among other factors,
contributed to the observed shift in market
sentiment.

EA and EU outlook

This variation in cyclical and structural
vulnerabilities is also reflected in revisions to the
forecast. While the outlook for Turkey and Russia
has deteriorated recently, on the back of tightened
financial conditions mirroring macro-economic
vulnerabilities and weak policy frameworks, it has
improved for other EU candidate countries and
India. China's economy continued to grow rapidly
in 2013, at 7.7%, with investment recovering
sharply from a weak first quarter to provide the
major contribution to growth. In 2014-15, China's
growth is forecast to slow down to around 7½% as
the composition of demand shifts away from
investment towards higher consumption. However,
achieving a smooth rotation of demand remains a
challenge, particularly in the context of a fragile
financial system. Emerging markets as a group are
expected to grow at 5% in 2014 and 5.3% in 2015,
following growth of 4.6% in 2013.
Moderation of commodity prices ahead

Brent prices increased in the third quarter of 2013
but subsequently eased in January 2014 to
USD107 per barrel and are expected to continue
declining gradually over the forecast horizon.
Though global growth is picking up, a significant
rebound in oil prices is unlikely due to sufficient
supply, substitution of oil by other cheaper fuels
and efficiency gains in oil consumption. A possible
escalation of geopolitical tensions in the MENA
region remains a risk factor. The assumptions for
Brent prices are the following: USD 104.1/bbl in

2014, decreasing to USD 99.6/bbl in 2015,
compared to a price of USD 108.8/bbl in 2013 (see
Box I.5).
The performance of other commodity markets was
mainly weak in 2013. A slight increase of the price
of the food aggregate in 2013 was driven by higher
prices of seafood and meat whereas the prices of
main cereals, maize, rice and wheat, declined.
Owing to an improved outlook for supply, food
prices are projected to ease in 2014. Prices of
metals and raw materials were on a declining trend
in 2013 due to abundant supply and weak demand
conditions. A modest recovery of prices is
expected in 2014-15 supported by increasing
demand in both advanced and emerging countries.
3.

FINANCIAL MARKETS IN EUROPE

Financial markets, globally and in the EU, have,
until recently, continued to perform strongly on the
back of an improving economic outlook, while the
sustained low-interest rate environment and
positive corporate reports supported risk appetite.
Positive market sentiment was further underpinned
by progress with the repair of bank balance sheets.
Most recently, however, market tensions in some
emerging market economies have arisen, while
investors have started to ponder the potential
negative impact of the Federal Reserve's tapering.
The EU Member States have been largely spared
by these events.

excess liquidity in the EU banking system late in
2013.

The ECB further eased monetary policy …

While the phasing out of unconventional monetary
stimulus started end-2013 in the US and market
expectations of interest rate hikes in the UK
increased, the ECB lowered its main policy rate
(MRO) by 25bps in November amid a subdued
outlook for inflation in the euro area. It extended
its fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment
at least until the end of the second quarter of 2015,
thereby ensuring that euro-area banks would retain
access to central- bank liquidity at the MRO rate
well after the end of the two 3-year LTROs. In
addition, the Governing Council reiterated its
forward guidance and committed to maintain a
high degree of monetary accommodation by taking
further decisive action if needed.
… which contributes to keeping benchmark
funding costs very low in the euro area.

Reflecting the tapering of the asset purchase
programme by the US Federal Reserve and the
more muted outlook for inflation in the euro area,
the gap between the US 10-year Treasury yield and
the German 10-year Bund yield increased
somewhat further. Meanwhile, most euro-area
peripheral sovereign-bond spreads continued to
tighten significantly amid ongoing adjustment of
fiscal fundamentals (see graph I.7). Debt auctions
met high demand in a sign of investor confidence
in the success of the ongoing fiscal adjustment and
economic reforms.

In the euro-area corporate bond markets, spreads

Benign financial market conditions in the euroarea internalise high expectations …

Investors seem currently confident in further
economic expansion, a smooth implementation of
the Banking Union, governments' continued
commitment to structural, fiscal and institutional
reforms, and the sustained balance-sheet repair in
the different sectors of the economy. Given the
modest economic growth, high public debt, and, in
some cases, the persistent nexus between banks
and sovereigns, the risk of another increase in
sovereign spreads remains.

lingering
uncertainties over the quality of banks' assets.
There has been progress in the solvency positions
of euro-area banks while funding conditions at the
aggregate euro-area level continued to normalise.
Banks reduced their reliance on central-bank
funding (6) while turning to more stable funding
sources such as deposits, including in several
vulnerable Member States. However, profit
generation continues to be a challenge. Interest
margins are still compressed while poor credit
quality persists in the countries where high privatesector indebtedness interacts with subdued
economic growth and high unemployment. Banks
increased the recognition of loan losses, with nonperforming loans provisioning contributing
significantly to their low profitability.
The general improvement notwithstanding, access
to medium- and long-term market funding at
sustainable costs remains a challenge for a number
of mid-sized and small euro-area banks in
vulnerable countries. Investors' prudence regarding
bank balance sheets is reflected in banks'
valuations remaining below the book value since
2009, while the valuations of US peers have risen
above par during 2013. Some of this difference
may relate to subdued profitability prospects for

euro-area banks but it also relates to investor
uncertainty over the quality of banks' assets.
So far, the recovery has remained essentially
creditless (see graph I.8). Credit flows to the
private sector shrank over the last months (-2.1%
y-o-y in December, adjusted for sales and
securitisation), and lending volumes to nonfinancial corporations continued falling. However,
net issuance of long-term debt securities by nonfinancial corporations continued to be buoyant
(11% y-o-y in November), partly offsetting the
weakness in bank lending as larger corporations
continued the transition towards market financing.
The bank lending weakness is influenced by
temporary factors on both the supply and demand
side. The upcoming AQR is expected to create the
incentive for banks to clean up their balance
sheets, recognise non-performing assets and
strengthen their capital basis. Banks' willingness to
frontload balance sheet adjustments (7) has likely
contributed to the weak supply of credit most
recently. Weak credit demand can be partially
explained by the early stage of the economic
expansion where firms tap internal funding to
finance investment. Moreover, high corporate
indebtedness may continue to weigh on demand
for some time.

households (see graph I.9). Loan demand was
expected to strongly rebound in first months of
2014. The survey also points to a slight reduction
in lending condition disparities across euro-area
countries, a trend also visible in most recent data
on lending volumes and interest rates. However,
heterogeneity of lending conditions remains very
high as banks are not yet translating the improved
funding conditions into better lending conditions.

The AQR will be based on end-2013 balance sheet data.

Economic activity in Europe has passed an
inflection point in the first half of 2013 with
positive real GDP growth, albeit weak and uneven,
returning to the EU and the euro area. Following
six quarters without positive growth, GDP started
rising in the second quarter of 2013 in the EU and
the euro area, and the upward trend was confirmed
throughout the year. In the fourth quarter,
Eurostat's flash estimates for GDP growth has been
0.4% in the EU and 0.3% in the euro area.
However, for 2013 as a whole, due to large
negative carry-over effects from 2012, GDP is
expected to have only slightly increased in the EU
(0.1%) and declined in the euro area (-0.4%)
(see table I.2 and table I.3). The recovery is at its
early stages and output volumes are still markedly
below the pre-crisis levels of the first half of 2008
in both the EU and the euro area (by about 1½% in
the EU and 2½% in the euro area). This is

nevertheless, in line with empirical evidence of full
recoveries following deep financial crisis. (8)
As regards GDP components in 2013 the rebound
has increasingly benefitted from positive
contributions from domestic demand. (9) In the
euro area, in the third quarter all components of
domestic demand expanded, at least modestly.
While private consumption expanded only
marginally (0.1% q-o-q), gross fixed capital
formation moved up 0.4% and changes in
inventories made a substantial contribution. For
the first time since the beginning of 2010, net
exports put a drag on growth as export growth
declined in response to moderate global activity
outside the EU while imports grew more strongly.
The strengthening of economic activity has been
observed in most Member States, but so far growth
was primarily supported by developments in the
UK and Germany, also in line with their respective
weights in the EU aggregate. Most vulnerable
countries also managed a return to positive growth
in the second or third quarter of 2013, in particular

fourth. Italy emerged from recession in the fourth
quarter, though very timidly. Moreover, available
information about developments in GDP
components point to progress in intra-euro-area
rebalancing with a strong export performance in
some vulnerable Member States and signs of
strengthening domestic demand in surplus
countries.
… with moderate growth expected in the short
term …

The short-term outlook for GDP is for a
continuation of moderate growth in the EU and the
euro area (unchanged at 0.3% q-o-q in the euro
area and 0.4% in the EU in the first quarter). In
fact, in recent months, business indicators have
increased further. Continuing along its upward
trend since May 2013, the Commission’s
Economic Sentiment Indicator has passed its longterm average in September in the EU and in
December in the euro area. In January 2014,
business sentiment has kept on increasing but the
pace of improvement has slightly moderated and
was less broad-based across sectors than in the few
months before, suggesting a still fragile recovery.
Other recent indicators also suggest that economic
activity keeps strengthening. In January, the euroarea PMI Composite Output Index reached its
highest level since mid-2011 (52.9), signalling

capital formation should be supported by
improving sentiment and lower uncertainty, more
favourable funding conditions, higher domestic
and external demand, together with the need to
replace an ageing capital stock after a marked
adjustment phase. Private consumption is expected
to gain some momentum as the stabilisation in
labour markets continues; real disposable incomes
benefit from lower consumer price inflation and
the drag of fiscal consolidation diminishes.
Following two years of declining public
consumption, a very moderate expansion was seen
in 2013 that is expected to continue as fiscal
consolidation decelerates.

… and strengthening over the forecast horizon.

Over the forecast horizon, real GDP is expected to
continue the recovery at moderate pace, on the
back of a further gradual strengthening of domestic
demand. In 2014, the GDP growth forecast stands
at 1.5% for the EU and 1.2% for the euro area.
Domestic demand is notably expected to benefit
from the gradual weakening of the impediments
stemming from the financial and economic crisis
(see section I). The expansion of gross fixed

In 2015, a further acceleration of GDP growth is
expected in the EU and the euro area of 2.0% and
1.8%, respectively. The recovery though gaining
speed would remain low by historical standards.
The expansion should reflect a stronger
contribution from domestic demand. Gross fixed
capital formation is expected in particular to
become more robust and private consumption
growth to get support from slightly improving
labour market conditions whereas public
consumption continues its modest expansion (see
graph I.11). The impact of already implemented
structural reforms is also expected to reinforce
those positive developments in 2015.

Gross fixed capital formation has started
rebounding …

After declining strongly for several quarters, gross
fixed capital formation has started to rebound
timidly in the first half of 2013 and is expected to
have gained some momentum up to the final
quarter of 2013. For 2013 as whole, due to
substantial declines in late 2012 and early 2013,
the annual growth rate would remain in negative
territory in the EU (-2.5%) and in the euro area
(-3.0%). Investment volumes are still relatively
low at this early stage of the rebound, dampened
by weak fundamentals and the crisis legacy.
… on the back of a revival in equipment
investment.

For early 2014, available indicators suggest a
continued but moderate expansion for equipment
investment.
Production
expectations
and
confidence indicators from the Commission’s
survey in manufacturing have increased above
their long-term average and capacity utilisation
rates have moderately moved up, though
remaining at low levels (see graph I.12). The euroarea manufacturing PMI reached a 32-month high
in January, signalling expansion.
Over the forecast horizon, financing conditions are
expected to become more benign and support
funding needs of companies, also in the vulnerable
countries. Improved financing conditions, together
with increasing margins and widening profits as
the recovery advances are set to support equipment
investment spending further. However, since
inflation expectations have been sagging, real
interest rates are somewhat higher than in the
autumn. In 2014, equipment investment is set to
grow by 4.6% in the euro area and 4.8% in the EU,
accelerating to about 6% in 2015 in both areas in
line with a firming domestic demand.

18

After falling for a few years, construction
investment is projected to resume growing in 2014
and accelerate further in 2015. It is however set to
remain weak on the back of still depressed euroarea housing markets. A contraction in
construction investment is even expected to persist
in Spain in 2015. Overall, in 2015, total gross fixed
capital formation is set to increase, mainly
supported by the rebound in equipment
investment, by 4.2% in the EU and by 3.6% in the
euro area.
Private consumption exhibited marginal
growth at the onset of the recovery …

Recent developments in private consumption, the
largest GDP component, suggest that it will
become an important driver of the ongoing
recovery. After falling during the recession years,
private consumption growth had become
marginally positive in the second quarter of 2013
and kept on increasing in the third quarter though
still modestly. All in all in 2013, private
consumption stagnated in the EU and receded in
the euro area (-0.7%).
A key reason for weak consumption growth so far
has been the large squeeze on real gross disposable
incomes, mainly attributable to muted wage
growth alongside a weak labour market situation.
On the nominal side, growth in compensation of
employees fell to 0.2% in 2013 in the EU in the
context of shrinking employment (-0.4% in the
number of persons employed) and moderate
increases in wages per head (1.6% in the EU).
Moreover, non-labour incomes, which include
profit income, increased only slightly. Private
wealth remained constrained by weak housing
market developments after the financial crisis had
wiped out a substantial part of the net worth of

EA and EU outlook

debtors. This resulted in tight borrowing
constraints and low liquidity, which forced some
households to cut back on consumption,
particularly in countries with highly leveraged
households.
Developments in the households' saving rates are
also key for private consumption growth.
Households can respond to a fall in income in two
ways: by increasing precautionary savings or, by
lowering savings to uphold consumption. During
the 2012-13 recession, high uncertainty might have
raised precautionary savings (10), but relatively low
real interest rates could also have favoured current
consumption, partly offsetting the previous effect.
In total, the households saving rate remained
broadly unchanged in the euro area and the EU.

consumer confidence are also expected to boost
households spending. Moreover, lower HICP
inflation is expected to lift households' real
disposable income. However, in some Member
States, the need for deleveraging should continue
weighing on private consumption. There, the
strength of private consumption will depend on the
spending patterns of households simultaneously
engaged in deleveraging processes. (11) At the
aggregate level, most of the increase in disposable
incomes is expected to be spent, leaving the saving
rate constant. Overall, private consumption is
expected to rebound by 1.1% in the EU and to
0.7% in the euro area. In 2015, with labour market
conditions starting to improve more markedly and
wages increasing, private consumption is set to
accelerate to 1.7% in the EU and 1.4% in the euro
area.

As regards private consumption, both recent
developments and the outlook differ markedly
across Member States. Focusing on the seven
largest economies, growth rates varied in 2013
from -2½% (Italy and Spain) to 2½% (UK). This
reflects differences in developments in disposable
incomes with increases in Germany and France
and losses in Italy and Spain; and in deleveraging
needs.
… but is expected to rebound stronger as the
recovery takes ground.

In the near-term private consumption is expected
to grow moderately, in line with a gradually
increasing real disposable income. Short-term
indicators point to continued muted developments
in private consumption. The consumer confidence
indicator increased almost steadily since spring
2013 and has surpassed the long-term average (see
graph I.13). In January 2014, the Commission’s
retail trade confidence indicator reached the
highest level since mid-2013, standing clearly
above its long-term averages in both areas.
However, the indicator of households' intentions to
make major purchases remained at low levels,
suggesting that consumers are still cautious in
deciding to purchase durable goods.
Over 2014, private consumption is expected to
gain some strength as nominal disposable income
turns visibly positive, on the back of improved
employment prospects and increased wages. A
slower pace of fiscal consolidation and higher

Public consumption back to tiny expansion as
the pace of fiscal consolidation slows down

In line with fiscal consolidation needs, government
consumption had decreased in the EU and the euro
area during 2011-12, but returned to positive
growth rates in 2013. Increases were notably
recorded since the second quarter of 2013, after a
stable outcome in the first quarter. For 2013 as a
whole, government consumption is expected to
have increased in the EU by 0.4% (0.3% in the
euro area). Looking at the components of
government consumption, in the euro area
compensation of employees shifted from declining
to increasing nominal expenditure, on the back of
past wage agreements in the public sector (-0.3%
in 2012 to 1.0% in 2013). Disinflation is set to

Over the forecast horizon, with weaker

Net exports supported the rebound in GDP in
the first half of 2013, …

Following the very strong expansion of exports of
goods and services by about 2% (q-o-q) in the
second quarter of 2013 in both the EU and the euro
area, the third quarter saw exports stagnating in the
EU and growing by just ¼% in the euro area. The
latest decline in export growth was mainly driven
by slowing extra-EU demand, but also by the
nominal appreciation of the euro. The growth of
total imports had also turned positive in both areas
in the second and third quarters (1½% and 1¼%
respectively) reflecting the strengthening of
domestic demand. With imports growing more
strongly than exports, the contribution from net
exports to GDP growth turned negative in the third
quarter.
… but will diminish over the forecast horizon …

In the short term, further export growth is expected
in line with the increasing foreign demand for EU
products. In fact, manufacturing export order
books from the Commission's surveys have
improved further in the latest months, being above
their long-term averages, and so did new export
orders in the manufacturing PMI (see graph I.14).
For the year 2013 as a whole, EU export growth is
expected to have slowed to 1½%, before
accelerating in 2014 (4%) and 2015 (5½%) on the
back of a rebound in economic activity outside the
EU. Following moderate growth in 2013
(½%), import growth is expected to expand almost
in parallel to exports. This is also related to the

Export growth outperformed import growth in
2013, and net exports should have contributed
positively to GDP growth. This picture is expected
to change over the forecast as imports strengthen
in line with the pick-up in domestic demand. Net
exports' contribution would be more than halved in
2014-15 compared to 2013, though remaining
slightly positive.

Strengthening current-account surplus in the
euro area

The trade balances of the euro area and the EU
were positively affected by the increase in export
volumes in 2013. Moreover, the long-lasting
weakening of economic activity in the EU and
shrinking private consumption volumes have left
their mark on imports. Import prices declining

After years of having a roughly balanced external
position, the current-account balance of both the
EU and the euro area has now shifted into a more
marked surplus (in adjusted terms) and is expected
to have been close to 1¼% and 2¼% of GDP,
respectively in 2013. Moreover, it is forecast to
stay broadly at those levels in 2014 and 2015.
Most of the strengthening in the euro-area current
account is the result of significant adjustment in
the vulnerable countries, which previously
recorded high deficits. External rebalancing in
vulnerable euro-area Member States is supported
by gains in price competiveness due to lower unit
labour costs as well as by the permanent
contraction of domestic demand induced by
reductions in overblown construction investments,
corrections in future income expectations and
increases in structural unemployment (see box I.3).
Going forward, the expected recovery in domestic
demand is set to slow down the growth of net
exports so that the pace of improvement in current
accounts of vulnerable Member Sates starts
reducing.

LABOUR MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE EU

After declining for almost two years, employment
(i.e. the number of persons employed) stabilised in
the second quarter of 2013 and remained
unchanged in the third quarter, while
unemployment rates have stopped increasing since
mid-2013.

Labour market conditions have stabilised since
the second half of 2013 …

In the second half of 2013, the unemployment rate
remained broadly unchanged in the EU and the
euro area, after being on the rise for the last five
years. In December, the unemployment rate
declined very timidly in the EU to 10.7% (from
10.8% in November) while it stood unchanged at
12.0 % in the euro area (after peaking at 12.1% in
the summer), remaining in both areas at
historically high levels. Since the summer, the
youth unemployment rate has also started to recede
in the EU and to stabilise in the euro area, but this
partly reflects a falling participation rate. In
December 2013, it reached 23.2% in the EU and
23.9% in the euro area, compared to 23.7% and
24.2% a year earlier.
With output growth accelerating only slowly and
in view of the lagged response of employment to
the cycle, little net job creation is expected to take
place in the short term. Most of the latest survey
measures of hiring intentions have continued to
increase in recent months, but remain at low levels.
According to Commission surveys, in industry
employment expectations in the EU and euro area
have steadily increased up to January 2014 and
slightly exceed the long-term average, whereas
expectations in the services sector despite being on
an upward trend remain low. In the construction
sector, hiring intentions have been more volatile
and are still below their long-term average.
Consumers' unemployment fears have almost
steadily declined from the peaks observed in late
2012, having fallen below their long-term averages
(see graph I.16).

The subdued recovery of economic activity is
expected to lead to only a minor positive impact on
employment in 2014 (0.3% and 0.5% respectively
in the euro area and the EU) but more visible ones
in 2015 (0.7% in both zones) (see table I.4).
Private employment growth is projected to still be
dampened by the scope for firms to increase hours
per employee, which are still below their pre-crisis
level, before hiring new staff. Besides, the limited
access to funding for SMEs in some countries,
could also negatively impact their hiring decisions;
and those firms usually have a leading role in
employment creation.

mirrors first the fragility of the economic recovery
but could reflect inter-alia a higher structural
unemployment than in the pre-crisis years. Low
productivity gains, the impact of long-term
unemployment on skills and future employability
of youth, labour market mismatches due to the
sectoral adjustment process in some countries,
together with a decline in production capacity are
preventing unemployment declining markedly.
This is also mirrored by the rise in the NAWRU,
which according to the Commission estimates has
increased substantially since 2008. (14)

The labour force in the EU and the euro area is
estimated to grow moderately in 2013-15, in line
with population of working age. The "added
worker effect" (resulting from the need of an
additional income for households hit by the crisis)
which characterised the response of participation
until 2012 is set to be more than offset by stronger
discouragement effects and falling participation of
the youth, in particular in the countries with high
long-term unemployment rates. (13)

After being on the rise since 2009, the
unemployment rate is expected to remain
unchanged in 2014, at 12.0% in the euro area,
while slightly receding to 10.7% in the EU. In
2015, the unemployment rate is expected to
slightly decline in both areas, to 11.7% in the euro
area and 10.4% in the EU, remaining at historically
high levels (see graph I.17). Such a slow decline

divergent output developments, as well as different
responses of employment to output. However, the
unemployment rate should see a decline in most of
the EU Member States by the end of the forecast
horizon.
The variable labour market conditions across
countries are also reflected in diverging wage
developments. Since 2011, real wage increases
have lagged behind productivity growth in most
high-unemployment countries facing substantial
internal and external adjustment needs. Looking
ahead, wage moderation is set to continue in
vulnerable Member States allowing for a further
gradual improvement in price competitiveness. On
the other hand a notable rise in unit labour costs
was observed in countries with relatively low
unemployment and real wages per head are set to
grow faster than in the pre-crisis years, notably in
Germany.

… and so did underlying inflation.

Core inflation, i.e. all-item HICP inflation
excluding energy and unprocessed food, remained
quite persistent in the first three quarters of 2013
(at 1.5% in the EU and 1.3% in the euro area over
that period), as the underlying inflation pressures
were still distorted by second-round effects from
previous hikes in energy prices and changes in
taxation in a number of Member States. In the
fourth quarter, as those factors faded away, core
inflation decreased to 1.1% in the EU and 1.0% in
the euro area. Notably, the impact of tax hikes and
administrated prices was smaller in the fourth
quarter than during the rest of 2013. The inflation
measure adjusted for tax changes (15) stood at 1.1%
in the EU and 1% in the euro area in 2013.
Moreover, the theoretical impact of changes in
taxation on inflation varied in 2013 from
-0.1 pp. in Denmark and Lithuania to 1.4 pps. in
Spain, masking somewhat the underlying price
pressures.

INFLATION IN THE EU
A protracted period of low inflation …

Inflation slowed down in 2013 …

In the EU and the euro area, consumer-price
inflation has been trending downwards throughout
2013 on the back of falling energy prices, together
with still weak economic conditions. In 2013,
HICP inflation averaged 1.5% and 1.4%
respectively in the EU and the euro area, compared
to 2.6% and 2.5% in 2012 (see Graph I.18). The
easing of price pressures was accentuated towards
the end of the year by the fading impact of
temporary factors – past increases in taxation in a
number of Member States linked to fiscal
consolidation needs and some volatility in
commodity prices. Also a marked appreciation of
the euro, contributed to decreasing price pressures
from imported goods in 2013.

%
forecast

4

Looking ahead, with the underlying price trend
likely to remain subdued and continued downward
trend in commodity prices, average annual HICP
inflation in 2014 is predicted to ease further to
around 1% in both areas on the back of weak
demand in the current cyclical phase, reinforced by
relative price adjustments. Inflation appears to
have become more reactive to the output gap
recently, possibly driven by a reduction of nominal
rigidities, in particular in vulnerable Member
States that have implemented significant structural
reforms in the recent past (see Box I.4).
With a gradual reduction of the output gap over the
forecast horizon, the dampening cyclical impact on
price pressures is likely to fade, and a muted
increase in HICP inflation is expected in the course
of 2015. Average HICP inflation in 2015 in the EU
and euro area is set to increase slightly to 1.5% and
1.3% respectively.

substantially to 1.0% in the third quarter of 2013.
With improved economic prospects ahead,
productivity gains are set to accelerate towards the
end of the forecast horizon to 1% in the euro area
and 1.2% in the EU. Combined with a modest
recovery in wage growth (to about 2% in 2015 in
both areas), growth in unit-labour-cost is set to
stabilise below 1% per year, indicating modest
inflation pressures from the labour market.

The subdued inflation outlook is corroborated by
developments in upstream price pressures which
have been declining since spring 2011. Producer
prices excluding construction, fell further and
turned negative in mid-2013 both in the EU and
the euro area. In December, they declined by 0.6%
y-o-y in the EU. Assuming a partial pass-through
of producer prices to consumer prices, this
foreshadows continuing disinflationary pressures
in the months ahead, given the overall weakness in
economic conditions and the assumptions for
commodity-price developments.

the spot rates of inflation-linked swaps observed in
January 2014 imply an average annual inflation
rate of 1.1% over 2014-16. Over the medium term,
inflation expectations derived from inflation-linked
swap rates at the three-years-forward-three-yearsahead horizon, imply an average inflation rate of
1.7% in 2017-19. At the same time, five-year
inflation-linked swap rates five years ahead, the
most widely used measure of long-term inflation
expectations, have been relatively stable at slightly
above 2%. The marked-based indicators suggest
that long-term inflation expectations are being
well-anchored at the current juncture on the back
of high central bank credibility. In the short to
medium term, however, markets expect inflation to
remain low.

Survey indicators of producer and consumer price
expectations seem to signal low but positive
inflation developments in the short term. As
regards producers' expectations, the PMI
manufacturing input price index, after recording a
trough in mid-2013, revived substantially and
stands slightly above the 50-mark in January,
indicating an increase in future prices, amid better
economic news. By contrast, output price
expectations (i.e. selling prices) proved very stable
over the same period hovering around the 50-mark,
suggesting a feeble pricing power of companies
due to weak demand prospects. In the course of
2013, consumers' inflation expectations followed
the inflation trend downward and suggest low
inflation in the short term (see graph I.19).
The market-based euro-area inflation expectations

PUBLIC FINANCES IN THE EU

Consolidation of public finances continuing but
at a slower pace

After significant fiscal consolidation in recent
years, headline deficits are projected to keep
falling, although at a gradually slowing pace, over
the forecast horizon. This pattern of consolidation
is consistent with the ongoing correction of
excessive deficits. (16)
The reduction in the headline deficit in 2013
stemmed mainly from continuous underlying fiscal
effort, as the uptick in economic activity remained
modest in 2013. As a result of the significant fiscal
consolidation achieved by several Member States,

and to stabilise in 2015, as the recovery slowly
broadens, and given further deficit-reducing
measures included by Member States in their
budgets for this year. While showing some
differentiation, reflecting varying degrees of
financial and fiscal stress, the improvement in
budget balances is likely to be broad-based across
Member States in 2014. As a result, the fiscal
deficit is expected to fall to 2.7% of GDP in 2014
in the EU and to 2.6% in the euro area, and to
remain roughly at these levels in 2015 (see
graph I.20).

one-offs and other temporary measures, is forecast
to have remained at above ½ pp. of GDP in both
areas in 2013, but it is expected to slow down in
2014. In 2015, under the usual no-policy-change
assumption, the structural deficit is expected to
widen.
Fiscal consolidation moving from revenue
increases to expenditure-based

The fiscal adjustment in 2013 has been mainly
revenue-based in both the EU and the euro area, as
it was the case in the previous two years. The
increase in public revenues has been driven by tax
receipts on income and wealth and as a result, the
revenue-to-GDP ratio is set to have risen further
before reaching a peak in 2014 in the EU and euro
area at 45.9% and 46.8% respectively. Further
ahead, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is forecast to
decline, reflecting the phasing-out of temporary
tax-increasing measures and some tax cuts planned
in a number of Member States (see graph I.21).

afterwards in both areas, to become the main
driver of the fiscal consolidation in 2014. In 2014
expenditure cuts are expected to take the form of
discretionary fiscal measures involving mainly
wages and salaries, as well as intermediate
consumption and, only to lesser extent, public
investment. In 2015, the decrease in the
expenditure-to-GDP would compensate the lower
revenue-to-GDP ratio.
Debt ratios reaching a peak in 2014

The debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to have
increased in 2013 and move up further in 2014,
though at a somewhat lower pace. In 2014, debt is
expected to reach a peak 89.7% of GDP in the EU
and 95.9% in the euro area (see table I.6). In 2015,
it is set to start decreasing in both areas. The
increase of the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2014 for the
euro area is mainly due to the strong contribution
of the interest expenditure and the stock-flow
adjustment. In 2014 and 2015, the faster economic
growth and the higher primary surpluses will start
having a reducing impact on the public debt-toGDP ratio.
8.

RISKS

The recent string of positive economic news has
helped to balance the risks to the growth outlook
since the autumn forecast, but on the whole
downside risks continue to prevail (see graph I.22).
The main risk to the forecast would be stalling or
partial implementation of structural, fiscal and
institutional reforms at Member States or European
level, resulting in low actual and potential growth

26

and protracted high unemployment. A weaker than
projected labour market would have both shortand medium-term detrimental effects on private
consumption and also on potential growth.
Moreover, the debt overhang, the investment
shortfall in recent years and slowing total factor
productivity could hurt growth in the medium term
if they are inadequately addressed by structural
reforms (see box I.2), resulting in an extended
period of low growth. The expectation of lower
potential growth could feed back into investment
and consumption, thus dampening growth also in
the short term.
This risk of low growth would be exacerbated in
the short term if inflation were to turn out lowerthan-expected and the reduction in financial
fragmentation were to be less than anticipated.
Inflation could turn out even lower than expected
in the central scenario. Slower import price
increases could come from a more pronounced
weakness of emerging markets, particularly if
combined with even lower commodities prices and
a further appreciation of the euro. Within the EU,
inflation could be dragged down if economic
agents were to judge that very weak price
pressures were becoming entrenched. This would
affect real interest rates, hurt demand and increase
the real debt burden. The risk of deflation in the
EU, i.e. the emergence of a broad-based and selfsustaining downward trend in prices, cannot not be
totally ruled out, but given the gradually
strengthening recovery, the increase in confidence
and the ongoing efforts to improve the health of
the banking system, it is very unlikely.

EA and EU outlook

The materialisation of the central scenario, in a
context of still elevated deleveraging needs in the
private and banking sectors, depends on further
decreases of financial fragmentation. An
improvement in lending conditions this year and
next rests on the success of the AQR and stress
tests in cleaning balance sheets and removing
uncertainty about the health of euro-area banks.
Smooth implementation of the Banking Union,
which should improve confidence, is also crucial.

Downside risks could also come from heightened
instability in emerging markets' financing
conditions. The impact has so far centred on
emerging market economies with relatively weak
fundamentals. Continued and more generalised
turmoil could hit the EU economy through lower
trade, and the portfolio and banking channels. A
more generalised re-assessment of risks could
notably lead to a flight of capital to the highest
rated countries in the euro area, raising

sovereign-bond spreads in the periphery.
Continued turmoil would also trigger a slowdown
in EMEs, together with an appreciation of the euro,
putting a drag on the recovery which is still
dependent on exports in many countries. Overall,
the EU banking sector seems relatively shielded by
its small exposure to major EMEs, but some
Member States are more exposed than others.
The recovery could also be stronger than
envisaged. Upside risks are related to positive
feedback loops between confidence, GDP and
investment growth, and the ability of the banking
sector to lend. Positive reinforcing feedbacks
between these factors would reduce further the
drags stemming from the crisis, and boost growth.
More precisely, economic expansion could be
stronger than envisaged in the central scenario if
domestic demand is firmer in the core countries
and helps further the rebalancing process; if
confidence effects lead to a stronger rebound of
investment; if the competitiveness boost in
peripheral countries is larger than envisaged and
finally if financial fragmentation is reduced to a
greater extent in 2015, following a successful AQR
and the introduction of the Single Supervisory
Mechanism. In the medium term, the
implementation of additional and bold structural
reforms could lift further the potential growth of
Member States, with positive impact also in the
short term, notably through increased confidence.
Eventually, a stronger economic recovery than
envisaged in the central scenario would raise the
inflation projections, in particular if recent
structural reforms result in a faster reduction in
unemployment than expected.

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2014

Box I.1: The economic effects of policy uncertainty
Since the outbreak of the crisis, the interest in the
effects of uncertainty on the real economy has
dramatically increased. Whereas most studies focus
on the effects of uncertainty on GDP (1) or
investment and consumption (2) decisions, this box
attempts to assess its impact on industrial new
orders, which is a variable commonly agreed to be
leading the business cycle. It is assumed that
increased uncertainty induces companies to lower
their orders in anticipation of lower demand from
investors and consumers (3). While economic agents
can be confronted with uncertainty from a number
of different sources, this box focusses on the effect
of uncertainty generated by major events related to
the financial and sovereign-debt crisis. The analysis
suggests that there are immediate, statistically
significant and economically sizeable negative
effects from crisis-related uncertainty on new
orders.
How to measure uncertainty produced by the
financial and sovereign-debt crisis?

major events and decisions related to the financial

(2013), DG ECFIN, European Commission.
According to economic theory, high uncertainty gives
agents an incentive to postpone or cancel their
investment, consumption or employment decisions
when the latter are costly to revert (e.g. due to fixed
and adjustment costs), thereby depressing economic
activity. See e.g. Bernanke, B., 1983. Irreversibility,
uncertainty, and cyclical investment, The Quarterly
Journal of Economics, MIT Press, Vol. 98(1), pp. 85106, February.

and sovereign-debt crisis, the analysis relies on the
"Economic Policy Uncertainty Index" (EPUI) for
the EU, developed at Stanford University (4). This
index combines a news-based indicator (counting
crisis-related words that appear in EU newspapers)
with others based on the dispersion of consumerprice / budget-deficit forecasts.
Graph 1 shows that the EPUI adequately captures
the uncertainty caused by major crisis-related
events. Furthermore, Graph 2 suggests that
uncertainty significantly and negatively weighs on
important macro-economic variables, such as
investment.
It can be noted that, after the peak at the end of
2011, the index has been following a downward
path; the current level of uncertainty, however, is
still significantly higher than it was on average in
the pre-crisis period.
An appropriate framework to analyse the effect
of uncertainty on new orders

To distil the effect of uncertainty on industrial new
orders, the EPUI is added as an explanatory
variable in the model developed by de Bondt,
Dieden, Muzikarova and Vincze (BDMV), which is
used by the ECB to produce official estimates of

Several Member States discontinued the production
of official data on industrial new orders in 2012. The
ECB stepped in with a model producing estimates of
new orders for these countries. These are then
combined with hard-data series on new orders from
Member States still collecting such data through their
statistical institutes. See de Bondt et al., 2013.
Introducing the ECB indicator on euro area
industrial new orders, ECB Occasional Paper Series
No 149 / June 2013. The resulting aggregate euroarea new orders indicator can be downloaded from
the ECB Statistical Data Warehouse.
Using the regression residuals is necessary since the
PMI new orders index and the EU BCS question on
order books are potentially multi-collinear. By
contrast, no multi-collinearity was found between the
Economic Policy Uncertainty Index and the 3-month
change of the BCS question on order books (as well
as its first difference).

Uncertainty matters for new orders

We find that the EPUI has a significantly negative
contemporaneous impact on new orders growth in
case of all entities examined. Adding the
uncertainty indicator to the baseline BDMV
model (7) drives up the adjusted R2 by 4-5 points.
The results are robust to the inclusion of a dummy
for the period 2008m1-2009m12 in order to control
for the effects of the global recession. Thus, the
diagnosed uncertainty effect is not just a result of
extreme increases in uncertainty registered in the
years 2008/09 which coincided with sharp drops in
new orders growth.
The magnitude of the uncertainty coefficient (over
the full sample 1997-2013) is quite similar for the
euro area aggregate and Germany, while the Italian
coefficient is around two and the French 2½ times
larger (see Table 1 – first row). One would indeed
expect core countries like Germany, which are
supposedly less exposed to the euro crisis, to
register a considerably lower uncertainty effect
than a more vulnerable country like Italy. A
seemingly surprising finding is that the effect of
EU uncertainty on French new orders growth is
slightly higher than in Italy. This result must be put
into the context of the volatility level of new orders
growth, which substantially differs among the
examined countries. The standard deviation of new
orders growth in France, for example, is
particularly high, owing to the significant impact of
new orders in the aircraft industry. Re-running the
regressions with the dependent variable in
standardised form changes the picture: Germany
registers the lowest uncertainty effect and is
followed by France, the euro area and Italy.
Uncertainty exerts substantial and immediate
effects on new orders

Using the baseline results (Table 1 – first row), it is
possible to get a flavour of the sizeable negative
impact that uncertainty can have on new orders
growth. Applying the sharpest month-on-month
rise registered since the outbreak of the financial
crisis (bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers) to the
estimated coefficients suggests that new orders
growth would contract by around 1 pp. in the euro
area and Germany, and 2 to 2½ pps. in Italy and
France (see Table 1 – second row).

Depending on data availability the sample period
starts between 1997m7/2000m3, and ends in 2013m9.
In the case of France, the sample period ends in
2012m12 when France discontinued the collection of
data on new orders.

new orders growth, lags of EPUI are included into
the baseline model. In all countries examined, the
effects
of
uncertainty
are
exclusively
contemporaneous. When re-conducting the analysis
for the pre-crisis period prior to 2008 and
afterwards, the results do not significantly change.
Taken together this suggests that (i) uncertainty has
a very fast effect on new orders and (ii) there is no
evidence that the speed of the effect has changed
during the crisis.

30

Vanishing uncertainty could drive up orders

Considering the magnitude of the uncertainty
effects described above and the (still high) current
level of the EPUI, new orders growth could
substantially increase, once uncertainty eases from
its current to the average pre-crisis level. Applying
the coefficients of Table 1, new orders growth in
the EA and Germany could gain around ½ pp.
m-o-m (i.e. some 6 pps. over the year), while Italy
and France would potentially see order growth
increasing by 1 – 1½ pps. m-o-m (i.e. 12–18 pps.
over the year). These findings underline the
potential benefits of further policy action to reduce
uncertainty.

EA and EU outlook

Box I.2: Post-crisis total factor productivity trends in the EU
Introduction

This box looks at the impact the crisis is likely to
have on the longer-term total factor productivity
trends in the EU. Increasing total factor
productivity, i.e. the increase of GDP that is not
explained by the expansion of either labour or
capital inputs, is the key driver of long-run changes
in living standards. (1) Consequently, the likely
impact of the crisis on its current and future
development is the subject of close scrutiny by the
economics profession. Unfortunately, however,
theory does not give a clear answer as to what the
expected impact of the crisis on long-run TFP
might be. (2) Besides a number of mechanisms that
tend to dampen TFP in the aftermath of a crisis
(including pro-cyclical R&D spending and rising
risk aversion resulting in more expensive bank
lending, drying capital markets and higher risk
premiums for venture capital financing), there are
also arguments that downturns can have a positive
TFP impact as they can induce a process of
essential restructuring and cleansing in the
economy.
Consequently, ex ante, the expected effect of the
crisis on TFP is ambiguous, with a range of specific
factors making any definitive assessment of the
fallout from the current crisis particularly
uncertain. These factors include the need to allow,

on the one hand, for the expected "one-off"
downward shifts in the level of TFP associated with
industrial restructuring, with some crisis-related
industries (e.g. financial services and construction)
likely to experience permanent reductions in the
level of their activities as a result of the crisis and,
on the other hand, potential upwards shifts due to
freeing scarce resources having been locked into
relatively unproductive activities; the difficulty in
estimating realistic capital obsolescence rates; the
uncertainties regarding the financial crisis impact
on R&D spending and on the financing of R&D;
and finally the possibility of a crisis-induced shift
away from the relatively-high-TFP growth
manufacturing sector towards services. In summary
therefore the impact of the crisis on TFP is largely
an empirical question, with the extent to which
individual EU countries are affected by the
different factors listed earlier dictating their relative
TFP performance in the post-crisis period.
Overview for the EU as a whole

Graph 1 shows the latest winter 2014 forecasts for
trend TFP growth in the EU28 and the euro area, as
well as the evolution of the labour, capital and TFP
components of potential growth since 2000 in the
euro area (the patterns are similar for EU28). Graph
1 illustrates that the TFP results support the a priori
assumption that the final impact of the crisis is
dependent on a range of offsetting positive and
negative factors, with this balancing act appearing
to produce a slightly negative overall impact from
the crisis so far (i.e. over the period 2008-13).
However, it is still too early to establish whether
this small decline in the EU's underlying TFP
growth rate is genuinely linked to the crisis itself
(due to some combination of factors discussed

above) or whether it simply reflects a continuation
of the well-established downward pre-crisis trend
(part of which reflects developments in both the
knowledge drivers of TFP and in the skills
composition of the EU's labour force).
Whilst a definitive understanding of post-crisis TFP
trends is still elusive, what is not in doubt however
is that the halving in potential growth rates
following the crisis has much more to do with the
sharp deterioration in the contributions from capital
and labour than from any negative drag from TFP.

than in the pre-crisis period. The small slowdown
in trend TFP growth rates across the EU has
necessarily had an impact on the level of TFP.
However, the level of trend TFP has been
substantially less affected than the level of actual
TFP since, by definition, it has been corrected for
the effects of the cycle. Indeed, as shown in
Graph 2, the level of actual TFP in the EU28 fell by
a total of 1.1% during the crisis (i.e. over the period
2008-13) whereas the level of trend TFP is
estimated to have increased by 2.2% over the same
time period.

In addition, the short run forecasts for 2014 and
2015 suggest trend TFP growth rates will remain
relatively stable and close to their pre-crisis rates,
whereas the sluggish recovery in both investment
and labour market trends from the impact of the
crisis will ensure that their contributions to overall
potential growth will remain substantially lower

This gap between the actual TFP level and its trend
level, the so called TFP gap (see Graph 2), captures
that part of the TFP slowdown which is of a purely
cyclical nature. According to the theory behind the
TFP trend estimation methodology applied in DG
ECFIN, the cyclical part of TFP should be closely
linked to capacity utilisation (CU) fluctuations in

the same period. (3) Hence, one test of the
effectiveness of the methodology is to check how
much of the observed widening of the gap is
explained by the reduction in capacity utilisation
during the crisis. It can be calculated that capacity
utilisation explains about 81% of the observed
increase in the TFP gap in the EU28 (and above
95% in the EA17). (4) The very strong link between
the capacity utilisation indicator used in the
estimation and the TFP gap is illustrated in
Graph 3. Clearly, the cyclical movements in TFP
across time are very well reflected in changes in the
utilisation of productive capacity by companies.

It is yet too early (and much beyond the scope of
this box) to investigate the impact on the future
TFP performance of the identified in the
introduction various mechanisms that are at work
during the crisis. It is, nonetheless, interesting to
highlight two clear data regularities that seem to
have emerged during the crisis in the EU15

Raciborski, W. Röger and A. Rossi (2010), "The
production function methodology for calculating
potential growth rates and output gaps", ECFIN
Economic Papers, No. 420.
According to the methodology used for extracting
trend TFP for each country it must hold that
tfp-tfp_trend=tfp_gap=(1/beta)×capacity_utilization+error where the estimated coefficient beta
measures the country-specific strength of the link
between the capacity utilisation and TFP gap. From
the above identity it follows that for the method to
explain the data well it is required that the ratio of
(1/beta)×capacity_utilisation and the growth rate of
the TFP gap to be close to 100%, which would be
consistent with a small estimation error. The EUwide ratios are found by using a weighted average of
national betas.
Unfortunately, due to their extreme heterogeneity, a
scatter plot analysis similar to that carried out for the
EU15 Member States was not possible for the new
Member States.

Two facts are worth emphasizing. First,
compared with the period before the crisis,
the share of employed in the tradable sector
in total employed has dropped in all
considered countries, which indicates closing
up of the EU economies during the crisis.
Second, countries in which this share has
fallen relatively less are also characterized by
relatively more benign dynamics of trend
TFP (the trend line on the graph has a slope
of 0.75 which is significant on the 5%
confidence level; the R² coefficient is 0.33).

Tradable goods are goods produced in Agriculture,
Forestry and Fishing (ISIC A-B), Industry (ISIC C-E)
and Trade, Transport and Communication (ISIC G-I).
Greece was found to be a clear outlier and was

This is in line with the economic intuition

Graph 5 illustrates a close relationship
between TFP trend growth rate differentials
and total hours worked. (7) A highly
significant negative slope and a very high
coefficient R2=0.56 suggest that TFP slowed
down less during the crisis in those Member
States in which hours worked fell more. In so
far as hours worked losses are in a significant
part due to firms' default, this finding is in
line with the prediction that these are the less
efficient firms that are more likely to default
during the crisis and that the cleansing
process contributes to a more benign
dynamics of TFP trend during a crisis. A
complementary explanation, based on the
'discipline device role of unemployment'
hypothesis (e.g. Riggi, 2012) (8), would posit
that employees tend to increase their effort at
work when the risk of becoming unemployed
increases.

Calculated as the average of log total hours worked in
2008-13 minus the average log total hours worked in
2003-07.
Riggi, M. (2012), "Capital Destruction, Jobless
Recoveries, and the Discipline Device Role of
Unemployment", Bank of Italy Temi di Discussione
(Working Paper) No. 871.

This box shows that at the EU level, the effect of
the crisis on TFP has, so far, been relatively muted,
with negative and positive effects broadly
balancing each other out. This generally stable
performance at the EU level is not necessarily
replicated at the individual Member State level,
with some countries seeing positive shifts in their
TFP trends over the crisis period, whereas others
have experienced significant setbacks. Among the
28 Member States, there are only three countries
(Denmark, Spain and Portugal) which have
managed to have a TFP growth rate over the period
2008-13 which was higher than in the pre-crisis
period but only Spain and Portugal are forecast to
sustain this good performance in 2014 and 2015.
As the analysis on sectoral employment shares and
on hours worked in the EU15 Member States has
highlighted, those countries which have managed
to shift resources out of relatively low productivity
sectors towards the tradables sector, whilst at the
same time improving overall labour efficiency,
appear to be emerging from the crisis in a much
healthier economic condition. The "cleansing"
benefits of the crisis are particularly in evidence in
Spain and Portugal, with their ongoing, positive,
TFP performances reflecting the fact that they have
wisely used the crisis to carry out essential
economic restructuring.

EA and EU outlook

Box I.3: The cyclical component of current-account balances
This box shows data on the cyclically-adjusted
current-account balances in the EU Member States.
These data are particularly useful to the discussion
of the nature of the adjustment in the vulnerable
euro-area countries (Ireland, Greece, Spain,
Cyprus, Portugal and Slovenia). For these
countries, a key policy question is whether the
current-account adjustment over the latest number
of years has been cyclical (i.e. transitory) or noncyclical (i.e. more permanent). If most of the
reduction in the current-account deficits were
cyclical, then one would expect the large deficits to
reappear as soon as their economies recover and
output gaps close. The available estimates suggest
that most of the adjustment in the euro-area
periphery has been non-cyclical. Therefore, one
should not expect the current-account deficits in
these countries to deteriorate over the foreseeable
future to levels any close to those observed before
the crisis. (1)

exports reflect (inter alia) cyclical effects in
domestic output and foreign demand.

The cycle, output, and demand

The business cycle consists of temporary
movements in output and demand. The difference
between output and domestic demand constitutes
the trade balance, which in turn is the most
important part of the current account. In that sense,
the cyclical component of the trade balance directly
follows from the cyclical components of changes in
output and domestic demand. However, the trade
balance is not only affected by the cyclical changes
in domestic aggregates, but also by the cyclical
movements in foreign demand and output. (2) In this
manner, imports reflect the cyclical component of
domestic demand and foreign output. In contrast,
(1)

For a similar assessment see Guillemette, Y. and D.
Turner (2013), 'Policy Options to Durably Resolve
Euro Area Imbalances,' OECD Economics
Department Working Paper, 1035; Mersch, Y. (2013)
'The Overhaul of the Architecture of the Euro Area
and the Return of Investor Confidence,' speech at the
CFA Institute, London, and ECB Monthly Bulletin
(Jan. 2014: 47-50). For a somehow different
perspective, see IMF World Economic Outlook (Oct.
2013: 45-8, and Ollivaud, P. and C. Schwellnus
(2013), 'The Post-crisis Narrowing of International
Imbalances–Cyclical or Durable?' OECD Economics
Department Working Paper, 1062.
The current account also adjusts in response to other
factors (such as interest rates or the terms of trade)
that also reflect the cycle. But usually, the cyclical
component of the current account is estimated given
the response of real aggregates (supply and demand).

Table 1 displays the non-adjusted and the
cyclically-adjusted current-account balances, (3)
which would prevail if both the country in question
and its trading partners closed their output gaps.
Accounting for the cyclical component leads to a
higher surplus or smaller deficit in 2013 in the
economies whose output gap exceeds that of their
trading partners, taking into account their external
openness. For 2013, this is the case of Bulgaria,
Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania,
Luxembourg, Malta and a few others. For the
countries for which their output gap is inferior to
the output gap of their trading partners, the closing
of domestic and foreign output gaps would lead to
smaller surpluses or larger deficits; this is notably
the case of the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece,
Spain, Cyprus, Hungary, Netherlands, Portugal,
Slovakia and a few others.
(3)

These are estimates based on the methodology
described in Salto, M. and A. Turrini (2010),
'Comparing Alternative Methodologies for Real
Exchange Rate Assessment,' European EconomyEconomic Papers, 427. The assessment is based on
the Commission estimates for output gaps (see Table
14 of the statistical annex): output gaps for trading
partners not available in AMECO are from the
OECD. Estimates on the basis of IMF data and
methodology (Phillips, S. et al. (2013), 'The External
Balance Assessment (EBA) Methodology,' IMF
Working Paper, 13/272) point to similar figures.

Adjustment in vulnerable countries

In 2007-13, there has been a substantial adjustment
in the euro-area vulnerable Member States. (4) On
average, the current-account balances of Ireland,
Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovenia
improved by more than 9 pps., and Spain, Ireland,
Portugal and Slovenia now run surpluses. This
adjustment is forecast to continue through 2015
(see Table 50 of the statistical annex), though with
differences among these countries.
To discuss whether the adjustment of currentaccount deficits in the euro-area periphery has been
cyclical or not raises two key questions: (1) Has the
adjustment been rather due to a decline in domestic
demand (and, by implication, imports) – or to
changes in foreign demand (and thus exports and
output)? (2) To what extent have these changes in
domestic demand, output, and foreign demand been
cyclical? The data show that most of the
rebalancing in the vulnerable economies has been
due to a contraction in their domestic demand (and
thus imports). But much of this contraction has
been non-cyclical, which may seem counterintuitive at first sight.
The rebalancing of trade (and thus current-account)
balances in the vulnerable countries is reflected in
domestic demand declining faster than output
(Graph 1 illustrates this for Spain.) Contracting
private investment, particularly construction, was
the main driver of this decline; private consumption
has generally declined more than GDP and
contributed to raising saving rates. (5) The countercyclical increases in fiscal deficits initially slowed
the narrowing of current-account deficits in a
number of vulnerable countries, but fiscal
consolidation has contributed to improving their
current-account balances since 2009-10.
In several vulnerable euro-area countries,
rebalancing and output also benefited from robust
(4)

(5)

Here, the reference year is 2007 is used since it was
the last year of the pre-crisis boom in global trade. In
contrast, 2008 figures are partly affected by the trade
slump in response to the crisis.
This behaviour runs counter the textbook response to
a negative cyclical shock: consumption smoothing
would entail a widening, rather than a narrowing, of
the current-account deficit. Instead, the behaviour is
consistent with a structural break in potential GDP
(see for a discussion Aguiar, M. and G. Gopinath
(2007), 'Emerging Market Business Cycles: The
Cycle Is the Trend.' Journal of Political Economy,
115(1): 69-102).

exports, despite sluggish world demand, thanks to
gains in price and cost competitiveness (changes in
relative prices) and non-cost competitiveness.
Relative price developments within and among
economies facilitate the necessary reallocation of
resources from non-tradable to tradable sectors. In
all the vulnerable countries, GDP deflators have
risen at a slower pace than export prices, which in
turn rise slower than import prices, reflecting those
relative changes in prices. (6) This pattern is likely
to be maintained for some years, with the terms of

Graph 2 shows the sizeable contribution from real
export growth to current-account adjustment in
most vulnerable countries. (7) Portugal, Spain and
Ireland outperformed average real export growth in
the euro area in 2007-13, though their real exports
grew slightly less than Germany's. In Greece and
Cyprus, real exports did decline in 2007-13 (though
less than GDP, thus leading to the positive
contribution to the changes in current account
depicted in the graph).

Margins and Prices in Rebalancing Economies,' box
I.3 in the spring 2013 forecasts.
The Graph is based on differentials with respect to
GDP growth. I.e., exports growing faster (or
declining more slowly) than GDP contribute
positively to the change in the current-account
balance (in % of GDP). Likewise, imports
contracting faster than GDP result into a positive
contribution.

Change CA/GDP 2007 to CA/GDP 2013

In contrast to exports, the vulnerable countries'
imports have differed markedly from the patterns
observed in the core euro-area countries, as well as
from their pre-crisis trends. (8) In the vulnerable
countries, real imports receded strongly in 2007-13,
which resulted in the positive contribution visible
in Graph 2. (9) A combined reading thus implies
that the slump in domestic demand and imports
dominates the adjustment in the vulnerable
economies, (10) though some of them also benefitted
from improved export performance.

Non-cyclical is not the same as good news

While much of the current-account adjustment has
been induced by domestic demand contractions, the
question is how much of this stems from cyclical
factors knowing that demand changes are typically
associated with cyclical fluctuations. This may
have led some observers to conclude that the
current adjustment has been largely cyclical.
During most business cycles, domestic demand
fluctuates more than output, thus generating

In Spain, for instance, real exports growth slowed
from cumulated +29% over 2001-07 to +14% during
2007-13 (compare with +36% and +9% in the euro
area). In contrast, the Spanish real import growth of
+55% during 2001-07 was followed by a decline
of -21% during 2007-13 (compare with +36% and
+2% in the euro area).
Note that a certain part of imported intermediate
goods and services serves just to sustain exports.
(This import content of exports varies between 22%
for Spain and 43% in Ireland.) In that sense, the
decline in imports hides an even stronger impact
coming from the contraction in domestic final
demand.

cyclical movements in current-account balances.
However, the boom years before 2007 saw not only
inflated domestic demand in the euro-area
periphery; potential output also swelled (in
particular in the construction sector) due to overly
optimistic expectations resting on abundant credit
and soaring asset prices. Arguably, the correction
of these growth expectations driven by the
reassessment of risk premia is permanent. The large
domestic demand declines during the crisis have
been mirrored in a significant slowdown of
potential output. Consequently, the output gap
measured against the estimated potential output is
much smaller than the gap against the pre-crisis
growth trend. Moreover, the output gap
developments in the vulnerable countries do not
differ much from their trading partners – but their
current-account balances do. For example, in
Ireland and Portugal output gaps dropped between
5 and 5½ pps. in 2007-13, which is as much or
even less than in economies with milder gyrations
of macroeconomic aggregates, such as France, the
Netherlands or Denmark. Hence, current-account
adjustment in most vulnerable countries appears
largely non-cyclical because it is associated mainly
with the deceleration in their potential output.
Graph 3 illustrates this for Spain where the
deviation of actual GDP from its pre-crisis trend
has been much more substantial than the decline
from the 2007 peak. Moreover, only part of the
growth gap between Spain and its partners is due to
output gap differentials. Instead, most of this
growth divergence is due to the relative changes in
potential GDP. The rebalancing thus owes a lot to
the contraction in domestic demand, which in turn
reflects a structural break in potential output. (11)
Outlook

Once domestic output reaches or exceeds potential
again, the ensuing demand will lead to a cyclical
worsening of current-account balances. This could
be particularly strong if output in these countries
recovers faster than in their main partners. For
(11)

Greece has, in this respect, been an exception. Much
more of its output decline is currently attributed to
cyclical factors: Its output gap declined from +3¼%
of GDP in 2007 to -12¾% 2013, a number that
exceeds the euro-area output gap by almost 10 pps.
As a result, much more of its adjustment is estimated
to be due to cyclical factors. This shows that
conclusions on the cyclical and non-cyclical nature of
rebalancing crucially hinge on the correctness of
output gap estimates.

instance, the output gap in Ireland already closed
vis-à-vis its partners, thus inducing a currentaccount balance that is slightly below its surplus in
cyclically-adjusted terms. However, such cyclical
worsening is unlikely to bring current-account
balances to the pre-crisis levels any time soon.

and demand prospects of the private and public
sectors in these economies. A return of large
current-account deficits is thus unlikely, as it would
further rack up external debt. Instead, the
vulnerable economies may require current-account
surpluses over the medium term to bring down
external indebtedness to sounder levels. The
required extent of such surpluses in turn depends
on the countries' growth prospects.

The boom-and-crisis has left the euro-area
periphery with a large stock of outstanding external
debt. Among the vulnerable Member States, the
current-account adjustment is only now stabilising
their negative international investment position and
external debt with respect to GDP. But the debt
stocks continue to constrain the borrowing capacity

The question is thus not whether deficits reappear,
but whether the surpluses will be sustained by
permanently compressed imports and demand, or
by expanding exports and output. This in turn will
depend on the reforms in these countries as well as
the behaviour of domestic demand in trading
partners in the euro area and beyond. In view of
deleveraging pressures on domestic demand,
exports and export-oriented investment are the
demand components with scope to underpin a
resumption of potential growth and employment in
the medium run. However, an export-led recovery
requires further reallocation of labour and capital in
the structural composition of the economy.
Structural reforms that facilitate such re-orientation
and changes in relative prices will boost potential
output and export capacity – and thus relieve the
pressure on imports to offset negative income
balances. (12)

EA and EU outlook

Box I.4: Analysing current disinflationary trends in the euro area
Annual HICP inflation in the euro area has been
trending downwards since end-2011, averaging
2.5% in 2012 and 1.4% in 2013. A gradual decline
in euro-area inflation had been widely expected
given the fall in commodity prices in recent years
and the amount of slack in the euro-area economy.
Particularly the fourth-quarter figures of 2013,
however, surprised on the downside, with annual
HICP inflation falling to 0.8%. Similar tendencies
have been observed outside the euro area, as
reflected by a broad decline in global headline
inflation since mid-2011.
This box sheds light on the driving forces behind
the current disinflation in the euro area and inquires
whether it appears to be a temporary or a more
persistent phenomenon. The analysis briefly
touches upon the fading away of temporary factors
before focusing on cyclical and structural elements.
Temporary factors are fading away…

Part of the recent drop in euro area inflation has
been due to the fading away of temporary factors,
namely the increases in indirect taxes and
administered prices (linked to fiscal consolidation
needs in many Member States) and the passthrough from past commodity-price hikes (oil and
unprocessed food in particular). In the fourth
quarter of 2013, core inflation, defined as all-item
HICP inflation excluding energy and unprocessed
food, decreased markedly to 1% (from 1.3% in the
three previous quarters). Notably, the impact of tax
hikes was smaller than during the rest of the year
(0.1 pp. compared to an average of 0.4 pp. in
2013)1, and so was the contribution of administered
prices (which in 2013 declined to its long-term
average of 0.3 pp., after being substantially above
in 2011-12). HICP inflation adjusted for tax
changes stood at 1% throughout 2013, having
dropped through 2012. (1) (see Graph 1 and
Section I.6 of the main text).
… while cyclical and structural factors related to
the ongoing price adjustment in the euro area
are at work

The abatement of temporary factors, however, is
not the only driving force behind the current
disinflation in the euro area. Cyclical and structural
factors, related to the fragile recovery and the
(1)

Constant-tax inflation rates assume a full and
immediate pass-through of tax changes to prices, and
could hence be seen as an upper bound to the actual
impact of tax changes.

ongoing relative price adjustment in the euro area,
also are at play.

Unit labour costs can explain much of the cyclical
pattern of underlying inflation as measured by the
GDP deflator (see Graph 2). Annual growth in unit
labour costs decreased further to 1.0% in the third
quarter of 2013, from 2.1% in the third quarter of
2012. Taking the typical pattern of previous
recoveries as a guide, the slow pace of "cost-push
inflation" stemming from unit labour costs can be
expected to continue over the next few quarters. In
the initial stages of a recovery, productivity
typically tends to increase, while wages pick up
only later. As productivity growth is currently still
very low, there is much room for productivity
increases. Only after some quarters, employment is
likely to become a more significant driver of
growth, thus curbing productivity growth. Together
with a rise in labour compensation (from 1.6% in
the third quarter 2013), this would push up unit
labour costs. This cyclical perspective points to
subdued price pressures in the pipeline, but also to
their temporary nature. (2)
Apart from its cyclical behaviour, the disinflation
in the more vulnerable Member States might be
influenced by structural shifts that could amplify its
magnitude. Indeed, the relative decline in inflation
rates in these countries (see Graph 3) coincides
with substantial structural reform efforts that
(2)

As prices reflect not only labour costs but also profit
margins, price pressures will also be influenced by
the outlook for the latter. Measured as the gross
operating surplus, profit margins fell in the euro area
in 2012 (-0.8%), but increased in 2013 (+0.5% in the
first two quarters). With the economic recovery
continuing to take shape, a gradually higher
contribution of corporate margins to price changes
can be expected.

explicitly targeted nominal rigidities in prices and
wages. (3)

of the Phillips curve could be the result of the
elements described above, such as enhanced wage
flexibility or its previous disguise by temporary
factors like hikes in indirect taxes. (5) The recent
steepening of the curve has however not
completely reversed the long-term flattening trend.
A simple framework based on a New Keynesian
Phillips curve with time-varying parameters of
euro-area inflation at the aggregate level offers
useful insights. (6) The estimates use quarterly data
on exchange-rate-adjusted oil prices, the output
gap, past inflation and inflation expectations based
on inflation swaps. (7)
The estimation results suggest that the output gap
plays a more important role in accounting for
inflation developments than before the crisis.
During the past two years, the inflation elasticity of
the output gap appears to have surged particularly
in vulnerable Member States, arguably due to
structural reforms. (8) The assumption that the
output gap will continue to close only slowly points
to a continuing drag of weak demand on inflation
but does not necessarily add further disinflationary
momentum.

At the same time, the current disinflation in the
euro area may be related to an increasing impact of
the output gap on inflation. Empirical evidence
suggests that the Phillips curve, which describes the
relation between the output gap and inflation, had
flattened over the last two decades. Various
measures of inflation had become less sensitive to
the slack in the economy. (4) In recent years,
however, the output gap elasticity of inflation
appears to have increased again. This could
possibly mirror non-linearity, i.e. inflation might
only react significantly to the output gap if it is
large and persistent. Alternatively, the steepening
(3)

(4)

It seems, however, too early to draw clear
conclusions about the precise impact of these
structural reforms on price and wage dynamics.
See IMF (2013), "The dog that didn't bark: Has
inflation been muzzled or was it just sleeping", IMF
World Economic Outlook, Chapter 3, April, and
Acedo-Montoya, L., B. Doehring (2011), "The
improbable renaissance of the Phillips curve: The
crisis and euro area inflation dynamics", European
Commission Economic Papers, No 446, October.

The Phillips-curve estimates also suggest a
gradually increasing role of inflation expectations
in explaining price developments. Market-based
euro-area inflation expectations (see Graph 4)
derived from swap rates have been trending
downwards at all maturities since spring 2011.
Taken at face value, the spot rates of inflationlinked swaps observed in January 2014 imply an
average annual inflation rate of 1.1% over 2014-16.
Regarding the medium-term outlook, inflation
expectations derived from inflation-linked swap
rates at the three-years-forward-three-years-ahead
horizon imply an average inflation rate of 1.7% in
2017-19. At the same time, five-year inflationlinked swap rates five years ahead, the most widely

estimated by using state-space methods that apply the

The output gap is based on the European
Commission's production function approach.
While tax increases in vulnerable Member States may

used measure of long-term inflation expectations,
have been broadly stable at slightly above 2% (all
January 2014 averages).

Market-based indicators hence suggest that, in the
short- to medium-term, markets expect inflation in
the euro area to remain well below 2% and to only
slowly return to that level over time. At the same
time, long-term inflation expectations remain wellanchored on the back of high central bank
credibility. Yet, as the Japanese experience with a
long-lasting period of mostly mild deflation since
the mid-1990s shows, long-term inflation
expectations do not necessarily provide full
assurance on future inflation developments. Most
available measures suggest that long-term inflation
expectations in Japan (six to ten years ahead)
declined only gradually in the early 1990s and
remained positive throughout the last two decades,
despite a prolonged period of negative or very low
inflation. In contrast to the euro area, however,
long-term inflation expectations did not appear
well-anchored in Japan, reflecting inter alia the
absence of a quantitative inflation target at the
time.

Deflation risks low

On the basis of the above considerations, the
baseline scenario is one of a protracted period of
low inflation in the quarters ahead. Only a muted
increase in inflation is expected within the forecast
horizon, in line with the ongoing recovery.
For a scenario of outright euro-area-wide deflation,
i.e. the emergence of a broad-based and selfsustaining downward trend in the price level, to
materialise, a strong shock to the forecast
assumptions would be required, driving underlying
inflation in the euro-area core to unprecedented
near-zero levels. At the same time, in the context of
continuing disinflationary pressures in many
Member States and the current downward trend in
commodity prices, the sensitivity of the inflation
outlook to shocks appears to have increased. Low
core inflation and sizeable output gaps, as well as a
reduction in nominal rigidities in some Member
States, may well have reduced some of the
downward stickiness that inflation in the euro area
experienced at low levels in the past.
Even in the absence of outright deflation, an
inflation rate persistently below the ECB's
definition of price stability over the medium term,
defined as "a year-on-year increase in the HICP for
the euro area of below, but close to, 2%", would
not be without risks for the Member States at the
lower range of the inflation dispersion. A
protracted period of very low inflation increases the
real value of both public and private debt and
results in higher real interest rates, making the
ongoing internal adjustment in a number of
Member States more difficult and the deleveraging
process more challenging. (9)

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2014

Box I.5: Some technical elements behind the forecast
The cut-off date for taking new information into
account in this European Economic Forecast was
17 February. The forecast incorporates validated
public finance data as published in Eurostat's News
Release 152/2013 of 21 October 2013.
External assumptions

This forecast is based on a set of external
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions
from possible volatility during any given trading
day, averages from a 10-day reference period
(between 31 January and 13 February) were used
for exchange and interest rates, and for oil prices.
Exchange and interest rates

The technical assumption as regards exchange rates
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption
leads to an implied average USD/EUR rate of 1.36
in 2014 and 2015. The average JPY/EUR rates are
138.58 in 2014 and 138.31 in 2015.
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based.
Short-term interest rates for the euro area are
derived from futures contracts. Long-term interest
rates for the euro area, as well as short- and
long-term interest rates for other M ember States are
calculated using implicit forward swap rates,
corrected for the current spread between the
interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no
market instrument is available, the fixed spread
vis-à-vis the euro-area interest rate is taken for both
short- and long-term rates. As a result, short-term
interest rates are assumed to be 0.3% on average in
2014 and 0.4% in 2015 in the euro area. Long-term
euro-area interest rates are assumed to be 1.8% on
average in 2014 and 2.1% in 2015.
Commodity prices

Commodity price assumptions are also, as far as
possible, based on market conditions. According to
futures markets, prices for Brent oil are projected to
be on average 104.1 USD/bbl in 2014 and
99.6 USD/bbl in 2015. This would correspond to an
oil price of 76.5 EUR/bbl in 2014 and
73.2 EUR/bbl in 2015.
Budgetary data

Data up to 2012 are based on data notified by
M ember States to the European Commission on

1 October and validated by Eurostat on 21 October
2013.
Eurostat has expressed its reservation on the quality
of the data reported by Austria, due to uncertainties
on the statistical impact of the conclusions of the
Federal Audit Office's report on the Land Salzburg,
published on 9 October 2013. The report revealed
deficiencies with regard to financial management
and to completeness of the public accounts of the
Land Salzburg. The statistical implications of the
audit for EDP data are being investigated by
Statistics Austria in collaboration with Eurostat, in
order to clarify the precise impacts on 2012 and
also on preceding years. It is possible that this will
lead to an upward revision of government debt of
up to half a percent of GDP, with more minor
revisions to the government deficit, based on the
information available at the time of the validation.
For the forecast, measures in support of financial
stability have been recorded in line with the
Eurostat Decision of 15 July 2009. (1) Unless
reported otherwise by the M ember State concerned,
capital injections known in sufficient detail have
been included in the forecast as financial
transactions, i.e. increasing the debt, but not the
deficit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and
deposits are not included as government
expenditure, unless there is evidence that they have
been called on at the time the forecast was
finalised. Note, however, that loans granted to
banks by the government, or by other entities
classified in the government sector, usually add to
government debt.
For 2014, budgets adopted or presented to national
parliaments and all other measures known in
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. In
particular, all the information included in the Draft
Budgetary Plans submitted by 15 October is
reflected in this forecast. For 2015, the 'no-policychange' assumption used in the forecasts implies
the extrapolation of revenue and expenditure trends
and the inclusion of measures that are known in
sufficient detail.
The general government balances that are relevant
for the Excessive Deficit Procedure may be slightly
different from those published in the national
accounts. The difference concerns settlements
under swaps and forward rate agreements (FRA).

Box (continued)

According to ESA95 (amended by regulation No.
2558/2001), swap- and FRA-related flows are
financial transactions and therefore excluded from
the calculation of the government balance.
However, for the purposes of the excessive deficit
procedure, such flows are recorded as net interest
expenditure. European aggregates for general
government debt in the forecast years 2013-15 are
published on a non-consolidated basis (i.e. not
corrected for intergovernmental loans). To ensure
consistency in the time series, historical data are
also published on the same basis. For 2012, this
implies a debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro area which
is 2.1 pp. (1.5 pp. in the EU) higher than the
consolidated general government debt ratio
published by Eurostat in its news release 152/2013
of 21 October 2013. General government debt
projections for individual M ember States in
2013-15 include the impact of guarantees to the
EFSF, (2) bilateral loans to other M ember States,
(2)

and the participation in the capital of the ESM as
planned on the cut-off date of the forecast (subject
to approval).
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output
gaps

The number of working days may differ from one
year to another. The Commission's annual GDP
forecasts are not adjusted for the number of
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.
However, the working-day effect in the EU and the
euro area is estimated to be limited over the
forecast horizon, implying that adjusted and
unadjusted growth rates differ only marginally (by
up to ±0.1 pp.). The calculation of potential growth
and the output gap does not adjust for working
days. Since the working-day effect is considered as
temporary, it should not affect the cyclically adjusted balances.

Prospects by individual economy

Member States

1. BELGIUM
Growth expectations up, inflation down
Rising net exports and household consumption helped the Belgian economy to end 2013 on a positive
note. GDP rose by 0.4% in the final quarter, bringing the annual rate to 0.2% and ending two years of
stagnation. GDP growth is expected to reach 1.4% in 2014 before rising to 1.7% in 2015. Despite an
improving economy, government deficit levels are expected to remain broadly unchanged.
With the noteworthy exception of the construction
sector, confidence indices have been improving in
recent quarters and have reached the highest level
since the summer of 2011. This soft indicator trend
has been confirmed by recent hard data and points
to a continuation of the positive performance in
upcoming quarters.
More robust than anticipated private consumption
in the second half of 2013 provides 2014 with
substantial carry-over. Household spending is
expected to accelerate further towards the end of
the year, in parallel with labour market prospects.
More solid income growth is forecast to underpin
consumer spending in 2015.

After falling by 2.5% in 2013 due to a weak start,
capital formation is expected to continue its recent
recovery, led by company investments. Industrial
production has been pointing to a modest
turnaround, while the industry's capacity utilisation
is close to the long-term average. Inversely,
construction is still sluggish at best, with
confidence at the lowest level in over 15 years and
both order books and expected employment weak.
A real pick-up in activity is only expected for
2015. This reflects depressed housing investments
as well as a cyclical correction in public
investment following the 2012 local elections.
Net exports are expected to have contributed
0.7 pp. to overall growth in 2013. This year, export
growth is projected to outpace import growth,

The pace of the recovery in Belgium remains
closely linked to developments in the euro area.
The main domestic downside risk would be tighter
credit conditions resulting in more subdued
investment growth.
Unhurried labour market turnaround, inflation
set to remain moderate over forecast horizon

Despite an apparent stabilisation towards the end
of last year, unemployment is set to rise further
from an average of 8.4% in 2013 to 8.5% in 2014
as job creation is projected to feature a
considerable lag to the economic cycle after a
prolonged period of sluggish activity. Somewhat
stronger employment growth is projected to push
back unemployment to 8.2% in 2015, a level still
high from an historic perspective.

helped by modest gains in competitiveness. With
domestic demand strengthening over the forecast
horizon, import growth is forecast to accelerate as
well. As a consequence, net trade would become a
negative contributor in 2015.

Meanwhile, price pressures have been retreating
and a further decrease is expected in upcoming
quarters. This reflects the generally low
inflationary environment as well as specific
Belgian elements, in particular the lowering of the
VAT rate on electricity consumption by
households as of April next. With low price
pressures delaying wage indexation for most
workers and real wages frozen, nominal wage
growth is set to be confined. In combination with a
pick-up in productivity this leads to unit labour
costs growing much slower than has been the case
in recent years.
Broadly flat public finance outlook

The general government deficit is estimated to
have reached 2.7% of GDP in 2013, 0.1 pp. lower
than expected in the autumn forecast. The
improvement stems from higher than expected
economic growth in the last quarter, as well as
from positive revenue surprises from a fiscal

Member States, Belgium

amnesty and from taxation of financial assets. The
structural balance is expected to have improved by
around ¾% of GDP in 2013, while one-off factors
(such as the fiscal amnesty and the sale of telecom
licences) amount to around ½% of GDP.

of GDP. Since the autumn forecast, the
government also agreed on a reduction of social
security charges of 0.1% of GDP in 2015. Overall,
the deficit is expected to remain broadly stable in
2015 under the usual
no-policy-change
assumption, despite the projected strengthening of
economic growth.

In 2014, the deficit is expected to decline slightly
further to 2.6% of GDP. Expenditure growth is
modest due to the low inflation environment as
well as measures taken in health care and
reductions in administrative spending. Tax
revenues are boosted by the improving economic
environment and by consolidation measures in the
2014 budget such as the introduction of VAT on
services from lawyers, an increase in excise duties
and a minimum corporate income tax. The fiscal
amnesty is expected to yield additional one-off
revenues in 2014, although lower than in 2013. On
the other hand, a reduction in the VAT rate on
electricity will weigh on indirect tax revenues. In
2014, the overall deficit impact of this measure is
broadly neutral due to its inflation-reducing
impact, which will postpone the automatic
indexation of public wages and social benefits
until the beginning of 2015. In that year, the net
budgetary cost of the measure will be above 0.1%

The structural improvement of the budget balance
is projected at around ¼% of GDP in 2014, to then
deteriorate again by ½% of GDP in 2015 due to
the impact of the above-mentioned government
measures and the autonomously rising trend in
social expenditure.
General government debt is estimated to have
reached 99.8% of GDP in 2013. The positive
impact of the reimbursement of a loan by KBC
(0.5% of GDP) and the sale of government assets
(1.3% of GDP) is partly offset by negative stockflow adjustments, such as the contribution to the
EFSF/ESM (0.7% of GDP). The debt ratio is
forecast to rise again in 2014, to just above 100%
of GDP, mostly due to stock-flow adjustments
(EFSF/ESM), and to start declining in 2015.

2. BULGARIA
Economic growth resuming, but labour market still weak
The economic recovery in Bulgaria is expected to broaden in 2014 and 2015 as domestic demand
gradually joins exports as the main engine of growth. But with growth expected to be modest, the labour
market will likely remain weak. After a fiscal stimulus in 2013, fiscal policy is forecast to turn broadly
neutral this year and next.
Growth broadens

Exports to remain buoyant

Preliminary GDP data for 2013 indicates a slight
pick-up in growth in the second half of the year.
Growth was driven by net exports and a surge in
public
expenditure,
whereas
household
consumption contracted. Annual growth is
projected to have reached 0.6% in 2013. This
remains well below the estimated potential growth
rate of the economy.

Exports are forecast to remain relatively strong
also over 2014-15, upheld by an economic
recovery in the EU. Nevertheless, the rebound in
domestic consumption and investment would also
drive up imports and turn the growth contribution
from net exports slightly negative. The current
account surplus is forecast to have reached about
2% of GDP in 2013, but is projected to diminish to
close-to-balance by 2015.

Going forward, the economic recovery is expected
to be more broad-based, with domestic demand
forecast to reinforce the export-driven growth
momentum. GDP growth is forecast to reach 1.7%
in 2014 and 2% in 2015. The recovery is expected
to be slow compared to many other converging
economies, as a significant population decline (due
to ageing and emigration) continues to erode the
growth potential.
Domestic demand poised for a rebound

Even though the purchasing power of households
has been buoyed by growth in wages in a low
inflation environment and by a discretionary
pensions hike of over 9% in April 2013,
households have so far remained cautious in
spending. However, consumer confidence appears
to be gradually firming, as indicated by recent
surveys. Also, retail trade recorded strong growth
over the second half of 2013, which suggests an
imminent recovery in household consumption.
Household consumption is therefore forecast to
rebound over 2014-15.

Risks are broadly balanced

Risks to this macroeconomic forecast seem
broadly balanced. The most significant downside
risk is related to the expected recovery in
household consumption, which could prove
weaker than expected given that the Bulgarian
labour market and household sentiment are still
fragile. However, as observed over the recent
years, in periods of weaker domestic demand the
Bulgarian economy has been able to partly
compensate this with higher net exports.

The recovery in private investment is forecast to be
gradual given that the rebound in economic
activity is expected to be modest. However,
investment is supported by the relatively strong
financial sector, which has been capable of
upholding credit to the private sector over the
crisis years. Also, both deposit and lending interest
rates have continued on a downward trend,
implying an improvement in lending conditions
and credit availability.

The labour market remains in distress

After four consecutive years of falling
employment, labour market statistics indicate first
signs of stabilisation since the second half of 2013.
This is mainly thanks to the traditionally volatile
agricultural sector, which benefited from a good

Member States, Bulgaria

harvest in 2013. While employment in service
sectors appears also stabilising, manufacturing and
construction sectors continue to shed labour.
Going forward, the labour market is projected to
improve only gradually since notable labour
market mismatches have built up over the
extended crisis years. Unemployment is expected
to have peaked at almost 13% of the labour force
in 2013 and decline slowly to about 12% by 2015.

the projected recovery in domestic demand and the
ongoing convergence of prices towards the EU
average.
Fiscal expansion in 2013, turning broadly
neutral thereafter

Following three years of consolidation, the general
government deficit is estimated to have increased
from 0.8% of GDP in 2012 to 1.9% of GDP in
2013. This was due to a combination of a soft
patch in economic recovery and additional
spending for social expenditure (including the
increase in pensions) and various current
expenditure items. The general government deficit
is set to remain unchanged at 1.9% of GDP in
2014 and slightly decline to 1.7% in 2015. In
structural terms, the deficit is estimated to
deteriorate by 1 pp. of GDP in 2013, but remain
broadly stable in 2014 and 2015. This reflects the
expansionary fiscal stance in 2013, and a broadly
neutral one in 2014-15. The general government
gross debt is forecast to increase from 18.5% in
2012 to about 24% of GDP in 2015.

Sharply decelerating inflation in 2013

Average inflation amounted to only 0.4% in 2013.
Inflation fell sharply over 2013, turning even
negative in the second half of the year, driven by
falling import prices, decreases in the
administratively-set energy prices and the good
harvest that led to lower food prices. As the base
effects from these factors fade, inflation is forecast
to rebound in the second half of 2014.
Nevertheless, inflationary pressures are expected
to remain low also in 2014, with average annual
inflation projected to reach 0.5%. Inflation is
forecast to accelerate in 2015 to 1.8%, in line with

3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC
Economic activity to strengthen in 2014
The economic recovery that started in the second quarter of 2013 is expected to strengthen in 2014,
sustained by the improving global economy. The labour market is set to improve while the general
government deficit is forecast to worsen slightly, mainly because of higher government consumption
expenditure and a planned labour tax reform in 2015.
The recovery is firming up...

In the third quarter of 2013, real GDP expanded at
a modest pace of 0.2%, confirming the recovery
that had started in the second quarter. A significant
weakening of the koruna in November 2013 is
expected to have propped up domestic demand
growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 as in
particular investment purchases were advanced in
response to expectations of increased prices.
According to the flash release of 14 February by
the Czech Statistical Office, real GDP grew by
1.6% in the fourth quarter. Economic activity,
supported by a brightening outlook for the global
economy, is expected to continue improving in the
following quarters.

Exports to drive growth in 2014...

While signs confirming the inversion in the cycle
have already been discernible in high-frequency
indicators for a few months, value added growth in
manufacturing and other industry still remains
subdued. Looking ahead, industrial production is
forecast to pick up in 2014, benefitting from
further improvement in confidence, a sustained
inflow of new orders and restored profit margins.
On the back of the weakened koruna and a gradual
acceleration in economic growth of its main EU
trading partners, export-oriented sectors are
expected to be the main drivers of growth in 2014.

52

Lingering effects from the crisis are likely to
persist in construction, but declining unit labour
cost in this sector is expected to buttress its
recovery.
...while domestic demand is set to strengthen
appreciably in 2015

Household consumption is firming but it is
expected to grow somewhat less dynamically than
envisaged in the autumn in view of still weak
growth in real disposable income. Stabilisation of
labour market conditions in 2014 and moderate
improvement over the forecast horizon will be a
supportive factor, but the projected fall in the
population of working age is set to become a
permanent drag on employment growth. In a
context of spare production capacities and limited
credit growth, which only very recently started
picking up, the contribution of gross fixed capital
formation to GDP growth is expected to remain
subdued in 2014.
Looking further ahead, growth is expected to
rebalance towards domestic drivers in 2015, along
with strengthening confidence in both the
corporate and household sectors. The associated
rise in imports is projected to decrease the
contribution of net exports to growth and to slow
the ongoing improvement in the current-account
balance.
Inflation

The Czech National Bank loosened further its
monetary policy in November by weakening the
koruna and has signalled its intention to maintain a
supportive policy stance at least throughout 2014.
The latest inflation figures show that the passthrough from the exchange rate to prices is fairly
quick, with inflation as measured by the HICP
rising from 0.9% in October to 1.4% in December
2013. However, the fading out of past increases in
indirect taxes together with a drop in regulated
prices of electricity are set to dampen price growth
throughout 2014. Stronger domestic demand is
expected to stoke up inflation in 2015.

Member States, The Czech Republic

General government deficit to worsen slightly

The general government deficit is expected to have
reached 2.7% of GDP in 2013. This outcome
results
from consolidation
measures
of
approximately 0.7% of GDP and a projected yearon-year decline in public investment by more than
9%. Public investment has been on a steep
declining path for four consecutive years and its
share on GDP declined to 2.9% in 2013 compared
with a long-term average of 4.2%. . The available
cash data indicate lower-than-expected revenues
from corporate income taxes and excise duties but
strong VAT revenues.
The general government deficit will stabilise at
2.8% of GDP in 2014. Growth in government
consumption is set to remain strong on account of
the planned increase in the public sector wage bill
and in the intermediate consumption (total fiscal
impact of approximately 0.2% of GDP). The
forecast also factors in a moderate rebound in

public investment and the planned withdrawal of
earlier consolidation measures (0.2% of GDP). The
main deficit-reducing measures include lower
indexation of pensions, an increase in excise duties
and one-off revenue from the sale of newly
released frequency ranges (total fiscal impact of
approximately 0.5% of GDP). The structural
balance is forecast to deteriorate in the context of a
narrowing output gap.
On unchanged policies, the deficit is expected to
widen to 3.3% of GDP and the structural balance is
forecast to deteriorate further. The already adopted
reform of the personal income tax entering in force
in 2015 will be the main deficit-increasing
measure (0.4% of GDP).
The debt-to-GDP ratio stabilised at around 46% in
2013 due to the sale of financial assets amounting
to approximately 3% of GDP. The ratio is
expected to increase over the forecast horizon,
reaching 48.6% in 2015.

4. DENMARK
Moving out of stagnation
After three years of economic standstill, the indicators are pointing to an improvement in the Danish
economy. GDP-growth has been positive in the two latest quarters, unemployment has edged
downwards and confidence indicators have improved across consumers and different business sectors.
But despite these clear signs of improvement, it is still too early to conclude that the recovery has
gained a firm footing.
Economic recovery is gaining traction

Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 0.3% in
2013. The weak growth rate is primarily due to the
negative carry-over effects from 2012 and a weak
development at the beginning of the year. In the
course of the year, GDP growth has picked up,
with two consecutive quarters of growth in the
second and third quarter of 2013. Growth is
estimated to have been primarily driven by
domestic demand, while strong imports have led to
a negative growth contribution from net exports.
At the beginning of 2014, confidence indicators
are pointing to increased momentum in the Danish
economy, (II.4.1). Real GDP is forecast to grow by
1.7% in 2014 and 1.8% in 2015, which is
unchanged compared to the projection in the
autumn forecast. In 2014 and 2015, domestic
demand is expected to remain the main growth
driver. Export growth is expected to pick-up
markedly in 2014 and 2015, but a simultaneous
increase in imports reduces the positive growth
contributions from net exports.
Private consumption has been stable at a low level
since 2010, as income growth has been low,
uncertainty widespread, and Danish households
have been consolidating after the housing bubble
burst. However, consumer confidence has
improved significantly since last summer, house
prices have stabilised and even increased in the
largest cities, interest rates are low and there have
been early signs of improvement in the labour
market. Hence, there is a potential for increased
private consumption, which is forecast to expand
by 1.4-1.7% on an annual basis in the forecast
period.
Exports are expected to have grown by just 0.9%
in 2013, after even weaker growth in 2012. The
low growth rate for 2013 is partly a hangover from
an export drop in the last half of 2012, as growth
over the course of 2013 itself has been more solid.
On an annual basis, exports growth is expected to

54

rise to 3.1% in 2014 and 4.0% in 2015, in line with
the expected improvement in external demand.
Business investment has been weak since the
outbreak of the crisis and savings in the corporate
sector have been stable at a very high level over
the last three years. In 2013, business investment
was arguably boosted by the 'investment window'
tax breaks, which ended by the turn of the year.
Private investment is expected to further accelerate
in the forecast period, supported by low interest
rates and in line with the further recovery in
private consumption and exports.

Unemployment is edging downwards

The pick-up in economic activity is set to lead to
moderate growth in employment by about 0.5%
annually in the forecast period. Despite a steep
increase in 2008 and 2009, the unemployment rate
never reached the same heights as in previous
downturns in the early 1980s and 1990s. Job
churning has stayed at a high level during the
crisis, with close to 20% of the employed changing
job every year. There are correspondingly high inand outflows of unemployment and thus a relative
low level of long-term unemployment (1.7% of the
active population in the third quarter of 2013).

Member States, Denmark

Unemployment has been on a downward trend
since spring 2012 and is projected to decline
further in the forecast period, in line with
employment trends. According to the European
Commission’s consumer survey, consumers have
become more optimistic with regard to future
developments in the labour market, with a majority
now expecting decreasing unemployment over the
next 12 months. Compared to consumers in other
EU-countries, the Danes have been the most
optimistic on this topic in the last eight months.
HICP inflation has picked-up slightly at the end of
2013 following a declining trend in the three first
quarters of the year. In 2013, inflation was dragged
down by food prices (due to excise tax cuts at the
beginning of the year), as well as dampening
effects from the energy price development and
insurance prices. HICP inflation is expected to
increase gradually in the course of 2014, in line
with the gradual strengthening of the economic
activity, reaching 1.5% for the year as a whole.

economy, and any shocks abroad would have a
direct impact on the Danish economy. On the
domestic side, there are upward risks related to a
possible release of pent-up of demand, primarily in
private consumption, but also in business
investments. There are both positive and negative
risks related to the ongoing consolidation process
in the households and in the corporate sector.
Fiscal outlook is stable

The general government deficit is estimated to
have reached 0.3% of GDP in 2013, 1.4 pps. lower
than in the autumn forecast. The revision is partly
related to higher than expected one-off revenues
from the possibility to move forward taxation of
existing capital pension schemes at favourable
conditions. This measure will also have a positive
impact on the fiscal balance in 2014, where the
budget deficit, however, is forecast to increase to
1.3%. The one-off effects from the capital pension
measure will not have an impact in 2015, and the
fiscal deficit is expected to increase to 2.7%.

The risks to the macroeconomic outlook appear to
be broadly balanced. Denmark is a small and open

5. GERMANY
Accelerated growth in the offing
Economic growth is expected to accelerate, powered by domestic demand. Favourable financing
conditions and dissipating uncertainty should lead to a gradual recovery in investment in equipment
after disappointing outcomes in 2012-13, while low interest rates and a robust labour market should
further support private consumption and housing investment. The general government budget is forecast
to remain balanced and the gross debt-to-GDP ratio to decline.
Marked growth this year and next

Following uneven economic activity in the first
half of 2013, real GDP growth broadly stabilised
in the second half of the year. The third quarter
saw a 0.3% (q-o-q, seasonally and working-day
adjusted) increase and was followed by a 0.4%
expansion in the final quarter according to the
official flash estimate. In 2013 as a whole, real
GDP rose by 0.4%. Annual growth was driven by
private and government consumption. Investment
continued to show weakness and together with net
external trade contributed negatively to growth.
For the first quarter of 2014 and beyond, indicators
point to some acceleration of economic growth
followed by stabilisation at quite robust rates.
Business expectations reveal high optimism in the
economy as a whole and orders as well as
production expectations indicate significant growth
contributions from manufacturing. Compared to
the autumn projection, growth contributions are
expected to remain broadly unchanged from net
exports and to increase from domestic demand.
Real GDP is projected to expand by 1.8% in 2014
and by 2.0% in 2015. The acceleration of activity
in 2015 is almost entirely due to more working
days than this year.
Robust consumption and labour market

Real private consumption is supported by low
interest rates and weaker than previously projected
consumer price increases. Robust labour market
developments
underpin
households'
high
propensity to buy. Rising labour supply, largely
due to high net migration, is set to be more than
offset by labour demand. This is reflected in a
gradual reduction in the unemployment rate and
reaccelerating wage growth this year and next.
Investment on a rising path

The investment outlook is favourable. Following a
protracted decline, investment in equipment saw a
moderate turnaround in mid-2013. An upward

56

trend in domestic orders of capital goods and a
continued rise in firms' investment plans amid
dissipating uncertainty and favourable financing
conditions suggest a further pick-up. Corporate
construction investment should move in line with
investment in equipment in the medium term,
while vibrant housing investment is expected to
reduce its pace of expansion somewhat.
Import growth fuelled by domestic demand

Rising industrial orders from abroad and optimistic
export expectations indicate slightly stronger
export growth than projected in the autumn. Along
with reaccelerating investment in equipment,
imports are set to rise more dynamically than
exports, hence contributing to a limited narrowing
of the current-account surplus.

Inflation broadly stable at moderate levels

Inflation dropped markedly at the end of 2013. The
lowering impact of further easing food and energy
price pressure on headline inflation is expected to
be largely offset by gradually rising core inflation
on the back of a narrowing output gap and rising
labour costs. Overall, consumer prices are
projected to increase by 1.4% per year in 2014 and
2015.

Member States, Germany

agreement of the new federal government such as
increased spending on childcare facilities, transport
infrastructure and research have not yet been
sufficiently specified and hence not been taken
into account, but should not change substantially
the projections. Overall, the general government
budget is forecast to remain broadly balanced and
the structural balance to remain in surplus, though
decreasing slightly over the forecast horizon,
resulting in a declining gross debt-to-GDP ratio.
The ongoing winding up of "bad banks" could
further reduce the debt stock.

Fiscal stance turning slightly expansionary

According to the preliminary official estimate, the
general government budget remained broadly
balanced with a slight deficit of 0.1% of GDP in
2013 after a surplus of 0.1% in 2012.
Given the outlook for more dynamic economic
activity compared to recent years, revenue growth
is projected to accelerate somewhat over the
forecast horizon, despite the second step of the
increase in the minimum income tax allowance
this year.

Graph II.5.2:Germany - General government
budget balance and gross debt

Expenditure is projected to increase equally, in
particular due to higher pension increases, the
restructuring fund set up in response to last year's
flood disaster, wage increases in the public sector
and the new childcare allowance for parents not
making use of childcare facilities. The projections
also include pension reform proposals of the new
federal government that foresee additional benefits
for certain groups of pensioners. Consequently, the
pension contribution rate has not been further
lowered this year as planned in autumn. Further

6. ESTONIA
GDP growth regaining momentum with recovering exports
Real GDP growth slowed to 0.7% in 2013 but is expected to regain momentum to reach 2.3% in 2014
and 3.6% in 2015, as external demand recovers. Estonia's public debt is expected to remain close to
10% of GDP and only small fiscal deficits are forecast this year and next.
Growth picking up again in the second half of
2013

Real GDP growth dropped to 0.7% in 2013, from
3.9% in 2012. However, the slowdown in
economic growth has stabilised as seasonally
adjusted GDP remained broadly unchanged in the
fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the previous
one. Private investments picked up again in the
second half of 2013, over-compensating a decline
in government investment due to the end of a
number of environmental projects and the
completion of most EU co-funded programmes.
Consumption continued to support economic
growth as household income has been
strengthening thanks to strong real wage growth,
rising employment and higher pensions. On the
negative side, lower domestic demand in Estonia's
main trading partners together with the diversion
of oil-related transit trade to new Russian ports led
to quasi-stagnation in Estonia's exports volumes of
services, while imports continued to grow.
Positive growth outlook for 2014 and 2015

With external demand progressively recovering,
the economy is expected to regain momentum with
growth forecast at 2.3% in 2014 and 3.6% in 2015.
Capacity utilisation is now close to its long-term
average, which is expected to prompt an increase
in production capacity from 2014 as demand has
started recovering.
Consumption growth is forecast to remain
vigorous, supported by strong real income growth,
including from income tax cuts in 2015.
Household borrowing is projected to increase only
moderately despite very low interest rates, as
banks will remain cautious towards the still
relatively high private sector indebtedness. Finally,
Estonia's recovering export growth to its main
trading partners is expected to maintain the trade
balance slightly positive, despite domestic demand
gathering pace, with investment progressively
recovering. Downside risks to the forecast could
stem from wages rising faster than productivity,
thereby limiting competitiveness and corporate
investment.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Export market gr.(y-o-y%)

Large wage increases in a tightening labour
market …

Despite the slowing output growth, employment
expanded further in 2013, which is partly
explained by the lagged effect of more vigorous
growth in 2012. At the same time, the
unemployment rate fell to 8.8%, down from 10.2%
a year earlier. Employment is expected to grow
further and unemployment to continue contracting
over the forecast horizon, but at a much slower
pace in a tightening labour market. Labour force
participation is high at close to 70% and is set to
increase slightly over the forecast horizon, given
the changing age structure of the working age
population. Nominal wage growth accelerated to
8.8% in the third quarter of 2013, with real wage
growth reaching 5.4%. This is driven partly by
persistent skill mismatches and rising vacancies,
recent minimum wage increases, pay agreements
for health workers and teachers as well as fast
wage catching up in traded services. In 2015,
nominal wage growth is expected to stabilise at
around 7% and real wage growth at around 4%,
reflecting solid output growth, further minimum
wage increases by 10% each year and
unemployment hovering around its natural rate.
… while inflation stabilises at lower levels

With the impact of earlier global commodity price
increases fading out, HICP inflation receded to
3.2% in 2013. The assumed decline in global

Member States, Estonia

commodity prices is expected to ensure that
inflation will continue its slow decline, just below
2.0% in 2014. However, rising core inflation
reflecting strong wage growth and a further excise
tax increase on alcohol are set to push inflation
back to around 3% in 2015.

package will enter into force that is expected to
compensate the expenditure increase. This includes
further excise tax increases and a rescheduling of
dividend distribution from state-owned companies.
However, some implementation risks have
appeared for VAT-enhancing measures, initially
planned to take effect as of mid-2014.

Small fiscal deficit continuing

The general government balance is forecast to
show a small deficit of 0.4% of GDP in 2013. The
postponement of the dividend distribution from
state owned companies to the government had a
negative effect on the fiscal outcome. However,
tax revenue remained strong despite relatively
slow real GDP growth.

On a no-policy-change basis, an unchanged
government balance is projected for 2015. In the
course of the year, public investment is expected to
revert to growth as the 2014-20 package of EU
funds will start being implemented. The income
tax rate cut by 1 pp. to 20% scheduled for
1 January 2015 will contribute to a decline in the
tax burden.

In 2014, the deficit is projected to remain
unchanged at 0.4% of GDP. On the one hand, the
public wage bill is projected to increase by 5.1%
and pensions by 5.8%, while the compensation
mechanism for the second pillar pension
contributions will negatively affect the revenue.
On the other hand, a sizeable revenue-enhancing

In structural terms, the fiscal position is forecast to
have deteriorated by 0.3 pp. in 2013 and to
improve by 0.4 pp. of GDP in 2014; in 2015, on a
no-policy-change basis, it is expected to
deteriorate by 0.3 pp. of GDP. The debt-to-GDP
ratio is expected to remain close to 10% of GDP in
2014-15.

7. IRELAND
Adjustment supported by stronger economic growth
A modest pick-up in economic growth is expected in 2014 and the labour market is continuing to show
welcome signs of improvement. Fiscal adjustment is on track, but includes temporary deficit-improving
factors in 2014 and is not yet fully specified for 2015.
Virtuous cycle of domestic recovery builds up

Balanced macroeconomic risks

After a slow start to 2013, growth began to pick up
in the third quarter. High-frequency data suggest
that further improvements can be expected in the
final quarter and this underpins the forecast annual
growth of 0.3% for 2013. There are indications
domestic demand is starting to perform more
strongly, as the labour market has continued along
a steady path of improvement across different
sectors.

Persistent weakness in merchandise trade
highlights the importance for growth of sustaining
the ongoing recovery in service exports, as well as
a stronger contribution to growth from domestic
demand. The dependence of goods export on the
performance of the pharmaceutical sector
constitutes a risk to net exports, especially if the
effects of patent expiry on trade volumes are not
sufficiently offset by growth in new product lines.
Given the importance of UK trade, in particular for
indigenous Irish firms, the accelerated rate of UK
recovery represents an important upside risk for
growth, employment and the current-account
position.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Unemployment fell to 12.4% in December 2013,
its lowest level since June 2009. Employment
gains seen earlier in 2013 mainly in the part-time
and casual sectors of the labour force have moved
into full-time employment gains, although this has
not yet translated into wage pressure. Inflation
remains below the euro-area average extending
recent improvements in competitiveness.
Real GDP growth in 2014 is forecast at 1.8%, as
economic recovery in key trading partners is
expected to sustain positive export growth,
particularly
for
services,
while
further
improvements in the labour market and a rise in
investment, from low levels, are expected to
support domestic demand. Growth is forecast to
rise further in 2015 to 2.9%, on foot of a
stabilisation of domestic demand and better net
trade as conditions improve in key export markets.

60

The lack of wage pressure, while beneficial to
competitiveness, heightens the challenge of
reducing private sector indebtedness, which,
although on a gradual downward path, continues to
weigh on growth. A stronger contribution from
investment to growth will depend on
improvements in the supply of new credit,
especially to SMEs and to the construction sector,
for which output must begin to rise in centres of
economic activity in order to satisfy medium-term
housing and commercial property demand.
Deficit correction stabilises public debt

The 2013 fiscal deficit is estimated at 7.2% of
GDP based on end-year cash data, which were
slightly better than expected. Consumption-related
revenue continued to be weak, while direct tax
revenue on labour and corporate income fared
better. Overall, the expenditure outturn was
broadly in line with budget plans, while some
overruns in the health sector were offset by savings
elsewhere. The forecast assumes that a dividend
payment from Allied Irish Bank (AIB) in ordinary
shares to the government improves the 2013 deficit
by 0.2% of GDP, but the statistical treatment of
this transaction will be reviewed by Eurostat in
April 2014.

Member States, Ireland

In 2014, the general government deficit is
projected at 4.8% of GDP. The forecast includes
the discretionary measures presented in the
2014 budget of 1.5% of GDP, and other deficit
improving elements, some of which are temporary.
Discretionary measures include tax increases on
alcohol and tobacco, on bank deposits, on pension
fund assets and on financial institutions.
Expenditure measures include further public sector
wage savings, and tighter eligibility for social
benefits and medical services.

budget balance net of one-off and other temporary
measures is projected to decline from 6.5% of
GDP in 2013 to 4.7% in 2015. (17)

In 2015, following established practice, the general
government deficit is projected at 4.3% of GDP on
a no-policy-change assumption, that is, it includes
consolidation measures that had been announced
with a sufficient degree of detail at the cut-off date
of the forecast. Specifically, the forecast assumes
tax revenues will grow in line with the respective
tax base and that nominal expenditure is kept
constant in level terms, with the exception of some
adjustments for demographic factors. The 2015
deficit forecast includes a negative carry-over of
around 0.4% of GDP largely due to one-off
measures having impact on 2014 and the reduction
in the pension fund levy. The cyclically-adjusted

Uncertainty over growth is among the main risks
to the fiscal forecast. Further risks relate to
effective implementation of the 2014 budget, in
particular in the health sector given past overruns.
Also, the government may have to compensate any
possible shortfall in the asset sales linked to the
winding-up of the Irish Banking Resolution
Corporation (IBRC).

Government debt is estimated to have peaked at
122% of GDP in 2013 and is projected to decline
to 120% in 2014 due to a fall in high precautionary
cash balances. Given the no-policy-change
assumption, the debt ratio will stabilise at 120%
for 2015, as a primary surplus is partly offset by
a negative growth-interest differential.

(17)

One-off measures include one-off guarantee payments
related to the liquidation of IBRC in 2013 (0.7% of GDP),
one-off revenue from the sale of mobile telephone licenses
in 2013 (0.4% of GDP), one-off revenue from the sale of
the National Lottery licence in 2014 (0.2% of GDP), as
well as one-off financial sector measures for credit unions
in 2014 and 2015 (less than 0.1% of GDP in each year).

8. GREECE
First signs of recovery
Recent data support expectations that Greece should return to growth in 2014. Confidence indicators
continue to improve, whilst hard data releases suggest the first signs of recovery. Structural reforms
undertaken in labour and product markets have underpinned improved competitiveness leading to
expectations for strengthened exports and investment.
Gains in fiscal stability and competitiveness
support confidence and recovery

During the second half of 2013 the recession has
continued to soften, as real GDP contracted at a
decelerating y-o-y pace: from -5.5% in the first
quarter 2013 to the fourth quarter flash reading of
-2.6%. The strong revival of tourism since the last
spring with its spillovers on the economy helped
this trend, which has continued despite a high
concentration of tax payments in the last quarter of
2013 affecting consumption. Overall, real GDP
growth in 2013 is projected to have contracted by 3.7%, revised upwards from -4% in the autumn
forecast.
The Economic Sentiment Indicator resumed its
upward path in January 2014 pulled by services
and retail, and the Purchasing Managers Index,
passing the level of 50 for the first time since
August 2009.This indicates further an expansion in
output and new orders. The repayment of
government arrears and the faster absorption of the
EU and EIB funds through the re-launch of major
projects such as motorway construction are
expected to help alleviate liquidity constraints and
support investment in 2014. The bank
recapitalisation process and fiscal stabilisation are
also supportive. Led by exports and investment,
real GDP is expected to expand in 2014 at an
annual growth rate of 0.6%. However, private
consumption is expected to still decline in line
with disposable income, with the ongoing fall in
prices somewhat moderating the impact of recent
wage adjustments.

already contributed to a sharp improvement in cost
competitiveness which together with the
announced programmes of employment support,
and the pick-up in investment should lead to a
relatively
strong
projected
decrease
of
unemployment to 26.0% in 2014 and 24.0% in
2015.
Consumer prices fell moderately by 0.9% in 2013
and are expected to fall by 0.6% in 2014, reflecting
weak domestic demand, falling unit labour costs
and the implementation of product market reforms.
As the economic recovery gains pace, prices are
expected to increase only weakly by 0.2% in 2015.
The current-account deficit is projected at -2.3% of
GDP for 2013 and is expected to narrow to -1.8%
in 2014 and -1.6% in 2015, as exports and imports
pick up along with the economic recovery also
facilitated by ongoing reforms to simplify trade
activities.

The recovery is forecast to gain strength in 2015,
as investment takes over as the main engine of the
recovery, also attracted by the opportunities
created by the ongoing structural reforms. The
euro-area recovery should support a revival in
goods exports, as well as stronger shipping and
tourism revenues. With consumption recovering,
real GDP growth is projected at 2.9%.

Risks on the upside are related to better
performance of exports, stronger tourism
performance and/or a stronger liquidity impact of
the arrears clearance. On the downside, policy
implementation slippages could undermine
confidence, affecting investment and exports.
Risks have to be re-evaluated in light of the release
by ELSTAT on 11 March 2014 of the fourth
quarter 2013 GDP and components.

Member States, Greece

Budgetary situation is improving

In 2013, the headline overall balance is expected to
have deteriorated to 13.1% of GDP from 9.0% of
GDP in 2012. This deterioration is mainly driven
by the one-off costs of bank recapitalization (11%
of GDP) which more than offsets the improvement
of the underlying fiscal situation and higher
transfers
received
by
Member
States
corresponding to profits on Greek Bonds held by
the Eurosystem Central Banks and other small
factors. The structural balance is forecast to have
turned into a surplus of 1.7% of GDP,
1.8 percentage points higher than in 2012.
Current projections assume that programme
objectives for 2014 and 2015 are fulfilled through
measures to be discussed during the ongoing
review. The headline deficit is thus projected to
fall to 2.2% of GDP in 2014 and 1.0% of GDP in
2015.

9. SPAIN
The recovery becomes firmer while the rebalancing of the economy
continues
The incipient economic recovery is forecast to get firmer in the coming quarters, backed by improved
confidence and some easing of financing conditions. While the rebalancing of the economy is expected
to continue, the growth contribution from external demand is expected to narrow. Employment is
forecast to start growing, and the unemployment rate to retreat gradually, amidst continued moderation
in unit labour costs. The budget deficit is set to narrow in 2014 but government debt will still rise.
Spain returned to positive growth territory since
the third quarter of 2013 amidst improved
confidence and some relaxation of financial
conditions. Spain successfully exited the Financial
Assistance Programme for the Recapitalisation of
Financial Institutions and the stabilisation of
Spanish financial markets continues, with
sovereign-bond yields at new lows. In general,
financing conditions have improved, although they
remain onerous for some borrowers, especially for
SMEs. Despite these improvements, the still large
debt levels and high unemployment weigh on
growth prospects and a source of vulnerability to
adverse shocks.
Domestic demand to offset narrowing net
exports

GDP growth accelerated to 0.3% q-o-q in the last
quarter of 2013 and the recovery is foreseen to
consolidate gradually over 2014. While GDP
contracted by 1.2% in 2013, it is expected to grow
by 1% in 2014 and to gain some further
momentum in 2015.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

The narrowing contribution from the external
sector in the second half of 2013 has been more
than offset by a less negative contribution from
domestic demand. This more balanced growth

64

composition is expected to continue over the
coming quarters, with domestic demand gaining
some momentum while net external demand
provides a positive but declining contribution.
Deleveraging in the private sector will continue to
constrain private consumption and investment.
Nevertheless, private consumption is forecast to
rise, backed by increases in disposable income,
improved employment prospects and higher
confidence. The projected increase in real gross
disposable income, also helped by low inflation
(0.3% in 2014), should also allow for a rising –
albeit still low – household saving rate over the
forecast horizon.
Private investment in equipment is foreseen to
benefit from the improved economic outlook and
the relative strength of exports, which is one of its
most important drivers. By contrast, the adjustment
of residential investment, while well advanced, has
not reached its inflection point yet, with building
permits at historical lows and still falling. Housing
transactions seem to have stabilised at very low
levels.
Despite a recent deceleration, export growth is set
to remain robust, backed by ongoing
improvements in price and cost-competitiveness
and healthy foreign markets growth. At the same
time, imports are forecast to accelerate in line with
final demand. As a result of the rising currentaccount surplus, Spain's net lending is projected to
expand over the forecast horizon to around 2.3%
of GDP in 2015.
Employment growth back to positive territory

Having peaked at 27.2% in the first quarter of
2013, the unemployment rate retreated to 26% at
the end of last year, mainly due to the decline in
the labour force, whereas employment kept falling.
However, the process of job destruction is
bottoming out and employment is expected to start
registering positive growth rates in 2014,

Member States, Spain

contributing to a moderate fall in unemployment.
Although productivity growth is expected to
decelerate, wage moderation should allow for
further improvements in nominal unit labour costs
and competitiveness gains.
Downside risks to the growth forecast include a
possible stronger-than-expected slowdown of
emerging economies and in particular South
America, where the exposure of the banking sector
is significant. On the upside, a faster-than-expected
easing of financing conditions could boost
domestic demand.
Budget deficit reduction set to continue,
helped by recovery

Outturn data for 2013 suggest that fiscal
consolidation continued last year, but at a more
moderate pace than in 2012. The general
government deficit is expected to reach 6.7% of
GDP for the full year (net of bank recapitalisation
costs of about 0.5% of GDP), as the latest data
indicate that current revenues may underperform
expectations and some expenditure posts might not
have fallen as much as planned, inter alia
government investment.

The slightly improved macroeconomic outlook
contributes to the expected reduction in the general
government deficit to 5.8% of GDP in 2014. In
addition to the measures presented in the 2014
Budget, further measures of about ¼% of GDP
have been announced at the end of last year,
including a widening of the base for social security
contributions to previously exempt benefits in kind
such as transportation aid, lunch vouchers and
company cars, as well as the introduction of direct
billing. On the expenditure side, cuts were
announced regarding some severance payments.
While interest and pension expenditure are
expected to rise further, falling unemployment and
the change in the pension indexation formula
should contribute to a deceleration of social
transfers in 2014.
Under the no-policy-change assumption, the
headline deficit is expected to widen to 6.5% of
GDP in 2015. This projection assumes that some
temporary tax measures will expire in 2014. The
structural deficit is estimated to be close to 4¼% of
GDP in both 2013 and 2014 before rising to 5¾%
in 2015. Large public deficits and low nominal
GDP growth are projected to push the general
government gross debt to 99% of GDP in 2014 and
103% of GDP in 2015.

10. FRANCE
Recovery remains slow amid sizeable budget deficits
The incipient recovery is expected to firm up somewhat in the course of 2014 and in 2015, mainly
supported by a timid pick-up in domestic demand, on the back of increasing confidence. Unemployment
is set to decelerate and inflation to remain low, but no improvement in the current account balance is in
sight. The general government balance is expected to improve only slightly in 2014.
A long way towards recovery

Entrepreneurs slowly gaining confidence

After eight quarters of economic stagnation, GDP
rebounded at the end of 2013, although partly
driven by temporary factors. Activity is thus
expected to slow down during the first quarter of
this year, before accelerating again, at first
stimulated by stronger external demand, relieved
afterwards by private consumption supported by
improved confidence, and in turn, by firms'
investment. All in all, after 0.3% in 2013, real
GDP growth is forecast to accelerate gradually to
1.0% in 2014 and, under the no-policy-change
assumption, 1.7% in 2015.

After two years of contraction, the rebound in
investment in equipment observed since mid-2013
is expected to continue, eased by favourable
corporate lending conditions. The unexpected
relative resilience of economic growth in 2013 as a
whole seems to have boosted business confidence,
and the tax credit for competitiveness is expected
to have gradually a positive effect on firms'
financial situation. However, the full impact of this
measure on investment may take some time to
materialise. The expected rise in aggregate demand
and in capacity utilisation is set to translate into a
firm turnaround in investment only from 2015. The
"Responsibility Pact" announced in January 2014
has not been taken into account in this forecast, as
it is not sufficiently specified yet.

Improving consumer confidence

Private consumption, the traditional growth driver
of the French economy, is expected to keep
accelerating, growing by 0.6% in 2014 and 1.6%
in 2015, largely explaining GDP growth
projections as a whole. In 2014 and driven by the
expected
stabilisation
of
unemployment,
household confidence should further improve,
pushing down the saving rate slightly. This,
coupled with low inflation levels, helps explain the
projected private consumption growth.

66

Exports are projected to accelerate from 2014 on
the back of the assumed rebound in world demand.
The recent competitiveness reforms could
gradually reduce the pace of losses in export
market shares, albeit without reversing the trend.
Export growth is projected to remain slightly
below that of world demand over the forecast
horizon. With imports picking up due to the
gradual increase in domestic demand, net exports
are expected to provide a nil contribution to
growth in 2014 and to dampen it again in 2015.
Decelerating unemployment, low inflation

In a context of subdued growth, employers are
likely to favour increasing productivity over job
creation throughout 2014. In addition, the potential
positive impact of the recent labour market reform
is only expected to be visible from 2015. Only
subsidised job schemes in the public sector are
assumed to stimulate total employment in 2014.
Meanwhile, the persistent expansion of the labour
force should maintain the unemployment rate at a
high level over the forecast horizon.

Member States, France

The moderate price increase at the end of 2013
(0.8% y-o-y in December), contracting energy
prices and still modest activity growth are set to
mitigate the impact of the VAT increases on
inflation, which is set to reach 1.2% in 2014, after
having bottomed out at 1.0% in 2013. In 2015,
inflation is expected to stabilise on the back of a
gradual closure of the output gap.
Room for measured optimism

In case of a job-richer recovery, private
consumption could accelerate further. In addition,
an earlier specification of the announced
"Responsibility Pact" could improve business
confidence, with positive impact on investment.
Deficit targets at risk

In 2013, the general government deficit is expected
to have decreased to 4.2% of GDP based on the
latest data available. In particular, the outcome for
the state budget showed a 0.1% of GDP deviation
from the forecast underpinning the draft budget for
2014. Shortfalls in tax revenue proved higher than
expected while spending was kept under control.
In addition, preliminary information suggests that
healthcare spending was slightly below target.

In 2014, the deficit is set to decrease further on the
back of the measures adopted notably as part of the
budget. On top of existing spending rules (central
government and healthcare), measures include new
provisions on how annual pension increases are
linked to inflation. In addition, the 2010 pension
reform, which will (with some exceptions)
gradually lead to an increase in the minimum
retirement age from 60 to 62, will bring additional
savings. Contrary to previous years, the tax burden
is forecast to remain broadly unchanged at around
46% of GDP. Overall, the deficit is forecast to
reach 4.0% of GDP in 2014.
The structural balance is estimated to improve by
¾% and ½% of GDP in 2013 and 2014,
respectively. Overall, the structural effort is
projected to fall short of the levels recommended
by the Council in both years. Under the no-policychange assumption, the general government
balance is set to improve in 2015, reflecting
recovering tax revenues partly offset by projected
expenditure developments.
The general government debt to GDP ratio, which
is projected to have almost reached 94% of GDP in
2013, will continue to rise on the back of still high
public deficits relative to nominal GDP growth.

Muted growth prospects amid a high fiscal deficit and rising debt
After five years of recession, Croatia's real GDP is forecast to grow by 0.5% in 2014, supported by
exports and investments. Growth is expected to strengthen in 2015 as a result of a mild upturn in
domestic demand. The headline general government deficit is expected to improve in 2014 and 2015
mainly due to one off effects.
Economic activity declines further

Real GDP is forecast to have contracted by 0.7%
in 2013, which would be the fifth year of
recession, with real GDP being almost 12% lower
compared to 2008. Both domestic demand and net
exports are expected to have contributed
negatively to growth in 2013.
After decreasing by 0.6% y-o-y in the third quarter
of 2013, real GDP is expected to have remained
negative in the fourth quarter, according to
available indicators. Retail trade activity fell
markedly in the fourth quarter while monthly trade
data also showed sharp declines. By contrast, after
a decline in the second and third quarter, industrial
production improved slightly in the fourth quarter.

In 2015, a modest recovery is expected on the back
of a mild upturn in domestic demand. Recent
legislative changes to improve the business
conditions and the increased availability of EU
funds are expected to underpin investment activity.
Owing to a high foreign component, the foreseen
pick-up of investment in 2015 is expected to drive
up imports.

Muted recovery in 2014

In 2014, real GDP is forecast to grow by 0.5%, on
current policies. Net exports of goods and services
and investment are expected to be the main
contributors to growth. The projected pick-up in
investment in 2014 is expected to be led by the
public sector, assuming increased recourse to EU
funds. Growth in private investment is expected to
remain constrained due to fragile domestic demand
and ongoing bank deleveraging. Croatian exports
are forecast to benefit from the gradual economic
recovery in the EU, but to a limited extent because
of comparatively less favourable developments in
Italy and Slovenia, two of the country’s major
trading partners. Furthermore, goods exports will
be held back by the narrow manufacturing base
and still ongoing restructuring in some important
industries.
Private consumption is expected to contribute
negatively to growth in 2014, due to a worsening
labour market situation and ongoing deleveraging
of households. Employment fell in the last part of
2013 and is expected to stagnate in 2014. Wage
growth dynamics would remain weak in view of
the muted recovery. However, low inflation is
forecast to provide a partial cushion, limiting
losses in purchasing power.

Inflation expected to remain low

Weak economic activity is set to lead to stagnation
in employment in 2014, followed by a mild
improvement in 2015; the unemployment rate is
expected to stabilise in 2014 at around 17.6% and
to decline somewhat in 2015.
Inflation slowed down significantly towards the
end of the year. This reflects the combined effect
of absence of import price pressures, weak
domestic demand and lower processed food prices.
Producer prices have also been declining on a
y-o-y basis since August. It is expected that
consumer price inflation will remain low over the
forecast horizon. It is forecast to be at 1.3% in
2014, partly owing to the fading out of the impact
of the preferential VAT rate increase from 0% to
5% in January 2013, and increase slightly in 2015.
The hike in the intermediate VAT rate from 10%
to 13% in January 2014 is expected to lead to a
limited upward impact on prices.

Member States, Croatia

pension system adopted by parliament in January,
but not the budget revision or any additional
measures still under discussion. Under the ESA95
accounting rules, the headline general government
deficit is expected to improve to 5.4% and 4.8% of
GDP in 2014 and 2015, respectively, mainly as a
result of the one off effect of transferring a part of
the second pillar to the first pillar in these two
years. Under the new accounting rules that will
come into force this autumn (ESA2010), such
transfers will not count as revenue anymore. The
structural balance is expected to deteriorate in
2014 due to the combination of increases in
general government expenditure, such as
investment and interest expenditure. On the
revenue side, the collection of indirect taxes is
expected to recover somewhat.

Risks are mainly on the downside

Heightened competitive pressures in the wake of
EU accession are already apparent in some sectors
of the economy, like retail trade, and it may take
longer to restore trade flows affected by the exit
from the CEFTA area. A further contraction in
domestic credit, especially to SMEs, may also pose
a growth risk. Furthermore, the capacity to absorb
EU funds in the near-term will be a key factor
determining the achievability of projected
investment gains.
High fiscal deficit and rising debt

The general government deficit is expected to have
reached 6.0% of GDP in 2013. On the revenue side
this deterioration mainly reflects shortfalls in
corporate income tax and social contributions and
on the expenditure side increases in social benefits
and interest expenses. Measures such as the
reduction in public sector wage bill dampened the
expenditure increase in 2013.

The ratio of public debt to GDP is forecast to
increase over the forecast period, from 55.5% in
2012 to 68.7% in 2015 on the back of persistently
high deficits and subdued nominal GDP growth.
Risks to the fiscal forecast seem skewed to the
downside, mainly owing to worse than expected
macro-economic prospects.

For 2014 this forecast incorporates the 2014
budget act and the legislative changes to the

12. ITALY
A slow recovery is underway
After contracting 1.9% in 2013, Italy's economy is expected to stage a slow recovery in 2014, driven by
stronger external demand. As credit conditions ease, growth is expected to rise further in 2015.
Unemployment peaked in late 2013 while inflation remains low. The government structural primary
surplus – i.e. adjusted for the cycle and one-offs – is expected to stabilise at around 4½% of GDP over
2013-15.
After a severe recession, the economy
returned to growth at the end of 2013

The contraction in output recorded since mid-2011
came to a halt with economic activity posting a
moderate increase in the last quarter of 2013. Over
the year, real GDP is estimated to have declined by
1.9% (after -2.5% in 2012). The strong fall in
domestic demand acted as a drag on the economy
due to persistently tight financing conditions and
high uncertainty holding back consumption and
investments.
In 2014 a recovery is expected to set in driven by
the tradable sector. Confidence in manufacturing
points to expansion thanks to new export orders.
As external demand strengthens – also from
euro-area trade partners – industrial activity is
expected to increase and the service sector is set to
follow suit. As a result, real GDP is projected to
grow by 0.6%. Domestic demand is also forecast
to contribute positively to output growth, mainly
driven by investment in equipment as capacity
utilisation is projected to increase, in particular in
exporting firms. Investment in construction,
instead, is forecast to further decline also in light
of persistently tight credit conditions. With still
difficult labour market conditions, private
consumption is expected to rise only marginally
and by less than disposable income as households
restore their savings.
Italian banks are expected to continue adjusting
their balance sheets, which should pave the way to
more favourable credit conditions for firms and
households. This is set to support domestic
demand and ultimately output growth in 2015, at
1.2%. As also imports accelerate, the currentaccount surplus is forecast to stabilise slightly
above 1% of GDP in 2014-15.
Feeble demand and high unemployment are
set to keep inflation low

The labour market is set to adjust with a lag to
improving economic conditions and the recovery

70

to start from a rise in working hours. After the
significant drop recorded in 2013, headcount
employment is expected to fall further in 2014,
although only marginally. As labour supply
remains fairly stable, unemployment is set to
decline only slightly from the 12.8% peak recorded
in November 2013. Sustained unemployment is
expected to decrease wage pressures and to
restrain wage growth. This, coupled with slightly
improving productivity, entails only moderate
increases in nominal unit labour cost. As the
economy strengthens in 2015, unemployment is set
to decline to 12.4% and wage dynamics to be more
sustained mainly on the back of the renewal of
public sector contracts.

The limited labour cost pressures together with
weak consumption and stable energy prices lead
the forecast for HICP inflation to fall to 0.9% in
2014, and then increase to 1.3% in 2015 as the
economic recovery strengthens.
Government deficit on a decreasing path

The general government deficit is estimated at 3%
of GDP in 2013, unchanged from 2012. Primary
expenditure is estimated to have increased by
nearly 1% y-o-y (after declining by around 1.5%
over 2010-12) as the government settled overdue
trade debt, which raised investment expenditure in

Member States, Italy

2013 (by around 0.5% of GDP). However,
government finances benefitted from declining
yields on sovereign bonds, leading to a decrease in
interest expenditure (to 5.3% of GDP from 5.5% in
2012). As a result total expenditure is set to have
risen only marginally. Higher revenues are set to
compensate for the spending rise thanks also to
additional taxation on the financial sector
offsetting the reduction in property taxes.
In 2014, the headline deficit is projected at 2.6% of
GDP. Interest expenditure is expected to stabilise
and the primary surplus to continue improving to
2.7% of GDP. The moderate year-on-year increase
in primary expenditure is forecast to be more than
offset by an increase in current revenues in line
with nominal GDP growth, while capital revenues
are set to fall on the back of expiring one-offs. In
2015, the deficit is forecast to narrow to 2.2% of
GDP under a no-policy-change assumption mainly
thanks to higher growth.
The structural balance is estimated to have further
improved in 2013. An additional marginal
improvement (to -0.6% of GDP) is also expected
in 2014, while the structural balance is set to

worsen in 2015, under a no-policy-change
assumption. The structural primary balance is set
to stabilise at around 4½% of GDP in 2013-15.

13. CYPRUS
Recession bottoms out while adjustments are underway
The unwinding of macroeconomic imbalances weighed significantly on economic activity and sentiment
in 2013. The recession is expected to ease in 2014 and growth is set to return in 2015 as domestic
demand recovers. Following a better-than-expected performance last year, the fiscal situation is set to
improve further this year and next.
Note: This forecast was finalised early
February, after the third quarterly review of
the Economic Adjustment Programme, and will
be revisited during the fourth quarterly review.
The recession in 2013…

Economic activity is expected to have contracted
by 6.0% in 2013, which is significantly lower than
projected in the autumn 2013 forecast. This
reflects on one hand, resilient performance of the
tourism and professional service sectors, and, on
the other hand, a smaller-than-anticipated decline
in private consumption. A substantial adjustment
in prices and wages also helped curb the decline in
real GDP. Nevertheless, several factors continued
to weight on economic growth, including tight
credit conditions, private and public sector
deleveraging and worsening labour market
conditions. Reflecting the significant contraction
in domestic demand, imports fell further, leading
to a positive contribution of external demand to
GDP growth. The fourth-quarter flash estimate
released after the finalisation of this forecast
suggests a milder recession than envisaged in the
third review mission.
… will extend into 2014…

Business sentiment and consumer confidence
indicators suggest a continuation of the recession.
The real GDP is projected to decline by -4.8% in
2014, with domestic demand weighed down by the
need for an adjustment of private and public sector
debt from currently high levels. Tight credit
conditions will continue to act as a drag on growth.
Downward wage adjustments are expected to
continue, weighing on disposable income. On the
back of further shrinking of imports and a lesser
fall in exports, a positive contribution to growth is
expected from net trade.

restoration of a sound and well-capitalised banking
sector and the gradual deleveraging of both
households and corporates are expected to
progressively remove the impediments to more
balanced growth. Export of goods and services are
forecast to grow, accompanied by a marginal
increase in imports.
Labour market conditions to improve from 2015

Unemployment is projected to peak in 2014 before
falling slightly in 2015. Unit labour costs are
expected to edge further down, driven by a further
decline in compensation of employees. The
associated weak domestic cost pressure and
sizeable spare capacity will contain HICP inflation
over the forecast horizon, despite indirect tax rate
hikes in 2013 and 2014.
Downside risks remain

Risks are tilted to the downside. On the domestic
front, a more protracted period of tight credit
supply conditions could pose considerable risks to
the real economy. In addition, a slower reduction
of households' debt could prolong the needed
deleveraging process. Moreover, a further
worsening of labour market conditions may lead to
a more prolonged weakness of business and
consumer confidence.

Fiscal adjustment underway

Against the background of the milder recession
and thanks to the significant consolidation efforts
undertaken in line with the programme
requirements, the general government deficit for
2013 is estimated to be significantly better than
projected earlier, reaching 5.5% of GDP. However,
the deficit is project to widen slightly to -5.8% of
GDP in 2014. This is mainly due to falling profits
as well as declining wages and employment in the
private and public sectors that are expected to
translate into lower revenues from direct taxes.
Further drop in private consumption is set to weigh
on the revenues from indirect taxes. On the
expenditure side, further effort to reduce the public
sector wage bill, intermediate consumption and

other current expenditure is projected to outweigh
the increase in social transfers driven by the further
worsening labour market conditions.
In 2015, the improving macroeconomic situation
and better labour market conditions are expected to
support revenue from taxes and social
contributions, while total expenditure is projected
to remain largely unchanged, with higher pension
payments in the private pension scheme, largely
offset by a deceleration of the retirement wave in
the public sector.
After a sharp increase in 2013, the debt-to-GDP
ratio is expected to further increase in 2014 and
2015, broadly reflecting the macroeconomic
conditions.

14. LATVIA
Economic growth and job creation continue at a sound pace
Growth is expected to marginally exceed 4% over the forecast horizon, driven by domestic demand,
rebounding exports, and improved business sentiment supported by the recent euro changeover. Job
creation is set to continue, bringing unemployment below 10% by 2015 amid moderate inflation. The
outlook for public finances remains stable with a low deficit of around 1% of GDP and a declining
public debt ratio.
GDP growth remains strong

Latvia's economy expanded by 4% in 2013,
according to the latest flash estimate, slower than
the 5.2% growth in 2012 but still at the fastest rate
in the EU. Private and public consumption as well
as net exports supported the overall economic
growth while investments and negative changes in
inventories weighed on the downside.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Growth is projected to remain high at 4.2% in
2014 and 4.3% in 2015 as investments are set to
rebound on the basis of improving business
sentiment and higher external demand. Positive
business reactions to the recent euro changeover
are also seen as supportive to investment.
Corporate profits and EU funding are likely to
remain major financing sources for investors as
banking sector deleveraging is still under way.
Overall, domestic demand and exports are
projected to increase at similar rates. However,
investment in capital goods is expected to push
imports to a higher growth rate than exports,
resulting in a slightly negative net external
contribution to GDP growth.
External position keeps improving

The current-account deficit is forecast to remain
below 3% of GDP over the forecast horizon. Net

74

inflows in the capital account, linked mostly to EU
structural funds, are set to exceed the currentaccount outflow, keeping the country's net external
debt on a downward path. Suspended production at
the metallurgical plant in Liepaja weighed heavily
on both exports and imports in 2013.
Consequently, export performance relative to
growth in trading partners deteriorated in gross
terms but in net terms, taking out Liepaja's reexports, the country's external sustainability
indicators improved.

Unemployment dropped to 11.9% in 2013 from
15% in 2012 and the downward trend is set to
continue over the forecast period. The minimum
wage hike in 2014 and some shortage of skills on
specific labour segments are likely to accelerate
wage growth and restrain job creation.
Nevertheless, unemployment is expected to fall
below 10% by 2015, marking a steep improvement
from the peak of 19.5% in 2010 but well above the
record low of 6.1% in 2007. Unit labour costs are
projected to retain a moderate growth in 2014-15,
broadly in line with the dynamics in trading
partners.
Electricity and service prices set to rise

HICP inflation was close to zero in 2013, mainly
due to falling energy prices, which offset the
gradual increase in core inflation. However, the
forthcoming deregulation of household electricity
prices as of April 2014 and the steady advance in
service prices are set to push up inflation to 1.9%
in 2014 and 2.1% in 2015. The first price
monitoring reports on the euro adoption at the
beginning of 2014 show minor inflation effects
related to rounding and passing on of changeover
costs to consumers. The overall one-off impact
from the changeover is therefore expected to
remain within the previously forecast range of
0.2 – 0.3 pp.

Member States, Latvia

Favourable borrowing
markets' confidence

conditions

reflect

In the last months of 2013 the cash balance of the
general government expectedly turned negative,
resulting in an annual cash deficit of 0.5% of GDP.
This cash deficit is mostly attributable to local
governments, whereas the central government's
position was near-balanced. The adjusted general
government deficit according to EDP reporting
requirements is expected to be higher, at 1.3% of
GDP, reflecting notably a guarantee call of 0.3%
of GDP, involving the Liepaja metallurgical plant
that is currently in a standstill, as well as other
adjustments.
The general government deficit is expected to
stabilise at around 1% of GDP in 2014 and 2015
based on current policies. For 2014, these policies
are fixed in the 2014 budget law that was adopted
by the Parliament on 7 November 2013. For 2015,
the planned measures include a 1 pp. cut in the
personal income tax rate and a 1 pp. increase in
state contributions to the privately managed funded
pension scheme. These revenue-reducing measures

are partly offset by a conservative pension
indexation rule. It is, however, not excluded that
this rule could be revised in the context of 2015
budget negotiations. Falling interest expenditure
from 2015 provides another significant cause of
decline in the expenditure-to-GDP ratio.
As borrowing initially planned for the end of 2013
took place only in early 2014, the debt-to-GDP
ratio did not increase in 2013, as previously
expected. In January 2014, the authorities issued a
7-year bond in the amount of EUR 1 billion
(around 4% of GDP) with a favourable yield of
2.815%. The issuance aims to finance the first
repayment, covering one-third of the outstanding
obligations to the EU, under the balance-ofpayments facility. This repayment is due in March
2014. Subject to continuous favourable market
sentiment, the authorities intend to borrow further
in the course of 2014, in order to pre-finance
another large repayment to the EU due in 2015.
After this repayment will be made and the need to
keep the current high level of precautionary
financial buffers elapses, debt is expected to
decline to around 33% of GDP by end-2015.

15. LITHUANIA
Solid growth continues in a context of macroeconomic stability
Growth remained strong in 2013 and is set to continue at a steady pace in 2014 and 2015 with strong
domestic demand as the main growth engine. Unemployment is forecast to decline, but remain high,
while inflation, which slowed significantly in 2013 due to weak energy and food prices, is set to pick up
moderately.
In 2013 domestic demand gradually replaced
net exports as the main growth engine

GDP growth remained strong in 2013 and is
estimated to have reached 3.2% despite a
slowdown in the second half of the year. While in
the first quarter net exports were the main growth
driver, the situation reversed in the second quarter
when the trade contribution turned negative and
domestic demand took over as the main engine for
growth. Private consumption strengthened,
supported by a substantial increase in wages, low
inflation, a robust labour market and strong
confidence indicators. Investment soared in the
second half of the year on the back of high
capacity utilisation rates and positive sentiment.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Growth is set to accelerate on the back of
robust domestic demand

Looking ahead, GDP is forecast to grow by 3.5%
in 2014 and 3.9% in 2015. Private consumption is
set to continue benefitting from further increases in
disposable income of households due to the
recovering labour market, accelerating wage
growth and low inflation. Investment is expected
to grow as interest rates are low and companies
have significant financial reserves to finance
investments. Moreover, EU co-financed projects
will continue to support public investment over the
forecast horizon.

76

Risks to the growth forecast are broadly balanced:
a further slowdown in Russia might hamper
sentiment and exports, while investment growth
might stall as some of it – both public and private
– was of a one-off nature, connected to regulatory
changes and the Lithuanian EU Presidency. On the
upside, credit growth could pick-up.
Net exports likely to remain a drag on growth

Export growth is set to remain subdued in early
2014 before picking up in accordance with an
improving external environment. The positive
effect of the strong 2012 harvest on exports came
to an end in the second quarter of 2013. In
addition, in the second half of 2013, the weak
performance of the fertiliser and refined petroleum
product industry started weighing on export
performance.
Import growth has been fairly stable and is
expected to increase as private consumption and
investment strengthen. Overall, the contribution of
net exports to growth is expected to remain
negative over the forecast horizon. The current
account is expected to show a slight surplus in
2013, before reverting to a moderate deficit in
2014 and 2015.
Inflation set to remain below the long-term
average

HICP Inflation slowed to 1.2% in 2013, due to
exceptionally weak energy and food price
developments. This trend is forecast to continue in
early 2014 with a slight pick-up expected
thereafter. Inflation in the service sector is likely to
accelerate on the back of sustained wage growth,
while energy and food inflation are set to remain
below average levels. Overall, HICP is forecast to
grow by 1.1% in 2014 and 1.9% in 2015.
Financial sector – credit growth still subdued

Private sector deposits continued to grow in 2013,
but credit to households stayed flat while credit to
enterprises marginally contracted. Thus, despite

Member States, Lithuania

sufficient liquidity, banks remain cautious in their
lending. However, households and enterprises
were able to finance a large amount of investments
from their own resources.
Fiscal consolidation continues

In 2013, fiscal consolidation was supported by a
solid increase in direct taxes, in particular
corporate income tax, which compensated for a
shortfall in indirect taxes, while expenditure
growth at central government level was ultimately
contained. Fiscal results of local governments,
however, are expected to be weaker than a year
before. An improving situation in the labour
market led to a smaller-than-planned deficit of the
social insurance fund. Overall, the general
government deficit is set to reach 2.7% of GDP in
2013.
Going forward, the deficit is forecast to decrease to
2.3% of GDP in 2014 mainly because of limited
expenditure increase. Revenue losses from an
increase in non-taxable allowance are set to be

only partially compensated by an increase in
excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco products in
spring. For 2015, under a no-policy-change
assumption, the general government deficit is set
to reach 1.7% of GDP.
Following the judgement of the Lithuanian
constitutional court on the compensation of
pension and public wage cuts, the Lithuanian
government is expected to specify this spring when
and how it intends to compensate. Thus, there is a
risk that the general government deficit may turn
out higher than currently projected.
The structural deficit is estimated to have
decreased from 3% of GDP in 2012 to 2.5% in
2013, and to continue decreasing over the forecast
horizon, to 1.8% in 2015. General government
debt is estimated to have decreased slightly from
40.5% of GDP in 2012 to 39.5% in 2013. It is
projected to increase to 42.2% in 2014 due to the
pre-financing of a 2015 eurobond redemption
before falling back to 41.4% in 2015.

16. LUXEMBOURG
Robust growth above the euro-area average
Economic output is expected to continue growing significantly faster than the euro-area average. While
the potential growth of the financial sector could have been dented, its contribution should remain
positive. Job creation looks set to continue, albeit at a moderate pace. Windfall revenues from
e-commerce related activities are set to gradually fade out from 2015 onwards.
Growth is picking up

GDP in 2013 is projected to have grown by 2.1%,
significantly higher than the euro-area average.
After a disappointing performance at the beginning
of last year, economic activity rebounded strongly
in the second and third quarters, growing by 2.0%
and 0.2% q-o-q, respectively. In the last quarter of
2013 and in line with soft and hard indicators,
output is projected to have accelerated again,
signalling that the economy could have entered a
period of relatively sustained expansion. However,
the recovery is expected to be fragile and uneven
across sectors.

Private consumption, in the absence of new fiscal
consolidation measures, is expected to accelerate
somewhat to 2.3% in 2014 and 2.6% in 2015,
broadly in line with the increase in disposable
income. Still, consumption is hampered by
concerns about relatively weak labour market
developments, given that job creation is projected
to be just sufficient to stabilise the unemployment
rate.
With financial conditions remaining tight, coupled
with a historically low level of capacity utilisation
and still weak demand from the main trading
partners, firms are expected to postpone or freeze
their investment plans. Investment is expected to
be led by specific sectors, in particular purchases
from the aeronautic and satellite industry.
Exports are set to improve, on the back of better
prospects for external demand. The contribution to
growth from external trade is projected to remain
positive throughout the forecast horizon. However,
it is set to decline slightly in 2014, as imports are
projected to record a more robust growth, on the
back of buoyant internal demand.

Set for a gradual recovery

Overall, output is expected to grow by 2.2% in
2014 and 2.5% in 2015. The full impact of the new
financial rules should be visible by 2015 and,
although the potential of the financial sector to
expand is expected to be smaller than in the past, it
is still projected to remain a positive contributor to
growth. This, coupled with higher households'
confidence on the back of an improved labour
market, as well as stronger investment backed by
better euro-area growth prospects, is expected to
support
domestic
demand.
Moreover,
manufacturing output is expected to have bottomed
out in 2013, and a mild recovery is projected over
the forecast horizon.

78

Risks relate to the capacity of the financial
sector to further expand

Risks to the forecast mainly stem from the capacity
of the financial sector to adapt to the changing
business and regulatory environment. It will
determine, not only the prospects for this industry,
but, given the size of the sector, also the outlook
for the economy as a whole.
Lower inflation and moderate job creation

Headline inflation has been falling during 2013
and is estimated to have reached 1.7%. Increases in
administered prices partially offset less dynamic
oil prices. Inflation is expected to marginally abate
in 2014, to 1.5% before bouncing back slightly in
2015.
Job creation in 2013 weakened to 1.7%, due to
labour shedding in the construction and the

Member States, Luxembourg

industrial sectors. Employment creation is
projected to remain weak with a financial sector
undergoing
an
overhaul,
following
the
implementation of new regulations, which implies
labour adjustments. Employment growth is then
projected to stabilise in 2014 at 1.7%, and to
accelerate slightly in 2015 to 1.9%, mainly thanks
to better prospects in the financial sector. The
unemployment rate, after peaking at 6.0% in 2014,
is expected to drop to 5.9% in 2015.
Buoyant revenues have a temporary positive
effect on government deficit

The general government deficit is projected to
have reached 0.2% of GDP in 2013, down from
0.6% in 2012, mostly due to windfall revenues
coming from e-commerce VAT-related activities
and to a lesser extent from the implementation of
the fiscal measures contained in the budget.
Expenditure did not contribute much to the
improvement of the fiscal position, given that the
consolidation package adopted by the government
with the 2013 budget was not able to contain the
rapid growth of government consumption
expenditure.

In 2014, under the usual no-policy-change
assumption, i.e. that does not include the upcoming
budget, the deficit is expected to increase
marginally to 0.5% of GDP, mainly reflecting the
dynamic growth in social spending.
In 2015, the deficit is projected to increase
substantially to 2.4% of GDP, as VAT revenues
from e-commerce will start to fade away. The
initial budgetary impact of the drop in VAT
revenues is estimated at least at 1½% of GDP.
Under the afore-mentioned no-policy-change
assumption, the announced increase in general
VAT rates is not incorporated in this forecast, as
the measure is not yet sufficiently specified.
The surplus in the structural balance is expected to
stabilise in 2013, to fall by ¾ pp. in 2014 and to
turn into a deficit in 2015, following a drop by
more than 2 pps.
Government debt is projected to rise from around
24% of GDP in 2013 to slightly above 28% in
2015, as the surplus of the social security sector
cannot be used to finance the deficit of the central
government.

17. HUNGARY
A mild recovery, sustained by domestic demand
Hungary emerged from recession in 2013 with GDP growing by 1.1%. Growth is expected to accelerate
to around 2% in 2014 and 2015, primarily driven by domestic demand. Preliminary annual data
indicate a government deficit at around 2½% in 2013, but it is forecast to rebound to around 3% of
GDP this year and next.
Continued economic growth, partially boosted
by indirect fiscal stimuli

After re-entering into recession in 2012, with a
1.7% decline, Hungary experienced a real GDP
growth of 1.1% in 2013, partly reflecting the
correction of one-off adverse developments in
agriculture. In 2013 investment turned positive
mainly as a result of public investment, but
corporate investment also started to accelerate on
the back of the acceleration in the absorption of
EU funds and to some extent the central bank's
extended Funding for Growth Scheme (FGS,
providing subsidised lending to SMEs). A sharp
decline in inflation contributed to increasing
households' real disposable income, but the still
high unemployment and ongoing deleveraging
continued to put a drag on consumer spending.
Altogether domestic demand became the main
driver of growth in 2013.
Real GDP growth is expected to reach 2.1% both
in 2014 and 2015, driven by a further pick-up in
domestic demand, while net exports are projected
to provide a nil contribution. Yearly household
consumption is expected to return to positive
territory from 2014 due to further improvements in
real disposable income, partly linked to the
regulated price cuts and increasing public sector
wages, but also looser lending conditions as a
consequence of new subsidised mortgage schemes.
However, due to an oversupply in the market,
housing investment is forecast to recover only
modestly. Credit supply conditions to the corporate
sector will be only temporarily eased by the FGS
and together with a high absorption of EU funds,
will contribute to a pick-up in investment activity
as well as a slight growth in firms' net borrowing.

workers and the whitening of the economy
contributed to the improvement in the labour
market. (18) As the economy recovers, domestic
employment in the private sector is also expected
to pick up and the unemployment rate is projected
to fall further below 10% over the forecast period.
Inflation reached a historically low rate of 0.7% in
the last quarter of 2013 reflecting three successive
waves of cuts in regulated energy and other utility
prices. Underlying inflation has also been on a
downward trend, due to a negative output gap and
declining imported inflation. However, as the
output gap closes and the effect of utility price cuts
fades away, inflation is expected to increase
gradually towards the central bank's 3% target by
2015. The recent depreciation of the forint entails
some upward risk to the inflation projections.
Risks to the GDP forecast are overall tilted to the
downside. A tightening in global monetary
conditions may generate significant headwinds for
Hungary, most notably through the revaluation of
FX denominated debt. The main domestic risk is
related to the possible adoption of a new
comprehensive FX relief scheme with potential
negative effects on the banking sector and
investors' sentiment. As an upside risk, stimulus
measures could have a bigger-than-expected effect
on investment.
Government deficit expected to rebound to
3% of GDP

Cash-flow data for 2013 point to an
overachievement of the 2.7% of GDP deficit
target, with the general government deficit
expected to reach 2.4% of GDP, i.e. 0.5% lower
than in the autumn forecast. (19) The deficit-

Decreasing unemployment and low inflation

(18)

Despite a continuous increase in the participation
rate, unemployment dropped below 10% by the
fourth quarter of 2013, as Labour Force Survey
(LFS) based employment increased by 1.6% in
2013. The continuous expansion of the Public
Work Scheme, the increasing number of frontier

(19)

The effects of the latter two factors can be derived from the
difference between the LFS-based and GDP-consistent
employment figures, as the latter, which do not include
these effects, grew at a slower pace. The table below
provides the GDP-consistent employment figures.
It is assumed that the budgetary transfer of 0.45% of GDP
to the integration body of the savings cooperatives will be
recorded as a transfer within the government sector.
However, this is still subject to confirmation by Eurostat.

Member States, Hungary

decreasing developments include higher tax and
social security contribution proceeds (0.15% of
GDP), one-off revenue resulting from the shift of
the accounting method from public to total cost for
national co-payments for EU funds (0.1% of GDP)
as well as the end-year savings by budgetary
institutions and chapters (0.2% of GDP).

recovery and the assumed decline of public
investment linked to the electoral cycle will largely
be offset by the fall in one-off revenues from the
sale of telecommunication licenses.
Regarding risks, in 2013 the possibly higher local
government surplus could have further decreased
the deficit, but the increased arrears in accrual
terms could have had an opposite effect. For 2014
and beyond, the revenue effect of the change of
method for the calculation of the national cofinancing represents a positive risk, while a deficitincreasing effect could result from a further
slowdown in inflation as well as an increase in
sovereign yields.

The 2014 deficit is projected to reach 3.0% of
GDP, i.e. slightly above the target of 2.9% of
GDP. The better-than-expected budgetary outturn
in 2013 has only a limited base effect, which is
offset by additional spending measures, rising
interest outlays and the modest nominal private
consumption growth. Compared to the budgeted
figures, tax revenues are projected to be lower by
over 0.3% of GDP due to a lower-than-expected
inflation as well as a more cautious assessment of
measures aiming to enhance tax administration.
The forecast is based on the assumption that the
special reserve (0.3% of GDP) will not be spent.

After a moderate decrease of ¼ pp. in 2013, the
structural balance is forecast to deteriorate further
in 2014 by more than 1 pp. and to improve slightly
in 2015. The debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to have
decreased in 2013 by 2 pps. to 77.8% of GDP,
exclusively on account of the end-year reduction in
the state cash deposits. Thereafter, it is projected to
increase again due to the revaluation of the FX
component.

In 2015 the deficit is expected to decrease
somewhat to 2.9% of GDP. The effect of economic

18. MALTA
Private consumption to drive growth
Real GDP growth is estimated to have reached 2% in 2013 and projected to maintain the same pace in
2014-15. Domestic demand is seen becoming the main driver of growth, largely on the back of
recovering household consumption. The general government deficit is projected to stabilise below 3% of
GDP.
Economic growth is projected to remain stable

Real GDP growth was relatively strong in the first
three quarters of 2013, largely on the back of the
change in inventories component, which is used as
a residual item in national accounts. Gains in
household consumption were offset by a further
decline in investment activity, which is estimated
to have contracted for the third consecutive year.
Trade volumes surprised on the downside, but the
decline in exports was milder than that in imports
and thus external trade are seen to have had a
slightly positive contribution to growth. Real GDP
is estimated to have increased by 2% in 2013 as a
whole, up from a mild 0.9% growth in 2012.
Real GDP growth is projected to remain largely
unchanged, averaging 2.1% in 2014-15. Labour
market participation is set to remain on an upward
path, largely reflecting higher activity by women
and older workers. The job market is expected to
be able to fully absorb this inflow and the
unemployment rate is set to decline slightly.
Favourable labour market conditions and the
positive impact of the announced reduction of
electricity tariffs are projected to support a further
improvement in household consumption. With
capacity utilisation exceeding its long-term
average, investment is projected to improve. The
recovery, however, is set to be rather cautious in
an environment of low credit growth and higher
interest rates, compared to the euro area.
Improving domestic demand is expected to boost
import growth, but overall net exports are
projected to continue to contribute positively to
real GDP growth and the current account is
forecast to remain in surplus over the forecast
horizon.
Risks to the macroeconomic scenario are broadly
balanced. The forecast assumes a stabilisation of
the investment-to-GDP ratio and thus a
continuation of the downward trend observed in
recent years would present a downside risk. At the
same time, the structural reforms that the
government has committed to enact in the energy
sector could lower costs for the economy and boost

82

domestic demand, thus constituting an upside risk,
particularly in 2015. No significant change in
financing conditions is projected to occur over the
forecast period.
Price inflation gradually picks up

HICP inflation came in slightly below expectations
at 1% for the year as a whole in 2013, slowing
down from 3.2% in 2012. Deceleration came on
the back of lower prices of services offered in
restaurants and hotels. This explains why the local
measure of inflation, the Retail Price Index, which
puts less emphasis on tourist services, decelerated
less than HICP inflation. Energy prices also
declined slightly, in line with developments on
international markets.
In 2014, the reduction in electricity tariffs is
projected to offset a rebound in services inflation
and keep overall price inflation at a relatively
moderate by Malta's historical standards 1.2%.
With the output gap estimated to have closed in
2014, the HICP is forecast to accelerate further to
1.9% in 2015, above the euro-area average.
Budget deficit to stabilise

From 3.3% of GDP in 2012, the budget deficit is
expected to decrease to 3.0% of GDP in 2013.
Current primary expenditure relative to GDP is
forecast to increase by 0.5 pp. despite the spending
review at ministry level that started in July 2013.
On the capital side, net expenditure, including the
planned additional equity injection into Air Malta
(0.6% of GDP), is expected to stabilise. Indirect
taxes relative to GDP are projected to increase by
0.3 pp., driven also by the recovery in
consumption in the second half of the year.
Corporate profitability as well as a favourable
labour market outlook is expected to drive income
taxes, despite measures to gradually reduce the
overall income tax levels.
The 2014 budget includes mostly revenueincreasing measures, among which increases in
indirect taxation (mainly excise duties), a new

Member States, Malta

programme to grant Maltese citizenship to foreign
individuals and families (against the payment of a
fee and investments in the country) and the
introduction of a new tax regime for rental income.
On the expenditure side, the budget envisages
some restrictions on recruitment. Overall, the
current revenue ratio is projected to increase by 0.2
pp. of GDP, while primary current expenditure is
forecast to stabilise. The deficit is expected to
narrow to 2.7% of GDP. In 2015, on a no-policychange assumption, the deficit is projected to
remain at 2.7% of GDP.

Downside risks relate to the financial situation of
Enemalta (the public energy utility corporation) as
well as higher than budgeted disbursement related
to the car VAT refund scheme.

After having worsened by ½ pp. of GDP in 2012,
the structural deficit is estimated to have improved
by 0.7 pp. of GDP in 2013, despite the limited size
of the consolidation measures. Thereafter, the
structural deficit is projected to improve slightly
by 0.2 pp. of GDP in 2014 before deteriorating by
0.3 pp. of GDP in 2015. The debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to reach 72.4% in 2014 and decrease to
71.5% in 2015, following the due repayment of
part of a loan from Air Malta.

19. THE NETHERLANDS
Economic recovery takes shape after two years of recession
Economic growth turned positive in the second quarter of 2013 and is projected to gain momentum in
2014 and 2015. Driven mainly by investments in 2014, growth will accelerate in 2015 thanks to rising
household consumption. Unemployment is set to level off before slowly decreasing at the end of the
forecast horizon. The budget deficit of the government will remain close to 3% of GDP.
2013: the economy turning

In 2013, real GDP contracted by 0.8% due to weak
economic activity in the beginning of the year and
the negative impact of contraction in 2012. The
quarter-on-quarter economic growth turned
positive in the second and third quarters and
strengthened significantly in the fourth quarter.
Growth of 0.7% was partly driven by exceptional
factors, such as high investment in vehicles in
anticipation of a change in taxation as of this year.
In 2014, quarterly growth is projected to remain in
positive territory, albeit with modest quarterly
increases. Real GDP growth is forecast to reach
1.0% in 2014.

The forecast improvement of the economic
situation in the euro area provides a boost to Dutch
exports, which are expected to grow by 2.9% in
2014 compared to 1.3% in 2013. Imports would
pick up in line with final demand. Net exports are
expected to show a higher contribution to
economic growth in 2015.

The fragile transition towards positive growth in
2013 was chiefly supported by net exports. By
contrast, domestic demand remained a drag on
activity, despite gross fixed capital formation
rebounding in line with an improved business
outlook, and is projected to remain sluggish in
2014. Private consumption will be still held back
by the unfavourable development of employment
and the incurred negative wealth effects over the
past years. However, from the second half of 2013,
onwards, soft indicators, including consumer
confidence, have shown an almost continuous
improvement, which support an improved
economic outlook. In 2014 domestic demand is
expected to gradually move towards positive
territory and to overtake net exports as the main
growth driver. In particular, investments are
picking up, especially in the private sector.

Risks to the macroeconomic scenario stemming
from domestic developments are predominantly on
the downside. Higher than expected uncertainties
on the policy side regarding the implementation
and effects of foreseen measures, in particular
related to health care and the labour market, may
hamper the expected recovery of domestic
demand. However, a faster stabilisation of the
housing market could provide an additional boost.
Initially rising unemployment, subdued inflation

Private consumption is forecast to continue
shrinking, but at a rate of 0.5% the decline is much
lower than in the past three years. Private
consumption is projected to bottom out towards
the end of 2014, reflecting the positive effects
stemming from a gradually recovering housing
market as well as from lower taxes on labour and
lower pension and health care premiums.
Following several years of negative developments,
real disposable income is expected to modestly
increase.

84

Unemployment rose sharply in the beginning of
2013 as a result of declining employment coupled
with an increase in labour supply ("added worker
effect"). Since mid-2013, the unemployment rate
has been relatively stable but mainly due to a
supply effect, as unemployed massively retreated
from the labour market in response to negative
prospects for an economic recovery ("discouraged
worker effect"). The unemployment rate reached
6.7% in 2013. In view of the lagged response of
the labour market to the cycle, the employment

Member States, The Netherlands

outlook
remains
fairly
negative.
The
unemployment rate is forecast to increase in 2014
to 7.4%, mainly as a result of negative
employment developments in the government and
health care sectors. The unemployment rate is
projected to only ease slightly in 2015, to 7.2%.
In 2012 and most of 2013, HICP inflation stood
close to 3%, notably due to higher energy prices
and the increased VAT rate as of October 2012. In
October 2013, inflation fell markedly to 1.3% as
the previous energy and tax increases dropped out
of the figures. In line with the slow pickup in
domestic demand over the forecast horizon,
inflation is expected to ease further to 1.1% in
2014 before increasing slightly to 1.3% in 2015.
Deficit just below 3% of GDP in 2015

In 2014, the general government deficit is expected
to rise slightly to 3.2% of GDP, from 3.1% in
2013. This rise masks ongoing fiscal tightening, as
the 2013 headline deficit figures benefited from
positive one-offs (notably the sale of 4G telecom
licenses). Despite an additional consolidation

package of around 1% of GDP, the 2014 general
government deficit would slightly worsen in
nominal terms, reflecting sluggish economic
activity and the non-recurrence of temporary fiscal
measures impacting 2013. In addition, the decision
to lower natural gas production in the coming
years is expected to have a limited deficitincreasing impact of about 0.1% of GDP in both
2014 and 2015. On the back of ongoing
consolidation
efforts
and
the
expected
improvement in economic activity, the headline
deficit is forecast to decline to 2.9% of GDP in
2015. Following an improvement of 0.9% of GDP
in 2013, the structural balance is expected to
stabilise in 2014 and 2015. The gross government
debt ratio is expected to increase from 74.3% of
GDP in 2013 to around 75.6% of GDP in 2015.
Risks to the fiscal forecast mirror uncertainties on
the macroeconomic outlook. However, there are
also risks for the expected revenue from some of
the fiscal measures in 2014 (notably the temporary
tax reduction on accrued severance payments) and
planned expenditure savings in 2015.

20. AUSTRIA
Timid recovery expected to gain traction
The second half of 2013 saw domestic demand growth resume. While signs of a sustained broad-based
recovery are currently still scarce favourable financing conditions, an improving external environment
and a stable labour market are expected to boost investment and consumption growth in the course of
2014-15. One-off measures are the main drivers of the reduction in the budget deficit in 2013, while
permanent measures have been taken to limit the deficit increase in 2014.
Domestic demand momentum is still low...

The Austrian economy decelerated further in 2013.
Investment growth turned negative, private
consumption stagnated. Net exports turned out
slightly better than the year before and helped
avoid a recession.
Signs of a recovery are still difficult to detect in
the data available at the start of 2014. On the
whole, business and consumer sentiment have
been trending up, albeit somewhat inconsistently.
Manufacturing orders have been recovering
throughout last year, but order-book levels remain
thin. Capacity utilisation is still on a subsiding
trend.

…but brightening sentiment is expected to start
bearing fruit

The projections for the following two years
assume a consolidation of business and consumer
confidence. For 2014 and 2015, growth is
projected to regain some momentum and reach or
exceed 1.5%, driven by a strengthening of
domestic demand. Net exports are expected to
contribute positively to growth on the back of
higher export growth, but to a smaller extent than
domestic demand due to a rebound in imports.

86

In the environment of the perceived uncertainty,
slowing foreign and stagnating domestic demand
that characterised 2012 and 2013, corporations
have been revising investment plans downwards.
However, low interest rates and solid corporate
liquidity are expected to reassure companies in
carrying out needed replacements and extensions
of capacity. Credit growth is expected to remain
subdued though, both on account of weak demand
and deleveraging needs in the banking system.
The exporting sectors are forecast to benefit from
progressively
improving
external
demand
conditions over the forecast horizon. Capitalising
on non-cost competitiveness factors, exports of
services have experienced an increase in market
shares in 2013. Manufacturing productivity has
been dented but wage growth has stayed moderate.
Unit labour costs have thus increased in line with
those of trading partners, leaving cost
competitiveness seemingly unimpaired. All in all,
the external balance is projected to stay positive
and to provide a positive contribution to growth.
Dynamics of prices and wages to remain
stable

Employment growth eased in 2013 reflecting
stagnating output, but is expected to strengthen
somewhat in 2014-15 as businesses do not indicate
intentions to shed labour. However, the increase in
the labour force will likely preclude a sizeable
decline in the unemployment rate in the coming
years.
Nominal wage growth hardly exceeded inflation in
the latest quarters. The wage settlements
applicable for the coming years are more
moderate. However, with inflation easing over the
forecast horizon and employment strengthening,
real wage growth is projected to support
consumption growth.
Consumer price inflation eased to 2.1% in 2013
due to slowing food and energy prices. Energy
prices deflation is expected to help keep inflation

Member States, Austria

below 2% in 2014-15. Core inflation is also
expected to decelerate marginally thanks to
moderate wage and domestic demand growth.
Upward trend in government deficit partially
contained

A sizeable one-off (0.7% of GDP) arising from the
sale of phone licences is the main driver of the
better-than expected deficit outcome, forecast to
reduce to 1.7% of GDP in 2013. This income
coupled with the revenue from the tax agreement
with Switzerland (0.3% of GDP), also recorded as
positive one-off, has more than offset the negative
impact of the support to the banking sector (0.6%
of GDP). On the other hand low output growth
spurred the deficit in 2013.
The government deficit is expected to increase to
2.1% in 2014 due to additional support required by
Hypo Group (0.3% of GDP) and to stronger trend
growth of pensions and unemployment
expenditure coupled with weaker growth in tax
revenues.. In January the new government adopted
a tax-package submitted to Parliament's approval

which is expected to raise revenue by about 0.2%
of GDP in 2014 and 0.3% in 2015. The main
measures involve closing loopholes in group
taxation, reducing deductibility in income taxes
and increasing some indirect taxes such as taxes on
products and car registration tax. The effect of
higher expenditure growth and lower trend in
revenue will continue to have an impact in 2015
although the deficit is expected to decline to 1.8%
of GDP.
The structural deficit is projected at 1.5% in 2013,
and expected to remain broadly stable in the
forecast horizon. The general government debt is
expected to increase in 2013 reaching 74.6% of
GDP in 2013, while it is projected to start
decreasing in 2014 and further in 2015.
This forecast does not include any estimate
regarding the cost stemming from the wind-down
of the Hypo Group, which could entail an increase
in the stock of government debt. The impact of any
resolution model on the government deficit is still
uncertain and it represents the main downside risk
affecting current deficit projections.

21. POLAND
Regaining economic momentum
After a marked slowdown in 2012-13, economic activity in Poland picked up at the end of last year as
external demand and economic sentiment improved. Domestic demand is expected to overtake net
exports as the main engine of economic growth, as unemployment falls and inflation remains contained.
The fiscal outlook is set to improve gradually.
Domestic demand rebounds at last

In the last three months of 2013, real GDP
increased by 2.2% y-o-y, up from 0.8% in the first
quarter. In 2013 as a whole the economy expanded
by 1.6% in real terms. The rebound of aggregate
economic activity was supported by robust export
growth on the back of geographical reorientation
towards dynamic markets and high costcompetitiveness, while sluggish domestic demand
contained import growth. Private consumption was
held back by weak, albeit recovering consumer
confidence and a relatively high rate of
unemployment. Improving external demand led to
a pick-up in industrial output and fuelled corporate
investments, offsetting the slowdown in public
investment spending.
Recovery gathers steam in 2014 and 2015

The improving economic outlook in the main
trading partners and the resulting pick-up in Polish
exports are set to invigorate private investment and
the labour market, which in turn is expected to
support the recovery of private consumption. Real
GDP growth is forecast to accelerate to 2.9% in
2014 and to 3.1% in 2015, slightly above current
estimates of potential output growth.
Private investment is set to remain buoyant over
the forecast horizon, alongside the projected
recovery of global demand and private
consumption and on account of an already high
rate of capacity utilisation in the manufacturing
industry. Cash accumulated by non-financial
companies and a gradual increase in credit supply
is expected to provide the necessary financing.
Against the background of recovering economic
activity
and
growing
employment,
the
unemployment rate is forecast to fall from 10.4%
in 2013 to 10.1% in 2015. Coupled with contained
inflationary pressures, this improvement is likely
to bolster real disposable income growth.
However, the saving rate of private households is
set to increase (net of the impact of the reversal of

88

the systemic pension reform), as consumers are
expected to gradually increase their savings.
Overall, the annual contribution of net exports to
real GDP growth is forecast is expected to be
significant in 2014, when domestic demand is still
recovering, and to turn neutral in 2015. Against
this backdrop, the current-account deficit is set to
remain below 2% of GDP.

The risks to the forecast are broadly balanced. On
the upside, a stronger depreciation of the złoty
would further boost exports and enhance import
substitution. On the downside, higher inflation
might dent real disposable incomes and slow down
private consumption growth.
Supply side factors curb inflation

Falling energy prices, subdued food prices, and
weak domestic demand drove average HICP
inflation down to 0.8% in 2013. A moderate pickis expected in 2014 and 2015, to 1.4% and 2%
respectively, inter alia reflecting base effects in
2014 and moderate improvement in domestic
demand.

reform, the main measures with a positive (and
permanent) effect on general government balance
in 2014 include increases in excise duties, a partial
public wage freeze and a gradual increase in the
retirement age. The expenditure savings will be
partially offset by the costs of a legislated
extension of maternity leave. In 2015, due to the
one-off nature of the large improvement in 2014,
the general government budget balance is expected
to return into the red, posting a deficit of 2.9% of
GDP under ESA95. Excluding regular asset
transfers linked to the reversal of the pension
reform, the deficit is projected to reach 3.5% of
GDP in 2015. The structural deficit is estimated to
gradually improve over the forecast horizon, from
3.6% of GDP in 2013 to 2.4% of GDP in 2015.

Underlying fiscal outlook to improve gradually

In 2013, the deficit is forecast to have increased to
4.4% of GDP, up from 3.9% of GDP in 2012,
mainly due to a weak performance of indirect and
direct tax revenues.
Over the forecast horizon, the profile of the
general government budget balance will be
affected by the reversal of the systemic pension
reform. It includes the following asset transfers
from the second pension pillar: a one-off transfer
of assets worth 8.5% of GDP in 2014 as well as
gradual, annual transfers of assets of persons who
retire within 10 years, starting in 2014. Under the
current accounting rules (ESA95), such asset
transfers are treated as general government
revenue. Under the new rules that will come into
force this autumn (ESA2010), such transfers will
not count as revenue anymore.

The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is
forecast to fall from 57.8% in 2012 to 50.3% in
2014, mainly as a result of the transfer of pension
fund assets, before increasing again to 51% in
2015. The projected debt figures are, however,
subject to considerable uncertainty in view of
possible valuation effects of the sovereign debt
denominated in foreign currency via exchange rate
fluctuations.

In 2014 the general government budget balance is
projected to turn into a surplus of 5% of GDP
under ESA95, while it is set to post a deficit of
3.8% with these asset transfers not treated as
revenue. Apart from the reversal of the pension

22. PORTUGAL
Gradual economic recovery
The economy seems to have turned the corner in the second half of 2013, showing positive growth rates
for real GDP and employment. These positive trends are expected to continue in 2014 and 2015, along
with external rebalancing. Portugal's recovery remains vulnerable to external risks and its high level of
private sector indebtedness.
Note: This forecast was finalised at midDecember after the tenth review of the
Economic Adjustment Programme, and will be
revisited during the eleventh review. The text
reflects recent developments.
Economic recovery gaining momentum

Following a strong 1.1% q-o-q expansion in the
second quarter, real GDP increased by 0.2% q-o-q
in the third quarter of 2013, when a negative
growth contribution of net exports was more than
offset by solid growth of domestic demand, in
particular private consumption and gross fixed
investment. Economic indicators for the last
quarter of 2013 are consistent with a further
stabilisation of the economic recovery towards the
end of last year. As a consequence, the forecast for
real GDP growth in 2013 was revised upwards
since the autumn forecast by 0.2 pp. to -1.6%. The
projection for the outer years remains broadly
unchanged, with real GDP growth rates of 0.8% in
2014 and 1.5% in 2015.

Unemployment Rate

Labour market situation stabilised in 2013

Total employment expanded by 0.2% q-o-q in the
fourth quarter of 2013. Much of this increase was
in permanent job contracts, suggesting that the
employment gain was not primarily a seasonal
phenomenon. Total employment is therefore
expected to expand further at a moderate pace.

90

However, the annual average employment growth
is projected to be still negative in 2014 due to a
sizeable negative carry-over effect. With a rate of
½% employment growth in 2015 is not expected to
bring down the relatively high rate of
unemployment, which is expected to stay above
16% in the forecast period.
Weak inflationary pressure

HICP inflation declined to 0.4% in 2013, its lowest
rate since 2009, reflecting subdued domestic
demand and wage restraint in the private sector.
Sizeable spare capacities and the expected sluggish
economic recovery in the coming years should
exert downward pressure on profit margins.
Consumer prices are therefore projected to
accelerate only slightly to just above 1% in 2015.
Current account turning into surplus

The current-account balance is estimated to have
become positive in 2013, at around 0.5% of GDP.
A strong export performance should continue to
support the external adjustment towards the
tradable sector in the forecast period. A projected
further improvement in the external balance is set
to exceed the deterioration of the primary income
balance, contributing to a widening currentaccount surplus over the forecast period.
Risks to the economic outlook remain on the
downside

While the baseline projection implies that the
recovery is gradually becoming more entrenched,
the pace of the recovery remains conditional on
developments in the euro area and, in particular, in
Portugal’s main trading partners. Downside risks
relate to the high levels of private sector
indebtedness, which could drag on consumption
and investment activity. Portugal remains also
vulnerable to a significant deterioration in the
financial market sentiment, linked either to
uncertainties regarding policy implementation by
the Portuguese authorities or a weaker than
expected external environment.

Fiscal outlook

The tenth review of the Portuguese adjustment
programme forecast a general government deficit
of 5.5% of GDP in 2013 (excluding bank
recapitalisation costs, 5.9% including them). On
the back of the latest outturn data, an overperformance and some positive carry-over into
2014 cannot be excluded. Budget execution was
supported by robust tax-revenue collection, which
more than compensated expenditure growth and
shortfalls on non-tax revenues during the year.
The 2014 Budget and other supporting legislation
include discretionary measures worth 2.3% of
GDP which are expected to bring the headline
deficit down to 4% of GDP. The measures are
mostly permanent and expenditure reducing, aimed
mainly at the reduction of the public sector wage
bill, reforms of the public pension systems and
expenditure cuts across line ministries. The
remaining effort is expected to be achieved
through smaller-scale measures worth 0.5% of
GDP, including some one-off operations. The
forecast is also underpinned by the measures that
the Government has taken to replace the provision
of the pension reform ruled unconstitutional in

December 2013, worth about 0.2% of GDP. In
2015 the fiscal balance is expected to reach -2.5%
of GDP in 2015. The forecast is based on the
assumption of discretionary measures worth about
1.2% of GDP which the Government plans to
specify in the context of the Reform of the State.
These projections are consistent with a cumulated
improvement in the structural balance of 2.5% of
GDP over 2013-15.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to peak at
nearly 129½% in 2013 and to decline thereafter.
The upward revision vis-à-vis the autumn forecast
is mostly explained by a substantial increase in the
Treasury's cash balance at the end of the year.
Downside risks to the fiscal projection are mostly
of legal nature as key elements of the 2014 budget
have been submitted to the Constitutional Court
for review. In addition, implementation risks
remain elevated in light of the ambitious reform
package. On the other hand, a tax-richer
environment might boost revenue collection
beyond the budgeted levels. The fiscal outlook will
be revisited at the eleventh programme review.

23. ROMANIA
Export-led rebound turning into a more broad-based recovery
In 2013, strong growth of 3.5% was driven by exports and an abundant harvest. A gradual rebalancing
of growth towards domestic demand is expected in 2014 and 2015 with real GDP growth forecast to be
above 2%. Annual average inflation is projected to decelerate to 2.4% in 2014 while unemployment is
expected to decrease only in 2015. The fiscal adjustment is forecast to continue.
Stable outlook for growth and exports

Real GDP growth in 2013 has come out at 3.5%
thanks to a strong export performance driven by a
robust industrial output and an abundant harvest.
Growth is forecast to decelerate in 2014, to 2.3%,
before slightly recovering to 2.5% in 2015. It is
projected to remain above potential over the
forecast horizon, reflecting improved confidence
and more supportive international conditions but
also the payoff of product and labour market
reforms implemented under the financial support
programmes. Growth drivers are expected to
gradually switch from (net) exports to domestic
demand over the forecast horizon.
Rebalancing of growth towards investment...

Investment is projected to regain momentum,
supported by better absorption of EU funds(20) as
major infrastructure projects gain traction. Credit
growth stayed in negative territory in 2013. It is
expected to remain constrained by households'
ongoing needs to repair their balance sheets and by
the deleveraging process of the banking sector
after a long period of deteriorating asset quality.

Private consumption is projected to pick up
moderately, on the back of improving consumer
confidence and increasing disposable income as
employment grows and real wages are expected to
increase by up to 3% in 2014.
…support a gradual pick up in imports

The growth contribution of net exports is forecast
to fade out in 2014 and turn negative in 2015.
Imports are projected to pick up over the forecast
horizon, alongside domestic demand, slightly
outpacing export growth in 2015. Nonetheless, the
external environment is expected to improve and
to support continued, albeit slower, export growth.
This follows a strong trade balance adjustment of
4.1% of GDP in 2013, on account of both strong
exports and subdued imports.
Historically low inflation expected in the first
half of 2014

HICP inflation sharply declined in the second half
of 2013 to reach 1.3% (y-o-y) in December. This
can be ascribed to a very good harvest, a reduction
in VAT on flour and bakery products (applied in
September 2013), and lower inflation expectations.
Annual average inflation is projected to decelerate
from 3.2% in 2013 to 2.4% in 2014 mainly due to
falling food prices leading to historical lows in the
first half of 2014. It is expected to return to the
upper part of the central bank's target band
(2.5%±1pp.) in the second half of the year. In
2015, a gradual recovery in domestic demand and
continued price convergence towards the EU
average are expected to translate into higher
inflation, averaging 3.4%.

down slightly in 2015 when policy measures,
especially those targeted at youth unemployment,
would start showing effects. While the number of
employment contracts marginally increased in
2013, the number of self-employed fell, leaving
overall employment broadly unchanged in 2013.
Given the expected slowdown in GDP growth in
2014, employment is projected to grow only
slowly. Compensation per employee has grown
moderately in 2013 driven by public sector wage
increases. The trend is projected to be reversed in
2014 with private sector compensation growth
overtaking the public sector. The increase in the

reflecting higher co-financing expenditure for EU
funds. The projection includes the indexation of
pensions foreseen by law, a two-step increase in
the minimum wage from 800 to 900 RON and
another limited and targeted raise in public sector
salaries. On the revenue side, the forecast takes
into account the inflation indexation of excise
duties, the excise rate hike for energy products,
and the broadening of the basis for property tax.
For 2015, benefiting from the expected
acceleration in economic activity and based on the
customary no-policy-change assumption, the
deficit is projected to decrease further, to 1.8% of
GDP. The structural budget balance is expected to
mildly improve over the forecast horizon by about
0.5% of GDP. Government debt is forecast to peak
at just above 39% of GDP in 2014.

Fiscal adjustment to continue

The budget deficit in Romania is estimated to have
been reduced to 2.6% of GDP in 2013, from 3% in
2012. It is slightly higher than previously
projected, as it accommodates higher co-financing
expenditure to support EU funds' absorption.

The main risks to the budget relate to: (i) less taxrich growth associated with weak domestic
demand; (ii) reduced expenditure control; and
(iii) limited progress with restructuring stateowned enterprises that could result in renewed
pressure on the budget.

For 2014, the budget deficit is forecast at 2.2% of
GDP, higher than previously projected, again

24. SLOVENIA
Easing market tensions but deleveraging still ongoing
Positive quarterly outturns in 2013 have reduced the pace of the recession. A fragile recovery is
expected to start in the second half of 2014 supported by improving market conditions. Lending to the
private sector remains restrained by the ongoing deleveraging in both financial and non-financial
corporations. With subdued private consumption, the external side is expected to be the key driver of the
recovery. The support to banks provided in 2013 largely explains the temporary surge in the deficit.
Gradual export-led recovery ahead

Despite the strong negative carry-over from the
previous year, better-than-expected quarterly
outturns in 2013 have eased the pace of real GDP
contraction, from 2.5% in 2012 to an expected
1.6% in 2013. The growth outlook for 2014 and
2015 is revised upwards to -0.1% and 1.3%
respectively, as export growth picks up while
domestic demand is still dampened by the ongoing
deleveraging process. The ensuing increasing
current-account surplus is thus partly cyclical and
driven by the ongoing rebalancing of the economy.

constrained while balance sheets of domestic
banks are still being repaired. In addition, low
profit expectations and further corporate
restructuring needs continue to soften credit
demand. A fragile recovery in investment is
expected to start only in the second half of 2014,
driven by the need to rebuild production capacity.
Positive data in the first three quarters of 2013
prompted an upward revision of the export
forecast, not matched by equivalent import growth.
The external side is expected to continue to sustain
the recovery, though with a somewhat muted
contribution in 2015 linked to the gradual pick-up
in domestic demand.
Risks to the growth forecast are tilted to the
upside, related to easing financing conditions and
accelerating investment, which in turn hinge upon
the speed of the required restructuring and timely
implementation of the announced privatisations.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Consumer confidence worsened again in the last
quarter of 2013, with retail sales continuing to fall
year-on-year. Private consumption retains a very
negative outlook for 2014, due to expectations of
further declines in employment and wages, and is
projected to only stabilise in 2015.
Although investment in 2013 was supported by
one-offs and EU-funded local projects, the trend
for the year as a whole remained negative,
mirroring the ongoing deleveraging. Financial
market tensions eased at year-end, following the
completion of the bank asset quality review and
stress test, and the recapitalisations of the two
largest state-owned banks. Financing conditions
for corporates are nevertheless expected to remain

94

The lagged adjustment in the labour market is
expected to continue in 2014-15 with wages
projected to remain subdued in 2014 and rise
moderately in 2015. Public sector wages are
temporarily affected by a court ruling which
repealed the postponement of an increase due in
2010, accounted for in 2013 but effective in 201415. The profile of deflators for GDP and
government consumption over 2013-14 is also
affected by these wage arrears. Both HICP and
core inflation are set to continue declining until the
end of 2014, also reflecting the fading out of the
July 2013 increase in VAT rates, and pick up
steadily over 2015.
Bank support weighs on government finances

The general government deficit is estimated to
increase from 3.8% in 2012 to 14.9% of GDP in
2013 (3.7% without the impact of one-off
measures, mostly to recapitalise banks). The
positive budgetary impact of the higher VAT rates,

Member States, Slovenia

cuts to public wages and social benefits, adopted in
2013, are estimated to have been largely offset by
higher interest and pension expenditure. The ruling
on the public wage repeal and the new law
providing for the compensation of persons
removed from the register of residents after
independence, added 0.9 pp. of GDP to the one-off
deficit-increasing measures.

20

For 2014, the recapitalisation of the third-largest
state owned bank, Abanka, which is subject to
state aid approval, is set to add 0.7pp. of GDP to
the underlying deficit of 3.3%. The real estate tax
introduced on 1 January 2014 and the temporary
de-indexation of personal income tax allowances
and tax brackets are set to increase the tax burden.
Without new budgetary measures, i.e. under the
no-policy-change assumption, the deficit would
stand at 3.3% of GDP in 2015.

Graph II.24.2: Slovenia - Determinants of debt

However, the structural balance is estimated to
improve by only around 2/3 pp. over 2013-14, to
-2% of GDP, then based on existing policies will
revert to -2.5% of GDP in 2015. Public debt is set
to have increased to 71.9% of GDP in 2013, from
54.4% in 2012, reflecting bank recapitalisations
and the transfer of non-performing loans to the
Bank Asset Management Company in December
2013 as well as negative output growth. The debt
is forecast to increase to 78% in 2015, mainly due
to primary deficits, including a further announced
bank recapitalisation, subdued growth and higher
debt servicing costs. The forecast does not include
receipts from privatisations and the planned
auction of network frequencies.

25. SLOVAKIA
Growth to pick up in 2014
The Slovak economy slowed down in 2013 but growth is expected to gather pace reaching 2.3% in 2014
and 3.2% in 2015. The composition of growth will become more balanced as the main driving force
shifts from net exports to domestic demand. Employment will grow only modestly over the forecast
horizon and inflation will remain low.
Gradual recovery expected in 2014…

After robust growth in 2012, the Slovak economy
slowed down in 2013, with real GDP increasing by
0.8%. Domestic demand continued to act as a drag
on growth, mainly due to still falling investment
and stagnating private consumption. Net exports
continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace, and
remained the main contributor to the overall
positive growth rate. Over the forecast horizon,
domestic demand is expected to recover and play a
leading role in generating growth that is projected
to accelerate to 2.3% in 2014 and 3.2% in 2015.
The unemployment rate will stay above 13%.

…as domestic demand becomes the main
driver of growth

Following a strong rise in the second quarter of
2013, in the third quarter household consumption
fell by 0.4% q-o-q. As a consequence, private
consumption is expected to decline slightly for the
year as a whole. Nevertheless, consumer
confidence has steadily improved over the second
half of 2013, reflecting a marked improvement in
households' expectations about the future, and is
now above its long-run average. Given the likely
rise in real disposable income due to lower-thanexpected inflation and some improvements on the
labour market, private consumption is set to
increase gradually in 2014 and 2015.

96

Investment collapsed at the beginning of 2013 and
remained weak for the first three quarters of the
year. Despite an expansion in equipment in the
automotive industry in the fourth quarter,
investment continued to decrease over the year as a
whole. The credit outlook for firms remains poor,
as the net flow of loans to non-financial
corporations was negative in 2013. While a
positive impulse is foreseen from motorway
construction, investment is projected to stagnate in
2014 and a more substantial pickup is only
expected in 2015.
Very strong export growth in the second quarter of
2013 led to a correction in the third quarter as
exports declined. Nevertheless, exports of both
goods and services are projected to have increased
in the last quarter of 2013. Export growth in 2014
and 2015 will be boosted by declining export
prices and improving demand in Slovakia's main
trading partners. Imports are expected to increase
in line with exports and, for 2014 and 2015, net
exports are likely to give way to domestic demand
as the main driver of growth.
The country-specific risks to the forecast are
balanced. Downside risks could come from
possible delays in the implementation of large
infrastructure projects. Residential construction
poses upside risks as residential property prices
seem to have bottomed out in 2013 and loans to
households have been growing at a robust rate.
Inflation decreases in 2014

Inflation decreased significantly in the second half
of 2013, mainly due to the continued fall in energy
prices, while pressures in the prices of foodstuff,
especially unprocessed food, abated. Given
declining commodity prices, the envisaged
reduction of regulated energy prices for
households and weak demand-pull pressures,
inflation as measured by the HICP is projected to
be only 0.7% in 2014. For 2015, given the foreseen
recovery in domestic demand, inflation is expected
to increase to 1.6%.

Member States, Slovakia

sector have not been sufficiently specified. In
addition, major savings from the reform of the
public administration (ESO) are subject to
implementation risks. Therefore, the savings
projected by the government are not taken on
board in full in 2014.

Public finances at a critical juncture

The general government deficit in 2013 is
estimated to have reached 2.5% of GDP. Higherthan-budgeted VAT collection together with
lower-than-budgeted public investment is expected
to have contributed to this result. Moreover, a payout of dividends originally planned for 2014 took
place already in 2013. The deficit outcome may be
affected by the classification, currently under
examination by Eurostat, of the government's sale
of emergency oil reserves in national accounts.

Overall, also due to the fact that the impact of oneoff measures in 2014 is lower than initially
envisaged and lower than in 2013, on current
policies the headline deficit is expected to increase
again to 3.3% of GDP in 2014.

The pick-up in household consumption and
improved collection of VAT as a result of the
measures to fight tax fraud, are projected to
support tax revenues in 2014. The net effect of the
introduction of a minimum lump-sum payment for
the corporate income tax and the parallel reduction
in the corporate income tax rate by 1 pp. is
projected to be marginally positive. Moreover, the
special levy on high-profit companies operating in
a regulated environment, originally envisaged to
expire in 2013, was retained. The sale of telecom
licenses will be an additional (one-off) revenue
source. On the expenditure side, measures to
achieve envisaged large savings in the healthcare

A slight deterioration in the headline deficit is
projected 2015 as the growth in tax revenue
supported by faster economic activity will not
compensate for the expiry of the one-off revenues
of 2014 and for the planned reduction in the VAT
rate by 1 pp. (conditional upon the deficit outcome
in 2013). While the structural balance improved in
2013, it is set to slightly worsen afterwards.
The general government debt is estimated to rise
above 58% of GDP by the end of the forecast
horizon, assuming that the planned sale of
government's shares in the telecom sector in 2015
will be used for debt reduction.

26. FINLAND
Nascent recovery with consolidation needs ahead
Amid the ongoing restructuring of the economy, consumers remain cautious and investment is only
gradually gaining strength. The expected tepid recovery in 2014-15 is largely dependent on
developments in export markets. Disposable income grows slowly, holding back consumption. General
government deficit remains above 2% over the forecast horizon and the debt ratio is set to exceed 60%.
Broad-based recession in 2012/13

In 2013 Finland's economy was in recession for
the second year. Real GDP dropped by -1.5% after
having decreased by -1% in 2012. The GDP
decline was broad-based, affecting consumer
spending, exports and particularly investments.
Net external demand contributed positively to
growth due to the strong decline in imports. This
partly offset the negative contribution related to
the strong decline in domestic demand.
Unemployment continued to climb gradually,
ending the year at 8.4%, back to the level last
recorded in 2010 when the economy was just
recovering from the 2009 crises.

market shares. Also the moderate wage agreement
is a first step in restoring cost competiveness. In
turn, weak domestic demand limits imports,
resulting in a positive growth contribution from net
exports. Consequently, the current-account balance
is expected to continue improving, reaching
positive territory in 2014.

Gradual improvement ahead

Although towards the end of 2013 economic
sentiment started improving, the economic activity
declined again in the final quarter. Signals given
by leading indicators still do not point to a
recovery in domestic demand in the near future.
An improving economic outlook for Finland's
main export markets, with the notable exception of
Russia, portends an export-driven recovery in
2014. Still, growth is projected to remain tepid
and, influenced by negative growth momentum
over the course of 2013, to reach 0.2% for the year
as a whole, before accelerating to 1.3% in 2015.
Moderate

growth
and

unemployment are weighing on disposable
income, limiting the growth of private
consumption. Gross fixed capital formation is
forecast to pick up only gradually as equipment
investment is held back by low capacity utilisation
and the limited number of building permits
indicates a sluggish construction activity at least
for 2014. Supply conditions continue to be
influenced by industrial restructuring. New
products and services in sectors such as chemicals
and metals are gradually replacing production lost
in ICT and paper industry.
Exports are forecast to increase over 2014-15, even
though Finland is projected to lose further export

Risks to the economic outlook are balanced and
mainly related to developments in export markets.
Risks arising from financial market conditions
appear limited and funding costs low.
Labour market weak, inflation slowing

Labour market conditions started to worsen in late
2012 and this process has continued during 2013
with both the number of employed persons and
hours worked declining and the unemployment
rate increasing. The number of registered
unemployed is increasingly higher than the surveybased unemployment; this indicates that when
labour market conditions improve, the number of
active jobseekers might increase and the surveybased unemployment rate would remain elevated.
Therefore, the unemployment rate is set to remain
broadly stable over the forecast horizon despite the
gradual economic improvement. The collective
wage agreement for 2014-15 provides for
moderate wage growth, resulting in a lower
increase in unit labour costs than in the previous

years. However, the wage restraint needs time to
translate into positive employment growth.

would suggest as the surpluses in social security
funds are not used to reduce central government or
local government debt. Debt issuance is carried out
by the treasury based on the market conditions;
and the existence of liquid reserves allows for
some flexibility in the decisions to issue new debt.

Despite the consumption tax increase in 2013,
inflation receded to 2.2%. From 2014, new indirect
tax increases are applied, but due to lower wage
increases, falling energy prices, and a stabilisation
of prices for processed food and services, inflation
is set to decline further to 1.7% in 2014 and 1.6%
in 2015.

The government is focusing on the implementation
of the structural reforms programme concerning
labour market, government efficiency and business
environment in order to bring the level of public
debt down in the medium term and to stimulate
economic growth. Expenditure ceilings are used to
control the development of public expenditure and
further revenue increasing measures were
introduced from the beginning of 2014. However,
the tax burden is now reaching historic heights.

Public sector deficit continues to be high

Amid the worsened economic environment, the
general government deficit widened despite the
adjustment measures taken in 2013, from -1.8% of
GDP in 2012 to -2.4% in 2013. The deficit is
forecast to increase further in 2014 before
improving to -2.3% of GDP in 2015.

The output gap is estimated at -2.8% in 2013 and
-2.6% in 2014. This results in a projection for the
structural balance of -0.9% of GDP in 2013 and
-1.2% in 2014. In 2015, the structural balance is
forecast to reach -1.4% of GDP as the output gap
declines to -1.6%.

Due to the persisting primary deficit and low
nominal GDP growth, the debt-to-GDP ratio is
forecast to go slightly above the 60% threshold in
2014 and increase further in 2015. The debt
increase is higher than the annual fiscal deficits

27. SWEDEN
Rebounding from a soft patch
Following sluggish economic growth of 0.9% in 2013, the Swedish economy is expected to pick up
gradually and grow by 2.5% this year and 3.3% next year. While private consumption will remain an
important driver, rebounding investment will provide additional impetus to GDP growth. By contrast,
the contribution of net exports is expected to remain marginal.
Economic recovery ahead

After a weak growth performance in 2013, the
Swedish economy now follows a more robust
growth track and economic activity is expected to
gradually accelerate. GDP growth is forecast to
gradually increase to 2.5% in 2014 and to 3.3% in
2015 after 0.9% growth in 2013. Economic
sentiment has steadily improved during the course
of 2013, underpinning the projection for a more
solid economic growth over the forecast horizon.
While household consumption was the main
component to sustain the modest GDP growth in
2013 and is expected to stay strong, rebounding
investments are forecast to provide an additional
impetus to economic growth over the forecast
horizon.
Consumption growth remains robust

Household consumption is likely to accelerate in
2014 and 2015, as improving labour market
conditions, low interest rates and income tax cuts
boost disposable incomes. Household saving is
projected to have reached a new peak in 2013, but
will gradually decline in the forthcoming years as
economic uncertainties are waning, unemployment
is starting to decrease at a more robust pace and
baby-boomers retire.
Despite sluggish economic growth last year, the
labour market proved to be resilient: employment
continued to increase in 2013, while the
unemployment rate stayed flat. As a fall in
unemployment follows GDP growth only with
some time lag, a more substantial drop in the
unemployment rate is expected from the second
half of 2014. Taking also into account the
increasing labour force, the unemployment rate is
forecast to decrease to 7.7% in 2014 and to 7.3%
in 2015.

Rebounding investments: a new engine of
economic growth

Following a decline in investments in 2013, gross
fixed capital formation is expected to rebound
sharply in the coming years adding a new engine
to economic growth. Notably construction is likely
to pick up, following several years of depressed
levels.
Net exports will stay flat

In light of the weakness of the main European
trading partners and the appreciating krona,
Swedish export remained sluggish in 2013.
Despite the relatively strong household
consumption, imports are expected to shrink
similarly to exports. Over the forecast horizon,
with more solid economic growth of the main
trading partners (most importantly in Europe), both
export and import will resume. Compared to
previous recovery periods, net exports will only
contribute little to GDP growth, if at all.
The main risks highlighted in the previous
forecasts remain valid. A correction in the high
level of private debt, a fall in house prices or
dynamically rising repo rates could dampen
household consumption. A sharply appreciating
krona could suppress exports performance and also
negatively impact investments.

Low inflation on the horizon

HICP inflation dropped significantly from 0.9% in
2012 to 0.4% in 2013. The Riksbank cut the repo
rate to 0.75% in December 2013 and the timing of
initial tightening has been postponed until the first
quarter of 2015. At this stage, no particular upward
pressure is foreseen from any HICP component
and wage developments are projected to remain at
a moderate level. HICP is expected to reach 0.9%
in 2014 and accelerating to 1.8% in 2015. Inflation
is likely to moderately increase on the back of the
rebounding economy.
General government budget provides stimulus
in 2014

Fiscal stimuli (focusing on corporate taxation,
raising disposable incomes, labour market
incentives and infrastructure investments) will
increase the budget deficit from -1.1% of GDP in
2013 to -1.5% of GDP in 2014. In light of the
stronger GDP growth as well as the budget surplus

target and the nominal expenditure ceiling
embedded in the Swedish fiscal framework, no
further stimulus is expected after 2014.
Accordingly the general budget deficit is projected
to shrink to -0.8% of GDP by 2015. The structural
balance will deteriorate by 0.7% of GDP from
2013, turning negative in 2014 (-0.6% of GDP)
due to the expansionary fiscal policy and the
narrowing of the output gap. The deficit will
remain moderate and will slightly improve in 2015
(-0.4% of GDP).
The declining trend in the general government debt
has been reversed in 2013 by a one-off measure:
an additional SEK 100 billion (approximately
2.8% of GDP) has been borrowed in order to
strengthen the currency reserves of the Riksbank,
raising debt to 41.3% of the GDP in 2013. The
general government debt is still at a relatively low
level compared with other EU countries and will
further decline from 2015 onwards amidst a lower
budget deficit and accelerating growth.

28. THE UNITED KINGDOM
Recovery takes hold, fiscal imbalances still sizeable
Growth finally took hold in the UK in 2013 with strong domestic demand supressing the negative effect
of weak export performance. UK GDP grew 1.9% in 2013 and is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2014 and
2.4% in 2015. Inflation declined throughout the year as did unemployment. Some progress has also
been made on the fiscal side, but the debt ratio has yet to peak.
Strong growth finally making an appearance

Growth became more firmly established in 2013
with four continuous quarters of positive growth to
leave the annual figure at 1.9%. Domestic demand
was again the principal contributor to growth as
had been the case for the marginally upwardrevised 0.3% annual growth of 2012. Net trade is
likely to have contributed somewhat negatively to
growth over the year.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

The outlook for growth is now stronger than has
been in recent years, although growth is likely to
continue to come almost exclusively from
domestic demand with private consumption being
the main contributor and investment playing a
more important role as time progresses. In 2014
and 2015, growth is estimated at 2.5% and 2.4%,
respectively. Net exports are expected to remain
weak and improve only very slowly. There are
both upside and downside risks to the forecast.
Domestic demand may be more dynamic than
estimated as sentiment indicators are high.
However, the upturn in investment may fail to
materialise and private consumption may decline
sizeably, as a result of continued weak wage
growth, interest rate rises or the household debt
burden weighing down on spending.
Consumption is crucial

Economic growth in 2013 has been driven by
private consumption and its contribution is likely

102

to have been approximately three-quarters. Despite
negative real wage growth, consumers are running
down their savings in order to sustain their
spending habits. Robust employment rates are
likely to be the reason for this behaviour. The
expectation is that consumers will continue
spending, though less vigorously than was seen at
the end of 2013, as inflation falls and real wage
growth turns positive towards the end of 2014 and
into 2015.

The first three quarters of 2013 saw positive,
though
modest,
growth
for
investment.
Nevertheless, this bodes well for the future as it
was the first run of three expanding quarters since
early 2007, albeit from low levels. Equipment
investment was strongest earlier in the year but
construction took over thereafter. The soft
indicators reached highs during the second half of
2013. Combining this with the credit easing
measures in place, strong cash reserves and
returning confidence suggests that investment is
likely to pick up more sturdily in 2014 and should
be reinforced in 2015.
Weak net exports

Following a strongly negative contribution to
growth in 2012 of -0.7 pp. and given the outturns
to date in 2013, it is likely that net exports did not
contribute positively to growth. That said, the
outlook is that net exports will improve somewhat
and at least not be such a drag on growth in 2014
and 2015 as trading partners’ growth picks up.
Growing exports to Ireland and China (the latter
from low levels) should aid this improvement.
Inflation approaching target

During 2013, inflation fell steadily to reach 2.1%
in the final quarter of 2013. The quick decline in
prices was due to weak commodity and energy
price growth, lower-than-expected increases in
education costs, weak wage growth and an
appreciation of sterling dampening import prices.

Member States, The United Kingdom

The outlook is for inflation to fall further and settle
around the Bank of England’s target of 2% given
the spare capacity in the economy, an expectation
of low inflation growth and only slowly increasing
wage growth. The forecast estimates inflation at
2.0% in both 2014 and 2015.
Robust employment growth

The labour market has remained resilient since
2010 despite weak economic growth and
redundancies in the public sector with 2013 being
no exception. The average growth rate of total
employment in the first three quarters of 2013 was
1.3%. The unemployment rate continued falling to
7.5% in the third quarter of 2013 and the outlook is
for the rate to decline further though at a more
subdued rate. This is likely as labour productivity
is expected to recover in the short term and the
slack in the system should allow activity to pick up
through longer working hours without having to
hire new staff. The forecast is for the
unemployment rate to fall to 6.8% in 2014 and
6.5% in 2015.

Ongoing fiscal consolidation

The government continued with its original fiscal
consolidation plans in the Autumn Statement 2013.
The main taxation measures announced were a
cancelation of the fuel duty rise in 2014 and of the
employer national insurance contributions for
employees less than 21 years, and an increase in
the bank levy from January 2014. Further
reductions on departmental spending were
announced along with a cap on overall welfare
spending, excluding the basic state pension which
was increased marginally, and job seeker’s
allowance. As a result of revisions to GDP growth
and borrowing estimates, the deficit is expected to
reach 5.1% in 2014-15 and 4.2% in 2015-16. The
structural balance is forecast at 4.0% in the latter
year with the debt rate continuing to rise.

29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Recovery is gaining firm ground in spite of weaker Investment
The economic recovery strengthened in the first three quarters of 2013 and was supported by a strong
contribution from net exports. Despite a remarkable pick up in private consumption, domestic demand
provided only a small contribution to growth, given the major slump in investment. In line with
projected developments in foreign direct investment, the forecast expects a turnaround in this profile for
2014 and 2015, with investment strengthening again and the foreign balance proving a drag on growth.
Support from external
recovery in 2013…

sector

to

firming

The feeble recovery of output growth which had
begun in the second half of 2012 gained firm
ground in the first three quarters of 2013. Real
GDP increased by 3.2% compared to the previous
year, with net exports and private consumption
taking over from investment as growth drivers.
Contrary to earlier official estimates, gross capital
formation declined in each of the three quarters, in
annual terms, and by a total of 15% on the year.

Stimulated by supportive fiscal measures, private
consumption increased by an accumulated 5.1% in
the first three quarters. Supported by a benign
external environment and by new foreign direct
investment, net exports of goods and services
contributed positively to output growth for the first
time since 2010. Among the sectors, the
construction industry largely outperformed
manufacturing and grew by 33% on the year, after
average growth of 4.8% in 2012.
…is not likely to be sustained

The profile of growth is expected to change again
over the forecast horizon, with a renewed pick-up
in gross capital formation, and further gains in
household consumption taking the lead. Both,

106

public and foreign direct investment are projected
to increase, coupled with gradual strengthening in
credit extension to the corporate sector. Household
consumption is likely to post resilient growth rates
over the horizon, in line with expectations for
disposable income, deriving from a positive
employment trend, higher social transfers, and
stable remittances. With new foreign investors
taking up production over the horizon, the forecast
expects a renewed strengthening of import
demand. Notwithstanding the further improvement
in major export markets, a renewed, gradual
deterioration of the merchandise balance is likely.
Hence, net exports would impact negatively on
growth in both years. This drag could prove
sizeable, if FDI, the main source of the country's
exports, evolves less vigorously than expected.
Slight labour market stimulation will continue

Aided by the firming recovery and official
employment programmes, the number of
unemployed had decreased by 4.5% at the end of
September 2013, compared to a year earlier. With
a significantly smaller increase in the labour force,
this lowered the unemployment rate to 28.7%,
down from 30.6% a year earlier. The number of
employed persons increased by 4%, bringing the
employment rate to 40.8%, up by 1.7pp from a
year earlier, with virtually no change in the total
working
age
population.
However,
the
unemployment rate for 15 to 24 olds remained
largely unchanged at 52% over the year. Driven
primarily by the expected pick up of public and
foreign direct investment, as well as by a
continuation of active labour market policies,
employment is expected to rise further, albeit less
strongly, while the unemployment rate would drop
further over the forecast horizon.

While the current-account deficit presumably
narrowed somewhat in 2013, due to an improving
trade balance, in spite of lower private transfers,

Candidate Countries, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

the forecast expects it to deteriorate again, due to
renewed widening of the merchandise deficit.
However, the need for external borrowing to
finance the current-account deficit was mitigated
in 2013 by a renewed pick up in FDI, and is likely
to remain so over the forecast horizon. At the end
of the third quarter, FDI inflows reached 3.3% of
accumulated GDP, compared to 0.9% at the same
time in 2012. Given the increasingly benign
investment trends in the country's major trade
partners, and the government's active recruitment,
the forecast expects FDI to remain elevated.

General government deficit

The general government deficit for 2013 was
revised in the autumn from 3.6% to 3.9%,
following the adoption of a supplementary budget.
In view of anticipated consolidation measures, the
forecast expects the deficit to gradually narrow to
around 3.6% in 2015. After having jumped in 2012
by 5.6pp to 34% of GDP, the general government
debt ratio is expected to have increased by
somewhat less in 2013. However, overall public
debt, which includes the debt of state-owned
enterprises, public agencies and public financial
institutions is likely to be significantly higher.

It would also comprise the newly established
Public Enterprise for State Roads through which
the government channels the increasingly
important road infrastructure expenditure – and
which can borrow on its own behalf with its debt
guaranteed by the government. In conclusion, in
order for general government debt levels to
stabilise, fiscal deficits would have to decrease
more substantially than targeted. This is likely to
prove difficult in view of recently implemented
pension increases, public wage rises as of this year,
and an increase in social transfers.

Helped by tourism, but held back by capital controls
Third quarter growth in 2013 was much stronger than expected as a result of high tourism revenues and
resilient private consumption. In 2014 and 2015, output growth likely to remain close to 3%, supported
by tourism and related construction, strengthened disposable income, and stronger international
demand. However, the continued uncertainty related to the lifting of capital controls is likely to impede
more dynamic growth.
A stronger second half of 2013 …

Overall economic activity received a marked boost
from record high tourism earnings, contributing
more than one third to the economy's output
growth of some 3% in the first three quarters of
2013. Private and public consumption each
contributed about ½ pp. to overall growth.
Investments were lower than a year before, which
was partly due to high spending for ships and
airplanes in 2012. High frequency indicators, such
as credit card turnover, point to rather stable
consumption during the last months of the year.
However, a bigger than usual share of those
purchases might have been used for imports, which
would dampen output growth in the fourth quarter.
The labour market situation continued to improve,
with employment increasing by more than 3%,
while unemployment dropped from 6% in 2012 to
5.4% in 2013.
Inflationary pressures subsided markedly towards
the end of 2013, partly reflecting decelerating
import prices, in particular for oil. With the
exception of housing prices, domestic price
dynamics now seems to head towards the Central
Bank's inflation target of 2.5%. The end-year wage
agreements were in line with the declining
inflation expectations. This rather new trend could
strengthen disposable income and facilitate job
creation.

capital controls has a negative effect on
investment, in particular from abroad. Total
exports are projected to benefit from an improved
global outlook and a flourishing tourism sector.
However, higher imports due to stronger domestic
demand will largely offset the positive effects of
higher tourism revenues.

Unemployment declines further …

Labour market conditions are expected to improve
during 2014-15, benefitting from moderate wage
developments and new opportunities in the tourism
sector. This should help to lower unemployment
below 5% by 2015. The long-term unemployment
will remain a crucial challenge.
…while inflationary pressures subside.

… although the outlook is still for contained
growth ahead

Key
determinants
for
Iceland's
growth
performance in 2014-15 will be tourism and
related construction activities as well as private
consumption, benefitting from lower inflation and
government measures to boost disposable income,
such as the announced household debt relief
programme but also the extended possibility to use
third-pillar pension savings for consumption. Some
long-planned investment projects in the energyintense and maritime sectors could further increase
domestic demand. However, the existence of

108

Inflationary pressures are expected to subside in
2014, thanks to relatively low increases in import
prices but also contained wage agreements.
However, in 2015, this trend could reverse, as a
result of strengthening import prices but also
stronger domestic demand.
External balance is likely to deteriorate

As a result of stronger domestic demand, the
surplus in trade in goods will shrink, while the
service balance is expected to continue benefitting
further from expanding tourism. A large part of the

Candidate Countries, Iceland

current-account deficit accounts for net income
from banks in winding up proceedings. Corrected
for these, the "underlying" current account will
remain closer to balance.

The forecast assumes that the new government will
respect its commitments towards continued fiscal
consolidation, as described in the 2014 budget
adopted in December. The envisaged spending
reductions should allow a lowering of the deficit to
around 1½% of GDP in 2014 and only a slight
deficit in 2015. After reaching a peak of nearly
100% of GDP in 2011, the general government
debt-to-GDP ratio started to decline in 2012.
Thanks to substantial primary surpluses in 2014
and 2015, the debt ratio is likely to drop towards
86% by the end of the forecast horizon.

Reducing public debt remains a challenge

The general government deficit dropped from
5.6% of GDP in 2011 to 3.8% in 2012. During
2013, fiscal consolidation remained behind targets,
largely reflecting the weaker-than-expected
revenue growth. As a result, the 2013 end-year
deficit is likely to be close to 2¾% of GDP.

Risks and uncertainties are still elevated

Increased domestic demand as a result of
government measures, such as the household debt
relief programme, could translate into a sharp
widening of external imbalances, creating pressure
on the exchange rate and domestic price stability.
Moreover, the Icelandic economy is still shielded
by extensive capital controls and their removal
remains a huge challenge.

31. MONTENEGRO
A new wave of investment
Stronger-than-expected growth in 2013 confirmed the positive contribution of a number of sectors
besides electricity production. A rebalancing of growth from net exports towards domestic consumption
is expected following a new wave of major investments and, to a lesser extent, a mild recovery in private
consumption. The adoption of fiscal rules seems to confirm the continuity of consolidation efforts.
A faster recovery

In the third quarter of 2013, real GDP grew by 4%
y-o-y, accelerating from a 3.4% real growth in the
second quarter and 1.1% expansion in the first
quarter. Growth was largely driven by net exports
of electric energy and tourism services. A
continuation of this growth could be expected in
the last quarter of 2013 too, supported by
preliminary data on construction, utilities and
agriculture, but also a successful tourism postseason and its positive effect on retail trade,
leading to an average expansion of GDP of around
2.5% for the whole year. Compared to the autumn,
the winter forecast presents a slightly faster growth
scenario for 2014 and 2015 too.

Two major uncertainties

Yet, there are two major unknowns which may call
for further revision in later forecasts. The first one
is the pace of credit growth. In 2013, bank's loans
grew 3% y-o-y, reversing a three-year period of
decline. However, credit supply remains
constrained by tight credit conditions stirred up by
the high level of non-performing loans (around
18% of total loans at the end of 2013). As a result,
private consumption is expected to remain subdued
during the forecast horizon.

110

The second factor of uncertainty will be the pace
of investments and its real contribution to gross
fixed capital formation in the coming years. There
are several important tourism, energy and
infrastructure projects in the pipeline, which if
successfully implemented, may set a broader base
for future growth. So far, the construction of the
tourism resorts in Lustica, Tivat and Kumbor and
the electricity interconnection cable with Italy are
in progress, while preparatory works for the
highway, the second block for the thermal plant
and two windmill farms are expected to start in
2014. However, the short-term net contribution
from these investments remains difficult to
ascertain given the small size of the country and its
high import dependence.

The unemployment rate is forecast to fall below
19%, while employment will maintain positive but
subdued growth rates until 2015, when the pace of
investments speeds up. Weak labour market
dynamics have also been reflected in the
moderation of wages, contracting by almost 4% in
real annual terms in 2013. We expect wages to
increase broadly in line with the recovery of
demand for local labour. In 2013, average inflation
totalled 2.2% compared to 4.1% a year before.
Future improvement of domestic demand may
have a limited impact on prices as private
consumption would still remain mostly driven by
tourists' expenditure whereas domestic wages and
bank loans growth improve only gradually during
the forecast period.
Large external imbalances

In the first three quarters of 2013 the currentaccount deficit has been narrowing and could close
below 17% of GDP by the end of the year. Yet, the
improvement of the trade deficit could reverse in
the next years as exports' base effects fade out and
new capacities in tourism and energy are yet under
construction. The forecast also expects a
deterioration of the income and transfers net
balances as more foreign workers will be

Candidate Countries, Montenegro

employed in construction. The external gap would
continue being fully financed by FDI inflows.
By mid-2014, the authorities could put into
practice a voluntary financial restructuring
programme to reduce payment arrears between
companies, banks and tax administration,
reinforcing the sustainability of the banking sector,
public finances and real sector liquidity. The
recovery of domestic demand could benefit to the
extent that this programme proves successful.
Meanwhile, the re-emergence of investors' risk
aversion to emerging markets, following the
indications from the Federal Reserve’s tapering of
monetary stimulus, might also delay some
investments in Montenegro.
Sustained fiscal consolidation efforts

In the autumn forecast we anticipated the
government would borrow additional EUR 100
million to close the budget gap after paying in
August two bank loans to cover the guarantees of
the bankrupt aluminium factory (KAP). However,
budget performance improved markedly during
2013, supported by increases of the personal

income tax and VAT rates, resulting in a 10%
average expansion of revenue compared to a year
before. As a result, the government avoided a
rebalance of the budget to increase the borrowing
ceiling to pay for those guarantees (totalling 3.2%
of GDP). Yet, despite the freezing of pensions and
public sector wages, the budget deficit reached 4%
of GDP at the end of 2013.
We foresee the broadening of the tax base to have
lasting effects throughout the next two years, and
therefore, budget deficits to fade by the end of
2015. However, this scenario will depend on the
extent to which GDP growth (i.e. denominator
effect) might outpace the expansion of public
spending and debt as the government starts
borrowing to finance the highway project.
In our view, further expansion of the public debt
remains a serious risk. Apart from relying on
growth, the government also plans for 2014 a
major overhaul of the stock of public debt
(especially two Eurobonds issues maturing in 2015
and 2016) to improve debt sustainability through
more favourable terms.

32. SERBIA
Key reforms ahead
After a year of strong export-led growth, Serbia's economy is expected to slow down in 2014 before
picking up again in 2015, driven by increased investment linked to the country's EU accession prospects
and reforms. Early parliamentary elections, scheduled for mid-March, however, are delaying the
implementation of key reforms. While exports are expected to remain robust, households consumption is
poised to recover slowly, hampered by fiscal consolidation measures and low net employment creation.
Growth in 2013: stronger than expected

The exports driven growth accelerated strongly to
3.7% (y-o-y) in the third quarter, following an
upward revision of data in the first two quarters to
3.0% and 0.6%. However, domestic demand
remained weak with a steady fall in private
consumption and more pronounced drop in
investments. There was also a significant revision
of 2012 data, in particular regarding growth of
investments (from -3.4% to 14.4%), exports (from
4.5% to 1.8%) and imports (from 4.2% to 1.9%).
The robust economic performance is estimated to
have continued in the last quarter of 2013, bringing
the annual growth above 2%, higher than expected.
Households consumption is likely to have
stabilised in the last quarter of the year, but its
recovery is poised to be slow and uneven, impeded
by a weak labour market and bouts of fiscal
consolidation efforts. The latter are also expected
to keep public consumption growth negative
throughout the forecast period.
Continuing rebalancing towards exports and
investments...

The ongoing rebalancing of the economy away
from consumption is expected to continue, with
investments playing an increasingly important role.
However, this process may be uneven as it is
linked to pursuing the announced far-reaching
structural reforms, which are subject to significant
implementation risks.

they have hit a bottom at 2.3% of GDP in 2013. In
line with growing demand, imports are envisaged
to slowly catch-up, turning the net exports
contribution to growth slightly negative in the
outer year of the forecast.
…but major hurdles ahead

The forecast assumes that Serbia would move on
with the implementation of a number of already
announced major structural reforms as of the
second half of this year. However, the actual
timing and sequencing of these reforms brings
uncertainty to the forecast scenario, especially with
regard to investments, labour market and budget
performance.
As economic activity strengthens, the labour
market is foreseen to become more dynamic,
although any gains in employment are likely to be
largely offset by job losses in the public sector. As
a result, the unemployment rate would remain very
high. Discrepancies between different sources of
data on the labour market have increased, as the
Labour force survey registered a significant drop
in unemployment, while registered unemployment
continued to rise.

Base effects are expected to drive exports growth
temporarily down in 2014 but improving external
demand would be supporting an overall robust
exports performance over the forecast horizon. The
beginning of EU accession negotiations and
increased membership prospects, supported by
stronger FDI and reforms improving the business
environment are foreseen to lead to a pronounced
hike in investment activity, albeit from a very low
level. Gross capital formation is also likely to be
supported by higher government investments, after

portfolio and foreign direct investment inflows,
and transient depreciation episodes linked to
external factors or bouts of domestic policy
uncertainty. Thus, it is likely to provide a major
anchor for inflation expectations and, along with
weak domestic demand, reduce inflation volatility.
Despite solid exports growth, the space for
improving the current-account deficit is expected
to be exhausted by 2015, as domestic demand and
imports start to slowly recover.

Fiscal consolidation: still a long way to go

expected in the autumn. Although revenue
underperformed, significant across-the-board
current and investment expenditure cuts have
contained the overall deficit to an estimated 4.9%
of GDP.
The 2014 budget foresees new consolidation
measures, almost equally split between the revenue
and expenditure side. A hiring freeze in the public
sector would also contribute to containing
expenditure pressures. However, higher interest
and investment spending and social expenditure
related to the envisaged restructuring of public
enterprises are expected to keep total spending and
the budget deficit high. Despite more prudent
planning, there are also important downside risks
to budget execution. The revenue-poor structure of
growth and lower GDP deflator may threaten
revenue collection and delaying key reforms could
create additional risks to meeting the deficit target.
Absent further consolidation measures, the deficit
would remain high and, together with payments on
bank recapitalisations and activated government
guarantees, would be keeping government debt on
an upward trajectory.

The 2013 budget deficit turned out below the
revised budget target and much lower than

33. TURKEY
Depreciation, monetary tightening and external rebalancing
Growth was somewhat faster than expected in 2013, but the outlook for economic activity over the next
two years has deteriorated against the background of recent developments. Monetary conditions have
tightened and the stock market has suffered a major correction. The lira's sharp depreciation is stoking
inflation and curbing consumers' purchasing power, but should also help the economy to rebalance
gradually towards external demand.
Domestic-demand based growth in 2013

Following a pronounced slowdown in 2012,
Turkey's economy re-accelerated in the first half of
2013. This was helped by monetary policy
accommodation and a relatively large increase in
public spending, particularly investment. In the
third quarter, the quarter-on-quarter growth slowed
to 0.9% as public spending was reined in. Monthly
data suggest a further moderate slowdown in the
fourth quarter.
For 2013 as a whole, GDP growth is projected at
3.8%. Consumer spending – fuelled by sharply
higher bank lending and substantial employment
growth – made the largest contribution. Net
exports of goods and services subtracted from
overall growth due to a sharp turnaround in
Turkey's trade in non-monetary gold related to
international sanctions on Iran. Net imports of gold
worth 1.4% of GDP widened Turkey's currentaccount deficit to 7.8% of GDP in 2013. In terms
of GDP growth, gold imports were partly offset by
the related positive contribution from inventories.
Depreciation and tighter financial conditions

Turkey's financial markets and the lira have been
under strong downward pressure since May 2013
in the context of the Federal Reserve's tapering of
asset purchases, two domestic political crises, and
geo-political tensions related to the Syrian civil
war. By mid-February, the yield on the two-year
benchmark government note had risen by
600 basis points to close to 11% and the major
index on the Istanbul stock exchange had fallen by
30%. The lira depreciated by 16.4% in real
effective terms between April 2013 and January
2014.
In addition to heavy lira-supporting interventions
in the foreign exchange market, the central bank
has reacted to the market turmoil by tightening
monetary policy. Following initial moves last
summer towards a less accommodative monetary
policy stance, the central bank took more

114

aggressive action in January. The overnight
lending rate was raised from 7.75% to 12% and the
one-week repo rate was hiked from 4.5% to 10%.
The central bank has signalled that it will maintain
a tight monetary policy stance until there is a
significant improvement in the inflation outlook.

Rebalancing towards external demand

Looking forward, final domestic demand will be
significantly dampened by recent developments.
The pass-through of the lira depreciation to
domestic prices will reduce both private and public
consumption in real terms. Consumer spending
will also be hit by higher interest rates, recent
macro-prudential measures to lower household
borrowing, some indirect tax hikes, a negative
wealth effect, and declining confidence. Business
investment will be curbed by higher interest rates,
by higher funding costs due the stock market
correction, and by deteriorating balance sheets for
companies with debt in foreign exchange.
On the external side, the lira's depreciation will
improve the international price competitiveness of
Turkish goods and services, thereby re-directing
economic activity towards exports and importsubstituting output. This, combined with the
recovery in Turkey's export markets, will gradually
offset the reduction in domestic demand growth
and lead to some rebalancing of the economy.

Candidate Countries, Turkey

Slower growth, higher inflation, but a smaller
current-account deficit

In 2014, the economy is projected to continue the
slowdown already noticeable in the second half of
2013. The annual GDP growth rate is projected at
2.5% with net exports starting to contribute
positively. In 2015, growth is expected to increase
to 3.0% as domestic demand recovers gradually.
Considering the domestic political uncertainty and
the possibility of a further sell-off in Turkish
financial assets in context of a normalisation of
monetary conditions in developed markets, the
risks to this growth projection are biased to the
downside.
Annual inflation will be pushed up to 8.7% in 2014
spurred mainly by the pass-through from the recent
currency depreciation, but also by some
adjustments of indirect taxes. When these effects
peter out, below-potential output growth will help
to lower inflation somewhat. Nevertheless, in view
of the current inflation expectations, the inflation
rate is projected to remain significantly above the
central bank's 5% medium-term target throughout
the forecast period.

Employment growth already slowed in the second
half of 2013. Given the structural increase of the
labour force, the unemployment rate is projected to
rise to 10.5% in 2014 before levelling off. The lira
depreciation and the rebalancing of the economy
are projected to narrow the current-account deficit
gradually to 4.4% of GDP by 2015.
Public debt ratio raised by the depreciation

In 2013, the fiscal deficit of general government
was held in check by surging revenues partly
resulting from earlier changes to indirect taxation
and the social security regime. The forecast
projects the deficit to widen to almost 3% of GDP
in 2014 due to much slower revenue growth. Some
narrowing of the deficit is forecast for 2015 when
economic activity and revenue growth pick up
again. The debt ratio of general government has
suffered from the recent lira depreciation which
has increased the book value of foreign currency
debt. This, in conjunction with the upwardly
revised deficit projection, implies a stabilisation of
the debt ratio around 36% of GDP rather than a
continued downward trend as previously forecast.

34. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Recovery gathering momentum
The outlook for the US economy has improved since the autumn forecast, as the negative impact of last
October's budget crisis proved much less severe than expected and the recent budget and debt ceiling
agreements dissipated fiscal policy uncertainty, boosting confidence. Growth is now expected to climb
from 1.9% in 2013 to 2.9% this year and 3.2% next year, 0.3 pp. and 0.1 pp. higher than previously
forecast, reflecting the waning fiscal drag, firming investment and a steady housing market recovery.
Recovery firming amid waning fiscal drag and
continued support from monetary policy

Economic activity in the US is gathering
momentum as the headwinds from fiscal policy
wane and household consumption gains speed,
benefitting from robust job creation, recovering
house prices and buoyant stock markets. Over the
forecast horizon, the recovery is expected to
consolidate and broaden to encompass business
investment, which has yet to recover to pre-crisis
levels. With the continued support of near-zero
interest rates and firming external demand, this
should reinforce virtuous circles between
construction activity, household spending and
employment expansion, bringing GDP growth
back to around potential by 2015.
Real GDP growth strengthened to 1.0% q-o-q in
the third quarter and 0.8% in the fourth despite
significant fiscal drag and uncertainty related to
the government shutdown and the debt-ceiling
standoff in October. Growth in the second half of
the year was driven by private consumption,
sizeable inventory investment (third quarter) and
net exports (fourth quarter).

The brighter outlook for the US economy
combined with still subdued inflation led the Fed
in December to decide to gradually reduce its asset

118

purchases from January, with a view of finishing
the programme by the end of 2014. The decision to
unwind quantitative easing was complemented by
reinforced forward guidance on the interest rate
which is now likely to remain near-zero "well past
the time that the unemployment declines below
6½%". Most recent Fed projections would
therefore suggest that the federal funds rate is
unlikely to be raised before 2015.
An increasingly broad-based recovery

Private consumption accelerated gradually in the
course of the year to 0.6% q-o-q in the fourth
quarter (the fastest rate in three years). This is in
line with rising consumer confidence, which
recovered quickly after a temporary shake-up in
the autumn linked with the fiscal policy
uncertainty. Consumption is projected to gather
speed in 2014 and 2015 underpinned by the steady
recovery of the labour and housing market and
robust household incomes.
Government spending continued to weigh down on
GDP, subtracting 0.4 pp. from growth in 2013 as a
whole, as tax increases imposed by the fiscal-cliffdeal
interacted
with
sequestration-related
expenditure cuts to produce the second-steepest
consolidation in post-war history. However,
headwinds from fiscal policy are expected to wane
over the forecast horizon, with fiscal consolidation
easing to less than 1% of GDP in 2014 and 0.5% in
2015 in terms of headline balances. Moreover,
thanks to the recent budget and debt ceiling deals,
the policy outlook has become much clearer.
Nevertheless, the debt-to-GDP ratio will continue
to exceed 100% over the forecast horizon.
Business investment remained feeble throughout
2013, expanding by a mere 2.6%, the weakest
since 2010, likely depressed by continued
monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty and severe
federal spending cuts. As this uncertainty recedes,
investment is expected to gradually accelerate to
rates more than double the GDP growth – driven
by expanding domestic and external demand.

Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America

Despite continuously rising home prices,
construction activity and property sales stalled in
the summer of 2013, as rising mortgage rates
began to curb demand. Momentum in the sector
resumed towards the end of the year, but housing
investment posted its first negative growth
contribution in the fourth quarter in more than
three years. Going forward, activity and sales are
expected to gradually resume their robust pace,
supported by historically low inventory levels,
steady population growth and progress in
household deleveraging, as mortgage debt (as a
share of disposable income) fell by 23 pps. from its
early-2009 peak until the third quarter.
Falling unemployment and participation rates

The labour market continued its recovery
throughout 2013, but job growth weakened
markedly in December (partly due to harsh
weather conditions) and in January 2014. The
unemployment rate continued to fall, reaching
6.6% in January 2014 (the lowest since October
2008). However, this reduction occurred against
the background of persistently low and falling
labour force participation, predominantly due to
demographic reasons. Employment is expected to

advance in 2014 and 2015, driving the
unemployment rate down, amid a mild cyclical
recovery in labour participation (from 2015).
Inflationary pressures remain subdued

Headline consumer inflation fell to a four-year low
in October (0.7 and 1.0% for the PCE deflator and
the CPI, respectively). While consumer prices
accelerated somewhat since then, inflation remains
well below the Fed's 2% target and is not expected
to reach it until mid-2015. Real wages remained
subdued in 2013, rising by a mere 1.5%, but are
projected to pick up gradually over the forecast
horizon in line with the shrinking labour market
slack.
Some downside risks prevail

Recently observed weaker dynamics in the labour
and housing market could have partly been
weather-related, but also raise some uncertainty
about the underlying strength of the economic
recovery. If these concerns persist, they could spill
over to household confidence and consumption
and contribute to a more gradual recovery than
currently expected.

35. JAPAN
A bumpy road ahead
Japan's economy is expected to sustain its current rate of growth in 2014 thanks to continued monetary
expansion and fiscal stimulus. Fiscal policy decisions have the potential to cause some variability in the
near term, while in the medium term, additional consolidation measures and the uncertainty
surrounding structural reforms are expected to dampen growth in 2015.
Short-term dynamics driven by fiscal policy
measures

The near-term outlook is largely driven by
announced fiscal policy changes. Private
consumption is expected to support growth on the
back of the front-loading of expenditure ahead of
the consumption tax hike in April 2014. A similar
consumption pattern should materialise before the
expected October 2015 tax hike. The negative
growth effects from the 2014 tax hike should be
partly offset by a ¥5.5 tn (around 1% of GDP)
stimulus package expected to support private and
public investment and low-income earners. Over
the forecast horizon uncertainty surrounding
structural reforms may hold back private nonresidential investment, whilst households may
scale down consumption should wage growth fail
to pick up consistently.

Continued subdued real income growth in
conjunction with the scheduled consumption tax
hikes represents however a tangible downside risk
to the effectiveness of ongoing reflationary efforts.
Private consumption is being front-loaded…

High-frequency indicators point to an acceleration
in private consumption in anticipation of the April
tax hike. Retail sales ended the year on an upward
momentum, reaching their highest level since 2001
on an annual basis. Consumer confidence remains
relatively strong, but has been trending downward

Japan's accommodative monetary stance has
remained unchanged since the inception of the
Bank of Japan's Quantitative and Qualitative
Monetary Easing in April 2013. Monetary policy
and financial conditions are expected to remain
broadly supportive over the forecast horizon.
Average lending rates are below 1% and persist on
a mildly downward trend despite rising
inflationary pressures, while lending volumes keep
growing.

Regarding inflation, 'core-core' CPI inflation
(excluding food and energy) is trending upward
(0.7% y-o-y in December, after 0.6% in
November), and both survey- and market-based
measures of inflation expectations support further
inflationary pressures ahead. Front-loaded
consumption in the run-up to April's tax hike and
tightening labour market conditions should
maintain upward pressure on prices. Total cash
earnings are expected to gradually pick up over the
medium term and prop up CPI inflation towards
the stated inflation target of 2%.

Labour market conditions are improving steadily
and are expected to remain tight. However nominal
wages remain sticky and have failed to
significantly pick up so far. Total cash earnings
should gradually accelerate and underpin private
consumption in the medium term. But the basic
wage component is likely to remain stickier for
some time due to reluctance of employers to
permanently raise labour costs. The recent
downward trend in consumer confidence may
reflect a concern that the April tax hike will further
depress real incomes in the absence of higher wage
growth. This corroborates the expected slump in
private consumption in the second quarter of 2014.

Other non-EU Countries, Japan

…but the outlook for investment and net
exports remains uncertain

Private non-residential investment picked up over
the last three quarters of 2013, and investment
conditions remain favourable, with restored
corporate profitability buoyed by the weaker yen,
and continued ultra-loose financial conditions.
Machinery orders are on a near-term upward trend,
which supports the view that business investment
recovery is ongoing and should firm up over the
coming quarters. Residential investment should
remain resilient in the run-up to April's tax hike,
before being scaled back in its immediate
aftermath and gradually recover in the run-up to
the October 2015 tax hike. Public investment is
expected to remain sustained over the forecast
horizon underpinned by fiscal stimulus measures.
Net exports contributed positively to growth over
the first two quarters of 2013 (0.5% and 0.3%
respectively), but sluggish exports to Asia (excl.
China) and resilient energy imports implied a
negative growth contribution in the second half of
the year. Exports are expected to keep recovering
in the near term, in line with latest survey
indicators on export orders. In the medium term

exports are expected to gradually improve on the
back of ongoing recovery in the US and EU
economies, and robust demand from China.
Imports should also remain sustained on the back
of continued resilience of fossil fuel imports, with
imports of consumer goods possibly impacted by
the scaling back of households' consumption
decisions in the aftermath of April's tax hike.
Overall net exports should add to growth over the
forecast horizon as export demand is expected to
gather pace and fully adjust to restored export
competitiveness.
Risks remain elevated

Uncertainty surrounding the scope and depth of
structural reform measures to be expected over the
forecast horizon may drag on investment decisions
ahead, and weigh on productivity growth.
Continued negative or anaemic real wage growth
would squeeze households' disposable incomes
over the forecast horizon, with negative effects on
consumption and inflation. On the external side,
slower than expected recovery in the US and the
EU and deterioration in Japan-China bilateral trade
potentially spurred by a slowdown in the Chinese
economy remain possible downside risks.

36. CHINA
Steady growth, but risk factors remain significant
China's economy continues to grow rapidly, expanding by 7.7% in 2013, almost the same rate as in
2012 (7.8%). Nevertheless, there are rising concerns as the shift in composition of demand away from
investment and towards consumption observed in 2012 was reversed during 2013. Warning signals have
also emerged from the financial sector which has seen rapid credit growth and several recent spikes in
inter-bank interest rates. Therefore, while high frequency indicators remain steady, and the short-term
forecast is unchanged at 7.4% for both 2014 and 2015, underlying risks remain significant.
A return to investment-led growth in 2013
14

China's economy grew by 7.7% in 2013, compared
to 7.8% growth in 2012. After a soft patch in the
first half of the year, high frequency indicators
picked up after the summer and the second half of
the year saw a high degree of stability in the most
commonly watched measures of activity, with
retail sales, industrial production and PMI
measures all moving in a narrow range. This
pattern was reflected in the quarterly GDP
readings, with a slightly weaker second quarter
outturn of 7.5% (y-o-y) followed by 7.8% growth
in the third quarter, and 7.7% in the fourth quarter.
Inflation remained relatively subdued throughout
2013, though has edged up in recent months, to
stand at around 3%.
The weakening of the economy in the early part of
year, and the subsequent return to higher growth in
the second half of the year, reflects significant
developments in the composition of growth.
During 2012 consumption had provided a
somewhat larger contribution to growth than
investment. This pattern, consistent with a
"rebalancing" of China's growth model away from
investment, persisted into the first quarter of 2013
with consumption providing 4.2 pps. of growth
while investment proved extremely weak,
contributing just 2.3 pps. Only an unusually large
positive contribution from net exports kept the
overall growth rate over 7% in the first quarter.
The rest of the year however saw a marked shift in
the pattern of growth and a return to investment
led growth. Investment sharply increased its
weight to 4.1 pps. of growth in the second and to
4.3 pps. in the third quarter, while consumption
contributed somewhat less, at 3.4 pps. in the
second and 3.5 pps. in the third quarter. After the
positive first quarter, net exports made a negligible
contribution to growth during the rest of 2013,
held back in part by a rise in the RMB real
effective exchange rate of 7% over the year,
alongside sluggish growth in world trade volumes.

Outlook stable, but risks are rising

During 2014 and 2015 a return to the modest
rebalancing of demand seen in 2012 is expected,
with slower investment growth and consequently
slightly lower growth of GDP. Consumption
growth is expected to remain fairly firm as
nominal wage growth is picking up after a fall in
2012, real interest rates on household deposit
holdings are fairly stable, and policy initiatives to
raise consumption remain a political priority. The
external sector however is likely to remain under
pressure due to overall still relatively moderate
recovery in many advanced economies, as well as
the effects of appreciation of the RMB. The impact
of recent financial turmoil on demand from other
emerging markets remains to be seen, but the risks
appear mainly on the downside.
While investment growth appears robust, there are
major underlying concerns about sustainability.
Not only is China's share of investment in GDP
still extremely high (close to 50%), but in recent
years China has also seen a surge in real estate
investment, very rapid credit growth, and an
increasing share of new credit coming from
outside the traditional banking system (largely
securitised loans). Important concerns remain
regarding the implicit guarantees underpinning

Other non-EU Countries, China

lending via securitised trust loans mediated by
large banks. A significant fraction of such loans
are due for repayment over the forecast horizon,
and there are doubts about the quality of some of
the underlying assets.
Increased signs of financial stress

Monetary policy remained accommodative
throughout the early part of 2013, with inter-bank
rates at around 3%, but mid-year saw an important
turning point, with inter-bank interest rates spiking
sharply in June to above 10%. Inter-bank rates fell
subsequently on intervention by the People's Bank
of China, but remain somewhat above the level
seen in the first half of the year, at well over 4%.
Further smaller spikes in inter-bank rates were
seen in both December 2013 and January 2014.
Concerns over solvency and liquidity risks linked
to excess investment and credit growth are not
new, but have heightened during 2013, and the
outlook hinges to some extent on how the need to

curb a build-up of credit risk will be balanced with
the short-term growth targets. A more rapid rise in
household consumption could offset a slowdown
in investment, but a smooth rotation of demand is
challenging given the relative shares of investment
and consumption in GDP. Reforms to raise the
household share of national income and thus boost
consumption do not yet seem to have had much
sustained traction at the macroeconomic level.
China's real GDP is projected to continue to grow
at just under 7.5% for 2014 and 2015. This reflects
the view that China will gradually adjust to a lower
trend growth rate, with lower investment growth
and higher consumption growth, without a major
slowdown. However, while some global risks
linked to advanced economies have become more
balanced, risks in other emerging markets have
become more pronounced. Moreover, domestic
downside risks from the financial sector appear to
have been heighted, and the potential difficulties of
achieving a successful rebalancing of demand are
evident.

37. EFTA
Outperformance comes with a risk
The EFTA region continues to outperform the EU by a sizeable margin with both Norway and
Switzerland benefiting from strong domestic demand and growing trade. Any change in risk
perceptions, however could jeopardise these countries' success.
In both Switzerland and Norway, the
competitiveness of the domestic economy outside
the best-performing sectors has deteriorated as a
consequence of low productivity growth and high
wage increases alongside appreciation of the
national currency. From 2001 to 2012, the real
effective exchange rate, based on unit labour costs,
appreciated by 7.9% annually in Norway and by
6.0% in Switzerland while for the simple average
of the euro area was 5.1%. The disparity with the
euro area and an average of OECD countries has
become particularly large since 2008.
Both Norway and Switzerland see a division
between the more and the less successful parts of
the economy. In Norway there is the obvious
divide between the off- and the on-shore sectors.
At the same time, the disparity in unemployment
developments between regions like Zurich and
Ticino since 2009 is bigger than between the best
and worst performing in Norway.

Euro area

The effect of lose monetary policy and capital
inflows on the housing market continues to be a
concern. Credit to households has risen to high
levels in both countries. On the asset side of
households there has been strong wealth creation
through increasing house prices. The rise in house
prices has outpaced growth in disposable income

124

as shown in graph II.37.1. Regardless of the high
volatility, which is partly due to the data not being
seasonally adjusted, there is a clear upward trend
in both countries. Conversely, for the euro area as
a whole, the trend has been to the downwards since
the global economic and financial crisis.
Switzerland

Since the autumn forecast, the economic
projections for Switzerland have become slightly
more benign. The estimation for GDP growth in
2013 has been revised upwards after surprisingly
positive figures for the third quarter of 2013. These
GDP growth figures also showed a broad based
growth. Although indications are for a moderation
in the fourth quarter of 2013, the expectation is
that this year and next, the Swiss economy will
grow above its potential output growth rate. This is
the result of continued robust growth in domestic
demand and an increasing contribution from net
trade.
Still, growth is mostly demand driven and comes
at a time of strong immigration and loose monetary
conditions. The comparison between real GDP
growth and real GDP growth per capita gives an
indication of the strength of the labour force
growth. The recovery of real GDP per capita to the
2008 level took indeed four years while real GDP
more than recovered after a year. One major
concern is that labour productivity growth has not
kept pace with these demand developments. Most
forecasters currently suggest potential growth of
Switzerland to be around or just under 2.0%.
However, hourly labour productivity growth
decreased from an average of 0.8% annually since
1999 to -0.2% since 2008. The current situation
seems neither supportive of further high labour
growth nor of further increases in capital inflows
through heightened risk aversion within the
developed markets portfolio of investors.
Productivity growth will hence be key to
maintaining high economic growth.

Other non-EU Countries, EFTA

Norway

The expectation at the time of the autumn forecast
that the growth dip registered end 2012 and early
2013 was temporary, has come true. However, the
recovery was not as speedily as expected, in
particular in fixed investment and exports. As a
consequence, estimated GDP growth for 2013 has
been revised downwards. The outlook for 2014
and 2015 is more favourable on the back of
increased expectations for export growth. The new
government has presented amendments to the
budget that are slightly more expansionary.
Monetary policy is accommodative although the
tightening of capital requirements is a welcome
counterbalance. Off-shore investment will
continue to provide an impetus, albeit at a
moderated pace, to manufacturing production but
the competitiveness of traditional manufacturing
will, in parallel, come under further pressure.
Private consumption demand will feel the strain
from less wealth effects stemming from house
price developments that appear to have reached a
high in 2013.

mid-2007 and mid-2009 banks have increased total
credit by around 15% of mainland GDP of which a
large part to households, while house prices fell by
about 15% relative to disposable income. Banks'
balance sheets were thus expanded at a time when
the value of houses was falling in a context of
declining interest rates. As a consequence, housing
had become more affordable. This created room
for house price increases even if banks' balance
sheets had deteriorated. When in the second
phase, from mid-2009, house prices started to rise
faster than disposable income, this was supported
by an increasing share of credit to households on
banks' balance sheets in a low interest rate
environment.
The biggest risk to the Norwegian economy is now
for a rise in interest rates to coincide with a
housing market that already started to cool down in
anticipation of increases in capital requirements.
Moreover, the net asset value of certain groups of
home owners is now relatively highly exposed to
changes in housing prices and interest rate
developments.

Real estate developments in Norway have gone
through two phases until 2013. First, between

38. RUSSIAN FEDERATION
Boosting investment remains a challenge
Russia recovered briskly after the financial crisis of 2008-09, but the pace of growth has since slowed,
reflecting both domestic and external weaknesses, such as the economy's over-reliance on commodity
exports, low investment, and lagging competitiveness. GDP growth dropped from 3.4% in 2012 to 1.3%
in 2013 but is expected to recover to around 2.3% in 2014 and 2.7% in 2015.
latter decreased marginally in 2013 to 10.1%, from
10.5% in 2012.

Weak performance in 2013

Real GDP growth slowed to reach 1.2% y-o-y in
the third quarter of 2013, and 1.3% for the year as
a whole. Economic growth was weighed down by
slowing private consumption, which decelerated
from close to 8% growth in 2012 to below 5% in
2013. However, the biggest negative surprise came
from private investment, which contracted by 0.3%
in 2013, compared to 6.4% growth in 2012.
Completion of large infrastructure projects carried
out by state owned companies (facilities for the
Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, the North Stream
pipeline) added to this slump.

pps.

A shift in the monetary policy strategy to inflation
targeting and a floating exchange rate is to be
completed by 2015. To increase exchange rate
flexibility, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR)
announced in January 2014 the end of "targeted"
intervention (aimed at neutralizing the volatility in
exchange rate arising from the external
environment), while "non-targeted" interventions
(aimed at non-fundamental factor driven
fluctuations) would still remain. After falling to
6.1% in September, inflation has picked up slightly
in recent months, reaching 6.5% in December
2013, exceeding the CBR target range of 5-6% for
2013.

Net exports
Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Trade has followed a trend of import growth
exceeding that of exports, although the gap seems
to be closing with the growth of exports picking up
to 3.8% in 2013 (from 1.4% in 2012) and growth
of imports declining from 8.8% in 2012 to 5.9% in
2013.
Fiscal and monetary policy

As half of the federal budget revenues come from
oil and gas related sources, the Russian economy
remains vulnerable to developments in oil prices.
The fiscal rule, which bases spending plans on the
long-term average oil price and caps the budget
deficit at 1% of GDP, has so far not led to a
significant reduction in the non-oil deficit. The

126

The prospect for 2014 is a moderate pick-up in
growth, reflecting both an improving global
outlook and positive expectations for the domestic
economy – as measured by a rising composite
Russian PMI at 52.5 in December 2013 (the
highest level since March 2013).
Household consumption growth is expected to
remain strong, albeit moderating slowly due to a
slightly negative trend in employment and an
increasing household debt burden, which puts
pressure on real disposable incomes. Government
consumption is expected to pick up slightly over
the forecast horizon, supported by government
plans to boost investment in infrastructure through
public-private partnerships, using money from the
National Welfare Fund.
A rebound in investment should be among the
main drivers of GDP growth in 2014-15. Private
investment is expected to return to positive
territory as the temporary factors that have dragged
the 2013 investment growth down (completion of
large one-off investment projects) will expire.
Russia's economy is widely considered to be
running close to capacity, which should underpin a
recovery in investment, though this is expected to

Other non-EU Countries, Russian Federation

be gradual given remaining weaknesses in the
business climate.
Export volume growth is expected to accelerate in
2014 and 2015 mirroring the anticipated recovery
in main export markets. Imports are set to pick up
on the back of higher final demand, although at a
slower pace than in the past, due to a weaker
exchange rate. The current-account surplus is
expected to gradually diminish by 2015.
A minor contraction in employment levels is
expected due to both demographic developments
(continuing decline in working age population) and
the lagged effect of the current slowdown.
Unemployment is expected to rise from 5.5% in
2013 to 5.9% in 2014 and to 6.2% in 2015. The
government aims to keep the federal budget deficit
at 0.5% of GDP in 2014 (unchanged from 2013),
increasing it to 1% of GDP for 2015.

The actual outcome of the budget balance depends
heavily on the price of oil, which is expected to
remain at above USD 100/barrel, although
gradually decreasing over the forecast horizon.
Inflation is expected to subside gradually in
2014-15, supported by a freeze in tariffs for natural
monopolies and broadly in line with CBR end-year
inflation targets of 5% in 2014 and 4.5% in 2015.
The weakening of the ruble, a consequence of
CBR’s transition towards fully flexible exchange
rate and uncertainty in emerging market
economies, poses a risk of a rise in imported
inflation. However, given relatively strong
economic fundamentals, recent financial turmoil is
not expected to cause major disruptions.

Statistical Annex

Note on concepts and sources
1. The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fullyfledged economic forecasts in Winter, Spring and Autumn.
These forecasts cover the principal macroeconomic
aggregates for the Member States, the candidate countries,
the European Union as a whole, the euro area and the
international environment.
2. Data for 2013, 2014 and 2015 are forecasts.
The source for all tables is the European Commission,
unless otherwise stated.
Historical data for the Member States are based on the European
System of Accounting (ESA 1995). Most Member States have
now introduced chain-linking in their national accounts to measure
the development of economic aggregates in volume terms.
For the USA and Japan the definitions are as in the SNA.
3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively,
present data including inventories.
4. In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for USA
and Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior to 1996.
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in
the capital stock and the difference between actual unemployment
and the NAWRU play a key role.
6. Employment data used in tables 23-29 and 32-33 are based on
full-time-equivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain, France
Italy, the Netherlands and Austria report FTE data. In the
absence of FTE data, employment is based on numbers of persons.
In the calculation of EU and euro-area aggregates, priority is given to
FTE data, as this is regarded as more representative of diverse
patterns of working time.
7. Source: National Accounts (ESA95). Discrepancies with balance
of payments statistics may arise due to methodological differences
and revision schedules.

the individual countries in the EU or the euro area. However,
intra-EU or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of
reporting errors. The creation of the internal market in 1993
reduced border controls and formalities, and accordingly the
scope and precision of intra-EU trade coverage. Typically,
intra-EU imports are underestimated compared to intra-EU exports,
leading to an overestimation of the surplus. For the past the
"adjusted" balances are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB
estimates for the euro area. For the future, they are ECFIN's
forecasts based on the extrapolation of the discrepancies
observed in 2012.
9. Geographical zones are defined as follows :
Euro area :
EA18 (BE, DE, EE, IE, EL, ES, FR, IT, CY, LV, LU, MT, NL, AT, PT, SI, SK and FI).
European Union :
EU28 (EA18, BG, CZ, DK, HR, LT, HU, PL, RO, SE and UK).
Candidate countries :
Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Iceland, Montenegro and Serbia.
Potential candidates :
Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Advanced economies :
EU, candidate countries, USA, Japan, Canada, Norway,
Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand.
MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :
Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates.
Asia :
All countries in that region except Japan and
the Asian MENA countries.
Latin America :
All countries in that region.
Sub-Saharan Africa :
All countries in that region except the African MENA countries.

8. EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates.
World GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS).
In the tables on world trade and international payments, the
aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates.
Tables 49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area "adjusted"
balances. Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area vis-à-vis
third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of
