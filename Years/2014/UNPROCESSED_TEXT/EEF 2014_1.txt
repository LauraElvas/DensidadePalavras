EDITORIAL
The EU economic outlook is strengthening. While leading indicators point to GDP growth gaining
momentum in the near term, the conditions for a sustained recovery in the medium term are also
improving. In view of the crisis legacy, growth is still set to remain moderate, but a gradual easing of the
drag related to deleveraging, financial fragmentation, adjustment of external imbalances and uncertainty
is noticeable. The improved economic outlook encompasses the vulnerable euro-area Member States,
where the impact of the crisis and adjustment needs had been the strongest. However, challenges and
vulnerabilities remain and require continued monitoring and policy action. Moreover, support from the
external side may turn out to be weaker than earlier anticipated. While growth in advanced economies is
generally firming, emerging market economies register a moderate deceleration, and world trade has hit a
soft patch amid a continued appreciation of the euro exchange rate. New geopolitical risks have emerged
on the back of tensions with Russia.
In the EU, the rotation towards domestic demand that started in the second half of 2013 is progressing.
Private consumption is again expanding, though at a slow pace. Improved confidence and falling energy
inflation provide some support in the short run. Sustained consumption growth will however depend
crucially on improvements in the labour-market situation. Even though joblessness is projected to decline
only slowly, there are encouraging signs of employment growth setting in, and of recent labour-market
reforms in vulnerable Member States starting to bear fruit. Investment has picked up more robustly than
consumption, and is set to strengthen further from a very low basis. The constraints that caused the large
investment shortfall since 2008 are gradually fading, as capacity utilisation is normalising, corporate debt
deleveraging has made progress and uncertainty has been abating. At present, the investment recovery is
however not supported by credit. This is not necessarily a major constraint in the very short run, as firms
typically use internal funds to finance investment in the early stages of a recovery. Further ahead, credit
supply conditions are expected to ease, as banks have been progressing with the repair of their balance
sheets and their funding conditions are good. Finally, after several years of frontloaded adjustment,
domestic demand also benefits from a broadly neutral budgetary policy for the euro area and the EU as a
whole.
Overall, the outlook has improved, but it remains conditional on continued credible action on several
fronts at national and EU levels. Recent structural reforms have increased the adaptability of labour and
product markets in a number of Member States. Even so, important adjustment challenges remain: recordhigh unemployment, concerns about a fair distribution of the adjustment costs, as well as a pace of the
recovery which is much slower than in other advanced economies could erode the support for
implementing further reforms. The necessary competitiveness adjustment and debt reduction in
vulnerable countries are more difficult to achieve with very low EU-wide inflation, in particular if it were
to persist over too prolonged a period. In "core" countries, reforms to strengthen domestic demand are
needed. Supervisors should encourage banks to exploit the benign market conditions to strengthen their
capital base so as to be in a better position to deal with the outcome of the AQR and stress tests this
autumn. At EU level, reforms to deepen capital markets so as to provide a complement to bank credit and
strengthen SMEs' financing will be important to sustain the recovery beyond the short term.
The present forecast is encouraging. But it would be a mistake to think that the efforts to rebuild the
European economy are behind us and one can relax the reform focus.

OVERVIEW
The economic outlook
is improving…

After being hit by a double-dip recession since 2008, there are genuine signs
that a more lasting recovery is now taking place in the EU and the euro area.
In recent months, confidence has improved and business indicators have
remained above their long-term levels supporting our central scenario of a
recovery that is gradually gaining strength and spreading across the EU.
Growth indeed turned positive in a large majority of Member States over the
course of last year and the outlook has improved even in the more vulnerable
ones. Revisions to the winter forecast are minor. Real GDP growth is
projected to advance with moderate momentum in 2014, at 1.6% and 1.2%
respectively in the EU and the euro area, before gaining some further speed
to respectively 2.0% and 1.7% in 2015. As expected, domestic demand is
strengthening as the legacy of the economic and financial crisis (deleveraging
and adjustment of external imbalances, uncertainty and financial
fragmentation) gradually fades. Labour market conditions have started to
improve and unemployment should continue to decline albeit very gradually
in most Member States. On the back of somewhat stronger-than expected
disinflationary trends in the first quarter of 2014, the forecast for inflation has

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2014

been trimmed slightly since the winter. HICP inflation in the EU and the euro
area is now expected to run at 1.0% and 0.8% respectively in 2014 and at
1.5% and 1.2% in 2015.
…despite a slightly less
favourable external
environment

Global growth is increasingly being driven by the improvements in advanced
economies, primarily the US, while emerging markets have been decelerating
amid growing uncertainty. Looking ahead, barring further geopolitical
tensions, global growth is expected to accelerate from 2.9% in 2013 to 3.5%
in 2014 and 3.8% in 2015. After some renewed softness in the first half of the
year, mostly due to poor weather in the US, growth in advanced economies
including the EU is expected to almost double between 2013 and 2014. In the
US, the recovery is expected to take hold, supported by a lower fiscal drag
and highly accommodative monetary policies. In Japan, growth is expected to
be sustained in 2014, but to slow in 2015 because of additional fiscal
consolidation measures and waning monetary stimulus. The situation in
emerging markets remains differentiated, reflecting divergent cyclical
patterns and structural vulnerabilities. The outlook for Russia, where a
slowdown was already underway, has markedly deteriorated since the start of
the crisis over Ukraine. To a lesser extent, the growth forecast for China has
also been cut as the rebalancing of the economy towards a more balanced
growth composition is likely to entail slower, but more sustainable, growth.
The recent weakness in world trade is expected to be temporary, as the
recovery of trade-intensive sectors should cause trade to start expanding more
rapidly than global output once again and add impetus to global growth.
World import growth is set to accelerate from 2.2% in 2013 to 4.4% in 2014
and 5.7% in 2015, with much of the impetus coming from advanced
economies. Strong demand from advanced economies also helped to keep
Brent crude oil prices high throughout the winter but a significant rebound in
prices is unlikely because supply remains sufficient and because of efficiency
gains in oil consumption. According to futures markets, Brent oil prices are
still expected to moderate over the forecast horizon though remaining at
higher levels than assumed in February. The nominal exchange rate of the
euro against main trading partners has appreciated slightly more than
expected in the winter forecast. Looking ahead, the technical assumption is
for the exchange rate to remain unchanged over the foreast horizon.

The recovery is
broadening…

In contrast to the sharp but short-lived upturn in 2010, the current recovery in
the EU and euro area is more balanced regionally, as it involves also most of
the vulnerable Member States. Real GDP growth in most EU countries is
projected to be positive as of this year (with the exception of Cyprus and
Croatia) and all Member States are expected to register positive growth next
year. Substantial, but receding, differences in economic performance will
remain. Among the largest economies, economic growth is expected to be
sustained in Germany while the recovery is firming in Spain and slowly
gathering pace in France and Italy. In the UK, growth is becoming firmly
established.

…and becoming
more self-sustained

While during the crisis, the main positive contribution to economic activity in
the EU and the euro area came from net exports, the recovery in most of the
EU Member States is now becoming more self-sustained as domestic demand
is firming up.
The expansion of gross fixed capital formation, notably equipment
investment, should increasingly benefit from improving sentiment and lower
uncertainty, continued benign funding conditions, and an improved outlook

for demand. However, investment growth in many countries will continue to
be dampened by high corporate debt levels and balance sheet consolidation
needs. Construction investment is set to resume, though at a slow pace, as
housing markets in most Member States with pronounced corrections have
bottomed out or are expected to do so over the next two years.
The moderate recovery in private consumption is expected to gain
momentum as confidence improves and disposable incomes rise as a result of
mild labour market improvements, lower inflation and less fiscal drag. The
recovery in private consumption should be more visible in 2015, once the
improvements in labour market conditions, including both stronger net job
creation and wage increases become more marked. Public consumption is
expected to deliver a marginal contribution to growth.
Intra-euro-area
rebalancing is
progressing

In the euro area as a whole, net trade's contribution to growth is set to fall
over the forecast horizon as the strengthening of domestic demand will draw
in imports. The Member States that had large current-account deficits in the
run-up to the crisis are expected to register further improvements in price
competitiveness. Nonetheless, their reliance on net trade is also expected to
slightly reduce as domestic demand picks-up more swiftly than expected
earlier on.

Despite benign
financial conditions
bank lending remains
weak

After a temporary weakening amid the emerging market turmoil early this
year, financial markets have seized on the relative strength of corporate
earnings to rebound to the point where the positivity of market sentiment may
be running ahead of economic fundamentals. Statements by main central
banks indicating their intentions to keep policy rates low until the economic
recovery is well entrenched have helped ease pressure on sovereign-bond
yields in the US and the euro area. Spreads within the euro area have
narrowed further, as investors have picked up bonds from vulnerable Member
States in the low interest rate environment. Euro-area corporate-bond spreads
have also narrowed further but falling inflation in the euro area means that
real interest rates have increased. The benign financial market developments
contrast with the still very weak bank lending. The euro area recovery has
indeed so far remained largely creditless, with firms financing their
investment internally or by issuing debt securities. The firming economic
recovery and successful Asset Quality Review and stress test exercises
should however herald an improvement in lending volumes over the forecast
horizon.

Fiscal consolidation is
showing results

Following substantial fiscal consolidation in 2011-13, the fiscal policy stance
is expected to be close to neutral in 2014. The deficit-to-GDP ratio is set to
decrease further in both areas to around 2½% of GDP this year, as the
recovery advances and additional deficit-reducing measures are being
implemented by Member States. However, the fiscal effort, measured in
terms of change of the structural balance, is expected to be broadly nil. The
debt-to-GDP ratios of the EU and the euro area are expected to peak this year
at 89.5% and 96.0% respectively, as continued improvement of primary
surpluses, combined with stronger economic growth, are expected to put debt
ratios on a downward path.

Labour markets
improve timidly…

Labour market conditions also started to improve in the course of 2013. With
output growth accelerating only slowly, and given the usual lagged response
of employment, little net job creation is expected in the short term. Private
employment growth is also still dampened by the remaining scope for firms
to adjust working hours, while public employment growth is set to remain

3

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2014

subdued. Employment growth in 2014 is expected to be limited, at 0.6% in
the EU and 0.4% in the euro area, though slightly better than projected in
winter. The unemployment rate is thus expected to decrease slightly in 2014
from its historical peak in 2013. In 2015, employment growth is set to
accelerate to 0.7% in both areas, resulting in a further slight reduction of
unemployment to around 10.1% in the EU and 11.4% in the euro area. Such a
slow decline mirrors the gradual recovery but could also reflect a higher
prevalence of structural unemployment than in the pre-crisis years. Large
differences in labour market performance would persist although
unemployment is set to decrease in a large majority of Member States.
…and price pressures
remain very low

The current low level of inflation in the euro area and the EU is the result of
both external factors, such as falling commodity prices and the euro’s rising
exchange rate, and internal ones, such as the weak economic environment,
macroeconomic adjustment in a number of Member States, and the expiration
of temporary increases of taxes and administered prices. Inflation at the
aggregate level is projected to remain low in the next quarters. In the near
term, quarterly inflation rates in some Member States are set to temporarily
fall to zero or even below that. Looking ahead, as the recovery progresses,
inflation is set to gradually rise - as unemployment falls and excess capacity
shrinks - although at a slow pace. Import prices are expected to only slightly
pick up in 2015, and limited inflation pressures are expected from labour
costs, as productivity growth is set to accelerate and wage growth to stabilise.
While in the short run, low inflation can support GDP growth by increasing
real disposable incomes, too prolonged a period of very low inflation
increases the real value of both private and public debt and can raise real
interest rates. It also makes the necessary relative price adjustment in the
vulnerable Member States more challenging.

Downside risks remain

Overall, risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. On the
domestic side, as the recovery advances, the risk that reforms crucial to the
recovery’s continuation and strengthening may be put off increases. Risks to
the outlook for emerging market economies persist, especially for those most
exposed to tighter financial conditions. Uncertainty has increased regarding
China's growth prospects and possibly its financial stability. Tensions with
Russia have increased geopolitical risks. Their impact will depend on the
duration and gravity of the situation.
HICP inflation could turn lower than envisaged in the central scenario, if
labour market conditions and commodity prices turned out weaker than
expected. However, the probability of outright deflation, defined as a
generalised and self-enforcing fall in prices in the euro area as a whole,
remains very low.
Upside risks to growth identified in the winter forecast are still valid.
Stronger growth in domestic demand could materialise if confidence
increases further and credit conditions improve faster than expected. The
substantial structural reforms that were undertaken in recent years may also
lead to better-than-expected labour-market results, particularly in the
vulnerable Member States. This would also lead to a faster normalisation of
inflation.

PART I
EA and EU outlook

GROWTH BECOMING BROADER-BASED
Last year saw the EU and the euro area pulling out of recession with real GDP increasing in the last
three quarters of the year. In the fourth quarter, real GDP grew by respectively 0.4% (q-o-q) in the EU
and 0.2% in the euro area. Real GDP is expected to continue recovering over the forecast horizon in the
EU and the euro area, with growth broadening across countries but also becoming more self-sustained
as domestic demand strengthens. Economic growth continues to be dampened by high private and
public debt, financial fragmentation, uncertainty and difficult adjustment, and it will take some more
quarters before GDP is back to its pre-crisis level of 2008. Real GDP growth is projected to advance
with moderate momentum in 2014, at 1.6% and 1.2% respectively in the EU and the euro area, before
gaining some further speed in 2015, to 2.0% in the EU and 1.7% in the euro area.
Labour market conditions have started to improve in the course of 2013, somewhat earlier than
expected. After declining for almost two years, employment showed some timid signs of revival at the
end of 2013, while unemployment rates have stopped increasing. Looking ahead, unemployment should
start gradually trending downwards, but remain at historically high levels, with large differences among
Member States. HICP inflation, which has been on a downward trend for several quarters, is expected
to remain low for some time, reflecting the existing slack in the economy together with the ongoing
competitiveness adjustment in a number of Member States. HICP inflation is expected to be 0.8% in the
euro area in 2014 and 1.2% in 2015, and to stand at respectively 1.0% and 1.5% in the EU.
Downside risks to the growth outlook remain, due to uncertainty stemming from the external
environment which has increased lately. On the domestic side, a stalling or only partial implementation
of structural, fiscal and institutional reforms at the EU and Member States levels could endanger the
recovery.

After being hit by a double-dip recession since
2008, there are genuine signs that a more lasting
recovery is now taking place in the EU and the
euro area. The recovery, however, remains
gradual, as the legacy of the economic and
financial crisis – high levels of debt,
unemployment, uncertainty and fragmentation –
continues to weigh. Revisions to the winter 2014

Economic expansion is set to continue in the EU
Member States in the coming quarters and gain
some strength as suggested by the latest readings
of economic indicators. Cyclical indicators,
notably the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI),
indeed picked-up strongly since last year and
confirm that activity has swung back into
expansionary territory in most countries, the rise
being the strongest in the vulnerable euro-area
Member States which suffered heavy output losses
(see graph I.3).

EU countries …

Real GDP in most EU countries is projected to
continue recovering in 2014 and 2015. Although
substantial differences in economic performance
will remain, the recovery is projected to become
more broad-based (see graph I.4). On average,
over the forecast period, most of the Member
States are expected to record annual growth rates
of at least 1%, the only exceptions being Cyprus,
Croatia, Finland and Italy. The median growth rate
is 1.8% in 2014-15, much higher than the 0.3% of
2013. The highest average annual growth rates

negative growth, compared to 15 a year earlier.
Supported by diminishing uncertainty and rising
business and consumer confidence, growth
returned in the course of last year, albeit hesitantly
in some cases, in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Slovenia
and Ireland. In Italy, real GDP continued shrinking
until the fourth quarter, when it managed to grow
by 0.1%. The recovery in Spain was very timid in
the second half of 2013, and in France it remains
in its early stages. So far growth in the EU as a
whole has been primarily pulled by the UK and
Germany, also in line with their respective large
weights in the EU aggregate.

The contribution of net trade to growth is expected
to become almost nil in 2015, and domestic
demand is set to emerge as the key growth driver.
As domestic demand rises, so do imports,
mechanically lowering net trade’s contribution.
Private investment is expected to play a key role,
supported by low interest rates and a revival of
demand. Besides, private consumption is likely to
regain some vigour as disposable income will be
backed by some increase in wages, particularly in
the countries where the unemployment rate is low
(notably in Germany).
In the vulnerable Member States, economic
expansion will remain primarily driven by net
exports in the coming quarters although domestic
demand also started to strengthen in the second
half of 2013. During the crisis years, net trade

prevented economic activity from tumbling while
domestic demand shrunk sharply as a result of
adjustments in the private and public sectors. (3)
Over the forecast horizon, the reliance on net trade
in these countries is expected to continue but to
decline slightly (see graph I.5) as domestic demand
gradually recovers. As confidence improves and
easier financing conditions for sovereigns and
banks slowly reaches borrowers, private
investment and consumption should pick-up.
Despite these positive developments, very high
levels of private and public indebtedness and
unemployment will continue to constrain
borrowing capacities thereby limiting the potential
of private and public demand.

As export competitiveness continues to increase
and domestic demand remains below unsustainable
pre-crisis trends, the current account is expected to
further improve in all vulnerable countries this
year and next, albeit more slowly. This is in line
with the need to further reduce the external
vulnerabilities of those countries as they still have
large negative net international positions.

… while competitiveness gains continue in the
vulnerable countries …

The strong export performance of the vulnerable
countries in recent years is mainly due to sharp
improvements in price competitiveness as
measured by nominal unit labour costs, and this
pattern is expected to continue (see graph I.6). This
is in turn mainly due to more moderate
developments in compensation per employee in
both the public and private sectors, since
productivity improvements are projected to remain
slow. Wage growth would continue to be subdued,
as the impact of high unemployment and
subsequent adjustment needs affect private wages
and consolidation pressures weigh on public
wages. It also reflects the impact of reforms,
including those modifying the wage bargaining
system.
(3)

While the current-account balance is projected to
improve for most euro-area countries over the
forecast
horizon,
particularly
sizeable
improvements are now only expected for Cyprus,
Luxembourg and Ireland. For Germany, Estonia,
Latvia and Germany, marginal decreases are
expected on average over 2014-15 compared to
2013. As the countries that recorded the largest
surpluses at the onset of the crisis are projected to
continue doing so, the current-account surplus of
the euro area should stand at about 3% of GDP in
2015, up from a roughly balanced position in 2008.
Most of the changes in current-account balances in
the recent years have been due to non-cyclical
factors. For instance, only about a quarter of
Spain’s current-account adjustment is estimated to
be due to the business cycle. At the current
juncture, the cycle contributes to increases in the
2014 surplus (or reductions in the deficit) in most
vulnerable, net debtor, economies, but also in
Denmark, France and the Netherlands. In contrast,
the current-account surpluses of Belgium,
Germany, Ireland and Austria would be even

The concomitant impact of deleveraging in the private and
public sectors drained domestic demand, leaving major
unused capacities in their wake.

Significant negative output gaps are expected to
remain at the end of the forecast horizon in the
vulnerable countries (except Ireland), while some
other euro-area countries, such as Germany,
Austria and Luxembourg are set to record close to
zero output gaps in 2015.

The external environment has become less
favourable than in the winter, as the outlook for
some emerging markets economies has
deteriorated, notably for Russia and to a lesser
extent China reflecting recent data and events.
Geopolitical risks are looming large.
Global growth remained firm at the end of 2013, as
world GDP expanded by 0.8% q-o-q in the fourth
quarter (5), down from 1.0% q-o-q in the third and
second quarters. The contribution from advanced
economies continued to strengthen, reaching close
to 0.3 pp. in the fourth quarter, the most in almost
four years, primarily driven by robust growth in
the US and the nascent recovery in the EU.
The early months of 2014 saw some renewed
softness in global activity. This reflected a mix of
temporary factors, such as poor seasonal weather
in the US, and what may be more medium-term
developments, such as a gradual slowdown in
growth in China. Looking ahead, barring further
geopolitical tensions, the underlying momentum of
global growth is expected to remain solid over the
forecast horizon, increasingly driven by the
improving performance of advanced economies.
Global GDP growth is expected to have reached
2.9% in 2013 and to accelerate to 3.5% in 2014
and 3.8% in 2015, with much of the impetus
coming from advanced economies.
Graph I.7:Contributions to World GDP growth from

The revision in the output gap estimates (see
box I.1) implies an increase in the cyclical
component of the current-account adjustment since
2007 in a number of Member States, though it is
small for most economies.

The cyclically-adjusted current-account balance is the
estimated balance if economic growth in both the economy
concerned and its trading partners was at potential. The
estimate relies on the output gap of a country relative to
that of its trading partners. See 2014 Winter Forecast, box

THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

Provisional quarterly release based on data accounting for
90% of global GDP.

EA and EU outlook

reflecting weaker activity in most parts of the
world and a persistent pattern of subdued trade
intensity of GDP growth. However, with global
economic growth expected to rebound from its
softer patch at the start of the year, global trade
volumes are projected to pick-up as well and to
accelerate faster than in 2013.
Looking ahead, trade growth is set to increase,
reflecting the gradual strengthening of the global
recovery, led by advanced economies. Moreover,
world trade is expected to resume expanding more
rapidly than global output in 2014 and 2015 as
trade-intensive sectors, such as investment
spending, start providing a greater impetus to

In Japan, the current level of growth is expected to
be sustained in 2014, with some variability in the
near term due to the hike in consumption taxes this
April. In 2015, growth is projected to slow on the
back of additional fiscal consolidation measures
and waning monetary stimulus.
… while emerging markets diverge and
downside risks to activity have increased.

The situation in emerging markets remains
differentiated, reflecting different cyclical patterns
as well as structural vulnerabilities. The financial
turbulence in January 2014 implied sharp currency
drops for a number of them and caused stock
markets to fall. Financial market pressure
subsequently abated, but tensions over the
situation in Ukraine have added to global
uncertainty. For Russia, where a slowdown was
already underway, the outlook has markedly
deteriorated since the start of the year, though the
precise impact of recent political developments
will depend on the duration and intensity of
geopolitical tensions. The outlook for countries in
the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has
also worsened amid renewed political tensions.

Output growth in advanced economies including
the EU is forecast to almost double from 1.2% in
2013 to 2.2% in 2014 and to further accelerate to
2.5% in 2015 (see Table I.2).
Among advanced economies outside the EU,
activity has been gathering momentum, notably in
the US, where a broad-based recovery is expected
to take hold supported by a lower fiscal drag and
the continuation of highly accommodative
monetary policies. Private consumption is
projected to firm thanks to an improving labour
market and lower deleveraging pressures, while
both business and residential investment are set to
accelerate on the back of attractive financing
conditions and improving business and consumer
confidence.

China's economy continued to grow rapidly in
2013, at 7.7%, with investment recovering sharply
from a low early in the year. However, GDP
growth slowed again in the first three months of
2014, to 7.4% y-o-y. With recent extremely high
rates of investment, the move of the economy
towards a more balanced growth composition is
likely to entail slower, but more sustainable,
growth. Over the forecast horizon, growth is
therefore projected to slow gradually to 7.2% in
2014 and 7.0% in 2015. In the short run, however,
outcomes would depend significantly on the policy
response to any sharp deterioration in activity.
Concerns over financial stability also remain
significant due to the build-up of credit in recent
years.
All in all, growth in emerging markets as a group
is still expected to accelerate, but more gradually
than assumed earlier, to 4.7% in 2014 and 5.1% in
2015, following growth of 4.6% in 2013.
Commodity prices expected to moderate

Brent crude oil prices remained elevated in the
winter, at USD 107-108/bbl., sustained by the
pick-up in demand in advanced economies.

heating demand in the US may be temporary, but
the surge in US demand may also reflect a
structural shift towards more energy intensive
sectors. Despite stronger demand from those
regions, a significant rebound in oil prices is
unlikely due to sufficient supply and efficiency
gains in oil consumption. Escalation of
geopolitical tensions is a risk factor. According to
futures markets, Brent prices are assumed to be the
following on average: USD 107.6/bbl. in 2014 and
USD 102.9/bbl. in 2015 (see box I.5).
The evolution of other commodity prices was
mainly weak in 2013. Owing to an improved
outlook for supply, food prices are expected to stay
moderate in 2014. Prices of metals and raw
materials declined in 2013. Metal prices are
projected to fall further in 2014 due to abundant
supply and weak demand conditions although a
modest recovery is expected in 2015.

FINANCIAL MARKETS IN EUROPE

Financial markets, globally and in the EU, have
regained strength after the emerging market
turmoil at the end of January. Markets found
support in the statements of central banks in the
US, the UK and the euro area to keep policy rates
low until the economic recovery is wellentrenched. Moreover, incoming corporate
earnings were in general strong. To some extent,
however, the current positive market sentiment

12

seems to be running ahead of economic
fundamentals, notably in Europe. More recently,
concerns about the Ukraine crisis have weighed on
market sentiment, although contagion to the EU
has been very limited.
Monetary

remains

The ECB in April kept its key policy rates
unchanged at the record-low level of 0.25% that
they have held since November 2013. Real shortterm interest rates have however increased in
recent months on the back of lower headline and
expected inflation. At the same time, the
Governing Council strengthened its forward
guidance and unanimously committed "to using
also unconventional instruments within its
mandate," should the risks of a too prolonged
period of low inflation become prominent. The
ECB also signalled that, in assessing the outlook
for price stability, it will closely monitor the
possible implications of geopolitical risks and
exchange rate developments. The ECB is pledging
"to maintain a high degree of monetary
accommodation and to act swiftly if required". In
the US, the phasing out of unconventional
monetary policy continued in March with the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) further
tapering its monthly bond purchases to USD 55 bn.
The US central bank also decided to shift from a
threshold-based forward guidance to a qualitative
forward guidance. US monetary policy is expected

EA and EU outlook

to remain highly accommodative over the forecast
horizon, as the FOMC anticipates that interest rates
will remain near zero "for a considerable time after
the asset purchase program ends" at the end of this
year.

… which keeps downward pressure on
sovereign-bond yields in the US and the euro
area …

Several factors contributed to the continuingly low
level of benchmark bond yields (see graph I.9):
somewhat disappointing macroeconomic data in
the US, low inflation in the euro area, and the
explicit commitment by central banks to keep
policy rates low for as long as necessary.
Sovereign-bond spreads in the euro area have
meanwhile narrowed amid the ongoing adjustment
of fiscal fundamentals and investors’ search for
higher yields. The persistently low interest rate
environment has continued to make some bonds an
attractive carry trade.

… while other market segments witnessed a
rise in risk-taking and lower volatility.

In the euro-area corporate bond markets, spreads
narrowed further, particularly in the higher-yield
segment (see graph I.10). European stocks have
risen on the back of strong corporate earnings.
Investors currently seem confident of further
economic expansion, a smooth implementation of
banking union, governments' commitments to
structural reforms, and the sustained balance sheet
repair of the banking sector. However, risks
persist, particularly among EU sovereigns. The
spread improvements enjoyed by countries with
modest economic growth, high levels of public
indebtedness, and in some cases, incomplete bank
balance-sheet adjustment, are fragile.

The European banking sector is under intense
scrutiny this year …

European banks are undergoing an Asset Quality
Review (AQR) and an EU-wide stress test before
the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will
start operating in November 2014. Although euroarea banks have improved their solvency positions
and turned to more stable funding sources,
profitability remains poor because of narrow
interest margins on the stocks of assets. It is
particularly a problem in countries facing a
combination of poor credit quality, high private
sector indebtedness, high unemployment and
subdued economic growth.
Investors remain cautious on European banks,
pricing them on average below book value.
Although poor valuation may relate to subdued
profitability prospects for euro-area banks, it also
relates to investor uncertainty over the quality of
banks' assets. This caution applies also to the
market funding for a number of mid-sized and
smaller euro-area banks in vulnerable countries.
While market funding has improved overall, some
banks still find it difficult or too expensive to
obtain medium- and longer-term funding.
… and bank lending remains weak.

The latest bank lending data confirm that the euro
area’s recovery has so far remained largely
creditless. Credit flows to the private sector shrank
over the past few months (-2% y-o-y in February
in the euro area once adjusted for sales and
securitisation) on the back of still extremely weak
lending volumes to non-financial corporates
(NFCs). However, net issuance of long-term debt
securities by non-financial corporations have
remained buoyant (+10% y-o-y in February in the

13

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2014

euro area), partly offsetting the weakness in bank
lending. While larger corporations have continued
their transition towards market financing, those
that are more dependent on banks, particularly
SMEs, have seen their external funding decrease.
The current weakness in bank lending is
influenced by both supply and demand factors. At
the same time, weak credit demand can still be
partly explained by the current cyclical position, as
credit to business tends to lag the business cycle
and internal funding plays a relatively large role in
the first stages of economic recoveries. More
structural factors, such as high corporate
indebtedness and the need to deleverage also
dampen credit demand and may continue to do so
for a longer period of time.
Bank lending conditions, although improving
slightly, are expected to remain highly fragmented,
in contrast to other market segments, such as the
sovereign- and corporate-debt markets (see
graph I.11), where fragmentation has declined
significantly. Regulatory uncertainties and banks'
efforts to advance with balance-sheet adjustments
ahead of the AQR and the stress test have likely
contributed to the limited supply of credit in some
countries. However, a successful AQR and stress
test could be instrumental in overcoming credit
supply constraints, with positive impact on loans
growth also in the vulnerable countries where
financial fragmentation is still elevated. Survey
data also convey a somewhat more positive
message than data on lending volumes and interest
rates. Since the beginning of 2014, banks have
started to predict an end to the net tightening of
credit standards on loans to NFCs, further easing
for loans to households and a pick-up in loan
demand.

GDP AND COMPONENTS

The recovery of GDP is gradually broadening
…

Last year saw the EU and the euro area pulling out
of recession with real GDP increasing from the
second quarter on. Although in the fourth quarter,
real GDP in the EU was 1.1% higher than in the
first quarter, respectively 0.7% for the euro area,
due to a large negative carry-over from 2012 the
resumption of growth was somewhat masked in
the 2013 annual GDP growth rates that stood at
0.1% in the EU and -0.4% in the euro area. Full
recovery from the Great Recession of 2008/2009 is
also still some time away in both areas. Compared
to the pre-crisis peak of the first quarter of 2008,
real GDP in EU and in the euro area was still 1.7%
and 2.0% lower in the fourth quarter of 2013. Real
GDP in both areas is likely to return to pre-crisis
levels by end 2014 at the earliest, a duration in
keeping with the experience of similar deep
financial crises.
Domestic demand became an increasingly
important source of growth in 2013. While net
exports were the main driver of the EU and euro
area’s revival in the second quarter, it was the rise
in total investment that led domestic demand and
GDP growth in the third. Gross fixed capital
formation gathered pace in the fourth quarter,
while private consumption continued to expand
marginally. Changes in inventories were a
substantial drag on growth in the fourth quarter,
arguably mirroring the strong positive contribution
of net trade and cancelling it out. (6)
(6)

3.5

14

All in all, the more upbeat survey-based signals
and the firming economic recovery could herald an
improvement in lending volumes. However, the
amplitude of the expected recovery of credit may
be smaller than in previous credit cycles. (see
box I.2).

A strong negative correlation is regularly observed between
net trade and inventories, broadly reflecting the mechanical
impact of export and import flows on inventories when
goods cross borders. Thus, the acceleration in trade flows
results in net trade contributions to growth that are partly
offset by changes in inventories.

… with subdued growth continuing in the short
term, before gathering pace.

The economic recovery is expected to continue
this year, slowly gathering pace. In the first
quarter, GDP should grow in the EU and the euro
area, at respectively 0.4% q-o-q and 0.3%, in line
with the latest positive signals from economic
indicators. In recent months, business indicators
have increased further, stabilising above their
long-term levels. In the first quarter of this year,
confidence rose in the services and retail sectors as
well as for consumers. By contrast, industrial
confidence remained almost stable, at a level
mildly above average suggesting a gradual
recovery. The euro area Flash Composite PMI
index showed a more optimistic picture, signalling
the highest rate of expansion in almost three years
in April (see graph I.12). These mixed signals
underpin the expectation that the recovery should
continue to be uneven in the short term.
As domestic demand expands and global growth
strengthens, GDP is forecast to rise by 1.6% in the
EU and 1.2% in the euro area this year. While
stronger global growth should support exports and
thereby economic activity, domestic demand will
increasingly take centre stage as the legacy of the
financial and economic crisis fades. The expansion
of gross fixed capital formation should benefit
from improving sentiment and lower uncertainty,

Private
consumption is expected to gain some momentum
as labour markets stabilise and real disposable
incomes increase in a context of low inflation.
Progress with fiscal consolidation should also
allow public consumption to deliver a marginally
positive contribution to growth after contracting in
2011 and 2012 and expanding only modestly in
2013.

increase by 4.7% in the EU and by 4.2% in the
euro area, mainly supported by the pick-up in
equipment investment.
Inventories: any support to growth in the
current recovery?

The modest pick-up in growth in the EU since
spring 2013 may have impacted on the levels of
companies' inventories. The rebound brought not
only the end of destocking (7), which was observed
in the first half of 2013 when inventories were kept
almost unchanged, but also the build-up of
inventories, notably in the third quarter. Further
out, the decline in inventories throughout the latest
recession provides scope for some restocking
ahead in line with a standard inventory cycle.
Survey-based information on the assessment of
stocks levels, such as in the Commission surveys
and the PMI also support this interpretation but
still need to be confirmed by hard data.

Capacity utilisation rate (rhs)

Investment growth should accelerate over the
forecast horizon as domestic demand picks up and
uncertainty further abates. Improved financing
conditions should support equipment investment,
as will the continued availability of internal
funding, which should grow as margins and profits
improve along with the economy. In addition, the
replacement of ageing capital stocks following
years of sharp investment declines, should more
than offset the ongoing process of production
offshoring. However, investment growth will
continue to be dampened by high corporate debt
levels and balance sheet consolidation needs in
many countries, as well as the rise in real interest
rates caused by recent disinflation. All in all, in
2014, equipment investment is expected to grow
by 4.9% in the EU and by 4.7% in the euro area,
accelerating to around 6½% in both areas in 2015,
still below pre-crisis levels.
Construction investment is set to resume
expanding in 2014 and to accelerate in 2015.
Housing market adjustment is expected to provide
less drag (see box I.3) but disposable income
growth is expected to remain limited. A strong
decline in construction investment is still expected
for Cyprus and Spain in 2014. Public investment is
expected to remain rather subdued on average over
the forecast years, stabilising in the EU and
contracting in the euro area, because governments
still need to shore up their finances. Overall, in
2015, total gross fixed capital formation is set to

Only marginal private consumption dynamics
at the onset of the recovery …

Private consumption has also started to recover
very modestly, increasing at an average quarterly
rate of 0.1% in the EU and euro area over the last
three quarters of 2013. The improvement was
broad-based across countries, with consumption
also returning to positive territory in vulnerable
countries such as Spain and Portugal, after several
quarters of sharp falls. In the EU, the resumption
of growth over the course of 2013 offsets the
negative carry-over from 2012 to end up with a flat
annual development (0.0%), while in the euro area,
the annual growth rate remained negative (-0.7%)
but much less so than in 2012.
The subdued private consumption dynamics in
2013 mirrored the squeeze in real gross disposable
incomes, linked to muted labour market
developments.
More
precisely,
nominal
compensation of employees grew only marginally
in the EU and the euro area on the back of
moderate rises in compensation per employee
(1.7% in both areas) and shrinking employment
(-0.4% and -0.9% respectively). Besides, nonlabour incomes increased only slightly and private
wealth was constrained by still weak housing
markets. Tight borrowing constraints and low
liquidity forced households to cut back on
consumption, particularly in countries with highly
leveraged households. At the same time,

… to be followed by a stronger expansion as
the recovery takes ground.

Public consumption to deliver a limited but
positive contribution to growth

Private consumption is set to continue growing
moderately in the coming quarters. Short-term
indicators support this outlook. The consumer and
retail trade confidence indicators from the
Commission survey notably increased steadily for
the last year, and were well above their long-term
averages in March (see graph I.16). Yet,
households' intentions to make major purchases
stayed below their long-term averages, suggesting
that consumers are still cautious.

Following the years 2011 and 2012 that were
dominated by major fiscal consolidation
government consumption resumed expansion in
2013 in both the EU (0.4%) and the euro area
(0.2%). Looking at the components of government
consumption, expenditure related to compensation
of employees declined in real terms, in comparison
to social transfers, which account for about half of
public expenditure and which increased relatively
strongly by about 2½%.

Private consumption, forecast (annual data, lhs)

As the need for fiscal consolidation diminishes,
about half of the Member States, including five of
the seven largest, should be able to expand general
government consumption, at least moderately more
than in 2013. However, declines in public
consumption are still expected in Ireland, Greece,
Spain, Cyprus, and Portugal throughout the
forecast horizon. All in all, at the aggregate level,
government consumption is set to continue
growing in 2014 by 0.7% in both the EU and the
euro area. In 2015, under the no-policy-change
assumption, a similar moderate increase in both
areas is expected.

Consumer confidence (rhs)

Over the forecast horizon, private consumption is
expected to gain some momentum from rising real
disposable incomes, being the result of slightly
improving labour market conditions, lower
inflation, in particular in 2014, as well as a
diminishing fiscal drag. However, many
constraining factors remain in place preventing a
marked pick-up in household spending.
Deleveraging has not been completed yet and
households in several countries still face credit
constraints, a problem that is reflected in high
levels of non-performing loans. Despite high
unemployment, the saving rate is expected to
decline in 2014 at the EU and the euro levels as
households dip somewhat into their savings to
sustain spending behaviours. The saving rate of
households would broadly stabilise in 2015 in both
areas. Overall, private consumption this year is
expected to rebound only slightly by 1.2% in the
EU and 0.8% in the euro area. In 2015, with labour

The recovery has so far been mostly export-led
…

Over the course of 2013, net trade lifted growth by
0.5 pp. in both the EU and the euro area, while
domestic
demand
(excluding
inventories)
continued to act as a strong drag. Looking at
quarterly developments within the year, this
picture remains broadly valid, indicating that the
recovery has so far been mostly export-led.
Exports grew relatively strongly, particularly in the
fourth quarter. Despite the high volatility in export
figures, it seems that the ongoing appreciation of
the euro was more than offset by competitiveness
gains and the pick-up in external demand, notably
led by the US economy. Import growth was much
lower over the year, despite the revival of domestic
demand, so net trade growth was positive.

EA and EU outlook

… but the contribution of net exports should
lessen going forward.

Labour

conditions

In the short term, further export growth is expected
from increasing foreign demand for EU products.
In fact, manufacturing export order books from the
Commission's surveys have markedly improved,
and remained above their long-term average in
March in both areas (see graph I.17). EU exports
are expected to increase 4.0% in 2014 and 5.1% in
2015, whereas euro area exports are expected to
rise slightly faster, by 4.0% and 5.3% over the
same time periods.

The unemployment rate began to stabilise in early
2013 in the euro area, at a peak level of close to
12%. In the EU, the unemployment rate started to
fall from its peak of 10.9% and reached 10.6% in
February 2014, still a very high level.

A similar acceleration is expected for import
growth, which should go up markedly in 2014 and
2015 to about 3¾% and about 5½% respectively in
both areas, as domestic investment, which tends to
be relatively import-intensive compared to
consumption, spurs domestic demand growth. The
contribution of net exports is expected to diminish
over time from ½ pp. in 2013 to ¼ pp. in 2014 and
further to 0.1 pp. in 2015 in both areas.

LABOUR MARKET CONDITIONS

Labour market conditions started to improve in
2013, albeit from a particularly bad situation. After
declining for almost two years, employment (i.e.
the number of persons employed) increased
slightly in the fourth quarter of 2013, by 0.1%
(q-o-q) in both the EU and the euro area, while
unemployment rates stopped increasing in early
2013.

stopped

The youth unemployment rate has also started to
decline. In February 2014, it fell to 22.9% in the
EU and 23.5% in the euro area, respectively
0.7 pp. and 0.5 pp. lower than a year earlier.
Though youth unemployment reacts particularly
strongly to the economic cycle (8), this recent
decline should not be interpreted too positively as
it also reflects some discouragements effects.
The timid improvement in net job creation at the
end of 2013 does not make itself felt in the annual
figures and employment fell by 0.4% in the EU
(-0.9% in the euro area) in 2013. In both zones,
labour shedding was concentrated in the industry
and construction sectors while net job creation
picked up in the service sector in the EU. At the
end of 2013, aggregate employment in the EU,
remained six million below its 2008 level, and its
recovery is set to be protracted.
… and the reallocation of resources from the
non-tradable to the tradable sector is ongoing.

In the vulnerable countries, where unemployment
has surged in recent years, there are some signs of
improvement in the labour market. Over the course
of 2013, employment in the tradable sector seems
to have stopped declining, notably in Spain and
Portugal, while in Ireland, net job creation even
resumed. This means that the resources are being
reallocated to the most productive sectors of the
economy. In fact, employment in the non-tradable
sector has continued to fall in parallel in Spain and
Portugal, particularly in the construction sector,
even if the speed of contraction has decelerated. In
Ireland, the shrinking of employment in the nontradable sector seems over, as employment is also
growing there, including in construction. Overall,
the reallocation of resources from the non-tradable
to the tradable sectors should continue over the
forecast horizon, but will likely remain gradual
given the economic growth remains weak.

Continued slow improvements are expected in

With output growth accelerating only slowly, and
given the usual lagged response of employment to
output fluctuations, little net job creation is
expected in the short term. Most survey measures
of hiring intentions have continued to increase in
recent months but remain at low levels (see
graph I.18). In industry and services, employment
expectations in the EU and euro area exceeded
their long-term averages in March, but they remain
below in the construction sector. Consumers'
unemployment fears have continued falling in
recent months.

Employment growth in 2014 is expected to remain
subdued, at 0.6% in the EU and 0.4% in the euro
area. It is projected to accelerate to 0.7% in both
areas in 2015 (see table I.5). Private employment
growth will remain dampened by the remaining
scope of firms to increase employees' working
hours, which are still slightly below their pre-crisis
level, before hiring new staff. Moreover, the still
limited access to funding for SMEs in some
countries could also have a negative impact on
their hiring decisions; and those firms usually have

20

a leading role in employment creation. In line with
the projections for slow growth of public
consumption (section 4), public employment
growth, especially in the euro area, is set to remain
subdued.
The labour force in the EU and the euro area is
estimated to grow moderately in 2014-15 as in
2013, mirroring the evolution of the working age
population. Cross-country differences are expected
to remain significant, with the labour force
growing strongly in some countries and declining
sharply in some others, notably reflecting
diverging migration flows in line with different
labour market conditions.
Labour productivity (output per person employed)
is expected to increase gradually over the forecast
horizon, as is usually the case in the first phases of
a recovery, to respectively 1.2% and 1.0% in the
EU and the euro area in 2015.
Unemployment is set to decline further but
remain high …

The unemployment rate is expected to decrease
slightly in 2014 to 11.8% in the euro area, and
10.5% in the EU, after reaching historical peaks in
2013 of 12.0% and 10.8% respectively. In 2015,
the unemployment rate is expected to further
decline in line with the pick-up in employment, to
11.4% in the euro area and 10.1% in the EU, but to
remain at very high levels (see graph I.19).
The slow decline reflects the fragility of the
recovery and probably a higher prevalence of
structural unemployment than in the pre-crisis
years. There are concerns that long-term
unemployment will have a long-lasting impact on
skills and future employability, particularly for
youth. Growing skills and sector mismatches have
also been identified as drivers of structural
unemployment. Those concerns are mirrored by

EA and EU outlook

the rise in the Non Accelerating Wage Rate of
Unemployment (NAWRU) which is the level of
unemployment associated with stable wages.
According to Commission estimates, this rate has
increased substantially since 2008 and will
continue to rise slightly over the forecast horizon.
Even when removing the cyclical component of
the NAWRU, research shows that structural
unemployment has been on the rise in recent years
(see box I.4).

INFLATION DEVELOPMENTS

Annual consumer-price inflation in the EU and the
euro area has fallen below 1% in the last quarter of
2013. The first quarter of 2014 witnessed a further
decline to 0.6% in the euro area and 0.8% in the
EU, with headline inflation in the euro area falling
to a mere 0.5% in March (see graph I.21).
Notwithstanding the general low-inflation
environment, the March decline in prices can be
partly attributed to statistical base effects linked to
the timing of Easter in 2013. (9) Compared to the
winter, HICP inflation in the euro area and the EU
was revised slightly down, by 0.2 pp. in 2014 and
the forecast remained broadly unchanged for 2015.

labour cost, and a substantial drop in non-energy
industrial goods inflation, reflecting additionally
declining import prices.

costs. As the cyclical situation and institutional
setup in labour markets differs substantially across
Member States, price pressures will differ
accordingly.
Sustained period of low inflation ahead

Very low external and pipeline price pressures

The appreciation of the euro, combined with
decreases in global commodity price inflation, has
driven external price pressures substantially down
in 2013. (10) Import prices (measured by the
deflator of imports of goods) fell by 1¾% in the
EU and by close to 2% in the euro area and should
continue declining in 2014, given the still weak
domestic demand and the assumed paths of
commodity prices and exchange rates. In 2015,
with the expected stronger pick-up in global
demand, import-price inflation is forecast to
accelerate somewhat to 0.8% in both the EU and
the euro area.
Price pressures on the side of producers have also
diminished substantially over 2013, with annual
producer price inflation falling by 1.7% in
February 2014, driven by marked falls of prices in
the energy and intermediate goods sectors.
However, sale prices continued to increase in the
final stages of the production chain (notably in
non-durable consumer goods), suggesting some
increase in margins. Assuming a partial passthrough of producer prices to consumer prices, this
foreshadows continuing low inflationary pressures
in the months ahead.

Economic agents' expectations as to future price
developments play a major role in their pricesetting and wage-bargaining behaviour, thus in
explaining overall HICP inflation. (11) These
expectations may be influenced by current low
readings of headline inflation.
Short- and medium-term inflation expectations
continued their downward trend in early 2014,
signalling low but positive inflation developments
in the years ahead. Inflation-linked swap rates at
the one-year-forward-one-year-ahead horizon
dropped slightly below 1% in March. At the threeyears-forward-three-years-ahead horizon, they
would currently imply an average inflation rate of
1.6% (taken at face value). Consumers' inflation
expectations also trended downwards, reaching the
lowest level in three and a half years in March, and
continuing to indicate low inflation in the short
term. Long-term inflation expectations based on
inflation-linked swap rates (five-years-forwardfive-years-ahead) remain well-anchored, although
they declined very slightly to 2.1% in March (see
graph I.22).

Price pressures from labour costs set to be
limited amid weak labour markets

The slack in the labour market (see previous
section) and the necessary competitiveness
adjustment in many Member States are exerting an
important downside strain on wage developments.
Compensation per employee in the EU and the
euro area slowed to 1.7% in 2013, outpacing
productivity growth but, leading nevertheless to

accelerate within the forecast horizon and wage
growth to stabilise, unit labour cost growth is
expected to decelerate even further, implying on
average limited inflation pressures from labour

EA and EU outlook

inflation is set to rise very progressively in the EU,
from 0.8% in the first quarter of 2014 to 1.2% in
the fourth quarter of the same year, before
reaching 1.5% in the final quarter of 2015. In the
euro area, the quarterly profile would be for the
respective quarters 0.6%, 1.0% and finally 1.3%.
All in all, HICP inflation is set to stand at 1.0% in
the EU and 0.8% in the euro area in 2014 and at
1.5% and 1.2% respectively in 2015.

consumption. Finally, very low aggregate euroarea inflation can make the necessary relative price
adjustment in the vulnerable Member States more
challenging.

PUBLIC FINANCES

In 2013, the general government deficit decreased
by 0.6 pp. in the EU and by 0.7 pp. in the euro
area, to 3.3% and 3.0% of GDP respectively.
Given the modest nominal GDP growth in 2013,
this reduction was mainly attributable to the

Headline deficits continue to fall …

Headline deficits are expected to continue falling
in 2014 in the EU and the euro area, at a similar
pace to 2013, as the recovery advances and given
additional deficit-reducing measures having been
adopted or being implemented by Member States.
The deficit reduction in the EU (0.7 pp.) is slightly
larger than in the euro area (0.5 pp.). (13) For the
first time since 2008, the headline deficit is thus
projected to decline below the Treaty deficit
threshold of 3% of GDP and more precisely to
2.6% of GDP in the EU and to 2.5% in the euro
area. Under the no-policy-change assumption, the
general government deficit is projected to decrease
only mildly in 2015 in the EU and the euro area
(see graph I.25).

Inflation at the aggregate level is thus projected to
remain low in the next quarters. In the near term,
in some Member States, quarterly inflation rates
are set to temporarily fall to zero or even below
that (see graph I.23). In some countries, this is
linked to the price adjustments necessary to restore
competitiveness vis-à-vis trading partners (see
graph I.24). In the short run, low inflation can
support GDP growth by increasing real disposable
incomes, which can in turn boost consumption.
However, too prolonged a period of low inflation
also increases the real value of both private and
public debt and can raise real interest rates. This
makes deleveraging more difficult and may

With regard to EU budgetary surveillance 11 countries are

Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Romania,
and Sweden.
This is attributable to the fact that Poland is moving from a
deficit of 4.3% of GDP in 2013 to a surplus of 5.7% in
2014, largely due to a one-off operation related to the
transfer of assets from the privately owned second pillar of
the pension system to the first pillar located within the
general government sector.

From revenue to expenditure-based fiscal
consolidation

While in the EU as a whole, the reduction of
general government expenditure and the increase
in revenues contributed equally to the reduction of
the headline deficit in 2013, in the euro area, the
improvement of the headline deficit continued to
be almost exclusively due to revenue-driven, as it
was the case in the period 2011-12. In both areas,
the main contribution to the increase in public
revenues was provided by taxes on income and
wealth. As of 2014, expenditure cuts are set to
become the main factor underlying the
improvement of the headline deficit in both areas,
although in the EU revenue increases are expected
still to contribute slightly to the budgetary
adjustment.

The revenue ratio is projected to increase mildly
this year in the EU, to 45.8% of GDP, before
starting to come down in 2015, as temporary tax
increases are projected to expire and limited tax
cuts are planned in some Member States (see
graph I.26). In the euro area, the forecast is for a
small decrease of the revenue ratios in both years,
to 46.5% of GDP in 2015. With regard to
government spending, the expenditure-to-GDP
ratio is set to decrease by more than ½ pp. in 2014
to 48.4% and 49.2% in the EU and the euro area
respectively. This trend is likely to continue in
both areas in 2015. The pick-up in economic
activity is likely to induce a reduction in
expenditure related to automatic stabilisers,
alongside discretionary expenditure cuts via wages
and intermediate consumption.
Public debt ratio reaching a peak in 2014

In the euro area, the increase of the debt-to-GDP
ratio in 2013 could be mainly ascribed to the socalled snow-ball effect, in particular the
contribution of interest expenditure – which was
significant even if a bit lower than in previous

The "snow-ball effect" captures the impact of interest expenditure on accumulated debt, as well as the impact of real GDP growth and inflation on the debt

and other residual effects.

In 2014, the debt ratio is forecast to increase
somewhat, as a higher primary surplus coupled
with the strengthening economic recovery are
expected to only partially compensate for the debtincreasing impact of the stock-flow adjustment and
interest expenditure. Only at the end of the forecast
period, the expected continued improvement of the
primary surplus combined with a further
strengthening of economic growth is forecast to
put debt on a downward path. Following
significant rises in recent years, the debt-to-GDP
ratio is thus projected to increase somewhat further
in 2014 in the euro area, to 96.0% of GDP, before
decreasing slightly, to 95.4% in 2015. The EU is
expected to follow a similar trend of another slight
rise in the debt ratio in 2014, before an expected
decrease will put an end to the upward movement
in the debt ratio observed since 2008.

8.

RISKS

The strengthening of the EU recovery in the latest
quarters is manifest. Yet downside risks to the
outlook remain. Since the winter forecast new
downside risks have also emerged, mainly arising
from external sources.
One of the main domestic risks to growth remains
the stalling or only partial implementation of
structural, fiscal and institutional reforms at the
Member States and the EU level, which are crucial
to sustain and strengthen the ongoing recovery. As
the recovery advances with strong financial
momentum and yield-hungry capital flowing into
vulnerable
countries,
the
pressure
for
implementing substantial but unpopular reforms is
decreasing. Yet, recent benign financial market

conditions could turn again more challenging if
growth were to disappoint.
Risks of a less supportive external environment
have recently increased. In China, very high credit
growth has led to concerns about financial stability
and the sustainability of the current growth
momentum. Risks to the outlook for other
emerging market economies persist. In particular,
they remain exposed to tighter financial conditions
resulting from the gradual normalisation of
monetary policy in advanced economies, weaker
commodity prices, as well as potentially a more
marked slowdown in Chinese growth. More
recently, tensions with Russia have increased
geopolitical risks. They have already dented the
growth outlook for Russia, but a sharper economic
slowdown, due to financial disruption and
confidence effects, cannot be excluded. Should
further rising tensions with Russia lead to major
disruptions in oil and gas supplies with a sharp rise
in prices, the negative impact on a number of
Member States could be sizeable.
As to HICP inflation, persistently weak labourmarket conditions could put downward pressure on
prices, which could be amplified by a further
decline in short-term inflation expectations.
Moreover, the large amount of economic slack in
the economy may still add more pronounced
disinflationary pressures than expected based on
past experience. On the external side, slower
growth in emerging markets could drive
commodity prices lower.
The risk of outright deflation, defined as a
generalised and self-reinforcing fall in prices in the
euro area as a whole, remains low. For such a
scenario to materialise, inflation would have to
drop sharply to almost zero in the core countries of

25

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2014

the euro area. Shocks that would trigger such a
drop in core inflation are very unlikely.
Upside risks to growth identified in the winter
forecast are still valid. Stronger domestic demand
growth in both the core countries of the EU and the
vulnerable ones could materialise if confidence
increases further and credit conditions improve
faster than expected. The overall improvement in
financial market conditions could translate more
quickly than assumed into improved bank lending
conditions, and the AQR and stress tests could
restore confidence in the banking system faster,
boosting credit growth. A stronger-than-expected
boost to growth could come from substantial
structural reforms that were undertaken in recent
years, which may lead to better-than-expected
labour-market results particularly in the vulnerable

Member States. Would such positive risks to
growth materialise, the worrying prospect of
persistently very low inflation would be
correspondingly mitigated.

EA and EU outlook

Box I.1: The revised methodology for calculating output gaps
The production function methodology, endorsed by
the ECOFIN Council, is the reference method for
the calculation of the output gaps used by the
Commission for a wide range of analytical and
policy purposes, including for fiscal surveillance. A
change to one specific part of the methodology,
namely the method for calculating the non-cyclical
component of unemployment, was recently
unanimously approved by the EPC. Estimates
based on the revised method are reported, for the
first time, in the present forecast.
The non-cyclical part of unemployment is an
important element of the overall potential growth
rate calculation, with knock-on implications for the
output gap and structural budget balance estimates.
The present box explains the change in the method
and highlights the impact on the latter variables. (1)
The Commission relies on the Phillips curve
approach to estimate the non-cyclical part of
unemployment. In such models, cyclical
unemployment (i.e. the unemployment gap) is
linked to labour cost developments, whilst noncyclical unemployment is assumed not to be
affected by labour cost developments and is
commonly referred to as the ‘non-accelerating
wage rate of unemployment’ (NAWRU). (2)
Importantly, the Phillips curve can be specified in
various ways, reflecting different assumptions
regarding the formation of expectations.
The Commission has recently extended its Phillips
curve framework by considering the case of
rational expectations (3) whilst in the past only static
or adaptive expectations were considered. The
motivation for extending the framework stems from
evidence that the rational expectations specification

(3)

For further details on this methodological change, see
"New estimates of Phillips curves and structural
unemployment in the euro area", Quarterly Report on
the Euro Area, Vol.13, Issue 1, April 2014, European
Commission.
The Phillips curve features a relationship between the
unemployment gap and an inflation or labour cost
variable. In the case of an inflation variable, the noncyclical unemployment estimate obtained is usually
referred to as the ‘non-accelerating inflation rate of
unemployment’ (NAIRU), whilst with a labour cost
variable, it is referred to as the ‘non-accelerating
wage rate of unemployment’ (NAWRU).
See J. Gali (2011), The return of the wage Phillips
curve. Journal of the European Economic
Association Vol 9/3, pp. 436-461. Note, however,
Gali only considers the case with non stochastic
productivity growth.

More specifically, the so-called traditional
Keynesian Phillips (TKP) curve, based on static or
adaptive expectations, implies that a positive
) is associated with a
unemployment gap (
fall in the change of the growth rate of nominal unit
) (and vice versa):
labour costs (∆2
∆2 nulct = −β ugapt (1)
A number of assumptions enter this formulation,
namely that nominal wage growth fully adjusts to
labour productivity growth and to expected
inflation when there is no unemployment gap (with
expected inflation proxied by nominal unit labour
cost growth in the previous period). The new
Keynesian Phillips (NKP) curve, based on rational
expectations, implies that a positive unemployment
gap is associated with a fall in the growth rate of
real unit labour costs (∆
). Lagged effects are
also relevant because some wage setters may use ad
hoc rules and not fully optimise:
Δrulct = δ∆rulct−1 − β1 ugapt + β2 ugapt−1 (2)

As can be seen from eq. (1) (4), the TKP
specification can only generate a positive
unemployment gap if wage inflation declines over
time (relative to labour productivity growth). The
reason for this is an implicit assumption that wage
setters expect inflation to adjust quickly to a fall in
the growth rate of nominal wages. In these
circumstances, a low but constant nominal wage
growth would therefore indicate that wage setters
are intent on stabilising expected real wage growth
(and do not wish to further adjust real wages in
order to close the unemployment gap). Thus only a
deceleration of nominal wage growth (or nominal
unit labour costs) is signalling a positive
unemployment gap.
The NKP in contrast uses real unit labour cost
growth directly (see eq. (2)) as an indicator of the
unemployment gap and does not make a specific
assumption about the speed of the price adjustment
which wage setters expect when setting wages.
Instead it is assumed that wage setters are well
informed about current price inflation (e.g. by
using information from professional forecasts).
(4)

In the estimation, additional explanatory variables are
used, in particular a term of trade indicator, in order
to capture the fact that wages may adjust to changes
in consumer prices.
(Continued on the next page)

27

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2014

Box (continued)

Note that especially when nominal wages fall
strongly and prices show some inertia, the NKP
indicator (i.e. ∆
) declines more strongly (and
persistently) than the TKP indicator (i.e. ∆2
),
thus signalling a larger unemployment gap and a
less pro-cyclical NAWRU.
The different behaviour of the two indicators in
periods of large labour market adjustments can be
and ∆
for
illustrated by comparing ∆2
the case of Spain. Graph 1 shows that while the
TKP indicator moved back rapidly to zero after
2009, the NKP indicator posted a more protracted
negative development, indicating more persistent
cyclical deviation in the Spanish labour market.

Note that these two indicators only diverge
occasionally, with Graph 1 pointing to similar
developments in Spain before the crisis and for the
EA as a whole, generally. This confirms that the
different evolution across the two indicators is
associated with episodes of large labour market
adjustments. Overall this suggests that for most
countries in the euro area, the NAWRU results are

not overly sensitive to the specification of the
Phillips curve (i.e. to assumptions regarding
expectations formation).
Graph 2 shows that the differences amongst the two
labour cost indicators are reflected in the NAWRU
estimates based on the two alternative
specifications. For Spain, the NAWRU based on
the NKP posts a more moderate recent increase,
reaching 22% by 2015, compared to the 26.4%
estimate obtained using the TKP model. On the
other hand, for the euro area as a whole, the results
are more similar across the two models, with the
two NAWRUs posting similar developments,
reflecting the similar evolution of the two
underlying labour cost indicators.

In practice, the change in the method entails a shift
to the NKP model for most countries. However, for
seven countries (i.e. AT, BE, DE, IT, LU, MT and
NL), the TKP model continues to be used in an
effort to minimise unnecessary changes when
econometric performance and the similarity of the
results points to its validity. As the two models
differ solely in terms of expectations assumptions,
relying on a framework that features both the TKP
and the NKP specifications can be interpreted as
(Continued on the next page)

28

EA and EU outlook

Box (continued)

relying on a more encompassing implementation of
the Phillips curve approach which covers a wider
set of expectations assumptions.
Table 1 provides details regarding the impact of the
methodological change on the key affected
variables. (5) The table confirms that Spain is the
most significantly affected country, with a
downward revision in its NAWRU of 4.8 pps. in
2015. Downward revisions to the NAWRU are also
noticeable, albeit to a lesser extent, for Ireland,
Croatia, Cyprus and Portugal. (6) Two countries
also witness a notable upward revision, namely
Estonia and Poland. All these revisions reflect the
reduced pro-cyclicality of the NAWRU estimates
according to the NKP model compared to the
previous estimates based on the TKP model.
Furthermore, as the NAWRU is a component of the
production function approach which is used to
compute output gaps, revisions to the NAWRU
translate into revisions of the output gap estimates.
On average, a 1.0 pp. change in the NAWRU
translates into a 0.65 pp. change in the output gap.
Revisions for the output gap are also shown in
Table 1.
In turn, a revision to the output gap affects the
structural balance estimates, with a 1 pp. revision
leading, on average, to a -0.4 pp. revision to the
structural balance. Revisions for this variable are
also reported in the table.
(5)

(6)

For 7 countries (AT, BE, DE, IT, LU, MT and NL)
the NAWRU method remains unchanged (i.e. the
TKP specification continues to be used) and thus the
impact on the variables shown in Table 1 is zero for
all of these 7 countries.
Note: For Croatia, Cyprus and Bulgaria, the
comparison is between the NKP and HP filtered
NAWRUs.

Importantly, despite the fact that the structural
balance figures are revised for some countries, the
implications for the excessive deficit procedures
(EDPs) under the fiscal surveillance framework are
limited. In particular, for the purposes of assessing
delivery of the policy commitments under the EDP,
specifically the delivery of the recommended fiscal
effort, the change in the structural balance is
corrected in order to remove the impact of any
changes in the country's potential growth compared
to when the initial EDP recommendation was
made. Effectively, this correction offsets the impact
of any methodological change on the structural
balance. This is designed to allow governments to
make their medium-term fiscal plans with an
appropriate degree of certainty. The impact of the
methodological change on the adjusted structural
balance is less than 0.1 pp. in all cases.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2014

Box I.2: Financing conditions and credit growth
The current incipient economic recovery has so far
not been supported by rising bank lending to the
economy. Going forward, however, the capacity of
banks to provide credit will be pivotal to the
economic outlook.
This box, firstly, assesses to what extent the weak
bank lending documented in the main body of this
document is different than in past business cycles.
Secondly, it discusses some special factors at the
current juncture related to corporate indebtedness
and banks’ restructuring that could lead to
persistently weak lending growth.
The emerging funding gap via bank lending implies
that other forms of finance might play a larger role.
The box therefore discusses subsequently the
possible role of self-financing through retained
earnings and of market financing through bond
issuance as possible alternative sources of funding
of the corporate sector.
Credit and business cycles

Credit cycles are, though not perfectly, correlated
with economic cycles, as both supply and demand
for credit move together with economic activity.
Households and companies increase their demand
for credit as economic growth boosts consumer
confidence and investment opportunities. On the
supply side, banks' risk perception decreases when
the economy is picking up. Better income prospects
and the appreciation of the collateral offered by
borrowers improve their creditworthiness and
eventually the credit supply, in a process known as
the financial accelerator.
The credit cycle for non-financial corporations
(NFCs) tends to lag the economic cycle by several
quarters (see graph 1), notwithstanding some crosscountry differences. The graph also suggests that
credit growth to NFCs is currently weaker than
during the 2009 recession, despite the fact that the
recession in 2012-13 was significantly milder. This
warrants a closer look at current credit conditions
in this box.
The cycle of household loans differs from that for
corporate lending. Consistent with historical cycles,
it evolved parallel with GDP during the 2009
economic downturn and subsequent recovery. This
correlation has however recently broken, possibly
due to specific factors, such as ongoing house price
corrections in some countries, the increased use of
self-funding for house purchases and less credit for
the purchase of consumption goods.

A close correlation with GDP growth in the same
quarter emerges when the change in the flow of
credit to NFC (“credit impulse”) is used instead of
the growth rate of the stock of credit. (1) In the euro
area, during the cyclical upturns of early 2010 and
in late 2013, loan growth for NFCs changed
direction when GDP growth switched from
negative to positive territory (see graph 2). If the
past relationship between credit impulse and
economic activity continues to hold, GDP growth
accelerating this year and next means that credit to
NFCs will gradually improve and eventually turn
positive.
Creditless recoveries are not at all rare events,
particularly when preceded by a combination of
economic downturn, banking and financial stress
and high private sector indebtedness. (2) Historical
experiences with creditless recoveries may,
however, provide only few lessons for the euro area
as most of these took place in developing countries
with less developed financial markets, and in many
of them competitiveness gains via exchange rate

This follows Biggs, M., T. Mayer and A. Pick, 2009,
"Credit and economic recovery", DNB Working
Paper No 218. They argue that the change in credit
transactions (called the "credit impulse") has a closer
relationship with the economic cycle than a change in
the stock of outstanding credit. They point out that,
while the stock of credit is related to the economy's
capital stock, it is the change in credit flows that
drives the dynamics of the business cycle.

general an economic recovery tends to be stronger

growth.

Corporate indebtedness and banks' balance
sheet repair are special factors in the current
cycle

Two specific factors suggest that the current
economic rebound may rely less on bank lending
than in past cycles. They relate to the level of
indebtedness of the corporate sector and to the
ongoing balance sheet repair in the banking sector.
Outstanding corporate debt as percentage of GDP
is, however, not necessarily a good indicator of the
sustainability of corporate indebtedness, as it
conceals structural differences across countries and
heterogeneity across firms within a country. (4) The
non-performing loan rate (NPL) informs directly
about corporate debt distress. In addition to being
an indicator of unsustainable debt, it is also a
determinant for the supply of credit. Banks become
more reluctant to lend and charge higher interest
rates in an environment with increasing NPLs, as
losses on loans erode their capital. As NPL levels
display wide structural cross-country differences, (5)
it is more useful to look at their changes over time
(see graph 3).

Bruegel, February 2013 on the former and Takáts, E.
and C. Upper, Credit and growth after financial crisis,
BIS Working Papers No 416, July 2013 on the latter
point.
For instance, the corporate debt ratio is highest in
Luxembourg, Ireland and Belgium, because of the
presence of multinationals and high inter-corporate
lending, lower in Spain and Portugal and very low in
Italy.
This is due to differences in the definition of NPL.

Since the start of the crisis, NPLs have increased in
vulnerable Member States while remaining
constant or even declining in Germany and France.
This feature can partly explain the persistence of
relatively high differences in lending rates and
volumes across euro-area countries despite signs of
declining market fragmentation on other financial
markets (see graph 4). The recovery of the
economies of the euro area's vulnerable Member
States may lead to declining NPLs levels.

The current decline in loan volumes towards NFCs
comes amid a broader need for some banks to
deleverage. At the current juncture, deleveraging
pressure may be increased by the ECB's
comprehensive assessment of banks' balance sheets
which comprises Asset Quality Reviews (AQRs)
and stress tests. (6)
In the past, bank balance-sheet adjustments have
not necessarily led to a reduction in lending. This is
reflected in a weak cross-country correlation
(6)

The AQRs also bring to the fore the current
heterogeneity as regards the definition and treatment
of NPLs. Banks in some countries may be forced to
record more NPLs than before.

between bank deleveraging and changes to the
credit/GDP ratio. Most of the adjustments of bank
balance sheets in 2009-10 actually came from
depletions of non-core assets, and since 2010 the
loan-to-total-asset ratio fell only in some vulnerable
Member States (see graph 5). However, adjustment
through asset depletion now becomes more difficult
as there are fewer marketable non-core assets
available for sale. At the same time, low

Capital market funding is unevenly developed
across the euro area and does not suit all types of
companies, particularly not SMEs. (8) However,
market-based funding can have beneficial indirect
effects for the SME sector. For example, if larger
companies substitute bank lending by market
funding, banks can channel the freed lending
capacity to SMEs.

Shifts in corporate funding and savings

Empirical literature and evidence suggest that the
dominant source of funding for corporate
investment is usually internal funds, i.e. corporate
savings, and even more so in times of financial
distress and cyclical downturns. (7) Since the
financial crisis, NFCs have massively self-funded
their investments, while resorting less to external
funding (see graph 6). The economic crisis brought
both higher gross savings and a decline in
investments, particularly in some vulnerable
Member States. Companies have turned into
aggregate net creditors in the euro area as of 2010
and were only marginally net borrowers at the end
of 2013.
Since 2009, the euro-area economy at large has
become less reliant on bank loans, as evidenced by
a shift in the ratio of bank lending to GDP. This
reflects to a large extent the declining investment
share in 2012 and 2013. It is also due to the
increased role of other forms of external funding
since the start of the crisis. During both episodes of
bank lending contraction, market funding through
debt securities and shares cushioned the fall in

Beyond market financing, other forms of external
funding, such as trade credit, inter-company loans

play a role in buffering the decline in bank
lending. (9) Moreover, unquoted shares take a
central stage in the euro area and are very often
destined to SMEs funding.

EA and EU outlook

Box (continued)

In normal cycles bank lending takes a central role
to fill external funding gaps. However, some
specific features of the current credit cycle suggest
that the economic upturn this year and next is likely
to receive more limited support from bank lending
compared with previous cycles. Starting from the
current negative annual growth rate, bank lending
volumes may turn positive only later this year and
grow moderately next year.

The emerging funding gap will be mitigated by
self-funding ratios expected to decline to a much
lesser degree than during past cycles, especially in
countries where corporate indebtedness is high.
Furthermore, non-bank external funding is
expected to play a relatively larger role during the
current economic cycle. Corporate-bond issuance
has become a more important funding tool for large
firms, whereas the issuance of quoted shares
though still under-developed in the euro area, has
picked up somewhat over the last year.

Furthermore, the expected cyclical upturn and the
rise in the investment ratio are likely to push the
self-financing ratio lower and will thereby require
an increase in external funding over the next few
years. (10)

However, because access to market funding is more
limited for SMEs and is unevenly developed across
euro-area countries, this could imply lingering
funding constraints on parts of the corporate sector
over the entire forecast period.

Outlook

(10)

Assuming the self-funding ratio in the euro area were
to drop from 1.0 to 0.9 in 2015, the net external
funding flows required to fill the gap would amount
to around 1.1% of GDP.

Box I.3: Housing market adjustment in the European Union
Ongoing adjustment in housing markets

The house price upswing preceding the crisis in the
EU was particularly pronounced, with an average
cumulated inflation-adjusted growth of over 40%
since the last trough. Continued price increases
were accompanied by spiking private sector
indebtedness (4) and, in some cases, also led to an
unsustainable growth of the construction sector.
House prices peaked in most Member States in
2007-08 and entered into a phase of retrenchment,
with divergences between countries reflecting
heterogeneous
institutional
and
regulatory
frameworks in mortgage and housing markets and
dissimilar macroeconomic conditions. Table 1
presents inflation-adjusted (or relative) house price
developments using Eurostat's comparable house
price series.
Table 1:

Relative House Price Index (HPI) growth rate - EU countries
Relative HPI

Euro area

The magnitude and the pace of house price
movements are matters of great importance for the
overall business cycle. First, real-estate prices
affect household consumption through wealth
effects, owing to the considerable weight of realestate assets in household wealth. Moreover, this
direct impact could be enhanced by the possibility
of collateralising the housing asset. This would
suggest a higher impact of a fall in real-estate
prices when compared to an equivalent decline in
stock prices, (1) though this finding is not
unchallenged. (2) Second, falling real-estate prices
render housing investment less attractive and
reduce the expected profitability of the construction
sector. Although in some Member States the latter
development was a necessary feature of ongoing
rebalancing, subdued investment represents a drag
on economic activity. Finally, both channels are
reinforced via a financial accelerator effect. As
lenders’ willingness to supply credit increases in a
housing boom, expenditure in housing and other
durables increases, reinforcing the cycle through
further rises in house prices and stronger credit
growth. Conversely, in the bust period, the drop in
house prices reduces the value of households' and
firms' collateral, contributing to loan write-offs,
weakening banks' balance sheets, and leading to a
deceleration of credit flows. These effects can be
macroeconomically significant, in particular if the
adjustment follows a period of booming
construction activity and rising indebtedness. (3)

adjusted house prices in the course of 2012. In
contrast, house prices in 2013 clearly show signs of
stabilisation. Positive growth rates are not an
exception anymore (e.g., Estonia, Ireland, Latvia or
Sweden), while a significant deceleration in the fall
in house prices is observed in countries like Spain,
Portugal, or the Netherlands. Nevertheless, Croatia,
Slovenia, Italy, Cyprus and Greece still registered
in 2013 significant house price corrections.
Have we bottomed out?

House price pressures can be analysed along two
complementary dimensions: (i) the completeness of
the house price cycle based on a comparison of the
amplitude of the latest house price correction
against the preceding upswing; and (ii) house price
misalignment using several indicators of over- and
undervaluation.
The cycle completeness measure is calculated as
the distance of the current trough in the cyclical
component of house prices (i.e., the de-trended
house price series) from the previous trough. For
instance, if the amplitude of the previous cyclical
upturn was 100 while in the current correction
house prices had only an amplitude of 60, the
distance from previous trough is 40%. (5) The
misalignment indicator can be obtained as an
average of three valuation gaps: (1) affordability
gap (the distance to the long-term average of the
price-to-income ratio); (2) yield gap (idem to the
price-to-rental ratio); and (3) estimates of
deviations of house prices from equilibrium values
justified by housing demand and supply
fundamentals. (6)
These two dimensions are represented in graph 1.
First, house price misalignments are represented on
the x-axis, where positive values point to estimated
(5)

(6)

For more details on the methodology for extracting
the cyclical component of house prices, see Cuerpo,
C., M. Demertzis, L. Fernández and P.
Pontuch, (2012), "Assessing the dynamics of house
prices in the euro area", Quarterly Report of the Euro
Area, 11(4). See also Agnello, L., and L. Schuknecht
(2009), ‘Booms and busts in housing markets:
Determinants and implications’, ECB Working
Papers, 1071.
One possibility is estimating Vector Error Correction
Models. This can be estimated for a panel of 21 EU
countries, using a system of five fundamental
variables: the deflated house price, total population,
real housing investment, real disposable income per
capita and real long-term interest rate.

overvaluations. Second, the completeness of the
price correction with respect to the previous
cyclical trough is represented along the y-axis, with
positive values signalling an incomplete
correction. Member States are split into two sets:
those still witnessing a cyclical adjustment phase
are represented by the red squares, while those
where the cycle seems to have turned to positive
growth rates are represented by the green circles.
Moreover, clusters are defined taking into account
underlying similarities in the data and help
classifying the countries accordingly. (7)
The cluster of countries at the bottom of the graph
(Portugal, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Denmark)
appears to have over-corrected (i.e., a downward
overshooting in the latest adjustment phase) and
shows at end-2013 negative or mild positive
valuation misalignments. Upward medium-term
forces can be expected to gradually take over, as is
already the case in Denmark whose adjustment was
swifter. Still, the fragility of private balance sheets,
notably in Portugal, may extend the negative
momentum for some time.
Countries in the top-left cluster (Estonia, Germany,
Hungary, Ireland, and Croatia) present a potential
for house price increases, owing to either a large
undervaluation, or a significant cyclical correction,
or both. Again, the materialisation of this upward
potential hinges upon the state of the countries'
credit markets and household balance sheets, likely
putting Croatia among countries with a more
subdued outlook.
In contrast, countries clustered on the top right end
of the graph have in principle limited upside
potential, due to the estimated persistent
overvaluation and a milder cyclical correction
achieved in the latest cycle. Downward mediumterm forces related to the high valuation levels, in
some cases coupled with elevated household
indebtedness, might counteract the current upswing
(as in Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom), or
may prolong the current mild downward
momentum (as in France and Belgium). A
significant outright correction of house prices
seems, however, less likely in either case due to
gradually improving credit supply and demand
conditions.

the cycle seems to have turned to positive growth rates are represented by the square green markers.
Note: The short time availability of the data series for Austria, Greece and Poland did not allow for a sound cyclical analysis.

Finally, medium-term forces appear rather neutral
in the top-middle cluster (including the Czech
Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Italy and Spain), with
no apparent price misalignment and sufficient
cyclical correction. Developments in the next
quarters and years in these countries will likely be
strongly driven by macroeconomic fundamentals
and credit. The prospects for Latvia and Lithuania
could be somewhat more optimistic owing to the
estimated undervaluations.
Relevance for the macroeconomic outlook

The analysis of upward or downward house price
pressures, complemented with an appraisal of the
state of the households' balance sheets and the
credit market conditions, illustrates how the
interaction between cyclical, structural and

36

financial factors determines the short- to mediumterm housing-market outcomes. In particular, the
households' ability to finance transactions through
debt will continue to be a specifically relevant
factor that will play a role in the market's outlook
on top of valuation levels.
Given the feedback loops between house prices,
banks' balance sheets, credit supply and economic
activity, the housing market outlook also has a
bearing on macroeconomic conditions. Housing
markets in most Member States with pronounced
corrections have already bottomed out or are likely
to do so within the forecast horizon. This would
imply less drag from the necessary housing market
adjustment on private consumption and the
construction sector than in the past few years.

EA and EU outlook

Box I.4: Structural unemployment
The high and persistent unemployment rate in most
euro-area countries has prompted concerns that
structural unemployment has shifted upwards and
that the increase in unemployment could persist
even after the recovery is on a solid footing. The
assessment of the structural component of
unemployment is of key relevance. Indeed, whether
unemployment is mostly cyclical or structural has
important implications, and requires different
policy responses. There is no single definition of
structural unemployment. In principle, the concept
refers to the level of unemployment that depends
on institutional, structural, or behavioural elements,
with no role for the economic cycle. However, the
concepts that are most commonly used in practice
cannot be fully delinked from the cycle.
The empirical Beveridge curve, which shows the
relationship between the unemployment rate and
job vacancies, provides a useful tool to interpret the
changes of unemployment. Demand shocks appear
as movements along the downward sloping portion
of the curve. Changes in the efficiency of the
matching process, a typical sign
that
unemployment is becoming increasingly structural,
or the rate at which jobs are being destroyed, are
reflected as shifts of the curve.
The Beveridge curve for the euro area (see
graph 1a) shows that after the recession in the
second-half of 2008, unemployment rose and
vacancies fell, pointing to a negative demand
shock, characterised by a downward movement
along the curve. The incipient recovery at the end
of 2009, however, was accompanied by a rise in
vacancies without a concomitantly large drop in
unemployment, which may suggest that employers
are having difficulties in finding workers despite
the high number of job seekers.

responding more quickly to the cyclical
improvement than unemployment does. (1) To
better gauge persistent changes in structural
unemployment, Graph 1b shows a measure of
matching efficiency for the euro area, which is not
influenced by cyclical fluctuations of the separation
rate. It is computed from the Beveridge curve
equation on the basis of an estimated elasticity of
the matching function and keeping separation rates
at their pre-crisis level. (2) The graph shows that
while matching efficiency remained relatively
stable before the crisis, a major drop was recorded
in 2009, with evidence of stabilisation only after
2012.
Three factors have been identified in recent
analysis as the main drivers of falling matching
efficiency across the EU (European Commission,
2013): the rise in long-term unemployment, a
growing skills mismatch, and sectoral mismatches.
The role of long-term unemployment is confirmed
by the strong negative co-movement between the
matching efficiency indicator and the long-term
unemployment series for the euro area (see
graph 1b).
Regarding the role of skills mismatches, the
evidence highlights strong patterns across
countries. The growing mismatch between the
skills of jobseekers and the skills demanded by
employers has led to a worsening of the labour
market’s matching efficiency in Spain, Greece and
Portugal. In Germany, by contrast, a reduced skills
mismatch has helped to improve matching
efficiency.

(1)

A second major demand shock took place in mid2011, along a Beveridge curve that appears further
away from the origin than it was at the beginning of
the crisis. Starting from mid-2013, there are timid
signs of a recovery in vacancies but the decline in
unemployment is only limited.

Nevertheless, the outward shift of the Beveridge
curve depicted in graph 1a is not sufficient to
identify a permanent worsening of the efficiency of
labour market matching and conclude that
structural unemployment has increased. Indeed,
such an outward shift could alternatively be linked
to the relatively slow adjustment of unemployment
to labour demand shocks (i.e. with vacancies

For unemployment the 2014 figure refers to the average of first two months.

The growing sectoral mismatch was relatively
broad-based
across
euro-area
countries,
concentrated in the 2009-10 period, and mostly
linked to the sudden increase in layoffs from the
industry and construction sectors. Graph 1c
displays the evolution of the share of unemployed
originating from the main economic sectors for the
euro area. It shows that although the vast majority
of unemployment normally originates from
services, in the aftermath of the crisis, there was a
sudden increase in the share of unemployed coming
from industry and construction. By the end of 2010,
the distribution of unemployment across main
sectors is back to values in line with those recorded
before the crisis. To complement our analysis, it
would be useful to look at the measure of
unemployment that only depends on institutional,
structural, behavioural elements, with no role for
the economic cycle. To do this, we compare the
Non-Accelerating Wage Rate of Unemployment
(NAWRU) of the euro area with predictions for the
NAWRU based on policies and institutions alone.
The NAWRU, a common gauge of structural
unemployment, represents the unemployment level

consistent with stable inflation. As explained in the
Box "The revised methodology for calculating the
output gaps", the NAWRU incorporates cyclical
elements while structural unemployment should
evolve solely on the basis of structural factors such
as institutions, policies, technology, etc. The
cyclicality of the NAWRU is linked to fact that, in
the presence of real rigidities, real wages adjust
slowly to labour demand shocks, so that the
adjustment to labour demand fluctuations over the
business cycle takes place partly in terms of
unemployment. (3) Structural factors in the
NAWRU determinants can be obtained from the
predictions of the NAWRU based on a regression
of the NAWRU on the main policies and
institutions affecting unemployment (the tax
wedge, unemployment benefits, and active labour

market policies). Graph 1d compares the euro-area
NAWRU with the predicted NAWRU on the basis
of policies and institutions, following the
methodology agreed in the Economic Policy
Committee. (4) As expected, the predicted NAWRU
exhibits a much more stable path than the NAWRU
itself, and increased only moderately after the
crisis. While before the crisis the NAWRU was
slightly above the NAWRU predicted on the basis
of policies and institutions, after the crisis it was
more than one percentage point greater.

determinants in the EU countries”, European
Commission, European Economy, Economic Papers

Cyclical unemployment may be higher than the
comparison of actual unemployment with the
NAWRU suggests. The important share of cyclical
slack in the labour market suggests that
unemployment may respond well to the projected
acceleration in GDP growth. However, the
deterioration of labour market matching and the
corresponding lengthening of unemployment spells
may translate into higher structural unemployment,
with cyclical unemployment not reabsorbed by the
end of the forecast period. Efforts directed towards
improving
matching
efficiency
and
the
employability of workers of becoming long-term
unemployed could reduce this risk.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2014

Box I.5: Some technical elements behind the forecast
The cut-off date for taking new information into
account in this European Economic Forecast was
24 April. The forecast incorporates validated public
finance data as published in Eurostat's News
Release 64/2014 of 23 April 2014.
External assumptions

This forecast is based on a set of external
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions
from possible volatility during any given trading
day, averages from a 10-day reference period
(between 3 and 16 April) were used for exchange
and interest rates, and for oil prices.
Exchange and interest rates

The technical assumption as regards exchange rates
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption
leads to an implied average USD/EUR rate of 1.38
in 2014 and 2015. The average JPY/EUR rates are
141.22 in 2014 and 141.35 in 2015.
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based. Shortterm interest rates for the euro area are derived
from futures contracts. Long-term interest rates for
the euro area, as well as short- and long-term
interest rates for other Member States are
calculated using implicit forward swap rates,
corrected for the current spread between the
interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no
market instrument is available, the fixed spread
vis-à-vis the euro-area interest rate is taken for both
short- and long-term rates. As a result, short-term
interest rates are assumed to be 0.3% on average in
2014 and 0.4% in 2015 in the euro area. Long-term
euro-area interest rates are assumed to be 1.6% on
average in 2014 and 1.9% in 2015.
Commodity prices

Commodity price assumptions are also, as far as
possible, based on market conditions. According to
futures markets, prices for Brent oil are projected to
be on average 107.6 USD/bbl in 2014 and
102.9 USD/bbl in 2015. This would correspond to
an oil price of 78.0 EUR/bbl in 2014 and
74.4 EUR/bbl in 2015.
Budgetary data

Data up to 2013 are based on data notified by
Member States to the European Commission on
1 April and validated by Eurostat on 23 April 2014.

Eurostat has withdrawn its specific reservation on
the quality of the EDP data reported by Austria,
which had been expressed in Eurostat’s News
Release of 21 October 2013 due to uncertainties on
the statistical impact of the conclusions of the
Federal Audit Office's report on the Land Salzburg,
published on 9 October 2013. Following
investigations by the Austrian statistical authorities,
the necessary revisions have been introduced in the
reported deficit and debt data.
Eurostat has expressed its reservation on the quality
of the government deficit data reported by the
Netherlands, due to uncertainties on the statistical
impact of the government interventions relating to
the nationalisation and restructuring of SNS Reaal
in 2013. The size of the impact is being clarified
with the Dutch statistical authorities. Based on
currently available information, Eurostat expects
that the resulting increase in the government deficit
for 2013 would not exceed 0.3% of GDP.
For the forecast, measures in support of financial
stability have been recorded in line with the
Eurostat Decision of 15 July 2009. (1) Unless
reported otherwise by the Member State concerned,
capital injections known in sufficient detail have
been included in the forecast as financial
transactions, i.e. increasing the debt, but not the
deficit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and
deposits are not included as government
expenditure, unless there is evidence that they have
been called on at the time the forecast was
finalised. Note, however, that loans granted to
banks by the government, or by other entities
classified in the government sector, usually add to
government debt.
For 2014, the national budgets adopted by the
national parliaments, including revised Draft
Budgetary Plans submitted to the Commission by
Luxembourg and Germany, as well as all other
measures known in sufficient detail by the cut-off
date of the Forecast are taken into consideration.
For 2015, the 'no-policy-change' assumption used
in the forecasts implies the extrapolation of revenue
and expenditure trends and the inclusion of
measures that are known in sufficient detail.
The general government balances that are relevant
for the Excessive Deficit Procedure may be slightly

different from those published in the national
accounts. The difference concerns settlements
under swaps and forward rate agreements (FRA).

The current forecast is based on ESA95 system of
national accounts. ESA2010 system will be first
introduced as of the autumn 2014 forecast

According to ESA95 (amended by regulation No.
2558/2001), swap- and FRA-related flows are
financial transactions and therefore excluded from
the calculation of the government balance.
However, for the purposes of the excessive deficit
procedure, such flows are recorded as net interest
expenditure. European aggregates for general
government debt in the forecast years 2013-15 are
published on a non-consolidated basis (i.e. not
corrected for intergovernmental loans). To ensure
consistency in the time series, historical data are
also published on the same basis. For 2013, this
implies a debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro area which
is 2.4 pps. (1.8 pps. in the EU) higher than the
consolidated general government debt ratio
published by Eurostat in its news release 64/2014
of 23 April 2014. General government debt
projections for individual Member States in
2013-15 include the impact of guarantees to the
EFSF, (2) bilateral loans to other Member States,
and the participation in the capital of the ESM as
planned on the cut-off date of the forecast (subject
to approval).

Calendar effects on GDP growth and output
gaps

(2)

In line with the Eurostat decision of 27 January 2011
on the statistical recording of operations undertaken
by the European Financial Stability Facility, available
at:
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/
2-27012011-AP/EN/2-27012011-AP-EN.PDF.

The number of working days may differ from one
year to another. The Commission's annual GDP
forecasts are not adjusted for the number of
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.
However, the working-day effect in the EU and the
euro area is estimated to be limited over the
forecast horizon, implying that adjusted and
unadjusted growth rates differ only marginally (by
up to ±0.1 pp.). The calculation of potential growth
and the output gap does not adjust for working
days. Since the working-day effect is considered as
temporary, it should not affect the cyclicallyadjusted balances.
As of this spring 2014 forecast, a slightly revised
methodology for calculating output gaps is used.
Changes to the methodology, namely the method
for calculating the non-cyclical component of
unemployment, have been unanimously endorsed
by the Member States in the Economic Policy
Committee (EPC). For details see Box I.1 - The
revised methodology for calculating output gaps.

Prospects by individual economy

Member States

1. BELGIUM
Towards broad-based growth
A steady rebound in economic activity is projected to slowly speed up over the forecast horizon with
real GDP growth reaching 1.4% in 2014 and 1.6% in 2015. Consumer spending is projected to remain
the main driver of growth, supported by more vigorous investment growth towards 2015. A combination
of modest wage growth, lower energy prices and tax measures is set to keep inflationary pressures at
bay. No further improvement in public finances is expected.
The fourth quarter of 2013 upheld the pattern
displayed in preceding quarters of firming domestic demand reinforcing an export-driven recovery.
Quarterly growth reached 0.5%, the strongest in
almost three years, while annual growth reached a
modest 0.2%. The good performance towards the
end of the year provides the Belgian economy with
a robust starting position for 2014.

contained, considering the recent positive trend for
credit conditions. Prospects for construction
remain weak despite the first cautious signs of a
materialising recovery in the sector.
Convalescing business cycles in trading partner
economies are reflected in export projections. At
the same time, more robust domestic demand is
expected to push up import growth and make the
recovery less export-driven, with net trade
contributing negatively to overall growth in 2015.

Household spending and company investment
to become growth engines

Household consumption growth in the first half of
2014 is not expected to match the strong figures of
recent quarters with consumer spending held back
by lagging labour market dynamics and slow
disposable income growth. As these factors slowly
unwind in the slipstream of a mending economy,
consumption growth is forecast to bolster towards
the end of the year. In 2015 consumer spending is
projected to contribute 1pp. to GDP growth.
Equipment investment is forecast to spearhead
capital formation, which, after two years of
negative growth, is projected to expand by 1.6% in
2014 and 3.2% in 2015. Soft indicators point to a
continuation of the measured growth in industrial
production. The latter has pushed the industry's
capacity utilisation to the long-term average level,
heralding acceleration in corporate investment.
This would result in higher credit demand. Risks
of credit supply falling short of demand appear

46

The latest labour market parameters sketch a
roughly stable situation. On the one hand, a recent
string of company closures and restructurings is
expected to exert further upward pressure on the
unemployment rate. On the other hand, leading
indicators seem to bear positive news with data for
temporary unemployment and interim employment
pointing towards a slow turnaround. Still, job
creation in the private sector is projected to remain
modest in the short term, while the public sector is
forecast to feature continued job losses. All in all,
unemployment would rise slightly in 2014 and
average 8.5%, as compared to 8.4% in 2013. Faster
job creation in 2015 would reverse these dynamics,
though the unemployment rate is still expected to
average 8.2% next year.
Falling energy prices and low price pressures from
unprocessed food items largely account for
headline inflation of around 1% in recent quarters.
Core inflation, which makes abstraction of both
categories, has been stable at a higher level, given
steady price growth for other items, notably
services. The lowering of the VAT on electricity
consumption by households since April will exert
further downward pressure on inflation over the
coming quarters. Projections put inflation at 0.9%
in 2014 and 1.3% in 2015. This low inflation
environment confines overall wage growth, which
not only limits price pressures, but also results in
lower growth of unit labour costs.

Member States, Belgium

No further improvement in public finances
expected

The general government deficit reached 2.6% of
GDP in 2013. The revenue ratio increased from
51.0% of GDP in 2012 to 52.0% in 2013, partly
due to one-off revenue measures (0.6% of GDP)
such as temporary regimes for tax regulation and
taxes on dividends. Total government expenditure
rose from 54.3% of GDP (excluding a 0.8% of
GDP one-off impact of a capital transfer to Dexia)
to 54.7%. The biggest drivers for the increase were
the public wage bill and social benefits, which
were both impacted by strong past inflation
through the indexation mechanism. On the other
hand, two factors had a downward impact on
expenditure: interest expenditure which fell by
0.2% of GDP due to the decline in interest rates,
and the impact of the electoral cycle on public
investment of local government which dropped by
0.1% of GDP.
In 2014, the deficit is expected to stabilise.
Expenditure growth is forecast to be limited due to
the low inflation environment, expenditure
reducing measures taken at different levels of
government, and a further decline in investment by
local government. Also revenues are projected to

increase less than GDP, due to lower impact of
one-off measures compared to 2013, low wage
growth, and the decrease of the VAT rate on
electricity (-0.1% of GDP).
In 2015, the deficit is expected to deteriorate to
2.8% of GDP under the usual no-policy-change
assumption, despite the projected strengthening of
economic growth. This is due to the expiration of
one-off measures, the impact of expansionary
measures already decided upon (such as the VAT
reduction on electricity and the reduction in social
security contributions), and an autonomously
rising trends in social expenditure. After having
improved by ¾% of GDP in 2013, the structural
balance is not expected to show further
improvement in 2014. In 2015, it is expected to
deteriorate by about ¼% of GDP due to the abovementioned factors.
The general government debt has been
substantially revised upwards since the winter
2014 forecast due to the reclassification of a
number of corporations into the government
sector. The debt ratio came out at 101.4% of GDP
at the end of 2013 and is forecast to rise slightly
further in 2014, almost entirely due to stock-flow
adjustment, and to start declining in 2015.

2. BULGARIA
Economic growth accelerates, but downside risks remain
The economic recovery in Bulgaria is expected to firm in 2014 and 2015 as domestic demand gradually
strengthens. After a deflationary period in 2014, inflation is projected to gradually pick up in 2015.
Following a fiscal stimulus in 2013, the fiscal stance is forecast to remain expansionary in 2014 before
turning marginally contractionary in 2015.
Growth to pick up

Bulgaria’s economy expanded by 0.9% in 2013
while GDP growth for 2012 was revised
marginally down to 0.6%. Thus, the economy
continues to operate well below its potential.
Private consumption and investment contracted
last year, while exports and public expenditure
supported the modest economic growth. Growth is
projected to broaden and increase gradually to
1.7% in 2014 and 2.0% in 2015, as domestic
demand is forecast to recover and complement
exports, which have been the main driver of
growth thus far.
Investment to boost domestic demand

Rising consumer confidence has yet to translate
into higher household consumption. In fact, private
consumption contracted by around 2% in 2013,
despite the increased purchasing power of
households following an increase in pensions by
over 9% in April 2013 and the stable growth of
real wages amid low inflation. Recent monthly
retail data, however, suggest that private
consumption should stage a gradual recovery in
2014 and 2015. After contracting last year, overall
investment this year and next is set to resume
growth driven by both public and private
investment, thanks in part to accelerated
absorption of EU funds. Investment growth should
be accommodated by the relative strength of the
financial sector, which has been accumulating
liquidity on the back of increases in domestic
deposits over the last couple of years. Also,
interest rates on both new loans and deposits have
been declining, implying an improvement in
lending conditions and credit availability.
Export growth to be sustained

Exports are set to continue growing at a moderate
pace in 2014 and 2015, sustained by the recovery
of the EU as a whole. Modest gains in market
shares are also expected to continue. Nevertheless,
the contribution of net exports to overall economic
growth is projected to turn slightly negative in

48

2014, as the recovery in domestic demand causes
imports to rise. The current-account balance
reached a surplus of about 2% of GDP in 2013
and, while expected to remain positive, is set to
decline gradually towards balance by 2015.
Risks are tilted to the downside

Risks to this macroeconomic forecast seem tilted
to the downside. Most significantly, the country's
energy dependence on Russian gas imports could
become a burden to growth in case of supply
disruptions. Also, the expected recovery in private
consumption could prove weaker than expected,
given that the Bulgarian labour market is still
fragile.

Labour market to remain weak

After four years of adverse labour market trends,
unemployment appears to have peaked in 2013 at
about 13% of the working age population.
Employment still contracted in 2013, but this was
partly driven by strong decline in the working age
population, due to negative demographic trends.
While the manufacturing and construction sectors
continued to shed labour, overall labour market
outcomes in 2013 were supported by a good
harvest which boosted employment in the
agricultural sector. In 2014 and 2015, the labour
market is expected to stabilise further but remain

Member States, Bulgaria

weak overall. Unemployment is projected to
decline only marginally to 12.5% in 2015 since
many of the unemployed have difficulties reentering the labour market.

inflation is expected to average -0.8% in 2014 and
to rebound to 1.2% in 2015. A scheduled increase
in tobacco excise in 2015 is estimated to contribute
to inflation by about 0.2 pp.

Prices to decline in 2014 but to rise again 2015

A temporary fiscal weakening in 2013-14

The inflation rate turned negative since summer
2013, reflecting specific domestic and international
factors and cautious consumer behaviour in spite
of rising real purchasing power. Import prices have
fallen significantly over 2013, reflecting lower
global energy and food prices, as well as the
appreciation of Bulgaria's euro-fixed currency
against its main trading partners in the Balkans. An
exceptionally good harvest in 2013 also reduced
food prices. The government lowered some
administratively set prices (most notably electricity
charges), which lowered HICP in 2013 by about
0.3 pp. in total, but more strongly since second half
of the year. The latest cut to electricity price was
made in early 2014, with an estimated impact on
HICP of about 0.3 pp. Inflation is forecast to
gradually return to positive territory towards the
end of 2014, as the base effects from the
administrative prices and previous years'
exceptionally good harvest fade and in line with
the expected pick up in domestic demand. HICP

Following three years of consolidation, the general
government deficit is estimated to have increased
from 0.8% of GDP in 2012 to 1.5% in 2013 and is
projected to increase further to 1.9% in 2014. This
is driven by a soft patch in economic recovery in
2013 and additional discretionary spending over
2013 and 2014 for social expenditure (including
the increase in pensions), various current
expenditure items and public investment. The
general government deficit is set to improve
slightly to 1.8% of GDP in 2015, in line with the
pick-up in economic activity, assuming no change
in policy. In structural terms, the deficit is
estimated to have deteriorated by over ½ pp. of
GDP in 2013 and by a further ½ pp. in 2014, but to
improve by about ¼ pp. in 2015. The general
government gross debt is forecast to increase from
18.9% of GDP in 2013 to about 23% in 2015. The
debt ratio fluctuates slightly over the forecast
period, reflecting a planned refinancing operation
of one large bond maturing in early 2015.

3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC
Signs of a sustainable recovery
The latest data point to a solid and broad-based recovery that is set to strengthen over the forecast
horizon. In the first half of this year, net exports are expected to lead the way out of a prolonged
recession with domestic demand set to take over as the main growth driver thereafter. Labour market
prospects should improve while the general government deficit is projected to increase yet remain well
below 3% of GDP.
A broad-based recovery is under-way

Real GDP contracted by 0.9% last year due to
weak economic activity at the beginning of the
year. Growth improved gradually from the second
quarter of 2013 and strengthened markedly in the
fourth quarter, when real GDP increased by 1.8%.
This was partly driven by transitory factors such as
the pre-stocking of tobacco in anticipation of a
change in taxation and some advanced investment
purchases in reaction to the significant weakening
of the koruna by the Czech National Bank in
November 2013. Soft indicators and the latest
high-frequency data point to a solid and broadbased recovery, which should firm over the
forecast horizon. Exports are expected to lead the
way out of the prolonged recession in the first half
of 2014 while domestic demand will take over as
the main growth driver thereafter. Overall, real
GDP is projected to increase by 2% in 2014 and
2.4% in 2015.

consumer spending has finally reached a turning
point and is expected to start contributing
positively to growth going forward thanks to an
increase in real wages and improving labour
market prospects and helped by low inflation.
Promising signs of a rebound in investment

Both public and private investment represented a
significant drag on growth in the first three
quarters of 2013. Some correction of the
exceptional increase in investment in the fourth
quarter of 2013 is expected in the first half of
2014. Nevertheless, recent data on corporate credit
growth, business confidence, and industrial
production indicate a more sustainable subsequent
rebound in private investment. The upturn in
public investment is expected to be substantially
stronger on account of a surge in EU-funded
investment projects.

Household consumption set to rise

Household consumption stagnated in 2013 as real
disposable income fell by 2% because of a decline
in both nominal and real wages that resulted in a
sharp drop in the saving rate as consumers tapped
into their savings to sustain spending. After several
years of stagnation or even negative growth,

A strong upward trend in new orders from abroad,
a projected gradual recovery in the main trading
partners and the supportive monetary policy
underpin the contribution of trade to the recovery
of the Czech economy. Key export industries such
as automotive and machinery production are
expected to benefit most from rising external
demand. Initially, imports are expected to be
contained by the relatively weak household
consumption and the price effect of the weaker
koruna. However, once domestic demand starts to
rise again, pushing up imports, the contribution of
trade to growth will weaken in 2015.
Moderate inflation, improving labour market
prospects

At the beginning of 2014, inflation was strongly
influenced by a large cut in regulated energy
prices. Inflation is projected to pick up again in the
second half of 2014 on account of the significant
weakening of the koruna following the Czech
National Bank's foreign exchange market

Member States, The Czech Republic

intervention. Stronger domestic demand and higher
wages will push inflation up to just below 2% in
2015. The economic upturn is expected to lead
only to a delayed and modest improvement in the
labour market on the back of a rebound in
productivity. The unemployment rate is forecast to
decline slightly but to remain above 6% in 2015.
Significant fiscal contraction in 2013 followed
by fiscal loosening

The general government balance posted a
significantly better result than projected in the
winter forecast and improved from -4.2% of GDP
in 2012 to -1.5% of GDP in 2013. Several factors
account for this outcome, notably somewhat
stronger activity and associated higher tax
revenues as well as lower government expenditure,
particularly a significant drop in public investment
and other capital expenditure, lower social benefits
and lower interest payments.
The general government deficit is projected to
deteriorate over the forecast horizon but to remain
firmly below 3% of GDP. The deficit in 2014 is
expected to increase to 1.9% of GDP while the
structural deficit is projected to increase to -1.1%
of GDP. After four years of double-digit declines,

the forecast factors in a sharp increase in public
investment as a strong rebound is expected in EUfinanced investment projects. Deficit-reducing
measures include lower indexation of pensions, an
increase in excise duties and one-off revenue from
the sale of newly released telecom spectrum
ranges.
In 2015, the general government deficit is
projected to reach 2.4%. This takes into account
the effect of the already approved tax reform with
a deficit-increasing impact of 0.4% of GDP. The
government is currently preparing new measures
for 2015 which include a significant modification
of the tax reform. However, these were not
reflected in the forecast. The structural balance is
projected to deteriorate to -1.9% of GDP in 2015.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to stabilise at
around 46% by 2015.
The fiscal forecast is subject to some risks. Firstly,
the dynamics of public investment crucially
depends on the expected rebound in domestic as
well as EU-funded investment projects which may
not be realised within the requisite time frame.
Secondly, the forecast does not include a one-off
expenditure related to a possible renewal of a lease
contract for fighter jets in 2015 (0.5% of GDP).

4. DENMARK
First signs of recovery
Indicators are pointing to an improvement in the Danish economy. Confidence indicators have
improved across sectors and unemployment has edged downwards as employment started growing
again last year. The housing market has stabilised and since mid-2012 prices have been increasing in
some segments of the market. After three years of weakness, GDP is expected to grow 1.5% in 2014 and
1.9% in 2015. The general government balance is expected to remain below 3% of GDP over the
forecast horizon.
Pick-up in economic growth in 2014

Real GDP grew by 0.4% in 2013 with the growth
driven mainly by domestic demand, particularly
investments and public consumption. At the same
time, a stronger increase in imports than in exports
has led to a negative contribution from net exports.
Although the year ended on a weak note with a
0.6% fall in GDP in the fourth quarter, indicators
suggest that a pick-up in economic growth is to
come. GDP growth has been strongly influenced
by an ongoing decline in drilling activities in the
North Sea, as GVA excluding mining and
quarrying increased by 1.2% in 2013.
GDP is forecast to expand by 1.5% in 2014 and
1.9% in 2015, broadly in line with the winter
forecast. Domestic demand is expected to be the
main growth driver in the forecast period, but
small positive contributions are also expected from
net export.
Private consumption remained flat in 2013.
Consumption has been stifled by widespread
uncertainty, weak income growth and ongoing
financial consolidation among Danish households,
following asset losses during the economic crisis.
The drop in private consumption at the end of the
year was due to temporary technical reasons
coming from insurance reimbursements after two
storms in the fourth quarter. These conditions are
expected to have had the opposite effect in the
beginning of 2014, boosting private consumption.
Currently, a number of indicators are pointing to
renewed growth in private consumption.
Consumption is supported by continued low
interest rates, low inflation and an increase in real
disposable income and an improvement in the
housing market with prices increasing relatively
fast in some segments of the market. Consumer
confidence has increased over the last year and
stood in March 2014 at the second highest level in
the EU (see Graph II.4.1). Spending by debit cards
picked up significantly at the start of 2014. On the

52

other hand, households' deleveraging efforts are
expected to remain a drag on private consumption
over the forecast horizon.
Exports are set to improve in line with the
projected pick-up in external demand. On an
annual basis, exports are forecast to grow by 3.1%
in 2014 and 4.0% in 2015, implying continued
export market losses. Danish exports are less
sensitive towards the economic cycle compared to
those of many other countries and losses of export
market shares are, therefore, typically largest in
years with relatively high growth in external
demand.

Household confidence (rhs)

Gross fixed capital formation has stayed at a low
level in the last five years, primarily reflecting
weak business investments and high corporate
savings. This mirrors idle capacity in the economy
and expectations of only a gradual recovery in the
coming years. Growth in gross fixed capital
formation is expected to pick-up to 2.4% in 2014
and to 3.0% in 2015, in line with the economic
recovery and supported by the low interest rates.
The labour market has improved

Unemployment has been edging downwards since
spring 2012. This encouraging trend is expected to

Member States, Denmark

continue in 2014 and 2015 with unemployment
falling gradually from 7.0% in 2013 to 6.8% in
2014 and 6.6% in 2015. According to the
European Commission's consumer survey from
March 2014, Danish consumers are the most
optimistic in the EU regarding unemployment
developments over the next 12 months.
Employment is expected to grow by 0.5% annually
in 2014 and 2015, reflecting the pick-up in
economic activity.
HICP inflation has remained at a low level since
spring 2013, reflecting a fall in prices of
manufactured goods, energy and unprocessed
food. Inflation is expected to increase gradually to
1.0% in 2014 and 1.6% in 2015, as the economy
retains idle capacity.
The risks to the macroeconomic outlook remain
broadly balanced. Denmark is a small and open
economy and is, therefore, highly dependent on
developments abroad. There are positive risks
related to a possible release of pent-up demand in
private consumption and in business investments.

Fiscal outlook stable

The general government deficit reached 0.8% of
GDP in 2013, somewhat higher than expected in
the winter forecast, mainly due to a revenue
shortfall on the highly volatile pension yield tax
revenues. Denmark’s public finances have been
heavily influenced by the one-off revenues created
from a policy that gives the opportunity to pay off
tax liability of future capital pensions at favourable
conditions in 2013 and 2014. This measure
boosted the fiscal balance by 1.5% of GDP in 2013
and is expected to have a broadly similar effect in
2014. In 2015, when the capital pension measure
will have no impact, the fiscal deficit is expected
to increase to 2.7% of GDP.
Regarding the structural balance, Denmark is
expected to stay within its Medium Term
Objective (MTO) of -0.5% of GDP over the
forecast horizon. Denmark’s general government
gross debt level is forecast to remain broadly stable
over the forecast horizon and to remain below 45%
of GDP.

Dynamic domestic demand-driven expansion
Economic growth is expected to accelerate, powered by domestic demand. Favourable financing
conditions should support a continued gradual recovery in equipment investment after disappointing
outcomes in 2012 and early 2013, while low interest rates and a robust labour market should further
support private consumption and housing investment. The general government budget is forecast to
remain broadly balanced and the gross debt-to-GDP ratio to decrease.
Dynamic growth this year and next

Real GDP rose by 0.4% (q-o-q, seasonally and
working-day adjusted) in the fourth quarter of
2013, after 0.3% in the previous quarter. Unlike
the domestically-driven expansion in the previous
three quarters, growth in the last quarter of 2013
nearly exclusively reflected the strong positive
growth contribution from net external trade. In
2013 as a whole, real GDP rose by 0.4%, driven by
private and government consumption. Investment
acted as a drag on annual growth, while net trade
was neutral.

wage growth is set to be slightly stronger than
earlier envisaged.

Consumption and labour market remain robust

Private consumption is supported by low interest
rates and consumer price inflation that is likely to
be even less than previously forecast. Robust
labour market developments underpin households'
high propensity to buy. The unemployment rate is
set to drop slightly as demand for labour outpaces
the growth in the labour force, which is largely the
result of high net migration. The reacceleration of

For the first quarter of 2014 and beyond, indicators
point to some acceleration of growth followed by
stabilisation at quite robust rates. The acceleration
in the first quarter is likely to also have been
boosted by extraordinarily mild weather that
particularly benefitted the construction industry,
which in turn helped lead an expansion of
industrial production in the first two months of this
year. A countervailing effect is set to dampen
growth in the second quarter but regarding
underlying dynamics, business expectations still
reveal high optimism in the economy as a whole
with orders and production expectations pointing
upwards. The expansion is set to be essentially
domestically-driven, given the still-supportive
conditions for domestic demand. Overall, real
GDP is projected to expand by 1.8% in 2014 and
by 2.0% in 2015, where the acceleration of activity
is almost entirely attributable to more working
days.

Investment upswing continues

The investment outlook remains favourable. An
upward trend in domestic capital goods orders and
a continued rise in firms' investment plans amid
dissipating uncertainty and favourable financing
conditions suggest a further pick-up in equipment
investment. Corporate construction investment
should move in line with investment in equipment
in the medium term, while vibrant housing
investment is expected to decelerate somewhat.
Import growth fuelled by domestic demand

Export growth is set to remain dynamic, as
indicated by increasing foreign industrial orders
and optimistic export expectations. Along with
reaccelerating investment in equipment, imports
are set to rise more dynamically than exports,
thereby contributing to a limited narrowing of the
large current-account surplus, which has been
revised upwards in the latest statistical update.
Moderate inflation with strengthening core rate

Inflation continued to surprise on the downside in
the first quarter of 2014, when it decelerated to
1.0% y-o-y. This largely reflected a stronger-than-

expected drop in energy prices, also on the back of
the euro’s appreciation. Over the forecast horizon,
the dampening impact of easing commodity price
pressures on headline inflation is set to be largely
offset by core inflation, which is rising gradually
from a moderate level as labour costs increase and
the output gap narrows. Overall, HICP inflation of
1.1% in 2014 and 1.4% in 2015 is projected.

expenditure projections include pension reform
proposals of the new federal government that
foresee additional benefits for certain groups of
pensioners as well as planned additional spending
on transport infrastructure, urban development,
research, and development assistance.

The general government budget was balanced in
2013 after a small surplus of 0.1% in 2012. Given
the outlook for more dynamic economic activity
compared to recent years, revenue growth is
projected to accelerate somewhat over the forecast
horizon, despite the second step of the increase in
the minimum income tax allowance this year.
Contrary to the plans of last autumn, the pension
contribution rate has not been further lowered this
year, in order to finance pension reform plans.

Budget balance (lhs)

Overall, the general government budget is forecast
to remain broadly balanced over the forecast
horizon, resulting in a decreasing gross debt-toGDP ratio. The ongoing winding up of ‘bad banks’
could further reduce the debt stock. The structural
balance is projected to remain in surplus, but to
decrease moderately.

Expenditure growth is also projected to rise, in
particular due to higher pension increases, wage
rises in the public sector, the restructuring fund set
up in response to last year's flood disaster, and the
new childcare allowance for parents not making
use of childcare facilities. Moreover, the

Gradual recovery despite rising uncertainties
Real GDP growth slowed to 0.8% in 2013 but is expected to regain some momentum to reach 1.9% in
2014 and 3.0% in 2015, as external demand gradually recovers despite growing geopolitical
uncertainties. Unemployment continues contracting.
Economic growth slowed down in 2013

Real GDP growth dropped to 0.8% in 2013 from
3.9% in 2012. Domestic demand slowed but
remained the main growth driver, while net exports
contributed negatively to growth. Private
consumption was supported by strong real wage
growth, rising employment and higher pensions.
Despite uncertainties and the weak export
performance, private investment remained strong
due to large projects in the energy sector and
sizeable purchases of transport equipment.
Conversely, public investment dropped by more
than 20% after the end of a number of
environmental projects and the completion of most
EU co-funded programmes. Estonia's net exports,
especially of services, contributed negatively to
growth, reflecting relatively weak demand in
Estonia's main trading partners together with the
diversion of oil-related transit trade to new Russian
ports.
External factors dampen outlook for 2014 and
2015

Although geopolitical uncertainties are growing, a
gradual recovery in external demand is expected to
fuel GDP growth of 1.9% and 3.0% in this year
and next. Corporate investment is expected to
suffer from remaining excess capacity and
uncertainties related to the export outlook in 2014,
but this should decline in 2015. Public investment
is expected to fall further this year and pick up
only in 2015, after a new season of EU
development fund programmes begin.
Consumption growth is forecast to remain
vigorous, supported by strong real income growth,
helped by income tax cuts in 2015. Household
borrowing is projected to increase only moderately
despite very low interest rates, as banks will
remain cautious about the private sector’s
relatively high level of indebtedness. Finally, the
recovery in Estonia's exports to its main trading
partners is expected to maintain the trade balance
slightly positive, despite domestic demand
gathering pace.

56

Downside risks to the forecast could stem from a
further acceleration in wage growth affecting
competitiveness and corporate investment, while
the Ukrainian crisis could affect both trade flows
with neighbouring Russia and inflows of direct
investment.

Wages increasing as labour market tightens …

Despite slowing output growth, employment
expanded further in 2013, partly because of the
lagged effect of more vigorous growth in 2012. At
the same time, the unemployment rate fell to 8.6%,
down from 10.0% a year earlier, although this was
mainly due to a relatively large dip in population
due to ageing. Employment is expected to grow
further over the forecast horizon, but at a slower
pace, and unemployment to continue contracting,
as the labour market tightens. Labour force
participation is high at close to 70% and is set to
increase slightly over the forecast horizon, given
the changing structure of the working age
population. Nominal wage growth accelerated to
7.4% in 2013, with real wage growth reaching
4.2%. This strong increase is driven partly by
persistent skill mismatches and rising vacancies,
recent minimum wage increases, pay agreements
for health workers and teachers as well as fast
catching-up of wages in traded services. The
purchasing power of the average wage is now back
to levels from before the crisis, while vacancy
rates have reverted to levels prevailing at the start
of the past bubble (2006). In 2015, nominal wage

Member States, Estonia

growth is expected to stabilise at around 7% and
real wage growth at around 4%, reflecting solid
output growth, a further minimum wage increase
by 10% and unemployment hovering around its
natural rate.
… while inflation stabilises.

With the impact of earlier global commodity price
increases fading out, HICP inflation receded to
3.2% in 2013. The assumed decline in global
commodity prices is expected to ensure that
inflation will continue its slow decline, falling
below 2% in 2014. However, rising core inflation
reflecting strong wage growth and a further excise
tax increase on alcohol are set to push inflation
back to around 3% in 2015.
Small fiscal deficit to continue

The general government deficit is forecast to
widen to 0.5% of GDP in 2014 from 0.2% of GDP
in 2013. On the one hand, the public wage bill is
projected to increase by 5.1% and pensions by
5.8%, while the compensation mechanism for the
second pillar pension contributions will negatively
affect revenue. On the other hand, a sizeable

revenue-enhancing package is expected to
somewhat compensate for the expenditure
increase. This includes further excise tax increases
and a rescheduling of dividend distribution from
state-owned companies. However, as a risk,
implementation of VAT-enhancing measures that
initially were planned to take effect mid-2014
could be postponed to 2015 and lead to a higherthan-currently-projected deficit for 2014.
Under the no-policy-change assumption, a slightly
larger fiscal deficit of 0.6% of GDP is projected
for 2015. The announced cut in the income tax rate
by 1 pp. to 20%, scheduled for 1 January 2015,
contributes to the projected deterioration in the
government balance and to a decline in the tax
burden. Over the course of the year, public
investment is forecast to turn positive again as a
new package of EU development funding starts
being implemented.
In structural terms, the fiscal position is forecast to
deteriorate by 0.1 pp. of GDP in 2014 and, on a
no-policy-change basis, the structural deficit is
expected to widen further by 0.2 pp. of GDP in
2015. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain
below 10% in 2014-15.

7. IRELAND
Financial stabilisation and labour market improvement sustain the
recovery
The robust performance of the labour market remains the most visible sign of the Irish recovery, while
the ongoing deleveraging in the private and the public sector continue to weigh on the speed of the
recovery. Public finances benefit from the improved labour market outlook and a rigorous
implementation of the 2014 budget would yield a modest primary surplus in structural terms. Based on
current projections, Irish government debt peaked end 2013 at close to 124% of GDP.
Employment gains and confidence lead the
recovery

Headline growth of -0.3% in 2013 was below
expectations, in part due to a surge in imports and
lower-than-expected private consumption in the
final quarter of the year. The falling output of the
pharmaceutical sector had a continuing negative
effect on merchandise trade, while trade in services
grew robustly. However, steady improvements
across all key labour market indicators and a surge
in machinery and equipment investment provide a
better barometer of the domestic recovery than the
highly volatile quarterly national accounts data.
These indicators are also in line with survey data
showing a return to confidence for both Irish
businesses and consumers.

Unemployment was estimated at 11.8% in March
2014. This brings Irish unemployment on par with
the euro-area average for the first time since
October 2008. A particular feature of the
improvement is the continued reduction in the
number of long-term unemployed, which fell by
9.3% in the year to March 2014; and in the number
of youth unemployed, which fell by 8.8% over the
same period. This trend is forecast to continue with
unemployment seen averaging 11.4% in 2014, and
falling further to 10.2% in 2015.

58

Real GDP growth in 2014 is forecast at 1.7%,
driven by the economic recovery in the UK, and
the euro area. Further gains in employment, a
modest reduction in the saving rate and rising
output in the construction sector should support
domestic demand, which is expected to make a
positive contribution to growth for the first time
since 2007. A reduction in the pace of the
pharmaceutical sector's decline is also forecast for
2014, as the effects of key patent expiries begin to
fade and output growth in the sector stabilises by
2015. GDP growth is forecast to rise further in
2015 to 3.0%, thanks to stronger domestic demand
and better net trade as conditions improve in
export markets.
Inflation is expected to remain muted as Ireland
continues the process of internal devaluation.
External risks are rising, while credit supply and
legacy debts remain an issue

Although key trading partners are expected to
grow, an increasingly uncertain external
environment poses downside risks to net exports,
given Ireland's openness and dependence on
international trade. Any possible rise in energy
prices related to recent political tensions could also
have a particularly high impact on Ireland, which
covers around 85% of its energy needs with
imports.
Impaired access to finance and the effects of
legacy debts continue to pose risks for SMEs
seeking to replenish capital stocks and seize new
business opportunities. Impaired credit channels
are also a risk to the construction sector, which, if
not addressed, may lead to bottlenecks in the
supply of new residential and commercial
property. The successful resolution of nonperforming loans is a precondition for the
restoration of credit channels and for sustaining the
economic recovery beyond the short term.

Member States, Ireland

Public finances benefit from the economic
recovery

In 2013, the government deficit declined by 1 pp.
(from 8.2% of GDP in 2012) to 7.2% of GDP. The
improvement mostly stems from higher tax
revenues (in the order of 1.5 pps. of GDP) and a
reduction in primary expenditure (of around
0.4 pp. of GDP), more than offsetting an increase
in debt-servicing costs (of 0.9 pp. of GDP). In
structural terms, the 2013 general government
deficit is estimated to have improved by 1.6 pps. of
GDP. (14)
The headline deficit is estimated to decline to 4.8%
of GDP in 2014. The impact of a lower-thanexpected nominal GDP level is offset by the
positive effect of the improved labour market
situation through direct tax revenues and lower
unemployment benefits. As compared to 2013, the
expected deficit improvement mostly comes from
a lower public sector pay bill (0.8 pp. of GDP),

in line with the public sector wage agreements,
lower social spending due to declining expenditure
on unemployment benefits (0.6pp. of GDP), oneoff measures (0.5 pp. of GDP) (15) and other
expenditure reductions. Revenues are expected to
remain broadly unchanged as percent of GDP. In
structural terms, the 2014 deficit is estimated at
4.4% of GDP, 2.1 pps. better than in 2013.
Under the usual no-policy-change assumption, the
general government deficit is projected at 4.2% of
GDP in 2015.
General government debt peaked at 123.7% of
GDP at the end of 2013 and is projected to decline
to around 121% in 2014 on account of an expected
reduction in precautionary cash balances and
narrowing of primary deficit to almost balanced
position. An increase in primary surplus is the
main driver of the projected debt reduction to
120% of GDP in 2015.

In 2013, one-off guarantee payments related to the
liquidation of IBRC increased expenditure by 0.7% of
GDP, but one-off revenue from the sale of mobile
telephone licenses (classified as negative expenditure)
improved the fiscal deficit by 0.4% of GDP.

The 2014 fiscal deficit is improved by discontinuation of
negative one-off in 2013 (0.3% of GDP) and one-off
revenue from the national lottery licence sales (0.2% of
GDP). One-off financial sector measures for credit unions
in 2014 and 2015 amount to less than 0.1% of GDP in each
year.

8. GREECE
Recovery signs strengthening
Data so far this year continue to strongly support expectations that Greece’s economy will return to
growth in 2014. Recent confidence indicators continue to support expectations that Greece will return
to growth in 2014. Structural reforms undertaken in labour and product markets have underpinned an
improvement in competitiveness that should strengthen exports and investment. The improvement of
headline deficit is set to continue.
Improved confidence and recovery supported
by fiscal achievements and structural reforms

The recession weakened markedly in 2013,
decelerating from -6.0% y-o-y in the first quarter
to -2.3% in the last quarter. For the year as a
whole, GDP fell by 3.9%, compared to -7.0% in
2012 (revised March 2014 data).
Compared to the winter forecast, both confidence
indicators and hard data improved further. The
Economic Sentiment Indicator has continued to
improve, especially for consumers and for
construction, whilst the March Purchasing
Managers Index posted its best quarterly average
since the third quarter of 2008. Hard data for
January and February 2014, confirm increasing
industrial production and a stabilisation in retail
sales, travel receipts and construction permits.
Economic recovery in the euro area this year
should support a revival in goods exports, as well
as stronger shipping and tourism revenues, while
imports are expected to show a less pronounced
fall than in 2013. Overall, the positive contribution
of net exports would be similar to the one of 2013.
However, this would more than compensate a
much lower negative contribution of domestic
demand, owing to recovering investment and a
smaller contraction of consumption. As a result,
real GDP is expected to grow in 2014 by 0.6%.
Real GDP growth is projected to rebound to 2.9%.
in 2015, with a more balanced growth contribution
from exports and domestic demand. Both
investment and private consumption are expected
to contribute significantly to growth.
The unemployment rate peaked at 27.3% in 2013.
Wage setting reforms have already contributed to
sharp improvements in cost competitiveness
which, together with the announced employment
support programmes and the pick-up in investment
should lead to a relatively strong decrease in
unemployment to 26.0% in 2014 and 24.0% in
2015.

60

Consumer prices fell moderately by 0.9% in 2013
and are expected to fall by 0.8% in 2014, reflecting
improvements in price competitiveness that are the
result of falling unit labour costs and product
market reforms. As the economic recovery gains
pace, prices should rise by 0.3% in 2015.
Greece’s current-account deficit reached 2.4% of
GDP for 2013 and is expected to narrow to 2.3%
in 2014 and 2.2% in 2015. This is less strong than
previously expected, due to weaker prospects for
import substitution over the medium term. Nontourism export growth is forecast to strengthen in
2014 and 2015.

Forecast risks are balanced. Downside risks are
related to the potential impact of the geopolitical
developments in the neighbourhood. A faltering in
the pace of structural reforms could also affect
investor confidence. Nevertheless, exports could
perform better than expected, given the early
indications of a further good summer tourism
season. A stronger than expected impact of the
structural reforms undertaken is also an upside
risk.
Budgetary situation is improving

In 2013, the ESA headline balance deteriorated by
almost 4 pps. to 12.7% of GDP. This deterioration

Member States, Greece

was mainly driven by the one-off costs of bank
recapitalisation (10.8% of GDP). Under the
primary balance definition of the Economic
Adjustment Programme for Greece, which
excludes extraordinary items such as these costs of
banking recapitalisation and other items, Greece
achieved a primary surplus of 0.8% of GDP, well
ahead of the 2013 programme target of a balanced
primary budget. The structural balance has reached
2.0% of GDP in 2013, 3 pps. higher than in 2012.
In April, Greece returned to the international bond
market after four years with a EUR 3 billion issue

committed to extend expiring measures to reach
the 2015 programme target of a primary balance of
3.0% of GDP. This implies a headline deficit of
1.0%.

funds for social cohesion and eliminating various
fiscal charges. Reviews of the VAT, social security

The government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
peak in 2014 at 177.2%, as clearance of arrears is
completed while nominal GDP growth stabilises,
and is then expected to steadily decline in 2015
and beyond on the back of stronger fiscal balances
and the economic recovery.

9. SPAIN
Job creation returns as the recovery firms
The economic recovery is forecast to get firmer over 2014-15, backed by improved confidence and a
further easing of financing conditions. After having turned positive at the end of last year, employment
growth is expected to increase gradually, while unit labour costs continue to moderate. Unemployment
is set to decline but will remain high. The budget deficit is set to narrow in 2014 but government debt is
still expected to rise.
The mild economic recovery in Spain is expected
to gain momentum amidst improved confidence
and further relaxation of financial conditions, as
declining risk premia and better financing
conditions for the sovereign and for banks are
gradually passed on to final borrowers. Yet,
financing conditions remain onerous for smaller
borrowers, such as SMEs. The adjustment of
imbalances progresses, but high levels of debt are
expected to continue to weigh on growth.
Towards more balanced growth

GDP expanded by 0.2% q-o-q in the last quarter of
2013. The rate of activity is expected to accelerate
during 2014, leading to an average GDP growth
rate of 1.1% for the year as a whole. The positive
contribution to growth from the external sector is
expected to narrow progressively over the forecast
horizon, while domestic demand takes over as the
main growth driver. As a result, and under the
customary no-policy-change assumption, the
projected GDP growth for 2015 is 2.1%.
Private consumption is forecast to accelerate
progressively, backed by positive employment
growth and growing real gross disposable income,
also supported by very low inflation. The
household saving rate is projected to increase
marginally as household continue to deleverage.
The improved economic prospects and the rebound
in exports are expected to underpin investment in
equipment. By contrast, the adjustment in
construction is set to continue. In particular,
residential investment is expected to keep
contracting in 2014 as leading indicators remain
weak.
Despite a deceleration in the second half of 2013,
exports are set to remain robust, backed by
ongoing improvements in price and non-price
competitiveness and healthy growth of Spain's
main export markets. At the same time, imports are
forecast to accelerate in line with final demand and
the high import content of equipment investment

62

and exports. The current-account surplus is
forecast to widen to 1.6% of GDP and net lending
to around 2.2% of GDP in 2015.
Inflation is projected to remain very low at 0.1%
and 0.8% on average for 2014 and 2015,
respectively, due to sluggish demand and the fall
in energy prices.

Employment set to expand

Having peaked at 27.2% in the first quarter of
2013, the unemployment rate retreated to 26% at
the end of 2013, (16) mainly due to the decline in
the labour force, whereas employment kept falling
until the third quarter. However, the process of job
destruction bottomed out in the last quarter of 2013
and employment is expected to grow faster in
2014, prompting a moderate fall in unemployment.
Although productivity is expected to decelerate in
2014, wage moderation should allow for some
further decline in nominal unit labour costs and
competitiveness gains over the whole forecast
period.
(16)

This figure is obtained with the previous methodology.
According to the new methodology, the unemployment rate
was 25.7% in the same period.

Member States, Spain

Downside risks to the growth forecast are mainly
related to the external sector. Growth could be
negatively affected if emerging market economies,
particularly those in Latin America, were to slow
down more than expected. A positive surprise
could arise if financing conditions improved faster
than expected, as this would boost domestic
demand.

falling unemployment and the change in the
pension indexation formula. Two recent
developments are expected to have a deficitincreasing impact of about 0.1% of GDP in 2014.
First, the decision by the European Court of Justice
to consider illegal the special tax levied by the
regions during ten years known as the "céntimo
sanitario" could lead to successful legal claims for
reimbursement. Second, the low flat social security
payments on new permanent employment
contracts, which came into effect in February 2014
and companies can access until the end of the year.

Final data for 2013 showed that fiscal
consolidation continued last year, but at a more
moderate pace than in 2012. Net of bank
recapitalisation costs (about 0.5% of GDP), the
general government deficit reached 6.6% of GDP
for the full year.

Assuming no change in policy, the headline deficit
is expected to widen to 6.1% of GDP in 2015. This
projection assumes that some tax measures
announced by the authorities as temporary will
expire by the end of 2014.

The impact of the 2014 budget measures and an
improving macroeconomic outlook are expected to
reduce the deficit to 5.6% of GDP in 2014, mostly
thanks to lower expenditure. With the debt stock
increasing, interest payments are expected to rise
further, despite lower interest rates. Social
transfers should decelerate in 2014, thanks to

The structural deficit is estimated to be at 2.8%
and 2.4% of GDP in 2013 and 2014, respectively
before rising to 3.4% in 2015. Large public deficits
and low nominal GDP growth are projected to
push the general government gross debt above
100% of GDP in 2014 and close to 104% of GDP
in 2015.

10. FRANCE
Recovery slowly takes shape mainly driven by domestic demand
France's economic growth is expected to gain momentum over the course of 2014 and 2015, primarily
driven by domestic demand. The trade deficit is unlikely to improve despite rising external demand. The
government balance is forecast to improve only slowly while public debt will continue to rise.
Snapping out of stagnation

After nearly two years of economic standstill,
business and consumer surveys have started again
to suggest expansion. GDP growth is set to
gradually gain traction and reach 1.0% in 2014 and
1.5% in 2015. Domestic demand is expected to be
the only contributor to growth, while net trade is
likely to dampen it over the forecast horizon.

Growth driven by domestic demand

The gradual economic recovery is set to be mainly
driven by private consumption, the traditional
motor of the French economy. The turnaround in
employment, relatively dynamic wages, low
inflation and the cuts in taxes and social security
contributions for low-wage workers recently
decided as part of the Solidarity Pact are likely to
support consumer spending. In addition,
households are expected to dip somewhat into their
savings in order to sustain their spending habits.
In a context of favourable lending conditions and
low interest rates, improved entrepreneurs'
expectations are assumed to lead corporations to
resume significantly their equipment investment
plans, after two years of decline. The tax credit for
competiveness and employment (CICE) and the
additional cuts in employer social security
contributions planned under the Responsibility
Pact are set to improve firms' profit margins and
hence their investment capacity.
Net exports to remain a drag on growth

Exports are projected to accelerate from 2014, in
line with the rebound in world demand, although

64

firms are not set to fully benefit from these
external
opportunities.
Indeed,
recent
competitiveness-enhancing reforms, insufficiently
targeted towards the exporting sector, are assumed
to only reduce the pace of losses in export market
shares without reversing the trend. The
deterioration in
external deficits would
nevertheless be relatively contained over the
forecast horizon due to favourable terms of trade.
With imports picking up on the back of the
increase in domestic demand, net trade is forecast
to further weigh on GDP growth.

In a context of subdued growth, only subsidised
job schemes in the public sector are expected to
stimulate total employment in 2014, as employers
are likely to continue to give priority to increasing
productivity over job creation. Looking ahead, the
2013 labour market reform and the labour cost
reductions resulting from the CICE and the
Responsibility Pact, mostly targeted towards low
wages in 2015, are expected to have a stimulus
effect on employment, resulting in a slight
decrease in the unemployment rate.
In 2014, falling energy prices and still modest
activity growth are expected to offset both the
impact on prices of the VAT increases introduced
in January 2014 and the fading effect of the arrival
of a fourth mobile operator in 2012. In 2015,
inflation is set to rise marginally on the back of a
gradual closure of the output gap.
Balanced risks to the growth outlook

Labour cost reductions could lead to a job-richer
and hence a stronger-than-expected recovery. On
the other hand, they may benefit exporting firms
less than expected, implying a more negative
contribution from the external sector.
Government deficit to improve only slowly

The government deficit reached 4.3% of GDP last
year. The difference with the 2014 winter forecast,
which had projected a figure of 4.2% of GDP,
came from revisions to 2012 data.

Member States, France

In 2014, the deficit is set to improve further thanks
to the measures included in the budget but also the
additional savings announced recently by the
government. The latter consist of savings to offset
the loss of tax receipts due to the suspension of a
green tax on heavy goods vehicles, the cancellation
of appropriations to be adopted as part of a
supplementary budget, lower unemploymentrelated spending following a new agreement
between the social partners on the unemployment
benefit system, and the first effects of the EUR 50
billion savings plan announced by the government.
In addition, the 2010 pension reform, which will
gradually lead to an increase in the minimum
retirement age from 60 to 62, will bring additional
savings. Finally, with local elections held in March
and based on what has been seen in previous
election cycles, public investment is expected to
fall. Overall, the deficit is forecast to reach 3.9% of
GDP in 2014.
The government balance is expected to improve
further next year on the back of a sizeable amount
of savings, with the government planning to reduce
public spending by EUR 50 billion over 2015-17
compared to the trend increase. Based on the
information available at the cut-off date, this

forecast incorporates EUR 17.5 billion out of the
EUR 21 billion savings targeted for 2015. This
implies that central government and healthcare
expenditure norms will be strictly met, the savings
target on social benefits broadly achieved and that
the announced cut in grants to local governments
will effectively translate into lower local spending.
On the revenue side, the announced cuts in taxes
and social security contributions, along with
already legislated measures, are expected to reduce
the tax burden by 0.4% of GDP. Overall, based on
the information available, the deficit is projected to
reach 3.4% of GDP in 2015 and risks are tilted to
the downside, as illustrated by the fact that the
government after the cut-off date partly changed
the plans, for example to freeze pensions.
Attaining a decisive reduction in the deficit
depends on the government's ability to effectively
reduce public spending.
On this basis, the structural balance is estimated to
improve by 1¾% of GDP in 2013-15.
The ratio of government debt to GDP (93.5% in
2013) is expected to rise further on the back of still
high deficits relative to nominal GDP growth.

11. CROATIA
Downward drift continues with no firm growth model yet in place
The economic contraction is expected to continue in 2014 but to abate gradually before EU-financed
investments help spur modest growth in 2015. As private sector deleveraging continues and the recovery
in main trading partners remains modest risks to the growth forecast are tilted more to the downside.
Inflation is forecast to be subdued against the backdrop of the weak demand. Fiscal consolidation is
expected to shape up, despite economic headwinds.
2013 was the fifth year of recession

Real GDP fell by 1% in 2013, confirming the fifth
year of recession in Croatia. Declining private
consumption and gross fixed capital formation
drove the contraction, while the lift from net
exports came to an end in 2013 due to a
particularly steep drop in goods exports. The
continued recession was felt across the entire
economy. Employment fell by 1% and
unemployment rose from 15.9% to 17.2%. HICP
inflation fell sharply from 4.2% in the first quarter
to 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as a result of weak
demand, the fading impact of earlier VAT hikes,
stronger competition following Croatia’s entry into
the EU and lower imported inflation.

European tourism market, is expected to boost
services exports. Together with a mild recovery in
goods exports, these trends should yield a modest
external growth impulse in 2014. In 2015, net
exports are expected to be the only driver of GDP
growth, partly supported by the expected
relaxation of current trade restrictions with former
CEFTA partners.

Modest recovery as of 2015

In 2014, real GDP is forecast to decline by 0.6%,
taking into account current policies. This decline
results from the expectation that domestic demand
weakness will outweigh the positive growth
impetus from exports. The expectation of a muted
recovery in 2015 hinges on external demand.
Private consumption is forecast to decline by 1.3%
in real terms in 2014 due to labour market
conditions. In 2015, private consumption is
expected to remain constant, due to continuous
deleveraging pressures and the impact of fiscal
consolidation.
Despite the strong increase in public investment,
gross fixed capital formation is expected to remain
constant in real terms in 2014. Increase in public
investment reflects also the phasing in of EU
funds, which is expected to intensify in 2015. On
the other hand, private investment growth will
remain negative due to the weak demand, ongoing
restructuring related to pre-bankruptcy settlements
and a still high level of uncertainty among
economic agents.

environment, including in the all-important

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

HICP inflation is forecast to moderate further,
falling from 2.3% in 2013 to 0.8% in 2014, owing
to the similar factors as in 2013, including
depressed demand and the weak economic
outlook. Overall HICP inflation is expected to be
slightly above 1% in 2015.
Risks to the forecast for real GDP growth are tilted
to the downside, especially for 2015, as much of
the expected growth in investment hinges on
efficient absorption of EU funds, which may not
be accompanied by broad-based private sector
growth.
Fiscal consolidation to start in earnest in 2014

The general government deficit for 2013 reached
4.9% of GDP, after 5% of GDP in 2012. This
marginal improvement reflects a slightly higher
increase in revenue compared to expenditure.

Member States, Croatia

This forecast incorporates the amended 2014
budget and the additional measures presented in
April and incorporated in the Convergence
programme, amounting to an overall package in
the order of 2% of GDP in 2014 and 1% in 2015.
On the revenue side, the main measures in 2014
are the increase in health care contributions and
energy
excises,
the
introduction
of
telecommunication fees, a change in the lottery tax
and the shift of pension contributions from the
second to the first pillar. The ongoing efforts
against tax fraud, the so-called 'fiscalisation', will
continue to generate positive results. On the
expenditure side, the most important measures are
the reduction in subsidies, especially in the
agriculture and transport sector and lower
intermediate consumption. Government gross
fixed capital formation is also expected to be lower
than initially planned. These trends result in the
deficit improving to 4.6% of GDP in 2014 and
3.1% of GDP in 2015, due to additional measures.
As a result, the structural balance is expected to
improve by close to ½ pp. in 2014 and by ¾ pp. in
2015. However negative fiscal risks are still
present, among them possible slippages in the
health sector and those related to successful
implementation of the envisaged package.

Furthermore, the government has initiated a small
scale reorganisation of the pension system
resulting in a two-step transfer, in 2014 and 2015,
of the accumulated second pillar assets for a
limited number of beneficiaries and a shift of their
future pension contributions towards the first
pillar. While the shift of the pension contributions
between pillars has a structural impact of above
0.1 pp. of GDP, the transfer of assets is a one-off
measure, leading to an improvement of the
headline deficit of 0.8 and 0.6 pp. in 2014 and
2015. Under ESA2010 accounting rules that will
come into force this autumn, such transfers will no
longer count as revenue-improving.
General government debt increased by 10 pps. of
GDP in 2013, much higher than the deficit in the
same year would imply. This mostly reflects the
pre-financing operation, including large one at the
end of the year. By end-2014, the general
government debt ratio is expected to increase to
69% of GDP, reflecting the assumption of renewed
pre-financing operations. The general government
debt ratio is expected to be almost constant in
2015, as a result of better cyclical developments,
and the planned consolidation measures.

Exports and investment in equipment support a slow recovery
After a severe recession in 2012 and 2013, a slow recovery mainly driven by external demand is
projected in 2014. With credit conditions set to ease over the forecast horizon, growth is expected to
strengthen in 2015. Inflation is set to reach a historical low in 2014 amid weak labour cost pressures
and declining energy prices. The government balances adjusted for the business cycle and one-offs are
expected to broadly stabilise over 2013-15.
A slow recovery supported by exports

Real GDP contracted by 1.9% in 2013, albeit signs
of output stabilisation emerged from the second
half of the year. The uptick in the fourth quarter
stemmed from the positive performance of exports
and an increase in investment in equipment. This
pattern is set to strengthen over the course of 2014
as external demand increases. In particular, firms'
capacity utilisation is projected to increase as
exports rise, encouraging new investment in
equipment. At the same time, investment in
construction is expected to contract further as
protracted tight financing conditions delay
recovery. Confidence – both for consumers and
industry – has been improving since mid-2013.
Households are set to raise their consumption
while restoring savings, also thanks to the cut to
the labour tax wedge.
Following the ongoing bank balance-sheet
adjustments and the eventual pass-through of
lower sovereign interest rates to the private sector,
more favourable credit conditions are forecast to
support the recovery and strengthen investment
from the end of 2014. This is expected to pave the
way for a firmer economic recovery in 2015,
supported again by increasing exports but also
domestic demand, including investment in
construction. As the projected acceleration in
domestic demand entails an uptake in imports, the
resulting current-account surplus is projected to
stabilise at around 1.5% of GDP in 2015.

back of discouraged workers re-entering the labour
market as the recovery sets in. Accordingly, the
unemployment rate is projected to peak in 2014, at
12.8%, and then marginally decline in 2015. Over
2014-15, labour productivity growth is set to
recover somewhat, while remaining below the
euro-area average. This, combined with a projected
moderate wage growth, entails decelerating unit
labour costs over the forecast horizon, broadly in
line with the rest of the euro area.
Inflation is set to reach historical lows

HICP inflation, which has been slowing down
since the second half of 2012 owing to falling
domestic demand and decelerating energy prices,
is forecast to reach a historical low in 2014, at
0.7%, before resuming to 1.2% in 2015, on the
back of increasing import prices. Weak labour cost
pressures are expected to keep core HICP inflation
just above 1% in both 2014 and 2015.

Downside risks to Italy's economic outlook could
stem from a further appreciation of the euro and

Weak labour market conditions

continues to weigh on headcount employment,

The government structural balances stabilise

In 2013, the general government deficit remained
3% of GDP. Declining sovereign-bond yields led
to a decrease in interest expenditure, offsetting the
decline in the primary surplus. Primary
expenditure marginally increased by 0.3% y-o-y
driven by higher current expenditure, while capital
expenditure fell significantly despite the settlement

Member States, Italy

of overdue trade debt. The latter had an impact on
investment (and deficit) estimated at around 0.4%
of GDP. Revenues diminished in line with nominal
GDP, mainly due to a fall in VAT, personal
income and property taxes.
In 2014, the headline deficit is projected to decline
to 2.6% of GDP. Interest expenditure is expected
to decrease further as a share of GDP and the
primary surplus to increase to 2.6% of GDP. The
moderate year-on-year increase in primary
expenditure is mainly driven by social transfers,
while the recently adopted savings are set to curb
intermediate consumption. The tax burden is
forecast to decrease by 0.2 pp. of GDP mainly due
to the tax wedge cut adopted for 2014, which is
partly offset by new one-off taxes to finance it. In
2015, the deficit is forecast to narrow further to
2.2% of GDP as the primary surplus reaches 2.9%
of GDP, mainly owing to higher growth. In line
with the customary no-policy-change assumption,
the announced tax cut to low-income employees
and spending review measures are not incorporated
in the 2015 forecast as details have not been fully
specified yet.
The structural balance is set to improve only
marginally and, on a no-policy-change basis, to

remain negative in 2015 (-0.7% of GDP). Over
2013-15, the structural primary balance is
projected to stabilise at around 4.4% of GDP.

After incorporating additional 2.1% of GDP trade
debt arrear settlements (after 1.4% in 2013), the
general government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected
to peak at around 135% in 2014. It is then
projected to decline in 2015 mainly thanks to the
higher primary surplus and nominal GDP growth
as well as the use of the proceeds of privatisations
scheduled in the second half of 2014.

Recession bottoms out gradually as economy rebalances
The unwinding of macroeconomic imbalances continued in 2013. The sharp decline in 2013 is expected
to ease in 2014 supported by net exports and a weaker decline in domestic demand, on the back of
improving business sentiment and consumer confidence. Growth is forecast to resume gradually in
2015, as the contraction in domestic demand comes to a halt. Following a better-than-expected
performance last year, the fiscal adjustment progresses.
Note: This forecast was finalised in early
February, after the third quarterly review of
the economic adjustment programme, and will
be revisited during the fourth review. The text
reflects recent developments.
The recession was broad-based in 2013 …

The recession intensified in 2013, as real GDP
declined 5.4 %. The decline was broadly based,
with all domestic demand components contracting
more than in the previous year. Nevertheless, the
fall in private consumption proved milder than
anticipated, as households smoothed out
consumption by drawing on their savings to
mitigate the adverse impact of the recession. The
resilience of the tourism and professional business
services sectors helped to mitigate the fall in
economic activity and exports. Imports fell more
than exports, leading to a positive contribution of
net trade to growth. Unemployment further
increased, albeit at a lower rate at the end of 2013,
to 16.9 % in December 2013. Reflecting sizeable
spare capacity, HICP inflation turned negative
towards the end of 2013, bringing the yearly rate
down to 0.4 %.

VAT hikes should leave HICP inflation almost
unchanged from 2013.
Growth is set to resume in 2015 …

In 2015, growth is forecast to resume gradually as
private domestic demand strengthens. The
restoration of a sound and well-capitalised banking
sector and the gradual deleveraging of both
households and corporates should clear the way for
more balanced growth. Export of goods and
services are forecast to expand, supported by
structural reforms in the tourism sector and a
further acceleration in the growth of foreign
demand. Reflecting the pick-up in demand,
imports are set to increase and the labour market is
projected to improve slowly, with unemployment
starting to ease and employment picking up. As a
result, HICP inflation should start to accelerate
gradually.

forecast

While short term indicators such as business
sentiment and consumer confidence suggest that
the recession will continue in 2014, the decline in
activity is expected to ease. Tight credit conditions
and declining disposable income on the back of
further wage cuts will remain a drag on private
demand, while the necessary fiscal consolidation
measures will continue to weigh on public
consumption. Net trade should contribute
positively to growth, as imports shrink more than
exports. The contraction of the economy is
expected to push the unemployment rate up to
19 % in 2014. Data for the first months of the year
suggest a bottoming out of HICP inflation. A
combination of base effects from administrative
reductions in energy prices last year and further

… but downside risks remain.

Risks are tilted to the downside. On the domestic
front, a more protracted period of tight credit
supply conditions and/or a slower reduction of
household debt, which would draw out the
deleveraging process, could postpone the
economy’s recovery. On the external side,
Cyprus’s sizeable trade links with Russia mean

Member States, Cyprus

that its exports could suffer should negative
spillovers emerge from the tensions between
Russia and Ukraine. Risks to the HICP inflation
forecast are also on the downside, reflecting
possible larger pass-through to consumer prices
from
the
ongoing
price-competitiveness
adjustment.
Fiscal adjustment progresses

The 2013 general government budget deficit
reached 5.4 % of GDP, significantly better than
projected at the onset of the economic adjustment
programme. This largely reflects the tight budget
control and strict execution of the significant
consolidation efforts required under the
programme.
The budget deficit in 2014 is projected to widen
slightly, to 5.8 % of GDP, while the primary
deficit is expected to remain flat. Falling corporate
profits, combined with declining wages and
employment are set to lower revenues from direct
taxes, while the drop in private consumption
should translate into lower revenues from indirect

taxes, despite increases in the VAT rate and excise
duties. On the expenditure side, continued efforts
to reduce the public sector wage bill, intermediate
consumption and other current expenditure are
projected to outweigh the increase in social
transfers driven by the further worsening labour
market conditions.
In 2015, the improving macroeconomic situation
and better labour market conditions are expected to
support revenues from taxes and social
contributions. Total expenditure, meanwhile, is
projected to remain largely unchanged, as the
impact of ageing on pension payments will be
largely offset by a deceleration of the retirement
wave in the public sector. Nonetheless, the deficit
in 2015 is projected to increase to 6.1 % of GDP,
as the 2014 projection includes an exceptional
dividend from the Central Bank of Cyprus.
After a sharp increase in 2013, the debt-to-GDP
ratio is expected to continue rising in 2014 and
2015, broadly reflecting the macroeconomic
conditions.

14. LATVIA
Strong performance amid rising external uncertainty
Latvia's economy continues to perform strongly, but the most recent indicators show that challenges are
rising. Growth is expected to slow down further to 3.8% in 2014 before rebounding to 4.1% in 2015.
The country is still projected to remain the fastest growing in the EU but the outlook for 2014 is now
somewhat less optimistic than in the winter forecast. The nominal fiscal outlook is broadly stable as the
budget deficit is forecast at around 1% of GDP.
Growth faces some headwinds

The latest high-frequency indicators suggest that
real GDP growth is likely to slow somewhat in
2014. In particular, retail and industrial sales
performed below expectations at the beginning of
the year and business sentiment deteriorated in
March due mainly to weaker confidence in the
industrial sector. Growth is now projected to slow
down from 4.1% in 2013 to 3.8% in 2014 before
rebounding again to 4.1% in 2015. Risks, however,
are tilted to the downside mainly due to the
tensions between Russia and Ukraine, which could
have repercussions to regional trade flows and
investment sentiment.

Private consumption is forecast to be the main
driver of growth in 2014 and 2015 helped by
continuous wage and employment growth.
Investments and exports are expected to rise at
moderate rates in 2014 reflecting some setbacks in
demand from major trading partners, particularly
Russia. However, both investment and exports are
set to gain speed in 2015 in line with the forecast
increase in external demand.
Current-account deficit declines

The current-account deficit dropped to 0.8% of
GDP in 2013 from 2.5% in 2012, according to

72

preliminary data. Both exports and imports were
affected negatively by the contraction in the metal
industry but, on balance, net exports improved in
2013 indicating some shift in demand towards
domestically produced goods. As investment is set
to accelerate, imports are forecast to grow faster
than exports in 2014 and 2015. Nevertheless, the
current-account gap is likely to remain modest and
significantly below the value of non-debt inflows
in the capital and financial accounts.
Labour market tightens

Job creation is expected to slow down over the
forecast horizon as employers become more
cautious following the substantial increase in
wages over the last two years. Employment growth
is also restrained by the minimum wage hike at the
beginning of 2014 and the recent deterioration in
business sentiment. Nevertheless, unemployment
is projected to fall into the single-digit range by
2015, as overall economic growth remains
relatively strong and ongoing active labour market
policies should have positive effects as well. Wage
pressures are also starting to pose some risks to
competitiveness. Although unit labour costs are
moving broadly in line with the fluctuations in
major trading partners, the recent volatility of the
Russian rouble and consequently of the effective
exchange rate for Latvia may put more pressure on
exporters to contain labour costs through more
conservative employment plans.
Inflation set to rise

The government decision to delay the deregulation
of household electricity prices from April 2014 to
January 2015 brought substantial adjustments to
the inflation forecast. Consumer prices (HICP) are
set to rise by 1.2% in 2014 and to accelerate
substantially to 2.5% in 2015. Core inflation, in
particular services prices, is expected to rise at a
higher rate in 2014 due to the solid increase in
household incomes. In 2015, headline and core
inflation rates are set to converge, reflecting the
large impact of electricity prices, which is

Member States, Latvia

estimated at about 0.5 pp. Preliminary estimates of
the price effects of the euro changeover at the
beginning of 2014 suggest that the pass-through of
transition costs to inflation was within the
expected range of 0.2-0.3 pp., in line with the
experience in other countries.
Deficit to remain around 1% of GDP in 2014 and
2015

The general government deficit was 1.0% of GDP
in 2013, compared to 1.3% in 2012, with the
largest contribution to the deficit coming from
local governments. The tax-to-GDP ratio declined
somewhat compared to 2012, notably reflecting a
higher share of social contributions diverted to the
privately managed pension scheme. This was
offset by a good performance of non-tax revenue,
leaving the total revenue-to-GDP ratio unchanged.
Following several years of decline or very low
growth, government's consumption picked up in
2013, growing close to 4% in real terms. Overall
expenditure growth, however, remained contained,
so the ratio of government total expenditure to
GDP actually declined in 2013.

the corresponding structural balance is set to
deteriorate by about half a percentage point in both
years. This is a reflection of the impact of
measures to lower labour taxes and to continue
with the systemic pension reform, which are only
partly offset by an increase in indirect taxes. These
measures were partly implemented in 2014 and
further tax cuts for 2015 and 2016 are fixed in
legislation. Government expenditure is expected to
continue growing as well in nominal terms, due in
part to an increase in minimum wages and the
resumption of pension indexation; pensions will be
indexed to inflation and wage growth.
Nevertheless, growth in total government spending
is expected to remain below that of nominal GDP,
resulting in decline of the ratio of government
expenditure to GDP. The main risks to the deficit
forecast come from macroeconomic developments.
The government debt is expected to increase in
2014, as authorities intend to borrow to pre-finance
a large repayment to the EU due in 2015.
Government debt should decline by the end of
2015 after this repayment is made.

The general government deficit is expected to
hover around 1% of GDP in 2014 and 2015, while

strong domestic demand. Unemployment is forecast to decline, but remain high, while inflation is set to
slow down further this year before picking up moderately in 2015.
Domestic demand gradually replaced net
exports as the main growth engine in 2013

Robust GDP growth continued in 2013 and
reached 3.3%. While in the first quarter net exports
had been the main growth driver, domestic demand
took over in the second quarter. Substantial wage
increases, low inflation, falling unemployment and
strong confidence indicators boosted consumption.
Private investment soared on the back of high
capacity utilisation rates and positive sentiment,
although some of it was exceptional, connected to
regulatory changes in the transport sector. Strong
growth in public investment was supported by
Lithuania’s EU Presidency.

Robust growth in 2014-15, but downside risks
have increased

Looking ahead, real GDP is forecast to grow by
3.3% in 2014 and 3.7% in 2015. The ongoing
labour market recovery, accelerating wage growth
and low inflation are expected to further boost
household disposable income and private
consumption. At the same time, investment is set
to continue growing robustly as interest rates are
low and companies have significant financial
reserves. Moreover, EU co-financed projects will
continue to support public investment over the
forecast horizon.

74

Risks to the growth forecast are tilted to the
downside. Particularly, a further slowdown in
Russia and the wider CIS region might hamper
trade and could affect sentiment with possible
impacts on domestic demand. On the upside,
stronger-than-expected credit growth could boost
private consumption and investment.
Negative net exports seen dampening growth

Export growth is set to be subdued in 2014 before
picking up as the external environment improves.
Since the second half of 2013 exports have been
dragged down by the fertilizer and refined
petroleum product industries.
Import growth has been fairly stable and is
expected to pick up as private consumption and
investment
grow
robustly.
Overall,
the
contribution of net exports to growth is expected to
remain negative over the forecast horizon. After a
surplus in 2013, the current account is expected to
deteriorate moderately towards a small deficit in
2014 and 2015.
Inflation is set to remain low but pick up slightly
towards the end of the forecast horizon

HICP Inflation slowed to 1.2% in 2013, due to
exceptionally weak energy and food price
developments. This trend is forecast to continue in
early 2014, with a slight pick-up expected
thereafter. Inflation in the service sector is likely to
accelerate on the back of sustained wage growth,
while energy and food inflation are set to remain
below average levels. Overall, HICP is forecast to
grow by 1.0% in 2014 and 1.8% in 2015.
Credit growth to return in the financial sector

Private sector deposits grew robustly in 2013,
while credit remained flat despite a pick-up in
mortgage lending. However, households and
enterprises were able to finance a large amount of
investments from their own resources. Latest
surveys indicate that banks intend to ease lending
standards and that credit demand is increasing.

Member States, Lithuania

In its two judgements the constitutional court ruled
that some cuts in pensions and public wages
undertaken during the crisis were not in line with
the constitution and repayments would be required.
In 2014, the Lithuanian government intends to start
compensating for the cut pensions and has
prepared a draft law. If enacted, this would
increase the 2014 deficit by 0.4 pp. of GDP to
2.5% of GDP. No decision has been taken on when
and how to pay the remaining pension part as well
as the compensation for cuts in public wages, thus
risk remains for the 2015 deficit.

Fiscal consolidation is advancing

In 2013, the government reduced the general
deficit to 2.2% of GDP, below the initially planned
level of 2.9%. Overall, tax revenues met
expectations, as a strong collection of direct taxes
compensated for a shortfall in indirect taxes. The
central government spent less than budgeted, local
governments recorded a lower-than-planned deficit
and non-tax revenues turned out higher than
expected.
The deficit is forecast to decrease to 2.1% of GDP
in 2014. On the one hand, tax revenues are
expected to be supported by the cyclical
conditions, while expenditure growth is limited.
On the other hand, an increase in non-taxable
personal income threshold is set to be only
partially compensated by an increase in excise
taxes on alcohol and tobacco products in 2014. For
2015, under a no-policy-change assumption, the
general government deficit is set to decrease to
1.6% of GDP mainly on the back of limited
expenditure growth.

The structural deficit is estimated to have
decreased from 2.9% of GDP in 2012 to 2.1% in
2013. It is set to continue decreasing further to
1.9% in 2014 before falling to 1.3% in 2015.
General government debt has decreased from
40.5% of GDP in 2012 to 39.4% in 2013. It is
projected to increase to 41.8% in 2014 due to prefinancing of the 2015 bond redemption before
falling back to 41.4% in 2015.

16. LUXEMBOURG
Sustained growth and good employment prospects ahead
Economic output is expected to continue growing significantly faster than the euro-area average. The
financial sector will remain a positive contributor to growth. Job creation remains rather robust and
inflation is expected to increase strongly in 2015. Windfall revenues from e-commerce related activities
that compensated for expenditure slippages are set to gradually fade out from 2015 onwards, leading to
a sharp deterioration of the public deficit.
Growth is picking up

Luxembourg’s economy grew 2.1% in 2013,
significantly faster than the euro-area average. In
the last quarter of the year, output accelerated
again, suggesting that the economy may have
entered a period of relatively sustained expansion.

Private consumption is projected to accelerate
somewhat to respectively 2.4% and 2.5% in 2014
and 2015 respectively, broadly in line with good
employment prospects, which should increase
households' disposable income. Low interest rates
are supporting household investment, which is
expected to remain robust.

Economic activity is gradually recovering

Overall, output is expected to grow by respectively
2.6% and 2.7% in 2014 and 2015. The economic
recovery is projected to be spread almost evenly
across all sectors. Luxembourg’s financial sector,
appears to be adapting faster than initially
expected to the new regulatory environment,
although it is still unclear whether the sector’s
growth potential will remain as high as it has been
in the past. Output figures for the construction
sector and for the manufacturing sector are
pointing to a recovery too. Improved business
confidence provides further confirmation that
economic expansion is gaining ground.
Despite the incipient recovery, investment is
expected to still remain modest with firms prone to
postpone or freeze plans, as capacity utilisation
remains at historically low levels and demand from
Luxembourg’s main trading partners remains
weak. Investment is expected to be led by specific

76

sectors, in particular purchases from the aeronautic
and satellite industry, for which a slow-down in
their investment plans is embedded in the forecast.

Exports are set to improve, based on better
prospects for external demand. The contribution to
growth from external trade should remain positive
throughout the forecast horizon. However, this
contribution to growth is projected decline over the
forecast horizon, as imports rise on the back of
buoyant domestic demand.
The financial sector’s prospects are the main
risk factor for growth

Risks to the forecast, in both directions, mainly
stem from the capacity of the financial sector to
adapt to the changing business and regulatory
environment. It will determine, not only the
prospects for this industry, but, given the size of
the sector, also the outlook for the economy as a
whole.
Lower inflation and solid job creation

Headline inflation fell in 2013 to average 1.7%.
Increases in administered prices partially offset
less dynamic oil prices. Inflation is then expected
to further abate in 2014 to 1.4%, in line with
weakening oil prices. In 2015, headline inflation is
expected to jump to 2.4% owning to the
government’s decision to increase, from the
beginning of the year, by 2 pps. all VAT rates with
the exception of the super-reduced rate of 3%.
Job creation in 2013 weakened to 1.7%, due to job
losses in the construction and the industrial sectors.
Although the financial sector is expected to

Member States, Luxembourg

continue lay-offs in 2014, overall employment
creation should improve along with the general
economic outlook. Employment growth is
projected to increase this year to 2.0%, and to
accelerate slightly in 2015 to 2.1%, as the financial
sector recovers. The unemployment rate is
expected to have peaked at 5.8% in 2013 and is
projected to fall slightly in 2014 to 5.7% and a
further drop to 5.5% is forecast in 2015.
The government’s budget to deteriorate in
2015 as consequence of the drop in VAT
revenues

The general government recorded a small surplus
of 0.1% of GDP in 2013, mostly due to windfall
revenues from e-commerce VAT-related activities
and, to a lesser extent, from the implementation of
fiscal measures contained in the budget. In spite of
the consolidation measures adopted by the
government in the 2013 budget, public expenditure
continues to post a dynamic growth.

rise in public spending is expected to outweigh
planned consolidation measures worth 0.5% of
GDP, while no measures have been announced by
the government on the revenue side.
The deficit is projected to increase substantially in
2015 to 1.4% of GDP, as VAT revenues from ecommerce start to fade away, owning to the
change in the related legislation. The initial
budgetary impact of the drop in VAT revenues is
estimated at around 1½% of GDP. However, the
drop in VAT revenues should be partially
compensated by the above-mentioned increase of
2 pps. in VAT rates, worth 0.7% of GDP.
The structural fiscal balance, which in 2013
recorded a surplus of 1.4% of GDP, is expected to
decline by more than 0.75 pp. in 2014, before
eventually turning into a rather large deficit in
2015, following another drop of almost 2 pps.
The government debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 23.1%
in 2013 and is expected to reach 25.5% in 2015.

In 2014, the government balance is expected to
turn to a small deficit of 0.2% of GDP, given that a

17. HUNGARY
Ongoing recovery amid uncertainties
After increasing by 1.1% in 2013, Hungary’s economy is expected to grow by around 2¼% and 2% in
2014 and 2015, driven mainly by domestic demand. Unemployment is projected to decline slightly,
while inflation is expected to pick up gradually as the output gap closes. The government deficit
remained broadly stable at 2.2% of GDP in 2013, but is forecast to rebound to close to 3% this year and
next.
A more balanced recovery partially driven by
one-off stimulus measures

Over the course of 2013, the recovery became
more balanced as both domestic demand and net
exports contributed to economic growth. At the
same time, export performance also improved as
new foreign investment in the automobile industry
increased firms' operating capacity. Domestic
demand was primarily fuelled by public
investment which increased by 34% compared to
3.1% growth in the private sector, while private
consumption remained contained, growing by a
meagre 0.2%.
Looking ahead, GDP growth is projected to
increase to 2¼% in 2014, before slowing down
slightly to around 2% in 2015. In both years,
domestic demand is set to be the main driver of
growth. Overall, investment is forecast to pick up
strongly to 7% in 2014 but to decelerate to around
4¼% in 2015, as the effect of increased EU fund
absorption is expected to fade away by 2015 with
the end of the 2007-13 programming period. At the
same time, private consumption is forecast to grow
around 1½% in both years, reflecting increasing
real disposable income and improving employment
prospects. Exports are projected to keep up with
the increase in external demand. Credit growth is
forecast to remain slightly negative among
households and to turn somewhat positive in the
corporate sector on account of the central bank's
Funding for Growth Scheme.
Declining unemployment rate and a gradual
pick-up in inflation

Despite a continuing improvement in the
participation rate, unemployment dropped to 9.1%
in the fourth quarter of last year as the employment
rate kept on increasing. (17) The winter expansion
of the Public Work Scheme, the rising number of
frontier workers and the whitening of the economy
all resulted in employment gains. As the economy
(17)

78

Based on the Labour Force Statistics.

recovers, employment in the domestic private
sector (i.e. excluding frontier workers) is also
expected to pick up. Nevertheless the
unemployment rate is projected to decrease only
slightly throughout the forecast horizon due to a
steady increase in the participation rate.
Inflation reached a historically low rate of 0.4% in
the first quarter of 2014, reflecting three successive
waves of regulated cuts to energy and other utility
prices, declining inflation expectations and global
disinflationary factors. The influence of the abovementioned factors will gradually diminish, while a
weakened exchange rate will contribute to driving
up prices, with inflation projected to reach 1% in
2014 as a whole. With the latter factor still at play,
and as the output gap closes, inflation is forecast to
further increase to around 3% in 2015.
Risks to the forecast are both external and
domestic

The tightening in global monetary conditions may
contribute to further weakening of the exchange
rate and higher yields, which could weaken
households' and corporates' balance sheets and
imply lower domestic demand, but would
strengthen net exports. Hungary could be
particularly exposed to a potential deepening of the
Ukrainian crisis, through both the real economy
and financial channels. The main domestic risk is
related to the possible adoption of a non-targeted
new relief scheme for households with foreign
currency mortgages, which could negatively affect
the banking sector and investor sentiment.
Government deficit expected to rebound to
close to 3% of GDP

In 2013, the government deficit reached 2.2% of
GDP, i.e. a significant overachievement of the
2.7% of GDP deficit target. This came despite the
fact that revenues turned out to be lower than
planned even after the mid-year tax-increasing
measures and substantially higher non-tax receipts.

Member States, Hungary

Despite savings by local governments, expenditure
slippages occurred, inter alia, reflecting the launch
of a new compensation scheme for teachers and
other extra wage-related payments as well as
higher-than-budgeted outlays on goods and
services. However, these negative developments,
which together amounted to 0.9% of GDP, were
more than offset by the cancellation of the
extraordinary reserve of 1.4% of GDP.
The 2014 deficit is projected to increase to 2.9% of
GDP, in line with the official target. This reflects
the fact that primary expenditure is expected to
expand by around 1% of GDP. The spending
increases are partly compensated by additional
non-tax revenues and the reduction of the net
interest burden, while the tax-to-GDP ratio is
projected to decrease slightly. The forecast
assumes that the extraordinary reserve will not be
spent (0.3% of GDP).
Based on the no-policy-change assumption, the
2015 deficit is expected to improve somewhat to
2.8% of GDP. The positive effects of the closing
output gap, moderate wage growth and the
declining public investment following the election

year will be largely offset by deficit-increasing
measures and a fall in one-off receipts from the
sale of telecom frequency licenses.
Regarding risks, a possible change in the
calculation of national co-payments for EU funds
from public to total cost may result in significant
one-off revenues. On the other hand, the high
spending growth at line ministries observed in the
first quarter of 2014 signals the risk of potential
expenditure overruns. Further uncertainties stem
from the revenue effects of the protracted
introduction of online cash registers.
After a stabilisation of the structural deficit at ¾%
of GDP in 2013, the structural balance is forecast
to deteriorate considerably in 2014 to -2¼% of
GDP and to stabilise at this level in 2015. The
debt-to-GDP ratio decreased in 2013 by 0.6 pp. to
79.2%, largely on account of the end-year
reduction in the state cash deposits. Thereafter, it is
projected to increase again to 80.3% in 2014, due
mainly to the revaluation of the foreign exchange
component (ca. 40% of public debt), reflecting the
recent depreciation of the exchange rate, before it
decreases somewhat in 2015.

18. MALTA
Robust growth outlook
Malta's growth outlook is robust. Economic activity expansion is expected to be driven by domestic
demand, in particular strong household consumption and a number of large-scale investment projects.
Inflationary pressures are expected to gradually return, but overall HICP is forecast to be contained on
the back of the reduction of utility tariffs. Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue at a modest pace.
Growth in 2013 higher than anticipated

Economic activity in Malta surprised positively in
2013 with a real GDP growth of 2.4%. Growth
was reported to have been driven by significant
accumulation of inventories and a pick-up in
private consumption. These factors more than
offset a weak export performance, owing to a
sharp fall in exports of electronic goods. Overall,
net exports gave a negative contribution to
economic growth for the first time since 2006.

Risks to this macroeconomic scenario are mainly
related to the investment outlook. A number of
additional investment projects are under
discussion, whose realisation could provide a
further boost to economic activity. At the same
time, delays in the planned construction of the new
power plant pose a downside risk to these growth
projections.

Domestic demand to support growth in 201415

Real GDP growth is forecast to moderate slightly
but to remain robust over the forecast horizon,
reaching 2.3% in 2014 and 2015, mainly thanks to
domestic demand. In particular, large-scale
projects in the energy sector (most notably a new
power plant) are planned during the forecast
horizon. Due to the import-intensity of investment,
net exports are thus expected to have a further
negative contribution to GDP growth in 2014.
Household consumption is projected to contribute
significantly to economic growth in both 2014 and
2015 as positive labour market conditions and a
reduction in utility tariffs are expected to have a
beneficial impact on disposable income.

Inflation outlook affected by lower utility tariffs

After reaching a six-year trough in 2013, HICP
inflation is projected to gradually rebound over the
forecast horizon, driven by services inflation and
persistently strong dynamics in food prices. In
particular, annual inflation in services is expected
to recover from the deflation registered in 2013 to
its long-term average of around 2% by the second
half of 2014. Thereafter, it is projected to roughly
stabilise in 2015, supported by the positive
household consumption outlook. As a result, core
HICP inflation is forecast to accelerate to around
1.7% in 2014-15, in line with its long-term
average. Overall, inflationary pressures are,
however, projected to be somewhat dampened by
the reduction in utility tariffs for households as of
April 2014, containing energy inflation. This
outlook does not take into account the
government's commitment to extend the reduction
in utility tariffs to businesses in 2015, which could
lower overall HICP inflation for that year.

Member States, Malta

Fiscal consolidation continues

The general government deficit narrowed to 2.8%
of GDP in 2013 from 3.3% a year before, thanks to
strong economic growth, a robust labour market as
well as some discretionary measures. Substantial
increases in income and indirect tax receipts
boosted tax revenues growth above that of nominal
GDP. Expenditure continued to grow at a fast
pace, driven by the increase in public employment
and social spending, as well as an additional
capital transfer to Air Malta.
In 2014, the government deficit is expected to
improve further to 2.5% of GDP. The
implementation of the 2014 budget is expected to
boost revenues through increases in indirect
taxation (mainly excise duties), a new programme
to grant Maltese citizenship to foreign individuals
and families against the payment of a fee and
investments in the country and the introduction of
a new tax regime for rental income. On the
expenditure side, the 2014 budget envisages to
reintroduce restrictions on recruitment, while
benefits of the ongoing comprehensive spending
review are expected to materialise as of 2015. As a

result, current expenditure is forecast to be more
dynamic than current revenue whereas net capital
expenditure is expected to decline also thanks to a
lower capital transfer to Air Malta.
The structural deficit is projected to narrow only
marginally in 2014, after improving by 1 pp. of
GDP in 2013. In 2015, under the usual no-policychange assumption, the deficit is forecast to remain
unchanged and to increase marginally in structural
terms.
The government debt-to-GDP ratio increased to
73.0% in 2013, also on account of a debtincreasing stock-flow adjustment. The debt ratio is
projected to decrease by some 2 pps. over 2014-15,
following the repayment of a loan from Air Malta
and the partial clearance of some tax arrears from
Enemalta (the public energy utility corporation).
Higher than budgeted disbursements related to the
car VAT refund scheme could pose risks to public
finance developments while the settlement of all
the arrears by Enemalta would further decrease the
debt.

19. THE NETHERLANDS
Economy on the rise after prolonged recession
Economic growth turned positive in the second quarter of 2013 and is projected to gain momentum in
2014 and 2015. Driven mainly by investments in 2014, growth is expected become more broad-based in
2015 chiefly thanks to rising household consumption. The general government deficit is expected to fall
well below 3% of GDP in 2015, in view of further expenditure savings and higher tax revenues as the
economy rebounds.
2013: Contraction masks underlying economic
improvements

In 2013, real GDP contracted by 0.8%. This
outcome reflects weak economic activity at the
start of the year, while growth turned positive in
the second and third quarters and strengthened
significantly in fourth quarter of the year, helped
also by transitory factors. Whilst weak domestic
demand continued to be a drag, corporate
investment rebounded strongly towards year-end,
in line with the improved business outlook, partly
reflecting a hike in investment in vehicles
reflecting the expiry of a fiscal facility. Private
consumption also returned to positive territory. In
combination with the general improvement in soft
indicators since the second half of 2013, this points
to a more broad based recovery.
Improved domestic demand supports the
outlook

Building on the positive developments since the
second half of 2013, domestic demand is expected
to overtake the external contribution as the main
driver of growth in 2014, supported in particular
by equipment investment.
Private consumption is forecast to shrink modestly
in 2014, by 0.2% a much lower decline than in the
past three years. Private consumption is projected
to pick up over the course of the year, reflecting
the positive effects of a gradually recovering
housing market as well as the support for
household disposable income provided by lower
taxes on labour, and lower pension and health care
premia. Following several years of negative
developments, real disposable income is expected
to modestly increase.
Dutch exports are expected to grow by 3.3% in
2014 compared to 1.3% in 2013, broadly in line
with the recovery in trade partners. In 2015 net
exports are set to provide a higher contribution to
economic growth. Domestic demand is expected to

82

become more balanced as private consumption is
set to grow again.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Risks to the macroeconomic scenario stemming
from domestic developments appear balanced. On
the one hand, private consumption may be held
back more than expected if gains in disposable
income turn out lower, or would be used for
further deleveraging. On the other hand, a faster
stabilisation of the housing market could provide
an additional boost by reducing deleveraging
pressures.
Unemployment
muted

stabilises,

inflation

remains

Since mid-2013, the unemployment rate has been
relatively stable mainly because of supply effects,
with labour supply reacting to the rather gloomy
near-term economic prospects. The unemployment
rate averaged 6.7% in 2013 but rose further to
7.3% in February 2014. The employment outlook
remains weak in the short term, as labour markets
tend generally to respond slowly to changes in the
business
cycle.
Together
with
negative
employment developments in the public and health
care sectors, this explains the projected further rise
in the unemployment rate to 7.4% in 2014.
Employment should start increasing again in 2015
leading to a slight fall in unemployment to 7.3%.

Member States, The Netherlands

For most of 2013, HICP inflation stood close to
3%, notably due to higher energy prices and the
increased VAT rate. In line with trends in import
prices, moderate wage gains and the only gradual
pickup in domestic demand over the forecast
horizon, inflation is expected to ease to 0.7% in
2014 and to only modestly increase to 0.9% in
2015. In the short run, the rebound in domestic
demand is unlikely to raise inflationary pressures,
given sizeable slack.
Deficit to fall well below 3% of GDP

In 2013, the general government deficit reached
2.5% of GDP. The headline deficit was
significantly influenced by the sale of mobile
telephony licenses (around 0.6% of GDP). The
nationalisation of SNS Reaal is assumed to have
had no impact on the deficit outturn, yet a final
decision on the classification by Eurostat is still
pending. Based on currently available information,
the impact may be an increase in the deficit of no
more than 0.3% of GDP.
In 2014, the general government deficit is expected
to rise slightly to 2.8% of GDP. Due to the positive
one-off in 2013, this increase masks ongoing fiscal
tightening. Cuts in the production of natural gas

are to lead to some revenue losses. However, nongas government revenues are expected to increase
in line with the improving economy, and structural
savings of around 0.1% of GDP should be realised
in the health care domain. On the back of ongoing
consolidation
efforts
and
the
expected
improvement in economic activity, the headline
deficit is forecast to substantially decline further to
1.8% of GDP in 2015. As domestic demand
recovers, higher revenues from labour and indirect
taxes are projected to boost revenue. Furthermore,
significant
savings
from
the
planned
decentralisation of social security and long-term
care is expected to affect expenditure.
Following an improvement of 1.4% of GDP in
2013, the structural balance is expected to stabilise
in 2014 and to improve by 0.5% of GDP in 2015.
The gross government debt ratio is forecast to
increase slightly to 73.8% of GDP in 2014, before
declining again to 73.4% in 2015. Risks to the
fiscal forecast appear broadly balanced and largely
mirror macroeconomic uncertainties. Particular
risks stem from the expected revenue from some of
the fiscal measures in 2014 (notably the temporary
tax reduction on accrued severance payments) and
planned expenditure savings in 2015.

20. AUSTRIA
A gradual recovery under way, supported by domestic demand
Signals of a recovery in economic activity are becoming more tangible. Low interest rates and solid
corporate liquidity, improving external demand and a stable labour market are expected to support
investment and consumption growth over the course of 2014 and 2015. Financial sector repair will
cause significant deficit widening and an increase of government debt in 2014.
Clearer signs of recovery have emerged in
2014 …

The Austrian economy is in a recovery phase since
the second half of 2013. This has been largely
driven by exports, while consumption and
investment growth have remained subdued.
Overall business confidence has continued to
increase in 2014. Data for industrial output and
retail sales showed positive year-on-year growth in
January and February. Still, consumer confidence
remains subdued, while manufacturing order booklevels and capacity utilisation continue to indicate
some degree of slack.

return of consumer confidence. In 2014 and 2015,
growth is projected to regain momentum reaching
1.8% in 2015, driven by strengthening domestic
demand. Net exports are expected to contribute
positively to growth on the back of stronger
exports, but to a smaller extent than domestic
demand due to a rebound in imports.
Low interest rates and solid corporate liquidity are
expected to reassure companies planning needed
replacements and extensions of capacity, and

84

reverse the pattern of downward revisions of
corporations’ investment plans observed in 2012
and 2013, amid the uncertainty related to the
slowdown in foreign demand and the stagnant
domestic economy. Construction is expected to
start responding to rising housing prices and
demand. After a weak start in 2014, credit growth
is expected to remain subdued in the coming
quarters, both on account of weak loan demand
and banks' efforts to strengthen capital buffers.
Exports are forecast to benefit from progressively
improving external demand conditions over the
forecast horizon supported by still strong cost
competitiveness of manufacturing. All in all, the
external balance is projected to stay positive and to
contribute positively to growth.
Moderate wage increases and lower inflation

After slowing down in 2013, employment growth
is expected to strengthen in 2014 and 2015, as
employment expectations of businesses have
improved. An increase in the labour force due to
rising participation of older workers and
immigration means that no sizeable decline in the
unemployment rate can be expected in the coming
years, limiting upwards pressure on wages.
Nominal wage growth barely exceeded inflation in
the latest quarters. The wage settlements
applicable for the coming quarters are more
moderate than the year before. However, with
lower inflation expected over the forecast horizon
and employment strengthening, the resulting
increase in households' disposable income is
projected to support consumption growth.
Consumer price inflation decelerated to 1.4% in
March 2014 due to lower fuel prices and price
declines in clothing. Lower energy prices and
moderate wage growth are expected to help keep
inflation below 1.7% in 2014 and 2015. Price
increases in service sectors, particularly hotels and
restaurants, however, should keep inflation in
Austria above the average level of the euro area.

Financial sector repair is expected to cause
significant deficit widening in 2014

The general government deficit decreased to 1.5%
of GDP in 2013 from 2.6% of GDP in 2012. Total
revenue growth sustained its pace due in particular
to social contributions and income taxes. One-off
revenue from the tax agreement with Switzerland
also contributed to the reduction in the deficit. On
the expenditure side, lower support to the banking
sector compared to 2012 and one-off revenues
arising from the sale of mobile phone spectrum
and recorded as a negative capital expenditure
resulted in a lower expenditure ratio, contributing
to decreasing the headline deficit.
The establishment of a public resolution agency
for Hypo Alpe Adria, further capital injections
required by the bank in 2014 and the vanishing
effect of past one-offs will lead to a significant
upturn in the headline deficit, even though
additional discretionary tax revenue and further
expenditure savings are expected to somewhat
contain the increase. The headline deficit is
expected to rise to 2.8% of GDP in 2014. The 2014
deficit projection is however characterised by
downside risks related to the finalisation of the

transfer of the impaired assets of Hypo Alpe Adria.
In this respect, downward corrections to the value
of these assets would result in higher government
capital transfers to the bank, leading to an
additional deficit increase in 2014. Additional risks
relates to possible further support required by other
financial institutions in 2014.
The headline deficit is expected to decline to 1.5%
of GDP in 2015, reflecting the diminishing impact
of one-off support to Hypo. Expenditure savings
will also continue to contribute to fiscal
consolidation in 2015. After declining to 1.1% of
GDP in 2013, the structural deficit is projected to
increase by 0.1% pp. in 2014, while in 2015 it is
expected to decrease by 0.1% pp.
Financial sector repair will delay the reversal of
the upward trend in general government debt to
2015. After a minor increase in 2013, government
debt is expected to rise by roughly 6 pps. in 2014,
slightly exceeding 80% of GDP. This is due to the
inclusion in the public debt of the value of the
assets transferred to the public resolution agency.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decrease to
79% of GDP in 2015.

21. POLAND
Economic activity gradually gaining steam
The recovery that took hold in the second half of 2013 is expected to strengthen in 2014 as domestic
demand overtakes trade as the main growth driver. Poland’s labour market situation is expected to
improve. Public finances are set to recover gradually.
Growth gaining momentum

In 2013 real GDP grew by 1.6% – well below
current estimates of potential output growth of
around 3¼% – as sluggish domestic demand in the
first half of the year left its mark on economic
activity. Growth rebounded towards the end of the
year, led by robust export growth and signs of
recovering domestic demand. In particular, private
consumption picked up in the last quarter, on the
back of growing employment and consumer
confidence. Improving external demand also
fuelled corporate investment, which partially offset
a slowdown in investment spending by the
government.

The risks to the forecast are broadly balanced. On
the upside, a stronger depreciation of the złoty
would further boost exports and enhance import
substitution. On the downside, new tensions in
Ukraine could weigh on economic activity by
hurting exports and business confidence and by
increasing energy prices.

Despite the rise in recent geopolitical tensions,
Polish exports are set to increase this year
stimulating private investment and labour demand,
which in turn should support the recovery of
private consumption. The ongoing recovery of
credit supply provides additional support to private
investment activities. After two years of negative
contribution, public investment is set to
moderately add to growth in 2014, as new projects
financed by EU funds are being rolled out. Real
GDP growth is forecast to average 3.2% in 2014
and 3.4% in 2015.

-4

The labour market is expected to benefit from the
recovery. The unemployment rate is set to decline
over the forecast horizon, from 10.4% in 2013 to
9.5% in 2015. This improvement is likely to
support acceleration in nominal wage growth and,
given low inflation, sustain real disposable
incomes. However, higher wage growth is not
expected to fully translate into additional private
consumption, as consumers are likely to gradually
increase savings to pre-crisis levels.
The annual contribution of net exports to real GDP
growth is forecast to turn neutral this year and
negative next year as domestic demand
accelerates. Against this backdrop, the currentaccount deficit is forecast to increase to 2.3% of
GDP in 2015, up from 1.6% in 2013.

Supply side factors curb inflation

Falling energy prices, subdued food prices, and
weak domestic demand drove average HICP
inflation down to 0.8% in 2013. Inflation is set to
pick up only moderately, to 1.1%, in 2014, as
energy and import prices remain contained, while
improving domestic demand and increasing
employment are set to result in growing wage
pressures and higher prices for services. A further
pick up to 1.9% is forecast in 2015, fuelled by
higher commodity prices and the sustained
improvement in domestic demand.
Public finances set to improve gradually

In 2013, the budget deficit increased to 4.3% of
GDP, up from 3.9% in 2012, largely due to lowerthan-expected government revenues.
Over the forecast horizon, the profile of the
general government budget balance will be
affected by the December 2013 reversal of the
systemic pension reform, in particular by the
transfers of assets from the second pension pillar: a

Member States, Poland

one-off transfer of assets worth around 9% of GDP
in 2014 as well as annual transfers of assets of
people retiring within 10 years, starting in 2014.
Under the current accounting rules (ESA95), such
asset transfers are treated as general government
revenue. Under the new rules (ESA2010), which
will come into force this autumn, such transfers
will not count as revenue anymore.

Due to the one-off nature of the large improvement
in 2014 and assuming no additional measures are
taken, Poland’s general government budget
balance in 2015 is expected to show a 2.9% deficit
under the ESA95 rules. Excluding the annual asset
transfers linked to the reversal of the pension
reform, however, the 2015 deficit will appear
larger, at 3.1% of GDP.

While the government budget balance would likely
post a surplus of 5.7% of GDP this year under the
ESA95 rules, the corresponding balance excluding
the asset transfers from the second pension pillar
would amount to a deficit of 3.6% of GDP. Apart
from the reversal of the pension reform, the main
measures with a positive and permanent effect on
the general government balance in 2014 include
changes in VAT and excise duties, a partial public
wage freeze and a gradual increase in the
retirement age. Expenditure savings will be
partially offset by the costs of a legislated
extension of maternity leave and other increases in
social spending.

The structural deficit is expected to gradually
improve over the forecast horizon, from 3.8% of
GDP in 2013 to 2.4% in 2015.
The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is
forecast to fall from 57% in 2013 to 49.2% in
2014, mainly thanks to the big, one-off transfer of
pension fund assets, before increasing again to
50% in 2015, due to the negative general
government balance. The projected debt figures
are, however, subject to considerable uncertainty
because of the potential impact of exchange rate
fluctuations on the value of Poland’s sovereign
debt.

22. PORTUGAL
Higher growth ahead after deep structural adjustment
Portugal’s economic recovery seems to be becoming progressively more balanced and domestic
demand-driven. Further improvements in competitiveness through the implementation of structural
reforms could help export growth and sustain the correction of external imbalances. However, the main
downside risks remain linked to the ongoing deleveraging and fiscal consolidation processes.
Note: The fiscal projections included in this
forecast reflect the commonly agreed scenario
of the eleventh programme review updated for
the official 2013 outturn. The projections are
being revisited during the twelfth review.
Economy gaining further traction

Portugal's real GDP declined by 1.4% in 2013, 0.2
pp. less than the decline expected in the previous
forecast. This resulted from a more dynamic final
quarter as well as some minor upward revisions to
GDP growth in previous quarters. The acceleration
of economic activity in the last quarter of 2013 is
expected to continue this year. In particular, fixed
investment (+3.3%) and exports (+5.7%) are now
forecast to expand more quickly than previously
foreseen. The recent strength in consumer
confidence and retail trade corroborate the
recovery underway in consumption. As a result,
real GDP is projected to grow by 1.2% in 2014 and
further accelerate to 1.5% in 2015. Domestic
demand and net exports are expected to make a
broadly equal contribution to GDP growth.
Labour market keeps improving

The labour market showed more signs of
stabilisation in 2013, in line with the economy’s
better performance that year. Total employment
declined by 2.8% in 2013, but this was due to huge
drops at the beginning of the year. More recently,
employment, particularly employment with
permanent job contracts, has actually been
increasing. This is set to continue, with total
employment forecast to expand by 0.9% in 2014
and 0.8% in 2015. Assuming the size of the labour
force remains broadly stable, this implies that the
unemployment rate should decline to 15.4% in
2014 and to 14.8% in 2015.
Still weak inflationary pressures

At the beginning of 2014, HICP inflation
continued to fall, reaching -0.4% in March. This
decline was mostly due to falling prices for
clothing and energy. In general, the ongoing

88

competitive adjustment of prices and the
persistence of slack in the economy are expected to
weigh on prices throughout the forecast period.
Notwithstanding the recent deceleration in prices,
inflation expectations seem to be firmly anchored
in positive territory, suggesting some acceleration
in price rises towards the end of 2014. HICP
inflation is projected at 0.4% this year and 1.1% in
2015, in line with a slight acceleration in wages.

Sustainable current account

Portugal’s 0.4% of GDP current-account surplus in
2013 was the country’s first in twenty years.
Exports should continue to recover strongly as
external demand rises and Portuguese exporters
continue to make market share gains. This should
ensure positive net exports and a current-account
surplus over the forecast period.
Downside
remain

risks

to

the

economic

outlook

Risks to the macroeconomic outlook are tilted to
the downside. The recovery of the credit market,
high private sector indebtedness and ongoing fiscal
consolidation could prove a bigger-than-expected
drag on domestic demand. Financing conditions
for sovereign debt are relatively favourable at the
moment, but investor sentiment has in the past
been volatile. In addition, Portugal's export

Member States, Portugal

performance is still heavily dependent on the
economic environment in Europe.

2.5% of GDP is set to be achieved by replacing
various transitory measures in the 2014 budget by
durable measures in the area of public wages and
pensions as well as further provisions amounting
to about 1% of GDP. These projections are
consistent with a cumulated improvement in the
structural balance of 2.4% of GDP over 2013-15.

Fiscal risks becoming more balanced

The general government deficit turned out at 4.9%
of GDP in 2013 (including bank recapitalisation
costs amounting to 0.4% of GDP). Budget
execution was supported by robust tax-revenue
collection and expenditure control, whereas nonfiscal revenue was weaker than expected.

The debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 129.0% at the end
of 2013 and is projected to start declining in the
second half of this year on the back of the
economic recovery as well as the use of
accumulated cash reserves and other debt-reducing
operations.

The 2014 deficit target of 4% of GDP is within
reach. The carry-over from the better-thanexpected execution of the 2013 budget and the
brighter macro-economic outlook for 2014 should
improve the 2014 fiscal accounts by around 0.7%
of GDP compared with earlier projections. Beyond
this, the 2014 budget and other supporting
legislation include discretionary measures worth
2.3% of GDP, mostly permanent and expenditure
reducing, aimed mainly at the reduction of the
public sector wage bill, reforms of the public
pension systems and expenditure cuts across line
ministries. The fiscal deficit target for 2015 of

While risks to the achievement of the 2014 deficit
target have become more balanced, negative risks
are still important. Downside risks to the fiscal
projection are mostly of legal nature as key
elements of the 2014 Budget and Supplementary
Budget have been submitted to the Constitutional
Court for review. In addition, implementation risks
remain elevated in light of the ambitious reform
package. On the other hand, stronger growth could
boost revenues more than expected.

23. ROMANIA
Strengthening domestic demand contributes to robust growth
Growth is expected to gradually rebalance towards domestic demand over the forecast period, after
very strong export growth in 2013. Real GDP growth is set to remain robust in 2014 and 2015. Annual
average inflation is projected to moderate in 2014, reaching historical lows in the first half of 2014. The
fiscal adjustment is forecast to continue, albeit at a slower pace.
Stable outlook for growth and exports

Romania’s economy beat expectations by growing
as much as 3.5% in 2013. Economic growth was
driven by a robust industrial output and an
abundant harvest feeding strong exports. Growth is
set to slow, but to remain robust at 2.5% in 2014
and 2.6% in 2015. It is projected to remain above
potential over the forecast horizon thanks to
improved confidence and more supportive
international conditions, thereby further reducing
the still negative output gap. Structural reforms,
such as the liberalisation of energy markets and the
new labour code, are starting to bear fruit.
Domestic demand is expected to gradually
overtake net exports as the main driver of growth.
Investment is projected to regain momentum this
year, supported by better absorption of EU funds
as major infrastructure projects move ahead.
Private consumption is expected to pick up
moderately as consumer confidence improves and
disposable income increases on account of higher
real wages. At the same time, credit growth, which
was in negative territory in 2013, is expected to
remain constrained by the ongoing deleveraging of
households and banks.

Inflation to bottom out in H1 2014

Inflation declined significantly in the second half
of 2013. This was mainly because of a drop in
food prices thanks to a good harvest, a cut in VAT
on flour and bakery products, and because of a
favourable base effect from high food prices in
2012. Annual average inflation is forecast to
decelerate further to 2.5% in 2014 amid historical
lows in the first half of the year, again thanks to
falling food prices. It is set to return to the upper
part of the central bank's target band (2.5%±1 pp.)
in the second half of 2014 as the favourable base
effect fades and the increase in the fuel excise rate
introduced on 1 April kicks in. As domestic
demand recovers, inflation is expected to pick up
to an average of 3.3% in 2015. The rate of energy
price inflation remains above headline inflation
over 2014-15.

subdued. The contribution of net exports to growth
is forecast to fade out in 2014 and to turn negative
in 2015. Exports are expected to keep growing on
the back of an improvement in the external
environment, particularly in the EU. However,
imports are set to rise over the forecast horizon,
alongside domestic demand, outpacing export
growth in 2015. Nonetheless, exports are expected
to keep growing on the back of an improvement in
the external environment, particularly in the EU.

HICP

Broadly balanced macroeconomic risks

Downside risks to growth include the effects of
faster deleveraging by households and by financial
institutions, and a potentially negative base effect
from 2013’s record harvest and strong industrial
performance. Upside risks would include higher
investment induced by better-than-expected
absorption of EU funds. Risks to the inflation
outlook are balanced over the forecast horizon.

Employment growth (rhs)

In 2013, the balance of trade in goods and services
improved strongly by 4.1% of GDP as export
growth was strong and import growth remained

90

Despite robust growth, recovery of the labour
market remains weak

In 2013, despite robust economic growth, the
unemployment rate increased somewhat, to 7.3%,

Member States, Romania

while total employment went down, largely on the
back of a decreased number of self-employed. In
both 2014 and 2015, policy measures, especially
those targeted at youth unemployment, should start
paying off. Thus, despite a continuous decline in
the working age population, the labour force is
expected to start growing again on the back of a
slowly increasing employment and slightly
decreasing unemployment rate. Compensation per
employee is assumed to grow moderately in both
forecast years, despite the significant increase in
the minimum wage this year. Contrary to 2013,
private sector wages are likely to grow faster than
public sector wages by 2015.
Fiscal adjustment to slow

The general government deficit in Romania was
reduced from 3% in 2012 to 2.3% of GDP in 2013.
The consolidation was expenditure-driven, with
total expenditures relative to GDP being down by
1.7 pps. and total revenues being lower by 1 pp. in
2013.
The budget deficit is forecast at 2.2% of GDP in
2014. On the expenditure side, the projection takes

account of the indexation of pensions foreseen by
law, a limited and targeted increase in public
sector salaries, and more resources for cofinancing EU funds. On the revenue side, the
forecast takes into account the inflation indexation
of excise duties, the excise-rate hike for energy
products, the broadening of the basis for property
tax, and the additional social security contributions
thanks to a two-step rise in the minimum wage
from 800 to 900 RON.
In 2015, based on the customary no-policy-change
assumption, the deficit is projected to decrease
further to 1.9% of GDP, as revenues improve
moderately, in line with the gradual switch towards
stronger domestic demand as the main driver of
growth. The structural budget balance should
improve mildly over the forecast horizon by about
0.1% of GDP. Government debt is expected to
increase from 38.4% in 2013 to around 40% in
2014 and to stabilise at that level in 2015.
The main risks to the budgetary projections over
the forecast horizon are tilted to the downside and
mainly relate to expenditure control around
elections and tax collection.

24. SLOVENIA
Broader-based recovery as labour market stabilises
Revised real GDP data indicate that Slovenia exited recession at the beginning of last year. A further
improvement in economic activity is expected this year and the recovery appears broad based. The
fiscal position remains fragile, also given the additional bank recapitalisation needs and the repeal of
the real estate tax. Public debt is expected to continue increasing this year and next.
Slovenia exited recession in 2013

Slovenia’s real GDP contracted by 1.1% in 2013
due to the negative carry-over from the previous
year. Substantial revisions to national accounts
data show that the economy grew quarter-onquarter from the beginning of the year, with
particularly strong growth in the fourth quarter.
The recovery appears broad-based with
improvements on both the external and domestic
side. Net exports remained resilient throughout
2013 and investment was slightly positive largely
due to EU-funded projects. A positive contribution
from changes in inventories was also recorded.
The decline in private consumption in 2013 was
less pronounced than anticipated in the previous
forecast, mainly due to the large increase recorded
in the fourth quarter of the year. The measures
introduced to tackle the grey economy, which are
reported to have widened the VAT base, would
explain the greater increases in real GDP than in
value-added in the second half of 2013.
Recovery expected to take hold in 2014

In light of the positive momentum from 2013 and
improving consumer and business confidence, real
GDP is forecast to grow by 0.8% in 2014,
accelerating to 1.4% in 2015. The key drivers of
the projected recovery are continued investment by
the government through EU-funded projects and
net exports. The ongoing deleveraging process is
expected to continue weighing on domestic
demand, although with a less severe impact than
previously anticipated. Private consumption
growth is set to turn positive in the course of 2014
and increase further in 2015, while investment is
projected to grow faster this year, on the back of
the strong impulse inherited from the fourth
quarter of 2013, and moderate in 2015.
Import growth is expected to align with exports', in
part due to the recovery in domestic demand. As a
result, a more gradual improvement in the external
balance of goods and services is projected, also
supported by still favourable terms of trade. Risks
to the growth outlook are broadly balanced

92

although recent political uncertainty could
adversely affect the ongoing deleveraging and
privatisation process, in turn weighing on the
economic recovery.

Stabilising labour market and subdued inflation

Employment is expected to remain stable in 2014
before growing modestly again in 2015. The
labour force outlook mirrors employment's with a
small lag, with the unemployment rate peaking at
around 10% in 2014. Private sector wages are
expected to continue increasing very moderately
this year and slightly accelerate in 2015, while
public-sector wages, though still frozen in 2014,
reflect the payment of promotions that had been
previously suspended; in 2015, they are expected
to increase by 1.5% on a no-policy-change basis.
As a result, overall unit labour costs are projected
to grow moderately this year and next.
Given the very low pressure from import prices
and labour costs, HICP inflation is forecast to
decline to historically low levels in 2014 and pick
up slightly in 2015.
General government deficit set to decline

The general government deficit increased to 14.7%
of GDP in 2013, from 4.0% in 2012, largely due to
the recapitalisation of the banking sector, which
cost 10.3% of GDP. Court rulings on public wages

Member States, Slovenia

and the compensation of persons removed from the
register of residents after independence added a
further 0.9% of GDP to the deficit, while one-off
revenues subtracted 0.5%.
The deficit is forecast to stand at 4.3% of GDP in
2014, including the planned 0.9% of GDP of
support to the recapitalisation of Abanka and
Banka Celje. The deadline for the recapitalisation
of Gorenjska Banka was extended until end-2014
and the government committed to use state funds if
private sources do not materialise, but this is not
included in the forecast.
In 2014, indirect tax revenues are projected to
reflect the full-year impact of last year's VAT rate
increase, while direct taxes are set to increase in
line with income developments. The new real
estate tax, which was to take effect in 2014, has
been repealed by the constitutional court and is no
longer incorporated in the forecast, although some
measures that partly address the shortfall have
been introduced. The forecast also includes 0.3%
of GDP of one-off proceeds from the upcoming
auction of the 4G telecom spectrum licenses that is
due to be completed in April 2014. Current

primary expenditure is expected to decline in 2014
due to the continued containment of wages and
subsidies, while interest expenditure continues
rising rapidly, due to increasing debt levels.
Finally, while public investment is projected to
increase further this year, fuelled by EU funds, and
decline slightly in 2015, capital transfers are set to
fall considerably due to lower bank recapitalisation
needs.
In 2015, the deficit is expected to decline to 3.1%
of GDP, based on a no-policy-change assumption,
helped by the improving economic outlook. No
recapitalisation needs have been factored into the
2015 deficit forecast.
The structural balance is expected to improve by
around ½ pp. of GDP in 2014 and remain broadly
stable in 2015.
Public debt increased significantly to 71.7% in
2013, largely due to bank recapitalisations and the
transfer of assets to the BAMC, and is expected to
increase further to 81.3% in 2015, also reflecting
the build-up of cash buffers to address future
financing needs.

More balanced growth ahead
The Slovak economy slowed down in 2013 but growth is expected to gather pace, reaching 2.2% in 2014
and 3.1% in 2015. The composition of growth is to become more balanced as the main driving force
shifts from net exports to domestic demand. Employment is expected to grow only modestly over the
forecast horizon and inflation will remain low. The government deficit is projected to remain just below
3% of GDP.
Growth will gather pace in 2014 ...

After a slowdown in 2013, the Slovak economy is
set to gain strength in 2014. Real GDP is projected
to increase by 2.2% in 2014 and by 3.1% in 2015.
Growth will become more balanced as domestic
demand overtakes net exports as the main driver.
While labour market conditions are expected to
improve somewhat, the unemployment rate is
projected to stay above 13% over the forecast
horizon. Having decreased in the second half of
2013, inflation is expected to remain low.

While investment fell in 2013 as a whole, it grew
by 5.2% in the fourth quarter compared to the
previous quarter. This can be partly be accounted
for by a one-off expansion of production capacity
in the automotive industry, but investment growth
was strong across most industries, pointing
towards a broader recovery. Investment is
projected to rise by 2.3% in 2014 and 3.5% in
2015, driven by continued growth in equipment
investment and by a resumption in the construction
of motorways.
Export volumes increased strongly in 2013 and are
expected to expand further in 2014 and 2015,
boosted by trends in the terms of trade and
improving demand from Slovakia's trading
partners. Given the high import intensity of Slovak
exports, imports are projected to increase in line
with exports.

The country-specific risks to the forecast appear
balanced. Downside risks could come from
possible delays in the implementation of large
infrastructure projects. Residential construction
poses upside risks as business confidence in the
construction sector has improved markedly in the
first months of 2014, mortgages have been
growing at a robust rate, and residential property
prices seem to have bottomed out in 2013.

… driven by a recovery in domestic demand.

Private consumption decreased by 0.1% in 2013,
marking a fourth consecutive year of decline.
However, signs of improvement are increasing:
consumer confidence improved substantially
during the second half of 2013 and has been above
its long run average since September, reflecting a
positive shift in households' outlook. Furthermore,
retail sales have continued to increase and are now
at levels not recorded since 2008. Taking into
account the likely rise in real disposable income
due to lower-than-expected inflation, private
consumption is projected to rise gradually in 2014
and 2015.

Labour market situation slowly improving

Employment is projected to increase over the
forecast horizon but only modestly so, due to its
low responsiveness to economic growth. The
unemployment rate is also expected to fall
somewhat, but it will remain close to 13% given
the structural nature of unemployment as shown by
the high rate of long-term unemployment.
Inflation will remain low in 2014

Inflation continued its deceleration in the first
quarter of 2014 as HICP decreased by 0.2%
compared to a year earlier, mainly due to falling
energy and industrial goods prices. Given the

Member States, Slovakia

foreseen recovery in domestic demand, inflation is
projected to pick up in the second half of 2014.
HICP inflation is expected to reach 0.4% in 2014
and to increase to 1.6% in 2015.
Consolidation coming to a standstill

In 2013, the general government deficit declined
markedly by almost 2 pps. reaching 2.8% of GDP.
Revenue from corporate income taxes was lower
than budgeted, but strong VAT collection and
lower co-financing of EU-related projects more
than compensated for this shortfall. The outcome
was also slightly improved by the impact of the
inclusion of the Slovak Railway Company in the
general government sector.
In 2014, the fiscal balance is projected to slightly
worsen to 2.9% of GDP. Although a previously
presented postponement of dividends from 2013
was ultimately not enacted and revenue from the
sale of telecom licences was lower than expected,
robust collection of VAT is expected to provide an
offset. A fine for a cartel in the construction sector
will also improve revenue. Since in 2013 public
debt exceeded one of the thresholds defined by the
domestic debt brake, the government will cut state
budget spending. Nevertheless, despite a slight

decrease in general government employment,
collective agreements are expected to push up the
public wage bill. Compared to the central scenario
of the Commission forecast, one-off proceeds from
a levy on regulated industries related to a planned
change to the organisational structure of a gas
company where the state holds a majority stake
may improve the deficit, while a negative risk
would come from stronger-than-assumed public
investment. In 2015, assuming that the VAT rate
will not be reduced to 19% as originally planned
but will remain at 20%, the cyclical uplift is
expected to yield additional revenue which is
projected to contribute to a modest decrease in the
headline deficit to 2.8% of GDP.
In 2013, the improvement in the structural balance
reached a high value of 2% of GDP. However, the
structural balance is projected to worsen slightly
by 0.2 pp. in 2014, partly due to additional one-off
measures, before improving again in 2015. The
general government debt is estimated to rise to
some 56% of GDP in 2014 and increase further by
1.5 pps. in 2015. This outcome is conditional upon
the realisation of privatisation plans in the telecom
sector in 2015 and use of the proceeds for debt
reduction.

From recession to gradual recovery
The recession continued through 2013 as domestic demand decreased. Exports, however, have already
benefitted from the recovery in the EU and are now leading a recovery that is expected to strengthen
this year and next, even though weak domestic demand continues to weigh on economic activity. Recent
fiscal consolidation measures reduce the general government deficit and should improve the structural
balance in 2015.
Two year recession coming to an end

The economic recession that Finland entered into
in 2012 continued last year. GDP fell by 1.4% as
the situation on the labour market worsened,
weighing on disposable income and private
consumption. Investment also continued to decline
and although exports rose and imports fell, positive
net exports were not enough to offset the fall in
domestic demand.

The forecast for 2014 and 2015 implies that the
recession will end, but growth is expected to pick
up only gradually. Recently, economic sentiment
has improved and output is expected to bottom out
during the first half of 2014. The manufacturing
sector is undergoing a deep structural change, but
the downsizing of the electronics industry is
assumed to be largely completed. Manufacturing
output is expected to grow in 2014 after
contracting for two years with the chemistry and
forestry industries projected to lead the recovery.
Production in service industries remains subdued
as domestic demand and industrial production are
still sluggish.
Loss of export market shares to slow down

While Finland’s exports are forecast to continue
losing market shares, this trend is expected to slow
down. The cyclical composition of Finnish exports
means that they are well-placed to benefit from the
economic recovery in the EU and the decline of
electronics exports should come to a halt. In
addition, the wage agreements for 2014 and 2015
portend a moderation in unit labour cost growth,
which will help regain some cost competitiveness.
Import growth is forecast to remain low in 2014,
reflecting the tepid growth of domestic demand.
Consequently, net exports are expected to
contribute positively in 2014. The contribution is
likely to decrease slightly in 2015 as import
growth accelerates. As the trade balance improves
this year and next, the current-account deficit is
expected to shrink to -0.2% of GDP in 2015.

Domestic demand to remain subdued

Despite a supportive financial environment,
investments in new machinery and equipment are
still restrained by low capacity utilisation and the
weak housing market has made companies
cautious about building new dwellings.
Private consumption is expected to be held back by
a number of factors. The labour market has yet to
show signs of improvement and the number of
workers who have given up looking for jobs has
increased. Employment is forecast to start
increasing in the second half of 2014, only after
the economic recovery has picked up. However,
the improvement of the labour market is expected
to be slow due to labour market mismatches. In
addition, wage growth is set to remain moderate.
Finally, the recently adopted fiscal consolidation
package includes measures that can be expected to
have a limiting effect on the growth of private
disposable income.
Real disposable income, however, is set to receive
some support from low inflation. Inflation started
to slow down in 2013 along with the fall in energy
prices but, due to increases in indirect taxes, is
projected to remain above the euro-area average at
1.4% in 2014 and 2015.

Member States, Finland

Risks to the forecast are seen mainly on the
downside. The recent slowdown in emerging
market economies could limit the growth of
Finnish exports. In particular, a further
deterioration of the Russian economy and/or trade
restrictions with Russia could have a significant
negative impact on Finland.
Bold decisions on fiscal consolidation for 2015

Last year ended with both deficit and debt below
previous estimates, at 2.1% and 57.0% of GDP
respectively. Both central and local governments
reduced their deficits as the tax burden increased to
45.7% of GDP.
In 2014, the deficit is forecast to increase slightly
to 2.3% of GDP. Since the preparation of the
central government budget, the economic outlook
has deteriorated, but no new consolidation
measures have been planned for 2014.
For 2015 and beyond the government has agreed
on both structural reforms and additional fiscal
consolidation. The consolidation effort in 2015
amounts to approximately 0.8% of GDP. The
measures include mainly consumption and energy

tax increases, but also increases in income and
capital taxes for higher earners. On the expenditure
side, measures include a temporary limit to
pension increases for 2015 and the reduction of
child allowances and certain unemployment
benefits. These measures are expected to bring the
deficit down to 1.3% in 2015.
In addition, the government has decided on a
growth package that will mainly be financed from
the sale of real and financial assets. The stimulus
will consist of increased funding for enterprises,
infrastructure and housing grants to special groups.
Additional public investments of about 0.2% of
GDP are envisaged both in 2014 and 2015.
In 2014, the structural deficit is forecast to reach
-0.9% of GDP, worsening 0.3 pp. compared to
2013 but improving by 0.6 pp. in 2015 compared
to 2014.
General government gross debt is expected to
reach 59.9% of GDP in 2014 and 61.2% in 2015.
The government has decided to use privatisation
revenues to pay down debt in 2014 and 2015,
limiting the debt level increase.

27. SWEDEN
On the way to broad-based growth
Following stronger-than-expected economic growth of 1.5% in 2013, the Swedish economy is expected
to gradually accelerate to 2.8% this year and 3.0% next year. Private consumption and rebounding
investments, helped by fiscal stimulus and loose monetary conditions will be the main drivers of growth,
while external trade is expected to start expanding again.
Solid growth ahead

Rebounding investments

Economic growth in 2013 was faster than
expected, in particular in the last quarter (1.7%
q-o-q, in seasonally adjusted terms). Although the
more dynamic growth can partly be attributed to
temporary factors (including high levels of
inventory and government defence spending) in
the last quarter, overall in 2013 economic growth
showed signs of broadening, paving the way for
more robust growth. Real GDP growth is forecast
to gradually increase to 2.8% in 2014 and to 3.0%
in 2015 after 1.5% in 2013. Economic sentiment
indicators steadily improved over the course of
2013 and, so far in 2014, have in general remained
above their historical levels, supporting the
projection for more solid economic growth over
the forecast horizon. Real GDP growth is also
supported by the vigorously growing population
and employment.

Construction investment has strongly rebounded
since the middle of 2013; in particular new
housing constructions in the Stockholm region
grew at a remarkable pace. Housing investments
will likely continue to grow dynamically over the
forecast horizon on the back of strong demand,
following years of moderate levels. As Sweden’s
economic growth accelerates and external markets
gain strength, manufacturing investments will also
start rising again. As a result, gross fixed capital
formation is forecast to rebound sharply in 2014
growing by 5.5%, and continue to expand in 2015
at a pace of 6.5%, following from a contraction of
1.3% in 2013.

Consumption growth remains the key driver

Household consumption has been the main driver
of growth and is forecast to remain high,
encouraged by low interest rates, growing
disposable incomes and improving labour market
conditions. Government consumption is expected
to grow at a slightly higher pace in the coming
years than previously forecast due to higher social
spending costs, mainly related to the high number
of asylum seekers in Sweden, and population
ageing.

Trade growth resumes …

After declining in 2013, both exports and imports
will resume in the coming years as economic
growth and demand in Sweden's main European
trading partners gain momentum. Swedish exports
are projected to grow at a slightly slower pace than
imports, resulting in a further gradual decline in
the current-account surplus from its current high
level.

Although the unemployment rate stagnated in the
first months of 2014, it is expected to decrease
significantly from the middle of the year on the
back of robust economic growth. Despite an
increasing population and labour force, Swedish
unemployment is forecast to decrease to 7.6% in
2014 and to 7.2% in 2015. In the medium term,
weak labour market integration of groups without
adequate skills could hamper further declines in
unemployment.

… but risks are growing.

The main downside risk comes from the country’s
high and steadily rising private debt. An abrupt

Member States, Sweden

correction in house prices and/or rising interest
rates could dampen household consumption and
render the market financing of Swedish banks
more difficult.
Low inflation period

From the low level of 0.4% in 2013, HICP
inflation is set to only moderately increase in the
coming years to 0.5% in 2014, and then to 1.5% in
2015. Wage developments are projected to remain
at a moderate level as resource utilisation is low,
while a strengthening krona would further dampen
import prices. Improving economic activity and a
strengthening labour market will slowly lift
inflation figures during the forecast horizon. The
Riksbank's inflation target of 2% has not been met
for a prolonged period and monetary policy is
challenged to find a balance between low
inflationary pressures and dynamically rising
household indebtedness. The lower-than-expected
inflation will likely prolong the period of low repo
rates and loose monetary conditions.

Expansionary government budget in 2014

The general government deficit is forecast to
widen to 1.8% in 2014 from 1.1% in 2013. Weaker
public finance figures in 2014 are due to the
expansionary fiscal policy (the 2014 budget
contains unfunded measures of SEK 21 billion
mainly to boost consumption and investment),
weaker corporate tax revenues and lower dividends
from state-owned companies. Expenditures related
to migration and old-age care increased more than
expected. Healthier economic growth should be
enough to reduce the budget deficit to 0.8% by
2015; plans for budget 2015 in the proposed
budget spring bill do not imply changes in the
deficit. Sweden is projected to reach a structural
deficit of 0.9% in 2014, which will decline in 2015
also as a result of a shrinking output gap. General
government debt is expected to peak in 2014 at
41.6% of GDP, and decrease from 2015 owing to
lower deficit and accelerating economic growth.

28. THE UNITED KINGDOM
Growth becoming firmly established and broadening
Growth picked up briskly in 2013 and is expected to become ingrained, rising to 2.7% in 2014 and 2.5%
in 2015. The strong growth in private consumption witnessed last year is projected to continue and
investment should increase while net exports remain subdued. Robust employment growth is expected to
continue. Inflation is projected to remain close to, or at, its target of 2%. The budget deficit continues a
steady, but slow, decline. However, the general government debt-to-GDP ratio continues to rise.
Brisk growth expected to continue

Growth picked up briskly in 2013 to reach 1.7%,
rising significantly from 0.3% in 2012. In 2013, it
was driven by buoyant domestic demand, which
contributed 1.5 pps. to growth; a similar
contribution to that of 2012. The contribution to
growth from net exports improved to 0.2 pp. in
2013 from a detraction of 0.6 pp. in 2012. Private
consumption growth of 2.2% was supported by
rising employment, which itself reflected resilience
in the labour market, and a decline in the
household saving rate. The pace of house price
growth picked up rapidly throughout 2013.

Growth is expected to become firmly established,
at 2.7% and 2.5% in 2014 and 2015, respectively
and its composition is projected to broaden. Private
consumption is forecast to remain a key
determinant of growth and an increase in
investment spending is also projected. Net exports
should contribute marginally to growth in 2014
and 2015.
Private consumption remains buoyant

Consistent with rising consumer confidence,
private consumption is expected to continue
increasing by slightly more than 2% in both 2014
and 2015. This is supported by rising disposable
incomes and a further decline in the household
saving rate to 5.0% by 2015. Continued growth in

100

household disposable income is supported by a
robust labour market in which employment is
increasing and productivity and nominal wages are
expanding modestly. However, reluctance by
households to further reduce savings to maintain
consumption growth is a downside risk to the
forecast.
Gross investment to turn around

Investment has been weak since the economic
crisis but, following a fall in 2013 of 0.6%, it is
projected to increase by 6.6% and 7.1% in 2014
and 2015, respectively. Rising investment is
underpinned by increases in firms' gross operating
surplus, strong corporate balance sheets, low
borrowing costs, easing credit availability and
greater confidence about future demand.
Moreover, survey measures of investment
intentions show that businesses are poised to boost
investment. The possibility that businesses decide
against increasing investment, despite improving
conditions, is a negative risk to the forecast.
Net exports remain subdued

Rebalancing is not expected to extend to the
external sector. Although exports are projected to
rise by 2.6% in 2014 and 3.2% in 2015, this will be
accompanied by a concurrent increase in import
growth of 2.0% and 2.8%. Rising export growth is
expected to be driven by improving demand in
export markets, including the euro area, and
subdued growth in unit labour costs. By contrast,
the rise in import growth reflects robust domestic
demand.
Inflation falling but settling at target

Inflation fell steadily towards the end of 2013 to
return to the Bank of England's target of 2% and
fell further to 1.8% in the first quarter of 2014.
Inflation is projected to remain around the target
level. While the narrowing of the output gap may
generate upward price pressure, subdued increases
in energy prices, well-anchored expectations and

Member States, The United Kingdom

the impact of the modest appreciation of sterling
should ensure that inflation remains close to target.
Labour market resilience continues

Resilience in the labour market, which has been a
marked feature of economic performance since the
crisis, is forecast to continue. Healthy employment
growth of 1.6% and 1.0% is projected in 2014 and
2015, respectively, while the unemployment rate,
which stood at 7.1% in the final quarter of 2013, is
projected to fall to 6.3% by 2015. Continued falls
in unemployment are expected to be accompanied
by modest nominal wage growth and a rise in
labour productivity, as firms utilise existing labour
more efficiently.
Deficit heading downwards

The 2014 Budget, announced in March,
maintained the government's fiscal consolidation
strategy. New taxation measures include a further
increase in the Personal Income Tax allowance
from April 2015 and an increase in the threshold at
which the top rate of tax is paid, pension reforms
and a doubling of the Annual Investment

Allowance until December 2015. On the
expenditure side, a permanent cap on welfare
spending from 2015-16 was introduced. This will
limit increases of this spending to the rate of
inflation unless otherwise approved by parliament.
An extension of the Help to Buy (equity loan)
Scheme until 2020 was also published.
Noteworthy in the budget is that some of the
permanent tax reductions announced will be
funded by advancing indirect revenues stemming
from changes to the pension system and by
advanced payments for tax avoidance schemes.
The government deficit is expected to continue
falling over the forecast horizon to 5.0% of GDP in
the financial year 2014-15 and 4.1% in 2015-16.
The change in the structural balance over this
period is -½% of GDP. The general government
debt ratio is forecast to continue rising and reach
93.4% in 2015-16.

29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Recovery expected to stay on track at moderate growth rates
Carried by the external sector, the economic recovery that had started hesitantly in the second half of
2012, gained firm ground last year. Output expanded by 3.1% in real terms in 2013. Growth is
projected to remain at around 3% this year, and accelerate somewhat next year, driven by domestic
demand. Investment spending is expected to regain momentum, on account of public infrastructure and
foreign direct investments, although not reaching its high growth rates of 2011 and 2012. Private
consumption is also projected to contribute positively to growth, picking-up moderately, but steadily.
Net exports carried the recovery in 2013

Solid growth of export volumes, mainly on
account of foreign facilities in the country, and
declining imports provided the basis for the
firming economic recovery in 2013. Real GDP
expanded by 3.1%, notwithstanding an
unexpectedly large decline in investment spending,
by 11.5%. Household consumption, fuelled by
rising pensions and other entitlement spending,
grew by 4.2%, even though its growth decelerated
somewhat in the second half of the year. On the
production side, the biggest contribution to GDP
growth came from the construction sector, which
increased output by 33% y-o-y, after 4.8% in 2012,
largely outperforming the manufacturing sector.
However, manufacturing production strongly
increased in the fourth quarter and continued to
post sizeable gains also in the first two months of
2014.

Investment pick-up is likely to lead to further
employment gains

Employment rose markedly in 2013, by 4.3%
compared to the previous year, supported by a
strong build-up in the public sector and significant
gains in construction and manufacturing. Further
employment gains are expected, mainly on account
of the investment-led expansion, and increased
spending on labour market measures. Provided that
structural reforms to improve the business
environment are carried out (such as a facilitation
of licensing procedures), employment creation
could be further incentivised. The unemployment
rate remained high, even though on average it
dropped by 2 pps. to 29% in 2013 compared to the
previous year. On account of the ongoing
recovery, further improvements are expected.

Domestic demand will drive future growth

The profile of growth is expected to change again
over the forecast horizon, with a renewed pick-up
in investment, and household consumption taking
the lead. Both, public and foreign direct
investment is projected to increase, given the
government's ambitious programme to attract
foreign investors, which has led to a confirmed

104

pipeline of new projects, complemented by a
gradual strengthening in credit to the corporate
sector. Household consumption growth, too, is
likely to remain resilient, in line with projected
increases in disposable income, based on
expectations for a positive employment trend,
higher social transfers, and roughly stable
remittances. With new foreign investors planning
to take up production, the related increase in
imports is expected to lead to a renewed widening
of the trade balance over the forecast horizon. Net
exports would negatively impact on growth in both
years.

Trade balance and current account
deteriorate again in light of strong imports

to

The current-account deficit narrowed in 2013 by
1.1 pps. to 1.9%, on account of an improving
merchandise trade balance, and in spite of a drop
in current transfers, which traditionally finance the
bulk of the trade deficit. In 2014, strong growth in
import volumes is expected, as a result of the start
of new public and foreign direct investment. With
the beginning of production activity by new
foreign entities, export growth would gradually

Candidate Countries, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

accelerate over 2014-15. The merchandise trade
balance would deteriorate over both years,
although it would prove less of a drag on growth in
2015 than in 2014. Mainly on account of an
expected further decline in private transfers, in
combination with the widening commodity trade
deficit, the current-account deficit is projected to
almost double in 2014. Current-account financing
will thus depend increasingly on FDI inflows and
on government external borrowing. The latter is
expected to increase given the sizeable financing
needs of public infrastructure investments.

suggest continued pressures on total spending. The
government remains committed to a low-tax
environment and plans to lower the revenue ratio
by a further 1.3 pps. to 31.3% of GDP between
2014 and 2016. Overall, the deficit may widen
further in 2014 and only narrow thereafter, if
spending is reigned in after the elections.

Fiscal consolidation strategy remains unclear

The general government budget deficit in 2013
amounted to 4.1% of GDP. This was slightly
higher than the target, which had been revised in
the autumn from 3.6% to 3.9%. In line with its
medium-term fiscal strategy, the government is
embarking on an expenditure-based fiscal
consolidation as of 2014. The 2014 target for the
general government deficit is set at 3.5%, and at
3.2% for 2015. Yet, the source of budgetary
savings to support the consolidation is unclear. An
ambitious public investment programme, rises in
pensions and other transfer payments, as well as a
further envisaged increase in public wages rather

Recovering under external constraints
Growth in 2013 reached 3.3%, much stronger than expected, largely as a result of high tourism
revenues. In 2014 and 2015, output growth is expected to remain close to 3%, supported by tourism and
related construction, strengthened disposable income, and higher international demand. However,
strong domestic demand could lead to widening external imbalances, creating pressure on the exchange
rate and domestic price stability.
Growth in 2013 was boosted by tourism

Overall economic activity rose by 3.3% in 2013,
benefitting from record high tourism earnings, but
also other service exports, such as engineering.
These exports alone accounted for nearly one half
of the economy's output growth. The contributions
of private and public consumption to growth
remained low, at about one half percentage point
each. Gross investment was lower than a year
before, which was partly due to high spending for
ships and airplanes in 2012. The labour market
situation continued to improve, with employment
increasing by some 3.3%. However, the job
creation took mainly place in low-skilled and low
wage sectors, which probably reflects the
expansion of tourism. Labour supply increased to a
similar extent, which limited the impact on
unemployment, dropping from 6% in 2012 to 5.4%
in 2013. In March, the unemployment rate was at
6.1% compared to 6.9% the year before.
Inflation continued to decline, from 5.2% in 2012
to 3.9% in 2013, and to 2.5% on average during
the first three months of 2014. Decelerating import
prices, in particular for oil, were key factors for
this decline, while price increased for housing and
communication remained rather high. Recent wage
agreements remained in line with the declining
inflation, which could help to bring down
traditionally high inflationary expectations. The
general government deficit dropped from -3.8% of
GDP in 2012 to -2.1% in 2013. However, mainly
due to weaker-than-expected revenue growth, the
initial target of a largely balanced general
government account could not be reached.
In 2014-15, tourism and domestic demand are
likely to drive growth

Key
determinants
for

performance in 2014-15 are expected to be
tourism, related construction activities as well as
private consumption, benefitting from lower
inflation and government measures to boost
disposable income, such as the announced

household debt relief programme. Some longplanned investment projects in the energy and
maritime sectors could further boost domestic
demand. However, the existence of capital controls
is likely to limit investment, in particular from
abroad. Total exports are projected to benefit from
an improved global outlook and a flourishing
tourism sector. However, higher imports due to
stronger domestic demand will largely offset the
positive effects of higher tourism revenues.

The labour market situation is expected to
improve further

Labour market conditions are expected to improve
over 2014-15, taking advantage of moderate wage
developments and new employment opportunities
in tourism and construction. This should help to
lower unemployment towards 4½% by 2015.
However, most new jobs are likely to be in lower
wage
segments.
Addressing
long-term
unemployment will remain an important challenge.
In 2014, inflation is likely to decline further
towards the Central Bank's target of 2.5%,
benefitting from declining import prices and
moderate wage agreements. However, in 2015, the
expected increase in import prices but also
stronger domestic demand could lead to a renewed
upturn of inflation to above 3%.

Candidate Countries, Iceland

External accounts are likely to deteriorate

Graph II.30.2: Iceland - Public finances

As a result of stronger domestic demand, the
surplus in trade in goods will shrink, while the
services balance is expected to continue benefitting
further from expanding tourism. Overall, the
current account is likely to deteriorate over
forecast period. However, a higher-than-expected
import growth as a result of government measures
to boost disposable income, e.g. through the
household debt relief programme, could lead to a
much higher external imbalances. Furthermore,
measures to prepare the lifting of capital controls
could lead to substantial outflows of capital.

Reducing public debt remains a challenge

Uncertainties and risks stemming from the 2008
crisis are not overcome yet

The forecast assumes that the government will
respect its commitments towards continued fiscal
consolidation, as described in the 2014 budget.
The envisaged spending reductions should allow a
lowering of the deficit to around -¼% of GDP in
2014. However, plans to lower direct taxes might
result a slight deterioration in the fiscal balance,
towards -¾% of GDP by 2015. Substantial primary
surpluses (of more than 4% of GDP) will help to
reduce the general government debt-to-GDP ratio
towards 88% by 2015.

Although the economy performed remarkably well
during recent years, important uncertainties and
risks stemming from the 2008 crisis are not yet
overcome. Settling still existing claims towards
banks in insolvency could lead to substantial
current-account outflows. Lifting capital controls
thus still remains a major challenge. Furthermore,
higher imports as a result of the household debt
relief programme could create additional pressure
on external accounts, the exchange rate and
domestic price stability.

31. MONTENEGRO
Broad-based recovery
The strong growth acceleration recorded in the last quarter of 2013 confirmed a broad-based recovery,
raising the average GDP growth for the whole year above expectations to 3.5%. A wave of major
investments started to concretise, which will drive construction, employment and imports trends in the
coming years. Public finances are confronted with the challenge of financing large capital investments
within the fiscal rules narrow margins.
A stronger-than-expected rebound

A new investment cycle

In 2013, the economy expanded by 3.5%. The
strong growth acceleration in the last quarter (by
4.7% y-o-y) confirmed a broader-based recovery
than could be expected from the drivers of growth
at the beginning of last year, and in particular, the
surge in hydropower production. Thus, the
expansion of the economy was reinforced by a
resilient tourism sector as well as the revival of
construction, reflecting stronger external demand
and gross fixed capital formation, while private
consumption and stocks still recorded some
decline in real terms.

The baseline scenario foresees the continuation of
economic growth relying on the new cycle of
foreign investments, to be reinforced in 2015 with
the completion of the steel mill upgrade and the
start of the new thermal power plant works. The
situation of the aluminium factory KAP remains
uncertain, but even in case of successful
privatisation, its production is likely to remain
reduced and constrained by high production costs.

Persistent credit growth constraints

Despite improved access to local funding by
domestic banks and some recovery of lending in
2013, credit activity remains constrained by tight
credit conditions and risk premia stirred up by the
high level of non-performing loans. By sectors,
credit to households has remained on positive
territory in 2014, providing a basis for a subdued
recovery of private consumption. By contrast,
credit to domestic companies continues declining,
hindering investments other than projects financed
through FDI inflows. Overall, the outlook seems
set for a continuation of weak credit growth in the
near future.

Low inflation scenario

In 2013, average inflation declined to 2.2%
compared to 4.1% a year before. In the first quarter
of 2014, much lower energy and food import
prices, which have a predominant weight in the
CPI index, have had a deflationary effect. The
future improvement of domestic demand, despite
still weak disposable income and banks' credit
growth, together with an upward revision of
electricity prices in August will raise inflation
growth in the second half of this year. Further
acceleration of private consumption in 2015 would
add pressure on the consumer price index, which
could register an average growth above 2.5%.
Despite some adjustment, external imbalances
still remain large

-25
2010

The unemployment rate is expected to decline
slightly, although less so in 2014 due to a probable
downsizing of KAP, while employment growth
would reflect – to some extent – the pace of
investments. Weak labour market dynamics have
resulted in a contraction of wages, declining by
almost 4% in real annual terms in 2013. Wages are
likely to record some moderate increase following
the acceleration of labour demand, especially in
tourism and construction sectors.

In 2013, thanks to the decline in imports and the
growth of exports, particularly from energy and
tourism, the current-account deficit narrowed to
14.6% of GDP, down from 18.7% a year earlier.

Candidate Countries, Montenegro

Exports are set to decelerate in 2014, discounting
the base-effect from electricity trade, while
tourism
revenues
would
continue
their
expansionary trend albeit external risks are
emerging. At the same time, some delay in the
construction of the highway and power plants
might limit the impact from construction material
imports in 2014, bringing some marginal
improvement to the current-account deficit, which
would be largely financed by net FDI inflows.
New risks

New geopolitical risks need to be considered in
this forecast. The tensions over the situation in
Ukraine may have a negative impact on real estate
investment where Russians are key players. In
addition, the number of Russians and Ukrainian
tourists (accounting respectively for 25% and 5%
of total visitors in 2013), might decline in 2014.
Tightening fiscal space

As a result of consolidation efforts, the 2013
budget performance improved compared to the
year before, despite the unplanned payment of
state guarantees amounting to around 3% of GDP.
Several measures, both on the revenue and

expenditure side, helped to bring the general
government deficit in line with the target (2.7% of
GDP) or less than half compared to the deficit
recorded a year before, also avoiding a budget
revision during the year.
In 2013, the growth of public debt decelerated
thanks to the lower budget deficit. Yet, the debt-toGDP ratio still increased by 4 pps. to 58%, due to
stock-flow adjustments from the activation of state
guarantees as well as some local government's debt
occurrence. The adoption of the Fiscal
Responsibility Law (i.e. fiscal rules) in April 2014
sets general government deficit and debt levels at
3% and 60% of GDP respectively. The new rules
thus leave a very narrow margin to accommodate
for new borrowing to start building the Bar-Boljare
highway. Yet, due to delays in the implementation
of this investment, a substantial reduction in
borrowing needs is likely, compared to the original
plans for this year (and possible for part of 2015
too) as advanced in Montenegro's Pre-Accession
Economic Programme. As a result, public debt
would grow in line with the nominal GDP rate for
2014, accelerating later in 2015, in proportion with
the intensification of the works, to come close to
the fiscal rule limit of 60% of GDP by the end of
the year.

Consumption to remain a drag on growth
Due to weak consumption, growth is likely to remain subdued over the forecast horizon. Further gains
in exports and a recovery of investments driven by the country's EU accession prospects, are expected
to support a further rebalancing of the economy. Lacking further consolidation measures, government
debt will surpass 70% of GDP already in 2014.
Growth in 2013: above expectations

The GDP growth of 2.5% in 2013 stood out above
expectations. It was driven exclusively by exports,
which grew by 16.6% y-o-y. Despite positive
fourth quarter data, public and household
consumption growth were negative for the year as
a whole at 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively. Following
strong growth in 2012, gross capital formation
declined sharply by 7.7% as government
investment spending was cut by a third, bank
lending contracted and foreign direct investments
remained far below their potential. On the supply
side, growth was supported by a very strong
performance of agriculture, rising by 20.2% y-o-y,
while, in line with the fall in investments,
construction dropped by 25.7%.
Judging from high-frequency indicators in the first
months of 2014, the uptick in domestic
consumption in the last quarter of the previous
year may have been only temporary. Following a
spike in the autumn, the growth of retail trade
turnover decelerated to 0.2% y-o-y in February.
Industrial production growth has also trended
downwards, reaching 1.1% y-o-y in February.
Manufacturing, growing by 1.9% in the first two
months of the year, continued to be supported by a
good performance of the automotive industry,
albeit far below its growth in the previous year.

Higher expenditure on goods and services boosted
public consumption in the last quarter of the year,
despite fiscal consolidation efforts and a nominal
decline in spending on wages and salaries.
Although it may remain relatively strong in the
first half of the year, due to base and one-off
effects, public consumption growth is expected to
turn negative in the second half of the year and
remain so over the forecast horizon as wages and
employment restrictions in the government sector
take their toll.
Following a stellar performance in 2013, driven
mainly by a single car assembly project, export
growth is foreseen to remain robust, supported by
improving external demand in Serbia’s main
trading partners. Investments are expected to
receive a boost from the beginning of EU
accession negotiations and increased capital
expenditure by the government. However, risks to
their growth profile are on the downside in view of
increased geopolitical tensions, some delays in
structural reforms, and the need of further strong
fiscal consolidation efforts.

Weak consumption ahead

Most indicators point at a continuing rebalancing
of the economy away from consumption. After a
few months of growth in the autumn, real wages
fell in the first two months of 2014 and are likely
to remain supressed over the forecast horizon.
Very high unemployment is expected to restrain
wages and labour cost increases may be further
limited in industries with state-owned enterprises
under restructuring, which are likely to shed
labour. A steady population decline and sluggish
credit growth are also foreseen to dampen private
consumption.

Inflation is set to decline markedly, although the
factors driving its volatility still need to be
addressed in a sustainable manner. It is expected
that weak demand, a relatively stable exchange
rate, and increased food price stability, due to
lower tariff protection, will dampen inflationary
pressures
over
the
forecast
horizon.

Candidate Countries, Serbia

Unemployment is likely to stabilise at the current
very high levels, as any gains in private sector
employment are likely to be largely offset by job
losses due to public sector restructuring.
Despite solid exports growth, the space for
improving the current-account deficit is expected
to be exhausted by 2015, as domestic demand and
imports start to slowly recover. However, the very
weak demand prospects could lead to a faster-thanexpected reduction in external imbalances over the
forecast period.

would also impact negatively government revenue
and contribute to a rising fiscal pressure. The fiscal
situation is likely to remain bleak in 2015 as well,
as growing interest payments and a large share of
non-discretionary expenditure limit expenditure
flexibility.

The 2013 budget deficit turned out below the

underperformed, significant across-the-board
current- and investment-expenditure cuts have
contained the overall deficit to 5.0% of GDP.
Despite a new round of consolidation measures in
2014, higher interest payments, investment
expenditure, new subsidies, and social costs,
mainly related to public enterprise restructurings,
are expected to keep total spending and the budget
deficit very high. The lower-than-planned inflation

Lacking further consolidation measures, the deficit

likely to surpass 70% of GDP and related interest

33. TURKEY
Growth drivers shift to the external sector
Economic activity was somewhat stronger than expected in 2013, but the growth outlook for the
following two years has deteriorated since last autumn in view of market and policy developments.
Monetary conditions have tightened and bank lending is decelerating. The lira's depreciation over the
past year is stoking inflation and curbing consumers' purchasing power, but is also helping the economy
to rebalance towards external demand.
Domestic-demand based growth in 2013

Following a pronounced slowdown in 2012,
Turkey's economy re-accelerated in the first half of
2013. This was helped by monetary policy
accommodation and a relatively large increase in
public spending, particularly investment. In the
second half of the year, growth slowed again as
public spending was reined in. Quarter-on-quarter
growth registered 0.8% in the third and 0.5% in the
fourth quarter.
For 2013 as a whole, GDP growth amounted to
4.0%, up from 2.1% in 2012. Consumer spending
– fuelled by sharply higher bank lending and
substantial employment growth – made the largest
contribution. Stock accumulation and public
spending, particularly on fixed investments, also
made sizeable contributions. Net exports of goods
and services, on the other hand, subtracted from
overall GDP growth due to a sharp turnaround in
Turkey's trade in non-monetary gold. Net imports
of gold worth 1.4% of GDP widened the currentaccount deficit to 7.6% of GDP in 2013.
Depreciation and tighter financial conditions

Turkey's financial markets and the lira were under
strong downward pressure between May 2013 and
the end of January 2014 in the context of the
Federal Reserve's tapering of asset purchases,
domestic political crises, and geopolitical tensions
related to the Syrian civil war. The yield on the
two-year benchmark government note rose by 600
basis points to close to 11% and the major index
on the Istanbul stock exchange fell by 30%. The
lira depreciated by 16.4% in real effective terms
between April 2013 and January 2014.
In addition to heavy lira-supporting interventions
in the foreign exchange market, the central bank
reacted to the market turmoil by tightening
monetary policy. Following initial moves last
summer towards a less accommodative monetary
policy stance, the central bank took more
aggressive action on 28 January. The overnight

112

lending rate was raised from 7.75% to 12% and the
one-week repo rate was hiked from 4.5% to 10%.
The central bank signalled then, and confirmed
subsequently, that it would maintain a tight
monetary policy stance until there was a
significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
Over the following three months, financial markets
and the lira have first stabilised and then regained
some ground.

Rebalancing towards external demand

Looking forward, final domestic demand will be
significantly dampened by market and policy
developments between May 2013 and January
2014. The pass-through of the lira depreciation to
domestic prices will reduce both private and public
consumption in real terms. Consumer spending
will be hit by higher interest rates, some macroprudential measures to lower household
borrowing, and higher indirect taxes. Loan growth
has already slowed down noticeably in March and
April. Business investment will also be curbed by
tighter financial conditions and by deteriorating
balance sheets for companies with debt in foreign
exchange.
On the external side, the lira's depreciation has
improved the international price competitiveness
of Turkish goods and services, thereby re-directing

Candidate Countries, Turkey

economic activity towards exports and importsubstituting output. This, combined with the
recovery in Turkey's export markets, will gradually
offset the reduction in domestic demand growth
and lead to some rebalancing of the economy.
Slower growth, higher inflation, but a smaller
current-account deficit

In 2014, the economy is projected to continue the
slowdown already noticeable in the second half of
2013. Annual GDP growth is projected at 2.6%
with net exports starting to contribute positively. In
2015, growth is expected to increase to 3.3% as
domestic demand recovers gradually. One
downside risk to this forecast is the possibility of a
renewed sell-off in Turkish financial assets in the
context of normalising monetary conditions in
advanced economies.
Annual inflation is expected to be pushed up to
8.6% in 2014, spurred mainly by the pass-through
from the recent currency depreciation, but also by
some adjustments of indirect taxes. When these
effects peter out, below-potential output growth
will help to lower inflation somewhat.
Nevertheless, in view of the current inflation
expectations, the inflation rate is projected to

remain significantly above the central bank's 5%
medium-term target throughout the forecast period.
Employment growth already slowed in the second
half of 2013. Given the structural increase of the
labour force, the unemployment rate is projected to
rise to 10.5% in 2014 before levelling off. The lira
depreciation and the rebalancing of the economy
are projected to narrow the current-account deficit
gradually to about 4% of GDP by 2015.
Public debt ratio raised by the depreciation

In 2013, the fiscal deficit of general government
was held in check by surging revenues partly
resulting from earlier changes to indirect taxation
and the social security regime. The forecast
projects the deficit to widen to almost 3% of GDP
in 2014 due to much slower revenue growth. Some
narrowing of the deficit is forecast for 2015 when
economic activity and revenue growth pick up
again. The lira depreciation in 2013 increased the
book value of foreign currency debt and halted the
previous downward trend in the public debt ratio.
The deficit projection implies a stabilisation of the
debt ratio around 36% of GDP in the forecast
period.

Broad-based recovery taking hold
Growth in the US is expected to rise from 1.9% in 2013 to 2.8% in 2014 and 3.2% in 2015, as a broadbased recovery is taking hold. Considerably lower fiscal drag and continued highly accommodative
monetary policies will boost activity. Private consumption is expected to firm thanks to an improving
labour market and lower deleveraging pressures, while both business and residential investment are set
to accelerate on the back of attractive financing conditions and improving confidence.
Recovery firming amid a waning fiscal drag
and continued support from monetary policy

Following a slow-down at the turn of the year due
to the coldest winter in 20 years, economic activity
is rebounding gradually, with the latest leading
indicators pointing to a strengthening momentum.
The recovery is projected to gather pace over the
forecast horizon, as substantially easing fiscal drag
and continued support from monetary policy will
create a more conducive environment for the
expansion of the private sector. Household
consumption is expected to firm, benefitting from
rising net worth, boosted by property and equity
prices and an improving labour market. Investment
should accelerate in line with domestic and
external demand, reinforcing virtuous circles
between construction, household spending,
business investment and employment.
Real GDP growth slowed to 0.7% q-o-q in the
final quarter of 2013 and is expected to weaken
further in the first quarter of 2014, largely due to
weather effects. However, a steady acceleration of
activity is projected going forward, implying real
GDP growth of 2.8% in 2014 and 3.2% in 2015.
Uncertainty regarding monetary policy

Monetary policy is expected to remain supportive
over the forecast horizon. The Federal Open
Market Committee's (FOMC) asset purchase
programme is due to be terminated by the end of
the year. However, the FOMC anticipates that
interest rates will remain near zero "for a
considerable time after the asset purchase program
ends". Nevertheless, market expectations of a first
rate hike seem to have moved forward to around
mid-2015, as unemployment has been falling faster
than previously expected.

Strengthening investment

Business investment is expected to pick up from
the sub-par growth in 2013, as the fiscal policy
drag recedes and the recovery broadens within a
still conducive financing environment thanks to
low real interest rates and high corporate profits.
With encouraging recent data on new orders and
business confidence, non-residential investment is
set to pick up in 2014-15, bringing its share in
GDP back to pre-crisis levels of around 13%.
Residential investment should benefit from
considerable pent-up demand as household
formation and home-ownership are due to rebound
from their post-crisis lows. Yet, housing
construction and sales have witnessed a soft patch
since mid-2013, including the first contraction in
the sector's contribution to GDP in three years. The
weakness may reflect rising mortgage rates
combined with the persistently tight lending
standards and, more recently, severe weather and
bottlenecks emerging in the construction sector
(skilled labour force and supply of buildable land).
Fast-rising home prices and healing household
balance sheets should, however, create resilient
demand for new construction. The momentum is
therefore expected to strengthen gradually in the
course of 2014.

Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America

Private consumption is expected to firm over the
forecast horizon benefitting from improvements in
the labour market, lower deleveraging pressures
and rising net wealth on the back of buoyant equity
and home prices. Following three years of nominal
contraction, government spending (consumption +
investment) should be flat in 2014 and then rise
modestly in 2015 reflecting the easing fiscal drag.
Healing labour market

The labour market seems to have recovered from
the weather-related weakness around the turn of
the year, even though job creation in March did not
yet show a strong rebound that might be expected
following the weather-depressed readings in
previous months. Labour force participation rate,
which had been falling sharply in the wake of the
crisis, rose to a six-month high in March. This is
likely to signal a certain reversal in the trend, as a
cyclical inflow into the labour force temporarily
dominates the secular decline in participation due
to demographic trends. Going forward,

employment is expected to advance steadily in
2014 and 2015, while the unemployment rate is
projected to fall to below 6% by 2015.
Wage and price pressures remain subdued

Despite the recovery in the labour market, the
remaining slack in the economy coupled with
some transitory factors keeps wages and prices
subdued. Growth in average hourly earnings barely
exceeds 2% y-o-y, while consumer-price inflation
has been running well below the 2% target and
declined recently to levels near four-year lows.
Over the forecast horizon, consumer-price inflation
is expected to rise moderately in line with a
gradual closure of the output gap.
Headwinds from the fiscal policy are expected to
wane over the forecast horizon, in line with clearer
policy outlook (thanks to the recent budget and
debt ceiling deals) and fiscal consolidation easing
to 0.9% of GDP in 2014 and 0.7% in 2015.

35. JAPAN
Stable growth ahead amidst rising uncertainty
Continued monetary stimulus will underpin growth in 2014, while the impact from the consumption tax
hike is partly compensated by fiscal stimulus. In 2015, growth is expected to slow down on the back of
further consolidation and waning monetary stimulus.
Near-term growth underpinned by monetary
stimulus

Monetary stimulus has been successful in
overcoming deflation and spurring near-term
growth. After slowing in the second half of 2013
on the back of negative net exports, real GDP
growth is set to have been boosted by strong
private consumption in the first quarter of 2014 in
anticipation of April's consumption tax hike. The
economy is expected to contract in the second
quarter and return to positive growth in the
remainder of the year as private consumption
readjusts. Net exports are also set to gradually
contribute to growth as global demand firms up,
even though export volumes have proved less
responsive than expected due to yen depreciation.
A similar pattern of a front-loaded private demand
and a subsequent contraction will materialise in
2015, when a second consumption tax hike is
scheduled in the fourth quarter. For 2014 real GDP
is projected to grow at a similar rate as in 2013
(1.5%), while in 2015 growth is projected to slow
somewhat to around 1.3% on the back of
continued fiscal consolidation and waning
monetary stimulus.
A bumpy ride for private consumption

High-frequency indicators such as retail sales or
the real private consumption index point to strong
private consumption in the first months of the year.
However, forward-looking survey indicators
appear more subdued, with the February consumer
confidence index falling to its lowest level since
September 2011. This is likely to reflect the
expected negative impact of the consumption tax
hike and still relatively moderate real income
growth. Consumer spending is expected to decline
sharply by over 2% q-o-q in the second quarter of
2014 before gradually rebounding. A similar
pattern is likely to occur in 2015 in the run up to
the October consumption tax hike, with a sharp
drop in the final quarter.

118

Moderate investment pick-up ahead

Investment conditions remain highly favourable as
lending rates remain close to historic lows and
profit margins have widened. Nevertheless the
corporate sector has remained so far relatively
cautious, as domestic non-residential (business)
investment has failed to consistently pick up, and
overseas investment seems to have been preferred.
High-frequency indicators suggest however a
moderate uptrend, which is expected to gradually
strengthen, supported by improved prospects for
corporate profits and the projected recovery in
export volumes. After solid growth in 2013,
prompted by front-loaded demand before this
year's tax hike, housing investment is set to decline
over the first half of the year, in line with lower
housing starts. Public investment should still grow
strongly in 2014 reflecting the fiscal stimulus, but
will decline in 2015 as the stimulus effects wane.
Net exports expected to gradually recover

Net exports dragged heavily on growth in the
second half of 2013 as export volumes did not
recover as expected, whilst resilient fossil fuel
imports and front-loaded demand for imports
ahead of April's tax hike weighed on the trade
balance. Demand for imports should moderate
over the forecast horizon under the effect of
successive consumption tax hikes. Export volumes
are expected to progressively recover as global
demand firms up, partly responding to the weaker
yen. Overall net exports should gradually
contribute to growth and to a cyclical recovery in
Japan's current-account balance.
Wages hardly keep up with inflation

Labour market conditions appear relatively tight as
the unemployment rate has dropped well below
4%. No easing is expected as resilient private
consumption, stronger corporate profitability, and
gradually rising export volumes should continue to
support labour demand. Declining average hours
worked and still low labour force participation (in
particular for women and older workers) remain
however possible easing factors. Employment is

the

Monetary policy is expected to remain
accommodative over the forecast horizon. Core
CPI (excluding fresh food) inflation persists in
positive territory (1.3% y-o-y in February,
unchanged from January). The inflation rate will
be temporarily pushed above 2% this year by the
consumption tax hike. However base effects from
pricier energy imports should gradually wane and
demand-driven inflation will be constrained as
long as wage pressures are not picking up.

Despite the tight labour market, nominal wages
remain subdued given employers' reluctance to
basic pay rises and constant creation of nonregular jobs. Pay rises agreed during shuntō
negotiations (around 2% in 2014, including
seniority pay hikes) cover only a limited part of the
workforce and are not likely to spread to the

Resilience of domestic growth drivers will be
tested this year as sources of uncertainty have
become more prominent. Continued negative real
wage growth remains a downside risk for private
consumption and for the effectiveness of
reflationary efforts, especially in the aftermath of
the consumption tax hike. Investment may be
dampened by lack of progress on structural reform.
Some uncertainty also persists over the path of
fiscal consolidation and the implementation of
measures scheduled for 2015.

36. CHINA
Growth continues to edge downwards
During the first quarter of 2014 China's growth rate dipped slightly to 7.4% and there were renewed
signs of financial fragility. The forecast has been marked down to 7.2% for 2014 and 7.0% for 2015,
reflecting recent data, while gradual rebalancing of the economy away from the heavy reliance on
investment is also expected to entail lower, though more sustainable growth. Risks of a more abrupt
slowdown remain.
Signs of a New Year slowdown …

China has seen continued rapid growth in recent
years, but driven by very high levels of investment
and accompanied by fast credit expansion. A
transition towards a more balanced growth model
is needed to unwind domestic imbalances and
allow for more sustainable (if lower) growth, in
line with the reform priorities set out at the Third
Party Plenum last year. However, achieving a
smooth adjustment is a major challenge and may
also entail lower growth rates in the near term.

There is also considerable uncertainty over the
extent of implicit guarantees from central and local
government.

Overall activity weakened during the first quarter
of 2014, with most high frequency indicators
showing a pronounced dip. Data for January and
February are reported together and may be
somewhat misleading due to the Chinese New
Year, but there was weakness reported across all
fronts. Retail sales, industrial value-added and
fixed asset investment all fell to their lowest
growth rates for several years, and improved only
very marginally in March. Surveys also showed
weakness, with the official PMI edging down to
just above 50 in February and March, while the
Markit PMI dipped sharply below 50 in both
months. This softness was confirmed in the first
quarter GDP figures released in mid-April which
reported growth of 7.4%, down from 7.7% in the
last quarter of 2013.
… and rising financial stress …

Rapid credit growth and a sharp rise in the share of
new credit from non-traditional sources (shadow
banking) have been adding to concerns over
financial stability. Corporate leverage has grown to
well over 100% of GDP, while off-balance sheet
borrowing by local government is over 30% of
GDP. Property-related investment is a particular
focus of attention, as property prices have risen
sharply in many cities in recent years, and real
estate investment is over 10% of GDP. These
factors have led to concerns over solvency risks
surrounding parts of the financial system,
particularly those linked to property investment.

Reflecting growing financial sector tensions,
interbank rates have spiked repeatedly since mid2013. Moreover, there has been a number of highprofile (near-) defaults on corporate bond issues
and 'trust' products (securitised loans) in the early
months of 2014. In the context of market-oriented
reform, the implicit increase in default risk could
be seen as a positive step towards reducing moral
hazard and reining in excessive credit creation,
provided it does not trigger (or reflect) more
systemic problems.
… but official
unchanged.

growth

targets

remain

The National People's Congress in March
reaffirmed the governments overall growth target
at 7.5% for 2014, with an inflation target of 3.5%.
Looking forward, the overall stance of monetary
policy remains broadly accommodative with interbank rates having returned to around 3-4% in
March 2014, though access to credit is typically
segmented and uneven. The gradual rise in the
exchange rate seen through late 2013 started to
reverse in January 2014, and by late April the
USD/RMB exchange rate had returned to the level

Other non-EU Countries, China

seen in early 2013. The People's Bank of China
also widened the daily trading band for the RMB
in mid-March from 1% to 2% against the central
parity rate. Growth of exports was solid in 2013
(8% increase in USD value terms) but has been
largely matched by imports (up 7% in USD value
terms) and the contribution of net exports to
growth over the last three years has been
negligible. The external sector will however
benefit from some modest pick-up in global
demand in 2014 and 2015 and also from the fallback in the RMB exchange rate, should this be
sustained.
Conditions remain broadly supportive of
consumption growth. Inflation remains contained
and real interest rates on saving deposits are
positive, raising the income received on the large
stock of household wealth held as bank deposits.
However, a sustained rise in consumption as a
share of GDP will require household income to
grow markedly faster than GDP, or a fall in the
saving rate, and will take time to materialise. In the
short term, growth in consumption is therefore not
expected to be sufficiently rapid to offset weakness
in other demand components, notably investment.
Fixed asset investment dipped notably in late 2013
after moving in a narrow range throughout 2013,

reflecting recent weakness in the real estate sector.
While China retains the capacity to respond to
faltering demand through investment-based
stimulus, this could further add to domestic
imbalances, unless carefully targeted. A delicate
balance is also required in the financial sector,
where credit growth needs to be managed to
reduce existing risks and gradually unwind any
"legacy" problems relating to past borrowing,
while maintaining adequate financial support for
new productive investment and avoiding an
excessive squeeze on liquidity.
The current forecast has been marked down
slightly relative to the winter forecast, to 7.2% in
2014 and 7.0% in 2015. This downward
adjustment partly reflects the recent weakness in
high-frequency data. However, a gradual
rebalancing of domestic demand away from
investment and towards consumption is also likely
to lead to lower (though more sustainable) growth.
A more pronounced slowdown in the short run or
"hard landing" remains the principal risk, driven
for example by a sharper than expected fall in
investment demand, possibly linked to a
magnification of credit problems or a more abrupt
adjustment in the real estate sector.

37. EFTA
External demand not arriving by Swiss railway - it is late
External demand is arriving with a delay in the EFTA region. As a consequence, fourth quarter GDP
growth disappointed in 2013. Official and private forecasts had foreseen external demand to
increasingly contribute from the second half of 2013. This is now pushed forwards to 2014. Domestic
demand will continue to be robust, albeit that those risks to consumer demand are larger in Norway
than in Switzerland. A dichotomy between the supply and the demand side of the economies is appearing
in both countries where consumers seem more responsive to loose financial conditions than the business
sector.
Monetary conditions have been rather loose for a
sustained period in the EFTA region as a
consequence of high risk aversion by foreign
investors. Monetary authorities in EFTA have been
vigilant as to the impact of the capital inflows. The
SNB even put in place a floor for the CHF/EUR
exchange rate in 2011, also with an eye to
developments in domestic price levels.
Still, if only gross fixed capital formation would
have driven the recovery in Norway and
Switzerland then GDP would have grown by less
than 1% in both countries since 2008 – by 0.3% in
Switzerland and 0.9% in Norway. Instead, GDP
stood 5.9% higher in Switzerland in 2013 and
3.8% higher in Norway when compared with 2008.
Excluding construction, gross fixed capital
formation would even have subtracted 0.5% of
GDP over the past five years in Switzerland and
0.9% of GDP in Norway.

faced with competitiveness issues, Swiss and
Norwegian economies appear less responsive to
the easy financial conditions than consumers and
house owners. In a context of increasing asset
prices, this constitutes a risk to both EFTA
economies.

The Swiss and Norwegian companies thus appear
not to have used intensively the loose financial
conditions to invest and upgrade their capital
stock. This is all the more interesting because, as
discussed in the winter 2014 forecasts,
competitiveness is an issue not just because of the
nominal appreciation of the exchange rate but also
because of low labour productivity growth.
In addition, not only is the contribution of gross
fixed capital investment rather limited, the value of
mergers and acquisitions seem not so much
affected by the financial conditions in comparison
with a 'crisis-struck' Europe (see Graph II.37.1).
Except for the financial crises years 2008 and
2009, when volumes dropped less in Switzerland
and Norway than in the rest of Europe, there
appears to be only a limited increase in the value
of mergers and acquisitions in EFTA in
comparison with the rest of Europe.
The supply side of the EFTA economy thus does
not seem to follow the demand side. Even when

This observation is also of importance for
interpreting time series estimates of potential
growth. For Norway, the estimate is highly
dependent on the growth potential of the off-shore
sector. For Switzerland, some forecasts appear to
be based on nearly a doubling of potential growth
compared to a decade ago. This seems on the high
side given the remaining room for structural
reforms, limits on migration and the reaction to
easy financial conditions.
The economic outlook for Switzerland

The Swiss economy grew by a modest 0.2% q-o-q
in the fourth quarter of last year The adverse
development of the net trade balance – due to in
particular strong import growth – was the main
reason behind the fourth quarter result. Still, GDP

Other non-EU Countries, EFTA

grew by 2.0% over the whole year which is
significantly higher than in the euro area. In 2014,
growth is expected to quickly overcome the end2013 dip. The Swiss economy is still in good
shape,
notwithstanding
deteriorated
competitiveness, low multi-factor productivity
growth and monetary conditions that have been
below the equilibrium level for several years.
The niche markets that partly sheltered Swiss
exporters from the worst of the crises in the past
years will also help the Swiss economy as external
demand is increasing. Moreover, a normalisation
in global financial conditions and thus a waning of
the appreciative pressure on the Swiss franc would
benefit those exporters that face a higher elasticity
of external demand. Less upward pressure would
not only provide additional support for the trade
balance through exports but also through its impact
on imports.
According to cyclical indicators the first quarter
has been an improvement over the fourth quarter.
Leading indicators for business and consumer
sentiment registered improvements. In the first two
months of this year, the level of consumer prices
was 1.2% below the average of 2008. Lower prices
added to the purchasing power of consumers. It is
foreseen that prices will only increase gradually.

The economic outlook for Norway

Mainland GDP registered a healthy 0.6% quarteron-quarter growth rate in the fourth quarter,
bringing the full year's growth rate up to 2.0%.
However, the external sector and, in particular, the
off-shore economy disappointed with a drop in real
value added of 2.7% in the fourth quarter. As a
result, the whole economy registered a meagre
0.6% growth rate over 2013.
The expectation is for the off-shore to contribute to
growth again in 2014. This will be the main driver
behind the increased contribution from net trade to
growth in 2014 and 2015. The cooling of the
residential property market will weigh on private
consumer demand and construction activity. Still,
investment should profit from, in particular,
demand from the off-shore sector.
The government sector is expected to contribute to
growth both through consumption and through
investments. Monetary policy will stay
accommodative but the inflation rate will only rise
moderately.

38. RUSSIAN FEDERATION
Subdued growth ahead amid geopolitical tensions
Real GDP growth in Russia has been on a downward trend for some time, reflecting both domestic and
external structural weaknesses, such as the economy's over-reliance on commodity exports, low
investment and lagging competitiveness. On top of this, rising geopolitical tensions over the situation in
Ukraine weigh negatively on the growth outlook. GDP growth reached 1.3% in 2013 and is expected to
slow to 1% in 2014 before gradually recovering to 2% in 2015. This already subdued outlook is clouded
by very sizeable downside risks.
Weak performance in 2013

Real GDP grew by 1.3% in 2013. Economic
growth was weighed down by slowing private
consumption, which decelerated from close to 7%
growth in 2012 to below 5% in 2013. However,
the biggest negative surprise came from private
investment, which contracted by 0.1% in 2013,
compared to 6.3% growth in 2012, mainly as a
result of the completion of large infrastructure
projects carried out by state owned companies
(facilities for the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi,
the Nord Stream pipeline).

Investment growth has been dragged down already
in 2013. This was mainly driven by a fall in
investments by state-owned enterprises (in
connection with completion of large one-off
investment projects), while private investment
continued to grow. For 2014, a further slump in
investment is expected, mirroring a deteriorating

Even though economic growth accelerated in the
second half of 2013, implying a positive carryover, real GDP is expected to slow down further in
2014 as the geo-political tensions over Ukraine are
taking their toll. A surge in capital outflows since
the start of 2014, rouble depreciation and rising
borrowing costs amid the economic uncertainty
triggered by recent geopolitical tensions have
already left their mark on activity in the first
quarter and are set to drag down growth further
going forward.
Should geopolitical tensions
dissipate by the end of the year, a gradual recovery
of the Russian economy may be expected in 2015.
Subdued growth ahead

The prospect for 2014 is for a further slowdown of
growth, reflecting current geo-political tensions
over the situation in Ukraine, which have already
led to the adoption of a limited set of sanctions by
the EU and the US and disrupted trade and
investment flows. Despite an improving global
outlook, these tensions weigh on business
confidence, as measured by the fall in the
composite Russian PMI to well below 50 in March
2014 (the lowest level in five years), and have
materialised in a surge of capital outflows in the
first quarter of 2014.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Household consumption growth is expected to
further slowdown in 2014-15 due to falling
employment, an increasing burden from household
debt servicing and elevated inflation levels, which
put pressure on real disposable incomes.
Government consumption growth should remain
stable at rather low levels over the forecast
horizon. Exports are expected to decelerate in
2014, but may pick up again in 2015 in line with
the anticipated recovery in main export markets
and provided that geopolitical tensions ease. The
growth of imports is set to further weaken in 2014,
also on the back of a weaker exchange rate, before
picking up again in 2015. The current-account
surplus is expected to continue on its downward
trend in 2014 and 2015.
A moderate contraction in employment is expected
due to both demographic developments

124

Other non-EU Countries, Russian Federation

(continuing decline in working age population) and
the lagged effect of the current slowdown in
economic activity. Unemployment is set to rise
from 5.5% in 2013 to around 6½% in 2015.
High inflation and rouble
triggering monetary tightening

depreciation

A shift in the monetary policy framework to
inflation targeting and a floating exchange rate has
been initiated at the start of 2014, to be completed
by 2015. This policy shift, together with
geopolitical tensions at the start of 2014, led to
substantial rouble depreciation (since the start of
the year the rouble depreciated by almost 10%
vis-à-vis the euro as of end of April). As a result,
inflation picked-up from 6.1% in January to 6.9%
in March 2014 and the Central Bank of Russia
(CBR) responded by substantial monetary
tightening and a large-scale foreign exchange
intervention.
Inflation is set to subside gradually in 2014-15,
supported by a freeze in tariffs for state-owned
utilities. However, latest developments imply that
inflation is likely to remain elevated at close to 6%
in 2014 and around 5% in 2015.

Deteriorating fiscal outlook

After several years of posting surplus the general
government balance is forecast to turn slightly
negative in 2015 due to slowdown in revenue
growth while the growth of expenditure remains
buoyant. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio is set to
remain very low at around 15% of GDP.
Focusing on the central (federal) government
budget, the government aims at keeping the deficit
at 0.5% of GDP in 2014 (unchanged from 2013),
increasing it to 1% of GDP for 2015. The actual
outcome of the budget balance depends heavily on
the price of oil, which is assumed to remain at
above USD 100/bbl., although gradually
decreasing over the forecast horizon.
Risks to the outlook

Risks to this scenario are related to possible further
escalation of geopolitical tensions over Ukraine
and imposition of sanctions. Additional sanctions
could have far-reaching effects on Russia, leading
to a further deterioration of the economic outlook
in 2014 and 2015.

Statistical Annex

Note on concepts and sources
1. The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fully-fledged
economic forecasts in Winter, Spring and Autumn. These forecasts
cover the principal macroeconomic aggregates for the Member
States, the candidate countries, the European Union as a whole, the
euro area and the international environment.
2. Data for 2013, 2014 and 2015 are forecasts. The source for all tables is
the European Commission, unless otherwise stated. Historical data for
the Member States are based on the European System of
Accounting (ESA 1995). Most Member States have now introduced
chain-linking in their national accounts to measure the development
of economic aggregates in volume terms.For the USA and Japan
the definitions are as in the SNA.
3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively,
present data including inventories.
4. In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for
USA and Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior to
1996.
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in
the capital stock and the difference between actual unemployment
and the NAWRU play a key role.
6. Employment data used in tables 23-29 and 32-33 are based on fulltime-equivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain, France,
Italy, the Netherlands and Austria report FTE data. In theabsence
of FTE data, employment is based on numbers of persons. In the
calculation of EU and euro-area aggregates, priority is given to FTE
data, as this is regarded as more representative of diverse patterns
of working time.

the aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange
rates. Tables 49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area
"adjusted" balances. Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area visà-vis third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of
the individual countries in the EU or the euro area. However, intra-EU
or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of reporting
errors. The creation of the internal market in 1993 reduced border
controls and formalities, and accordingly the scope and precision of
intra-EU trade coverage. Typically, intra-EU imports are
underestimated compared to intra-EU exports, leading to an
overestimation of the surplus. For the past the "adjusted" balances
are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB estimates for the euro area. For
the future, they are ECFIN's forecasts based on the extrapolation of
the discrepancies observed in 2012.
9. Geographical zones are defined as follows :
Euro area :
EA18 (BE, DE, EE, IE, EL, ES, FR, IT, CY, LV, LU, MT, NL, AT, PT, SI,
SK and FI)
European Union :
EU28 (EA18, BG, CZ, DK, HR, LT, HU, PL, RO, SE and UK).
Candidate countries :
Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Iceland, Montenegro and Serbia.
Potential candidates :
Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Advanced economies :
EU, candidate countries, USA, Japan, Canada, Norway,
Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand.
MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :
Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Syria, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates.
Asia :

7. Source: National Accounts (ESA95). Discrepancies with balance of
payments statistics may arise due to methodological differences
and revision schedules.
8. EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates.
World GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS). In
the tables on world trade and international payments,

All countries in that region except Japan and the Asian
MENA countries.
Latin America :
All countries in that region.
Sub-Saharan Africa :
All countries in that region except the African MENA
countries.
