EDITORIAL
After just a year of moderate growth, the momentum of the EU economy began to slow in spring 2014. In
the second half of this year, GDP growth in the EU is set to be very modest, while in the euro area it will
almost stagnate. Among the largest euro area Member States, we see growth increasing in Spain where
unemployment remains very high, growth coming to a stop in Germany after a very strong first quarter,
protracted stagnation in France, and contraction in Italy. Financial markets have adjusted sharply in recent
weeks as the prospect of more modest growth, not just in Europe but globally, has ended a period of yield
hunting and risk compression.
The slowdown in Europe has occurred as the legacy of the global financial and economic crisis lingers on
in the form of deleveraging pressures and incomplete internal and external adjustment. A weakness of
potential growth that was already visible in low productivity gains in the pre-crisis years has been
exacerbated by the contraction in capital formation and the increase of structural unemployment since
2008. In the first half of 2014, a slowdown of GDP growth among the EUâs major trading partners and
the rapidly deteriorating geopolitical situation, have affected the EU through slower-than-expected export
growth and negative confidence effects. With the observed slowdown of activity, slack in the EU
economy remains large and is weighing on inflation, which is also being dragged down by tumbling
energy and food prices.
Over the course of next year, however, growth should gradually rise before picking up further still in
2016. The main causes of the current weakness are set to fade very gradually, as private debt is brought
down, the repair of the banking sector progresses further with the help of the ECBâs comprehensive
assessment, the transmission of ample monetary policy to the real economy improves, alreadyimplemented structural reforms feed through, and geopolitical tensions diminish. But despite this
moderate growth, unemployment will still be high at the end of the forecast horizon and the euro area is
still projected to have spare capacity in 2016.
The new European Commission under President Juncker is taking office amid economic headwinds. The
dual challenge for economic policy consists in strengthening short-term economic dynamics and raising
the economyâs growth potential for the medium term. Meeting these challenges requires articulated
impulses from monetary and fiscal policies while at the same time addressing long-standing structural
weaknesses. The ECBâs recent decisions should improve the supply of credit to the real economy. On the
fiscal side, there is well-identified scope for a more growth-friendly orientation of given expenditure that
could both improve growth in the short run and lift the medium-term growth potential. Moreover, fiscal
space, where it exists, can and should be used to support demand, in particular by stimulating investment,
which would also support growth in the longer term. The Commission will contribute to this effort by
mobilising public funds at EU level to stimulate private investment in the real economy. Finally, the
recent fall in business and consumer confidence and the volatility in financial markets also reflect lack of
progress with the conception and implementation of structural reforms needed to improve the functioning
of product markets and to boost job creation. What needs to be done has been identified, not least in the
EU recommendations to Member States adopted last summer. Implementation and results is what counts
now.

OVERVIEW
As the vast majority of EU economies returned to growth over the course of
last year, expectations were raised that Europeâs economic recovery was
becoming more broadly based and self-sustaining. In the first half of this
year, however, GDP growth struggled to gather momentum, leaving the
recovery not only subdued but also fragile. With confidence indicators
declining since mid-year and now back to where they were at the end of
2013, and hard data pointing to very weak activity for the rest of the year, it
is becoming harder to see the dent in the recovery as the result of temporary
factors only.

The recovery is
struggling to gain
momentum â¦

GDP growth forecasts have therefore been revised down to reflect not only
the materialisation of some of the risks identified in spring, but also a
reassessment of the underlying dynamics of domestic demand, particularly
investment, which has failed so far to emerge as a strong engine of growth.
Annual GDP growth in the EU this year is now projected to be 1.3%, while
growth in the euro area is expected to be 0.8%.
Economic activity, however, should gradually strengthen over the course of
2015 and accelerate further in 2016, as the legacies of the crisis fade away,
structural reforms start to bear fruit, labour markets improve and more
supportive policies and financing conditions are in place. Against this

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

background, growth in the EU is forecast to rise to 1.5% in 2015 and then
increase modestly to 2.0% in 2016, while in the euro area, growth is forecast
to reach 1.1% and then 1.7%. Domestic demand is expected to be the major
driver of growth over the forecast horizon. To the extent that the
strengthening of the economic recovery has been postponed, inflation has
continued to decline, triggered also by falling energy and food prices. The
forecast for inflation in the EU has been trimmed for this year and next.
â¦ while world trade
slowed.

Global GDP growth in the first half of the year turned out considerably lower
than expected, mainly due to weakness in some advanced and emerging
economies but also to rising geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle
East.
A steady recovery is nonetheless expected in non-European advanced
economies, as some of the factors that held back growth in the first half of
2014 will probably prove temporary. Notably, in the US, strong momentum
in the economy will be supported by lower fiscal drag and the continuation of
accommodative monetary policies. The growth outlook for emerging market
economies is supported by relative resilience in emerging Asia, although a
gradual deceleration of activity is likely in China. Global growth this year is
now expected at 3.3 %, increasing to 3.8 % in 2015 and 4.1 % in 2016.
Mirroring the evolution of global growth, world trade weakened significantly
earlier this year, revealing a steep contraction of trade flows in emerging
markets. Despite a pick up since the summer, the forecast for trade growth
has been revised down, reflecting also a reassessment of trade intensity to
growth. World import growth is expected to reach 3.0 % in 2014, 4.6 % in
2015 and 5.5 % in 2016. Brent oil prices have sharply decreased since the
spring, triggered by weak demand in the OECD and China, ample supply
and market confidence in OPECâs capacity to balance any disruption
stemming from geopolitical conflicts. The impact of lower commodity prices
on inflation in the euro area, however, should be softened by the currencyâs
depreciation.

The euro area is
lagging behind â¦

The EUâs recovery appears particularly weak, not only in comparison to
other advanced economies but to historical examples of post-financial crisis
recoveries as well, even though these too were typically slow and fragile.
Trend GDP growth, which was already relatively slow before the crisis as a
result of low productivity gains, has fallen further due to low investment and
high structural unemployment. In the euro area in particular, growth
continues to be held back by deleveraging pressures, incomplete adjustment
of macroeconomic imbalances as well as disappointment over the pace of
structural and institutional reform. The legacy of the crisis is affecting
Member States to different degrees but spillovers through trade and
confidence are large.
Among the largest Member States, growth in Germany has halted, but is
expected to gradually pick up again on the back of a robust labour market and
strengthening external demand, while corporate investment is projected to
resume only hesitantly. The French economy is expected to register only
very slow growth in 2015 amid a subdued pace of private consumption and
still contracting investment. In Italy, GDP growth is projected to turn
positive early next year, as growing external demand is set to drive a still
fragile recovery. In Spain, GDP growth is projected to increase, supported in
particular by rising employment and easier financing conditions. Growth in
the Netherlands is expected to firm as private consumption picks up again on

the back of increasing employment and the gradually recovering housing
market. Outside the euro area, the United Kingdom is set to register robust
growth, as both investment and consumption expand at a fast pace. Growth in
Poland has moderated on the back of weaker external demand, but private
consumption is set to support a still healthy expansion. Most of the euro-area
Member States that had or have adjustment programmes are now catching up.
Growth in Ireland and Greece is expected to be substantially above the EU
average next year, and close to it in Portugal. In Cyprus, a modest recovery
is expected to begin in 2015. While faster growth in these countries has to be
seen against the backdrop of the large output losses during the crisis, it
nonetheless points to significant progress in the adjustment. Finally, in most
of the Member States that joined the EU a decade or less ago, output is
growing faster as the process of real convergence continues.
â¦ but positive factors
should favour a selfsustaining recovery â¦

Over the forecast horizon, domestic demand should increasingly benefit from
the very accommodative stance of monetary policy, low financing costs,
more favourable credit supply conditions, decreasing deleveraging needs, and
the broadly neutral stance of fiscal policy in the EU. Private investment
should gradually recover, benefitting also from progress with balance-sheet
adjustments, improving demand prospects, and catching-up effects, though it
will initially be held back by spare capacities, which remain ample.
Equipment investment should accelerate mainly in 2016, spurred by
accelerating output, while construction investment is set to recover steadily
but more moderately. Rising real disposable incomes, low mortgage rates,
and improved access to credit should support residential investment, although
less so in countries where housing markets are still adjusting.
Private consumption is set to expand moderately in 2015 and 2016, supported
by low commodity prices and rising incomes, as the labour market gradually
improves. Moreover, despite lower inflation, consumers are not expected to
postpone major purchases but to spend most of the projected increase in their
real disposable income. In some countries where deleveraging needs remain
significant, households may continue to increase their savings. As in the
spring, public consumption is expected to contribute marginally to growth.

â¦since net exports will
contribute little to
growth.

The expected acceleration of global trade and the depreciation of the euro
should both support EU exports. However, the increased import intensity of
EU exports will limit the benefit of depreciation on trade, while imports are
also set to rise as domestic demand slowly firms. Net exports are thus likely
to contribute only marginally to GDP growth over the forecast horizon.

Financial conditions
are increasingly
supportive â¦

Monetary policy in the euro area has become more accommodative since
mid-2014 and some Member States outside the euro area have also cut
interest rates. Following the ECBâs decisions, short-term money-market rates
have declined to close to (or below) zero and longer-term rates have shifted
down even more than in the US. This is also a reflection of mixed economic
data and of the slight decline in long-term inflation expectations. Bond
spreads in vulnerable Member States have, overall, continued to tighten, and
corporate bond yields have followed sovereign yields down. These benign
developments are starting to translate into decreasing financial fragmentation
and lower financing costs for firms. The bank credit cycle for non-financial
corporates is expected to turn positive next year. This improvement should
benefit SMEs along with ECB policies targeting improved monetary policy
transmission. Meanwhile, corporations are expected to fund investments with
internal resources to a greater extent than in past economic cycles, especially
in countries where the level of non-performing loans and corporate

3

indebtedness are highest. Investor sentiment towards euro area banks has
continued to strengthen amid further progress in bank balance sheet repair
and an improved macro-financial environment. The recent correction in
global and European financial markets reflects investorsâ growing concerns
about the economic outlook. Benign financial market conditions and
investment in risky assets can quickly reverse.

â¦ and the fiscal
stance remains
neutral.

The deficitâto-GDP ratio in both the EU and the euro area are set to decrease
further this year, albeit more slowly than in 2013, to respectively 3.0 % and
2.6 %. Government deficits are forecast to continue falling over the next two
years, helped by strengthening economic activity. The fiscal policy stance is
expected to be close to neutral in 2014 and 2015, as the fiscal effort,
measured in terms of changes to the structural balance, should be broadly nil
in both years. The debt-to-GDP ratios of the EU and the euro area are
expected to peak next year at 88.3 % and 94.8 % respectively (under the ESA
2010 definition).

Labour markets are
slowly improving â¦

Recovery of the labour market in the EU is progressing but remains subdued,
in line with the weakness of economic activity. Differences across Member
States remain sizable but have started narrowing, thanks to improvements in
stressed countries. The current pace of economic activity does not allow for
rapid and massive absorption of excess capacities. Employment growth in
2014 is thus expected to be limited at 0.4 % in the euro area and 0.7 % in the
EU; about the same as projected last spring. Supported by the economic
recovery and the moderation shown in past wage increases, employment in
2015 is set to increase by 0.5 % in the euro area and 0.6 % in the EU before
its growth gaining speed in 2016 to 0.9 % and 0.8 % respectively. As a result,
the unemployment rate should fall slowly to 9.5 % in the EU and 10.8 % in
the euro area in 2016, which is still above pre-crisis levels.

â¦and inflation is
persistently low.

The disinflationary trend across EU Member States has continued this year,
driven by lower commodity prices, especially for energy and food, the
weaker-than-expected economic environment, and the euroâs earlier
appreciation. The slack in the labour market and economic agentsâ low
expectations of future price developments have acted as a drag on wage
developments, while producer prices have also been pulled down by spare
capacities due to weak demand. Some Member States also experience very
low, or negative, inflation rates as part of their inevitable adjustment process.
In the near term, weak output and weak commodity prices should continue to
dampen inflation over the rest of 2014. As economic activity gradually
strengthens and wages rise, however, inflation should increase, also fuelled
by the waning impact of low energy prices and slightly higher import prices
due to the depreciation of the euro. HICP inflation in the euro area is now
forecast to be 0.5 % this year, but to rise to 0.8 % in 2015 and 1.5 % in 2016.
For the EU, inflation is seen at 0.6 % this year and then at 1.0 % in 2015 and
1.6 % in 2016.

External risks have
increased

Even though the risk of higher geopolitical tensions has materialised since
spring, risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. In
particular, increased tensions with Russia, or intensified conflicts in the
MENA region could hurt growth. Also, widespread and abrupt corrections in
financial markets could occur as the US attempts to normalise its monetary
policy, or because of increased global risk aversion. Further disappointment
about the pace of implementation of reforms in the EU would also hurt the
growth outlook.

Overview

Risks to the growth and the inflation outlook are closely linked. Downside
risks to inflation stem mainly from weaker-than-expected domestic demand,
a prolonged period of falling energy and commodity prices, and a deanchoring of inflation expectations. Lower-than-expected inflation could
have potentially serious effects on economic activity by making relative price
adjustments more challenging and deleveraging more difficult. The risk of
outright deflation, in the sense of a broad-based and self-perpetuating fall in
prices across the euro area, however, still appears low. By contrast, should
the recovery be faster-than-expected or oil prices higher than assumed, HICP
inflation in the EU could turn out higher than forecast.
Upside risks to the growth outlook are fewer and include the possibility of
stronger than expected increase in foreign demand, a faster-than-expected
recovery of investment and employment. Sentiment and growth could also
rebound more strongly.

PART I
EA and EU outlook

SLOW RECOVERY WITH VERY LOW INFLATION
The EU economy is struggling to shake off its lethargy. Since the crisis struck, most Member States have
been unable to generate or sustain strong economic momentum. While the recovery from such a deep
crisis had been expected to be very subdued, the persistence of weak growth dynamics suggests that the
EU's current predicament is particular.
In the first half of this year, Europe's particular challenges, in tandem with increased geopolitical
tensions and a loss of momentum in global output and trade growth, slowed economic activity more
than expected. In the euro area the tentative recovery almost came to a halt in the second quarter. While
some of this weakness can be chalked up to statistical repercussions of extraordinary weather-related
gains in the first quarter, underlying momentum appears to have lost steam. Recent indicator readings
suggest slow growth in the EU and quasi-stagnation in the euro area will continue in the second half of
the year, which implies annual GDP growth of 1.3% in the EU and 0.8% in the euro area. This
weakness is expected to extend into early 2015, after which positive factors, such as improving labour
market conditions, rising disposable incomes, improved financing conditions, diminishing financial
fragmentation and lower deleveraging needs, should lift growth for the year to 1.5% in the EU and
1.1% in the euro area. Over time, a healthier banking sector, stronger growth in the rest of the world
and the benefits of recently implemented structural reforms should raise the EU's growth rate in 2016 to
2.0% and the euro area's to 1.7% (Graph I.1).
Weak economic growth has so far limited the labour market's recovery. Job creation has been moderate
and unemployment rates have fallen only slightly. Since economic growth is expected to gain momentum
gradually, more meaningful labour market improvements should become visible towards the end of the
forecast horizon. Falling energy and food prices, but also the substantial slack in the economy, have
contributed to a further decrease in HICP inflation. Although economic growth looks set to remain weak
over the coming quarters, the fading impact of the fall in energy prices, slightly higher import prices
due to the depreciation of the euro, and upticks in wages should gradually raise inflation (Graph I.2).
As a result this year's inflation rates of 0.6% in the EU and 0.5% in the euro area should mark a trough,
with inflation expected to rise to 1.0% and 0.8%, respectively in 2015 and then 1.6% and 1.5% in 2016.
Downside risks continue to outweigh upside risks to the growth outlook, but the composition of risks has
changed with geopolitical risks having become more relevant. While some downside risks to the
inflation outlook appear to be more acute than previously assessed, others have partly materialised and
been incorporated into the central scenario so that overall, the risks to the inflation outlook remain
balanced.

1.

EU RECOVERY TO REMAIN SUBDUED FOR
LONGER THAN EXPECTED

According to the autumn forecast, the recovery in
the EU economy will continue, but remain
subdued, with economic growth too low to make a
substantial dent in unemployment. The source of
low growth can be traced both to the global crisis
and EU-specific factors. The recovery after the
2008-09 recession was in many countries weaker
than usual recoveries. But the current sluggishness
in the EU is even more pronounced than most
analysts had expected. This points to the role of
EU and euro-area specific factors. Such factors
include for instance the repair of the banking
sector and deleveraging, incomplete reforms, and
the sovereign debt crisis. Their impact becomes
visible in a comparison of contributions to GDP
growth in the US and the euro area during the
recovery years. Factors weighing in the euro area
on private investment (e.g. less favourable
financing conditions, more elevated uncertainty)
and consumption (e.g. weaker labour market,
larger
remaining
household
deleveraging
pressures) are making the recovery more subdued,
lowering actual and potential growth. With these
factors gradually fading over the forecast horizon,
growth prospects are set to improve.
The recovery is remaining weak in the EUâ¦

In the first half of 2014, the recovery in the EU and
the euro area has continued, but its pace was
slower than most forecasters had expected in
spring. To some extent the weakness can be
attributed to the negative impact of increased
geopolitical tensions. But more generally, the
question arises as to whether the growth dynamics
following the Great Recession of 2008-09 have
been weaker than initially expected and how this
affects the outlook for economic growth. One way
of assessing whether recovery expectations were
met, is looking at market forecasts and how they
have evolved over time. An analysis of market
forecasts for GDP growth in the US and the euro
area in the last two years and this year shows that
forecasts in the beginning had been on the high
side and were then mostly revised down
successively. For instance, the forecast of euro
area GDP growth in 2012 started in January 2011
at above 1Â½% and was then revised down to about
-Â½% in December 2012 (see Graph I.3). As
compared to forecasts for the last two years, the
euro area forecast for 2014 has been relatively
stable, showing only some small downward

8

revisions in the last months. Taking all six forecast
series together, there is evidence of an
overestimation of growth dynamics in both
constituencies. This invites a closer look at the
sources of the protracted weakness of growth
following the Great Recession, and the currently
relatively weak growth momentum in the EU.

â¦and continues to reflect the depth of the
Great Recessionâ¦

The expectation that recoveries following deep
financial crises are more subdued than recoveries
following normal recessions has accompanied
economic analysis and forecasting almost since the
start of the economic and financial crisis in the US
economy in mid-2007.(1) Estimates about the
duration of the recovery have been frequently
updated. Recent estimates suggest that it would
take about 6Â½ years (median) or eight years
(mean) to return to the pre-crisis income level in
the wake of a deep economic and financial crisis.(2)
In fact, the recovery from the recession in 2008-09
has been slower than any other recovery in the
post-World War II period on both sides of the
Atlantic. But in principle, the subdued pace of the
recovery in the EU economy would still be
compatible with results of empirical studies on
post-crises recoveries.

See C. M. Reinhart and K. S. Rogoff, This Time is
Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 2009. Using a different
definition of the recovery, Bordo and Haubrich claim that
the hypothesis does not hold for the US (M.D. Bordo and J.
G. Haubrich, Deep recessions, fast recoveries, and financial
crises: evidence from the American record, NBER Working
Paper no. 18194, June 2012).

EA and EU outlook

However, doubts as to whether the depth of the
recession could fully explain the subdued pace of
the recovery in the EU economy emerged already
in 2010 when it became obvious that the recovery
was proceeding at different speeds across regions
and countries.(3) Initially the differences were often
attributed to different exposures to the crisis,
different exposures to the immediate world trade
collapse, and to different policy responses. The
explanation of the EU's recovery pattern became
more challenging after the start of the sovereigndebt crisis in 2011(4) led to the recession of 201113. This gave more prominence to feedback loops
between sovereigns, the banking sector and
households, which interacted with negative growth
factors emanating from the 2008-09 crisis.(5)
Following the end of the âdouble-dipâ recession in
spring 2013, the recovery has again been very
modest (Graph I.4).(6) Taking these episodes
together, in the EU and in the euro area, the period
of weak economic growth is now already in its
seventh year.

the shock in the EU, in particular in the euro area,
was much bigger than the average of shocks
looked at in studies of previous crises. But
countries outside the euro area, including some
with large exposure to the economic and financial
crisis, as for instance the US, are often perceived
as having recovered faster and/or performing
stronger (Chart I.5).(7)

The longer the recovery in the EU remains weak,
the less convincing becomes the argument that this
is the typical pattern to be expected following a
deep financial and monetary crisis like the one of
2008-09. Obviously, one argument could be that

The weakness of the recovery has been interpreted as a
continuation of the recession by the CEPR's Business
Cycle Dating Committee (CEPR, Eurozone mired in
recession pause, VoxEU online, 17 June 2014).

The comparison with non-EU economies raises the
question to what extent âhome-grownâ factors are
contributing to the weakness of economic activity
in the EU, and the euro area in particular. While
some of these factors had already weighed on
economic growth in the EU before the crisis,
others have emerged only after the start of the
global and economic crisis.(8) Such factors could
include, for instance, a weaker-than-usual EU
starting position, the EU's policy response to the
crisis, the legacy of the euro area sovereign debt
crisis (e.g. in terms of financial fragmentation as
well as banking sector-sovereign links), still
unfinished work to improve the EU's EMU
architecture (including banking union), incomplete
intra-EU adjustment processes, and the unfinished
reform agenda in several Member States.
(7)

(8)

Already in 2013, GDP in the US exceeded the pre-crisis
level of 2008 (5.9%), whereas in the EU (-1.1%) and the
euro area (-2.2%) it was still lower. The same applies to
investment in the US (-1.4%), in the EU (-13.8%) and in
the euro area (-15.4%). According to Commission
estimates, in 2013 the output gap in the US was
substantially narrower than in the euro area; it was wider
according to IMF (World Economic Outlook, October 2014
database) and OECD (Economic Outlook, June 2014).
The factors weighing on economic growth in the EU and in
Member States already before the Great Recession of
2008-09 were in the centre of several growth comparisons
between the EU and the US, see e.g. B. van Ark, M.
O'Mahony and M. P. Timmer, The productivity gap
between Europe and the United States: trends and causes,
Journal of Economic Perspectives, Winter 2008, Vol. 22,
No. 1, pp. 25-44.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

Obviously, the impact of these factors will differ
substantially between countries and contribute
thereby to macroeconomic differences within the
EU (see Section 4). (9) At the aggregate level, the
EU specific additional factors could tend to slow
the pace of the recovery further and thus delay full
recovery. (10)
â¦explaining the ârecovery gapâ of the EU
economyâ¦

Comparing the recovery in the euro area and other
countries or regions is a challenging exercise due
to the manifold determinants that play a role,
including different policy responses to the Great
Recession and to developments thereafter.(11) A
more direct approach of explaining differences in
GDP growth since the trough of the 2008-09
recession involves looking at GDP components,
identifying differences and the potential causes. A
closer look at the composition of post-crisis
growth shows that GDP in the euro area was
mainly driven by external demand (net exports)
whereas the rest of the EU and the US had a major
contribution from private consumption and, mainly
in the case of the US, from total investment (Graph
I.6).
(9)

(10)

(11)

In a similar way, the recovery has varied among US States.
As compared to the trough in the second quarter of 2009, in
the fourth quarter in 2013, real GDP was 22.0% higher in
the five best performing States, but only 2.9% in the five
worst performing States, which differs markedly from the
averages in the US (10.1%) and in the seven largest US
States (10.7%).
Reinhart and Rogoff (2014) point to historical evidence of
crises with âtwin or triplet crisis scenarioâ that could
explain longer recovery periods (ibid, p. 52). Eichengreen
claims that, the longer the crisis in the Eurozone drags on,
the more it looks like the âLost Decadeâ in Latin America
in the 1980sâ (B. Eichengreen, The Eurozone crisis:
Phoenix Miracle of Lost Decade?, Journal of
Macroeconomics, March 2014, 39-B, pp. 288-308).
It would go beyond the scope of this section to discuss
policy effects in detail. Moreover, the jury seems to be still
out for an assessment as to whether polices supported or
hindered the recovery. For instance, Taylor concludes with
respect to the pace of the US recovery âeconomic troubles
in recent years have been associated with, and indeed
caused by, a shift in economic policyâ (J.B. Taylor, The
role of policy in the Great Recession and the weak
recovery, American Economic Review: Papers &
Proceedings, May 2014, Vol. 104, No. 5, pp. 61-66).

Investment rebounded stronger in the US and the
UK than in the euro area. This could reflect
cyclical factors, mainly a more favourable
economic outlook. However, the long-standing and
broad-based increase in equity prices during the
recovery years seems to suggest that investors
have been rather optimistic about the future growth
of corporate profits, which should be a positive
factor for investment. But there are also structural
features that played a role and remain in place over
the forecast horizon. These include among others
some aspects of funding conditions, the
indebtedness of non-financial corporations, and
uncertainty. Additional reasons for differences are
related to developments in construction investment
after the sharp fall in house prices and construction
activity during the Great Recession.(12)
Bank reliance versus market-based funding. One
of the determinants of investment is the access to
credit. Here the euro area with its heavy reliance
on bank-financing felt a stronger impact of banks'
ongoing balance sheet repair. Companies in the US
and the UK used their options of market funding,
whereas non-bank financing only increased
gradually in the euro area. Banks in the euro area
were affected by the sovereign debt crisis, which
also had spill-overs from banks in stressed
countries to banks in other countries. This weighed
on bank behaviour in the euro area, contributed to
funding constraints, and provided, apart from
differences in the amount and composition of
monetary accommodation, an explanation of the
more subdued development of lending in the euro
area.

EA and EU outlook

Corporate indebtedness and deleveraging. As
regards balance-sheet adjustment of non-financial
corporates, empirical analyses point to debt having
been almost flat in the euro area since the Great
Recession.(13) There is also evidence that US
corporations have cut debt more than those in the
euro area. This has been supported by positive
profitability trends providing companies in the US
with the internal funds necessary for adjustment of
balance sheets.(14) Delayed deleveraging in Europe
can be expected to weigh on investment activity
and thus to explain partly the gap between the
contributions to GDP growth in the euro area and
in the US.
Uncertainty. Economic policy uncertainty brought
distortions to investment activity in the euro area
during and in the wake of sovereign debt problems
in 2011-12. Investors, but also households seemed
to have postponed spending activity to âwait and
seeâ (see also Box 1). More recently, overall
uncertainty about the economic situation has come
to the fore. The longer the period of weak
economic growth momentum lasts, the more
current economic activity appears to be affected by
the economic outlook.(15)
Private consumption rebounded differently in the
euro area, the rest of the EU and the US. While it
ticked up only gradually in the euro area, the
rebound was rather strong in the US and the rest of
the EU, in particular in the UK. Looking at the
determinants of household spending, one might
think that households in the euro area received less
fiscal stimulus, but this hypothesis is not supported
by public finance data about consolidation efforts.
Instead, responses to changes in the wealth-toincome ratio (e.g. deleveraging), and uncertainty
about future incomes appear to have played a
major role.
Householdsâ uncertainty about future income.
Periods of rising unemployment usually increase
householdsâ income uncertainty, result in a more
cautious attitude toward consumption expenditures
and could motivate precautionary savings, which
mitigate the decline of savings introduced by
households that want to smooth their consumption

in times of lower incomes. In that respect, the
larger and longer-lasting increase in the
unemployment rate in the euro area as compared to
the rest of the EU and the US (Graph I.7) could
contribute to the explanation of relatively modest
private consumption growth. Developments in the
savings rate of households are compatible with this
argument as the rate in the euro area fell in 2010,
but remained thereafter almost unchanged in a
very narrow range whereas the saving rate was
always lower in the rest of the EU and in the US,
where the decline continued since 2009 in all but
one year.

Households' indebtedness and deleveraging. The
collapse of house prices and other elements of the
crisis had rendered household in many countries
with a too high debt. Deleveraging included
cutting consumption expenditures. Empirical
analysis suggests that household deleveraging has
progressed faster in the US and the UK than in the
euro area countries. (16) This could explain why
private consumption has already been rebounding
stronger in the US and the UK as evident from the
larger contribution of private consumption of postcrisis GDP growth (Graph I.6).
At least, the indebtedness of private households is
not only a cyclical but also a structural factor,
which implies that changes will take some time
and thus have a limited impact on the recovery
over the forecast horizon (see also Box I.2).
Government consumption has moderately
increased between the end of the Great Recession
in the second quarter of 2009 and the second
quarter of this year in both the euro area and the
rest of the EU, but fallen in the US. This

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

discrepancy is expected to hold if the forecast
years are added, resulting in an overall increase in
2010-16 in the euro area and in the rest of the EU,
but still a decline in the US. Notwithstanding the
endogeneity of government consumption as a GDP
component, the comparison suggests that the
timing, the composition and its impact
(multipliers) have in the medium term been more
important for the recovery performance than the
sheer increase in government consumption.
Foreign trade and contributions from net exports
have mainly supported the euro area during the
post-crisis years. While the higher degree of
openness in the EU compared to the US makes its
Member States more vulnerable to abrupt changes
in world trade flows, the strong rebound in global
trade in the wake of the Great Recession made this
component the strongest growth driver. While this
is clearly visible in the contributions of net exports
to GDP growth during the whole period since
2009, the observation does not hold for the current
recovery that started in the second quarter of last
year and only benefitted marginally from net
exports (see Graph I.6).
â¦that impacts negatively on medium-term
growth prospects.

As many of the factors behind the weak recovery
in the EU economy are expected to diminish only
very gradually, a continuation of protracted low
growth is expected over the forecast horizon. Thus,
despite its protracted nature the current weakness
of demand should be largely temporary. The
expected continuation of the subdued recovery
includes a revival of gross fixed capital formation
that helps raising potential GDP growth over the
average growth rate observed since the start of the
crisis in 2008, but below the average rate recorded
before the crisis (Graph I.8).(17)
(17)

For an in-depth analysis of the impact of the crisis on
potential output see the Box I.1 ("The impact of the crisis
on potential output: Is the 2009 assessment still valid?") in:

continues"), May 2013, pp. 11-13.

In other words, neither a lasting shortfall of
domestic demand (or âsecular stagnationâ) (18), nor
a very low expansion of potential output are
elements of the central scenario of the forecast.

2.

THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

The outlook for the rest of the world has diverged
even more since the spring and is characterised by
substantial heterogeneity across countries and
regions. The forecast for world GDP growth in
2014 has been marked down considerably
reflecting carry-over effects from the sharp
contraction of the US economy in the first quarter
and of Japan's in the second quarter, coupled with
rising geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the
Middle East, and a weakening of the growth
momentum in some emerging economies, notably
in Latin America. Over the forecast horizon, world
GDP growth is expected to pick up moderately,
thanks to a steady recovery in advanced economies
(particularly the US), as some of the factors
holding back growth in 2014 are likely to have
been only temporary. An altogether stable growth
outlook for emerging market economies is
supported by the relative resilience of emerging
Asia, partly due to continued policy support.
Moreover, geopolitical tensions are assumed to
gradually ease over the course of 2015.
Global growth turned out considerably weaker
than expected in the first half of 2014, mainly due
to weakness in some advanced economies and
rising geopolitical tensions (Graph I.9). The dip in
world GDP growth in the first quarter to just 0.6%

q-o-q (down from 0.8% at the end of 2013) largely
reflected a sharp contraction in the US driven by
bad weather and inventory adjustment. The
subsequent bounce-back in the second quarter (to
0.8% q-o-q) was dampened by a much sharperthan-expected decline in Japan, following the
consumption tax hike in April. Growth in
emerging economies as a whole remained
remarkably steady in the first half of 2014.
However,

apparent stability
masks
considerable divergence in performance, as the
overall resilience in emerging Asia largely offset
the negative impact of geopolitical tensions on
growth in Russia and the rest of the CIS and a
slowing growth momentum in parts of Latin

Leading indicators suggest that global growth
should start to firm. Business confidence has
improved significantly in recent months, with the
Global Composite PMI reaching in the third
quarter of 2014 its highest average level since the
second quarter of 2010. Global GDP is expected to
continue to expand at solid rates over the
remainder of the year, but the drag from the weak
first half, coupled with some regional weaknesses,
will pull down average growth rates for 2014
relative to the spring forecast. Global output is
now expected to expand by 3.3% in 2014 and to
accelerate at rates of 3.8% in 2015 and 4.1% in
2016.

Global trade growth remains subdued...

World trade weakened significantly in early 2014.
The volume of world imports fell by nearly 2%
from January through May, reflecting a steep
contraction in trade flows in emerging markets, the
sharpest seen since 2009. The slump was most
pronounced in emerging Asia, where Chinese
import demand slowed down considerably. A
similar pattern was observed in other emerging
markets affected by the Russia-Ukraine crisis and
the early-year financial turmoil following the
sudden depreciation of the Argentine peso. Against
this background, trade in advanced economies, and
the EU in particular, held up relatively well,

13

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

posting positive import growth in the first two
quarters of 2014.
While world trade volumes picked up again in
June and July (latest available data), the forecast
for trade growth is being revised down
significantly. This partly reflects the statistical
effect of the pronounced early-year weakness, but
also a reassessment of the projected rebound in the
trade intensity of growth due to a lower growth
path envisaged for some emerging market
economies, most notably China, and the ensuing
weakness in the trade-intensive investment. World
import growth is now expected to reach 3.0% in
2014, 4.6% in 2015 and 5.5% in 2016.
...with momentum in advanced economies
remaining firm...

Among advanced economies, the momentum in
the US remains particularly strong. The economy
rebounded briskly in the second quarter of 2014
from the temporary weakness in the beginning of
the year. Lower fiscal drag and accommodative
monetary policy should underpin accelerating
output. Private consumption is expected to firm
thanks to an improving labour market and lower
deleveraging pressures, while both business and
residential investment are set to accelerate on the
back of attractive financing conditions and
improving confidence.
In Japan, real GDP growth in the first quarter was
broadly in line with the Spring Forecast, but GDP
declined sharply in the second quarter following
April's consumption tax increase (-1.8% q-o-q).
The Japanese economy is now expected to grow by
1.1% in 2014, with a further slight moderation in
2015 and 2016 on the back of waning monetary
stimulus, continued fiscal consolidation and only
gradual structural reforms.
...and

economies increasing.

among

emerging

Growth in emerging markets in 2014 is expected to
slow marginally relative to 2013, reflecting a
downward revision of around Â¼ pp. compared to
the Spring Forecast. However, the situation has
become increasingly varied across regions and
countries. Rising geopolitical tensions have been
taking their toll on the growth outlook especially in
Russia and the CIS, as well as MENA countries.
Also the growth prospects for Latin America have
worsened considerably, as the boom driven by

14

high commodity prices and domestic demand is
coming to an end. At the same time, the outlook
for emerging Asia remains more resilient or has
even improved for some countries reflecting the
continuation of supportive macroeconomic policies
or the prospect of more ambitious structural
reforms. However, very weak import growth in the
first half of 2014, also suggest that domestic
demand in a number of emerging market
economies remains sluggish.
In Latin America, recent data from Brazil and
Mexico have been weaker than expected, and the
forecast for Brazil has been marked down
significantly, although a gradual pick-up is
expected over the forecast horizon. The outlook for
China remains one of gradual slowing of economic
growth, coupled with a gradual rebalancing of the
economy away from its over-reliance on
investment. Yet, recent weakness in high
frequency indicators and the ongoing slowdown in
the property market highlight the risks posed by
China's domestic imbalances.
While

prices

continue

Compared to the spring forecast the assumptions
for Brent prices have been revised down to 102.6
USD/bbl. in 2014, 91.0 USD/bbl. in 2015 and 92.8
USD/bbl. in 2016. This implies lower oil prices
over the forecast horizon compared to their
average level in 2013. The revision is less
important when expressed in euro because of the
currency's depreciation vis-Ã -vis the US dollar.
Brent prices have continued moderating since June
2014, falling close to 85 USD/bbl. in October. This
moderation of crude prices was supported by
demand weakness in the OECD and China, ample
supply on the back of rising output in the US,
stable production by OPEC, and markets'
confidence in the cartel's capacity to balance
supply disruptions that could emerge as a result of
the conflicts in Iraq, Libya and Ukraine.
The projections for other commodity markets have
been revised down since spring. Owing to an
improved outlook for supply, main food prices,
including cereals and soybeans, are expected to
decline moderately in 2014-16. The prices of most
metals have been on a declining trend in 2014 due
to abundant supply and weak demand conditions.
A modest recovery of metal prices is expected in
2015-16 supported by increasing demand in both
advanced and emerging countries.

EA and EU outlook

...risks to the global outlook remain elevated.

Risks for the global outlook remain skewed to the
downside. The recent escalation of geopolitical
tensions in several parts of the world, and in
particular in Eastern Ukraine, have become a key
risk that could have larger-than-projected effects
not only on world trade and energy prices but also
on consumer and investor confidence. A sharper
than expected increase in long-term interest rates
in the US and greater financial market volatility as
interest rates normalise in some advanced
economies could lead to a more pronounced
tightening of financing conditions. Despite their
individual differences, emerging markets as a
group remain exposed to global headwinds, in
particular the tightening of financial conditions
linked with rising interest rates in the US, weaker
commodity prices, a sharper-than-expected
slowdown in Chinese growth and political tensions
in some regions. Significant concerns remain over
the outlook for China, given high debt levels, the
weakening property market, and the potential
limits of policy led stimulus to prop up growth in
the face of structural imbalances.

FINANCIAL MARKETS IN EUROPE

Expected divergence of monetary conditions
across major economies...

The monetary policies of major world economies
are expansionary and interest rates are low, but
since spring monetary policy divergence has
increasingly become a topic. While in the US the
Fed's tapering has continued with an announced
end of asset purchases in October, very
accommodative policies continue in Japan and
monetary policy in the euro area has become even
more accommodative. While markets expect
central banks in the euro area and Japan to
maintain very accommodative monetary policies
for an extended period of time, central banks in the
US and UK are expected to raise interest rates
earlier, implying that market expectations about
monetary policy trajectories have diverged further.
In several other EU Member States, policy rate
cuts have been observed since mid-2014 (e.g.
Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and
Sweden) and/or are expected by markets, in some
cases as a ripple effect from measures taken in the
euro area.

...with more accommodative policy in the euro
area...

In the euro area, the ECB has taken a number of
measures in recent months to provide additional
monetary policy accommodation and further
enhance the functioning of the monetary policy
transmission mechanism, against a background of
weakening growth momentum and the subdued
outlook for inflation, which started to weigh on
long-term inflation expectations.
â¢ The main elements of the first package,
announced in June, were cuts in key policy
interest rates (including, for the first time,
negative interest rates on banksâ excess
reserves) and the launch of a scheme of six
Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations
(TLTRO) with fixed rates and maturities of up
to four years. The central bank also announced
further liquidity-enhancing measures such as
the extension of the fixed-rate-full-allotment
procedure for standard refinancing operations
at least until the end of 2016.
â¢ The second package, announced in September,
comprised further cuts in key policy interest
rates (by 10 basis points), bringing them to
their effective lower bound, and the
announcement of the Asset-Backed Securities
Purchase Program (ABSPP) and the Covered
Bond Purchase Program (CBPP3).
Both packages aim to reinforce each other in
activation of the main channels of transmission
that are typically associated with unconventional
monetary policies (i.e. direct pass-through effect,
portfolio rebalancing channel, support of forward
guidance). Together, these measures should have a
sizeable impact on the Eurosystem's balance sheet,
which has increased less than central bank balance
sheets in the US and the UK. Moreover, prior to
the new measures' impact, the size has recently
declined on the back of repayments of three-year
LTROs (see Graph I.10). Furthermore, the ECB
has signalled its readiness to use additional
unconventional instruments within its mandate
should it become necessary to further address the
risk of a long period of low inflation.

...financial market conditions in the euro area
are continuing to ease

Following the decisions of the ECB Governing
Council, short-term money-market rates in the
euro area declined to close to (or below) zero and
longer-term rates shifted down as well. The
downward trend in euro area government bond
yields and spreads reflected not only the impact of
monetary policy measures, but also mixed
economic data and a decline in long-term inflation
expectations. In particular, as of late June
increased geopolitical uncertainties added further
downward pressure on sovereign bond yields.
Amid an episode of market jitters related to
investors' worries about the global economic
outlook, German 10-year Bund yields dropped to a
low of 0.70% in mid-October, while the two-year
Bund yields have been below zero since midAugust (see Graph I.11).

Short-term yields of some other Member States
also went into negative territory. At the same time,
spreads in periphery countries have on the whole

continued to narrow despite recent market jitters in
some countries, particularly Greece. In the US, 10year sovereign yields also fell, amid more
favourable macroeconomic data and the prospect
of an end of bond purchases by the Federal
Reserve, but markedly less than in the euro area.
Corporate bond yields have fallen almost in
parallel with sovereign yields (see Graph I.12).
Meanwhile, issuance of lower-rated debt by
European corporates has been buoyant, backed by
strong investor demand. EU stock markets have
had a more volatile journey, amid mounting
geopolitical tensions and mixed economic data.
Volatility in equity and lower-rated corporate debt
markets has picked up recently, driven by
economic growth concerns.

Investor sentiment towards euro area banks has
continued to strengthen amid further progress in
bank balance sheet repair and an improved macrofinancial environment. EU banks have increased
their capital levels in recent years, thereby
increasing their resilience to market conditions. So
far in 2014, the build-up of capital buffers in
anticipation of the ECB's comprehensive
assessment and the EBA Stress Test has exceeded
EUR 100 bn. Bank funding has improved further
in the euro area with declining cross-country
interest rate differentials in both market and
deposit-based funding. This suggests receding
market fragmentation. However, risks for the
European banking sector persist as banks remain
vulnerable to a potential asset-price reversal in
global markets, particularly via their exposures to
compressed bond market premia.

EA and EU outlook

â¦bank lending continued declining, albeit at
a slower paceâ¦

â¦whereas the latest ECB Bank Lending Survey
suggests an improved outlook

The current slowdown in the contraction of bank
lending to the private sector is compatible with the
occurrence of a turning point in euro area loan
dynamics in the second quarter of the year. The
annual growth rate of loans to the private sector
stood in August at -0.9% (adjusted for loan sales
and securitisation), thus lower than in the
preceding months (e.g. in April the rate stood
at -1.6%). Meanwhile, market funding via net
issuance of debt securities by non-financial
corporations (NFCs) continued to be buoyant
(increasing 8.0% y-o-y in August from 6.2% in
April), almost offsetting the weakness in bank
lending and bringing the overall growth rate of
debt funding to non-financial corporates close to
zero. These figures signal an ongoing transition
towards market financing, mainly by larger
corporations with access to bond markets. At the
same time those corporations traditionally
dependent on bank finance, mainly SMEs,
continue to see falling lending volumes (Graph
I.13).

The July 2014 ECB Bank Lending Survey bodes
well for the demand for bank loans as demand was
reported to have risen for all types of loans. For
NFCs financing needs related to fixed investment
had a positive contribution to loan demand for the
first time since the second quarter of 2011. For the
third quarter of 2014, banks expected stronger
demand, particularly coming from NFCs (see
Graph I.14). On the supply side, the survey
signalled a net easing of credit standards for
enterprises for the first time since the second
quarter of 2007, whereas banks continued to ease
credit standards in net terms for loans to
households.

Narrowing interest rate differentials across euroarea countries suggest that supply constraints have
somewhat receded in a number of countries. Still
subdued demand for bank loans currently seems to
play a more important role in the weakness of
credit flows to NFCs. Corporations continue to
resort extensively to internal funds for their
investments as evidenced by still very high selffunding ratios, particularly in stressed Member
States and in Germany. The relatively high rate of
corporate savings suggests that the corporate sector
as a whole may have sufficient internal funds to
increase its low level of investment but that it
refrains from doing so due for instance to the
uncertainty of economic prospects.

Historical trends show that the credit cycle for
NFCs tend to lag the economic cycle by several
quarters. Based on this relationship, the bank credit
cycle for NFCs is expected to turn positive next
year. This improvement should benefit SMEs on
the back of ECB policies targeting improved
monetary policy transmission and increased
volumes of bank lending to SMEs. Market funding
may continue to grow in importance but overall,
external funding is expected to remain relatively
weaker compared with the usual cyclical patterns.
Corporations are expected to fund investments
internally on a larger scale than in past economic
cycles, especially in countries where corporate
indebtedness is highest and most distressed.
Risks to the assumption of benign financial market
conditions underlying this forecast are mainly
related to the current pricing of risky assets.
Financial market valuations up to autumn appear
to be based on the scenario of an increasing or at
least constant momentum of the EU economic
recovery, a continuation of fiscal, structural and

Meagre GDP growth in the first half of 2014â¦

The fragile recovery that had started in the EU and
in the euro area (19) in the second quarter of last
year continues, but it struggled to gather
momentum in the first half of this year. While
semi-annual growth in the EU remained almost
unchanged at 0.7%, the euro area recorded a
slightly increased pace of 0.5% (up from 0.4% in
the second half of 2013), both below previous
forecasts. This is a difference with the previous
recovery that gained more growth momentum over
time (applied to the equivalent period, semi-annual
growth increased in the EU from 0.9% to 1.5% and
in the euro area from 0.8% to 1.4%).
After emerging from recession, most Member
States have up to mid-2014 been unable to
generate strong economic momentum. At the
aggregate EU level, the current recovery has
comprised five quarters of moderate expansion up
to mid-2014, totalling GDP growth of 1.7%.
Reflecting a only modest growth in several large
Member States, the euro area only achieved total
GDP growth of 1.1% in these five quarters. In both
areas the rebound in the first five quarters of the
recovery was weaker than the rebound of the
recovery that started in the third quarter of 2009
and lifted GDP in both the EU and the euro area by
2.7%. The difference between both rebounds could
be seen as evidence of factors hampering
economic growth in the EU, which add to those
already observed in the wake of the Great
Recession between end-2007 and mid-2009.
â¦with uneven distribution over quartersâ¦

The meagre economic growth in the first half of
the year (see Graphs I.1, I.15, and I.16) was
unevenly distributed across the first two quarters,
reflecting the impact of temporary factors such as

Reflecting the upcoming entry of Lithuania in the euro area

has a weight of about 0.3% in the euro-area aggregate.

In both the EU and the euro area GDP growth
slowed by 0.2 pp. in the second quarter to 0.2% (qo-q) and 0.1% respectively. While some Member
States reported robust output expansion in the
second quarter and others succeeded in further
catching up, dismal performances from three of the
largest economies were responsible for weak
economic growth in the euro area as a whole. In
the second quarter of this year, Germany's GDP
contracted by 0.2% q-o-q after growing by 0.7% in
the first quarter, pulled down by the unwinding of
weather-related factors in the first quarter. Italy
extended its period without positive growth rates,
which had already started in the second quarter of
2011 (-0.2%, following stagnation in the first
quarter of this year). Activity in France meanwhile
stagnated for a second consecutive quarter.
Developments in these three countries contrasted
in the second quarter with upturns in the UK

â¦and a limited contribution from domestic
demand

The breakdown of GDP shows that lacklustre
economic growth in the EU has been mostly due to
the sluggishness of domestic demand, in particular
of gross fixed capital formation. Investment failed
to accelerate and even declined in the second
quarter, following four quarters of expansion.
Private investment (business and households) has
been persistently weak, held back by the need to
deleverage in a context of low inflation and low
demand expectations, whereas funding conditions
have improved in a number of countries. By
contrast, private consumption has continued to
recover, in line with slightly improving disposable
income on the back of higher (nominal) labour
incomes and lower consumer price inflation. Net
exports were slightly supportive to growth in the
euro area but neutral in the EU.
The GDP breakdown at the Member State level
reveals substantial differences. In the first two
quarters of this year, in terms of GDP growth rates
and the main components there were no clear signs

that the recovery is becoming regionally more
balanced. While some stressed countries saw
domestic demand becoming the main driver of
growth (e.g. Spain, Portugal, Ireland), others
benefitted mainly from the contribution of net
exports (e.g. Italy). Also across core countries, no
common growth pattern was identifiable. While in
France most GDP components, if at all,
contributed only marginally, in Germany domestic
demand expanded moderately amid high quarterly
volatility. In the Netherlands, exports remained an
important engine of growth as incidental factors
dragged down domestic demand.
Looking at the euro area as a whole, only moderate
growth is expected over the forecast horizon,
whereas in other EU Member States, economic
growth is expected to be much stronger, reflecting
the strong growth performance of the UK and
Poland, but also the renewed catching-up process
in some of the new Member States.
Weak economic activity in the near termâ¦

The latest readings of survey indicators point to a
loss of cyclical growth momentum in the second
half of the year. After moving in a relatively
narrow range of less than two points in the first six
months of the year (following an increase by about
15 points since autumn 2012), the Commission's
Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) decreased in

the third quarter, ending a year of quarterly
improvements, both in the EU and the euro area.
In September, the ESI in the euro area was back to
its the lowest level since November last year,
standing marginally below its long-term average.
For the EU, the ESI in September has also fallen to
the lowest level since November, but remained
clearly above its long-term average, mainly on
account of high readings in the UK (Graph I.17).
Among sectors covered by surveys only
construction continued to display rising
confidence, albeit still at relatively low levels.
Confidence in manufacturing fell, which could be
associated with the sluggishness of the global
economy and the mounting geopolitical tensions
over the summer. Production expectations in the
manufacturing sector also fell in the three months
to September both in the EU and the euro area,
suggesting that production will most likely remain
sluggish in the last quarter of this year. The
services and retail sectors with their strong
domestic focus appeared to be less affected by
global developments, but also saw falling
confidence.
While overall readings remain above the nochange-threshold in both the EU and the euro area,
declines in the Composite PMIs were observed in
August and September (in the euro area to 52.3,

20

the lowest reading in the past nine months),
signalling that output is lurching closer towards
stagnation. In the manufacturing sector, the PMI
eased quite substantially in the nine months to
September (by 3.7 points) and at 50.3, now stands
close to the level registered around mid-2013. In
the services sector, the PMI points to an increase in
economic momentum in the third quarter. While
the slowdown in manufacturing was relatively
broad-based across countries, the composite PMIs
pointed to persistent heterogeneity.

Monthly hard data for the third quarter of the year
also point to weak developments. In the EU and
the euro area, industrial production in July and
August was on average marginally lower than in

EA and EU outlook

the two preceding months and slightly lower than
in each of the three quarters before. The lack of
momentum is in line with the signals given by
survey indicators and also points to already very
modest economic activity in the third quarter.
The quarterly patterns of GDP growth in the
second half of the year are expected to be less
erratic as the impact of previously distorting
factors fades away and further holiday effects
visible in monthly data (e.g. on economic activity
in Germany) are offsetting each other within the
third quarter. Thus the expected relative weakness
of economic activity should be visible in both the
third and the fourth quarter, resulting in a further
slowing of growth in the second half of the year as
compared to the first, in both the EU and the euro
area. In the latter, this forecast implies near
stagnation in the last two quarters of the year.
Against this background, the forecast for annual
GDP growth in 2014 is 0.8% in the euro area and
1.3% in the EU.
...followed by some uptick over the course of
2015â¦

The outlook for early 2015 is for a slow pace of
economic growth, still reflecting the impact of
heightened geopolitical concerns, the complex and
protracted economic and institutional adjustments
in the aftermath of the economic, financial and
sovereign-debt crises, high unemployment and low
capacity utilisation.
Over time, the brakes that continue to hold back
domestic demand are expected to release
somewhat (Graph I.18). Demand should then
increasingly benefit from the very accommodative
monetary policy stance and low financing costs,
more favourable and homogeneous credit supply
conditions, and the broadly neutral fiscal stance.
Private consumption is set to enjoy the support of
low commodity prices and rising incomes, as the
labour market gradually improves. Gross fixed
capital formation should also benefit from a
reduced need for balance-sheet adjustments and
from catching-up effects following years of
subdued activity, though it will initially still be
held back by ample spare capacities. As regards
exports, the expected acceleration of global trade
together with the depreciation of the euro's
effective exchange rate, should benefit EU
products, pushing production and activity up to
meet expected foreign demand.

GDP (y-o-y%)

Overall, in 2015, annual GDP growth in the EU is
expected to increase to 1.5% and to 1.1% in the
euro area. The annual growth forecasts include a
positive working-day effect as several public
holidays (e.g. May 1, August 15, and November 1)
will fall over the weekend, thereby increasing the
number of working days in most countries as
compared to this year.
â¦and more solid economic growth in 2016.

Starting in 2015, the lagged impact of recent
policy actions should begin to feed through to
domestic demand. This includes the impact of
monetary policy measures in the EU (e.g. the
decisions mentioned in Section 3), the banking
sector's follow-up to the comprehensive
assessment, and the beneficial effect of structural
reforms (20) undertaken in the recent past.
In 2016, with further strengthening domestic and
foreign demand and the continuation of very
accommodative monetary policy associated with
low financing costs, economic activity should gain
momentum. Slightly improving labour market
conditions, a broadly neutral fiscal stance under
the no-policy-change assumption, and diminishing
deleveraging needs for households and companies
add to these positive factors even if, in several
Member States, balance sheet repair and
deleveraging will have to continue (see Box I.2).

structural reforms in Southern Europe: The case of Greece,
Italy, Spain and Portugal, European Economy Economic
Papers no. 511, December 2013. By contrast, Eggertsson,
Ferrero and Raffo argue that structural reforms do not
improve output during crisis, but may even entail near-term
contractionary effects â a result that can be associated with
the absence of physical capital in their DSGE model (G.
Eggertsson, A. Ferrero, and A. Raffo, Can structural
reforms help Europe?, Journal of Monetary Economics,
January 2014, Vol. 61, pp. 2-22).

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

Moreover, the lagged impact of already
implemented measures, including structural
reforms, will be felt more strongly towards the end
of the forecast horizon.
With these drivers of economic growth in place,
the outlook for the EU economy for 2016 is rather
favourable. Annual GDP growth is expected to
increase to 2.0% in the EU and 1.7% in the euro
area. Thus, over the whole forecast horizon,
economic growth is projected to remain above
potential. However, the strength of the cyclical
recovery will not be sufficient to markedly narrow
the output gap in the euro area, which will likely
remain significantly negative at the end of the
forecast horizon.
Cross-country growth differences persist...

A closer inspection of developments in economic
activity at the level of the Member States shows
that not only the EU has last year turned the corner
from recession to a weak recovery, but also a vast
majority of Member States. Last year this
development had been hidden in the annual GDP
growth rates due to the large carry-over from the
beginning of the year, but in 2014 the upturn is
visible as only four countries (Croatia, Cyprus,
Finland, and Italy) will exhibit negative annual
growth.
In the first half of 2014, temporary factors added to
the cross-country diversity. While several one-off
factors pushed activities in some countries in the
first quarter and pulled it down in the second, other
were either not that much affected or even showed
opposite profiles. Among these factors were
holiday-related effects and weather effects that
were not eliminated by seasonal and working-day
adjustment. Especially the unwinding of these
effects in the second quarter pushed German
growth rates into negative territory (-0.2% q-o-q),
whereas the opposite impact was observed in the
Netherlands. There the lower energy production
dampened economic activity in the first quarter,
followed by a rebound of activity in the second
quarter.
...and are forecast to diminish only slowly.

In the near term substantial differences in
economic performance are expected to persist. The
German economy is expected to stay close to
stagnation in the third and fourth quarter; France is
expected to start exhibiting moderate growth

22

again, whereas economic activity in Spain should
continue expanding albeit at a slower pace than in
the second quarter. Italyâs economy is expected to
fall back into technical recession in the third
quarter and to continue shrinking in the fourth
quarter. The other three large economies (the
Netherlands, Poland and the UK) are expected to
continue growing though at lower rates than in the
second quarter. Among the smaller countries, only
Croatia is expected to return to technical recession.
Some of the formerly stressed countries (e.g.
Ireland, Portugal, and Slovenia) are projected to
succeed in proceeding with their recoveries and
economic growth in some of the New Member
States (e.g. Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania) is
expected to exceed the EU average allowing them
to catch up further. This diversity of development
within the current year is mirrored in a broad range
of annual growth rates, which spans between 2.8% (Cyprus) and 4.6% (Ireland).
Looking ahead, the continuation of the subdued
recovery in the EU economy should include all
economies. In both 2015 and 2016, all Member
States are forecast to enjoy a simultaneous
expansion of economic activity for the first time in
ten years. The relatively moderate start into the
next year implies that the gains in terms of annual
GDP growth will remain limited in most countries
and some of the currently fast growing countries
are even projected to suffer small setbacks in 2015
(e.g. Ireland, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, the
UK). The brighter outlook for the EU economy in
2016 is reflected in an acceleration of economic
activity in all but four Member States (Malta,
Czech Republic, Hungary, and the UK).
Looking at total economic growth in years 201416, among the largest Member States Poland
(9.4%), the UK (8.4%) and Spain (5.3%) are
expected to outperform the EU average of 4.8%,
whereas Germany (4.3%) and the Netherlands
(4.0%) outperform the euro area average (3.7%),
and France (2.6%) and Italy (1.4%) are trailing
both averages. Among the smaller Member States,
the strongest performance is expected in Ireland
(12.4%), Lithuania (9.5%), Latvia (9.3%), Malta
(8.9%), Luxembourg (8.5%), Slovakia (8.4%), the
Czech Republic (8.2%), and Hungary (7.9%).
Putting weights to the country forecasts allows
assessing the contributions of Member States to
GDP growth in the EU (Graph I.19). The analysis
of country contributions during the three forecast
years shows that contributions by the seven largest
Member States should account for about three

EA and EU outlook

quarters of economic growth in the EU, which is
also roughly their weight in GDP in the EU. The
largest contributions are expected to come from
the UK (1.4 pps.) and Germany (0.9 pp.).

decade before the crisis (21.5% and 22.1%
between 1998 and 2007, respectively). Obviously,
a comparison of total investment in the year before
the crisis (2007) and developments in subsequent
years points to larger movements as the base year
then includes the boom in construction investment
in some Member States (see e.g. Graph I.21).

Relating the growth performance to estimated
developments in potential output allows assessing
the cyclical situation (Graph I.20). Among the
Member States the cyclical positions continue to
differ a lot. The UK is the only of the seven largest
Member States that is expected to fully close the
output gap over the forecast horizon. Among the
largest economies, Germany and Poland are
expected to have relatively narrow output gaps,
whereas a substantial output gap is estimated in
Spain and Italy, where a steady narrowing is
projected over the forecast horizon. Germany,
France and Italy are expected to face a widening
output gap this year. However, gaps that look
narrow in a cross-country comparison can
substantial for the individual country in historical
perspective.
Rebound in gross fixed capital formation
gradually interrupted...

Accelerating investment is indispensable for any
economic recovery. The relative weakness of gross
fixed capital formation (total investment) has been
a key factor responsible for the recent period of
subdued economic growth. The weakness reflects
low demand growth, low levels of capacity
utilisation, heightened economic and policy
uncertainty, and, in some countries, corporate
deleveraging and financing constraints. In
historical perspective, the relatively weak rebound

In the near term, a moderate rebound in total
investment is expected that comprises modest
growth in equipment and construction. This
outlook is supported by survey results such as the
still positive assessment of total and export order
books in the EU and the euro area and by
production expectations in the third quarter, which
continue to exceed their long-term averages. In
construction, gains in real disposable income and
more favourable financing conditions should
provide support for a resumption of growth.

â¦and a further pick-up is expected towards
the end of the forecast horizon...

Looking further ahead, cyclical factors (e.g.
demand prospects, capacity utilisation) should gain
importance as drags from the legacy of the initial
global crisis (e.g. corporate balance-sheet repair)
and
EU-specific
factors
(e.g.
financial
fragmentation
and
impaired
monetary
transmission, possible funding constraints in the
run-up to banking union, policy uncertainty)
gradually recede. Recent developments in the
European Economic Policy Uncertainty Index give
an example for this expected change in the role of
determinants of gross fixed capital formation. The
smoothened index (6-month average) has fallen in
the past two years, but the investment-to-GDP
ratio has yet failed to pick up in the EU (Graph
I.22) raising doubts whether the previously
observed relationship between policy uncertainty
and investment still holds. (21)

the assessment of investment projects. Cost and
availability of external finance have been
additional impediments in some Member States.
The projected gradual pick-up of demand,
including from abroad, should raise incentives to
carry out investment in 2015. Improvements in the
external funding situation, and the continued
availability of internal funding, which should keep
growing as profits and margins increase along with
the economy, should also support investment
spending. On the negative side, the adverse impact
of lower trend growth and further corporate
balance

restructuring
(corporate
deleveraging) in some Member States will
continue dampening investment. All in all,
equipment investment in the euro area is set to
grow 2.4% in 2014, 3.0% in 2015, and 5.9% in
2016 when accelerating output should spur growth
in investment (see Graph I.23). In the EU, growth
rates are projected to be slightly higher at
respectively 3.7%, 3.6% and 6.0% in the forecast
years.

Capacity utilisation rate (rhs)

Construction investment, which constitutes about
half of total investment, is set to shrink in 2014 in
the euro area and to expand only slightly in the EU
as a result of booming residential investment in the
UK. This is due to the slow start to the year but
also the moderate outlook for the near term.
Leading indicators such as building permits
increased in the first half of 2014 in both the EU
and the euro area offsetting declines observed in
the second half of last year. However, permits
stand at less than half the pre-crisis level and are
still substantially lower than in 2010 (-14% in the
EU, -23% in the euro area). Average construction
output in July and August remained almost
unchanged from the average in the first half of the
year in the EU, but was 0.9% higher in the euro
area, strongly driven by the expansion of

EA and EU outlook

construction output in Spain, which was up 24%
(y-o-y) in the second quarter of this year.
Construction confidence has increased steadily
over recent months, with the most pronounced
gains in Spain. Further out, increased real
disposable income, low mortgage rates amid the
full pass-through of lower financing costs and
improved access to credit for private households
should support residential investment. However,
ongoing housing market adjustments continue to
weigh on residential investment in some Member
States (particularly France, Italy and to a lesser
extent Spain). Non-residential construction should
benefit from higher equipment investment and
corporates getting easier access to funding. This
should be reflected in a moderate expansion in
2015 and some acceleration in 2016.
Government investment, which accounts for about
15% of total investment, fell in 2013 in both the
EU and the euro area, driven by declines in six of
the seven largest Member States (all except
France). Given the need for continued
consolidation in the EU, only relatively small
increases that likely will be too small to offset the
decline in 2013, are expected. Among the largest
Member States, Germany, Poland and the UK are
expected to record increases in 2015 and 2016,
whereas steadily falling public fixed investment is
projected in France and Italy. Reflecting
developments during the forecast years, a further
overall fall is expected for the euro area as a
whole. This suggests limited support of public
infrastructure investment for the transition to
stronger growth. (22) In that regard, Commission
plans (23) for additional infrastructure investment at
the EU level would, if implemented, provide for an
additional boost for total investment growth.
...without reaching historical investment ratios.

Overall, after declining for two years, total gross
fixed capital formation in the euro area should
expand over the forecast horizon by 0.6% in 2014,
1.7% in 2015 and 3.9% in 2016 in the euro area,
and, over the same period, by 2.0%, 2.9% and

According to IMF estimates, public investment shocks
have statistically significant and long-lasting effects on
output in advanced economies; see A. Abiad et al., Is it
time for an infrastructure push? The macroeconomic
effects of public investment, in: IMF World Economic
Outlook â October 2014, chapter 3.
This includes the Juncker plan for raising investment (pp.
3-4); See J.-C. Juncker, A New Start for Europe: My
Agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic
Change, Political Guidelines for the next European
Commission, Strasbourg, 15 July 2014.

4.5% in the EU. Although significant, the expected
expansion starts from a very low base and will
likely prove insufficient to bring investment-toGDP ratios in the EU and the euro area back to the
pre-crisis level, which had been blown up by the
construction boom.
Private consumption, so far the only durable
contributor to economic growth...

As the largest component of GDP in the EU,
private consumption is a crucial determinant of the
vigour and sustainability of the economic
recovery. Private consumption increased slightly in
the first two quarters of 2014, thanks to increases
in real disposable incomes and despite the negative
impact of ongoing deleveraging, in some countries.
Consecutive quarterly increases since spring last
year have made private consumption the only GDP
component that has continuously made positive
contributions to economic growth throughout the
current recovery (see Graph I.24).
Until mid-2014, one of the key elements
supporting the recovery in private consumption
was the increase in consumer confidence.
However, the near-term outlook for private
consumption has become increasingly clouded by
the deterioration of consumer confidence, which in
September had fallen for four consecutive months
(although it remained above its long-term average
in the EU and the euro area). This mainly reflects a
deteriorated assessment of the general economic
situation expected for the next 12 months, which
might be linked to increased geopolitical tensions,
and increased unemployment fears, whereas
intentions for households' major purchases have
remained relatively stable in recent months.
Meanwhile, the Commission's retail trade
confidence indicator has fallen in the EU and the
euro area over the last four and three months,
respectively, with the sharpest drop this year
observed in September. The Retail PMI has also
fallen sharply recently, signalling a contraction of
retail sales.
Looking at the hard indicators available for the
third quarter, private consumption should continue
growing at a moderate pace. In the three months to
August compared to the March to May period, the
volume of retail trade increased 0.6 % in both the
EU and the euro area (in the second quarter of
2014, 0.6% q-o-q in the EU and 0.3% in the euro
area). Euro-area passenger car registrations
continued to post increases in the three months to

September (up 4.1% from the corresponding three
months in 2013), indicating that households'
spending continued growing in the third quarter.

Empirical studies on the impact of low or negative
inflation rates do not suggest that consumers will
delay spending; some studies even find higher
consumption, as consumers do not simply
extrapolate price declines. Supportive evidence is
also found in a comparison of developments in
households' intentions to conduct major purchases
and in consumer price inflation (see Graph I.25).
Finally, further deleveraging needs in some
Member States notwithstanding, households' net
worth is expected to improve as debt gradually
reduces and house prices rise. (25)

Further out, consumer spending is expected to
increase gradually, closely in line with households'
disposable incomes. Real disposable incomes are
set to resume expanding in 2014 and maintain a
steady momentum over 2015-16. Nominal income
is expected to be underpinned by modest
employment gains and nominal wage growth as
well as a rising contribution from other personal
income (profit-and property related income) and
less fiscal pressure. Moreover, the moderate
improvements in the labour-market situation are
expected not only to increase the number of wage
earners, but also to lower income uncertainty,
which affects consumersâ decisions about buying
durables like cars and furniture (and also real
estate properties).

The wealth effect of asset prices and the rebound in house

EA and EU outlook

household debt in some economies, such as Spain,
Portugal and the Netherlands, will prompt
continued deleveraging in the household sector,
further limiting the pace of spending growth.
Among the largest Member States, household
consumption is expected to continue growing
strongly in the UK and Poland and to rise
subsequently above pre-crisis growth rates in
Germany. In Spain, the Netherlands and Italy,
household spending should no longer shrink, but
households are expected to remain cautious and to
continue increasing their savings during 2015-16
(on average) in line with still important
deleveraging needs.
Public consumption expected to grow slower
than GDP

Government consumption expanded strongly in the
first two quarters of 2014, clearly exceeding GDP
growth. In the EU, the growth rate fell from 0.5%
q-o-q in the first quarter (0.7% in the euro area) to
0.4% in the second quarter (0.2% in the euro area).
As important consolidation needs remain in some
large Member States this year, aggregate public
consumption is expected to grow 0.6% in the euro
area and 0.8% in the EU, less than GDP in both
areas. In thirteen Member States lower growth
rates are expected than last year.

the euro area and 1.3% (from 1.9%) in the EU as
compared to the second half of 2013. This reflects
the evolution of foreign demand including the soft
patch in global trade, but partly also a lagged
impact of the earlier appreciation of the euro. In
parallel, import growth slowed to 1.4% (from
2.3%) in the euro area and 1.2% (from 2.4%) in
the EU, because of the weakness of investment and
other domestic demand components.
In the second half of the year, recent indicators
signal a further, but modest, expansion of exports.
The assessment of export order books in the
Commission's manufacturing survey remained in
the third quarter in the EU and in the euro area
above its long-term average. Moreover, the July
data for world trade developments indicated a
rebound in merchandise exports of the euro area
(Graph I.26). Similarly, the PMI component for
new export orders in the manufacturing sector
remained above the expansionary threshold but
declined
recently.
Ongoing
geopolitical
uncertainties could have played a role in the recent
deterioration in the assessment of order books.

In 2015 and 2016, public consumption is expected
to continue increasing modestly. Next year, the
number of Member States with shrinking public
consumption is expected to increase from seven
(six in the euro area) to eight (seven), while ten
(seven) Member States are expected to see higher
growth than this year. In 2016, under the no-policy
change assumption, public consumption should fall
only in three economics (Greece, Spain, Cyprus),
but, at the aggregate level, make the largest
contribution to GDP growth since the recession in
2008-09 (see also Section 8). However, the
forecast for the acceleration in public consumption
in 2016 is based on a no-policy-change
assumption, according to which fiscal measures
are only factored in if they have been adopted by
national parliaments or are known in sufficient
detail.

Tensions with Russia over the conflict in Ukraine
have led to the imposition of financial and trade
sanctions by the EU, the US and Japan and to
countermeasures by Russia. The direct trade
impact differs across Member States, but is limited
for the EU as a whole. However, the uncertainties
generated by the tensions appear to have had an
impact on business and consumer confidence, and
dampened domestic demand in 2014. It is assumed
in this forecast that sanctions with limited duration
will expire in 2015, and that the impact of the
tensions will gradually ease thereafter.
The recent depreciation of the euro tends to
increase price competitiveness of euro area firms

27

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

and should gradually also support exports.
However, the increasing integration of EU
Member States in international supply chains and,
more generally, the increased import intensity of
exports limit the impact of exchange rate changes
on trade flows, in particular in Member States with
a high degree of openness.(26) Moreover, the
observed increase in the estimated foreign valueadded in extra-EU exports (from 16Â½% in 2000 to
about 21% in 2011) can be expected to imply a
lower employment impact for a given trade
volume and an unchanged domestic value-added in
extra-EU imports (6.0% in 2000, 5.7% in 2011).(27)
In 2014 as a whole, exports are set to grow 3.1% in
the euro area and 2.9% in the EU. The short-term
prospects for EU imports mirror modest growth in
domestic demand and exports. With increasing
growth momentum and stronger domestic demand,
import volumes are set to grow in 2014 by about
3% in the EU and the euro area
â¦and to accelerate as world trade growth
gains traction.

Further ahead, EU exports are projected to gain
more momentum, reflecting the gradually
strengthening of external demand and some
favourable impact from the recent fall in the
external value of the euro. Moreover, past
favourable cost-competitiveness developments in a
number of countries should continue to support
their export performances. Nevertheless, EU and
euro area companies are expected to lose export
market shares in 2015 and 2016. Among the
largest economies the loss of market shares is most
pronounced in Italy and the UK, whereas Spain
and Germany are expected to gain market shares in
each of the forecast years. Forecasts of export
performance mainly reflect developments in
competitive positions, but they also depend on the
composition (e.g. exports of intermediates within
global value chains) and the destination of trade,
which may have shifted on the back of the

See for instance the study for Belgium by Amiti, Itskhoki

observed lower trade intensity of global growth
(see Section 2).
Overall, with global output accelerating in 2015
and 2016, exports are expected to grow 3.9% and
5.0% in both the EU and the euro area. Import
volumes are expected to accelerate to 3.9% in
2015 and 5.5% in 2016 in the euro area, and in the
EU to 4.0% and 5.3% respectively.
The contribution of net exports to GDP growth has
been relatively small and volatile over recent
quarters. With export and import volumes growing
almost at the same speed over the forecast horizon,
net exports should contribute only marginally to
GDP growth over the forecast horizon.

5.

THE CURRENT ACCOUNT

Current
account
balances
have
moved
asymmetrically in the last years. While large
current account surpluses have in some countries
persisted, some vulnerable Member States have
made progress in external rebalancing. Over the
last three years they have seen their current
account deficits shrink or even turn to surplus. As
the impact of this adjustment has not been offset
by adjustment in creditor economies, the currentaccount surpluses of the EU and the euro area
reached new highs last year. Although part of the
recent gains are likely to reverse once the recovery
of domestic demand gains more traction, current
account surpluses are expected to remain roughly
stable over the forecast horizon.
The widening of the current-account surplus in
2013...

Current account surpluses have been the norm in
EU and the euro area since the end of the Great
Recession. Last year, the surplus-to-GDP ratio
increased to new highs in both areas, however, this
was more the result of weak domestic demand,
which resulted in lower imports and investment,
rather than strong exports or saving. Vulnerable
countries accounted for most of the increase in the
surplus, with both export growth (e.g. via cost and
non-cost competitiveness gains) and the import
side (through a structural stagnation in demand)
working in the same direction. (28)
(28)

See also Box I.3 ("The cyclical component of currentaccount balances") in: European Economic Forecast â
Winter 2014 ("Recovery gaining ground"), February 2014,

EA and EU outlook

In the euro area, net debtor countries have
particularly improved their current account
balances since 2007, e.g. in Cyprus, Greece,
Slovenia, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. The
comparison of developments in overall current
balances (see also Table 50 in the Statistical
Annex) and cyclically-adjusted current account
balances allows distinguishing structural and
cyclical components of these improvements (see
Table I.4). In Greece and Slovenia, more than half
of the reduction in the current account balance
between 2007 and 2013 is estimated to be
attributable to cyclical factors. By contrast,
according to estimates the bulk of rebalancing in
the other vulnerable countries was associated with
improvements in the cyclically-adjusted balances
and can therefore be considered as non-cyclical,
and be expected to be more durable.
At the same time, little adjustment has been
observed in creditor countries with persistent
surpluses, e.g. in the Netherlands and Germany.
Germany's current account surplus has even
increased in cyclically-adjusted terms since 2007.
During the global financial crisis and/or thereafter
also countries outside the euro area that had high
deficits before, recorded improved current-account
balances, mainly on account of improvements in
trade balances (e.g. Bulgaria, Romania, the three
Baltic economies). (29)

In 2014, the recovery appears to coincide with a
slight deterioration in the current account balances
of some of the vulnerable countries. Current
accounts balances are expected to worsen in Spain
and Greece. In the case of Spain, the deterioration
is partly due to improving business cycle
conditions leading to a strong rise in imports of
goods, while exports decelerated somewhat.

current account balances is expected to be
temporary. Overall, export growth in the
vulnerable countries is expected to lead the
improvement in cyclically-adjusted current
account balances. By contrast, current account

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

Overall, the current-account balance of the EU and
the euro area is forecast to be almost 1Â½% and
2Â½% of GDP respectively in 2014. This represents
a slowdown in the strengthening of the surplus
compared to the past two years. The current
account balance is then expected to remain broadly
stable in 2015 and 2016 in the EU and in the euro
area.

LABOUR MARKET CONDITIONS

Typically, after recessions, labour market
improvements follow the rebound of economic
activity after some time, which implies that the
outlook for employment in the EU should be
moderately positive. However, the strength of
economic growth is expected to remain insufficient
for a marked improvement. Thus, the number of
unemployed is not expected to decline
substantially over the forecast horizon.
Labour market conditions are strengtheningâ¦

The labour market recovery in the EU is
progressing, but it remains subdued and the
situation is very different across Member States. In
recent quarters, labour market conditions in the EU
and euro area have improved modestly in line with
the weak economic recovery.

half of 2013, unemployment in the EU and euro
area fell by 0.8 pp in the EU and by 0.5 pp
respectively in the year to August, but the average
unemployment rate remains high compared to the
history of the series.
Youth unemployment remains at historically high
levels, although it has recently slightly declined.
The number of unemployed persons aged 15 to 24
as a percentage of the labour force of the same age
stood in August at 21.7% in the EU and 23.3% in
the euro area, clearly exceeding pre-crisis levels.
The number of young unemployed as a percentage
of the population of the same age has steadily
increased up to the end of last year and exceeds the
corresponding rates of other age groups (Graph
I.28). The aggregate indicators of youth
unemployment hide a lot of diversity across
countries.

In the second quarter, employment growth
continued at a slightly higher pace than in
preceding quarters (see Graph I.27). This lifted the
annual rate of employment growth to 0.4% in the
euro area and 0.7% in the EU. Meanwhile,
unemployment rates continued to follow the
moderate downward trend that they had started
after stabilising towards the last quarter of last
year. Compared to the peaks reached in the first

Another indication of poor labour-market
functioning is the continued rise in the rate of
long-term unemployment (Graph I.29). The
number of persons with unemployment duration of
more than 24 months has almost steadily increased
since the beginning of the crisis in 2008 and not
yet benefitted from the slight improvements that
are visible for other unemployment durations. This
increase in long-term unemployment risks
lowering matching efficiency in the period
ahead.(30)

The past decline in match efficiency is visible in
the observed outward shift of the euro area's
Beveridge curve (which shows the negative
relationship between the unemployment rate and
the vacancy rate), which reveals that there are
more unemployed workers for a given level of
vacancies (see Graph I.30). However, the shift also
indicates that the number of laid off workers
declined more than one would have expected
based on its pre-crisis co-movements with the
unemployment-to-vacancy ratio. The outward shift
of the euro-area Beveridge curve masks inward
shifts in some Member States such as Germany.(31)
To some extent the lower match efficiency can be
explained by sectoral adjustment processes, which
had been triggered by the Great Recession and that
implies that idle workers are seeking employment

EU

Remarkably, in both the EU and the euro area, the
unemployment rate reduction began already in the
second quarter of the recovery that started in 2013,
whereas in the 2009-11 recovery the decline
started only in the fifth quarter. This response was
relatively quick in comparison to the lagged
responses observed in previous recoveries.
Usually, working hours of underutilised employees
are increased during the early phases of a recovery,
followed by recruitments and increases in the
headcount. But unemployment rates were (still)
relatively high at the beginning of the recession of
2011-13 and, with the exception of stressed
countries, employment did not fall markedly any
further. In particular downward adjustment of
hours might have been so small that in the current
recovery less time elapsed between the return of
economic growth and headcount adjustment.
(32)

Similar arguments have been shown to hold for the US
economy; see A. Åahin et al., Mismatch unemployment,
American Economic Review, November 2014, Vol. 104,
No. 11, pp. 3529-64.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

â¦with timid near-term improvementsâ¦

In the near term, survey data suggest a stabilisation
in labour market conditions. After having been on
a strong upward trend since the second quarter of
2013, employment expectations in all sectors
(industry, services and construction) have fallen
since spring (Graph I.31). In the EU, hiring
intentions currently stand above their long-term
average in all sectors covered by the surveys,
while in the euro area they remain below the longterm average in the services and construction
sectors. As regards consumers' unemployment
fears, they have been steadily increasing since May
in both the EU and euro area. Both households and
businesses seem to have become less optimistic
since spring, possibly as a result of the sluggish
recovery and the still uncertain outlook.
Meanwhile, the employment component of the
euro-area PMI has fallen since April and dipping
below the no-change-threshold in July.

The current pace of economic activity does not
allow for a rapid and massive absorption of excess
capacities. The expected slowdown of output
growth in the second half of the year implies that
improvements in the labour market are likely to
remain limited. Moreover, inflation may be lower
than anticipated by companies when agreeing on
wage settlements, which could exert a negative
impact on their willingness to employ. Overall, in
2014, employment gains are expected to remain
modest at 0.7% in the EU and at 0.4% in the euro
area, while the unemployment rate is set to
decrease to 10.3% in the EU and to 11.6% in the
euro area (see Table I.5).

32

â¦but more sizeable improvements expected
in 2015-16â¦

The recovery of economic activity is expected to
have a more visible positive impact on
employment in 2015 and even more so in 2016.
Besides, reforms in the labour market and past
moderate wage increases will also support job
creation over the forecast horizon.(33) On the
negative side, the still low levels of hours worked
compared to the pre-crisis period, could act as a
drag on the employment outlook. In 2015,
employment is expected to grow 0.6% in the EU
and 0.5% in the euro area, before accelerating to
almost 1% in both areas in 2016. This uptick in
employment growth follows the narrowing of the
(negative) output gap in both areas and is thus
broadly compatible with Okunâs law, which
quantifies the relationship between changes in
output and the change in the unemployment rate.
The labour force is expected to grow moderately
over the forecast horizon, mirroring the entrance of
certain segments of the population in the labour
force as a result of the improved situation in the
labour market, as well as the impact of migration
flows. The activity rate is also expected to increase
slightly. Labour productivity (output per person
employed) is expected to increase gradually over
the forecast horizon, reflecting the economic
recovery and the lagged response of employment
to developments in activity. In 2016, it is set to
reach respectively 1.1% and 0.9% in the EU and
the euro area respectively.
The unemployment rate in the EU and the euro
area is expected to decline slowly over the forecast
horizon, to 9.5% and 10.8% respectively in 2016.
This remains, however, still above pre-crisis levels
by 1.3 pps. in the EU and by 2.2 pps. in the euro
area (compared to the period 2004-08). The overall
slow decline in unemployment rates reflects
cyclical factors such as the sluggishness of the
recovery, but also the persistence of high structural
unemployment. The latter is reflected in the rise of
the NAWRU (Non Accelerating Wage Rate of
Unemployment), which according to the
Commission staff estimates has been steadily
increasing since 2009 in both the EU and the euro
area. It is expected to continue rising in the euro
(33)

After a time lag, reforms in the labour market tend to be
followed by improved activity rates and lower
unemployment, see A. Turrini et al., A decade of labour
market reforms in the EU: Insights from the LABREF
database, European Economy, Economic Papers no. 522,
July 2014.

moderately than during the crisis period and to
stabilise in the EU.
â¦amid narrowing cross-country differences.

Labour market conditions and performances
continue to differ substantially across EU countries
but these divergences seem to have begun
narrowing this year. Unemployment rates in a
number of Member States worst affected by the
crises, such as Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece
were considerably below their cyclical peaks in
August. Unemployment in Ireland and Portugal
was down 3.1 pps., while in Spain and Greece,
unemployment was down 1.2 pps. and 1.1 pps.
respectively. The reduction has been more limited
in countries with the lower cyclical peaks such as
Austria -0.3 pp. or Germany -0.5 pp.. Thus,
unemployment in the euro area as a whole has
fallen mainly because of declines in the most
stressed countries. Looking ahead, labour market
differences are expected to continue narrowing
over the forecast horizon, although they will
nonetheless remain large. Unemployment rates are
expected to range from 4.8% in Germany to about
22% in Greece and Spain in 2016.

since May did not neutralise the stronger fall in
commodity prices over the summer. The remaining
slack in the economy and weak domestic demand
have kept underlying price pressures low, a fact
also reflected in the prices of services and nonenergy industrial goods.
Core inflation (all items excluding energy and
unprocessed food) was on a gradual decline from
2012 up to the third quarter of 2014, but with only
marginal changes in 2014 in both the EU (Graph
I.32) and the euro area. The low level of core
inflation basically reflects historically low services
inflation due to weak demand and contained wage
pressures but also steadily declining non-energy
industrial goods inflation, which can be attributed
to low input prices and declining import prices. In
the third quarter of 2014, core inflation stood at
1.0% in the EU and 0.8% in the euro area, with
services inflation at 1.4% and 1.2% and inflation
of non-energy industrial goods close to zero in
both regions.

INFLATION DEVELOPMENTS

The trend towards lower inflation across EU
Member States has continued in autumn, guided by
lower commodity prices and remaining economic
slack. The outlook of a gradual pick-up in HICP
inflation rests on a gradual narrowing of the output
gap and a gradually easing of the dampening
influence of external factors.
A confluence of factors is keeping inflation
very low...

The EU economyâs disinflationary slide has
continued in 2014. HICP inflation continued to fall
in the first three quarters to 0.5% in the EU and
0.4% in the euro area. The persistence of low
inflation in Europe can be explained by a mix of
global factors and the weak economic
environment. The decline in global commodity
prices, especially energy and food prices had a
significant impact in driving headline inflation
lower. The impact of lower commodity prices was
magnified by the appreciation of the euro against
the US dollar earlier this year. The depreciation

Disaggregated HICP data show that the decline in
food prices has increased in 2014 with food price
inflation standing at -0.9% in the EU and -0.8% in
the euro area in the third quarter. However, there is
no clear evidence that the decline is mainly caused
as a result of the Russian import ban on imports of
food products from the EU. The Member States hit
most directly by the ban are those with the highest
weights of the products concerned in their HICP
basket. A potential decrease in food prices is
therefore likely to vary across countries and
depends on the extent to which food exports can be
diverted, although diverting them to other Member
States would only matter for the regional
distribution of the impact on HICP inflation.

have reflected lower energy and non-energy
commodity prices but also weak demand, which is
also the reason for the relatively low rate of
capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector. In
August, the annual rate of producer price inflation
stood at -1.5% in the EU and -1.4% in the euro
area, as prices for energy and intermediate goods
are falling, while prices of durable consumer goods
are increasing by around 1%, hinting at recovering
prices in the final stages of the production chain.

...including low external and producer price
pressures...

Lower global commodity prices together with the
appreciation of the euro drove external price
pressures substantially down in 2013. Import
prices (measured by the deflator of imports of
goods) fell 1.7% in the EU and 2.0% in the euro
area in 2013, but the decline of the euro and its
assumed path will neutralise to an extent the
impact of lower global commodity prices in 2014.
Import prices are expected to fall in 2014 as a
whole but to increase by more than Â¾% in 2015
and 1Â¼% in 2016, consistent with the assumption
of a lower external value of the euro.

producer level. Falling producer prices in 2014

forecast

Euro area

The slack in the labour market, as mainly seen in
high unemployment, and, in some Member States,
the need to regain competitiveness weaken wage
pressures and the spending power of consumers,
and thus do not encourage prices to rise. Growth in
compensation per employee slowed in the EU to
1.9% and in the euro area to 1.8% in 2013. In
2014, the growth rate is expected to fall to 1.7% in
the EU, and to 1.5% in the euro area thereby still
exceeding labour productivity growth of 0.6% and
0.4% respectively. As a result, unit labour costs
should increase 1.1% in both regions and thus less
than in the two previous years. Unit labour costs
are expected to moderate slightly in 2015 and 2016
as higher wage increases are neutralised by higher
labour productivity growth (see Table I.6).
The period of low inflation is expected to
continue...

Expectations of future price developments play a
major role in the price-setting and wage-bargaining
behaviour of economic agents and thus are crucial
in explaining overall HICP inflation. Expectations
may be influenced by the current low readings of
headline inflation. Short- and medium-term
inflation expectations have continued to decline in
2014, signalling low but positive inflation
developments in the years ahead. Inflation-linked

EA and EU outlook

swap rates at the one-year-forward-one-year-ahead
horizon dropped below 1% in June and fell further
to around 0.7% in mid-October. At the three yearsforward-three-years-ahead horizon, in mid-October
they would imply an average inflation rate of 1.3%
(taken at face value). Consumers' inflation
expectations in both the EU and the euro area have
also continued to fall, reaching their lowest levels
in almost four years, indicating low inflation in the
short term. Long-term inflation expectations based
on inflation-linked swap rates (five-year-forward
five-year-ahead) fell to 1.8% in the first half of
October, increasing concerns about a possible deanchoring of inflation expectations.
As regards the near term, the recent declines in
survey indicators (retail sector's selling price
expectations, consumers' price expectations)
suggest low inflation rates for the rest of the year.
The remaining slack in the economy, the assumed
path of commodity prices, and also the delayed
pass-through of declines in previous months will
continue to dampen the inflation outlook for the
remainder of 2014. While the weak recovery
should limit price increases, the dampening
influence of external factors is expected to
gradually ease over the forecast horizon.
In 2015, the assumed lower external value of the
euro and, in 2016, a gradual increase in non-energy
commodity prices should result in higher external
price pressures with a pass-through to consumer
prices. However, due to the subdued pace of the
recovery in most Member States, a large amount of
slack is expected to remain and changes in the
relationship between economic slack and inflation,
for instance as a result of structural reforms in
labour or product markets, are expected to remain
rather limited.(34) The expected smooth upward
trend also reflects some kind of inflation
persistence related to less frequent price
adjustments by firms in a low-inflation
environment. Overall, this should result in a
moderate rise of inflation to 1.3% in the EU and
1.1% in the euro area in the final quarter of 2015
(see Graphs I.2 and I.34).

In 2016, the stronger economic activity should
result in higher wage growth feeding into higher
pipeline pressures and finally into consumer
prices. In particular it is also envisaged that
services inflation will contribute more to headline
inflation amid a more dynamic domestic
environment. Nonetheless, headline inflation is
projected to remain below 2% in both regions until
the end of 2016.

The HICP aggregate hides inflation differentials

inflation rates in the Member States are expected
to range from -1.4% in Bulgaria to 1.5% in
Austria, Romania and the UK. The overall decline
in inflation rates has already brought a narrowing
of the gap between the highest and lowest inflation
rates both in the EU (Graph I.35) and in the euro
area. This trend is expected to continue over the
forecast horizon.

should help restore international competitiveness
vis-Ã -vis trading partners especially for those
countries undergoing a deep economic adjustment.
Low inflation can support GDP growth by
increasing real disposable incomes, which can in
turn boost consumption. However, too prolonged a
period of low inflation also increases the real value
of both private and public debt and can raise real
interest rates. This makes deleveraging more
difficult and may eventually impact negatively on
investment and consumption especially in those
countries with high debt ratios. Finally, very low
inflation across the euro area could make the
necessary relative price adjustment within the
region more challenging for the vulnerable
Member States.

benefiting from the consolidation measures
undertaken by Member States, the EU headline
deficit will be brought within the Treaty reference
value of 3% of GDP for the first time since 2008.
Headline deficits are forecast to continue declining
over the next two years, supported by the expected
gradual strengthening of economic activity. In
2015, the headline deficit is thus projected to be
reduced to 2.7% in the EU and 2.4% in the euro
area. Under a no-policy-change assumption,
general government deficits are projected to
decline to 2.3% and 2.1% of GDP in the EU and
the euro area in 2016 (Graph I.36).

PUBLIC FINANCES IN THE EU

Headline deficits continue to fallâ¦

Public finances are expected to continue improving
over the forecast horizon, confirming the sizable
consolidation efforts made since 2010 in both the
EU and the euro area. The general government
deficit is projected to decrease further in 2014,
albeit at a more moderate pace than in 2013. The
headline deficits are set to decline by 0.2 pp. and
0.3 pp. in the EU and the euro area, to 3.0% and
2.6% of GDP respectively. (35) As a result,
(35)

The upward revision of the EU general government
headline deficit in 2014 from the spring forecast partly
reflects the revised impact of the pension reform in Poland
in 2014, stemming from the methodological transition from
ESA 95 to ESA 2010. Whereas under ESA 95, the transfers
of private pension funds' assets are treated as revenue, and
therefore are deficit-decreasing â yielding an impact of
9.2% of GDP in 2014, and 0.2% of GDP in 2015 â, under
ESA 2010 they are deficit-neutral. As a result in 2014, the
changeover from ESA 95 to ESA 2010 leads in this
particular case to a downward revision of 0.3% of GDP in

accumulation of financial assets and valuation and other residual effects.

â¦but structural deficits are projected to remain
broadly unchanged in 2014 and 2015.

Following the sizeable fiscal consolidation
measures undertaken by most Member States
between 2011 and 2013, the fiscal policy stance is
expected to be broadly neutral in 2014. The
structural deficit, i.e. the general government
deficit corrected for cyclical factors, one-offs and
other temporary measures, after having
significantly declined in both areas in 2013 (by
around 1 pp. of GDP) is set to remain broadly
stable in the current year and in 2015.

Total revenues

From revenue to expenditure-driven fiscal
consolidation

In the EU as whole, fiscal consolidation in 2014 is
forecast to be essentially driven by a reduction in
government expenditure, with the expenditure ratio
expected reaching 48.2% (Graph I.37). A milder
decrease in the expenditure-to-GDP ratio is
expected in the euro area (to 49.3%). (36)
For the euro area, projected improvement of the
general government deficit in 2014 is â as in
previous years â expected to come largely from
higher indirect tax revenues, which stem from the
expected acceleration of private consumption. As a
result the revenue-to-GDP ratio in 2014 is forecast
to increase slightly to 46.7%. By contrast, in the
EU, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to
decrease in 2014 for the first time since 2010,
reaching 45.2%.
(36)

It is worth noting that the transition from the ESA 95 to the
ESA 2010 methodology will impact on public finances
aggregates. This change is expected to lead overall to
downward shifts in both the revenue-to-GDP and the
expenditure-to-GDP ratios.

Total expenditure

In 2015, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to
slightly decrease further in the EU and to stabilise
in the euro area. While in both the EU and the euro
area revenue from net social contributions is set to
decrease, possibly linked to the implementation of
tax wedge reforms, in the euro area this is expected
to be compensated by a slight increase in revenue
from taxes on income and wealth. Only at the end
of the forecast horizon, is the ratio projected to
decrease in both areas. Regarding government
spending, the strengthening in economic activity is
likely to induce a reduction in expenditure related
to automatic stabilisers, alongside costcontainment in public wages and intermediate
consumption in both the EU and the euro area as of
2015.
Public debt ratio reaching a peak in 2015

The debt-to-GDP ratio is set to continue increasing
in 2014, albeit at a slower pace compared to the
previous years, reaching 88.1% and 94.5% in the
EU and the euro area respectively (see the Table

37

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

I.8). The combined debt-reducing effects of
nominal growth and the primary balance are
projected to be stronger than in previous years. But
they are expected to be more than compensated by
the impact of stock-flow adjustments and interest
payments. As a result, the general government
debt-to-GDP ratio is set to remain on an upward
path. In 2015, the debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to
peak at 88.3% and 94.8% in the EU and the euro
area respectively, as the debt-decreasing effects
from the expected continued increase in the
primary balance, combined with a strengthening of
economic growth, should be offset by interest
expenditure. In 2016, the debt-to-GDP ratio should
decline in both areas.

RISKS

The composition of risks to the growth outlook has
changed with geopolitical risks having become
more relevant, but downside risks continue to
outweigh upside risks. While some downside risks
to the inflation outlook appear to be more acute
than previously assessed, others have partly
materialised and entered the central scenario so
that overall the risks appear to remain balanced.
Risks to the growth outlook remain distinctly on
the downsideâ¦

â¢ Delayed or only partial implementation of
structural, fiscal and institutional reforms by
Member States or the EU level would be
detrimental for European growth and could
increase heterogeneity across Member States.
In particular, without further improvements in
the labour market or a rising threat of
unemployment, private consumption â the
largest component of GDP in the EU â may be
at a risk of stalling.
â¢ Concerns of a build-up of excessive leverage
and under-pricing of credit risk have been
highlighted
by
recent
financial-market
volatility. Widespread, abrupt and disorderly
corrections in financial markets, either in
response to the normalisation of monetary
policy in the US or increased global risk
aversion could reduce the outlook for global
growth and delay the healing of financial
frictions in the EU.
â¢ Economic growth could also be slowed by
financial market tensions following the asset
quality review and stress tests, or renewed
concerns about the debt sustainability of a
Member State.

Developments in the EU economy remain
shadowed by major risks. Since spring, risks
surrounding the growth outlook have shifted in
nature. External risks have come to the fore, even
more than already expected in spring.

â¢ Lower-than-expected inflation could have
potentially serious knock-on implications on
economic activity by making deleveraging
more difficult and harming investment and
private consumption.

Downside risks relate to the external environment,
financial markets, and progress with reforms in the
EU economy.

Moreover, over the medium term, against a
background of already weak economic momentum,
any further materialisation of downside risks could
push the EU economy onto a lower trajectory of
trend growth.

â¢ The geo-political environment has worsened
this year, although the effects appear contained
so far. A new cycle of sanctions and countersanctions between the EU, the US and others
and Russia could pose a larger roadblock to
European growth prospects than currently
envisaged in the forecast, including a more
negative impact on domestic demand via
deteriorating confidence in the EU. Sanctions
could also remain effective for longer than
currently assumed. Stronger negative effects on
EU growth could also emerge from further
intensified conflicts in the MENA region

38

(including Iraq and Syria) and/or their impact
on oil prices.

Upside risks to the growth outlook feature less
prominently than downside risks. They include
positive shocks to EU exports originating from a
stronger-than-expected acceleration of global
output and/or global trade (e.g. due to a higherthan-assumed trade intensity of global growth) or a
stronger-than-assumed depreciation of EU
currencies (including the euro), a faster-thanexpected revival of investment expansion, for
instance in response to recent measures of
monetary accommodation, stronger-than-expected
improvements in access to credit in the wake of the

EA and EU outlook

ECB's comprehensive assessment of the largest
EU banks, and a quicker-than-expected recovery in
labour markets that supports disposable incomes
and thereby domestic demand, for instance in
response to successful structural reforms.
Sentiment and growth could also rebound strongly
if the conflict in Ukraine eases.
Overall, risks to the growth outlook remains tilted
to the downside. This is visualised in the fan chart
(Graph I.38) that depicts the probabilities
associated with various outcomes for euro-area
economic growth over the forecast horizon. While
the darkest area indicates the most likely
development, the shaded areas represent the
different probabilities of future economic growth
within the growth ranges given on the y-axis.
Since the balance of risks to economic growth is
assessed as clearly tilted to the downside, the fan
chart remains skewed towards the bottom.
Graph I.38: Euro area GDP forecasts Uncertainty linked to the balance of risks
%

scenario, whereas other risks have become more
acute than previously assessed, mostly on account
of the past decline in HICP inflation.
Downside risks relate to the sluggishness of
economic activity in the EU, global factors, and
implications of the past disinflationary trend.
Weaker-than-expected domestic demand remains a
major downside risk to the inflation outlook.
Weaker-than-forecast global growth could prolong
the period of falling energy and commodity prices,
which would reduce import prices. Downside risks
are associated with a de-anchoring of inflation
expectations that could trigger additional
deflationary pressures, including the risk that
disinflationary expectations take hold. These risks,
if materialising, would result in lower inflation
rates than included in the central scenario.
The possibility of periods of lower-than-expected
inflation has to be separated from the scenario of
outright deflation. The risk of a long period of very
low inflation remains in place, but the
materialisation of outright deflation is rather
unlikely.

2

On the upside, a faster-than-expected recovery, or
substantially higher oil prices, for instance
originating from a stronger-than-expected rebound
of global growth or continued unrest or military
actions in oil-exporting countries, could push
HICP inflation in the EU beyond the forecast
levels.

Risks to the inflation outlook have changed since

inflation expectations) and thus entered the central

Risks to the growth and inflation outlook remain
closely linked to each other. Lower economic
growth would reduce inflation pressure, while
lower inflation would have the potential of making
deleveraging more difficult, which could weigh on
investment and consumption decisions and thereby
negatively on the growth and inflation outlook.

Prospects by individual economy

Member States

1. BELGIUM
Headwinds to recovery
Both the performance and the outlook of the Belgian economy have deteriorated in recent months. GDP
growth is now forecast to remain below 1% in 2014 and 2015, with slightly higher growth in 2016. The
main constraints to the outlook relate to domestic demand, in particular private and public
consumption. Belgiumâs fiscal deficit is forecast at around 2.8% of GDP in both 2015 and 2016.
The pick-up in economic activity that started in the
second half of last year, has stalled since spring.
The weak growth seen in Q2-2014 is projected to
have continued, with leading indicators such as
industrial production providing scant evidence of
more dynamic performance in the short-term.
Annual growth is expected to arrive at 0.9% in
both 2014 and 2015. At 1.1%, economic growth
would be faintly higher in 2016.
Household consumption to lose ground given
modest income growth

Spending by Belgian households is set to grow by
1.2% in 2014. However, consumer spending is not
expected to maintain this growth pace in coming
years. The tightening of the fiscal stance entails a
series of small measures that dampen the outlook
for consumer spending in 2015. Income growth of
around 1% in 2014-16 reflects, on the one hand,
low inflation and, on the other hand, government
measures to restrain nominal wage growth in order
to regain cost competitiveness. Labour market
dynamics are expected to improve only slowly
over the forecast horizon amid subdued economic
activity. The unemployment rate is projected to fall
from a ten-year peak of 8.5% in 2014 to 8.2% in
2016 as job creation in the private sector is largely
absorbed by substantial reductions in public
employment and the increase in the labour force.
Investment held back by
external demand pressures

domestic

and

The robust projection for investment growth in
2014 (+3.6%) is greatly influenced by large oneoff purchases. While capacity utilisation has been
approaching its historic average and financing
conditions are favourable, the softening of domestic demand and the deteriorated export outlook are
set to hold back new equipment investment in the
near term. As a consequence, 2015 should see
more modest growth, also because the improvement in construction activity is slow-moving.
In the second half of this year, the economic
slowdown in the euro area and in particular among

58

major trading partners is anticipated to dampen
external demand, while hesitant domestic activity
restrains import growth. Exports, however, should
accelerate as foreign demand strengthens over the
forecast horizon. All in all, the contribution to
overall activity from net trade is forecast to remain
positive in 2014-15 and turn neutral in 2016.
Weak inflation reflects low import prices and
transitory tax effects

Headline inflation has been on a downward
trajectory, falling back to 0.4% in Q3-2014.
Negative price developments for energy and, more
recently, unprocessed food items, are the fundamental drivers of this trend. As such, low inflation
is mostly imported and core inflation remains well
above 1%. The recent reduction of VAT on
household electricity bills, adds to downward price
dynamics for energy carriers, though this effect
will fade over the course of 2015. At 0.9% in 2015
and 1.3% in 2016, inflation is projected to remain
moderate, in line with passive economic activity
and stagnant wage growth.

Flat outlook for government balance

The outlook for the 2014 general government
deficit worsened substantially since the spring
forecast, from 2.6% of GDP to 3.0%. Statistical
reclassifications have had a negative impact of
around 0.3 pp., while tax revenues have suffered
from the economic slowdown. On the other hand,

Member States, Belgium

one-off measures, such as a tax amnesty, had a
positive impact of 0.4 pp. As a result, the structural
balance is projected to be broadly stable in 2014.

fees (-0.1 pp. of GDP), and dynamic upward trends
in social spending (+0.3 pp. of GDP), in particular
pension expenditure. The cyclical impact on the
deficit remains broadly unchanged between 2014
and 2015, while the structural balance improves by
almost Â½% of GDP.

In 2015, the headline deficit is expected to
improve by 0.2 pp. of GDP. This projection
includes almost 1% of GDP of new measures
announced
by
the
federal
and
the
regional/community governments, mostly of a
structural nature. Main measures include cuts in
the wage bill and administrative expenditure of the
federal and sub-federal governments, a lower
growth norm for health care expenditure, tighter
criteria for social benefits and a postponement of
the previously announced reduction in social
security contributions, which is offset by an
increase in income tax deductions for workers.
Lastly, the temporary suspension of wage
indexation, both in the public as well as the private
sector, has a slightly positive budgetary impact,
with savings on the wage bill and social benefits
more than offsetting the impact on tax revenues.
Furthermore, the decline in interest rates
contributes to the improvement by around 0.2 pp.
of GDP. On the other hand, the government
balance is negatively impacted by the evolution of
one-off revenues (-0.2 pp. of GDP), a decline in

In 2016, under the usual no-policy-change
assumption, the headline deficit remains stable at
2.8% of GDP. The structural balance is not
projected to improve further, despite the additional
positive impact of sufficiently specified new
measures of around 0.2% of GDP.
General government debt has been substantially
revised upwards since the spring 2014 forecast,
mainly due to the reclassification of a number of
corporations into the government sector.
Furthermore, the debt ratio is forecast to rise from
104.5% of GDP at the end of 2013 to almost 106%
of GDP at the end of this year. Over the forecast
horizon, the projected low nominal GDP growth is
insufficient to offset the impact of further deficit
accumulation and stock-flow adjustments on the
debt ratio. As a consequence, it is expected to rise
further to over 107% of GDP.

2. BULGARIA
Subdued growth amid rising uncertainty
Real GDP growth is expected to remain muted, falling from 1.2% in 2014 to 0.6% in 2015 and 1% in
2016 as domestic demand weakens. After a deflationary period in 2014, inflation is set to only slowly
pick up to 1% by 2016. Following a sizeable fiscal deterioration in 2014, the general government deficit
is projected to remain above 3% of GDP over the forecast horizon.
Headwinds slowing growth

Downside risks have materialised since the spring
forecast. A less dynamic external environment is
weighing on exports. In June, confidence in the
domestic segment of the banking sector received a
setback, when a bank run led to the fourth largest
bank closing leaving no access to deposits for at
least five months. Irregularities in banking
practices have also surfaced. This forecast assumes
an orderly unfolding of the banking situation, with
domestic banks considerably tightening credit
standards, thereby depressing investment by firms.
Survey indicators already indicate a significant
deceleration of activity over the rest of 2014,
leading to an average GDP growth rate of 1.2% for
the year as a whole. These headwinds are expected
to continue, resulting in real GDP growth of 0.6%
in 2015 and 1% in 2016.
Consumption and investment outlook subdued

Private consumption was supported in the first half
of 2014 by the sharp increase in householdsâ real
disposable income driven by high dynamics of
public sector wages and pensions as well as
deflation. Recent monthly consumer confidence
and retail data, however, suggest that private
consumption will lose momentum by 2015.
Similarly, gross fixed capital formation is mainly
driven by buoyant government investment
spending on the back of accelerated absorption of
EU funds in 2014. However, as the current
programming period is coming to an end, EU
funded investment is set to decline significantly in
the coming years. In turn, private investment is
seen to contract further in 2014-15, mirroring the
on-going deleveraging process in the economy and
low profit expectations amid increased uncertainty.
Overall, investment is projected to decline in both
2015 and 2016.
Export growth to resumeâ¦

Despite a slowdown in the first half of 2014,
exports are set to resume growing at a moderate
pace in 2015-16, sustained by the mild recovery in

60

both the EU and non-EU trade partners. On the
back of a further slowdown in domestic demand,
the contribution of net trade to overall economic
growth is projected to turn positive in 2015, while
the current-account surplus is seen stable at about
2% of GDP by 2016.
â¦but labour market to remain frail.

Manufacturing and construction continued to shed
labour, but the overall labour market outcome in
2014 is supported by temporary employment in the
volatile agricultural sector. Slow economic growth
is set to result in small declines in employment
over 2014-15, followed by only modest gains in
2016. Nevertheless, combined with a continued
decline in the labour force due to negative
demographic trends, this brings the unemployment
rate from a peak of 13% in 2013 to 11% by 2016.

Downside risks prevail

Risks still appear tilted to the downside. On the
domestic
front,
accelerating
confidence
deterioration in the banking sector and a more
protracted period of disruptions to credit
intermediation alongside tighter credit conditions
pose considerable risks. A more prolonged
weakness of business and consumer confidence
together with the still fragile labour market could
lead to a reduction of domestic demand further
eroding confidence in the economy. On the

external front, the countryâs dependence on
Russian gas imports could become a further
burden to growth should supplies be disrupted.

2014. This is significantly more than planned in
the original 2014 budget. This projection includes
the 2014 budget update proposal of the care-taker
government made in September, which also
reveals a significant expenditure increase. Also,
VAT, excises and some non-tax revenues have
underperformed over 2014. Under a no-policychange assumption, the general government deficit
is set to weaken further to 3.7% of GDP in 2015
and to 3.8% in 2016, in line with the projected
sluggish evolution in tax bases. The current
projection does not include assumptions about
measures in the upcoming 2015 budget. In
structural terms, the deficit is estimated to
deteriorate by over 2 pps. of GDP in 2014 and to
stay broadly flat in 2015-16. The general
government gross debt is forecast to increase
rapidly from 18.3% of GDP in 2013 to about 25%
in 2014, reflecting not only the financing of the
current yearâs fiscal deficit, but also the roll-over
of a large bond maturing in January 2015 and the
existing liquidity scheme for the stabilisation of
the financial sector. The forecast does not include
any potential further debt issuances to support the
financial sector. The debt ratio is forecast to
amount to slightly above 30% of GDP in 2016.

Strong deflation in 2014, turning to low inflation

Bulgaria has been experiencing deflation since
mid-2013, and prices this year are expected to
decline by an average -1.4%. This has been caused
by a coincidence of falling global energy prices,
significant administrative cuts to electricity and
healthcare prices, and declining food prices due to
a good harvest. Also, core inflation has turned
strongly negative, reflecting overall weak domestic
demand. Some of these deflationary factors are
temporary in nature and their base effects will fade
over the second half of 2014. Moreover, the
Bulgarian government has decided to increase
electricity prices by 10% as of October 2014 and
tobacco excise will be hiked in 2015. Aggregate
HICP is forecast to pick up only modestly in 2015
to 0.4% and 1% in 2016.
Significant budgetary weakening in 2014, with
no improvement in 2015-16

3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC
The recovery is strengthening and broadening
Recent data suggest that the economic recovery in the Czech Republic is strengthening and broadening
and growth is expected to pick up further next year. Investment and household consumption have been
the most important sources of growth this year and domestic demand is projected to remain the main
driver going forward. Net exports are also expected to contribute positively. The general government
deficit is projected to remain below 3% of GDP.
Unemployment has been falling in recent months
and is projected to reach 6.2% next year.

Strengthening broad-based recovery

Following several quarters of contraction, the
Czech economy started to recover during the
second half of 2013. The recovery strengthened
during the first half of this year, with all
components of GDP (excluding inventories)
contributing positively. Recent soft indicators and
high-frequency data suggest that this broad-based
recovery will continue in the third quarter, despite
a slowdown in the countryâs main trading partners
and geopolitical tensions. Domestic demand has
rebounded strongly in recent quarters and is
expected to be the key driver of growth over the
forecast horizon. Overall, real GDP is forecast to
grow by 2.5% in 2014 and to strengthen slightly to
2.7% in both 2015 and 2016.

Surge in investment activity

Investment has recovered since mid-2013
following generally weak readings since the onset
of the financial crisis. The rebound of private
investment has been driven by the improved
domestic environment, a pickup in foreign
industrial orders, and an improvement in
construction activity. Public investment has also
contributed positively, with the government
increasing its use of available EU funds. Overall,
gross fixed capital formation is expected to grow
by 4.3% in 2014 and moderate somewhat over the
forecast horizon, with EU-backed public
investment falling off in 2016.
Net exports make a positive contribution

Household consumption rebounds

After declining in 2012, household consumption
started to recover in 2013 and continued expanding
during the first half of 2014. Growth is expected to
reach 1.7% in 2014. The main driver has been a
strong rebound in real disposable income, which
declined in 2013. Growth of household
consumption is expected to strengthen further in
2015 and 2016, reflecting an improvement in the
labour market as well as an easing of the tax
burden.

62

While the recovery in real GDP growth in 2014 is
expected to be primarily driven by domestic
demand, net exports also contribute positively.
Strong growth in new orders from abroad, aided by
last yearâs intervention by the Czech National
Bank to weaken the koruna, has helped support
export growth over the course of the year and is
projected to surpass 8%. The impact on net exports
has been muted due to a strengthening of import
growth, driven by improved domestic demand. Net
exports are expected to make a positive
contribution to real GDP growth over the forecast
horizon, although a slowdown in main trading
partners would pose a downside risk due to the
high degree of openness of the economy.
Inflation expected to increase

The HICP inflation rate is expected to remain low
throughout 2014, despite the maintenance of an
exchange rate floor by the Czech National Bank
and an extension of this policy to 2016. Low
inflation this year is partly explained by a fall in
regulated energy prices at the start of 2014. The
impact of regulated prices and taxes is expected to
be broadly neutral in 2015 and headline inflation
should begin to rise due to increased domestic
demand, rising nominal wages and the impact of

Member States, The Czech Republic

the weaker exchange rate. Inflation is projected to
be close to the central bankâs target of 2% in 2016.
Fiscal loosening in 2014 and 2015

The general government balance improved
significantly to -1.3% of GDP in 2013 on the back
of continued consolidation efforts. The structural
balance turned positive for the first time in more
than a decade.
A slight deterioration of the general government
deficit to 1.4% of GDP in 2014 is driven mainly by
increasing government consumption and a rebound
in public investment after several years of negative
growth. Public consumption is expected to be
boosted by a relatively strong increase in
healthcare expenditure while public investment
activity is set to be supported by higher absorption
of EU funds. On the revenue side, indirect tax
receipts will be positively affected mainly by a
hike in excise duties on tobacco. The one-off sale
of licences to mobile operators increased
government revenues by 0.2% of GDP. Overall,
the structural balance is projected to deteriorate by
0.9 pp. to -0.7% of GDP in the context of a
narrowing output gap.

The forecast for 2015 implies loosening of fiscal
policy, based on information from the draft budget.
The general government deficit is expected to
increase to 2.1% of GDP with the structural
balance deteriorating by 1 pp. to -1.7% of GDP.
Growth in government consumption should
strengthen further on the back of the planned
increase in public sector wages by 3.5% and an
additional increase in healthcare expenditure.
Other envisaged discretionary measures included
in the forecast are also mostly deficit-increasing
and include the introduction of a second reduced
VAT rate of 10% for selected products, higher
indexation of pensions and higher tax credits for
families with children and for working pensioners.
The forecast also includes military expenditure
related to the lease of fighter jets amounting to
0.2% of GDP.
The fiscal stance is expected to turn broadly
neutral in 2016, based on a no-policy-change
assumption. The projected fall in the headline
general government deficit to 1.7% of GDP is
mainly due to improved economic environment.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to stabilise at
around 45% by 2016.

Uneven recovery expected to strengthen
Indicators are pointing to continued, albeit fragile and moderate, growth in the Danish economy.
Unemployment has been steadily declining since the end of 2012, while the housing market has
generally seen rising prices since late 2011. Together with an improvement in confidence and income
growth, the conditions are, therefore, in place for a pick-up in private consumption, after a standstill in
recent years. GDP is expected to grow by 0.8% in 2014, 1.7% in 2015, and 2.0% in 2016, while the
general government deficit is projected to remain below 3% of GDP.
Recovery expected to take hold

GDP fell by 0.1% in 2013, as a result of weak
domestic demand growth and a negative
contribution from net exports. In the first half of
2014, GDP has increased by 0.9% compared to the
corresponding period one year before.
In recent years, GDP growth has been negatively
influenced by a trend decline in North Sea oil and
gas production, which has reduced annual GDP
growth by close to half a percentage point. This
drag is unrelated to the current business cycle
conditions and has a limited impact on the broader
economy, for example due to the sectorâs low
share of total employment. When correcting for
this downward pressure on GDP growth, a picture
of a somewhat stronger recovery emerges. Based
on the latest official projections, production in the
North Sea is expected to decrease at a significantly
slower pace from 2014 and the drag on GDP
growth is, therefore, expected to abate.
The economic conditions are in place for a pick-up
in domestic demand, as household disposable
income is supported by low interest rates, wage
growth and improved labour market conditions.
The conditions in the housing market have
improved, but the recovery still appears to be
fragile, with large regional differences and a low
level of sales. House prices have generally
increased over the last two years, adding support to
householdsâ balance sheets and confidence.
GDP growth is forecast to increase from 0.8% in
2014 to 1.7% in 2015 and 2.0% in 2016.
Compared to the spring forecast, GDP growth has
been revised downwards both in 2014 and 2015.
For 2014 this partly reflects the revision of the
national accounts and the implementation of
ESA2010, which has had an impact on historical
data and on the carry-over to the current year, but
also due to lower than expected growth in the
beginning of this year. Also, the weakness of
external demand foreseen in the second half of

64

2014, in particular due to the slow recovery of the
EU economy, has contributed to the revision for
2014 and 2015.
While domestic demand is expected to be the sole
driver of growth in 2014, a small positive
contribution from net exports is expected in 2015
and 2016.

The labour market has performed well in
recent years

The labour market has performed better than
expected during the weak recovery of the Danish
economy. This can partly be explained by the
mentioned before drag on the economy from the
decline in production of oil and gas, which is
camouflaging a somewhat stronger recovery in the
private sector economy.
Unemployment has been edging downwards since
spring 2012, falling from 7.9% in May 2012 to
6.7% in August 2014. This trend is expected to
continue, with the average annual unemployment
rate projected to reach 6.4% in 2016. Employment
is expected to increase by 0.7% in 2014, 0.5% in
2015 and 0.9% in 2016, reflecting the pick-up in
economic activity.

Member States, Denmark

2015) and now pension assets in the so-called LD
pension fund are also subject to favourable
taxation in 2015. These measures are expected to
boost the fiscal balance by Â¾% of GDP.

Risks are broadly balanced

The risks to the macroeconomic outlook remain
broadly balanced. As a small and open economy,
Denmark is highly dependent on developments
abroad, in particular in its neighbouring countries,
such as Germany and Sweden. In addition, there
are positive risks related to a possible release of
pent-up demand in private consumption and in
business investments.

In 2016, when the economic recovery is
anticipated to have broadened, the general
government deficit is forecast to decrease to 2.0%
of GDP. The estimate for 2016 is based on a nopolicy-change assumption.
The structural balance is expected to deteriorate
from a surplus of 0.2% of GDP in 2013 to a deficit
of 1.2% of GDP in 2015. The structural balance
has been revised downward significantly in 2015
compared to the spring forecast, mainly due to a
revised estimate of the output gap, implying that
the assessed negative impact on the headline
deficit from the economyâs cyclical position is
lower than in the spring forecast.

Stable fiscal outlook

Overall, Denmarkâs fiscal outlook is expected to
remain stable. After reaching 0.7% of GDP in
2013, the general government deficit is expected to
be at 1% in 2014, again supported by revenues
from a one-off measure related to capital pension
taxation.
Compared to 2014, the budget deficit is expected
to deteriorate somewhat in 2015, and attain 2.3%
of GDP. However, the estimated deficit in 2015
has improved compared to the spring forecast as
the capital pension measure, mentioned above, has
recently been extended by one year (to the end of

The general government gross debt level is
expected to remain stable and close to 45% of
GDP over the forecast horizon.

5. GERMANY
Disappointing growth but improvement in sight
Germany's economy is expected to broadly stagnate over the second half of this year but economic
growth is set to resume gradually with the support of a robust labour market, favourable financing
conditions, and improving external demand. A recovery in corporate investment has been interrupted
and is expected to resume only hesitantly. The general government budget is forecast to remain broadly
balanced and the gross debt-to-GDP ratio to decrease.
Weak activity to be followed by gradually
improving growth

Real GDP declined by 0.2% (q-o-q, seasonally and
working-day adjusted) in the second quarter of
2014, after a strong rise of 0.7% in the previous
quarter. The decline reflects some correction after
the weather-related boost in construction in winter,
a contraction of private equipment investment, and
weak international trade. Domestic demand was
the main contributor to growth in the first two
quarters, while net external trade was a drag.
Economic activity may remain weak until the first
half of 2015. For Q3-2014, stagnation is expected
as positive signs from the service sectors, notably
from employment, retail sales and surveys, are
being largely offset by adverse signals from
production. The continued decline in industry
orders and the strong worsening of firms' business
expectations suggest further weakness. Real GDP
is projected to grow by a moderate 1.3% in 2014.
On the back of a robust labour market, favourable
financing conditions and an improving external
environment, growth is forecast to gradually regain
momentum over the course of 2015. GDP is
expected to increase by 1.1% in 2015 and by 1.8%
in 2016, helped by more working days.
Robust labour market and consumption

Firms and employees are likely to use the scope of
working time arrangements to mitigate the impact
of weak activity on employment. The new general
minimum wage should have a positive impact on
labour income despite some negative employment
effects. Solid private consumption growth is also
supported by low interest rates, high net migration
and accelerated real wage growth on the back of
low inflation. This can also be seen in householdsâ
high income expectations and propensity to buy.
Investment upswing interrupted

Private equipment investment declined in the
second quarter this year, interrupting a recovery

66

that had started in 2013. Geopolitical tensions and
concerns about economic developments in
important trading partners may have triggered a
wait-and-see attitude among firms. The subdued
near-term outlook for investment is underpinned
by declining domestic capital goods orders and a
marked negative output gap. However, as domestic
and external demand pick up, geopolitical and
other external uncertainty decreases and
favourable financing conditions hold, corporate
investment should resume its recovery in 2015,
reflecting in particular pent up replacement
investment and investment in new product lines.
Housing investment is projected to moderate its
rapid pace of expansion.

Export growth curbed by external environment

Export growth is expected to remain moderate.
Firms' export expectations have deteriorated and
small and medium-sized industrial orders from
abroad have continued their quarterly decline. But
export growth should rise in the medium-term, in
line with increasing demand growth in trading
partners. As investment picks up and private
consumption grows, higher demand for imports
will turn the impact of net exports on GDP growth
negative and lead to a limited narrowing of the
current account surplus.

Member States, Germany

Moderately rising inflation

Declining commodity prices will continue to limit
consumer price pressure in 2015, even though
rising labour costs should support core inflation.
Still, price pressures are expected to remain limited
given the sizable output gap. Overall, consumer
prices are forecast to rise by 0.9% in 2014, 1.2% in
2015 and by 1.6% in 2016.
Balanced budgets and a broadly neutral fiscal
stance

A general government budget surplus of 0.2% of
GDP is projected for 2014 after a positive balance
of 0.1% in 2013. Tax revenue growth should
accelerate somewhat as economic growth recovers,
despite a further increase in the minimum income
tax allowance in 2014. In 2015, a rise in the longterm care contribution rate of 0.3 pp. will be
largely offset by lower pension and health
insurance contribution rates.

infrastructure, urban development, research, and
international aid will contribute to a somewhat
higher expenditure growth.
Overall, based on the measures included in the
draft budgetary plan for 2015 and a no-policychange assumption for 2016, the general
government budget is forecast to remain broadly
balanced over the forecast horizon, resulting in a
decreasing gross debt-to-GDP ratio. The on-going
winding up of âbad banksâ could further reduce the
debt stock. The structural balance is projected to
remain broadly unchanged.

Recovery slowed by rising uncertainties
Real GDP growth is expected to stabilise at around 2% in 2014 and 2015, affected by regional tensions,
but to reach 2.7% in 2016 as external demand gradually recovers. Unemployment in Estonia continues
to decline, as does the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is forecast to fall below 10%.
External factors dampen outlook for 2014 and
2015â¦

As geopolitical uncertainties continue and external
demand remains weak, GDP growth will be
limited to 1.9% and 2.0% in 2014 and 2015
respectively, but is expected to reach 2.7% in 2016
as the global outlook improves. In the first half of
2014 real GDP growth slowed to 1.4% from 1.6%
in 2013. Domestic demand remained the main
growth driver, while export growth almost stalled.
Private consumption was led by strong wage
income growth, higher pensions and decelerating
consumer price inflation. Investment activity was
supported by large public transport equipment
purchases in Q1 and strong housing investment,
which benefitted from marked construction price
adjustment. Due to weak export performance,
corporate investments are focused mostly on
increasing efficiency.

Household borrowing is projected to increase only
moderately despite very low interest rates, as
banks will remain cautious about the private
sectorâs relatively high level of indebtedness.
Trade surplus continues shrinking

Net exports contributed negatively to growth in the
first half of 2014 reflecting persistently weak
demand in Estoniaâs main trading partners. The
trend is expected to continue, with Estoniaâs trade
balance turning slightly negative in 2016 as
domestic demand, especially investment, gathers
pace.
Downside risks to the forecast could stem from a
further escalation of the Ukrainian crisis affecting
both trade flows with neighbouring Russia and
inflows of direct investment.
30

â¦as investment activity remains weakâ¦

20

Corporate investment is expected to suffer from
remaining excess capacity and uncertainties related
to the export outlook in 2014 and 2015, but the
impact of these factors is expected to fade out in
2016 and equipment investment to accelerate to
8%. Housing investment is projected to pick up in
coming quarters as suppressed real estate
developments start recovering. Public investment
is expected to gradually pick up only in 2015, after
disbursements under the EUâs development fund
programmes resume.

10

â¦while wage growth still behind vigorous
consumption.

Consumption growth is forecast to remain
vigorous, supported by strong real income growth,
helped by income tax cuts and rising family
benefits in 2015. After decreasing in 2014 along
with output growth, nominal wage growth is
expected to remain around 6% in 2016. Real wage
growth is forecast to remain around 4%, due to the
recovery in external demand from mid-2015, a
10% increase in the minimum wage in 2015, and
unemployment hovering around its natural rate.

Unemployment further declinesâ¦

Labour supply constraints are increasing, as
Estoniaâs working age population, particularly in
its 19-35 age category, contracts due to very low
birth rates and high emigration. This trend is
expected to reduce the unemployment rate to 6.3%
in 2016 down from 8.6% in 2013 and to exert
upwards pressure on wages. Labour force
participation remains high at close to 70%, and is
not expected to change over the forecast horizon.

In 2015, the deficit is projected to widen to 0.6%
of GDP as a result of deficit-increasing measures
included in the draft budget. The public wage bill
is expected to grow by more than 5%. Additional
social transfers are directed to households, as child
benefits are roughly set to double and pensions are
planned to increase by 5.9%. Moreover, across-the
board tax relief for labour and capital enter into
force in January 2015. These measures are
expected to be partially compensated by additional
dividend distribution from state-owned enterprises,
further increases in indirect taxes and by cutting
expenditure on non-priority areas, e.g. roads.
Assuming no change in policy, the government
deficit is forecast to remain broadly unchanged in
2016.

â¦while inflation takes a pause.

HICP inflation fell to 0.9% in the first half of
2014, as global mineral and oil prices markedly
declined and trade sanctions related to the crisis in
Ukraine pulled domestic food prices downwards.
At the same time, warm weather and easier access
to cheaper regional energy networks lowered
electricity prices. The projected decline in global
commodity prices next year will be partly offset by
a depreciating exchange rate against the US dollar.
Moreover, further excise tax and administrative
price increases and persistently high, although
moderating, wage growth, are set to push inflation
back to around 1.6% in 2015 and 2.2% in 2016.
A widening budget deficit

In structural terms, the fiscal position is forecast to
improve by 0.4 pp. of GDP in 2014 and by another
0.1 pp. of GDP in 2015. In 2016, on a no-policychange assumption, it is expected to remain
broadly unchanged. The debt-to-GDP ratio is
expected to fall to 9.9% in 2014 and to remain
below 10% thereafter, as nominal deficits of the
central government should be financed from
accumulated financial assets.

The general government balance is forecast to
show a small deficit of 0.4% of GDP in 2014,
benefitting from solid growth in the consumption
and labour tax bases. Moreover, tax revenue
collection has been positively affected by the
closure of tax fraud schemes which more than
offsets the postponement of the VAT enhancing
measures by a couple of months to end-2014.

7. IRELAND
Ireland decouples as growth picks up sharply
Ireland is decoupling from the euro area, as its recovery broadens and gathers firm momentum. This
robust and faster-than-expected expansion should bolster government revenues and facilitate a
reduction of the deficit.
Broad momentum is now well established

National accounts data for the second quarter of
2014 took observers by surprise, displaying
significant momentum across the board. Real GDP
was up 5.8 % y-o-y in the first half, with the
turning point for the Irish economy likely having
occurred in the latter part of 2013. The recovery is
being fuelled by strong goods exports, some of
which likely resulted from temporary factors
(export activities with a deferred impact on the
import side) that will not be sustained.

Imports should also rise with domestic demand
and the current account surplus is expected to
stabilise at around 5.5 % of GDP.

The latest national accounts data and high
frequency indicators suggest that domestic demand
is also gathering steam. Business and consumer
confidence increased in 2014. Retail sales are on a
firm upward trend and private consumption growth
(year-on-year) turned positive for the first time
since 2012 in the first quarter of 2014. Although
starting from a very low base, gross fixed capital
formation grew a sharp 11.3 % y-o-y in the first
half of 2014, a clear sign of emerging business
confidence, including among SMEs.
Employment growth has persisted in 2014, with
the fall in the standardised unemployment rate
continuing apace from a peak of 15.1 % in
February 2012 to 11.1 % in September 2014.
Decoupling is set to continue

The business cycle is decoupling from that of the
euro-area, with Ireland benefiting from its strong
trade links with the more dynamic UK and US
markets. Net exports and the recovery in domestic
demand are likely to fuel real GDP growth of
4.6 % in 2014. Sustained growth is set to continue
in 2015 and 2016 at around 3.6 %, with some
stimulus provided by tax cuts and expenditure
increasing measures in 2015.
The unemployment rate should fall further but
remain above 8 % over the forecast horizon,
putting a lid on wage demands. Inflation is
expected to increase moderately, deviating little
from euro area levels. This should preserve recent
competitiveness gains and support export growth.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Employment and wage growth should facilitate the
household deleveraging process and foster private
consumption growth, but high levels of
indebtedness are likely to make the recovery of
household spending gradual. In turn, gross fixed
capital formation is expected to grow strongly after
years of historically low levels of investment,
including in construction, where supply now lags
well below demand. Although gross credit to
SMEs remains subdued, there is survey-based
evidence that access to finance is improving, with
new government initiatives being established.
The risks to the forecast are balanced. On the
upside, the construction sector could provide
additional momentum if supply constraints are
swiftly resolved, and the drag of deleveraging
might ease faster than expected if consumer
confidence remains high and the savings rate eases
from its recent historic highs. On the downside,
low growth in the euro area is the main risk to the
medium-term sustainability of the recovery and
decoupling may generate policy challenges.
Buoyant tax revenues help deficit reduction

In 2014, the general government deficit is forecast
at 3.7 % of GDP, down from 5.7 % of GDP in

Member States, Ireland

2013, a significant improvement compared with
the Commission services' 2014 spring forecast of
4.8 % of GDP. The expected improvement reflects
a combination of factors, notably the strongerthan-expected recovery, some windfall revenues
beyond the growth surprise and expenditure
restraint.

The improved position for 2014 is also expected to
boost the outlook in 2015 and beyond. In spite of
various tax cuts and expenditure increases in the
2015 budget of around 0.5 % of GDP, the general
government deficit is expected to improve further
to 2.9 % of GDP next year on foot of the projected
economic recovery coupled with a broadly stable
level of total government expenditure. Under a nopolicy-change assumption, the deficit is forecast at
3.0 % of GDP in 2016. Risks around this
projection mainly relate to the sustainability of
recent macroeconomic developments. The
structural deficit is forecast to decrease to 3.3 % of
GDP in 2015 from 3.8 % of GDP in 2014 and is
projected to remain stable in 2016.

Tax revenues increased by 7.4 % y-o-y in the first
three quarters of 2014 and are expected to exceed
the governmentâs yearly target by 0.6 % of GDP.
Personal income tax and VAT have been more
buoyant than suggested by the improved macroeconomic outlook. Temporary effects (0.3% of
GDP) known already at the time of the
Commission servicesâ 2014 spring forecast, such
as increased dividends and higher Central Bank
income also contributed to the deficit outlook. In
addition, since the last forecast, interest
expenditure declined due to the favourable market
environment by close to 0.2% of GDP, and
primary expenditures have been in line with targets
except in the health care sector, where overruns are
once again significant (around 0.2 % of GDP).
Finally, the transition to ESA 2010, including a
higher GDP level, is estimated to improve the
2014 budget balance by around 0.5 % of GDP.

Gross public debt is projected to fall to 106 % of
GDP in 2016, down from 123.3 % in 2013. This
marked improvement largely reflects the
accounting treatment of gross debt related to the
Irish Banking Resolution Corporation (IBRC).
With the transition from ESA 95 to ESA 2010,
IBRC became part of general government.
However, the liquidation of IBRC initiated in early
2013 is projected to reverse the effect of its
inclusion in the general government perimeter on
the debt level.

8. GREECE
The economy finally rebounds
After six years of recession, 2014 is expected to be the turning point for Greece. The countryâs longawaited recovery is driven by private consumption and net exports. Its magnitude also depends on the
effects that policy uncertainty may have on investment. (37)
Returning to growth

The Greek economy is expected to return to
growth in 2014. Following a weaker than expected
first half, GDP growth in seasonally-adjusted
terms became positive in the second quarter this
year, and a strong third quarter figure is expected.
After strengthening throughout 2014, the
Economic Sentiment Indicator and the Purchasing
Managersâ Index began to weaken towards the end
of the summer. The persistently tight credit
conditions and slow absorption of EU and EIB
funds continue to be a significant constraint on the
recovery of investment. However, private
consumption is expected to rebound fast and
exports to continue performing strongly owing to
the tourism and shipping sectors. Greeceâs
economy is projected to grow by 0.6% in real
terms this year.
The recovery is projected to gain strength next
year. However, uncertainty over policy
implementation looks set to continue weighing on
investment decisions in the first half of 2015.
Private consumption growth is supported by low
inflation expectations, increases in disposable
income and the use of precautionary savings held
outside the banking system during the crisis.
Exports are projected to surge in 2015, supported
by the euroâs depreciation and gains in
competitiveness and quality of the business
environment. As a result, real GDP is forecast to
pick up markedly to 2.9% in 2015.
In 2016, real GDP is projected to continue
expanding by 3.7%, as investment gains
momentum and the economy begins to reap the
benefits of ongoing structural reforms.
Greeceâs current-account deficit is projected to
reach 2.8% of GDP in 2014 and then improve to
(37)

72

Note that updated forecasts will be released in the
forthcoming Compliance Report on the 2nd Economic
Adjustment Programme of Greece. These will be based on
quarterly ESA 2010 for Greece which will be available for
the first time in the course of November 2014.

2.5% in 2015 and 2.2% in 2016, as exports pick up
with the recovery and benefit from reforms.
Unemployment is expected to drop to 26.8% in
2014 reflecting the creation of new jobs and the
effect of employment support programmes. A
relatively strong fall in unemployment to 25.0% in
2015 and 22.0% in 2016 can be expected thanks to
the pick-up in investment, the continuation of
employment programmes, and ongoing structural
reforms bearing fruit.
Consumer prices are expected to fall moderately
by 1.0% in 2014, reflecting falling unit labour
costs and the implementation of product market
reforms, notably to remove distortions and
increase competition in the retail, health and
energy sectors. As the economic recovery gains
pace, prices are expected to increase by 0.3% in
2015 and 1.1% in 2016.

Uncertainty a major risk

Greeceâs GDP growth could turn out weaker than
forecast if uncertainty on policy implementation
has a stronger-than-projected effect on confidence
and investment, or if geopolitical events have a
bigger-than-expected impact in the region. On the
upside, exports may exceed expectations and
investorsâ confidence could pick up owing, in
particular to the successful processing of nonperforming loans and to the positive results of the

Member States, Greece

Asset Quality Review and stress tests. Overall, the
balance of risks points to the downside since
uncertainty is significant for the next few months.
The budgetary situation is improving

The general government headline balance
deteriorated to 12.2% of GDP in 2013, from 8.6%
of GDP in 2012 mainly because of the temporary
costs of bank recapitalisations which amounted to
10.4% of GDP in 2013 and 2.9% in 2012.
However, the underlying fiscal situation improved
significantly last year.
In 2014, the headline deficit is projected to fall to
1.6% of GDP, given the one-off nature of banking
support costs in 2013 and continued budgetary
improvements such as a major income tax reform
and expenditure consolidation. This forecast
assumes that, as in recent years, the government
exerts close controls on spending towards the end
of the year to ensure that its 1.5% of GDP primary
surplus target for 2014 is met.
The projections for 2015 and 2016 assume that
Greece will meet the 3.0% and 4.5% of GDP
primary surplus targets of its programme as a
result of the fiscal-structural reforms under
Greeceâs programme and the improved economic

environment. Accordingly, Greece would record a
headline general government surplus of 1.3% of
GDP in 2016. The fiscal adjustment and the
structural reforms during the past years have
improved significantly the Greece structural fiscal
balance and turned it into a sizeable surplus.

The governmentâs debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
stabilise this year, before declining markedly in
2015 and beyond, as the primary surplus continues
to improve and economic growth continues. Minor
bank recapitalisation needs following the stress
tests are expected to result in lower borrowing
from the EFSF reducing the debt ratio accordingly.

GDP and employment growth expected to firm
After a temporary slowdown in the second half of 2014, GDP growth is projected to increase in 2015
and 2016, supported in particular by rising employment and easier financing conditions. With domestic
demand becoming the main driver of growth, the external surplus is expected to narrow significantly in
2014 relative to 2013 and then to expand slightly in 2015 and 2016. Unit labour cost growth is expected
to turn moderately positive, still allowing a further recovery in international competitiveness.
Unemployment is expected to continue declining. Spainâs general government deficit is set to narrow in
2014 and 2015.
The economic recovery in Spain gained steam over
the first half of 2014. Although a modest
deceleration is expected for the second half of the
year, the recovery is foreseen to regain momentum
thereafter amidst improved confidence, a loosening
of financing conditions and better labour market
prospects. The correction of the external
imbalance, however, is likely to slow down and
high private and public debt levels imply that
deleveraging pressures will continue to weigh on
growth.
Domestic demand drives growth

GDP expanded by 0.6% q-o-q in the second
quarter of 2014, after 0.4% in the first quarter.
Economic activity is expected to decelerate
somewhat during the second half of the year,
leading to an average GDP growth rate of 1.2% for
2014 as a whole. Growth is set to come mainly
from domestic demand but the external sector
should turn neutral, after having been a drag in the
first two quarters. Net exports are seen
contributing only slightly to growth in 2015 and
2016. The GDP growth rate is projected at 1.7 %
in 2015 and 2.2 % in 2016, under a no-policychange assumption.

account surplus is thus forecast to shrink to 0.5%
of GDP in 2014 and to improve slightly thereafter.
Net external lending is expected to fall in 2014 to
1.0% of GDP, before rising to 1.5% of GDP by
2016.

Activity and confidence indicators suggest that
private consumption is set to decelerate in the
second half of 2014. It is however forecast to
accelerate progressively thereafter, backed by
positive employment growth and growing real
gross disposable income, the latter also helped by
very low or even negative inflation in the very
short term. The household's saving rate, by
contrast, is projected to decline due to lower
precautionary savings and households' leverage
ratios are set to fall further as GDP and disposable
income expand.
Overall positive demand prospects, easing
financing conditions and the projected rebound in
exports are expected to underpin investment in

Inflation is projected to remain negative in the near
term, with average inflation over 2014 of -0.1%. In
2015 and 2016 inflation is expected to turn
positive again but to remain very moderate as the
output gap will still be negative and energy prices
are projected to fall.

Employment on the rise

Having peaked at 26.9% in the first quarter of
2013, the unemployment rate has since declined to
24.5% in the second quarter of 2014. Employment
creation accelerated in the first half of 2014, while
the labour force continued to contract. These
positive trends in employment are expected to
intensify over the forecast horizon, helped by
continued wage moderation and only modest
increases in nominal unit labour costs. With the
labour force contraction expected to fade
progressively, unemployment is forecast to fall to
22.2% in 2016.
Downside risks to the growth forecast are not
negligible. They are mainly related to the external
sector, should in particular the recovery in the euro
area be slower than expected.

as a whole is expected to narrow to around 5.6% of
GDP, down from 6.3% of GDP in 2013, net of
bank recapitalisations in both years.
In 2015, an improvement in the economic outlook
and ongoing savings resulting from previously
enacted reforms are expected to more than offset
the announced tax cuts and some relaxation of the
public sector's hiring policy. Taking the 2015
budget into account, the government deficit is
expected to fall to around 4.6% of GDP.
While interest and pension expenditures are
forecast to continue rising, falling unemployment
and the application of a new pension indexation
formula should keep the growth of social transfers
in check over the forecast horizon. The headline
deficit is expected to narrow further to 3.9% of
GDP in 2016, based on a no-policy-change
assumption.

Recovery to aid ongoing deficit reductions

Recent data indicates that fiscal consolidation is
continuing in 2014, with the general government
deficit in the first half of the year reaching 3.4% of
GDP, 0.3 pp. lower than last year (net of bank
recapitalisations). All in all, the deficit for the year

Spain's structural deficit should remain basically
flat at 2â% of GDP until 2015, before widening to
2Â¾% in 2016. Still sizable budget deficits and low
nominal GDP growth are expected to push the
public debt ratio above 100% in 2015 and to
102.1% in 2016.

10. FRANCE
Weak growth, low inflation and a rising deficit
France's economic growth is forecast to remain low in 2014 and 2015 as a result of restrained domestic
demand and a still subdued export performance, and to accelerate from 2016 as domestic demand gains
momentum. Despite significant expenditure cuts, Franceâs general government deficit and its debt-toGDP ratio are expected to continue rising.
Growth set to remain weak

Franceâs economy stagnated during the first half of
2014, as investment fell, private consumption
remained flat and exports grew weakly. Economic
growth has been stagnating since mid-2011 and the
latest short-term indicators do not suggest that a
firm recovery is imminent. Investment is not
expected to gain momentum before 2016, while
international trade looks unlikely to provide a
boost to activity over the forecast horizon. Thus,
despite a slowdown in fiscal consolidation, only
moderate GDP growth of 0.7 % and 1.5 % in 2015
and 2016 is forecast, driven by an acceleration in
private consumption.

Little improvement in export performance

Although exports are projected to accelerate from
2015, reflecting the expected rebound in world
demand and some positive impact of the recent
euro depreciation, French firms are unlikely to
benefit fully from these opportunities. Indeed,
competitiveness-enhancing reforms undertaken so
far are expected to only reduce the pace of losses
in export market shares in the medium term, but
not reverse them. As a result, net trade is expected
to weigh on GDP growth in 2016, as the expected
pick-up in domestic demand causes imports to rise.
Weak labour market conditions, low inflation

16

Supportive consumers, reluctant entrepreneurs

Private consumption, the traditional growth driver
of the French economy, is expected to gradually
pick up over the forecast horizon, as real wages
grow, helped by a slight increase in employment,
low inflation and tax cuts for low income
households. However, as households are not
expected to dip significantly into their savings, the
contribution of private consumption to GDP
growth would remain limited.
Despite favourable credit conditions and the recent
clarification of the government's economic
strategy, business confidence will likely remain
weak due to low production expectations. The tax
credit for competitiveness and employment (CICE)
and additional cuts in social security contributions
planned under the Responsibility and Solidarity

76

Pact will improve firm's profit margins, but the
positive effect on investment will only materialise
with a lag, from 2016 onwards.

In spite of subdued growth, employment is
expected to increase slightly, supported in the near
term by subsidised job schemes, particularly in the
public sector. Over the whole forecast period, job
creation in the private sector should be
increasingly sustained by the enhanced flexibility
stemming from the 2013 labour market reform and
the labour cost reductions of the CICE and the
Responsibility and Solidarity Pact. However, these
improvements in the labour market will not be
sufficient to absorb the trend increase in the labour
force, so unemployment will remain high.
Falling energy prices and weak activity have offset
the impact on prices of the VAT reshuffling
introduced in January 2014. Inflation is only set to
rise marginally over the forecast horizon, reaching
1.1% in 2016 on the back of inflationary pressures
generated by the recent euro depreciation and a
gradual closure of the output gap.
Risks tilted to the downside

A further drop in economic confidence could
postpone the expected pick-up in private
consumption and in investment and act as a drag
on Franceâs already fragile recovery. On the other

Member States, France

hand, a more forceful implementation of structural
reforms could boost further activity.
Government deficit to continue rising

The general government deficit in 2013 stood at
4.1% of GDP, 0.2 pp. below the level notified in
spring. However, the headline deficit is expected
to increase to 4.4% of GDP in 2014, compared to
3.9% in the spring forecast, notably on the back of
downward revisions in nominal growth.
Current public revenue growth is expected to slow
to 1.8% this year, despite significant measures
including a reshuffling of VAT rates and a
doubling of the exceptional corporate income tax
paid by large companies. This is notably due to
low inflation, which is set to weigh on tax bases
and revenues. On the expenditure side, savings are
expected from the continuation of a public sector
wage freeze, the impact of pension reforms, and
lower expenditure at the local level in line with the
electoral cycle. These savings, however, are
outweighed by the expansion of the CICE, which
under ESA 2010 rules will cost the state
EUR 10.8 billion (0.5% of GDP). Excluding the
impact of tax credits, public expenditures are
expected to increase by only 1.4%.

The government balance is expected to continue
deteriorating in 2015 to 4.5% of GDP. This is
largely due to still modest GDP growth and to
discretionary measures, such as a further increase
in the cost of the CICE, measures to lower the cost
of labour, and reductions in the personal income
tax for low income households. The government
has announced that expenditure savings of
EUR 21 billion (1.0% of GDP) would be
implemented in 2015. However, some of these
measures, representing close to EUR 2 billion,
remain insufficiently specified to be incorporated
into the forecast. The additional package
complementing the draft budget for 2015,
announced late October, was also not included in
the forecast due to a lack of details on the
measures at the cut-off date.
Overall, the structural balance is expected to
improve in 2014, and to stabilise in 2015. Under a
no-policy-change assumption, the deficit in 2016 is
set to hit 4.7% of GDP as discretionary measures
for that year remain mostly unspecified.
The increase in the headline deficit and the low
nominal GDP growth are expected to lead to a
continuous increase in the government debt ratio to
99.8% of GDP in 2016.

11. CROATIA
Still mired in recession with significant fiscal challenges
After six years in recession, Croatia is expected to have only marginally positive growth in 2015, thanks
to a positive contribution of external demand, while a rebound in investment should spur growth in
2016. After almost zero inflation this year, prices should increase again in 2015 and 2016. Growth risks
remain predominantly negative as a result of uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the ongoing
structural reforms and the continuing need for fiscal consolidation and private sector deleveraging.
2014 is set to be Croatia's sixth consecutive
year of recession

In 2014 real GDP is forecast to contract by 0.7%,
and unemployment to rise from 17.3% to 17.7%.
Against a background of large accumulated
external and internal imbalances in a context of
weak business environment and labour market
performance, all components of internal demand
are set to detract from growth. External demand is
expected to make a positive contribution, on
account of a strong rebound in export of goods and
to a lesser extent services following EU accession.
However, the repatriation of earnings and the
payment of the contribution to the EU budget are
expected to keep the current account surplus at
only 0.3% of GDP. HICP inflation is set to fall
from 2.3% in 2013 to 0.2% in 2014, as a result of
weak internal demand and falling import prices.
A pick-up in growth is only forecast for 2016

Real GDP growth in 2015 is forecast to be just
above zero. The contraction in internal demand is
set to abate, while the positive contribution of
external demand is forecast to decrease. In 2016, a
rebound in investment is expected to push growth
more firmly into positive territory.
Compensation of employees (per head) is expected
to decelerate to about 1.5% in both 2015 and 2016.
The moderate rate of growth in compensation is
driven by continuing employment losses in 2015 (1%) and the fading effect of higher social security
contribution
introduced
in
early
2014.
Employment growth is forecast to return to
marginally positive in 2016. The unemployment
rate is set to stagnate in 2015 at 17.7% as a decline
in active population offsets lower employment,
and to decline slightly to 17.3% in 2016 as the
recovery becomes firmer.
Household consumption is set to contract further in
2015, reflecting the negative dynamics of
households' disposable income, before recovering
somewhat in 2016. Investment spending is also set

78

to detract from growth in 2015, although a few
delayed large-scale investment projects could start
being implemented already in the second half of
the year. Taking into account the necessary
phasing-in, the bulk of the positive impact of EU
structural and investments funds is expected to
show up only in 2016.
Croatiaâs external sector is set to be the only driver
of growth also in 2015. After the strong postaccession increase, exports of good are expected to
rise at a lower but still robust pace 4.3%, while
revenues from tourism are set to further rebound to
3.0%. The progressive improvement of the
external environment and the recovery of trade
links with older trading partners (following the
entry into force of bilateral trade agreements
between the EU and some CEFTA countries) are
expected to further boost the export of goods and
services in 2016. Despite a pick-up in imports, in
line with the dynamics of final demand, the
progressive turnaround in the balance of transfers
from and to the EU is set to consolidate the current
account surplus over the forecast horizon.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

HICP inflation is forecast to reach 0.6% in 2015,
on the back of higher import prices and increasing
service prices, and to reach slightly above 1% as
consumption picks up.

Member States, Croatia

Risks to these growth projections are tilted to the
downside due to domestic policy uncertainty,
notably related to the fiscal consolidation process
and delays in the ongoing structural reform
process.

half of 2014. In the absence of further measures,
the budget deficit is set to narrow marginally to
5.5% of GDP in 2015 and remain around the same
level in 2016, in spite of the forecast moderate pick
in growth. The structural deficit is expected to
reach some 3.9% of GDP in 2014, and to
deteriorate in 2015 and 2016.

Revenue
shortfalls
and
extraordinary
expenditures hamper budget deficit reduction

Croatiaâs debt profile has been strongly affected by
the inclusion under the new accounting rules of
two major state-owned enterprises, which have
increased the debt-to-GDP ratio in the period
2008-2013 on average by 7.8 pps. The general
government debt is expected to increase from
75.7% of GDP in 2013 to 81.7% of GDP in 2014,
mainly as result of the widening budget deficit and
also reflecting a pre-financing operation planned
before the end of the year. In 2015 and 2016 the
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase to 84.9%
and 89.0% of GDP as a result of the underlying
deficit trends.

At the cut-off date of this forecast, neither the
supplementary 2014 budget nor the draft 2015
budget had been adopted by the government.
Under
the
customary
no-policy-change
assumption, despite being announced in broad
terms by authorities, the 2015 reform in personal
income and deposit's interest taxation have not
been included in the forecast, due to the lack of
sufficient details on their implementation.
The general government deficit is forecast to stand
at 5.6% of GDP in 2014 (compared to 5.2% of
GDP in 2013), on the back of low VAT revenue
collection, partly explained by the weak dynamics
of the tax base. Expenditure appears to be evolving
mostly in line with the authorities' plans, but
additional
outlays
from
flood-related
reconstruction costs are materialising in the second

Negative fiscal risks are still present, including
from the accumulation of arrears in the health
sector and possible additional expenditure
slippages in some other sectors, such as education
or transport.

12. ITALY
Improving external demand to drive a tepid recovery
After a further contraction of economic output in 2014, accelerating external demand is expected to
drive a fragile recovery in 2015. Inflation is set to remain low but slightly positive in 2015 fuelled by
higher import prices. The government deficit is projected at 3% of GDP in 2014 and to decrease to
2.7% in 2015, with a broadly unchanged structural position over the two years.
Real GDP continues to contract in 2014 and
recovers only mildly afterwards

In the first half of 2014, real GDP continued to
decline on a yearly basis. As global trade lost
momentum, Italy's exports did not trigger the
anticipated recovery in equipment investment.
Moreover, constructions contracted further due to
persistently tight financing conditions. By contrast,
private consumption has been slowly recovering
since mid-2013, also thanks to a halt in labour
shedding. Still, the recent softening in confidence
suggests that economic activity remains weak in
the second half of the year. As a result, real GDP is
forecast to decline by 0.4% in 2014.

The completion of the ECB's comprehensive
assessment is expected to reduce uncertainty in
financial markets and help restart the flow of credit
to the economy in 2015. Still, the revival of both
supply and demand of corporate credit will
ultimately be driven by economic recovery
expectations. This forecast expects a mild recovery
to start in 2015 and strengthen in 2016, driven by
improving external demand and a lower exchange
rate. Higher exports are set to boost equipment
investment while construction is expected to
recover only at a later stage. Consumption is
expected to benefit from the income support
measures in the draft budget. As domestic demand
recovers, imports are forecast to rise but at a

80

slower pace than exports, letting the currentaccount surplus continue increasing.
Downside risks to the real GDP forecast are related
to further delays in the external demand revival. In
addition, higher real interest rates would increase
deleveraging pressures on the corporate and public
sectors, in turn weighing on investment. On the
positive side, growth prospects could benefit from
a successful implementation of the reform process.
Depressed activity is reflected in historically
high levels of unemployment and low inflation

A recovery in per capita hours worked is forecast
to precede the uptake in headcount employment,
given the recorded large decrease in hours worked
in recent years. The anticipated mild headcount
employment gains combined with slowly
increasing labour force participation result in
unemployment rates remaining at historically high
levels, with possible hysteresis effects. Labour cost
pressure is forecast to abate due to persistently
high
unemployment
and
low
inflation
expectations, but also thanks to the labour tax cuts
included in the draft budget. This, together with
some improvement in labour productivity, results
in decelerating unit labour costs. Yearly HICP
inflation turned negative in the third quarter of
2014 driven by declining energy prices but also
weak aggregate demand. Further low readings are
expected in the final months of the year as oil
prices continue falling. In 2015, higher import
prices and some recovery in consumption are
forecast to sustain the rise in prices. In 2016, the
no-policy change forecast incorporates the hike in
VAT rates that is enshrined in the draft budget law
to safeguard the achievement of the fiscal targets.
This measure may still be replaced by others of an
equivalent budgetary impact.
The government deficit at 3% of GDP in 2014

The government deficit is forecast to increase to
3% of GDP in 2014. A 0.1 pp. of GDP decline in
interest expenditure resulting from lower yields
only partially offsets the expected erosion of the

Member States, Italy

primary surplus. Primary expenditure is projected
to increase in nominal terms by 1% year-on-year,
also driven by support measures to low-wage
employees, while the recognition of sizeable tax
credits of banks related to past losses (Deferred
Tax Assets) weighs on capital expenditure.
Revenues are expected to increase marginally
relative to 2013, thanks to higher intakes from
VAT and property taxation that compensate for a
fall in corporate income taxes. In 2015, after
incorporating the draft budget and the additional
measures announced on 27 October, the deficit is
projected at 2.7% of GDP, again supported by
declining interest expenditure. In nominal terms,
primary expenditure is set to rise slightly. The
planned expenditure savings affect both capital and
current expenditure, but the latter is set to increase
mainly driven by the confirmation of the income
support measure and the extended coverage of
unemployment benefits, while public wages
remain frozen. Despite a further cut to the labour
tax wedge, tax revenues are set to increase mainly
due to a recovery in corporate income taxes and
higher withholding taxes on financial income. In
2016, under the no-policy change assumption, the
deficit is forecast to narrow to 2.2% of GDP. The
VAT hike is set to contribute to the expected rise
in the primary balance. The structural balance is

set to broadly stabilise in 2014 and 2015.

The 2013 debt-to-GDP ratio has been revised
downward by 4.7 pps., to 127.9%, due to the
switch to ESA2010. The expected primary surplus
is still insufficient to curb the growth of the debt
ratio in 2014, due to flat nominal growth and the
settlement of trade debt arrears. The debt ratio is
set to peak in 2015, despite privatisation proceeds
of 0.5% of GDP, and decline in 2016 thanks to the
higher nominal growth and primary surplus.

13. CYPRUS
Adjustment continues as the economy nears a trough
The recession in Cyprus has been milder than anticipated this year and a modest economic recovery is
expected to begin in 2015 and strengthen in 2016. Public finances are forecast to improve significantly,
as a result of the government's efforts and the improvement in the economy. Reflecting weak domestic
cost pressure, inflation will be close to zero in 2014, but should increase gradually.
Recession continued in the first half of 2014, but
milder than anticipatedâ¦

Economic activity continued to decline in the first
half of 2014, falling by 3.0% compared to the first
half of last year. Although significant, the
contraction has proved milder than anticipated in
the Spring forecast, as all demand components
exceeded expectations (except for public
consumption). That said, increasingly high
unemployment, wage cuts, and tight credit
conditions continued to weigh on domestic
demand. Import contraction decelerated in the first
half of 2014 (partly related to large import of
transport equipment) and net trade contributed
negatively to growth.
After a sharp decline at the beginning this year due
to subdued domestic cost pressures and falling
wages, HICP inflation returned to positive territory
in the second half of the year, mainly due to
increasing prices of goods and services consumed
by tourists. The labour market is showing signs of
stabilisation. Unemployment dropped below 16%
in the first half of 2014, although this is partly
because of a contraction of the labour force.

â¦leading to a modest recovery in 2015.

In 2015 and 2016, the economy is expected to
gradually regain momentum, mainly driven by net
export. Private consumption will remain subdued,
reflecting weak wage growth and deleveraging
from indebted borrowers. While the restoration of
a sound and well-capitalised banking sector should
gradually remove impediments to growth and
allow for a gradual easing of the tight credit
conditions, recovery is initially expected to remain
largely credit-less and led by less leveraged sectors
such as professional business services, and sectors
with more solid turnover, such as tourism.
Supported by improved competitiveness and a
gradual increase in global demand, export growth
is expected to be relatively strong and to become
the main driver of growth in 2015-2016. In line
with the expected recovery, unemployment should
gradually decline, while HICP inflation is forecast
to increase modestly.

â¦the contraction is expected to
moderate in the second half of 2014â¦

further

Modest improvement in business and consumer
confidence indicators and most available hard
indicators, such as tourist arrivals and retail sales,
suggest that the contraction in the second half of
2014 will be smaller than in the first part of the
year. While domestic demand is expected to
decline further, a positive contribution to growth is
expected from net trade. As a result, real GDP is
forecast to contract by 2.8% for 2014 as a whole,
substantially less than previously anticipated.
Unemployment is expected to average 16.2% for
2014 as a whole, following a further increase in the
second half of 2014. Moderate inflation in the
second half of 2014 should offset the sharp decline
in the first half, leaving HICP inflation close to
zero for 2014 as a whole.

Downside risks prevail

Risks are tilted to the downside. On the domestic
front, a more protracted period of tight credit
conditions, as well as a deeper and more prolonged
period of deleveraging, could weigh on domestic
demand. On the external front, sanctions against
Russia could hurt growth to a larger extent than
expected, both through the depreciation of the

Member States, Cyprus

Russian rouble and through possible disruptions in
the flow of tourists.
Strong fiscal adjustment continues

In 2014, the general government headline and
primary balance are projected to improve sharply
by about 2% of GDP, despite the on-going
recession. Revenue is expected to increase
compared to 2013, driven by consolidation
measures particularly on social contributions and
taxes on production and imports, high dividends
from the Central Bank of Cyprus and improved tax
collection. Together, these factors should more
than offset the negative impact of slowing
economic activity on the collection of taxes on
income and wealth. Total expenditure is expected
to remain on a decreasing path, despite an adverse
impact due to called government guarantees. This
largely reflects tight expenditure control, measures
under Cyprusâ economic adjustment programme to
reduce the public sector wage bill, and a
moderation of early retirements in the public
sector, which reduced the cost of lump-sum
pension payments.

The general government deficit is expected to
stabilise in 2015 and to decrease significantly in
2016, as better economic conditions should have a
positive impact on revenues. Further consolidation
efforts needed under the economic adjustment
programme should support these developments.
The projections include dividend income from the
Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) expected to amount
to about 0.6% of GDP in both 2015 and 2016, to
be distributed in line with the CBC's duties under
the Treaties (on the European Union and the
Functioning of the European Union) and the ESCB
and ECB Statute.
Cyprus' debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to peak in
2015 at about 115% and to decline afterwards,
supported by the economic recovery and the fiscal
performance. Compared to the previous forecast,
the debt-to-GDP ratio is positively affected by the
upward revision of nominal GDP by about 10%
due to the transition to ESA2010 and other
statistical benchmark revisions.

14. LATVIA
Economic growth buffeted by external turmoil
Economic growth in Latvia this year is slowing down, as developments between Russia and Ukraine
have hurt business and consumer confidence. Slower growth will weaken the countryâs fiscal position
somewhat in 2014, but growth is forecast to pick up again in 2015 and 2016, although the economy will
remain highly sensitive to external risks.
Growth outlook weakens

Economic growth slowed to 2.5% y-o-y in the first
half of 2014 from 4.2% in 2013 reflecting the
negative fallout from the conflict between Russia
and Ukraine that has offset an initial positive
momentum from the euro adoption. Retail trade
statistics point to some rebound in the third quarter
of 2014 but the short-term growth outlook remains
adversely affected by external risks and
deteriorating business expectations. Growth is
therefore projected to be relatively weak at 2.6% in
2014 and 2.9% in 2015 as compared to 3.8% and
4.1% in the spring forecast. In 2016, growth is
forecast to reach 3.6%, as the negative impact of
geopolitical tensions is expected to peter out. The
growth pattern is, however, highly sensitive to
external developments, where the risks are tilted to
the downside.

Unemployment continues its decline

Unemployment fell to an average of 11.3% in the
first half of 2014 from 12.2% a year earlier.
Employment grew only marginally for the same
period amid further contraction in the labour force
due to population ageing and emigration. The
annual average unemployment rate is projected to
drop steadily to around 9% in 2016 amid some
increase in job creation. There are also signs of
structural improvements on the labour market, as
the share of long-term unemployed (one year or
more) dropped to around 40% in the first half of
2014 from just over 50% a year earlier. Wages
increased by 7% over the same period, pushed by a
12% hike in the minimum wage at the beginning
of 2014, posing some risks to labour cost
competitiveness in the context of an unstable
external environment.

Confidence effects curb demand

Although the cycle of sanctions and
countersanctions with Russia has so far had little
direct impact on Latvian exporters, the indirect
impact through business and consumer confidence
has been substantial, effecting all demand
components. On the supply side, construction was
the main growth driver in the first half of 2014,
while the industrial sector was in a standstill, due
mainly to suspended production in some metal
processing companies, including the countryâs
largest steelmaker Liepajas Metalurgs. Possible

84

resumption of production at Liepajas Metalurgs
towards the end of 2014 represents a positive risk
to the growth forecast for 2015, although the
impact would be mostly on export and import
volumes and to a much lesser extent on valueadded growth.

Low energy and food prices have kept consumer
price inflation (HICP) below expectations so far
this year, while services performed in line with the
spring forecast. The Russian food embargo is
expected to maintain some downward pressure on
the Baltic market for a while. Nevertheless,
Latviaâs inflation is forecast to rebound from 0.8%
in 2014 to 1.8% in 2015 due to the forthcoming
deregulation of household electricity prices at the
beginning of 2015. A further upturn in consumer
prices is forecast for 2016 when economic growth
is expected to pick up. Non-tradable items, in
particular services, are forecast to keep Latviaâs
inflation above the EU average as incomes are also
forecast to rise at a higher rate.

Public finances face headwinds

The general government deficit is estimated at
1.1% of GDP in 2014. Tax revenue was broadly as
planned for the first three quarters of the year, but
some softening is expected towards the end of this
year. Overall expenditure is under control, while
higher capital and social spending is offset by
lower spending in other areas, including on interest
expenditure.
Following elections in October, the new
government will present the budget for 2015 later
than usual in the year and an updated Draft
Budgetary Plan will be submitted to the
Commission.
Under
a
no-policy-change
assumption, the general government deficit is
projected at 1.2% of GDP in 2015 and declining to
0.9% of GDP in 2016. The tax revenue to GDP
ratio is set to decrease as the personal income tax
rate will be reduced from 24% in 2014 to 23% in
2015 and 22% in 2016. In addition, the share of
social security contributions diverted to private
pension funds will increase from 4% in 2014 to
5% in 2015 and then to 6% in 2016. A decline in
non-tax revenues is related to lower dividend

payments from state-owned enterprises as a higher
share of profits will be retained for business
investment. On the expenditure side, pension
indexation, increasing family benefits per child
and electricity cost assistance to vulnerable
households will all contribute to an increase in
social benefits. Public sector wage increases are
expected to match those in the private sector in
view of the government's initiative to reduce the
pay gap especially for skilled specialists. However,
the increase in the public sector pay bill is
expected to be restrained by more streamlined
public services, also in view of the declining
population. Latvia's structural deficit is forecast to
deteriorate from 1% of GDP in 2013 to 1.5% in
2014 and 1.6% in 2015, due to both the widening
of the positive output gap and the weakening of the
nominal fiscal position.
The gross government debt level is projected to
reach 40% of GDP by the end of 2014, including
reserves accumulated for a large repayment of EU
financial support due in 2015. Following this
repayment, Latvia's debt should decline over the
following years, helped by GDP growth which
should outpace the governmentâs net borrowing.

Headwind from the east slows down economic growth
Domestic demand is set to sustain robust growth in Lithuania, but Russian sanctions are expected to
crimp exports and dampen consumer and investor sentiment, resulting in lower growth. Unemployment
is forecast to decline, while inflation is set to remain low.
Domestic demand boosted growth in 2014, but
sanctions are set to have a negative impact

In the first half of 2014, real GDP expanded by
3.1% compared to the same period last year, driven
by strong domestic demand. In particular, private
consumption picked up on the back of growing
employment and real wages, in turn having a
positive impact on private investment. However,
geopolitical tensions stemming from the RussiaUkraine events have dampened consumer and
business sentiment as well as exports. As a
consequence, real GDP growth is set to decrease in
the second half of the year, resulting in an overall
growth rate of 2.7% in 2014 as a whole.

Growth path remains intact in 2015 and 2016,
but downside risks remain

Looking ahead, real GDP is forecast to grow by
3.1% in 2015 and 3.4% in 2016. Although
geopolitical uncertainty will likely to dampen
private consumption and investment in early 2015,
this effect is expected to peter out over the year.
Private consumption is set to remain the main
growth engine over the forecast horizon as wage
growth and low inflation are expected to support
household disposable income. Private investment
is expected to pick up in the second half of 2015 as
companies' capacity utilisation is well above its
historical peak and credit conditions are expected
to improve, while EU co-financed projects will

86

Net exports are expected to weigh on real GDP
growth over the forecast horizon. In 2014, exports,
already weak because of declines in the fertiliser
and refined petroleum product industries, received
a further setback due to sanctions imposed by
Russia on agricultural products. In 2015 and 2016,
however, exports are set to recover, but imports are
forecast to accelerate as well due to robust
domestic demand. The surplus of the current
account is forecast to decline to 0.8% in 2014
before turning into a deficit in 2015 and
deteriorating further in 2016.
The unemployment rate is set to continue
declining, from 11.2% in 2014 to 9.5% in 2016.
This improvement is forecast to support nominal
wage and unit labour cost growth and sustain an
increase in real disposable incomes over the
forecast horizon.

support public investment over the forecast
horizon.

Risks to the growth forecast are tilted to the
downside. An escalation of the Russia-Ukraine
crisis and a further economic slowdown in the EU
could have a particularly dampening effect on
economic growth by hurting exports and business
sentiment and leading to higher energy prices.
Inflation surprised on the downside in 2014 but
is set to pick up slightly in 2015 and 2016

HICP 12-month average rate of inflation slowed to
0.3% in September 2014, due to weak energy and
food price developments. It is forecast to remain at
this level until early 2015, when a slight pick-up is
expected, also due to a small one-off effect from
the euro changeover due to rounding effects and
administrative costs at business level. Inflation in
the service sector is likely to rise on the back of
sustained wage growth, while energy and food
inflation are set to remain subdued. Overall, HICP
inflation is forecast to stand at 0.3% in 2014, 1.3%
in 2015, and 1.9% in 2016.

Member States, Lithuania

Credit growth remains feeble

Private sector deposits have continued to grow
robustly in 2014 but credit overall has remained
flat despite a pick-up in mortgage lending and
consumer credit. So far, most enterprises have
been able to finance new investments with their
own resources, while banks have focused on
profitable and less risky projects. Towards the end
of the forecast horizon, it is expected that credit
demand will pick up and lending standards will
ease as economic conditions become more
favourable.
Fiscal consolidation is advancing

In 2014, the general government deficit is forecast
to decrease to 1.2% of GDP, from 2.6% in 2013.
Tax revenues look broadly in line with budget plan
this year, while expenditure is set to be higher than
expected in spring as a result of the law on pension
compensation, which was enacted following a
Constitutional Court ruling in 2012 and is expected
to generate an increment in expenditure of 0.7% of
GDP. At the same time, the deposit insurance fund
has been reclassified as belonging to the general
government sector under the ESA 2010 standards.
This resulted in an upward revision of the general

government deficit in 2013 due to payments to
insured depositors following bankruptcies of credit
institutions, while in 2014 the fund is set to
contribute positively to the deficit, with an
expected impact of 1.3% of GDP.
In 2015, the general government deficit is forecast
to reach 1.4% of GDP. Tax revenues are set to
improve on the back of continued economic
growth. Although parliament has not yet approved
the 2015 budget, it can be expected that defence
spending and social spending will increase by 0.3
pp. and 0.2 pp. of GDP respectively.
Under a no-policy-change assumption, the general
government deficit is set to reach 0.8% of GDP in
2016.
The structural deficit is estimated to decrease from
2.2% of GDP in 2013 to 1.8% in 2014. It is set fall
further to 1.6% in 2015 and to 1.1% of GDP in
2016.
General government debt is expected to increase
from 39.0% of GDP in 2013 to 41.3% in 2014 and
41.6% in 2015, due to pre-financing bond
redemptions, and fall back to 41.3% in 2016.

16. LUXEMBOURG
Sustained growth but slightly weaker public finances
Economic output in Luxembourg is projected to continue growing strongly this year but growth in the
second half is expected to be lower, although job creation remains rather robust. Inflation is expected to
rebound in 2015 because of a planned increase in VAT rates but public finances surplus turn into
deficit, as windfall revenues that compensated for expenditure overruns in the past gradually fade away.
the medium term, recent regulatory changes may
dent the sectorâs growth potential in the short-term.

Growth continues to increase

Real GDP grew, in quarterly terms, by 1.7% and
0.7% in the first two quarters of the year,
respectively, adding to the economic recovery that
had already started in the second quarter of last
year. This positive outcome was driven by strong
domestic demand, notably investment, as well as
net exports. However, the worsening of overall
economic sentiment since May points to a less
favourable outlook for the second half of the year.
Overall, GDP is expected to grow by 3% in 2014.
Meanwhile, job creation accelerated to 2.2% in the
first half of the year, compared to 1.7% in the same
period of 2013, a high rate but still insufficient to
bring down unemployment given the sustained
upward trend of active labour population.

On the demand side, investment growth is
projected to recover in 2015 and 2016, although it
will be spread unevenly among economic sectors.
While public investment is expected to surge by
more than 10% in 2015 due to the implementation
of sizeable projects, private firms' investment is set
to remain subdued, in view of low capacity
utilisation and weak external demand. Meanwhile,
protracted low interest rates should continue to
support investments by households.
Persistently weak inflation and good employment
prospects should boost householdsâ purchasing
power and underpin consumption in 2014, notably
in the last quarter of the year in anticipation of a 2
pps. increase in VAT rates starting in 2015. Private
consumption should then grow by nearly 2% in
2014 and 2015 and accelerate further in 2016
along with the economic upturn.

2

The contribution of net exports to growth is set to
decline in 2015 on the back of subdued external
demand and a rebound of imports, although it
should remain positive. Conversely, in 2016,
external trade is expected to gain ground as global
economic conditions gradually improve.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Due to the general economic slowdown and to
necessary adjustments in the financial sector in
response to new regulatory financial standards,
output expansion is estimated to slow to 2.4% in
2015, before accelerating again to 2.9% in 2016.
On the supply side, the upswing of the
construction and manufacturing sectors continued
early in 2014, while the contribution to growth by
the financial sector is expected to remain broadly
stable. Luxembourgâs financial sector is changing
direction, looking for new customers and markets.
However, although expectations look promising in

Challenging outlook for the financial sector

A prolonged slowdown in the euro area represents
a particularly relevant downside risk for
Luxembourgâs economy. On the domestic side, the
main challenge relates to the financial sectorâs
capacity to quickly and successfully adapt to
changes in the regulatory environment.
Lower inflation and solid job creation

Receding energy and non-processed food prices
along with a moderation in regulated prices have
driven inflation down to 1.0% in 2014 from to
1.7% in 2013. HICP is expected to bounce back to
around 2.0% in 2015, partly in response to the
VAT hike, and to then level out in 2016.

Member States, Luxembourg

Job creation performed strongly in the first half of
2014, although a more recent uptake in partial
employment is indicative of less favourable
business conditions. Labour market prospects are
nevertheless set to remain positive and yearly
employment growth to be about 2.1% over the
forecast horizon on the back of a solid economic
outlook. The unemployment rate is expected to
only slightly decrease in 2016 to 6.1% after
peaking at 6.2% in 2015, partly reflecting a slow
but sustained increase in structural unemployment.
Public finances weaken in 2015

In 2014, the general government surplus is set to
decline to 0.2% of GDP from 0.6% in 2013. In
spite of consolidation measures, worth 0.4% of
GDP, the increase in public spending is expected
to outweigh revenue growth, as public investment
has risen and VAT revenues have been less
dynamic than initially projected.
In 2015, public finances will be strongly marked
by the VAT revenue shortfall, estimated at around
1.5 % of GDP, due to the change in EU regulation
on e-commerce. The consolidation measures
included in the Draft Budget, amounting to slightly
above 1% of GDP, are expected to only partially

offset the fiscal loss. The headline balance is thus
projected to turn into a deficit of 0.4% of GDP. On
the revenue side, the above-mentioned 2 pps. hike
in standard VAT rates, worth 0.5% of GDP, has
been confirmed. Alongside, additional revenues
(0.3% of GDP) will be raised through the
introduction of a new education contribution levied
on personal income. The rest of the consolidation
package is focused on the expenditure side, with
savings amounting to around 0.4% of GDP
reflected in the forecast. Finally, the forecast
includes stronger public investment. In 2016,
under a no-policy-change assumption, the deficit is
expected to widen to 0.6% of GDP. The shift to
automatic exchange of information among EU tax
authorities is expected to reduce revenues by
around 0.1% of GDP for that year.
The structural fiscal balance is estimated to narrow
from a surplus of 1Â¼% of GDP in 2014 to a
surplus of Â½% of GDP in 2015 and to weaken
further in 2016. The debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated
to drop in 2014 to 23%, before surging to above
25% in 2016, mainly reflecting the fact that the
surplus in the social contribution sector cannot be
used to finance the central government deficit
position.

17. HUNGARY
Strong growth set to moderate
Hungaryâs GDP is set to grow robustly by around 3.2% this year but to slow to 2.5% in 2015 and 2% in
2016. Unemployment is expected to stabilise below 8% and inflation to bounce back gradually to 3%
over the forecast horizon, while the government deficit is projected to fall from nearly 3% of GDP this
year to 2.5% in 2016.
Better-than -expected GDP but weaker growth
dynamics ahead

In the first half of this year, Hungaryâs GDP grew
by 3.8% (y-o-y), beating expectations thanks to
both domestic demand, which contributed 3.6 pps.
to output growth and net exports, which
contributed the rest. While household consumption
grew by 2%, gross fixed capital formation
surprised with an outstanding 16.8% increase. The
surge in both public and private investment was
partly supported by one-off factors, such as
accelerated absorption of EU funds and the central
bankâs Funding for Growth Scheme of subsidised
loans to SMEs.
High frequency data, from construction, retail sales
and recently industrial production, point to a
decrease in GDP growth in the second half of the
year. For the year as a whole, however, GDP
growth is forecast to remain strong at 3.2%. The
slowdown in growth is projected to continue
throughout the forecast horizon as the impact of
the above-mentioned one-off boosts fade away and
economic activity evolves more in line with
fundamentals. GDP is set to expand by 2.5% in
2015 and by 2% in 2016. Domestic demand is
expected to remain the main driver of economic
growth, but with a shift from investments to
private consumption. New mortgage rules are
expected to elevate real disposable incomes as
banks will have to reimburse revenues that legally
considered to have been unfairly collected. Export
growth is forecast to decrease slightly due to lower
demand from major trade partners. Meanwhile
imports are expected to grow, fuelled by private
consumption.
Unemployment should continue falling while
inflation gradually picks up

In H1 2014, unemployment decreased to a low of
8.2% and it is forecast to stabilise below 8%.
Employment is expected to keep on growing and
so will the activity rate. On top of private sector
job creation, employment should also be supported
from extensive public works. At the same time,

90

wage dynamics in the private sector should remain
moderate, but as inflation is low, real wages are
projected to increase faster throughout the forecast
horizon.
Consumer prices in the first nine months of 2014
remained broadly unchanged due to subdued
imported inflation, low food prices, regulated
energy price cuts and declining inflation
expectations. As these effects diminish and the
weaker exchange rate passes through to prices,
inflation is expected to resume, reaching 2.5% in
2015 and, as the output gap closes, 3% in 2016.
More risks on the downside

Given the countryâs relatively high proportion of
foreign currency-denominated debt, Hungary is
exposed to possible monetary tightening by major
central banks. This could result in higher risk
premia and depreciate the Forint, which in turn
would weaken the private sectorâs balance sheet.
With the persistence of subdued external inflation,
the weakening of external demand could lead to
lower growth and lower inflation. Moreover,
Hungary could be severely affected if the RussiaUkraine crisis deepens, through both the real
economy and financial channels. A positive risk
can arise if private consumption dynamics are
more in line with the projected path of real
disposable
income
growth
(i.e.
lower
precautionary attitude in savings). Finally, growth
could be higher if normal lending is restored faster
than assumed as a confidence effect stemming
from the current strong investment growth.
Gradually improving public accounts

The 2014 general government deficit is projected
to reach the official target of -2.9% of GDP, from 2.4% in the previous year. While the switch to
ESA2010 and other statistical revisions
deteriorated the headline figure by 0.2% of GDP,
the underlying budgetary position has improved
since the spring forecast. This is due to the
significantly better revenue outlook as well as to
the expenditure freezes announced in July. These

Member States, Hungary

developments are just partly offset by expenditure
slippages and the assumed financial corrections of
EU funds. The forecast assumes a partial spending
of the extraordinary reserve (some two-thirds out
of the budgeted 0.3% of GDP).

expenditures covered by EU funds are expected to
fall by 1.8% of GDP, negatively affecting tax
receipts.
The risks appear overall balanced to the projected
deficit path. On the positive side, the new system
of on-line cash registers could generate higher
revenues than currently estimated (0.3% of
GDP).On the negative side, implementation risks
are emerging for the planned public wage freezes
in 2015 and beyond. Further uncertainties stem
from the balance of local governments, as well as
from the timing and magnitude of the potential
financial corrections of EU funds.

The 2015 deficit is expected to improve slightly to
2.8% of GDP, which is based on a no-policychange assumption as the draft budget was not
released by the cut-off date of the forecast. The
pick-up of private consumption growth, public
wage restraints and declining public investment
after the election year should all have a deficit
lowering effect. However, this is anticipated to be
largely offset by the drop-out of factors just
temporarily containing the deficit in the previous
year, most importantly the one-off receipts from
the sale of telecom spectrum licenses. It is
assumed that 0.2% of GDP out of the
extraordinary reserve will be spent.

The structural balance is forecast to deteriorate
considerably in 2014 to -2.7% of GDP, and then to
broadly stabilise at this level. The debt-to-GDP
ratio is forecast to decrease by 0.4 pps. in 2014 as
the negative impact of the weakening exchange
rate and the corporate takeovers are expected to be
largely offset by additional stock-flow operations.
In 2015, the further decline is contained by the
need to provide domestic advance payments for
the closing of EU co-financed projects. The ratio is
to decline more rapidly in 2016.

In 2016, the deficit is projected to decrease to
2.5% of GDP, assuming no-policy-change and also
that the extraordinary reserve will not be used.
With the economic slowdown, public spending
increasing below the rate of nominal GDP will
only marginally improve the deficit. Moreover,

18. MALTA
Smooth sailing in choppy waters
Economic activity in Malta continued to outperform the weak growth in the EU in the first half of 2014.
A strong rebound in investment is projected to boost growth to 3% in 2014, before moderating
somewhat over the forecast horizon. The budget deficit is projected to gradually decline over the
forecast horizon, while the government debt is forecast to remain stable.
Growth in first half of 2014 higher than
anticipatedâ¦

The Maltese economy continued expanding at a
robust rate in the first half of 2014. Annual real
GDP growth surprised positively and reached
3.2%, up from 2.5% for 2013 as a whole. Growth
was driven by buoyant domestic demand,
particularly thanks to investment and public
spending. Net exports also contributed positively
as a drop in exports, driven by a further contraction
in the electrical machinery industry, was more than
offset by a decline in imports.

Favourable labour market developments and
growing disposable income, also related to the
lowering of electricity tariffs in 2014, are forecast
to spur private consumption over the forecast
horizon. At the same time, after peaking in 2014,
the contribution of public consumption to growth
is projected to moderate.

â¦and is expected to remain strong over the
forecast horizon.

Overall, real GDP growth is projected to reach 3%
in 2014 and moderate gradually to 2.9% in 2015
and 2.7% in 2016. Large scale energy projects,
including the construction of a power plant in
2014-15 are expected to be a major driver of
growth over the forecast horizon. Improving
business sentiment and the absorption of EU funds,
as projects funded under the 2007-13 financial
framework are coming to an end, are expected to
provide a further boost. Private investment in
equipment and machinery is set to benefit from
improving financing conditions, reflected in a
gradual decline in interest rates, but bank credit
standards for the construction sector are not
expected to loosen notably.

-6

The strong investment profile is expected to
impact Maltaâs external trade figures over the
forecast horizon due to the high import content of
investment. Net exports are forecast to contribute
negatively to growth in 2014, as the growth in
imports is seen to pick up and outpace the
relatively weak exports in the second half of the
year. The expiration of the major energy-related
projects in 2015 should result in a moderation of
imports, while the upturn in global demand and
especially the recovery of the electronics industry
is projected to boost exports.

Risks are mainly concentrated around the
investment outlook. Slippages in the energy
projects would shift the growth profile forward,
while the improvement in investor sentiment and
the foreign investment in the energy sector could
provide a further boost in 2015-16. The
depreciation of the euro could boost demand for
Maltese exports from outside the EU.
Price inflation is projected to pick-up

HICP inflation was low in the first nine months of
2014 because of the reduction in electricity tariffs
for households in April and very moderate
increases in food prices. Overall, HICP is
projected to average 0.7% in 2014 as a whole
before gradually picking up to 2% in 2016. This
increase is expected to come mainly from a
stabilisation in energy prices and a normalisation
in food prices inflation. The expected lowering of
electricity tariffs for industry in 2015 is projected
to keep input costs contained and, in turn, services

Member States, Malta

inflation stable, thereby offsetting upward pressure
from householdsâ growing disposable income.
Deficit under control despite growing spending

The general government deficit is expected to
improve marginally in 2014 to 2.5% of GDP, from
2.7% in the previous year. Current revenues are
projected to increase thanks to the favourable
macroeconomic outlook as well as to the revenue
increasing measures included in the 2014 budget,
namely increases in indirect taxation, a new
programme to grant Maltese citizenship to foreign
individuals and families and the introduction of a
new tax regime for rental income. In addition, in
July, a new scheme intended to enable taxpayers to
adjust past irregular declarations of income was
launched. Despite the restrictions on recruitment
envisaged by the 2014 budget, employment in the
public sector has increased due to the temporary
nationalization of the transport system as well as
higher recruitments mainly in the health and
education sectors. Therefore current expenditure is
expected to increase, also due to higher than
expected subsidies to the transport sector as well as
intermediate consumption. Net capital expenditure
is expected to fall due to a lower capital injection

into Air Malta, compared to the one in 2013.
In 2015, under the no-policy-change assumption,
as the 2015 budget was not presented before the
cut-off date of the forecast, the deficit is expected
to increase marginally to 2.6% of GDP, also due to
a further capital injection into Air Malta, higher
than the previous year one (0.5% of GDP).
In 2016, using the no-policy-change assumption,
the deficit is expected to decline to 2.0% of GDP,
thanks to a favourable growth outlook and to the
expiration of the public support for Air Malta.
After having decreased by more than 1 pp. of GDP
in 2013, the structural deficit is projected to
stabilise in 2014 and to deteriorate marginally in
2015. In 2016, the structural deficit is expected to
improve by Â½ pp. of GDP.
The general government debt-to-GDP ratio
increased to 69.8% in 2013, also on account of a
debt-increasing stock-flow adjustment. Despite the
expected repayment of some tax arrears from
Enemalta (the public energy utility corporation),
the debt ratio is projected to continue increasing in
2014 thanks also to a higher cash buffer at the end
of the year, before moderating somewhat by 2016.

19. THE NETHERLANDS
Turning the corner?
After some promising signs in the second half of 2013, the economic recovery of the Netherlands has
wavered in 2014 and the outlook remains fragile. Nevertheless, real GDP growth this year is expected
to reach 0.9% and rise to 1.4% in 2015, supported by positive developments in the housing and labour
markets. The general government deficit is expected to continue declining.
Volatile growth in the early stages of an upturn

The second half of 2013 was a turning point for the
Dutch economy. Soft indicators signalled a sharp
improvement, which was confirmed particularly in
the business sector, where investment grew
significantly. At the same time, private
consumption picked up, with housing market
developments supporting the return to more sound
domestic economic fundamentals. Growth swings
in Q1 2014 appear to have been mainly the
outcome of incidental factors, such as low gas
consumption due to the relatively warm winter.
The sizeable drop in investment at the beginning of
2014 was related to a surge in company car
purchases at the end of 2013, driven by the expiry
of favourable tax arrangements.
A shift to domestic demand supports the
hesitant recovery

Building on positive developments since the
second half of 2013, domestic demand is expected
to contribute modestly to economic growth this
year and to take over as the main driver of growth
in the years ahead. At the same time, the recent
pause in the improvement of soft indicators seems
to suggest a fragile and moderate pick-up over the
short to medium term.
After two consecutive years of significant
contraction, private consumption is forecast to
stabilise in 2014 and to pick up over 2015 and
2016. Following several years of negative
developments, real disposable income is expected
to increase in 2014, supported by real wage
increases (in particular for government employees
as of 2015), lower taxes on labour, and lower
pension and health care premia. In addition, a
gradually recovering housing market, buttressed by
measures
targeted
at
wealth-constrained
households reduces pressures on savings.
Investment is expected to evolve in line with
economic
growth,
accelerating
industrial
production, and a capacity utilisation ratio that

94

although still below its long-term average, is
rising.
As domestic demand takes hold, imports should
also rise. As a result, the contribution of net
exports to growth will likely decline, as Dutch
exports are expected to grow broadly in line with
the recovery in world trade.
Unemployment
muted

stabilises,

inflation

remains

Since mid-2013, the unemployment rate has been
relatively stable, hovering around 7%, although it
did increase slightly in the first quarter of this year.
In recent months, however, the unemployment rate
has started to fall, more than anticipated, although
this is partly due to a decline in the labour force.
The unemployment rate is forecast to average at
6.9% for 2014 and to gradually decline over the
forecast horizon. The employment outlook remains
weak in the short term, as labour markets tend to
respond slowly to changes in the business cycle.

HICP inflation is very low, hovering around 0.3%.
In line with trends in import prices, moderate real
wage gains and the very gradual pickup in
domestic demand over the forecast horizon,
inflation is expected to reach 0.4% this year and to
record only modest increases thereafter to 0.8% in
2015 and 1.1% in 2016. In the short run, the

Member States, The Netherlands

rebound in domestic demand is unlikely to raise
inflationary pressures, given the scale of excess
capacity.
Downside risks persist

The biggest risk to the macroeconomic scenario
stems from the possibility that adverse global
developments could spill over to the very open
economy of the Netherlands, unsettling its homegrown recovery. If business confidence
deteriorates, investment would suffer and the
labour marketâs recovery may be more drawn out,
constraining gains in disposable income and thus
in consumption. Moreover, the household debt
overhang may continue to weigh on growth more
heavily than assumed.
Deficit set to decline further

In 2014, the general government deficit is expected
to rise slightly to 2.5% of GDP, from 2.3% in
2013. Although one-off measures of around 0.6%
of GDP improved the deficit in 2013, no such
measures are planned in 2014. Non-gas
government revenues are foreseen to increase in
line with the improving economy, and structural

savings of around 0.1% of GDP should be realised
in the health care sector in 2014. Despite the
declining fiscal consolidation efforts, the headline
government deficit is expected to decrease further,
to respectively 2.1% and 1.8% of GDP in 2015 and
2016, on the back of improvement in economic
activity. The forecast takes into account the
measures detailed in the draft budget for 2015 as
well as the measures announced in the multiannual budget agreement (âRegeerakkoordâ). As
domestic demand recovers, growth becomes more
tax-rich; in addition, savings from the planned
decentralisation of social security and long-term
care are also expected.
Following an improvement of 1.6% of GDP in
2013, the structural balance is expected to
marginally improve in 2014 and to deteriorate by
0.3% of GDP in 2015. The gross government debt
ratio is forecast to further increase in 2015, before
declining again to 69.9% in 2016. Risks to the
fiscal forecast largely mirror macroeconomic
uncertainties but also stem from some of the fiscal
measures in 2014 (notably the temporary tax
reduction on accrued severance payments) and
from the planned expenditure savings in 2015.

20. AUSTRIA
Going through another soft patch
Economic growth in Austria failed to live up to expectations in the first half of the year, as exports
weakened amid a less favourable external environment. Nevertheless, the domestic economy seems well
prepared to support a reinvigoration of growth over 2015-16 when foreign demand picks up again. The
governmentâs deficit looks set to decline in 2015 after widening substantially in 2014 due to financial
sector repair.
The recovery has paused again...

years, should revive construction activity over the
coming years.

The confidence rally of late 2013 stalled in the first
half of 2014 and Austriaâs recovery lost pace. The
brisker growth momentum of the last two quarters
of 2013 (0.4% and 0.3% respectively) halved on
account of export growth, which though positive,
was much weaker as a result of the deteriorating
external environment. Domestic demand was
buttressed by public consumption, while private
consumption growth was anaemic and fixed capital
formation remained, on the whole, stagnant. On
the supply side, traditional activity drivers like
manufacturing, construction and retail provided no
or even a negative contribution to growth.

Even if adversely affected by the developments in
the first half of 2014, the evolution of foreign
demand over the forecast horizon should be to the
advantage of Austrian exporters, which are still
benefiting from improving productivity and from
their strong integration in international production
chains. The improving outlook for exports should
in turn help restart investment growth. With both
exports and imports picking up, net exports will
cede their key role for boosting growth but
continue to contribute positively.
A stable labour market

...but still in good shape to resume.

No strong acceleration of growth is expected in the
third and fourth quarter of 2014 and thus GDP
growth for the year is expected to be around 0.7%,
mainly on account of strong carryover from last
year. Business and consumer sentiment indicators
for the third quarter indicate another soft patch
extending over the remainder of this year and
possibly the beginning of next one.
Nevertheless, the economy should be well set for a
recovery over the next two years. In 2015 and
2016, GDP growth is forecast to strengthen to
1.2% and 1.5% respectively, somewhat below
earlier projections. Domestic demand is expected
to benefit from a number of supporting factors and
to contribute to the bulk of the increase in GDP.
The low interest rate environment remains
supportive of investment, although capacity
utilisation rates indicate some degree of slack. In
addition, companiesâ assessments of capacity with
respect to their order books has tended to decline,
indicating ripening renewal needs after 2-3 years
of lukewarm investment. Consequently, a rebound
in equipment investment can be expected. Low
interest rates should also favour housing demand,
which, together with rising house prices in recent

96

Employment growth has accelerated to 1.1% yearon -year, despite sluggish economic activity in the
first half of 2014, driven by job creation in
services. While employment expectations of
businesses indicate a forthcoming deceleration of
this dynamic, with GDP growth firming up,
employment growth should remain positive in
2015 and another uptick is projected in 2016.
Unemployment may, however, be slow to decline,
as labour supply is likely to keep increasing on
account of migration.
Inflation positive and stable

Consumer price inflation hovered around 1.5 in
January-September 2014 reflecting a mild
disinflationary impact from energy prices. The
momentum in the remaining components, in
particular hospitality and recreation services, has
continued due to unabated demand in these sectors,
thus steering clear of deflation. These trends are
expected to remain in place over the forecast
horizon, especially as demand strengthens. Thus
inflation is likely to stay around or above 1.7% in
2015 and 2016.

Member States, Austria

of the large one-off cost for financial sector repair
that took place in 2014. Nevertheless, this effect is
projected to be partially offset by further
government intervention in the financial sector in
2015.

Government deficit to decrease in 2015 after
substantial widening due to financial sector
repair

The general government headline deficit is
expected to increase to 2.9% of GDP in 2014,
mostly due to the impact of the establishment of an
Asset Management Company (AMC) for Hypo
Alpe Adria, which is currently estimated to amount
to 1.2% of GDP in 2014.

The structural balance is expected to improve
marginally in each year of the forecast horizon,
arriving at -0.7% of GDP in 2016, signalling a
broadly neutral fiscal stance.

The deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook,
coming from lower external demand and lower
investment, is expected to have a limited impact on
public finances in 2014. It will materialise mostly
through an increase in social transfers, while
revenue growth is forecast to show a much
stronger dynamic than GDP growth, as revenue
remains supported by resilient tax bases for both
household taxation and indirect taxes.

The implementation of ESA 2010 led to an
increase in the debt level, with this impact
amounting to 6% of GDP in 2013. According to
the new methodology, the current level of Austria's
debt incorporates the balance sheets of several
public and semi-private companies, such as the
national railways operator, KA Finanz and many
public hospitals, which were previously recorded
outside the general government sector. In addition,
the general government debt is forecast to increase
substantially in 2014 due to the inclusion of the
balance sheet of Hypo Alpe Adria's AMC. The
overall effect of this operation accounts for 5.5%
of GDP. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
gradually decrease to 84% of GDP in 2016.

Austria's headline deficit is projected to decrease
to 1.8% of GDP in 2015 and shrink further to 1.1%
of GDP in 2016 under a no-policy change
assumption, in light of the improving
macroeconomic outlook. The reduction of the
deficit in 2015 is partly due to the vanishing effect

21. POLAND
Economic activity hits a soft patch
Economic growth in Poland is expected to moderate over the rest of the year, as weaker demand in the
euro area and the situation in Ukraine dampen exports, before strengthening again in the outer year of
the forecast horizon. Public finances are projected to improve gradually.
A robust recovery in early 2014â¦

In the first half of 2014 real GDP grew by 3.4%
compared to the same period a year earlier, mainly
on account of stronger domestic demand. In
particular, private consumption gained momentum,
as consumer confidence improved, employment
increased and real wages rose. Stronger external
demand and lower financing costs also fuelled a
rebound in corporate investment which has been
anaemic in recent years.

Poland's labour market is expected to benefit from
the solid pace of economic activity over the
forecast horizon. The unemployment rate is set to
decline from 9.5% in 2014 to 8.8% in 2016. This
improvement is set to sustain nominal wage
growth and, in turn, an increase in real disposable
income.

â¦is projected to slow down temporarily in the
second half of the year

Polish exports are set to weaken in the remainder
of 2014 amid tensions beyond Polandâs Eastern
borders and, more importantly, due to weak
external demand, especially in the euro area. As a
result, private investment expenditure is projected
to weaken too. However, the slowdown in export
growth and investment is expected to be temporary
as the negative impact on the Polish economy from
the Ukraine/Russia conflict is assumed to peter out
in 2015. Private consumption is set to remain
resilient on the back of growing real wages and
further improvements in the labour market
situation.
The ongoing recovery of credit growth, coupled
with declining financing costs, is expected to
provide additional support to private investment
expenditure over the forecast horizon. Public
investment is set to gather pace in 2015 as new
projects financed by EU funds are being rolled out.
Economic activity is expected to accelerate
somewhat in 2016, in line with a broader recovery
of external demand. Real GDP growth is forecast
to average 3% in 2014, to ease marginally to 2.8%
in 2015 before bouncing back up to 3.3% in 2016.
The annual contribution of net exports to real GDP
growth is forecast to remain negative as domestic
demand for foreign goods and services accelerates
more than exports. Against this backdrop, the
current-account deficit is expected to increase to
2.8% of GDP in 2016, up from 2% in 2014.

The risks to the economic forecast are broadly
balanced. On the upside, a stronger depreciation of
the Polish ZÅoty in the wake of interest rate moves
by the National Bank of Poland would further
boost exports and support import substitution. On
the downside, an escalation of the Ukraine/Russia
crisis could weigh on economic activity by further
hurting exports and business confidence and by
increasing energy prices.
Supply side factors curb inflation in the short
run

Very low external inflationary pressure coupled
with the effect of a good domestic harvest on food
prices are forecast to drive average HICP inflation
down to 0.2% in 2014. Inflation is set to pick up
moderately to 1.1% in 2015, on the back of the
assumed recovery in energy prices and positive
base effect of food prices. Resilient private
consumption and growing employment are poised
to contribute positively. A further increase of
inflation to 1.9% is forecast in 2016, fuelled by
higher import prices and a sustained improvement
in domestic demand.

Member States, Poland

(including higher indexation of low-income
pensions and a tax credit for families with
children) will partially offset other expenditure
savings, in particular the partial freeze of public
wages. In 2016, under a no-policy change
assumption, the general government deficit is
projected to improve marginally compared to
2015. Risks around this projection mainly relate to
the macroeconomic outlook. The structural deficit
is estimated to gradually improve over the forecast
horizon, from 3.5% of GDP in 2013 to 2.5% of
GDP in 2016.

Public finances set to improve gradually

Poland's general government deficit is projected to
decrease to 3.4% of GDP in 2014, down from 4%
of GDP in 2013, largely due to the projected
expansion of aggregate economic activity and
stronger-than-expected tax revenues. Moreover,
the partial reversal of the previous systemic
pension reform is set to increase social
contributions retained by the general government.
The expenditure side also contributes to the
expected reduction of deficit in 2014, in particular
due to limited growth of public investment and a
partial freeze of public wages. Expenditure
savings, however, will be partially offset by the
costs of a legislated extension of maternity leave
and other increases in social spending.

Thanks to a large transfer of pension fund assets
linked to the partial reversal of the systemic
pension reform, the general government debt-toGDP ratio is set to fall from 55.7% in 2013 to
49.1% in 2014. It is set to amount to 50.1% in
2016. The projected debt figures are, however,
subject to considerable uncertainty because of the
potential impact of exchange rate fluctuations on
the relatively high share of Polandâs sovereign
debt denominated in foreign currencies.

The general government deficit is forecast to
reduce further to 2.9% of GDP in 2015, as
government revenues are expected to continue to
improve on the back of the projected pace of
economic growth. On the expenditure side, some
new measures increasing social spending

22. PORTUGAL
As external demand falters, domestic demand takes over
Portugalâs economic recovery is facing headwinds from slowing external demand. As a result, growth
will increasingly come from private consumption. A return to a domestic demand-driven growth model
could put the reduction of external imbalances at risk.
A moderate recovery continues

Portugalâs real GDP increased by 0.3% q-o-q in
the second quarter of 2014, mainly driven by
domestic demand and only partly offsetting the
decline in the first quarter by 0.4% q-o-q which
was due to one-off factors. Private consumption
posted solid growth of 1.9% y-o-y in the first half
of the year, in line with improved confidence and
favourable employment developments. However,
the strong private spending momentum is expected
to wane over the forecast period amid continued
deleveraging pressure on household balance sheets
and more subdued disposable income growth.
A resilient performance of machinery and
equipment investment more than compensated for
the weaker-than-expected construction activity in
the first semester of 2014 and is expected to
stabilise fixed investment in the second semester
of this year. Gross fixes investment is projected to
grow by around 2% in 2014, and it should benefit
from stronger demand, low interest rates and the
need to renew capital stocks in the outer years.

the first semester of 2014, and the unemployment
rate falling to 14.0% in August 2014, down by
2 pps. since last year. However, recent
employment gains seem to some extent be related
to successful active labour market policies and
thereby overstate labour market dynamics.
Therefore, total employment is forecast to expand
by 1.6% in 2014 and by 0.8% in 2015 and 2016.
Combined with a projected average annual decline
of the labour force by 0.4%, the unemployment
rate is set to decline from 14.5% in 2014 to 12.8 %
in 2016.
HICP was flat in September, but the increase in
minimum wage as of October 2014 is set to
contain deflationary risks. For 2014 as a whole,
HICP is expected to remain flat, and to increase by
0.6% in 2015 and 0.9% in 2016.

As a result, domestic demand is expected to
become the main driver of growth while net
exports are forecast to contribute negatively to
economic growth in 2014 but gradually improve
over the forecast period. Real GDP is projected to
grow by 0.9% in 2014 and accelerate to 1.3% in
2015 and 1.7% in 2016.

Exports are losing momentum due to weakening
external demand while robust private consumption
is boosting imports, further weighing on the
contribution of net exports to growth. The current
account balance is projected to recover marginally
this year, mainly due to tourism. In 2015 and 2016,
however, the current account is expected to move
to a small surplus on the back of a rebound of
external demand.

Downside risks to the economic outlook

Risks to the economic outlook remain tilted to the
downside. Portugalâs export performance is still
heavily dependent on the economic environment in
Europe. The private sector is highly indebted and
continued deleveraging pressure could further
dampen economic growth. Sovereign bond yields
are currently relatively low as a result of global
monetary policies and a return of investor
confidence. However, a reversal of global
monetary policy trends, or a weakening of

Member States, Portugal

structural reform and fiscal consolidation efforts,
could lead to a rise in risk premia.
Fading consolidation effort

The 2014 general government headline deficit is
forecast at 4.9% of GDP, including costs of
financing operations to state-owned enterprises
and the write-off of non-performing loans of BPN
CrÃ©dito. Budget execution is characterised by
strong revenue collection, especially of indirect
taxes and better-than-expected performance of
social security on the back of the economic
recovery, a more effective fight against tax fraud
and easing tensions in the labour market. The
second Supplementary Budget 2014 plans to use
these revenues to replace the expenditure cuts
overturned by the Constitutional Court in the
summer as well as to cover some slippages in other
expenditure lines.
Based on the measures included in the 2015 draft
budgetary plan, the budget deficit is forecast at
3.3% of GDP next year, markedly higher than the
2.7% of GDP planned by the Portuguese
government. The improvement in the fiscal
balance will be supported by further economic
recovery as well as well as a consolidation package
which is roughly equally split between revenue

increases and expenditure savings and includes
some small-scale one-off operations. At the same
time, the budget allows for increases in most
expenditure items, which partially offset the
deficit-reducing impact of increasing revenues and
of the consolidation measures. The higher deficit
forecast compared with the plans of the Portuguese
government is mainly due to more cautious
assumptions about revenue collection next year.
These projections are consistent with a cumulated
improvement in the structural balance of about Â½%
of GDP over 2013 to 2015.
Portugalâs government debt-to-GDP ratio stood at
128.0% at the end of 2013 and is projected to start
declining in the second half of this year as the
economy recovers and the government makes use
of accumulated cash reserves and other debtreducing operations.
Risks to the fiscal outlook are tilted to the
downside and are related to the economic outlook,
budgetary implementation risks and the possibility
of another Constitutional Court ruling overturning
some policies. In addition, the 2014 headline
deficit could turn out significantly higher than
expected should the costs of the resolution of
Banco EspÃ­rito Santo (amounting to 2.8% of GDP)
also be considered deficit-increasing by the
statistical authorities.

23. ROMANIA
Investment plunge weighs on the economy in 2014
Economic growth is expected to recover following a dent in 2014 induced by a drop in investment.
Inflation should slowly pick up after a sharp decrease in 2014. The fiscal consolidation path is forecast
to be reversed in 2015.
Private consumption
growth in 2014

and

exports

support

The pace of real GDP growth slowed down from
3.5% in 2013 to 2.4% y-o-y in the first half of
2014, largely due to a strong deceleration in the
second quarter (1.2% y-o-y). Private consumption
and net exports were the main drivers of growth
while investments continued to contribute
negatively (gross fixed capital formation dropped
by 11.1% y-o-y in the first half of 2014). As a
result, GDP growth in 2014 is projected at 2.0%.
In the second half of 2014, improved confidence
and higher real disposable income are expected to
support consumption. Investment growth is
projected to regain momentum, sustained by both
private and public investments.
Growth to rise over 2015-16

Against a background of a subdued economic
scenario in the euro area, growth in Romania is
nevertheless forecast to gradually pick up and stay
above potential at 2.4% in 2015 and 2.8% in 2016.
Private consumption is projected to remain
resilient, supported by increasing real disposable
income on account of still dynamic growth of
wages, low inflation and declining interest rates.
Credit growth, which has been contracting for the
last two years, is expected to marginally improve
based on the recent recovery in local currency
lending, eased credit conditions and an expected
slowdown in the deleveraging process. The
increase of investor confidence, together with a tax
exemption for reinvested profits (as of July 2014)
and a cut in social-security contributions (from 1
October 2014) are likely to provide additional
resources for businesses to boost investment.
Exports of goods and services rose strongly in the
first half of 2014, outpacing expectations with a
yearly growth of 12.8% while imports were up by
10.6%. The positive growth contribution of net
exports is set to fade in H2 2014 and to turn
negative over 2015-16 as import growth slightly
outpaces export growth, due to stronger domestic
demand. Exports are forecast to remain resilient
despite subdued activity in the euro area.

102

Sharply decelerating inflation in 2014

Inflation remained subdued in the first half of
2014, reaching a record low in June (HICP was
0.9% y-o-y) but picked up marginally in recent
months. The low inflation can largely be attributed
to temporary supply-side shocks including the
VAT cut for bread, an appreciation of the leu, and
persisting subdued inflation in the euro area.
Inflation is now expected to average 1.5% in 2014,
lower than projected in spring, on account of the
prospects for a good harvest, delays in gas price
liberalisation, lower global energy prices, and
lower inflation expectations. It is forecast to reach
an annual average of 2.1% in 2015 and 2.7% in
2016 due to the recovery in domestic demand, to
the base effects from low food prices in 2014 and
to the on-going convergence of prices towards the
EU average.
Broadly balanced macroeconomic risks

Downside risks include faster-than-expected
deleveraging by households and financial
institutions and the impact of a further
deterioration in geo-political tensions hurting
confidence and the main trading partners'
economic outlook. Upside risks comprise higher
investment
thanks
to
better-than-expected
absorption of EU funds and stronger domestic
demand induced by fiscal slippages in connection
with this year's presidential elections. Risks to the
inflation outlook are balanced over the forecast
horizon.
Labour market remains weak

Labour market developments remained subdued in
the first half of 2014. The number of employees
was unchanged, while overall employment further
decreased by 1% y-o-y due to a fall in the number
of self-employed. For the full year, overall
employment growth is expected to stay marginally
below its 2013 level. In 2015 and 2016,
employment is forecast to gradually recover,
supported by stronger growth. Unemployment
declined from 7.3% in December 2013 to 7% in
July 2014, and it is expected to stabilise over the

forecast horizon. Growth in nominal compensation
per employee, which stood at around 9% in 2013,

revenues of around 0.1% of GDP. According to the
law, excise rates are expected to be reduced in
2015. Expenditures should decline somewhat, also
on account of slightly lower public investments.

Budget deficit to increase in 2015

In 2014, the deficit is projected to fall to 2.1% of
GDP, from 2.2% of GDP in 2013. On the revenue
side, an increase in excise duties on fuels and a
broadening of the basis for property taxation
counterbalanced subdued growth from VAT
receipts and lower social-security contributions
following a rate cut of 5 pps., which took effect on
1 October 2014. On the expenditure side, EU funds
absorption and domestic capital expenditure have
been significantly below expectations, but should
pick up in the last quarter of the year.
For 2015, Romania's deficit is projected to
increase to 2.8% of GDP under a no-policy-change
assumption. No draft for the 2015 budget has been
brought forward by the cut-off date of this
forecast. The forecast includes the full-year impact
of the cut in social-security contributions that
should lead to net loss of revenue of around 0.8%
of GDP over the course of 2015. A reduction in the
rate of the property tax on special constructions by
0.5 pp is expected to lead to a further loss in

terms, the deficit is forecast to deteriorate from
1Â¾% of GDP in 2014 to about 2Â½% of GDP in
2015-16. Government debt should increase from
37.9% of GDP in 2013 to 41.1% in 2015.

24. SLOVENIA
Recovery gathers pace fuelled by exports and investment
The Slovenian economy exited recession in 2013, paving the way for an expected GDP growth of 2.4%
in 2014 before moderating to 1.7% in 2015. Growth has become broad based, driven by net exports and
exceptionally strong infrastructure investment. Bank recapitalisations continue to weigh on the general
government budget in 2014 but this is expected to decline over the forecast horizon. Public debt is
expected to peak at 82.9% of GDP in 2015 before embarking on a downward path.
Quarterly growth gathering momentum

After exiting recession in 2013, the Slovenian
economy grew by 2.5% y-o-y in the first half of
2014. Growth has become more broad-based, with
improvements on both the external and domestic
sides. Slovenia has been increasing its export
market shares, particularly for goods, since 2013
and net exports have remained the largest
contributor to economic growth in the first half of
this year. Investment was another significant
contributor to growth, driven by EU-funded
infrastructure projects, while investment in
equipment fell further. For the first time since
2010, household consumption has ceased declining
and is now essentially flat.
Solid growth ahead with some deceleration in
2015

Real GDP is forecast to grow by a robust 2.4% in
2014 as a whole on the back of further
improvements in exports and investment. Yet the
growth rate is expected to decelerate to 1.7% in
2015, mainly because of a slowdown in growth of
EU-funded infrastructure investment. Capacity
utilisation above its historical average and
increased profitability are expected to boost private
investment from the end of 2014 onwards and
contribute to a renewed acceleration in GDP
growth to 2.5% in 2016.
The ongoing deleveraging process is expected to
continue hampering domestic demand, but less
strongly than in previous years. While credit to
households is expected to resume modest growth,
corporates will continue to deleverage, although at
a much slower pace than in previous years. Import
growth is projected to closely follow export
dynamics due to the high import content of
exports. However, as the recovery in domestic
demand picks up towards the end of the forecast
horizon, import growth is expected to gather pace.
As a result, after increasing further this year,
Sloveniaâs current-account surplus is expected to

104

decrease marginally over 2015 and 2016 also
because of deteriorating terms of trade.

Downside risks to the growth outlook are lower
growth in public investment expenditure than
anticipated and the external environment. In
particular, exports in 2015 and 2016 could suffer
from weakening activity in some of Sloveniaâs
main export partners in the Balkans and
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
Upside risks include a further depreciation of the
euro, which would boost Sloveniaâs exports.
Stable labour market and low inflation

Unemployment peaked at 10.2% in February 2014
and is expected to continue declining over the
forecast horizon. Private sector wages are expected
to continue rising moderately but the continued
containment of public sector wages in 2014 and
2015 will help restrain overall wage dynamics.
This, combined with a recovery in productivity this
year, implies that overall unit labour costs are set
to fall by 1.2% in 2014 and then remain stable,
supporting external competitiveness.

Member States, Slovenia

Given the downward trend in prices for raw
materials and energy, HICP inflation is forecast to
decline to historically low levels in 2014 and to
increase only marginally in 2015 and 2016, mainly
on the back of slowly rising oil prices and the
expected recovery of domestic demand.

sector pay bill. These measures have been reflected
in the forecast. The deadline for the
recapitalisation of Gorenjska Banka was extended
until end-2014 and the state may have to provide
capital if private sources cannot be found. In July
2014, the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg ruled that Slovenia has to repay deposit
holders of Ljubljanska Banka within one year of
the ruling. The potential fiscal impact on the
general government deficit of the two issues above
is unclear and not incorporated in the forecast.

Fiscal deficit expected to decline

The general government deficit increased to 14.6%
of GDP in 2013, of which 10.1% of GDP was
related to bank recapitalisations. The deficit is
forecast at 4.4% of GDP in 2014, including 0.9%
of GDP for financial support to Abanka and Banka
Celje. Excluding bank recapitalisations, the key
expenditure drivers are a significant increase in
gross fixed capital formation, mainly EU funded
projects and higher interest expenditure, as the
benefits of lower interest rates have been more
than offset by the large increase in debt.

In 2016, under a no-policy-change assumption the
general government deficit is expected to decline
further to 2.7% of GDP. This improvement is
driven by the expected increase in tax receipts due
to the improved economic environment.
In structural terms, the fiscal position is forecast to
deteriorate by 0.7 pp. in 2014 before improving by
0.3 pp. in 2015. In 2016, the structural balance is
expected to deteriorate by 0.6pp. General
government debt is projected to peak in 2015 at
82.9% before declining to below 81% in 2016 due
to an expected reduction in precautionary cash
balances and a modest primary surplus.

For 2015, the general government deficit is
forecast to stand at 2.9% of GDP. The government
has targeted significant expenditure savings,
mainly through the reform of subsidies and the
prolongation of measures to reduce the public

25. SLOVAKIA
Domestic demand taking the lead
After a slowdown in 2013, Slovakia's economy has gathered pace, driven by a recovery in consumption
and investment. This strength in domestic demand should support real GDP growth, gradually
decreasing unemployment. Inflation, which abated markedly in 2014, is expected to rise slowly over the
forecast horizon. Following the significant achievements of recent years, fiscal consolidation is expected
to resume in 2015 after a temporary expansion in 2014.
Growth improves in 2014â¦

After a slowdown in 2013 due to stagnating
domestic demand and a deceleration of exports,
Slovakia's economy picked up in the first half of
2014 on the back of rising consumption and
investment. Growth is projected to continue at a
similar pace for the rest of the year, with real GDP
expanding by 2.4% in 2014 as a whole. The
growth rate is forecast to slightly increase to 2.5%
in 2015 and to rise to 3.3% in 2016. Domestic
demand has become the main contributor to
growth in 2014 and is expected to keep driving the
economy over the forecast horizon. Linked to
increased economic activity, the labour market
also registered a turnaround in recent quarters.

Gross fixed capital formation grew strongly in the
first half of 2014, mainly due to the expansion of
equipment investment. In the second quarter of the
year, however, investment in residential and nonresidential construction also showed strong
growth, suggesting a broader recovery is
underway. Overall, gross fixed capital formation is
projected to increase by 4.1% and further growth is
expected in 2015 and 2016. In particular,
investment in residential construction is likely to
rise given improving business sentiment in the
construction sector and increasing demand for
housing loans.
Exports, by contrast, dropped sharply in the second
quarter of 2014, mainly because of slow GDP
growth in Slovakia's main trading partners.
Exports are still expected to increase for the year
as a whole, albeit at a slower pace compared to
previous years. In 2014, imports are projected to
grow faster than exports due to the strong recovery
in private consumption. In the following years,
however, imports are projected to grow more in
line with exports, reflecting the high import
intensity of Slovakia's exports.

â¦driven by a recovery in domestic demand.

After three consecutive years of decline, private
consumption, which rebounded strongly in the first
two quarters of 2014 thanks to growing real
disposable income and an amelioration of
consumer confidence, is expected to increase by
2.8% over the year as a whole. Household
consumption is projected to further increase in
2015 and 2016, reflecting a gradual improvement
in labour market conditions.

106

While unemployment in Slovakia remains at
elevated levels, the first half of 2014 saw a steady
fall in the unemployment rate. Over the forecast
horizon, labour market conditions are expected to
improve gradually as the economy recovers. The
unemployment rate is projected to be 13.4% in
2014 and to then fall to 12.8% in 2015 and to
12.1% in 2016.
Inflation set to rise slowly

Inflation dropped markedly in 2014, driven mainly
by falling energy and industrial goods prices.
Import prices have decreased continuously since
the third quarter of 2013, exerting downward
pressure on inflation. HICP inflation is forecast to
be -0.1% this year and to slowly rise to 0.7% in
2015 and to 1.4% in 2016.

Member States, Slovakia

Fiscal improvement slows down despite strong
growth in tax revenues

The general government deficit for 2013 was
revised downwards by 0.2 pps. to 2.6% of GDP.
The fiscal balance in 2014 is expected to worsen to
3% of GDP despite much stronger-than-budgeted
growth in tax revenue, the freeze of state budget
expenditures since May due to the activation of the
first stage of the national debt brake and lower cofinancing of investment financed through EU
funds. Factors such as lower-than-budgeted
revenue from dividends, higher health-care
expenditure and higher spending of local
governments and universities will increase the
deficit. Uncertainties that could negatively affect
the final deficit outcome stem principally from the
statistical treatment of proceeds from the sale of
mobile phone frequency licences and the
application of financial corrections related to the
projects financed with EU funds.
The deficit is projected to decline to 2.6% of GDP
in 2015, on the back of tax-rich growth as well as
measures such as changes to depreciation rules,
new legislation to limit transfer pricing practices

and extending compulsory use of cash registers.
The impact of these measures is, however, partly
off-set by other deficit-increasing measures, such
as the introduction of partial tax-deductibility of
R&D expenditure, the reduction of the tax wedge
for low-paid workers, and expected increases in
teachers' salaries. Due to the revision of the 2013
general government debt-to-GDP ratio, the second
stage of the national debt brake (pertaining to
2015) is no longer expected to apply and hence
savings on government expenditure in the 2015-17
draft budget are only partially taken into account in
the forecast. Assuming no further changes in
government policies, in 2016 the deficit is forecast
to decline further to 2.3% of GDP on the back of
an improving economic situation.
After deteriorating in 2014, the structural balance
is set to improve again in 2015 and 2016.
Assuming substantial drawdowns of the cash
reserves in 2014 and use of the expected
privatisation proceeds for debt reduction in 2015,
the general government debt is projected to be
54.1% of GDP in 2014 and remain below 55% of
GDP in the final two years of the forecast.

Domestic factors restraining growth
Economic activity in Finland is set to contract for the third year in a row this year and resume to only
modest growth in 2015. Partly as a consequence, public finances remain under pressure. While the
nominal deficit is projected to decline, the structural deficit will remain elevated.
Economic recovery postponed

Finland has been in recession since 2012 and real
GDP is now expected to contract again this year by
0.4% as negative risks related to geopolitical
tensions have materialised and economic activity
in the main trading partners is falling short of
expectations. The Finnish economy is expected to
gradually benefit from the tepid economic
recovery in the EU and increasing activity in the
rest of the world in 2015-16. Domestic demand, by
contrast, will make only a weak contribution to
growth, especially as households' real disposable
income growth remains subdued. In addition,
growth is expected to remain weak due to low
investment, a declining working age population,
and difficulties in translating high R&D
expenditure and good fundamentals into profitable
innovations.

continue to struggle to launch and export
innovative products. With slow domestic demand
growth this year and next, imports are expected to
grow less than exports, resulting in a positive
contribution to growth from net exports. The trade
balance of goods and services is expected to
slowly improve over the forecast horizon. External
developments continue to the most significant risks
for the forecast.

Economic growth disappointed in the first quarter
this year, but economic activity increased in
Finland in the second quarter. Recent data,
including confidence indicators, point to continued
weakness in the second half of 2014. The outlook
appears particularly subdued in domestically
oriented sectors like construction and private
services. The outlook is less negative in
manufacturing, but downsizing of forest and
electronics industries and weak investment in new
production capacity in recent years continue to act
as a drag on growth of value added in
manufacturing.
Net exports to provide support

For 2014, Finnish exports to the EU are forecast to
increase broadly in line with the regionâs mildly
expanding economic activity, while exports to the
rest of the world are expected to fall. The
slowdown of the Russian economy has been
weighing on exports since mid-2013, and the EUâs
sanctions and the import ban of food by Russia are
set to weigh further on Finnish exports. In 2015
and 2016, exports are expected to recover, as
investment and activity increase in the main export
markets. Still, the loss of export market shares is
expected to continue, as Finnish companies

A weak domestic economy

The labour market situation is gradually
worsening. According to the labour force survey,
the trend unemployment rate has increased from
8.4% at the end of 2013 to 8.7% in September
2014. However, the number of registered
unemployed
exceeds
the
survey
based
unemployment measure, confirming that there is a
larger pool of jobless people who want to work but
are not actively seeking a job or are not
immediately available for work. The labour market
is expected to recover in 2015-16, but with a lag
with respect to economic activity due to skills
mismatches and firmsâ efforts to increase
productivity.
Domestic demand is estimated to decrease further
in 2014, but to grow in 2015 and 2016. As wage
growth is set to be moderate over the forecast
horizon, developments in employment will be
crucial for household income generation. Although

Member States, Finland

inflation has slowed down this year and is forecast
to remain low, households' real disposable income
is barely rising this year, and its growth is expected
to accelerate only mildly next year as employment
increases. Therefore, private consumption growth
is set to remain muted in 2015 and 2016.
Households are also expected to remain cautious in
investing in new dwellings. Corporate investment
is being held back by the weak economic outlook
and low capacity utilisation rates. Overall,
financing conditions have remained favourable but
financial market indicators suggest that small
companies are finding it more difficult than their
larger peers.

cancelled or postponed and growth prospects have
deteriorated. In particular, the previously
announced freeze of income tax brackets will be
postponed until 2016, tax deductions have been
offered to families with children, and sugar tax
increases have been reduced. Taking these
developments into account in the forecast, the
2015 deficit is forecast to decline to 2.6% of GDP,
a smaller improvement than estimated in spring. In
2016, based on the no policy change assumption,
the deficit should decline further to 2.3% of GDP.
Over the forecast horizon, public consumption and
investments are expected to increase very
modestly. Public sector revenues from property
income are forecast to grow slowly, weighing
particularly on the revenues of pension funds.

Fiscal situation worsening

General government net borrowing is on a rising
trend. The nominal public deficit in 2013 stood at
2.4% of GDP, and is forecast to increase to 2.9%
of GDP in 2014.

In 2014, the structural deficit is projected to reach
about 1.1% of GDP, worsening by 0.4 pps.
compared to 2013. The structural balance is not
forecast to improve in 2015 and would further
weaken in 2016.

In spring 2014, the government had agreed on

fiscal
consolidation measures for 2015 budget that were
expected to bring down the deficit significantly.

27. SWEDEN
Domestic resilience despite weak foreign demand
Swedenâs GDP is forecast to grow less strongly than previously expected because of weaker global
demand, rising imports and weak manufacturing investment, but should still remain solid, thanks to
strong consumption and construction. Downside risks are increasing and becoming more apparent.
Gradual acceleration of growth ahead

Economic growth is expected to accelerate from
1.5% in 2013 to 2.0% 2014. This year's progress
will likely be weaker than expected as
deteriorating conditions abroad hinder exports and
weigh on investment by businesses. By contrast,
the domestic engines of growth, consumption and
construction are performing strongly and are
expected to sustain growth in the coming years.
Economic sentiment indicators continue to stay at
high levels but have recently levelled off,
indicating a lack of additional impetus that could
substantially boost economic growth in the short
term. As external demand starts to gradually
normalise and increase from next year, Sweden's
GDP growth is expected to further accelerate to
2.4% in 2015 and 2.7% in 2016.

Sweden will increase faster than previously
foreseen mainly due to a large inflow of asylum
seekers. Labour supply continues to increase
swiftly due to demographics and government
policies. Despite fairly strong employment growth
deriving mainly from services and from the public
sector, unemployment will remain sticky around
8%, and will only gradually decline from 2016
onwards, when population growth is projected to
moderate. In the medium term, weak labour
market integration of those without adequate skills
could slow the decline in unemployment.
Rebounding construction investment

Despite declining manufacturing investment,
overall gross fixed capital formation has been
growing so far in 2014 thanks to high public
investments and rebounding construction. Low
capacity utilisation and fragile external
developments will continue to mute manufacturing
investments, while construction is projected to rise
robustly on account of strong fundamentals
(growing population, reinvigorated growth of
house prices and significant housing shortage in
major cities).

Consumption growth remains strong

Similarly to previous years, consumption will
remain the main driver of growth. Household
consumption is projected to remain strong over the
forecast horizon due to low interest rates, steadily
growing disposable incomes and strong
employment growth. Government consumption is
expected to grow at a higher pace than previously
projected due to increased social spending (mainly
related to migration and ageing).
According to the most recent forecast of the
Swedish Statistical Office (SCB), the population of

Weak net exports have been the main drag on
growth in the first half of 2014. While exports
grew at a rate of 2.2%, import growth accelerated
to 3.7% as robust consumption translated into
strong imports of durable consumer goods. In 2015
and 2016, the difference between export and
import growth is likely to decline as external
demand picks up. Nevertheless, net trade is
expected to continue to detract from GDP growth
in the coming years.
More apparent negative risks

Risks have been multiplying and have become
more apparent primarily on the negative side.
Domestically, an abrupt correction of high and
rising house prices could dampen household
consumption. Households could reduce their
consumption spending if disposable income turns

out weaker. From the external side, the
deteriorating economic outlook for the euro area
countries and further escalation of the Ukrainian
crisis could further negatively impact business
confidence in Sweden and its main trading
partners.

related to sick leave and to migration increased
more than expected notably due to a rise in asylum
seekers. Furthermore, the transition to ESA2010
has increased slightly the level of net borrowing
this year.
Following the general elections in September
2014, the new government will present the budget
for 2015 later than usual in the year. Under the
customary no-policy-change assumption, stronger
economic growth is projected to be sufficient to
reduce the budget deficit to 1.8% in 2015 and to
1.2% in 2016.

Moderate increase of inflation

Due to declining inflation expectations, the
Riksbank cut its repo rate further than expected,
from 0.75% to 0.25% in July 2014. This has also
prompted a fall of the SEK against the main
currencies. HICP inflation is expected to increase
moderately next year from 0.2% in 2014 to 1.2%
in 2015, helped by a weaker currency and tax
increases, as well as expectations about higher
mortgage interest rates. It is then expected to
accelerate only slightly to 1.5% in 2016.

As the 2014 budget was expansionary, using the
fiscal space available to boost the economic
recovery, the structural deficit will reach 1.5% of
GDP in 2014 but is projected to decrease from
2015.
The level of general government debt in 2013 has
decreased from 40.6% to 38.6% of GDP with the
transition to ESA2010. General government debt is
expected to peak in 2014 at a level of 40.3% of
GDP, and to decrease from 2015 onwards as
economic growth picks up.

Deteriorating public finances

The general government deficit is forecast to
deteriorate to 2.4% in 2014 from a deficit of 1.3%
in 2013. This is due on the revenue side to weaker
capital tax revenues and lower dividends from
state owned companies in 2014. Expenditures

28. THE UNITED KINGDOM
Robust growth and low inflation projected to continue
The strong growth enjoyed in the first half of 2014 is expected to continue, driven by private
consumption and investment, although net exports are projected to detract from growth. Unemployment
is expected to continue to fall while inflation is projected to remain below 2%. The budget deficit is
forecast to decline to 3.4% of GDP by 2016 and the government debt to GDP ratio is expected to
continue to edge up.
Brisk growth in the first half of 2014

Growth has been buoyant so far in 2014, at 0.7%
and 0.9% in Q1 and Q2, respectively, taking
growth from 1.7% in 2013 to 3.2% in the year to
Q2 2014. Growth was driven by domestic demand
with both household consumption and gross fixed
capital formation contributing strongly. The
notable contribution to growth of gross fixed
capital formation indicates a continuation of the
broadening of growth to the business sector. Net
exports also contributed to growth.

Momentum expected to continue

Indicators of activity published recently, for
example, PMIs and other indicators of output by
sector, suggest that growth will continue in the
second half of 2014 at similar rates to those in the
first half of the year. Momentum is expected to
continue in 2015 and 2016 with growth projected
at 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively.
Private consumption to underpin growth

Robust private consumption is expected to remain
the main contributor to growth, supported by rising
disposable income, positive consumer sentiment,
and moderate household saving. Although
compensation of employees per head is set to rise
only modestly, further employment growth should

112

continue to boost aggregate disposable income.
However, continued subdued wages growth and/or
a desire by households to increase savings further
than projected are downward risks to this outlook.
Private consumption is projected to increase by
around 2% in each of the forecast years.
Gross fixed capital formation to boost growth

Growth in gross fixed capital formation is
projected to pick up firmly from 3.2% in 2013 to
between 7% and 10% per year between 2014 and
2016. Robust growth in investment is supported by
low borrowing costs, easing credit supply, strong
demand, lower uncertainty and strong corporate
balance sheets. Such factors are expected to
continue over the forecast period as investment
responds to the acceleration in demand. Investment
in the construction sector is also expected to be
strong, reflecting rises in the supply of new houses
and improvements to the quality of existing homes.
Net exports remain subdued

Net exports are expected to be a headwind to
growth. Although export growth is expected to
increase, the appreciation of sterling since early
2013, and the euro areaâs continued relative
weakness, may dampen export growth. Imports
unexpectedly fell in H1 2014 but are expected to
pick up in response to strong domestic demand. As
a result, net exports are projected to detract from
growth over the forecast horizon.
Labour market resilience continues

The labour market is set to continue to perform
strongly as both labour supply and labour demand
continue to rise while wages remain modest. The
reduction in the unemployment rate, which is
expected to fall to 6.2% in 2014, is expected to
continue although at a slower pace. An increase in
employee compensation is projected as the labour
market tightens, while growth in unit labour costs
remains low. Labour productivity is forecast to rise
modestly but to remain below its peak in 2008.

Member States, The United Kingdom

Although less pronounced than in the spring
forecast, the âpuzzleâ of continued low
productivity in the face of a strong upswing in
GDP remains.
Inflation below target

Inflation has been low in 2014 so far, rising by
1.2% in the year to September. Inflation is
expected to remain subdued as a result of modest
wage growth, the appreciation of sterling, falling
energy prices and pressure on retailersâ margins,
particularly in the supermarket sector. As a result,
inflation is projected to rise only gently from 1.5%
in 2014 to 1.9% in 2016 and remain below the
Bank of Englandâs target of 2%.
Consolidation proceeding

Revisions as part of the implementation of ESA10
affect the historical profile of the fiscal aggregates
with the largest changes in the 2012-13 deficit
relating to the treatment of the Royal Mail pension
fund transfer, 3G and 4G spectrum receipts, and
the inclusion of Network Rail inside the general
government sector, along with methodological
improvements from the UK statistical office.

The governmentâs fiscal consolidation programme
remains in place. However, tax receipts in 2014
have been weaker than expected possibly due to
low wage growth, increased employment in
relatively lower paid jobs and self-employment, or
potentially a timing issue relating to the reduction
in the top rate of personal income tax in 2013.
The general government deficit is forecast at 5.2%
of GDP in 2014-15, falling to 4.2% of GDP in
2015-16 and 3.2% of GDP in 2016-17. This is
based on a no-policy change assumption and
reflects tax revenues that are forecast to increase
from their current levels and a continuation of
public spending restraint. This implies a structural
adjustment of 1.4% of GDP between 2014-15 and
2016-17. The general government debt ratio has
been revised downward; however, it is expected to
continue to increase to 88.7% by 2016-17.

29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Broader-based acceleration of growth
The economic recovery is progressing, driven by a further strengthening of domestic demand, in
particular public and foreign direct investment, and a dynamic export activity. Private consumption is
expected to remain resilient, bolstered by further gradual employment gains. Given limited efforts in
fiscal consolidation, and large financing needs of public infrastructure projects, public debt is likely to
increase further.
Domestic demand strengthens in the first halfâ¦

In the first half of 2014, real GDP increased by
some 3.9% y-o-y, after (revised) 2.7% annual
growth in 2013. Growth drivers shifted decisively
from the external sector to domestic demand. After
a disappointing performance in 2013, investment
activity rebounded in the first quarter, spurred by
public infrastructure expenditure and by the
establishment of new foreign companies.
However, it was almost flat in the second quarter,
and construction activity, after a buoyant first
quarter, stagnated, far from attaining the 32%
annual growth rate of 2013. Manufacturing output,
driven by the food and clothing industry, and by
new investments in the motor vehicles industry,
proved resilient, rising by 4.3% y-o-y in the first
eight months. Net exports contributed negatively
to growth, with import volumes, largely
investment-related, rising by 8.1%, outbalancing
the impressive 13.3% rise in exports.

posted further marginal declines, driven by both, a
reduction in the number of unemployed and an
increase in the labour force, the rate for young
workers rose further in the first half of 2014.
Employment in manufacturing, which accounts for
about one fifth of the total, remained robust in the
first half of the year, bolstering job creation in
industry which attained some 7% y-o-y.

forecast

Looking forward, domestic demand is likely to
strengthen further, and become the sole contributor
to the economy's growth. Household consumption
is supported by the continued benign inflationary
environment -lower prices for food and imported
commodities contributed to the economy's drift
into deflation in the first half of 2014. As of spring,
price dynamics, and an increase in nominal wages,
have been lifting real net wages. Rises in public
wages and pensions, the expected acceleration in
employment growth, the robust remittances from
abroad, and further strong public capital spending
will bolster private consumption and investment,
aided by further strengthening credit growth.
Structural challenges impede job creation

The labour market situation remains tense, as
structural problems, such as deficiencies in the
education and training system, hamper the positive
transmission of the cyclical upswing on
employment. While the overall unemployment rate

Real GDP

Over the forecast period, further employment gains
are expected, stemming from the strong investment
dynamics, and from the start, or extension of
production by a number of foreign firms, with
labour cost increasing only moderately.
External imbalances remain containedâ¦

Supported by a narrowing merchandise trade
deficit, and strong inflows of private transfers, the
current account balance improved. In the four
quarters to June, it stood at 1.5% of GDP,
compared to 1.8%, on average, in 2013. Spurred
by a 5mn Eurobond issue in July, foreign reserves
have increased sharply. At the same time, this
operation also raised the level of public sector
external debt, by some 32% compared to the end
of 2013, bringing overall gross external debt up by
5pp to 68% of GDP. This will be slightly reversed
in the coming years as the government redeems a
previous Eurobond as well as IMF loans.

â¦but imports will prove a drag on growth.

â¦and debt levels are likely to increase further.

Looking ahead, import growth is set to accelerate
significantly in 2014, on account of investmentrelated needs stemming from public infrastructure
projects and from new foreign direct investment.
In the following two years, the dynamic export
activity is expected to progressively outpace
import growth, as new foreign companies start
production, and the negative contribution of net
exports to GDP growth would level off.

Driven by the primary deficits, general
government debt, which stood at 34% of GDP at
the end of 2013, is projected to rise further by
some 7pp over the horizon. This increase is likely
to be outpaced by the rise of overall public debt,
given the financing needs for public infrastructure
projects which are largely operated by state-owned
enterprises. While these investments are likely to
raise growth potential, their financing via stateguaranteed loans entails fiscal risks due to the
related rise in government contingent liabilities.

Fiscal consolidation stands on shaky groundâ¦

Front-loaded, pre-election transfer and subsidy
payments weighed heavily on public expenditure
during the first half of 2014. Tax revenue remained
below the level of the previous year. The
government subsequently raised the general
government deficit target by 4pp to 3.8% of GDP,
complicating compliance with the medium-term
fiscal strategy, which foresees expenditure-based
consolidation to lower the deficit to 2.6% by 2016.
In the absence of concrete consolidation measures,
and given further projected rises in entitlement and
public infrastructure spending, as well as uncertain
revenue prospects, deficit reductions over the
forecast horizon are likely to remain modest.

Resilient growth, driven by tourism, investment and private
consumption
Economic activity is expected to increase by 2Â¼% in 2014 and to accelerate further to around 2Â¾% and
2Â½% in 2015 and 2016, supported by tourism, private investment, strengthened disposable income, and
pent up private consumption. However, strong domestic demand could lead to widening external
imbalances, creating pressure on the exchange rate and domestic price stability.
Resilient growth, in particular in the second
quarter of 2014

Year-on-year output growth was 0.4% in the first
half of the year, reflecting a drop by 1.3% in the
first quarter and an increase by 2.4% in the second
quarter. The main reason for the weak performance
in the first quarter had been high imports, driven
by equipment investment and private consumption,
but also a reduction in inventory. In the second
quarter, private consumption and exports rose
year-on-year by 4.2% and 3.4% respectively, while
imports rose by 7.2%. Overall, private
consumption and tourism have been the main
drivers of growth. The former benefits from low
inflation, supporting real wage growth and the
government's household debt relief programme.
The rather weak growth of commodity exports is
more than offset by strong service exports, in
particular tourism, registering record high inflows.

tourism sector. However, higher imports due to
stronger domestic demand will largely offset the
positive effects of higher tourism revenues.

The labour market situation is likely to maintain
its positive trend

The labour market situation continued to improve,
with employment increasing by some 2%.
However, job creation took mainly place in lowskilled and low wage sectors, partly reflecting the
expansion of tourism. In June, the seasonally-notadjusted unemployment rate had declined to 3.1%,
compared to 4% a year before.

Thanks to strong growth and new employment
opportunities in tourism and construction, labour
market conditions are expected to improve further.
Annual average unemployment thus could drop
below 4Â½% by 2016. However, most new jobs are
likely to be in lower wage segments. Addressing
long-term unemployment will remain an important
challenge.

In 2015-16, domestic demand will be the main
driver of growth

The recent moderate wage agreements, declining
import prices, in particular lower oil prices and a
strengthening exchange rate have helped to contain
inflationary pressures, declining from 5.2% in
2012 to 3.9% in 2013. In 2014, inflation is likely
to be slightly below the Central Bank's target of
2.5%. However, the strong growth could lead to a
rise in inflation to around 3% by 2016.

Key
determinants
for
Iceland's
growth
performance in 2015-16 will be tourism, private
investment as well as private consumption,
benefitting from lower inflation and government
measures to boost disposable income, such as the
announced household debt relief programme,
which is planned to be implemented over a 4 year
period. Some long-planned private investment
projects in the energy and maritime sectors and
additional, largely tourism-related construction
could further boost domestic demand. However,
the existence of capital controls is likely to impede
Iceland's attractiveness for incoming FDI. Total
exports are projected to benefit from a flourishing

Strong domestic demand will lead to a
widening of external imbalances

As a result of stronger domestic demand, the
surplus in trade in goods will turn into a deficit
during the forecast period, while the services
balance is expected to continue benefitting further

from expanding tourism. Overall, the current
account is likely to deteriorate over the forecast
period, which could create pressure on the
exchange rate and price stability.

The general government deficit dropped from
3.7% of GDP in 2012 to 1.7% in 2013. During the
first half of 2014, a one-off dividend payment of a
state-owned bank and strong performance of direct
taxes resulted in a general government surplus of
1.2% of the estimated end-year GDP. For the
whole year, the forecast expects a surplus of about
1Â½% of GDP. The government's fiscal target for
2015 of a balanced budget is well in line with the
underlying economic growth projection. However,
plans to lower direct taxes might result in a slight
deterioration in the fiscal balance in 2016, towards
âÂ¼% of GDP. Substantial primary surpluses (of
more than 4% of GDP) will help to reduce the
general government debt-to-GDP ratio well below
80% by 2016. Government plans to sell state assets
in order to lower the public debt burden could lead
to a faster than projected reduction in the debt
ratio.

could create additional pressure on external
accounts, the exchange rate and domestic price

A delayed investment agenda
Growth decelerated markedly in the first half of 2014, reflecting a sharp decline of exports but also the
adjournment of some key major investment projects. Driven by domestic demand, economic activity is
expected to regain some strength as of 2015, while budget performance, already better than planned,
would further improve.
Growth deceleration after the recovery

GDP growth slowed markedly from 1.5% y-o-y in
the first quarter to 0.3% in the second.
Construction, retail and real estate sectors
contributed positively to GDP growth in the first
half of the year. However, industrial production
contracted sharply in the second quarter, reflecting
to a large extent high base effect in utilities output.

Some growth of industrial production is expected
in the last quarter of 2014 following the renovation
of a steel factory and higher aluminium prices in
US dollars, the restart of construction after the
summer break as well as some growth in the
number of tourism in the late season. Yet, all these
factors might prove insufficient to offset the weak
performance of economic activity recorded in the
second quarter. As a result, annual average growth
for 2014 is unlikely to reach more than 2%. For the
outer years, an acceleration of growth is projected,
driven by domestic demand.
Credit constraints persist

So far, credit activity remains constrained by tight
credit conditions and high risk premia, stirred
up -among others- by the high level of nonperforming loans. A continuation of sluggish credit
growth is foreseen in the coming years too. Yet,
while deleveraging of domestic companies

continues, households' credit growth remains in
positive territory, providing some support to the
recovery of private consumption.
Adjourned investments to materialise later

The 2014 forecast has been revised downwards
following delays âby one year at leastâ in the
construction of the highway, of the thermal plant
and of some large tourist resorts. Some minor
preparatory works on the highway could start soon,
but not to gain momentum before mid-2015. The
new power plants projects are on hold waiting the
conclusion of a new partnership agreement
between the majority owners of the electric power
company. Two large tourism resorts (Lustica and
Plavi Horizon) could resume their development in
2015. The renovated steel mill is expected to
restart by end of 2014 and to increase production
gradually in the next two years, while the situation
of the aluminium factory KAP remains uncertain,
with some production likely to be maintained.
Labour market dynamics are likely to improve

The labour market is likely to benefit from the
announced investment projects. However, it is still
difficult to accurately assess the full impact from
the increased labour demand. Demand would be
met by a mix of foreign workers and local ones,
including some unemployed workers registered in
the employment agency. While weak labour
market dynamics resulted in a decline of wages,
some pay increases may be expected as a result of
higher labour demand in 2015 and 2016, as well as
growing pressure from public sector trade unions.
Inflation will remain on the low side

In the first eight months of 2014, the price level
continued to be lower than a year before.
Moreover, the annual review of electricity prices
this summer had but a minor impact on consumer
prices. However, a gradual recovery of domestic
demand could bring inflation to some 2% by the
end of 2016.

119

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

Risks to the external position

Tightening fiscal policy

In 2013, the current-account deficit narrowed
markedly thanks to a decline in imports. However,
exports are expected to decrease in 2014, partly
due to a base-effect from electricity trade, partly as
the expansionary dynamics of tourism revenues is
likely to lose momentum. Over the forecast
horizon, once the construction of the highway and
other investments go into full swing, imports of
construction material as well as related services are
expected to rise, and net factor income to decline
as the share of the foreign workforce grows.
Consequently, the current-account deficit âlargely
financed by net FDI inflows and other investments
like foreign loansâ could widen again.
Geopolitical risks could also impact both the
external position and growth. So far, the tensions
over the situation in Ukraine have had no
significant impact on the economy. The number of
Russian tourists increased further in 2014, while
investment (particularly in real estate) remained
stable. However, a prolongation could have
important effects on the Montenegrin economy.

In the first eight months of 2014, the central
government budget deficit declined to 0.9% of
GDP, down from 3.9% a year ago. The improved
budget performance resulted from higher revenues
in taxes and social security contributions, but also
from considerably lower than planned capital
spending due to the postponement of the highway
construction. Furthermore, the disbursement of due
state guarantees declined markedly to EUR
10 million in the first eight months of 2014,
compared to EUR 103 million in the same period
in a year earlier. Budget performance is projected
to further improve over the forecast horizon since
the implementation of new fiscal rules as of the
2015 budget should help to refrain fiscal slippages
and the current "crisis" rates for VAT and personal
income tax are assumed to remain in place. In June
2014, the public debt reached 57.5% of GDP, and
it could increase close to 60% of GDP âthe new
fiscal rules limitâ by the end of 2016, when public
borrowing for the construction of the highway
gains momentum. However, a close to balanced
budget should reduce additional borrowing needs
for deficit financing.

Fiscal hurdles
Impacted by heavy floods, the economy is likely to have entered into another recession in 2014. It is
expected to recover only slowly as exports, the main driver of growth, are losing steam and confidence
is still hampered by uncertainty regarding the scope and pace of structural reforms and fiscal
consolidation efforts. Rising government indebtedness is set to remain a major policy challenge.
Floods have seriously undermined growth
prospect in 2014, leading to another recession

Impacted by heavy floods in the spring, the
economy is likely to have entered into a recession.
Real GDP fell by 1.1% y-o-y in the second quarter,
following stagnation in the first. High-frequency
indicators point at a continuing worsening of
economic activity in the summer. Industrial
activity, especially in sectors heavily damaged by
the floods, as mining and energy, strongly
deteriorated. Industrial production fell by an
average of 11.8% y-o-y over the months of JuneAugust. Manufacturing dropped as well, led by a
steep decline in the production of motor vehicles.
Exports performance worsened as well. After a
very strong growth last year, exports deteriorated
rapidly and even fell in euro terms in July and
August. Although part of their drop was due to
floods-related disruptions, a weaker than expected
external environment has also sapped their
strength.

announced that could support investment, should
they materialise.
Despite some improvements in labour market
indicators in the first half of 2014, legal
employment gains remained limited due to weak
economic performance. The expected restructuring
of state-owned enterprises and the continuation of
a partial government employment freeze are likely
to unwind some of the recent labour market
improvements in the next two years and
unemployment is set to remain very high.

A protracted recovery

The potential for strong export growth seems
largely exhausted and the envisaged rebound in
investments, which has failed to materialise this
year, will most likely be slower and less vigorous
than previously expected. Coupled with plans to
reduce public spending and generally weak labour
market prospects, the economic recovery is
expected to be protracted. In addition, effects from
the floods are likely to spill over in 2015, further
undermining economic activity.
The recently announced cuts in pensions and
public sector wages would constrain both private
and public consumption growth rates, which are
foreseen to remain negative throughout the
forecast horizon. A high level of non-performing
loans, tight lending conditions and limited credit
demand are likely to lead to a largely credit-less
and slow pick-up in investment activity. On the
upside, however, several big infrastructure projects
in the transport and energy sectors have been

Uncertainty still prevailing

The forecast scenario is subject to a number of
uncertainties, among which the pace of
implementation of the domestic reform agenda,
including the completion of restructuring of
state-owned enterprises and advancing the
announced public administration reform, and fiscal
consolidation efforts remain key. In addition, the
unstable external environment represents a clear
risk to the overall growth scenario and to exports
and investments' performance, in particular.
Inflation is expected to be more subdued and stable
than in recent years as weak domestic demand is
projected to remain a major disinflationary factor.
However, inflation remains inherently volatile and
inflationary pressures could easily re-emerge,

General government balance (lhs)

After years of partial consolidation efforts and
high budget deficits, the growing government
indebtedness is set to remain a key policy
challenge, as debt is seen approaching 80% of
GDP by the end of the forecast horizon (the ratio
would have been even higher if not for the recently
revised national account data, which lead to an
increase of the 2013 nominal GDP by 8.2%). The
expenditure reductions in the context of the
announced 2014 budget rebalancing, which is

likely to include limited pension and wage cuts,
are expected to be insufficient to stabilise
government debt and the budget deficit is
projected to stay very high. The underlying budget
deficit would be even higher, as significant
expenditure, like those related to the servicing of
called guarantees, is still recorded below the line.
While there is still no clarity on the outline of the
2015 budget and the medium-term fiscal strategy,
expenditure pressures are foreseen to remain
elevated due to growing interest payments but also
due to short-term commitments related to the
restructuring of state-owned enterprises, like
severance payments, unemployment benefits and
the assumption by the state of some of the
companies'
obligations.
Completing
the
restructuring process by the end of 2015, as
envisaged, improving the performance of large
state-owned companies, and taking steps to reform
the public administration are seen as key tests of
authorities' commitment to improve the efficiency
of the public sector and to reduce expenditure in a
sustainable way, even if these reforms are expected
to bring their full effect only in the medium-term.

33. TURKEY
Geopolitical tensions a risk to growth
After a strong first quarter, economic activity has decelerated sharply. Stagnating export markets and
armed conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq have put a damper on Turkey's economy while real
appreciation has lowered its international competitiveness again. Underlying conditions suggest that
growth will return to potential relatively slowly over the forecast period. Both inflation and the current
account deficit will remain elevated although lower energy prices will lead to some correction.
Slowdown in the second quarter of 2014

The Turkish economy expanded at a surprisingly
fast rate at the beginning of the year, but slowed
down sharply in the second quarter. GDP
contracted on a quarter-on-quarter basis and the
year-on-year growth rate fell to 2.1% from 4.7% in
the first quarter. Private domestic demand had
already started to decline in the first quarter
following the tightening of financial conditions
and macro-prudential measures to rein in consumer
borrowing. This was compounded by a
retrenchment in public spending in the second
quarter from a previous expansion. At the same
time, exports turned from strong growth to mild
contraction, reflecting some weakening of demand
in major export markets and the civil war in Iraq.
Imports, too, exerted a drag on GDP growth by
shifting from decline in the first quarter to
expansion in the second. Monthly data suggest that
economic activity has remained sluggish in the
third quarter.

Another switch in monetary policy

When Turkey's financial markets and the lira were
under strong downward pressure in January 2014,
the central bank raised the overnight lending rate
from 7.75% to 12% and hiked the one-week repo
rate from 4.5% to 10%. It also declared that

monetary policy would be kept tight until there
was a significant improvement in the inflation
outlook. In the spring, when the downward
pressure on the currency subsided and the risk
premium on Turkish assets fell, the central bank
eased monetary policy again in spite of headline
inflation rising above 9%. The one-week repo rate
was cut by a combined 175 basis points between
May and July and the overnight lending rate by 75
basis points in August. Subsequently, real interest
rates are close to zero.
Rebalancing towards external demand proves
short-lived

The lira's depreciation had improved the
international price competitiveness of Turkish
goods and services up to January. Over the
following eight months, however, the Turkish lira
appreciated by 7.5% in real effective terms,
reversing last winter's gains in international
competitiveness and lowering the outlook for
export growth. While the projected contribution
from net exports to GDP growth will remain strong
for the current year, it has been reduced
significantly for 2015 compared to the spring
forecast.
On the domestic side, private consumption is
projected to recover slowly, but gradually, from
the contraction in the first half of 2014. Consumer
loan growth has declined to a level well below its
average of recent years, but should benefit from
the recent easing of monetary policy. Although
real wages continue to increase, employment
growth has weakened since the spring and
consumer confidence has declined. Business fixed
investment has been very weak for some time
although commercial loan growth has remained
relatively robust. Considering the prospects for
consumer and export demand, favourable
financing conditions and a PMI reading just above
50, it is projected that gross fixed capital formation
will be on a moderate growth path over the
forecast period.

123

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

Slowly rising growth coupled with slightly lower
inflation

In 2014, Turkey's economy is projected to grow
2.8%, but this is almost exclusively because of the
strong first quarter. Growth in the second half of
the year is expected to be very modest. It is worth
noting that annual growth is reduced significantly
by inventory adjustments. In 2015, growth is
expected to increase to 3.3% as domestic demand
recovers gradually. This trend is expected to
continue in 2016 with growth reaching potential.
One downside risk to this forecast is the possibility
of a renewed sell-off in Turkish financial assets as
US monetary policy normalises. Another risk is the
chaotic situation in neighbouring Iraq and Syria
with a possible spill-over to Turkey itself.
Employment growth is expected to run just below
GDP growth, reflecting a reduced trend growth
rate for labour productivity. Given the strong
structural increase of the labour force, annual
average unemployment is projected to rise above
10% of the labour force aged 15-64 years.
Headline inflation will fall from the current level
of 9% as a consequence of lower energy prices.
Inflation is, however, projected to remain above
the central bank's 5%-target considering the

current monetary policy stance and entrenched
expectations that inflation will run above target.
The external deficit is narrowing significantly in
2014 which, to a large extent, is the result of a
normalisation of Turkey's foreign trade in gold,
particularly lower imports of non-monetary gold.
Lower prices for imported oil and gas will reduce
the deficit further in the following two years.
Public finances remain stable

The fiscal deficit of general government was held
in check in 2013 by surging revenues which were
partly the result of earlier changes to indirect
taxation and the social security system. The
forecast projects that the deficit will widen in 2014
due to much slower revenue growth. Some
narrowing of the deficit is expected over the next
two years when economic activity and revenue
growth pick up again. Regarding public debt, last
year's lira depreciation increased the book value of
foreign currency debt and halted a downward trend
in the debt-to-GDP ratio. On the basis of the
current projections for fiscal deficit and GDP, the
debt ratio will resume the previous trend.

Domestic demand to support gradual growth revival
The deceleration of growth seen over the last three years is expected to give way to a gradual
strengthening of economic activity. A pick-up in bank lending, an ambitious public arrears clearance
programme and planned large FDI projects are forecast to support investment. Private consumption is
also expected to grow amid slightly declining unemployment. On the other hand, fiscal consolidation
needs and an expected reacceleration of import growth mean that the government and external sectors
are likely to be a drag on growth in the years to come.
Net exports sustained modest growth in 2013

GDP growth decelerated to an estimated 1.4% in
2013, its slowest pace since 1997. The main driver
of the slowdown was sluggish domestic demand,
as both private consumption and investment were
adversely affected by weak confidence and
anaemic lending. Uncertainty, partly related to the
high level of unpaid government obligations
towards businesses, has been slow to dissipate,
even if the repayment of arrears started in March
this year. Net exports maintained their positive
contribution in 2013 as a result of depressed
imports and good export performance.
Private domestic demand to take over as main
growth engine

In the first half of 2014, economic growth was still
weak at 0.5% y-o-y, to a large extent reflecting a
high base effect from the pre-election period last
year, especially in the construction sector, but
survey indicators point to a broader-based recovery
of private domestic demand in the second quarter.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

This sets the stage for an expected gradual
economic recovery alongside a rebalancing from
net exports to private investment and consumption.

GDP growth is forecast to speed up from 1.8% in
2014 to 3.5% in 2016, and with the gradual closing
of the output gap, inflation is expected to move
closer towards the middle of the central bank's
target range of 2%-4%.
Growth in the short term should get support from a
bold programme to tackle arrears, backed by the
IMF and the World Bank. The front-loaded
payment of accumulated government liabilities,
worth as much as 5.3% of GDP, over three years is
expected to lift growth by injecting liquidity into
companies. Tackling this long-standing issue
should also boost business confidence and thus
contribute to a turnaround in private investment,
which has been the biggest drag on growth in
recent years. In addition, two large projects in the
energy sector are expected to boost FDI inflows.
Household spending is also forecast to pick up
amid improving confidence, easing financial
conditions and modest gains in employment.
Bank lending on the mend

The weak cyclical position of the economy and the
resulting deceleration in inflation prompted Bank
of Albania to embark on a series of cuts in the
policy rate, which now stands at an historic low of
2.5%. The transmission of this monetary policy
stimulus to the economy, long constrained by high
risk premia applied by banks and low levels of
crediting, has recently gained some traction and
contributed to an across-the-board improvement in
lending. Improved credit terms were reflected in
lower interest rates, while the stock of outstanding
loans started to increase in annual terms in July
(+0.5%) and in August (+2.2%), reversing the
downtrend started in July 2013.
On the other hand, the level of non-performing
loans in the banking sector remains stubbornly
high at more than 24%, despite regulatory efforts

125

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2014

to clean bank balance sheets. Still, the banking
sector remains well-capitalised and liquid, and
continued loose monetary policy is expected to
support a further easing of financial conditions.

2016. FDI inflows should finance most of the
deficit, averting balance-of-payment pressures.
Fiscal consolidation on the agenda

The economic slowdown as well as weaknesses in
revenue collection, have taken their toll on the
budget, which posted persistently large deficits in
the past six years. After recognising government
arrears, public debt relative to GDP now exceeds
70%, a high level by regional standards. In order to
lower refinancing risks and rebuild fiscal space,
the government raised taxes in 2014 and stepped
up efforts to improve collection, with noticeable
results. Net of arrears clearance expenses (worth
2.5% of GDP in 2014, 1.3% in 2015 and 1.2% in
2016) the budget deficit is expected to fall
considerably over the forecast horizon from its
level in 2013, and the public debt-to-GDP ratio is
forecast to peak in 2014. However, significant
fiscal risks stem from an unreformed energy
sector, where the government acts as financer of
last resort, and from the obligation for the state to
pay compensation to former property owners,
unless the modalities for compensation are
adjusted.

Labour market and external imbalances to
persist

Despite a pick-up in growth, high unemployment
in Albania is expected to decline only modestly.
However, labour market statistics still suffer from
shortcomings and might underestimate the true
level of joblessness, making forecasts particularly
challenging.
Albania's large current account deficit reflects a
narrow production base and weak competitiveness.
Its recent reduction came as a result of both
cyclically subdued imports as well as relatively
good export performance. Potential for further
increases in crude oil production as well as an
expected pick-up in foreign sales of other
traditional products, textiles and footwear, should
help sustain high growth in merchandise exports.
However, imports are likely to gather speed along
with stronger investments, leading to a widening of
the current account shortfall in the period until

35. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Broad-based recovery gaining ground
After a weak start to the year, the US economy has rebounded strongly and looks set to enjoy a broadbased, self-sustaining recovery supported by a gradually waning fiscal drag, supportive monetary
policy, a strengthening labour market, improved private balance sheets, and increasing business
investment. Real GDP growth is expected to reach 2.2% in 2014 and then climb to 3.1% and 3.2% in
2015 and 2016.
Broad-based recovery
early-year weakness

proceeds

despite

Following a sharp, largely weather-related,
contraction in the first quarter, the US economy
rebounded briskly in the second quarter and a
broad-based recovery is expected to continue in
the second half of the year and then in 2015 and
2016. Considerably lower fiscal drag and the
continuation of accommodative monetary policies
will boost activity over the forecast horizon.
Private consumption is expected to firm thanks to
an improving labour market and lower
deleveraging pressures, while both business and
residential investment are set to accelerate on the
back of attractive financing conditions and
improving confidence.
After contracting by 0.5% q-o-q in the first quarter
due to severe weather and heavy de-stocking, real
GDP expanded by 1.1% in the second quarter, and
the momentum remains strong in the second half
of the year. However, the sharp first quarter
contraction implies a marked downward revision
to the projected annual real GDP growth in 2014 to
2.2%, due to negative carryover effects. The
outlook for 2015 remains largely unchanged with
real GDP expected to grow by 3.1% and to
strengthen marginally to 3.2% in 2016.

exacerbated by harsh weather conditions.
Residential investment is expected to accelerate
over the forecast horizon, driven by a
normalisation of very subdued household
formation rates in the recent past. But expansion
rates are not likely to reach pre-crisis double-digit
rates, largely due to the slowing of US population
growth and a trend shift towards multi-family
housing. Over the forecast horizon, residential
investment will also be restrained by the gradual
rise in mortgage rates and tighter-than-pre-crisis
lending conditions. Consequently, the share of
residential construction in GDP is expected to rise
moderately, but remain well below its pre-crisis
peak of 6.5% (in 2005) in the medium term.

Rebounding investment

Business investment rebounded in the second
quarter following the weak first quarter, and
leading indicators (e.g. capital goods orders, PMIs)
suggest solid expansion in the remainder of the
year. Further ahead, business investment is
expected to continue strengthening, boosted by the
pent-up need to rebuild capital stocks amid firming
domestic and foreign demand, still conducive
financing conditions and record-high corporate
profits.
Construction investment equally firmed up after
the weakness at the turn of the year, which
reflected the impact of rising mortgage rates

128

Private consumption is expected to strengthen over
the forecast horizon, as labour market and
household balance sheets continue to improve
thanks to falling indebtedness and rising equity
and home prices. Government spending is
expected to rebound gradually after a four year
contraction, and to grow slightly from 2015
onwards. Exports will gradually accelerate
benefitting from the projected rebound in global
trade in 2015 and 2016, while imports will rise in
line with firming domestic demand. However, the
gradually declining dependency on energy imports
should prevent current account deficits from

Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America

widening above 3% of GDP, markedly lower than
in the run-up to the crisis.
Buoyant labour market gradually translates
into price and wage pressures

Buoyant job creation since early 2014, combined
with the gradual decline in the participation rate,
brought the unemployment rate down to below
6%. Non-farm employment grew by an impressive
227,000 on average in the first 9 months of 2014,
the best 9-monthly result since 2006. These
improvements, however, have occurred amid a
steady decline in the participation rate, which hit a
37-year low in September 2014, signalling that the
cyclical inflow into the labour force remains too
weak to offset the secular demographic trend. As
the economy strengthens job creation is expected
to remain strong, bringing the unemployment rate
down to 5.4% in 2016, around the natural rate. In
the latter part of the forecast horizon, a cyclical
expansion of the labour force will prevent more
decisive declines in the unemployment rate.
Despite the recovery in the labour market, inflation
remains well below the 2% target and wage growth
has not shown any signs of acceleration over the
last two years. However, both price and wage

pressures are expected to pick up gradually as the
negative output gap closes in 2015 and turns
positive in 2016. Consumer prices and wages are
expected to accelerate gradually to over 2% and
3%, respectively, by the end of 2016.
Activity will be supported by accommodative
monetary policy and easing fiscal drag

Gauging the amount of slack in the labour market
remains the key challenge faced by the Federal
Reserve. While the current asset purchase
programme is expected to end by November, the
Fed's forward guidance continues to assure that
interest rates are likely to be kept at the current
near-zero level for a "considerable time after the
asset purchase program ends". Therefore, given the
continued absence of major price/wage pressures
and the cautious stance of the Fed, monetary
policy is expected to remain supportive throughout
the forecast horizon.
Fiscal consolidation eased sharply in 2014 and will
continue falling gradually over the course of the
forecast horizon. Lower deficits will translate into
gradually declining debt levels, which are expected
to start falling from 2015 to reach 104.4% of GDP
in 2016.

Lower growth ahead
Real GDP growth is set to slow in 2014 as a sharper-than-expected decline following April's
consumption tax hike weighs on growth. In 2015 the growth rate is expected to decline marginally, and
remain at the same level in 2016 on the back of ongoing fiscal consolidation, negative real wage growth
weighing on private consumption, and waning monetary and fiscal stimulus.
Near-term growth weaker than expected

Economic growth stalled in the first half of the
year as the post-consumption-tax-hike contraction
in Q2 turned out sharper than expected. Weak
private consumption and gross fixed capital
formation dragged on growth, whilst the positive
contribution from net exports was due to falling
imports. A rebound is expected over the second
half of 2014, but leading indicators point to a
feeble growth momentum. Industrial production
has been on a steady downward trend since Q1,
suggesting that solid growth in the first quarter was
mainly due to strong pre-tax-hike demand.
Private consumption is squeezed by sluggish
wage
growth
and
ongoing
fiscal
consolidationâ¦

Real private consumption rebounded weakly from
its post-tax-hike decline, and remains below last
year's average. Labour market conditions appear
tight on the surface, but underlying employment
and wage dynamics do not support a strong
rebound
in
private
consumption.
The
unemployment rate (3.5% in August) reached its
lowest level since 1997, largely because of
workers â in particular women â leaving the labour
force after strong demand in Q1 waned, whilst new
jobs created are mainly part-time or temporary.
Nominal wage growth remains sluggish overall
and below CPI inflation on average, which is
likely to dampen the rebound in private
consumption in the second half of the year. Private
consumption is expected to remain volatile in 2015
in anticipation of the next consumption tax hike
currently planned for October. But overall
continued negative real wage growth is expected to
keep downward
pressure on
household
consumption.

horizon. Public investment should level off in the
near term, and gradually scale back to the preAbenomics level as fiscal consolidation
progresses. With very low or even slightly
negative real interest rates, investment conditions
are very favourable, and should remain broadly so.
Private non-residential (business) investment is
expected to gradually respond to these continued
loose financing conditions, as well as stronger
corporate profits and the perspective of a more
favourable tax environment ahead. However
business investment growth will be dampened by
persistent cash hoarding in the form of high
corporate savings. Private residential investment
should slowly recover from the post-consumptiontax-hike slump, but may remain volatile in view of
further tax changes.
Net exports contribute to growth

Exports are expected to gradually respond to
sustained currency weakness and a more
favourable external environment, in particular
strengthening US demand and resilient growth in
Asia. Imports are likely to remain volatile in the
near term due to the tax hike scheduled for
October 2015, even though the gradual and partial
reactivation of nuclear power capacity may at least
to some extent ease fossil fuel imports. Overall net
exports are expected to turn positive again and
progressively increase.

Inflation below target

Whilst labour markets will remain tight, continued
duality between regular and non-regular workers
and corporate reticence to consistently raise basic
salaries are set to maintain downward pressure on
wages. Subdued nominal wage growth, mild
inflationary dynamics and successive consumption
tax hikes will entail negative real wage growth.
CPI inflation has recently levelled off as cost-push
pressures began to dissipate. Headline inflation
(including the tax hike effect) stood at 3.3% y-o-y
in August, whilst core inflation (excluding fresh
food and energy) came in at 2.2% y-o-y. CPI
inflation will plateau in the near-term as base
effects from last yearâs currency depreciation
wane. Weak wage growth will not contribute to
stronger domestic-driven inflation dynamics. CPI
inflation (including the tax hike effect) is expected
to remain slightly below 3% in 2014, and stay
below 2% both in 2015 and in 2016. Monetary
policy will remain broadly supportive and
accommodative over the forecast period.

revenue growth is going to contribute to halving
the primary deficit over the forecast horizon, and
reducing the pace of growth of the debt-to-GDP
ratio. Some uncertainty remains, however,
concerning the October 2015 consumption tax hike
and planned cuts in the corporate tax rate,
representing a downside risk to the fiscal outlook.
On the expenditure side, additional spending
pressures may materialise over the forecast horizon
in the form of public investment in preparation for
the 2020 Olympics.
Risks

Risks are tilted to the downside and mainly
domestic. Weaker than expected wage growth
would dent private consumption and weaken
reflationary efforts. Uncertainty surrounding fiscal
consolidation and structural reform may compound
subdued prospects for domestic growth and
dampen corporate and investorsâ sentiment despite
favourable financing conditions. On the external
side, exports remain vulnerable to a sharper-thanexpected slowdown in China or lower-thanexpected EU growth.

Fiscal consolidation to progress further

Based on the assumption that the October 2015
consumption tax hike will go ahead, steady

37. CHINA
Gradual adjustment towards more balanced growth
The first quarter of 2014 saw a clear weakening of growth and a sharp deterioration in the property
sector, but the Chinese economy held up well into the second and third quarter, following a round of
small scale stimulus measures, and a rebound in exports. Growth is expected to moderate over the
forecast horizon as structural factors increasingly weigh on activity. However, uncertainty remains
about the economy's underlying momentum, and a sharper short-term adjustment cannot be ruled out.
Stimulus buttresses growth after faltering start to
New Year

China's economic growth decelerated in Q1-2014
to 7.4% y-o-y. Although this was only a modest
step down from the 7.7% recorded for 2013, the
slowdown in Q1 was accompanied by a string of
worsening high frequency indicators, a marked
deterioration in the property sector and very weak
export performance (-5% y-o-y). Following a
series of small-scale stimulus measures which
helped buttress investment spending, growth
subsequently stabilised in Q2 before edging down
a little further in Q3 to 7.3%, despite a strong
rebound in exports from May onwards.
Recent high frequency indicators also provide a
mixed picture of the domestic economy. August
registered the worst monthly report for industrial
production since 2008, but retail sales have held up
well in recent months. The property market
continues to look fragile, with floor space
completed and under construction both very weak,
but some signs of bottoming out in starts for
residential buildings. Survey indicators have been
relatively stable, with PMIs moving in a fairly
narrow range just above 50. Inflation remains low
(below 3%) and relatively stable.

People's Bank of China widened the RMB
intervention band around the daily rate to 2%.
Following a long period of gradual appreciation
that saw a rise in the real effective exchange rate
(REER) of almost 20% between January 2011 and
January 2014, the currency reversed direction
between January and August 2014, falling by
around 5% in REER terms and 1-2% against the
US dollar. Fiscal policy has also been loosened,
with an acceleration of local government projects,
though this activity remains outside the central
government balance sheet and the scale of
adjustment is hard to assess.
Given the tepid first half of the year, it is expected
that both monetary and fiscal policy will remain
accommodative and that the Chinese government
will continue to use targeted stimulus measures to
keep growth within reach of the official target for
2014 of 7.5%.

The forecast for 2014 is for growth of 7.3%,
moderating to 7.1% in 2015 and 6.9% in 2016.
This forecast is predicated on a controlled
slowdown in the real estate sector, together with a
managed adjustment to lower trend growth,
reflecting a degree of successful "rebalancing" of
the Chinese economy.
Fiscal and monetary policy are expected to
remain accommodative

Monetary policy turned more accommodative in
early 2014, in response to the early year weakness
in activity. Although official policy lending rates
remain unchanged, interbank rates have now edged
down to below 3%, around 1 pp. lower than the
average seen through 2013. In February the

Slower growth as investment adjusts

Private consumption is expected to grow steadily,
underpinned by continued growth in real wages
and low inflation, which raises real household
income from deposit holdings. Wealth effects from
falling house prices are likely to be limited and
localised. Investment remains the most dominant
component of GDP at close to 50%, of which
around 1/4 is directly related to the real estate

Other non-EU Countries, China

sector. Real estate investment slumped during late
2013 and early 2014, and may have further to
adjust. However, medium term fundamentals
(urbanization, income growth) remain strong, and
a loosening of controls on the property sector will
dampen downward pressure in the short run. Other
investment has also slowed, though less
dramatically. Looking ahead to 2015 and 2016,
we expect investment growth to continue to follow
this pattern, continuing to moderate as falling
returns exert a greater drag on China's economy,
but underpinned by further policy stimulus should
activity weaken significantly.
After steady growth in both exports and imports in
2012 and 2013, imports have virtually stagnated so
far in 2014, most likely reflecting weakening
investment activity and a related fall in commodity
imports. Import growth is expected to remain
subdued, though stronger on the service side, and
with some possible bounce-back of imports for
export-trade processing. The sharp pick-up in
exports since May was driven mainly by rising
demand from advanced economies, including the
US and the EU. Given the weak outlook for the
EU, this may be a difficult trend to sustain,
suggesting that export growth could also slow in
coming months. An offsetting factor could be
faster growth of exports to the US, particularly

given the halt in the rise of the RMB exchange rate
versus the US dollar. The current account balance
is expected to widen slightly over the forecast
horizon, moving back towards 2.5% of GDP.
Risks remain elevated

The major risk factors are closely linked to China's
domestic imbalances, particularly over-reliance on
investment spending and the high weight of
property related investment in GDP. The
associated build-up of local government and
corporate debt has been large by historical
standards, with a significant proportion financed
by the shadow banking system, and the quality of
the underlying assets is variable. While a gradual
rebalancing towards higher consumption and lower
levels of (higher quality) investment is warranted,
a sharper-than-expected slowdown in investment,
or a significant worsening of outlook for the
property market would not only have a direct
impact on domestic demand, but could also place
highly leveraged corporates and developers under
pressure, with potential knock-on risks for the
financial system.

38. EFTA
Economic outlook less bright
The EFTA region's economic outlook is revised downwards. The Swiss economy did not grow in the
second quarter which was contrary to expectations. The Norwegian economy did record solid growth
but the outlook for the off-shore sector has deteriorated which will feed into domestic demand.
Although the EFTA region is far from
homogeneous, the EFTA economies showed a
remarkable resilience with respect to the EU
economy. Common factors are their high
economic integration with the European Union, the
key role of private consumption for economic
growth, the importance of the EU as a supply of
labour, easy monetary conditions in response to a
safe haven effect and the ability to tap into new
markets.
Another important commonality is the uncertainty
about the potential growth rate in these countries.
Private consumption has been a driving force of
economic growth supported by low unemployment
and contained consumer price inflation. Still,
prices have risen strongly in the housing market.
The price level of actual individual consumption,
which is much higher in both Switzerland and
Norway than in the EU, has a bearing on
immigration incentives. In Norway, the price level
of consumption is twice the level in the three most
important home counties of EU immigrants, and in
Switzerland it is 50% above. Moreover, the
reservation wage of foreign labour is linked to the
purchasing power in the home country of rights
acquired in the host country.
Economic outlook for Norway

Economic growth had a strong reading in the
second quarter even if the off-shore economy did
not grow. The strong reading was fully accounted
for by the mainland economy that grew 1.2%
quarter-on-quarter. Growth in the mainland
economy was broad-based. The manufacturing
sector posted strong growth and private
consumption continued it solid expansion. Among
the most positive signals in the second quarter was
the growth of exports outside the petroleum sector.
These exports of traditional goods grew by 3.5%
quarter-on-quarter.
Key to future developments will be the
developments in the petroleum sector and the
effects this will have on the broader economy. The
uncertainty around this impact is exemplified by
the spread between the most positive and negative

134

forecasts in the market. An official survey
indicated that investments are expected to peak
this year. They are expected to decline by one fifth
next year and it is not unlikely they will retreat
further in the following years. Adding to this is the
recent decline in oil prices that make investments
less profitable and worsens Norway's terms of
trade.

Dom.Demand

GDP (y-o-y%)

If the planned reduction in investment materialises,
domestic demand growth would come under
pressure first through its effect on upstream
companies in the supply chain for the petroleum
sector. The question is then to which extent this
will influence private consumption through
confidence effects; possibly in combination with
the effect tightened financial regulation has on
house prices. The government has room to support
the Norwegian economy under the existing budget
rules. The budget surplus is foreseen to remain
highly comfortable in the coming years while
public debt as a percentage of GDP remains low
compared to other European countries.
Economic outlook for Switzerland

GDP registered no growth in the second quarter
contrary to expectations. The weakness was
broadly spread in the domestic economy with net
exports also contributing negatively. Domestic
demand contributed only marginally which was
still an improvement over the first quarter when

domestic demand did not contribute at all to GDP
growth.

pps.

Private consumption has been an important pillar
of economic growth in the past years. It has been
supported by high employment, high wages and a
wealth effect coming from rising house prices. The
deflation that Switzerland experienced over the
past years has not hurt consumptive demand or
economic growth but rather bolstered real wages.
Inflation is expected to be moderately positive
over the forecast horizon.

decisions of, in particular multinational,
companies. Investment has already been a
relatively weak driver of economic growth in the
past years.

The expectations are that economic growth will
pick up in the third and fourth quarter so that on
annual basis GDP growth of 1.4% can be
registered. Still, uncertainties remain as an
important driver of growth is expected to be the
export sector while the growth in export markets is
becoming increasingly uncertain. Moreover, the
referendum against mass immigration may limit
Switzerland's possibility to profit from foreign
labour, which has been an important contributing
force to the Swiss economic success and resilience.
Uncertainty about the openness of the Swiss
economy could well impact the investment

39. RUSSIAN FEDERATION
Heading towards stagnation
Geo-political tensions over the situation in Ukraine, including sanctions, have exacerbated existing
structural bottlenecks linked to an exhausted growth model largely centred on the export of natural
resources. This is taking a heavy toll on the growth outlook: Russia is expected to move to nearstagnation both in 2014 and 2015 before gradually recovering in 2016. This reflects a slump in
investment and decelerating consumption, while inflationary pressures remain significant.
Sharp slowdown amidst geopolitical tensionsâ¦

Economic growth in Russia had been on a
declining trend for some time as the growth model
based on the export of natural resources ran out of
steam, diversification of the economy made only
little progress and investment stalled. These trends
are exacerbated by the fall-out from geopolitical
tensions, including sanctions, which disrupt trade
and financial flows, undermine confidence and
take a heavy toll on investment and consumption.

Real GDP is expected to sharply slow down to
near-stagnation in 2014 as the geo-political
tensions over Ukraine have intensified in the
course of the year, culminating in economic
sanctions against Russia imposed by the EU, the
US and a number of other countries. Economic
activity showed some resilience in the first half of
the year, helped by exports. However, rising
geopolitical tensions and the related political and
economic uncertainty already triggered a sharp
contraction of investment and a deceleration of
private consumption in the second quarter, on the
back of rising capital outflows and rising
borrowing costs.
Geopolitical tensions are set to drag down growth
well into 2015. A gradual recovery of the Russian
economy may be expected only in 2016, albeit still

136

below the growth rates observed in previous years,
as structural bottlenecks are increasingly weighing
on potential output growth.
â¦reflecting a slump in
decelerating consumption

investment

and

After a small rebound in the second half of 2013, a
major slump in investment is expected for 2014
(and has already started to materialise in the first
half of the year), followed by a smaller contraction
in 2015. This reflects a largely deteriorated
investment climate in connection with rising
uncertainty over the duration of geo-political
tensions, major capital outflows and rising
financing costs for Russian banks and
corporations. This is further aggravated by the
effect of recent sanctions, which effectively
prevent access to Western capital markets for some
main Russian companies (in the banking, defence
and oil sectors).
Private consumption growth, which has been a
major growth driver in recent years, is also
expected to slow down in 2014 and to remain
subdued in 2015, before picking up moderately in
2016. This is due to increasing pressures on real
disposable incomes, as households face higher
debt servicing costs, rising inflation levels and a
slowdown of wage growth.
Exports are expected to decelerate in 2014 and to
pick up moderately in 2015 and 2016 in line with
the anticipated recovery in main export markets
and provided that geopolitical tensions ease in the
course of 2015. A sharp slump of imports is
expected for 2014, on the back of slower domestic
demand, a weaker exchange rate and the Russian
ban on certain food imports. Exports are overall
more resilient than imports since sales of Russian
oil and gas have been largely unaffected by the
geopolitical tensions.

Other non-EU Countries, Russian Federation

Still tight labour market

A moderate contraction in employment is expected
mainly due to a continuing decline in working age
population. Employment losses triggered by the
current growth slowdown are set to remain limited
given a very tight labour market and attempts to
shift towards import substitution.
However,
unemployment is set to increase moderately in
2015 and 2016, reflecting the sharp slowdown in
output growth.
High inflation and rouble depreciation

Geopolitical tensions in the course of 2014 led to
substantial rouble depreciation to record lows.
Inflation also picked-up sharply and is expected to
reach 7.5% on average in 2014, mainly as a result
of rouble depreciation and restrictions on food
imports. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has
tightened monetary policy substantially by raising
its key rate in three steps throughout 2014 from
5.5% to 8% and carried out large scale foreign
exchange intervention in the first half of the year,
in an attempt to soften the impact of capital
outflows and to halt the rouble depreciation.

and structural bottlenecks on the supply side, and
to subside only gradually to 6% in 2016.
A weakening fiscal outlook

The general government balance is set to slightly
improve in 2014 as the depreciating rouble will
boost oil-related revenues amidst relatively strong
oil price in the first half of the year. The fiscal
balance is expected to deteriorate in 2015 and 2016
due to weaker revenue growth linked with lower
oil price levels and a slowing pace of rouble
depreciation, while overall expenditure growth will
remain elevated.
Risks to the outlook

Major downside risks to the outlook are related to
persistent geopolitical tensions over Ukraine.
Moreover, since the Russian economy remains
highly dependent on oil-related income, a stronger
decrease in oil or gas prices could further add to
the pressures.

Inflation is set to remain elevated in 2015, in
connection with protracted geopolitical tensions

Statistical Annex

Note on concepts and sources
1. The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fullyfledged economic forecasts in Winter, Spring and Autumn.These
forecasts cover the principal macroeconomic aggregates for
the Member States, the candidate countries,the European Union
as a whole, the euro area and the international environment.
2. Data for 2014, 2015 and 2016 are forecasts. The source for all
tables is the European Commission, unless otherwise stated.
Historical data for the Member States are based on the European
System of Accounting (ESA 2010). Most Member States have now
introduced chain-linking in their national accounts to measure
the development of economic aggregates in volume terms.For
the USA and Japan the definitions are as in the SNA.
3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand
respectively, present data including inventories.
4. In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for
USA and Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior
to 1996.
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential
output as estimated via a production function, where the
increase in the capital stock and the difference between actual
unemployment and the NAWRU play a key role.
6. Employment data used in tables 23-29 and 32-33 are based on
full-time-equivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain,
France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria report FTE data. In the
absence of FTE data, employment is based on numbers of
persons. In the calculation of EU and euro-area aggregates,
priority is given to FTE data, as this is regarded as more
representative of diverse patterns of working time.

aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange
rates.Tables 49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area
"adjusted" balances. Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area
vis-Ã -vis third countries should be identical to the sum of the
balances of the individual countries in the EU or the euro area.
However, intra-EU or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero
because of reporting errors. The creation of the internal market in
1993 reduced border controls and formalities, and accordingly
the scope and precision of intra-EU trade coverage. Typically,
intra-EU imports are underestimated compared to intra-EU
exports, leading to an overestimation of the surplus. For the past
the "adjusted" balances are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB
estimates for the euro area. For the future, they are ECFIN's
forecasts based on the extrapolation of the discrepancies
observed in 2013.
9. Geographical zones are defined as follows :
Euro area :
EA19 (BE, DE, EE, IE, EL, ES, FR, IT, CY, LV, LT, LU, MT, NL, AT,
PT, SI, SK and FI)
European Union :
EU28 (EA19, BG, CZ, DK, HR, HU, PL, RO, SE and UK).
Candidate countries :
Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia, and Albania.
Potential candidates :
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Advanced economies :
EU, candidate countries, USA, Japan, Canada, Norway,
Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand.
MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :
Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
