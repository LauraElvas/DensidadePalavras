     vii Executive Summary The current European recession, one of the deepest and longest on record, is showing signs of bottoming out. After gathering pace through early 2009, the contraction appears to have ended 

at mid-2009, helped by rebounding confidence and a tentative pickup in global trade. Headline inflation remains low, reflecting developments in commodity prices and weak demand, especially 
investment. In most emerging economies, economic activity and inflation have followed similar 

paths, but with more heterogeneity. Especially in countries that have experienced steep declines 

in capital inflows, the downturn is easing more slowly. 
Although policy frameworks in Europe typically take a medium-term approach, policymakers adapted and moved steadily to address many of the policy and coordination challenges posed by the crisis. Interest rate cuts, unconventional monetary measures, and rapidly accumulating fiscal 

deficits helped put a floor under falling economic activity. And an array of financial sector 
interventions succeeded in dissipating systemic hazards and lifting risk appetite and asset prices, 
even though their implementation and coordination was complicated at first by the 
unprecedented nature of the crisis and the lack of established European processes for dealing 
with it. The recovery is likely to be slow and fragile. Because of the ongoing rebalancing of global 
demand, Europe cannot count on exports alone to drive the recovery. At the same time, the 
drag from rising unemployment and scarcity of credit as banks continue to deleverage their 
balance sheets will weigh on economic activity. The risks around this baseline are broadly 
balanced. On the upside, the pickup in global trade could prove stronger and longer lasting than 
currently anticipated. On the downside, bad loans tied to the recession could further aggravate tensions in the financial sector. Moreover, overhangs of foreign currency-denominated debt in emerging Europe create vulnerabilities that could resonate across the continent through the 

highly integrated banking system and tight trade links. Another risk is tied to consumption, 
which could suffer if employment adjusted only slowly to the cycle, raising the prospect of a 
jobless recovery, with possibly negative repercussions for confidence, consumption, and 
investment. Beyond the short run, the recovery is likely to be hampered by the impact of the crisis on 
potential output and Europe™s well-known structural rigidities. Europe™s medium-term growth 
outlook has been weakened by the drop in investment that followed the crisis, threats of 
increasing structural unemployment, and the end of financial sector, real estate, and construction 
booms in a number of countries (Chapter 2). While the exact impact of the crisis is hard to pin 
down and some of the developments affecting potential output are bound to correct themselves, others tie into long-standing European issues, such as high levels of employment protection and unrealized growth opportunities in the market for services, particularly in advanced economies. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY viii Against this background, policymakers should focus their attention on securing a durable and strong recovery. In the near term, they should adopt a more resolute and proactive approach to 
assessing the balance sheet risks faced by banks, and take action to recapitalize or restructure 
viable institutions and resolve others. In addition, the welcome overhaul of the European 
Union™s (EU) financial stability arrangements should be implemented swiftly to guarantee the 
effective coordination of financial supervision across borders, including that between emerging and advanced economies, and to guide the implementation of macroprudential regulation to 

guard against future financial sector risks. Fundamental progress on comprehensive cross-border 
crisis management is still needed, including the creation of tools for early intervention and cost-

sharing rules. At the same time, monetary and fiscal policy need to move carefully to sustain the upswing while 
preparing to disengage from the extraordinary measures put in place during the crisis. Although 

the fragility of the recovery requires fiscal policy to follow through with planned stimuli and letting automatic stabilizers work, sustainability concerns demand a strong consolidation 
effortŠalso because of the looming fiscal costs of Europe™s rapidly aging population. Monetary 
policy will need to remain supportive for the time being and keep all options open. In the advanced economies, there might still be additional room for maneuver through a more forceful 
signal of the intent to keep interest rates low and the extension of nonstandard measures. But 

these policies are not without costs and raise the possibility of market dislocations, moral hazard, and accumulation of risks on the much-increased balance sheets of the central banks. Central 
banks should thus plan to exit as soon as the recovery takes hold. Potential growth is tightly linked to all elements of the European policy agenda. Moving fast to repair the damage the crisis has caused to potential output will make for a more dynamic and robust recovery, which, among other things, will strengthen fiscal sustainability and ease exit 
problems. In the advanced economies, policymakers should pursue opportunities to reform 

labor and product markets and make every effort to rejuvenate the Lisbon Agenda. In most 
emerging economies, structural flexibility that allows a shift of resources and labor to the 
production of tradable goods and services will be important for ensuring further progress in catching up with income levels in the advanced economies, especially if capital flows to the emerging European economies remained subdued. 
The uncertainty surrounding the size of the drop in potential output due to the crisis is 
considerable, and policymakers will need to take it into account (Chapter 3). Central banks must 
clearly communicate their views on the path of potential output and its implications for price 
stability to anchor inflation expectations and limit the costs of policy mistakes. Given the impact 
of the crisis on public finances, fiscal policy should err on the side of caution and start the necessary consolidation as soon as the state of the cycle allows. 
The effects of the crisis are also likely to linger with respect to macroeconomic volatility in many 
emerging markets (Chapter 4). Financial markets have developed a keen eye for external and internal vulnerabilities. In particular, fiscal sustainability concerns, stemming partly from worries 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ix about the extent of problems in the financial sector, have triggered a decompression of interest 
rate spreads and have increased exchange rate volatility over and above the effects of the global shocks hitting the region. In the short run, policies to stabilize the financial sector and deal with foreign debt overhangs will be helpful. But to address the more lasting volatility shifts, 
policymakers will profit particularly from introducing frameworks that steady fiscal policy 
around a sustainable path and improve financial stability arrangements. Steps in this direction would also support growth through lowering perceived investor risk and interest rates. 
 
      1 1. Outlook: Beyond the Crisis    With signs that the recession is bottoming out, European 
policymakers now need to focus on securing a durable recovery 
and addressing the threats to potential growth from the 

financial crisis and the continent™s traditional structural 

rigidities. In the near term, further action to restore normal 
functioning of the financial system remains crucial, while 

policymakers will need to move carefully both to sustain the 
upswing and to prepare for exit from the extraordinary 
interventions in a coordinated fashion. And many emerging 

economies will need to adapt to lower capital inflows, address 
debt overhangs, and institute structural change.
 Fragile Recovery 
The Contraction Appears to Be Ending . . .   The crisis has hit Europe particularly hard, 
perhaps harder than other regions of the world (see 
IMF, 2009e), though considerable diversity prevails 

across the region. All countries have been affected by the financial crisis and the collapse in global 
trade, with the impact commensurate with the 

extent of exposure to toxic assets, reliance on 

securitization, and dependence on world markets. In 

addition, several countries are suffering from the 

bursting of homegrown real estate and construction 
bubbles (Ireland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and 

the Baltics, for example). And a number of countries 

have been left vulnerable because of concerns about 
fiscal sustainability like Greece and Italy or because 
of concerns about large current account deficits like 
Hungary and the Balkans.1  There are signs that the recession, which is now 
one of the deepest and longest on record, is 

bottoming out. In the advanced economies, very

discussion of how homegrown risks added to the global shock 
and led to a cross-country differentiation of the crisis impact in 

Europe. weak investment and falling exports were the main 
drivers of a contraction that gathered speed at a 
frightening pace in the second half of 2008 and climaxed in early 2009, with the first quarter 

showing an annualized drop of GDP of about 

10 percent for the European Union (EU) and the 

euro area (Figure 1). Consumption held up relatively 

better in many countries, mirroring still-robust real 

wage growth, the absence of a large-scale labor 

market adjustment helped by collective bargaining 

agreements and government-supported work-time reductions, the operation of generous social safety 
nets, and some fiscal measures supporting specific 
purchases such as car-scrapping subsidies.
2 Ireland and Spain are notable exceptions to this pattern and 
have seen their unemployment rates rise rapidly 

amid construction busts (Figure 2). The pace of the 

fall in GDP slowed markedly during the first half of 
2009, however, as the near-panic subsided,

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 2 confidence ended its free fall, and policy stimulus 
gained traction. Hence, during the second quarter of 

2009, GDP in the EU and euro area contracted by 

only about 1 and ½ percent (annualized), 

respectively, while France and Germany registered 
modest growth.  Most emerging European economies and new 
EU member states followed a similar path, but with 

more heterogeneity. For many of these economies, 

domestic demand in the rest of Europe and global 
trade greatly affect their business cycle, a connection 
that, particularly in Central Europe, is amplified by 
tight supply chain links to Western neighbors (for 

example, in the car industry). For other countries, 

such as the Baltics, that face sharp external financial 

difficulties, the speed of the downturn is easing 
more slowly. Russia™s recession is particularly 

pronounced because of the combination of the 

reversal in capital flows and low energy prices. 

Poland, in contrast, the largest of the new EU 
member states, has so far weathered the global storm remarkably, without registering a contraction. 

This success has been due to resilient consumption 

and a relatively low dependence on exports. In 

addition, the absence of internal or external 

imbalances allowed room for countercyclical 

policies. 
 Financial and capital markets show signs of 
returning confidence and risk appetite. The yield 

curve has been steepening, and equity markets have 

steadied (Figure 3). Compared to the situation 

before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when 
investors fled risky assets and accumulated sovereign 
bonds, European markets have regained some of the 

lost ground, and longer-term bond yields in the euro 

area are approaching precrisis levels. Shorter-run 

interest rates have come down further across 

advanced economies andŠwith delay and at a 

slower paceŠin some emerging economies. 
 Nonetheless, problems in the banking sector 
linger, and credit growth continues to weaken while 

cross-border flows remain subdued. Banks have 

been measurably tightening credit standards, citing a 

weak economic outlook, funding difficulties, and a 

continued need to reduce the leverage of their 

balance sheets. Indeed, the pace of credit extension

 OUTLOOK: BEYOND THE CRISIS 3 to households and firms is declining in the euro area 
and elsewhere (Figure 4), and small- and medium-

sized enterprises especially are complaining about 

credit constraints. Recent surveys of bank lending, 

however, indicate that the pace of standard 
tightening might be decreasing, at least in EU 
countries, and it is noteworthy that GDP growth 

declined even faster than credit aggregates in the 

euro area, which sends mixed signals about the 

extent to which supply constraints are affecting 

credit at this point (Figure 5). 
 Meanwhile, in emerging Europe, increased 
official financing and regional coordination between 
private and public agents have averted a collapse in 

capital flows to emerging economies; market 

participants, though, remain concerned about the 

level of private debt, the availability of external 
financing, and the instability of the exchange rate 
(IMF, 2009c). Hence, while capital flows into the 

region have rebounded slightly from their crisis 
lows, they remain limited, and there are indications, 
that interest rates spreads will remain elevated for 

many European emerging markets for some time 

(Chapter 4).  . . . And Inflation Bottoming Out  Against the background of the deep recession 
associated with a sharp decline in commodity prices, 
headline inflation has fallen considerably in most 
advanced economies. In the euro area, it reached 

into negative territory in mid-2009, and although the 

most recent readings suggest that inflation may be 

past its trough, much will depend on any further 

fluctuations in energy prices (Figure 6). Measures of 

core inflation, which exclude energy prices, have 

been declining at a slower pace or moving sideways, 

which may be among the reasons why inflation 
expectations are well anchored at positive levels.
3 Price developments in emerging European 
economies, while following the same general 

pattern, continue to show somewhat more diversity 

mostly because of nominal fluctuations in the 

exchange rate. This phenomenon also sets apart the 

United Kingdom, where the depreciation of the 

pound has contributed to positive headline inflation 

since the beginning of the crisis. 
_______ 
3 Consensus inflation expectations for the euro area have 
remained close to the aim of the European Central Bank (ECB) 
of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2 percent over the 
medium term throughout the crisis, and break-even expectations have recovered from their end-2008 lows to levels close to 

2 percent recently (IMF, 2009a). -10010203040

 Growth May Be Around the Corner . . . 
 Strong policy action across many advanced and 
emerging economies has eliminated the fears of a 

major depression and helped stabilize demand. 
High-frequency indicators have also been 
increasingly pointing upward (Figure 7), equity 

values are well off their lows, and there are signs 

that declines in housing prices are abating. Still, with 

credit declining, unemployment set to rise, and 
household balance sheets to be repaired in a number 

of countries in Europe, upward momentum is likely 

to remain weak for some time. Indeed, the positive 

signs of the second quarter in the euro area mask 
some underlying vulnerabilities: consumption held 
up, but to a large extent because of temporary public 

schemes; net exports contributed, but mostly 

because of declining imports; and capital spending 
and inventories constituted a drag. History also 

suggests that recoveries from a deep financial crisis 

are sluggish (see IMF, 2008, and Chapter 2 of this 

REO). 
 The baseline forecast thus calls for real activity to 
remain fairly stable during the rest of 2009, giving 

way to a moderate recovery in 2010 and a gradual 

return to more solid growth only afterward 

(Table 1). In advanced economies, GDP growth 

should therefore average 0.5 in 2010 and grow at a 

rate of 1.1 percent by end-2010. Most countries in 
emerging Europe should see growth resume in 2010, 
with the subregion™s GDP rising by an average of 

1.7 percent. There is a stark difference, however, 
between the weaker outlook for countries that need 
to restructure their economy as they adjust to 

sharply reduced capital inflows and the more 

promising prospect for those with an already 

competitive export sector.  The baseline predicts headline inflation to remain 
subdued, as output gaps are expected to continue to be large while commodity prices are projected to rise 

moderately. The latter will be the dominant factor 

nudging euro area inflation back to positive levels 

during the remainder of 2009 to an average of about 

0.8 percent during 2010. Countries such as Germany 

and Ireland that were hit particularly hard by the 

crisis will experience inflation well below this 

average. For emerging economies, the picture is 
more diverse, reflecting, in addition, differences in 
exchange rate regimes, inflation targets, and policy 

performance. In the Baltics and Romania, 

downward pressures are likely to persist for some 

time, whereas in other New Member States and a 

number of Balkan countries inflation should be past 

its trough. In some countries (Ukraine and Russia, 

for example), inflation will remain relatively high, 

despite a projected decline.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 6 . . . But a Robust Recovery Is Unlikely 
 While the recession is likely to be over, the 
recovery may not be smooth. On the positive side, 
confidence has rebounded sharply, in some cases 
even reaching precrisis levels (Sweden, for example), 
and equity markets have been buoyant. At the microlevel, the ongoing inventory adjustment could 
proceed more quickly than many firms anticipate, which could prompt stronger orders than what is 

currently on the books. Yet, these factors may 

provide only temporary support for the recovery.

OUTLOOK: BEYOND THE CRISIS 7  The nature of the global recovery entails 
substantial risks for Europe. Ideally, as global 

rebalancing takes place, countries hitherto strongly 

relying on exports would shift to domestic demand. 

If that shift were to occur, with emerging Asia in the 
lead, the upswing could help Europe™s more export-
oriented economies regain their footing earlier and 

more solidly than expected. In case of a short-lived 

rebalancing, however, global trade would fail to 

deliver the uplift assumed in the baseline forecast 

(IMF, 2009e). As the crisis has amply demonstrated, 
Europe is tightly linked to Asia through trade, and 
Europe™s high degree of internal integration would 

spread the repercussions of such a reversal in net exports throughout the region, including among 
emerging countries. 
 Links between the real and the financial sector 
could turn more negative than envisaged. As credit 

quality declines further because more households 

struggle with falling income and more firms enter bankruptcy, banks will be less willing or able to support the recovery. Corporate insolvencies are 

indeed worrisome: for instance, compared to 2008, 

bankruptcies are up by about 10 percent in 
Germany, 50 percent in the United Kingdom, and 
300 percent in Spain, though from a very low base 
in the last case (Figure 8). As a consequence, firms 

seeking new investment financing during the 

upswing could face constraints. That the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England have 
recently turned to moral suasion, asking banks to 
restart their lending and pass on interest rate cuts to 

borrowers, underlines this risk. Emerging economies 

remain vulnerable to significant credit contractions, 

with the added threat of negative intra-European 
feedback loops between parent banks and their 
affiliates abroad.   Another risk lies in the fragility of European 
employment dynamics. While employment has held 

up well so far, it is likely to deteriorate, particularly 

in advanced economies. With the growth outlook 

modest, sales and revenues far below precrisis levels, 
and the burden of excess capacities heavy, firms are 

likely to adjust their payrolls downward and postpone rehiring until later in the upswing. Indeed, 
the stylized facts suggest that employment in euro 
area countries is significantly more persistent than in 

the United States or in many of Europe™s emerging 

economies (Figure 9). On average, employment 

tends to hold up better during downturns but takes 
much longer to pick up during upturns. As a consequence, the recovery is likely to be jobless, and 

initially further job losses are probable (Box 1)Ša 

situation that opens up the possibility of a 

downward spiral of deteriorating consumer 
sentiment, consumption, and investment. 
Strong Policy Response 
 Although policy frameworks in Europe typically 

take a medium-term approach, policymakers have 

adapted and moved steadily to address many of the policy and coordination challenges raised by the 
crisis. As a result, economic policy has contributed 
significantly to reducing the impact of the crisis, 
truncating tail risks, and paving the way for the 
recovery. 
Progress in Repairing the Financial System  The first phase of financial sector interventions 
was characterized by a flurry of measures aimed at eliminating systemic risk that, owing to the 0100

        urgency of the crisis and the lack of established 
European processes for dealing with it, often had 

an impromptu character (see IMF, 2009d). While 

early on central banks provided significant 
liquidity support, measures to address underlying 
solvency issuesŠsuch as guarantees of bank 

liabilities, the provision of funds for 

recapitalization, the restructuring of unviable 

institutions, and the establishment of ways to deal 

with impaired assets, took longer to coordinate 

and implement; a process still underway. 
 More unified financial sector stress testing for 
the entire region is now being undertaken. A joint 

supervisory exercise, coordinated by the 
Committee of European Banking Supervisors 

(CEBS) and supported by the ECB, looked into 

the robustness of 22 major European banking 

groups, the majority of which are operating across 

borders, including in emerging Europe. And an 
initiative involving Central, Eastern, and Southern 
European central banks coordinated by the IMF is 
stress testing banks in this region to provide an 

up-to-date assessment of their potential resilience 

to shocks and to identify capital needs. While not 

immediately linked to action, these exercises 

provide critical information that can help 

supervisors gauge what needs to be done to clean 
the remaining financial sector risks from the system.  Meanwhile, a focused effort is underway to fill 
some of the policy gaps at the European level and 

to clarify the framework for postcrisis financial 

stability and the regulatory environment essential 

for allowing the financial system to resume its 

intermediation role:  Turning crisis into opportunity, policymakers 
in the EU have agreed to attempt an ambitious 

overhaul of the EU™s financial stability 
arrangements.4 While many details of the 
reforms are still under discussion, the 
European System of Financial Supervisors 
(ESFS) will bring together national supervisors 
with independent European Supervisory 
Authorities (ESAs) to coordinate rulebooks 
and supervision of cross-border institutions. 

The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is 
to bridge the gap between macro- and 
microprudential oversight and could support 
monetary policy by initiating the use of 
macroprudential regulation to mitigate 

unwanted trends in asset prices, while taking

4 For a detailed discussion, see IMF (2009b). OUTLOOK: BEYOND THE CRISIS 9  Box 1. Employment and Productivity Dynamics Around Recessions:  
Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom 
While the global financial crisis and recession have hit all of Europe™s economies, the impact has varied 
considerably across countries. Output and employment, for instance, have moved quite differently in Germany,
Spain, and the United Kingdom, three of the larger European economies. Institutions, policies, and additional 
idiosyncratic shocks are possible explanations for this 
heterogeneity. How these factors play out will affect the type of 
recovery ahead. 
To separate the roles of policies, institutions, and shocks in the 
reaction to the crisis, it is useful to compare the output and labor 
dynamics during the current cycle with the stylized historical 
behavior suggested by previous cycles. To that end, the time path 
of the change in per capita output can be broken down into 
changes in the employment rate, labor productivity, and labor 
force participation.
1 By definition, these series are interrelated: if 
employment moves in line with output, but with little change in 
the labor force, labor productivity would hold steady; in contrast, 
if employment changed little as output dropped, labor hoarding 
would take place, leading to an adjustment in hours worked per 
employee. The fact that Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom have all 
seen a significantly larger fall in output per capita than they have 
in the past illustrates the singularity of the current recession in 
Europe.
2 The contrast between previous cycles and the current 
recession is most striking in Germany (see first figure), with its 
massive drop in output in the current downturn. But perhaps 
equally striking is the degree to which the dynamics of 
employment and productivity vary among countries. 
As in past downturns, Spain had the steepest reduction in the 
employment rate, followed by the United Kingdom and 
Germany. However, current employment losses in Spain (see 
second figure)Šwhere the global crisis has coincided with the 
end of an extraordinary but unsustainable housing and 
construction boomŠhave been substantially higher than in 
previous cycles. For the United Kingdom, while employment 
losses are also higher than is typical at this point in the cycle, they 
are moderate compared to Spain. In contrast, Germany has seen 
fewer employment losses than in previous recessions.

Germany: Labor Market Dynamics Around 
Recessions
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 10  Box 1 (continued)
 The stark differences in employment responses are mirrored in 
pronounced differences in productivity dynamics. With little or 
no labor hoarding, Spanish productivity tends to grow more 
steadily and at positive rates during recessions, including the 
current one. In the United Kingdom (see third figure), 
productivity usually falls during a recession, but the decline has 
been somewhat steeper this time around.
3 The very sharp drop in 
productivity in the current recession in Germany deviates 
substantially from its historical pattern of smooth productivity 
declines. Institutional labor market flexibilityŠemployment protection in 
particularŠis often seen as highly relevant in explaining 
variations in labor adjustments to shocks.
4 Higher levels of 
employment protection tend to reduce both inflows and outflows 
into employment and can slow down labor reallocation after 
major shocks. In addition to the legislated rules, such as dismissal 
protection for regular employees or restrictions on temporary 
work agencies, their interpretation and implementation also play 
a role (OECD, 2004). In Germany, for instance, labor court 
decisions and collective bargaining agreements have tended to 
reinforce the legal restrictions.
5 And indeed, based on the 
OECD™s summary indicator of employment protection, countries 
with less employment protection have generally greater job 
destruction during a downturn but greater job creation during the 
recovery than countries with more protection (although other 
adjustment costs and their possible asymmetry will also influence 
the cyclical pattern of job destruction and creation). At nearly 
2 percent during a typical recession, the peak year-over-year 
decline in the employment rate for countries with lower 
employment protection is well outside the interquartile range for 
countries with higher protection. And, so far, job destruction in 
the current recession seems to follow the same pattern (IMF, 
2009e, Box 1.3).
6  However, the case of SpainŠwhich has large employment losses despite high employment protectionŠ
illustrates that labor market flexibility is a multifaceted concept. One factor at play is the dual nature of the  
 3  The median historical pattern for the United Kingdom masks a trend toward a more pronounced 
employment and a smaller productivity response to recessions since the 1980s. However, by some measures the 
employment adjustment during the current recession looks small compared with other recent downturns. See 
Felices (2003) and Bank of England (2009) for a more detailed discussion. 
4 Other factors include the coverage of collective bargaining agreements. See Nickell, Nunziata, and Ochel 
(2005) for a recent analysis of the role of institutions for labor market performance in Europe. 
5 Grund (2006) and Berger (1998), among others, discuss labor court behavior in Germany. 
6 The indicator weighs more than 18 dimensions of legislated and actual employment protection, including 
notification requirements, severance pay, difficulties of dismissal, minimum wage requirements for temporary 
workers, and any additional costs attached to collective dismissals.

OUTLOOK: BEYOND THE CRISIS 11 Spanish labor market, which is char
acterized by a very high share 
of employees with fixed-term contracts. At currently about 
25 percent (down from about 30 percent one year ago) overall 
and about 40 percent in the construction sector, the share of 
fixed-term workers is much higher than the EU average (table). 
As a result, employment adjusts relatively faster in Spain, as 
firms let fixed-term contracts expire or fire workers on such 
contracts, given lower and more predictable firing costs.
7 In the 
current recession, shocks such as the strong decline in 
construction activity and the steep increase in bankruptcies (see 
Figure 8) have amplified that trend. Given the high level of 
protection for permanent employees and very limited wage 
flexibility overall (reflecting, among other things, the role of 
labor unions, collective wage bargaining outcomes, and wage 
indexation), many small and medium-sized enterprises face 
bankruptcy, given the size of the adverse shock. Still, so far, 
fixed-term workers have been bearing the brunt of the overall 
employment adjustment. During the current cycle, the slower employment adjustment and 
stronger drop in productivity in Germany compared with the 
United Kingdom support the idea that labor market flexibility 
matters but that other factors are also at play. On the policy 
front, the United Kingdom has recently introduced measures to 
support employment, and Germany™s active labor market 
policies in the form of subsidies to support reductions in 
working hours while avoiding dismissals are particularly relevant. 
In addition, Germany™s production structure, which is geared 
toward high skill intensive capital goods, provides a strong 
incentive for firms to retain their employees; and a prolonged 
phase of wage moderation (supported by collective wage 
agreements that sometimes trade wage concessions for 
employment guarantees) has made such behavior less costly.

(see Box 2). 
 In addition, numerous regulatory initiatives are in 
the pipeline. Among other things, the EU has 
introduced a set of proposals to standardize 
regulation of the financial industry, including a 

legal framework for credit-rating agencies and 
hedge funds, a directive updating capital 
requirements for banks, and regulation of cross-
border payments, some of which (such as the 
treatment of non-EU entities in hedge fund 

regulation) are being intensively debated both 
within the EU and internationally. There is also a 
discussion about the usefulness of forbearance in 
accounting, where some have argued for greater 
leeway in the evaluation of crisis-impaired assets, 

while others point to the advantages of 
transparency in financial accounting.
5 Macroeconomic Policies Have Been Supportive  In response to disinflationary pressures, monetary 
policy has made full use of its conventional 
instruments. Since the beginning of the crisis, the 

ECB has lowered its policy rate by 3.25 percentage

operations to fixed-rate tenders with full allotment, 

and, in a widely observed move in June 2009, 

offered extended refinancing operations with a one-

year maturity. The liquidity operation in June was 

remarkable not only because of its size but also 
because it strongly conveyed the message that 
interest rates would stay low for a lengthy period. 

Sweden™s Riksbank, too, has explicitly 

communicated its expectation that policy rates 

would remain low as long as necessary to steer the 

economy out of the crisis. And despite the fact that 

monetary policy had to tread more carefully in 

emerging Europe, collectively Europe™s central 

banks have contributed significantly to mitigating 
the risks of an economic meltdown.  Monetary policymakers have also expanded their 
arsenal where needed to bolster the effectiveness of 

their stance. Policy rate changes have continued to 

affect markets, but weaker and slower transmission 

compared to the precrisis period prompted a search 
for means to enhance policy effectiveness (
ihák, Harjes, and Stavrev, 2009). While the Bank of 

England, similar to the Federal Reserve, has moved 

to support sovereign as well as corporate bond 

markets directly, the ECB so far has focused its 

open-market interventions on covered bonds and on 

a relatively limited scale (Meier, 2009). It has,

 These findings have a number of implications for employment during the recovery: 
 For Germany, job creation is likely to be low by historical standards as substantial labor hoarding will have 
to be unwound. Worse, job reductions are probably unavoidable unless global demand picks up more 
rapidly than envisioned. 
 A jobless recovery could also be in the cards for the United Kingdom. While lack of labor market flexibility 
is not an issue in the sense that employment protection is low, the financial crisis has hit the banking sector 
particularly hard in the United Kingdom, which typically is associated with a slow recovery (see IMF, 2009e, 
Chapter 4), and some labor hoarding will need to be worked off. 
 In Spain, although labor hoarding is less of a problem, it is unclear whether the expiration of fixed-term 
contracts will be sufficient to absorb the impact of a major housing and construction bust in the near term. 
 OUTLOOK: BEYOND THE CRISIS 13  Box 2. Asset Price Swings, Monetary Policy, and Prudential Policy: A European View 
As turmoil in the global financial markets has demonstrated, financial systems are inherently subject to cycles: 
growth in lending, leverage, and asset prices often magnify underlying economic dynamics and lead, at times, to 
a buildup of financial imbalances followed by sharp corrections. Financial cycles can, in turn, have an impact on 
the economy, both by affecting the capital adequacy of lenders and their ability to extend loans and by altering 
asset prices and collateral values and thereby impinging on the creditworthiness of borrowers. Indeed, by 
reinforcing the role of financial assets as collateral, the financial sector has the potential to amplify fluctuations 
in the business cycle and increase the impact of monetary policy shocks and movements of asset prices on real 
activity.1 Moreover, cross-border ownership of financial assets exposes financial institutions to macroeconomic, 
financial, and asset price fluctuations in other countries where they hold positions. Within Europe, although 
macrofinancial links appear particularly complex and are increasingly integrated across borders, country-specific 
characteristics, preconditions, and developments in housing and corporate finance systems account for a wide 
dispersion of responses to swings in asset prices and financial conditions in different economies.
2 What can 
European policymakers do to lessen the undesirable macroeconomic volatility associated with the dynamics of 
asset prices in the face of highly integrated and converging, but still heterogeneous national financial systems? 
Monetary Policy and Fluctuations in Asset Prices 
Many now consider that monetary policy should bear some responsibility for avoiding excessive volatility in 
asset prices. Recent empirical studies posit that monetary policy should be relatively more aggressive in 
economies whose financial markets are more developed, allowing agents to borrow more easily against financial 
wealth and build up higher stocks of private debt.
3 In a risk-management framework, such an approach would 
also need to accommodate the uncertainty about what factors are driving asset pricesŠin particular, whether 
they reflect speculative forces or changes in fundamentalsŠand their impact on the economy. It would also be 
important to apply such an approach symmetrically: while easing monetary policy may be justified when asset 
prices fall rapidly, ﬁleaning against the windﬂ by tightening during asset price booms may also prove useful in 
limiting the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances. Paying attention to developments in asset prices need not 
require a change in the formal mandates of major central banks, but could be achieved by interpreting existing 
mandates more flexibly: for instance, central banks could extend the horizon for inflation and output targets 
and pay greater attention to financial indicators and their interaction with those targets. 
  . . . continued–Note: The main authors of this box are Wim Fonteyne and Silvia Sgherri. 
1 The observation that credit-fueled booms in asset prices were particularly likely to end in financial crises is 
hardly new (Charles Kindleberger, 1978). The role of balance sheet effects and collateral in credit cycles was 
first singled out by Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and later developed by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) and 
Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999). A well-known exposition of the procyclical feature of financial systems 
is Minsky™s financial instability hypothesis (Minsky, 1992). 
2 For an in-depth cross-country study on differences in financing conditions in European economies and their 
crucial role in accounting for a dispersion of responses to a ﬁcredit squeezeﬂ across Europe, see IMF (2008). 
3 See, for instance, the recent contribution by Christiano and others (2009) for a DSGE model of the euro area 
embedding a financial accelerator mechanism and the studies by Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca (2007) and 
Iacoviello and Neri (2008) for estimated models allowing for housing financing. 
 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 14 Box 2 (concluded)
 Curbing the Buildup of Financial Imbalances Monetary policy, however, cannot do the job alone.
4 Within a currency area, the effectiveness of a single 
monetary authority in curbing the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances is necessarily limited because its 
response can focus only on area-wide aggregates and not on financial developments in each national market. 
Fiscal space permitting, countercyclical national fiscal policies that reduce the intensity of boom-and-bust cycles 
could be important in this regard. But prudential policies should play a critical role in guarding against a 
national or regional buildup of financial risk. At the same time, though, the objective of a single financial 
market and its prerequisite of establishing a level playing field argue against variations in financial regulation 
within the European Union (EU). How can the tensions between these different objectives be resolved? The key is giving prudential policies 
(regulation and supervision) a greater macroeconomic focus and increasing their effectiveness but to do so in 
ways that minimize distortions and are consistent with the objective of a single financial market. In the present 
set-up, national supervisors have struggled to keep pace with increasingly complex cross-border links within the 
EU. Many supervisors, each with its own practices and rules, can be involved in the supervision of a single 
cross-border financial conglomerate or in the supervision of a national financial market with an extensive 
foreign presence. This criss-crossing of responsibilities creates a coordination problem in two dimensions: the 
effective supervision of cross-border groups and effective prudential action to avoid a national or regional 
buildup of risk. Given the growth of cross-border activity and the increasing number of cross-border mergers 
of financial institutions, these coordination challenges have become all but insurmountable within a system 
consisting of a large number of independent national supervisors. 
Reforms of Cross-Border Arrangements for Financial Stability 
Against this background, in June 2009 the EU adopted an ambitious reform program of its cross-border 
arrangements for financial stability, comprising the establishment of two new structures: the European Systemic 
Risk Board (ESRB) and the European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS). While the ESRB will be tasked 
with identifying systemic risks and recommending ways to address them, the ESFS will seek to harmonize 
prudential rules and supervisory practices and oversee the national supervisors. On the basis of its assessments, 
the ESRB will be able to issue risk warnings and specific recommendations to the ESFS and other 
policymakers. This set-up could potentially deliver the right combination of a centralized monitoring and 
assessment of risks and a targeted and effective implementation of measures, by leveraging the advantages of 
close contact with financial firms, extensive experience, and detailed information that the national supervisors 
possess. To realize this potential, the ESRB will need to monitor developments in individual member states or 
groups of member states, respond to concerns of authorities in individual countries, and recommend tailored 
responses using the most appropriate policy tools. The ESFS will need to ensure an effective follow-up to 
ESRB advice, close cooperation so that national supervisors act together as an integrated system, and  
  4 For a more detailed discussion, see IMF (2009e, Chapter 3). 
OUTLOOK: BEYOND THE CRISIS 15  high-quality supervision of all parts of the financial system. To do so, it will need effective powers over 
national supervisors, as well as adequate tools for overseeing the work of the colleges of national supervisors 
that will organize the supervision of cross-border groups. 
Dealing with Boom-and-Bust Cycles 
How should this system deal with boom-and-bust cycles? An important part of the answer should be to 
correct the procyclical bias in bank capital requirements that conventional risk management and regulatory 
tools tend to exhibit.
5 In a system where loan loss provisions are tied to loan delinquency, cyclical variations 
in loan delinquencies affect both the capital and the capital needs of financial institutions. This feedback 
loop reinforces the magnitude of boom-bust cycles, and risks credit squeezes that turn downswings into 
financial and economic crises.
6 To mitigate these cyclical effects, some European supervisors (for example, 
in Spain) have advocated (and implemented) the use of countercyclical provisioning methodologies 
(sometimes referred to as ﬁdynamicﬂ or ﬁstatisticalﬂ), which require banks to provision more than evidenced 
by losses in good times, when the identified need for provisioning is smaller, and draw against these reserves 
in bad times, when the need for provisions is larger.
7 A harmonized system of countercyclical capital 
requirements could be an important element in resolving the EU™s financial stability conundrum. To counter 
potentially divergent national and regional developments within the EU, such a system should tie capital 
requirements to the riskiness and cyclicality of the exposures, applying equally to any EU institution that 
holds these exposures. Concretely, concerns about developments in asset prices in one or more specific 
countries should lead to increased capital requirements for all EU banks that hold related exposures, 
regardless of where these banks are headquartered. This approach would serve both the objective of 
financial integration, by allowing a single rule book and a ﬁlevel playing field,ﬂ and that of financial stability, 
by greatly reducing the scope for circumvention and regulatory arbitrage. 
  5 There is a growing literature on the potential procyclicality of the new risk-sensitive bank capital 
regulationŠknown as Basel IIŠmirroring the concern that the increase in capital requirements during 
downturns might severely contract the supply of credit. On this point, see, among others, Jokipii and Milne 
(2006), Taylor and Goodhart (2006), Saurina and Trucharte (2007), and Repullo and Suarez (2008). For 
recent policy discussions, see also Caruana and Narain (2008) and Goodhart and Persaud (2008). 
6 Borio, Furfine, and Lowe (2001) review the factors contributing to swings in credit conditions that may 
amplify macroeconomic cycles. They stress the role played by the inappropriate response of financial market 
participants to shifts in the level of riskŠespecially in its systematic componentŠas an important source of 
this amplification. Incorrect responses appear to be due not only to a misassessment of risk over time but 
also to distortive incentives likely to make financial market participants react in a socially suboptimal way. 
7 Model simulations of a decrease in procyclicality of banks™ lendingŠfollowing, for example, the 
introduction of a countercyclical element into prudential regulation of banks™ capitalŠsuggest substantial 
reductions in the volatility of investment in financially integrated economies with high stocks of private debt 
(see, for instance, Gruss and Sgherri, 2009).

.however, broadened its already very wide collateral 
list for more traditional refinancing operations to 

support security markets, including mortgage-

backed securities. While these approaches differ, 

owing, in part, to the differences in financial 
systems, the resulting increase in central bank balance sheets has been broadly similar, and the 

levels reached are equally remarkable (Figure 10). 

The associated buildup of risk in the aggregated 

public sector balance sheetŠwhich comes in 

addition to the contingent liabilities from 

government interventions in the financial sectorŠ
has raised new questions for fiscal management. 
 Fiscal policy played an important role in 
supporting the economy and forestalling a 

downward spiral in demand. The euro area-wide 

discretionary stimulus amounts to about 1 percent 

per year in 2009 and 2010. The brunt of the fiscal 

reaction, however, is provided by automatic 

stabilizers.
6 In addition, governments have made 
extensive use of the public balance sheet, 
committing to guarantee, recapitalize, and resolve 

financial institutions. Together, these measures add 
_______ 
6 The size of automatic stabilizers varies with the size of the 
budget and its elasticity with regard to the business cycle. See 

European Commission (2009a); Horton, Kumar, and Mauro 
(2009); and IMF (2009d) for a more detailed discussion of the 
fiscal reaction to the crisis. 
up to an expected accumulated deficit of almost 
16 percent of GDP over the 2008Œ10 period 

(Table 2). With an estimated overall level of financial 

sector guarantees of about 25 percent of GDP for 

the advanced economies, however, there is also a 
nonnegligible increase in contingent liabilities in the 
fiscal balance sheets. The implied challenge for fiscal 

sustainability is quite substantial, not least because 

the increase in actual and contingent public debt 

comes at a time when medium-term growth 

potential is severely weakened (see Chapter 3). In 
emerging Europe, deficits have started to increase 

more recently, but that increase is mostly an echo of 

the somewhat delayed impact of the crisis and less 
an attempt to stabilize the economy with the 
discretionary stimulus. Still, at about 10 percent, the 

expected accumulated deficit in Europe™s emerging 

economies is sizable. 
 Beyond the aggregate, the fiscal reaction across 
Europe has been quite diverse even among 
advanced economies. One source of diversity has 
been the size of financial sector interventions, where 

countries like the United Kingdom and Ireland have 

up to now provided significantly more up-front 

financing than, for instance, France or Italy. Another 

has been the fiscal room for maneuver. In general, 
among the larger EU economies, those having lower 

debt levels going into the crisisŠand thus more 

fiscal spaceŠalso show a larger increase in their 
fiscal deficit (Figure 11).

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 18 external current account deficits, and experienced 
very fast credit growth before the crisis are facing 

the need for significant adjustment. 
 To help close some external financing gaps 
created by the crisis and ease the burden of 

adjustment, the IMF, working with the EU and 
other multilateral institutions, has continued to play 

a major role in providing multilateral help. Since 

April 2009, assistance has been stepped up along 

three dimensions: 
 First, with the addition of Romania and Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, the number of countries in 

Europe covered by standby arrangements has 
been increased to eight (Table 3). 
 Second, the extension of the Flexible Credit Line 
to Poland has bolstered confidence with positive 
spillover effects throughout the region. 
 Third, financial assistance has been augmented 
and rephased to take account of downward 
revisions in growth and somewhat better-than-
envisaged developments in foreign exchange 
reserves.  While there is heterogeneity across countries, 
adjustment efforts are broadly paying off, with some 
countries making good progress in normalizing 

access to private sources of financing. Strengthening 

the banking sectors was and continues to be a 

priority in most cases. Continued engagement by 

cross-border banks and coordination of efforts with 

European institutions, the ECB, and banking 
supervisors from relevant home and host countries 
remain essential for successful adjustment. With a 
few exceptions linked to the preferences of the 
authorities, the provision of multilateral financing 

has allowed fiscal deficits to increase and social 

spending to be largely protected. Full operation of 

automatic stabilizers, however, was not always 

possible because of concerns about constraints on 

flow financing and sustainability. As the global 
recovery takes hold, financing constraints are likely 
to ease, and attention will need to turn to structural 

reforms to strengthen competitiveness. Further Policy Action Required 
 While the worst of the recession may be past, the 

recovery is far from solid, and policymakers cannot 

afford to drop their guard. To prevent a lengthy 

spell of below-potential growth, the financial system 

needs to be restored to health as soon as possible. 
Most of all, this effort requires an identification of 
capital needs and commensurate recapitalization or 

resolution and a further clarification of the postcrisis 

environment in which financial institutions are 

expected to operate. For emerging Europe, dealing 

with debt overhangs and currency mismatches 

constitutes an additional dimension. Macroeconomic 

support needs to be sustained within a credible 

framework of well-timed and well-communicated 
disengagement from extraordinary interventions, 
while for several emerging economies adjustment 

efforts need to continue, facilitated by multilateral 

assistance. Further structural reforms to raise 

potential growth are essential. More Needs to Be Done for the Financial Sector . . .  Underlying the shorter-run risks threatening the 
European recovery are the continuing troubles of 
the banking sector. While decisive policy actions 

have largely dissipated fears of a systemic 

breakdown and many banks have added to their 

capital from private and public sources, the banking

stemming from toxic assets and, increasingly, from 

bad loans tied to the recession (IMF, 2009c). 

Continuing doubts about the banks™ ability to absorb 
these losses perpetuates problems in market-based 
funding for banks. And important financing tools 

such as asset- and mortgage-backed securities and 

covered bonds remain impaired. If unaddressed, the 

need to repair balance sheets and problems on the

to the recovery as financing will remain scarce.

 OUTLOOK: BEYOND THE CRISIS 21  Box 3. Currency Mismatches in Emerging Europe 
Currency mismatches constrain policy responses and will influence the speed of recovery in many economies in 
emerging Europe. The patterns of foreign currency saving and borrowing are far from uniform across sectors 
and countries in the region. The analysis presented here shows that the resulting currency mismatches (that is, 
the difference between foreign currency borrowing and foreign currency assets as a share of total assets and 
liabilities) can be attributed mostly to cross-country differences in interest rates, exchange rate volatility, foreign 
funding of banks, institutional quality, and other country-specific variables. Policies to mitigate the impact of 
the crisis and jump-start recovery will therefore depend on country-specific circumstances. 
Background Some economies in emerging Europe have a history of de facto financial ﬁdollarization.ﬂ
1 Overall, the use of 
foreign currency in emerging Europe as a region has not been as high as, for instance, in Latin America. But 
some countries in the region are relying heavily on foreign currency, in particular for deposits, and the use of 
foreign currency in lending has increased somewhat in recent years. In line with the historical experience, use of 
foreign currency tends to be very persistent once established. Following a number of crisis episodes where de 
facto dollarization played an important role, most notably in Asia and Latin America, the view of the 
phenomenon as a mostly benign or even positive development has given way to the view that it can be a major 
source of financial fragility (see, for example, Armas, Ize, and Levy-Yeyati, 2006). 
There is a striking cross-country variation of currency mismatches in emerging Europe (first figure). For the 
corporate sector, the share of foreign currency deposits in most countries is between 20 and 50 percent of total 
deposits, while the fraction of foreign currency lending varies widely, from 10 percent to 90 percent of total 
loans. About one-third of the countries have negligible levels of foreign currency lending to households but 
have substantial differences with regard to the importance of foreign currency deposits. There is an 
intermediate group of countries where the share of foreign currency deposits has modestly outweighed foreign 
currency borrowing. The composition of credit to households in the Baltic countries, Hungary, Romania, and 
Ukraine is highly biased toward foreign currency.

1 The literature tends to use the term 
dollarization
 to describe denomination or indexation of loans and deposits 
(and other contracts) in currencies other than the domestic legal tender. In the region, the euro is the most 
commonly used foreign currency, although Swiss francŒdenominated loans are also popular in some countries 
(Hungary and Poland, for example). 
 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 22 Box 3 (continued)
 Recent trends in foreign currency borrowing have varied greatly (second figure). The Baltic countries have had 
the largest increase in foreign currency borrowing, with an equal distribution between households and the 
corporate sector. Another set of countriesŠAlbania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and UkraineŠhas had most 
of the credit growth denominated in foreign currency, and it has gone increasingly to the household sectors. 
Most of the increase has been in the form of long-term foreign exchange loans, as more than 80 percent of 
total household credit is long term (and more than half is mortgage credit). Such credit growth in the remaining 
countries has been substantially less, with moderate or negligible household borrowing in foreign currency.

 Recent trends in currency mismatches seem affected 
partly by demand-side factors. Although there has 
clearly been an increase in banks™ borrowing from 
nonresidents, which has been passed onto clients, the 
period from mid-2007 to mid-2008 was marked by 
widening interest rate spreads and lower exchange rate 
volatility (third figure) and a modest shift toward 
denomination of savings in domestic currency. 
Among the possible explanations for some of the 
currency mismatches could be a positive income 
effect: as long as the local currency is stable (or 
appreciating), borrowing in foreign currency has 
generally been less expensive than in local currency, 
and savings in local currency have ensured higher 
returns. Demand-side factors, however, seem 
insufficient to explain the wide (and persistent) variety 
in currency mismatches among countries.  
Determinants of Currency Mismatches 
To better understand how currency mismatches develop, it is useful to consider the motivation of savers, 
borrowers, and intermediaries. For savers, foreign currency deposits promise safety, especially in the context of 
(potentially) high inflation. For borrowers, foreign currency loans offer a lower cash flow burden conditional

OUTLOOK: BEYOND THE CRISIS 23 on their exchange rate expectations. For intermediaries, there is a need to balance return, credit risk, and 
funding risk. Along these lines, the literature of foreign currency savings and borrowing (Rosenberg and Tirpák, 
2008; and Scheiber and Stix, 2008, for example) points to several possible factors explaining the currency 
mismatches, including: 
 Interest rate differentials
. The relatively lower interest rate on foreign currency is typically considered a driver of 
credit growth in foreign currency in emerging economies. At the same time, interest rate differentials could 
make domestic savings more attractive. Both effects, however, depend on the presumed persistence of high 
domestic interest rates and the expectation of a stable or appreciating domestic currency (or the hope for a 
government bailout in the case of a large depreciation). For instance, fears of exchange rate depreciation 
would drive depositors toward foreign currency alternatives. 
 Exchange rate volatility.
 Consequently, some argue that credible pegged exchange rates increase foreign 
currency borrowing (Backé and Wójcik, 2007). Others (Ize and Levy Yeyati, 2003) stress that, more broadly, 
macroeconomic uncertainty (or its absence) determines the degree of de facto dollarization of an economy.
 Funding of banks in foreign currency.
 Banks in many emerging countries have had large inflows of foreign 
currency funding (often from their foreign parents), which they have passed onto their clients, possibly 
adding to interest rate differentials. 
 Institutional quality.
 High levels of institutional quality (in the form of general trust in the legal system, for 
example, or, more specifically, in the reliability of the banking system) could foster the use of domestic 
currency deposits and, at the same time, motivate foreign currency borrowing. Foreign currency borrowing 
could also increase as part of the European Union integration process (Rosenberg and Tirpák, 2008). 
 Other country-specific variables. A number of other country-specific variablesŠsuch as country size, income, 
openness to trade, various regulatory policies, or the availability of banking servicesŠcould also influence 
the use of foreign currency by the private sector. 
Empirical analysis confirms that these factors are among the main determinants of currency mismatches in 
emerging EuropeŠand the role of institutional quality is particularly intriguing. On the supply side, as 
institutional quality improves, so does the availability of foreign currency loans. The availability of such credit 
also increases as banks borrow from nonresidents and channel those funds into household and corporate 
foreign currency loans. From the demand side, improvements in institutional quality seem to increase 
depositors™ willingness to keep savings in local currency and borrowing in foreign currency. In addition, higher 
interest rate spreads tend to increase currency mismatches as savings in local currency are more profitable 
relative to foreign currency deposits and make foreign currency loans less expensive. Moreover, as exchange 
rate volatility falls, currency mismatches increase, probably as currency risks seem smaller. 
It could be that institutional quality acts as a catalyst for the other factors driving currency mismatches. Better 
institutions might have, in particular for new EU member states, improved access to funding that has been 
channeled into foreign currency loans, and especially long-term loans.
2 Higher institutional quality might also 
promote a shift to domestic currency savings if the interest rate spread increases. The impact of both these 
factors might be magnified by low exchange rate volatility. The correlation between institutional quality and 
currency mismatches and the resulting income effect (lower interest on borrowing and higher returns on 
savings), in particular for households, seem partly to explain the substantial variation across countries (fourth 
figure). 
 . . . continued–2 See Scheiber and Stix (2008) for an in-depth discussion of the importance of institutional factors. 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 24 Box 3 (concluded)
 However, even in countries with better institutional quality, 
depreciation could cause a sharp increase in bankruptcies 
and defaults. Problems with foreign currency loans and 
deposit outflows could potentially trigger a downward spiral 
for the economy as a whole. That scenario has often been 
the justification for heavy interventions in the foreign 
exchange markets, even in the large group of countries in 
which the currency mismatches are negative (savings mainly 
in foreign currency or borrowing in local currency) or the 
imbalances negligible. 
Policy Implications 
Given that currency mismatches reflect (mis)management of 
currency risk in corporations (including banks) and 
households, losses resulting from adverse exchange rate 
shocks should be absorbed by the shareholders and 
households that entered into these exposures. The policy 
challenge is how to ensure that this loss absorption does not 
threaten the stability of the financial system and the economy as a whole. In particular, if many borrowers failed 
at the same time because of an exchange rate movement, the shock could be transmitted through banks to the 
broader economy. Other concerns relate to the risk of sudden stops (especially when currency mismatches are 
driven by capital inflows), the risk that savers are vulnerable to wealth effects, and the risk that macroeconomic 
volatility will lead to massive deposit outflows. Finally, high levels of dollarization (especially of loans) make 
monetary policy more difficult, as aggregates become more volatile and reactions to policy instruments less 
predictable. The policy options include the following (for a fuller discussion, see, in particular, Armas, Ize, and Levy-Yeyati, 
2006):  Improving resolution regimes, including for banks.
 Key to reducing the cost of the crisis or recession are sufficiently 
effective procedures for loan workouts and insolvencies. Revising the whole resolution framework may be 
challenging, particularly in the aftermath of a major financial crisis or a deep recession. What may be 
feasible in the short term, however, is strengthening or introducing special resolution regimes for financial 
institutions (for example, 
ihák and Nier, 2009). 
 Facilitating debt workout mechanisms.
 If insolvencies are widespread and threaten to swamp the judicial system, 
consideration could be given to regulatory measures that facilitate creditor coordination or (Pareto 
improving) debt write-downs and, in extreme cases, to government-supported out-of-court mechanisms 
(Djankov, 2008).  Limiting future currency risks.
 Prudential measures, such as tighter limits on (unhedged) foreign currency 
exposures and higher risk-weights, could be used to discourage new dollar lending. This measure should be 
complemented by stronger disclosure requirements for banks vis-à-vis their clients regarding foreign 
exchange risks and by more rigorous stress testing for 
foreign exchange risk (including credit risk induced 
by exchange rates) by banks. Dollarization can also be discouraged by tax or reserve requirement 
differentials and by promoting inflation-indexed products. In the medium term, the best way of limiting the 
use of foreign currency may be through achieving and maintaining domestic macroeconomic stability.

score for 2008; and IMF staff calculations. 
   Notes: The income effect captures the impact of interest rate differentials 
on interest income on loans and deposits. A more positive (or less negative) 
income effect means that foreign currency deposits and loans appear 
relatively more attractive. Other things being constant, this occurs with low 
foreign currency lending rates, high local currency lending rates, high foreign 
currency deposit rates, and low local currency deposit rates.

7 This situation could also spell trouble for parent 

banks in advanced countries as ripple effects move 

across the tightly integrated region, again 

underscoring the importance of cross-border 
coordination.  To clarify the operational environment for 
financial institutions and allow them to develop a 

sustainable business model, regulatory and 

supervisory reforms need to be implemented 
urgently and coordinated internationally (IMF, 
2009c). Among other things, effective coordination of financial supervision under the new framework in 

Europe will require adequate resources for the new 

institutions, unrestricted information flow across 

borders and between the ESAs and the ESRB, and 

well-functioning decision-making mechanisms. And 

there is further need for improvement. With the 

ESRB having only the power of voice, it will be 

important to ensure that its warnings are not 
ignored during good times, when macroprudential 
regulation would be most useful. Moreover, a 

solution needs to be found to the ﬁtoo big to saveﬂ 
or ﬁtoo big to failﬂ problems without stymieing 

progress toward establishing a single financial 

market. Thus fundamental progress on a 

comprehensive cross-border crisis management 

framework will be vital and should include tools for 

early intervention and cost-sharing rules, as well as 
loss-allocation rules for private stakeholders and a 
private first line of funding to limit moral hazard 

and fiscal exposure.

the need for special resolution regimes for international financial 
institutions. required, some central banks (including the ECB 
and a number of emerging market central banks) still 

have additional room for maneuver. In addition, 

even more forceful signals that interest rates will be 

kept at very low levels for some time and further 
extension of nonstandard measures may be called 
for.9  When the recovery takes hold, monetary 
policymakers will have to turn their attention to 

exiting from an unprecedented array of 

interventions, an exit necessary to prevent 
permanent market dislocations and entrenchment of 
central banks as market substitutes. Moral hazard 

also looms large as banks have little incentive to act 

cautiously when liquidity is available cheaply in 
practically unlimited quantities or will be tempted to 

ﬁgameﬂ the various types of market interventions. 

Finally, though a remote prospect at this point, the 

vast amount of liquidity created by the expanding 

central bank balance sheets could be the harbinger 
of future inflationary pressures. 
 At the technical level, engineering a smooth exit 
once conditions are right will be feasible but needs 

to be handled with care. For instance, some of the 

unconventional measures implemented by the ECB 

will unwind automatically when economic 
conditions improve, while others have built-in 
sunset clauses or parameters that can be adjusted, 
such as the price of the extended refinancing 

operations or the eligibility and haircuts associated 

with certain collateral. Withdrawing from open-

market purchasing programs could be potentially 

more disruptive, especially in the case of the larger 

interventions as conducted by the Bank of England. 

One solution would be to hold these papers to 
maturity or sell them only very gradually, a method 
that would work slowly; another would be reverse-

repurchase agreements, which might run into the 

capacity constraints of available counterparties. The 

Bank of England and ECB, for example, also have 

the options of issuing central bank paper and 

offering additional interest-paying deposit facilities

asset purchasing plan in August 2009. 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 26 to drain excess liquidity. The most successful 
strategy, however, could be a pragmatic combination 

of these approaches. 
. . . Clearly Communicating the Exit  As central banks prepare to let unconventional 

measures run out and consider raising interest rates 

again, they will benefit from transparent 

communication about their underlying views. An 

important aspect is the uncertainty about the drop in 
potential output caused by the crisis, which might 
drive a wedge between the inflationary pressures 

anticipated by policymakers and the public™s 

expectations and could complicate monetary policy 

(see Chapter 3). For instance, if the public were less 

pessimistic about the time path of potential output 

than the central bank, an increase in interest rates 
intended to safeguard price stability could trigger 

deflationary expectations. To avoid this type of 
problem and anchor inflation expectations, central 
banks should transparently and explicitly explain 

their views on the development of potential output 

and confirm their willingness to reverse course 

should relevant new information arrive. This 

approach will help limit the risk that the exit will sap 

confidence at the wrong moment. Fiscal Policy Has to Be Sustainable As 
It Bolsters the Upswing 
 Fiscal policy needs to balance carefully its 
macroeconomic and financial sector responsibilities 

with the need to exit from the current accumulation 

of debt. While the fragility of the recovery requires 
fiscal policy to maintain its support for aggregate 

demandŠwhich will mean following through with 

planned stimuli and letting automatic stabilizers 

work for nowŠthe concerns about fiscal 
sustainability created by the crisis need to be 
addressed sooner rather than later. The problem is 

particularly urgent in Europe, because the fiscal 

fallout from the crisis comes on top of the fiscal 

costs of an aging population (European 

Commission, 2009a). Stressing these concerns, the 
current Swedish EU presidency has made fiscal 
consolidation one of its priorities for the second half 
of 2009.  Several strategies can help make this balancing act 
work:  Policymakers should shift focus from the level to the composition of the fiscal stimulus. Public 
investment projects, while taking longer to implement, typically hold greater promise for 

longer-term benefits than tax cuts or transfer 
increases. This factor argues for completing 
projects in the pipeline and concentrating any 
additional effort, if necessary, in this area. 
 Coordination of fiscal policy measures across 
Europe, both in terms of the aggregate effect and 
with respect to tax policy, will make support for 
the economy more effective and minimize exit 
distortions. Any additional expansionary 
measures should be implemented simultaneously and with an eye to cross-country differences in the remaining fiscal space; countries with less 

fiscal space should embark on fiscal 
consolidation with greater urgency. 
 Perhaps the most crucial element in the fiscal 
strategy will be to anchor the short-term support 
for the economy firmly in a credible 

consolidation strategy. For all countries, that 
strategy could mean implementing stronger fiscal rules for supporting fiscal sustainability over the 
medium term.10 For EU members, strengthening the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth 

Pact (SGP) by linking it more closely to medium-
term objectives would be helpful, as would a 
more transparent procedure for setting these 
targets and a more public commitment to 
fulfilling them. In addition to halting a 

deteriorating fiscal position, such a consolidation 
strategy would also establish the principle that 
any additional fiscal stimulus would require 
credible offsetting measures later on. 
_______ 
10 A recent example of such an initiative is the new fiscal rule 
recently introduced in Germany. Anchored in the constitution, 
the rule sets an upper limit for the structural fiscal deficit but 

allows operations of countercyclical automatic stabilizers (Mody 
and Stehn, 2009). OUTLOOK: BEYOND THE CRISIS 27 In this regard, the management of contingent 
liabilities also deserves attention. Among possible 
measures, governments should complete a thorough 
and transparent assessment of the impact of 
financial sector measures on the aggregate sovereign 
balance sheet to inform fiscal analysis and the 

budget process and to bolster public confidence in 
fiscal sustainability (see Box 4). 
Strengthening Potential Growth Is a 
Must  Recessions associated with deep financial turmoil 
tend to depress potential output significantly (IMF, 

2009e, Chapter 4). Indeed, in addition to the likely 

need to scrap excess capacity, gross capital 

formation has been weak or negative since late 2007 

(Figure 1), threatening to dent productive capacity. 

This effect is bound to be particularly strong in 

emerging Europe, as the reduction in capital inflows 

and higher and more volatile risk premiums are 
dampening investment (see Chapter 4). In addition, 
the persistence of the expected decline in 

employment could lead to an increase in structural 

unemployment if, for instance, a longer duration of 

individual unemployment spells eroded labor skills 

or if wage negotiations ignored the unemployed.11 Finally, some economies that showed exceptionally 

rapid precrisis growthŠfor instance, because of a 

larger role of the financial sector as an engine of 
growth (as in the United Kingdom), real estate and 
construction booms (as in Ireland, Spain, and the 
Baltics), or a very strong global demand for exports 

(as in Germany)Šmight be facing less favorable 

growth conditions now. As a consequence, most 

observers expect potential growth to slow 

considerably over the medium term in advanced and 

emerging Europe (see Chapter 2). 
 While some of these factors may correct 
themselves over the longer term, others tie into 

Europe™s long-standing structural rigidities. There 

are indications, for instance, that the persistence in 

employment dynamics is related to more permanent 
_______ 
11 See, for instance, Blanchard and Summers (1986) and 
Acemoglu (1995). 
labor market features, such as the presence of active 
labor market policies, collective bargaining systems, 

and legislative or labor-court based employment 

protection rules. These factors are likely to impede 

the longer-term growth potential in Europe. Strong 
employment protection also interacts with 
restrictions to market entry and other product and 

service market regulation to limit employment and 
growth in the longer run compared to the United 

States, for example.12 While some of the advances in 
productivity and growth in the United States and the United Kingdom over continental Europe might 

have reflected temporary gains in the financial 

services industry, there nonetheless seems to be 
room for improvement in Europe. For instance, 
according to the EU™s Klems database, Germany 

and France posted negative total factor productivity 

contributions to growth in the financial and business 

services sector during the 1995Œ2005 period (see 

Chapter 2).  Against this background, moving quickly to repair 
the damage caused by the crisis to potential output 

is crucial. The higher the medium-term growth 

potential, the more dynamic and robust the recovery 

can be, which should make the tasks of stabilizing 

the European banking sector, exiting from 

nonstandard monetary policies, and securing fiscal 

sustainability considerably easier. Some of the initial 

policy responses to the crisis, however, have made 
this policy gap particularly challenging to close. For 
instance, there is a risk that the ring-fencing of 

national banks will limit gains from financial market 

integration. Protecting certain national industriesŠ

such as cars, tourism, or constructionŠcould hinder 
necessary structural adjustment. And allowing 
temporary social and labor market measures to 

become permanent might foster structural 

unemployment in the future by discouraging mobility or efforts to seek reemployment. 
  To support potential growth in the longer run, 
European policymakers will have to safeguard the 

achievements of the Lisbon Agenda and create an

(2007). REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 28  Box 4. Managing Fiscal Risks Stemming from Public Interventions 
to Support Financial Systems 
While they have been instrumental in stabilizing financial systems, public interventions have contributed to an 
expansion of sovereign balance sheets and a substantial increase in exposure of governments to risk.
1 Guarantees have exposed governments to large losses in the event that the financial sector™s situation 
deteriorates further. Liquidity provisions by central banks have altered the size and structure of their balance 
sheet in terms of liquidity, maturities, currencies, and asset price volatility and have thereby exposed them, and 
eventually the governments themselves, to significant risks. Lending operations entail counterparty/default 
risks and, if they create mismatches in duration and currency composition, to interest and exchange rate risk. In 
the case of capital injections, risks relate to the uncertainty surrounding the value of the government™s residual 
claims on the institutions at the time of the capital injection, which may be smaller than what the government 
paid, and to possible future changes in the value of these claims. Last, asset purchases have exposed public 
sectors to valuation risks. 
Some features of these interventions have rendered the assessment of their fiscal impact and related risks 
difficult. As some operations have been conducted by non-government public institutions, such as central 
banks, public financial and nonfinancial institutions, many off-balance sheet operations are not directly 
reflected on the government accounts but, sooner or later, may end up on the government™s books. In addition, 
the design of support operations has often been carried out in ways that avoid affecting governments™ 
ﬁheadlineﬂ fiscal deficits, either by extending guarantees or maintaining residual claims on financial institutions. 
Estimating the value of some of the assets taken onto the public sector™s balance sheet is often very difficult. 
Although the terms of individual operations have often been reported transparently, the ensuing risks have 
rarely been made public in a systematic and integrated way. 
In this context, the following principles should guide the management of these fiscal risks: 
 Governments should conduct exhaustive assessments of the impact of measures on the sovereign balance sheet and of resulting 
fiscal risks. The balance sheet assessment should be conducted using an integrated framework (IMF, 2001), 
take a whole-of-government perspective, and focus particularly on the estimation of the fair value of assets 
and liabilities. Risk assessments require elaboration of alternative scenarios that encompass short- and long-
term costs, stress test for various macroeconomic shocks, demonstrate the consequences of different 
assumptions about prices and asset recovery rates, and make a range of assumptions about the 
materialization of contingent liabilities.  
 Information about the risks associated with public interventions should be published.
 Transparency and accountability 
will be key to maintaining confidence in fiscal solvency. A useful venue would be a comprehensive 
statement of fiscal risks, to be submitted to the legislature as part of the annual budget, the statement would 
report on the valuation of acquired assets and explic
it guarantees, including 
any difference between the purchase and the market value and estimates of potential losses.  
 Fiscal risks should be mitigated.
 In particular, risks and liabilities related to guarantees should be gradually 
transferred to the private sector, including by eliminating any subsidy component (that is, by increasing fees) 
and shifting to partial coverage or gradually reducing the coverage.

   OUTLOOK: BEYOND THE CRISIS 29   Fiscal risks should be systematically incorporated into fiscal analysis and the budget process.
 In the determination of 
fiscal targets, allowance needs to be made for the possibility that some risks will materialize (budgets, for 
example, should include reserve provisions for guarantees commensurate with expected losses). A close 
integration of fiscal risk management and the budget process calls for analyzing the fiscal sustainability 
implications of the medium- or long-term nature of many contingent liabilities. In addition, quasi-fiscal 
activities should be transferred to the government budget.
    environment that fosters structural change. Before 
the crisis, the Lisbon Agenda had brought tangible 
successes in the areas of job creation and labor 
market participation using a variety of measures, 
including more flexible labor contracts, policies to 

keep workers active in the labor market, a reduction 

in tax-based disincentives, and the provision of 
better labor matching services. Rejuvenating these 
efforts will be critical now to bolstering longer-term 

growth. In addition, there is a strong case for a 

simultaneous effort to increase labor market 

flexibility and deregulate service and product 

markets further. An added benefit of these reforms 

is that they will accelerate some of the structural  
changes necessitated by the crisis. For example, in 
emerging European economies struggling to adjust 

to stalled capital inflows, sufficiently flexible 

employment protection rules should help smooth 

the reallocation of labor to export-oriented sectors, 

while further improvements in the business 
environment could raise their attractiveness for 
foreign investment. In Germany, looking for 
additional reform opportunities in the services 

sector could help grow domestic demand. While 

some of these measures can cause near-term costs, 

the combination of enhanced structural flexibility 

and higher potential growth will be a key element in 

Europe™s answer to the crisis beyond the short run.   
      31 2. The Crisis and Potential Output   Few doubt that the crisis will have a negative effect on 
economic growth in Europe beyond the short term, but 

considerable uncertainty prevails over its magnitude. For 

countries where the financial sector contributed heavily to 

economic growth before the crisis, a continuation of historical 

levels of trend growth may be difficult, while economies relying 

on strong capital inflows could suffer a dent in their long-term 
growth or convergence process. In the medium term, the time-
varying component of potential growth could be negative in 
almost all advanced European countries. Emerging economies 

could see lower medium-term growth because of dwindling 

capital inflows and higher government debt levels. Hence, 

intensified structural reforms are crucial to alleviate some of 

these adverse effects on potential growth and, in many 

emerging economies, need to be complemented by a further 
strengthening of policy frameworks.
 Worrying About an Unobservable 
 Recessions associated with a financial crisis, such 
as the severe contraction in output that many 

European economies are currently experiencing, 

often involve large and highly persistentŠ

sometimes permanentŠoutput losses (Cerra and 
Saxena, 2008; and IMF, 2009e). Financial crises that 
include credit crunches and housing busts tend to be 

particularly severe (Claessens, Kose, and Terrones, 

2008) and, on average, last for two years with deep 

and persistent effects on asset prices, output, and 

employment, accompanied by massive increases in 

government debt (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009). The 

severity of a recession described by changes in actual 

output, however, is often insufficient for guiding the 
response of policymakers. More information is 
needed about those changes in outputŠtheir nature, 

sources, and long-term consequencesŠwhich are 

often expressed collectively as ﬁpotential outputﬂ or 
_______ 
Note: The main authors of this chapter are Thomas Harjes and 
Srobona Mitra. 
the ﬁoutput gapﬂ (that is, the percentage difference 
between potential and actual output). 
 Because potential output cannot be observed 
directly, using it as a basis for policymaking is 
inherently difficult and forces policymakers to rely 
on imperfect estimates that can cause serious policy 

errors. Several years of strong growth, for example, 

may be mistakenly interpreted as a new long-term, 

sustainable trend, which could subsequently turn out 

to be unsustainable. Emerging economies are 

particularly prone to this type of uncertainty because 

the process of catching up with the output levels of 

advanced economies is rarely a steady process but 
often involves much variation. Fiscal policymakers 
in advanced and emerging economies alike run the 

risk of interpreting short-lived booms as a new 

steady state and then fail to adjust polices quickly 

enough. For instance, some believe that uncertainty 

about potential output in the euro area and its 

economies contributed to insufficient fiscal 

consolidation and structural reform during relatively 

good times and put both the Stability and Growth 
Pact (SGP) and the Lisbon Strategy under great 
strain in the early 2000s (Cotis, Elmeskov, and 

Mourougane, 2004). Similarly, monetary policy 

errors occurred when policymakers falsely believed 

that the large recessions during the 1970s and 1980s 

had little effect on potential output and thus on the 

underlying price pressures; that miscalculation is 

another example of uncertainty about potential 

output that led to relatively high inflation in many 
economies and proved costly to correct. 
 The questions the current crisis poses for 
policymakers are not different from those raised 

during past contractions: what precisely is the effect 

of the crisis on potential output and how long will 

the effect last? Further, how uncertain are the 
answers to these questions? Over the past decades, 
new methods for estimating potential output have 

developed and broadened the underlying concepts 

of potential output. But even today, measurement of 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 32 potential output is often 
as much art as science, 
involving strong assumptions and conceptual 
choices, especially in times of severe economic 

crisis. Long-Term Effects  Will the current crisis affect Europe™s growth 
potential in the long run? The long-term effects on 
growth are often assessed by using the concept of 
trend growth or ﬁsteady-state growth.ﬂ In the 

theoretical literature, the assessment and forecasting 

of steady-state growth are based on a production 

function that brings together the contributions from 

its main inputsŠlabor, capital, and productivityŠto 

determine the time path of output. Measurement of 

labor productivityŒenhancing technological change, 
embodied in new capital goods, as well as the 
evolution of labor skills that affect productivity, is 

very difficult; and, together with other inputs (public 

sector capital, for example) that are hard to measure, 

they are usually summarized by the term 
total factor 
productivity (TFP), or the ﬁresidualﬂ in explaining 
longer-run growth. TFP is thus a key component in 
the assessment of an economy™s growth potential 

but is also the central source of uncertainty in such 
estimates, since little is known about its deep 
structural sources. 
 Nevertheless, applying the concept of growth 
accounting to European countries yields interesting 

insights into the long-term drivers of growth 

(Table 4). Three stylized facts come out of the 
growth-accounting exercise: 
 First, gross value added (GVA) in the euro area 
was increasing at 2 percent per year, a much 

lower rate than in the United States or the 
United Kingdom during 1980Œ95. The 
differences arose from hours worked with respect to the United States and from TFP 
growth with respect to the United Kingdom.  
 Second, the differences between the euro area 
and the United States and the United Kingdom 
became larger in the next decade. The euro area 
continued to grow at 2 percent, while the United 
States and the United Kingdom registered even 
higher growth rates. During this time, the United 
States outperformed in TFP growth, whereas the 
United Kingdom accumulated capitalŠand both 
showed relatively strong growth in financial 
sector GVA.  
 Third, growth in European emerging economies 
far outpaced growth in the euro area. For the 
handful of emerging economies for which 
growth accounting is available, TFP growth and 
capital accumulation held the key to the 

differences with the euro area.  Sectoral growth accounting reveals large 
differences in the sources of growth among the 

advanced countries. The effect of the crisis, 
therefore, on steady-state growth is likely to vary 
among them, especially between the euro area and 

the United Kingdom. The large differences stem 

from the contribution of finance and business 

services to overall GVA growth (Table 4 and 

Figure 12). The contribution of the financial 
industry to GVA growth for the euro area 
(0.6 percentage point) was much lower than that for 

the United Kingdom (1.6 percentage points) or for 
the United States (1.2 percentage points) in the 
decade preceding the crisis. In fact, TFP growth in 

the financial industry in the euro area was negative,

   1/ Due to data limitations, the euro area only includes the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany,
 Italy, 
Netherlands, and Spain. Slovenia and Slovak Republic have been added to New Member States since they are very recent entrants t
othe euro area.
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 34 led by Germany, France, and Italy, in contrast to the 
relatively large contribution of TFP in the financial 

industry to total productivity growth in the United 
Kingdom and the United States.  While the differences indicate some unused 
growth potential in the euro area financial industry, 

they are also likely to signal a certain unsustainability 

of financial sector growth in the Anglo-Saxon 

countries: large and extraordinary profits might have 

distorted TFP growth in the United States and the 

United Kingdom. With the disappearance of these 
exaggerated profits in the financial sector, long-term 
growth in the United Kingdom will probably suffer 

more than that in the euro area. Most likely, the euro 

area will return to its steady-state growth of about 

2 percent in the long term following the crisis, with 

some upside potentialŠfor instance, if financial 

sector TFP growth returns to positive levels in the 

long run.  In general, applying the concept of steady-state 
growth to emerging economies is far from 
straightforward. Clearly, TFP growth tends to be 

higher in emerging than in advanced Europe, where 

investment in new technologies and capital 

equipment can still significantly accelerate the 

convergence process. That very process, however, 
complicates the analysis, and, unlike in the advanced 
countries, past growth in overall GVA is not easily 

interpreted as steady-state growth. Indeed, countries 

with lower incomes at the beginning of the 

transition tended to grow faster. For instance, the 

Czech Republic, which has recently been reclassified 

as an advanced country, grew at an average of 

2.7 percent per year before the current crisis, 

whereas Estonia, which had a much lower initial 
income than the Czech Republic, was growing at close to 7 percent (Table 4).  Growth in GVA in the financial sector in the 
decade preceding the crisis stands out in the 

emerging economies. In general, a higher growth 

contribution from the services sector is not 
surprising during a period still influenced by the transition from a planned to a market economy. 

However, there are also notable differences among 
countries. In Latvia, for instance, the contribution of 
GVA in the finance and business services to overall 

GVA growth is relatively large. The financial 

industry in Estonia, though, grew less than overall 

industry, while in the Slovak Republic it did not 
grow at all. In other emerging markets for which 
data are available, the contribution of this sector was 

moderate. As in the advanced countries, the 

emerging economies in which the role of the 

financial sector in overall growth is relatively larger 

are likely to suffer more from the crisis. It is now 

clear, through hindsight, that growth in this sector 

was unsustainable and largely dependent on rapid 

growth in real estate services and other nontradable 
sectors.  The crisis, however, could slow the catching-up 
process in emerging Europe and lower its growth 

potential in the future, especially if capital inflows 

dwindle (Box 5). The slowdown will be more 

intense in poorer countries, which, over the past 
decade have been profiting from ﬁdownhillﬂ capital 
flowsŠthat is, from rich to poor countriesŠ

reinforcing the process of income convergence 

(Abiad, Leigh, and Mody, 2009). Relatively higher 

degrees of financial integration seem to have 

attracted capital from richer countries in particular 

in the financial and real estate sectors.
13 Medium-Term Effects  For several reasons, the short- and medium-term 

effects of the current crisis might well exceed their 
longer-term impact. All components of the 
production function are subject to medium-term 

swings around their steady-state levels, because 
investment declines and structural unemployment 

often increases as recessions hit, with a temporary 

yet persistent effect on potential output. Recessions 

associated with financial crises have especially severe 

impacts on medium-term growth, if accompanied by _______ 
13 Mirroring the argument for advanced European economies, 
not all of these inflows will have been translated into sustainable 
productivity increases. In many emerging European countries, 

the value added in the finance and business services area far 
outpaced overall value added (Figure 12). 
THE CRISIS AND POTENTIAL OUTPUT 35  Box 5. Risks to Medium-Term Growth and Convergence in Emerging Europe 
It is well established that greater financial integration helped European countries converge to higher income 
levels faster than the rest of the world (Abiad, Leigh, and Mody, 2009). Greater financial linkages within 
Europe and prevalence of foreign-owned banks in emerging Europe are reasons behind the larger volumes of 
bank-intermediated flows in Europe compared to the rest of the world. Thus, medium-term risks to potential 
growth from the financial crisis in the region mainly arise from reduced capital inflows. Both FDI and bank-
related inflows are instrumental in helping these countries converge to higher income levels of their Western 
European neighbors, facilitated by higher financial and trade integration. The medium-term growth effects of 
capital inflows and other factors can be gauged by estimating a growth model with the usual determinants 
found in the literature (Vamvakidis, 2008; Abiad, Leigh, and Mody, 2009; and Schadler and others, 2006). 
Although growth regressions of this type have a number of well-known shortcomings, they provide a useful 
simple framework for analyzing the effects of the crisis. Applying the coefficients of the estimated model, a 
scenario analysis focuses on the variables most likely to be adversely affected in this crisis, based on the 
World 
Economic Outlook
 (WEO) forecasts of these variables over 2008Œ14 for the emerging economies. 
Gross fixed investment, inflows of foreign direct 
investment (FDI) and other bank-related capital 
inflows are among the growth determinants most 
likely to be adversely affected in this crisis (see table), 
for instance if foreign investors readjust their risk 
perception or domestic demand declines, including 
due to credit constraints. The large increases in 
government debt due to cyclical factors and public-
intervention policies during the crisis will also weigh 
on overall growth via crowding-out effects. The 
growth regression is based on 4-year average panel 
data (1996Œ99, 2000Œ03, 2004Œ07) for 98 countries 
and a number of additional standard growth 
determinants unlikely to have been affected by the 
crisis. The ﬁEuropeanﬂ effects are captured by level 
and interactions of the dummy for Europe 
(EUROPE). In particular, the following model is estimated:

 again with a larger European effect. Other growth determinants captured in the vector 
it include gross fixed 
investment in percent of GDP, which is highly correlated with FDI and bank flows and does not have a 
significant additional effect. 
The regression can be used for scenario analysis. Based on the estimated model, the effect on average growth is 
computed by calculating the average fall in FDI and the average increase in government debt/GDP from WEO 
projections for 2008Œ14. For instance, the drop in average 
FDI between 2004Œ2007 and 2008Œ14 is 49 percent, and the 
increase in government debt/GDP is 35 percent. In the 
absence of WEO projections on bank-related capital 
inflows, the percentage for FDI drop is applied to bank-
flows as well. These ratios are then applied to the 2004Œ07 
average ratios of the three variables for each of the 
countries, and the effect on average growth for 2008Œ14 is 
computed. Based on this simulation, the crisis could reduce medium-
term growth by 0.6Œ2.5 percentage points in the NMS and 
by 0.4Œ2.2 percentage points in the other emerging 
economies (figure). By design, countries in which capital 
inflows had a larger role in GDP and are relatively poor are 
likely to experience a stronger adverse effect on average 
growth in 2008Œ14, a result consistent with the finding that 
countries with high precrisis investment-to-GDP ratios tend 
to have large output losses (IMF, 2009e).  
  credit crunches and real estate bubble busts, and 
have a persistently adverse effect on output (Cerra 

and Saxena, 2008; Claessens, Kose and Terrones, 
2008; and IMF, 2009e). Thus, the next five to seven years are likely to see large drops in growth rates 

followed by a recovery driven by time-varying 

potential growth around its long-run steady state. 

The medium term is also the relevant horizon for 

monetary policymakers, and most of the fiscal costs 

of the crisis (from financial sector intervention, 

stimulus expenditure, and cyclical adjustments) will 
be determined during this time. 
 Although European experts and policymakers 
agree that potential output in advanced countries is 

likely to fall as a result of the financial crisis and the 

consequent deep global recession, the degree of its 

decline is far from certain. A recent study published 
by the OECD (Furceri and Mourougane, 2009), for 
instance, estimates that the permanent reduction in 

potential output due to typical financial crises is 
between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, with even 
higher losses for particularly deep crises. While these 

estimates are high, they also indicate substantial 

variation among countries, a point also stressed in 

IMF (2009e). According to the forecasts by the 

European Commission (2009c), the growth of 

potential output in the euro area could decline to 

0.7 percent during 2009Œ10, from 1.8 percent during 
2000Œ06, indicating a loss of more than 1 percent 
per year relative to the precrisis developments. 
Recent estimates based on a European Commission 

simulation model put the estimated loss at anywhere 

from 0.5 percent to about 4.5 percent, depending on 

the scenario (Koopman and Székely, 2009). One

   1/ Based on growth regression (table). Scenario: 49 percent fall in FDI/GDP 
(FDI) and bank-related inflows and a 35 percent rise in government debt/GDP

the same percent to bank-flows and the average increase in DEBT over the same 
period and applying them to the other countries. 
THE CRISIS AND POTENTIAL OUTPUT 37 reason for such divergence is that the current 
economic and financial crisis is a unique event. 

Another is that it is not easy to distinguish medium-

term movements in potential from other, shorter-

term fluctuations in output. 
 With a focus on the euro area as an example, 
standard statistical methodologies for calculating 

medium-term potential output, such as the HP filter, 

generally confirm that potential growth turned 

negative in 2008:Q4Œ2009:Q1, but the extent of the 

drop varies widely (Figure 13). Despite falling 
potential growth, the euro area output gap (that is, 
the percentage difference between estimated 

potential and observed output) opened widely in 

early 2009 with the continued sharp drop in actual 

output (Table 5). The HP filter, however, renders 

real-time estimates of potential output at the end of 
the sample period imprecise if a persistent shock has 

recently occurred. A simple method for avoiding 

such end-of-sample problems is to extend the 
sample using forecasts of GDP. The forecast-adjusted HP filter tracks the sharply falling potential 

growth since 2007, taking into account the expected 

persistence of the dramatic fall of output growth in 

2009 and the sluggish recovery from 2010. 
 Monetary policymakers are primarily interested in 
the level of output that avoids pressure for inflation 
to either increase or decrease. Conceptually, this 

calculation requires an approach to potential output 
different from that captured by simple statistical 
trends (see also Chapter 3). For example, following a 
standard methodology derived from New Keynesian 

Models (NKM), potential output is defined as the 

hypothetical, flexible-price equilibrium output that 
would be produced in the absence of price and wage 
rigidities. NKM potential output is more volatile 
than an HP-filtered trend because it also reflects the 

reaction of potential output to short-term, transitory 

aggregate supply shocks, depending, among other 

things, on the elasticity of labor supply (Basu and 

Fernald, 2009).14 Estimating potential growth for the 
_______ 
14 For discussions of the NKM, see, for instance, Coenen, 
Smets, and Vetlov (2009); Woodford (2003); Justiniano and 
Primiceri (2008); and Weidner and Williams (2009). Kuttner 
(continued) euro area using these different methods illustrates 
this point (Figure 13).
15   Although the output gap in 2009:Q1 (the most 
recent reading) from all estimates is large and 

negative, its size varies widely (Table 5). For 

instance, the simple HP-filtered estimates point to a 

rapidly widening output gap at the end of the 

sample. In contrast, the 2009:Q1 gap for the 

forecast-adjusted HP filter is much smaller, 
reflecting the sharp drop in potential growth 

(Figure 13). The latter is picking up the drastic fall in 
GDP forecast for 2009, followed by a very modest 
recovery in 2010. The NKM-based output gap for 

2009:Q1 is large compared to the forecast-based. 

HP-filtered estimate, which reflects the smaller and 

less persistent drop in the estimate of potential 

growth.  Differences in country-specific and sometimes in 
methodological factors lead to large variations in 

estimates of how the crisis will affect potential 
_________________________________________ 
(1994) and Laubach and Williams (2003) discuss the volatility of NKM potential output. In the long run, flexible-price potential 
output should converge to the long-term trend or steady-state 
output, but over shorter horizons they could be very different, 
even if the latter included some time-varying component 
captured, for instance, by statistical filters. 15 The estimates are based on a simple NKM model for the euro 
area estimated using Bayesian methods and the Kalman filter.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 38  growth for individual countries. As for the aggregate 
euro area, however, potential growth is projected to 

fall over the medium term in most of the large, 

advanced European countries as well (Box 6). The 

projected potential losses in output vary between 

½ percent and 5½ percent in 2009, with larger 

drops in countries suffering from deflated booms in 
the financial or construction industry (or in both)Š
for instance, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and the United 

Kingdom.  For Europe™s emerging economies that are still 
converging toward some steady state, risks to 

potential growth mainly stems from reduced capital 
inflows that the region has, so far, depended upon 
(Box 5). The relevant question here is: what could 

go wrong in the crisis that could also affect medium-

term growth and convergence in emerging Europe? 

Simulations from an econometric growth model 

suggest that lower foreign direct investment (FDI) 
and bank-related inflows (for example, those from 
foreign parent banks to eastern European 

subsidiaries) and higher government debt stemming from the crisis could shave medium-term growth by 
0.6Œ2.5 percentage points in the New Member 
States and by 0.4Œ2.2 in the other emerging 

economies. Countries in which capital inflows had a 

larger role in GDP and are relatively poor are likely 

to experience a stronger adverse effect on average 

growth in 2008Œ14. Still, average growth in the 

emerging economies is likely to be higher than in the 

advanced economies, mainly because convergence 
will probably continue at some level. 
Policy Implications 
 Further structural reforms remain a priority, 
particularly in the euro area. Beyond the medium 

term, the large advanced economies in the euro area 

should return to their historical levels of potential 

(or steady-state) growth of about 2 percent on 

average, with some variation reflecting country-

specific demographics. The historical difference 
between TFP growth in the euro area and in the 
United States, however, suggests that there are 

incentives and scope for structural reform, even 

though some TFP growth in the United States 

during 1995Œ2005 could have been distorted by 
exaggerated profits in the financial and the 

information and technology sectors. 
 The EU™s Lisbon Agenda is a useful template for 
such reforms (European Commission, 2005, 2007), 

with policy implications for all countries. A number 

of important items are on the broader reform 

agenda: 
 promoting education and training of the labor 
force;   modernizing social protection systems, including 
pensions and health care, to ensure their social 
adequacy, financial sustainability, and 
responsiveness to changing needs and to support 
labor force participation and better retention in 
employment;

THE CRISIS AND POTENTIAL OUTPUT  39   Box 6. Effect of the Financial Crisis on Potential Growth in Western Europe 
While there is little doubt that the financial crisis will adversely affect the growth potential of Europe, it is 
difficult to estimate its impact precisely. Nor will applying standardized or uniform methodologies (for 
example, HP filters) likely be able to capture the differing elements that weigh on the growth potential of 
individual countries. Hence, IMF staff uses an approach that allows level and growth rate effects on potential 
output estimates to reflect country-specific circumstances. In addition, the extent to which potential output 
losses will be recovered in the longer term is quite uncertain. With that caveat in mind, illustrating the diverse 
impact of the financial crisis on the near-term growth potential 
of countries in Western Europe nonetheless provides insight. 
IMF staff currently projects a slowdown in the growth of 
potential output across the region, including some contractions 
in the level of potential output (first figure). The extent of the 
slowdown varies widely, ranging from ½ percent to 5½ percent 
between 2007 and 2009. The sharpest slowdowns are expected 
in countries where the crisis is likely to require large structural 
adjustment, for instance, when precrisis growth reflected 
unsustainable contributions from certain sectors. In other 
countries, continued weakness in investment and in the labor 
market is expected to reduce potential output.  
Extreme expansions of the financial and construction sectors 
will partly unwind, subtracting from potential output (second 
figure). In Ireland, in particular, both the financial and the construction sectors expanded rapidly going into the 
crisis. Growth in Iceland, the United Kingdom, and Portugal was founded on a booming financial sector; 
growth in Spain, on a construction boom. These sectors are unlikely to recover to their precrisis strength in the 
medium term.

 A structural adjustment to a more balanced growth path might also reduce potential output. For example, 
heavy reliance on export-driven growth has expanded the German export sector, including car production, 
at the expense of the nontradables sector. With global imbalances unwinding, a downward correction in

 Next to their longer-term effects, some of these 
measures will also favorably affect the medium 

term. For instance, labor force training would 
prevent the loss of skills that usually accompanies 
people who leave the labor force during a 

recession. Job training is particularly welcome, as 

it can foster labor mobility and prevent skill 

erosion during a period where longer 

unemployment spells threaten to turn cyclical into

repercussions for potential output. 
 In addition, sound policies that maintain the 
momentum toward convergence are essential for 
emerging economies. To secure the capital inflows 

required for a smooth continuation of the 

convergence process, governments will need to 

ensure a business-friendly environment, 
strengthen policy frameworks that reduce political 
uncertainty, further support integration of 

financial markets and provide macroeconomic 

stability (Abiad, Leigh, and Mody, 2009). In many 
emerging economies, policymakers will face the 

additional burden of very volatile exchange rates 

and financing costs against the backdrop of high 

government debt and fiscal deficits. Improving 

frameworks for fiscal policy and boosting their 
transparency could help reduce the volatility of the 
business cycle and improve growth prospects (see 

Chapter 4).  -15

41 3. Implications of the Fall in Potential Output for Macroeconomic Policies   Potential output is falling in the aftermath of the crisis, 
although the extent of the drop is uncertain. Monetary 

policymakers should take into account the reduction in 
potential output and the surrounding uncertainty by clearly 
communicating their views on potential output and their intent 

to adjust as new information becomes available. This 

approach will help anchor expectations for inflation and limit 

the costs of policy mistakes. Fiscal policy has to absorb the 
double blow dealt by the crisis to potential growth and debt 

levels. Even under very benign assumptions about the path of 

potential output, the required fiscal adjustment will be large, 

suggesting that policymakers should err on the side of caution 
and start the necessary consolidation as soon as the state of the 
cycle allows.  The fall in potential output and the uncertainty 
around the degree of its decline (see Chapter 2) add to an already challenging policy environment, even 

though the concept of potential output varies 

slightly with the policy goal. For monetary policy, 

the relevant concept is the economy™s output at full 

capacity, taking into account fluctuations in 

productivity.
17 In the medium and longer term, these fluctuations play a smaller role, and the relevant 

concept becomes full capacity output in the long 
run. The impact of the crisis, however, is likely to be 
large enough to dominate in either case and will thus 

create decision problems for monetary and fiscal 
policymakers alike. On the one hand, for instance, if 

fiscal policy neglects or underestimates the decline, it 

could put the sustainability of public finances at risk. 
_______ 
Note: The main authors of this chapters are Helge Berger and 
Emil Stavrev. 17 This is the so-called flexible price potential output rooted in 
the standard macroeconomic literature but often difficult to 
identify empirically. Coenen, Smets, and Vetlov (2009)Šusing a 

large-scale model developed by ECB staffŠfind that the flexible price output gap (that is, the percentage difference between actual and flexible price potential output) for the euro 
area displays larger fluctuations than some conventional 

statistical or longer-term measures of the output gap. 
On the other hand, overestimating the drop in 
potential might mean withholding needed fiscal 

support from the economy. Similarly, if monetary 
policy overestimates the decline in potential output 
in the short run, it risks being overly restrictive, 

while underestimating the drop in potential might 

lead to an overly permissive policy stance and open 

the door to inflationary pressures (OECD, 2008). In 

addition, these uncertainties could allow 

policymakers and the public to draw different 

conclusions about the direction of potential output, 

further complicating policy choices. 
 The uncertainty surrounding potential output has 
important implications for macroeconomic policy as 

well. In dealing with this uncertainty, central banks 
will profit from reinforcing their commitment to 

price stability to anchor expectations as well as to 

limit the costs of possible policy mistakes as they 

maneuver past the trough of the crisis. Fiscal policy 
will be well advised to err on the side of caution and 
plan for a sizable and early adjustment to regain the 

fiscal space lost to the crisis. And both fiscal and 

monetary policymakers will benefit from being 

transparent in communicating their views about the 

potential output and the output gap and the way 

these views inform their policy decisions. 
Crisis Impact on Monetary Policy 
 While information on potential output is an 

important ingredient in monetary policy decisions, it 
is also notoriously hard to pin down with great 
accuracy. Most conventional macroeconomic 

models associate an increase in actual output relative 

to potential output (that is, an increase in the output 

gap, the percentage deviation of the actual level of 

output from its potential) with higher inflation and 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 42 vice versa.18 The underlying argument is that price-setting firms tend to increase prices in line with 

marginal costs and, by extension, the output gap. 

Because many firms operate in a forward-looking 

manner, inflation reflects their current and future beliefs about the output gap. Consequently, central 
banks spend considerable time trying to produce 

reliable estimates and forecasts of the output gap to 

inform their monetary policy decisions. By accounts 

of monetary policy practitioners and academics 

alike, though, this task has proved difficult.
19 Estimates of present or future output gaps are 

bedeviled by limits to data availability in real time, 

large data revisions, the general imponderability of 
forecasting, and conceptual problems, including the 
fact that the output gap at the same time influences 

the economy and is influenced by it. 
 Dealing with Uncertainty 
 The uncertainty around estimates of the real-time 

output gap is high and has likely increased 

significantly as a result of the crisis.
20 A comparison of simple filter-based quasi ﬁreal-timeﬂ estimates of 

the output gap in the euro area to the actual or 

ﬁtrueﬂ gap computed with the advantage of 

hindsight over a longer period provides a clear 
_______ 
18 See Woodford (2003) and Galí (2008), among others, for a 
discussion. 19 See, among others, Orphanides and others (2000); 
Orphanides (2001); Orphanides and van Norden (2002); 
Orphanides and Williams (2003); Musso and Westermann 

(2005); Proietti, Musso, and Westermann (2007); and Weidner 
and Williams (2009). 
20 The uncertainty around output gap estimates is further 
exacerbated by the difficulty in disentangling in real time the 
type of shocks hitting the economy (permanent supply shocks 

versus cyclical demand fluctuations). For example, potential 
growth may be lower for a protracted period of time following 
the crisis, as resources from sectors that were affected by the 

crisis get allocated to other productive spheres. Indeed, given 
structural rigidities in the euro area, most analysts anticipate a 
prolonged impact of the crisis on the economy working mostly 

through the supply channel. Nevertheless, the long-run growth 
potential of the euro area is not expected to be significantly 
altered. In addition, the financial crisis may have affected 

monetary policymaking in other ways, for instance, by changing 
the effectiveness of transmission channels (see, for example, 
ihák, Harjes, and Stavrev, 2009). -3.0

21 The real-time estimate is 
based only on data that could have been available to 

policymakers at the time, ignoring data revisions. By 

construction, the estimated real-time gaps will be 

less accurate, especially around turning points of the 
true series, which the real-time approach will often 
miss.22  This example shows that the real-time judgment 
includes a sizable and quite persistent error (for 
example, the unconditional standard deviation of the 

error is almost 1 percentage point and its 
autoregressive coefficient is about 0.9). Moreover, 
because at times the real-time output gap takes the 

opposite sign of the true gap, it could potentially 

lead policymakers to mistake the direction of price 

pressures. Against this background, especially given 

the ambiguity about the impact of the crisis on 
_______ 
21 The quasi ﬁreal-timeﬂ output gap is calculated in the following way. In a first step, the full sample of real GDP (1970:Q1 to 
2009:Q1) is split in two parts, with 1993:Q1 assumed to be the 
last observation from the point of view of policymakers. 
Policymakers then compute the real-time output gap for that 
quarter as the log difference between the actual output and its 
Hodrick-Prescott filtered value over the period 1970:Q1Œ
1993:Q1. When new real GDP data arrives the following 
quarter, the exercise is repeated until, eventually, 2007:Q2 is 
reached. The true output gap is estimated over the full sample 
(1970:Q1Œ2009:Q1), but the comparison of the real-time output 
gap and the true gap ends with 2007:Q2 to alleviate end-of-
sample problems in estimating the true output gap. 
22 Extending the data used for the real-time filtering exercise 
with available forecasts mitigates but does not solve the 
problem in practiceŠsee, for instance, the discussion in Cotis, 

Elmeskov, and Mourougane (2004). 
IMPLICATIONS OF THE FALL IN POTENTIAL OUTPUT FOR MACROECONOMIC POLICIES 
43 financial intermediation, the heightened uncertainty 
over recent estimates of the output gap and 

forecasts is hardly surprising (see Chapter 2). 
 Policymakers thus face a difficult taskŠ
separating the information contained in measures of 

potential output from the noise surrounding it. In 

practice, a central bank looks at a wide array of 

economic and monetary indicators, cross-checking 

the information where possible (see, for example, 

ECB, 2004; and Fischer and others, 2008). Including 

measures of the output gap could add crucial 
information on existing and future threats to price 
stability; at the same time, the information can be 

imprecise or misleading. In addition, that uncertainty 

can lead to diverging views on the state of the 

economy. For instance, if the views of the central 

bank and those of the general public are not in 

accord, such differences could drive an 

informational wedge between  price setters and 

policymakers (Gorodnichenko and Shapiro, 2007).
23 Although this discussion is ongoing, many observers 
agree that the output gap should inform monetary 

policymaking even in the presence of exceptional 

uncertainty. For example, Orphanides and others 

(2000) using data on historical revisions to real-time 

estimates of the output gap in the United States, 

show that it is usually optimal to place some weight 

on the output gap when decisions on the course of 

monetary policy are being made, even in the 
presence of measurement error. Ehrmann and Smets (2003) come to a similar conclusion based on 

a calibrated model of the euro area with incomplete 

information about potential output.
24 _______ 
23 Heterogeneity in beliefs is a very practical concern. For 
instance, Berger, Ehrmann, and Fratzscher (forthcoming) identify persistent heterogeneity in interest rate forecasting 
accuracy of ECB watchers, which, in part, can be traced back to 
locational factors, including regional economic conditions and 

differences in forecasting models. Beck, Hubrich, and 
Marcellino (2009) show that inflation differences in the euro 
area remain sizable and that only about half the variation in 
inflation rates in a selected sample of euro area countries is 
accounted for by area-wide factors. 
24 Ehrmann and Smets (2003) also show that, while it may be 
optimal to reduce the weight put on the output gap in the 
presence of informational problems, conventional Taylor-type 

approaches continue to perform relatively well. 
 Simulations with a standard macroeconomic 
model fitted to euro area data illustrate that it is 
costly for policymakers to ignore the output gap, 

even in the face of uncertainty.
25 In the simulation, monetary policy is assumed to set interest rates 
conditional on inflation and the output gap, but 
owing to potential uncertainty over output, the 

perception of the private sector of the actual size of 

the output gap can temporarily deviate from that of 

the central bank (Table 6).
26 Reinforcing the findings 
discussed above, the economy appears to be better 

off if monetary policy reacts to the output gap than 

if it does notŠjudged by the higher volatility of 

inflation and the output gap to shocks to interest 
rates, inflation, or the output gap, when the output gap is not taken into account. 
 That said, reacting to an uncertain drop in 
potential output under current circumstances 

remains risky, and the likelihood of a costly policy 

mistake is significant. If, for some reason, monetary 
policymakers were overly optimistic about potential 
output, they would tend to overestimate the output 

gap (that is, to see actual output further below 

potential than it actually would be) and set interest 

rates too low compared to what they would do if 

they knew the path of potential output with 

certainty. Conversely, interest rates would be set too _______ 
25 The exercise is based on a standard dynamic stochastic 
general equilibrium model. It comprises forward-looking but persistent Phillips curve and aggregate demand equations and a Taylor-type reaction function c
onditioning the nominal interest 
rate on deviations of inflation from its target and the output 

gap. Potential output estimates are model consistent. The model 
is estimated using Bayesian techniques on euro area quarterly 
data from 1993Q1 to 2007:Q2, avoiding the current crisis 
period. 26 A zero-mean autoregressive term is added to the output gap 
term in the Phillips curve equation, allowing prices to evolve 
temporarily according to the public™s beliefs about the output 

gap, while policymakers react to their own estimates of the 
output gap. The difference in beliefs is common knowledge.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 44 high if potential output were viewed too pessimistically and the output gap underestimated. 
A simulation with the model for the euro area is 

illustrative: when the central bank underestimates 

the output gap by 0.5 percentage point relative to 
the public™s view, monetary policy is tighter, and 
interest rates are higher by about 150 basis points 
over a year, while inflation is lower by 

0.7 percentage point. 
Anchoring Expectations  If reacting to the available information on 

potential output remains optimal even under 
uncertainty and policy mistakes cannot be avoided 

per se, the key question becomes how to minimize 

their costs.  One way is for central banks to communicate 
forcefully their commitment to maintaining price 

stability in the context of the current uncertainty. 

Indeed, ﬁprice stabilityﬂ is the primary goal of most 

European monetary policymakers, including, for 

example, the European Central Bank (ECB), the 
Bank of England (BoE), Sweden™s Riksbank (RB), 

and Narodowy Bank Polski (NBP), the Polish 

central bank. For policy purposes, while all interpret 
price stability as maintaining a specific rate of 
inflation, they differ in the degree to which they are 

ready to tolerate deviations from the target. The 
NBP and the RB allow inflation fluctuations within 

a +1/Œ1 percentage point band around their target 

values. In the case of the BoE, if the target is missed 
by more than 1 percentage point on either side, the 

governor must write an open letter to the chancellor 

explaining the reasons for the deviation and how the 
bank will ensure that inflation returns to the target 
within a reasonable time period without creating 

undue instability in the economy. And the ECB, 

while not having a formal band, is committed to 
keeping inflation ﬁjust below but close to 2 percentﬂ 

over the medium term.  Under the present circumstances, reinforcing the 
central bank™s commitment to price stability 
(focusing specifically on the repercussions of 

uncertainty about the output gap on inflation) would 
help anchor inflation expectations more firmly and 
more closely align the beliefs of the central bank and 

those of the public about the actual output gap 

(Gorodnichenko and Shapiro, 2007).  In practice, this approach would require a specific 
communication effort, implying, in particular, that 

the central bank make transparent its views on the 

development of potential output upon which it is 

basing current monetary policy decisions and 

announce clearly its willingness to adjust these views 

in light of new information and to act upon it to 
ensure price stability.
27 An effort along these lines 
would seem especially helpful in transitioning from 

the current policy stance of very low interest rates 
while avoiding  unwittingly creating deflationary 

expectations.
28  A simulation exercise for the euro area illustrates 
the argument (Figure 15). Following an adverse 
shock to the output gap, the public is assumed to 

believe that the gap has declined by more than the 

central bank does. The simulation results show that 

the central bank will need to decrease interest rates 
by less while securing lower rates of disinflation and 
can reverse its course sooner when it is more 
strongly committed to maintaining price stability by explicitly signaling its willingness to adjust course as 
new information accrues. The reason for this outcome is that forward-looking price setters will 
_______ 
27 Note that given the sizable increase in the central banks™ 
balance sheets as a result of the implementation of various 
unconventional measures, a reversal of the monetary policy 
stance before their expiration could be costly. Nevertheless, 
policymakers would need to be ready to bear such costs in order 

not to compromise the primary goal of monetary policy to 

maintain price stability. 
28 For instance, the ECB™s regular ﬁeconomic analysisﬂ provides a useful avenue for such a specific communication. In particular, 
at the time of the exit, the ECB would need to explain in its 
ﬁeconomic analysisﬂ that the decision to raise interest rates was 
based, among other things, on strong indications for inflationary 

pressures over the policy horizon due to an exceptionally steep 

decline in potential output compared to its precrisis trend, while, 
at the same time, emphasizing the uncertainty around these 
indications and its readiness to avoid any excessive tightening

in potential. IMPLICATIONS OF THE FALL IN POTENTIAL OUTPUT FOR MACROECONOMIC POLICIES 
45  limit any downward price revisions anticipating that 
differences in views on the development of the 

output gap will eventually be resolved and price 

stability achieved. 
Implications for Monetary Policy 
 Most of Europe™s monetary policymakers have 

reacted to the financial turmoil and the ensuing 

recession by bringing the policy rates to record lows 

(Figure 16) and by deploying various unconventional 

measures (see Chapter 1). This reaction reflects, in 

part, the conviction that, while the crisis has 
diminished potential output across the region, actual 
output has declined even faster, opening up a 

sizeable and lasting output gap and resulting in 

strong disinflationary pressures. As conditions in the 

financial system normalize and recovery takes hold, 

monetary policy will need to gradually turn less 

expansionary and eventually become restrictive to 

safeguard price stability.  The speed of this adjustment will, among other 
considerations, depend on central banks™ views on 

theŠuncertainŠpath of potential output. Other 

things being equal, interest rates should increase 

faster if there is reason to believe that the crisis has 

significantly reduced potential output. Monetary 

policymakers thus face the problem illustrated 
above: gauging the impact of the crisis remains 
difficult, but ignoring the possibility of changes to 

potential output could be costly.

 To mitigate the problem of dealing with the 
increased uncertainty around potential output, 

policymakers should put a higher premium on two 

important aspects of monetary policy: 

(1) understanding the true nature of the fall in

caused; and (2) strongly communicating their views

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 46 Impact of the Crisis on Fiscal Policy 
 Just like monetary policymakers, governments 
across Europe have reasons to worry about the 

impact of a decline in potential growth on fiscal 

policy. In fact, the crisis has dealt a double blow to 

fiscal policy: it will have to adjust to a weakening 

growth outlook at least in the short and medium run 

and, at the same time, deal with the fiscal 

ramifications of the crisis, including large-scale 
government interventions in the financial sector. 
 A negative shock to potential growth, even if only 
temporary, will lead to budget shortfalls because 

structural (that is, noncyclical) revenues will fall and 

structural expenditures increase. And while 

policymakers are rightfully willing to let automatic 
stabilizers work, they have reason to limit the 
structural deterioration of the fiscal balance during 

the crisis period. In the longer run, the European 

fiscal horizon is dominated by mounting pressures 

stemming from a quickly aging population. 

Expectations of age-related increases in pension, 

health care, and transfer spending generate strong 

incentives for policymakers to keep debt levels low 

to safeguard the fiscal space needed to deal with this 
challenge.
29 Given the fiscal adjustment necessary to 
meet such challenges, any deterioration in the 

structural fiscal position caused by a drop in 

potential GDP growth would make that goal harder 

to achieve. 
 In addition, however, the crisis has forced 
policymakers to use fiscal resources for  
interventions in the financial system, both directly 

and indirectly through guarantees. The available 

estimates of the direct crisis-related costs and the 

indirect costs associated with government 

guarantees suggest that financial sector interventions 
will add considerably to public debt. This debt effect 

will heighten the urgency of any fiscal adjustment 

caused by the impact of the crisis on growth. 
_______ 
29 The European Commission (2009a) predicts that, on average, 
the euro area will see its age-related spending increase by more 
than 3 percentage points of GDP between 2007 and 2035Šan 

estimate with considerable upside risks (IMF, 2009a). 
Fiscal Impact of Lower Potential Growth 
 The decline in potential growth in the short to 
medium term is subject to considerable uncertainty 

(see Chapter 2). How would different potential 

growth paths influence the fiscal position over this 
time horizon? One way to illustrate the impact of 

the crisis is to look at the implied deterioration of 

the structural fiscal balance compared to the ﬁtrendﬂ 

benchmark of continued precrisis potential growth. 
The structural balance is a conceptual interpretation 
of the fiscal budget based on an estimate of the 

noncyclical share of expenditures and revenues. For 

a given level of GDP and fiscal budget, standard 

methods for computing the structural balance 

suggest that a reduction in potential growth will lead 

to a reduction in the structural balance for a given 

fiscal policy (Girouard and André, 2005; and 

OECD, 2006).  Indeed, the structural balance for the euro area 
can be shown to deteriorate significantly under 

alternative scenarios for the shortfall in potential 

output over the period 2009Œ14 (Figure 17).
30  _______ 
30 The point can be illustrated by a simple ﬁrule-of-thumbﬂ 
calculation, in which structural revenues are assumed to be 
45 percent of potential output (around the historical average for 

the euro area over the past decade), while structural 
expenditures remain unchanged. Under this assumptions, a

   Note: Trend growth matches the average potential growth 2000Œ08 of 
about 1.9 percent.
IMPLICATIONS OF THE FALL IN POTENTIAL OUTPUT FOR MACROECONOMIC POLICIES 
47 Taking the time path of the GDP growth over the 
period as given, the annual structural deficit will be 

on average about 0.6 percentage points higher under 

the ﬁcrisisﬂ scenario (average potential growth of 

0.5 percent per year) than under the ﬁtrendﬂ benchmark of continued potential growth at precrisis levels (average 1.9 percent per year). The 

accumulated difference reaches more than 

3 percentage points over the full five-year period. 
The deterioration would be lower under the 

ﬁupsideﬂ scenario (average potential growth of 
1.5 percent per year) but obviously considerably 

higher under the ﬁdownsideﬂ scenario (average 

potential growth of Œ0.5 percent per year), with 
accumulated differences of about 1 and 5½ percentage points over the full period, 

respectively. Thus, while errors in the structural 

balance due to potential output revisions tend to be 

small for any given year (OECD, 2008), changes in 
potential as the result of the current financial crisis 
are likely to become large enough to influence 

estimates of an economy™s longer-term fiscal 

positionŠcausing a prolonged deterioration of the 
structural balance in the absence of corrective 
action. 
 The growth effects of the crisis on the structural 
fiscal balance are likely to be large enough to trigger 

adjustments from policymakers committed to a 

certain time path for the structural balance due to national commitments or linked to the medium-
term objectives of an EU stability program or to the 

excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under the 

Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).
31 For instance, for 
most euro area countries and many other EU 
members that are entering or have already entered the EDP, standard practice would imply that they eventually be asked to reduce their structural deficits 

to the tune of at least 0.5 percentage point of GDP 
_________________________________________ 
1 percent deterioration of the potential output results in 
0.45 percentage point deterioration of the structural balance. 
31 See IMF (2009d) for a more detailed discussion of medium-
term objectives and the mechanic
s of the EDP in the current 
crisis. Increasingly, national fiscal frameworks also define structural fiscal targets. For instance, Germany has recently put 

into place a fiscal framework setting a specific goal for the 

structural balance (see Chapter 1). per year until a balanced structural budget is reached. Gauging the required adjustment effort, 

however, will need to take into account both the 

potential growth and the debt effects of the crisis. The One-Two Punch of the Crisis in the 
Longer Run  A simple simulation exercise can shed light 
simultaneously on the growth and the debt effects of 
the crisis in the longer run, as well as their 

interaction, while allowing the introduction of a 

simple sustainability anchor for fiscal policy. To 

establish a counterfactual, consider a benchmark 

case without a crisis in which policymakers have resolved to steer fiscal policy to debt levels compatible with the EU-set SGP target of 

60 percent by 2020 or 2030. The question is, how 
will the required primary fiscal balance have to 

change compared to this benchmark to reach the 
SGP target once the crisis is taken into account? 
 Just how sizable the impact of the crisis will be 
on longer-run fiscal policy depends on its growth 

effects (see above) and on its impact on public debt. 

The crisis will lift the debt level through two 
channels. One is the cyclical deterioration of the 
budget, which for the 2008Œ10 period the World Economic Outlook estimates at a cumulative 16 percent of GDP for advanced and 10 percent of 
GDP for emerging European countries (Figure 18), 
though with considerable cross-country variation. 
The other is the extensive use of the public balance

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 48 sheet to shore up the financial system, including 
direct support measures such as capital injections 

and asset purchases and guarantees. As of June 
2009, the estimated fiscal impact of up-front 

financial sector help varies between 0.7 percent of 
GDP in Italy and 13.6 percent in the Netherlands, 
with an average for euro area countries of about 

5 percent (Horton, Kumar, and Mauro, 2009). The 

net fiscal costs of these measures, which exclude 

central bank support, could be lower should the 

actual demand for support continue to fall short of 

what governments have offered. In principle, the 
possible impact of fiscal guarantees is higher, with 

many countries having extended guarantees between 
approximately 10 and 30 percent and reaching about 
200 percent of GDP in Ireland. Although the fiscal 
implications of guarantees are particularly difficult to 

evaluate, they have been estimated to fall between 
2 and 5 percent of GDP (IMF, 2009d). Either way, 

however, the debt impact of the crisis is likely to 

create a sizable need for fiscal adjustment. In 
addition, it is also likely to influence the size of the 

adjustment necessitated by the growth effects of the 
crisis.  To gauge the broad impact of the crisis on the 
longer-term health of public finance, policymakers 

can compare the fiscal adjustment needed under 
different assumptions to the benchmark case 

(Table 7).
32 The simulation has two dimensions capturing the already familiar growth scenarios and 
alternative assumptions on the debt effect.
33 _______ 
32 See Horton, Kumar, and Mauro (2009) for a comparable comparison of the consolidation needs across a larger number 
of advanced and emerging economies. 
33 The calculation is quite standard. The benchmark assumes a 
starting debt level in line with historical euro area data for end-
2007, a constant real interest rate of 2 percent, inflation of 
2 percent, and real GDP growth at 1.9 percent, implying 

nominal GDP growth (
y) of about 3.9 and nominal interest rates 
(i) of 4 percent. The debt-to-GDP level evolves according to 
d (D/Y)t = (
B/Y)t +  (
i Œ y)/(1 + 
y)(D/Y)t Œ 1, where D is the nominal debt level, 
Y the level of nominal GDP, and d indicates 
the change of the debt ratio over time. The calculations 
underlying Table 7 assume that the starting debt level is 

increased by the amount stated compared to its benchmark level 
and that the growth path of potential output 2009Œ14 is as 
described in the scenarios illustrated in Figure 16 and indicated 
(continued)   A first insight is that the impact on fiscal policy is 
sizable. Even under the most benign set of 
assumptions, if the debt increase related to the crisis 
were only 5 percentage points of GDP and its 
impact on potential growth during the crisis were 

limited to the ﬁupsideﬂ scenario (see Figure 17), the 

average annual primary fiscal surplus required to 
bring debt back to the SGP target by 2030 would 
increase by about 0.3 percentage point of GDP, 

compared to the benchmark (Table 7, left panel), or 

by 0.6 percentage point if the same target were to be 

reached by 2020 (right panel). Moving toward less benign growth assumptions considerably darkens 
the picture. For instance, the ﬁcrisisﬂ growth 
scenarios cause the primary balance required to 
reach the debt target by 2030 or 2020 to rise to 

0.5 or 0.9 percentage point of GDP, respectively. 
 The effect of higher debt on the required fiscal 
adjustment may be even larger. For example, keeping with the optimistic ﬁupsideﬂ growth 

scenario but changing the assumptions about the 

debt increase to a more realistic 10 or 20 percentage 

points of GDP, the increase in the debt level will 

move the required fiscal adjustment relative to the 
benchmark to 0.8 and 1.2 percentage points of 
GDP, respectively, and nearly twice as much under 

the accelerated consolidation schedule.  Finally, the simulation illustrates how the impact 
of the crisis on public finances works through both 

the growth and the debt effect. The most plausible

IMPLICATIONS OF THE FALL IN POTENTIAL OUTPUT FOR MACROECONOMIC POLICIES 
49 policymakers will be facing in the aftermath of the 
crisis is a combination of the ﬁcrisisﬂ growth 

scenario and an increase in debt of 10Œ20 percentage 

points of GDP. Depending on how ambitious the 

timeline for consolidation is, this estimate translates 
into a very sizable necessary fiscal adjustment, 
ranging between 0.8 and 2.3 percentage points of 

GDP. And, clearly, both effects are responsible for 

some of the more extreme possible outcomes. This 

joint responsibility is underscored by the fact that 

the growth effect is not independent of the debt 

level at which it occurs: the drop in growth in output 

will weigh more on fiscal policy and will require a 

(somewhat) larger fiscal adjustment if it occurs 
under higher debt.
34  Where does this leave individual European 
countries? For a selection of advanced EU 
economies, the estimated fiscal consolidation 

required to reach the SGP debt target by 2020 will 

depend on the precrisis debt level and the expected debt increase during 2009Œ10.
35 The results are quite diverse (Figure 19), ranging from drastic required 

improvements in the average primary balance of 

5 percentage points of GDP or more for Belgium, 

Greece, and Italy to still exacting requirements in the 

range of 2Œ3 percentage points for Austria, France, 

Germany, and Portugal.
36 In most cases, starting debt levels seem to be the key driver of country 

dispersion, with the notable exceptions of Ireland 
and the United Kingdom; these two countries 
experienced particularly large increases in crisis-

related debt. Generally, the results confirm the

34 This is simply because the debt level ﬁweighsﬂ the growth 
effect in the evolution of the debt-to-GDP level (see the 
description above). For example, moving from the ﬁupsideﬂ to 

the ﬁdownsideﬂ growth scenario requires about 0.2 percentage 
point of GDP higher fiscal adjustment if the assumed debt 
impact is 30 rather than only 5 percentage points in the case that 
the SGP target is to be reached by 2020 (Table 7). 
35 The exercise is otherwise similar to the one underlying 
Table 7. Growth rates are assumed to follow the ﬁcrisisﬂ 
scenario. 36 Some countries show ﬁnegativeﬂ required improvements, 
which reflects starting debt levels below the assumed target level 
of 60 percent of GDP; these include Luxembourg, the Nordic 

countries, Slovenia, and Switzerland. 
urgency of fiscal consolidation in the aftermath of 
the crisis.  
Implications for Fiscal Policy 
 The one-two punch delivered by the crisis to 

Europe™s public finances is likely to generate a 

sizable fiscal challenge. The uncertainty surrounding 

the anticipated change to potential output puts a 

question mark beside the precise dimension of its 

growth effects, while the debt effects could vary 

greatly depending on the net costs of financial sector 

interventions and, in particular, the take-up of 

government guarantees. There is little doubt, 
however, that fiscal balances will have to improve 
significantly to meet targets for structural balances 

and ensure that longer-term sustainability needs are 

met. The fact that these problems come on top of 

an already difficult fiscal agendaŠthe high expected 

spending needs related to aging, revenue losses 

across Europe, and, in some cases, already elevated 
levels of debtŠwill exacerbate the challenges of a 

crisis-forced fiscal adjustment. 
 Meeting that challenge has various policy 
implications. One obvious consequence for policy 

more generally is the pressing need to boost 

potential growth to limit the fiscal damage 

threatened by the growth effect of the crisis (see also 

Chapter 2). In addition, the combination of already

deficit but will need to be complemented by further 

efforts to contain spending growth below nominal 

GDP growth. Indeed, successful fiscal adjustment is 
likely to place greater emphasis on spending cuts 

rather than tax increases, as the tax burden is already 
high in many European countries. Prioritization of 

spending should be undertaken through 
comprehensive expenditure reviews, which would 
help identify spending inefficiencies to be 
eliminated. Pension and health care reforms will be 

key elements in the adjustmentŠmeasures to 
contain aging-related spending would include 

increases in retirement age. Savings to the budget 

could also come from better targeting of welfare 

payments, which would also enhance incentives to 

work or from civil service reforms aimed at better 
aligning the public sector wage bill with 
performance and needs. The expected cyclical 

recovery of revenues could be complemented with a  
review of tax policy, aimed at further simplifying the 
tax system to facilitate tax administration and make 

the system less distortionary while broadening the 

tax base.  Improving fiscal frameworks will also help 
mitigate fallout from the crisis and safeguard fiscal 

sustainability in the medium run (see also IMF, 

2009d). Such mitigation could be achieved by 

introducing new national fiscal rules or 

strengthening existing ones and enhancing the 

preventive arm of the SGPŠfor instance, through 
giving greater commitment power to medium-term 
objectives and linking them to debt levels. 
 Finally, mirroring some of the implications for 
monetary policy, policymakers may find it 

advantageous to communicate clearly the reasons 

for the required fiscal belt-tightening, once the crisis has abated and the need for fiscal support to uphold aggregate demand becomes less urgent. While 

transparency is somewhat less an issue for fiscal 
policy in economic terms (to some extent, the 

increased public debt will speak for itself), shoring 

up the required public support might still be 

challengingŠespecially when it comes after a period 

of widespread economic hardship. Here, it could be 

helpful to lay out the various ways in which the 
crisis has contributed to fiscal shortfalls and stress 
the benefits of creating fiscal space for the tasks 

ahead, such as the ability to meet some of the aging-

related pressures and sustaining the ability to use 

fiscal policy as an effective tool for macroeconomic 

stabilization. 
   51 4. Policies in Emerging Economies for Coping with Heightened Risk During Recovery   Emerging Europe is likely to face higher risk premiums 
and a more volatile environment in the aftermath of the 

financial crisis. While the global crisis might be receding, 
investors are paying increased attention to domestic factors and 
policies, creating significant cross-country differences in 

sovereign spreads. Higher and more volatile spreads increase 

the variability of inflation and output over the cycle, with 
further deleterious effects on investment, growth, and prospects 
for convergence. Restoring the normal functioning of the 

financial system where needed, and strengthening financial 

stability and fiscal sustainability frameworks will go a long 

way toward addressing these concerns. Such policies could yield 
a ﬁdouble dividendﬂ by lowering the volatility of the business cycle and improving prospects for long-term growth.
 Facing a Riskier Environment  Even though the appetite for risk has moved 
away from its crisis-induced lows, emerging markets 
face a significantly more volatile external 

environment in the aftermath of the crisis. Interest 
rate spreads on sovereign bonds have increased, and 
interest rates and exchange rates have become more 
volatile (Figure 20).
37 Behind this dramatic shift in 
market risks lies a change in investor attitude. While 
global factors and market liquidity clearly play a role, 

investors are increasingly differentiating among 

countries according to their fundamentals and the 
soundness of their policies and in the process are 
dismissing the ﬁEuropean Union (EU) halo effectﬂ 
(IMF, 2009d). Taking their cue from the crisis, investors have become more ﬁconscious of tail 

risksﬂ (Blanchard, 2009) and charge higher risk 
_______ 
Note: The main author of this chapter is Srobona Mitra. 
37 High spreads and high volatility in interest rates are often 
observed together (Fernandez-Villaverde and others, 2009). The 
association works through investors seeking higher expected 
returns in case of higher risk. In turbulent times, news also 

arrives fast and frequently, inducing high volumes of trade in 

foreign debt and raising volatility when spreads are also higher. 
premiums. Thus, even with the dissipation of the 
global financial shocks, interest rate spreads and 
volatilities related to country-specific vulnerabilities are likely to remain elevated in the medium term.
38  Among the country-specific factors financial 
markets are focusing on, the state of private balance 

sheets and the financial system, as well as the closely 

related issue of fiscal sustainability, play an 

important role.
39 The factors that make foreign investors wary include, for example, the uncertainty 
about filling gaps in the financing needs of banks 

and the government, the rollover of maturing 

corporate and government debt, the capacity for 

dealing with household indebtedness and associated 

foreign-currency mismatches (see Box 3, Chapter 1), 

and the eventual contingent liabilities of the 

government. Even though all countries coming out 

of the crisis are likely to face a higher risk premium, 
emerging economies dependent on capital inflows 
for growth and development are especially affected, 
since their ability to attract capital inflows at a 

reasonable and steady price is at stake. 
 The combination of a more volatile environment 
and the vulnerabilities created by the crisis puts 
policymakers in a bind. Under fixed exchange rates, 
stabilizing output and inflation in the face of 
external shocks is intrinsically difficult under the 

best of circumstances because monetary policy takes 

its cues from the country to which the currency is 
pegged. The traditional policy advice is for fiscal 

policy to step up. But under the heightened

38 Blanchard (2009) warns that the ﬁhigher risk perception may 
well be an enduring legacy of the crisis,ﬂ citing evidence from 

the Great Depression that led to a lasting increase in the risk 
premium on stocks. 
39 For links between fiscal policy, financial sector risks, and 
interest spreads, see, for instance, Blanchard (1984); IMF 
(2009d); Ardagna, Caselli, and Lane (2004); Debrun and Joshi 
(2008); and Horton, Kumar, and Mauro (2009).

  REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE  54 post-crisis scrutiny of international investors, a more 
activist use of fiscal policy tools may cast doubt on 

fiscal sustainability and backfire in the form of 

higher and more volatile interest rate spreads in the 

medium term. This could add to the volatility of the 
economy rather than countering it, and lower growth, especially in emerging economies depending 

on capital inflows for growth. The same mechanism 

also limits the ability of governments to intervene in 

the financial sector through direct interventions or 

guarantees, both of which can have large fiscal 

consequences. And even under flexible exchange 

rates, the possibilities for financial sector 

intervention or macroeconomic stabilization can be 
limited, for instance in the presence of large foreign currency debt overhangs that can make exchange 

rate depreciations costly or when exchange rate 

changes pass through quickly to inflation. 
 The solution to these policy dilemmas is to 
reduce uncertainties about fiscal policy and the financial sector. While reforming fiscal policy 
frameworks would ease concerns over fiscal 

sustainability and decrease the level and volatility of 

the risk premium, proper disclosure of financial 

sector risks that could burden public finances down 

the road would help lower fiscal risks as well. In 

addition, improving the supervisory and regulatory 

policies that prevent the buildup of credit and 

liquidity risks, as in the years leading up to the crisis, would directly help lower the volatility of the 
financial market in the medium term. 
Adverse Effects on the Path to 
Recovery 
Fiscal and Financial Sector Problems Are Linked to Higher and More Volatile 

Interest Rates . . . 
 While common global shocks have increasingly 
affected the volatility of interest rate spreads and 
other financial indicators, an important factor 

behind the turbulence are banking and fiscal 
developments. When the crisis intensified in late 
2008, liquidity and capitalization strains in particular 

in the banking sector shook financial markets. This 
led to interventions by the central bank and fiscal 
authorities (sometimes with support from the 

international financial institutions), which added to 

interest rate volatility through their impact on the 

government budget. And concerns about the cyclical effects of the recession, continue to contribute to the unsteadiness of the fiscal situation. These 

developments are illustrated by unusually large and 

frequent revisions in the Consensus Forecasts of the 
budget balances of many emerging economies and 
new European Union (EU) member countries 

(Figure 21). For example, the average of the 

Consensus Forecasts of the 2009 fiscal balance for 

Hungary in July 2009 was almost 4 percentage 
points lower than the average forecast for March 
2009.40  The higher volatility in interest rates is tightly 
linked to the level of interest rate spreads. One 

reason is that investors demand higher returns to 

compensate for more volatile asset prices. Another is that the financial and fiscal developments associated with the higher interest volatility directly 

influence interest rate levels through the stock of 

public debt. While the use of fiscal stimuli in 

emerging Europe and new EU member states has 

not been as high as in advanced countries, some 

discretionary fiscal expansion occurred, automatic 

stabilizers were at work, and government 

interventions in the financial sector added to the 
increase in government debt (Figure 22). 
Empirically, higher projected debt tends to increase 
long-term borrowing costs (IMF, 2009d), with the 

strength of the effect reflecting, among other things, 

the elasticity of supply and the perception of risks 

stemming from the long-term sustainability of the 

public finances.
41   _______ 
40 The structural deficit for Hungary was considerably tightened in 2009Q2, which helped lower spreads. 
41 This is further amplified by the contingent costs of 
government guarantees for the financial sector. See Horton, Kumar, and Mauro (2009) and Chapter 3 for a discussion of the 

impact of the crisis on fiscal sustainability.

rate movements could be attributable to short-lived 

reactions of investors to news, the part of exchange 

rate changes associated with the upward shift in the 
risk premium and its volatility is likely to remain 
high, in particular if fiscal and financial sector worries linger. In fact, empirical observations of 
higher exchange rate volatility have often been 

associated with the downward revisions in the 
forecast of the fiscal balance in recent years.42 While it is difficult to infer causality among movements in 
exchange rate, interest spreads and fiscal projection revisions, especially during ongoing extreme events, 
they clearly could be mutually reinforcing. Higher volatility in exchange rates and spreads worsen economic performance, raise risk and contingent

concerns about fiscal sustainability, which, in turn,

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 56 to provide fresh capital to their subsidiaries, the 
ultimate burden could be on the fiscal authorities.
43 This also holds in the handful of countries that have 

systemically important domestic banks. In smaller 

and more open economies, a more volatile exchange 
rate could also impart this volatility to the inflation 
rate and to the output gap through the trade 

channel, if the economy is highly dependent on 
exports. Hurting Long-Term Growth and 
Convergence  The higher risk premium and its volatility are 
likely to affect long-term growth directly. Particularly 
at risk are the European emerging economies heavily 
dependent on capital inflows, especially foreign 

direct investments, for growth and for convergence 

to higher-income countries. A higher risk premium 

and its volatility would increase the cost of capital 

and the variability of consumption and hurt the 

recovery of long-run growth (Fernandez-Villaverde 

and others, 2009). As foreign investors demand 

higher compensation for risk (while having difficulty 
in gauging its magnitude), domestic institutions, 
including banks, will not find it easy to attract 
foreign direct investment (FDI) and banking flows 

at reasonable rates. Because of higher volatility in 

risk premiums, domestic institutions will also find it 

difficult to plan for the future. A lower FDI inflow 

could hurt both medium-term growth and the 

convergence process for emerging Europe (see 

Chapter 2).  Higher volatility in the business cycle and the 
associated increase in the volatility of shocks (or 
higher uncertainty) during the crisis also have a _______

direct effect on growth (Ramey and Ramey, 1994). A 
1-percentage point higher standard deviation in 

growth of output is estimated to lower long-term 

growth by two-fifths of a percentage point in 
OECD countries. In particular, fiscal policy uncertainty that raises uncertainty about growth 
outcomes (through its higher volatility) lowers long-

term growth, since such uncertainty makes it 

difficult for firms to plan for the future.44 This particular channel operates in addition to any 
adverse effects from investment or FDI effects of 

higher volatility. Moreover, higher government debt and deficits 
by themselves could have additional damaging 

effects on long-term growth through permanently 

higher borrowing costs and crowding out. For 

example, a 20-percentage point increase in the level 

of government debt as a share of GDP would lower 

annual long-term growth by 0.6 percentage point 

(see Chapter 2). Challenging Policymakers 
Emerging Economies Are Historically 
Subject to Relatively Large Shocks . . . 
Even before the crisis, emerging economies (EM) 
were operating in a more volatile environment than 

the euro area. The EM faced less stable aggregate 
demand due to fickle world demand for the EM™s 
exports or discretionary fiscal expansions and 

contractions. The supply side and the external 

environment has also been more volatile historically 

owing to the substantial structural changes 
associated with the transition from a centrally 
planned to a market economy, higher exposure to world trade and financial flows relative to GDP, and 

weaker policy transmission mechanisms. And, as 
already discussed, EMs that receive large capital 

inflows into the banking and the corporate sectors

44 If firms have to commit to their technology in advance, then 
volatility can lead to lower mean output because firms find 
themselves producing at suboptimal levels ex post. If lower 

current output affects resource accumulation, then growth is 

adversely affected (Ramey and Ramey, 1995). POLICIES IN EMERGING ECONOMIES FOR COPING WITH HEIGHTENED RISK DURING RECOVERY 
57 and run large current account deficits are vulnerable 
to the changes in investor sentiments leading to 

large changes in the exchange rate or in country risk 
spreads or both.  Indeed, based on an estimated macroeconomic 
model, the volatility of shocks are measurably higher 
in the EM than in the euro area.45 With an estimated Global Projection Model (Carabenciov and others, 

2008) of the euro area, Japan, the United States, and 
a medium-sized European emerging economy (EM) 

with a flexible exchange rate, the standard deviation 

of the shocks to aggregate demand, supply, the 

exchange rate, and the equilibrium risk premium 

were derived (Table 8).46 Aggregate demand and aggregate supply shocks were historically more 
volatile in the EM than in the euro area. The largest 

difference, however, was in the volatility of 

exchange rate shocks, while the volatility of shocks 

to the risk premium was not very different from 
those faced by the euro area.47 As a consequence, emerging economies have 
historically had more variability in inflation and 

output than the euro area. This point is illustrated by 

comparing ﬁefficiency frontiersﬂ for policy for the 

euro area and the EM (Figure 24). An efficiency 
frontier is a way of showing the lowest combination 

of output and inflation volatilities achievable by 

policymakers, given their preferences and the 
magnitude of shocks hitting the economy.
48 The _______ 
45 This section and the next are written by Ioan Carabenciov, 
Roberto Garcia-Saltos, Michel Juillard, Douglas Laxton, Troy 
Matheson, Srobona Mitra, Susanna Mursula, and Kadir Tanyeri. 
46 The analytical details are elaborated in Carabenciov and 
others (forthcoming). The model is estimated with data from 
2001:Q3 to 2009Q1, and the standard deviation of the residuals 
are computed for the precrisis (2001:Q3Œ2007:Q2) and the crisis 

(2007:Q3Œ2009:Q1) periods. 
47 Monetary policy shocks also tended to be more volatile in 
EM precrisis (not shown). In the GPM, the exchange rate shock 
is the shock to the uncovered interest parity equation. The 

expected change in the real exchange rate one quarter ahead equals the real interest rate difference between EM and the 
United States minus
 the difference between the equilibrium real 
interest rates (or the equilibrium risk premium) adjusted for 

changes in the equilibrium real exchange rate 
plus
 the exchange rate shock. 48 Policymakers could be thought of as wanting to maximize 
society™s welfare by lowering variability in inflation and output 
(continued) euro area™s frontier lies far to the southwest of the EM™s frontier. Roughly speaking, policymakers in 

the EM will generally have to accept twice the 
volatility in output and about 1½ times the volatility 
of inflation of the euro area.
49 . . . And the Crisis Has Increased the Magnitude and Volatility of Shocks 
 With the crisis, long-term credit default swaps 
(CDS) and bond interest spreads of European 
emerging economies have increased from a precrisis 

average of about 75 basis points to a crisis average 
of about 330 basis points. The new average was 
accompanied by higher volatility of the risk 

premium with the standard deviation of spreads 

going up from about 4 to 30 basis points. The 

higher variability in the exchange rate can be 

explained partly by changes in the real interest rate  
_________________________________________ 
changes, given existing trade-offs. Given their preference and 
shock volatilities, the lowest preferred combinations of output 
and inflation variability can be plotted in the ﬁefficiency 

frontier.ﬂ The estimates from the GPM and the various shock 

variances are used to draw the frontier. To do so, a social loss 
function denoted by the weighted sum of variances of inflation, 
output gap, and changes in the re
al interest rate is minimized 
subject to the estimated equations and their shock variances. 

Because there can be infinite combinations of weights 
depending on social preferences, the weight on the output gap is 
varied, and the optimal interest rate rule is estimated for each 

weight. The standard deviation of inflation and the output gap 

resulting from applying the newly optimized rule is then 
computed, forming a point in the efficiency frontier for the EM. 
Other points are obtained by va
rying the degree of dislike for 
output variability compared to inflation variability and following 

the same procedure. 
49 For instance, if policymakers in both countries paid twice as 
much attention to the smoothness of inflation compared to 
output (for example, if the weight on the variance of the output 
gap in the loss function was 0.5 and that of inflation 1), then the 
best preferred lowest standard deviation of output would be 

0.79 for the euro area, whereas the EM™s best achievement 

would be 1.62. Country/regionPrecrisisCrisisPrecrisisCrisisPrecrisisCrisis

differentials between the emerging economy and the rest of the world and partly by changes in the risk 

premium, along with short-lived fluctuations. While 
movements of the real interest rate are due to, say, 
changes in monetary policy, there could be large and 
infrequent shifts in the risk premium itself 
accompanied by high volatility, resulting in a highly 

variable exchange rate. Shocks to the risk premium 

will have repercussions throughout the economy. 
Aggregate demand for output comprising both 
consumption and investment demand could be quite 

volatile as well, especially when these demand 

components rely on capital inflows, as they do in 

emerging economies. If the shocks to the level and 
the volatility of the risk premium are long lasting (as 
is shown for some Latin American countries by 

Fernandez-Villaverde and others, 2009), then they 
could have long-lasting and detrimental effects on 

the growth and volatility of output. 
 Against this background, model analysis shows 
that the efficiency frontier of the EM has indeed 
shifted further northeast in the aftermath of the 

crisis because of the larger incidence of shocks and 

their higher volatilities. Based on the extreme 

scenario in which all the increase in the average 

interest spreads translates into a shift in the 

equilibrium risk premium, then almost all the shift in 

the frontier can be accounted for by the higher risk 

premium and its volatility (Figure 25). Indeed, even 
though the precrisis volatility risk premium shocks

in the EM was almost the same as that in the euro area, the effects of the crisis were strongly 

differentiated among countries and regions 
(Table 8). If the policy regime and its preferences 

were the same as before the crisis, then the lowest 
achievable variability in output would be one and 
one-fifth times more than before the crisis. The Policy Dilemma 
Policymakers need to ensure that the recovery from the crisis is solid, sustainable, and smooth, but 
this change in environment greatly complicates their 

task. In terms of stabilizing the business cycle, trying 

to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates 

while taking care to limit inflationary pressures 

triggers parallel movements in the risk premium, 

which could add to output volatility. In addition, the 

crisis will also cause pain along another dimension. 

The higher variability could shave about 
0.1 percentage point from long-term growth (using 
findings from Ramey and Ramey, 1995, cited earlier). The adverse effect on growth operates mainly through the elevated uncertainty reflected in 
the risk premium. A higher government debt could 
(separately) erase about 0.3 percentage point from 

medium-term growth (using the growth regression 

in Box 5, Chapter 2) through crowding-out effects. 
Monetary policymakers are limited in their 
options by the twin problems of low growth and 

high exchange rate volatility. Although policy rates 
POLICIES IN EMERGING ECONOMIES FOR COPING WITH HEIGHTENED RISK DURING RECOVERY 
59 can be lowered, central banks fear excessive depreciation of the exchange rate. If policy rates are 

increased to stem capital outflows, growth could 

suffer. And once a recovery gets underway, inflation 

pressures could start building up when policymakers try to stimulate growth. In fact, the crisis forces the 
efficiency frontier to move further northeast of the 
precrisis one (Figure 25), even though monetary 

policy is doing the best job possible under the 

circumstances.
50 With policy preferences constant, if the central bank were to increase focus on the 

output gap to refuel growth, it would have to do so 

with a more volatile rate of inflation than would be 
acceptable. 
Adjusting the frameworks for financial stability and fiscal sustainability to meet the challenges posed 

by the crisis could be the more promising course of 

action. As highlighted earlier, uncertainty about the 

course of fiscal policy with lingering uncertainties 

about the financial sector has been part of the problems triggered by the crisis; reversing this 
uncertainty should prove helpful now. For instance, 

good fiscal policy that underpins long-term 

sustainability can help reverse some of the upward 

shift in spreads and their volatility over time. In the 

new regime, even if there are short-term setbacks in 

fiscal balances, uncertainty about fiscal sustainability 

could be avoided by setting credible lower deficit 

and debt targets and implementing them so that 
investors can believe in them. The increase in 
credibility associated with good fiscal frameworks 

could lower long-term interest rates and their 

volatility (Debrun and Joshi, 2008). In addition, 

lowering volatility induced by government spending 

could significantly improve long-term growth 
(Ramey and Ramey, 1995). In the financial sector, longer-term policies aimed 
at limiting credit boomsŠfueled by the debt-

creating capital inflows at the heart of the crisis in 
emerging EuropeŠshould fortify measures to 
restart credit in the short term. These vulnerabilities _______ 
50 By construction, the efficiency frontier assumes that the EM™s 
central bank™s policy rule is optimally adjusted to the more 
volatile environment. also led to differences among countries during the crisis. Moreover, disclosing the risks could reduce 

the uncertainty surrounding the strength of the 

financial sector. These policies will help lower the 

risk premium and its volatility. 
Policy Options 
Limiting Discretionary Fiscal Policy 
During the Recovery Could Help 
The EM™s volatility of aggregate demand shock 
remains high compared to the precrisis average of 

the euro area, a difference largely attributable to the 

behavior of fiscal policy (Table 8).51 This holds true, even though, unlike the euro area, the EM did not 
engage in substantial fiscal stimulus, and the 

volatility of the aggregate demand shock has 

changed little (or even declined somewhat) during 

the crisis. If it could lower the volatility of this shock 
to equal the euro area™s precrisis volatility, then the efficiency frontier could start shifting away from its 

elevated crisis position (Figure 26). As a 

consequence, policymakers would be able to achieve 

both a lower variance of output and a lower variance 

of inflation than that during the crisis.

51 See Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999), footnote 11, for an 
interpretation of the aggregate demand shock and its relation to 
government spending. REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 60 A rules-based, fiscal policy that limits changes in 
deficits to automatic stabilizers and thereby helps 
clarify expectations regarding the direction of the 

fiscal deficit while the economy is recovering would 

reduce the discretionary part of the aggregate 
demand shock.52 Such an approach would provide a framework for making policies credible and reducing 

long-term government debt and deficits without 

having to follow greatly contractionary or 

expansionary policies during crisis. According to 

previous research, ﬁtighteningﬂ the fiscal rules 

framework would immediately reduce the long-term 
interest rate between 10 and 40 basis points, while in 

the long run, a permanent shift to stricter and more 
encompassing fiscal rules suggests a reduction in long-term government bond yields of up to 65 basis 

points (Debrun and Joshi, 2008). A downward shift 

in interest rates would also reduce the volatility of 
the long-term interest rate, given the close links 

between the two seen during this crisis and 

established in the empirical literature (Fernandez-

Villaverde and others, 2009). 
In addition, given the empirical links between 
spreads and financial sector vulnerabilities in 

emerging Europe (IMF, 2009d), implementing 
lasting improvements in supervision of the sector to 

avoid uncontrolled credit booms and unmanageable 

debt-creating inflows would reduce both spread and 

volatility in the future. Thus, the efficiency frontier 
would move further back with a permanent 
reduction in the risk premium and its volatility 

because of medium-term fixes in both the fiscal and 
the financial sectors. In addition, the lower long-

term interest rate and the reduced volatility of 

business cycles would also promote long-run 

growth. _______ 
52 For instance, Honjo and Hunt (2006) show how fiscal policy 
rules designed to ensure a consistently countercyclical fiscal 
stance along with a public debt target can shift Iceland™s 

efficiency frontiers to the southwest. 
Explicit Reaction to the Exchange Rate 
Is Unlikely to Help 
Given the heightened role of exchange rate 
volatility during the crisis, monetary policymakers in 
the EM might be tempted to respond when 
exchange rates fluctuate along with changes in 

inflation and output. Could EM central banks lower 
volatility by doing so? Not always. If society still 

cares about variability in inflation and output, and if 

the shocks to the economy mainly affect the 
equilibrium risk premium, a central bank can do 
little by explicitly reacting to exchange rate changes. 
Indeed, returning to the model simulation, if the central bank reacts to large increases (depreciations) 
in the exchange rate by increasing the policy rate 

neither inflation nor output volatility is reduced 
significantly (Figure 27). The efficiency frontier 
shifts very little from its crisis position because 

forward-looking agents have already incorporated 

information on exchange rates and formed 
expectations about the inflation rate and the output 

gap. Any extra reaction to movements in the 

exchange rate does not change outcomes in 
equilibrium. Where risk perceptions have become 

embedded in private sector expectations, nothing 
short of fundamental changes in the way fiscal and 
financial sector policies are made could shift the 
frontier back.

POLICIES IN EMERGING ECONOMIES FOR COPING WITH HEIGHTENED RISK DURING RECOVERY 
61 This point is all the more emphatic for countries 
in fixed exchange rate regimes. The reaction of 

ﬁmonetaryﬂ policy in such countries could be 

simplified so that the policy rate moves only to fight 

fluctuations in the exchange rate. Obviously, 
inflation and output volatility will remain unaffected 
by such exchange rate defenses, and the familiar 

conclusion holds that fiscal, financial, and other 

structural policies will need to bring about the 

necessary adjustment. 
Conclusions and Policy 
Implications Even though tensions in the global financial 
system have receded and the volatility of asset prices 
and interest rates appears to be past its peak, the low 

precrisis levels of risk premiums and volatility are 

not likely to be seen again. The counterpart of these 

price movements is that capital inflows and their 

reliability have diminished. And while global factors 
were initially the dominant driving forces, investors 
have begun to differentiate appreciably among 

countries on the basis of domestic factors and 

policies. 
Policymakers in a typical emerging economy are thus confronted with a lower rate of potential 
growth (see Chapter 2), more fickle investors, and, consequently, a less favorable trade-off between 

inflation and output volatility. Further complicating 

matters are uncertainty about the potential for 

postcrisis output and the resilience of the financial 
system to higher interest rates and depreciated 

exchange rates, as well as the increased volatility of 

those variables. At the same time, policymakers are 

being called upon in several cases to use fiscal 
resources to repair financial systems and, more widely, to help support economic activity in the 

aftermath of the crisis. Policymakers need to tailor their responses to 
country circumstances, particularly to the state of 

the financial system, the degree of access to 
financing, and the extent of the collapse in private 
demand. Yet, all countries are facing heightened risk 

and a more volatile environment, triggered, among 
other things, by a substantial increase in the risk 
premium and its volatility. What can policies do to 

promote a smooth recovery, help reestablish 

sustainable convergence, and improve the trade-off 

between output and inflation volatility? A number of 
policy options are available: 
 As in advanced economies with impaired 
financial systems, evaluating, and disclosing risks, 
and, more important, recapitalizing or resolving 
financial institutions are essential. The ongoing 
stress tests in the Central, Eastern, and Southern 
European countries, currently coordinated by the 
IMF, will recognize bank losses and 
recapitalization needs that, if properly disclosed, would help lower uncertainty about the banking 

sectors in those countries and indirectly address volatility in the risk premium. Where needed, a 
restructuring of the liabilities of overstretched 
households and corporations should accompany such actions. For emerging economies, the cross-
border dimension is particularly relevant because 
it is important to keep parent banks engaged in 
the countries.  
 Increasing the transparency of contingent fiscal 
liabilities that emanate from the stresses in the 

financial system or other sources and properly 
disclosing the risks surrounding those estimates 
will reduce the uncertainty about the fiscal 
outlook (Box 4, Chapter 1).  A rules-based fiscal policy that limits deficits 
mostly to automatic stabilizers would help to 
anchor long-term fiscal sustainability and predictability. Some countries have already 
adopted such rules or credible medium-term 
targets (Hungary, Poland, and Romania).
53 _______ 
53 Sizable improvements in primary balances will be required in 
several emerging economies to halt or reverse the increase in 
debt-to-GDP ratios through 2014 (Horton, Kumar, and Mauro, 
2009). Anchoring expectations about the fiscal policy path could 

be done by setting medium-term fiscal targets that are credibly 

set and supported by appropriate institutional frameworks. An 
example is a medium-term expenditure framework that sets 
multiyear limits at the aggregate, ministerial, or program level, to 

translate overall objectives into budget decisions. Also, see 

Horton, Kumar, and Mauro (2009) for a table on strategies to 
(continued) REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 62 Avoiding the surprises inherent in discretionary fiscal policy would lower volatility of shocks to 
aggregate demand, and help reduce volatility in 
the business cycle. At the same time, such policies would help reduce the sovereign risk 
premium and its volatility.  
 Reforms for improving financial sector 
supervision and regulation to reduce 
vulnerabilities and avoid boom-and-bust cycles 
would directly lower the risk premium and its 
uncertainty. Capital injections into banks in the 
short-term would help restart lending. But such 
capitalizations would be wasteful if not 
accompanied by a strengthening of the 
supervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential 
framework (IMF, 2009d). Some examples 
include the ability to impose stricter capital requirements for weaker banks under Basel II 

Pillar 2 while strengthening cross-border 
cooperation between home-host supervisory and 
financial stability authorities and implementing 
forward-looking (countercyclical) provisioning 
policies to reduce volatility of bank profits. A 

few countries have already received technical 
assistance from the IMF on new supervisory 
architectures.  Adopting such changes would help move the 
trade-off between inflation and output variability in 

emerging markets considerably closer to the position

country authorities. 
of their advanced-economy peers, especially for the 
more open economies operating under flexible 

exchange rates. It would free monetary policy to 

focus on its primary role of providing price stability 
and smoothing fluctuations in the output gap. 
Model simulations further suggest that virtually 
nothing can be gained from attempting to stabilize 

fluctuations in the exchange rate, if the source of 

fluctuation is the risk premium. For countries with 

fixed exchange rate regimes, the well-known need 

for more flexible labor and product markets 

emphasizes the heightened importance of 

strengthening frameworks for fiscal sustainability 

and financial stability. 
 The adoption of robust frameworks not only 
yields benefits in cyclical trade-offs but is also 

helpful for long-term growth. The emerging 

economies are heavily reliant on capital inflows, 

both bank-related and FDI inflows, for convergence 

to the higher income levels of their Western 
European neighbors; stronger frameworks will 
enhance their prospects. In addition, lowering 

government debt and deficits through better fiscal 

frameworks would directly improve the outlook for 

growth. Thus, credible fiscal and financial 

frameworks that impart a sense of long-term fiscal 
sustainability and financial stability will yield a 

double-dividend in long-term growth.   63 References  Abiad, Abdul, Daniel Leigh, and Ashoka Mody, 2009,
