10ECB Annual Report2009In 2009 the European Central Bank continued to operate as an anchor of stability and conÞ dence in the challenging environment created by the 
global Þ nancial crisis. Following the severe 
intensiÞ cation of 
Þ nancial market tensions 
in autumn 2008, the year 2009 started with 
a rapid and synchronised fall in economic 
activity worldwide. This was followed by a 
very gradual recovery in the course of the year, 
while inß ation remained very low. Overall, euro 
area real GDP contracted by 4.0% in 2009 and 
average annual inß ation stood at 0.3%. At the 
same time, medium to longer-term inß ation expectations remained Þ rmly anchored in line 
with the Governing Council™s aim of keeping 
inß ation rates below, but close to, 2% over the 
medium term. This reß ects the high degree of 
credibility of the ECB™s monetary policy. In this environment, and in response to continued subdued inß ationary pressures, the Governing 
Council in the Þ rst few months of 2009 lowered the rate on the main reÞ nancing operations by a 
further 150 basis points, to 1%, a level not seen 
in recent history in the countries of the euro area. The Governing Council left the key ECB interest 
rates unchanged for the remainder of the year. In addition, with a view to ensuring the proper transmission of monetary policy impulses 
at a time when the functioning of the Þ nancial system was severely hampered, the Governing 
Council extended its enhanced credit support 
measures. These measures were designed 
to support Þ nancing conditions and the 
ß ow of credit to the economy beyond what could be 
achieved through reductions in key ECB interest 
rates alone. They were tailored to the Þ nancial structure of the euro area economy Œ where 
banks play a major role in Þ nancing households 
and Þ rms Œ and have helped to maintain the 
ß ow of credit to the economy.In particular, the ECB continued to provide liquidity in a Þ xed rate full allotment 
procedure in all reÞ nancing operations and 
further lengthened the maximum maturity of 
its reÞ nancing operations. It conducted three 
operations with a maturity of 12 months in 
2009. As a result, Þ nancing conditions in the 
euro area improved considerably during the 
year, as reß ected in particular in reduced term 
money market spreads and a signiÞ cant decline 
in overall Þ nancial market volatility. 
In the course of 2009 there were increasing signs 

of stabilisation in economic activity in the euro 

area and beyond. The parallel improvement in 

Þ nancial market conditions reduced the need for 
extraordinary intermediation by the Eurosystem. 

Taking these improvements into account, 

in December 2009 the Governing Council initiated 

a gradual phasing-out of those non-standard 

measures that were no longer needed. This timely 

decision was taken to avoid distortions associated 

with maintaining non-standard measures for 

too long, and to provide incentives for banks 

to continue making the necessary adjustments 

in their balance sheets. At the same time, 

the Eurosystem™s enhanced credit support 

continues to ensure the provision of liquidity 

to the euro area banking system, facilitating the 

provision of credit to the euro area economy and 

further underpinning its recovery.11ECB Annual Report2009With regard to Þ scal policies, as in other 
advanced economies, budgetary positions in the euro area countries worsened very signiÞ cantly in 2009, reß ecting the large economic 
contraction and the expansionary Þ scal stance, 
which included Þ scal stimulus measures and 
government support measures for the Þ nancial sector. According to the European Commission™s 
autumn economic forecasts of November 2009, 
the average general government deÞ cit ratio in 
the euro area increased from 2.0% of GDP in 
2008 to 6.4% in 2009. Against this background, 
it is of paramount importance that the updated 
stability programme of each euro area country 
is underpinned by well-deÞ ned corrective 
measures in line with the respective excessive 
deÞ cit procedure and clearly sets out the 
Þ scal exit and consolidation strategies for the period 
ahead, with a strong focus on expenditure 
reforms. The key challenge in order to reinforce sustainable growth and job creation is to 
accelerate structural reforms. In particular, 
reforms are urgently needed in the Þ nancial sector, where an appropriate restructuring of the 
banking sector should play an important role. 
Sound balance sheets, effective risk management 
and transparent, robust business models are key 
to strengthening banks™ resilience to shocks, 
thereby laying the foundations for sustainable 
growth and Þ nancial stability. In the case 
of product markets, policies that enhance 
innovation should be developed to speed up 
restructuring and investment and to create 
new business opportunities. In labour markets, 
moderate wage-setting, effective incentives to 
work and sufÞ cient labour market 
ß exibility are 
required in order to avoid signiÞ cantly higher 
structural unemployment over the coming 
years.* * *The policy and regulatory responses to the 
Þ nancial crisis gathered momentum in 2009 
with a number of concrete proposals for the 
enhancement of the Þ nancial stability framework 
at the European and global level. The report of the high-level group chaired by 
Jacques de Larosière, published in February 2009, 
put forward a set of recommendations for a new 
EU institutional framework for supervision. 
The European Commission followed up on 
these recommendations in September by issuing 
legislative proposals to the EU Council and the 
European Parliament. The proposals regard, 
Þ rst, the establishment of a European Systemic 
Risk Board (ESRB), responsible for the conduct 
of macro-prudential oversight, and, second, a 
European System of Financial Supervisors Œ 
comprising a network of three European 
Supervisory Authorities and the competent 
national supervisory authorities Œ responsible 
for micro-prudential supervision. The ECB has 
broadly welcomed the Commission™s proposals 
in its formal opinions.The main macro-prudential tasks of the ESRB will be to identify and assess risks to the 
stability of the EU Þ nancial system, and to 
issue risk warnings and, when appropriate, 
policy recommendations for remedial action. 
The performance of these tasks, based on a 
comprehensive information base and effective 
macro-prudential instruments, can be expected 
to contribute signiÞ cantly to 
Þ nancial stability 
in the EU. The ECB, as an EU institution, 
stands ready to work closely with all 27 national 
central banks of the ESCB and the competent 
supervisory authorities to support the ESRB 
in performing these tasks. At the global level, the London summit of the G20 Heads of State or Government in 
April 2009 was a milestone. It established the 
Financial Stability Board (FSB) as a successor to 
the Financial Stability Forum, with a broadened 
membership and a strengthened mandate for 
safeguarding Þ nancial stability. The ECB is a 
member of the FSB and contributes actively to 
the fulÞ lment of its mission, also as a member 
of its Steering Committee. The G20 summit provided impetus for a wide-ranging regulatory reform, which is being 
followed up by the global standard-setting 
bodies and also by the European Commission. 12ECB Annual Report2009The ECB has supported and contributed to this reform through its participation in the relevant 
forums and the provision of advice at the global 
and EU levels in areas such as the revision of 
banks™ capital requirements, the enhancement 
of accounting rules and the arrangements for 
Þ nancial crisis management and resolution. 
* * *During 2009 the ECB continued to actively 
foster initiatives aimed at enhancing stability and 
integration in Þ nancial market infrastructures. 
In February 2009 the ECB published the 
ﬁEurosystem oversight policy frameworkﬂ, 
which describes the role of the Eurosystem 
in the Þ eld of oversight, the methods and 
instruments that the Eurosystem employs in this 
respect, and the allocation of responsibilities 
within the Eurosystem. In order to further 
enhance the safety, soundness and efÞ ciency of the European post-trading sector, the ESCB 
and the Committee of European Securities 
Regulators (CESR) prepared recommendations 
for securities settlement systems and for central 
counterparties in the EU. In addition, the ECB continued to act as a catalyst for private sector activities by 
facilitating collective action. The Single Euro 
Payments Area (SEPA) initiative, which the ECB 
has strongly supported since its inception, reached 
its second major milestone with the launch 
of the SEPA direct debit in November 2009. 
For the Þ rst time, there is now a truly European direct debit payment service. In the Þ eld of central bank services, the 
single platform TARGET2, the Eurosystem™s large-value payment system, now enables 
23 central banks of the EU and their respective 
user communities to beneÞ t from the same 
comprehensive and advanced real-time gross 
settlement services. Furthermore, progress was 
made on the establishment of the common, 
neutral securities settlement service called 
TARGET2-Securities (T2S). By February 
2010, 29 central securities depositories had 
signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Eurosystem, agreeing to use T2S once it is 
in operation. In addition, the central banks of 
Denmark, Sweden and Norway, supported by 
their respective national markets, expressed 
their interest in settling securities transactions 
in their national currencies in T2S. Work also 
continued throughout 2009 on the establishment 
of a single shareable platform (CCBM2) for 
Eurosystem collateral mobilisation. CCBM2 
will allow the Eurosystem to provide efÞ cient and cost-optimised collateral management and 
enhanced liquidity management services to 
Eurosystem counterparties.* * *Turning to organisational issues, the ECB had 
1,385.5 full-time equivalent positions at the end 
of 2009, compared with 1,357.5 positions at the 
end of 2008. The increase is mainly explained 
by new tasks allocated to the ECB in relation 
to the T2S programme. The members of staff 
of the ECB come from all 27 countries of the 
EU and are recruited by means of open selection 
campaigns to Þ ll vacancies published on the 
ECB™s website. In line with the ECB™s mobility 
policy, 196 members of staff moved internally 
to other positions in 2009, while 21 members of 
staff were seconded to other organisations for 
external work experience and 31 were granted 
unpaid leave to study, to take up employment 
with other organisations or for personal reasons. 
The continuous acquisition and development of 
skills and competencies by all members of staff, 
including management, remained a cornerstone 
of the ECB™s human resources strategy. In 2009 the ECB completed the reform of its retirement plan for staff members to ensure its 
long-term Þ nancial sustainability. To protect 
acquired rights, the existing retirement plan 
was frozen on 31 May 2009, and a new pension 
scheme was introduced on 1 June 2009. The construction of the new ECB premises was approved in 2009. Following the launch of a 
new procurement strategy for the construction 
works, a total of 44 public tender procedures 
were conducted, and applications were received 13ECB Annual Report2009from more than 400 construction companies. By the end of 2009 the ECB had received binding 
offers for work representing around 80% of 
the calculated construction costs. Largely as 
a result of the high degree of competition, the 
total amount of all offers is within the envisaged 
budget. On the basis of this favourable 
outcome, the Governing Council decided in 
December 2009 to Þ nalise the contracts, to start construction in spring 2010 and to launch public 
tender procedures for the remaining trades and 
lots in the course of 2010. Completion of the 
building is foreseen for the end of 2013. The ECB earned a surplus of •2.22 billion in 2009, as compared with a surplus of •2.66 
billion in 2008. The Governing Council decided 
to release, as at 31 December 2009, an amount 
of •0.03 billion from the provision for foreign 
exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price 
risks, in order to comply with the maximum 
allowed ceiling, which is the value of the ECB™s 
capital paid up by the euro area NCBs. The size 
of this provision, which is reviewed annually, 
now amounts to •4.02 billion. The ECB™s net 
result for 2009, following the release from the 
provision, was •2.25 billion. This amount was 
distributed to the euro area NCBs in proportion 
to their paid-up shares in the ECB™s capital.Frankfurt am Main, March 2010Jean-Claude TrichetThe new ECB premises, designed by COOP HIMMELB(L)AU, are due to be completed by 2013. The ensemble will consist of three main building elements, namely the high-rise, the former Grossmarkthalle and the entrance building.CHAPTER 1ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS ANDMONETARY POLICY 
16ECBAnnual Report
2009Throughout 2009, following the intensiÞ cation of the Þ nancial crisis in autumn 2008, 
the Eurosystem continued to operate in a challenging environment. In response to 
subdued inß ationary pressures in the context 
of a severe economic downturn in the euro 
area and elsewhere, the Governing Council 
further reduced the key ECB interest rates 
substantially. After a total reduction of 
175 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2008, 
the Governing Council lowered the rate on 
the main reÞ nancing operations by a further 
150 basis points between January and 
May 2009, to a level not seen in recent history 
in the countries of the euro area. Since then 
the Governing Council has left the key ECB 
interest rates unchanged, with the interest rate 
on the main reÞ nancing operations at 1.00%, 
the rate on the deposit facility at 0.25% and 
the rate on the marginal lending facility 
at 1.75%.At the same time, given that the functioning of 
the Þ nancial system was severely hampered, 
the Governing Council adopted additional 

non-standard measures in 2009, thereby 

coping with dysfunctional money markets 

and facilitating the transmission of lower key 

ECB interest rates to money market and bank 

lending rates (see Box 1). This in turn was 

expected to foster more supportive Þ nancing 
conditions and the ß ow of credit to households 
and corporations. These measures went beyond 

what could be achieved through reductions in 

key ECB interest rates alone. This approach 

also took into account the major role that banks 

play in the euro area in providing Þ nancing 
to the real economy. As a result, Þ nancing 
conditions improved considerably, as reß ected 
in particular in reduced term money market 

spreads and a signiÞ cant decrease in overall 
Þ nancial market volatility. All non-standard 
measures adopted by the Governing Council 

were temporary in nature and designed to 

maintain price stability over the medium 

term both directly and indirectly by ensuring 

that inß ation expectations remained 
Þ rmly 
anchored in line with price stability.1 MONETARY POLICY DECISIONS

2009Box 1ENHANCED CREDIT SUPPORT IN TIMES OF FINANCIAL DISTRESSThe enhanced credit support provided by the ECB in response to the Þ nancial crisis comprised 
a set of non-standard measures that aimed to support Þ nancing conditions and credit 
ß ows above and beyond what could be achieved through reductions in key ECB interest rates alone. This approach was tailored to the Þ nancial structure of the euro area economy and the speci
Þ c circumstances of the global Þ nancial crisis. It focused on banks, as they are the primary source of 
Þ nancing for the real economy in the euro area. The ECB™s enhanced credit support 
1 comprised the following Þ ve measures: 
the provision to euro area banks of unlimited liquidity at a Þ xed rate in all re
Þ nancing  Œ
operations against adequate collateral;
the lengthening of the maximum maturity of reÞ nancing operations from three months prior  Œ
to the crisis to one year; 
the extension of the list of assets accepted as collateral;  Œ
the provision of liquidity in foreign currencies (notably US dollars); and  Œ
outright purchases in the covered bond market.  Œ
The non-standard measures adopted were designed so that they could be phased out once the 
situation had normalised. Their main aim was to mitigate the adverse effects that dysfunctional 
money markets were having on the liquidity situation of solvent banks in the euro area. The 
measures were also intended to support the ß ow of credit to 
Þ rms and households. The decision 
to purchase covered bonds outright was taken in order to support the covered bond market, which 
is a very important Þ nancial market in Europe and a primary source of 
Þ nancing for banks. 
In the context of subdued inß ationary pressures and a severe downturn in the euro area economy, 
the ECB™s non-standard measures supported both the banking sector™s access to liquidity and the 
recovery of the euro area economy. They contributed to an improvement in Þ nancing conditions 
in the euro area and supported credit ß ows to the economy. The covered bond purchases fostered 
primary issuance and reduced the particularly elevated spreads in this market. As a result of the 
enhanced credit support and the strong reduction in key ECB interest rates between October 2008 
and May 2009, money market interest rates, money market spreads and interest rates on bank 
loans declined signiÞ cantly. The enhanced credit support fostered a considerable improvement 
in market liquidity and helped to alleviate funding risks. Following improvements in Þ nancial market conditions in the course of 2009, the Governing 
Council announced in early December that it would gradually phase out those non-standard measures that were no longer needed. As of the Þ rst quarter of 2010, the number and frequency 
of longer-term reÞ nancing operations were gradually scaled back. The last one-year operation 
was conducted in December 2009 and the last six-month operation in March 2010, while the 
number of three-month operations was reduced as of the Þ rst quarter of 2010. In early March the 
Governing Council decided to return to variable rate tender procedures in the regular three-month 
longer-term reÞ nancing operations, starting with the operation to be allotted on 28 April 2010.

2009The cyclical slowdown in the euro area, which 
had started in 2007, turned into a recession in 

the Þ rst half of 2008 and then into an abrupt 
contraction in the winter of 2008-09, as the 

Þ nancial turmoil deepened following the 
collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 

2008. This led to record declines in business 

and consumer conÞ dence worldwide. Amid a 
severe downturn in the world economy, real 

GDP in the euro area fell by 2.5% quarter on 

quarter in the Þ rst quarter of 2009. Quarterly 
growth rates of real GDP turned positive 

again in the second half of the year, in an 

environment of improved Þ nancial market and 
economic conditions following considerable 

support from Þ scal and monetary policies. 
Overall, euro area real GDP contracted 

by 4.0% in 2009, after having grown by 

0.5% in 2008. 
Inß ationary pressures were low in 2009. The 
average annual inß ation rate in 2009 stood at 
0.3%, the lowest level recorded since the launch 
of the euro in January 1999, after a record high 
of 3.3% in 2008. Annual HICP inß ation fell 
from 1.1% in January to -0.7% in July, before 

increasing again to 0.9% in December. The wide 

swing in the overall annual HICP inß ation rate 
in 2009 was driven mainly by developments in 

commodity prices, and energy prices in particular, 

reversing the upswing seen in 2008, and the 

corresponding base effects. Despite the fact that 

inß ation dropped into negative territory for a few 
months, survey-based measures of long-term 

inß ation expectations remained 
Þ rmly anchored 
at levels consistent with the Governing Council™s 

aim of keeping inß ation rates below, but close to, 
2% in the medium term. 
The underlying pace of monetary expansion in the euro area decelerated over 2009, and broad 
money and credit growth declined to their 
lowest levels since the start of Monetary Union. 
The outcome of the monetary analysis thus 
conÞ rmed the assessment of low in
ß ationary pressures.Furthermore, an additional six-day Þ ne-tuning operation was announced in order to smooth out 
the liquidity effect of the 12-month longer-term reÞ nancing operation maturing on 1 July 2010.
The Governing Council also decided to continue conducting both the main reÞ nancing operations 
and the special-term reÞ nancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as 
Þ xed 
rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until October 2010.Following these decisions, the Eurosystem continues to provide liquidity support to the banking 
system of the euro area at very favourable conditions, thereby facilitating the provision of credit to 

the euro area. At the same time, the gradual phasing-out of the ECB™s non-standard measures helps 

to ensure smooth conditions in money markets and to avoid distortions associated with maintaining 

non-standard measures for longer than needed. Improvements in Þ nancial conditions allow banks to 
begin performing part of their ﬁnormalﬂ role in the money market, thereby reducing the need for the 

Eurosystem to play an extensive intermediation role. Keeping all non-standard measures in place 

for longer than needed would result in particular in an excessive reliance on exceptional central 

bank liquidity and associated moral hazard problems. In addition, it would weaken incentives for 

banks to continue with the necessary structural adjustments in their balance sheets. 
Looking ahead, the Governing Council will continue to gradually phase out those extraordinary liquidity measures that are no longer needed, taking economic and Þ nancial market developments 
into account. The Eurosystem™s operational framework will continue to support monetary policy 
in the fulÞ lment of the price stability mandate. In this respect, if upside risks to price stability 
were to emerge, the Eurosystem would take timely and appropriate action. 19ECBAnnual Report
2009INTEREST RATE CUTS AND EXTENSION 
OF ENHANCED CREDIT SUPPORT DURING 

THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN 
Looking at monetary policy decisions in 2009 
in more detail, information available at the 
beginning of that year conÞ rmed a broad-based 
global economic downturn at the turn of the 
year. The intensiÞ cation of 
Þ nancial tensions 
had led to substantial volatility in all Þ nancial market segments, low levels of liquidity across a 
number of market segments and forceful action 
by governments and central banks. The Þ nancial market turmoil had also resulted in a substantial 
increase in uncertainty and investors™ risk 
aversion, as reß ected, for example, in a sizeable 
widening in corporate and sovereign bond 
spreads towards the end of 2008. This in turn 
had a signiÞ cant adverse impact on the world 
economy. In line with global developments, 
the euro area experienced a signiÞ cant drop in 
output. In a climate of heightened uncertainty, 
a severe fall in world trade volumes was 
accompanied by a pronounced decline in 
domestic demand in the euro area.Both headline inß ation and underlying 
inß ationary pressures declined signi
Þ cantly in the Þ rst few months of 2009. Annual HICP 
inß ation rates decreased from 1.1% in January 
to 0.0% in May, owing in particular to earlier strong declines in commodity prices. At this 
time, it was anticipated that price, cost and wage 
pressures in the euro area would moderate, given 
the expectation of dampened global and euro 
area demand for a protracted period of time. 
In view of base effects related to the high 
levels of energy prices in mid-2008, inß ation rates were expected to be negative for a couple 
of months around the middle of 2009, before 
returning to positive territory towards the end of 
the year. Cross-checking with the outcome of the 
monetary analysis, which conÞ rmed a continued 
deceleration in the pace of monetary expansion 
and subdued ß ows of loans to non-
Þ nancial corporations and households, supported the 
assessment of diminishing inß ationary pressures 
and risks to price stability in the medium term. Against this background, between January 
and May 2009 the Governing Council reduced 
the rate on the main reÞ nancing operations by 
150 basis points, to 1%, in four steps, bringing 
the total reduction since 8 October 2008 to 
325 basis points. In May it also decided to lower 
the rate on the marginal lending facility by 
50 basis points, to 1.75%, leaving the interest 
rate on the deposit facility unchanged at 
0.25%, which narrowed the differential between 
these two rates from 200 to 150 basis points. In addition to cutting interest rates, the 
Governing Council proceeded further with its 

enhanced credit support measures. Following 

on from the operations undertaken since 

October 2008, the Governing Council decided 

in May 2009 to conduct three liquidity-
providing longer-term reÞ nancing operations 
(LTROs) with a maturity of 12 months in June, 

September and December 2009. These measures 

exerted signiÞ cant downward pressure on 
money market rates as they ensured that banks 

had broad and deep access to liquidity for a 

more extended horizon, thereby increasing 

their ability to lend to the real economy and 

placing downward pressure on bank lending 

rates. Furthermore, the Governing Council 

decided that the Eurosystem would purchase 

euro-denominated covered bonds issued in 

the euro area for a total of •60 billion over a 

period of 12 months, starting in July 2009. This 

decision aimed to support the covered bond 

market, which is a very important segment 

of the Þ nancial market in the euro area and a 
primary source of Þ nancing for banks. 
The decision to extend the enhanced credit support 

took into account the expectation that price 

developments would continue to be dampened, 

beyond the substantial earlier fall in commodity 

prices, by the marked weakening of economic 

activity in the euro area and globally. The available 

economic data and survey information suggested 

tentative signs of a stabilisation in activity at very 

low levels, after a Þ rst quarter which had been 
signiÞ cantly weaker than expected. This was in 
20ECBAnnual Report
2009line with downward revisions to the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections for euro 

area economic activity and inß ation in the 
Þ rst 
half of the year. The world economy, including 

the euro area, was expected to remain weak over 

2009 before gradually recovering in the course 

of 2010, while inß ationary pressures in the euro 
area remained low. 
Given the ongoing generous liquidity provision by the Eurosystem and the limited number 
of liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning operations, 
overnight interest rates continued to stand close 
to the rate on the deposit facility, which had 
been the case since the introduction of the Þ xed rate tender procedure with full allotment in 
October 2008. The new positioning of the 
overnight money market rate was considered 
acceptable in these exceptional circumstances 
as a means of helping to offset the impaired 
functioning of the money market and, in 
particular, the abnormally high spreads on term 
money market rates, e.g. those between the 
EURIBOR and the rates on overnight index 
swaps. The enhanced credit support measures 
thus also contributed to an environment of 
lower market interest rates and favourable 
funding conditions. In particular, the Þ rst 12-month LTRO, conducted on 24 June 2009, 
resulted in a record •442 billion being allotted 
to the euro area banking system at a Þ xed rate 
of 1%, bringing the total volume of outstanding 
reÞ nancing operations to nearly •900 billion, 
and thereby contributed to lower money market 
rates also at longer maturities. ONGOING MONETARY POLICY SUPPORT AMID 

GRADUAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
While keeping its key interest rates unchanged 
from May 2009 onwards, the Governing 
Council continued with its substantial enhanced 
credit support measures in the second half of 
the year, given their positive impact on the 
functioning of the euro area money market 
and on the transmission of monetary policy 
impulses in an environment of low inß ationary pressures. This very accommodative monetary 
policy stance was in line with the ECB™s price stability mandate and contributed to the gradual 
economic recovery in the euro area.Over the second half of 2009 there were signs of a stabilisation in economic activity in the euro 
area and beyond. The stabilisation in the euro 
area was Þ rst indicated by survey data and the 
decline in risk aversion in Þ nancial markets, 
which led to a recovery in asset prices from the 
record lows reached in the period between the 
collapse of Lehman Brothers and the end of 
the Þ rst quarter of 2009. The gradual recovery 
was subsequently conÞ rmed by real economy 
indicators. Overall, economic activity remained 
weak, but quarterly growth rates turned positive 
in the third and fourth quarters of the year, after 
Þ ve consecutive quarters of negative readings. 
At the same time, adverse lagged effects from the 
strong economic downturn, such as low capacity 
utilisation and increasing unemployment rates, 
continued to materialise. Macroeconomic forecasts and projections, including the Eurosystem staff projections for 
the euro area, were revised upwards slightly 
during the second half of the year, mainly 
reß ecting the more positive developments and 
information that emerged progressively. In 
December 2009 Eurosystem staff projected 
annual real GDP growth of between 0.1% and 
1.5% in 2010 and between 0.2% and 2.2% in 
2011. In line with this, the Governing Council 
expected the euro area economy to grow at 
a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that 
the recovery process was likely to be uneven 
and that the outlook remained subject to high 
uncertainty. Risks to this outlook were seen as 
broadly balanced. On the upside, they related to 
stronger than anticipated effects of the extensive 
macroeconomic stimulus, improvements in 
conÞ dence and the recovery of foreign trade. 
On the downside, concerns remained relating 
to a stronger than expected negative feedback 
loop between the real economy and the Þ nancial sector, as well as renewed increases in oil and 
other commodity prices, the intensiÞ cation of 
protectionist pressures and the possibility of a 
disorderly correction of global imbalances.21ECBAnnual Report
2009As regards price developments, the annual HICP inß ation rate fell into negative territory 
between June and October 2009, reaching a 
trough of -0.7% in July. It turned positive again 
in November and stood at 0.9% in December. 
This proÞ le was in line with expectations and 
mainly reß ected temporary effects, in particular 
downward base effects related to the strong rise 
in commodity prices towards mid-2008 and 
their subsequent decline until the end of that 
year. Inß ation was expected to remain moderate 
over the policy-relevant horizon, with overall 
price, cost and wage developments staying 
subdued in line with a slow recovery in demand 
in the euro area and elsewhere. At the same 
time, inß ation expectations over the medium to 
longer term remained Þ rmly anchored in line 
with the Governing Council™s aim of keeping 
inß ation rates below, but close to, 2% over the 
medium term.The outlook for inß ation was broadly similar in 
the September and December projection rounds, with the December 2009 Eurosystem staff 
projections foreseeing annual HICP inß ation of 
between 0.9% and 1.7% in 2010 and between 
0.8% and 2.0% in 2011. Risks to this outlook 
were seen as broadly balanced. They related, 
in particular, to the outlook for economic 
activity and the evolution of commodity prices. 
Furthermore, it was thought that increases in 
indirect taxation and administered prices could 
be stronger than expected owing to the need for 
Þ scal consolidation in the coming years. 
The outcome of the monetary analysis conÞ rmed the assessment of low inß ationary pressures over 
the medium term, as money and credit growth 
continued to slow down over the second half of 
2009. Towards the end of the year, the annual 
growth rates of M3 and loans to the private 
sector were in negative territory. The subdued 
levels of production and trade, as well as the 
ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business 
outlook, continued in particular to dampen Þ rms™ demand for bank Þ nancing. To some extent, 
supply factors also played a role, as indicated by 
the Eurosystem bank lending survey for the euro 
area. The decline in annual growth rates of loans to non-Þ nancial corporations was particularly 
pronounced at shorter maturities, while the 
annual growth of longer-term loans remained 
positive. At the same time, after some months in 
negative territory, the annual growth of loans to 
households returned to positive levels towards 
the end of 2009. This pattern is in line with 
business cycle regularities, which indicate that 
the growth of loans to non-Þ nancial corporations 
normally picks up with some lag compared with 
the cycle in economic activity. The ongoing effects of the enhanced credit support continued to foster both the banking 
sector™s access to liquidity and the recovery of 
the euro area economy, thereby contributing to 
the normalisation of economic and Þ nancial conditions. In particular, the measures 
implemented by the Eurosystem supported 
the ß ow of credit to the economy through both 
supply factors (notably by alleviating funding 
pressures in the banking sector) and demand 
factors (owing to the very low level of interest 
rates). In addition, by emphasising its Þ rm focus on price stability and its readiness to act 
at the appropriate time, the Eurosystem acted 
as an anchor of stability in times of heightened 
uncertainty. This was instrumental in fostering 
conÞ dence in a context of expectations of a 
gradual recovery in economic activity. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, the Eurosystem™s policy action 
progressively fed through to the economy, 
providing substantial support to households and 
corporations. Financing conditions continued 
to improve. Money markets were functioning 
better and money market spreads had fallen 
considerably from the high levels observed at 
the beginning of the year. The past decreases 
in the ECB™s key policy rates were increasingly 
reß ected in bank lending rates, which had 
fallen to very low levels, indicating that the 
transmission process was functioning. Overall, 
improvements in Þ nancial market conditions 
and a gradual expansion of euro area economic 
activity were seen towards the end of 2009 and 
at the beginning of 2010 amid continued strong 
support to the euro area banking sector. 22ECBAnnual Report
2009Taking into account the ongoing improvement in Þ nancial market conditions and the need to 
avoid distortions associated with maintaining 
the non-standard measures for longer than 
necessary, in December 2009 the Governing 
Council decided to continue its enhanced 
credit support, while beginning to gradually 
phase out, from the Þ rst quarter of 2010, those 
non-standard measures that were no longer 
required. The Governing Council decided to 
conduct the main reÞ nancing operations as 
Þ xed rate tender procedures with full allotment for 
as long as needed, and to reduce the number 
and maturity of LTROs. It was decided that the 
one-year LTRO in December would be the last 
of its maturity and would be conducted at a rate 
equal to the average minimum bid rate over the 
life of the operation, and that only one further 
six-month operation would be conducted in 
March 2010. In addition, the Governing Council 
decided that the remaining LTROs in the Þ rst quarter of 2010 would be carried out using a 
full allotment Þ xed rate tender procedure. These 
decisions meant that the Eurosystem would 
continue to provide liquidity support to the 
banking system of the euro area for an extended 
period at very favourable conditions, thereby 
facilitating the provision of credit to the euro 
area economy. At the beginning of 2010 the Governing Council continued to view the level of the key ECB 
interest rates as appropriate. Taking into account 
information and analyses that had become 
available, price developments continued to be 
expected to remain subdued over the policy-
relevant horizon. Available evidence also 
conÞ rmed that the euro area continued to expand, 
while some of the supporting factors were 
temporary in nature, notably the inventory cycle 
and the policy support measures worldwide. 
Overall, the Governing Council expected the 
euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace 
in 2010, with the outlook remaining subject 
to uncertainty. At the same time, inß ation expectations remained Þ rmly anchored in line 
with price stability. Cross-checking the outcome 
of the economic analysis with the signals from 
the monetary analysis conÞ rmed the assessment 
of low inß ationary pressures, given the parallel 
decline in money and credit growth.23ECBAnnual Report
20092 MONETARY, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS2.1 THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC 
ENVIRONMENT 
SEVERE REPERCUSSIONS OF THE FINANCIAL 
MARKET TENSIONS ON GLOBAL ACTIVITYIn the wake of the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial 
turmoil that accompanied the collapse of 
Lehman Brothers in September 2008, perceived 
uncertainty rose across all asset classes to 
historical highs and remained persistently 
heightened throughout the Þ rst quarter of 2009. 
In this period the functioning of Þ nancial markets continued to be impaired, while 
the prevailing conditions of high levels of 
uncertainty fuelled large drops in business and 
consumer conÞ dence indicators, both of which 
reached very low levels by historical standards. 
As anticipated by a sharp and broad-based 
fall in the global manufacturing 
Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) to well below the contraction-expansion threshold, as well as by 
the above-mentioned drops in both business and 
consumer conÞ dence, global economic activity 
remained very weak, after having contracted 
sharply across all of the main economic areas 
in the last quarter of 2008. Notwithstanding the 
important and unprecedented measures taken 
by governments and central banks around the 
world to limit systemic risks and to restore 
Þ nancial stability, global activity was hampered, 
especially as a result of the need of Þ rms and 
households to adjust their balance sheets, which, 
combined with adverse wealth effects, added to 
the declines in conÞ dence. In addition, while 
this was not the case for most of 2008, emerging 
markets began to be affected by the slowdown 
in advanced economies, as world trade 
recorded an unprecedented and synchronised 
drop during late 2008 and early 2009 
(the latter is described in detail in Box 2). Global activity returned to positive territory in the second quarter of 2009 (see top panel of Chart 2) 
as the Þ scal and monetary policy measures put 
in place in many countries gained additional 
traction and, together with measures aimed at 
stabilising the Þ nancial sector, contributed to the 
improvement of Þ nancial market conditions and 
the reduction of uncertainty, and led to some initial 
reversal in the conÞ dence losses experienced 
by economic agents. At the same time, world 
trade also began to stabilise and then rise again 
following the Þ rst quarter of 2009, although this recovery started from very depressed levels. 
The global recovery gained pace in the 
second half of 2009 and GDP growth returned 
to positive territory in the vast majority Chart 2 Main developments in major

2009of countries in the third quarter of the year. Global manufacturing activity was the key 
driver of the economic recovery, although, 
after some faltering, activity in the services 
sector also gained traction. One major feature 
of the recovery phase is the different speed 
at which it is taking place across countries, 
a development which possibly reß ects, among 
other factors, the different nature of the policy 
measures adopted in the various countries, as 
well as the different strength of each country™s 
fundamentals. The emergence of a cross-country 
divergence in the recovery phase contrasts 
with the high synchronisation exhibited during 
the downturn, possibly highlighting the extent 
to which the Þ nancial turbulence contributed 
to the ampliÞ cation of real disturbances. 
It is also worth noting that activity is recovering 
at a much faster pace in emerging economies, 
which had limited direct exposure to the 
Þ nancial crisis. Notwithstanding positive 
signals, concerns about the global growth 
outlook remain. These concerns relate, in 
particular, to whether the gradual phasing-out 
of the extraordinary monetary and Þ scal policy 
measures will be accompanied by a pick-up in 
private demand, given the signiÞ cant adjustment 
in household balance sheets that is likely to 
occur in many countries, as well as the Þ nancial constraints that Þ rms may still be facing. 
After peaking at 4.8% in OECD countries in 
July 2008, boosted by rising food and energy 
prices, headline inß ation started to fall at a quick 
pace, standing at around 0.5% in spring 2009 
(see bottom panel of Chart 2). This rapid retreat 
in inß ation re
ß ected the strong downward 
correction in commodity prices, as well as 
rising spare capacity, as a result of the global 
drop in economic activity. In the middle of the 
year, OECD inß ation actually turned slightly 
negative owing to signiÞ cant base effects related 
to commodity prices. However, the negative 
inß ation rates were, by and large, perceived to be a 
transitory phenomenon, as evidenced by measures 

of long-term inß ation expectations, which 
remained in positive territory. In October 2009, 
on account of the fading of these base effects 
and of a rebound in commodity prices, headline 
inß ation returned to positive territory and rose 
to 1.9% in the year to December 2009, down 
from 3.6% the year before. Excluding food and 
energy, inß ation stood at 1.6% in the year to 
December 2009. Box 2THE GLOBAL TRADE DOWNTURN 
World trade contracted sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the Þ rst quarter of 2009 following 
the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial crisis in September 2008 and the associated downturn in global 
activity. The decline in trade was unprecedented in the post-war period in terms of its speed, 
magnitude and the high degree of synchronisation across countries. This box assesses the main 
factors driving the contraction in trade and looks at the prospects for global trade.With the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial turmoil in the autumn of 2008, global economic activity 
fell abruptly, resulting in a strong decline in the global trade in goods back to 2005 levels (see Chart A). The decline was sharp and rapid: world trade in goods fell by almost 17% between 
September 2008 and February 2009. It was also highly synchronised across regions.1The main factor behind the collapse in trade was the sharp contraction in global demand. Global 
economic activity declined abruptly, with output levels falling by 1.2% in the fourth quarter 1 According to the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis database, over 90% of countries reported declines in exp
ort values of more than 5% in quarterly terms at the beginning of 2009, while almost 15% of countries reported declines of above 20%.
25ECBAnnual Report
2009of 2008 and by 1.4% in the Þ rst quarter of 
2009. However, trade volumes fell by much more than expected given the size of the 
overall decline in Þ nal demand. This can be 
partly explained by a number of factors.First, the composition of the global demand shock 
contributed signiÞ cantly to the disproportionately 
large decline in trade relative to output. Global 

activity in the manufacturing sector contracted 

considerably with the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial turmoil, while activity in the services 
sector was much less affected. Consequently, the 

decline in global demand primarily affected trade 

in goods, which accounts for a much larger share 

of trade than of GDP. As the manufacturing 

sector produces and consumes large volumes of 

intermediate goods, there was also a magniÞ cation 
effect via trade in intermediate goods. Moreover, 

the recession led to a shift away from trade-
intensive GDP components, such as investment, 
to other components, such as government consumption, while the fall in exports also exacerbated the 

decline in trade as they are highly import-intensive. The Þ nancial crisis and the simultaneous con
Þ dence 
shock also led Þ rms to abruptly reduce their inventories and their investment in capital goods. 
As a result, trade in intermediate and capital goods contracted much more than trade in consumer 

goods, driving a wedge between developments in trade and those in GDP. 
Second, the increase in the responsiveness of trade to ß uctuations in demand may also be partly 
explained by structural changes related to the globalisation process. Empirical evidence shows 
that the elasticity of world trade to world income has increased over recent decades. In addition, 

the response of trade is estimated to be even higher during global downturns.2 This can be partly 
explained by an acceleration in globalisation trends over recent years, in particular the increased 

role of global supply chains in international trade. The globalisation of production processes, 

facilitated by an overall reduction in trade barriers and transportation costs, has led to considerable 

growth in vertical supply integration over recent years 3 (see Chart B), which is estimated to have 
accounted for about one-third of total export growth in the last 20 to 30 years.4 This implies that 
goods are now manufactured via complex international networks, with Þ rms in different countries 
working on different stages of the production of the same good in an international supply chain. 

These increasingly complex international supply chains may have acted as an additional propagation, 

and even ampliÞ cation, mechanism of the recent trade contraction, which would also be consistent 
with the large fall in trade in intermediate goods mentioned above. However, given the lack of timely 

data, it is still not entirely clear how cross-border supply chains have evolved in response to the 

Þ nancial crisis and what may have been their relative contribution to the trade collapse.

2009Lastly, there are a number of other factors which are also likely to have played an important role. For instance, the rapid tightening of credit standards following the Þ nancial turmoil 
generated a shortage of trade credit Þ nance that may have further dampened trade activities. 
This, in turn, may have also created bottlenecks in international supply chains, aggravating the 
trade decline. According to estimates by the World Bank, the drying-up of trade Þ nance may 
have accounted for some 10% to 15% of the decline in world trade since the second half of 2008. 
However, recent survey-based evidence has also suggested that the decline in trade Þ nance levels 
is related not only to disruptions on the supply side, but also to a decline in the demand for trade 
Þ nance, given that trade activities were decreasing. 
As regards the euro area, in line with the developments in world trade, euro area trade ß ows also 
fell sharply after the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial turmoil. Euro area exports of goods declined 
by around 19% between September 2008 and February 2009. The fall in extra-euro area trade 
ß ows was stronger vis-à-vis other EU and advanced economies. By contrast, the decline in trade 
with emerging economies was slower to materialise. In terms of the composition, exports of 
capital and intermediate goods both declined by more than 20%, while exports of consumer 
goods (including durable consumer goods) fell by about 11% (see Chart C).Current situation and future prospectsFollowing the severe contraction at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, world trade is increasingly showing signs of stabilisation. In the third quarter of 2009 world merchandise 
trade increased by 4%, as compared with a decline of about 11% in the Þ rst quarter of the year. World trade beneÞ ted strongly from the impact of temporary factors such as the macroeconomic stimulus plans, which boosted demand for durable goods, in particular cars. The supportive 
inventory cycle following the rebound in manufacturing activity and the gradual reactivation 
of global supply chains has also contributed to the recovery in global trade.Chart B Index of world vertical supply

2009The recovery in trade ß ows was mainly 
led by Asia, and, in particular, by a strong rebound in Chinese demand probably 
largely related to the Þ scal stimulus. 
Extra-euro area exports have also beneÞ ted from increased demand from Asia, which has 
partly compensated for the fact that demand 
from most advanced economies is still subdued 
(see Chart D). In terms of product breakdown, 
the improvements have been more pronounced 
for intermediate goods, partly as a result of 
the turn in the inventory cycle outside the 
euro area.In line with recent developments, prospects for both world trade and euro area exports 
have improved notably of late. It may be the 
case that global supply chains are helping 
to amplify the trade recovery via the same 
mechanisms which seemed to exacerbate the 
trade contraction. However, the short-lived 
nature of some of the factors behind the 
recent upturn in economic activity suggests that there may be a risk that this rebound in world 
economic activity and thus also of world trade could experience some loss of momentum in the 
coming quarters. Looking further ahead, the recovery in world trade will hinge heavily upon the 
extent of the recovery in world demand and the composition of expenditure. In this respect, a 
resurgence of protectionist policies around the world would potentially dampen the outlook for 
world trade. Given the disruptive implications for the world economy, as evidenced during the 
Great Depression, any protectionist measures should be strongly discouraged. Such measures 
would not only signiÞ cantly impair the global recovery process by further hampering trade 
ß ows and global demand, they would also reduce global growth potential in the long run.5 5 See the box entitled ﬁThe risks of protectionismﬂ in the September 2009 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.

extra-euro area, the United Kingdom and other EU Member 
States (November 2009).UNITED STATESEconomic activity was weak in the United States, and in 2009 as a whole the economy contracted 
at a rate of 2.4%, compared with growth of 
0.4% in 2008. Real GDP continued to post 
consecutive negative quarterly growth rates 
in the Þ rst half of 2009, following the sharp 
downturn in the second half of the previous 
year. However, a gradual stabilisation in 
Þ nancial market conditions, sizeable 
Þ scal and 
monetary stimuli and a turn in the inventory 
cycle in the course of the year led to a return 
to positive economic growth in the second half 
of 2009. Private domestic spending remained subdued in the Þ rst half of 2009 in the context 
of tight credit conditions, the efforts of 
households to rebuild their net wealth and scale 
down debt accumulated over previous years, 
and deteriorating labour market conditions; over 
8.4 million jobs were lost in 2008 and 2009. 
Government stimulus measures temporarily 
supported private demand, particularly in the 
auto and housing sectors. Businesses continued 
to cut back on Þ xed investment amid tight 
lending conditions, low capacity utilisation and 
the uncertain economic outlook. Housing market 
activity started to pick up in mid-2009 with 
the support of government stimulus measures, 28ECBAnnual Report
2009but the recovery continued to be held back by substantial headwinds. Export performance 
was weak in early 2009 owing to a downturn in 
foreign economic activity. Nevertheless, foreign 
trade contributed positively to growth as imports 
fell more sharply than exports. However, 
both exports and imports recovered in the 
second half of the year. Overall, the current 
account deÞ cit narrowed sharply from 4.9% 
of GDP in 2008 to 2.9% on average in the Þ rst three quarters of 2009, mainly as a result of the 
contraction of domestic demand and the drop in 
oil prices. As regards price developments, the average annual change in the CPI for 2009 was -0.4%, 
down from 3.8% the year before. Headline 
inß ation moved into negative territory in 
early 2009, reß ecting strong base effects 
stemming from lower commodity prices. 
The annual rate of change in the CPI moved 
back into positive territory in late 2009 owing 
to an increase in commodity prices and a 
reversal of base effects. Economic slack limited 
any upward pressures on prices. Inß ation excluding food and energy also decreased 
moderately during 2009, but remained positive 
at an average annual rate of 1.7% in 2009 
(compared with 2.3% in 2008). The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System kept the federal 
funds rate target within a range of 0% to 0.25% throughout the year and reiterated that it anticipated that economic conditions were likely 
to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal 
funds rate for an extended period. In addition, 
the Federal Reserve extended its use of non-
conventional policy measures to promote the 
ß ow of credit to the private sector and initiated 
purchase programmes for longer-term securities 
to support the functioning of credit markets. As regards Þ scal policy, the federal budget 
deÞ cit widened to about 10% of GDP in the 2009 
Þ scal year Œ which ended in September 2009 Œ 
compared with 3.2% in the previous year. The increase reß ected a sharp drop in revenues 
owing to lower tax receipts and a substantial increase in spending as a result of Þ scal measures aiming to support the Þ nancial system 
and the economy. JAPANIn Japan, economic activity deteriorated 
signiÞ cantly in the 
Þ rst quarter of 2009, 
before entering a recovery phase in the second 
quarter. The downturn was primarily related 
to an unprecedented decline in exports and 
production. The improvement in the economic 
situation was mainly driven by an upturn in 
exports, reß ecting, in part, the strong recovery 
in other Asian economies and the turnaround 
in the inventory cycle. Moreover, the recovery 
was supported by the internal and external Þ scal stimulus packages. Business sentiment improved moderately from the second quarter of 2009 onwards, 
but corporate proÞ ts remained at a low level 
and employees™ income decreased substantially. 

In addition, the unemployment rate rose 
to an all-time high of 5.7% in July 2009, 
before decreasing slightly. Annual consumer price inß ation turned negative 
in February 2009 and the pace of decline peaked at 2.5% in October. Price developments mainly 
reß ected base effects related to petroleum 
products and the substantial slack persisting in 
the economy. In December 2009 the Bank of 
Japan announced that it recognised deß ation as 
a ﬁcritical challengeﬂ. From December 2008 and throughout 2009, the Bank of Japan left its uncollateralised 
overnight call rate unchanged at 0.1%. In order 
to stimulate the economy, the Bank of Japan 
continued to use non-conventional monetary 
policy measures, such as outright purchases of 
Japanese government bonds and the expansion 
of the range of eligible collateral. EMERGING ASIAIn 2009 emerging Asia showed notable 
resilience to the global downturn. In the Þ rst quarter of 2009 the collapse of foreign trade 
led to negative real GDP growth rates in the 29ECBAnnual Report
2009export-oriented economies of Hong Kong S.A.R., Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan 
P.o.C. and Thailand. China, India and Indonesia, 
on the other hand, posted lower but still positive 
economic growth in the same period. Boosted 
by large Þ scal stimulus packages and 
expansionary monetary policy, emerging Asia 
began to recover in the second quarter and 
recorded annual real GDP growth of 5.7%.In 2009 consumer price inß ation dropped 
considerably in most Asian emerging markets. 
Only India experienced rising food prices 

towards the end of the year, which caused a 

noticeable upward movement in the wholesale 

price index, the Reserve Bank of India™s 

preferred measure of prices. Given emerging 

Asia™s marked macroeconomic improvement 

from the second quarter of 2009 onwards and 

the gradual increase in investors™ risk appetite, 

foreign capital, especially portfolio investment, 

began ß owing back into these countries in 
March 2009, thus leading to a steady rebound in 

local bond and equity markets. In many countries, 

increased capital inß ows coincided with 
substantial current account surpluses, which led 

to strong upward pressures on exchange rates. 
As regards the Chinese economy, real GDP 
growth declined only slightly, from 9.6% 

in 2008 to 8.7% in 2009. The resilience of 

GDP growth to the global economic downturn 

can be explained by several factors. First, 

the Chinese authorities reacted promptly to the 

crisis. The RMB 4 trillion stimulus package 

and increased consumer subsidies, combined 

with an expansive monetary policy and strong 

credit growth, contributed to the 90% increase in 

investment in infrastructure in 2009 and to the 

resilience of private consumption. Second, given 

that the value-added content of Chinese exports 

is relatively low (as the import content of Chinese 

exports is relatively high), the direct impact of 

the global export slowdown on GDP growth was 

less severe. The trade surplus in 2009 declined 

by 33% in US dollar terms compared with 2008, 

mainly as a result of temporary factors. Finally, 

owing to the ongoing restrictions on inward and 

outward portfolio investments, banks™ balance 
sheets were not severely impacted and capital 

outß ows from China remained limited, thereby 
mitigating the impact on domestic consumption 

and investment. Annual consumer price inß ation 
was negative between February and October 2009 

owing to base effects, with underlying price 

pressures remaining moderate. From the second 

quarter of 2009 capital inß ows returned to their 
pre-crisis levels and foreign exchange reserve 

accumulation continued at a fast pace, reaching 

USD 2.4 trillion by the end of 2009. 
LATIN AMERICAEconomic activity in Latin America contracted 
sharply during the Þ rst half of 2009, following 
a very similar pattern to that of the world 
economy. In year-on-year terms, real GDP 
for the region as a whole contracted by 2.8% 
in the Þ rst quarter of 2009 and by 3.9% in the 
second (although in quarter-on-quarter terms, 
it expanded by 0.4% in the second quarter). 
For the region as a whole, the fall in economic 
activity in the Þ rst half of 2009 was the worst 
since quarterly statistical records began in 1980, 
even though several individual countries have 
experienced more severe recessions during the 
past three decades. However, by contrast with 
past episodes, there was no Þ nancial crisis in the 
region, despite the sharp real adjustment.In the course of the second quarter of 2009,  
rising commodity prices and demand, as well as 
Þ scal and monetary stimulus measures, started 
to support the economic recovery, albeit with 
some heterogeneity across economies. In the 
case of Brazil, the recovery was particularly 
fast, in part thanks to the relatively sound 
behaviour of the labour market, the Þ scal stimulus and the authorities™ success in easing 
the tight credit conditions arising from the 
international Þ nancial crisis. By contrast, 
in Mexico, the series of shocks impacting the 
country (including the decline in remittances 
and swine ß u), its greater exposure to the 
United States, the sharp deterioration in its 
labour market and the relative stickiness of 
inß ation help to explain why the adjustment 
proved to be sharper and more protracted. 
At the same time, inß ationary pressures 
30ECBAnnual Report
2009continued to ease across Latin America as a whole. This led central banks across the region 
to relax monetary conditions throughout the 
Þ rst half of the year. The IMF also approved the 
granting of the new Flexible Credit Line facility 
to Mexico and Colombia for an amount of 
SDR 31.6 billion and SDR 7 billion respectively. 
As global Þ nancial conditions gradually started 
to improve and risk appetite returned, spreads 
on credit default swaps on Latin American 
sovereign debt narrowed, stock prices increased 
signiÞ cantly and 
Þ nancial ß ows returned, 
resulting in currency appreciations. In some 
cases, however, these were limited on account 
of central bank intervention. Meanwhile, some 
countries (Brazil and Peru) also introduced 
some form of capital controls. COMMODITY PRICES RECOVERED IN 2009After falling abruptly in the second half of 2008, 
oil prices stabilised in the Þ rst quarter of 2009, 
and subsequently started to increase. At the end 
of 2009 the price of Brent crude oil stood at 
USD 77.8 per barrel. Measured in euro terms, 
this corresponds to roughly the level recorded 
at the beginning of 2006. For the year as a 
whole, the average price of Brent crude oil was 
USD 62.5 per barrel, i.e. 36.4% below the 
average of the previous year. During the Þ rst quarter of 2009 oil prices were 
kept at low levels by the impact of the Þ nancial crisis and the subsequent economic downturn, which had a strong negative effect on demand 
prospects. Facing such a massive contraction in 
demand, OPEC acted promptly with a sizeable 
reduction of its quotas, and its member states 
adhered to the agreed supply cuts. Against 
the background of such a large contraction in 
supply and less pessimistic feelings about global 
economic prospects, oil prices started to recover 
in the second quarter of 2009. The economic downturn led to a strong deterioration in expectations regarding oil 
demand in 2009. Although a strong contraction 
in demand did materialise, especially in developed economies, the decline was 
much lower than expected, particularly in 
emerging economies, where Þ scal stimuli were 
broadly resource-intensive. Consequently, 
from May 2009 onwards, the International 
Energy Agency repeatedly revised its demand 
projections for 2009 and 2010 upwards. 
The improvement in demand prospects was 
partly behind the price increases throughout 
the year. The prices of non-energy commodities followed a similar pattern (see Chart 3). Metal prices, 
copper in particular, posted signiÞ cant gains, 
which were also sustained by purchases related 
to the massive stimulus package, geared 
towards infrastructure, announced by the Chinese government. Food prices also increased, 
although to a lesser extent, led in particular 
by sugar. In aggregate terms, non-energy 
commodity prices (denominated in US dollars) 
decreased by an average of approximately 22% 
in 2009 compared with the previous year.Chart 3 Main developments in commodity

20092.2 MONETARY AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS 
THE PACE OF UNDERLYING MONETARY EXPANSION 
DECLINED IN THE COURSE OF THE YEARThe pace of underlying monetary expansion, 
which captures the trends in monetary data that 
provide the relevant signals as regards risks to 
price stability, declined further in the course 
of 2009.1 This was reß ected in the approximately 
parallel declines observed in the annual growth 
rates of the broad monetary aggregate M3 and 
MFI loans to the private sector. At the end 
of the year these growth rates stood at -0.3% 
and -0.1% respectively, substantially lower than 
the 7.6% and 5.7% seen at the end of 2008 and 
the rates of around 11% recorded at the end 
of 2007 (see Chart 4). The continuous decline observed in annual M3 growth in the course of the year largely reß ected the strong downward impact of the exceptionally 
steep yield curve, which encouraged shifts from 
monetary assets into longer-term assets outside 
M3. As a result, headline monetary developments 
understated the pace of underlying monetary expansion in 2009. This was broadly a reversal 
of the situation in 2008, when the impact of the 
ß at yield curve kept M3 growth above the trend 
rate of broad monetary expansion. The steady declines observed in 2009 in the annual growth rates of money and credit 
aggregates masked the fact that the intensiÞ cation of Þ nancial market tensions following Lehman 
Brothers™ bankruptcy in mid-September 2008 
was associated with fairly abrupt changes 
in monetary developments. In the aftermath 
of that event, the shorter-term growth rates 
(i.e. three-month annualised growth rates) of M3 
and loans to the private sector ß uctuated fairly 
erratically around zero during most of 2009. 
However, looking at the information embedded 
in developments for the various sectors and 
the individual components and counterparts 
of M3, the sharp slowdown observed in the 
growth of M3 and loans at the end of 2008 and 
the beginning of 2009 appears not to have been 
accompanied by an equally sharp slowdown in 
underlying monetary growth. Moreover, the negative annual growth rates recorded in 2009 for M3 and loans should be 
seen against the backdrop of the high levels of 
monetary liquidity and indebtedness that had 
accumulated in the years prior to the Þ nancial turmoil. It is therefore natural for there to be 
some unwinding of these levels. Such unwinding 
could potentially have resulted in the growth rates 
of M3 and loans declining more strongly and for 
a longer period of time than would be expected, 
for instance, on the basis of developments in 
economic activity or interest rates. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COMPONENTS OF M3 

WERE INFLUENCED MAINLY BY THE STEEP 

YIELD CURVEThe decline observed in annual M3 growth 

in the course of 2009 concealed a reasonable 

amount of heterogeneity in its main components 

(see Chart 5). This decline was accounted for

2009primarily by the increasingly negative annual 
growth rates of both short-term deposits other 

than overnight deposits (i.e. M2-M1) and 

marketable instruments (i.e. M3-M2), which 

stood at -9.1% and -11.0% respectively in 

December. On the other hand, the annual 

growth rate of M1 strengthened signiÞ cantly to 
stand at a very robust 12.3% in December. 

The heterogeneity in the growth of the various 

components of M3 stemmed from the low 

level of interest rates and the increasingly 

narrow spreads between the interest rates paid 

on the various monetary assets. As a result, 

the opportunity cost of holding the most liquid 

monetary assets was low, leading to funds 

being shifted from short-term time deposits 

(i.e. deposits with an agreed maturity of up 

to two years) and marketable instruments 

into overnight deposits. However, there were 

also shifts into short-term savings deposits 

(i.e. deposits redeemable at notice of up to three 

months), as these remained somewhat better 

remunerated than short-term time deposits 

(see Chart 6). This substitution within M3 was 

in addition to the shifts out of M3 triggered by 

the steep yield curve.The fact that banks very noticeably 
reduced the remuneration of short-term 
deposits and marketable instruments as 
of late 2008 also reß ected their access to 
additional sources of funding. In particular, 
short-term funding pressures were largely 
alleviated by the Eurosystem™s provision of 
central bank liquidity, and banks were also able 
to attract longer-term funding in the context of 
the steep yield curve and to beneÞ t from the 
support provided by government guarantees 
covering the issuance of debt securities.SECTORAL MONEY HOLDINGS REFLECT 

THE IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC CYCLE 
The decline observed in annual M3 growth also 
concealed somewhat divergent developments in 
the money holdings of the individual sectors. 
The broadest aggregation of M3 components 
for which sectoral information is reported is 
short-term deposits and repurchase agreements 
(hereafter referred to as ﬁM3 depositsﬂ). 
The annual growth rate of households™ M3 
deposits declined in the course of the year and 
stood at 1.9% in December, down from 9.0% 
at the end of 2008 (see Chart 7). By contrast, Chart 6 MFI interest rates on short-term

2009the annual growth rate of the M3 deposits of non-Þ nancial corporations only declined 
until mid-2009 (temporarily turning slightly 
negative), before strengthening again during 
the second half of the year to stand at 5.4% 
in December. These divergent developments 
were consistent with the evolution of the 
economic cycle. In this respect, the relatively 
gradual decline seen in the growth rate of 
households™ M3 deposits (by comparison with 
the strengthening observed for non-Þ nancial corporations) reß ects the fact that households™ 
disposable income is typically more stable than 
economic activity. By contrast, Þ rms™ cash 
ß ows tend to improve early in the economic cycle and 
may then be used to establish liquidity buffers 
for the Þ nancing of production and investment 
activities in anticipation of an improvement in 
the economic environment. The gradual decline seen in 2009 in the annual 
growth rate of households™ M3 deposits was 

also very strongly affected by the steepening of 

the yield curve and the improvements observed 

in stock markets, which led households to 
shift funds from M3 deposits into longer-term
and arguably riskier assets outside M3. 

Those shifts may have masked increases in 

precautionary holdings of money resulting 

from the economic and Þ nancial uncertainty 
that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers. 

However, to the extent that this uncertainty 

concerned the situation in the banking sector 

and the safety of bank deposits, many of those 

additional holdings may have taken the form of 

longer-term deposits outside M3 following the 

extension of government guarantees on bank 

deposits. 
The annual growth rate of M3 deposits held 
by non-monetary Þ nancial intermediaries 
other than insurance corporations and pension 

funds (other Þ nancial intermediaries Œ OFIs) 
declined further in 2009, falling by more than 

18 percentage points to stand at -2.9% in 

December. This strong decline can be explained 

by the fact that OFIs typically react quickly to 

changes in the interest rate constellation, as well 

as by the reduction observed in securitisation 

activity, which entails the creation of OFI 

deposits held with the MFIs originating the 

securitised loans. 
GROWTH IN CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR 

DECLINED MARKEDLY 
On the counterpart side of M3, the annual growth 
rate of MFI credit to euro area residents declined 
further in 2009, reaching 2.4% in December, 
down from 6.9% in December 2008 (see Chart 8). 
This mainly reß ected a signi
Þ cant decline in the 
annual growth rate of credit to the private sector, 
while the annual growth rate of credit to general 
government increased substantially. The increase in the annual growth rate of credit to general government was mainly a result 
of sizeable increases in MFIs™ holdings of 
government securities in the course of the year. 
Given the prevailing interest rate constellation, 
government securities were seen as an attractive, 
liquid investment opportunity in the context of 
subdued loan demand on the part of the private 
sector and a perception among banks that 
borrowers™ default risk had increased. In addition,

2009those securities represented a safe investment opportunity that could easily be used as collateral 

in the Eurosystem™s liquidity operations. 
At the same time, the issuance of government 
securities increased signiÞ cantly in 2009. 
By contrast, the annual growth rate of credit to 
the private sector declined markedly over the 
course of the year, standing at a modest 0.7% in 
December. This reß ected the declines recorded 
in the annual growth rates of both private sector 
debt securities and loans to the private sector. 
The annual growth rate of MFIs™ holdings 
of private sector securities other than shares 
declined as the effect of the large-scale retained 
securitisation activities conducted in late 2008 
and early 2009 dissipated.2 This practice acquired particular signiÞ cance in the fourth 
quarter of 2008, when the ECB moved to Þ xed rate operations with full allotment for the 
provision of central bank liquidity. In 2009, as a result of that new stock of securities and 
the signiÞ cant accumulation of government 
securities in the course of the year, euro area 
MFIs did not feel the need to create additional 
collateral, and so those retained securitisation 
activities steadily became less frequent. The annual growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector, the largest component of credit 
to the private sector, declined further in the 
course of 2009, turning slightly negative 
in the fourth quarter of the year. Its short-
term dynamics reveal that the steady decline 
observed in this annual growth rate in 2009 
was a result of the strong fall seen in the fourth 
quarter of 2008 and the subdued ß ows recorded throughout the year. Indeed, the three-month 
annualised growth rate hovered around -0.5% 
throughout 2009 (see Chart 4). This picture 
does not change when the downward impact 
of the derecognition of loans in the context 
of securitisation activities is taken into account, 
although adjusting for this effect prevents 
both the annual rate and the short-term rate 
from dropping below zero. Nonetheless, 
while signiÞ cant at the beginning of 2009, 
the difference between the adjusted and 
unadjusted growth rates declined steadily 
in the course of the year, reß ecting the decline 
observed in securitisation activity. The overall deceleration in lending to the private sector was broadly based across the 
various borrowing sectors, although it also 
concealed some heterogeneity in those sectoral 
developments. After declining markedly in the 
fourth quarter of 2008, the annual growth rate of 
loans to households declined at a more moderate 
pace in the Þ rst quarter of 2009 and remained 
broadly stable at around zero thereafter, with 
a slight increase towards the end of the year. 
This improvement was mainly a consequence 
of developments in loans for house purchase. 
By contrast, the annual growth rate of loans to 
non-Þ nancial corporations declined strongly 
throughout the year, falling from 9.5% in ﬁRetained securitisationﬂ refers to the practice whereby at 2 least some of the securities created in the traditional true-sale securitisation process are bought back by the originating MFI.Chart 8 Counterparts of M3(annual ß ows; EUR billions; adjusted for seasonal and calendar

2009December 2008 to -2.2% in December 2009. This decline was observed for all maturities, 
but was more visible for shorter maturities, 
with only the ß ows of long-term loans (i.e. those 
with maturities of over Þ ve years) remaining 
positive throughout the year. The contraction 
recorded in the amount of outstanding 
short-term loans may reß ect the substantially 
reduced trade volumes and inventory levels 
in 2009. In addition, non-Þ nancial corporations 
may, in part, have moved over to Þ xed rate, 
long-term bank loans in an attempt to lock in the 
prevailing low level of interest rates. At the same 
time, in the presence of heightened uncertainty, 
Þ rms with access to market-based 
Þ nance may 
have wanted to reduce their dependence on 
banks by increasing their recourse to market 
Þ nancing given the reduced spreads between 
the rates on securities issued by non-Þ nancial corporations and those on MFI loans. These developments in loans to households and non-Þ nancial corporations appear consistent 
with historical regularities. Changes in the 
growth rate of loans to households tend to 
coincide with Œ or lead slightly Œ turning-points 
in real GDP growth, while loans to non-Þ nancial corporations tend to lag developments in GDP 
by a few quarters. These regularities reß ect various factors. On the one hand, both interest 
rates and house prices tend to decline during 
economic slowdowns, which prompts renewed 
demand for loans for house purchase on the part 
of some households. On the other hand, Þ rms typically make use of internal funds as cash 
ß ows improve during a recovery, only later 
turning to external Þ nancing, which may explain 
the fact that loans to non-Þ nancial corporations 
tend to lag GDP. At the same time, some supply 
factors may also be relevant. For instance, in the 
early stages of a recovery, banks prefer to 
increase lending to households rather than Þ rms, as loans to households (especially loans for 
house purchase) are better collateralised.3 The bank lending survey for the euro area 
indicates that credit standards were tightened 
throughout 2009, although that tightening 
weakened as time went by. To some extent, that 
tightening reß ected balance sheet constraints, 
limited access to external funding and liquidity 
restraints, but it mainly stemmed from variations 
in borrowers™ creditworthiness, which tends to 
worsen in economic downturns and improve in 
recoveries. The annual growth rate of MFI loans to OFIs continued to decline, reaching 4.3% in 
December 2009, down from 10.1% in 
December 2008. This strong deceleration was 
probably related to the fact that investors™ 
preferences shifted strongly towards more 
traditional Þ nancial products, leading to 
the general scaling-down of OFI activities. 
The almost total closure of the market for 
securitisation was an important development in 
this respect. Of the other counterparts of M3, the annual growth rate of MFI longer-term Þ nancial liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) 
held by the money-holding sector increased 
substantially in the course of the year and stood 
at 5.8% in December, up from 0.6% at the end 
of 2008. It thereby ended the downward trend 
observed as of the second quarter of 2007. 
This increase mainly reß ected stronger growth 
not only in longer-term deposits (i.e. deposits 
redeemable at notice of over three months and 
those with an agreed maturity of over two years), 
but also in longer-term debt securities (i.e. those 
with a maturity of over two years). Overall, 
the increase observed in longer-term Þ nancial liabilities in 2009 reß ects a shift towards 
longer maturities in the light of the steepness 
of the yield curve. Government guarantees and 
improvements in market conÞ dence are also 
likely to have contributed to this increase in the 
accumulation of longer-term MFI debt securities 

by the money-holding sectors. Finally, turning to the external position of euro area MFIs, both external assets and external 
liabilities were reduced in 2009 Œ the Þ rst reduction in the absolute size of euro area MFIs™ See the box entitled ﬁLoans to the non-Þ nancial private sector 
3 over the business cycle in the euro areaﬂ in the October 2009 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.36ECBAnnual Report
2009external position since 1999. This resulted, however, in an increase of •135 billion in euro 
area MFIs™ net external position, as the reduction 
in external liabilities exceeded the reduction in 
external assets. This reduction of both assets 
and liabilities stems from the scaling-back of interbank cross-border positions in the context 
of a broader deleveraging process on the MFI 
balance sheet. For a detailed discussion of 
developments in the MFI balance sheet in the 
course of 2009 and their implications for loans 
to the private sector, see Box 3. Box 3 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN BANKS’ BALANCE SHEETS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR PRIVATE 

SECTOR LOANSAs a result of the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial turmoil in the last few months of 2008, 
MFIs around the world have faced mounting pressure to reduce the size of their balance sheets. 
Euro area MFIs have not escaped these pressures and reduced their main assets1 by •329 billion (representing a decline of 1.1%) in the course of 2009. This was the Þ rst reduction since 1999 
and unwound some of the strong leveraging observed between 2004 and mid-2008. Against this 
background, this box looks at the way in which loans to the private sector Œ the main source of 
Þ nancing for 
Þ rms and households Œ were affected by this deleveraging in 2009.
Considerations relating to the adjustment of banks™ balance sheetsThe pressure on capital ratios and funding positions associated with the Þ nancial turmoil meant that banks faced a complex combination of considerations in 2009 as regards the adjustment of their balance sheets. On the funding side, banks were negatively affected by investors™ rising 
apprehension and the resulting increases in the cost of Þ nancing, which further exacerbated the strain placed on banks™ capital positions by declines in asset prices and credit losses. In such 
a situation, a bank will need to reduce its leverage ratio, either by raising additional equity 
or by reducing its assets. In times of Þ nancial turmoil, that deleveraging will largely take the 
form of reductions in assets, given that otherwise huge amounts of equity would be required in 
a short space of time in the presence of increased risk aversion, which would increase the cost 
of equity even more. The shedding of assets will typically be implemented by means of the 
disposal of non-core assets in order to acquire liquidity and the reduction of exposure to risky 
assets. There is a natural pecking order as regards the various liquidity sources. Usually, a bank 
will Þ rst liquidate its short-term assets, then its external assets, and 
Þ nally its long-term assets.
2 Thus, loans to Þ rms and households, as longer-term assets, will be at the end of that list. 
In general, these assets can only be reduced by means of the restriction of new lending and the 
repayment of existing loans. Moreover, business models based on sustained customer relations, 
which are common in the euro area banking system, provide further incentives to refrain from 
shedding loans. In practice, given the complexity of these considerations, that pecking order is likely 
to function with a certain degree of heterogeneity across the MFI sector. Structural considerations 1 Main assets comprise all balance sheet asset items with the exception of 
Þ xed assets, ﬁremaining assetsﬂ and money market fund 
shares/units.2 For details of the pecking order for the liquidation of assets, see F. Allen and D. Gale, ﬁFinancial contagionﬂ, 
Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 108, No 1, 2000, pp. 1-33. 37ECBAnnual Report
2009(such as a renewed focus on core business or a retreat from international Þ nance) may 
reinforce that pecking order in the downsizing 
of the balance sheet, while temporary Þ nancing conditions (such as the possibility of obtaining 
central bank liquidity) may place a premium on 
increasing securities holdings once the initial 
phase of the deleveraging process is over. Most of the adjustment was implemented 
via the reduction of interbank creditThe decline observed in the aggregated MFI balance sheet in 2009 did not affect all asset 
classes in the same way. The •329 billion 
decline in MFIs™ main assets was accounted 
for by major reductions (of •440 billion and 
•366 billion respectively) in external assets 
and loans to euro area MFIs, while credit 
granted to euro area residents (covering both 
the private sector and general government) 
increased by •379 billion (see Chart A). 
A large part of the decline observed in external assets was accounted for by the reduction of holdings vis-à-vis foreign banks and reß ects, in particular, the scaling-back of the strong capital ß ows to 
Þ nancial centres prior to the 
Þ nancial turmoil.3 Overall, therefore, interbank activity bore the brunt of the balance sheet adjustment. Around one-third of the decline observed in loan positions vis-à-vis euro area MFIs was the 
result of reductions in MFIs™ claims on the Eurosystem, which can be attributed to the unwinding 
of the considerable increases seen in those claims in September and October 2008 as a result of 
the ECB™s enhanced credit support measures. Another third was offset by an increase in holdings 
of securities issued by euro area MFIs.Credit to the private sector was affected lessLooking at credit granted to euro area residents, most of the increase observed in 2009 was related to the sizeable increase (totalling •251 billion) recorded in holdings of general government 
securities. The accumulation of government securities was fostered by the interest rate 
constellation observed during the year, which provided good opportunities for proÞ t. Investing in government securities also offered additional advantages. First, those securities allowed 
banks to temporarily invest their available funds in liquid, relatively well-remunerated assets 
in the presence of both limited demand for loans and a perception among banks that borrowers™ 
default risk had increased. Second, they acted as a safe and convenient investment alternative 
with a low capital requirement in a situation in which banks were seeking to reduce the average 
level of risk in their portfolios. Credit to the non-Þ nancial private sector, which comprises 
credit to households and companies in the form of loans and securities (excluding shares), and 3 See the box entitled ﬁThe role of MFI external assets and liabilities in the recent deleveraging processﬂ in the November 2009 issue

2009which represents the largest item on the MFI balance sheet, declined by •72 billion 
in 2009 (see Chart B). This decline was 

relatively small by comparison with the overall reduction in euro area MFIs™ balance 
sheets, and as a result credit to the non-
Þ nancial private sector actually increased 
slightly as a percentage of MFIs™ main 
assets. However, that decrease in credit to the 
non-Þ nancial private sector, the result of a 
decline in loans, was more than compensated 
for by an increase (of •122 billion) in the 
holdings of securities issued by non-monetary 
Þ nancial intermediaries other than insurance 
corporations and pension funds. A large part 
of MFIs™ increased holdings of these securities 
reß ected the retained securitisation activity 
that took place during the Þ rst half of the 
year, whereby securities created out of loans 
removed from MFIs™ balance sheets were 
bought back by the MFIs in question, often in 
order to use them as collateral in Eurosystem liquidity operations. Accordingly, the reduction 
observed in credit to the non-Þ nancial private sector does not re
ß ect an actual contraction, but 
rather the reallocation of items within the balance sheet. Looking at the breakdown by instrument, a clear and distinctive feature of the balance sheet adjustment process undergone in 2009 was the efforts made by banks to improve their 
liquidity by increasing their debt securities positions. The acquisition of government securities, 
the replacement of inter-MFI loans with MFI securities and the securitisation of parts of their 
loan portfolios (balance sheet adjustments with a total value of •387 billion) enabled banks to 
obtain liquidity from the Eurosystem.Overall, the scaling-down of euro area MFIs™ balance sheets focused on inter-MFI positions (with positions being reduced vis-à-vis both domestic and foreign MFIs). This appears primarily 
to have reß ected the unwinding of pre-turmoil asset accumulation. In the same way that increases 
in such positions may have facilitated the strong supply of credit to the rest of the economy, the 
shrinking of inter-MFI positions could have had a negative impact on bank lending to the private 
sector. All in all, the limited changes observed in 2009 for credit to Þ rms and households in 
the context of the signiÞ cant downsizing of euro area MFIs™ balance sheets suggest that banks 
focused on lending as their core activity.MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS IMPROVED 
Tensions in the euro area money market 
continued to ease in the course of 2009 
as conditions normalised following the 
intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial crisis in 
September 2008. This was reß ected in signi

in October 2008, albeit remaining elevated by

2009This improvement in the euro area money market 
was mainly a result of the extraordinary liquidity 

support that the ECB provided to euro area banks, 

the sizeable reduction in the key ECB interest 

rates following the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial 
crisis in autumn 2008 and the interventions by 

euro area governments to support troubled 

Þ nancial institutions. The Eurosystem continued 
to provide the Þ nancial system with abundant 
amounts of liquidity throughout 2009, 

conducting all of its reÞ nancing operations 
by means of Þ xed rate tender procedures with 
full allotment. Notably, the three LTROs 

with a maturity of one year Œ conducted 

in June, September and December 2009 Œ acted 

as a catalyst in improving banks™ liquidity 

positions on a longer-term basis, thereby further 

promoting the reduction of term spreads in 

the money market while helping to support 

banks™ provision of credit to the real economy.Secured and unsecured money market interest rates declined across the entire maturity 
spectrum in 2009. The pace of that decline 
became progressively slower, with interest rates 
approaching record lows towards the end of the 
year. Increases were only observed between 
the end of May and the Þ rst one-year LTRO, 
which was conducted with a Þ xed rate and full 
allotment on 24 June. During that period, excess 
liquidity Œ measured as the difference between 
total outstanding liquidity and the actual liquidity 
needs of the system Œ declined signiÞ cantly ahead 
of the one-year operation, with banks preferring 
to switch their ECB funding to the longer maturity 
of one year and thereby freeing up the collateral 
used in maturing shorter-term operations. 
This resulted in temporary increases in money 
market rates, with more pronounced increases 
for rates on overnight index swaps (OISs) and, 
to a lesser extent, short-term unsecured rates. 
Notably, the EONIA increased by around 
25 basis points between 7 May (when the series 
of LTROs with a maturity of one year was 
announced) and 24 June (when the Eurosystem 
conducted the Þ rst of these operations). 
The one-month EURIBOR also increased, 
albeit with a lag and to a lesser extent, rising 
by around 11 basis points between 19 May and 23 June. Following the allotment of a sizeable 
•442.2 billion in the Þ rst one-year LTRO 
on 24 June, excess liquidity increased again, 
reaching new record highs. As a result, money 
market rates declined again almost immediately 
in both secured and unsecured markets. They 
passed their levels of early May and soon 
reached Œ and subsequently maintained Œ 
historically low levels.More speciÞ cally, looking at three-month 
unsecured rates, the three-month EURIBOR stood close to 2.8% at the beginning of 
January 2009, already much lower than its 
peak of 5.4% in October 2008. It then declined 
further to stand just below 0.7% at the end of 
February 2010. The slope of the money market 
yield curve Œ as measured by the spread between 
the twelve-month and one-month EURIBOR Œ 
steepened in the course of 2009, albeit with some 
volatility during this period. That spread rose 
from a low of 41 basis points at the beginning 
of 2009 to peak at 83 basis points in July, 
August and October, before easing marginally 
to stand at around 80 basis points at the end of 
February 2010 (see Chart 9). As regards the secured segment of the money market, the three-month EUREPO stood at Chart 9 Unsecured money market interest rates(percentages per annum; spread in percentage points; daily data)0.00.51.0

2009around 1.8% at the beginning of January 2009, also much lower than its peak of 4.4% in late 
September 2008. It then declined further to stand 
just below 0.4% at the end of February 2010. As a result of these developments, the spread between secured and unsecured money market 
rates gradually declined in the course of the 
year, albeit with some volatility. It reached 
fairly low levels by comparison with the spreads 
observed in the second half of 2007 in the initial 
phases of the Þ nancial turmoil, but remained 
elevated by historical standards. The spread 
between the three-month EURIBOR and the 
three-month EUREPO declined from a peak of 
109 basis points at the beginning of January to 
stand at 31 basis points at the end of the year 
and 29 basis points at the end of February 2010 
(see Chart 10). Looking at very short-term money market rates, the behaviour of the EONIA largely 
reß ects the generous liquidity support that the 
Eurosystem has provided to euro area banks 
since October 2008. In the Þ rst half of 2009, 
up until the Þ rst one-year LTRO at the end of 
June, the behaviour of the EONIA displayed 
three main characteristics. First, it declined signiÞ cantly following further reductions 
in the key ECB interest rates in that period. 
Second, with rare exceptions it remained well 
below the Þ xed rate in the Eurosystem™s main 
reÞ nancing operations and LTROs as a result of 
the excess liquidity in the system, with liquidity 
being provided by means of Þ xed rate tender 
procedures with full allotment in the main 
reÞ nancing operations and the one, three and 
six-month LTROs. Third, the EONIA remained 
highly volatile as a result of constant ß uctuations in the amount of excess liquidity available in the 
system. By contrast, following the allotment of 
•442.2 billion in the one-year LTRO on 24 June, 
which ensured that excess liquidity would be 
abundant for a long time to come, the EONIA 
stabilised at an average of around 10 basis 
points above the rate on the deposit facility. 
It then remained at those levels until the end of 
February 2010. The only exceptions were minor 
spikes on the last day of each maintenance 
period, when liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning operations were conducted. The subsequent 
one-year LTROs in September and December, 
which saw the allotment of •75.2 billion and 
•96.9 billion respectively, also contributed 
to keeping the EONIA relatively stable until 
February 2010 (see Chart 11). Chart 11 ECB interest rates and the overnight

2009GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS IN THE EURO AREA 
REMAINED AT LOW LEVELSAfter moderate intra-year movements, euro area 

long-term government bond yields ended 2009 
close to their end-2008 levels. This was in 
stark contrast to the United States, where 
yields increased signiÞ cantly. At the beginning 
of 2009 ten-year sovereign bond yields on both 
sides of the Atlantic were at low levels compared 
with historical averages, following large cuts 
in monetary policy rates, downward revisions 
of inß ation risks and a strong 
ß ight to quality 
from risky assets into government securities. US 
long-term yields had experienced a particularly 
large decline towards the end of 2008, so that 
they started 2009 from a level that was the 
lowest in the last four decades. With hindsight, 
the decrease in US yields in the fourth quarter 
of 2008 may be considered as having priced 
in excessive deß ationary concerns. Indeed, US 
bond yields registered a strong rebound during 
the Þ rst half of 2009. Euro area bond yields, 
which had not experienced such a strong decline 
previously, showed a much less distinct increase 
over this period (see Chart 12). Following mild 
decreases from their mid-June peaks, euro 
area and US ten-year government bond yields 
were recorded at 3.6% and 3.9% respectively 
by the end of 2009. The strong overall increase in US yields reversed the gap between euro area and US yields seen 
at the end of 2008, so that US ten-year yields 
eventually exceeded their euro area counterparts 
in late 2009. Euro area sovereign bond spreads 
decreased substantially overall from March, after 
they had reached new peaks at the beginning of 
the year. However, amid resurfacing concerns 
regarding Þ scal solvency, sovereign bond 
spreads ended the year well above pre-crisis 
levels. Overall, the developments in long-term government bond yields can be interpreted as the 
net result of two sets of driving forces. On the one 
hand, a somewhat brightening macroeconomic outlook, as well as the huge volume of new 
sovereign debt supply, were major factors 
exerting upward pressure on government bond 
yields. Debt supply expectations were in turn 
driven by the governments™ requirements to 
Þ nance their large-scale rescue packages for 
Þ nancial institutions and stimulus programmes, 
as well as by expectations of recession-induced 
lower tax revenues and higher unemployment 
beneÞ t payments. On the other hand, these 
factors were met by relatively strong demand for 
government debt from private sector investors. 
Furthermore, in the euro area, key ECB 
interest rates were lowered markedly between 
January and May. Finally, in the 
United States, 
the Federal Reserve™s large-scale 
purchase programme for long-term US government 
debt contributed temporarily to restraining the increase in long-term bond yields. Chart 12 Long-term government bond yields(percentages per annum; daily data)2.02.53.03.5

Sources: Bloomberg, EuroMTS, Reuters and ECB.Notes: Before January 2007, long-term government bond yields 
for the euro area refer to ten-year bonds or to the closest available 
bond maturity. Starting from January 2007, the euro area
ten-year bond yield is represented by the ten-year par yield 
derived from the euro area sovereign AAA yield curve estimated 
by the ECB. For the United States, bond yields for the ten-year 
maturity are reported.42ECBAnnual Report

2009In early 2009 major government bond markets, like other Þ nancial market segments, were still 
largely inß uenced by investors™ concerns 
and uncertainty regarding the fragility of the 
Þ nancial sector and the length and depth of the 
global recession. Monetary policy rates on both 
sides of the Atlantic were expected to remain 
at low levels for an extended period of time, as 
indicated by future and forward rates. However, 
the decline in government bond yields that had 
been observed in the second half of 2008 came 
to a halt at the beginning of 2009. At that time, 
bond market investors apparently reduced or 
reversed previous ß ight-to-quality movements 
and may have also been less concerned about the 
existence of deß ationary pressures. In addition, 
investors increasingly realised that future 
government Þ nancing needs would be large. 
Indeed, the need for possibly sizeable future 
government outlays was highlighted by bank 
support measures on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States, when ten-year yields reached their peak of 4% in mid-2009, they 
had risen by about 175 basis points from their 
level in December 2008. This run-up in yields 
was interrupted by a historically large one-day 
drop (of 48 basis points) in US long-term bond 
yields, which happened on 18 March after 
the announcement of the Federal Reserve™s 
large-scale purchase programme for Treasury 
securities. However, US long-term yields 
shortly afterwards resumed their increases. 
The effects of the purchase programme and other 
quantitative easing measures were more than 
offset by the impact from investors expecting 
large volumes of future US government 
debt supply and their reversal of previous 
ß ight-to-safety ß ows. Remarkably, the strong 
increase in US long-term government bond 
yields offset the large decline seen at the end of 
the previous year. Euro area bond yields, in contrast, showed a more subdued increase in the Þ rst half of the year, 
rising by around 35 basis points by mid-June. 
While reversals of ß ight-to-quality ß ows were 
a likely factor driving bond yields also in the 
euro area, the upward pressure from sovereign risk on bond yields appeared to ease somewhat 
from March. Indeed, after sovereign bond 
spreads (vis-à-vis German government bonds) 
and respective credit default swap premia had 
climbed up to peak levels in February and early 
March, they exhibited a remarkable downward 
correction thereafter, bottoming out in August. In the second half of the year long-term government bond yields on both sides of the 
Atlantic were on a slowly declining trend. 
However, over the course of December US 
long-term bond yields recorded a remarkable 
60 basis point increase, possibly inß uenced by the completion of the Federal Reserve™s 
purchase programme. In the euro area, high 
issuance was met by strong demand for safe 
assets, reß ecting recurrent concerns among 
market participants over the fragility of the 
ongoing economic recovery. The apprehension 
related to future Þ nancing needs of sovereign 
issuers resurfaced prominently following the 
Greek government™s revision of its public 
deÞ cit in early October and the subsequent 
downgrading of Greek government debt by three 
major rating agencies. This brought Greek bond 
spreads near to their early-year peaks, while 
most other euro area sovereign spreads were 
much less affected (see Box 7). For AAA-rated 
government debt, euro area ten-year yields 
ended the year at around 3.6%, a low level by 
historical standards. At the same time, levels of 
short-term rates were markedly lower, so the 
euro area yield curve ended the year with an 
exceptionally steep slope. Unlike long-term nominal interest rates, 
real government bond yields in the euro area 

showed a distinct trend decline over the year, 

decreasing by 100 and 45 basis points at the Þ ve 
and ten-year maturity respectively. Accordingly, 

the Þ ve-year forward in
ß ation-linked bond 
yield Þ ve years ahead remained broadly 
unchanged overall. A common interpretation 

would be that these patterns reß ected an 
increasingly depressed short-term and a somewhat 

bleak longer-term macroeconomic outlook as 

perceived by euro area bond market investors. 

However, the developments in inß ation-linked 
43ECBAnnual Report
2009bond markets during 2009 have to be interpreted 
carefully. Caution is warranted as inß ation-linked 
bond markets had been subject to severe 

dislocations around the end of 2008, signalling 

abnormally high real yields in an environment 

of economic distress. Over 2009 liquidity 

conditions across the maturity spectrum 

improved somewhat. In addition, demand-supply 

imbalances (especially for longer maturities) 

shrank. While there was virtually no supply of 

long-term inß ation-linked debt in the 
Þ rst half 
of 2009, it eventually resumed and is expected 

to pick up further in 2010. Although market 

conditions underwent some normalisation, 

they still have not fully returned to smooth 

functioning. 
This notion of caution also applies to the 
interpretation of developments in break-even 

inß ation rates (i.e. the difference between 
nominal and real bond yields of the same 

maturity). Under normal market conditions, 

these largely represent investors™ inß ation 
expectations and associated inß ation risk premia. 
However, the above-described adjustment 

processes in inß ation-linked bond markets 
impede this interpretation and point to the 

importance of taking into account technical 

market factors when interpreting movements 

in break-even inß ation rates. As a consequence 
of the developments in nominal and real bond 

yields, Þ ve-year and ten-year spot break-even 
inß ation rates increased by 90 and 80 basis 
points respectively in 2009, to stand at 

around 2.0% and 2.4% at the end of the year 

(see Chart 13). Accordingly, the Þ ve-year 
forward break-even inß ation rate 
Þ ve years ahead 
increased by 70 basis points, ending the year at 

2.8%. Given the still high volatility of spot and 

forward break-even inß ation rates, these 
Þ gures 
are not inconsistent with Þ rmly anchored medium 
to long-term inß ation expectations. Indeed, the 
corresponding forward rates derived from swap 

instruments, which were markedly less volatile, 

recorded an increase of 15 basis points only. 

Moreover, survey-based inß ation expectations for 
medium to long-term horizons (from Consensus 

Economics) also remained remarkably stable at 

1.9% over 2009. 
Uncertainty regarding future bond price 
developments, as reß ected in option-implied 
volatilities, declined signiÞ cantly in the course 
of the year. Compared with the exceptionally 
high levels at the end of 2008, bond market 
volatility approximately halved on both sides 
of the Atlantic. However, reß ecting uncertainty 
about the extent of future government Þ nancing needs and the strength of the macroeconomic 
recovery, end-year volatility levels were still 
above those prevailing before the onset of the 
Þ nancial turmoil in 2007. 
In the Þ rst two months of 2010 euro area 
and US long-term government bond yields 
decreased by about 25 basis points, to stand 
at around 3.4% and 3.6% respectively on 
26 February. While yields on the highest-rated 
sovereign debt in the euro area declined 
moderately, intensifying market concerns about 
the sustainability of Þ scal positions of some 
countries led to marked increases in long-term 
bond yields of these sovereign issuers. As a 
result, sovereign bond spreads for some euro area 
countries widened further. The most remarkable 
spread widening between end-December 2009 Chart 13 Euro area zero coupon break-even

2009and end-February 2010 was recorded by Greek long-term government bonds, where the spread 
against German government bond yields 
increased by almost 100 basis points. Over the 
same period, euro area Þ ve-year and ten-year 
spot break-even inß ation rates decreased by 
around 35 basis points, to stand at around 
1.6% and 2.0% respectively at the end of 
February 2010. Accordingly, the Þ ve-year forward break-even inß ation rate 
Þ ve years 
ahead decreased by 30 basis points to stand at 
2.5% at the end of February 2010.EURO AREA STOCK PRICES INCREASED STRONGLY 
After a continuation of previous declines in 

the Þ rst two months of 2009, the year was 
characterised by an impressive rebound of 

equity prices globally. This was spurred by 

returning conÞ dence and decreasing risk 
aversion of investors, for which the large-scale
support measures of governments and 

central banks were an important driving 

factor. Compared with end-2008 levels, 

major stock market indices in the euro area, 

the United States and Japan increased 

by around 23%, 23% and 19% respectively. 

Share price increases in the euro area were 

particularly strong for the Þ nancial sector, 
recovering from severely depressed levels. 

The surge in stock markets was driven by an 

improved corporate earnings outlook, supportive 

low real interest rates and a sizeable decline in the 

equity premium (i.e. equity investors™ required 

risk compensation). Stock market volatility 

roughly halved compared with the end of 2008. 
During the Þ rst two months of 2009 stock 
markets in major economies continued their downturn of the previous year (see Chart 14). 
Investors™ risk aversion remained elevated 
and stock market volatility stood at somewhat 
higher levels compared with the end of 2008 
(see Chart 15). The mood in stock markets Þ nally improved in early March, driven by positive 
economic news and increasing conÞ dence in government and central bank measures. 
Sound performance data from US banks were 
among the Þ rst important news that gave impetus

2009to stock markets. Several measures to tackle the economic and Þ nancial crisis, as discussed at 
the European Council meeting in Brussels in 
March and the G20 meeting in London in April, 
were well received by market participants and 
spurred investor conÞ dence further.
In the euro area, positive news regarding 
consumer and business expectations 
(e.g. an improvement of business and consumer 
conÞ dence in the European Commission™s 
survey) further supported stock prices in the 
Þ rst half of 2009. However, uncertainty about 
the true state of the Þ nancial system was a major 
factor tending to contain euphoria in stock markets. 

Therefore, central bank measures expected to 

be supportive of the banking sector were well 

received by stock market participants.The increase in stock prices continued in the 
third quarter of 2009 on the basis of overall 

positive economic news and decreasing risk 

aversion, but lost some of its pace in the Þ nal 
quarter. In late November stock markets were 

negatively hit by the announcement that a 

Dubai government holding company had asked 

creditors for a six-month standstill on its debt. 

Most probably the impact on stock markets, 

which was short-lived, reß ected lingering market 
concerns about public and private balance sheet 

fragilities. Looking back at the strong stock price
rebound in 2009, it should be recalled that it 

started from depressed levels. By the end of the 

year euro area and US stock prices were still 37% 

and 26% lower respectively, compared with their 

end-June 2007 levels. Stock market volatility 

also normalised considerably over the year, but 

was still somewhat above pre-crisis levels.The increase in stock prices was to some extent supported by short-term earnings 
growth expectations. For corporations listed 
in the Dow Jones EURO STOXX index, the 
forecast annual growth rate of earnings per 
share 12 months ahead reached a historical low of nearly -4% in spring, but then increased 
sharply to stand at 30% in December. However, 
even this positive earnings outlook represents 
only a partial rebound from the slump in actual 
earnings, which decreased by around 35% 
between December 2008 and December 2009.From a sectoral perspective, in the euro area, Þ nancial stock prices increased by 31%, 
while non-Þ nancial corporate stock prices only 
increased by 19%. Looking at the period since 
March in the United States, Þ nancial shares also 
outperformed non-Þ nancial shares, but over the 
year as a whole stock prices of non-Þ nancial corporations rose by more than those of Þ nancial institutions (27% as against 14%).In early 2010 stock prices continued their upwardtrend until around mid-January. Subsequently, 
broad equity price indices on both sides 
of the Atlantic showed some declines and 
implied volatility temporarily edged upwards. 
One possible driving factor may have been 
market concerns regarding public Þ nances and 
a resulting decline in investors™ risk appetite. 
Overall, in the Þ rst two months of 2010, stock 
prices decreased by about 7% and 1% in the 
euro area and the United States respectively. HOUSEHOLD BORROWING WAS SUBDUEDHousehold borrowing remained subdued 

throughout 2009, reß ecting a high degree of 
uncertainty regarding income and housing market 

prospects, especially in the Þ rst half of the year. 
At the same time, banks continued to tighten 

their credit standards, although that tightening 

weakened in the course of the year. Expectations 

regarding general economic activity and housing 

market prospects were the main factors behind 

the tightening of credit standards. Banks reported 

increases in net demand for loans for house 

purchase, which turned positive in the second 

quarter of the year, while net demand for other 

types of lending approached positive territory 

towards the end of the year.46ECBAnnual Report

2009The annual growth rate of MFI loans to households, which are the main source of 
household borrowing, declined to 1.3% at 
the end of 2009, down from 1.7% at the 
end of 2008. This decline was smaller than 
that observed in 2008, as household lending 
recovered slightly towards the end of the year 
following the negative growth rates observed 
around the middle of 2009. The annual growth 
rate of loans granted to households by non-MFIs
(i.e. OFIs, insurance corporations and pension 
funds) continued to exceed that of MFI loans 
to households. This partly reß ects the impact of true-sale securitisation activities, whereby loans 
are derecognised (i.e. removed from MFI balance 
sheets) and subsequently recorded as loans from 
OFIs. While the level of securitisation activity 
recorded in 2009 was substantially lower than 
that observed in 2008, it remained sizeable in 
the Þ rst half of the year.
A breakdown of MFI loans to households by 
purpose indicates that borrowing for house 
purchase continued to be the main driver of 
overall lending to this sector in 2009. The annual 
growth rate of loans to households for house purchase stood at 1.5% in December 2009, 
unchanged from December 2008 (see Chart 16), 
masking a strong decline in the Þ rst half 
of 2009 and a moderate Œ albeit consistent Œ 
improvement in the second half of the year. 
These developments should be seen in the 
context of declines in house prices and housing 
market activity in a number of euro area 
economies. At the same time, the positive ß ows observed in the second half of the year could have 
reß ected an increase in demand following those reductions in house prices. The levelling-off 
observed in the annual growth rate of loans 
for house purchase also reß ected the lower 
mortgage rates resulting from the pass-through 
of the series of reductions in key ECB interest 
rates between October 2008 and May 2009. 
MFI lending rates for house purchase decreased 
by 151 basis points between December 2008 
and December 2009 (see Chart 17). This 
decline was particularly visible for loans 
with initial rate Þ xation periods of up to one 
year, the rates on which fell by 238 basis 
points, while the rates on loans with initial 
rate Þ xation periods of over ten years declined 
by 87 basis points.Chart 17 Interest rates on lending

2009The annual growth rate of consumer credit stood at 0.0% in December 2009, down from 1.7% at 
the end of 2008. Developments in consumer 
credit were similar to those observed for 
loans for house purchase, although the annual 
growth rate of consumer credit fell deeper into 
negative territory in the middle part of the year. 
These developments can be explained by the low 
levels of consumer con
Þ dence during the year. 
In 2009 MFI interest rates on consumer credit 
declined by an average of 116 basis points. HOUSEHOLDS’ INTEREST BURDEN DECREASEDAs the amount of outstanding household debt 
increased moderately further and households™ 
disposable income did not react immediately 
to changes in economic growth, the ratio of 
household debt to disposable income was 
fairly stable in 2009. It was estimated at 
around 95% in the fourth quarter of 2009, 
marginally higher than the level observed 
in 2008 (see Chart 18). By contrast, according 
to data from the integrated euro area accounts, the ratio of household debt to GDP increased 
by more than 2 percentage points during the 
year to stand close to 65% in the fourth quarter 
of 2009. The decline observed in bank lending 
rates considerably eased households™ interest 
payment burden (measured as interest payments 
as a percentage of disposable income), which 
stood at 3.0% in the fourth quarter of 2009, 
down from the peak of 3.9% recorded in the 
third quarter of 2008. It is also worth mentioning 
that there is a high degree of heterogeneity 
in the indebtedness of euro area households. 
In particular, in some parts of the euro area 
high levels of indebtedness are coinciding with 
weak economic activity or remaining signs of 
overvaluation in housing markets. In addition, 
there are also cross-country differences in 
terms of the predominant loan Þ xation period. 
In this respect, a higher interest rate risk applies 
to those countries where Þ nancing has shifted 
more quickly to short-term loans in response to 
reductions in interest rates.THE COST OF EXTERNAL FINANCING DECREASED 

CONSIDERABLYDespite a signiÞ cant decrease in the cost of 
external Þ nancing throughout 2009, euro area 
non-Þ nancial corporations™ external 
Þ nancing shrank substantially, largely driven by more 
subdued demand for loans amid a bleak 
economic environment. However, the leverage 
of the euro area non-Þ nancial corporate sector 
increased further, driven by a particularly sharp 
deterioration in corporate proÞ tability.After reaching a historical peak in 
November 2008, the real cost of external 
Þ nancing for euro area non-
Þ nancial corporations 
decreased sharply and continuously throughout 
2009 (see Chart 19), owing to a broadly based 
moderation of costs across all sources of 
funding. By the end of the year, the overall real 
cost of external Þ nancing had reached the lowest 
level recorded since 1999.Regarding the cost of bank-based Þ nancing, the decline of bank interest rates in 2009 mainly reß ected the gradual pass-through to banks™ 
customers of changes in key ECB interest Chart 18 Household debt and interest payments(percentages)4050

2009rates implemented between October 2008 and May 2009. All in all, these developments 
suggest that euro area banks continued to pass 
on the reduction in key policy rates, broadly 
in line with historical patterns (see Box 4). 
Developments in banks™ short-term lending 
rates are primarily inß uenced by movements 
in short-term money market rates, while banks™ 
longer-term lending rates mainly reß ect movements in government bond yields. Between the end of 2008 and the end of 2009, as the three-month EURIBOR dropped by 
nearly 260 basis points, nominal short-term 
bank interest rates on loans to non-Þ nancial corporations declined by 210 basis points. 
Consequently, despite a mild rebound of 
inß ation expectations since May 2009, 
real short-term bank lending rates declined by 158 basis points. Movements in long-term bank 
lending rates were even more pronounced than 
those in corresponding long-term government 
bond yields. Nominal bank interest rates on 
longer-term loans declined by around 
120 basis points in 2009, which was 
considerably more than the 65 basis point 
decrease in the Þ ve-year government bond 
yield. As a result, the spreads between 
long-term bank lending rates and comparable 
market rates tended to narrow substantially 
throughout 2009, reversing the sharp widening 
of spreads registered in the previous year. 
Overall, real long-term bank lending rates 
declined by 130 basis points between the end 
of 2008 and the end of 2009.Similarly, the large decline in the real cost of market-based debt Þ nancing by 
389 basis points over the same period reß ected not only the decrease of yields on government 
bonds, but also the narrowing of corporate 
bond spreads (measured as the difference 
between the yields on corporate bonds and 
the yields on government bonds). These 
spreads started to narrow at the beginning 
of 2009, declining across all rating classes 
and even falling back to levels below those 
recorded in August 2008 (i.e. shortly before the 
broad-based widening of spreads brought about 
by the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial crisis). 
The gradual decrease in risk perceptions and 
some recovery of investors™ risk appetite 
in the course of 2009 led to a particularly 
pronounced decline of spreads for bonds with 
a low credit rating and for speculative-grade 
bonds. For instance, between the end of 2008 and 

the end of 2009, spreads on euro area high-yield 

bonds dropped by as much as 1,500 basis points, 
compared with about 100 basis points for 
AAA-rated bonds.Finally, the real cost of issuing quoted equity also 
decreased markedly throughout 2009, reaching 

its long-term average by the end of the year. 

This was fostered by the strong rebound in equity 

prices brought about by returning conÞ dence 
and decreasing risk aversion of investors.Chart 19 Real cost of the external financing

RATES IN THE EURO AREAThe interest rate channel of monetary policy encapsulates the pass-through of monetary policy 
rates to bank lending rates. This transmission channel should be seen in the euro area as the 
major process through which monetary policy ultimately affects real activity and inß ation, owing to the predominant role of the banking sector in providing Þ nancing to the non-
Þ nancial private sector.1 Reductions in policy rates normally translate into broadly similar movements in market interest rates, in particular at short maturities. Retail bank interest rates are typically 
priced against, and in some cases even linked to, market rates at relevant maturities. The policy 
rate adjustments are therefore expected to be largely reß ected in the bank 
Þ nancing costs facing 
households and companies. Against this background, this box assesses the extent to which euro 
area banks have passed on the consecutive monetary policy rate reductions that began in the 
fourth quarter of 2008, covering the period up until December 2009.2 Between October 2008 and May 2009 the ECB lowered the interest rate on the main 

reÞ nancing operations from 4.25% to a historically low level of 1.00%. In parallel with (and 
possibly driven by) the reductions of key ECB interest rates as well as the extraordinary 

provision of central bank liquidity, both short-term and long-term market rates declined 

substantially in the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout 2009. For example, between end-
September 2008 and December 2009 the three-month EURIBOR decreased by 431 basis 

points to 0.71%, while the seven-year swap rate decreased by 156 basis points to 3.09% (see 

Charts A and B). As illustrated in Charts A and B, it also appears that euro area banks to a 

substantial extent passed on the market rate declines observed over this period. For example, 

with regard to loans at short-term rates (i.e. with a ß oating rate and an initial rate 
Þ xation of 
up to one year), the average bank interest rates on loans to households for house purchase and 

loans to non-Þ nancial corporations declined by around 309 and 336 basis points respectively 
(see Chart A). Similarly, as regards long-term lending rates (i.e. with an initial rate Þ xation of 
over one year), the average bank interest rates on loans to households for house purchase and 

loans to non-Þ nancial corporations decreased by around 111 and 200 basis points respectively 
(see Chart B).3 While it is true that overall MFI lending rates have substantially declined since the key ECB 
interest rates started to be reduced, it is also clear that Œ with the exception of long-term corporate 
lending rates Œ euro area MFIs have only passed on part of that decline so far. However, 
this is not necessarily at odds with historical patterns, which suggest that banks usually only 
gradually pass through changes in policy and market rates to the lending rates charged to 
their customers. In other words, bank lending rates tend to display some degree of stickiness 
in response to a change in monetary policy. These frictions are furthermore often found to be 1 For a more detailed description of the concepts underlying the retail bank interest rate pass-through mechanism, see the article entitled 
ﬁRecent developments in the retail bank interest rate pass-through in the euro areaﬂ in the August 2009 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.2 This box focuses on recent developments in MFI interest rates on loans to households for house purchase and to non-
Þ nancial corporations, which are the most important loan products on the assets side of the MFI balance sheet. Thus, by the third quarter of 2009 
loans to households for house purchase and loans to non-Þ nancial corporations amounted to respectively 16% and 15% of total assets of euro area MFIs (excluding the Eurosystem).3 Notably, in December 2009 various MFI lending rates reached their lowest level since the start of the harmonised MFI interest rate 
statistics in January 2003.50ECBAnnual Report
2009asymmetric in the sense that bank lending rates tend to adjust quicker in response to policy rate increases than to policy rate decreases. The magnitude and speed of bank lending rate 
pass-through are often associated with the degree of imperfect competition in the banking 
sector and the presence of nominal adjustment (ﬁmenuﬂ) costs. These frictions may deter banks 

from reacting on a regular basis to changes in policy and market rates, and banks may instead 

choose to delay the adjustment of their lending rates until the change in market rates exceeds a 

certain threshold.4 Beyond this, other factors related to Þ nancial intermediation may affect the 
developments in the spreads between bank lending rates and market rates, such as costs related to 

interest rate and credit risk, the banks™ degree of risk aversion, unit operating costs, bank liquidity 

and product diversiÞ cation. These additional factors will not be speci
Þ cally considered here.
According to the bank interest rate pass-through literature, the transmission of monetary 
policy rates, via changes in market rates, to bank interest rates can be modelled using 
an error-correction modelling framework where changes in a speciÞ c bank interest rate are 
regressed on simultaneous (and lagged) changes of a relevant market rate and (possibly) lagged 
changes of the bank interest rate itself, as well as an error-correction term reß ecting the extent to 
which in the previous period the bank rate was diverging from its long-run equilibrium relationship 
with the market rate. Using such a standard error-correction model of the pass-through of 
changes in market rates to MFI lending rates, it is found that whereas the selected lending rates 
generally tend to adjust more or less completely over the long run, the adjustment is far from 
immediate and the speed of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium is also relatively sluggish 
(see table).5 For example, while 91% of the decline in market rates is eventually passed through to short-term loans to households for house purchase, in the month immediately following 
the market rate change only 29% of the decline actually feeds through. In general, corporate 
lending rates tend to adjust somewhat quicker to changes in market rates than rates on loans 
to households for house purchase. For instance, 69% of the decline in market rates is reß ected 4 For a more complete description of banks™ interest rate-setting behaviour, see the article referred to in footnote 1 and the 
references made therein.5 The full model description can be found in the article referred to in footnote 1.

2009in corporate lending rates within the Þ rst month and also the speed of adjustment towards the 
long-run equilibrium is higher. This might reß ect, among other things, the better bargaining 
position of (especially larger) corporations vis-à-vis the banks compared with households.6To determine the extent to which the pass-through of MFI lending rates since the beginning of the 
latest round of ECB policy rate reductions has deviated from past regularities, a model forecast of 

the MFI lending rates based on market rate developments between October 2008 and December 2009 

was produced. The MFI lending rates were consecutively forecasted one month ahead, and the 

cumulated month-on-month forecast changes 

are shown in Chart C, alongside the cumulated 

actual changes in the MFI lending rates. Overall, 

the results indicate that the strong declines in 

market rates have been passed on to a broadly 

similar extent to what would be expected based 

on past experience. Notably, by December 

2009 the pass-through of short-term rates on 

loans to households for house purchase and of 

short-term and long-term rates on loans to non-
Þ nancial corporations was largely in line with 
the forecast.7 At the margin, only the long-term 
rate on loans to households for house purchase 

had adjusted by somewhat less than expected 

based on historical regularities. 
All in all, despite the prevailing negative impact on euro area banks™ balance sheets from 
the Þ nancial crisis and the general economic 
slowdown, in 2009 euro area MFIs appear 
to have managed to pass on the substantial 
reductions in key ECB interest rates to their 
main retail lending rates to a similar degree 
as in the past. Hence, at least as regards 
the bank interest rate channel of monetary 
policy transmission, the substantial easing of 
monetary policy by the ECB since the fourth 6 For example, large corporations have easier access to other sources of 
Þ nancing, such as corporate bonds and quoted equity, and may in 
some cases also obtain Þ nancing in international loan markets.

Þ dence interval.

52ECBAnnual Report
2009THE PACE OF EXTERNAL FINANCING SLOWEDDespite the broad-based moderation in the real cost of external Þ nancing, the rate of 
growth of external Þ nancing by euro area 
non-Þ nancial corporations declined steadily 
in 2009 (see Chart 20). In the third quarter 
of 2009 the real annual growth rate of external 
Þ nancing of euro area non-
Þ nancial corporations 
barely reached 0.1%, down from 2.6% in the last 
quarter of 2008. This was entirely driven by a 
collapse in the contribution of loans granted by 
MFIs, which turned negative in the third quarter 
of 2009. At the same time, the contribution of 
debt securities issuance in particular Œ used as 
an alternative source of Þ nancing by euro area 
Þ rms Œ increased noticeably.
One of the main factors driving the rapid decline 
in external Þ nancing needs was the deteriorating 
economic environment and possibly the need 
for some balance sheet restructuring. The abrupt 
slowdown in economic activity dramatically 
affected corporate earnings and the availability 
of internal funds. Although information on 
corporate proÞ tability derived from 
Þ nancial statements of listed Þ rms has displayed some 
signs of a rebound since the beginning of 
2009, proÞ t ratios did not return to the levels 
prevailing before the crisis (see Chart 21). 
Most stock market-based indicators of euro 
area non-Þ nancial corporations™ pro
Þ tability continued to point towards an ongoing 
contraction during most of 2009. For example, Chart 20 Breakdown of the real annual

the satisfactory pass-through of interest rates does not guarantee that the supply of loans has not 
been affected by the Þ nancial crisis. Thus, the results of the Eurosystem™s bank lending survey 
indicate a continuous net tightening of credit standards on loans to the private sector 
throughout 2009. The continued vulnerabilities and lingering uncertainties concerning the 
soundness of the euro area banking sector call for close monitoring of bank loan pricing behaviour 
and of banks™ general provision of credit to the non-Þ nancial sectors in 2010.

2009the annual rate of change in earnings per share for listed non-Þ nancial corporations in the 
euro area remained on a declining trend and in 
negative territory throughout 2009. The Eurosystem™s bank lending survey also 
suggests that demand-side factors, such as the 

bleak economic outlook, lower Þ xed investment 
by Þ rms and subdued merger and acquisition 
(M&A) activity, had a strong negative impact on 

the demand for loans by euro area non-Þ nancial 
corporations in 2009. Indeed, the annual rate of 

growth of MFI loans to non-Þ nancial corporations 
continued to slow down steadily throughout the 

year, turning negative in September, the Þ rst 
contraction since records began in 1999. While 

the decline in the annual growth rate of MFI 

loans to non-Þ nancial corporations was broadly 
based across all maturities, it was particularly 

pronounced for lending at shorter maturities, 

pointing to some substitution by Þ rms of short-
term loans for longer-term loans. All in all, this 

protracted deceleration is broadly consistent with 

cyclical regularities, considering the magnitude 

of the recent contraction in capital expenditure 

and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding 

economic prospects. Moreover, empirical 

evidence suggests that loans to non-Þ nancial 
corporations typically tend to lag the business 

cycle substantially.
4At the same time, while lower demand appears 

to be a major driver of the decline in MFI loan 

growth, survey evidence suggests that substantial 

weaknesses within the banking system may have 

adversely affected the supply of credit during 

the year. In 2009 the Eurosystem™s bank lending 

survey continued to point to a net tightening of 

credit standards Œ albeit decreasing throughout the 

year Œ and a non-negligible share of euro area Þ rms 
reported a deterioration in the availability of bank 

loans and in banks™ willingness to provide loans 

in the Þ rst half of 2009. However, the effects of 
supply-side constraints on bank lending tended to 

be overshadowed by the exceptional deterioration 

in demand-related determinants in 2009.As bank lending ß ows to non-
Þ nancial corporations started to shrink, euro area Þ rms in need of Þ nancing increasingly turned towards 
alternative sources of funding. In particular, the annual growth rate of debt securities issuance 
rose from 7.9% at the end of 2008 to 16.3% 
at the end of 2009, while the contribution of 
non-Þ nancial corporations to overall debt 
issuance growth surged from 10% before the 
Þ nancial crisis to more than 15% by the end 
of 2009. This was brought about by a renewed 
interest in the European corporate bond market, 
which, considering the continued slump in M&A 
activity, can mostly be explained by two factors. 
First, the rapid decline of corporate bond spreads 
substantially lowered the cost of market-based 
Þ nancing, which fell by more than the cost 
of bank-based Þ nancing. Second, a substitution 
of bank-based Þ nancing by market-based
Þ nancing may have been fostered by tighter 
bank lending standards. As seen for bank loans, 
debt securities issuance activity was much 
stronger at longer maturities. The contribution 
of short-term debt issuance to the overall 
growth rate started to decline at the beginning 
of 2009 and continued to do so until the end of 
the year. This reß ected the sharp contraction 
in net short-term debt securities issuance by 
non-Þ nancial corporations possibly linked to 
reÞ nancing activities. Euro area companies 
took advantage of the very favourable market 
conditions to reÞ nance debt with near-term 
maturities, pushing them forward in time.Supported by the rebound in the stock markets in 2009, the annual growth rate of quoted 
shares issued by non-Þ nancial corporations 
also bounced back in 2009, turning positive in 
March 2009 and accelerating throughout the rest 
of the year, reaching nearly 2.0% in December.A FURTHER INCREASE IN CORPORATE DEBTOwing to a more rapid decline in investment 
than in corporate savings relative to GDP, the 
Þ nancing gap (broadly speaking, the extent 
to which non-Þ nancial corporations need to 
resort to external sources of funding to cover See, for example, C. Kok Sørensen, D. Marqués Ibáñez and 4 C. Rossi, ﬁModelling loans to non-Þ nancial corporations in the 
euro areaﬂ, ECB Working Paper No 989, January 2009.54ECBAnnual Report
2009their investment) narrowed in 2009, for the Þ rst time since mid-2004 (see Chart 22). 
It remained quite substantial, however, pointing 
to the need for some balance sheet restructuring 
given the deterioration in corporate proÞ tability.The combination of moderate, but still positive, 
external Þ nancing ß ows and the slump in 
internal Þ nancing resulted in further increases 
and record high levels of non-Þ nancial corporate leverage ratios in terms of GDP and 
gross operating surplus (see Chart 23). In the 
third quarter of 2009 the debt-to-GDP and debt-
to-gross operating surplus ratios rose to 83.1% 
and 441% respectively. This substantial amount 
of leverage in the non-Þ nancial corporate 
sector might explain the increased number of 
corporate defaults in 2009. At the same time, 
the signiÞ cant declines in interest rates eased the 
net interest burden of non-Þ nancial Þ rms in the 
course of 2009. Overall, the high level of debt 
and the associated interest burden signal a clear 
need for further balance sheet restructuring in 
the euro area non-Þ nancial corporate sector.
2.3 PRICE AND COST DEVELOPMENTS
Annual HICP inß ation fell to 0.3%, on 
average, in 2009, after reaching 3.3% in 2008 
(see Table 1). This swing contrasts sharply 
with previous years, when annual inß ation rates clustered around 2.1% to 2.2%. In the period 
1999-2009, average HICP inß ation was 2.0%. 
The very low HICP inß ation for 2009 resulted, 
largely, from the impact of substantially lower 
oil prices and other commodity prices, compared 
with the high levels seen in 2008 Œ thus reversing 
the inß ationary shock of 2008. However, it also resulted from falling inß ationary pressures in the 
context of a severe contraction in activity and 
rapidly deteriorating labour market conditions.In the course of 2009 overall annual HICP inß ation initially fell, turned negative in the 
middle of the year, and increased again in the 
second part of the year. These sharply contrasting 
developments were dominated by the dynamics 
in commodity prices (particularly oil prices), as was the case in 2008, and

2009effects (see Chart 24). The global economic downturn in the second half of 2008 had rapidly 
pushed down commodity prices to generally 
low levels by the beginning of 2009, from the 
extremely high peaks reached in summer 2008. 
Thus, starting from an annual HICP inß ation rate 
of 1.6% in December 2008, which had quickly 
receded starting from its mid-2008 peak of 
4.0%, inß ation continued to fall during the 
Þ rst part of 2009, mostly on account of negative base 
effects. Inß ation entered into negative territory 
for the Þ rst time in June 2009, reaching a low 
of -0.7% in July 2009 and remaining negative 
until October. In the last quarter of the year 
annual HICP inß ation rapidly recovered from 
its trough, as a result of the combined effect of 
increases in commodity prices and substantial 
base effects. The latter had meanwhile turned Chart 24 Breakdown of HICP inflation: main components(annual percentage changes; monthly data)total HICP (left-hand scale)unprocessed food (right-hand scale)energy (right-hand scale)200420052006200720082009

2009positive, as the impact of the abrupt decline in commodity prices observed in autumn 2008 eventually dropped out of the annual inß ation measures. The annual inß ation rate regained 
positive values in November 2009, to stand at 0.9% in December 2009.Wage growth slowed down in the course of 2009, 
as the rapid deterioration in labour market 
conditions started to exert downward pressure 
on wage settlements, resulting in a moderation 
in regular pay and lower bonuses. Furthermore, 
heavy reliance on reduced working time schemes 
helped limit the increases in compensation 
per employee. Despite the sharply declining 
rate of growth of compensation per employee, 
as productivity per employee fell, unit labour 
costs increased steeply, peaking in the Þ rst quarter of 2009. Margins therefore tightened, 
as sales prices charged by producers moderated, 

so that proÞ ts declined, on account of both 
volume and margin effects.Consumers™ inß ation perceptions and short-term 
expectations, which had peaked in 2008, fell rapidly to very low levels in 2009. Nonetheless, 
long-term expectations, as measured by 
surveys, were very stable, demonstrating that 
expectations had remained Þ rmly anchored to 
the ECB™s objective of keeping inß ation below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.HICP INFLATION TEMPORARILY NEGATIVE, OWING 

TO ENERGY AND FOOD PRICE DEVELOPMENTSThe wide swings in commodity prices were 
one of the main factors driving the pronounced 
movements in euro area HICP inß ation in 2009. 
The rapid decline in euro area HICP inß ation from a peak of 4.0% in July 2008 to a trough 
of -0.7% in July 2009, and the renewed increase 
to 0.9% by December 2009, were largely 
inß uenced by the unprecedented volatility 
in global prices observed over the course of 
2008 and 2009. Energy, industrial and food 
commodity prices plummeted from their peak 
in summer 2008 to a trough in winter 2008-09, 
to rebound again Œ in most cases Œ towards the end of 2009. However, the general decline in HICP rates of change in 2009 was also affected by the clear disinß ationary impact of a 
contracting economy, with gradual moderation 
observable across many of the HICP components 
(see Chart 25).The pronounced movement in the energy component of the HICP Œ which has a weight 
of 9.6% in the overall HICP Œ closely reß ected the changes in fuel prices (such as petrol, diesel 
and heating oil) driven by global oil prices, 
combined with the lagged response of non-
oil energy components (such as electricity 
and gas) to the dynamics in crude oil prices. 
Oil prices (calculated in euro terms) reached 
a trough in December 2008, after falling from 
their June 2008 peak, to climb back halfway up 
again by December 2009. In this context, and 
taking into account the lagged effects in non-oil

2009December 2009, reaching 1.8%. Non-oil energy prices still exerted downward pressure in the 
second half of the year.Euro area food price inß ation slowed down 
steadily in the course of 2009, turning negative in the second half of the year Œ the lowest 
level since the start of the series in 1990. 
This disinß ation process was driven by past 
falls in food commodity prices against 
the background of weak consumer demand. 
The annual growth rate of the processed food component of the HICP, which had reached a 

peak of 7.2% in July 2008 Œ affected by rapidly 
increasing global agricultural commodity 
prices, such as those of bread and cereals, 
dairy products, and oils and fats Œ continued 
on a downward trend in 2009. It reached 0.7% 
by the end of the year, as the prices of these 
commodities eased globally and transport costs 
declined. Overall, in 2009 processed food prices 
increased by 1.1%, on average, compared with 
the 6.1% increase in 2008. Unprocessed food 
price inß ation also decelerated sharply in the 
Þ rst half of 2009, and turned negative in the last 
six months of the year. This downward trend 
can only be partly attributed to weather-related 
developments in fruit and vegetable prices. It 
also derives from a slowdown in the inß ation rate of meat prices, following the reversal of 
the marked 2008 increase in feedstock prices on 
global markets. Excluding energy and (processed and unprocessed) food prices, HICP inß ation has 
followed a gradual downward trend since mid-
2008. This is primarily a result of the dampening 
impact of domestic factors, with a slowdown in 
wage levels and a fall in proÞ t mark-ups, but 
is also, to some extent, a consequence of the 
pass-through from falling commodity prices. Non-energy industrial goods prices rose by, on average, 0.6% in 2009, showing a slight decline 
compared with 0.8% in 2008 and 1% in 2007. 
The ongoing moderation since the beginning 
of 2008 became more pronounced over the 
summer of 2009, with annual inß ation in this 
HICP component standing at 0.4% by December 
2009. This most recent decline in growth rates 
was attributable to a wider range of items than 
before. In addition to falling durable goods 
inß ation, which reached a historical low of 
-1.1% in September 2009 Œ owing, in particular, 
to car dealers offering large discounts Œ 
non-durable goods inß ation started to ease from 
the second half of 2009 onwards, as the pricing 
power of Þ rms declined. This reversed the 
upward trend previously observed for more than 
three years.Services price inß ation, the stickiest of the HICP 
components, which had been broadly stable at relatively elevated levels of around 2.6% 
throughout much of 2008, also started to slow 
down in 2009 and reached 1.6% by end-2009. 
This moderation in services price inß ation was 
related to weak demand and Þ erce competition 
among Þ rms. At a more disaggregated level, 
the decline in inß ation in services prices was 
largely driven by contributions from recreational 
services Œ particularly restaurants and cafés, 
package holidays and accommodation, with 
negative inß ation during the second half of the 
year Œ and, to a lesser extent, transport services. 
Contributions from the latter were almost 
entirely in the passenger transport by air item. 
By contrast, the negative contribution from 
falling communication services prices observed 
over a long period has eased recently. PRODUCER PRICES FELL IN 2009In the context of a worldwide contraction in 
activity and lower commodity prices, in the 
aftermath of a sizeable inß ationary shock, 
severe downward price pressures developed 
along the supply chain. This led to a fall in 
producer prices for a wide range of products, 
affecting Þ rst Œ in late 2008 Œ early stages of 
production and then later stages of production 
in the second half of 2009. This sharp reversal 
of the very high producer price inß ation seen in summer 2008 took place against a background 
of lower commodity prices and low levels of 
demand for production factors (both capital 
and labour). These downward price pressures 58ECBAnnual Report
2009abated somewhat towards the end of the year, amid some upturn in activity and a recovery 
in global commodity prices.The annual rate of change in industrial producer prices (excluding construction) in the euro area 
was -5.1%, on average, in 2009, a reversal 
of the increase of 6.1% recorded in 2008. 
After reaching a trough of -8.4% in July 2009, 
an almost identical reversal of the historical 
peak of 9.1% recorded in July 2008, the 
year-on-year rate of producer price inß ation recovered to stand at -2.9% in December 2009, 
mainly on account of energy price developments. 
The annual rate of change in energy producer 
prices bottomed out at -20.0% in July 2009 and 
stood at -5.1% in December 2009. Excluding construction and energy, the annual growth rate of industrial producer prices, which 
had reached a peak of 4.3% in July 2008, 
declined to -2.3% in December 2009. This 
movement was particularly pronounced for 
intermediate goods, with a lesser amplitude for 
consumer goods and also some lags in capital 
goods (see Chart 26). Intermediate goods price inß ation decelerated 
from its peak of 5.5% in September 2008 to reach a low of -7.6% in July 2009. This reß ected the (delayed) impact of falling industrial raw 
material and energy prices, as well as the 
effect of lower capacity utilisation rates and 
stiffer competition. During the second half 
of the year, the recovery in raw material and 
oil prices led to a stabilisation in the levels of 
intermediate goods prices, with falls in annual 
prices gradually diminishing on account of 
positive base effects. Further down the production chain, the rapid downward movement of producer price inß ation in the Þ eld of consumer goods continued. 
The rate of change in these prices had peaked 
at 5.0% in March 2008 (the highest rate 
since the beginning of EMU in 1999) on the 
back of the inß ationary shock from global 
demand pressures on food prices. While 
the annual growth rate in producer prices of 
consumer goods was -1.9% in December 2009, 
it stood at -0.3% when tobacco and food are 
excluded. Movements in the annual growth 
rate of producer prices of capital goods were 
less pronounced and lagged behind other 
components in the index. Annual inß ation rates 
for these goods declined to zero by the middle 
of 2009 and recorded a negative Þ gure of 
-0.6% in December 2009, as costs moderated, 
order books became depleted in the context 
of a rapid fall in demand, and competition 
intensiÞ ed. Overall, the weak euro area and global demand 
resulted in considerably more competitive market
conditions at various stages of production. 
This competitive environment, combined with 
lower global commodity prices, was reß ected in widespread reports of falling producer 
prices, in input as well as output prices, for both 
manufacturing and services. Chart 26 Breakdown of industrial producer

2009LABOUR COSTS DECELERATED MARKEDLYLabour cost indicators for the euro area suggest a substantial moderation in the course 
of 2009, after an acceleration and a peak in 
2008, which followed years of more modest 
wage developments. However, in the context 
of a sharp decline in hours worked, there were 
noticeable divergences across indicators with 
regard to the extent of this moderation. Negotiated wages decelerated markedly in the course of 2009, to an annual growth rate of 
2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009. In past years 
they had ß uctuated between 2.1% and 2.3% 
before peaking at 3.6% in the fourth quarter of 
2008 (see Table 2). This indicator captures the 
main component of wages settled in advance 
through collective agreements. Its slowdown 
probably reß ects the decreasing in
ß uence of 
workers™ bargaining power, as a consequence 
of the sharp downturn in economic activity, 
the ensuing deterioration in euro area labour 
market conditions and the rapid increase in 
unemployment, as well as the signiÞ cant drop 
in inß ation. However, given that annual GDP 
growth for the euro area stood at -4.0% in the 
third quarter of 2009 (see Table 3 in Section 2.4 
of this chapter), it appears that negotiated wages 
have adapted only partially to the economic 
slowdown. The annual growth rate of compensation per employee reversed its upward path even 
earlier than negotiated wages. It peaked at 3.6% 
in the third quarter of 2008 before adjusting 
downwards more rapidly to stand at 1.4% in the third quarter of 2009, the lowest rate of 
growth recorded since the beginning of EMU. 
The more accentuated fall in this labour cost 
indicator, as compared with negotiated wages 
(known as ﬁwage driftﬂ), resulted from the fact 
that this indicator encompasses ß exible pay 
elements such as bonuses Œ which, according to 
anecdotal evidence, were reduced signiÞ cantly. In addition, compensation per employee was 
automatically affected by shorter working hours, 
a measure to which many Þ rms resorted during 
the economic downturn. While this slowdown in growth in compensation per employee was broad-based across countries, 
the sectoral breakdown points to substantial 
differences. Particularly steep falls were 
observed in industry excluding construction Œ 
which often resorted to shorter working 
hours Œ where growth in compensation per 
employee fell to zero by mid-year. By contrast, 
growth rates in compensation per employee 
in the construction sector remained elevated 
at 3.0% in the third quarter of 2009, notably 
reß ecting some composition effects, with 
lay-offs concentrated on lower-paid workers in 
particular amid pronounced regional differences 
(see Chart 27). In contrast to compensation per employee, the annual growth rate of hourly labour 
costs remained elevated, although easing 
noticeably from its peak of 4.4% in the fourth 
quarter of 2008. This stickier rate of increase 
essentially reß ected the fact that hours worked 
per employee fell by nearly 2% in the year to Table 2 Labour cost indicators(annual percentage changes, unless otherwise indicated)2007200820092008

2009the third quarter of 2009 and that cuts in hours worked are typically accompanied by less 
than proportional decreases in remuneration 
(see Box 5). Year-on-year growth in hourly 
labour costs therefore also exceeded that 
of negotiated wages, despite the impact of 
reductions in bonuses. Year-on-year increases in 
hourly labour costs were highest in the industrial 
sector, where ß exible time schemes were used 
most liberally. Given that the slowdown in activity was accompanied by labour hoarding in many parts 
of the euro area, there was a strong fall in labour 
productivity growth as measured by output 
per employee. As compensation per employee 
growth reacted much less strongly to the 
slowdown, unit labour costs accelerated rapidly, 
reaching a year-on-year peak of 5.9% in the Þ rst quarter of 2009. This rise had a severe impact 
on business margins. Unit labour cost growth 
fell back to 3.5% by the third quarter of 2009, 
as cyclical effects started to reverse. This pattern 
of unit labour cost growth was mainly affected by the annual growth rate of labour productivity, 

which, after declining to, on average, -0.2% 
in 2008 (compared with growth rates of around 
1% to 1.5% in 2006-07), reached a ß oor in the 
Þ rst quarter of 2009, with a contraction of 3.8%, 
year on year. This rate moderated to a 2.0% 
contraction by the third quarter of 2009, on the 
back of expanding output, while redundancies 
continued (see Chart 28). PROFIT MARGINSOperating margins started falling rapidly 
as unit labour costs surged. Global sales 
prices came under pressure, as reß ected in 
the annual growth rate of the GDP deß ator, which had fallen rapidly from 2.3% in 
mid-2008 to 0.9% in the third quarter of 2009 
(see Chart 29). An indicator of overall proÞ t mark-up, measured as the difference between 
the rate of growth of the GDP deß ator and 
that of unit labour costs, points to a sharp fall 
in proÞ t margins by 
3.5 percentage points in the 
Þ rst three quarters of 
2009, after having declined by 1.3 percentage points in 2008.Chart 27 Sectoral compensation per employee(annual percentage changes; quarterly data)-101

2009In this context, operating proÞ ts of companies, 
measured in gross terms, contracted by 11%, year on year, in the Þ rst three quarters of 2009. 
This was attributable to the volume effect of 
a fall in economic activity and to the margin 
effect of the decline in proÞ t per unit of output, 
in roughly equal measure.RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY 

PRICES FELL 
Residential property prices in the euro area, 

which are not included in the measurement of 

the HICP, fell in the Þ rst half of 2009, following 
a slowing trend observed since the second half 

of 2005. According to the latest estimates, 

residential property prices for the euro area, 

as a whole, fell by around 2.4%, year on year, 

in the Þ rst half of 2009. This drop followed 
an increase of 2.8% in the Þ rst half of 2008 
and one of 0.8% in the second half of 2008 

(see Chart 30). Country data conÞ rm that 
the drop in house prices in the euro area 

was relatively broad-based, notwithstanding a 

substantial degree of heterogeneity both across 

countries and across regions within countries. 

House prices, which had started to fall in Ireland 

in the second half of 2007 and in Malta in the 
Þ rst half of 2008, again registered steep declines 
in Ireland and Malta in the Þ rst half of 2009. 
In addition, house prices also registered signiÞ cant 
falls in Spain, France, Slovenia and Finland in 

the Þ rst half of 2009. By contrast, house prices 
increased in the Þ rst half of 2009 in Italy, Austria 
and Portugal. In Germany, data show only small 

decreases in house prices for 2009, following a 

period of subdued increases. 
The capital values of commercial property in the euro area have been declining since the 
beginning of 2008. This decline is consistent 
with the notion that commercial property 
values in the euro area have been more cyclical 
than residential property prices during the 
last decade. The deterioration in euro area 
commercial property markets has been rather 
broad-based. All euro area countries for which 
data are available have recorded declines in the 
capital values of prime property since the fourth 
quarter of 2008. On average, year-on-year price 
declines have hovered between 10% and 13% 
in recent quarters. However, this varies across 
countries, with annual price decreases of 50% 
in some countries and modest price declines in 
others. In general, the countries that recorded Chart 30 Residential property price

2009the steepest price increases between 2004 and 2007 are those that have been witnessing the 
largest corrections since the beginning of 2008. DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION EXPECTATIONSInformation derived from Consensus Economics, 

the Euro Zone Barometer and the ECB Survey 

of Professional Forecasters indicates that 

survey-based long-term inß ation expectations 
(Þ ve years ahead) remained close to 2.0%. 
According to the ECB Survey of Professional 

Forecasters, the average point estimates of 

inß ation for 2014 by forecasters polled by the 
ECB remained within a narrow corridor of 

1.9% to 2% in the course of 2009. In addition, 

break-even inß ation rates derived from 
inß ation-linked bonds and 
comparable rates 
extracted from inß ation-linked swaps in the euro 
area (using the implied Þ ve-year forward rate 
Þ ve years ahead) remained within a range of 
2.2% to 2.7% in 2009. As noted in Section 2.2 

of this chapter, these market-based measures 

can give a distorted signal at times, and 

distortions related to liquidity issues appear to 

have impacted signiÞ cantly on these measures 
over the past year. All in all, both surveys and 

market-based indicators continued to suggest 

little risk of inß ation expectations becoming 
unanchored.

2009This considerable contraction Œ by far the largest on record Œ was mainly brought about by 
the very steep fall in output that occurred in the 
last quarter of 2008 and the Þ rst quarter of 2009, 
in the midst of renewed Þ nancial turmoil, 
heightened uncertainty and an unprecedented 
decline in world activity and demand. 
Confronted with the sudden deterioration in 
business prospects, rapidly depleting order 
books and costlier and reduced access to 
Þ nancing, Þ rms reacted by postponing expansion 
plans and cutting inventories. Households, 
faced with greater uncertainty, increased their 
savings in the context of a deterioration in 
short-term job prospects and portfolio losses. 
As a consequence, GDP fell by a cumulated 
4.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the Þ rst quarter of 2009. Thereafter, output broadly 
stabilised in the course of the second quarter 
of 2009 and returned to positive growth in the 
second half of the year Œ albeit at a moderate 
pace and from a very low base Œ as Þ nancial conditions gradually improved and external 
trade picked up again. THE FALL IN GDP WAS LARGELY DRIVEN 

BY DEVELOPMENTS IN PRIVATE CAPITAL 

EXPENDITURE AND EXTERNAL TRADEThe sharp contraction in demand in the 
fourth quarter of 2008 and the Þ rst quarter 
of 2009 emanated predominantly from 
developments in private capital expenditure 
and international trade. By contrast, government 
expenditure (both consumption and capital 
expenditure) continued to grow and the 
contraction in private consumption was more 
moderate. The deterioration in the external 
environment from mid-2008 developed into a 
severe downturn following the intensiÞ cation of the Þ nancial crisis in the last quarter of the 
year, with weakening growth in advanced and 
emerging economies. The suspension of trades 
and the postponement of deliveries, as businesses 
tried to economise along the global supply chain, 
led to a particularly sharp contraction in 
exports in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the 
Þ rst quarter of 2009. Against that background, 
Þ rms cut capital expenditure sharply in both 
Þ xed investment and inventories. With rapidly 
deteriorating housing markets, the decline 
in household investment also accelerated. 
At the same time, a number of government 
measures taken in the context of the European 
Economic Recovery Plan, together with 
accelerating disinß ation, supported household 
income and moderated the fall in consumption 
(see Chart 31).Private consumption decreased by about 
1% in 2009 on the back of an increase in 

precautionary savings. At the same time, the 

growth of households™ real disposable income 

remained relatively resilient, at close to 1% per 

annum, particularly when compared with the 

size of the contraction in output and, thus, in 

the total disposable income of the euro area. 

This relative resilience stemmed from four 

main factors. First, the growth of compensation 

per employee slowed less markedly than labour 

productivity, as wages continued to grow, 

largely as a result of the length of collective 

agreements (see Section 2.3 of this chapter). 

In addition, employment contracted much 

less than production, owing to labour 

hoarding by Þ rms, notably using government-

2009subsidised schemes. Third, Þ scal stimulus 
measures, as well as automatic stabilisers in government budgets, lent considerable support 
to households™ disposable income in the form of 
strong growth in social beneÞ ts, slower growth 
in social contributions and falling income taxes. 
Finally, the very low inß ation recorded in 2009, 
on average, also contributed to this resilience. However, against a background of increased uncertainty, worsening labour market 
prospects, falling Þ nancial wealth, tightening 
credit conditions and deteriorating housing 
markets, households increased their saving 
rate substantially. It rose by an estimated 
1.6 percentage points in one year, from 14.1% 
in 2008, reaching levels in spring 2009 that 
were last seen at the time of its 2002-03 peak. 
In the third quarter of 2009 the seasonally 
adjusted saving rate decreased slightly. 
Consumer conÞ dence indicators, which peaked 
in mid-2007, plummeted in autumn 2008 
and reached historically low levels in spring 
2009, before recovering in the rest of the year 
(see Chart 32). The deteriorating outlook for 
the labour market contributed to the decline 
in consumer conÞ dence, inducing households 
to rein back expenditure and build up 
precautionary savings. Households™ uncertainty 
about the economic outlook was also heightened 
by falling housing prices and a steep decline 
in Þ nancial wealth as stock markets slumped 
from their peak, despite a partial reversal that 
started in the second quarter of 2009. The fact 
that developments in saving rates differed 
widely across regions points to large variations 
in conditions and conÞ dence, particularly with 
respect to labour markets, across the euro area.After having fallen by 1.3% in the year to the Þ rst quarter of 2009, household spending tended 
to stabilise in the remainder of 2009, beneÞ ting notably from government-sponsored subsidies 
for consumers who scrapped old cars and 
bought new ones. These temporary schemes 
led to a surge in car registrations from the low 
levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the 
Þ rst quarter of 2009, helping to clear excess car inventories and paving the way for an upturn in 
automotive output. Government consumption growth remained dynamic in 2009, accelerating slightly from 
a growth rate of 2% in 2008, as its main 
components (wages of government employees 
and social transfers paid in kind) were not 
affected by cyclical developments in the short 
run. Moreover, governments were generally keen 
to support the economy during the recession. Total Þ xed investment fell very steeply, declining 
by an estimated 11% in 2009, following a slight decline in 2008 and two years of elevated 
growth (5.7% in 2006 and 4.7% in 2007), 
with particularly sharp quarter-on-quarter 
contractions in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 
the Þ rst quarter of 2009. In contrast to private 
investment, government investment remained 
dynamic, with growth even accelerating, owing 
to the gradual impact of the counter-cyclical 
spending decisions taken by governments since 
the end of 2008. Chart 32 Confidence indicators(percentage balances; seasonally adjusted)-40-35

2009Looking at the components of private investment in more detail, housing investment contracted 
sharply in 2009, with a reduction of around 10%, 
against a background of falling house prices. 
This was around double the rate recorded in 2008 

after the end of the expansionary phase of the 
residential construction cycle in 2007. The 
contraction was generally more pronounced in 
countries that had experienced very fast growth 
in housing prices in the middle of the decade 
and was particularly acute in some of them. Corporate Þ xed investment fell even more 
rapidly than housing investment, declining by around 14%, year on year, in contrast 
to the modest growth seen in 2008, when it 
beneÞ ted from a dynamic 
Þ rst half of the year. 
Increased uncertainty about future prospects, 
collapsing demand, low capacity pressures 
and deteriorating proÞ t margins, as well as 
initially tighter Þ nancing conditions, contributed 
to varying degrees to this particularly sharp 
contraction in corporate investment. Inventories, which are another key variable explaining the dynamics of business non-Þ nancialinvestment, played an important role in 
accentuating the economic downturn. They 
contributed an estimated 0.7 percentage point 
to the decline in GDP for 2009 as a whole, 
with large negative quarterly contributions to 
GDP growth in the Þ rst half of 2009 (amounting 
to more than 1.4 percentage points of GDP) 
followed by some rebound in the second half of 
the year. Firms started to cut retail inventories 
and input inventories in manufacturing in the 
second half of 2008. By contrast, Þ nished goods inventories in manufacturing built up 
at an accelerating pace, according to surveys, 
as companies initially underestimated the speed 
of the fall in demand. This, coupled with an 
expected further contraction in demand and an 
increase in the holding costs of inventories, led to 
a perception that the levels of inventories were 
much higher than they should be in autumn 2008. 

Falling output prices (for commodities and 
industrial goods) pushed the cost of holding 
inventories to record high levels in autumn 2008 
and provided strong incentives to reduce them. Striving to maintain an optimal inventories-
to-sales ratio, Þ rms started to cut production 
sharply and, accordingly, the destocking of 
Þ nished goods started to gain speed. Extensive 
destocking of all types of inventory took place 
in early 2009, reaching a peak in the second 
quarter. During the second half of the year 
destocking slowed, as inventories fell rapidly to 
their trend levels, thus supporting GDP growth 
(see Chart 33). At the end of 2009 surveys and 
other anecdotal evidence suggested that excess 
inventories had largely been cleared and that 
inventories were often perceived to be ﬁleanﬂ. Euro area exports of goods and services 
contracted by around 13% in 2009, after 

posting growth rates of 0.8% in 2008 and 

6.3% in 2007 (these Þ gures include intra-euro 
area trade). The worsening of the external 

environment as from mid-2008 developed 

into a severe downturn in the last quarter of 

the year, with the suspension of many trades 

and the deferment of deliveries leading to 

a particularly sharp contraction in exports.

2009Consistent with the notion of a contracting 
supply chain, demand for intermediate goods 

was strongly affected, as was demand for 

capital goods. At the same time, the euro 

appreciated substantially in nominal effective 

terms, which may have weighed further on 

exports. Nevertheless, exports started to grow 

again in the second half of 2009, as economic 

activity bottomed out in major export markets, 

trading partners stopped destocking and the 

global supply chain began to function more 

normally again. In the last few months of the 

year, various surveys on industrial export 

orders and order books were showing a return 

to growth. In parallel, euro area imports 

contracted in 2009 (although less than exports), 

reß ecting shrinking domestic demand. As the 
impact of falling exports dominated, net trade 

made a substantial negative contribution of 

close to 0.8 percentage point to GDP growth 

in 2009 as a whole. This reß ected the impact 
(including the associated carry-over effects) of 

the large quarterly negative contributions 

reported in the second half of 2008 and the Þ rst 
quarter of 2009, despite positive contributions 

in the remainder of the year. 
A SHARP CONTRACTION IN INDUSTRIAL 

PRODUCTIONFrom a sectoral perspective, the contraction in 
output predominantly affected industry Œ to a 
greater extent than is warranted by the stylised 
fact that the industrial sector tends to display 
greater sensitivity to the economic cycle Œ with 
value added in industry excluding construction 
falling by 15.8%, year on year, in the Þ rst nine months of 2009. Market-related services 
and construction declined by 2.8% and 4.9% 
respectively. Manufacturing activity fell particularly quickly in the six months to February 2009, and reached 
its lowest point in April 2009, at a level 22% 
lower than its peak in January 2008. Thereafter, 
manufacturing production started to recover, 
albeit at a slow pace. Capacity utilisation in the 
manufacturing sector declined to a record low of 
69.6% in July (according to survey data), well 
below its long-term average of 81.4%. Output of intermediate goods contracted 
particularly sharply in reaction to the halting 
of deliveries and destocking along the supply 
chain. Production of capital goods declined as 
well, suffering from weaker external demand, 
shrinking domestic investment and the rapid 
depletion of order backlogs, as did output in the 
car industry. In the second half of 2009 output 
recovered more quickly in the intermediate goods 
sector and in the car industry (see Chart 34). 
Construction output continued to be particularly 
weak, with a further deterioration in residential 
construction. This was particularly severe in a 
number of countries, notably those where the 
weight of the construction sector in terms of 
GDP had increased signiÞ cantly before the 
Þ nancial turmoil. Government measures aimed 
at accelerating infrastructure projects provided 
some compensation for this sector. Although more resilient, market-related services output nonetheless fell year on year, by close 
to 3% in terms of value added. Business-to-
business services came under growing pressure, Chart 34 Industrial production growth

2009while companies cut purchases wherever possible and focused on essential expenditure. 
Transport was particularly affected by the 
slowdown in deliveries and disruptions in 
supply chain ß ows, and employment services,  
a very cyclical industry, fell dramatically. 
Evidence suggests that car rentals, advertising 
and advisory services suffered a substantial 
decline in output. By contrast, businesses 
connected to the restructuring of Þ rms prospered 
and outsourcing remained relatively strong 
on the back of renewed cost-cutting efforts. 
In addition, computer services experienced less 
acute setbacks. Consumer-oriented services
tended to fare better overall, although many 
branches reported contractions. Retail trade as a 
whole was affected by declining consumption, 
with a marked shift in the structure of demand 
towards cheaper, non-branded goods, which 
led to a steep decline in demand for more 
costly goods. DETERIORATION IN THE LABOUR MARKET 
Conditions in the euro area labour market 
deteriorated sharply in 2009. This followed the 
reversal in 2008 of the sustained improvements 
registered in the two previous years, which 
had led to particularly tight labour markets 
and mounting wage pressures by end-2007. 
At the same time, the contraction in employment and the ensuing increase in unemployment were 
signiÞ cantly less marked than could have been 
expected given the unprecedented size of the 
decline in output Œ even taking into account 
the stylised fact that employment lags the 
business cycle. In addition, the impact of these 
developments on various groups of workers, 
as well as countries, was rather heterogeneous 
(see Box 5). Euro area employment (measured in number 
of persons) contracted by 2.1% in the year 

to the third quarter of 2009 (see Table 4). 

In addition, Þ rms reduced working time sharply, 
often taking advantage of short-time 
working arrangements subsidised by the government, 
as was the case in Belgium, Germany and Italy. 
As a result, the average number of hours worked 
per person decreased by 2%. Productivity per 
hour worked fell sharply, thereby affecting 
proÞ t margins. Many 
Þ rms preferred to bear 
the limited cost of hoarding labour rather than 
face the higher costs associated with workers™ 
dismissal (e.g. a loss of human capital or 
separation costs). Productivity growth recovered 
only slightly in the second half of the year. 
Apparent labour productivity, measured as 
GDP divided by total employment, contracted 
sharply, declining by, on average, close to 
2.2% in 2009. Table 4 Labour market developments(percentage changes compared with the previous period; percentages) 2007200820092008

2009Taking a sectoral perspective, employment in the construction sector continued to fall, 
declining at an annual rate of 7.9% in the third 
quarter of 2009. This was a result of increasing 
overcapacity, which was particularly acute in 
some countries, as well as the relatively high 
proportion of temporary workers employed 
in this sector. In a context of an accelerating 
decline in output, industry excluding construction 
started to reduce employment, albeit with a lag, 
by 6% in the year to the third quarter of 2009. 
Employment growth in the services sector fell 
more moderately, by 0.6%, year on year, in the 
third quarter of 2009. Some sectors were more 
affected, in particular Þ nancial intermediation, 
against a background of cost-cutting by banks, 
as well as trade and transport, work placement 
services and some other services.In 2009 the average monthly increase in the number of unemployed persons stood 
at around 230,000, with a peak of around 
450,000 in the Þ rst quarter of 2009 and monthly 
increases closer to 80,000 at the end of the year. 
The unemployment rate stood at 9.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009, after bottoming out 
at 7.2%, its lowest level in decades, in the Þ rst quarter of 2008 (see Chart 35).Box 5EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EURO AREA IN 2009 
After a moderation of employment growth 
in 2008, euro area labour markets deteriorated 
in 2009, as economic growth contracted and 
unemployment began to rise more quickly. 
This box reviews euro area employment 
developments in 2009 and examines 
the differing experiences of some of the 
Member States, as well as of different groups 
within the labour market.In general, developments in labour market variables tend to lag those in economic 
activity (see Chart A). By early 2009 there 
were increasing signs that the fallout from the 
economic downturn, which had initially led to 
a sharp and sudden contraction of employment 
in the construction sector, was beginning to Chart A Euro area GDP and employment

2009spread to the wider economy, particularly industry and, to a lesser extent, private sector services (see Chart B). By the summer of 2009 employment was contracting at the sharpest rate since the 
second quarter of 1993. Several groups appear to have borne the brunt of the labour market downturn Œ in particular, younger workers, those with temporary contracts and the lower skilled (see Chart C). The sharp 
downturn in employment growth for young workers has led to a substantial increase in youth 
unemployment across the euro area, which now stands at its highest level since November 1997. 
While employment for workers on temporary contracts had already begun to decline substantially 
in 2008, this contraction intensiÞ ed sharply at the beginning of 2009. Workers with permanent 
contracts have so far been less affected, reß ecting, inter alia, the generally higher levels of 
employment protection afforded to them.1 Lower-skilled workers also experienced a signiÞ cant contraction in employment. To some extent, these patterns are typical of recessions, but raise 
important concerns about skill atrophy, possible hysteresis effects and, ultimately, potential 
output losses if unemployed workers become discouraged about employment prospects and 
withdraw from the labour market, or if human capital investments of young or lower-skilled 
workers are delayed or distorted.1 See also the boxes entitled ﬁLabour market adjustments during the current contraction of economic activityﬂ and ﬁThe composition of

70ECBAnnual Report
2009Changes in total hours workedThe decline in employment was not the only manifestation of a sharp reduction 
in labour demand. In the second quarter 
of 2009 the euro area witnessed the largest 
year-on-year fall in total hours worked since 
the start of the series (2001). While a large 
part of this drop reß ected sharp reductions in headcount employment (particularly losses of 
full-time jobs) across the euro area, in the 
middle of 2009 a similar proportion stemmed 
from a substantial reduction in the average 
weekly working hours of those in employment 
(see Chart D).2 Schemes adjusting working hours have been extensively used by the private 
sector, supported by measures introduced or 
extended by governments designed to protect 
jobs during the downturn. Such measures may 
be beneÞ cial in the short term since they help 
Þ rms unsure as to the likely duration or depth 
of a perceived downturn to maintain headcount 
employment, thus avoiding costly losses of 
human capital and unemployment. But there 
are risks attached to the protracted use of such schemes over the longer term, particularly if 
such measures prevent an efÞ cient sectoral reallocation of resources following long-standing 
imbalances. Unemployment developmentsAlready on the rise since the spring of 2008, unemployment began to increase more rapidly at the 
beginning of 2009, with record increases in the numbers of unemployed persons posted in the Þ rst quarter of the year. Despite some moderation in the rate of increase in subsequent months, job 

losses continued at quarterly rates previously unseen in the euro area. Thus, by the end of 2009 the 

euro area unemployment rate had reached 10.0%  Œ the highest for a decade. Moreover, large cross-

country disparities remained, with several euro area countries (in particular Ireland and Spain) 

experiencing relatively large increases in national unemployment rates, while others incurred rather 

modest increases, despite relatively large falls in output (particularly Germany and Italy).3 Undoubtedly, part of the marked cross-country disparity can be seen as the consequence 
of a sharp adjustment to previous bubbles in the construction industry, with 
Ireland 
and Spain suffering disproportionately from the acute contraction of their formerly large 2 The data reported are taken from the European Labour Force Survey, since no euro area aggregates are available at a quarterly frequency 
from national accounts sources. For changes in hours worked inferred from national accounts sources, on the basis of compilations of 
available data for the three largest euro area economies only, see the box entitled ﬁRecent developments in euro area productivityﬂ in 

the December 2009 issue of the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin. 3 See also the box entitled ﬁLinks between output and unemployment in the euro areaﬂ in the October 2009 issue of the ECB
’s Monthly Bulletin. 
Since the euro area™s unemployment rate low of 7.2% was recorded in March 2008, Spain alone has accounted for just over half of the euro 

area™s stock of 4.3 million newly unemployed, with France and Italy contributing around one-Þ fth and one-tenth respectively. Despite its 
relatively small population, Ireland contributed some 3.9%, while the euro area™s largest economy, Germany, contributed just 0.8%.

2009and buoyant construction sectors. It can also be explained by the very different institutional settings and divergent responses to the downturn of the governments of the euro area. Hence, the 
extensive use of increased ß exibility in working-time arrangements, particularly in the industrial 
sectors in Germany and Italy, has helped to slow the rise in unemployment in these countries. By 
contrast, the higher incidence of temporary contracts and lower reliance on short-time working 
schemes in Spain have led to substantial labour shedding there, and thus to a considerable increase 
in measured unemployment Œ to around 20% of the total labour force. Policy implications
The depth of the recession has been unprecedented in recent times. With unemployment likely to increase further for some time to come, labour market policy-makers will need to ensure that 
recent deteriorations do not translate into higher structural unemployment. Longer-term labour 
market improvements are likely to depend heavily on the euro area™s ability to reorganise and 
restructure in the light of the turmoil. This process of creative restructuring is likely to require 
further reforms in both labour and product markets to help enhance long-term employment 
prospects and facilitate labour mobility during the transition process. These will include efforts 
to enhance wage ß exibility Œ allowing for sufÞ cient differentiation according to labour market 
conditions, the competitive situation of Þ rms and the productivity of workers Œ in order to 
stimulate labour demand. In addition, a timely dismantling of crisis measures, including the 
current heavy reliance on short-time working schemes, will be required to enable the necessary 
reallocation of labour from less to more productive sectors. Further structural reforms will help 
ease labour market transitions and facilitate the reintegration of displaced workers into jobs. 
Reforms which enhance the efÞ ciency and effectiveness of active labour market policies, 
including those which combine ß exible working arrangements or social support with policies 
which foster human capital acquisition and lifelong learning, would help to ease the unemployed 
back into jobs. Similarly, easing employment protection legislation for permanent workers would 
help to alleviate some of the existing labour market dualism. It would also particularly beneÞ t new entrants to the labour force who have so far been disproportionately hit by the recession and 
who are potential sources of dynamism and innovation. In product markets, enhanced competition 
would help to foster innovation and the implementation of efÞ cient working practices.
2.5 FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS
SHARP WORSENING IN BUDGETARY POSITIONS 
IN 2009Against the backdrop of the Þ nancial crisis, 
a major economic contraction and counter-
cyclical Þ scal stimulus measures, budgetary 
positions in the euro area countries worsened 
drastically in 2009, following the Þ scal deterioration of the previous year. According to 
the European Commission™s autumn economic 
forecasts published on 3 November 2009, 
the average general government deÞ cit ratio 
in the euro area increased from 2.0% of 
GDP in 2008 to 6.4% in 2009, marking the largest budget deterioration in a single year 
since the inception of EMU (see Table 5). 
The deterioration in the budgetary situation 
took place alongside a strong decline in 
GDP and was mainly driven by expenditure 
dynamics, as well as revenue shortfalls brought 
about in part by tax cuts and other stimulus 
measures. Accordingly, the euro area average 
revenue-to-GDP ratio fell by 0.8 percentage 
point to 44.0%, whereas the expenditure ratio 
jumped by 3.6 percentage points of GDP to the 
relatively high level of 50.4% of GDP. The Commission™s autumn 2009 forecasts are, on average, slightly less favourable than the 72ECBAnnual Report
2009estimates presented in the updated stability programmes that were submitted by most 
euro area countries between December 2009 
and February 2010. The updated stability 
programmes point to a somewhat smaller deÞ cit for the euro area as a whole, amounting to 6.2% 
of GDP in 2009 (see Table 5). Almost all euro 
area countries recorded a deÞ cit above the 3% 
of GDP reference value, with three countries Œ Ireland, Greece and Spain Œ recording double-
digit deÞ cit ratios. 
In the context of the autumn 2009 notiÞ cation, following a change of government, Greece 
revised signiÞ cantly upwards its noti
Þ ed de
Þ cit ratio for 2008 Œ by 2.1 percentage points, to 
7.7% of GDP Œ and its deÞ cit ratio planned

2009of GDP Œ revealing a very serious Þ scal imbalance. In the case of the deÞ cit revision 
for 2008, the main reason was the inclusion of deliveries of medical products by public 
hospitals that had exceeded their budgets. 
For 2009, the revision reß ected the fact that 
the original forecast was largely based on 
a budgetary target that had not been revised on 
the basis of the already available quarterly and 
monthly government Þ nance statistics. The 2009 
deterioration is mostly on account of expenditure 
overruns, particularly public investments and 
subsidies to social security funds, and revenue 
shortfalls in direct and indirect taxes. The 
revisions, which followed a pattern already 
observed in previous years, highlighted 
systemic deÞ ciencies in the production of 
Greek Þ scal statistics and forecasts. Eurostat 
expressed reservations regarding the quality of 
data reported by Greece, given the signiÞ cant uncertainties surrounding the Þ gures and did not 
validate the notiÞ ed Þ scal data.
By the end of February 2010, 13 euro area 

countries were subject to an excessive 

deÞ cit procedure. In December 2009 the 
ECOFIN Council set a deadline of 2013 for 
the correction of excessive deÞ cits in most 
countries, with a deadline of 2012 in the 

cases of Belgium and Italy and one of 2014 

for Ireland (see Table 6). In February 2010 

the ECOFIN Council took decisions regarding 

Malta and Greece. In the case of Malta, where 

the authorities had planned to reduce the 

2009 deÞ cit ratio below the reference value, a 
deadline of 2011 was set. With regard to Greece, 

following a decision under Article 126(8) 

of the Treaty that effective action had not 

been taken to correct the excessive deÞ cit 
in 2009, the Council adopted a decision under 

Article 126(9) giving notice to the country 

to take action within the framework of the 

excessive deÞ cit procedure. The decision set 
2012 as the deadline for Greece to correct its 

excessive deÞ cit and also invited the country 
to submit a detailed timetable for measures to 

be taken and to report on these regularly and 

publicly. Requirements for Greece followed 

the European Council™s statement, made on 

11 February 2010, that EU governments fully 

support the efforts of the Greek government and 

their commitment to do whatever is necessary 

to ensure that the ambitious consolidation 

targets are met.

2009Declining economic activity, increasing deÞ cits and government interventions in response to the Þ nancial crisis contributed to rapidly growing 
government debt-to-GDP ratios. According to 
the Commission™s autumn 2009 projections, 
the average general government gross debt ratio 
of the euro area increased sharply to 78.2% of 
GDP in 2009, from 69.3% of GDP in 2008. 
The updated stability programmes show a 
broadly similar euro area debt ratio for 2009 
(see Table 5). DeÞ cit-debt adjustments, which 
also capture the ﬁbelow-the-lineﬂ impact of bank recapitalisations and loans to private 
enterprises (see Box 6), again added to the 
total debt ratio. In 2009 ten euro area countries 
recorded debt ratios of above the 60% of GDP 
reference value (compared with seven in 2007), 
with two countries (Greece and Italy) recording 
triple-digit debt ratios. In all countries, the trend in the debt ratio has been rising since 2007-08. 
Furthermore, government guarantees, which are 
recorded off balance sheet, substantially increased 
the level of general government contingent liabilities. Box 6GOVERNMENT SUPPORT TO THE BANKING SECTOR DURING THE 2008-09 FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE 

IMPACT ON EURO AREA PUBLIC FINANCESIn response to the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial crisis in September 2008 (i.e. after the default 
of US investment bank Lehman Brothers), euro area governments adopted national measures to 
support their Þ nancial systems and ensure appropriate 
Þ nancing conditions for the real economy. 
Such measures were in accordance with the EU™s common guiding principles 1, subsequent guidance provided by European Commission communications 2, and ECB recommendations 3.Initially, public support targeted the liabilities side of bank balance sheets through: i) government 
guarantees for interbank lending and new debt issued by banks, ii) recapitalisation of Þ nancial institutions in difÞ culty, including capital injections and loans, and iii) increased coverage of 
retail deposit insurance schemes. From early 2009 public support began to be directed at the assets side of bank balance sheets, given the high uncertainty regarding asset valuations and the risks from new asset write-downs. 
Asset relief schemes included: i) asset removal schemes (i.e. impaired assets are removed from 
balance sheets), and ii) asset insurance schemes (i.e. assets are kept on balance sheets but banks 
are insured against tail risk). Although successful in restoring stability to the Þ nancial system, these interventions entailed 
substantial Þ scal costs for the euro area governments. According to the statistical recording principles, 
as clariÞ ed by Eurostat, government support in the form of capital injections and asset purchases is 
to be recorded as a Þ nancial transaction affecting government debt but having no impact on the 
1 At the ECOFIN Council meeting on 7 October 2008, it was agreed that national measures in support of systemic 
Þ nancial institutions 
would be adopted for a limited period and within a coordinated framework, while having due regard to the interests of taxpayers. On 12 October 2008 euro area countries adopted a concerted European Action Plan, whose principles were endorsed by the European Council a few days later and which guided the adoption of (additional) national measures to support the Þ nancial system.
2 The European Commission has adopted the following communications: i) the Banking Communication, OJ C 270, 25.10.2008, p. 8; 
ii) the Recapitalisation Communication, OJ C 10, 15.01.2009, p. 2; iii) the Commission Communication on impaired assets, OJ C 72, 26.03.2009, p. 1; and iv) the Commission Communication on the return to viability and the assessment of restructuring 
measures in the Þ nancial sector, OJ C 195, 19.08.2009, p. 9.

2009government deÞ cit/surplus, unless such capital 
injections and asset purchases are conducted at 
above/below market price. Depending on the 

government borrowing requirements to Þ nance 
the rescue operations, there can be an impact on 

gross government debt. Government guarantees 

represent contingent liabilities and are recorded 

off balance sheet. 
The chart provides an overview of the Þ nancial sector stabilisation measures carried out by euro area governments in 2008 and 2009 
(to the left of the vertical blue line), including 
the creation of special-purpose entities (SPEs), 
which beneÞ t from government guarantees. 
It also shows (to the right of the vertical blue 
line) the impact on the government debt ratio 
and on the amount of guarantees, including 
those covering the debt issued by SPEs, 
committed and to some extent provided by 
euro area governments by the end of 2009. For the period 2008-09 the cumulative impact on euro area general government debt owing to stabilisation operations (also taking into account 
repayments of capital support in some countries) was 2.5% of GDP, whereas the impact on the 
general government deÞ cit has been small. 
In addition to the direct impact on deÞ cits and debt, bank rescue operations have entailed 
broader Þ scal risks, which may materialise with an adverse impact on government accounts 
over the medium to long term. Governments have assumed two types of Þ scal risk. The 
Þ rst source is represented by contingent liabilities. These have increased substantially since the onset 
of the Þ nancial crisis, and the eventuality that further guarantees are required and/or that some 
guarantees are called in the future cannot be ruled out. As shown in the chart, by the end of 2009 
the implicit contingent liabilities, as measured by the resources committed to guarantee schemes 
(excluding government guarantees on retail deposits), amounted to 20.1% of GDP for euro area 
governments, whereas the explicit contingent liabilities, as measured by the guarantees that were 
actually used by the banks, amounted to around 9.4% of GDP. A second source of Þ scal risk concerns the effect of government support to the banking sector 
(e.g. bank recapitalisations, asset purchases and loans) on the size and composition of the government balance sheet.4 In principle, these interventions represent acquisitions of Þ nancial assets with no effect on a government™s net debt. However, possible valuation changes, as well 
as uncertainty concerning the actual proceeds from the future sale of these assets, could have an 
impact on Þ scal solvency.

2009Finally, the Þ scal costs of supporting the banking sector are partially offset by dividends, interest 
payments and fees paid by banks to governments in exchange for Þ nancial support.
To conclude, an assessment of the net Þ scal costs of government support to the banking sector 
should take a long-term perspective, which goes beyond the year in which such support was effectively provided, and should consider the broader implications of such support for the 
government balance sheet. Reß ecting these increasing risks to 
Þ scal sustainability, the widening in euro area 
sovereign yield spreads, which had intensiÞ ed in autumn 2008, continued well into 2009 
(see Box 7). While a narrowing of sovereign 
bond yield spreads had been observed since 
March 2009, at the end of the year and in 
early 2010 sovereign risk spreads in some 
countries experiencing particularly adverse 
Þ scal developments diverged strongly from the 
average trend, most notably in Greece. An analysis of the factors underlying the budgetary deterioration is made particularly 
difÞ cult at the current juncture because of the 
uncertainty regarding the identiÞ cation of trend 
growth and the output gap in real time. Keeping 
this in mind, both the operation of automatic 
stabilisers and the expansionary Þ scal stance 
adopted in the euro area countries are assessed 
to have had a sizeable negative impact on the 
budget balance. In further detail, the economic downturn has 
caused a reduction in tax bases and an expansion 
in social beneÞ ts and transfer payments. In 
addition, revenue shortfalls beyond what could 
be expected on the basis of the estimated 
elasticities have put upward pressure on deÞ cits. A large part of the deterioration reß ects tax cuts 
and other Þ scal stimulus measures implemented 
in many euro area countries, as well as a 
structural expenditure growth rate above that 
of trend GDP. The European Commission 
estimated that discretionary measures 
implemented in 2009 amounted to 1.3% of GDP, 
mostly reß ecting the 
Þ scal stimulus packages 
adopted in line with the European Economic 
Recovery Plan of end-2008. Notwithstanding 
uncertainty about the share of cyclical and 
structural effects on Þ scal developments, all 
euro area countries face considerable Þ scal consolidation needs to ensure the sustainability 
of public Þ nances. Box 7DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ISSUANCE AND YIELD SPREADS OF EURO AREA GOVERNMENT DEBT 

SECURITIESThe annual growth rate of the outstanding amount of euro area general government debt securities 
was 11.3% in 2009. This was somewhat higher than the already elevated growth rate of 8.1% 
in 2008 (see Table A) and the highest over the last decade.1 Such growth reß ected the signi
Þ cant Þ scal imbalances in 2009 in most euro area countries. Together with the strongly negative 
growth in real GDP observed in 2009, new issuance contributed to a marked deterioration in 
the government debt-to-GDP ratio for the euro area, which rose from 69.3% in 2008 to 78.2% 
in 2009. 1 Growth rates are calculated on the basis of 
Þ nancial transactions and therefore exclude reclassi
Þ cations, revaluations, exchange 
rate variations and other changes that do not arise from transactions. For details, see the technical notes relating to Sections 4.3 and 
4.4 of the ﬁEuro area statisticsﬂ section of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.77ECBAnnual Report
2009With regard to the composition of net issuance in 2009, the primary market activity of euro area short-term debt securities continued to grow strongly, albeit at a slower pace than in 2008. This 
partly reß ected the fact that the yield curve steepened further during 2009, making short-term 
Þ nancing relatively more attractive in terms of near-term interest expenditure. In addition, the 
increased reliance on short-term Þ nancing may also have re
ß ected some weakening of investor 
appetite for longer-dated government debt in the Þ rst half of the year, as well as higher risk 
spreads on long-term debt, relative to shorter-term debt, for some countries. As a result, the share 
of long-term debt declined further to 86.7% of outstanding debt securities in 2009, well below 
the average observed since the start of Stage Three of EMU (see Table B).In 2009 interest payments relative to GDP remained broadly unchanged from 2008. Chart A breaks down changes in interest payments into: i) the effect stemming from changes in 
government debt, ii) the effect resulting from changes in interest rates, and iii) a residual cross 
effect.2 Despite increasing debt, interest payments remained almost unchanged relative to GDP. 2 The change in nominal interest payments,

2009This reß ected the fact that the contribution from lower interest rates (0.3% of GDP) exceeded the 
upward contribution from the change in government debt by a small margin. The impact of the cross effect was small.The upward trend in euro area sovereign bond yield spreads, which began in early 2008, continued well into 2009 (see Chart B). In the Þ rst quarter of 2009 ten-year sovereign spreads 
vis-à-vis Germany thus reached their highest levels since the start of Monetary Union. This peak 
coincided with the trough in equity and other risky asset prices, and reß ected sharp increases in both liquidity and credit risk premia.3 As market conÞ dence gradually returned after March 2009, 
sovereign spreads of most euro area countries gradually narrowed to less than half of their peak 
levels. Some countries experienced a signiÞ cant rewidening of spreads in late 2009 and early 
2010, however. Similar developments were observed in sovereign credit default swap premia.Throughout the Þ nancial crisis there has been a strong comovement across euro area sovereign 
risk premia suggesting that, for most of the time, spreads were driven mainly by common rather than country-speciÞ c shocks, including a more realistic appreciation of risk. However, sensitivity 
to these common shocks differed markedly across countries, reß ecting primarily the strength of

2009actual and projected Þ scal positions, with countries with less sound 
Þ scal positions enduring 
higher increases in spreads. In addition, euro area governments assumed contingent liabilities as a consequence of national banking sector support measures, which also impinged on the spreads.44 For an analysis of the role of common shocks and the impact of banking sector support measures on sovereign risk exposure, 
see J. Ejsing and W. Lemke, ﬁThe Janus-headed salvation: sovereign and bank credit risk premia during 2008-09ﬂ, ECB Working Paper No 1127, December 2009. For a recent study of the factors behind the overall increase in intra-euro area sovereign yield spreads, see M.G. Attinasi, C. Checherita and C. Nickel, ﬁWhat explains the surge in euro area sovereign spreads during the Þ nancial crisis of 2007-09?ﬂ, ECB Working Paper No 1131, December 2009.LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY AND EUROPEAN 
AGREEMENTSThe budgetary risks related to the projected 
future costs of population ageing, associated 
with unfunded pension systems and health care, 
are made more acute by the current situation 
of severe Þ scal imbalances and the prospect of 
a lower trend growth rate. Correspondingly, 
Þ scal sustainability has gained centre stage in 
discussions in European fora. The Eurogroup ministers of Þ nance committed 
in June 2009 to put in place robust medium-termÞ scal strategies that would lead to a timely 
correction of excessive deÞ cits. In October 2009, 
aiming to strike a balance between stability 
and sustainability issues, the ECOFIN Council 
emphasised the need for a Þ scal exit strategy 
from the broad-based stimulus policies to 
be coordinated across countries within the 
framework of a consistent implementation of the 
Stability and Growth Pact. Beyond the timely 
withdrawal of the Þ scal stimulus measures, 
the Council stressed that ambitious Þ scal consolidation of well beyond the benchmark of 
0.5% of GDP per annum in structural terms was 
required. In November 2009 the ECOFIN Council recognised that the deterioration of public 
Þ nances triggered by the current crisis had 
added substantially to the sustainability 
challenges related to population ageing, the 
high level of public debt and lower long-term 
potential growth. Furthermore, the uncertainty 
in assessing structural budgetary positions and long-term projections owing to the current 
crisis was deemed to be greater than usual. 
The Council agreed that policy action to improve 

long-term Þ scal sustainability had to be taken 
urgently. To this end, the Council underlined the 
key importance of a determined implementation 
of the three-pronged strategy agreed at the 2001 
European Council in Stockholm. This strategy 
consists of measures geared towards reducing 
deÞ cits and debt, increasing employment 
rates and reforming social protection systems. 
The reduction of debt ratios will have to come 
from a combination of Þ scal consolidation and 
structural reforms to support potential growth. The ECOFIN Council also endorsed, in May 2009, 
the updated long-term projections of ageing-
related public expenditure. A new agreement for 
gauging the appropriateness of country-speciÞ cmedium-term budgetary objectives was 
introduced. As called for in the 2005 revised 
Code of Conduct on the implementation 
of the Stability and Growth Pact, the new 
methodology will take into account not just debt 
levels but also implicit government liabilities 
stemming from population ageing. According 
to this agreement, medium-term budgetary 
objectives should ensure a stabilisation of the 
government debt ratio in the long run at the 
60% of GDP reference value as a minimum, 
with a supplementary debt-reduction effort for 
countries with a debt ratio in excess of 60% of 
GDP and a partial frontloading of the budgetary 
costs of ageing. The updated Code of Conduct 
was applied as from the 2009-10 update of 
stability programmes. 80ECBAnnual Report
2009In February 2010, in its statement on Greece, the European Council recalled that all euro area 
members must conduct sound national policies 
in line with the agreed rules and that they have 
a shared responsibility for the economic and 
Þ nancial stability of the area. The statement 
also mentioned that euro area Member States 
will take determined and coordinated action, 
if needed, to safeguard Þ nancial stability in the 
euro area as a whole.FURTHER FISCAL DETERIORATION EXPECTED 

IN 2010 
In 2010 the Þ scal situation in the euro area is 
expected to deteriorate further. According 
to the European Commission autumn 2009 
forecasts, the average general government 
deÞ cit ratio in the euro area will increase 
further by 0.5 percentage point to 6.9% of GDP 
(see Chart 36). The euro area average revenue 
ratio is projected to decrease by 0.3 percentage 
point of GDP, whereas the primary expenditure 
ratio will remain broadly stable and the 
euro area average interest expenditure ratio 
will rise by 0.2 percentage point of GDP. 
All euro area countries are expected to breach 
the 3% of GDP reference value in 2010. 
The average government debt ratio in the euro 
area is projected to continue to rise in 2010, by 5.8 percentage points, to 84.0% of GDP. 
The weakening of budgetary positions will 
result from a moderately expansionary Þ scal stance, while the additional effects of automatic 
stabilisers will be negligible. FOCUS ON FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY ESSENTIALMany euro area governments are faced with 
high and sharply rising Þ scal imbalances, which 
may place an additional burden on the single 
monetary policy in maintaining price stability. 
The pressures on Þ scal sustainability arising 
from the current Þ nancial and economic 
environment are exacerbated by the projected 
Þ scal burden of population ageing, stemming 
from unfunded old age pension systems and 
healthcare costs. Moreover, the very large 
government borrowing requirements carry 
the risk of triggering rapid changes in market 
sentiment, leading to less favourable medium 
and long-term interest rates. This in turn would 
dampen private investment and thereby weaken 
the foundations for sustained growth.In the course of 2009, on several occasions the Governing Council of the ECB emphasised 
that a main challenge for policy-makers 
was to maintain public conÞ dence in the 
sustainability of public Þ nances and in the 
EU Þ scal framework. The announcement and 
the determined implementation of timely and 
ambitious Þ scal exit and consolidation strategies, 
based on realistic growth assumptions, will 
contribute to supporting public conÞ dence in 
Þ scal sustainability and the economic recovery. 
The consolidation effort will necessarily have 
to focus on the expenditure side. The inelastic 
reaction of expenditure plans to a much lower 
than expected level and growth rate of potential 
output has caused an increase in the government 
expenditure-to-GDP ratio. Higher interest 
expenditure reß ecting higher debt levels and 
higher effective interest rates is likely to put 
additional pressure on the spending side of 
the budget in many countries. By contrast,

2009recovery of economic growth potential. In this context, increasing the efÞ ciency and 
effectiveness of public Þ nances is highly 
desirable and should contribute to fostering 
potential output growth and debt reduction. The success of Þ scal adjustment strategies 
will also depend, crucially, on appropriate national budgetary rules and institutions and 
requires transparent budgetary procedures. 
An important dimension to conÞ dence in the 
soundness of public institutions is furthermore 
the reliability and completeness of government 
Þ nance statistics. The timely reporting of sound statistical information is vital for the proper 
implementation of the EU Þ scal surveillance 
framework. 2.6 EXCHANGE RATES AND BALANCE 
OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS 
THE EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE EURO 

EXPERIENCED SOME FLUCTUATION DURING 

THE YEARExchange rate developments in 2009 were 
to a large extent shaped by the evolution of 
global Þ nancial conditions and the prospects 
for economic recovery around the world. 
Tensions in global Þ nancial markets and very 
high uncertainty regarding the economic 
outlook prevailing in early 2009 resulted in 
an unwinding of carry trades (i.e. trades that 
consist of borrowing in a low-yielding currency 
and investing in a high-yielding currency) 
and global portfolio shifts, contributing to some 
large swings in the main bilateral exchange 
rates (see Chart 37). These factors, together 
with decreasing monetary policy rates and a 
more unfavourable outlook for growth in the 
euro area and the EU as a whole, contributed to 
a weakening of the euro, which Œ as measured 
against the currencies of 21 of the euro area™s 
important trading partners Œ depreciated 
by over 3% in effective terms in the Þ rst two months of 2009. After some volatility 
in March and April, the euro started to rise in 
May 2009 amid improving Þ nancial market 
conditions, as reß ected by gradually subsiding 
Þ nancial market spreads and decreasing implied 
volatilities (see Chart 37). After strengthening 
by almost 5% in effective terms by the end 
of October 2009, the euro stood close to the Chart 37 Patterns in exchange rates

2009historical peaks recorded at the end of 2008. This appreciation resulted primarily from the 
strengthening of the euro against the US dollar 
and major Asian currencies linked to the US 
currency. Subsequently, the euro stabilised, 
before depreciating somewhat in effective terms 
in December. Overall, the euro weakened in 2009. This reß ected a depreciation against the pound 
sterling, which was partly offset by a 
strengthening vis-à-vis the US dollar, major 
Asian currencies linked to the US dollar and the 
Japanese yen. On 31 December 2009 the euro 
stood in nominal effective terms Œ as measured 
against the currencies of 21 important trading 
partners Œ 1% lower than at the beginning of 
the year and about 1.2% above its average level 
in 2008 (see Chart 38).Against the US dollar, the euro initially depreciated by around 9% in the Þ rst two 
months of 2009 amid portfolio ß ows into 
some segments of the US market against 
the background of a decreasing transatlantic 
interest rate differential. After March 2009, as the tensions in the Þ nancial markets started 
to ease gradually, the euro rebounded against 
the US currency. At the same time, the 
re-emergence of carry trades, which may have 
been supported by the moderation of implied 
volatilities (see Chart 37), also appears to have 
contributed to the weakening of the US dollar. 
Between early March and the end of October the euro appreciated by almost 19%. In December 
the US dollar strengthened against the major 
currencies, rising against the euro by around 
4%. On 31 December 2009 the euro traded at 
USD/EUR 1.44, around 3.5% higher than at the 

beginning of 2009 and about 2% weaker than 

its 2008 average. 
Following a similar pattern to the EUR/USD exchange rate, in the Þ rst two months of 2009 
the euro depreciated against the Japanese 
yen (see Chart 37). In March and April, when 
economic activity in Japan was reported to 
have deteriorated more than initially expected 
and Þ nancial market tensions started to 
ease, the euro rebounded. Throughout 
the remainder of 2009 the euro ß uctuated within a range from JPY 128 to JPY 138. 
On 31 December 2009 the euro traded at 
JPY 133.16, around 5.6% higher than at the 
beginning of the year but around 12.5% lower 
than its average for 2008.After reaching an all-time high vis-à-vis 
the pound sterling in December 2008, the 

euro depreciated in 2009 by around 7%, 

amid considerable volatility. The euro also 

experienced sizeable ß uctuations against 
the currencies of several other EU trading 

partners, while remaining broadly unchanged 

vis-à-vis the ERM II currencies (for details 

on the currencies mentioned in this paragraph 

see Section 3 of Chapter 1). 
The euro remained broadly unchanged against the Swiss franc in 2009, experiencing increased 
volatility in the Þ rst three months of 2009 
and subsequently stabilising amid reports of 
foreign exchange interventions by the Swiss 
National Bank. In 2009 the euro depreciated 
strongly against the currencies of many Chart 38 Euro nominal and real effective

2009advanced economies with positive interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the euro area. Thus, 
between early January and 31 December 2009, 
the euro weakened against the Canadian dollar 
(-11%), the Australian dollar (-21%) and the 
Norwegian krone (-14.9%). The appreciation of 
the euro against Asian currencies linked to the 
US dollar, namely the Chinese renminbi and 
the Hong Kong dollar (both 3.6%), was largely 
offset in effective terms by its depreciation 
vis-à-vis the Korean won (-9.4%). The real effective exchange rate of the euro based on different cost and price measures 
declined in early 2009 and started to increase 
thereafter. Towards the end of 2009 it reached 
levels close to, or above, the historical heights 
recorded in the previous year, before falling 
slightly in December. The real effective CPI-
deß ated exchange rate was, on average, slightly stronger in 2009 than in 2008 (see Chart 38).CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT DECREASED 

SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2009 
In 2009 the current account of the euro area 
recorded a deÞ cit of •59.0 billion (or 0.7% 
of euro area GDP), compared with a deÞ cit of •140.6 billion in 2008. This fall in the 
deÞ cit largely resulted from a decrease in the 
deÞ cit in the income balance (of •40.9 billion) 
and improvements in the goods balance 
(see Chart 39). Following the sharp contraction 
in euro area goods trade towards the end 
of 2008 and in early 2009, goods exports 
stabilised and rebounded faster than goods 
imports, shifting the goods balance back into 
a surplus of •34.7 billion in 2009, compared 
with a deÞ cit of •9.5 billion in 2008. A lower 
deÞ cit in current transfers also contributed to the 
overall narrowing of the current account deÞ cit in 2009. These changes were only partly offset 
by a decrease (of •10.4 billion) in the surplus 
in services.The stabilisation and gradual recovery of goods exports in the course of 2009 was supported 
by a pick-up in foreign demand and a gradual 
reactivation of international supply chains, as 
economic activity bottomed out in major export markets and Þ rms started replenishing their 
inventories in the light of the improved 
economic outlook. In contrast to the 
synchronised downturn in trade around the 
turn of the year, export developments in 2009 
were markedly less uniform across destinations. 
While exports to Asia and the United Kingdom 
rebounded, exports to the OPEC countries and 
the United States continued to decline until 
October 2009 (see Chart 40). Meanwhile, 
the broad-based appreciation of the euro and 
the associated negative impact on euro area 
export price competitiveness from March to 
October 2009 dampened somewhat the response 
of exports to the recovery in foreign demand.Developments in euro area goods imports 
in 2009 lagged behind those observed for 

exports. Import volumes continued to decline, 

albeit at a moderating pace, in the Þ rst half 
of the year and stabilised in the third quarter 

of 2009, reß ecting the weakness in euro area 
domestic demand and destocking activities 

by euro area Þ rms over this period. Declining 
import prices also contributed to the decrease 

in import values in the Þ rst half of the year.

2009The lower import prices were partly due to the fall 
in oil prices that began in the summer of 2008, 

contributing to a decline to •126.6 billion in the 

oil trade deÞ cit in the 12-month cumulated period 
up to November 2009, well below the very high 

level of more than •220 billion recorded at the 

end of 2008. Amid rebounding oil prices, energy 

import prices supported the stabilisation in import 

values in the second half of the year. 
NET INFLOWS IN COMBINED DIRECT AND 

PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT INCREASED IN 2009In the Þ nancial account, the euro area 
experienced net inß ows of •251.2 billion in 
combined direct and portfolio investment 

in 2009, compared with net inß ows of 
•161.5 billion a year earlier. This increase 

reß ected a shift from net out
ß ows to net 
inß ows in equity portfolio investment 
(a change of •80.5 billion) and a decrease 

in net outß ows in foreign direct investment 
(of •98.1 billion). These developments were 
partly offset by lower net inß ows in debt 
instruments (of •88.8 billion; see Chart 41).Following the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial 
crisis in the autumn of 2008, the euro area 
witnessed signiÞ cant changes in its 
Þ nancial 
account that subsided only gradually in the 

second half of 2009. In the Þ rst half of the 
year investors™ appetite for safe and liquid 

assets was very strong, as reß ected in high net 
inß ows in euro area money market instruments 
amounting to •311.6 billion in the 12-month 

period up to June 2009, which compares with 

net outß ows of •74.0 billion a year earlier 
(see Chart 42). In parallel, both residents 

and non-residents repatriated funds invested 

in equities and foreign bonds and notes. 

From mid-2009, however, improved Þ nancial 
market conditions, subsiding risk aversion 

and the more favourable economic outlook 

appeared to have led investors to reassess their 

asset allocation, resulting in a renewed interest

2009ECONOMIC ACTIVITY 
In 2009 output contracted in most non-euro 
area EU Member States. However, the pace of 

output decline moderated in the second half of 

2009 following a sharp fall in economic 

growth at the end of 2008 and a further 

deterioration in economic performance in the 

Þ rst half of 2009 (see Table 7).
5 While the 
general pattern of annual GDP growth was 

common to almost all of the countries, the 

severity of the economic slump and the 

strength of the subsequent gradual 

improvement varied considerably across 

individual countries, reß ecting, in part, 
differences in initial cyclical positions, the 

openness of the economy, trade structure and 

external Þ nancing requirements.
The Baltic States experienced the most 
pronounced decline in economic activity, with 
a double-digit contraction in average annual 
growth, following negative growth already 
observed in 2008 in the case of Estonia and 
Latvia. The sharp slowdown reß ects, to a 
large extent, the correction of signiÞ cant macroeconomic imbalances built up before 
the global Þ nancial crisis, which increased the 
vulnerability of these countries to the effects of 
the global downturn.In all non-euro area EU Member States, except 
the Baltic States, the decline in economic 
activity was very much driven by the collapse 
in foreign demand and tighter external Þ nancing conditions. Furthermore, the decline in consumer 
conÞ dence and, in some cases, the negative 
wealth effects from falling asset prices resulted 
in a noticeable worsening of domestic demand 
in most countries. These factors moderated 
somewhat later in the year as a result of the 
gradual improvement in external demand and 
global Þ nancial markets and, in some countries 
with ß exible exchange rates, as a result of the 
beneÞ ts deriving from their weaker currencies.
Poland was the only country to record positive 

economic growth (of 1.7%) in 2009, which may 

have partly reß ected the lower degree of openness 
of the economy, the strength of the Þ nancial 
sector, the early depreciation of the currency, and 

the absence of large macroeconomic imbalances. 

In the three non-euro area EU Member States that 

joined the EU before 2004 (Denmark, Sweden 

and the United Kingdom), the decline in economic

2009activity was around 5%. In 2008 economic output 
was already declining in Denmark and Sweden, 

whereas the United Kingdom was still registering 

weak growth. In 2009 economic activity in 

the Czech Republic declined considerably, by 

4.2%, while the stronger decline of 6.3% in 

Hungary reß ected, in part, the policies aimed at 
macroeconomic consolidation. In Bulgaria and 

Romania, economic output declined by 5.1% 

and 7.1% respectively, after having registered the 

highest growth Þ gures among non-euro area EU 
countries in 2008.As a result of the deterioration in overall economic activity, labour market conditions 
weakened markedly in most countries in 2009, 
reß ected in developments in unemployment 
rates and compensation. While unemployment 
rates increased in all countries, the increase was 
particularly pronounced in the Baltic States, 
where wage growth turned negative owing to 
the considerable decline in demand and the 
need for Þ scal consolidation. 
PRICE DEVELOPMENTSAverage annual inß ation decreased in 2009 in 
all non-euro area EU Member States. However, 
the cross-country variation in annual inß ation 
rates remains signiÞ cant (see Table 8). The 
highest average inß ation rates in 2009 were 
recorded in Romania and Lithuania, with 5.6% 

and 4.2% respectively, followed by Hungary, 

Poland and Latvia, where average annual 

HICP inß ation ranged from 4.0% to 3.3%. 
In Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, Sweden, 

Denmark and the Czech Republic, inß ation 
was between 2.5% and 0.6%. Finally, Estonia 

experienced an annual HICP inß ation rate 
of  0.2%. 
Most of the factors behind the decline in 
inß ation were common to the non-euro 
area EU Member States and related to base 

effects linked to lower commodity prices and 

subdued domestic demand. As labour market 

conditions weakened in many countries, 

decelerating or even negative nominal wage 

growth contributed to the signiÞ cant decline in 
inß ation rates. Increasing annual in
ß ation rates 
in Hungary and Poland in the Þ rst three quarters 
of 2009 were driven by recent VAT increases 

and higher administered prices respectively, as 

well as by currency depreciations in late 2008
and early 2009.Table 8 HICP inflation in the non-euro area EU Member States and the euro area(annual percentage changes)200520062007200820092009

2009FISCAL POLICIESAccording to the European Commission™s autumn 2009 forecast, all non-euro area EU 
Member States, apart from Bulgaria, Denmark, 
Estonia and Sweden, are estimated to have 
posted deÞ cits above the 3% of GDP reference 
value in 2009. The United Kingdom is estimated 
to have recorded a very large deÞ cit of 12.1% of 
GDP, followed by Lithuania (9.8% of GDP) and 
Latvia (9% of GDP). Overall, in the majority of 
non-euro area EU Member States, the Þ scal situation deteriorated strongly, reß ecting signiÞ cantly worsening macroeconomic 
conditions. As a consequence, budgetary 
outcomes for 2009 generally failed to meet the 
targets contained in the updated convergence

2009Þ nancial support from, inter alia, the EU and the 
IMF Œ the related adjustment programmes called for strict Þ scal consolidation. Bulgaria, Estonia 
and Lithuania implemented comprehensive 
consolidation measures aiming to contain the 
rapid budgetary deterioration. By contrast, in 
the Czech Republic and Poland, Þ scal policy 
was not tightened and automatic stabilisers were 
allowed to operate, although in Poland the Þ scal impact of allowing the automatic stabilisers 
to operate was partly offset by spending cuts, 
while in the Czech Republic the loose Þ scal policy was also a result of government stimulus 
measures. Finally, in Denmark, Sweden and 
the United Kingdom, signiÞ cant Þ scal stimulus 
packages were implemented in 2009.At the end of 2009 all of the non-euro area EU Member States, apart from Bulgaria, Denmark, 
Estonia and Sweden, were the subject of an 
EU Council decision on the existence of an 
excessive deÞ cit. Deadlines for correcting the 
excessive deÞ cit situation were set at 2011 for 
Hungary, 2012 for Latvia, Lithuania, Poland 
and Romania, 2013 for the Czech Republic and 
2014 to 2015 for the United Kingdom.Government debt-to-GDP ratios are estimated to have increased in all non-euro area EU 
Member States. According to the European 
Commission™s autumn 2009 forecast, the rise in 
the debt-to-GDP ratio was strongest in the United 
Kingdom (+16.6 percentage points), Lithuania 
(+14.3 percentage points) and Latvia 
(+13.7 percentage points), reß ecting their 
large budget deÞ cits as well as Œ for the 
United Kingdom and Latvia Œ Þ nancial transactions in support of the domestic banking 
sector. While the debt ratio remained above the 
60% of GDP reference value in Hungary and 
exceeded this level in the United Kingdom, it 
remained below 60% in the other non-euro area 
EU Member States.Overall, the general picture of developments in budget balances and general government gross 
debt in 2009 was broadly conÞ rmed in the recent 
updates of the convergence programmes, which were submitted by the non-euro area EU Member 
States in January and February 2010.BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS 
In 2009 the combined current and capital 
account deÞ cits of the non-euro area 
EU Member States narrowed. In particular, in 
all countries that joined the EU in 2004 or later, 
the current account deÞ cits declined (both in 
nominal terms and as a percentage of GDP). 
In several countries, the contraction was very 
sharp and the current accounts shifted from a 
deÞ cit to a surplus position (see Table 10). 
This was a result of sharply contracting 
domestic demand and lower capital inß ows in 
the region as a result of the intensiÞ cation of 
the global Þ nancial crisis. Accordingly, the 
adjustment was particularly pronounced in the 
countries with the highest deÞ cits prior to the 
crisis Œ namely the Baltic States, Bulgaria and 
Romania Œ and turned the combined current 
and capital accounts of the Baltic States from 
very large deÞ cits into surpluses. Hungary also 
experienced a sharp reversal in its combined 
current and capital account, moving from a 
deÞ cit of 6% of GDP in 2008 to a surplus 
position in 2009. The countries which entered 
the crisis with lower external deÞ cits, i.e. the 
United Kingdom, the Czech Republic and 
Poland, witnessed a narrowing of their deÞ cits, the latter two registering a small surplus. 
Denmark and Sweden recorded a rise in their 
surplus positions. These sharp adjustments in external deÞ cits were accompanied by a tightening of Þ nancing conditions and some major changes in Þ nancing patterns. Net ﬁother investmentﬂ 
ß ows reversed in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria,  
Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden, and declined 
in Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Romania. 
In some countries, such as Hungary, Latvia and 
Romania, the reduction in private credit ß ows was partly offset by international and European 
Þ nancial support programmes. In comparison 
with 2008, foreign direct investment inß ows were further scaled down in central and eastern 
European countries that joined the EU in 2004 90ECBAnnual Report
2009or later Œ although Bulgaria continued receiving net inß ows of above 10% of GDP Œ while 
Denmark and the United Kingdom continued 
to be net exporters of foreign direct investment. 
Developments in net portfolio investment 
ß ows were fairly heterogeneous: Denmark, 
Sweden and the United Kingdom received very 
substantial inß ows, while Bulgaria, Estonia and 
Hungary recorded an outß ow. More speci
Þ cally, the United Kingdom continued to record some 
large movements in the Þ nancial account, a 
phenomenon that largely reß ected the global 
reallocation of investors™ portfolios during the 
Þ nancial crisis.
EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTSExchange rate developments in the non-euro 
area EU Member States in 2009 were strongly 
inß uenced by the exchange rate regimes of the 
individual countries. The currencies of Denmark, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania participated in ERM II. They 
maintained a standard ß uctuation band of ±15% 
around their central rates against the euro, except 
for the Danish krone, with a narrower band of 
±2.25% (see Chart 43). ERM II participation Chart 43 Developments in ERM II EU

91ECBAnnual Report
2009is, in some cases, accompanied by unilateral commitments on the part of the countries 
concerned to maintain narrower ß uctuation bands. These unilateral commitments place no 
additional obligations on the ECB. In particular, 
the Estonian kroon and the Lithuanian litas 
joined ERM II with their existing currency board 
arrangements in place. The Latvian authorities 
decided to maintain the exchange rate of the 
lats at its central rate against the euro with a 
ß uctuation band of ±1%. The agreements on 
participation for the countries whose currencies 
joined ERM II in 2004 or later (i.e Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania) were also all based on a 
number of policy commitments by the respective 
authorities, relating, inter alia, to the pursuit of 
sound Þ scal policies, the promotion of wage 
moderation and wage developments in line 
with productivity growth, the pursuit of prudent 
credit policies, and the implementation of further 
structural reforms. The Latvian lats ß uctuated within the 
unilaterally set band of ±1% vis-à-vis the 
euro. This volatility apparently reß ected 
investors™ changing sentiment about the 

fulÞ lment of the conditions agreed under 
international support programmes. Pressures 

on the Latvian lats eased temporarily at the 

end of July 2009, following the disbursement 

of the second instalment of the EU™s balance 

of payments assistance to Latvia. Problems 

surrounding the adoption of Þ scal measures 
by the Latvian parliament in September 2009, 

seemingly related to international assistance 

programmes, again put downward pressure on 

the lats. As a result, in September the Latvian 

lats approached the weaker side of the ±1% 

unilaterally set band.In 2009 developments took place with respect to currency swap arrangements among a 
number of NCBs. Eesti Pank entered into an 
agreement with Sveriges Riksbank, under which 
it can borrow up to SEK 10 billion against 
Estonian kroons as a preventive measure to 
safeguard Þ nancial stability in Estonia. Sveriges 
Riksbank also extended its agreement with 
Latvijas Banka Œ entered into together with Danmarks Nationalbank in December 2008 Œ 
which gives Latvijas Banka the right to 
borrow up to •500 million against Latvian lats. 
Furthermore, in June 2009 Sveriges Riksbank 
drew •3 billion on the existing line with the ECB 
in order to boost its foreign currency reserves.Turning to the currencies of the non-euro area EU Member States that did not participate 
in ERM II, two phases of exchange rate 
developments can be identiÞ ed. At the beginning 
of 2009 the Czech koruna, the Hungarian forint, 
the Polish zloty and the Romanian leu continued 
to depreciate sharply (see Chart 44). This took 
place against the background of heightened 
uncertainty in global Þ nancial markets following 
the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 
2008, the deteriorating economic outlook 
in Europe, and investors™ concerns about 
external vulnerabilities in the region, which 
may also have led to some contagion effects 
across currencies. The sharp depreciations 
reached their peak in mid-February 2009 and 
prompted the authorities in some countries 
to intervene in foreign exchange markets. Chart 44 Developments in non-ERM II EU

2009A gradual normalisation of global Þ nancial market conditions subsequently contributed to a strong reversal of the Czech, Hungarian and 
Polish currencies against the euro and ultimately 
to relatively stable exchange rates in the fourth 
quarter of 2009, although at considerably weaker 
levels compared with their 2008 average. 
The Romanian leu remained broadly unchanged 
from March 2009. Reß ecting its euro-based 
currency board arrangement, the Bulgarian lev 
remained unchanged against the euro.The Swedish krona depreciated substantially against the euro at the beginning of 2009. 
Following its all-time low vis-à-vis the euro, 
reached at the beginning of March 2009, 
improvements in investors™ perception 
concerning the Baltic States and the gradual 
normalisation of Þ nancial market conditions 
contributed to the rebound of the Swedish krona 
against the euro. However, the krona remained 
considerably weaker at the end of 2009 
compared with its average 2008 level.Following the record lows reached in December 2008, the pound sterling appreciated 
against the euro amid high volatility in 2009. The 
bilateral exchange rate dynamics continued to 
partly reß ect developments in the medium-term 
interest rate differentials, with high volatility 
stemming from uncertainty over the economic 
outlook with regard to the United Kingdom and 
the euro area.FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTSIn 2009 the long-term interest rates in the 
non-euro area EU Member States, as measured 
by ten-year government bond yields, continued 
to be affected by global market tensions, the 
downgrading of sovereign ratings, Þ nancial rescue packages and risk aversion by 
international investors. Compared with average 
euro area long-term interest rates, the interest 
rates of these countries remained, in general, at 
elevated levels.In the majority of the non-euro area EU Member States, government bond yields rose from 
their end-2008 level, although a few countries witnessed a decline. The increase in the 
long-term interest rate was most pronounced in 
Latvia, as deteriorating economic growth and the 
subsequent lowering of credit ratings weakened 
investor sentiment and dampened foreign 
investors™ demand for government bonds. In 
addition, bond markets in Latvia, Lithuania and 
Romania were almost illiquid owing to, among 
other things, investors™ continued cautiousness. 
At the other end of the spectrum, the long-
term bond yields for Bulgaria and Hungary 
decreased.The negative market sentiment also had an impact on other Þ nancial instruments of 
non-euro area EU Member States at the 
beginning of 2009. Credit default swap (CDS) 
spreads for government bonds peaked and stock 
markets reached a low in March 2009. Thereafter, 
strong policy actions and signs of economic 
recovery in major markets supported global 
money market functioning and led to improved 
market sentiment. The favourable developments 
reversed the trend in non-euro area EU Member 
States™ CDS spreads, money market rates and 
stock markets. CDS spreads decreased but were 
still at higher levels in December 2009 than 
before the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial crisis 
in 2008. Money market rates declined in all 
non-euro area EU Member States, although 
spreads between the money market rates and the 
three-month EURIBOR remained positive. Stock 
market indices increased, on average, by 37% 
between December 2008 and December 2009, 
outperforming the euro area stock index.MONETARY POLICYThe primary objective for monetary policy in 
all non-euro area EU Member States is price 
stability. Monetary policy strategies, however, 
continued to differ considerably from country to 
country (see Table 11). The key monetary policy challenge was in relation to the sharp economic slowdown 
following the intensiÞ cation of the global 
Þ nancial turmoil, and the associated 
consequences for the inß ation outlook. In 
addition, most countries experienced liquidity 93ECBAnnual Report
2009constraints in their interbank and government bond markets, as well as tensions in their 
foreign exchange markets. As a consequence, 
the monetary policy transmission mechanism 
was affected in a number of countries. The 
respective NCB responses to these challenges 
varied depending on the economic conditions 
and the monetary policy frameworks in place.With regard to monetary policy decisions 
between January 2009 and December 2009, 

most central banks participating in ERM II 

adopted monetary policy measures which 
often mirrored moves by the ECB. In the Þ rst 
half of 2009, the ECB cut the Þ xed rate on the 
main reÞ nancing operations of the Eurosystem 
by a total of 150 basis points (in four steps 

in January, March, April and May) and since 

then has kept it unchanged at 1%.Given their currency board arrangements, 
   (Bulgarian National 
Bank), Eesti Pank and Lietuvos bankas have no 

ofÞ cial policy rates; they automatically adjust 
to the rates set by the ECB. However, in order 

to ease liquidity pressures in the interbank

2009markets,    (Bulgarian 
National Bank) lowered its minimum reserve 
requirements.Turning to the ERM II countries that are not operating under a currency board arrangement, 
Latvijas Banka, which maintains a ±1% 
ß uctuation band around the central rate as a 
unilateral commitment, lowered its main interest 
rate to 4% in two steps of 100 basis points 
each, the Þ rst in March 2009 and the second in 
May 2009. Danmarks Nationalbank continued 
the easing cycle begun in November 2008
by lowering its main policy interest rate 
in nine further steps in 2009, by a total of 
255 basis points. Following interest rate cuts 
of 175 basis points in total in the last two 
months of 2008, Danmarks Nationalbank 
twice cut its key policy interest rate by 75 
basis points, in January and March 2009, 
followed by a series of smaller cuts between 
April 2009 and January 2010, bringing the 
main policy rate down to 1.05%. While some 
of the decisions followed similar moves by 
the ECB, others were taken when the ECB™s 
interest rates remained unchanged, leading to 
a reduction in the spread of policy rates vis-à-
vis the euro area. Danmarks Nationalbank also 
intervened in the foreign exchange market, 
replenishing the ofÞ cial currency reserves 
after the period of tension in the exchange rate 
markets and associated losses of reserves in 
late 2008.All of the NCBs with inß ation targets that are not 
participating in ERM II reacted to the increased impact of the Þ nancial crisis and the resulting 
rapid easing of inß ationary pressures against the 
background of strongly negative output gaps by 
lowering interest rates in 2009. Actual inß ation was below the respective inß ation targets in the 
Czech Republic and Sweden, while in Hungary, 
Poland and Romania, it remained above. 
The size of the interest rate cuts depended on 
initial conditions such as inß ation rates and 
perceived risk premia. In the course of 2009 
eská národní banka cut its policy rate in four 
steps, by a total of 125 basis points, to 1%, 
while Narodowy Bank Polski and the Bank of England both lowered their interest rates by 
150 basis points, in several steps, to 3.5% and 
0.5% respectively. Narodowy Bank Polski 
decided on an early redemption of NBP bonds in 
January 2009 and lowered the required reserve 
rate in May 2009. In March 2009 the Bank of 
England introduced the Asset Purchase Facility 
authorising the purchase of private sector 
assets and gilts, and extended it three times 
(in May, August and November) up to a total 
of GBP 200 billion. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank 
and Banca Naional a României continued the policy easing by lowering their policy 
interest rates in a series of steps in the second 
half of 2009 and the beginning of 2010, by a 
total of 375 and 200 basis points respectively. 
These two NCBs maintained the highest policy 
rates in the EU in February 2010, at 5.75% and 
7% respectively. Banca Naional a României also cut the minimum reserve requirement 
for certain liabilities of credit institutions. 
Sveriges Riksbank cut interest rates by 
175 basis points in 2009, bringing its policy 
rate to 0.25%. Furthermore, Sveriges Riksbank 
offered loans to commercial banks amounting 
to SEK 300 billion at a Þ xed interest rate and 
with a maturity of around 12 months (in three 
steps in July, September and October 2009), 
with a view to lowering interest rates on loans 
for households  and companies. The new ECB premises: simulated view of the atrium between the two ofÞ ce towers.
CHAPTER 2CENTRAL BANK 
OPERATIONSAND ACTIVITIES98ECBAnnual Report
20091.1 OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 
AND STANDING FACILITIES 
The monetary policy instruments used by the Eurosystem in 2009 comprise open 
market operations, such as main reÞ nancing operations (MROs), longer-term reÞ nancing operations (LTROs), Þ ne-tuning operations 
and the covered bond purchase programme, 
as well as standing facilities and the minimum 
reserve requirements. Within the operational 
framework for the implementation of monetary 
policy, open market operations and standing 
facilities are normally used to manage liquidity 
conditions in the interbank money market with 
a view to steering very short-term interest rates 
close to the ECB™s key policy rate. The covered 
bond purchase programme is a temporary, 
non-standard measure.During 2009 the Governing Council changed the key ECB interest rates on four occasions 
(see Chart 45). On 15 January the Governing 
Council decided to decrease the interest rate on 
the MROs by 50 basis points to 2.00%, followed 
by further cuts on 5 March, to 1.50%, and on 
2 April, to 1.25%. In line with the decision taken 
by the Governing Council on 18 December 
2008 to restore to 200 basis points the width 
of the corridor around the MRO interest rate 
formed by the rates on the standing facilities, 
these decisions meant that the interest rate on 
the marginal lending facility was set at 3.00%, 
2.50% and 2.25% respectively, and the interest 
rate on the deposit facility was set at 1.00%, 
0.50% and 0.25% respectively. On 7 May 2009 
the Governing Council decided to decrease the 
interest rate on the MROs to 1.00%, to lower the 
interest rate on the marginal lending facility to 
1.75% and to keep the interest rate on the deposit 
facility at 0.25%. The width of the corridor was 
thus reduced by 50 basis points, to 150 basis 
points, with effect from 13 May 2009. The implementation of monetary policy during 
2009 continued to be driven by the Eurosystem™s 

efforts to address the tensions in the money 

markets related to the Þ nancial turmoil. As well 
as conducting all reÞ nancing operations with full 
allotment, the Eurosystem further extended the 

average maturity of open market operations by 

introducing LTROs with a maturity of one year. 

These measures aimed to ensure the continued 

access of solvent banks to liquidity, against 

adequate collateral, thus helping to improve the 

impaired functioning of the money market. 
LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF THE BANKING SYSTEM 
When supplying liquidity through open 
market operations, the Eurosystem takes into 
account a daily assessment of the liquidity 
needs of the consolidated euro area banking 
system. These liquidity needs are determined 
by the sum of minimum reserve requirements, 
funds held in excess of these requirements on 
credit institutions™ current accounts with the 
Eurosystem (excess reserves) and autonomous 
factors. Autonomous factors are those items 
on the Eurosystem™s balance sheet, such as 
banknotes in circulation and government 
deposits, which have an impact on credit 
institutions™ current account holdings but are 
not under the direct control of the Eurosystem™s 
liquidity management.1 MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS, FOREIGN

2009All of the Eurosystem™s reÞ nancing operations 
in 2009 were conducted as full allotment procedures. As a consequence, the outstanding 
volume of reÞ nancing operations was driven not 
by the supply considerations of the Eurosystem, 
but rather by demand from counterparties, 
reß ecting their underlying liquidity preferences. 
The volumes allotted in the reÞ nancing operations in fact signiÞ cantly exceeded the 
liquidity needs of the consolidated euro area 
banking system as deÞ ned above. The overall 
level of excess reserves remained, however, 
very low in 2009, standing on average at 
•1.05 billion, which was in line with the 
experience of previous years (•1.07 billion in 
2008 and •0.9 billion in 2007).During 2009 the euro area banking system continued to borrow an aggregate surplus 
of liquidity and to deposit it back with the 
Eurosystem, paying the Þ xed rate on the 
MROs and receiving the rate on the deposit 
facility (which implied a spread of 100 basis 
points before 13 May 2009 and 75 basis points 
thereafter). This can be interpreted as clear 
evidence of counterparties™ precautionary demand for liquidity from the Eurosystem. 
Looking at developments from this 
perspective, the ﬁpremiumﬂ for this liquidity 
insurance can be said to have decreased after 
13 May, which may have contributed to 
sustaining and even increasing demand in the 
reÞ nancing operations of the Eurosystem. 
In 2009 the average daily liquidity needs of 
the euro area banking system amounted to 
•577 billion, 20% higher than in 2008. The 
main reason for the increase was the growth in 
autonomous factors, by 39%, to •380 billion. 
Minimum reserve requirements remained 
broadly unchanged on average in 2009, at 
•216 billion, compared with •210 billion in 
2008 (see Chart 46). The growth in demand 
for banknotes decelerated signiÞ cantly in 2009 
(see Chart 53 in Section 3 of this chapter).MINIMUM RESERVE SYSTEM 
Credit institutions in the euro area are required 
to hold minimum reserves on current accounts 
with the Eurosystem. As has been the case 
since 1999, the minimum reserve requirements 
were equal to 2% of credit institutions™ reserve 
base in 2009 and amounted to •216 billion 
on average, only 3% higher than the 2008 
average. Since for any maintenance period 
the Eurosystem remunerates reserve holdings 
at a rate which is the average of the marginal 
rates of the MROs over the maintenance period 
(if conducted as variable rate tenders) or at the 
Þ xed MRO rate (in the case of 
Þ xed rate tenders), 
the minimum reserve system does not impose 
signiÞ cant costs on the banking sector. At the 
same time, it fulÞ ls two important functions 
in the operational framework for monetary 
policy implementation. First, it contributes to 
the stability of short-term money market rates, 
because the reserve requirements have to be 
fulÞ lled only on average over the maintenance 
period, allowing credit institutions to smooth out 
temporary and unexpected liquidity inß ows and outß ows. Second, it enlarges the liquidity de
Þ cit of the banking system, i.e. banks™ overall need 
for reÞ nancing from the Eurosystem, thereby 
ensuring a smooth and predictable demand 
for reÞ nancing from the Eurosystem which

2009facilitates the steering of short-term money market rates by the Eurosystem.OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 
The Eurosystem uses MROs, LTROs 
and Þ ne-tuning operations to manage the 
liquidity situation in the money market. All 
liquidity-providing operations have to be fully 
collateralised. MROs are regular operations with 
a weekly frequency and normally have a maturity 
of one week. They are the main instrument for 
signalling the ECB™s monetary policy stance. 
Regular LTROs are monthly liquidity-providing 
operations with a three-month maturity. A 
number of additional operations that were 
introduced in previous years continued to be 
used in 2009: supplementary LTROs with three-
month and six-month maturities, and special-
term reÞ nancing operations, with a maturity 
equal to the length of the maintenance period. 
On 7 May 2009 the Governing Council decided 
that three liquidity-providing LTROs with a 
maturity of one year would be conducted. The 
Þ rst two operations (settled on 25 June and 
1 October) were conducted as Þ xed rate tender 
procedures with full allotment and a zero spread 
over the rate on the MROs. The rate in the last 
operation (settled on 17 December) was Þ xed at 
the average minimum bid rate/Þ xed rate on the 
MROs over the life of the operation (a maturity 
of 371 days).In 2009 all 52 MROs were conducted as Þ xed rate tenders in which all bids were satisÞ ed. The number of eligible counterparties increased to 2,157, from 2,099 in 2008. On average, 
401 counterparties participated in the MROs in 
2009, compared with 443 in 2008. Before the 
settlement of the Þ rst LTRO with a one-year 
maturity, the average volume allotted in the 
MROs was •236 billion (see Chart 47), with 
a high number of counterparties (558 bidders 
on average). The MRO that was settled on 
24 June, immediately before the allotment 
of the Þ rst one-year LTRO, saw a signi
Þ cant decline in the volume allotted, to •168 billion. 
This marked the beginning of a declining trend 
in both participation rates and MRO volumes, 
which continued throughout the second half of the year. In 2009 the lowest number of 
counterparties (109) to participate in an MRO 
was recorded in the operation that was settled 
on 23 December, and the lowest MRO volume 
(•46 billion) was allotted in the operation that 
was settled on 4 November.During the Þ rst half of the year the outstanding 
volume of liquidity allotted in the LTROs, supplementary LTROs and special-term 
reÞ nancing operations declined steadily, from 
•617 billion on 1 January to •309 billion 
on 24 June (see Chart 47). This decline was 
accompanied by a parallel, gradual reduction 
in the daily recourse to the deposit facility of 
the Eurosystem. After the settlement of the Þ rst one-year LTRO, the total outstanding volume 
of special-term reÞ nancing operations and 
LTROs more than doubled, to •729 billion. 
It remained at very high levels during the 
second half of the year (reaching •670 billion 
on 31 December). However, the total volume 
of reÞ nancing operations other than one-year 
LTROs decreased signiÞ cantly as counterparties 
lengthened the maturity of reÞ nancing from 
the Eurosystem by making greater use of the 
one-year operations. On 31 December one-year LTROs accounted for 82% of the total outstanding reÞ nancing volume, MROs for 11%, operations with a 
three-month or six-month maturity for 3% and 
4% respectively, and special-term reÞ nancing operations for 0.4%. The covered bond purchase 
programme (see Section 1.3 of this chapter) 
constituted 4% of the liquidity provision. 
On 31 December the outstanding volume of 
one-year LTROs alone (•614 billion) exceeded 
by •23 billion the aggregate liquidity needs of 
the banking system.Participation in the one-year LTROs was very high overall, but declined in the course of the 
year, with 1,121 counterparties participating in 
the Þ rst operation, 589 in the second and 224 in the third. Participation in the other operations 
also decreased signiÞ cantly throughout 2009, 
in the three-month operations from a maximum 
of 133 (on 28 January) to a minimum of 8 101ECBAnnual Report
2009(on 7 October and 7 December), and in the 
six-month operations from a maximum of 110 
(on 10 June) to a minimum of 21 (on 11 
November and 9 December). Participation in 
the special-term reÞ nancing operations also 
declined, from a maximum of 147 (on 9 June) to a 
minimum of 8 (on 7 December).The ECB may conduct liquidity-providing and 
liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning operations on an 
ad hoc basis to manage liquidity conditions in the 

market and to steer interest rates. The Governing 

Council™s decision to widen access to Þ ne-tuning 
operations as of 6 October 2008, by granting 

eligibility to all counterparties that are eligible to 

participate in Eurosystem open market operations 

based on standard tenders, and that additionally 

fulÞ l certain selection criteria speci
Þ ed by the 
respective NCBs, remained in effect in 2009.In 2009 the ECB conducted Þ ne-tuning operations only on the last day of the maintenance periods. 12 liquidity-absorbing operations were carried out, with a one-day maturity, conducted 
as variable rate tenders with a maximum bid rate 
equal to the Þ xed rate on the MROs. On average, 
•154 billion was absorbed via these operations, 
with 136 counterparties participating.STANDING FACILITIESCounterparties may use the two standing 
facilities on their own initiative to obtain 
overnight liquidity against eligible collateral or 
to place overnight deposits with the Eurosystem. 
At the end of 2009, 2,401 counterparties had 
access to the marginal lending facility and 
2,775 counterparties had access to the deposit 
facility. The rates on these facilities in principle provide a ceiling and a ß oor for the overnight rate 
and therefore perform an important function 
for monetary policy implementation. On 
15 January 2009, following a decision taken 
by the Governing Council on 18 December 
2008, the width of the corridor formed by 
these two rates was increased from 100 to 
200 basis points symmetrically around the MRO 
rate. On 7 May 2009 the width of the corridor 
was narrowed to 150 basis points when the 
rate on the MROs was reduced to 1.00%. This 
was done to ensure that the rate on the deposit 
facility remained above zero, thus maintaining 
an incentive to trade in the unsecured overnight 
market. At the same time, the corridor was kept 
symmetric around the Þ xed rate on the MROs.
The ample allotments in the Þ xed rate 
open market operations led to a signiÞ cant 
increase in the use of the deposit facility, in 

particular after the settlement of the Þ rst LTRO 
with a one-year maturity. The average daily use 

of the deposit facility was •109 billion (compared 

with •0.5 billion in 2007 and •208.5 billion in the 

period from 9 October until 31 December 2008). 

In 2009 recourse to the deposit facility followed 

a broadly similar pattern during each reserve 

maintenance period: the deposit facility amounts 

were lower at the beginning of each period, but 

increased subsequently as more counterparties 

fulÞ lled their reserve requirements.

2009The average daily recourse to the marginal lending facility was •1 billion (compared 
with •6.7 billion in the period October-
December 2008). This decline may be linked 
to a reduction in uncertainty about individual 
banks™ liquidity needs, an improvement in the 
functioning of the unsecured overnight interbank 
market (as seen, for example, in the reopening 
of credit lines), and the ample allotments in the 
reÞ nancing operations. 
ELIGIBLE ASSETS FOR MONETARY POLICY 

OPERATIONS 
As required by the Statute of the ESCB, and in 
line with central bank practice worldwide, all 
credit operations of the Eurosystem are based 
on adequate collateral. The concept of adequacy 
implies, Þ rst, that the Eurosystem is to a large 
extent protected from incurring losses in its 
credit operations and, second, that sufÞ cient collateral should be available to a wide set 
of counterparties, so that the Eurosystem 
can provide the amount of liquidity it deems 
necessary in its monetary policy operations and 
as intraday credit in payment system operations. 
To facilitate this, the Eurosystem accepts a 
broad range of assets as collateral in all its credit 
operations. This feature of the Eurosystem™s 
collateral framework, together with the fact that 
access to Eurosystem open market operations 
is granted to a large pool of counterparties, has 
been key to supporting the implementation of 
monetary policy in times of stress. The inbuilt 
ß exibility of its operational framework allowed 
the Eurosystem to provide the necessary liquidity 
to address the impaired functioning of the 
money market without encountering widespread 
collateral constraints during the Þ nancial crisis. 
At the end of 2008 the Governing Council 
decided to expand the list of eligible collateral, 
as a temporary measure which will remain in 
place until the end of 2010. In 2009 the average amount of eligible collateral increased by 17.9%, compared 
with 2008, to a total of •13.1 trillion (see 
Chart 48). General government debt, at 
•5.5 trillion, accounted for 40% of the total, while the remainder of marketable collateral 
was in the form of uncovered bank bonds 
(•2.8 trillion, or 20%), covered bank bonds 
(•1.4 trillion, or 11%), asset-backed securities 
(•1.3 trillion, or 10%), corporate bonds 
(•1.3 trillion, or 10%), and other bonds 
(•0.5 trillion, or 4%), such as those issued by 
supranational organisations. The overall volume 
of marketable assets eligible as a result of the 
temporary measures to expand the list of eligible 
collateral amounted to around •1.4 trillion at the 
end of 2009. The list of eligible collateral also 
includes non-marketable assets, mostly credit 
claims (also referred to as bank loans). In contrast 
to marketable assets, non-marketable assets are 
assessed for eligibility only at the time of their 
acceptance. The volume of potentially eligible 
non-marketable assets therefore cannot easily be 
measured. Taking into account this caveat, the 
amount of non-marketable assets put forward 
by counterparties as collateral in Eurosystem 
credit operations is estimated to have reached 
•0.3 trillion in 2009, representing 2% of total 
eligible collateral in the Eurosystem. The 
lower credit threshold temporarily introduced 
to expand the list of eligible collateral was also 
applied to non-marketable assets.Chart 48 Eligible collateral by asset type(EUR billions; annual averages)02,0004,000

2009The average value of marketable and non-marketable assets put forward by 
counterparties as collateral in Eurosystem credit 
operations rose signiÞ cantly, from •1,579 billion 
in 2008 to •2,034 billion in 2009. This increase 
was mainly due to the fact that counterparties 
submitted large additional amounts of collateral 

to the Eurosystem in response to the Þ nancial market turbulence (see Chart 49). As the 
comparison of collateral with outstanding credit 
to the Eurosystem™s counterparties indicates, the 
share of collateral put forward that is not used 
to cover credit from monetary policy operations 
increased marginally on an aggregate basis. This 
suggests that insufÞ ciency of collateral has not 
been a systemic constraint on the Eurosystem™s 
counterparties, despite the increasing volume of 
liquidity received in the reÞ nancing operations.
As regards the composition of collateral put 
forward (see Chart 50), the average share of 
asset-backed securities decreased from 28% in 2008 to 23% in 2009, which was due 
to reductions in market values and haircut 
increases, while the overall amount submitted 
remained stable. Uncovered bank bonds 
accounted on average for slightly less than 
28% of the collateral put forward in 2009, 
thereby becoming the largest class of assets put 
forward as collateral in Eurosystem operations. 
The average share of non-marketable assets 
increased from 12% in 2008 to 14% in 2009. 
In addition, the average share of central 
government securities increased from 10% in 
2008 to 11% in 2009. The new asset classes 
which are temporarily eligible accounted for 
around 3.8% of the total marketable collateral 
put forward.RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
The Eurosystem mitigates the risk of a 
counterparty default in a Eurosystem credit 
operation by requiring counterparties to submit 
adequate collateral. However, the Eurosystem is Chart 49 Collateral put forward in Eurosystem

2009still exposed to a number of Þ nancial risks if a 
counterparty defaults, including credit, market and liquidity risk. In addition, the Eurosystem 
is exposed to currency risk in the context 
of liquidity-providing operations in foreign 
currencies against euro-denominated collateral, 
such as those conducted in 2009. In order to 
reduce these risks to acceptable levels, the 
Eurosystem maintains high credit standards for 
assets accepted as collateral, valuates collateral 
on a daily basis and applies appropriate risk 
control measures. As a matter of prudence, the Eurosystem has established buffers against potential shortfalls 
resulting from the eventual resolution of 
collateral received from counterparties that have 
defaulted. The level of the buffer is reviewed 
annually, pending the eventual disposal of 
the collateral and in line with the prospect of 
recovery. More generally, Þ nancial risks in 
credit operations are quantiÞ ed and regularly 
reported to the ECB™s decision-making bodies.In 2009 the ECB added the technical reÞ nements of the risk control framework which it had announced on 4 September 2008, introducing 
adjustments concerning the use of asset-backed 
securities and uncovered bank bonds eligible 
for Eurosystem credit operations. With regard 
to asset-backed securities, the Eurosystem 
announced on 20 January and 20 November 2009 
additional requirements for the ratings of 
accepted external credit assessment institutions. 
Moreover, in order for asset-backed securities 
issued as of 1 March 2009 to be eligible for 
Eurosystem credit operations, it was decided 
that the underlying pool should not consist, 
in whole or in part, of tranches of other asset-
backed securities. Asset-backed securities issued 
before 1 March 2009 are exempt from the latter 
requirement until 1 March 2010. With regard 
to uncovered bank bonds, the Eurosystem 
announced on 20 January 2009 the introduction 
of limits to their use as of 1 March 2009. While preserving the key features of the Eurosystem™s framework for credit operations, 
such as the wide range of eligible collateral and the broad access of Eurosystem counterparties 
to central bank liquidity, the above adjustments 
to the risk control framework were made with 
a view to maintaining an adequate level of risk 
protection for the Eurosystem. In addition, the 
changes with regard to the use of asset-backed 
securities aimed to contribute to the restoration 
of the proper functioning of these markets.Furthermore, to ensure an adequate risk assessment of the asset-backed securities used 
in its credit operations, the Eurosystem has been 
investigating whether the existence of loan-
by-loan information on the underlying assets 
backing such instruments should be taken into 
account in the risk management framework. 
To this end, the Eurosystem has engaged in 
discussions with rating agencies, investors, 
industry bodies and originators of such securities 
and launched a related public consultation on 
23 December 2009. Such loan-level information 
would increase transparency with regard to 
asset-backed securities, thus making it possible 
to make more informed risk assessments for 
such assets and helping to restore conÞ dence in 
the securitisation markets.1.2 FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS AND 
OPERATIONS WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKSIn 2009 the Eurosystem did not undertake any 
interventions in the foreign exchange market. 
Furthermore, the ECB did not undertake any 
foreign exchange operations in the currencies 
that participate in ERM II. The standing 
agreement between the ECB and the IMF to 
facilitate the initiation of special drawing right 
(SDR) transactions by the IMF on behalf of the 
ECB with other SDR holders was activated on 
nine occasions in 2009.In order to address disruptions in the European US dollar funding markets triggered 
by the Þ nancial market turmoil, the ECB 
established a reciprocal currency arrangement 
(swap line) with the US Federal Reserve System 
in 2007, which was repeatedly extended, 
on the last occasion until 1 February 2010. 105ECBAnnual Report
2009In connection with the US dollar Term Auction Facility of the Federal Reserve System, and in 
close cooperation with other central banks, the 
Eurosystem provided the US dollar funding 
received via this swap line to its counterparties 
against collateral eligible for Eurosystem credit 
operations. In the context of the Þ nancial market 
volatility in 2009, the Eurosystem continued to 
conduct operations as Þ xed rate tenders with 
full allotment with 7, 28 and 84-day maturity to 
provide US dollar liquidity to the Eurosystem™s 
counterparties. In 2009 US dollar funding 
to euro area counterparties was provided via 
69 reverse transactions against eligible collateral 
and six EUR/USD foreign exchange swap 
operations. Owing to the improved conditions 
in funding markets and limited demand, the 
operations in the form of EUR/USD foreign 
exchange swaps were discontinued at the end 
of January 2009, while US dollar repurchase 
operations with maturities of 28, 84 and 7 days 
were discontinued following the operations held 
on 28 July 2009, 6 October 2009 and 27 January 
2010 respectively.Following the conclusion in October 2008 of a swap line with the Swiss National Bank, the 
Eurosystem continued to provide Swiss franc 
liquidity to its counterparties in 2009. These 
operations were conducted in the form of 
EUR/CHF foreign exchange swaps at a Þ xed price and with a maximum allotment amount, 
determined by the ECB in coordination 
with the Swiss National Bank. In 2009 the 
Eurosystem carried out 51 Swiss franc-
providing swap operations at a seven-day 
maturity. On 18 January 2010 the Governing 
Council decided, in agreement with the Swiss 
National Bank, to stop conducting one-week 
Swiss franc liquidity-providing swap operations 
after 31 January 2010, against the background 
of declining demand and improved conditions 
in the funding markets.In April 2009 the Governing Council decided to establish a temporary reciprocal currency 
arrangement (swap line) with the Federal Reserve 
System to provide the latter with the capacity to offer euro liquidity of up to •80 billion. This 
swap line was repeatedly extended, on the last 
occasion until 1 February 2010. In addition, 
the ECB and Sveriges Riksbank announced in 
June 2009 that they would activate the temporary 
reciprocal currency agreement (swap line) 
concluded in 2007 for a maximum amount 
of •10 billion, with the aim of facilitating the 
functioning of Þ nancial markets and providing 
euro liquidity to Sveriges Riksbank if needed.1.3 THE COVERED BOND PURCHASE PROGRAMME 
The Governing Council decided in May 2009 
to establish a programme of outright purchases 
of covered bonds for monetary policy purposes. 
This programme, which constituted a building 
block of the ECB™s enhanced credit support 
approach, was launched with the aim of 
contributing to the revival of the covered bond Chart 51 Spreads between covered bond

bonds in the amount of •60 billion between 
July 2009 and the end of June 2010. These 
bonds, issued in the euro area, have to comply 
with certain criteria, which were made public to 
all market participants.By 31 December 2009 the Eurosystem had purchased covered bonds for a total nominal 
value of around •28 billion, 24% of which was 
accounted for by purchases in the primary 
market and 76% by purchases in the secondary 
market. Since the announcement of the 
programme, new issuance in the covered bond 
market has picked up and spreads between 
yields on covered bonds and swap rates have 
narrowed signiÞ cantly, which is also partly due 
to a general improvement of Þ nancial markets. 
This has also been accompanied by a general 
narrowing of other spreads, such as those on 
senior unsecured bank bonds (see Chart 51).1 1.4 INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
The ECB™s investment activities are organised 
in such a way as to ensure that no insider 
information about central bank policy actions 
may be used when making investment decisions. 
A set of rules and procedures, known as the 
Chinese wall, separates the ECB™s Investment 
Division from other business units.FOREIGN RESERVE MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio was 
originally set up through transfers of foreign 
reserve assets from the euro area NCBs. Over 
time, the composition of the portfolio reß ects changes in the market value of the invested assets, 
as well as foreign exchange and gold operations 
of the ECB. The main purpose of the ECB™s 
foreign reserves is to ensure that, whenever 
needed, the Eurosystem has a sufÞ cient amount 
of liquid resources for its foreign exchange 
policy operations involving non-EU currencies. 
The objectives for the management of the ECB™s 
foreign reserves are, in order of importance, 
liquidity, security and return.The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio consists of 
US dollars, Japanese yen, gold and SDRs. The 
US dollar and Japanese yen reserves are actively 
managed by the ECB and those euro area NCBs 
which wish to take part in this activity as agents 
for the ECB. Since January 2006 a ﬁcurrency 
specialisation modelﬂ has been in operation 
to increase the efÞ ciency of the Eurosystem™s 
investment operations. Under this scheme each 
NCB, or group of NCBs acting jointly for this 
purpose, is as a rule allocated a share in the 
US dollar or the Japanese yen portfolio.2 Since January 2009, when Slovakia joined the euro 
area, Národná banka Slovenska has managed a 
US dollar portfolio as an agent for the ECB.During 2009 the ECB sold 35.5 tonnes of gold 
in total. The proceeds of the gold sales were 

added to the US dollar portfolio. These sales 

were in full conformity with the Central Bank 

Gold Agreement of 8 March 2004, to which the 

ECB was a signatory and which was renewed on 

7 August 2009.The value of the ECB™s net foreign reserve assets 3 at current exchange rates and market prices increased from •49.5 billion at end-2008 
to •51 billion at end-2009, of which •38.3 billion 
was in foreign currencies Œ the Japanese yen 
and the US dollar Œ and •12.7 billion was in 
gold and SDRs. Applying the exchange rates 
of end-2009, US dollar-denominated assets 
represented 78.5% of the foreign currency 
reserves, while those denominated in Japanese 
yen accounted for 21.5%. The decrease in the 
euro value of the foreign currency portfolio, 
of 0.5%, mainly reß ected the depreciation of 
the Japanese yen (by 5.3%) and the US dollar 
(by 3.4%) versus the euro over the year, while 
the capital gains and interest income generated For further information on the covered bond purchase 1 programme, see the ECB™s website, in particular http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omo.
For more details, see the article entitled ﬁPortfolio management at 
2 the ECBﬂ in the April 2006 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.
Net foreign reserve assets are calculated as ofÞ cial reserve assets 
3 excluding the net, marked-to-market value of foreign currency 
swaps, plus deposits in foreign currency with residents, minus 
future predetermined net drains on foreign currency holdings 
owing to repurchase and forward transactions. For detailed 
information on the data sources, see the ECB™s website.107ECBAnnual Report
2009by portfolio management activities and the investment of the proceeds of the gold sales 
mentioned above made positive contributions. 
The value of both the gold and SDR holdings 
increased by around 14.0%, despite the sales 
of gold. This increase was mostly due to the 
appreciation of gold by around 22.1% in 2009, 
as measured in euro terms. In 2009 some government-guaranteed instruments 
were added to the list of instruments eligible for 

the investment of the ECB™s foreign reserves. 

The start of an automatic securities lending 

programme for the ECB™s US dollar-denominated 

assets, which had been Þ nalised in 2008, was 
postponed as it was deemed opportune to wait for 

more favourable lending conditions.OWN FUNDS MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s own funds portfolio consists of 
the invested counterpart of the ECB™s paid-up 
capital, as well as amounts held from time to 
time in its general reserve fund and its provision 
against foreign exchange rate, interest rate and 
gold price risks. The purpose of this portfolio is 
to provide the ECB with income to help to cover 
its operating expenses. The objective of its 
management is to maximise expected returns, 
subject to a no-loss constraint at a certain 
conÞ dence level. The portfolio is invested in 
euro-denominated Þ xed income assets. 
The value of the portfolio at current market 
prices grew from •10.2 billion at end-2008 to 
•11.8 billion at end-2009. The increase in market 
value was due to the investment in the own 
funds portfolio of the provision against foreign 
exchange rate, interest rate and gold price risks 
established by the ECB in 2005, as well as to 
investment returns and the contributions by 
Národná banka Slovenska to the capital and 
reserves of the ECB following the adoption of 
the euro by Slovakia.The list of eligible instruments was extended 
during 2009 to include certain government-
guaranteed securities which comply with the 

ECB™s eligibility criteria for its own funds portfolio.A Chinese wall was set up by the ECB in the 
implementation of the covered bond purchase 
programme as the own funds portfolio and the 
purchasing activity for the above-mentioned 
programme were managed by the same unit. RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUESThe Þ nancial risks to which the ECB is 
exposed in its investment activities are closely 
monitored and measured in order to keep 
them within the levels speciÞ ed by the ECB™s 
decision-making bodies. For this purpose, a 
detailed limit structure is in place and limits are 
monitored daily. Regular reporting ensures that 
all stakeholders are adequately informed of the 
level of such risks. In 2009 the ECB continued to enhance the IT infrastructure supporting the risk management 
framework for its investment operations. This 
framework was extended to cover the portfolio 
of covered bonds purchased by the ECB under 
the covered bond purchase programme.One of the indicators used to monitor market 
risk is Value-at-Risk (VaR), which deÞ nes 
the loss for a portfolio of assets that will not 

be exceeded at the end of a speciÞ ed period of 
time with a given probability. The value of this 

indicator depends on a series of parameters used 

for the calculation, in particular the conÞ dence 
level, the length of the time horizon and the 

sample used to estimate asset price volatility. 

As an illustration, computing this indicator for 

the ECB™s investment portfolio, including the 

covered bond purchase programme portfolio, 

on 31 December 2009, using as parameters 

a 95% conÞ dence level, a time horizon of 
one year and a sample of one year for asset 

price volatility, would result in a VaR of 

•10,655 million. Computing the same indicator 

with a Þ ve-year instead of a one-year sample 
would result in a VaR of •7,975 million. Most 

of this market risk is due to currency and gold 

price risk. The low levels of interest rate risk 

reß ect the fact that the modi
Þ ed duration of 
the ECB™s investment portfolios remained 

relatively low in 2009.108ECBAnnual Report
20092 PAYMENT AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS
The Eurosystem has the statutory task of ensuring efÞ cient and sound clearing and 
payment systems. Its main instrument for 
carrying out this task Œ aside from the oversight 
function (see Section 4 of Chapter 3) Œ is the 
provision of payment and securities settlement 
facilities. To this end, the Eurosystem created
the Trans-European Automated Real-time 
Gross settlement Express Transfer system, 
known as TARGET, for large-value and urgent 
payments in euro. The technically decentralised 
Þ rst-generation system was replaced by a 
second-generation system (TARGET2) in 
May 2008, when migration to the new system 
was completed. TARGET2 is based on a single 
technical infrastructure, the Single Shared 
Platform (SSP). Three Eurosystem central banks Œ 

the Banca d™Italia, the Banque de France and the 
Deutsche Bundesbank Œ jointly provide the SSP 
and operate it on behalf of the Eurosystem.On the securities settlement side, the Eurosystem 
has made signiÞ cant progress on its project 
of building a single IT platform Œ known as
TARGET2-Securities (T2S) Œ for the settlement 
of virtually all securities in Europe, thereby 
removing any distinction between domestic 
and cross-border transactions. Work during 
2009 focused on advancing the technical 
documentation for the platform, strengthening 
relations with central securities depositories 
(CSDs) and preparing for the development 
phase of the project, which started in early 2010. 
Progress has also been made on a number of 
strategic policy issues, such as governance and 
harmonisation.With respect to the cross-border mobilisation of collateral, the correspondent central 
banking model has since 1999 enabled all 
euro area counterparties to use a common set of 
eligible assets as collateral in Eurosystem credit 
operations. In order to increase the efÞ ciency of 
collateral management, the Eurosystem decided 
in July 2008 to launch the Collateral Central 
Bank Management system, or CCBM2, which 
will be built on a single technical platform 
and will lead to a further standardisation 
of procedures.2.1 THE TARGET2 SYSTEM
TARGET2 plays an important role in the 
execution of the single monetary policy and the 
functioning of the euro money market. It offers 
a real-time settlement service in central bank 
money and broad market coverage. It processes 
large-value and urgent transactions without any 
upper or lower value limit and has also attracted 
a variety of other payments. TARGET2 OPERATIONS 
The TARGET2 system functioned smoothly 
in 2009 and continued to settle a high number 
of euro payments. The system™s market share was 

stable, with 89% of the total value of payments 
in euro large-value payment systems being 
executed via TARGET2. The average number 
of payments processed by the TARGET2 system 
each day decreased by 7%, to 345,771, while 
the average value fell by 19%, to •2,153 billion. 
On 30 September 2009 TARGET2 reached 
a peak of 508,368 transactions. Table 12 
provides an overview of the payment trafÞ c in the TARGET2 system in 2009, comparing 
it with the trafÞ c in the previous year. 
The decrease observed in terms of volume 
and value is largely attributable to the effects 
of the Þ nancial crisis. In addition, statistical 
indicators are based on a new methodology 
which has been applied to TARGET2 statistics 
since January 2009. This should be taken into 
account when comparing 2009 Þ gures with 
those from previous years, in particular with 
regard to the value settled.The overall availability of TARGET2, i.e. the extent to which participants were able 
to use the system during their business hours 
without incident, reached 99.99% in 2009. 
The level of availability was affected only 
by incidents occurring in relation to national 
proprietary home accounts, while the SSP 
itself achieved 100% availability during 
the period under review. 99.96% of the 
payments in TARGET2 were processed within 
Þ ve minutes. The system™s very positive 
performance met with the satisfaction of all 
participants.109ECBAnnual Report
2009By December 2009 822 direct participants maintained a real-time gross settlement 
account in the TARGET2 system. The overall 
number of banks (including branches and 
subsidiaries) that can be addressed worldwide 
through TARGET2 increased to around 55,000. 
In addition, TARGET2 settled the cash positions 
of 69 ancillary systems.COOPERATION WITH TARGET2 USERS 
The Eurosystem maintains close relations with 
TARGET2 users and regular meetings were 
held between the euro area NCBs and national 
TARGET2 user groups in 2009. In addition, 
joint meetings of the Eurosystem Working 
Group on TARGET2 and the TARGET Working 
Group of the European credit sector associations 
took place on a quarterly basis to discuss 
TARGET2 business issues at the pan-European 
level. Strategic issues were addressed in the 
Contact Group on Euro Payments Strategy, a 
forum composed of senior representatives of 
commercial and central banks.MANAGEMENT OF NEW SYSTEM RELEASESThe Eurosystem endeavours to ensure that
changes in the Þ eld of large-value payments are
reß ected in TARGET2. This continuous focus 
on the evolution of the system is necessary in 
order to enhance the level of service offered 
by TARGET2 and to meet the needs of its 
participants. To achieve this goal, all stakeholders are involved in the release management process 
in a timely manner. In general, TARGET2 releases take place annually and coincide with the annual standard 
SWIFT releases in November. The development 
of the annual TARGET2 release takes place over 
a 21-month period in order that all parties have 
sufÞ cient time for discussion, prioritisation, 
implementation and testing. Information is 
made available to participants at an early stage 
to allow for the proper planning and budgeting 
of all changes. In 2009 two releases took place: 
a Þ rst intermediate release on 11 May to enable 
the cross-CSD settlement functionality in the 
ancillary system interface, and a second on 
23 November enhancing the system™s real-time 
online monitoring tool and implementing the 
new message standard MT202COV, among 
other new features.COUNTRIES PARTICIPATING IN TARGET2 
All euro area countries participate in TARGET2, 

as its use is mandatory for the settlement of 

payment orders resulting directly from or made 

in connection with Eurosystem monetary policy 

operations. When Slovakia adopted the euro 

on 1 January 2009, Národná banka Slovenska 

and its national user community joined the 

TARGET2 system. In 2002 the Governing 

Council of the ECB conÞ rmed the right of the 
non-euro area NCBs to connect to TARGET 

on a ﬁno compulsion, no prohibitionﬂ basis. 

TARGET2 is thus also available, on a voluntary 

basis, to non-euro area EU Member States 

to facilitate the settlement of euro-denominated 

transactions in these countries. From a legal 

and business point of view, each participating 

and connected central bank is responsible 

for managing its system component and 

maintaining the relationships with its 

participants.In February 2010, having carried out the necessary preparations and testing activities, 
   (Bulgarian National Bank) and its national user community 
connected to TARGET2. 23 central banks of Table 12 Payment traffic in TARGET 1)Value(EUR billions)20082009

110ECBAnnual Report
2009the EU and their respective user communities are now connected to TARGET2: the 17 euro 
area central banks, including the ECB, and six 
central banks from non-euro area countries 4.In addition, some Þ nancial institutions located
in other EEA countries participate in TARGET2 
via remote access.FORTHCOMING DEVELOPMENTS 
In November 2009 the Eurosystem Þ nalised the 
contents of the new system release version 4.0, 
the implementation of which is envisaged 
on 22 November 2010. The release includes 
internet-based connection to TARGET2, 
in particular for small and medium-sized credit 
institutions, and various other enhancements 
requested by the user community. In addition, 
the contents of release 5.0 (to be implemented 
in November 2011) will be deÞ ned in 2010 in 
cooperation with the user community.2.2 TARGET2-SECURITIES 
T2S is the future Eurosystem service for 
securities settlement in central bank money. 
It will make the settlement of cross-border 
securities transactions as simple and efÞ cient as that of domestic transactions. With T2S, it will 
be possible to settle almost all traded securities 
in Europe in a single settlement engine according 
to a harmonised timetable, using a common IT 
interface and a harmonised message format. 
T2S therefore represents a major breakthrough 
towards an integrated European capital market. 
Furthermore, although it is an initiative of 
the Eurosystem, T2S will settle securities 
transactions not only in euro, but also in other 
currencies if the relevant central bank, supported 
by its market, gives its consent. The Þ nancial crisis has signi
Þ cantly increased 
awareness of the beneÞ ts of T2S. First, T2S will 
reduce market participants™ back ofÞ ce costs, 
cutting settlement fees to one of the lowest levels 
in the world. Second, by using sophisticated 

settlement algorithms, recycling mechanisms and 

auto-collateralisation 5, T2S will greatly increase 
the efÞ ciency of banks™ collateral and liquidity 
management. Third, by extending real-time gross 

settlement in central bank money across Europe, 

T2S will reduce the Þ nancial risk exposure of 
market participants, particularly for cross-border 

transactions. Furthermore, T2S will apply the 

same state-of-the-art business continuity 

arrangements as TARGET2.In 2009 the four NCBs charged with developing and operating the platform Œ the Deutsche 
Bundesbank, the Banco de España, the Banque 
de France and the Banca d™Italia Œ focused on 
translating the user requirements drawn up in 
close cooperation with market participants into 
a technical form that will act as the basis for the 
IT software development. In November 2009 
the package of technical documents Œ the most 
important being the general functional 
speciÞ cations and the general technical design Œ 
was published.To assist the ECB™s decision-making bodies 
in ensuring the successful and timely completion 

of the T2S programme and to strengthen the 

internal management of the project, the Governing 

Council decided in March 2009 to establish the 

T2S Programme Board. The Programme Board 

was also entrusted with certain implementation 

tasks by the Eurosystem central banks so that 

it can be fully operational and act on behalf of 

the whole Eurosystem. Although the Governing 

Council will remain the ultimate decision-making 

body for strategic policy issues, the Programme 

Board will be responsible for developing 

proposals for the Governing Council on key 

policy issues, for managing the T2S programme 

on a daily basis and for maintaining relations with 

external stakeholders and the four NCBs building 

the platform.The Programme Board is composed of eight members, appointed for a renewable term of
18 months. It is chaired by an ECB senior 
manager and includes two former CEOs of 
CSDs, as well as four representatives from Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.4 Auto-collateralisation is an arrangement whereby securities being 
5 transferred (or securities held on stock) can be used as collateral to 
secure credit from the central bank in order to settle the transfer.111ECBAnnual Report
2009euro area NCBs and one representative from anon-euro area NCB. The members do not 
represent the views of their respective 
institutions, but act exclusively in the interests 
of the Eurosystem and the T2S programme. 
On 17 September 2009 the Governing Council 
approved the T2S Programme Board™s Code of 
Conduct and Rules of Procedure.One of the key factors in determining the success of the project will be the achievement 
of a ﬁcritical massﬂ in terms of the volume of 
transactions to be settled on the platform when 
it goes live. A major step forward was made 
in this respect in July 2009, when the T2S 
Memorandum of Understanding was signed 
between the Eurosystem and 27 CSDs from 
25 countries in Europe. This included not only 
all CSDs located in the euro area, but also nine 
non-euro area CSDs (in Denmark, Estonia, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Sweden, the 
United Kingdom, Iceland and Switzerland). 
Subsequently, the Norwegian and Polish 
CSDs also announced that they would adhere 
to the Memorandum of Understanding, bringing 
the total number of CSDs to 29. In addition, 
the central banks of Denmark, Sweden and 
Norway have expressed an interest in settling 
their national currencies in T2S. Although 
signing the Memorandum of Understanding 
does not commit CSDs to use T2S when it 
becomes operational, it provides a strong basis 
for negotiation of a formal contractual agreement 
between the CSDs and the Eurosystem that is 
expected to be Þ nalised during 2010.
The T2S project will make a signiÞ cant contribution to the harmonisation of 
Europe™s complex post-trading environment. 
Harmonisation will reduce costs, increase 
competition and reduce risk.6 The common technical interface and single settlement 
schedule of T2S, as well as the adoption of 
industry standards on matching and messaging 
formats, will help considerably to promote 
harmonisation. During 2009 work on the 
harmonisation of T2S matching and settlement 
processes continued, and standards for the processing of corporate actions on unsettled 
transactions in T2S were approved. These 
standards were also endorsed by the European 
Commission™s Clearing and Settlement 
Advisory Monitoring Expert Group II, 
which is the group responsible for the 
dismantling of the ﬁGiovannini barriersﬂ 
to efÞ cient clearing and settlement.
2.3 SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES FOR COLLATERAL 
Eligible assets may be used to collateralise all 
types of Eurosystem credit operation, not only 
at the domestic level but also across national 
borders. Since the introduction of the euro, 
the use of cross-border collateral has grown 
continuously. In December 2009 the amount 
of cross-border collateral (including both 
marketable and non-marketable assets) held 
by the Eurosystem increased to •866 billion, 
from •861 billion in the same month of the 
previous year. Overall, at the end of 2009
cross-border collateral represented 38.2% of 
the total collateral provided to the Eurosystem.The cross-border mobilisation of collateral in the euro area is mainly conducted via the 
correspondent central banking model (CCBM) 
and through eligible links between euro area 
securities settlement systems (SSSs). Whereas 
the Þ rst solution is provided by the Eurosystem, 
the latter is a market-led initiative.EUROSYSTEM COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT 

SERVICESThe CCBM has remained the main channel 
for transferring cross-border collateral in 
Eurosystem monetary policy and intraday credit 
operations. It accounted for 26.1% of the total 
collateral provided to the Eurosystem in 2009. 
Assets held in custody through the CCBM 
decreased from •713 billion at the end of 2008 
to •569 billion at the end of 2009. For further details, see the special feature article entitled 6 ﬁHarmonisation in the post-trading sectorﬂ in the ECB™s forthcoming issue of ﬁFinancial integration in Europeﬂ.112ECBAnnual Report
2009Since its implementation in 1999, the CCBM has contributed to Þ nancial market integration 
by providing access to all eligible assets for 
all euro area counterparties, be it for use in 
monetary policy operations or to obtain intraday 
liquidity in TARGET2. However, the framework 
was set up as an interim solution based on the 
principle of minimum harmonisation. In order 
to introduce a more harmonised level of service 
and consequently deepen Þ nancial market 
integration, the Eurosystem decided in 2008 
to launch CCBM2, based on a single platform. 
The development and operation of CCBM2 on 
behalf of the Eurosystem was assigned to the 
Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale 
de Belgique and De Nederlandsche Bank, with 
a view to commencing live operations before, or 
at the latest by the time of, the launch of T2S. CCBM2 will enhance harmonisation and 
increase efÞ ciency by optimising the costs of 
collateral mobilisation. Moreover, CCBM2 

will process instructions via straight-through 

processing, permitting the delivery of all 

eligible collateral used on both a domestic and 

a cross-border basis to generate the release 

of related credit in TARGET2 on a real-time 

basis. In addition, this advanced system will 

bring about new opportunities for Eurosystem 

counterparties, particularly banks operating in 

multiple countries, to optimise their collateral 

use and improve their liquidity management. It 

will also allow central banks to monitor more 

closely the collateral used in credit operations.Although CCBM2 aims to ensure the 
technically consolidated management of 

collateral, the system will be implemented in 

accordance with the principle of decentralised 

access to credit. The participation of the 

euro area NCBs in CCBM2 will be voluntary, 

and a modular approach will be adopted, 

allowing the NCBs to choose the CCBM2 

modules that suit their own needs and those 

of their markets. The platform will be fully 

compatible with TARGET2 and T2S. 
The Eurosystem is currently in the process of 
Þ nalising the detailed speci
Þ cations for users, 
which are based on the user requirements 
approved in 2008. The Eurosystem will maintain 
an open dialogue with market participants 
throughout the subsequent phases of the CCBM2 
project. ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITIES 

SETTLEMENT SYSTEMSCross-border collateral can also be mobilised 
by using links between national SSSs. Such 
arrangements allow the cross-border transfer of 
eligible securities between systems. Once the 
securities have been transferred via such links 
to another SSS, they can be used through local 
procedures in the same way as any domestic 
collateral. The amount of collateral mobilised 
through links decreased from •148 billion 
in December 2008 to •116 billion at the end 
of 2009. This accounted for 5.1% of the total 
collateral (both cross-border and domestic) held 
by the Eurosystem in 2009. Links are thus used 
much less frequently than the CCBM. Since August 2009 54 direct and 7 relayed links have been available to counterparties,
but only a limited number are actively used. 
The decrease from 60 direct links in 2008 can be 
attributed to the rationalisation of links within 
the corporate network of one international CSD. 
Links only become eligible for Eurosystem 
credit operations if they meet the Eurosystem™s 
user standards (see Section 4 of Chapter 3).113ECBAnnual Report
20093 BANKNOTES AND COINS 
3.1 THE CIRCULATION OF BANKNOTES AND 
COINS AND THE HANDLING OF CURRENCYDEMAND FOR EURO BANKNOTES AND COINSAt the end of 2009 the number of euro banknotes in circulation stood at 13.6 billion, with a value 
of •806.4 billion. This represented an increase 
of 4.0% in terms of volume and 5.7% in terms 
of value compared with the levels at the end of 
2008 (13.1 billion banknotes with a value of 
•762.8 billion).In 2009 the number of banknotes in circulation remained at the higher than usual level at which 
it had stabilised since October 2008. Following 
the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the 
subsequent intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial crisis, assets on savings accounts were turned 
into cash, which boosted the value of euro 
banknotes in circulation by an additional 
•35 to •40 billion. Demand was particularly 
strong for high-denomination banknotes as a 
store of value. The demand for euro banknotes 
increased in particular in eastern European 
countries, where the national currencies 
depreciated against the euro. The additional 
banknotes in circulation had not been returned 
by the end of 2009, suggesting that they are 
being hoarded both inside and outside the euro 
area. Such hoarding is fostered by the current 
environment of low interest rates, which reduces 
the cost (in the form of lost interest income) 
of holding cash. As a result of the continued high volumes of •50, •100 and •500 banknotes 
in circulation, the average value of a banknote 
in circulation remained at a comparatively high 
level at the end of 2009 (•59.11 compared with 
•58.15 at the end of the previous year). The statistics on net shipments of euro banknotes by euro area credit institutions to destinations 
outside the euro area suggest that, in value terms, 
between 20% and 25% of the euro banknotes in 
circulation are held by non-euro area residents.Charts 52 and 53 illustrate developments in the 
total number and value of euro banknotes in 

circulation, together with the annual growth rates. 
Looking at the breakdown by denomination, the •100 banknote showed the strongest growth 
in circulation, standing 6.6% higher at the end 
of 2009 than it did one year earlier. It was 
followed by the •500, •50 and •200 banknotes, 
which rose by 6.4%, 5.9% and 4.8% respectively. 
The number of the lower denominations in 
circulation rose at rates of between around 1% 
and 3% (see Chart 54). In 2009 the total number of euro coins in circulation (i.e. net circulation excluding stocks 
held by the NCBs) grew by 6.2%, to 87.5 billion, 
while their value rose by 4.5%, to •21.3 billion. 
The share of the low-value coins, the 1, 2 and 
5 cent coins, in the total number of coins in 
circulation remained fairly stable, at 60%. Chart 52 Number of euro banknotes

2009BANKNOTE HANDLING BY THE EUROSYSTEMIn 2009 the euro area NCBs issued 33.5 billion banknotes, while 33.0 billion banknotes were 
returned to them. The average return frequency 7 of banknotes in circulation decreased slightly, 
to 2.59, meaning that, on average, a banknote was 
checked for authenticity and circulation Þ tness by the fully automated banknote processing 
machines of the euro area NCBs around once 
every four and a half months. The high-value
banknotes, which are frequently hoarded, 
showed low return frequencies, of 0.38 (•500), 
0.60 (•200) and 0.81 (•100), while the return 
frequencies of the denominations which are 
typically used for transactions were higher: 
2.02 (•50), 3.85 (•20), 4.47 (•10) and 2.64 (•5). 
The NCBs identiÞ ed some 5.4 billion banknotes 
as unÞ t for circulation and replaced them 
accordingly. The unÞ t rate,
8 at around 16.4%, remained close to the rate of around 17.0% 
recorded in the previous year. 3.2 BANKNOTE COUNTERFEITING 
AND COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCECOUNTERFEIT EURO BANKNOTES 
During the course of 2009 the National Analysis 
Centres 9 received some 860,000 counterfeit euro banknotes. When compared with the number of genuine euro banknotes in circulation, 
the proportion of counterfeits remains at a very 
low level. Long-term developments in the 
quantity of counterfeits removed from 
circulation are shown in Chart 55. A closer 
analysis shows that the upward trend in quantity, 
which started to emerge in 2008, has been 
accompanied by a shift towards the lower 
denominations as the target of counterfeiters™ 
activities. The •20 banknote was the most 
counterfeited denomination, accounting for 
almost half of the total. The second biggest 
target was the •50 banknote, which accounted 
for approximately one-third of counterfeits. 
Details of the denominational breakdown are 
shown in Chart 56. Although conÞ dence in the security of 
the euro is fully justiÞ ed by the ongoing 
anti-counterfeiting measures of European and international authorities, it should not give rise 
to complacency. The ECB continues to advise 
the public to remain alert to the possibility of DeÞ ned as the total number of banknotes returned to NCBs 
7 in a given period divided by the average number of banknotes in circulation during that period.

2009fraud and to remember the ﬁfeel-look-tiltﬂ test described on the ECB™s website, and never to 
rely on just one security feature.The Eurosystem continues to invest considerable effort in ensuring that both the public and 
professional cash handlers are well-informed 
with regard to the recognition of counterfeit 
banknotes. COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCEThe Eurosystem continues to participate actively 
in the work of the Central Bank Counterfeit 
Deterrence Group (CBCDG), a working group 
of 31 central banks and banknote-printing 
authorities cooperating under the auspices of the 
G10. As in previous years, research into 
techniques designed to prevent the illicit 
reproduction of banknotes remains one of the 
group™s main activities. The ECB hosts the 
International Counterfeit Deterrence Centre 
(ICDC), which acts as the technical centre for 
all CBCDG members. Its main role is to provide 
technical support and to operate a centralised 
communication system serving all parties 
involved in the Þ eld of counterfeit deterrence 
systems. The ICDC also maintains a public 
website 10 which provides information and 
guidance concerning the reproduction of banknote 

images as well as links to 
country-speciÞ c websites. Training is offered on a continuous basis to 
professional cash handlers, both in Europe and 
beyond, and up-to-date information materials 
have been created to support the Eurosystem™s 
Þ ght against counterfeiting. The well-established 
cooperation with Europol and the European 
Commission also serves this goal. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BANKNOTE RECYCLING 

FRAMEWORKCouncil Regulation (EC) No 44/2009, which 
entered into force on 23 January 2009, modiÞ es Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 and

continued to be based on the decentralised 

production scenario with pooling, adopted in 

2002. Under this arrangement, each euro area 

NCB is responsible for the procurement of an 

allocated share of the total requirement for 

certain denominations. Table 13 summarises 

the 2009 production allocation. 
THE EXTENDED CUSTODIAL INVENTORY PILOT 

PROGRAMMEIn 2009 euro banknotes worth •5.3 billion 

were purchased and banknotes worth 

•1.1 billion were sold under the Extended 

Custodial Inventory (ECI)11 pilot programme 
in Asia. Under the current pilot programme, 

which will end in January 2012, ECI sites are 

located in Hong Kong (run by two commercial 

banks) and in Singapore (run as a joint venture 

between two other commercial banks). ECIs 

facilitate the international distribution of euro 

banknotes and provide statistical data on euro 

banknote circulation outside the euro area, as 

well as information on counterfeits found in 

their region.ROADMAP FOR GREATER CONVERGENCE 

OF NCB CASH SERVICESBased on a medium-term roadmap adopted 

by the Governing Council in 2007, the Eurosystem 

continued its work to achieve greater convergence 

of the cash services offered by euro area NCBs. 
In particular, the Eurosystem concentrated on further steps towards an electronic data exchange 
with credit institutions for cash lodgements and 
withdrawals and banknote packaging standards 
for the free-of-charge NCB cash services. Collective efforts towards increased convergence 
and integration will allow stakeholders to reap 

greater beneÞ ts from the single currency and will 
ensure fair and competitive treatment.THE SECOND SERIES OF EURO BANKNOTESThe ECB continued work on a new series of 
euro banknotes in 2009. The design of the new 
series will be based on the ﬁages and styles 
of Europeﬂ theme and will retain the most 
important design elements from the Þ rst series 
of banknotes. Thus, although certain design 
elements will be adjusted, the second series of 
euro banknotes will still be closely related to 
the Þ rst series. The new design aims to integrate 
security features which provide maximum 
protection against counterfeiting while at the 
same time making sure that the general public 
is easily able to distinguish a genuine banknote 
from a counterfeit. The cost of the banknote 
materials and production also has to be taken 
into account. The work on developing the 
origination materials (the master materials used 
for banknote production), which started in 2008, 
will continue into 2010. The involvement of paper mills and printing works throughout the euro area is being 
coordinated to make sure that they will be able An ECI is a cash depot maintained by a commercial bank that 11 holds currency on a custodial basis.Table 13 Allocation of euro banknote

involved in the cash cycle are being consulted 
and kept informed of the progress made during 
the development process. The new series will 
be launched over a period of several years, with 
the Þ rst denomination expected to be issued in a 
few years™ time. The exact timing and sequence 
of issuance will be determined at a later stage. 
The Eurosystem will inform the public well in 
advance about the modalities of the introduction 
of the new banknotes. The NCBs will redeem 
euro banknotes from the Þ rst series for an 
unlimited period of time. 118ECBAnnual Report
2009The ECB, assisted by the NCBs, develops, collects, compiles and disseminates a wide range 
of statistics which support the monetary policy 
of the euro area and various tasks of the ESCB. 
The statistics are also used extensively by public 
authorities, Þ nancial market participants, the 
media and the general public. In 2009 regular 
euro area statistics continued to be provided in 
a smooth and timely manner, with additional 
efforts required to incorporate a relatively 
high number of extraordinary transactions and 
other balance sheet changes as a result of the 
Þ nancial crisis. 2009 also saw the publication of 
enhanced and harmonised euro area and national 
investment fund statistics, as well as improved 
external statistics. In addition, the results of 
a new survey on the access to Þ nance of euro 
area Þ rms, in particular small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs), were published. A further 
important development was the adoption by the 
EU Council of an improved legal framework 
concerning the collection of statistical 
information by the ECB. Finally, the ECB 
continued to contribute to the harmonisation of 
statistical concepts in Europe and to the review 
of global and European statistical standards. 4.1 NEW OR ENHANCED EURO AREA STATISTICS
In November 2009 new harmonised statistics on 

the assets and liabilities of euro area investment 

funds were released for the Þ rst time.
12 
This new and comprehensive dataset shows 

detailed balance sheet information for investment 

funds broken down by investment policy, and 

is more timely and detailed than the previous 

version. A methodological manual on investment 

fund statistics was published in May 2009. 

Work also continued to prepare for the 

reporting, from early 2010, of new ESCB 

statistics on the assets and liabilities of 

Þ nancial vehicle corporations engaged in 
securitisation transactions. In addition, the ESCB 

complemented the list of all EU MFIs by 

publishing an additional list of 45,000 investment 

funds in November 2009. It is foreseen that a list 

of Þ nancial vehicle corporations will be published 
in the Þ rst quarter of 2010. 
In the Þ eld of euro area balance of payments and 
international investment position statistics, 
a new methodology 13 was adopted, which largely eliminates errors and omissions as well 
as asymmetries at the euro area level 
(see Chart 57) and has led to signiÞ cant improvements in these statistics. In September 2009 the ECB published for the Þ rst time the results of a survey on euro area Þ rms™ access to Þ nance, conducted in cooperation with 
the European Commission. The Þ rst wave of 
this survey provided predominantly qualitative evidence on the Þ nancing conditions faced 
by SMEs compared with those faced by large 
Þ rms during the 
Þ rst half of 2009. The results 
of the survey are broken down by, for example, 
Þ rm size, type of economic activity, euro area 
country and Þ rm age. 
The ECB further improved its Short-Term 
European Paper (STEP) statistics and started to 
publish daily statistics on aggregated outstanding 
amounts and new issues broken down by sector, 
maturity, rating and currency, in addition to 
daily yields and spreads (see also Section 3 of 
Chapter 3). Implementing Regulation ECB/2007/8 concerning statistics on 12 the assets and liabilities of investment funds (other than money market funds).
A note published on the ECB™s website on 2 November 2009 13 provides details of the methodological changes implemented.4 STATISTICSChart 57 Net errors and omissions of the

2009In 2009 work continued on enhancing the timeliness, completeness and consistency of the 
quarterly integrated non-Þ nancial and 
Þ nancial sector accounts for the euro area.14 These accounts help, among other things, to identify 
interconnected risks and cross-sector exposures 
in the context of Þ nancial stability assessments 
and macro-prudential analyses. 4.2 OTHER STATISTICAL DEVELOPMENTS
In October 2009 the EU Council adopted 
a Regulation concerning the collection of 
statistical information by the ECB,15 pursuant to an ECB recommendation issued in September 
2008. The Regulation allows the collection of 
statistical information for the full range of ESCB 
tasks (including its contribution to Þ nancial stability) and for the entire euro area Þ nancial corporations sector (including insurance 
corporations and pension funds). Moreover, 
under strict conÞ dentiality provisions, the new 
legal framework permits conÞ dential data to 
be exchanged within the ESCB and between 
the ESCB and the European Statistical System. 
In the context of the introduction of the new 
Regulation, the ESCB™s commitment with 
respect to its statistical function was extended 
by introducing deÞ nitions of the principles 
governing its statistical production. In addition, 
in line with this commitment, comprehensive 
quality reports on euro area statistics were 
published in accordance with the ECB Statistical 
Quality Framework and quality assurance 
procedures. The ECB™s legal framework was reÞ ned to 
enhance the efÞ ciency of the production of 
statistics across the ESCB, by amending and recasting the ECB Guideline on the statistical 
reporting requirements in the Þ eld of government 
Þ nance statistics.
16 The dissemination of statistics was further 
improved, in particular by publishing 
additional tables of euro area statistics and all 
corresponding national data on the websites 
of the ECB and the NCBs, as well as by incorporating additional statistics into the ECB™s 
Statistical Data Warehouse. Moreover, in the 
context of the ECB™s enhanced communication 
strategy with regard to euro area statistics, more 
visualisation tools were made available, for 
example on nominal effective exchange rates, 
and new features were added to the existing 
inß ation dashboard. 
The ECB also continued to participate actively 
in the further development of international 
statistical standards, such as the System of 
National Accounts 2008 (published in 
August 2009),17 the sixth edition of the IMF™s Balance of Payments Manual 18 and the ongoing revision of the ESA 95. Together with the BIS 
and the IMF, the ECB also published the Þ rst part of a handbook on securities statistics.194.3 STATISTICAL NEEDS RESULTING FROM THE 
FINANCIAL CRISISIn 2009 newly identiÞ ed needs to enhance 
Þ nancial market transparency and to improve 
the statistical framework for Þ nancial stability 
analysis were addressed. In addition to the improved statistical coverage of the Þ nancial sector, work focused on: 
i) providing more timely interest rate statistics, 
ii) making available more detailed securities 
statistics and developing securities holdings 
statistics, iii) improving the measurement of 
credit derivatives, including credit default 
swaps, in close cooperation with the BIS, 
iv) improving the compilation of statistics 
on insurance corporations and pension 
funds, and v) reconciling supervisory and These have been published jointly by the ECB and Eurostat on a 14 regular basis since 2007.Council Regulation (EC) No 951/2009 amending Council 15 Regulation (EC) No 2533/98.

also enable the ECB to provide the necessary 
statistical support to the European Systemic 
Risk Board (ESRB) as soon as it is established. In the context of international cooperation, the ECB participates in the Inter-Agency Group 
on Economic and Financial Statistics, together 
with the BIS, the European Commission 
(Eurostat), the IMF, the OECD, the United 
Nations and the World Bank. The Inter-Agency 
Group has launched and is gradually enhancing 
the Principal Global Indicator website,20 which focuses on the G20 economies. The ECB also 
supported IMF staff and the secretariat of the 
Financial Stability Board in the preparation of 
the report entitled ﬁThe Financial Crisis and 
Information Gapsﬂ addressed to the G20 Þ nance ministers and central bank governors in 
November 2009.21See http://www.principalglobalindicators.org/20 Available on the website of the Financial Stability Board 21 (http://www.Þ nancialstabilityboard.org).121ECBAnnual Report
20095 ECONOMIC RESEARCH 
Consistent with the approach adopted throughout the Eurosystem, the purpose of research activities 
at the ECB is to: i) provide research results 
relevant for the formulation of policy advice on 
monetary policy and other Eurosystem tasks, 
ii) maintain and use econometric models in order 

to construct economic forecasts and projections 
and to compare the impact of alternative 
policy choices, and iii) communicate with 
the academic and research community, for 
example through the publication of research 
results in peer-reviewed scientiÞ c journals and 
by participating in and organising research 
conferences. In the light of the challenges posed 
by and lessons learned from the Þ nancial crisis, 
the ECB initiated a multi-year revision of its 
research agenda in 2008, which continued in 
2009. Moreover, the prospect of assuming new 
responsibilities in supporting the work of the 
ESRB has prompted the ECB to formulate a new 
research agenda, focused on the development 
of tools for macro-prudential and systemic risk 
analysis for Þ nancial stability purposes.
5.1 RESEARCH PRIORITIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Economic research at the ECB is performed in 
a decentralised way: all business areas conduct 
research projects according to their needs and 
expertise. The Directorate General Research is 
charged with coordinating this research work, 
as well as producing high-quality research 
itself. The Director General Research chairs 
the Research Coordination Committee (RCC), 
which aligns research activities at the ECB with 
the requirements of the institution and the needs 
of its policy processes. The RCC establishes 
a set of priority areas each year and steers the 
focus of research activities towards these areas.The research priorities established for 2009 were broadly unchanged from those for 2008, 
namely: forecasting and model development; 
enhancing the monetary analysis; understanding 
the transmission mechanism of monetary policy; 
Þ nancial stability; the ef
Þ ciency of the European 
Þ nancial system; payment and settlement issues; 
international linkages; and Þ scal issues. These 
priorities notwithstanding, given the context 
of the Þ nancial crisis, a greater focus was 
placed on research into Þ nancial issues than in 
previous years.The priority on forecasting and model development encompasses all research work 
and tool development undertaken in support of 
economic analysis and forecasting, the latter 
in particular in the context of the Eurosystem/
ECB projection exercises. In 2009 a variety 
of extensions to the New Area-Wide Model 
(NAWM) Œ which is now well-established as a 
central forecasting tool within the Eurosystem/
ECB projection exercises Œ were explored, such 
as the incorporation of models of the Þ nancial sector and Þ scal policy. The structure of the 
base model may be revised in the future in 
the light of the outcome of these projects. The 
Christiano-Motto-Rostagno (CMR) model was 
also further developed and used in a number 
of policy exercises focusing on the behaviour 
of Þ nancial markets. Both the NAWM and 
the CMR model are examples of the dynamic 
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models 
that have been increasingly used to support the 
formulation of policy advice at central banks. 
In the course of 2009 a new DSGE model was 
developed by ECB staff in collaboration with 
the ESCB NCBs to address international policy 
issues. Among more traditional macro models, 
the Multi-Country Model Œ which models 
the largest countries in the euro area and their 
trade links Œ was revised to include explicit 
expectation mechanisms. This new version 
of the model was introduced into the policy 
process over the course of the year. Research 
work on short-term forecasting tools continued, 
with a focus on the further development of tools 
using dynamic-factor and Bayesian techniques. 
A project was also initiated to devise tools to 
measure potential output.Research on monetary analysis concentrated on the development and use of quantitative 
tools to assess monetary developments, with an 
emphasis on providing high-quality analytical 
input into the preparation of policy decisions. 
Work focused on understanding the role of 122ECBAnnual Report
2009money and credit in the economy. An internal research forum 22 discussed these topics throughout the year.With regard to the monetary policy transmission mechanism, new projects were initiated in 2009 
on a variety of topics: asset price dynamics and 
risk premia; the role of the banking sector; the 
Þ nancial decisions of non-
Þ nancial Þ rms; and 
the impact on the transmission mechanism 
of country-speciÞ c features. Projects which 
continued from the previous year included: the 
Wage Dynamics Network, an ESCB research 
network 23 which analyses wage behaviour in 17 EU countries; the Household Finance 
and Consumption Network, a Eurosystem 
research network which collects and analyses 
micro-level information on a wide range of 
household decisions related to the holding of 
real and Þ nancial assets, the taking of debt, 
risk attitudes, employment, income, pensions, 
intergenerational transfers, gifts, consumption 
and savings; and an ECB research forum on 
central bank communication policies.The links between Þ nancial stability and 
monetary policy were also explored, with a focus on the development of Þ nancial stability 
indicators and the impact of Þ nancial stability 
concerns on the conduct of monetary policy. 
In particular, work was completed on the analysis 
of credit dynamics and money markets. This 

line of research reviewed the desirability and 

feasibility of the policy principle of ﬁleaning 

against the windﬂ, i.e. of countering potentially 

costly asset price booms, as well as the optimal 

liquidity response during times of Þ nancial crisis. 
Research on the efÞ ciency of the 
Þ nancial system 
included two joint networks with the Center 
for Financial Studies (CFS), an independent 
research institute afÞ liated to the University of 
Frankfurt am Main. These networks focus on the 
integration and development of retail Þ nancial services and on Þ nancial modernisation. 
Regarding payment and settlement systems, the 
ECB began research work on the Single Euro 
Payments Area and TARGET2 under the umbrella of the Payment Economics Network. 
This network comprises the Bank of England, 
the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Chicago, the Bank of Canada, 
De Nederlandsche Bank and external academics, 
and is charged with promoting awareness of 
research undertaken on payment and securities 
settlement systems. The network™s website 24 provides links to working papers, relevant policy 
documents, details on upcoming and past 
conferences, and information on research 
projects in this area.Under the research priority related to international issues, the main areas of interest 
were globalisation and Þ nancial and trade 
linkages, and the international role of the euro. 
Globalisation and Þ nancial and trade linkages 
were the focus of two ECB research forums. 
Work on the international role of the euro 
focused on the analysis of the composition of 
foreign reserves across countries, the effect of 
international currencies on income differentials 
and the exchange rate pass-through, and the 
relationship between the exchange rate and 
world commodity prices. Furthermore, work 
continued on an international extension to the 
NAWM. On the Þ scal front, further work was undertaken 
on the development of tools for the monitoring and analysis of public Þ nances and their 
efÞ ciency and sustainability.
5.2 RESEARCH DISSEMINATION: PUBLICATIONS 
AND CONFERENCESAs in previous years, ECB staff research 
was published in the ECB™s Working 
Paper Series and Occasional Paper Series. 
156 Working Papers and 8 Occasional Papers Research forums are formal internal channels for sharing 22 experiences and results from ECB research projects on a speciÞ c topic.Research networks coordinate the research activities 23 of Eurosystem/ESCB researchers and help to disseminate the 
results. They may also involve external researchers.
http://www.paymenteconomics.org24 123ECBAnnual Report
2009were published in 2009. A total of 116 Working Papers were written or co-written by ECB 
staff, a large number together with Eurosystem 
economists, with the remainder written by 
external visitors attending conferences and 
workshops, working in the context of research 
networks or spending a prolonged period at the 
ECB for the completion of a research project. 
As is now the established norm, most of the 
papers are eventually expected to be published 
in leading, peer-reviewed academic journals. 
In 2009 ECB staff published 92 articles in 
academic journals.The Research Bulletin is a regular ECB publication which is used to disseminate 
research work of general interest to a wide 
audience. The March 2009 issue focused on the 
inß uence of the banking sector and credit on the 
transmission mechanism of monetary policy, the 
business cycle properties of the euro area and 
the use of global liquidity as an early warning 
indicator of boom/bust cycles. The ECB organised or co-organised a number of conferences and workshops on research 
topics. Co-organised conferences involved the 
Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), 
the BIS, and other central banks, both from the 
Eurosystem and from outside the Eurosystem. 
Furthermore, a large number of workshops and 
seminars were organised to disseminate research 
within the ECB. As in previous years, most of 
the conferences and workshops were related to 
speciÞ c research priority areas; the programmes 
for these events and the papers presented are 
available on the ECB™s website. The conferences and workshops covered a wide range of subjects. The links between Þ nancial stability and monetary policy were the focus of 
three of them, one of which was co-organised 
with the BIS and another with the CFS. Two 
additional conferences addressed different 
aspects of the workings of the money markets 
and the retail payment markets. A conference on 
exchange rates was co-organised with the Bank 
of Canada in June 2009. Finally, an ECB/CEPR 
conference on labour market issues was held in December. The Federal Reserve Board and the 
ECB co-hosted two conferences in October, one 
in Washington and the other in Frankfurt, in 
preparation for an update of the ﬁHandbook of 
Monetary Economicsﬂ. An additional, long-standing mechanism for the 
dissemination of research is the organisation of 
seminar series, of which two are of particular 
relevance: the Joint Lunchtime Seminars, 
co-organised with the Deutsche Bundesbank 
and the CFS, and the Invited Speaker Seminars. 
The two series comprise weekly seminars at 
which external researchers are invited to present 
their recent work at the ECB. The ECB also 
organises research seminars outside the scope of 
these two series on a more ad hoc basis.124ECBAnnual Report
20096 OTHER TASKS AND ACTIVITIES
6.1 COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITION 
OF MONETARY FINANCING AND PRIVILEGED 
ACCESSPursuant to Article 271(d) of the Treaty, the 
ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring the 
compliance of the 27 EU NCBs and the ECB 
with the prohibitions implied by Articles 123 
and 124 of the Treaty and Council Regulations 
(EC) Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93. Article 123 
prohibits the ECB and the NCBs from providing 
overdraft facilities or any other type of credit 
facility to governments and EU institutions 
or bodies, as well as from purchasing debt 
instruments directly from them. Article 124 
prohibits any measure, not based on prudential 
considerations, which establishes privileged 
access by governments and EU institutions 
or bodies to Þ nancial institutions. In parallel 
with the Governing Council, the European 
Commission monitors Member States™ 
compliance with the above provisions. The ECB also monitors the EU central banks™ secondary market purchases of debt instruments 
issued by the domestic public sector, the 
public sector of other Member States and EU 
institutions and bodies. According to the recitals 
of Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/93, the 
acquisition of public sector debt instruments 
in the secondary market must not be used to 
circumvent the objective of Article 123 of the 
Treaty. Such purchases should not become 
a form of indirect monetary Þ nancing of the 
public sector.The monitoring exercise conducted for 2009 conÞ rmed that the provisions of Articles 123 
and 124 of the Treaty and the related Council 
Regulations were in general respected.6.2 ADVISORY FUNCTIONS
Article 127(4) of the Treaty requires that the 
ECB be consulted on any proposed EU or 
national legislation falling within its Þ elds of 
competence.25 All ECB opinions are published on the ECB™s website. ECB opinions on proposed EU legislation are also published in 
the OfÞ cial Journal of the EU.
The ECB adopted 100 opinions in 2009: 
11 were in response to consultations by the 
EU institutions and 89 were in response to 
consultations by national authorities. This 
compares with 92 consultations in 2008. A list 
of the opinions adopted in 2009 and early 2010 
is annexed to this Annual Report. The following two ECB opinions issued at 
the request of the EU Council are particularly 

noteworthy. They concern the legislative package 

on European Þ nancial supervisory reform 
implementing the recommendations of the de 

Larosière Group.As part of this package, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation 
on Community macro-prudential oversight 
of the Þ nancial system and the establishment 
of a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), 
as well as a proposal for a Council decision 
entrusting the ECB with speciÞ c tasks concerning 
the functioning of the ESRB. In its opinion on 
these proposals,26 the ECB expressed its broad support for the proposed legal framework for the 
ESRB and indicated that it stood ready to ensure 
the performance of the secretariat function for 
the ESRB and to provide analytical, statistical, 
administrative and logistical support, drawing 
on technical advice from NCBs and supervisors. 
As stated in the opinion, the involvement of 
the ECB and the ESCB in the ESRB will not 
alter the primary objective of the ESCB under 
Article  127(1) of the Treaty, which is to 

maintain price stability. The ECB also expressed 

its support in the opinion for the Commission™s 

approach on a number of topics, namely 

the procedure for the issuance of and 

follow-up to risk warnings and
recommendations, the composition of the 

ESRB™s Steering Committee, the adoption of the 
The United Kingdom is exempt from the consultation obligation, 25 pursuant to the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
OJ C 115, 9.5.2008, p. 284.
CON/2009/88.26 125ECBAnnual Report
2009same procedures for the election of the ESRB™s 
Chair and Vice-Chair, the participation of the 

ECB™s President and Vice-President as voting 

members in the ESRB™s General Board, and 

the issue of inviting non-EU countries to attend 

certain ESRB and technical committee meetings 

(for more details on the ESRB, see Box 8). 
The second part of the above package relates to the Commission™s proposals for regulations 
establishing three new micro-prudential 
European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs): the 
European Banking Authority, the European 
Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority 
and the European Securities and Markets 
Authority. In its opinion on these proposals,27 the ECB welcomed the proposed institutional 
framework as well as the planned establishment 
of a single European rule book applicable to all 
Þ nancial institutions. The ECB expressed its 
strong support for efÞ cient institutional 
arrangements for cooperation between the ESAs 
and the ESRB and the close involvement of the 
ESRB within the new micro-prudential 
institutional framework. The ECB suggested a 
few amendments with a view to removing any 
obstacles to smooth ß ows of information between 
the ESRB and the European System of Financial 
Supervisors and ensuring the adequate 
institutional involvement and participation of the 
ECB and, where appropriate, the NCBs of the 
ESCB with regard to the ESAs and the 
newly established committees. The ECB also 
concluded that, when an NCB is a competent 
supervisory authority under national law, 
the performance of this task cannot constitute 
prohibited monetary Þ nancing. Insofar as the 
Þ nancing of each ESA consists in particular of 
obligatory contributions from competent national 
supervisory authorities, this conclusion also 
applies in the case of an NCB contributing to the 
revenues of the ESA, which, in such 
circumstances, would only involve the Þ nancing by the NCB of the performance of its own 
supervisory tasks.Prior to its opinions on the above reform, the ECB issued an opinion 28 on a proposal for a directive amending Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC as regards banks afÞ liated to central 
institutions, certain own funds items, large 
exposures, supervisory arrangements and crisis 
management. In its opinion, the ECB called for 
caution, in connection with the implementation 
of monetary policy, when designing measures 
to limit interbank exposures in order to ensure 
that such measures did not impair the smooth 
ß ow of liquidity within the interbank market. 
In addition, the ECB examined various issues 
relating to the implementation of European banking legislation, liquidity management, the exchange of information between central 
banks and supervisory authorities, colleges 
of supervisors and the European mandate of 
national supervisory authorities with regard 
to Þ nancial stability, as well as the proposed 
measures on capital requirements and risk 
management for securitisation.The ECB also issued an opinion 29 on a proposal for a regulation on credit rating agencies. While welcoming the proposed regulation, the ECB 
made a number of detailed comments, relating 
inter alia to the existing right of the Eurosystem 
under the Statute of the ESCB to deÞ ne the 
requirements of high credit standards for 
assets eligible for monetary policy operations 
and to determine the conditions for the use 
of credit ratings in central bank operations. 
The ECB also suggested exempting NCBs™ 
in-house credit assessment systems from the 
proposed regulation, and stated that there 
was a need to properly address the interaction 
between the regime for credit rating agencies 
under the proposed regulation and the process 
for recognising External Credit Assessment 
Institutions under Directive 2006/48/EC of 
the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and 
pursuit of the business of credit institutions 
(recast) 30. The ECB stressed the importance of appropriate gateways between competent 
authorities and central banks and made a 
number of recommendations on the proposed CON/2010/5.27 CON/2009/17.28 CON/2009/38.29 OJ L 177, 30.6.2006, p. 1.30 126ECBAnnual Report
2009establishment of a central repository by the Committee of European Securities Regulators. 
As regards the responsibility for the licensing 
and direct supervision of credit rating agencies, 
the ECB noted that the role of the Committee 
of European Securities Regulators should be 
reviewed in the light of the implementation of 
the de Larosière Group™s recommendations.The ECB responded to a record number of consultations by national authorities in 2009, 
which was to a large extent attributable to the 
Þ nancial crisis and to increased legislative 
activity in relation to Þ nancial markets. Some 
opinions concerned issues pertaining to the 
NCBs, such as amendments to the statutes of the 
Belgian, Bulgarian, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, 
Hungarian, Polish, Slovak and Spanish NCBs.31 Some of these consultations related to proÞ t distribution rules,32 in which context the ECB emphasised that Member States were obliged to 
safeguard the institutional and Þ nancial independence of their NCB. As noted in the 
opinion on amendments to the statute of 
Lietuvos bankas, this safeguard is particularly 
important in periods of crisis and, although the 
aim of the draft law may be to enhance the 
stability and credibility of the Þ nancial system, 
ad hoc changes reß ecting particular needs of 
certain shareholders would not be compatible 
with the Treaty or the Statute of the ESCB. 
Furthermore, in relation to central bank 
independence, the ECB issued two opinions 
concerning an Italian decree-law on the taxation 
of the Banca d™Italia™s gold reserves.33 The ECB noted that the provisions would result in 
transfers of the Banca d™Italia™s Þ nancial resources to the state budget and that any such 
transfers, either in the form of a proÞ t distribution 
scheme or in any equivalent form, would need 
to comply with the limitations imposed by the 
Treaty and, in particular, with the principle of 
central bank independence under Article 130 
and with the prohibition of monetary Þ nancing under Article 123(1).With regard to staff matters, the ECB provided opinions on a draft order applying to Deutsche 
Bundesbank staff  
34 and on Irish and Latvian draft laws applicable to public employees, 
including NCB staff 35. In line with earlier opinions, the ECB stressed the importance of 
NCB autonomy, meaning, inter alia, that an 
NCB may not be put in a position where the 
government could inß uence the NCB™s policy 
over staff matters. While the very difÞ cult economic circumstances and the need to stabilise 
public Þ nances were recognised in the Irish and Latvian cases, the ECB also stated that Member 
States may not impair an NCB™s ability to 
employ and retain the qualiÞ ed staff necessary 
to perform independently the tasks conferred on 
it by the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.In the area of payment and settlement systems, the ECB was consulted on several draft laws 
pertaining, inter alia, to payment institutions, 
the oversight of payment and settlement 
systems, operating requirements for clearing 
service providers and rules for clearing and 
settlement system operators.36 In the context of a Finnish draft law amending securities market 
legislation,37 in particular with regard to the licensing and operations of foreign clearing 
organisations, the ECB referred to its location 
policy, which is based on the premise that 
the Eurosystem needs to retain, in any event, 
ultimate control over the euro. Therefore, 
from both a general policy and a systemic risk 
perspective, the Eurosystem could not, as a 
matter of principle, accept that infrastructures 
located outside the euro area had the potential 
to develop into major infrastructures processing 
the euro. The ECB repeated this view on its 
location policy in an own-initiative opinion on 
a Dutch draft law concerning the supervision of 
clearing and settlement institutions.38CON/2009/4, CON/2009/90, CON/2009/13, CON/2009/89, 31 CON/2009/53, CON/2009/26, CON/2009/40, CON/2009/83, CON/2009/44, CON/2009/67, CON/2009/75, CON/2009/85 and

2009In the area of banknotes, the ECB was consulted 
on a Czech draft law on, inter alia, the circulation 
of banknotes and coins. In its opinion,39 the ECB 
provided clariÞ cations regarding hidden charges 
for the acceptance of cash. The ECB stated that 

banknotes and coins which are deÞ ned as ﬁlegal 
tenderﬂ must be accepted at full face value for 

the payment of goods and services, and that 

imposing a fee for the use of cash would put it at a 

disadvantage vis-à-vis other payment instruments.The ECB was consulted on the Luxembourg legal framework for the compilation of statistics 
and the role of the NCB in the Þ elds of balance of 
payments and Þ nancial accounts statistics 
40 and on the organisation and functioning of ofÞ cial statistics in Romania 41. The ECB stressed that the statistical framework should aim to optimise 
the quality and availability of ofÞ cial statistics 
while preserving the independence of the NCB.In connection with the global Þ nancial crisis, the 
ECB issued a large number of opinions,42 as it did 
in 2008, on proposed national rescue measures 
concerning state guarantees to Þ nancial 
institutions, the recapitalisation of banks, special 

support to deposit guarantee schemes and, 
in particular in the course of the second half of the 

year, the establishment of impaired asset schemes 

(such as those in Germany and Ireland 43).The ECB concluded that the proposed new 

schemes, or the extension of earlier schemes 

introduced in 2008, permitted the implementation 

of the single monetary policy and safeguarded 

the NCBs™ independence. Furthermore, the 

schemes were found to comply with the monetary 

Þ nancing prohibition, in particular in all cases 
where the proposed rescue operations foresaw 

a role for the respective NCB.At the end of 2009 the ECB was consulted on Belgian, French and Hungarian 44 draft laws 45 which included provisions on the establishment 
of national Þ nancial stability and/or systemic 
risk committees. The ECB noted that such 
committees could enhance the ability of NCBs 
and supervisory authorities to provide analytical 
support to the ESRB. The ECB also pointed 
out that it would be necessary to develop appropriate synergies and to avoid such national 
committees being entrusted with tasks and 
powers that potentially conß ict with those of the 
ESRB. Moreover, the legal frameworks of these 
committees should appropriately reß ect the 
roles of central banks and should not constrain 
the independence of the NCB governors or 
unduly affect the quality and impartiality of their 
contributions as members of the ESRB. Finally, 
in view of the importance of ensuring the 
effectiveness of macro-prudential supervisory 
arrangements at the EU level, the ECB concluded 
that it would be essential to safeguard the ability 
of the ESRB to perform its tasks independently 
and to guarantee an authoritative and effective 
channel for transmitting the warnings and 
recommendations issued by the ESRB.As of 2008 information regarding clear and 
important cases of non-compliance with the 

obligation to consult the ECB on draft national 

and EU legislation is also included in the Annual 

Report. The ECB understands ﬁclearﬂ to mean 

cases in which there is no legal doubt that 

the ECB should have been consulted, and 

ﬁimportantﬂ to mean cases i) in which, 

if consultation had taken place, the ECB would 

have made signiÞ cant critical comments on the 
substance of the legislative proposal; or ii) which 

are of general signiÞ cance to the ESCB.

CON/2009/54 and CON/2009/68.43 In the opinion on the draft Hungarian legislation (CON/2010/10), 44 the ECB also reminded the Hungarian authorities to consult the 
ECB at an appropriate stage in the legislative process in order to 
afford the ECB sufÞ cient time to examine the draft legislative 
provisions and to adopt its opinion, also enabling the relevant 
national authorities to take the ECB™s opinion into consideration 
before the provisions are adopted.
CON/2010/7, CON/2010/3 and CON/2010/10.45 128ECBAnnual Report
2009In 2009 the ECB recorded 12 cases of non-consultation on proposed national 
legislation, including two cases in which the 
ECB issued an own-initiative opinion. Of these 
12 cases of non-consultation, the following 
11 were considered clear and important.First, the ECB decided to submit an own-initiative opinion on the proposed Irish 
Financial Emergency Measures in the Public 
Interest Bill 2009,46 since the draft law had direct implications for the Central Bank and Financial 
Services Authority of Ireland and also raised 
serious concerns regarding central bank 
independence, especially personal independence, 
an issue of general signiÞ cance to the ESCB.
The second own-initiative opinion related to 
the Dutch draft law on the introduction of 
prudential supervision of clearing and settlement 
institutions. The ECB had been consulted on 
an earlier draft in 2007 which, however, did 
not include provisions concerning clearing 
and settlement institutions established in 
another state. Since these new provisions were 
substantial and pertained to, inter alia, the ECB™s 
location policy, which is referred to above, the 
ECB decided to issue an own-initiative opinion.The Hungarian draft law relating to payment 
service providers and payment services primarily 

concerned the implementation of Directive 

2007/64/EC. However, it also contained 

provisions relating, in particular, to the Magyar 

Nemzeti Bank and the principle of central bank 

independence, and thus remained of general 

signiÞ cance to the ESCB. Although the ECB was 
not consulted, the draft law was amended in the 

legislative process with regard to the issues on 

which the ECB would have been likely to make 

critical comments. In another Hungarian case, 

the draft law concerning, inter alia, the Magyar 

Nemzeti Bank™s tasks, the structure and legal 

status of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory 

Authority and the establishment of the Financial 

Stability Council was submitted for consultation 

but enacted before the ECB had an opportunity to 

respond to the consultation request.47The ECB was not consulted on a Slovak draft law 
relating to currency matters and introducing, inter 
alia, for a limited period of time, a prohibition 
on any fees or other similar measures for credit 
institutions applicable to cash deposits. Since the 
draft law raises issues with regard to euro coins 
in the context of the introduction of the euro, it is 
of general signiÞ cance to the ESCB.
Finally, with regard to rescue measures 
undertaken by Member States during the 
Þ nancial market crisis, the ECB was not 
consulted in six cases, namely by the Belgian, 
Finnish, Latvian, Swedish, Hungarian and Greek 
authorities. The ECB considers such crisis-
related legislation to be of general signiÞ cance to the ESCB. The ECB was, however, consulted 
on the vast majority of rescue measures, thus 
the failure to consult concerned only relatively 
few cases, which mainly related to legislation 
amending or extending measures on which the 
ECB had already been consulted.6.3 ADMINISTRATION OF THE BORROWING 
AND LENDING OPERATIONS OF THE 

EUROPEAN UNIONIn accordance with Article 21.2 of the Statute 
of the ESCB, together with Article 9 of Council 
Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002 

as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) 
No 431/2009 of 18 May 2009, the ECB 

continues to have responsibility for the 
administration of the borrowing and lending 
operations of the EU under the medium-term 
Þ nancial assistance mechanism as set out in 
Decision ECB/2003/14 of 7 November 2003 
as amended by Decision ECB/2009/17 of 
19 June 2009. In 2009 the ECB received Þ ve disbursement payments on behalf of the EU 
and transferred these amounts to the borrower 
countries (Romania, Hungary and Latvia). For 
two of the loans, interest payments became due 
and were processed by the ECB accordingly. CON/2009/15.46 See CON/2010/10 and footnote 44 above.47 129ECBAnnual Report
2009The total amount of outstanding EU lending operations under the medium-term Þ nancial assistance mechanism as at 31 December 2009 
was •9.2 billion.6.4 EUROSYSTEM RESERVE MANAGEMENT 
SERVICESIn 2009 a comprehensive set of services 
continued to be offered under the framework 
established in 2005 for the management of 
Eurosystem customers™ euro-denominated 
reserve assets. The complete set of services Œ 
which is available to central banks, monetary 
authorities and government agencies located 
outside the euro area, as well as to international 
organisations Œ is offered under harmonised 
terms and conditions in line with general market 
standards by individual Eurosystem central banks 
(the Eurosystem service providers). The ECB 
performs an overall coordination role, ensuring 
the smooth functioning of the framework. The 
number of customers maintaining a business 
relationship with the Eurosystem remained 
stable over 2009. With respect to the services 
themselves, there was a sizeable increase in 
customers™ total cash balances and securities 
holdings, mainly due, in the second part of 
the year, to the inclusion in the framework of 
investments in Þ xed-term euro-denominated 
deposits on a principal basis. The enhanced 
framework is reß ected in Guideline ECB/2006/4 
as amended on 28 May 2009 (ECB/2009/11).The new ECB premises: simulated view of the former Grossmarkthalle with the new conference centre to the left.CHAPTER 3FINANCIAL STABILITY 
AND INTEGRATION132ECBAnnual Report
20091 FINANCIAL STABILITY
The ESCB contributes to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent national 
authorities relating to the prudential supervision 
of credit institutions and the stability of the 
Þ nancial system. It also offers advice to these 
authorities and the European Commission on 
the scope and implementation of EU legislation 
in these Þ elds. 1.1 FINANCIAL STABILITY MONITORING 
The ECB, in collaboration with the ESCB™s 
Banking Supervision Committee (BSC), aims to 
safeguard the stability of the Þ nancial system.
1 Key activities are monitoring risks to Þ nancial stability and assessing the Þ nancial system™s 
shock-absorbing capacity. The main focus is on 
banks, as they are still the primary intermediaries 
of funds. At the same time, the increasing 
importance of Þ nancial markets and other 
Þ nancial institutions and their linkages with 
banks means that vulnerabilities in these 
components of the Þ nancial system are also 
monitored by the ESCB. In early 2009 the further deterioration in the 
macro-Þ nancial environment and reduced 
growth prospects added to the stresses on the 

euro area Þ nancial system. In this period, high 
uncertainty about the severity of the credit 

cycle downturn and a weakening outlook for 

bank earnings weighed on investor conÞ dence 
in the resilience of banks and other Þ nancial 
institutions. However, the extraordinary 

remedial measures taken by governments 

and central banks worldwide from late 2008 

onwards contributed to lowering systemic risk, 

which in turn led to a signiÞ cant recovery in 
Þ nancial markets, characterised by falling risk 
premia across most asset classes. The rebound 

in Þ nancial markets was further supported by 
signs of economic recovery as of the second 

half of 2009. Overall, these developments 

have contributed favourably to the outlook 

for Þ nancial stability in the euro area since 
the second quarter of 2009, although, as noted 

below, there remain grounds for caution in 

assessing the outlook. 
The substantial recovery in Þ nancial markets 
also provided a boost to the performance of 
large and complex banking groups (LCBGs) 
in the euro area in 2009. Banks™ trading results 
recovered after the heavy losses suffered in 
2008, while the resurgence of capital market 
issuance activity helped banks to keep their 
net fee and commission income relatively 
stable. Another important factor contributing 
to the recovery in earnings was the increase 
in net interest income boosted inter alia by 
the steeper yield curve, euro area LCBGs™ 
strong public debt purchases and wider lending 
margins, despite the compression in deposit 
margins. Furthermore, most LCBGs continued 
their efforts to cut costs and to streamline and 
restructure their business models. At the same 
time, this improvement in income was partially 
offset by an increase in loan-loss provisions, 
which was substantial and broad-based across 
institutions. The recovery in euro area LCBGs™ 
earnings, together with a slowdown in the growth 
rate of assets and increases in capital, from 
both public and private sources, contributed to 
raising median regulatory capital ratios above 
pre-crisis levels. It is, however, noteworthy that 
the dispersion between the strongest and the 
weakest performing banks among the group of 
LCBGs increased. The extraordinary remedial actions taken by central banks and governments from late 2008 
onwards were successful in restoring conÞ dence in and improving the resilience of euro area and 
global Þ nancial systems. With the exception 
of extended deposit insurance coverage, the 
measures taken by euro area governments 
fall into three main categories: i) guarantees 
for bank liabilities, ii) capital injections, 
and iii) asset support schemes. In total, 
euro area governments provided around Since the end of 2004 the ECB has published its Financial 1 Stability Review, a semi-annual report on the stability of the euro area Þ nancial system. In 2009 it also published its annual 
report on EU banking sector stability, as well as ad hoc reports 
on ﬁCredit default swaps and counterparty riskﬂ and ﬁEU 
banks™ funding structures and policiesﬂ. In January 2010 it 
published structural indicators for the EU banking sector. These 
publications present the main Þ ndings of the monitoring by the 
BSC of the structure and stability of the banking sector, and are

of recapitalisation measures has been relatively 
widespread, while the effective issuance of bank 
bonds with government guarantees has been 
considerably lower than the guarantees made 
available by governments. However, the volume 
and use of liability guarantees in absolute 
Þ gures are much higher than those of capital 
injections. Asset support measures have only 
been adopted by a few countries. Furthermore, 
it seems that some of the largest euro area banks 
have received the most considerable share of the 
Þ nancial support measures. About half of the 
support extended across each type of measure 
for the entire euro area has been absorbed by 
the three largest recipient institutions. For each 
individual support measure, the largest three 
recipients together represent between 6% and 
9% in terms of total euro area banking assets. Notwithstanding the improvement in euro area LCBGs™ earnings in 2009, the outlook for 
euro area banking system stability is clouded 
by signiÞ cant risks. First, the continued 
deterioration in the quality of bank loans and the 
prospect of increasing loan losses imply that the 
net proÞ ts of many euro area banks are likely to 
remain under pressure for some time to come. 
Furthermore, there are reasons to be cautious 
about the durability of the recent recovery in 
banks™ proÞ tability, since the extraordinarily 
supportive environment for investment banking 
activities is unlikely to persist as market 
conditions begin to normalise. At the same time, 
net interest income is vulnerable to a ß attening of the yield curve. In addition, the interdependence of prospects for Þ nancial stability and those for 
Þ scal sustainability, created by government measures 
to support the Þ nancial sector, 
Þ scal stimulus 
measures and weak economic activity, is also 
a source of risk. Overall, the challenges facing 
the euro area banking sector in the period ahead call for caution with regard to the timing of the 
withdrawal of public support. In particular, exit 
decisions by governments will need to carefully 
balance the risks of exiting too early against 
those of exiting too late. Exiting before the 
underlying strength of key Þ nancial institutions 
is sufÞ ciently well established runs the risk of 
leaving some of them vulnerable to adverse 
disturbances, possibly even triggering renewed 
Þ nancial system stress. Late exits, on the other 
hand, can entail the risk of distorting competition, 
creating the moral hazard risks that accompany 
downside protection Œ including the possibility 
of excessive risk-taking Œ and exacerbating the 
risks for public Þ nances. Finally, some banks, 
especially those which have received state 
support, may need fundamental restructuring 
in order to conÞ rm their long-term viability 
when such support is no longer available. Such 
restructuring is already under way for some 
large banks of the euro area.Turning to other Þ nancial institutions, the 
euro area insurance sector continued to face challenging conditions during 2009. Financial 
performance remained subdued, as premium 
growth was ß at on average in the 
Þ rst half of 
2009 and some insurers continued to report large 
reductions in premiums written. The continued 
uncertainty in equity and credit markets 
reduced demand for life insurance products, 
in particular unit-linked products Œ where the 
investment risk is borne by the policyholder Œ 
and contributed to lower premiums written. On 
the other hand, investment income beneÞ ted from the improvements in capital markets after 
mid-March 2009, and in the Þ rst half of 2009 
was higher on average than in the previous 
year. The improvements in investment income 
were, however, not enough to avoid a broad-
based decline in proÞ tability. Nevertheless, 
the capital positions of insurers improved 
in the Þ rst half of 2009, owing in part to the 
rebound in capital markets which led to a 
recouping of some of the unrealised losses 
incurred in 2008. Looking ahead, while some 
risks facing insurers Œ in particular investment 
risks Œ have decreased somewhat, other risks 
remain, in particular those associated with low 134ECBAnnual Report
2009government bond yields and a weak economic environment. This risk outlook notwithstanding, 
available information on the solvency positions 
of euro area insurers suggests that they have, 
on average, a reasonable amount of remaining 
shock-absorption capacity.Following broad-based losses in the hedge fund 
sector across most investment strategies in 2008, 

the strength of investment returns in 2009 meant 

that a substantial fraction of the losses incurred by 

the sector in 2008 were recouped. Furthermore, 

funding liquidity pressures and the associated 

risk of forced asset sales seem to have abated in 

the hedge fund sector. Strong average investment 

performances contributed to a gradual reversal of 

investment outß ows, which decreased in the 
second and third quarters of 2009 as compared 

with the Þ rst quarter. In addition, some preliminary 
data suggest that the third quarter of 2009 may 

mark the end of sector-wide investment outß ows. 
The recovery in Þ nancial markets has also led to 
higher levels of leverage, which, however, rose 

from very low levels and at the end of 2009 still 

appeared to be lower than at the end of 2007. 
1.2 FINANCIAL STABILITY ARRANGEMENTS 
In December 2008 the Economic and Financial 

Committee (EFC) mandated a High-Level Working 

Group on Cross-Border Financial Stability 

Arrangements, in which the ECB participated, 

to identify the lessons to be learned from recent 

developments for Þ nancial stability arrangements 
in the EU. The report issued by the group in 

July 2009 made a number of recommendations 

regarding EU policy coordination, the sharing 

of Þ scal costs, and cooperation between home 
and host country authorities in crisis situations.2 In addition, the European Commission initiated 

reviews and put forward proposals for enhancing 

EU legislation in areas such as banking 

supervision, bank resolution regimes and deposit 

guarantee schemes. 
The ECB contributed to the European Commission™s public consultation on the review 

of Directive 94/19/EC on deposit guarantee 
schemes in August 2009. The Eurosystem™s stance 

is based on two main principles. First, deposit 

guarantee schemes are an important part of the 

safety net, and their role in promoting Þ nancial 
stability and public conÞ dence in the 
Þ nancial 
system should therefore be strengthened. Second, 

they play a role in achieving a single market 

for Þ nancial services, including the promotion 
of a level playing Þ eld for internationally 
active banks, which calls for a higher level of 

harmonisation of such schemes in the EU.On 20 October 2009 the ECOFIN Council adopted 
broad conclusions 
3 on the strengthening of EU 
arrangements to ensure Þ nancial stability and 
provide crisis management in the event of a future 

Þ nancial crisis. It also endorsed a roadmap which 
sets out the priorities for further work on 

strengthening EU Þ nancial supervision, stability 
and regulation. These priorities include action on: 

i) the supervisory framework, ii) the framework 

for crisis prevention, management and resolution,
iii) the regulatory framework, and iv) the promotion 

of the integrity of Þ nancial markets. In addition, 
the ECOFIN Council requested that the EFC 

consider the development of practical arrangements 

to enhance EU-wide policy coordination in 

cross-border crisis prevention, management and 

resolution, and that it carry out further work to 

explore the pros and cons of ex ante and ex post 

burden-sharing arrangements, as well as possible 

principles, criteria and procedures that could be 

applied in a crisis in the event that government 

support becomes necessary.On 2 December 2009 the ECOFIN Council 
recalled these broad conclusions and on that basis 

welcomed the preparatory analysis carried out by 

the European Commission in its communication 

on an EU framework for cross-border crisis 

management in the banking sector, which covers 

the three main areas of early intervention, bank 

resolution measures and insolvency proceedings. 

The ECOFIN Council also agreed on a number of 

directions for further work to be conducted by the

the preparatory work undertaken in relation to 

cooperation and increased preparedness for 

ex post burden-sharing, as appropriate. It invited 

the European Commission, the Financial Services 

Committee and the EFC to present concrete 

proposals on these topics in the Þ rst half of 2010.

20092 FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
2.1 GENERAL ISSUES
Following the deepening of the Þ nancial crisis 
in autumn 2008, concrete steps were taken in 2009 to identify improvements that should be 
made to the institutional supervisory framework. 
At the EU level, the report of the de Larosière 
Group, published in February 2009, put forward 
proposals to improve the arrangements for 
Þ nancial supervision in the EU. On the basis of the 
report, the European Commission in May 2009 
issued a communication on European Þ nancial supervision, which set out the proposed steps for 
enhancing EU supervisory arrangements. These 
were broadly endorsed by the ECOFIN Council 
on 9 June 2009 and the European Council on 
18-19 June. On 23 September the European 
Commission published legislative proposals 5 on the setting-up of a new institutional 
supervisory framework in the EU, composed of 
the following two pillars.6First, a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) 
is to be established. Under the Commission™s 
legislative proposals, the ESRB will be 
responsible for the macro-prudential oversight 
of the Þ nancial system within the EU, thus 
contributing to the prevention or mitigation 
of systemic risks within the Þ nancial system 
(for more details, see Box 8).Second, a European System of Financial 
Supervisors (ESFS) will be established. Under 

the Commission™s proposals, the ESFS will be 

an integrated network comprising the national 

Þ nancial supervisors and three new European 
Supervisory Authorities (ESAs): the European 

Banking Authority (EBA), the European 

Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) 

and the European Insurance and Occupational 

Pensions Authority (EIOPA). The latter will be 

created by transforming the existing supervisory 

committees (established in the context of Level 3
of the Lamfalussy framework for Þ nancial 
regulation and supervision) into ESAs. The tasks 

of the three ESAs will include: i) contributing 

to the establishment of high-quality common 

regulatory and supervisory standards, in particular 

by developing draft technical standards to 
be endorsed by the European Commission 

to make them legally binding, ii) contributing 

to a consistent application of EU legislation, 

inter alia by engaging in mediation 7 between 
national supervisory authorities, promoting the 
coherent functioning of colleges of supervisors 

and taking actions in emergency situations, 

iii) cooperating closely with the ESRB, 

iv) conducting peer reviews of supervisory 

authorities to strengthen consistency in 

supervisory outcomes, and v) monitoring and 

assessing market developments. The European 

Commission also proposed to make targeted 

changes to existing Þ nancial services legislation 
to ensure that the new supervisory authorities can 

work effectively.8The European Commission™s legislative 
proposals, on which the ECB was consulted,9 will have to be adopted by both the European 
Parliament and the EU Council through the 
co-decision legislative procedure. At its meeting 
on 18-19 June 2009, the European Council 
urged the ECOFIN Council to adopt the 
legislative proposals swiftly so that the new EU 
supervisory structures could be put fully in place 
in the course of 2010.Available on the European Commission™s website 5 (http://ec.europa.eu). For more detailed information on the institutional genesis of 6 the proposals for the establishment of the new supervisory 
framework, see Chapter 4.
This mediation will be binding, subject to the qualiÞ cation in the 
7 ECOFIN Council™s general approach that the decisions taken by 
the ESAs should not have any effect on the Þ scal responsibilities 
of the Member States.
Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of 8 the Council amending Directives 1998/26/EC, 2002/87/EC, 
2003/6/ EC, 2003/41/EC, 2003/71/EC, 2004/39/EC, 2004/109/EC,
2005/60/EC, 2006/48/EC, 2006/49/EC and 2009/65/EC in 
respect of the powers of the European Banking Authority, the 
European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and 
the European Securities and Markets Authority.
See the opinion of the ECB of 26 October 2009 on a proposal for 9 a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on 
Community macro-prudential oversight of the Þ nancial system 
and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board and a proposal 
for a Council decision entrusting the European Central Bank 
with speciÞ c tasks concerning the functioning of the European 
Systemic Risk Board (CON/2009/88); and the opinion of the 
ECB of 8 January 2010 on three proposals for regulations of the 
European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European 
Banking Authority, a European Insurance and Occupational 
Pensions Authority and a European Securities and Markets 
Authority (CON/2010/5).137ECBAnnual Report
2009On 20 October 2009 the ECOFIN Council 
reached a broad agreement on the two 

legislative texts concerning the ESRB. 

Subsequently, on 2 December 2009, the 

ECOFIN Council agreed on a compromise 

proposal on the draft regulations concerning 

the establishment of the three ESAs, which 
also include certain provisions that are of 

relevance for the establishment of the ESRB 

(for example, relating to the collection of 

information from the ESAs). The Presidency 

of the EU Council started negotiations with the 

European Parliament, with a view to reaching 

an agreement in 2010.Box 8 
 THE CREATION OF THE EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ECB 
 1 Macro-prudential oversight and systemic riskA number of central banks throughout the world have a role in safeguarding the stability of the Þ nancial system in their respective jurisdictions. In the EU, the ESCB contributes to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision 
of credit institutions and the stability of the Þ nancial system. The 
Þ nancial crisis has clearly 
illustrated the need for a better understanding and monitoring of systemic risk, especially with 
regard to Þ nancial system interdependencies, and has exposed signi
Þ cant shortcomings with 
regard to the effective analysis of available information and awareness of the key Þ nancial vulnerabilities. Macro-prudential oversight focuses on the Þ nancial system as a whole, by contrast with the 
supervision of individual Þ nancial institutions. Macro-prudential oversight is thus very closely 
related to the concept of systemic risk, which may arise from the collective behaviour of Þ nancial institutions, from their interaction and from interlinkages between the Þ nancial sector and the 
real economy. 2 Tasks of the ESRB
Under the European Commission™s legislative proposals, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), a new independent body, will be responsible for the macro-prudential oversight of the 
Þ nancial system in the EU. It will have the following tasks: i) to determine, collect and analyse all the information relevant for its mission, ii) to identify and prioritise systemic risks, iii) to issue 
warnings where such systemic risks are deemed to be signiÞ cant, iv) to issue recommendations 
for remedial action in response to the risks identiÞ ed, and v) to monitor the follow-up to warnings 
and recommendations. In pursuing its mandate, the ESRB will be expected to cooperate closely with the European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS). In particular, it will provide the European Supervisory 
Authorities (ESAs) with the information on systemic risks that they need to fulÞ l their tasks. 
Conversely, the ESAs are required to cooperate closely with the ESRB, in particular by providing 
the necessary information for the fulÞ lment of the tasks of the ESRB and by ensuring a proper 
follow-up to its warnings and recommendations. Cooperation between the ESRB and international 
institutions such as the IMF and the Financial Stability Board will also take place, as well as with 
the relevant bodies outside the EU on matters related to macro-prudential oversight.138ECBAnnual Report
20092.2 BANKINGThe London summit of the G20 Heads of State or Government in April 2009 was a milestone 
for Þ nancial regulation and supervision as it 
reß ected the commitment of the G20 leaders to 
strengthen regulatory standards as soon as 
economic recovery is assured. To this end, the 
G20 agreed to increase banks™ capital buffers 
above regulatory minima, to enhance the quality 
of capital, and to develop recommendations to 
mitigate pro-cyclicality.10 Furthermore, they agreed to introduce a non-risk-based capital 
ratio to contain leverage and a global framework 
for promoting stronger liquidity buffers. 
Finally, they decided to reÞ ne the incentives for 
the management of securitisation risks. Against this background, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee), 
in which the ECB participates as an observer, DeÞ ned as the capacity of the system to amplify economic 
10 ß uctuations.3 Involvement of the ECBUnder the Commission™s legislative proposals, the ECB is entrusted with the task of ensuring the performance of the secretariat function for the ESRB, and thereby of providing analytical, 
statistical, administrative and logistical support to the ESRB. In accordance with the draft 
legislation, the mission of the secretariat of the ESRB will include, in particular, preparing for 
ESRB meetings; collecting and processing information in support of the tasks of the ESRB; 
preparing the necessary analyses, also drawing on the technical advice of NCBs and supervisors; 
supporting the ESRB at the administrative level in its international cooperation with other 
relevant bodies on macro-prudential issues; and supporting the work of the General Board, the 
Steering Committee and the Advisory Technical Committee.The ESRB will beneÞ t from the expertise of NCBs and supervisory authorities, in particular through their participation in the Advisory Technical Committee to be established as part of the ESRB structure. The committee will provide advice and assistance on technical issues related to 
the work of the ESRB.In its opinion on these proposals,1 the ECB expressed its broad support of the proposed legal framework for the ESRB and indicated its readiness to support the ESRB and to ensure the performance of its secretariat function. Moreover, the ESRB will beneÞ t from 
the macroeconomic, Þ nancial and monetary expertise of all EU central banks, through the 
participation of the members of the General Council of the ECB in the General Board of the 
ESRB. The involvement of the ECB and the ESCB in the functioning of the ESRB will not alter 
the primary objective of the ESCB under Article 127 of the Treaty, which is to maintain price 
stability.In order to support the work of the ESRB, the ECB shall ensure sufÞ cient human and 
Þ nancial resources for the fulÞ lment of its task of ensuring the secretariat. The ECB will also enhance 
its existing capabilities for monitoring and assessing risks to Þ nancial stability. The ECB 
will moreover support the ESRB by developing and maintaining new analytical tools and methodologies for the identiÞ cation and assessment of systemic risks and the issuance of early 
risk warnings. 1 For more details on this opinion (CON/2009/88), see Section 6.2 of Chapter 2.
139ECBAnnual Report
2009adopted an ambitious and comprehensive plan with the aim of further strengthening banking 
regulation and supervision. In July 2009 
the Committee published its enhancements 
to the Basel II capital framework. These 
enhancements concern increased capital 
requirements for trading book exposures 
and resecuritisations as well as for liquidity 
lines and credit lines provided to off-balance-
sheet entities. In addition, standards are raised 
regarding the internal analysis and disclosure 
of securitisation exposures, and compensation 
and risk management practices. Finally, in
December 2009 the Basel Committee, 
in line with the mandate of the G20, published 

consultation documents on raising the quality of 
capital, introducing a non-risk-based leverage 
ratio to supplement the Basel II framework, 
as well as frameworks for liquidity risk and 
counter-cyclical capital buffers.In line with the work of the Basel Committee, 
the European Commission adopted in July 2009 

a proposal amending the Capital Requirements 

Directive.11 The ECB was consulted on this 
proposal and published an opinion on it on 

12 November 2009.12 Overall, in its legal opinion 
the ECB supported the proposed amendments and 

suggested that the requirements of the proposed 

directive be even more closely aligned with the 

revised Basel II market risk framework, in order 

to ensure fair international competition in this area. 

Furthermore, the ECB proposed incorporating in the 

provisions for remuneration policies the guidance 

developed by the Financial Stability Board.13 Finally, the ECB recommended applying the 

provisions for remuneration policies at the banking 

group level to ensure that risk-taking employees of 

EU banks are treated consistently. 
2.3 SECURITIESThe Þ nancial crisis raised concerns as to the 
reliability and transparency of ratings provided 
by credit rating agencies and potential conß icts of interest associated with their activities. 
The G20 therefore agreed in April 2009 to 
extend regulatory oversight and registration to rating agencies to ensure that they meet the Code 
of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating 
Agencies of the International Organization of 
Securities Commissions. In the EU, the European 
Parliament and the EU Council approved on 
23 April 2009 a Regulation on rating agencies,14 which establishes that all rating agencies 
must be registered with and supervised by the 
competent authorities of the relevant Member 
States. It also introduces requirements related 
to dealing with conß icts of interest, ensuring the 
quality of ratings and increasing transparency for 
the users of ratings. The ECB broadly welcomed 
the Regulation in its opinion of April 2009,15 stating as a general comment that more clarity 
regarding the exact scope of the Regulation and 
its regulatory purposes was needed. The G20 also agreed that hedge funds should be 
subject to mandatory registration and information 

disclosure. To this end, the 
European Commission 

put forward in April 2009 a proposal for a directive 

on alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs), 
including those of hedge funds, which would 

require AIFMs above a certain size to be authorised 

and subject to ongoing supervision and to comply 

with a set of regulatory standards contained in the 

proposed directive. Only if these conditions were 

fulÞ lled could an AIFM market funds to 
professional investors across the EU. In its opinion 

on the proposed directive,16 the ECB supported the 
Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the 11 Council amending Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC as regards capital requirements for the trading book and for 
resecuritisations, and the supervisory review of remuneration 
policies. 
Opinion of the European Central Bank of 12 November 2009 on a 
12 proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council 

amending Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC as regards capital 

requirements for the trading book and for resecuritisations, and the 

supervisory review of remuneration policies (CON/2009/94).

2009establishment of a harmonised framework covering 
AIFMs in the EU, but at the same time stressed the 

importance of establishing a globally coordinated 

framework. The opinion also suggested that some 

provisions could be further tailored to reß ect the 
differences between the funds that fall within the 

scope of the proposed directive. Furthermore, the 

ECB proposed that, when implementing measures 

were adopted, further thought be given to reporting 

requirements vis-à-vis the competent authorities 

and leverage limits that take the full risk proÞ le of 
the hedge funds into account while not excessively 

hindering their investment ß exibility.2.4 ACCOUNTINGThe main developments with regard to 
accounting in 2009 related to the international 
convergence of accounting standards and 
improvements to address weaknesses identiÞ ed in the wake of the Þ nancial crisis. Action was 
taken in these areas with a view to making 
signiÞ cant progress towards a single set of 
harmonised standards.In response to the Þ nancial reporting-related issues 
raised by the Þ nancial crisis, the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the US 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) 

set up the Financial Crisis Advisory Group 

in December 2008, to the work of which the 

ECB contributed in the course of 2009. The 

group will advise the two boards on the standard-
setting implications of the global Þ nancial crisis 
and potential changes to the global regulatory 

environment.In April 2009 the FASB amended the accounting rules applicable to the non-temporary 
impairment of debt securities such that, 
by contrast with the approach of the 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs), only credit-related impairment losses 
would be recognised in earnings. This would 
mean that US banks and EU banks would 
account differently for losses on these securities 
in their net income. The ECB and the European 
Commission voiced concerns that this divergent treatment compromised the level playing Þ eld and called on the IASB to resolve the issue 
before the end of 2009.In March 2009 the IASB published an exposure draft on derecognition, with proposed amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7,17 which would have a signiÞ cant impact on the 
accounting treatment of repurchase agreements 
(repos). Given the importance of this market for 
central banks and the banking industry, 
the Eurosystem highlighted that the amendments 

would raise issues related to the level playing 
Þ eld between EU and US banks and could have a negative impact on banks™ business models 
and the European market for repos. The IASB 
was thus invited to reassess the proposed 
amendments concerning repos.The Eurosystem also provided comments to the IASB on the latter™s exposure draft 
on the classiÞ cation and measurement of 
Þ nancial instruments. Issues raised by the 
Eurosystem included the need for the IASB 
to give greater prominence to the institution™s 
business model, to allow for the possibility of 
reclassifying Þ nancial instruments in exceptional 
circumstances and to intensify collaboration 
with the FASB with a view to achieving 
consistent treatment.The IASB also issued for public consultation an exposure draft on impairment with a view 
to implementing the G20 recommendation 
that accounting standard-setters strengthen the 
accounting recognition of loan-loss provisions 
by incorporating a broader range of available 
credit information. Another important development was the establishment of the IASB dialogue with 
prudential authorities and market regulators, 
including the ECB, under the aegis of the 
Financial Stability Board, on Þ nancial institution 
reporting issues. This was a direct response 
to the G20 call for the IASB to improve the 
involvement of stakeholders.Available on the IASB™s website (http://www.iasb.org).17 141ECBAnnual Report
2009A high-level working group on the G20 accounting recommendations was set up by 
the Basel Committee in April 2009. The group, 
in which the ECB participates, issued guiding 
principles in August 2009 for the revision of 
accounting standards for Þ nancial instruments, 
to assist the IASB in addressing issues relating 
to provisioning, fair value measurement and 
related disclosures.142ECBAnnual Report
2009The Eurosystem contributes to enhancing European Þ nancial integration by i) raising 
awareness of and monitoring Þ nancial integration, ii) acting as a catalyst for private 
sector activities by facilitating collective 
action, iii) giving advice on the legislative and 
regulatory framework for the Þ nancial system 
and direct rule-making, and iv) providing 
central banking services that foster Þ nancial integration. RAISING AWARENESS OF AND MONITORING 

FINANCIAL INTEGRATION 
In April 2009 the ECB published its third annual 

report on ﬁFinancial integration in Europeﬂ.
The main purpose of the report is to contribute to 

the advancement of European Þ nancial integration 
and to raise public awareness of the Eurosystem™s 

role in supporting this process, providing 

information about the state of integration and 

therefore an empirical basis for policy measures 

to further foster Þ nancial integration. The report 
Þ rst assesses the state of 
Þ nancial integration, 
based on a set of indicators that are also 

published semi-annually on the ECB™s website. 

In 2009 these indicators were further developed 

to include indicators of Þ nancial development. 
The report then analyses in detail three selected 

issues: i) the impact of the Þ nancial crisis on 
euro area Þ nancial integration, ii) institutional 
investors and Þ nancial integration, and 
iii) the Þ nancing of small and medium-sized 
enterprises and young innovative companies in 

Europe. The report concludes with an overview 

of the Eurosystem™s contribution towards the 

achievement of more integrated and developed 

Þ nancial markets in Europe.
The ECB continued its involvement in the 
Research Network on Capital Markets and 
Financial Integration in Europe, which brings 
together academics, market participants and 
policy-makers and is run in cooperation with the 
Center for Financial Studies at the University 
of Frankfurt. The network™s 12th conference on 
ﬁLearning from the crisis: Financial stability, 
macroeconomic policy and international 
institutionsﬂ was hosted by the Einaudi 
Institute for Economics and Finance in Rome on 12-13 November 2009. As in previous years, 
the ECB awarded Þ ve ﬁLamfalussy Fellowshipsﬂ 
to young researchers in the context of the network. 
The network™s current priorities are: i) Þ nancial systems as risk managers, risk distributors and 
risk creators, ii) the integration and development 
of retail Þ nancial services and the promotion of 
innovative Þ rms, and iii) 
Þ nancial modernisation 
and governance and the integration of 
the European Þ nancial system into global 
capital markets. ACTING AS A CATALYST FOR PRIVATE SECTOR 

ACTIVITIES 
The Eurosystem continued to support the Single 
Euro Payments Area (SEPA) initiative, which 
allows individuals, corporations and public 
administrations to make cashless payments in 
euro throughout the participating countries from 
a single account using a single set of payment 
instruments as easily, efÞ ciently and safely as in 
national payments. The SEPA direct debit was 
launched successfully in November 2009, by 
which time more than 2,500 banks had signed 
up to offer this Þ rst truly European direct debit 
payment service. This marked the second 
milestone after the launch of the SEPA credit 
transfer in January 2008. A joint statement 18 by the European Commission and the ECB 
provided the industry with further clarity on the 
future business model for the SEPA direct debit 
scheme. The Eurosystem monitors migration 
towards the use of SEPA payment instruments 
on the basis of ﬁSEPA indicatorsﬂ 19. The SEPA credit transfer accounted for 6.2% of total euro 
credit transfer payments in January 2010, which 
indicates that it is now being used not only for 
cross-border payments 20 but also for domestic transactions.The introduction of the SEPA credit transfer and direct debit has laid the foundations on 
which further innovations can build. Work 
is currently ongoing on the development of a Published on the ECB™s website on 24 March 2009. 18 Available on the ECB™s website. 19 Cross-border payments are estimated to account for 2-3% of 20 overall payments.3 FINANCIAL INTEGRATION 
143ECBAnnual Report
2009pan-European online payment solution, 21 as well as on mobile payments and electronic invoicing. The Eurosystem organised two meetings with 
market participants to discuss the status of 
initiatives related to electronic SEPA payment 
solutions and will continue to monitor work in 
this area. Progress was achieved in the SEPA framework for cards, put in place in 2008. The Eurosystem 
expects at least one additional European card 
scheme to emerge which meets its requirements 
and those of the other stakeholders, and several 
market initiatives are already under way. The 
migration to chip cards with a personal 
identiÞ cation number and to automated teller 
machines and point-of-sale terminals equipped 
according to the EMV standard advanced 
well.22 The SEPA framework for cards is expected to increase choice and efÞ ciency, but 
more effort is still needed to promote it. In May 
2009 the Eurosystem organised a meeting with 
stakeholders on a SEPA certiÞ cation framework 
for cards and terminals, with the aim of 
achieving a single evaluation and certiÞ cation process for card and terminal manufacturers. The sixth SEPA progress report of the Eurosystem suggested that improvements may 
be needed to the overall governance of SEPA, 
concerning mainly stakeholder involvement, 
transparency and progress in migration. The 
Eurosystem and the European Commission are 
currently investigating how to improve SEPA 
governance.In December 2009 the ECOFIN Council conÞ rmed the importance of establishing 
deÞ nitive deadlines for migration to the SEPA 
direct debit and credit transfer, in order to 
provide the clarity and the incentives needed 
by the market to adopt the SEPA instruments, 
as well as to eliminate the costs of running 
both older products and the SEPA products in 
parallel. The ECOFIN Council therefore invited 
the European Commission and the ECB, in 
close cooperation with all the parties concerned, 
to carry out a thorough assessment to establish 
whether legislative measures are needed to set binding deadlines for introducing the SEPA 
direct debit and credit transfer, and to put 
forward a legislative proposal in the event that 
such measures are deemed necessary.The market for short-term paper in Europe is of a largely domestic nature. The STEP initiative, 
pursued by market participants under the 
auspices of the European Banking Federation 
and ACI Œ the Financial Markets Association, 
and steered by the STEP Market Committee, has 
promoted the integration of the short-term debt 
securities market through a voluntary core set of 
market standards and practices since 2001. The 
Eurosystem has supported the STEP initiative 
since its inception. Following the successful launch of the STEP market in June 2006, the Eurosystem has 
continued its support in two ways. First, the 
ECB provides statistics on the STEP market, 
which include monthly outstanding amounts and 
daily yields and spreads on new issues. Since 
end-November 2009 the ECB has also published 
daily statistics on aggregated outstanding 
amounts and new issues broken down by sector, 
maturity, rating and currency. Second, the 
Eurosystem will continue to assist the STEP 
Secretariat in the labelling of STEP paper until 
June 2010. The ultimate responsibility for 
granting and withdrawing the STEP label rests 
fully with the STEP Secretariat. Notwithstanding the distressed market conditions, the total outstanding amount of 
STEP debt securities increased by 6.4% year 
on year in the third quarter of 2009, reaching 
•404.8 billion in December 2009. The increase 
was partly driven by the decision of the 
Governing Council in October 2008 to expand 
the list of assets eligible to be used as collateral 
in Eurosystem credit operations, including 
STEP-labelled paper issued by banks. Following An online payment (or e-payment) is based on an internet 21 banking payment, but has the additional feature that the web merchant receives a payment conÞ rmation in real time, so that 
the goods can be released immediately.
For more information, see the SEPA pages on the ECB™s

2009the introduction of the STEP label in 2006, there were 149 active STEP label programmes in 
place by December 2009.To increase transparency in the area of asset-backed securities, the Eurosystem 
launched a project together with rating agencies, 
issuers and investors to provide loan-level data 
on the assets underlying such instruments. A 
well-functioning securitisation market, backed 
by standardisation and enhanced transparency, 
contributes to the completeness of the European 
Þ nancial system and fosters integration through 
the improved comparability of instruments 
across borders. ADVICE ON THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY 

FRAMEWORK FOR THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 

AND DIRECT RULE-MAKINGIn 2009 the Eurosystem™s advice on the 
legislative and regulatory framework focused in 
particular on the follow-up to the report of the 
de Larosière Group in terms of creating a new 
institutional supervisory framework in the EU 
(see Section 2.1 of this chapter). Furthermore, as 
part of its advisory role in accordance with the 
Treaty, the ECB regularly provides advice on 
initiatives that are directly or indirectly relevant 
from a Þ nancial integration point of view 
(see Section 2 of this chapter and Section 6.2
of Chapter 2).The ECB provided advice on the integration of securities settlement and payment systems. The 
ECB continued to be closely involved in the 
work on the ﬁCode of Conduct for Clearing and 
Settlementﬂ, which aims to foster competition 
on the basis of price transparency, access and 
interoperability, and service unbundling and 
accounting separation. The ECB also conducted 
analysis on the use of price examples by central 
securities depositories as a way of improving 
price comparability.The ECB continued to participate in the Clearing and Settlement Advisory Monitoring 
Expert Group II (CESAME II), which addresses 
the removal of the ﬁGiovannini barriersﬂ to 
efÞ cient clearing and settlement (named after 
the group that identiÞ ed them in 2001) resulting 
from differences in technical standards and 
business practices. This work is closely linked 
to the implementation of TARGET2-Securities 
(T2S) and aims to foster harmonisation in the 
post-trade environment.Since harmonisation of the European legal framework for payments forms the basis for 
SEPA, the Eurosystem takes a strong interest in 
EU legislation in this area. The Payment 
Services Directive 23 had been transposed into national law and had entered into force in the 
majority of Member States by November 2009. 
The ECB participated as an observer in the 
European Commission™s transposition working 
group, in which the NCBs were also represented 
by delegates accompanying their respective 
government representatives. Furthermore,
the ECB was involved in and consulted on the 
Commission™s work on the review of Regulation 
(EC) 2560/2001 (now Regulation (EC) 924/2009 
on cross-border payments in the Community). 
With regard to cross-border direct debits, the 
revised Regulation requires all banks that 
currently offer direct debits in euro at the 
national level also to be able to receive and 
process cross-border direct debit instructions in 
euro by November 2010. It further prescribes 
temporary arrangements for cross-border and 
national SEPA direct debit interchange fees, as 
set out by the ECB and the European 
Commission in joint press releases.24 Finally, the ECB has been involved in, and consulted on, 
the review of the E-Money Directive. In December 2008 two academic groups Œ the Study Group on a European Civil Code and the 
Research Group on EC Private Law Œ submitted 
to the European Commission the Þ nal version of 
a joint draft common frame of reference, which 
provides a set of ﬁmodel rulesﬂ covering core Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the 23 Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC, 2005/60/EC 
and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC.
Published on 4 September 2008 and 24 March 2009, the two joint 24 press releases provided clarity on the expectations of European 
authorities concerning the interim and long-term interchange 
fees for SEPA direct debits. 145ECBAnnual Report
2009areas of civil law. The ECB has contributed to the work of the European Financial Markets 
Lawyers Group (EFMLG) on issues in this area 
that are particularly relevant for the Þ nancial services industry.25 The ECB was also involved in the EFMLG dialogue with leading industry 
organisations that sponsor standard market 
documentation. The aim of the dialogue was to 
discuss the lessons to be learned from the recent 
market turmoil regarding provisions commonly 
used in Þ nancial transaction documentation, to 
look at the differences between various master 
agreements and to start a process of convergence 
towards standard market documentation.PROVIDING CENTRAL BANKING SERVICES WHICH 

FOSTER FINANCIAL INTEGRATIONTARGET2, the second generation of the 
Eurosystem™s large-value payment system, is 
the Þ rst market infrastructure to be completely 
integrated and harmonised at the European 
level. It allows institutions operating in several 

European countries to rationalise their back ofÞ ce 
functions and to consolidate their euro liquidity 

management. The Eurosystem strives to enhance 

TARGET2 on a regular basis in order to better 

address users™ needs, and implemented two new 

releases of the system in the course of 2009. 
T2S Œ the Eurosystem™s planned platform for core, borderless and neutral securities settlement 
services Œ will have an important impact on 
the harmonisation and integration of the post-
trading environment in Europe. T2S will 
remove many of the ﬁGiovannini barriersﬂ to 
cross-border clearing and settlement by providing 
a single IT platform with common interfaces 
and a single messaging protocol, introducing 
a harmonised timetable for all connected 
markets and extending a single harmonised 
settlement model comprising delivery versus 
payment in central bank money to all national 
and cross-border transactions. In 2009 several 
T2S sub-groups of industry experts developed 
standards for the harmonisation of instructions 
and processes. As work on implementing T2S 
has progressed, new areas have regularly been 
identiÞ ed in which harmonisation is required 
and these have either been tackled directly within the scope of the project or referred to 
the European Commission™s CESAME II group
(for more details, see Section 2.2 of Chapter 2).Finally, in the area of collateral management, work continued in 2009 on the establishment 
of a single shareable platform (CCBM2) 
for euro area NCBs with a view to 
consolidating and increasing the efÞ ciency of the Eurosystem™s internal systems and 
enhancing counterparties™ liquidity and 
collateral management (see Section 2.3
 of Chapter 2).The EFMLG™s position paper was published in September 2009 
25 and is available on the EFMLG™s website (http://www.efmlg.org).146ECBAnnual Report
20094 OVERSIGHT OF PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND MARKET 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Payment and securities clearing and settlement 
systems are basic infrastructures which are 

necessary for the proper functioning of market 

economies. They are indispensable for the efÞ cient 
ß ow of payments for goods, services and 
Þ nancial 
assets, and their smooth functioning is crucial for 

the implementation of the central bank™s monetary 

policy and for maintaining the stability of and 

conÞ dence in the currency, the 
Þ nancial system 
and the economy in general. Promoting the smooth 

operation of payment systems is a key task of the 

Eurosystem. For the performance of this task, the 

Eurosystem applies three approaches: it takes an 

operational role, conducts oversight activities and 

acts as a catalyst.Through its oversight function, the Eurosystem aims to ensure the safety and efÞ ciency of 
payment and securities settlement systems and 
of central counterparties processing the euro, 
by monitoring them, assessing them and, where 
necessary, inducing change.Like most other overseers, the Eurosystem focuses in its oversight activities both on 
individual payment and securities settlement 
systems and Œ given the interdependencies 
between these systems Œ on the market 
infrastructure as a whole.Payment instruments also fall within the scope 
of the Eurosystem™s oversight, which focuses 

in particular on their safety and efÞ ciency. As a 
consequence of both the creation of SEPA and 

the increasing harmonisation of the European 

legal framework, the retail payment landscape 

is changing signiÞ cantly, and the importance 
of a consistent approach with regard to the 

oversight of payment instruments is increasing. 

The Eurosystem has therefore developed a 

ﬁHarmonised oversight approach and oversight 

standards for payment instrumentsﬂ, published 

in February 2009. These standards create a 

common ground for all payment instrument 

frameworks, representing foundations on 

which the oversight of payment instruments in 

general can be built. 
In order to provide a comprehensive overview 
of the methods, policies and instruments that the 
Eurosystem applies in its oversight activities, 
in February 2009 the Eurosystem issued a 
ﬁEurosystem oversight policy frameworkﬂ. 
The framework is a central reference point 
on oversight matters for systems, market 
participants and other interested parties, as well 
as for the Eurosystem itself.4.1 LARGE-VALUE PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE PROVIDERSLarge-value payment systems form the 
backbone of the euro area market infrastructure 
and play an important role for the stability 
and efÞ ciency of the 
Þ nancial sector and the 
overall economy. The Eurosystem applies a 
well-deÞ ned oversight policy framework to 
all large-value payment systems which settle 
euro-denominated transactions, both to its own 
systems and to those that are privately operated. 
It is based on the internationally accepted 
Core Principles for Systemically Important 
Payment Systems, deÞ ned by the Committee 
on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) 
and adopted by the Governing Council in 2001. 
The Core Principles are complemented by the 
business continuity oversight expectations 
for systemically important payment systems 
(SIPS) which the Governing Council adopted 
in 2006, giving the industry a deadline for 
implementation by June 2009. In the second 
half of 2009 the Eurosystem started assessing 
the degree of compliance of the SIPS with the 
business continuity oversight expectations.The overall operational performance and provision of services of the key payment 
infrastructures settling euro-denominated 
transactions (TARGET2, EURO1 and the 
Continuous Linked Settlement system) and 
infrastructure service providers (such as SWIFT) 
were stable and resilient over 2009, in a period 
characterised by gradually moderating Þ nancial market tensions.147ECBAnnual Report
2009TARGET2 
In early 2009 the Eurosystem TARGET2 overseers completed their comprehensive 
oversight assessment (which had been initiated 
in late 2006) of the design of TARGET2 
against the Core Principles for Systemically 
Important Payment Systems. On the basis 
of this assessment, which was published in 
May 2009, the Governing Council concluded 
that the design of TARGET2 observed all 
applicable Core Principles.Following the June 2009 deadline for the 
implementation of the business continuity 

oversight expectations for SIPS, an assessment of 

TARGET2 against these expectations started in 

the second half of 2009. The assessment results 

will become available in the course of 2010.In addition, before the new TARGET2 software release went live on 23 November 2009, the 
overseers assessed the new functionalities 
against the applicable Core Principles. The 
overseers concluded that, overall, the new 
release would have a positive impact on the 
management of liquidity and credit risk by 
TARGET2 participants.EURO1 
EURO1 is a large-value payment system for 
cross-border and domestic transactions in 
euro between banks operating in the EU. It is 
operated by the clearing company of the Euro 
Banking Association, EBA CLEARING. 
EURO1 works on a multilateral net basis. The 
end-of-day positions of EURO1 participants 
are ultimately settled in central bank money via 
the TARGET2 system, with the ECB acting as 
settlement agent. No changes were made to EURO1 in 2009 that could have affected the risk situation of 
the system and thus would have required an 
assessment from the oversight perspective. The 
system operated smoothly throughout the year. In the second half of 2009 the EURO1 system was assessed against the business continuity oversight expectations for SIPS. The assessment 
process is still ongoing, and the assessment 
results will become available in the course of 
2010.CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEM 
The Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) 
system was launched in September 2002 
and is operated by CLS Bank International 
(CLS Bank). The system provides a multi-
currency service for the synchronous, 
i.e. payment-versus-payment (PvP), settlement 
of payment instructions relating to foreign 
exchange transactions. Through its PvP 
mechanism, CLS virtually eliminates the credit 
risks associated with the settlement of foreign 
exchange transactions. CLS currently settles 
in 17 of the world™s most traded currencies, 
including the euro, the US dollar, the Japanese 
yen, the pound sterling and the Swiss franc.Given that CLS Bank is established in the United 
States, the Federal Reserve System accepts 

primary oversight responsibility for CLS under a 

cooperative oversight arrangement involving the 

G10 central banks and the central banks of 

CLS-settled currencies. This arrangement is laid 

down in a protocol that was established by the 

participating central banks in November 2008.26 The ECB, in close cooperation with the euro area 

NCBs, is part of this cooperative oversight 

arrangement and has primary oversight 

responsibility for the settlement in euro by CLS.In 2009 CLS cooperative oversight activities mainly focused on the review of new services, 
initiatives and changes to the rules introduced 
by CLS Bank. These included the proposal 
for a new aggregation service, which aims to 
provide a safer and more efÞ cient handling of 
high-volume but low-value foreign exchange 
transactions; proposals for a new pricing policy; 
and changes to the CLS rules and member 
handbook to reß ect the lessons learned following 
the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.The ﬁProtocol for the Cooperative Oversight Arrangement of 26 CLSﬂ is available on the website of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (http://www.federalreserve.gov).148ECBAnnual Report
2009SWIFT 
SWIFT is important from a Þ nancial stability 
perspective as it provides secure messaging 
services to the Þ nancial community in more 
than 210 countries around the world. SWIFT is 

a limited liability cooperative company which 

is established in Belgium. The ECB participates 

in the G10 cooperative oversight of SWIFT, 

with the Nationale Bank van België/Banque 

Nationale de Belgique being the overseer with 

primary responsibility. The oversight focuses 

on SWIFT™s resilience to crises, operational 

reliability, security, business continuity, internal 

risk management processes and major projects 

undertaken. The oversight activities performed 

by central banks aim to ensure that SWIFT has 

in place appropriate governance arrangements, 

structures, processes, risk management procedures 

and controls to enable it to manage effectively 

the risks it may pose for Þ nancial stability and the 
soundness of Þ nancial infrastructures.
In 2009 the SWIFT oversight activities mainly 
focused on:  the implementation of the distributed 
i)architecture programme aimed at redesigning 
SWIFT™s technical architecture, including 
monitoring of the progress made on 
operational readiness testing and customer 
migration, as well as on the establishment of 
the new Asia PaciÞ c command and control 
centre;  the evolution of the SWIFT connectivity that 
ii)is offered to customers;  the monitoring of new projects with a potential 
iii)impact on the conÞ dentiality, integrity and 
availability of SWIFT™s critical services; and 
 the risk-based evaluation of SWIFT™s 
iv)cyberdefence focusing on organisational and 

operational security practices.In 2009 SWIFT announced an internal initiative 

entitled Lean@SWIFT, which aims to reduce 

operating costs within the organisation by 
streamlining certain processes. The overseers are 

closely monitoring SWIFT™s actions in relation to 

this initiative to ensure that due attention is paid 

to the continued resilience and availability of the 

SWIFT services.4.2 RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEMS 
AND INSTRUMENTSThe Eurosystem™s oversight also covers retail 
payment systems and payment instruments. In 
2009 the ECB continued to lead the monitoring 
of the smooth functioning of STEP2, which 
is a payment system for cross-border, and 
increasingly also for domestic, retail payments 
in euro, operated by EBA CLEARING. On 2 November 2009 EBA CLEARING launched two additional STEP2 services (CORE 
and B2B) supporting the SEPA direct debit 
scheme. The two services are considered to be 
compliant with the respective European Payments 
Council rulebooks, and their introduction did not 
alter the level of compliance of STEP2 with the 
applicable oversight standards.In 2009 the Eurosystem continued its oversight assessment of card payment schemes operating 
in the euro area against its oversight standards 
for such schemes adopted in January 2008. The 
assessment covers 26 schemes, four of which 
are international. Certain card payment schemes 
have been exempted from the application of 
the oversight standards. International schemes 
are assessed by cooperative assessment groups 
consisting of a lead overseeing central bank and 
other volunteering central banks. For the purpose of this assessment, the ECB, as the lead overseer within the Eurosystem for 
VISA Europe, Diners/Discover and American 
Express, signed Memoranda of Understanding 
with these card schemes, while the Nationale 
Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique 
signed a similar Memorandum of Understanding 
with MasterCard Europe, for which it acts as 
lead overseer.149ECBAnnual Report
2009The assessments of national and international card schemes will be subject to peer reviews 
in order to ensure equal application of the 
oversight standards. This process will start at the 
beginning of 2010. It is envisaged that a report 
describing the main results of the assessment 
at the aggregate level will be published around 
end-2010.On the basis of the ﬁHarmonised oversight approach and oversight standards for payment 
instrumentsﬂ, the Eurosystem developed 
draft oversight frameworks for credit transfer 
schemes and for direct debit schemes and invited 
all interested parties to provide comments on 
them by November 2009. Once the comments 
received in the public consultation have been 
considered, the oversight frameworks will be 
Þ nalised in 2010. 
4.3 SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES CLEARING 
AND SETTLEMENTThe Eurosystem has a strong interest in the 
smooth functioning of securities clearing and 
settlement systems because failures in the 
clearing, settlement and custody of collateral 
could jeopardise the implementation of 
monetary policy, the smooth functioning of 
payment systems and the maintenance of 
Þ nancial stability.
In its capacity as a user of securities settlement 
systems (SSSs), the Eurosystem assesses 
the compliance of SSSs in the euro area, as 
well as links between those SSSs, against the 
Eurosystem user standards.27 SSSs and links are eligible for Eurosystem credit operations if they 
fulÞ l these user standards, which also provide 
the basis against which the Eurosystem assesses 
any new SSSs and links or signiÞ cant updates of 
those systems already eligible.In August 2009 the Eurosystem Þ nalised its 
comprehensive assessment of all SSSs, links and relayed links. The assessment conÞ rmed that the overall level of compliance of the SSSs and their direct and relayed links was high and 
that, where necessary, the SSSs had continued 
their efforts to enhance compliance. In addition, 
one new relayed link and its underlying direct 
link were assessed and found to be compliant 
with the Eurosystem user standards. ESCB-CESR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SECURITIES 

CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT IN THE EUROPEAN 

UNIONIn June 2009 the ESCB and the Committee of 

European Securities Regulators (CESR) 

published ﬁRecommendations for securities 

settlement systems and recommendations for 

central counterparties in the European Unionﬂ28 that aim to increase the safety, soundness and 

efÞ ciency of securities clearing and settlement 
systems and of central counterparties (CCPs) in 

the EU. They are based on, and are at least as 

stringent as, the recommendations for SSSs and 

the recommendations for CCPs issued by the 

CPSS and the Technical Committee of the 

International Organization of Securities 

Commissions (IOSCO).The adoption and publication of the Þ nal ESCB-CESR recommendations is an important step towards a set of minimum requirements to 
ensure safety and soundness in the post-trading 
infrastructure in the EU. The recommendations 
are addressed to regulators and overseers, who 
will use them as a regulatory tool and will strive 
to achieve their consistent implementation 
and a level playing Þ eld for SSSs and CCPs 
in the EU. It is envisaged that SSSs and CCPs 
will publish their answers to the key questions 
of the ESCB-CESR report and that by the end 
of 2011 they will have been assessed against 
these recommendations.The European Commission, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) and 
relevant market participants and associations 
were consulted throughout the process of 
drawing up these recommendations, and ﬁStandards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in 27 ESCB credit operationsﬂ, January 1998.Available on the ECB™s website.28 150ECBAnnual Report
2009all interested parties were asked to provide comments in two public consultations. 
The review took into account all recent 
regulatory and legal developments and other 
initiatives that had taken place since the initial 
work, which started in 2001, was frozen in 2005. 
In view of the Þ nancial stability risk posed by 
the growing scale of over-the-counter (OTC) 
derivatives exposures, the risks relating to OTC 
derivatives were also taken into account when 
reviewing and Þ nalising the recommendations 
for CCPs. MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES FOR OTC DERIVATIVESThe development of adequate market 
infrastructures for OTC derivatives markets is 
a key priority for enhancing the transparency 
and resilience of these markets. While this work 
initially focused on credit default swaps, where 
immediate policy concerns had emerged during 
the Þ nancial crisis, it has subsequently been 
extended to OTC derivatives more generally.One major strand of work has aimed to promote the use of CCP clearing for OTC derivatives. 
Fostered by strong EU public sector support 
and corresponding industry initiatives, two EU 
CCPs for credit default swaps were established 
in July 2009, Eurex Credit Clear (located in the 
euro area) and ICE Clear Europe (located in 
the United Kingdom). The Governing Council 
welcomed this progress in its decision of 
16 July 2009. At the same time, the Governing 
Council emphasised that it gave particular 
priority to the use of euro area infrastructures 
for the clearing of euro-denominated credit 
default swaps, which it would closely monitor. 
The importance of the availability of euro area 
infrastructures for OTC derivatives was also 
underlined in recent analytical work of the 
Eurosystem, which highlighted the particular 
systemic risk implications of OTC derivatives 
markets for the euro area, owing to the fact that 
the euro is a major currency of denomination for 
OTC derivatives contracts.29Given the increased importance of CCPs and 
other market infrastructures, such as trade 
repositories, in OTC derivatives markets, an adequate regulatory and oversight framework 

is required to ensure the safe and efÞ cient functioning of these entities. Against this 
background, the ESCB-CESR recommendations 
for SSSs and CCPs issued in June 2009, which 
are discussed in the previous section, took into 
account a number of speciÞ c risks inherent in the 
clearing of OTC derivatives. Work to ensure a 
consistent interpretation and implementation of 
the relevant oversight standards for CCPs with 
speciÞ c regard to OTC derivatives is now also 
under way at the international level. A review 
of the 2004 CPSS-IOSCO recommendations 
for CCPs with regard to OTC derivatives was 
launched in July 2009,30 which will also include considerations relating to trade repositories. 
Furthermore, with the establishment of the OTC 
Derivatives Regulators™ Forum, a framework for 
ongoing global coordination and information-
sharing among the authorities competent for or 
with a legitimate interest in OTC derivatives 
infrastructures has been put in place.31In principle, the markets for OTC derivatives 
should meet the same standards in terms of 
transparency, efÞ ciency and safety as those 
deemed appropriate in the markets for other 
Þ nancial products, while re
ß ecting the speci
Þ c characteristics of the different products.On 20 October 2009 the European Commission outlined its proposed future actions regarding 
OTC derivatives markets.32 The Eurosystem contributed to the development of this roadmap 
with its contribution to the European 
Commission™s July 2009 consultation on 
possible measures to enhance the resilience of 
OTC derivatives markets 33 and will continue to The report entitled ﬁOTC derivatives and post-trading 29 infrastructuresﬂ was published on the ECB™s website in September 2009.

TARGET2-Securities (T2S) is an infrastructure 
that aims to provide a single, borderless pool of 
securities and a core, neutral settlement process, 
thus reinforcing the Lisbon strategy. The 
ECOFIN Council underlined in 2007 that the 
supervisory arrangements applicable to central 
securities depositories (CSDs) should remain 
safe and efÞ cient, and that the implications of 
T2S for these arrangements should therefore be 
analysed to that end.As information has been published on a number of key elements regarding the design 
and operational/legal framework of T2S, 
the Eurosystem held workshops on 18 June 
and 26 August 2009 with relevant central 
banks and supervisors to explore the criticality 
of T2S for central banks and CSDs which will 
use its services. Moreover, since T2S will offer 
cross-border services to both euro area and 
non-euro area CSDs and central banks, a high 
number of competent supervisors and overseers 
will have an interest in receiving information 
from T2S so that they can exercise their 
regulatory duties under the respective statutory 
rules. So far, all competent authorities have 
supported the idea of establishing a cooperative 
framework in relation to T2S services. 
The cooperative framework under discussion 
would not touch upon the statutory powers of 
individual authorities over domestic systems 
under national rules, or on the enforcement of 
such powers. T2S stakeholders will be informed 
as soon as the cooperative framework has been 
agreed upon. A preliminary review of the T2S 
design from an oversight perspective during the 
development phase is deemed necessary by all 
competent authorities.4.4 OTHER ACTIVITIES
In November 2009 the Eurosystem published an 
oversight report for the Þ rst time.
34 With this new publication, the Eurosystem aims to provide 
public authorities and market infrastructure 
providers and participants, as well as the general 
public, with information on the performance of 
the Eurosystem™s oversight function and its 
assessment of the safety and soundness of euro 
area payment, clearing and settlement 
infrastructures.The oversight report included an overview of the 
institutional framework, oversight standards and 
requirements, and the cooperation and practical 
arrangements for conducting system oversight 
that provide the basis for the Eurosystem™s 
oversight function. In addition, the report 
included information about the Eurosystem™s 
oversight activities during 2008, as well as on 
major developments during 2009. Finally, the 
report provided an overview of the Eurosystem™s 
future priorities in the Þ eld of oversight. 
The ECB published a ﬁGlossary of terms 
relating to payment, clearing and settlement 
systemsﬂ. These terms are deÞ ned in 
a user-friendly manner to promote their 
acceptance by market participants and the 
public. The glossary is expected to ensure the 
consistent use of terms in publications produced 
within the ESCB and may also be used by 
other EU institutions for reference purposes. 
The glossary was compiled by a committee of 
experts and was the subject of a three-month 
public consultation. All comments received 
were published on the ECB™s website. In 2009 the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted an oversight assessment of the Euro 
CHATS system. The overall outcome of the 
assessment was positive, as the Euro CHATS 
demonstrated a high level of compliance with 
all relevant Core Principles. The Eurosystem 
has an interest in the security of the settlement 
procedures of offshore systems processing 
the euro, such as the Euro CHATS. Under the 
principles of international cooperative oversight, 
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority consulted 
and shared information with the ECB in the ﬁEurosystem oversight report 2009ﬂ, November 2009.34 152ECBAnnual Report
2009process of assessing the Euro CHATS system, and the ECB provided comments on the Hong 
Kong Monetary Authority™s report. Finally, the ECB publishes statistical data on payments and securities trading, clearing 
and settlement on an annual basis. Data are 
broken down by country and, as of 2007, 
are made available solely in electronic 
form via the Statistical Data Warehouse on 
the ECB™s website. The data for 2008 were 
published on 11 September 2009. Interior view of the former Grossmarkthalle, a listed building (February 2008). The Grossmarkthalle, designed by Martin Elsaesser,

INTERNATIONAL 
RELATIONS156ECBAnnual Report
20091 EUROPEAN ISSUES
In 2009 the ECB continued to have regular contacts with European institutions and fora, 
particularly with the European Parliament 
(see Chapter 5), the Eurogroup, the ECOFIN 
Council and the European Commission. 
The President of the ECB regularly participated 

in meetings of the Eurogroup, as well as in 
meetings of the ECOFIN Council when matters 
relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB 
were discussed. In addition, the President of 
the ECB was invited to participate in meetings 
of the European Council when issues related 
to the economic and Þ nancial crisis were 
addressed. The President of the Eurogroup and 
the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary 
Affairs attended meetings of the Governing 
Council when they deemed it appropriate.I.I POLICY ISSUES
EU POLICY RESPONSE TO THE FINANCIAL CRISISThe economic and Þ nancial crisis continued 
to dominate the European policy agenda in 2009. The EU bodies and Member States 
continued to implement the European Economic 
Recovery Plan agreed by the European Council 
in December 2008. The ECB contributed to 
the design of various support measures for 
the Þ nancial sector, for example by issuing 
recommendations on government guarantees for 
bank debt and on the pricing of recapitalisations, 
as well as guiding principles for bank asset 
support schemes. As a more long-term and structural response to the crisis, the High-Level Group on 
Financial Supervision in the EU, chaired by 
Jacques de Larosière, presented its report on 
25 February 2009, setting out proposals and 
recommendations for a new regulatory agenda, 
stronger coordinated supervision and effective 
crisis management procedures. The recommendations contained in the report, together with the European Commission™s 
communication of 27 May 2009 on European 
Þ nancial supervision and the conclusions 
of the ECOFIN Council of 9 June 2009, were considered by the European Council. 
At its meeting on 18-19 June 2009 the European 

Council reached an understanding on a number 
of issues relating to the establishment of a new 
EU Þ nancial supervisory architecture. More 
speciÞ cally, the European Council expressed its 
support for the creation of a European Systemic 
Risk Board (ESRB), which will monitor and 
assess potential threats to Þ nancial stability 
and, where necessary, issue risk warnings and 
recommendations for action and monitor their 
implementation. The conclusions adopted by the 
ECOFIN Council on 9 June 2009 specify that 
the ECB should provide analytical, statistical, 
administrative and logistical support to the 
ESRB, also drawing on technical advice from 
NCBs and supervisors. To ensure accountability, 
the ESRB should report, at least biannually and 
more often if necessary, to the EU Council and 
to the European Parliament.The European Council also recommended the establishment of a European System of 
Financial Supervisors (ESFS). The aim of the 
ESFS is to enhance the quality and consistency 
of national supervision and to strengthen the 
oversight of cross-border groups by setting up 
supervisory colleges and establishing a single 
rule book for all Þ nancial institutions in the 
Single Market. The European Council also 
agreed that the ESFS should have binding and 
proportionate decision-making powers when 
assessing the compliance of supervisors with the 
single rule book and relevant EU law, as well 
as in the event of disagreements between home 
and host supervisors, including within colleges 
of supervisors. At the same time, the decisions 
of the ESFS should not impinge in any way on 
the Þ scal responsibilities of Member States.
Taking into account the conclusions of the 
European Council, the European Commission 
adopted on 23 September 2009 a package of 
legislative proposals to strengthen Þ nancial supervision in the EU, which are currently being 
considered by the European Parliament and the 
EU Council. At its meeting on 20 October 2009, 
the ECOFIN Council reached broad agreement 
on the substance of the proposals related to the 157ECBAnnual Report
2009creation of the ESRB. The ECB was consulted on these proposals and adopted, on 26 October 2009,
an opinion on the proposed legal acts related 
to the establishment of the ESRB.1 A general approach to the proposals for regulations 
establishing the new European micro-prudential 
supervisory authorities was agreed by the 
ECOFIN Council on 2 December 2009. The 
ECB adopted an opinion on these proposals on 
8 January 2010.2 For a more in-depth explanation of the legislative proposals, the institutional 
set-up of the ESRB and the role of the ECB 
in this new supervisory framework, see Box 8. Finally, following an increase from •12 billion to •25 billion in 2008, the ECOFIN Council 
agreed on 18 May 2009 to further double the 
amount of funds available under the facility 
providing medium-term Þ nancial assistance 
for Member States™ balances of payments to 
•50 billion. THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT 
In April 2009 the ECOFIN Council concluded 
that excessive deÞ cits existed in four euro area 
countries, Ireland, Greece, Spain and France, 
as well as in one non-euro area country, 
the United Kingdom, and recommended 
that they be corrected. In July the Council 
determined that an excessive deÞ cit existed in 
Malta, as well as in the non-euro area countries 
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, and 
issued recommendations on the correction of 
these deÞ cits. In December eight further euro 
area countries, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and 
Slovakia, as well as one non-euro area country, 
the Czech Republic, were considered to have 
excessive deÞ cits, and the ECOFIN Council 
issued recommendations for their correction. 
At the end of 2009 a total number of 20 EU 
countries were in excessive deÞ cit, 13 of them 
in the euro area. With regard to ongoing excessive deÞ cit procedures, in July the ECOFIN Council judged that Hungary had taken effective action to 
correct its excessive deÞ cit in line with previous 
recommendations. Finding that unexpected adverse economic events with major 
unfavourable consequences for government 
Þ nances had occurred after the adoption of the 
recommendation, the Council decided to adopt a 
revised recommendation under Article 104(7) 
of the Treaty establishing the European 
Community,3 extending the original deadline for correcting the excessive deÞ cit by two years. In December 2009 the Council took similar 
decisions with regard to the ongoing excessive 
deÞ cit procedures for Ireland, Spain, France and 
the United Kingdom, in these cases extending 
the original deadlines for correcting the 
excessive deÞ cits by one year. At the same time, 
the ECOFIN Council decided that Greece had 
not taken effective action in response to the 
Council recommendation of April 2009 under 
Article 104(8) of the Treaty establishing the 
European Community.4In the spring 2009 orientations for Þ scal policies 
agreed by euro area Þ nance ministers in June,
it was acknowledged that the Stability and 
Growth Pact provided the appropriate framework 
for conducting and coordinating budgetary 
policies. Governments committed themselves 
to put in place robust medium-term Þ scal exit 
strategies that would lead to a timely correction 
of excessive deÞ cits. In October 2009 the ECOFIN Council issued 

its conclusions on Þ scal exit strategies. It called 
for Þ scal consolidation in all EU Member States 
to start, assuming that a strengthening and 

self-sustaining recovery is under way, in 

2011 at the latest and stated that a number of 

countries would need to begin earlier. Moreover,
it considered that the pace of Þ scal consolidation 
would have to go well beyond the benchmark of 

0.5% of GDP per annum, in structural terms, in 

most Member States. The ECOFIN Council also 

called for Þ scal exit strategies to be reinforced 
by measures to strengthen national budgetary 

frameworks and to support long-term sustainability, 
CON/2009/88.1 CON/2010/5.2 Now Article 126(7) of the Treaty.3 Now Article 126(8) of the Treaty. Further information can be 4 found in Section 2.5 of Chapter 1.158ECBAnnual Report
2009and for them to be coordinated across countries 
within the framework of the Pact.In July 2009 Eurostat published a decision on the statistical recording of public interventions 
to support Þ nancial institutions and 
Þ nancial markets during the Þ nancial crisis, accompanied 
by technical guidance on the subject. Following 
this decision, information on the impact of such 
interventions on government deÞ cits and debt, 
as well as on contingent liabilities, will now be 
reported and published by Eurostat on a regular 
basis in the context of the excessive deÞ cit procedure. In November 2009 the ECOFIN Council issued its conclusions regarding the European 
Commission™s 2009 sustainability report, which 
assessed the sustainability of public Þ nances in the EU countries. According to the report, 
13 EU Member States have a high risk with 
regard to the sustainability of their public 
Þ nances (the euro area countries Ireland, Greece, 
Spain, Cyprus, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia 
and Slovakia, and the non-euro area countries 
the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania 
and the United Kingdom), while nine countries 
are considered to have a medium risk (Belgium, 
Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria 
and Portugal in the euro area, as well as Hungary 
and Poland outside the euro area). Finland is the 
only euro area country considered to have a low 
risk regarding the sustainability of its public 
Þ nances. Compared with the 2006 sustainability 
report, ten countries have been moved into a 
higher risk category (Ireland, Spain, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, 
Poland, Slovakia and the United Kingdom), 
mainly owing to the deterioration in their current 
budgetary positions. Notwithstanding the higher 
than usual uncertainty surrounding structural 
budgetary positions and long-term budgetary 
projections as a result of the economic and 
Þ nancial crisis, the ECOFIN Council concluded 
that the crisis-related deterioration of public 
Þ nances added ﬁsubstantially to sustainability 
challengesﬂ. The Council therefore called 
for these challenges to be addressed by a 
determined implementation of the three-prongedstrategy agreed at the 2001 European Council 
in Stockholm, including i) deÞ cit and debt 
reduction, ii) increasing employment rates, 
and iii) reforming social protection systems. FROM THE LISBON STRATEGY TO THE EU 2020 

STRATEGY 
The Lisbon strategy Œ the EU™s wide-
ranging programme of economic, social and 
environmental reform Œ entered the second year 
of the 2008-10 policy cycle in 2009. In spring 2009 the European Council conÞ rmed the existing Integrated Guidelines and endorsed the updated country-speciÞ c recommendations 
for the economic and employment policies 
of the Member States. It called for the swift 
implementation of these recommendations and 
stressed the contribution that structural reforms 
could make in overcoming the effects of the 
economic crisis.In October 2009 Member States submitted reports on the implementation of their national 
reform programmes. These reports set out 
the progress made by Member States in 
implementing their structural reform strategies. 
These strategies include measures to ensure the 
sustainability and quality of public Þ nances, to improve the regulatory environment of 
businesses, to invest in research and development 
and innovation, to boost labour participation 
and to enhance labour market ß exibility.In December 2009 the ECOFIN Council 
adopted conclusions on the post-Lisbon strategy, 
the EU 2020 strategy, calling for efÞ cient arrangements for the surveillance of structural 
reforms at both the national and the EU level, 
making use of all available Treaty instruments, 
and invited the European Commission to come 
forward with concrete proposals before the 
adoption of a new strategy. In response, the 
Commission launched a public consultation in 
November 2009, prior to formulating concrete 
proposals on the new EU 2020 strategy in 
early 2010.The Eurosystem has repeatedly stressed the importance of implementing structural reforms 159ECBAnnual Report
2009aimed at enhancing growth and employment, maintaining sound and sustainable Þ scal positions 
and improving the efÞ ciency of public spending 
and revenues. Euro area countries in particular 
should continue to implement comprehensive 
reform measures aimed at fostering the smooth 
functioning of EMU and avoiding imbalances. 
The ECB has contributed actively to the 
discussion on the EU 2020 strategy and will 
continue to do so in 2010.OTHER EU POLICIES 
In the areas of energy and climate change,
the ECB continued to monitor developments 
at the EU level given their implications for the 
economy as a whole and price developments in 
particular.1.2 INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
In June 2009 EU citizens elected a new 
European Parliament, which held its inaugural 
session on 14 July 2009. On 1 December 2009, 
upon the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, 
the Þ rst permanent President of the European 
Council, Herman van Rompuy, and the new 
High Representative of the Union for Foreign 
Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, 
took ofÞ ce. 2010 saw the appointment of a new European Commission, under the Presidency 
of José Manuel Barroso, who was nominated 
by Heads of State or Government for a second 
term. Following approval by the European 
Parliament, the new college of commissioners 
took ofÞ ce on 10 February 2010 for a term that 
is to expire on 31 October 2014. THE TREATY OF LISBONFollowing ratiÞ cation by the remaining
EU Member States in 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon 
entered into force on 1 December 2009. The 
ECB welcomes the successful conclusion of the 
ratiÞ cation process. 
The Lisbon Treaty makes no fundamental 
changes to the existing Treaty provisions on 
EMU. As regards the changes of particular 
relevance to the ESCB/Eurosystem, the Lisbon Treaty reinforces the Eurosystem™s 
mandate by making its primary objective, 
the maintenance of price stability, an objective 
of the EU as a whole. Moreover, the ECB, formerly a sui generis Community body, becomes a Union institution. While this provision was introduced to 
enhance the transparency of the EU™s 
institutional framework, it has no operational 
consequences of signiÞ cance for the ECB or the 
ESCB/Eurosystem. Most importantly, the ECB 
retains all its institutional features, including 
its independence, regulatory powers and legal 
personality. The Lisbon Treaty strengthens the 
ECB™s independence by explicitly anchoring its 
Þ nancial independence in primary law.
Furthermore, for the Þ rst time, the terms ﬁeuroﬂ, 
ﬁEurosystemﬂ and ﬁEurogroupﬂ are formally 
mentioned in EU primary law.5 The Statute of the ESCB was also adjusted accordingly. 
Another change pertains to the appointment of 
the members of the ECB™s Executive Board, 
who will be appointed by the European Council 
acting by a qualiÞ ed majority, bringing the 
appointment procedure into line with those 
for other key EU policy positions, such as 
the President of the European Council. 
Only representatives of the euro area countries 
will vote on these appointments. 1.3 DEVELOPMENTS IN AND RELATIONS
WITH EU CANDIDATE COUNTRIES 
The ECB continued its policy dialogue with 
the central banks of the EU candidate countries 
through bilateral meetings and within the overall 
institutional framework for the enlargement 
process set up by the EU. Accession negotiations with Croatia began in October 2005. Negotiations on the individual For further information about the institutional changes introduced 5 by the Lisbon Treaty, see the article entitled ﬁThe ECB™s relations with European Union institutions and bodies: trends 
and prospectsﬂ in the January 2010 issue of the ECB™s Monthly 
Bulletin. 160ECBAnnual Report
2009chapters of the acquis communautaire were opened in June 2006 and continued to advance in the course of 2009. By the end of the year, 
negotiations had been opened on 28 chapters
and provisionally closed on 15. The ECB 
continued its fruitful bilateral relations with 
the Croatian National Bank, for example in the 
context of a high-level policy dialogue.After opening accession negotiations with Turkey in October 2005, the European 
Commission started negotiations on the 
individual chapters of the acquis communautaire in June 2006, and one chapter was provisionally 
closed in the same month. In December 2006 
the European Council decided, owing to the 
lack of progress in the extension of the customs 
union to the EU Member States, to suspend 
talks for 8 out of the 35 chapters and not to 
provisionally close any other chapters. At the 
end of 2009 negotiations were open on 12 and 
provisionally closed on one chapter. The ECB 
continued its long-standing high-level policy 
dialogue with the Central Bank of the Republic 
of Turkey. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted candidate status in 2005. 
In October 2009 the European Commission 
recommended the opening of accession 
negotiations, but the European Council will 
not reconsider this issue until March 2010. 
Staff level contacts between the ECB and the 
National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia 
remained strong.In October 2009 the ECB hosted a regional 
economic conference on emerging Europe, 

which focused on the impact of the 

global economic and Þ nancial crisis on 
non-EU countries. Despite the high degree of 

heterogeneity in the region, a few common 

trends were identiÞ ed. Overall, the region was 
hit strongly by the crisis, with countries with 

large internal and external vulnerabilities being 

affected particularly badly. While a systemic 

crisis has so far been avoided, vulnerabilities 

and risks remain, with most countries facing a 

strong need for structural reform.161ECBAnnual Report
20092 INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
2.1 KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMSURVEILLANCE OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES 
IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMYGiven the high degree of economic and 

Þ nancial integration, the global economic 
environment is extremely relevant for the 

conduct of economic policy in the euro area. 

As a result, the Eurosystem closely monitors 

and analyses macroeconomic policies and 

underlying developments in countries outside 

the euro area. The ECB also plays an important 

role in the process of international multilateral 

surveillance of macroeconomic policies, 

which takes place mainly at the meetings of 

international organisations such as the BIS, 

the IMF and the OECD, as well as in fora such 

as the meetings of the G7 and, increasingly, 

the G20 Þ nance ministers and central bank 
governors.The international economic environment 
in 2009 was characterised by a gradual 

stabilisation of global economic activity. 

Large external imbalances Œ considered a 

symptom of escalating systemic risks in the 

global economy Œ narrowed over the course 

of the year, although they remain substantial 

and the narrowing appears to have been based 

to a signiÞ cant extent on temporary factors. 
The US current account deÞ cit narrowed from 
4.9% of GDP in 2008 to 2.9% of GDP in 2009, 

half the level reached in 2006 (the year with 

the largest imbalances in absolute terms), 

while Japan™s surplus remained close to 3% 

of GDP in both years. China™s merchandise 

trade surplus also started to decrease, falling 

from around 10% of GDP in 2006 to less 

than 6% in 2009. As in recent years, the 

euro area™s current account was close to 

balance in 2009.However, the unwinding of global imbalances 
largely reß ected cyclical and temporary 
factors linked to the crisis Œ such as a global 

deleveraging, a fall in private demand, lower 

oil prices and corrections in Þ nancial asset 
prices Œ rather than structural factors.In terms of structural factors related to global 
imbalances, net borrowing by US households 
was one of the key drivers of the widening US 
current account deÞ cit in the years prior to the 
crisis. From the early 2000s until the summer 
of 2007, portfolio inß ows Œ mostly from 
private sector investors Œ fully covered the US 
trade deÞ cit. Such portfolio in
ß ows, notably 
into government debt securities, increased 
strongly in the wake of the intensiÞ cation of 
the crisis in late 2008, before moderating from 
March 2009 as global risk appetite recovered, 
while net borrowing by US households 
decreased considerably between July 2007 
and August 2009. Meanwhile, limited social 
safety nets and Þ nancial underdevelopment 
in emerging Asia continued to encourage the 
channelling of the region™s considerable savings 
abroad, while these countries remained strongly 
export-oriented.Notwithstanding the encouraging signs of stabilisation and recovery, in 2009 several 
countries continued to receive assistance 
from the IMF (see the section below on the 
international Þ nancial architecture). Major 
central banks continued to provide liquidity 
assistance to central banks of other countries 
in order to facilitate the functioning of money 
markets in emerging economies. Such assistance 
included extended liquidity swap facilities with 
the central banks of four large and systemically 
important economies.On various occasions in 2009, the Eurosystem 
stressed the risks and distortions that would 

ensue if global imbalances were to re-emerge, 

and expressed support for a rebalancing of 

global demand patterns. In particular, the 

Eurosystem repeatedly called for policies 

aimed at increasing private and public savings 

in countries with current account deÞ cits, the 
implementation of further structural reforms in 

mature economies with relatively low potential 

growth, measures to increase domestic demand 

in emerging market economies, improved 

capital allocation in these countries, and a 

better appreciation of risks more generally. 

In the context of the ongoing reß ections 
162ECBAnnual Report
2009on improving the international Þ nancial 
architecture (see below), the Eurosystem 
underlined that such an improvement should not 

only foster Þ nancial market discipline but also 
enhance macroeconomic policy discipline. A 

strengthened multilateral economic surveillance 
framework should be able to ensure that 

economic policies, especially in systemically 

important countries, are stability-oriented 

and sustainable. Support for a rebalancing of 

the global economy also came from the G20, 

as stated in the Pittsburgh communiqué on 

a framework for strong, sustainable and 

balanced growth.Finally, the euro area itself is subject to international policy surveillance exercises. 
In 2009 the IMF conducted its regular review of 
the monetary, Þ nancial and economic policies 
of the euro area, as a complement to its reviews 
of the individual euro area countries. 
The Article  IV consultations of the IMF 
provided an opportunity for useful discussions 
between the IMF and the ECB, the Eurogroup 
presidency and the European Commission. 
Following these discussions, the IMF produced 
a report assessing the euro area policies.6INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTUREThe global Þ nancial crisis led to a wide-ranging 
debate on the set-up and functioning of the 

international monetary and Þ nancial system. 
Following their Þ rst summit on 
Þ nancial markets 
and the world economy in Washington, D.C. 

in November 2008, G20 leaders convened in 

London in April 2009 for their second meeting. 

They reiterated their earlier calls for action in the 

areas of Þ nancial regulation and macroeconomic 
policies and underlined their commitment to 

open markets and free trade. The G20 leaders 

also agreed to establish a new Financial 

Stability Board, with a strengthened mandate 

and an expanded membership as a successor 

to the Financial Stability Forum. In addition, 

they agreed to modify the Þ nancial regulatory 
framework to address the pro-cyclicality of capital 

requirements and macro-prudential risks, and to 

extend Þ nancial regulation to all systemically 
important Þ nancial institutions, instruments and 
markets. They also agreed on steps to fund and 

reform the international Þ nancial institutions. 
At their Pittsburgh summit in September 2009, 

the G20 leaders reviewed progress with regard 

to the fulÞ lment of previous commitments 
and conÞ rmed their continued support for 
international cooperation in dealing with the 

global policy challenges. Underlining the role that 

the G20 had played in shaping the responses to the 

global Þ nancial crisis, the leaders designated the 
G20 as ﬁthe premier forum for our international 

economic cooperationﬂ. The G20 also launched a 

ﬁFramework for strong, sustainable and balanced 

growthﬂ, which aims to help manage the transition 

from crisis response to a strong, sustainable and 

balanced pattern of global growth, as well as to 

address the global imbalances that contributed 

to the Þ nancial crisis. The framework foresees 
a process of mutual assessment of how national 

and regional policies and policy frameworks 

of G20 members Þ t together and whether they 
are consistent with the objective of strong, 

sustainable and balanced growth. In the area 

of Þ nancial regulation, the G20 identi
Þ ed four 
priority areas for further work, with speciÞ c deliverables and deadlines under each heading: 

i) building high-quality capital and mitigating 

pro-cyclicality, ii) reforming compensation 

practices to support Þ nancial stability, 
iii) improving over-the-counter derivatives 

markets, and iv) addressing cross-border 

resolutions and systemically important Þ nancial 
institutions.As IMF lending increased signiÞ cantly following the onset of the global Þ nancial crisis, 
discussions intensiÞ ed about the appropriate 
size of IMF resources. At the London summit on 2 April 2009, the G20 agreed to increase the 
resources available to international Þ nancial institutions by a total of USD 1.1 trillion, 
with measures including a commitment to treble 

IMF resources from USD 250 billion prior to 
the crisis to USD 750 billion, and support for a ﬁEuro area policies: 2009 Article IV consultation Œ staff reportﬂ, 6 IMF, August 2009.163ECBAnnual Report
2009new special drawing right (SDR) allocation of USD 250 billion. The G20 also called for the 
urgent ratiÞ cation of the Fourth Amendment 
of the Articles of Agreement and the 2008 quota 

and voice reform.By autumn 2009 bilateral pledges to the IMF from various member countries, including 
around USD 175 billion from EU Member 
States,7 had reached the target of USD 500 billion, taking the form of loan 
agreements, purchases of IMF notes or direct 
pledges to expanded and reformed New 
Arrangements to Borrow (NAB).8 Emphasising that the IMF is and should remain a quota-based 
institution, the members of the IMF also agreed 
that the appropriate size of Fund resources as 
well as their composition, i.e. the balance 
between quota-based and borrowed resources, 
would have to be examined in the near future, 
i.e. on the occasion of the next quota review 
(which has been brought forward from 2013 to 
January  2011) or the review of the NAB. In line 
with the comprehensive quota and voice reform 
package agreed in 2008, one key objective of 
the next quota review will be to further align 
quota shares with members™ relative weight and 
role in the global economy. At the summit in 
Pittsburgh, the G20 expressed its commitment 
ﬁto a shift in quota shares to dynamic emerging 
markets and developing countries of at least 5% 
from over-represented countries to under-
represented countriesﬂ. The G20 also agreed 
that there was a need to address issues such as 
the size and composition of the IMF™s Executive 
Board, ways of enhancing the Board™s 
effectiveness and the involvement of Fund 
governors in the strategic oversight of the IMF.The general SDR allocation equivalent to USD 250 billion entered into force on 
28 August 2009 and the special SDR allocation 
of around USD 32 billion on 9 September 2009, 
following the consent of the United States 
to the Fourth Amendment of the Articles of 
Agreement pending since 1997. With the two 
allocations totalling roughly USD 282 billion, 
the outstanding stock of SDRs increased 
nearly tenfold to around USD 316 billion. The cumulative allocations of all euro area 
countries amount to SDR 47 billion (equivalent 
to around USD 74 billion).In response to the Þ nancial crisis, among other 
things, the IMF undertook a major overhaul of its lending framework in March 2009. Key changes 
included i) the introduction of a new facility 
(Flexible Credit Line) designed for countries 
with very strong fundamentals, policies and track 
records with regard to policy implementation, 
ii) a doubling of member countries™ access to Fund 

resources, iii) the streamlining of programme 
conditionality, including the elimination of 
hard structural performance criteria in Fund-
supported programmes, iv) the simpliÞ cation of procedures for ﬁhigh accessﬂ arrangements 
that can be treated in a precautionary manner by 
borrowing members, and v) the simpliÞ cation of cost and maturity structures, as well as the 
elimination of rarely used Þ nancing facilities, 
such as the Supplemental Reserve Facility.The use of Fund resources remained signiÞ cant in 2009. Within the framework 
of regular standby programmes, agreements 
were concluded with, among others, Romania, 
Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sri Lanka and 
Belarus. In the context of the newly established 
facilities, the participation of Mexico, Poland 
and Colombia in the Flexible Credit Line was 
approved, while a number of Central American 
economies (Costa Rica, El Salvador and 
Guatemala) as well as Gabon secured High 
Access Precautionary Arrangements.In the course of 2009 the IMF focused heavily on improving its surveillance of macro-Þ nancial and Þ nancial issues. The G20 mandated the IMF 
and the newly established Financial Stability The European Council on 19-20 March 2009 announced that 7 the EU Member States were ready to provide fast temporary support to the Fund totalling •75 billion. At its meeting 
on 2 September 2009, the ECOFIN Council increased the 
aggregated EU contribution to up to •125 billion (i.e. around 
USD 175 billion at the time).
Credit arrangements between the IMF and a group of member 8 countries and institutions to provide supplementary resources

international monetary system or to deal with an exceptional 
situation that poses a threat to the stability of that system.164ECBAnnual Report
2009Board to conduct a joint early warning exercise to ß ag key macro-
Þ nancial vulnerabilities. 
In addition, the joint World Bank/IMF Financial 
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was 
overhauled to improve its effectiveness and 
to allow FSAP Þ ndings to be better integrated 
into bilateral surveillance. The FSAP fulÞ ls a 
dual role, assessing both Þ nancial stability and 
developmental needs. In view of the changes to 
the global environment since October 2008, the 
IMF also revisited its Statement of Surveillance 
Priorities, which guides the IMF™s work 
until 2011. The economic priorities continue to 
include the strengthening of the global Þ nancial system, but now also focus on bringing about 
an orderly unwinding of crisis-related policy 
measures to secure a sustained recovery and 
on promoting a rebalancing of global demand 
to support world growth while keeping global 
imbalances in check. Looking ahead, the IMF 
is to embark on a new role, providing analytical 
input into the G20™s mutual assessment process 
under the new framework for ﬁstrong, sustainable 
and balanced growthﬂ. Finally, in recognition of 
the need for the IMF to expand the scope of its 
surveillance, the IMF™s mandate is now under 
review to consider coverage of the full range 
of macroeconomic and Þ nancial sector policies 
that have an impact on global stability.The international Þ nancial community also 
continued to promote mechanisms for crisis prevention and orderly crisis resolution. In this 
context, further progress was made by sovereign 
debtors and their private creditors and investors 
in implementing the principles for stable capital 
ß ows and fair debt restructuring in emerging 
markets, which had been endorsed by G20 
Þ nance ministers and central bank governors 
in 2004. The aim of these principles, which 
are market-based and voluntary, is to provide 
guidelines regarding information-sharing, 
dialogue and close cooperation. An increasing 
number of Þ nancial institutions and issuing 
countries have voiced support for the principles 
and expressed particular interest in advancing 
their implementation. At its last meeting in 
Istanbul in October 2009, the Group of Trustees 
of the Principles, a body comprising senior leaders in global Þ nance established to guide the 
implementation of the principles, reviewed the 
progress being made within the framework of 
the international Þ nancial architecture and gave 
guidance for future work.2.2 COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES OUTSIDE 
THE EUAs in previous years, the Eurosystem organised 
seminars and workshops with non-EU central 
banks. In addition, the technical assistance 
provided by the Eurosystem remained 
an important tool for strengthening the 
administrative capacity of central banks outside 
the EU, especially in the EU™s neighbouring 
regions, and enhancing compliance with 
European and international standards. The ECB 
also actively participated alongside the European 
Commission in the EU™s macroeconomic 
dialogue with key emerging market economies 
(e.g. Russia, India and Egypt) and EU 
neighbouring countries. The ECB continued to deepen its relations with countries in the western Balkans. 
On 1 September 2008 the ECB and 17 EU 
NCBs 9 began a nine-month programme of technical assistance with the National Bank of 
Serbia. The programme, funded by the European 
Agency for Reconstruction, provided the 
National Bank of Serbia with a needs analysis 
report on progress to be made in selected central 
banking areas in preparation for EU accession.10 The areas covered were the supervision of 
banks, the harmonisation with the acquis communautaire of legislation under the 
competence of the National Bank of Serbia, 
the liberalisation of capital movements, the 
conduct of monetary policy and the exchange The NCBs of Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 9 Germany, Estonia, Greece, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Romania and the 
United Kingdom.
In December 2008 the European Agency for Reconstruction 10 ofÞ cially ceased operations and transferred its rights and 
obligations to the Delegation of the European Commission (since 
1 December 2009 ﬁthe Delegation of the European Unionﬂ) to 
the Republic of Serbia.165ECBAnnual Report
2009rate regime, monetary, Þ nancial and balance 
of payments statistics, and Þ nancial services 
consumer protection.Continued cooperation with the Central Bank of Egypt led to the launch of a new three-year 
programme on 1 January 2009, funded by 
the European Commission. The programme 
involves experts from the ECB,    (Bulgarian National Bank), eská národní banka, the Deutsche Bundesbank, 
the Bank of Greece, the Banque de France, the 
Banca d™Italia and Banca Naional a României. The aim of the programme is to gradually 
strengthen banking supervision in Egypt to 
achieve basic compliance with the Basel II 
framework, in line with the strategy devised 
by the Central Bank of Egypt. The central 
bank technical cooperation programme with 
the Bank of Russia, which is funded by the 
European Commission, continued in 2009. 
The Eurosystem (the ECB in partnership with 
the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Bank of Greece, 
the Banco de España, the Banque de France, 
the Banca d™Italia, De Nederlandsche Bank, 
the Oesterreichische Nationalbank and Suomen 
Pankki Œ Finlands Bank in cooperation with the 
Financial Supervisory Authority of Finland) 
provides technical assistance in the areas of 
banking supervision and internal audit. In the 
Þ rst area, the aim is to support the gradual 
implementation of the Basel II framework in 
Russian banking supervision, while in the Þ eld of internal audit, support is provided with regard 
to risk-based internal audit, IT audit and the audit 
of foreign exchange reserve management. The 
programme, which began in 2008, is expected 
to end on 31 December 2010.The Eurosystem and the Bank of Russia held their Þ fth high-level seminar on 11 and 
12 March 2009 in Vienna. The seminar, 
hosted by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, 
was attended by governors and high-level 
representatives of the Eurosystem and the 
Bank of Russia. The purpose of the seminar 
was to further strengthen the dialogue and 
enhance relations between the two bodies, which have intensiÞ ed in recent years. 
The main issues addressed at the seminar 
related to recent macroeconomic developments, 
the impact of commodity price developments 
on inß ation and Þ nancial stability in Russia and the euro area.The fourth high-level Eurosystem seminar with Latin American central banks took place 
on 23 March 2009 in Mexico City, co-organised 
by the ECB, the Banco de España and the Banco 
de México. The main topics discussed were 
the economic implications of and the policy 
responses to both the global Þ nancial crisis and 
the rise and fall of commodity prices.On 2-3 November 2009 the ECB held a workshop to prepare the sixth high-level Eurosystem 
seminar with the central banks of Mediterranean 
countries, which will take place in Cyprus 
in 2010. The workshop was attended by central 
bank representatives from the Eurosystem, 
the EU™s southern and eastern Mediterranean 
partner countries, the European Commission 
and the European Investment Bank. Workshop 
discussions focused on the impact of the global 
Þ nancial crisis and the ensuing recession 
in the economies and Þ nancial sectors of 
Mediterranean countries and on exchange rate 
regimes in the region. In 2009 the ECB also intensiÞ ed its relations 
with the Chinese authorities. On 29 November the President of the ECB, the President 
of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner 
for Economic and Monetary Affairs met 
the Chinese authorities in Nanjing. This was 
the second such meeting to be held between 
these parties, and the forum is considered an 
important part of the dialogue between China 
and the EU. Several economic and Þ nancial issues were addressed, including exchange 
rate policies, and the discussion contributed 
to a greater mutual understanding of the 
policies of the respective areas. The ECB also 
strengthened its relations with the People™s 
Bank of China in 2009. The main forum 
for discussion is the ECB-People™s Bank of China 166ECBAnnual Report
2009Working Group, which holds three meetings annually. In 2009 the group discussed issues 
related to economic growth, stimulus policies 
and Þ nancial stability, from the perspective 
of both the euro area and China.At the beginning of 2010 the ECB and 14 euro area NCBs started a two-year programme 

to strengthen macro- and micro-prudential 
supervision in EU candidates and potential 
candidates.11 The beneÞ ciaries of the programme 
are the central banks and supervisory authorities 
of the western Balkans and Turkey. 
The readiness of the IMF and the World Bank 
to be active partners in the programme and the 
interest expressed by numerous international 
and European institutions and bodies testify to 
the fact that this programme is perceived as 
being timely and necessary by the international 
community. The programme, which is funded 
by the EU, aims to strengthen the medium-term 
resilience to Þ nancial stress of EU candidates 
and potential candidates by supporting the 
adjustment of macro- and micro-prudential 
supervision in line with the most recently agreed 
international and EU standards. The NCBs of Belgium, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, 11 Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.

It alluded to the upcoming construction works for the new ECB premises.CHAPTER 5ACCOUNTABILITY170ECBAnnual Report
20091 ACCOUNTABILITY VIS-À-VIS THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTCentral bank independence has established itself over the past decades as an indispensable element 
of the monetary policy regimes of mature and 
emerging economies. The decision to grant 
central banks independence is Þ rmly grounded 
in economic theory and empirical evidence, both 
of which show that such a set-up is conducive to 
maintaining price stability. At the same time, it 
is a founding principle of democratic societies 
that any independent institution bestowed with a 
public function should be accountable to citizens 
and their elected representatives. Accountability 
is therefore an important counterpart of central 
bank independence. The ECB™s commitment to accountability and transparency is illustrated by its decision to go 
beyond the statutory obligations in its regular 
reporting. For instance, the ECB publishes 
a Monthly Bulletin, rather than the required 
quarterly report, and members of the Governing 
Council deliver numerous speeches to address 
relevant topics of concern to the public, which 
in 2009 included the ECB™s policy response 
to the Þ nancial crisis, global economic policy 
challenges, and fundamental reß ections on the 
role and strategy of central banks. Moreover, the 
press conferences following the Þ rst Governing 
Council meeting of each month continue to be 
a prime opportunity for the ECB to explain in 
depth its assessment of the economic situation 
and the rationale for interest rate decisions.The European Parliament, as the institution which derives its legitimacy directly from the 
citizens of the EU, plays the most important 
institutional role in holding the ECB to account. 
Since its establishment, the ECB has maintained 
a close and fruitful dialogue with the European 
Parliament. The President of the ECB continued 
to report on the ECB™s monetary policy and 
its other tasks during his quarterly hearings 
before the European Parliament™s Committee on 
Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), and 
is due to present the ECB™s Annual Report 2008 
to the plenary session of the Parliament on 
25 March 2010. In February 2009 the President 
appeared before a joint meeting of the European Parliament and the national parliaments 
to discuss the EU™s framework for safeguarding 
Þ nancial stability.
Other members of the ECB™s Executive Board 
also appeared before the European Parliament 
on a number of occasions. The Vice-President 
presented the ECB™s Annual Report 2008 
to ECON. Lorenzo Bini Smaghi and Jürgen Stark 

participated in the annual joint meetings of 
the European Parliament and the national 
parliaments to discuss the situation of the EU in 
the Þ nancial crisis and the post-crisis strategy 
for growth and jobs and the modernisation of 
the global Þ nancial architecture. José Manuel 
González-Páramo participated in a hearing 
organised by the European Parliament™s 
Special Committee on the Financial, Economic 
and Social Crisis. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell also appeared before ECON to inform its 
members about recent developments in the Þ eld of securities clearing and settlement and the 
Eurosystem™s TARGET2-Securities project.In addition, discussions took place between ECB representatives and members of the European 
Parliament on the policies of the ECB and other 
issues where the ECB has speciÞ c expertise 
(e.g. Þ nancial stability). In line with past practice, 
a delegation from ECON visited the ECB 
in 2009 to exchange views with the members 
of the Executive Board on the economic 
situation and on the implementation of the new 
supervisory framework for the EU.171ECBAnnual Report
20092 SELECTED TOPICS RAISED AT MEETINGS 
WITH THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTDuring the various exchanges of views between the European Parliament and the ECB, a wide 
range of issues were addressed. The key issues 
raised during these discussions are outlined 
below.POLICY RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC 

AND FINANCIAL CRISISThe economic and Þ nancial crisis featured 
prominently in the discussions between the 
ECB and the European Parliament. In its various 
resolutions, the European Parliament called for 
a coordinated approach among Member States 
in overcoming the crisis and welcomed the 
launch of the European Economic Recovery 
Plan. However, it expressed concern about the 
rapid rise in public debt and budget deÞ cits and called for a return to sound state Þ nances as soon as possible. The Special Committee on 
the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis was 
given a mandate to analyse and evaluate the 
extent of the crisis and its impact on the EU and 
its Member States.During his appearances before the European Parliament, the President of the ECB reafÞ rmed the ECB™s full support for the European 
Commission in its difÞ cult task of ensuring the 
implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, 
and in particular for the Commission™s message 
that ambitious Þ scal consolidation should begin 
as soon as the recovery was under way.THE EU FRAMEWORK FOR FINANCIAL 

SUPERVISION AND STABILITYThe European Parliament and the ECB continued 
their close dialogue on matters concerning 
Þ nancial supervision. The European Parliament 
recalled that many of the recommendations 
contained in the report of the de Larosière Group 
(for more details, see Chapter 3) had already 
been made by its members. It also advocated 
an overhaul of the regulatory and governance 
framework for Þ nancial markets in view of the 
increasing integration of Þ nancial markets in the 
EU. Finally, it supported the enhancement of 
the ECB™s role in the Þ eld of 
Þ nancial stability. 
In earlier resolutions, the Parliament supported 
the view that the ECB should be involved in EU-wide macro-prudential supervision of 
systemically important Þ nancial institutions on 
the basis of Article 127(6) of the Treaty. During his appearances before the European Parliament, the President of the ECB welcomed 
the proposal to establish a body which would 
be speciÞ cally responsible for macro-prudential 
oversight at the European level, the European 
Systemic Risk Board (ESRB; for more details, 
see Box 8). The President made it clear 
that the ECB and the ESRB would have to 
report separately to the European Parliament, 
as the two bodies would have clearly distinct 
mandates.View of the former Grossmarkthalle from the south (2006). CHAPTER 6EXTERNAL 
COMMUNICATION174ECBAnnual Report
20091 COMMUNICATION POLICY 
External communication at the ECB aims to enhance the public™s understanding of the 
ECB™s policies and decisions. It is an integral 
part of the ECB™s monetary policy and of its 
other tasks. Two key elements Œ openness and 
transparency Œ guide the ECB™s communication 
activities. Both contribute to the effectiveness, 
efÞ ciency and credibility of the ECB™s monetary 
policy. They also support the ECB™s efforts to 
give full account of its actions, as explained in 
more detail in Chapter 5. The concept of real-time, regular and comprehensive explanations of the monetary 
policy assessment and decisions, which was 
introduced in 1999, represents a uniquely 
open and transparent approach to central 
bank communication. Monetary policy 
decisions are explained at a press conference 
immediately after the Governing Council has 
taken them. The President delivers a detailed 
introductory statement at the press conference, 
explaining the Governing Council™s decisions. 
The President and the Vice-President are then 
at the media™s disposal to answer questions. 
Since December 2004 decisions taken by the 
Governing Council other than those setting 
interest rates have also been published every 
month on the websites of the Eurosystem 
central banks. ECB legal acts are made available in all the ofÞ cial languages of the EU, as are the 
consolidated Þ nancial statements of the 
Eurosystem.1 The ECB™s Annual Report and the quarterly issues of its Monthly Bulletin are also 
made available in full in the ofÞ cial EU languages.2 The Convergence Report is made available either in full or in summary form 
in all ofÞ cial EU languages.
3 For the purposes of public accountability and transparency, 
the ECB publishes other documentation in 
addition to the statutory publications in some 
or all ofÞ cial languages, in particular press 
releases announcing monetary policy decisions, 
staff macroeconomic projections,4 policy positions and information material of relevance to the general public. The preparation, 
publication and distribution of the national 
language versions of the ECB™s key publications 

are undertaken in close collaboration 
with the NCBs. With the exception of Irish, for which a derogation at the 1 EU level is in effect.With the exception of Irish (by EU derogation) and Maltese 2 (by agreement with the Central Bank of Malta, following the 
lifting of the temporary EU derogation in May 2007).
See footnote 2.3 ECB staff projections since September 2004 and Eurosystem 4 staff projections since December 2000.175ECBAnnual Report
20092 COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES
The ECB addresses a variety of audiences, 
such as Þ nancial experts, the media, 
governments, parliaments and the general 

public, with varying levels of knowledge 

of Þ nance and economics. Its mandate and 
decisions are therefore explained through a 

range of communication tools and activities 

which are constantly being reÞ ned in order 
to make them as effective as possible, taking 

into account the different audiences and the 

communication environment and needs. 
The ECB publishes a number of studies and reports, such as the Annual Report, which 
presents a review of the ECB™s activities in the 
previous year and thus contributes to the ECB™s 
accountability. The Monthly Bulletin provides 
regular updates of the ECB™s assessment of 
economic and monetary developments and the 
detailed information underlying its decisions, 
while the Financial Stability Review assesses the 
stability of the euro area Þ nancial system with 
regard to its ability to absorb adverse shocks. 
A wide range of statistical data is provided by 
the ECB primarily by means of the Statistical 
Data Warehouse and interactive charts on the 
ECB™s website, as well as in hard copy in the 
monthly editions of the Statistics Pocket Book.All members of the Governing Council of the ECB directly contribute to enhancing 
public knowledge and understanding of the 
Eurosystem™s tasks and policies by giving 
testimonies before the European Parliament 
and national parliaments, delivering public 
speeches and granting interviews to the media. 
The President and other members of the 
Executive Board of the ECB appeared before 
the European Parliament seven times in total 
in 2009 (for more details, see Chapter 5). 
They delivered around 260 speeches to a 
variety of audiences in the course of 2009 and 
granted some 200 interviews to the media, as 
well as having articles published in journals, 
magazines and newspapers. The euro area NCBs play an important role in ensuring the dissemination at the national level of Eurosystem information and messages 
to the general public and interested parties. 
They address a variety of national and 
regional audiences in their own languages and 
environments. In 2009 the ECB organised 13 seminars aimed at enhancing the knowledge and understanding 
of the international and national media, either 
on its own or in cooperation with the EU NCBs, 
the European Commission, the European 
Journalism Centre and other public authorities 
or foundations. The ECB welcomed approximately 14,000 visitors to its premises in Frankfurt 
in 2009. The visitors received Þ rst-hand information in the form of presentations given 
by ECB experts and managers. All documents published by the ECB and its various activities are presented on the ECB™s 
website. In 2009 the website received 25 million 
visits (38% more than the previous year), 
with 157 million pages viewed and 45 million 
documents downloaded.In 2009 the ECB replied to around 100,000 enquiries (as compared with 60,000 in 2008) 
from the public requesting information on a 
number of issues related to the ECB™s activities, 
policies and decisions. The ECB™s communication activities in 2009 focused in particular on explaining the events 
and consequences of the global Þ nancial and 
economic crisis and the measures taken by the 
ECB and the Eurosystem. The vast majority of 
all public speeches delivered by the members 
of the Executive Board were related to this 
issue. This topic also dominated the requests 
for information and questions received from 
the press, the public and visitors to the ECB. 
The development of special projects related to 
payment systems and market infrastructure  Œ 
the Single Euro Payments Area and
TARGET2-Securities Œ required additional, 
targeted communication.176ECBAnnual Report
2009As part of the series of events to mark the tenth anniversary of the euro, a symposium 
entitled ﬁThe future of Europe Œ views 
from founding fathersﬂ was held, at which 
Valéry Giscard d™Estaing, former President 
of France, and Helmut Schmidt, former 
Chancellor of Germany, were invited to share 
their experiences and thoughts concerning the 
creation of the single currency and their views 
about future developments. The symposium was 
attended by international guests, representatives 
from the business community and the media, and 
university students. In addition, a conference was 
organised with the title ﬁ10 years of European 
Monetary Union: a legal perspectiveﬂ, at which 
135 lawyers from central banks, ministries of 
Þ nance, regional organisations and academia 
discussed the legal aspects of the functioning of 
the Eurosystem and the ESCB. The Cultural Days of the ECB were dedicated to Romania in 2009 and organised in cooperation 
with Banca Naional a României. The Cultural Days initiative was launched in 2003 with 
the aim of giving the residents of Frankfurt a 
ß avour of the culture of one of the EU countries 
each year. The programme in 2009 included 
24 different events, which were attended by 
approximately 6,000 people.View of the Grossmarkthalle when it was still a wholesale market, with the city centre in the background towards the west (2002).
CHAPTER 7INSTITUTIONAL 
FRAMEWORK, 
ORGANISATION AND 
ANNUAL ACCOUNTS180ECBAnnual Report
2009The Eurosystem is the central banking system of the euro area. It comprises the ECB and the 
NCBs of the EU Member States whose currency 
is the euro (16 since 1 January 2009). The term ﬁEurosystemﬂ is enshrined by the Lisbon Treaty.1 The Governing Council had previously adopted 
this term in order to facilitate understanding of 
the structure of central banking in the euro area. 
This term, which underlines the shared identity, 
teamwork and cooperation of all its members, is 
already broadly used.The ESCB is composed of the ECB and the NCBs of all 27 EU Member States, i.e. it also 
includes the NCBs of the Member States which 
have not yet adopted the euro. The ECB is the core of the Eurosystem and the ESCB and ensures that the operations which form part of the tasks of the ESCB are carried 
out either through its own activities or via the 
NCBs, to which the ECB shall have recourse 
to the extent deemed possible and appropriate. 
The Executive Board implements monetary 
policy in accordance with the guidelines and 
decisions laid down by the Governing Council. 
It gives the necessary instructions to the NCBs. 
The ECB has legal personality under public 
international law. Following the entry into force 
of the Lisbon Treaty, the ECB is now an EU 
institution. However, the institutional features 
of the ECB remain unchanged.2For more information on the Lisbon Treaty, see Section 1.2 1 of Chapter 4. For more details on the implications of the Lisbon Treaty for the 2 ECB, see Section 1.2 of Chapter 4.1 DECISION-MAKING BODIES AND CORPORATE

2009Each NCB has legal personality according 
to the law of its respective country. The euro 

area NCBs, which form an integral part of the 

Eurosystem, carry out the tasks conferred upon 

the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules 

established by the ECB™s decision-making 

bodies. The NCBs also contribute to the work 

of the Eurosystem and the ESCB through 

their participation in the Eurosystem/ESCB 

committees (see Section 1.5 of this chapter). 

They may perform non-Eurosystem functions 

on their own responsibility, unless the 

Governing Council Þ nds that such functions 
interfere with the objectives and tasks of 

the Eurosystem. 
The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed 
by the decision-making bodies of the ECB: the 

Governing Council and the Executive Board. 

The General Council is constituted as a third 

decision-making body of the ECB, for as long 

as there are EU Member States which have not 

yet adopted the euro. The functioning of the 

decision-making bodies is governed by the 

Treaty, the Statute of the ESCB and the relevant 

Rules of Procedure.3 Decision-making within 
the Eurosystem and the ESCB is centralised. 

However, the ECB and the euro area NCBs 

jointly contribute, strategically and 

operationally, to attaining the common goals 

of the Eurosystem, with due respect to the 

principle of decentralisation in accordance with 

the Statute of the ESCB. 
1.2 THE GOVERNING COUNCIL
The Governing Council comprises the 
members of the Executive Board of the ECB 
and the governors of the NCBs of the Member 
States which have adopted the euro. Its main 
responsibilities, as laid down in the Treaty, are:to adopt the guidelines and take the decisions  Œ
necessary to ensure the performance of the 
tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem; to formulate the monetary policy of the  Œ
euro area, including, as appropriate, decisions relating to intermediate monetary objectives, key interest rates and the supply 
of reserves in the Eurosystem, and to 
establish the necessary guidelines for their 
implementation. The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twice 
a month at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurt 
am Main, Germany. It conducts, inter alia, 
an in-depth assessment of monetary and 
economic developments and takes related 
decisions speciÞ cally at its 
Þ rst meeting of 
the month, while the second meeting usually 
focuses on issues related to other tasks and 
responsibilities of the ECB and the Eurosystem. 
In 2009 two meetings were held outside 
Frankfurt: one was hosted by the Banque 
centrale du Luxembourg in Luxembourg and the 
other by the Banca d™Italia in Venice. In addition 
to these meetings, the Governing Council may 
also hold meetings by means of teleconference 
or take decisions by written procedure.When taking decisions on monetary policy and on other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem, 
the members of the Governing Council do not 
act as national representatives, but in a fully 
independent personal capacity. This is reß ected by the principle of ﬁone member, one voteﬂ 
applied within the Governing Council. On 
18 December 2008 the Governing Council 
decided to continue its existing voting regime 4 and to introduce a rotation system only when 
the number of governors in the Governing 
Council exceeds 18. On 19 March 2009 the 
Governing Council adopted a legal act which 
covers all aspects of the implementation of the For the ECB™s Rules of Procedure, see Decision ECB/2004/2 3 of 19 February 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank, OJ L 80, 18.3.2004, p. 33, as amended

20091.3 THE EXECUTIVE BOARD
The Executive Board comprises the President and the Vice-President of the ECB and four other members appointed by common accord 6 by the Heads of State or Government of the 
Member States which have adopted the euro. 
The main responsibilities of the Executive 
Board, which as a rule meets once a week, are:to prepare the meetings of the Governing  Œ
Council;
to implement the monetary policy of the  Œ
euro area in accordance with the guidelines 
and decisions laid down by the Governing 
Council and, in doing so, to give the 
necessary instructions to the euro area 
NCBs;to manage the current business of the ECB; Œ
to exercise certain powers delegated to it by  Œ
the Governing Council, including some of a 
regulatory nature. The Executive Board is assisted by a Management 

Committee in matters relating to the ECB™s 

management, business planning and annual budget 

process. The Management Committee is composed 
of one Executive Board member, who acts as 

Chairman, and a number of senior managers. 
As of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, members of 6 the Executive Board are appointed by the European Council, acting by qualiÞ ed majority, after consultation of the European 
Parliament and of the ECB. This procedure is in line with those 
for other key policy positions in EU institutions.Jean-Claude TrichetPresident of the ECB

Steven Keuning188ECBAnnual Report
2009The Eurosystem/ESCB committees have 
continued to play an important role in assisting 

the ECB™s decision-making bodies in the 

performance of their tasks. At the request of 

both the Governing Council and the Executive 

Board, the committees have provided expertise 

in their Þ elds of competence and have facilitated 
the decision-making process. Membership of the 

committees is usually restricted to staff of the 

Eurosystem central banks. However, the NCBs 

of the Member States which have not yet adopted 

the euro take part in the meetings of a committee 

whenever it deals with matters that fall within 

the Þ eld of competence of the General Council. 
Where appropriate, other competent bodies, such 

as national supervisory authorities in the case of 

the Banking Supervision Committee, may also be 

invited. As at 31 December 2009 13 Eurosystem/
ESCB committees had been established under 

Article 9.1 of the Rules of Procedure of the ECB. 
The Budget Committee, which was established under Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure, 
assists the Governing Council in matters related 
to the ECB™s budget. The Human Resources Conference was 
established in 2005 under Article 9a of the 
Rules of Procedure as a forum for the exchange 
of experience, expertise and information among 
Eurosystem/ESCB central banks in the Þ eld of 
human resources management.The Eurosystem IT Steering Committee was 
established in 2007 by the Governing Council, 
with a mandate to steer continuous improvement 
in the use of IT within the Eurosystem, in line 
with the Eurosystem mission statement and 
organisational principles, which state the aim 
of exploiting synergies within the Eurosystem 
and achieving cost efÞ ciency gains through 
economies of scale.1.6 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
In addition to the decision-making bodies, the 
corporate governance of the ECB encompasses 
a number of external and internal control layers, three codes of conduct and rules concerning 
public access to ECB documents. EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe Statute of the ESCB provides for two 

control layers, namely the external auditor, 

which is appointed to audit the annual accounts 

of the ECB (Article 27.1 of the Statute of the 

ESCB), and the European Court of Auditors, 

which examines the operational efÞ ciency of 
the management of the ECB (Article 27.2). 

The annual report of the European Court of 

Auditors, together with the ECB™s reply, is 

published on the ECB™s website and in the 

OfÞ cial Journal of the European Union. 
In order to reinforce public assurance as to the 

independence of the ECB™s external auditor, 

the principle of audit Þ rm rotation is applied.
7 Good practices for the selection and mandate 

of external auditors, published on the ECB™s 

website, provide high-level guidance for each 

Eurosystem central bank when selecting 

external auditors and determining their 

mandate. The good practices also enable the 

Governing Council to formulate its 

recommendations to the EU Council on the 

basis of harmonised, consistent and transparent 

selection criteria.INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe internal control structure of the ECB is based 
on an approach in which each organisational 
unit (section, division, directorate or directorate 
general) is responsible for managing its own risks 
and controls, as well as the effectiveness and 
efÞ ciency of its operations. Each organisational 
unit implements operational control procedures 
within its area of responsibility in accordance 
with the risk tolerance set ex ante by the 
Executive Board. For example, a set of rules and 
procedures Œ known as a Chinese wall Œ is in 
place to prevent inside information originating 
in the areas responsible for monetary policy Following the conclusion of a tender procedure and in line with the 7 agreed practice of rotating audit Þ rms, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was appointed as the ECB™s external auditor for the Þ nancial years 
2008-12.189ECBAnnual Report
2009from reaching the areas responsible for the management of the ECB™s foreign reserves and 
own funds portfolio. In 2009 the ECB further reÞ ned its approach 
to operational risk management and aligned its framework with that deÞ ned for Eurosystem 
tasks and processes, which the ECB and the euro 
area NCBs began implementing in the course of 
the year. Moreover, a comprehensive exercise in 
which the business areas of the ECB identiÞ ed, assessed and reported their operational risks was 
conducted. The ECB regularly tests its business 
continuity arrangements and took measures to 
increase its resilience in the event of a pandemic. 
The Governing Council approved the roll-out of 
the Eurosystem business continuity framework, 
which will begin in 2010.Independently from the internal control structure 
and risk monitoring of the ECB, audit missions 

are performed by the Directorate Internal Audit 

under the direct responsibility of the Executive 

Board. In accordance with the mandate deÞ ned 
in the ECB Audit Charter,8 the ECB™s internal 
auditors provide independent and objective 

assurance and consulting services, bringing a 

systematic approach to evaluating and improving 

the effectiveness of risk management, control 

and governance processes. The ECB™s internal 

audit activities conform with the International 

Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal 

Auditing of the Institute of Internal Auditors. 
A Eurosystem/ESCB committee, the Internal Auditors Committee, which is composed of 
the heads of internal audit at the ECB and the 
NCBs, is responsible for coordinating the 
auditing of Eurosystem/ESCB joint projects and 
operational systems. An ECB Audit Committee further enhances 
the corporate governance of the ECB and the 

Eurosystem as a whole. It is composed of three 

Governing Council members, with Erkki Liikanen 

(Governor of Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands Bank) 

as Chairman as of October 2009 (following the 

retirement of John Hurley, Governor of the Central 

Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland).CODES OF CONDUCTThere are three codes of conduct of relevance for 
the ECB™s decision-making bodies and its staff.9 The Þ rst is for the members of the Governing 
Council and reß ects their responsibility to 
safeguard the integrity and reputation of the 
Eurosystem and to maintain the effectiveness 
of its operations.10 It gives guidance to, and sets ethical standards for, the members of the 
Governing Council and their alternates when 
exercising their functions as members of the 
Governing Council. An adviser has also been 
appointed by the Governing Council to provide 
guidance to its members on some aspects of 
professional conduct. The second code is the 
Code of Conduct of the ECB, which gives 
guidance to, and sets benchmarks for, the staff 
of the ECB and the members of the Executive 
Board, all of whom are expected to maintain 
high standards of professional ethics in the 
performance of their duties.11 In accordance with the Code of Conduct™s rules against insider 
trading, the ECB™s staff and the members 
of the Executive Board are prohibited from 
taking advantage of inside information when 
conducting private Þ nancial activities at their 
own risk and for their own account, or at the 
risk and for the account of a third party.12 The third code is a Supplementary Code of Ethical 
Criteria for the members of the Executive 
Board.13 It complements the other two codes by further detailing the ethical regime applicable 
to members of the Executive Board. An Ethics 
Adviser appointed by the Executive Board 
ensures a consistent interpretation of these This charter is published on the ECB™s website to foster the 8 transparency of audit arrangements in place at the ECB.For information regarding the T2S Programme Board™s Code 9 of Conduct, see Section 2.2 of Chapter 2.
See the Code of Conduct for the members of the Governing 10 Council, OJ C 123, 24.5.2002, p. 9, its amendment, OJ C 10, 
16.1.2007, p. 6 and the ECB™s website.
See the Code of Conduct of the European Central Bank in 11 accordance with Article 11.3 of the Rules of Procedure of the 
European Central Bank, OJ C 76, 8.3.2001, p. 12 and the ECB™s 
website.

2009rules. The ethical rules applying to staff of the ECB, as currently laid down in the Conditions 
of Employment, the Staff Rules and the Code of 
Conduct, are being enhanced and consolidated 
into a new ethical framework.ANTI-FRAUD MEASURESIn 1999 the European Parliament and the EU 
Council adopted a Regulation 14 to step up the Þ ght against fraud, corruption and any other 
illegal activity detrimental to the Communities™ 
Þ nancial interests. The Regulation provides inter 
alia for the internal investigation of suspected 
fraud by the European Anti-Fraud OfÞ ce (OLAF) within the EU institutions, bodies, 
ofÞ ces and agencies.
The OLAF Regulation foresees that each of the 
latter adopt decisions in order for OLAF to be 
able to carry out its investigations within each 
of them. In June 2004 the Governing Council 
adopted a Decision 15 concerning the terms and conditions for investigations by OLAF of the 
ECB, which entered into force on 1 July 2004. INTERNAL ECB ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING/
COUNTER-TERRORIST FINANCING PROGRAMMEIn 2007 the ECB established its internal 
anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-
terrorist Þ nancing (CTF) scheme. The design 
of the AML/CTF provisions is in line with 
the 40 Recommendations and nine Special 
Recommendations of the Financial Action Task 
Force (FATF), as far as applicable to the ECB™s 
operations. A compliance function within the 
ECB identiÞ es, analyses and addresses the 
risks associated with money laundering and 
terrorist Þ nancing for all relevant activities of 
the ECB. In particular, ensuring compliance 
with applicable AML/CTF legislation is part 
of the process of assessing and monitoring the 
eligibility of the ECB™s counterparties. In this 
context, particular attention is paid to restrictive 
measures adopted by the EU and public 
statements issued by the FATF. An internal 
reporting system complements the ECB™s 
AML/CTF framework to ensure that all relevant 
information is systematically collected and duly 
communicated to the Executive Board. PUBLIC ACCESS TO ECB DOCUMENTSThe ECB™s Decision on public access to ECB 
documents 16 adopted in March 2004 is in line with the objectives and standards applied by 
other EU institutions and bodies with regard to 
public access to their documents. It enhances 
transparency, while at the same time taking 
into account the independence of the ECB and 
of the NCBs and ensuring the conÞ dentiality of certain matters speciÞ c to the performance 
of the ECB™s tasks.17 In 2009 the number of public access requests 
remained limited. Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament 14 and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud OfÞ ce (OLAF),

20092.1 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
In 2009 the ECB continued to develop and implement human resources management 
policies in four areas: corporate culture, 
recruitment, professional development and 
employment conditions. CORPORATE CULTURE 
In 2009 developments related to the corporate 
culture of the ECB focused on diversity and 
professional ethics. A number of initiatives were 
launched in the area of diversity management, 
including focus group discussions on gender 
diversity, a Þ rst diversity forum for all staff and the establishment of an internal project group 
on gender diversity, which aims to establish 
a common understanding of gender diversity 
at the ECB and to launch a number of related 
initiatives. To further strengthen the ECB™s 
ethical framework, the rules governing ethical 
behaviour were updated and all rules are being 
incorporated into a single repository, thus 
providing clearer and more consistent guidance 
to staff on the ethical standards they should 
adhere to.RECRUITMENT 
On 31 December 2009 the actual full-time 

equivalent number of staff holding employment 

contracts with the ECB was 1,563 (1,536 on 

31 December 2008). External recruitment to 

Þ ll permanent positions was carried out on the 
basis of Þ xed-term contracts which may be 
converted into unlimited contracts, subject to 

organisational considerations and individual 

performance. A total of 64 new Þ xed-term 
contracts were offered in 2009. By contrast, 

27 members of staff employed on a Þ xed-term 
or permanent basis left the ECB in 2009 

(45 in 2008). Furthermore, 131 short-term 

contracts were issued during 2009 (in addition 

to some contract extensions from 2008) to 

cover for absences of less than one year, while 

111 short-term contracts expired in the course 

of the year. 
The ECB continued to offer short-term contracts to staff from NCBs and international organisations, thus fostering an ESCB-wide 
team spirit and cooperation with international 
organisations. On 31 December 2009 

127 employees from NCBs and international 
organisations were working at the ECB on 
various assignments (compared with 122 on 
31 December 2008).In September 2009 the ECB welcomed the fourth intake of participants in its Graduate 
Programme. The participants, who are recent 
graduates from leading universities, have a 
broad educational background and are each 
assigned to two business areas on a rotational 
basis for a total period of two years. Internship opportunities were offered throughout the year to students and graduates 
with backgrounds in economics, statistics, 
business administration, law and translation. 
On 31 December 2009 72 interns were being 
hosted by the ECB. The ECB also offered four 
fellowships as part of the Wim Duisenberg 
Research Fellowship Programme, which is open 
to leading economists, and Þ ve fellowships 
to young researchers in the context of its 
Lamfalussy Fellowship Programme.PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
Mobility and staff development measures 
continued to be the main tools for professional 
development at the ECB.The ECB™s internal mobility policy, which encourages members of staff to change positions 
after Þ ve years of service, continued to provide 
an opportunity for staff to expand their expertise 
and develop their skills. This policy enables the 
ECB to broaden staff awareness and increase 
synergies across business areas. The ECB™s 
internal recruitment policy aims to further 
facilitate internal mobility by placing emphasis 
on broad competencies. Rules have been 
revised so that all managerial positions may 
be opened up Þ rst to internal candidates. In the 
course of 2009 196 members of staff, including 
44 managers and advisers, moved internally 
to other positions, on either a temporary or a 
long-term basis.2 ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
192ECBAnnual Report
2009The ECB, like all ESCB central banks, 
participates actively in the external work 

experience scheme which is promoted by 

the Human Resources Conference and 

which enables the ECB to second staff to the 

27 NCBs in the EU or to relevant international 

organisations (e.g. the IMF and the BIS) for 

periods of two to twelve months. A total of 

21 members of staff were seconded under 

this scheme in 2009. In addition, the ECB 

granted unpaid leave, for up to three years, 

to 31 members of staff. Eight of them took 

up employment at NCBs, international 

organisations or private companies. Others 

used these periods of unpaid leave to study or 

for other personal reasons. The total number 

of staff members on unpaid leave at the end 

of December 2009 was 55 (compared with 54 

in 2008). The number of staff on parental leave 

was 28 (compared with 26 in 2008). 
A number of initiatives were launched in 
2009 to support the development of the ECB™s 

value-driven leadership and management 

culture and to train managers through 

workshops, seminars and individual coaching 

sessions. Training for managers concentrated 

on coaching and feedback skills, on dealing 

effectively with conß icts, on in
ß uencing 
skills and on change management. Managers 

also participated in the multi-source feedback 

exercise in which reporting staff, peers and 

external contacts identify areas of strength and 

areas for managers™ personal development. 

Individual coaching was provided on the basis 

of the results.The ECB continued to promote the 
acquisition and development of skills and 

the enhancement of the competencies of 

staff. Learning and development at the 

ECB are a shared responsibility between 

the organisation, managers and staff. While 

the ECB provides the budgetary means 

and the training framework and managers 

deÞ ne the training needs of staff for their 
current position, staff are required to take the 

necessary steps for learning and development 

and ensure that their expertise is maintained 
at the highest level. In addition to numerous 

in-house training opportunities, staff continued 

to take up external training opportunities to 

address individual training needs of a more 

ﬁtechnicalﬂ nature. They also beneÞ ted from 
opportunities organised as part of ESCB 

training programmes or training offered by 

the NCBs. In addition, the ECB supported 

the requests of 15 staff members who wished 

to acquire a qualiÞ cation that would increase 
their professional competence beyond the 

requirements of their current position.EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS 
The ECB™s employment conditions are designed 
to be attractive and to balance the needs of staff 
with those of the organisation. Changes to the 
ECB™s employment conditions in 2009 focused 
on social security and work-life balance. The ECB reviewed its retirement plan for staff 
members to ensure the long-term Þ nancial 
sustainability and sound Þ nancial management 
of the plan. The contributions of the ECB 

and the staff were increased from 16.5% to 

18% of basic salary and from 4.5% to 6% 

respectively. The existing retirement plan was 

frozen on 31 May 2009 and a new pension 

scheme was introduced on 1 June 2009.
The acquired rights of staff under the 

frozen retirement plan were preserved, 

and some structural elements of the plan, 

such as the normal ECB retirement age of 

65 and the possibility of early retirement, 

were maintained in the new pension scheme. 
The ECB continued to support staff in the areas of childcare and the reconciliation of 
work and family commitments. The number 
of staff on unpaid parental leave as at 
31 December 2009 was 28 (compared with 26 
in 2008). The teleworking pilot project launched 
in 2008 was extended during 2009. A survey 
aimed at assessing the beneÞ ts and drawbacks 
of this new policy revealed that teleworking 
is highly appreciated by both staff and 
management. The ECB will now decide how to 
incorporate teleworking as a permanent feature 
of its human resources management policies. 193ECBAnnual Report
20092.2 STAFF RELATIONS AND SOCIAL DIALOGUE 
The ECB recognises that the dialogue with its staff is important. In 2009 the ECB consulted 
the staff representatives on remuneration, 
employment, working conditions, health and 
safety conditions and the pension reform 
and continued to have a dialogue with staff 

representatives on employment and social matters. 
A discussion with the recognised trade union aimed at enhancing the social dialogue at the 
ECB took place in the last quarter of 2009. 2.3 NEW ECB PREMISES
In February 2009 the ECB launched a new 
tender procedure for the construction works for 
its new premises in Frankfurt™s Ostend area. 
The construction works were divided into 
12 separate tender packages, which were 
subdivided into a total of 69 lots. Tenders for 
the Þ rst eight packages, namely structural 
works, on-site infrastructure works, elevators, 
facades, rooÞ ng, height-access systems, 
mechanical services and electrical services, 
which represented around 80% of the building 
costs, were conducted in 2009. The remaining 
four packages will be put out to tender in the 
course of 2010 and 2011.The chosen tender strategy proved to be successful, as the offers submitted by large and 
medium-sized construction companies from all 
over Europe for the Þ rst eight packages were 
within the budget for building costs of around 
•500 million (at 2005 constant prices).On the basis of this positive outcome, the Governing Council decided on 
17 December 2009 to start the construction 
works in spring 2010. The new premises are 

expected to be completed by the end of 2013.Since the very beginning of the project, the ECB has endeavoured to ensure that the new building 
is highly energy-efÞ cient. To this end, it has 
aimed to achieve energy consumption levels 
which are 30% below the German standard 
applicable at the time that the building permit 
was issued. The energy design concept foreseen 
for the new premises comprises a number of 
energy-saving features, including efÞ cient insulation, natural ventilation, low-energy 
lighting, rainwater recycling and the use of the 
ground as an energy source for cooling and 
heating.2.4 THE EUROSYSTEM PROCUREMENT 
COORDINATION OFFICE 
In 2009 the Eurosystem Procurement 
Coordination OfÞ ce (EPCO) coordinated work 
in three areas which had been identiÞ ed as 
potential opportunities for joint procurement in 
2008: air transport for ESCB meetings, global 
hotel agreements, and packaging material 
for banknotes. EPCO also coordinated three 
in-depth analyses relating to licences for 
hardware and software products, market data 
providers and rating agencies.Furthermore, EPCO continued the exchange of best achievable practices in the Þ eld of 
procurement, which was initiated in 2008.2.5 ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
In 2009 the ECB established an Environmental 
Management System (EMS), which is compliant 
with the environmental policy framework 
adopted by the Executive Board at the end 
of 2007. The EMS is based on the internationally 

recognised standard EN ISO 14001 and aims to 
achieve continuous improvement of the ECB™s 
environmental performance. CertiÞ cation of 
the EMS and registration under Regulation 
(EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council allowing participation in an 
eco-management and audit scheme is planned 
for mid-2010. Furthermore, a programme has 
been launched with the objective of minimising 
the ECB™s ecological footprint.194ECBAnnual Report
20092.6 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICE 
MANAGEMENT 
During 2009 a strategic review of the ECB™s IT functions was performed, resulting in a 
streamlining of the organisational structure of 
the Directorate General Information Systems 
and the creation of a strategic IT plan. This 
plan will focus on strategic alignment with 
customers of IT services, whose needs will 
be supported in an integrated way across the 
entire service life cycle. The ECB successfully 
passed its Þ rst ISO/IEC 20000 surveillance 
audit, which assesses IT service management, 
while the management system for delivering 
IT projects was certiÞ ed in accordance with 
ISO standard 9001:2008.IT governance within the ESCB has been further strengthened with the adoption of an 
ESCB architecture governance policy and an IT 
service management policy under the leadership 
of the Eurosystem IT Steering Committee.195ECBAnnual Report
20093 THE HUMAN RESOURCES CONFERENCE
The activities of the Human Resources Conference (HRC) and its Task Force on 
Training and Development covered several 
aspects of HR management in 2009. In February 
a conference on health management was held, 
with the main focus on measures to improve 
staff health and the management of sick leave. 
Further topics covered by the HRC were 
knowledge management and the management 
of external staff assignments. In relation to the 
latter topic, the HRC organised a workshop on 
supporting staff before, during and after their 
external assignments abroad.An online brochure was developed to further 
promote intra-ESCB mobility and development 

and will be published on the intranet sites of 

the individual central banks. 
Based on a needs analysis, the HRC developed an ESCB seminar programme on project 
management skills. This focuses on project 
management methodology, as well as on the 
soft skills needed in a project environment, 
and will be introduced in 2010. 196ECBAnnual Report
20094 ESCB SOCIAL DIALOGUE
The ESCB Social Dialogue is a consultative forum involving the ECB and employee 
representatives from the central banks of the 
ESCB and from European trade union 
federations.18 Its purpose is to provide information and foster exchanges of views on 
issues that may have a major impact on 
employment conditions at the central banks of 
the ESCB. This information is provided in a 
biannual newsletter and at meetings held in 
Frankfurt twice a year. In 2009 the ESCB Social Dialogue celebrated its tenth anniversary. Meetings focused on 
Þ nancial supervision and the establishment 
of the European Systemic Risk Board, the 
issue of cooperation and specialisation in the 
Eurosystem, and the ESCB IT portfolio. Issues 
relating to banknote production and circulation, 
as well as payment systems, were also discussed. 
The employee representatives were informed of 
the work being carried out by the HRC.The ad hoc meetings on banknote production and circulation continued to address technical 
issues relating to banknotes prior to the 
plenary meeting of the ESCB Social Dialogue. 
The working group on the ESCB Social 
Dialogue reconvened in October to discuss ways 
of enhancing the communication ß ow between 
the ECB and the federations. The Standing Committee of European Central Bank 18 Unions (SCECBU), Union Network International Œ Europa (UNI-Europa Finance) and the European Federation of Public

2009MANAGEMENT REPORT FOR THE YEAR 
ENDING 31 DECEMBER 20091 NATURE OF THE BUSINESS
The ECB™s activities in 2009 are described in detail in the relevant chapters of the Annual 
Report.2 OBJECTIVES AND TASKS
The ECB™s objectives and tasks are described 
in the Statute of the ESCB (Articles 2 and 3). 
An overview of performance against these 
objectives is included in the President™s 
foreword to the Annual Report. 3 KEY RESOURCES, RISKS AND PROCESSES
GOVERNANCE OF THE ECBInformation relating to the governance of the 
ECB is given in Chapter 7 of the Annual Report.MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARDThe members of the Executive Board are 

appointed from among persons of recognised 

standing and professional experience in monetary 

or banking matters by a qualiÞ ed majority of the 
governments of the Member States at the level 

of the Heads of State or Government, upon a 

recommendation from the EU Council after it 

has consulted the European Parliament and the 

Governing Council.The terms and conditions of members™ employment are determined by the Governing 
Council, based on a proposal from a Committee 
comprising three members appointed by 
the Governing Council and three members 
appointed by the EU Council.The emoluments of the members of the Executive Board are set out in note 30, ﬁStaff 
costsﬂ, of the Annual Accounts.EMPLOYEESThe average number of staff (full-time 
equivalent) holding contracts with the ECB1 rose from 1,499 in 2008 to 1,530 in 2009. At the 
end of that year 1,563 staff were employed. For 
further details, see note 30, ﬁStaff costsﬂ, of the 
Annual Accounts and Section 2 of Chapter 7 
of the Annual Report which also describes the 
ECB™s human resources strategy.INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserves portfolio consists of 
foreign reserve assets transferred to it by the euro 
area NCBs in accordance with the provisions 
of Article 30 of the Statute of the ESCB, and 
the income thereon. It serves to fund the ECB™s 
operations in the foreign exchange market for 
the purposes set out in the Treaty.The ECB™s own funds portfolio reß ects the 
investment of (a) its paid-up capital, (b) the 
counterpart of the provision for foreign 

exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold 

price risks, (c) the general reserve fund, and 

(d) income accumulated on the portfolio in the 

past. Its purpose is to provide the ECB with 

income to contribute to the coverage of its 

operating expenses.The ECB™s investment activities and its management of the associated risks are 
described in greater detail in Chapter 2 of the 
Annual Report.THE BUDGET PROCESSThe Budget Committee (BUCOM), composed 
of ECB and euro area NCB experts, is a key 
contributor to the ECB™s Þ nancial governance 
process. In accordance with Article 15 of the 
Rules of Procedure, BUCOM supports the 
Governing Council by providing a detailed 
evaluation of annual ECB budget proposals and Staff on unpaid leave of absence are excluded. This number 1 includes staff with permanent, Þ xed or short-term contracts 
and the participants in the ECB™s Graduate Programme. Staff on maternity or long-term sick leave are also included.200ECBAnnual Report
2009requests for supplementary budget funding by the Executive Board, prior to their submission to 
the Governing Council for approval. Spending 
against agreed budgets is monitored regularly 
by the Executive Board, taking into account 
the advice of the ECB™s internal controlling 
function, and by the Governing Council with the 
assistance of BUCOM.4 FINANCIAL RESULT 
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTSUnder Article 26.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Annual Accounts of the ECB are drawn up 
by the Executive Board, in accordance with 
the principles established by the Governing 
Council. The accounts are then approved by the 
Governing Council and subsequently published.PROVISION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, 

INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND GOLD PRICE RISKS 
Since most of the ECB™s assets and liabilities 
are periodically revalued at current market 
exchange rates and security prices, the ECB™s 
proÞ tability is strongly affected by exchange 
rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, interest 
rate exposures. These exposures stem mainly 
from its holdings of foreign reserve assets held 
in US dollars, Japanese yen and gold, which 
are predominantly invested in interest-bearing 
instruments.In 2005, taking into account the ECB™s large exposure to these risks and the size of its 
revaluation accounts, the Governing Council 
decided to establish a provision for foreign 
exchange rate, interest rate and gold price risks. 
The Governing Council also decided that the 
provision, together with any amounts held in the 
ECB™s general reserve fund, may not exceed the 
value of the capital shares paid up by the euro 
area NCBs. In 2009, following the establishment 
of the programme for the purchase of covered 
bonds (see note 5, ﬁSecurities of euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ, of the Annual 
Accounts), the Governing Council decided to 
extend the scope of the risk provision to also 
cover credit risk. As at 31 December 2008 this provision amounted to •4,014,961,580. In accordance 
with Article 49.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
Národná banka Slovenska contributed an 
amount of •40,290,173 to the provision with 
effect from 1 January 2009. In addition, after 
taking the results of its assessment into account, 
the Governing Council decided to release, as at 
31 December 2009, an amount of •34,806,031 
from the provision in order to comply with the 
maximum allowed ceiling. The net effect of the 
above developments was an increase in the size 
of the provision to •4,020,445,722, which is the 
value of the ECB™s capital paid up by the euro 
area NCBs as at 31 December 2009.This provision will be used to cover realised and unrealised losses, in particular valuation 
losses not covered by the revaluation accounts. 
The size and continuing requirement for this 
provision is reviewed annually, taking a range 
of factors into account, including in particular 
the level of holdings of risk-bearing assets, 
the extent of materialised risk exposures in the 
current Þ nancial year, projected results for the 
coming year, and a risk assessment involving 
calculations of Values at Risk (VaR) on 
risk-bearing assets, which is applied consistently 
over time.FINANCIAL RESULT FOR 2009In 2009 the net income of the ECB prior to 

the release from the provision for risks was 

•2,218 million, compared with •2,661 million in 

2008. The net proÞ t, amounting to •2,253 million 
after this release, was distributed to the NCBs.In 2008 the depreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the Japanese yen and the US dollar resulted in 
unrealised gains of •3.6 billion. These gains 
were recorded in revaluation accounts, in line 201ECBAnnual Report
2009with the common accounting policies that have been established by the Governing Council 
for the Eurosystem. In 2009 the appreciation 
of the euro vis-à-vis the Japanese yen and the 
US dollar resulted in a reduction of •1.5 billion 
in those revaluation accounts, while the 
signiÞ cant rise in the price of gold during 2009 has led to an increase of •2.0 billion in the 
related unrealised gains. In 2009 net interest income decreased to 
•1,547 million from •2,381 million in 2008, 

owing mainly to (a) the decrease in interest 

income arising from the allocation of euro 

banknotes within the Eurosystem, which 

reß ected the fact that the average marginal 
rate for the Eurosystem™s main reÞ nancing 
operations was lower in 2009, and (b) lower 

net interest income on foreign reserve assets 

in 2009 that was due mainly to the fact that 

interest rates on US dollar-denominated 

assets were lower on average in that year. 

The resulting decrease was only partially 

offset by a decrease in the remuneration of 

NCBs™ claims in respect of foreign reserves 

transferred to the ECB.Net realised gains arising from Þ nancial operations increased from •662 million in 2008 to •1,103 million in 2009, owing mainly to 
(a) higher net realised gains from security sales 
in 2009, and (b) higher realised gains from the 
sale of gold, as a result of the signiÞ cant rise in 
the price of gold during 2009, combined with 
the larger volume of gold sold in that year. 
These sales were conducted in accordance with 
the Central Bank Gold Agreement, which came 
into effect on 27 September 2004 and of which 
the ECB is a signatory. Total administrative expenses of the ECB, including depreciation, increased from 
•388 million in 2008 to •401 million in 2009.CHANGE TO THE CAPITAL OF THE ECBUnder Article 29.3 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
the capital key for the NCBs™ subscriptions to 
the ECB™s capital must be adjusted every Þ ve years. The second such adjustment following 
the establishment of the ECB took place on 
1 January 2009. In addition, pursuant to Council Decision 2008/608/EC of 8 July 2008, taken in accordance 
with Article 122(2) of the Treaty, Slovakia 
adopted the single currency on 1 January 2009. 
Consequently, in accordance with Article 
49.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, Národná banka 
Slovenska paid up the remainder of its capital 
subscription to the ECB as of that date. The adjustment of the NCBs™ capital key shares in conjunction with Slovakia joining 
the euro area resulted in an increase in the 
ECB™s paid-up capital from •4,137 million 
on 31 December 2008 to •4,142 million on 
1 January 2009. Details of these changes are 
contained in note 16, ﬁCapital and reservesﬂ, of 
the Annual Accounts.5 OTHER ISSUES
REVIEW OF THE ECB’S RETIREMENT PLANIn 2009 the ECB reviewed its retirement plan for staff members in order to ensure the plan™s 
long-term Þ nancial sustainability. As a result 
of this review, the existing Retirement Plan 
was frozen on 31 May 2009 and a new Pension 
Scheme was introduced on 1 June 2009. For 
further details, see ﬁThe ECB™s retirement 
plan and other post-employment beneÞ tsﬂ under the Accounting Policies section of the 
Annual Accounts and Section 2 of Chapter 7 
of the Annual Report which also describes the 
employment conditions at the ECB.202ECBAnnual Report

Frankfurt am Main, 23 February 2010EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKJean-Claude TrichetPresident205ECBAnnual Report
2009FORM AND PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTSThe Þ nancial statements of the ECB have been 
designed to present fairly the Þ nancial position 
of the ECB and the results of its operations. 
They have been drawn up in accordance with 
the following accounting policies,2 which the Governing Council of the ECB considers to be 
appropriate to the nature of central bank 
activity. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe following accounting principles have been 
applied: economic reality and transparency, 
prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet 
events, materiality, the accruals principle, going 
concern, consistency and comparability.RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIESAn asset or liability is only recognised in 
the Balance Sheet when it is probable that 
any associated future economic beneÞ t will 
ß ow to or from the ECB, substantially all of 
the associated risks and rewards have been 
transferred to the ECB, and the cost or value of 
the asset or the amount of the obligation can be 
measured reliably.BASIS OF ACCOUNTINGThe accounts have been prepared on a historical 
cost basis, modiÞ ed to include the market 
valuation of marketable securities (other than 
those classiÞ ed as held-to-maturity), gold and 
all other on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency. Transactions in Þ nancial assets and 
liabilities are reß ected in the accounts on the 
basis of the date on which they were settled.With the exception of securities, transactions in Þ nancial instruments denominated in foreign 
currency are recorded in off-balance-sheet 
accounts on the trade date. At the settlement 
date the off-balance-sheet entries are reversed 
and transactions are booked on-balance-sheet. Purchases and sales of foreign currency affect 
the net foreign currency position on the trade 
date, and realised results arising from sales are 
also calculated on that date. Accrued interest, 
premiums and discounts related to Þ nancial instruments denominated in foreign currency are 
calculated and recorded daily, and the foreign 
currency position is also affected daily by these 
accruals. GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS 

AND LIABILITIESAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency are converted into euro at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet 
date. Income and expenses are converted at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the recording date. 
The revaluation of foreign exchange assets 
and liabilities, including on-balance-sheet and 
off-balance-sheet instruments, is performed on a 
currency-by-currency basis.Revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 
is treated separately from the exchange rate 
revaluation.Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at the year-end. No distinction is made between 
the price and currency revaluation differences 
for gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is 
accounted for on the basis of the price in 
euro per Þ ne ounce of gold, which, for the 
year ending 31 December 2009, was derived 
from the exchange rate of the euro against the 
US dollar on 31 December 2009.SECURITIES 
Marketable securities (other than those 
classiÞ ed as held-to-maturity) and similar 
assets are valued either at the mid-market The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down 1 in Decision ECB/2006/17, OJ L 348, 11.12.2006, p. 38, as amended.
These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 2 of the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised approach 
to the rules governing the accounting and Þ nancial reporting of 
Eurosystem operations.ACCOUNTING POLICIES 1206ECBAnnual Report
2009prices or on the basis of the relevant yield curve prevailing on the Balance Sheet date, on a 
security-by-security basis. For the year ending 
31 December 2009, mid-market prices on 
30 December 2009 were used.Marketable securities classiÞ ed as held-to-
maturity, non-marketable securities and illiquid equity shares are all valued at cost subject to 
impairment.INCOME RECOGNITIONIncome and expenses are recognised in the 
period in which they are earned or incurred. 
Realised gains and losses arising from the sale of 
foreign exchange, gold and securities are taken 
to the ProÞ t and Loss Account. Such realised 
gains and losses are calculated by reference to 
the average cost of the respective asset.Unrealised gains are not recognised as income but are transferred directly to a revaluation 
account.Unrealised losses are taken to the ProÞ t and 
Loss Account if, at the year-end, they exceed previous revaluation gains registered in the 
corresponding revaluation account. Unrealised 
losses in any one security or currency or in gold 
are not netted against unrealised gains in other 
securities or currencies or gold. In the event 
of an unrealised loss on any item taken to the 
ProÞ t and Loss Account, the average cost of that 
item is reduced to the year-end exchange rate or 
market price.Impairment losses are taken to the ProÞ t and 
Loss Account and are not reversed in subsequent years unless the impairment decreases and the 
decrease can be related to an observable event 
that occurred after the impairment was Þ rst recorded.Premiums or discounts arising on purchased securities, including those classiÞ ed as 
held-to-maturity, are calculated and presented as 
part of interest income and are amortised over 
the remaining life of the assets.REVERSE TRANSACTIONSReverse transactions are operations whereby 
the ECB buys or sells assets under a repurchase 
agreement or conducts credit operations against 
collateral.Under a repurchase agreement, securities are 
sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement to 

repurchase them from the counterparty at an agreed 

price on a set future date. Repurchase agreements 

are recorded as collateralised inward deposits on 

the liability side of the Balance Sheet and also 

lead to an interest expense in the ProÞ t and Loss 
Account. Securities sold under such an agreement 

remain on the Balance Sheet of the ECB. 
Under a reverse repurchase agreement, securities are bought for cash with a simultaneous 
agreement to sell them back to the counterparty 
at an agreed price on a set future date. 
Reverse repurchase agreements are recorded 
as collateralised loans on the asset side of the 
Balance Sheet but are not included in the ECB™s 
security holdings. They give rise to interest 
income in the ProÞ t and Loss Account.
Reverse transactions (including security lending 
transactions) conducted under an automated 
security lending programme are recorded on the 
Balance Sheet only where collateral is provided 
in the form of cash placed on an account of 
the ECB. In 2009 the ECB did not receive any 
collateral in the form of cash in connection with 
such transactions.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTSCurrency instruments, namely foreign exchange 
forward transactions, forward legs of foreign 
exchange swaps and other currency instruments 
involving an exchange of one currency for 
another at a future date, are included in the net 
foreign currency position for the purpose of 
calculating foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest rate instruments are revalued on an 
item-by-item basis. Daily changes in the variation 

margin of open interest rate futures contracts 
207ECBAnnual Report
2009are recorded in the ProÞ t and Loss Account. 
The valuation of forward transactions in securities 
and of interest rate swaps is based on generally 

accepted valuation methods using observable 

market prices and rates and the discount factors 

from the settlement dates to the valuation date. 
POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTSAssets and liabilities are adjusted for events that 
occur between the annual Balance Sheet date 
and the date on which the Governing Council 
approves the Þ nancial statements, if such events 
materially affect the condition of assets and 
liabilities at the Balance Sheet date. Important post-balance-sheet events that do not affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the 
Balance Sheet date are disclosed in the notes.INTRA-ESCB BALANCES/INTRA-EUROSYSTEM 

BALANCESIntra-ESCB transactions are cross-border 
transactions that occur between two EU central 
banks. These transactions are processed primarily 
via TARGET2 Œ the Trans-European Automated 
Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer 
system (see Chapter 2 of the Annual Report) Œ 
and give rise to bilateral balances in accounts 
held between those EU central banks connected 
to TARGET2. These bilateral balances are then 
assigned to the ECB on a daily basis, leaving 
each NCB with a single net bilateral position vis-
à-vis the ECB only. This position in the books of 
the ECB represents the net claim or liability of 
each NCB against the rest of the ESCB.Euro-denominated intra-ESCB balances of the 
euro area NCBs with the ECB (except for the 

capital of the ECB and positions resulting from the 

transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB) are 

described as intra-Eurosystem claims or liabilities 

and are presented in the Balance Sheet of the ECB 

as a single net asset or liability position. 
Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from 
the allocation of euro banknotes within the 

Eurosystem are included as a single net asset 
under ﬁClaims related to the allocation of euro 
banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁBanknotes 

in circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).Intra-ESCB balances of non-euro area NCBs with the ECB, arising from their participation in 
TARGET2,3 are disclosed under ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ. TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETSFixed assets, with the exception of land, are 

valued at cost less depreciation. Land is valued at 

cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line 

basis, beginning in the quarter after acquisition 

and continuing over the period for which the asset 

is expected to be available for use, as follows:Computers, related hardware and software, and motor vehicles 4 years Equipment, furniture and plant 
in building 10 years Fixed assets costing less than •10,000 Written off in the 
year of acquisition The depreciation period for capitalised building and refurbishment expenditure relating to 
the ECB™s existing rented premises has been 
reduced in order to ensure that these assets are 
completely written off before the ECB moves to 
its new premises. THE ECB’S RETIREMENT PLAN AND OTHER 

POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITSThe ECB operates a deÞ ned bene
Þ t plan for 
its staff. This is funded by assets held in a 
long-term employee-beneÞ t fund. 
In 2009 the ECB reviewed its retirement plan 
for staff members in order to ensure the plan™s 
long-term Þ nancial sustainability. As a result of this review, the existing Retirement Plan was 
frozen on 31 May 2009 and the related rights 
acquired by existing staff were preserved. As at 31 December 2009 the non-euro area NCBs participating 3 in TARGET2 were: Danmarks Nationalbank, Latvijas Banka, Lietuvos bankas, Narodowy Bank Polski and Eesti Pank.208ECBAnnual Report
2009A new Pension Scheme for both existing staff and new entrants was introduced on 1 June 2009. 
Under this new scheme, the compulsory 
contributions of the ECB and the staff were 
increased from 16.5% to 18% and from 4.5% to 
6% of basic salary respectively. Similarly to the 
frozen Retirement Plan, staff can make 
additional contributions under the new scheme 
on a voluntary basis in a deÞ ned contribution 
pillar that can be used to provide additional 
beneÞ ts.4BALANCE SHEETThe liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in 
respect of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t plans is the present 
value of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation as at the 
Balance Sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets used to fund the obligation, adjusted for 
unrecognised actuarial gains or losses. The deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation is calculated annually 
by independent actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. The present value of the deÞ ned 
beneÞ t obligation is determined by discounting the 
estimated future cash ß ows, using interest rates of 
high quality corporate bonds that are denominated 

in euro and have similar terms of maturity to the 

term of the related pension liability.Actuarial gains and losses can arise from experience 
adjustments (where actual outcomes are different 

from the actuarial assumptions previously made) 

and changes in actuarial assumptions.PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNTThe net amount charged to the ProÞ t and Loss 
Account comprises:  the current service cost of the bene
Þ ts (a) accruing for the year;  interest at the discount rate on the de
Þ ned (b) beneÞ t obligation;
 the expected return on the plan assets; and 
(c)  any actuarial gains and losses recognised in 
(d) the ProÞ t and Loss Account, using a ﬁ10% 
corridorﬂ approach.“10% CORRIDOR” APPROACHNet cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains and 
losses which exceed the greater of (a) 10% of the 

present value of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation and 
(b) 10% of the fair value of plan assets, are to be 

amortised over the expected average remaining 

working lives of the participating employees. 
PENSIONS OF EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS 

AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
Unfunded arrangements are in place for the 

pensions of members of the Executive Board of 

the ECB and disability beneÞ t provisions for the 
staff. The expected costs of these beneÞ ts are 
accrued over the Executive Board/staff members™ 

terms of ofÞ ce/employment using an accounting 
approach similar to that of deÞ ned bene
Þ t pension 
plans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 

in the same manner as outlined above. 
These obligations are valued annually by independent actuaries to establish the appropriate 
liability in the Þ nancial statements.
BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATIONThe ECB and the euro area NCBs, which 

together comprise the Eurosystem, issue euro 

banknotes.5 The total value of euro banknotes 
in circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem 

central banks on the last working day of 

each month in accordance with the banknote 

allocation key.6 The ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of the 

total value of euro banknotes in circulation, which 
Each member™s voluntary funds can be used at retirement to 4 purchase an additional pension. This pension would be included in the deÞ ned bene
Þ t liability from that point onwards.
Decision ECB/2001/15 of 6 December 2001 on the issue of euro 5 banknotes, OJ L 337, 20.12.2001, p. 52, as amended.
ﬁBanknote allocation keyﬂ means the percentages that result from 6 taking into account the ECB™s share in the total euro banknote 
issue and applying the subscribed capital key to the NCBs™ share 
in that total.209ECBAnnual Report
2009is disclosed under the Balance Sheet liability item 
ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ. The ECB™s share of the 

total euro banknote issue is backed by claims on 

the NCBs. These claims, which bear interest,7 are 
disclosed under the sub-item ﬁIntra-Eurosystem 

claims: claims related to the allocation of euro 

banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁIntra-
ESCB balances/intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in 

the notes on accounting policies). Interest income 

on these claims is included within the item ﬁNet 

interest incomeﬂ. This income is due to the NCBs 

in the Þ nancial year in which it accrues, but is 
distributed on the second working day of the 

following year.8 It is distributed in full unless 
the ECB™s net proÞ t for the year is less than its 
income earned on euro banknotes in circulation, 

and subject to any decisions by the Governing 

Council to make transfers to a provision for 

foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold 

price risks and/or to charge costs incurred by the 

ECB in connection with the issue and handling of 

euro banknotes against this income.RECLASSIFICATIONSInterest income and interest expense in foreign 
currency arising from US dollar and Swiss franc 
liquidity-providing operations were previously 
recorded under the heading ﬁInterest income on 
foreign reserve assetsﬂ. The ECB has decided to 
reclassify these items under the headings ﬁOther 
interest incomeﬂ and ﬁOther interest expenseﬂ,9 so that only interest income arising from the 
management of its foreign reserves is reported 
under the heading ﬁInterest income on foreign 
reserve assetsﬂ. The comparable amounts for 
2008 have been adjusted as follows:Published in 2008 • Adjustment owing to reclassiÞ cation • Restated amount • Interest income on foreign

OTHER ISSUESTaking account of the ECB™s role as a central bank, the Executive Board considers that the 
publication of a cash ß ow statement would not 
provide the readers of the Þ nancial statements 
with any additional relevant information.In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute of the ESCB, and on the basis of a 
recommendation of the Governing Council, 
the EU Council has approved the appointment 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the external 
auditors of the ECB for a Þ ve-year period up to 
the end of the Þ nancial year 2012.

2009NOTES ON THE BALANCE SHEET1 GOLD AND GOLD RECEIVABLES 
As at 31 December 2009 the ECB 
held 16,122,146 ounces 10 of Þ ne gold 
(2008: 17,156,546 ounces). The reduction 

was due to (a) sales of 1,141,248 ounces of 

Þ ne gold in accordance with the Central Bank 
Gold Agreement, which came into effect on 

27 September 2004 and of which the ECB is 

a signatory, and (b) the transfer by Národná 

banka Slovenska to the ECB of 106,848 

ounces of Þ ne gold
 11 upon the adoption of the 
single currency by Slovakia, in accordance 

with Article 30.1 of the Statute of the ESCB. 

The decrease in the euro equivalent value of 

this holding, resulting from these transactions, 

was more than offset by a signiÞ cant rise in 
the price of gold during 2009 (see ﬁGold and 

foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the 

notes on accounting policies).2 CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA AND EURO 
AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN 

CURRENCYRECEIVABLES FROM THE IMF 
This asset represents the ECB™s holdings 
of special drawing rights (SDRs) as at 
31 December 2009. It arises as the result of a 
two-way SDR buying and selling arrangement 
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
whereby the IMF is authorised to arrange sales 
or purchases of SDRs against euro, on behalf 
of the ECB, within minimum and maximum 
holding levels. The SDR is deÞ ned in terms of 
a basket of currencies. Its value is determined 
as the weighted sum of the exchange rates of 
four major currencies (euro, Japanese yen, 
pound sterling and US dollar). For accounting 
purposes, SDRs are treated as a foreign currency 
(see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and 
liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies). BALANCES WITH BANKS AND SECURITY

(18,932,289,235) 
The value of current accounts held with non-euro area residents decreased owing mainly 
to the following factors:As at 31 December 2008 current accounts (a) included an amount of •3.9 billion arising 
from the settlement of the Danish krone leg 
of outstanding swap transactions with 
Danmarks Nationalbank.12 No such swap transactions remained outstanding as at 
31 December 2009;This corresponds to 501.5 tonnes.10 The transfer, with an aggregate value equivalent to •66.5 million, 11 was made with effect from 1 January 2009.A reciprocal currency arrangement (swap line) was established 12 by Danmarks Nationalbank and the ECB in 2008. Under 
this arrangement, the ECB provides euro funds to Danmarks 
Nationalbank against Danish kroner for the duration of the 
transactions. The resulting funds are used in support of measures 
to improve liquidity in euro short-term markets.211ECBAnnual Report
2009(b) Balances in Swiss francs,
13 arising in connection with the swap arrangement established with the Swiss National Bank, 
were lower as a result of signiÞ cantly reduced outstanding operations as at 
31 December 2009 (see note 10, ﬁLiabilities 
to non-euro area residents denominated in 
euroﬂ). The depreciation of the Japanese yen and 
the US dollar against the euro and the 
reduction in unrealised gains on securities 
(see note 15, ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ) have also 
contributed to the decrease in the total value of 
these items. As at 31 December 2008 deposits related to operations conducted by Eurosystem central 
banks in order to provide US dollar liquidity to 
credit institutions in the euro area were included 
under the component money market deposits 
with euro area residents. No such deposits 
remained outstanding as at 31 December 2009,
resulting in a signiÞ cant decrease in this 
component.Additionally, upon the adoption of the single currency by Slovakia with effect from 
1 January 2009, Národná banka Slovenska 
transferred foreign reserve assets denominated 
in US dollars with an aggregate value 
of •376.6 million to the ECB, in accordance 
with Article 30.1 of the Statute of the ESCB. The ECB™s net foreign currency holdings 14 of US dollars and Japanese yen, as at 31 December 2009, were as follows: Currency in millions US dollars 43,123
Japanese yen1,093,8483 CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN EURO 
As at 31 December 2008 this item consisted mainly of a claim of •460.0 million on the 
Magyar Nemzeti Bank in connection with 
an agreement established with the ECB on repurchase transactions. This agreement 
provides the Magyar Nemzeti Bank with a 
facility to borrow up to •5 billion in order to 
support its domestic operations for the provision 
of euro liquidity. No related claims remained 
outstanding as at 31 December 2009.4 OTHER CLAIMS ON EURO AREA CREDIT 
INSTITUTIONS DENOMINATED IN EURO 
As at 31 December 2009 this claim consisted of 
a current account with a euro area resident.5 SECURITIES OF EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN EUROAs at 31 December 2009 this item consisted 
of securities acquired by the ECB within the 
scope of the purchase programme for covered 
bonds announced by the Governing Council 
on 4 June 2009. Under this programme, the 
ECB and the NCBs have, for monetary policy 
purposes, started to purchase euro-denominated 
covered bonds issued in the euro area. The 
purchases are expected to be fully implemented 
by the end of June 2010. The Governing Council has decided to classify the covered bonds as held-to-maturity 
(see ﬁSecuritiesﬂ in the notes on accounting 
policies). As at 31 December 2009 there was 
no objective evidence that these assets were 
impaired.The balances in Swiss francs reß ect the risk control measures 
13 applied by the ECB in its EUR/CHF foreign exchange swap tenders, which take the form of initial margins of 5% for 
one-week operations.
Assets minus liabilities denominated in the respective foreign 
14 currency that are subject to foreign currency revaluation. These 

are included under the headings ﬁClaims on non-euro area

This item consists of the claims of the ECB 
vis-à-vis the euro area NCBs relating to 
the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystem (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in

TARGET2 balances of the euro area NCBs 
vis-à-vis the ECB (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/
intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies). The decrease in this 
position was due mainly to the reduction in the 
outstanding amount related to the back-to-back 
swap transactions conducted with NCBs in 
connection with US dollar liquidity-providing 
operations (see note 10, ﬁLiabilities to non-euro 
area residents denominated in euroﬂ). This item also includes the amount due to euro area NCBs in respect of the interim distribution

and gold price risks in 2008 and income received 

on the own funds portfolio in 2009.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS REVALUATION 

DIFFERENCES 
This item is composed mainly of valuation 
changes in swap and forward transactions in 
foreign currency that were outstanding on 
31 December 2009 (see note 21, ﬁForeign 
exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). 
These valuation changes are the result of the 
conversion of such transactions into their euro 
equivalents at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the Balance Sheet date, compared with the 
euro values resulting from the conversion of the 
transactions at the average cost of the respective 
foreign currency on that date (see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the 
notes on accounting policies). Valuation gains in outstanding interest rate swap transactions are also included in this item 
(see note 20, ﬁInterest rate swapsﬂ). ACCRUALS AND PREPAID EXPENSESIn 2009 this position included accrued interest 
receivable on the TARGET2 balances due 
from euro area NCBs for the Þ nal month of 
2009, amounting to •261.6 million (2008: 
•648.9 million), and accrued interest receivable 
on the ECB™s claims related to the allocation 
of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem for 
the Þ nal quarter of the year (see ﬁBanknotes 
in circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting 
policies), amounting to •157.8 million 
(2008: •500.4 million). Also included under this item is accrued 
interest on securities (see also note 2, ﬁClaims 

on non-euro area and euro area residents 

denominated in foreign currencyﬂ, note 5, 

ﬁSecurities of euro area residents denominated 

in euroﬂ, and note 7, ﬁOther assetsﬂ) and other 

Þ nancial assets.
SUNDRY 
This item consists mainly of the accrued 

interim distribution of the ECB™s income 

derived from banknotes (see ﬁBanknotes in 

circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting policies 

and note 6, ﬁIntra-Eurosystem claimsﬂ).This item also includes positive balances related to swap and forward transactions 
in foreign currency that were outstanding 
on 31 December 2009 (see note 21, ﬁForeign 
exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). 
These balances arise from the conversion of such 
transactions into their euro equivalents at the 
respective currency™s average cost on the Balance 
Sheet date, compared with the euro values at 
which the transactions were initially recorded 
(see ﬁOff-balance-sheet instrumentsﬂ in the 
notes on accounting policies).214ECBAnnual Report
2009A claim against the German Federal Ministry of Finance in respect of recoverable value added 
tax and other indirect taxes paid is also included 
under this heading. Such taxes are refundable 
under the terms of Article 3 of the Protocol on 
the privileges and immunities of the European 
Union, which applies to the ECB by virtue of 
Article 39 of the Statute of the ESCB. 8 BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION 
This item consists of the ECB™s share (8%) 
of the total euro banknotes in circulation 
(see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).9 LIABILITIES TO OTHER EURO AREA 
RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN EURO 
This item comprises deposits by members of 
the Euro Banking Association (EBA) which are 
used in order to provide the ECB with collateral 
in respect of the EBA™s payments settled through 
the TARGET2 system.10 LIABILITIES TO NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN EURO 
As at 31 December 2009 this item consisted 
mainly of a liability to the Federal Reserve 
amounting to •4.5 billion (2008: •219.7 
billion) in connection with the US dollar Term 
Auction Facility. Under this programme, 
US dollars were provided by the Federal 
Reserve to the ECB by means of a temporary 
reciprocal currency arrangement (swap line), 
with the aim of offering short-term US dollar 
funding to Eurosystem counterparties. The 
ECB simultaneously entered into back-to-back 
swap transactions with euro area NCBs, which 
used the resulting funds to conduct US dollar 
liquidity-providing operations with Eurosystem 
counterparties in the form of reverse and 
swap transactions. The back-to-back swap 
transactions between the ECB and the NCBs 
resulted in intra-Eurosystem balances between the ECB and the NCBs reported under ﬁOther 
claims within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ.A liability to the Swiss National Bank 
amounting to •1.8 billion (2008: •18.4 billion) 

is also included under this heading. Swiss 

francs were provided by the Swiss National 

Bank by means of a swap arrangement 

with the aim of offering short-term Swiss 

franc funding to Eurosystem counterparties. 

The ECB simultaneously entered into swap 

transactions with euro area NCBs, which 

used the resulting funds to conduct Swiss 

franc liquidity-providing operations with 

Eurosystem counterparties against euro 

cash in the form of swap transactions. 

The swap transactions between the ECB 

and the NCBs resulted in intra-Eurosystem 

balances reported under ﬁOther claims 

within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ. In addition, 

in 2008 this item included a liability 

to the Swiss National Bank amounting 

to •15.4 billion that arose from the placement 

with the ECB of euro funds received by the 

Swiss National Bank from operations with 

other counterparties. No such related liability 

remained outstanding as at 31 December 2009.The reduction in the value of the above liabilities in 2009 reß ected the declining demand for 
US dollar and Swiss franc liquidity among 
Eurosystem counterparties.The remainder of this item reß ects balances 
held with the ECB by non-euro area NCBs arising from transactions processed via the 
TARGET2 system (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/
intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).11 LIABILITIES TO EURO AREA AND NON-EURO 
AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN 

CURRENCY 
These two items consist mainly of repurchase 

agreements conducted with euro area and non-euro 

area residents in connection with the management 

of the foreign currency reserves of the ECB.215ECBAnnual Report
200912 INTRA-EUROSYSTEM LIABILITIES 
These represent the liabilities to the euro area NCBs that arose from the transfer of foreign 
reserve assets to the ECB when they joined the 
Eurosystem. They are remunerated at the latest 
available marginal rate for the Eurosystem™s 
main reÞ nancing operations, adjusted to re
ß ect a zero return on the gold component (see note 
24, ﬁNet interest incomeﬂ). Given the adjustment of the NCBs™ weightings in the ECB™s capital key (see note 16, ﬁCapital 
and reservesﬂ), together with Národná banka 
Slovenska™s transfer of foreign reserve 
assets upon Slovakia™s adoption of the single 
currency, the total liability was increased to 
•40,204,457,215 by a decision of the Governing 
Council pursuant to Article 30 of the Statute of 
the ESCB.From 1 January 2009•31 December 2008 1)•Nationale Bank van België/Banque

and provisions equivalent to reserves of 

the ECB existing as at 31 December 2008 

(see note 14, ﬁProvisionsﬂ, and note 15,

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS REVALUATION 
DIFFERENCES 
This item is composed mainly of valuation 
changes in swap and forward transactions in 
foreign currency that were outstanding on 
31 December 2009 (see note 21, ﬁForeign 
exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). 
These valuation changes are the result of the 
conversion of such transactions into their euro 
equivalents at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the Balance Sheet date, compared with the 
euro values resulting from the conversion of the 
transactions at the average cost of the respective 
foreign currency on that date (see ﬁGold and 
foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the 
notes on accounting policies and note 7, ﬁOther 
assetsﬂ).Valuation losses on interest rate swaps are also included in this item. ACCRUALS AND INCOME COLLECTED IN ADVANCE 
This item consists mainly of interest payable 
to the NCBs in respect of their claims relating 
to the foreign reserves transferred (see note 12, 216ECBAnnual Report
2009ﬁIntra-Eurosystem liabilitiesﬂ), amounting to •443.0 million (2008: •1,400.4 million). It 
also includes accruals on balances due to 
NCBs in respect of TARGET2 amounting to 
•259.7 million (2008: •570.8 million), accruals 
on Þ nancial instruments and other accruals.
Also included under this heading is a 
contribution to the ECB from the City of 
Frankfurt of •15.3 million for the preservation 
of the listed Grossmarkthalle building in 
connection with the construction of the ECB™s 
new premises. This amount will be netted against 
the cost of the building once it comes into use 
(see note 7, ﬁOther assetsﬂ). SUNDRY 
This item includes negative balances 
related to swap and forward transactions 
in foreign currency that were outstanding 
on 31 December 2009 (see note 21, ﬁForeign 
exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). 
These balances arise from the conversion of such 
transactions into their euro equivalents at the 
respective currency™s average cost on the Balance 
Sheet date, compared with the euro values at 
which the transactions were initially recorded 
(see ﬁOff-balance-sheet instrumentsﬂ in the 
notes on accounting policies).This item also includes outstanding repurchase transactions of •146.6 million 
(2008: •337.6 million) conducted in connection 
with the management of the ECB™s own funds 
(see note 7, ﬁOther assetsﬂ) and the net liability 
in respect of the ECB™s pension obligations as

in respect of the ECB™s pension obligations 
(see ﬁThe ECB™s retirement plan and other

The actuarial losses for 2009 on the deÞ ned beneÞ t obligation amounted to •97.0 million. 
This amount includes the effects of (a) the decrease in the discount rate from 5.75% to 
5.50% that resulted in an increase in the liability 
value; (b) greater than expected growth in the 
value of the guaranteed beneÞ ts; and (c) the 
explicit inclusion of the obligation arising in 
connection with dependents™ beneÞ ts. Prior to 
2009 the (net) liability for dependents™ beneÞ ts was assumed to be immaterial and was thus not 
explicitly included. However, as this liability 
has grown, it was decided to formally include 
it in the calculation of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation. Similarly, the explicit inclusion 
of the corresponding assets in the actuarial 
valuation resulted in actuarial gains on plan 
assets amounting to •42.1 million, out of the 
total actuarial gains of •65.7 million for 2009.As a result of the application of the annual Capital 

Guarantee on 31 December 2008, and given the 

loss of capital in the plan members™ Core BeneÞ t Accounts, the Governing Council, acting on 

actuarial advice and in line with the rules of the 

ECB™s Retirement Plan, decided in 2009 to make 

a supplementary contribution of approximately 

•19.9 million out of the general assets of the ECB. 

This contribution resulted in an increase in the 

contributions paid by the ECB in 2009 compared 

with the respective Þ gure for 2008.
In preparing the valuations referred to in this note, 

the actuaries have used assumptions which the 

Executive Board has accepted for the purposes 

of accounting and disclosure. The principal 

assumptions used for the purposes of calculating 

the staff scheme liability are as follows: 
2009 % 2008 % Discount rate 5.505.75
Expected return on plan assets 6.506.50
General future salary increases 1)2.002.00
Future pension increases 2.002.00
1) In addition, allowance is made for prospective individual salary increases of between 0% and 2.25% per annum, depending on the 
age of the members of the plan.14 PROVISIONS 
This item consists of a provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price 
risks and other miscellaneous provisions. The 
latter include an appropriate provision against 
the contractual obligation of the ECB to restore 
its current premises to their original condition 
when they are vacated and the ECB moves to 
its new site.The Governing Council, taking into account 
the ECB™s large exposure to foreign exchange 

rate, interest rate and gold price risks, and the 

size of its revaluation accounts, deemed it 

appropriate to establish a provision as at 

31 December 2005 for these risks. In 2009, 

following the establishment of the programme 

for the purchase of covered bonds (see note 5, 

ﬁSecurities of euro area residents denominated 

in euroﬂ), the Governing Council decided to 
218ECBAnnual Report
2009extend the scope of the risk provision to also 
cover credit risk. This provision will be used to 

the extent deemed necessary by the Governing 

Council to offset future realised and unrealised 

losses, in particular valuation losses not 

covered by the revaluation accounts. The size 

and continuing requirement for this provision 

is reviewed annually, based on the ECB™s 

assessment of its exposure to the above risks. 

This assessment takes a range of factors into 

account, including in particular the level of 

holdings of risk-bearing assets, the extent of 

materialised risk exposures in the current 

Þ nancial year, projected results for the coming 
year, and a risk assessment involving 

calculations of Values at Risk (VaR) on risk-
bearing assets, which is applied consistently 

over time.15 The provision, together with any 
amount held in the general reserve fund, may 

not exceed the value of the ECB™s capital paid 

up by the euro area NCBs. 
As at 31 December 2008 the provision for 
the above risks amounted to •4,014,961,580. 

In accordance with Article 49.2 of the Statute 

of the ESCB, Národná banka Slovenska 

contributed an amount of •40,290,173 to the 

provision with effect from 1 January 2009. In 

addition, given (a) the adjustment of the NCBs™ 

capital key shares (see note 16, ﬁCapital and 

reservesﬂ), and (b) the contribution by Národná 

banka Slovenska, and also after taking the 

results of its assessment into account, the 

Governing Council decided to release, as at 

31 December 2009, an amount of •34,806,031 

from the provision in order to comply with the 

maximum allowed ceiling. 
The net effect of the above developments was an increase in the size of the provision to 
•4,020,445,722, which is also the value of the 
ECB™s capital paid up by the euro area NCBs as 
at 31 December 2009. 15 REVALUATION ACCOUNTS 
These accounts represent revaluation balances 
arising from unrealised gains on assets and 
liabilities. In accordance with Article 49.2 of the 
Statute of the ESCB, Národná banka Slovenska

(a) CHANGES TO THE ECB’S CAPITAL KEYPursuant to Article 29 of the Statute of the ESCB, the shares of the NCBs in the ECB™s 
capital key are weighted according to the shares 
of the respective Member States in the EU™s 
total population and GDP in equal measure, as 
notiÞ ed to the ECB by the European 
Commission. These weights are adjusted every 
Þ ve years.

2009with Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) 
No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002, as last amended 

by Council Regulation (EC) No 431/2009 of 

18 May 2009, the ECB continues to be responsible 

for the administration of the borrowing and 

lending operations of the EU under the medium-
term Þ nancial assistance mechanism. Under this 
scheme, loans from the EU to Latvia, Hungary 

and Romania for a total amount of •9.2 billion 

were outstanding as at 31 December 2009.23 PENDING LAWSUITS 
An action for damages was brought against the 

ECB before the Court of First Instance of the 

European Communities (CFI) by Document 

Security Systems Inc. (DSSI), alleging that the 

ECB had infringed a DSSI patent 20 in the 
production of euro banknotes. The CFI dismissed 

DSSI™s action for damages against the ECB.21 The ECB is currently pursuing actions to revoke 

the patent in a number of national jurisdictions. 

Furthermore, the ECB Þ rmly maintains that it has 
in no way infringed the patent, and will 

consequently also enter a defence against any 

infringement action brought by DSSI before any 

competent national court.As a result of the CFI™s dismissal of DSSI™s action for damages against the ECB, as well as 
the ECB™s successful actions to date in certain 
national jurisdictions to revoke national portions 
of DSSI™s patent, the ECB remains conÞ dent that the possibility of payments to DSSI is 
remote. The ECB is actively monitoring all 
developments in the continuing litigation. DSSI™s European Patent No 0455 750 B1.20 Order of the Court of First Instance of 5 September 2007, 21 Case T-295/05. Available at www.curia.eu.223ECBAnnual Report
2009NOTES ON THE PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT24 NET INTEREST INCOME
INTEREST INCOME ON FOREIGN RESERVE ASSETSThis item includes interest income, net of interest expense, in respect of the ECB™s net 
foreign reserve assets, as follows: Interest income and interest expense arising from US dollar and Swiss franc liquidity-providing 
operations, that were previously disclosed under 
this heading, have now been reclassiÞ ed under 
ﬁOther interest incomeﬂ and ﬁOther interest 
expenseﬂ (see ﬁReclassiÞ cationsﬂ in the notes 
on accounting policies).INTEREST INCOME ARISING FROM THE 

ALLOCATION OF EURO BANKNOTES 

WITHIN THE EUROSYSTEM 
This item consists of the interest income relating 

to the ECB™s share of the total euro banknote 

issue. Interest on the claims of the ECB in respect 
of its share of banknotes is earned at the latest 

available marginal rate for the Eurosystem™s main 

reÞ nancing operations. The decrease in income 
in 2009 mainly reß ected the fact that the average 
main reÞ nancing rate was lower than in 2008. 
This income is distributed to the NCBs as 

described under ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in 

the notes on accounting policies. Based on the 

ECB™s estimated Þ nancial result for 2009, the 
Governing Council decided to distribute this 

income in its entirety to the euro area NCBs, 

in accordance with their respective shares in 

the ECB™s capital.REMUNERATION OF NCBS’ CLAIMS IN RESPECT 

OF FOREIGN RESERVES TRANSFERRED 
Remuneration paid to euro area NCBs on their 

claims on the ECB in respect of the foreign 

reserve assets transferred under Article 30.1 

of the Statute of the ESCB is disclosed under 

this item.OTHER INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER INTEREST 

EXPENSEThese items include interest income of 

•4.0 billion (2008: •8.0 billion) and expenses 

of •3.7 billion (2008: •7.6 billion) on balances 

arising from TARGET2 (see ﬁIntra-ESCB 

balances/intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the 

notes on accounting policies). Interest income 

and expenses in respect of other assets and 

liabilities denominated in euro as well as 

interest income and interest expense arising 

from the US dollar and Swiss franc liquidity-
providing operations are also shown here 

(see ﬁReclassiÞ cationsﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).25 REALISED GAINS/(LOSSES) ARISING

224ECBAnnual Report
2009The overall increase in net realised exchange 
rate and gold price gains was due mainly to 

a signiÞ cant rise in the price of gold during 
2009, combined with the larger volume of gold 

sold in that year (see note 1, ﬁGold and gold 

receivablesﬂ). 
26 WRITE-DOWNS ON FINANCIAL ASSETS 
AND POSITIONS 
In 2009 this expense was due mainly to the 
write-down of the acquisition cost of a number 
of securities shown on the Balance Sheet to their 
market value as at 30 December 2009.27 NET EXPENSE FROM FEES AND COMMISSIONS

In 2009 income under this heading consisted of penalties imposed on credit institutions 
for non-compliance with the minimum 
reserve requirements. Expenses relate to fees 
payable on current accounts and in connection 
with the execution of interest rate futures
(see note 19, ﬁInterest rate futuresﬂ).28 INCOME FROM EQUITY SHARES 
AND PARTICIPATING INTERESTS 
Dividends received on shares which the ECB 
holds in the BIS (see note 7, ﬁOther assetsﬂ) are 
shown under this heading. 29 OTHER INCOME 
In 2009 the main item of other miscellaneous 
income included under this heading was income 
arising from the contributions of other central 
banks to the cost of a service contract held 
centrally by the ECB with an external provider 
of an IT network.30 STAFF COSTS 
Salaries, allowances, staff insurance and 

other miscellaneous costs of •158.6 million
(2008: •149.9 million) are included under 

this heading. Also included under this 

item is an amount of •28.7 million (2008: 

•24.3 million) recognised in connection with 

the ECB™s retirement plan and other post-
employment beneÞ ts (see note 13, ﬁOther 
liabilitiesﬂ). Staff costs of •1.2 million (2008: 

•1.1 million) incurred in connection with 

the construction of the ECB™s new premises 

have been capitalised and are excluded from 

this item. 
Salaries and allowances, including the emoluments of holders of senior management 
positions, are modelled in essence on, and are 
comparable with, the remuneration scheme of 
the European Union.2009  •2008• Change •Unrealised price losses on securities(34,163,743)(2,164,000)(31,999,743)

2009Members of the Executive Board receive a basic salary and additional allowances for residence 
and representation. In the case of the President, 
an ofÞ cial residence owned by the ECB is 
provided in lieu of a residence allowance. 
Subject to the Conditions of Employment for 
Staff of the European Central Bank, members of 
the Executive Board are entitled to household, 
child and education allowances, depending on 
their individual circumstances. Basic salaries 
are subject to a tax for the beneÞ t of the 
European Union as well as to deductions in 
respect of contributions to the pension, medical 
and accident insurance schemes. Allowances are 
non-taxable and non-pensionable.Basic salaries paid to members of the Executive Board in 2009 and 2008 were as follows:The total allowances paid to the members of the Executive Board and their beneÞ ts from the 
ECB™s contributions to the medical and accident 
insurance schemes amounted to •614,879 
(2008: •600,523), resulting in total emoluments 
of •2,314,859 (2008: •2,259,007).Transitional payments are made to former 
members of the Executive Board for a period after 

the end of their terms of ofÞ ce. In 2009 no such 
payments were made since no former Executive 

Board member was in receipt of such beneÞ ts 
(2008: •30,748, including the ECB™s contributions 

to the medical and accident insurance schemes). 

Pension payments, including related allowances, 

to former members of the Executive Board or 

their dependents and contributions to the medical 

and accident insurance schemes amounted to 

•348,410 (2008: •306,798).At the end of 2009 the actual full-time equivalent 
number of staff holding contracts with the ECB 
was 1,563, 22 including 150 with managerial positions. The change in the number of staff 
during 2009 was as follows:31 ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
These cover all other current expenses relating 
to the renting and maintenance of premises, 
goods and equipment of a non-capital nature, 
professional fees and other services and supplies, 
together with staff-related expenses including 
recruitment, relocation, installation, training and 
resettlement expenses.32 BANKNOTE PRODUCTION SERVICES 
This expense relates to costs arising mainly 
from the cross-border transportation of euro 
banknotes between NCBs. These costs are borne 
centrally by the ECB. Staff on unpaid leave of absence are excluded. This number 22 includes staff with permanent, Þ xed or short-term contracts and 
the participants in the ECB™s Graduate Programme. Staff on maternity or long-term sick leave are also included.2009 2008 As at 1 January 1,536 1,478

BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATIONIn respect of 2008, following a decision by 
the Governing Council, an amount of •1,206 
million, comprising part of the income earned 
on the ECB™s share of total euro banknotes 
in circulation, was distributed to the NCBs 
on 5 January 2009. In respect of 2009 the full 
income earned on the ECB™s share of total 
euro banknotes in circulation, amounting to 
•787 million, was distributed to the NCBs on 
5 January 2010. Both amounts were distributed 
to the euro area NCBs in proportion to their 
paid-up shares in the subscribed capital of 
the ECB. PROFIT DISTRIBUTION/COVERAGE OF LOSSESPursuant to Article 33 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
the net proÞ t of the ECB shall be transferred in 
the following order:an amount to be determined by the Governing (a) Council, which may not exceed 20% of the 
net proÞ t, shall be transferred to the general 
reserve fund subject to a limit equal to 
100% of the capital; and the remaining net proÞ t shall be distributed 
(b) to the shareholders of the ECB in proportion to their paid-up shares.In the event of a loss incurred by the ECB, the 
shortfall may be offset against the general 
reserve fund of the ECB and, if necessary, 
following a decision by the Governing Council, 
against the monetary income of the relevant 
Þ nancial year in proportion and up to the 
amounts allocated to the NCBs in accordance 
with Article 32.5 of the Statute of the ESCB.1Just as for 2008, the Governing Council 
decided on 4 March 2010 to make no transfer 
to the general reserve fund and to distribute the remaining balance of the proÞ t for 2009, 
amounting to •1,466 million, to the euro area 
NCBs, in proportion to their paid-up shares.Non-euro area NCBs are not entitled to receive any share of the ECB™s proÞ t, nor are they liable

20095 MARCH 2009TENDER PROCEDURES AS OF 8 APRIL 2009The Governing Council of the ECB today decided to continue the Þ xed rate tender 
procedure with full allotment for all main 
reÞ nancing operations, special-term re
Þ nancing operations and supplementary and regular 
longer-term reÞ nancing operations for as 
long as needed, and in any case beyond the 
end of 2009.In addition, the Governing Council decided to continue with the current frequency and 
maturity proÞ le of supplementary longer-
term reÞ nancing operations and special-term 
reÞ nancing operations for as long as needed, 
and in any case beyond the end of 2009. 7 MAY 2009LONGER-TERM REFINANCING OPERATIONSThe Governing Council of the ECB has today 
decided to conduct liquidity-providing longer-term 

reÞ nancing operations (LTROs) with a maturity of 
one year. 
The operations will be conducted as Þ xed rate 
tender procedures with full allotment, and the rate in the Þ rst of these operations will be the 
rate in the main reÞ nancing operations at that 
time. In subsequent LTROs with full allotment, 
the Þ xed rate may include a spread in addition 
to the rate in the main reÞ nancing operations, 
depending on the circumstances at the time.The operations will be conducted in addition to the regular and supplementary LTROs, which 
will be unaffected. A tentative schedule for such LTROs in 2009 is 
provided below.Moreover, the Governing Council has today decided to prolong until the end of 2010 the 
temporary expansion of the list of eligible assets, 
announced on 15 October 2008.EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK BECOMES 

AN ELIGIBLE COUNTERPARTY IN THE 

EUROSYSTEM’S MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONSThe Governing Council of the ECB has today 
decided that the European Investment Bank 
(EIB) will become an eligible counterparty in 
the Eurosystem™s monetary policy operations on 
8 July 2009.As of this date, the EIB will have access, if and when appropriate for its treasury management, 
to the Eurosystem™s open market operations and 
standing facilities through the Banque centrale 
du Luxembourg under the same conditions as 
any other counterparty. The EIB will comply 
with all eligibility requirements and it will hold 
minimum reserves with the Eurosystem.Access to the Eurosystem™s liquidity is a natural complement to the EIB™s Þ nancing initiatives 
and will facilitate the accommodation by 
the EIB of additional demand for its lending 
programme. At present, this additional demand 
is estimated to be •10 billion in 2009. Given the 
usual leverage ratios involved, it is estimated 
by the EIB that such additional Þ nancing could 
generate additional investment value of up to 
•40 billion this year.OVERVIEW OF THE ECB’S COMMUNICATION

ECB ANNOUNCES DETAILS OF REFINANCING 
OPERATIONS UP TO 7 APRIL 2010The Governing Council of the ECB has today 
decided to continue conducting its main 
reÞ nancing operations (MROs) as 
Þ xed rate 
tender procedures with full allotment for as 
long as is needed Œ and at least until the third 
maintenance period of 2010 ends on 13 April. 
This tender procedure will also continue to be 
used in the special-term reÞ nancing operations 
with a maturity of one maintenance period, 
which will continue for at least the Þ rst three 
maintenance periods of 2010.The Governing Council has also decided that the rate in the last 12-month longer-term 
reÞ nancing operation, to be allotted on 
16 December 2009, will be Þ xed at the average 
minimum bid rate of the MROs over the life of 
this operation.2As regards longer-term reÞ nancing operations 
in the Þ rst quarter of 2010, the Governing 
Council has decided to carry out the last 
six-month longer-term reÞ nancing operation 
on 31 March 2010. This operation will be 
carried out using a full allotment Þ xed rate 
tender procedure, as will the regular monthly 
three-month longer-term reÞ nancing operations 
already announced for the Þ rst quarter of 2010 
(see the ECB™s press release of 29 May 2009). Looking beyond the Þ rst quarter of 2010, the 
Governing Council will take into account the need to smooth out the liquidity effect of the 
12-month longer-term reÞ nancing operations 
maturing during the second half of 2010.Only one interest payment will be made Œ on the maturity date 2 (i.e. 23 December 2010). This interest payment will be calculated as the allotted amount multiplied by[6R0        +   7Ri          +  R53      ] / 360MBRMBRMBR

2009PROVISION OF LIQUIDITY IN OTHER CURRENCIES 
AND AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKS16 JANUARY 2009 
SWISS NATIONAL BANK AND ECB COOPERATION 
TO PROVIDE SWISS FRANC LIQUIDITYOn 15 October 2008 the Swiss National Bank 
and the ECB jointly announced that they would 
conduct EUR/CHF foreign exchange swaps 
providing Swiss francs against euro with a term 
of seven days at a Þ xed price to improve liquidity 
in short-term Swiss franc money markets. 
At that time, it was announced that this measure 
would remain in place as long as needed and at 
least until January 2009.Today the Swiss National Bank and the ECB are jointly announcing that they will continue these 
one-week EUR/CHF foreign exchange swap 
operations at least until the end of April 2009 to 
support further improvements in the short-term 
Swiss franc money markets. 3 FEBRUARY 2009EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY CURRENCY 
ARRANGEMENTSTo address continued pressures in global 
US dollar funding markets, the temporary 
reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) 
between the Federal Reserve and other central 
banks have been extended.The Governing Council of the ECB and the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal 
Reserve of the United States of America 
have decided to extend their temporary 
reciprocal currency arrangement (swap line) to 
30 October  2009.19 MARCH 2009US DOLLAR LIQUIDITY-PROVIDING OPERATIONS 
OF THE EUROSYSTEM IN THE SECOND QUARTER 

OF 2009The Governing Council of the ECB has decided, 
in agreement with other central banks including 
the Federal Reserve, to continue conducting US dollar liquidity-providing operations at 
terms of 7, 28 and 84 days. These operations will continue to take the form of repurchase operations against ECB-eligible 
collateral and to be carried out as Þ xed rate 
tenders with full allotment. Given the limited demand, the operations in the form of EUR/USD foreign exchange swaps were 
discontinued at the end of January but could be 
started again in the future, if needed in view of 
prevailing market circumstances.6 APRIL 2009CENTRAL BANKS ANNOUNCE EXPANDED SWAP 
ARRANGEMENTSThe Bank of England, the ECB, the Federal 
Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss 
National Bank are announcing swap 
arrangements that would enable the provision of 
foreign currency liquidity by the Federal Reserve 
to US Þ nancial institutions. Should the need 
arise, euro, yen, sterling and Swiss francs would 
be provided to the Federal Reserve via these 
additional swap agreements with the relevant 
central banks. Central banks continue to work 
together and are taking steps as appropriate to 
foster stability in global Þ nancial markets.
ECB DECISIONSThe Governing Council of the ECB has decided 
to establish a temporary reciprocal currency 
arrangement (swap line) with the Federal 
Reserve. This agreement will provide the Federal 
Reserve with the capacity to offer liquidity of up 
to •80 billion. The Governing Council approved 
this swap line until 30 October 2009.10 JUNE 2009ECB ACTIVATES THE SWAP LINE WITH SVERIGES 
RIKSBANKThe ECB and Sveriges Riksbank have today 
decided to activate their temporary reciprocal 251ECBAnnual Report
2009currency agreement (swap line) whereby the Swedish central bank can borrow euro from the 
ECB in exchange for Swedish kronor.The ECB and Sveriges Riksbank signed a swap agreement on 20 December 2007 with the 
aim of facilitating the functioning of Þ nancial markets and providing euro liquidity to the latter 
if needed. The maximum amount that can be 
borrowed by Sveriges Riksbank is •10 billion, 
for a maturity of up to three months.25 JUNE 2009ECB AND SWISS NATIONAL BANK EXTEND THEIR 
SWISS FRANC LIQUIDITY-PROVIDING OPERATIONSThe Governing Council of the ECB has decided, 
in agreement with the Swiss National Bank, 
to continue conducting one-week Swiss franc 
liquidity-providing swap operations until 
at least 31 October 2009 to support further 
improvements in the short-term Swiss franc 
funding markets. ECB AND OTHER CENTRAL BANKS EXTEND THEIR 

SWAP LINES WITH FEDERAL RESERVEThe temporary reciprocal currency arrangements 
(swap lines) between the Federal Reserve and 
other central banks have been extended until 
1  February 2010.In particular, the Governing Council of the ECB and the Federal Open Market Committee 
of the Federal Reserve have extended until 
1 February 2010 their respective swap lines, 
whereby the Federal Reserve makes US  dollar 
liquidity available to the ECB while the 
ECB makes euro liquidity available to the 
Federal Reserve for distribution, when needed, 
to their respective counterparties.The Governing Council has also decided to continue conducting US dollar liquidity-
providing operations at terms of 7 and 84 days 
until at least 30 September 2009. A similar 
decision has been taken by the Bank of England 
and the Swiss National Bank. These operations will continue to take the form of repurchase 
operations against ECB-eligible collateral and 
to be carried out as Þ xed rate tenders with full 
allotment.Given the limited demand and the improved conditions in funding markets, the US dollar 
operations at terms of 28 days will be 
discontinued following the operation to be 
held on 28 July. As with the EUR/USD foreign 
exchange swaps which were discontinued at 
the end of January, the 28-day operations could 
be started again in the future if required by 
prevailing market circumstances.24 SEPTEMBER 2009ECB AND SWISS NATIONAL BANK EXTEND THEIR 
SWISS FRANC LIQUIDITY-PROVIDING OPERATIONSThe Governing Council of the ECB has 
decided, in agreement with the Swiss National 
Bank, to continue conducting one-week Swiss 
franc liquidity-providing swap operations 
until 31 January 2010 to support further 
improvements in the short-term Swiss franc 
funding markets.ECB AND OTHER CENTRAL BANKS DECIDE 

TO CONTINUE CONDUCTING US DOLLAR 

LIQUIDITY-PROVIDING OPERATIONSThe Governing Council of the ECB has decided, 
in agreement with other central banks including 
the Federal Reserve, to continue conducting 
US dollar liquidity-providing operations from 
October 2009 to January 2010.These Eurosystem operations will continue to take the form of seven-day repurchase 
operations against ECB-eligible collateral and 
to be carried out as Þ xed rate tenders with full 
allotment. Given the limited demand and the 
improved conditions in funding markets, the 
US dollar operations with a term of 84 days 
will be discontinued following the operation 
to be held on 6 October 2009 and maturing 
on 7 January 2010. The 84-day operations, as 
well as the other US dollar liquidity-providing 252ECBAnnual Report
2009operations that were previously discontinued, could be started again in the future if needed.A similar decision has been taken by the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank.18 JANUARY 2010ECB DISCONTINUES THE SWISS FRANC 
LIQUIDITY-PROVIDING OPERATIONSThe Governing Council of the ECB has decided, 
in agreement with the Swiss National Bank, 
to stop conducting one-week Swiss franc 
liquidity-providing swap operations after 
31 January 2010. This decision was made 
against the background of declining demand and 
improved conditions in the funding markets.27 JANUARY 2010ECB AND OTHER CENTRAL BANKS DECIDE 
TO DISCONTINUE THE TEMPORARY SWAP LINES 

WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVEIn coordination with other central banks, the 
ECB conÞ rms the expiration of its temporary 
liquidity swap lines with the Federal Reserve 
on 1 February 2010. These lines, which were 
established to counter pressures in global 
funding markets, are no longer needed given 
the improvements seen in the functioning of 
Þ nancial markets over the past year. Central 
banks will continue to cooperate as needed.In this context, the Governing Council of the ECB has decided, in agreement with the Federal 
Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan 
and the Swiss National Bank, to stop conducting 
US dollar liquidity-providing operations after 
31 January 2010.253ECBAnnual Report

2009GLOSSARYThis glossary contains selected terms that are used in the Annual Report. A more comprehensive and detailed glossary can be found on the ECB™s website.Balance of payments (b.o.p.): a statistical statement that summarises, for a speciÞ c period of time, the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world. The transactions considered are those involving goods, services and income; those involving Þ nancial claims on, and liabilities to, 
the rest of the world; and those (such as debt forgiveness) that are classiÞ ed as transfers.
Benchmark portfolio: in relation to investments, a reference portfolio or index constructed on the basis of the objectives for the liquidity and risk of, as well as the return on, the investments. The 
benchmark portfolio serves as a basis for comparison of the performance of the actual portfolio.Bond market: the market in which longer-term debt securities are issued and traded.Candidate countries: countries for which the EU has accepted an application for EU membership. Accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey began on 3 October 2005. In the case of the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the European Commission recommended the opening of 
accession negotiations in October 2009.Central counterparty (CCP): an entity that interposes itself, in one or more markets, between the 
counterparties to the contracts traded, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby guaranteeing the performance of open contracts.Central government: the government as deÞ ned in the European System of Accounts 1995 but excluding regional and local governments (see also general government).Central securities depository (CSD): an entity that: i) enables securities transactions to be processed and settled by book entry; ii) provides custodial services (e.g. the administration 
of corporate actions and redemptions); and iii) plays an active role in ensuring the integrity of 
securities issues. Securities can be held in a physical (but immobilised) form or in a dematerialised 
form (whereby they exist only as electronic records).Collateral: assets pledged or otherwise transferred (e.g. by credit institutions to central banks) as a guarantee for the repayment of loans, as well as assets sold (e.g. by credit institutions to central 
banks) under repurchase agreements.Consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector: a balance sheet obtained by netting out inter-MFI positions (e.g. inter-MFI loans and deposits) in the aggregated MFI balance sheet. It 
provides statistical information on the MFI sector™s assets and liabilities vis-à-vis residents of the euro area not belonging to this sector (i.e. the general government and other euro area residents) and vis-à-vis non-euro area residents. It is the main statistical source for the calculation of monetary 
aggregates, and it provides the basis for the regular analysis of the counterparts of M3.Corporate governance: rules, procedures and processes according to which an organisation is directed and controlled. The corporate governance structure speciÞ es the distribution of rights and responsibilities among the different participants in the organisation Œ such as the board, managers, 
shareholders and other stakeholders Œ and lays down the rules and procedures for decision-making.260ECBAnnual Report
2009Corporate proÞ tability: a measure of the earnings performance of corporations, mainly in relation to their sales, assets or equity. There are a number of different corporate proÞ tability ratios based on company Þ nancial statements, such as the ratio of operating income (sales minus operating expenses) to sales, the ratio of net income (operating and non-operating income, after tax, depreciation and extraordinary items) to sales, the return on assets (relating net income to total 
assets) and the return on equity (relating net income to shareholders™ funds). At the macroeconomic 
level, the gross operating surplus, based on national accounts, for instance in relation to GDP or value added, is often used as a measure of proÞ tability.Correspondent central banking model (CCBM): a mechanism established by the European System of Central Banks with the aim of enabling counterparties to use eligible collateral in a cross-border context. In the CCBM, NCBs act as custodians for one another. This means that each 
NCB has a securities account in its securities administration for each of the other NCBs and the 
European Central Bank.Cost of the external Þ nancing of non-Þ nancial corporations (real):
 the cost incurred by non-Þ nancial corporations when taking up new external funds. For euro area non-Þ nancial corporations, it is calculated as a weighted average of the cost of bank lending, the cost of debt securities and the cost of equity, based on the amounts outstanding (corrected for valuation effects) and deß ated by inß ation expectations.
Counterparty: the opposite party in a Þ nancial transaction (e.g. any party transacting with a central bank).
Credit derivative: a Þ nancial instrument which separates the 
credit risk from an underlying Þ nancial transaction, enabling the credit risk to be priced and transferred separately.Credit institution: i) an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credit for its own account; or ii) an undertaking or any other legal 
person, other than those under i), which issues means of payment in the form of electronic money.Credit risk: the risk that a counterparty will not settle the full value of an obligation Œ neither when it becomes due, nor at any time thereafter. Credit risk includes replacement cost risk and principal risk. It also includes the risk of the settlement bank failing.Debt security: a promise on the part of the issuer (i.e. the borrower) to make one or more payment(s) to the holder (the lender) at a speciÞ ed future date or dates. Such securities usually carry a speciÞ c rate of interest (the coupon) and/or are sold at a discount to the amount that will be repaid 
at maturity. Debt securities issued with an original maturity of more than one year are classiÞ ed as 
long-term.Deposit facility: a standing facility of the Eurosystem which counterparties may use to make overnight deposits at an NCB. Such deposits are remunerated at a pre-speciÞ ed interest rate (see also key ECB interest rates).Direct investment: cross-border investment for the purpose of obtaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy (assumed, in practice, for ownership of at least 10% of the 
ordinary shares or voting power). Included are equity capital, reinvested earnings and other capital 
associated with inter-company operations.261ECBAnnual Report
2009ECOFIN Council: the EU Council meeting in the composition of the ministers of economy and Þ nance.Economic analysis: one pillar of the European Central Bank™s framework for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability, which forms the basis for the Governing Council™s monetary policy decisions. The economic analysis focuses mainly on the assessment of current economic and Þ nancial developments and the implied short to medium-term risks to price stability from the perspective of the interplay between supply and demand in goods, services and factor markets at those horizons. Due attention is paid to the need to identify the nature of shocks 
affecting the economy, their effects on cost and pricing behaviour, and the short to medium-term 
prospects for their propagation in the economy (see also monetary analysis).Economic and Financial Committee (EFC): a consultative EU body which contributes to the preparation of the work of the ECOFIN Council and the European Commission. Its tasks include reviewing the economic and Þ nancial situation of the Member States and of the EU, and budgetary surveillance.Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): the process that led to the single currency, the euro, and the single monetary policy in the euro area, as well as to the coordination of the economic policies of the EU Member States. This process, as laid down in the Treaty, took place in three stages. Stage Three, the Þ nal stage, started on 1 January 1999 with the transfer of monetary competence to the European Central Bank and the introduction of the euro. The cash changeover on 1 January 2002 completed the process of setting up EMU.Effective exchange rate (EER) of the euro (nominal/real): a weighted average of bilateral euro exchange rates against the currencies of the euro area™s main trading partners. The European Central Bank publishes nominal EER indices for the euro against two groups of trading partners: 
the EER-21 (comprising the 11 non-euro area EU Member States and 10 trading partners outside 
the EU) and the EER-41 (composed of the EER-21 and 20 additional countries). The weights 
used reß ect the share of each partner country in the euro area™s trade in manufactured goods and account for competition in third markets. Real EERs are nominal EERs deß ated by a weighted 
average of foreign, relative to domestic, prices or costs. They are thus measures of price and cost 
competitiveness.EONIA (euro overnight index average): a measure of the effective interest rate prevailing in the euro interbank overnight market. It is calculated as a weighted average of the interest rates on 
unsecured overnight lending transactions denominated in euro, as reported by a panel of contributing 
banks.Equities: securities representing ownership of a stake in a corporation. They comprise shares traded on stock exchanges (quoted shares), unquoted shares and other forms of equity. Equities usually 
produce income in the form of dividends.Equity market: the market in which equities are issued and traded.ERM II (exchange rate mechanism II): the exchange rate mechanism which provides the framework for exchange rate policy cooperation between the euro area countries and the non-euro area EU Member States. ERM II is a multilateral arrangement with Þ xed, but adjustable, central rates and a standard ß uctuation band of ±15%. Decisions concerning central rates and, 262ECBAnnual Report
2009possibly, narrower ß uctuation bands are taken by mutual agreement between the EU Member State 
concerned, the euro area countries, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the other EU Member States participating in the mechanism. All participants in ERM II, including the ECB, have the right to initiate a conÞ dential procedure aimed at changing the central rates (realignment).EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate): the rate at which a prime bank is willing to lend funds 
in euro to another prime bank, as reported by a panel of contributing banks, computed daily for 
interbank deposits with different maturities of up to 12 months.Euro area: the area formed by the EU Member States whose currency is the euro and in which a single monetary policy is conducted under the responsibility of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. The euro area currently comprises Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Greece, 
Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, 
Slovakia and Finland.Eurogroup: an informal gathering of the ministers of economy and Þ nance of the EU Member States whose currency is the euro.
European Central Bank (ECB): the ECB lies at the centre of the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and has its own legal personality in accordance with the Treaty (Article 282(3)). It ensures that the tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem and the ESCB are implemented either through its own activities or through those of the NCBs, pursuant to the Statute 
of the ESCB. The ECB is governed by the Governing Council and the Executive Board, and, as a third decision-making body, by the General Council.European Monetary Institute (EMI): a temporary institution established at the start of Stage 
Two of Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January 1994. It went into liquidation following the 
establishment of the European Central Bank on 1 June 1998.European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95): a comprehensive and integrated system of macroeconomic accounts based on a set of internationally agreed statistical concepts, deÞ nitions, classiÞ cations and accounting rules aimed at achieving a harmonised quantitative description of the economies of the EU Member States. The ESA 95 is the EU™s version of the world System of 
National Accounts 1993 (SNA 93).European System of Central Banks (ESCB): composed of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the NCBs of all 27 EU Member States, i.e. it includes, in addition to the members of the Eurosystem, the NCBs of those Member States whose currency is not the euro. The ESCB is governed by the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the ECB, and, as a third decision-making body of the ECB, by the General Council.Eurosystem: the central banking system of the euro area. It comprises the European Central Bank and the NCBs of the EU Member States whose currency is the euro.Excessive deÞ cit procedure: the provision set out in Article 126 of the Treaty and speciÞ ed in Protocol (No 12) on the excessive deÞ cit procedure requires EU Member States to maintain budgetary discipline, deÞ nes the criteria for a budgetary position to be considered an excessive de
Þ cit and regulates steps to be taken following the observation that the requirements for the budgetary balance or government debt have not been fulÞ lled. Article 126 is supplemented by Council 
263ECBAnnual Report
2009Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deÞ cit procedure (as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1056/2005 of 27 June 
2005), which is one element of the Stability and Growth Pact.Executive Board: one of the decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank (ECB). It comprises the President and the Vice-President of the ECB and four other members appointed, 
since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, by the European Council, acting by a qualiÞ ed majority, on a recommendation from the EU Council.Financial stability: condition in which the Þ nancial system Œ comprising Þ nancial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures Œ is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of 
Þ nancial imbalances, thereby mitigating the likelihood of disruptions in the Þ nancial intermediation 
process which are severe enough to signiÞ cantly impair the allocation of savings to pro
Þ table investment opportunities.Financing gap of non-Þ nancial corporations: the Þ nancing gap can be de
Þ ned as the balance 
between the corporate savings (through retained earnings and depreciation allowances) and the 
non-Þ nancial investment of non-
Þ nancial corporations. The 
Þ nancing gap can also be de
Þ ned on 
the basis of the Þ nancial accounts, as the balance between the net acquisition of 
Þ nancial assets and 
the net incurrence of liabilities by non-Þ nancial corporations. There are statistical discrepancies 
between the two measures owing to differences in source statistics.Fine-tuning operation: an open market operation executed by the Eurosystem in order to deal with unexpected liquidity ß uctuations in the market. The frequency and maturity of Þ ne-tuning operations are not standardised.Foreign exchange swap: simultaneous spot and forward transactions exchanging one currency against another.General Council: one of the decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank (ECB). It comprises the President and the Vice-President of the ECB and the governors of all the NCBs of 
the European System of Central Banks.General government: a sector deÞ ned in the European System of Accounts 1995 as comprising resident entities that are engaged primarily in the production of non-market goods and services 
intended for individual and collective consumption and/or in the redistribution of national income 
and wealth. Included are central, regional and local government authorities, as well as social 
security funds. Excluded are government-owned entities that conduct commercial operations, such 
as public enterprises.Governing Council: the supreme decision-making body of the European Central Bank (ECB). It comprises all the members of the Executive Board of the ECB and the governors of the NCBs of the EU Member States whose currency is the euro.Gross operating surplus: the surplus (or deÞ cit) on the value of output of production activities after the costs of intermediate consumption, compensation of employees and taxes less subsidies 
on production have been deducted, but before payments and receipts of income related to the 
borrowing/renting or owning of Þ nancial and non-produced assets have been taken into account.
264ECBAnnual Report
2009Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP): a measure of the development of consumer prices that is compiled by Eurostat and harmonised for all EU Member States.Implied volatility: the expected volatility (i.e. standard deviation) in the rates of change of the price of an asset (e.g. a share or a bond). It can be derived from the asset™s price, maturity date and exercise price of its options, as well as from a riskless rate of return, using an option pricing model such as the Black-Scholes model.International investment position (i.i.p.): the value and composition of an economy™s outstanding net Þ nancial claims on (or Þ nancial liabilities to) the rest of the world.
Key ECB interest rates: the interest rates, set by the Governing Council, which reß ect the monetary policy stance of the European Central Bank. They are the rates on the main reÞ nancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility.Lisbon strategy: a comprehensive agenda of structural reforms aimed at transforming the EU into 
ﬁthe most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the worldﬂ, launched in 2000 by 
the Lisbon European Council.Longer-term reÞ nancing operation: a credit operation with a maturity of more than one week that is executed by the Eurosystem in the form of reverse transactions. The regular monthly operations have a maturity of three months. During the Þ nancial market turmoil that started in August 2007, supplementary operations with maturities ranging from one maintenance period to one year were conducted, the frequency of which varied.M1: a narrow monetary aggregate that comprises currency in circulation plus overnight deposits 
held with MFIs and central government (e.g. at the post ofÞ ce or treasury).M2: an intermediate monetary aggregate that comprises M1 plus deposits redeemable at a period of notice of up to and including three months (i.e. short-term savings deposits) and deposits with an 
agreed maturity of up to and including two years (i.e. short-term time deposits) held with MFIs and central government.M3: a broad monetary aggregate that comprises M2 plus marketable instruments, in particular repurchase agreements, money market fund shares/units, and debt securities with a maturity of up to and including two years issued by MFIs. Main reÞ nancing operation: a regular open market operation executed by the Eurosystem in the form of reverse transactions. Such operations are carried out through a weekly standard tender 
and normally have a maturity of one week.Maintenance period: the period over which credit institutions™ compliance with reserve requirements is calculated. The maintenance period begins on the settlement day of the Þ rst main reÞ nancing operation following the meeting of the Governing Council at which the monthly assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled. The European Central Bank publishes a calendar of the reserve maintenance periods at least three months before the start of the year.265ECBAnnual Report
2009Marginal lending facility: a standing facility of the Eurosystem which counterparties may use to receive overnight credit from an NCB at a pre-speciÞ ed interest rate against eligible assets (see also key ECB interest rates).Market liquidity risk: the risk that transactions on the Þ nancial market cannot be concluded or can only be concluded at worse than expected conditions owing to inadequate market depth or market disruption.Market risk: the risk of losses (in both on and off-balance-sheet positions) arising from movements in market prices.MFIs (monetary Þ nancial institutions): Þ nancial institutions which together form the money-
issuing sector of the euro area. These include the Eurosystem, resident credit institutions (as deÞ ned in EU law) and all other resident Þ nancial institutions whose business is to receive deposits 
and/or close substitutes for deposits from entities other than MFIs and, for their own account 
(at least in economic terms), to grant credit and/or invest in securities. The latter group consists 
predominantly of money market funds, i.e. funds that invest in short-term and low-risk instruments usually with a maturity of one year or less. MFI credit to euro area residents: MFI loans granted to non-MFI euro area residents (including general government and the private sector) and MFI holdings of securities (shares, other equity and debt securities) issued by non-MFI euro area residents.MFI interest rates: the interest rates that are applied by resident credit institutions and other MFIs, excluding central banks and money market funds, to euro-denominated deposits and loans vis-à-vis households and non-Þ nancial corporations resident in the euro area.MFI longer-term Þ nancial liabilities: deposits with an agreed maturity of over two years, deposits redeemable at a period of notice of over three months, debt securities issued by euro area MFIs with an original maturity of more than two years, and the capital and reserves of the euro area MFI sector.MFI net external assets: the external assets of the euro area MFI sector (such as gold, foreign currency banknotes and coins, securities issued by non-euro area residents and loans granted to non-euro area residents) minus the external liabilities of the euro area MFI sector (such as non-euro 
area residents™ deposits and repurchase agreements, as well as their holdings of money market fund shares/units and debt securities issued by MFIs with a maturity of up to and including two years).Minimum bid rate: the lower limit to the interest rates at which counterparties may submit bids in the variable rate tenders.Monetary analysis: one pillar of the European Central Bank™s framework for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability, which forms the basis for the Governing Council™s monetary policy decisions. The monetary analysis helps to assess medium to long-term trends in inß ation, in view of the close relationship between money and prices over extended horizons. The monetary analysis takes into account developments in a wide range of 
monetary indicators including M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and various measures of excess liquidity (see also economic analysis).266ECBAnnual Report
2009Monetary income: income accruing to the NCBs in the performance of the Eurosystem™s monetary policy function, derived from assets earmarked in accordance with guidelines established by the Governing Council and held against banknotes in circulation and deposit liabilities to credit institutions.Money market: the market in which short-term funds are raised, invested and traded using instruments which generally have an original maturity of up to and including one year.Open market operation: an operation executed on the initiative of the central bank in the Þ nancial market. With regard to their aims, regularity and procedures, Eurosystem open market operations can be divided into four categories: main reÞ nancing operations; longer-term reÞ nancing operations; Þ ne-tuning operations
; and structural operations. As for the instruments used, reverse transactions are the main open market instrument of the Eurosystem and can be employed in all four categories of operations. In addition, the issuance of debt certiÞ cates and outright transactions are available for structural operations, while outright transactions, foreign exchange swaps and the collection of Þ xed-term deposits are available for the conduct of Þ ne-tuning operations.
Option: a Þ nancial instrument that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell 
speciÞ c assets (e.g. a bond or a stock) at a predetermined price (the strike or exercise price) at or up 
to a certain future date (the exercise or maturity date).Other Þ nancial intermediary (OFI):
 a corporation or quasi-corporation (other than an insurance corporation or pension fund) that is engaged mainly in Þ nancial intermediation by incurring liabilities in forms other than currency, deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from 
institutional entities other than MFIs. OFIs include in particular corporations engaged primarily in long-term Þ nancing (such as Þ nancial leasing), securitised asset holdings, other Þ nancial holdings, securities and derivatives dealing (on their own account), venture capital and development capital.Portfolio investment: euro area residents™ net transactions and/or positions in securities issued by non-residents of the euro area (ﬁassetsﬂ) and non-residents™ net transactions and/or positions in securities issued by euro area residents (ﬁliabilitiesﬂ). Included are equities and debt securities (bonds and notes, and money market instruments), excluding amounts recorded in direct investment or reserve assets.Price stability: the maintenance of price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem. The Governing Council deÞ nes price stability as a year-on-year increase in the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. The Governing Council has also made it clear that, in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inß ation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
Primary balance: government net borrowing or net lending excluding interest payments on consolidated government liabilities.
Projections: the results of exercises conducted four times a year to project possible future macroeconomic developments in the euro area. Eurosystem staff projections are published in June and December, whereas European Central Bank (ECB) staff projections are published in March and September. They form part of the economic analysis pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB and are thus one of several inputs into the Governing Council™s assessment of the risks to price stability.267ECBAnnual Report
2009Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system: a settlement system in which processing and settlement take place on a transaction-by-transaction basis in real time (see also TARGET).Reference value for M3 growth: the annual growth rate of M3 over the medium term that is consistent with the maintenance of price stability. At present, the reference value for annual M3 growth is 4½%.Repurchase agreement: the process of borrowing money by combining the sale of an asset (usually a Þ xed income security) with the subsequent repurchase of that same asset on a speciÞ ed date for a 
slightly higher speciÞ ed price (which re
ß ects the borrowing rate).
Reserve base: the sum of the eligible balance sheet items (in particular liabilities) that constitute the basis for calculating the reserve requirement of a credit institution.Reserve ratio: the ratio deÞ ned by the central bank for each category of eligible balance sheet items included in the reserve base. The ratio is used to calculate reserve requirements.Reserve requirement: the minimum amount of reserves a credit institution is required to hold with the Eurosystem over a predeÞ ned maintenance period. Compliance with the requirement is determined on the basis of the average of the daily balances in the reserve accounts over the maintenance period.Reverse transaction: an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under a repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.Securities settlement system (SSS): a system which allows the transfer of securities, either free of payment (FOP) or against payment (delivery versus payment). Securitisation: the pooling of Þ nancial assets, such as residential mortgage loans, and their subsequent sale to a special-purpose vehicle, which then issues Þ xed income securities for sale to 
investors. The principal and interest of these securities depend on the cash ß ows produced by the 
pool of underlying Þ nancial assets.
Settlement risk: the risk that settlement in a transfer system will not take place as expected, usually owing to a party defaulting on one or more settlement obligations. This risk includes, in particular, 
operational risks, credit risks and liquidity risks.Stability and Growth Pact: intended to serve as a means of safeguarding sound government Þ nances in the EU Member States in order to strengthen the conditions for price stability and for strong, sustainable growth conducive to employment creation. To this end, the Pact prescribes that 
Member States specify medium-term budgetary objectives. It also contains concrete speciÞ cations on the excessive deÞ cit procedure. The Pact consists of the Resolution of the Amsterdam European Council of 17 June 1997 on the Stability and Growth Pact and two Council Regulations, namely 
i) Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary 
positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies as amended by Regulation 
(EC) No 1055/2005 of 27 June 2005, and ii) Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on 
speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deÞ cit procedure as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1056/2005 of 27 June 2005. The Stability and Growth Pact is complemented 
by the ECOFIN Council™s report entitled ﬁImproving the implementation of the Stability and 268ECBAnnual Report
2009Growth Pactﬂ, which was endorsed by the Brussels European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005. It is also complemented by a Code of Conduct entitled ﬁSpeciÞ cations on the implementation of the 
Stability and Growth Pact and Guidelines on the format and content of stability and convergence 
programmesﬂ, which was endorsed by the ECOFIN Council on 11 October 2005.Standing facility: a central bank credit facility available to counterparties at their own initiative. The Eurosystem offers two overnight standing facilities: the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility.Straight-through processing (STP): the automated end-to-end processing of trades/payment transfers Œ including, where relevant, the automated completion of conÞ rmation, matching, generation, clearing and settlement of orders.Systemic risk: the risk that the inability of one participant to meet its obligations in a system will cause other participants to be unable to meet their obligations when they become due, potentially 
with spillover effects (e.g. signiÞ cant liquidity or credit problems) threatening the stability of or conÞ dence in the 
Þ nancial system. That inability to meet obligations can be caused by operational 
or Þ nancial problems.
TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system): 
the Eurosystem™s real-time gross settlement system for the euro. The Þ rst-generation TARGET system was replaced by TARGET2 in May 2008.TARGET2: the second-generation TARGET system. It settles payments in euro in central bank money and functions on the basis of a single shared IT platform, to which all payment orders are 
submitted for processing.TARGET2-Securities (T2S): the Eurosystem™s single technical platform enabling central securities depositories and NCBs to provide core, borderless and neutral securities settlement services in central bank money in Europe.
Treaty of Lisbon (Lisbon Treaty): amends the EU™s two core treaties: the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community. The latter has been renamed the 
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Treaty of Lisbon was signed in Lisbon on 
13 December 2007 and entered into force on 1 December 2009. Unless stated otherwise, all 
references in this report to the ﬁTreatyﬂ refer to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 
and the references to article numbers reß ect the numbering in effect since 1 December 2009.
