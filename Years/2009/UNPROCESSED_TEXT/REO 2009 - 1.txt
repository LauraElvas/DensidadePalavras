Executive Summary 
 Following a collapse in confidence and global demand, Europe has entered a deep 
recession. Further amplification of the downturn through adverse feedback effects between 
the financial system and the real economy is a key risk. Inflation has fallen sharply against the 

background of a broad-based and rapid decline in consumption, investment, and exports. 
The downturn is being felt across Europe™s advanced and emerging economies, owing to 
similarities in their exposure to global financial and real shocks, and strong regional trade and 

financial integration. Country-specific factors matter too, however, with some countries 
facing more extreme financing difficulties implementing adjustment programs supported by 
the IMF and other sources, including the European Union (EU). 
 Even assuming more forceful policy actions, the downturn is likely to last until early 2010, 
and the subsequent recovery is expected to be gradual. Restoring confidence, adjusting to a 
lower level of wealth, and reducing leverage in the financial sector will take time. And with a 
globally synchronized downturn, the scope for Europe to benefit from an export-led 

recovery is limited. Following the jarring global repricing of risk and the diminishing of risk 
appetite, the cost of capital will remain high for some time, and several emerging economies 
are facing a sudden retrenchment of capital inflows. With the reversal of commodity prices 

and the widening of the output gap, deflationary pressures have increased, but inflation 
expectations so far remain anchored in positive territory. Economies adjusting under fixed 
exchange rate regimes are particularly likely to see their price levels decline, while nominal 

exchange rate depreciations elsewhere could lessen downward pressure on inflation. 
 Building on ongoing progress, further policy action, especially in the financial sector, is 
required to restore market trust and confidence in all countries. In addition to continued 
liquidity provision, credible loss recognition must be undertaken, taking fully into account 

prospective losses from the economic downturn. Viable institutions need to be recapitalized, 
with public support as needed, while others should be resolved. Equally important is the 
ring-fencing of impaired assets in order to reduce uncertainty.  
 With the downturn likely to be protracted, macroeconomic policies will need to continue 
to support demand, while keeping an eye on the medium and longer run. Further room to 
reduce interest rates should be exploited swiftly, and additional unconventional easing will 
have to be considered, with appropriate safeguards to limit market distortions, ensure 
reversibility, and preserve the integrity of central banks. Fiscal policies to soften the 
downturn should continue into 2010, with an emphasis on effectiveness and sustainability. 

The pursuit of growth-enhancing structural reforms to tackle the aging-related increases in 
public costs looming on the horizon will be particularly important. 
 For Europe, addressing the current economic and financial crisis coherently and 
comprehensively across advanced and emerging economies provides an opportunity to 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

emerge from the crisis with stronger policy institutions and substantial progress made 
toward its goals of integration and convergence. The benefits of coordination are particularly 
large in the financial area and in mitigating regional downside risks. Agreeing on basic 
methodologies to determine capital needs and the approach to deal with impaired assets will 

avoid distortions and policy arbitrage, and minimize collective costs. Similarly, full home-
host coordination on loss recognition and recapitalization of cross-border banks is an 
important element in this approach. Potential debt-servicing difficulties and disruptive 

exchange rate movements should be preempted with the involvement of EU institutions, 
and of the IMF where needed, by extending currency swap lines for emerging markets and 
clarifying the road maps for euro adoption.  
 Beyond the immediate crisis, improving the EU™s financial stability framework will be 
essential. Implementing the recommendations of
 the de Larosière report deserves strong 
support. Nonetheless, reforms will eventually need to go further to ensure a cross-sectoral 

integration of supervisory arrangements and establish an effective framework for cross-

border crisis management and resolution. 
 With active fiscal policy firmly back on the agenda, it is important to address questions of 
its effectiveness and coordination (Chapter 2). Especially in a tightly integrated region under 
a common currency, such as the euro area, the benefits of fiscal expansion spill across 
borders while costsŠnamely increasing debt levels and potentially higher financing 
expenditureŠamass locally. This creates significant room for a coordinated fiscal expansion, 

as a simultaneous areawide stimulus would yield much stronger growth effects than a 
stimulus in just one country. As for the content of the fiscal package, in current 
circumstances, spending on infrastructure and targeted transfers are likely to have the largest 

multipliers. General tax cuts or subsidies, either
 for consumers or firms, are likely to be less 
effective. 
 Effective fiscal policies will need to take into account the sustainability of public finances. 
While global developments have played a role in the recent increase in euro area sovereign 

interest rate differentials, country-specific factorsŠin particular rapidly rising projected debt 
levels, as well as concerns about the solvency of national banking systems and their 
budgetary consequencesŠhave increasingly become important. One implication is that the 

impact of expansionary fiscal action will be larger in countries with lower public debt and 
relatively healthy banking sectors; this adds to the call to tailor fiscal action to the fiscal room 
available. Another implication is that, to maintain fiscal space, countries need to focus on 

reversible fiscal measures, formulate a plausible medium-term strategy, strengthen their fiscal 
frameworks at the national level, and make full use of the medium-term framework tied to 
the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) where applicable.  
 Some of these concerns also feature in emerging market economies, although with 
substantial variation within the region (Chapter 3). In emerging Europe, too, the crisis has 
put a premium on sound policies at the country level. A large part of the differences in the 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

way the crisis affected individual countries can be explained by diverging macroeconomic 
performance and external vulnerabilities, such as current account deficits. At the same time, 
the apparent ability of new EU member countries to attract cheaper funding because of their 
EU membership, the so-called EU halo effect, has disappeared. Gone as well is the notion 

that bank-based financing of external capital needs will guarantee stable capital inflows 
during a crisis. With western European parent banks in need of government support 
themselves, markets are taking a less sanguine 
view of extensive foreign ownership in the 
financial sector. Increasingly, recapitalization of banks is becoming a regional issue, merely 
underscoring the advantages of a coordinated European approach.
 The banking sector could also hold a key to the speed of the recovery in emerging 
Europe. Measures to support credit, for instance through bank recapitalizations, can hold off 

a tightening of credit conditions, support 
consumption, and prevent recessions from 
becoming overly protracted in some countries. This mechanism is emphasized in recent 

IMF-supported programs, which have provided funds especially for meeting bank 

recapitalization needs. To reduce the procyclical volatility of bank profits and lending in the 
future, prudential rules on provisioning need to be strengthened once the crisis has 
dissipated. Also on the policy agenda should be the need for enhanced cross-border 
coordination among home and host central banks, supervisors, and governments. 
11. Outlook: Galvanizing Recovery  
 Europe is going through a deep recession, driven by a 
collapse in confidence and global demand, and by adverse 

feedback effects between its financial system and the real 
economy. Unprecedented policy actions have brought about a 
measure of stability and cushioned the downturn. However, 
establishing a solid economic recovery will require additional 
and effectively coordinated policy interventions. The crisis 
provides an opportunity to strengthen economic and financial 
integration in Europe, including by strongly supporting 
emerging economies, that should not be missed.

1 What started as a 
retrenchment by consumers in response to deflating 

real estate markets and commodity price hikes, 
broadened to encompass all components of demand 
(Figure 1). Tighter financial conditions and greater 
uncertainty about the outlook triggered a sharp fall 
in capital spending. The intensification of the 
financial crisis in September 2008 caused an abrupt 
increase in uncertainty and led to a downward 

reassessment of wealth and income prospects. In 
turn, these developments prompted households to 
raise savings rates and to postpone spending on 
most durables, even though falling commodity 
prices helped boost real disposable income. This 
drop in demand and dearth of credit set off an 
unprecedented collapse in trade volumesŠwith euro 
area exports falling at an annual rate of 26 percent in 
the last quarter of 2008. Tight global trade links 

synchronized this shock, while cross-border capital 
flows dwindled, engulfing previously resilient 
emerging economies in the crisis. Comparatively

nature of the economic downturn. 
stronger trade and financial integration within 
Europe added a crucial intraregional dimension. As 
a result, average growth in 2008 slowed by similar 
amounts in advanced and emerging economies, with 
some differentiation because of country-specific 

circumstances (Table 1). 
 Against this background, inflation has fallen 
sharply. The reversal of the commodity price 
increases has pushed headline inflation to very low 
levels in advanced economies and diminished 
concerns about inflation in many emerging 

economies (Figure 2). Core inflation, though holding 
up at higher levels, has nonetheless been falling in 
several countries, indicating that the sharp 
weakening of activity is perhaps reducing pricing 
power earlier than usual. Even so, downward price 
pressures are less pronounced in countries that are 
experiencing nominal exchange rate depreciations 
beyond levels required to bring real effective rates in 
line with fundamentals.

1. OUTLOOK: GALVANIZING RECOVERY 
3toxic assets and a reassessment of the viability of 
existing banking models. Wholesale liquidity 
evaporated, complex assets proved to be difficult to 

value, lack of transparency about counterparty risk 
undermined trust, and markets took a dim view of 
leverage. Hence, many banks came under severe 
pressure (Figure 3) and several had to be bailed out 
or resolved, a process that is still ongoing. 
 Model-based analysis suggests that the initial 
financial shock was transmitted to the real economy, 
primarily through the equity price channel and in a 
more differentiated fashion through the credit 
channel (Galesi and Sgherri, 2009). In addition to 
confidence and wealth effects adversely affecting 
demand, the fall in equity pricesŠwhich often 
amounted to more than 50 percentŠraised the cost 
of capital and dampened investment. Such a shock is 
estimated to have had its strongest impact on the 

advanced economies of Europe, but the Baltic 
economies would seem similarly sensitive (Figure 4). 
Central European economies appear more 
moderately susceptible, while southeastern Europe 
is more insulated. These model findings are 
consistent with the view that banks operating in 
emerging Europe, which relied more on traditional 
business models, were often not affected by direct 
exposure to toxic assets. 
 However, the flight to safety associated with the 
intensification of the financial crisis in late 2008 
rapidly put paid to the notion that emerging 
economies would decouple in a meaningful way. 
Indeed, one of the key features of the ongoing 
financial crisis is a jarring global repricing of risk 
(Figure 5). Thus far, important new crisis events

the relative price of domestic assets in emerging 
economies. The pressure to reduce leverage in 
parent banks in advanced countries and higher 
perceived risks drove up credit yields and led to a 
reduction in inflows to most emerging economies. 
As a result, credit growth in these economies has 
been declining precipitously, albeit from high levels 
(Figure 6). Some countries are already experiencing a 
credit crunch, with real credit stagnating, and 
domestic demand is being adversely affected 
everywhere. 
 The trade channel proved equally important in 
propagating the crisis. During the past decade, trade 

links increased globally and very rapidly between 
Europe and Asia (Figure 7). When demand in 
advanced countries began to falter, Europe was not 
just affected through its ties with other advanced 
economies such as the Unites States, but also 
directly and indirectly through its Asian connection. 
With Europe relatively specialized in consumer 
durables and capital goods, it was hard hit by the 
sharp cutback in orders for such goods. This 

explains, for example, why GermanyŠan economy 
without significant private sector liabilities or an 
asset boom but specialized in capital goods 
production and an emphasis on export demandŠis 
experiencing a comparatively sharp decline in 
activity. Demand from oil-exporting countriesŠ
another important destination for European 
producersŠhas also been weakening in response to 
the drop in oil revenues. 
 Within Europe, the unfavorable feedback loop 
across borders through both trade and finance 
channels appears to be in full swing. Europe is one

5of the most financially and economically integrated 
regions in the world (Figure 8). Increased intrafirm 
outsourcing with firms located in emerging 
countries and foreign ownership of their financial 
systems have strengthened the interdependencies 
between advanced and emerging economies in 
Europe. Indeed, unlike in other parts of the world, 
these links have set in motion a process of rapid 
convergence, from which advanced economies have 

profited.
2 While generally beneficial, such integration 
also implies that adverse shocks are transmitted 
more swiftly across borders.
3. . . with Homegrown Risks Leading to 
Cross-Country Differentiation 
 Not all countries are equally affected by the 
ongoing economic and financial crisis. In particular, 
the crisis has underscored that risky policies yield 

poor returns when fault lines appear in the global 
economy. Vulnerabilities are overlooked when 
global conditions are benign but ultimately lead to 
differentiation across countries (IMF, 2008c). The 
Baltic economies, Ireland, Spain, and the United

2 By some estimates, growth in advanced economies was higher 
by 0.2 to 0.4 percent a year during 2002Œ06 as a result of the 
rapid convergence by emerging economies (IMF, 2007). 
3 Empirical analysis shows that, since 1999, risk sharing has 
begun to emerge across Europe, but exposure to shocks has 
also risen (IMF, 2008d). 
Kingdom have been disproportionately affected as a 
result of the deflation of homegrown real estate 
booms. Mismatches in the financial systemŠbe it in 
terms of funding models, maturities, or currenciesŠ
and high leverage have turned sour in a number of 
countries (e.g., Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, and the 
United Kingdom). Insufficiently prudent 
macroeconomic policies, reflected in large fiscal 
and/or current account deficits or high public debt 
have also created difficulties (e.g., Greece and 

Hungary). And commodity exporters are having to 
adjust policies rapidly to deal with large adverse 
terms of trade shocks (e.g., Russia and Ukraine).

6Impromptu Policy Reaction 
Unprecedented Policy Actions Are 
Under Way . . .  
 Policymakers have taken extraordinary actions in 
response to the deepening financial and economic 
crisis. In broad terms, central banks have been 
providing liquidity support and easing monetary 
policy; governments have committed large resources 
to guarantee, recapitalize, and resolve financial 
institutions, as well as support certain asset markets; 
and fiscal policy is being used to shore up demand. 
Within these contours, the response has differed 
across countries to take into account features of the 

financial system (e.g., the extent of securitization), 
the health of the banking systems (e.g., legacy of 
toxic assets), changes in size and direction of cross-
border capital flows, and fiscal sustainability 
considerations. 
 What has been the effect of these policy actions 
so far? Their aim has been to restore confidence, 
stabilize the banking system, and support demand to 
avoid an adverse downward spiral. A key issue is the 
interaction of policies, with the effectiveness of 
monetary and fiscal policies dependent on a  
restoration of normal functioning to financial 

markets. While progress is noteworthy in several 
areas, policy actions have not yet yielded a decisive 
breakthrough: 
Progress is most visible regarding liquidity 
concerns, which have been adequately dealt with 
in advanced economies and mitigated in most 

emerging economies. Stresses in money markets 

peaked in October 2008, as reflected in very high 
liquidity premiums (Figure 9). Widening of 
collateral, unlimited provision of liquidity at fixed 

rates, and currency swap lines among the major 
currencies, accompanied by the rapid expansion 
of central banks™ balance sheets, appear to have 

removed these premiums for advanced 
economies.4However, financial crisis measures have not yet 

restored normal functioning to the financial 
system. Volatility remains very high, transaction 

volumes are small in several market segments, 
and insurance against counterparty risk, including 
sovereigns, is very costly. Moreover, tightening 

of lending standards 
persists. Guarantees 
extended on bank liabilities have preempted 
runs, while recapitalization and resolution of 
_______ 
4 No good measures of the liquidity premium are readily 
available for emerging economies, thus preventing an 
assessment for these countries.

1. OUTLOOK: GALVANIZING RECOVERY 
7troubled institutions have curbed, though not 
fully eliminated, systemic risks. For some 
advanced and several emerging economies, the 
financial crisis has turned into a credit crunch, 

while for others demand and supply factors 

remain difficult to disentangle. In the euro area, 
credit to households has been falling for some 
time, but credit to the corporate sector has only 

recently stopped expanding. 
Monetary policy easing has helped financial 

institutions, at least through a lowering of 
funding costs. Most European central banks 
have reduced policy rates substantially since the 

onset of the crisis. For some emerging 
economies, this process was complicated by the 
need to stem capital outflows. Some central 

banks, primarily the Bank of England, have also 
taken measures to support nonbank sectors 
directly, while in other cases (e.g., Spain) fiscal 

resources are being deployed to restart segments 

of the financial markets. 
The effectiveness of monetary policy 
transmission to the economy seems to have been 
somewhat, though not excessively, impaired. In 

the euro area, policy rates continue to be 

transmitted to market rates and the credit 
channel remains functional; however, this 
channel is adversely affected by the tightening of 

lending standards and pressure on banks™ capital 
(Box 1). So far, inflation expectations, which are 
key for monetary policy transmission, remain 

anchored close to policy objectives. 
Fiscal policy is supporting activity through 
automatic stabilizers and discretionary stimulus 

where fiscal space is available. The general 
government deficit is set to increase from 

1.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 5.8 percent of 

GDP by 2010 (Table 2). The operation of social 
safety nets and increased spending on 
infrastructure are cushioning the downturn, 

while measures specifically targeted to 
households affected by the mortgage crisis are 
helping as well. Even so, overall uncertainty and 

a poorly functioning financial system are holding 
back private spending, while concerns about 
fiscal sustainability are raising yields, forcing 
some countries to curb deficits (see Chapter 2 
for a detailed analysis of fiscal policy in advanced 
economies). Some emerging economies (e.g., 

Russia) have provided fiscal stimulus, but most 

of them have to tighten in light of financing 
constraints and exchange rate pressure. 
. . . with Cross-Border Implications 
 In an interconnected world, policy actions have 
consequences beyond national borders, thus 
bringing policy coordination into play. Reflecting the 
difficulty of gauging the scope of a brewing crisis 
and its systemic linkages, it was no surprise that 
policymakers reacted in the first instance on a 

national scale in the current crisis. But its global and 
regional dimensions soon became apparent, 
fostering efforts at policy coordination within the 
European Union (EU): 
In the area of monetary policy and liquidity 
provision, coordination proved to be relatively 

straightforward among advanced economies, but 
more difficult with respect to emerging 
economies, which have diverse exchange rate 

regimes and often face a different set of 

problems. Advanced economies in Europe 
coordinated monetary easing in October 2008 
and established currency swap lines, leaving 

emerging economies on their own, except for 
some repurchase facilities. 
Fiscal policy coordination took more time, but in 

late 2008 the EU committed itself to a stimulus 
of about 1½ percent of GDP under a menu 

approach in terms of both size and type of 
measures. As a result, fiscal policy differs 
appreciably across countries. 
Achieving coordination of financial crisis 
management measures has been challenging, in 
part because financial sy
stems differ substantially 
from one country to another and also because of 

the initial beliefs that Europe™s financial system 

would escape a meltdown and emerging Europe 

would remain resilient. Here, too, a menu 
approach was adopted while efforts were made

1. OUTLOOK: GALVANIZING RECOVERY 
9Box 1. Has the Financial Crisis Impaired Monetary Transmission in the Euro Area? 
In the face of the worst financial crisis in decades, the European Central Bank (ECB) has eased monetary 
policy significantly since October 2008, bringing its policy rate down (by 300 basis points) to 1.25 percent (as 
of end-April, 2009). The cost of credit to both businesses and households also declined, but by much less, as 
credit spreads initially increased and eased only recently. These developments, as well as the tightening of 
credit standards, raise the question of whether the effectiveness of monetary policy has been weakened 
during the recent financial crisis.  
Main Transmission Channels 
Monetary policy affects the economy through several channels. The main ones are the interest rate channel, 
the bank-lending channel, and the broad credit channel. In the 
interest rate channel
, expansionary monetary 
policy lowers short nominal interest rates, which under sticky prices affect long nominal and real interest 
rates; these, in turn, affect the user cost of capital and the  relative price of future versus present 
consumption and, hence, aggregate demand. In the 
bank-lending channel
, the central bank can affect the supply 
of credit provided by financial intermediaries, and thus the cost of capital to bank-dependent borrowers, not 
only by changing interest rates but also by changing the quantity of base money. In the 
broad credit channel
,given financial frictions, monetary policy affects not only interest rates, but also the financial position of 
borrowers and the relative cost of external and internal funds. In addition, 
expectations
play an important role. 
Expectations influence significantly the effectiveness of all other channels of monetary transmission to the 
extent that central bank policy is anticipated by the market and priced into the yield curve. 
Empirical Approach and Results 
To gauge the extent to which ECB action can influence interest rates across the financial market, several 
bivariate vector autoregression (VAR) models are 
used. The VAR impulse responses show that policy 
rate changes have been transmitted to market rates, 
although the degree and the speed of pass-through 
varies.1 The impact on the three-month euro 
interbank offered rate (Euribor) is close to one-for-
one, and the speed of adjustment is fast, with the 
maximum impact transmitted within a month (first 
figure). The initial impact on corporate bond yields 
and new loans to nonfinancial corporations is 
similarly quick, although the full adjustment is more 
protracted and the impact on higher-grade bond 
yields is smaller than on lower-grade bond yields 
(0.6 to 0.7 percentage point for AA- and AAA-
rated bonds versus 1.2 percentage points

January 2003ŒDecember 2008 for loans to nonfinancial corporations and households.

for BBB-rated bonds). The pass-through of the policy rates to loans for house purchases is somewhat 
smaller and the speed of adjustment slower.
2The VAR residuals suggest 
that the pass-through from 
the policy rates to market 
rates has become somewhat 
less reliable since the 
beginning of the financial 
crisis (second figure). In 
particular, the residuals of 
the vast majority of the 
market rates have increased 
since the beginning of 
2008, and in most cases 
significantly. IMF (2008e) 
also provides empirical 
support for the less 
efficient pass-through over 
the past year, pointing to 
the dislocation of the 
markets for short-term 
bank financing as the most 
likely cause. 
An alternative approach to gauge the effectiveness of monetary transmission is with the help of a theory-
based framework that has an aggregate supply-demand block and features the above channels.
3 The effects 
of the bank-lending and credit channels are captured by including in the aggregate demand either a spread 
between loan and short rates or a spread between corporate bond yields and short rates. The model is closed 
with a standard monetary policy reaction function. As in Rudebusch and Wu (2003), the inflation 
expectations are modeled as an unobserved component, but instead of using a combination of a macro 
model and a yields-only finance model, they are estimated within the macro model. 
Variance decomposition from the models suggest that the interest rate channel dominates monetary 
transmission. Specifically, it accounts for over 30 percent of inflation variation and close to 50 percent of 
output variation. Importantly, the results imply a major role for expectations, which account for around 
40 percent of inflation variation and about 30 percent of output variation. The results suggest some role for 
the bank-lending and credit channels, which explain about 15 percent and 10 percent of output variation, 
respectively. 
2 These results are in line with findings of other studies: IMF (2008e) notes that the three-month Euribor 
rates have a more stable and reliable relation with the policy rate than other lender rates, and Sørensen and 
Werner (2006) find that bank rates on corporate loans appear to adjust most completely, followed by 
mortgage loan rates. 
3The models are estimated with monthly seasonally adjusted data over the period from January 1995 to 
December 2008 for the bank-lending channel and from January 1999 to December 2008 for the credit 
channel, using Bayesian methods.

1. OUTLOOK: GALVANIZING RECOVERY 
11asRegarding the impact 
of the financial crisis, 
the results suggest that 
the effectiveness of the 
channels declined 
somewhat but was not 
significantly impaired 
(third figure). Indeed, 
the variability of the 
residuals has increased 
since mid-2008, but 
remains broadly within the ± 1 standard deviation band. 
Interestingly, expectations rema
in remarkably stable. Inflation 
expectations derived from the model have declined somewhat 
since mid-2008, but started to increase toward the end of the 
yearŠin line with market-based inflation expectations.  
The above results agree with findings elsewhere in the literature. 
For example, Angeloni and others (2002) conclude that the interest 
rate channel is the most important for monetary policy 
transmission in the euro area. However, they also find that the 
bank-lending channel plays a role, although its importance varies 
among euro area countries. And Beechey, Johannsen, and Levin (2008) find that inflation expectations in the 
euro area are less variable than in other advanced countries. 
To summarize, while interest rate transmission is clearly not insulated from the financial turmoil, ECB policy 
rate changes are still transmitted to market rates. Second, while there are also signs that the credit channel 
has been affected by the crisis, it remains functional. Third, owing to the ECB™s credibility, inflation 
expectations, which play an important role for monetary policy transmission, remain anchored. 
to harmonize key parameters of policy 
interventions. 
 Despite these efforts, coordination remains 
insufficient in the area of financial crisis 
management. Measures taken by EU governments 
to resolve strains in the financial system have 
differed in scale (Figure 10) and scope. Deposit 
guarantees were increased 
nearly everywhere, but 
efforts to harmonize their level yielded only an 
agreement to raise their minimum, while most 
countries adopted higher levels and some extended 
unlimited guarantees. Even though the European 
Central Bank argued against guaranteeing interbank 
lending, a number of countries extended such 
guarantees either to all or to selected financial 
institutions. Conditions for guaranteeing debt 
securities by financial institutions were harmonized 
across the EU, but only after some countries had 
already provided such a guarantee with different 
parameters. The pricing of public capital provided to 
financial institutions was harmonized, but other 
parameters, such as the type of instrument used, the 
commitment to extend credit, conditions on 

remuneration of management, and dividend policy, 
continue to differ. Finally, 
schemes to support assets 
vary a great deal, ranging from the Swiss ﬁbadﬂ bank 

model to the United Kingdom™s insurance scheme 
for troubled assets, with Belgian and Dutch hybrids

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
12staking out the middle ground, and a Spanish 
scheme providing liquidity for high-quality assets. 
 These discrepancies in policy actions have 
generated some tensions 
across borders and reduced 
their effectiveness as a lack of coordination has 

undermined confidence. While monetary and fiscal 
measures to promote demand have generally 
positive spillover effects across borders, differences 
in the timing and nature of
 measures adopted to deal 
with the financial crisis initially had adverse 

consequences. The unilateral increases in deposit 
guarantees by some countries forced others to 

follow suit, leaving those countries with large 
financial systems relative to their fiscal resources, 
including most emerging economies, at a 
disadvantage. Resolution of troubled cross-border 
institutions failed to adhere to agreed principles, 
leading to a breakup along national lines. Extension 
of sovereign guarantees to bank debt changed the 
competitive landscape as sovereign spreads began to 
determine funding costs, which, together with two 

countries setting up na
tional interbank schemes 
threatened a segmentation of the euro area 

interbank market. Attempts to revive credit as quid 
pro quo for recapitalization focused on national 
markets, with uncertain consequences for the 
behavior of foreign branches and subsidiaries. 
 The financial crisis in advanced economies has 
affected emerging economies mainly through a 
retrenchment of investors, associated with the global 
increase in risk aversion and the flight to safety. 
Even so, the country-specific components of 
sovereign spreads of the New Member States (NMS) 
of the EU showed a significant increase after the 
announcement of the broad financial sector support 
measures at the October 12, 2008 EU summit, and 
another spike one to two weeks later when several 

advanced economies put in place specific support 
measures (Figure 11). Hence, there is some evidence 
that crisis management measures in advanced 
economies had adverse consequences on emerging 
economies, perhaps because investors saw their 
relative stability diminished. However, for most of 
the NMS the impact on spreads dissipated over the 
next several months. The return of these spread 
components to levels observed before the 

announcements may be partly due to public 
commitments by parent banks to stand by their 
subsidiaries, the adoption by emerging economies of 
their own measures to support their financial 
system, and official support provided to countries 
facing difficulties, including through IMF-supported 
programs containing financial sector support 
measures. Multilateral Help Is Being Extended 
 Facing financing difficulties, a number of 
countries have undertaken adjustment programs 
supported by financial assistance from the IMF 
(Belarus, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, Romania, Serbia, 

and Ukraine, as of April 14, 2009) and other bilateral 
and multilateral sources, including the EU through 
its balance of payments facility for non-euro-area 
EU members (see Table 3 for details). Poland has 
requested access to the IMF™s new Financial Credit 
Line (FCL) to bolster international confidence.

is accessible to IMF member countries with very strong 
fundamentals, policies, and track records of their 
implementation.

1. OUTLOOK: GALVANIZING RECOVERY 
13While the global financial crisis was a common 
trigger, country-specific factors proved to be a key 
catalyst (see Chapter 3 for details on why crises 

happened where they did). Thus, the design of 
adjustment programs had to focus on country-
specific circumstances. To varying degrees, measures 
to shore up the financial system were a crucial 
element of all programs. Similarly, constraints on 
available financing and the need to establish 
confidence in policies made fiscal adjustment 
essential. In some cases it also helped curb demand 
to underpin competitiveness-enhancing relative 

price changes. Advice on monetary and exchange 
rate policy differed, reflecting authorities™ 
preferences and the need 
to mitigate contagion. 
Responding to pressure on capital flows, interest 
rates rose in most countries with fixed exchange 
rates. Countries with flexible exchange rates initially 
tightened monetary policy but with the intent to 
unwind such tightening as conditions improved (as, 
e.g., in Hungary and Iceland). Even so, interest rate 
differentials widened following the sharp reduction 
in policy rates in most advanced economies. Belarus 

devalued its currency and switched the peg to a 
basket of currencies to improve competitiveness and 
reduce its vulnerability to external shocks; Latvia, 
meanwhile, kept its peg in line with its preference 
for retaining an exchange rate anchor, while 
improving competitiveness through adjustments in 
wages and productivity instead. 
Uncertain Outlook 
The Road to Recovery May Be Long . . .  
 Typically, recessions associated with a financial 
crisis take time to recover from, and globally 
synchronized recessions are deeper than others 
(IMF, 2009d, Chapter 3). Inventories accumulated in 
the last half of 2008 and high-frequency indicators 
suggest a further sharp fall in activity in the first part 
of 2009 (Figure 12). Financial conditions remain 
tight, as reflected for example, in wide corporate 
bond spreads, which are indicative of a rising tide of 
corporate bankruptcies. The crisis has also hit 

emerging economies hard, with sovereigns facing a 
sharp increase in the cost of funding and private 
borrowers even more adversely affected. 
Confidence, which was already on a weakening 
trend before the intensification of the financial 
crisis, has been in free fall through early 2009, 
leading a similar decline in industrial production. 
And equity values, despite a rebound in late March, 
remain 50 percent or more below their level of 
18 months ago, depressing sentiment.

Address the main pressure points in public finances and 
the banking sector:  
Ł Substantial fiscal adjustment, to provide confidence that 
the government's financing need can be met in the short  
and medium run.  
Ł Up-front bank capital enhancement, to ensure that 
banks are sufficiently strong to weather the imminent 
economic downturn, both in Hungary and in the region.  
Ł Large external financing assi

of a run on Hungary's debt and currency markets. 
In addition to the financial assistance from the IMF, 
the program is also supported by $8.4 billion from 
the European Union, and $1.3 billion from the 
World Bank. 
The first review of the program was completed in 
March 2009.

Ł Help the economy adjust to the new economic 
environment by allowing the exchange rate to float, 
aiming to achieve a balanced budget in 2009, phasing in 
increases in energy tariffs, and pursuing an incomes 
policy that protects the population while slowing price 
increases.  
Ł Restore confidence and financial stability (recapitalizing 
viable banks, and dealing promptly with banks with 
difficulties). 
Ł Protect vulnerable groups in society (an increase in 
targeted social spending to shield vulnerable groups).  
Since the program adoption, the global economic 
environment has deteriorated markedly hitting 
Ukraine harder than expected. This has required a 
recalibration of economic policies. The IMF team 
and the authorities have been discussing revisions 
to the program's balanced budget target for 2009,

Ł Prevent further sharp króna depreciation by maintaining 
an appropriately tight monetary policy and temporary 
restrictions on capital outflows. 
Ł Develop a comprehensive and collaborative strategy for 
bank restructuring by (1) putting in place an efficient 
organizational structure to facilitate the restructuring 
process, (2) proceeding promptly with the valuation of 
banks' assets, (3) maximizing asset recovery in the old 
banks, (4) ensuring the fair and equitable treatment of 
depositors and creditors of the intervened banks, and (5) 
strengthening supervisory practices and the insolvency 
framework.  
The program includes the development of a strong 
medium-term fiscal consolidation plan to deal with 
the very substantial increase in public sector debt 
that is likely as a result of the budgetary cost of

1. OUTLOOK: GALVANIZING RECOVERY 
17economies access to foreign currency liquidity plays 
a key role as well. All economies have to contend 
with the expected deterioration in asset quality as a 
result of the recession. 
 As the retrenchment of cross-border capital 
positions continues, large external imbalances will 
need to be corrected. All types of capital flows, 

including foreign direct investment, are likely to 
diminish sharply, causing serious adjustment 
problems for countries that had been running large 
current account deficits. For members of a currency 
union (e.g., Ireland or Spain) or countries with 
pegged exchange rates (e.g., the Baltic economies 
and Bulgaria) the adjustment will be more arduous 
than for countries with more flexible exchange rates. 
However, even in these latter cases, the task ahead 

will be difficult as exchange rate volatility may 
prevent use of monetary easing to support demand, 
while adverse balance sheet effectsŠhouseholds 
and businesses in many emerging economies hold 
sizable foreign currency liabilitiesŠwill dampen 
spending and raise levels of nonperforming loans. 
 What will break the adverse feedback loop 
between sectors and across countries? While lower 
commodity prices and a deceleration in the rate of 
decline of equity and house prices will help, 
extensive policy support will be crucial. The 
measures undertaken so far have provided a good 
foundation, but further action is required, especially 
in the financial sector and as regards support for 
domestic demand into next year. These additional 

actionsŠwell coordinated for increased 
effectivenessŠshould lead to a normalization of 
conditions in the course of 2009, laying the 
foundations for a recovery to take hold during 2010. 
 Our baseline projection assumes that these 
additional policy actions are undertaken and that no 

more systemic shocks occur, so that a floor is 
established under the decline in output by the 
second quarter of 2010. A very gradual recovery is 
expected to take hold thereafter, with growth 
momentum not returning until 2011. Commodity 
prices are expected to remain stable for the next two 
years, and modest credit growth would resume in 
the second half of 2010. As a result, advanced 
economies should see activity fall by about 4 percent 
in 2009 and ½ percent on average in 2010, though 
growth should pick up to slightly more than 
1 percent by end-2010 (Table 1). Output in 
emerging economies is projected to fall by 5 percent 
in 2009 and recover by ¾ percent in 2010. While 
activity in advanced economies will be similar across 
countries, growth in emerging economies is 
anticipated to show a wider dispersion. 
 Potential growth is also projected to be 
appreciably lower, especially in the near term. With 
overcapacity being worked off in some sectors and 
the sharp drop in capital spending, productive 
capacity is expected to grow very little in 2009Œ10. 
Lengthy unemployment spells are likely to erode 

skills, while higher risk premiums will slow capital 
accumulation, dampening future trend growth. On 
the other hand, well-chosen investment in 
infrastructure and a heightened emphasis on training 
and education could provide a boost. For emerging 
economies in Europe, potential growth is also 
unlikely to return to precrisis trends, though it could 
well return to rates higher than in other emerging 
economies (other than East Asia), especially if 

structural reforms are undertaken (Box 2). 
 Inflation is projected to fall to very low levels in 
many countries, but outright deflation is likely to be 
avoided, helped by more rigid wages (Table 1). In 
the course of 2009, several advanced economies, 
primarily in the euro area, but possibly also 

Switzerland and Sweden, may experience negative 
12-month inflation rates. Nonetheless, inflation 
expectations remain anchored in positive territory in 
most countries (Figure 13). Inflation performance in 
emerging economies will show a more mixed 
picture, with deflation likely in countries with 
pegged exchange rates undergoing adjustment, and 
less downward pressure on inflation in countries 
experiencing nominal exchange rate depreciation.

 Risks around this baseline remain tilted to the 
downside. With low inflation and terms of trade
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
18Box 2. Growth Prospects in Emerging Europe After the Global Crisis 
The emerging European economies were the fastest-
growing emerging economies before the current global 
crisis, apart from emerging Asia; however, they have 
been affected the most by the crisis (first figure). This 
box discusses the implications of recent staff research on 
the region™s recovery and long-term growth prospects. 
The results suggest that emerging Europe will recover in 
the medium term, although to growth rates that will be 
lower, in some cases substantially, than before the crisis.
1These results are consistent with the latest 
World 
Economic Outlook
 projections. The results also suggest 
that structural reforms will strengthen the region™s 
growth prospects. 
Theoretical Background 
Financial liberalizations, as occurred in most emerging 
European economies before the recent boom, can lead 
to excessive risk taking associated with currency mismatches, which, in turn, can lead to high growth but at the 
price of occasional self-fulfilling crises.
2 The conceptual framework yielding this result consists of a two-sector 
economy, with traded and nontraded goods, and with two credit market imperfections: contract enforceability 
problems that generate domestic financing constraints, and systemic bailout guarantees (lenders are insured 
against systemic crises, but not against idiosyncratic defaults). This conceptual economy has a noncrisis 
equilibrium, in which the nontradable sector, which is also an input for the tradable sector, is constrained by its 
cash flow and a bottleneck to growth. However, there is also an unconstrained equilibrium, in which 
endogenous real exchange rate risk arises and firms find
 it optimal to take on credit risk in the form of a 
currency mismatch. This mismatch eases borrowing constraints, increases investment, alleviates the bottleneck 
in the nontradable sector, and allows the economy to grow faster. However, it also generates financial fragility, 
as a shift in expectations can cause a sharp real depreciation and a hard landing, particularly for the nontradable 
sector, which is growing much faster than the rest of the economy during the boom.  
The results suggest that, if crises remain rare events and are not too costly, economies in the unconstrained 
equilibrium have the potential to grow faster than other economies. The first best can be attained by reducing 
the agency problems that generate the financing constraintsŠwhich would call for structural reforms, including 
in the financial sector. However, if progress in structural reforms is slow, society is faced with a trade-off 
between faster growth and the associated credit risk. Depending on social preferences, tolerating financial 
fragility might (or might not) be a second-best solution. 
The model is highly stylized, but it would seem that most emerging European economies have been closer to 
the unconstrained equilibrium of this model. During recent years, they have experienced fast credit growth and

19convergence through primarily a rapid expansion of the nontradable sector, which was broadly financed by 
foreign currency borrowing. Structural and legal reforms have progressed, in many cases during the EU 
harmonization process, but contract enforcement remains more difficult than in most advanced European 
economies.
3 And anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that markets, for right or wrong, were operating under 
the expectation of a systemic bailout guarantee. Assuming that this characterization is indeed correct, what does 
the model imply for emerging Europe? 
Model Calibration for Emerging Europe 
Calibrating the model for emerging Europe yields the following results:
 4Economies in the unconstrained equilibrium do have the potential to grow faster than other economies, but 
only if crises do not occur often.
 5 An important implication is that to 
the extent that precrisis policies in 
some countries in the region were overexposing the economy to shocks, they were hurting long-term 
growth prospects (second figure).
Focusing on the unconstrained growth path, 
countries with good institutions, leading to better 
contract enforceability, seem to benefit more from 
taking on risk in terms of average growth rates. 
However, crises will also be more severe because of 
higher leverage. 
A high intensity of nontradable inputs in the 
production of tradables is associated with faster 
growth. 
Conclusions and Policy Implications 
These results suggest that emerging Europe could 
resume relatively fast growth rates in the aftermath of 
the current crisis, although not as fast as in the precrisis 
period. However, this assumes that crises in the region 
remain rare, which will require the absence of policies leading to excessive vulnerabilities and significant 
progress in structural reforms. 
3 For a detailed discussion and empirical evidence about emerging Europe™s recent growth performance, 
progress in reforms, and the vulnerabilities that led to the current crisis, see Vamvakidis (forthcoming). 
4 The definition of emerging Europe is consistent with the one used throughout this report. The key 
parameters of the model include the probability of a crisis, the degree of contract enforcement, the intensity of 
nontraded inputs in the production of traded goods, and the severity of financial distress costs (the fall in the 
cash flows of distressed firms during a crisis). The existence of a risky equilibrium requires that the probability 
of a crisis be low enough for risk taking to be profitable ex ante, and the severity of contract enforceability be in 
some intermediate range, so that, although borrowing constraints exist, the additional leverage associated with 
risk taking is relatively large. With risk-averse agents, 
the growth gains from risk taking would have to be large 
enough to compensate for the welfare costs of financial crises. 
5 These simulations include a business cycle random disturbance (drawn from a uniform distribution of       
+/Œ2 percent around the mean) and stochastic financial distress costs (drawn out of a uniform distribution of 
between 90 and 70 percent).

20gains, consumers could regain confidence earlier, 
especially as policy actionsŠsome of which have 
hardly had time to work, such as increased 
infrastructure spendingŠshow signs of increasing 

effectiveness. On the other hand, continued weak 
global demand could lengthen and deepen the 
recession. Indeed, past recoveries in advanced 
economies of Europe have often been preceded or 
accompanied by a revival of exports (Figure 14); 
however, this option may not be available this time. 
Dynamics within Europe are also not very 
promising, especially as a few advanced economies 
and many emerging economies face the challenge of 

exporting their way out of excessive current account 
deficits. And with bank exposure to emerging 
Europe very large, a possible adverse feedback spiral 
between advanced and emerging economies through 
the financial system could take the downturn into 
uncharted territory. Moreover, large and 
simultaneous debt issuance by advanced economies 
may entail rollover difficulties and could hamper 
emerging economies™ ability to cover their external 

financing needs. And a key concern is a deficient 
policy response. 
Calling for a Well-Articulated and 
Effectively Coordinated Policy 
Response Recessions accompanied by a severe financial 
crisis and a persistent lack of confidence require a 
comprehensive policy response consisting of a 
coherent set of  monetary, fiscal, and financial sector 
interventions. Moreover, with possibly severe 
downside risks predominating, policies need to be 
preemptive. The global nature of the crisis and 
Europe™s tight economic and financial integration 

put a premium on strong policy coordination. Such 
coordination does not imply adopting uniform 
policies, but taking commonalities and spillovers 
into account in policy design. For Europe, the crisis 
should be used as an opportunity to strengthen its 
institutions, improve its fundamentals, and make 
substantial progress toward its goals of economic 
and financial integration and regional cohesion and 
income convergence.  Building on ongoing progress, more forceful 
policy actions are required to restore market trust 
and confidence.7 In the financial sector, these 
actionsŠwhich apply to all economies of EuropeŠ

21comprise the following: continued provision of 
liquidity and engagement in credit easing where 
necessary; credible loss recognition in the financial 
system based on stress tests that take into account 
the expected deterioration in asset quality from the 
economic downturn; recapitalization of viable 
institutions, ideally by the private sector but with 
public support if needed, and orderly resolution of 
other institutions; and ring-fencing of impaired 
assets where they constitute a significant part of 

balance sheets. 
 Macroeconomic policies need to continue to 
support demand to cushion the downturn and 
forestall a downward spiral. Monetary policy can do 
this by anchoring inflation expectations solidly in 
positive territory, thus preempting deflationary risks. 

Room for interest rate reductions needs to be fully 
and swiftly utilized, especially in advanced 
economies. In addition, further unconventional 
measures, especially to help specific, distressed 
segments of the financial system, are necessary. 
However, to avert adverse market reactions and 
improve their chances of success, these measures 
will have to be used in ways that are easily reversible; 
also, clear agreements will have to be reached with 

fiscal authorities to shield the central banks from 
capital losses. Volatility of capital flows and 
pressures on exchange rates make for a more 
challenging environment for monetary authorities in 
most emerging economies, which will need to take a 
cautious approach to interest rate cuts. 
 With the downturn now expected to last longer 
and more time needed to repair the financial system 
and restore full effectiveness of monetary policy, 
fiscal policy needs to continue to support demand. 
First and foremost, this requires rapid and decisive 
implementation of the announced fiscal stimulus 
packages and maximization of their effectiveness by 
good targeting, focusing on productivity-enhancing 
infrastructure, and committing to future fiscal 

consolidation (see Chapter 2). This last requirement 
is particularly important to underpin trust in social 
safety nets, which would help mitigate an excessive 
increase in precautionary savings by households. For 
the EU aggregate, a supportive fiscal stance will 
need to be maintained into 2010, broadly in line with 
current plans. The recession may yet turn out to be 
deeper or more protracted than envisaged. Clearly, 
in this case automatic fiscal stabilizers will need to 
continue to operate, but additional fiscal stimulus, 
which may be badly needed, should only be adopted 
when accompanied by actual measures addressing 
sustainability concerns. The Netherlands set an 
example of such an approach when it accompanied 
fiscal support for the economy with pension and 

health care reforms. 
 What about the regional dimension? Europe™s 
institutions put it in a unique position to strengthen 
the policy response across countries through 
effective coordination. The benefits and needs of 
such an approach are most acute in the areas of 

financial crisis management, fiscal policy, and the 
mitigation of downside risks: 
Restoring market trust will be greatly helped if 
further financial crisis management measures 

were coordinated ex ante. For recapitalization, 
agreeing on the common basic methodologies 
for the stress tests to determine capital needs will 

avoid distortions, especially for banks that 
compete internationally. Similarly, as impaired 
assets are widely held, agreeing on the valuation 

principles in the context of ring-fencing efforts is 
necessary to ward off inefficient arbitrage and 
minimize collective costs. Dealing with cross-

border banks, especially for emerging Europe, 

requires full home-host coordination on the 
principles for loss recognition and agreed burden 
sharing in recapitalization between home and 

host countries, along the approach followed by 
the Nordic-Baltic countries and other similar 
initiatives.

through coordination (see Box 3 for the case of

the region, while room for fiscal maneuver is 
equally unevenly curbed due to financing 
constraints. Coordination in this area implies that

support for specific sectors and industries avoids

the key measures, such as infrastructure 
development, be designed in a regional context. 
Increased provision of structural funds by the 

EU to emerging economies and continued 
participation in meeting their financing needs in 
the context of adjustment programs will be 

particularly helpful. With unsettled financial markets, risk mitigation 
strategies can benefit from a regional dimension. 

Potential debt-servicing difficulties, for both 
advanced and emerging economies, are best 

addressed preemptively, involving EU 

institutions as well as the IMF. To deal with 
Box 3. A Case Study in Coordination: Deposit Guarantees 
The global financial crisis has demonstrated an important side-effect of the close economic and financial 
linkages within Europe: destabilizing spillover effects can occur when response measures are not 
coordinated. The need for better coordination can be illustrated by the financial policy reaction to the crisis. 
As the financial turmoil intensified after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, some EU member states 
unilaterally (i.e., without sufficient consultation with
 their EU partners) introduced crisis management 
measures, notably guarantees for deposits and other forms of bank debt. To prevent deposit outflows, other 
European governments then came under pressure to match the increases in deposit guarantees. Moreover, 
when state backing became more important, the resources and credit ratings of governments became a 
major factor in determining the soundness of banks. Thus, locally owned banks in smaller (or poorer) EU 
countries were put at a significant disadvantage, and, while these measures helped stabilize some banks, 
others suffered. 
The coordination of crisis management measures has improved as time passed and as the EU institutions 
sought to limit competitive distortions; however, further improvements are needed. In October 2008, 
European finance ministers agreed that it would be desirable to harmonize deposit protection to the 
•50,000Œ100,000 range, with a •50,000 minimum. However, a number of countries remain above this range 
(table). These differences create incentives for potentially destabilizing outflows. Combined with the existing 
topping-up option, it allows banks with branches in several countries to offer better deposit guarantees in 
some countries than in others (or than their competitors). Improved coordination would require establishing 
not only a minimum, but also a clearer agreement on a maximum level of deposit guarantee coverage, 
defined to include both official schemes and de facto protection of creditors. A uniform coverage level 
might in principle be even better. However, this may not be optimal if policymakers in individual countries

23have different preferences regarding the profitability and stability of the banking sector (Hardy and 
Nieto, 2008). In addition, individual countries™ deposit guarantee schemes are still very diverse with 
respect to other basic parameters, such as the type of financing and the determination of 
premiums, and no clear consensus is in sight.
disruptive exchange rate movements and shore 
up market confidence, currency swap lines 
should be extended to emerging economies. 
For new EU member states not yet part of the 

euro area, adoption of strong policies and 
confirmation by the EU that they constitute 
credible road maps to swift euro adoption 

would improve stability and help reanchor 

expectations of continued convergence. 
 Beyond the immediate policy response, 
improvements in the EU™s financial stability 
framework will be essential to prevent future 

financial crises and minimize the costs associated 
with such crises. The current framework has 
proved to be suboptimal in anticipating the 
systemic risks of the global crisis for Europe and 
in resolving cross-border institutions in an orderly 
manner. Home-host coordination with respect to 

risk taking and procyclicality of bank behavior in 
emerging economies was also lacking. As a first 
step, implementing the improvements suggested 
in the de Larosière report
10 will constitute 
important progress, though the ultimate response 
will need to go further (Box 4).

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
24Box 4. Redesigning Financial Supervision in the European Union 
The financial crisis, the challenges in coordinating crisis management actions in the European Union, and 
concerns about consequent setbacks to financial integration have intensified calls for a more integrated 
approach to financial stability in the EU. In response, at the request of the European Commission, a high-
level expert group (de Larosière Group; the DLG) delivered a review of the EU™s supervisory arrangements 
in February 2009. 
The group proposes to establish a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), bringing together the 
national supervisors with three independent supranational ﬁAuthoritiesﬂ (for banking, insurance, and 
securities markets) accountable to the EU institutions. These Authorities would oversee the work of and 
resolve disputes among national supervisors, who would retain responsibility for the conduct of supervision. 
Cross-border institutions would be supervised by colleges of home and host supervisors. To bridge the gap 
between macro- and microprudential oversight, the group proposes creating a European Systemic Risk 
Council (ESRC) linked to the European Central Bank. This council would comprise the Governors of the 
European System of Central Banks, the heads of the Authorities, and the European Commission. The group 
advocates establishment of ﬁa truly harmonized set of core rules,ﬂ harmonized and prefunded deposit 
insurance schemes, and more detailed criteria for burden sharing.  
The U.K. Financial Services Authority (the ﬁTurner reviewﬂ) has proposed a similar way forward, 
recommending the establishment of a single European regulator. This would be an independent authority to 
regulate all sectors of the financial system, oversee and set standards for supervision, and be significantly 
involved in macroprudential analysis. However, unlike the DLG Authorities, it would not have binding 
powers over national supervisors, instead relying on peer review. 
If implemented, either approach would constitute a historic step forward, putting in place important buildin
gblocks of an EU financial stability framework that is consistent with the objective of creating an integrated 
financial market. The DLG proposals would likely yield better results in terms of supervising on a day-to-day 
basis cross-border financial institutions, reconciling the interests of home and host countries, and 
strengthening macroprudential oversight. However, important aspects still need to be clarified, including 
accountability within the ESFS, the functioning of the ESRC and the organization of operational work to 
support it, and provisions for data sharing. The strong linkages among banks, insurance companies, and 
securities markets argue for an early cross-sectoral integration of supervisory arrangements along the lines of 
the Turner proposals rather than considering this only as a desirable long-term option. The Turner approach 
would also likely bring greater progress toward harmonized regulation. However, the focus on cross-border 
financial stability risks will need to be complemented with efforts to ensure that home country authorities 
accept joint responsibility with host country authorities for domestic financial stability in host countries. 
Neither set of proposals addresses the crucial question of cross-border crisis management and resolution. 
Yet fundamental progress in this area is essential to limit the incentive problems that tend to undermine 
cooperation and coordination in crisis situations (IMF, 2008a). What is needed are binding and 
institutionalized mechanisms to ensure adherence to the crisis management principles adopted by ECOFIN 
in October 2007, notably collective cost minimization and the sharing of fiscal crisis management costs. 
Recent experience has shown that policymakers find it difficult to adhere to these principles in the heat of 
the moment. This situation, in turn, makes it difficult for countries to accept the interdependencies that are 
inherent in an integrated financial market. The crisis has also shown the limitations of home country stability

ihák and Wim Fonteyne. 
1. OUTLOOK: GALVANIZING RECOVERY 
25arrangements to back the cross-border operations of their banks. Because the DLG and Turner proposals 
do not offer solutions to these unresolved cross-border crisis management and resolution issues, they open 
the door for increased host country control over cross-border branches. This would essentially scrap the 
single passport, which has been a key driver of financial integration. 
The pragmatic approach of the DLG has increased the chances of its proposals being implemented, but 
addressing these contentious issues will be necessary to ensure that Europe™s financial system delivers its full 
potential in terms of integration, efficiency, and stability. Indeed, the March 2009 European Council 
endorsed the DLG proposals as a basis for action and asked the European Commission to work out detailed 
proposals in time for the June 2009 European Council, taking into account the results of a round of public 
consultations. Separately, the European Commission is working out proposals on tools for early intervention 
and on deposit insurance, which offer prospects of some progress on crisis management and resolution. 
However, the scope of this progress is likely to fall well short of the comprehensive overhaul that is needed 
and being called for by several stakeholders to clear the road toward a single financial market. 
 Accelerating and broadening structural reforms 
have taken on heightened importance against the 
background of the economic and financial crisis. 
Structural reforms are necessary to alleviate 
pressures in at least three areas: potential growth, 
fiscal sustainability, and external imbalances. With 

the crisis dampening potential growth and raising 
unemployment, increased emphasis on training 
and education will be essential to keep people 
attached to the labor market. In this context, 
measures taken to support income in the short 
run, such as increases in the level and duration of 
social benefits, will need to be reversed when 
conditions improve to avoid adverse 
consequences on long-term labor supply. Pension 

and health care reforms 
are now more necessary 
than ever, especially as policy actions have 
generally pushed public debt to a level well 
beyond the trajectory consistent with addressing 
the intertemporal aspects of the aging problem. 
For many emerging and some advanced 
economies, the immediate challenge is to facilitate 
the reallocation of productive resources from the 

nontraded to the traded goods and services 
sectors, a process that can be assisted by reforms 
to increase labor market flexibility and 
improvements in the business environment. 
Liberalization of services sectors and, for the EU, 
the establishment of a true internal market in 
services should be a boon. Meanwhile, care must 
be taken that government interventions in the 
context of the crisis do not undermine progress, 

or worse, introduce barriers to economic and 
financial integration in Europe. 
272. Fiscal Policy in Advanced Countries: 
Effectiveness, Coordination, and Solvency 
Issues On the heels of the global financial crisis, active fiscal 
policy is back on the agenda of the advanced European 
economies. Indeed, a fiscal expansion could be particularly 
effective in the near-term economic environment: the recent 
tightening of credit constraints could make spending more 

sensitive to current income and, thus, taxes and subsidies. 
Given the increased integration of European economies, policy 
coordination is nonetheless key to magnifying the effects of 
national fiscal expansions. While it is important for countries 
to support their economies in the face of this unprecedented 
slowdown, a clear and credible commitment to long-run fiscal 
discipline is now more essential than ever: any loss of market 
confidence may raise long-term real interest rates and debt-
service costs, partly offsetting the stimulus effects of measures 

taken to deal with the crisis and further adding to financing 
pressures. Hence, it is particularly crucial that any short-term 
fiscal action be cast within a credible medium-term fiscal 
framework and envisage a fiscal correction as the crisis 
abates.
Note:
Overview 
 Policy actions taken to address the global crisis 

have been increasingly broad in scope as financial 
problems have spread and activity has deteriorated. 
Overall, policies have aimed at restoring confidence 

in global financial markets and institutions, 
supporting aggregate demand, and, ultimately, 
breaking the corrosive feedback loop between the 
financial and real sectors of the global economy. In 
particular, fiscal policy is providing important 
support through direct stimulus, automatic 
stabilizers, and the use of public balance sheets to 
shore up the financial system. 
_______ 
Note:
 The main authors of this chapter are Silvia Sgherri and 
Edda Zoli. 
 While such support is crit
ical to bolster aggregate 
demand and to limit the impact of the financial crisis 
on the real economy, it implies a significant 
deterioration in the fiscal positions of advanced 
European economies.
11 In fact, public deficits and 
debt are projected to rise dramatically in the coming 
year, exacerbating existing long-run fiscal challenges 
and raising questions about sustainability. Financial 
markets seem to have responded to these 
developments by requiring higher sovereign default 
risk premiums for most countries, and 
differentiating across sovereign issuers much more 
than before. 
 Against this background, it is important to assess 
the fiscal implications of the crisis so far, including 
for the sustainability of public finance, and to 
explore how governments can maximize the 
effectiveness of fiscal support while minimizing the 
impact of this support on their solvency. This entails 
gauging the fiscal costs of the measures taken to 

address the financial crisis and sustain aggregate 
demand, and assessing the impact of automatic 
stabilizers on government balances. Other questions 
of relevance include the fiscal policy mix that is 
likely to enhance effectiveness, the benefits of policy 
coordination, and the impact of the crisis on fiscal 
sustainability. It is also important to review the role 
of budgetary frameworks, and the Stability and 
Growth Pact in particular, as an essential device of 

commitment to long-term fiscal sustainability.
_______ 
11 It has to be stressed, though, thatŠgiven the severity of the 
crisis and the potential risks of an economic meltdownŠpublic 
finances would worsen significantly even in the absence of 

government intervention. 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
28Fiscal Costs of the Crisis 
Financial Sector Support 
 Government support to the financial sector has 
taken various forms, with different implications for 
debt and fiscal balances. Almost all advanced 
European economies have provided capital 
injections and guarantees for financial sector 

liabilities. Some have purchased illiquid assets from 
financial institutions or extended direct loans 
(Table 4).
12 Altogether, the immediate impact of 
these measures to support government financing has 

reached 6.3 percent of 2008 GDP on average, 
ranging widely from 1.1 percent of GDP in 
Switzerland to 20.2 percent of GDP in the United 
Kingdom. Part of the up-front costs, though, is expected to 
be recovered. In previous episodes of banking crises 
around the world, recovery rates varied considerably 
_______ 
12 In several countries, central banks have extended assistance to 
financial institutions through credit lines, purchase of assets, 
asset swap, and liquidity provisions without direct treasury 

funding. While such operations do not require up-front treasury 
funding, they could eventually generate fiscal costs. 
(Laeven and Valencia, 2008). In the Nordic 
countries in the early 1990sŠthe most recent 
episodes of banking crises in advanced European 
economiesŠrecovery rates ranged from around 
15 percent in Finland to more than 90 percent in 
Sweden. Empirical analysis based on a large sample 
of financial crises indicates
 that recovery rates are 
positively correlated with per capita income and the 
fiscal balance at the beginning of the crisisŠ
probably an indicator of sounder public financial 
management (IMF, 2009b and 2009c). Country-
specific projected recovery rates based on this 
analysis suggest that the medium-term impact on 
public debt could be substantially smaller than the 
up-front cost in most cases.  
 Explicit guarantees provided so far are quite 
large, especially in Ireland (Table 4, column D). 
Nevertheless, the ultimate costs are likely to be 
lower. Indicative estimates based on financial 
derivative pricing models suggest that outlays from 
contingent liabilities could be on average around 1Œ
3 percent of GDP, cumulative for 2009Œ13 for the 
advanced European economies (IMF, 2009b and

292009c).13 However, governments may need to 
extend additional support to the financial sector if 
the crisis persists. De facto, governments are also 
providing implicit guarantees to financial institutions 
that could potentially entail significant additional 
fiscal costs.
14Downturns, Asset Price Reversals, and 
Stimulus Plans 
 Fiscal deficits will increase, owing to the 
operation of the automatic stabilizers during the 
economic downturn. In most countries, the 
estimated effect of automatic stabilizers is expected 
to increase significantly in 2009 (Figure 15). 
 On top of that, there might be a further negative 
impact on revenues because of the ongoing reversal 

in house and equity prices, which is not fully 
reflected in the conventional estimates of cyclical 
balances. Fluctuations in asset prices affect the 
taxation of capital, financial transactions and capital 
gains, and corporate and personal income tax 
proceedsŠas well as indirect tax revenuesŠthrough 
their impact on wealth and consumption. Even 
though asset values and business cycles are 
correlated, dramatic declines in asset prices may 

reduce revenues even more than currently 
anticipated. Indeed, during previous episodes of 
house and equity price busts in advanced European 
economies, even cyclically adjusted revenues fell in 
the aftermath of asset price reversals and, in the case 
of house price reversals, they bottomed out with a 
long lag (Figure 16). 
 Most countries have also adopted fiscal stimulus 
plans, amounting to, on average, 1 and 0.8 percent 
of GDP in 2009 and 2010, respectively (Table 5). 
_______ 
13 These estimates are obtained by applying the expected default 
frequency implied credit default swap spreadsŠwhich are 
indicators of the ﬁinsuranceﬂ premium for providing the 
guaranteeŠto the guaranteed amounts. For details, see IMF 
(2009b and 2009c). 
14 Some estimates, based on the assumption that governments 
will provide implicit guarantees to all systemic institutions, 
suggest that the potential fiscal costs could be on average 

around 3Œ10 percent of GDP, cumulative for 2009Œ13 for the 
advanced European economies (IMF, 2009b and 2009c). 
Most of the announced measures are temporary, but 
some are permanent, implying a lasting effect on 
deficits and a cumulative impact on public debt 
(IMF, 2009b and 2009c).
15 Overall, fiscal accounts 
will be severely affected by the crisis, with potential 

implications for fiscal sustainability (see section on 
fiscal solvency). 
Making the Most Out of Fiscal 
Interventions  
Targeting the Response in Times of 
Financial Distress 
 The current crisis has acquired the hallmarks of a 
full-fledged recession driven by a strong contraction 
in aggregate demand. The fall in aggregate demand 
is due to a large decrease in financial wealth, an 

increase in precautionary saving on the part of 
households, increasing difficulties in obtaining 
credit, and a wait-and-see attitude on the part of 
consumers and firms in the face of uncertainty. A 
further fall in demand will increase the risk of setting

measures that entail permanent reductions in personal income 
tax or in indirect taxation (IMF, 2009c, Table 13).

 These factorsŠtogether with the unavailability of 
any export-led recovery strategy due to the global 
nature of the recessionŠcall for an expansionary 
fiscal response and, at the same time, shape its 
design. In practice, the cris

of fiscal measures, including the speed of their 
transmission through the economy.
16 The ongoing financial turmoil is part of an adjustment toward 
more sustainable macroeconomic conditions around 
the globe, and the behavior of economic agents may 
change as a result of this process and the policy 
actions it entails. As a result, fiscal policies that 
contribute to lowering existing uncertainties, bolster 
confidence, and promote the expectation of 
sustainable public finances over the medium and 
long term will be most effective in fighting the 
current downturn.

2. FISCAL POLICY IN ADVANCED COUNTRIES: EFFECTIVENESS, COORDINATION, AND SOLVENCY ISSUES 
31impact of the discretionary fiscal stimulus on 
activityŠis even more difficult than normal. 
Generally, researchers have used a variety of 
econometric techniques and model specifications to 
get reliable estimates of fiscal multipliers, reaching a 
wide range of outcomes. This broad range of results 
mostly reflects country conditions, the persistence of 
the stimulus, and policy mixŠincluding the type of 
instruments used, the response of monetary policy, 
constraints on borrowing, trade openness, and long-

term sustainability.
17 With regard to the type of instruments featured in 
the policy mix, both the fiscal multipliers used by 
IMF country teams (Table 6) and model-based 
empirical research on multipliers for the various 
components of countries™ fiscal packages (revenue 

measures, infrastructure spending, and other 
spending) seem to suggest that infrastructure 
spending is likely to have the largest impact on 
growth, although it also has the longest 
implementation lags.
18 In contrast, tax cuts are likely 
to have a more modest growth impactŠparticularly 

if they are not targeted to credit-constrained 
consumersŠas they rely entirely on propensities to 
spend out of wealth or income, and have no direct 

effect on the demand for goods and services. 
 In general, econometric analysis tends to back 
skepticism regarding the effectiveness of 
discretionary fiscal actions by documenting a trend 
of small and declining consumption multipliers since 
the 1980s, as greater financial deregulation, larger 

wealth accumulation, and better policies that might 
have helped lower uncertainty about future income, 
relax credit constraints on households and firms, 
and lengthen private sectors planning horizons.
19Because of the enhanced opportunities to smooth 

consumption vis-à-vis temporary fluctuations in 
income and diversify income risks, household

17 For recent studies on fiscal policy effectiveness as a 
countercyclical tool, see Blanchard and Perotti (2002), 
Christiansen (2008), IMF (2008b), and Freedman and others 
(forthcoming). 
18 For an analysis of the stimulating impact of different fiscal 
instruments, see Freedman and others (2009). 
19 On this point, see, for example, Perotti (2002). 
demand is likely to have becomeŠover timeŠless 
and less dependent on current income, thereby 

shaking the foundations of fiscal multipliers.
20 In the current slowdown, however, it seems that 
this argument can be run in reverse. As the financial 
turmoil is spreading across borders and across asset 
classes, the share of credit-constrained households is 
likely to rise and the planning horizon of credit-

unconstrained consumers to shorten. Similarly, the 
correction of housing prices is bound to lower the 
value of the collateral that households in many 
European economies can count on to borrow. For 
all these reasons, spending patterns would become 
much more dependent on current income, thus 
boosting the effectiveness of any tax cut and/or 
transfer increase. Thus, while in normal 
circumstances a discretionary fiscal stimulus might 

have limited impact, in the current economic 
conditions the case for fiscal action seems to have 
become stronger, giving reasons to believe that the 
multipliers would be closer to the upper bound of 
the range of estimates provided above. 
 The same argument also speaks in favor of 
targeted fiscal measures. Specifically, as the problem 
of financial distress is not uniform across groups in 
the economy, the effect of income support may 
differ vastly across groups of households, depending 
on their initial debt level and their equity losses in 
the crisis. Fiscal support should be targeted 
consistently to specific groups of households and 
firms that are most vulnerable to the economic

20 In a recent empirical study, Bayoumi and Sgherri (2009) 
explore the relationship between changes over time in policy 
effectiveness and time variation in both households™ planning 
horizons and the degree of persistence of policy shocks.

32downturn. Concentrating income support may 
maximize its insurance value for the population, 
while guaranteeing a relative strong stimulus to the 
economyŠthereby creating more output for a given 
deterioration of the budget. 
 The anticipated depth and length of the 
downturn should also shape the fiscal reaction. With 

a significant risk of a prolonged downturn, the 
stimulus should be designed to support demand 
over a long period and rely, more than in the past, 
on spending measures that directly boost final 
demand. One advantage of direct spendingŠfor 
instance, on government investmentŠover tax cuts 
or increase in transfers, which operate by raising the 
purchasing power of households and firms, is that 
the impact of direct spending will be less mitigated 

by a possible increase in the saving rate of the 
private sector. 
 The potential effectiveness gain of carrying out 
fiscal stimuli in circumstances where uncertainty is 
higher and financial markets are disruptedŠhence 
causing households and firms to be more ﬁmyopicﬂ 

and risk averseŠcan be illustrated via simulations of 
the IMF™s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal 
(GIMF) Model.
21 The version of the model used 
here features two (asymmetric) economic areas 

within a monetary unionŠa large euro area 
advanced economy (which has been calibrated using 
German data) and the rest of the euro area. The 
model has a number of features that make it 
especially suitable for assessing the effectiveness of 

fiscal measures: as a new-Keynesian, intertemporal 
model based on household- and firm-optimizing 
behavior, GIMF allows for non-Ricardian responses 
to fiscal actions by allowing for overlapping 
generations with finite economic lifetimes, life cycle 
incomes, and liquidity-constrained households. In 
the model, taxes on labor income have distortionary 
effects and changes in these taxes cause agents in 
the model to adjust their behavior. GIMF also 

features a number of nominal
 and real rigidities that 
capture well the characteristics of labor and product

discussion of GIMF™s structure and properties. 
markets in Europe, and allow for monetary policy to 
have real effects in the short to medium run.
22 Under selected scenarios, simulation outcomes 
focus on the effects on GDP, private consumption, 
public debt, and the real interest rate of a temporary 
fiscal stimulus. The fiscal measures considered here 
involve taking expansive actions equal to 1.0 percent 

of GDP in the first year and 0.5 percent of GDP in 
the second year, either by cutting labor income taxes 
or by increasing public investment. In addition, 
lump-sum transfers are used to offset the resulting 
endogenous changes in the budget deficit, so that 
the working of automatic stabilizers is suppressed.
23There is no monetary accommodation, so the 

Taylor-type rule in the GIMF model continues to 
operate in both years of the fiscal expansion. 
 It is important to stress that the purpose here is 
to present a ﬁlikely rangeﬂ regarding the 
effectiveness of a given fiscal stimulus under 
differentŠand necessarily stylizedŠscenarios. In 
other words, by focusing on a temporary tax cut, 
each simulation attempts to give an idea of the 

ﬁsmallest possibleﬂ multiplier, as tax cuts that are 
perceived to be temporary have only a limited effect 
on the behavior of households that are not liquidity 
constrained. In contrast, at the other end of the 
spectrum, the same targeted stimulus engineered 
through government investment expenditures would 
provide ﬁthe upper boundﬂ of the multiplier effect, 
given the existence of dir
ect effects on aggregate 
demand and secondary effects on household 
spending, as incomes and wealth would also increase 
due to the higher productivity of the economy. 
 With respect to the large euro area country, 
Table 7 shows the cumulative fiscal multipliersŠ 
_______ 
22 At the same time, though, the fact that GIMF is a rational 
expectations dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model rules 
outŠa prioriŠany meltdown scenario over the medium term: 
expectations are, indeed, well anchored, and policy actions are 
assumed to be fully credible and anticipated by (rational) 
economic agents. 
23 In the period following the tem
porary fiscal action, lump-sum 
transfers adjust to return government debt back to its baseline 

value over time. They are assumed to do so very gradually to 
minimize the effects of fiscal consolidation on postcrisis GDP. 
2. FISCAL POLICY IN ADVANCED COUNTRIES: EFFECTIVENESS, COORDINATION, AND SOLVENCY ISSUES 
33defined as the cumulative impact on real GDP and 
consumption over the two years divided by the 
cumulative deficit over the same periodŠfor a 
simultaneous euro area stimulus. Two cases are 
distinguished: (1) ﬁnormalﬂ circumstances, defined 

by a planning horizon for forward-looking 
households of 20 years, a share of credit-constrained 
households of 25 percent, and a risk aversion 
coefficient equal to 4; and (2) distressed financial 
markets, characterized by a shorter planning horizon 
for the optimizing consumers (10 years), a larger 
share of liquidity-constrained consumers 
(50 percent),24 and greater uncertainty, thereby 
raising the degree of risk aversion coefficient to 6. 
 The cumulative multipliers on GDP and 
consumption appear to be larger in times of 
financial distressŠdespite the increase in risk 
aversionŠand accompanied by lower fiscal costs 
and slower debt accumulation over the short term. 
This is particularly true for the tax stimulus 

becauseŠwith distressed financial marketsŠall 
agents in this model become more myopic with 
respect to future tax liabilities. Even the least

24 Following the seminal work of Campbell and Mankiw (1989), 
several papers have estimated of the share of liquidity-
constrained consumers. Available estimates for euro area 

countries over the 1960Œearly 1980s period range around 
50 percent (Jappelli and Pagano, 1989). 
constrained group of households is assumed to 
halve its planning horizon and its remaining working 
life. This means that such households perceive the 
temporary tax cut as an increase in wealth, which, in 
turn, leads them to spend more. This effect is even 
stronger for the group of liquidity-constrained 
agents, who are assumed to consume their after-tax 
income in every period, without any possibility for 
borrowing or saving. Changes in taxes directly affect 
the disposable income and, therefore, spending of 

these agents. Doubling the size of this groupŠ
which is assumed to be the same in the two 
economic regionsŠis therefore critical to increase 
the multipliers of tax stimulus measures. 
Coordinating the Response in 
Integrated Economies 
 Another reason for fiscal skepticism is the belief 
thatŠin highly integrated economiesŠan increasing 
share of a given fiscal stimulus benefits employment 
and output abroad, rather than in the country 
sustaining the cost of the fiscal expansion. In the 
traditional jargon, the problem consists of the 
ﬁleakagesﬂ that reduce the additional output one can 
stimulate with a given amount of government 
spending or tax cuts, as a large share of domestic 
consumption and investment falls on imported 
goods or on imported inputs.
25 However, even in the presence of trade and 

financial linkages, fiscal policy may still be powerful 
at the aggregate level, if all governments expand at 
the same time. More specifically, a fiscal expansion 
in a large country affects net exports in trading 
partners through different channels. Part of the 

public spending rise in the expanding country falls 
directly on imports. Also, the fiscal stimulus boosts 
domestic demand in the expanding country, leading 
to more imports. Finally, the prices of the expanding 
country™s products rise faster than those of its 
trading partners, inducing consumers in those 
countries to substitute imports for locally produced

boost in net exports and GDP, although in the 
expanding country part of the stimulus ﬁleaksﬂ 
abroad. But, if a fiscal stimulus is also adopted 
simultaneously by the trading partners, all countries 
mutually benefit from each other™s expansion. 
Hence, the broader the multicountry participation in 
the fiscal expansion, the larger the multiplier of a 
given stimulus. 
 The gains of a coordinated fiscal expansion can 
also be evaluated by simulation of the IMF™s GIMF 
model. Table 8 summarizes the effects of a 
temporary fiscal expansion through either lower 
taxes or higher investment in GDP and private 
consumption in the large euro area economy under 
two scenarios: (1) the fiscal expansion is undertaken 

by the large euro area country alone; and (2) the 
fiscal expansion is undertaken jointly by all euro area 
countries. 
 Coordination gains in the stylized large economy 
appear to be nonnegligible, amounting to 0.1Œ
0.4 percentage point of the cumulated effects of the 
simultaneous fiscal stimulus on outputŠdepending 
on the composition of the fiscal package. This is due 
simply to existence of very large trade effects within 
the euro area, which have been reproduced in the 
calibration of the two-region model. The lesson here 
is that the potential for intra-EU externalities in 
fiscal policy, makes policy coordination more 
essential than ever.
26Treasuring Fiscal Solvency 
The Crisis Is Putting Fiscal Solvency at 
Risk . . .  
 The benefits of fiscal expansions do not come for 
free. Current gains should be assessed against the 
future costs of a larger stock of public liabilities. 
Indeed, in most countries, government debt is 
expected to rise sharply as a share of GDP over the 
next year, reflecting support for the financial sector,

fiscal stimulus packages, and revenue losses caused 

by the economic downturn and declining asset 
prices (Figure 17). The debt-to-GDP ratio is 
expected to increase, on average, by 9.4 percentage 
pointsŠthe largest jump since the early 1980s. This 
deterioration exacerbates existing long-run fiscal 
challenges related to population aging, thereby 
raising concerns about fiscal solvency. 
 As debt dynamics depend on the initial debt 
stock, the real growth rate of the economy, the real 
interest rate, and the size of future primary balances, 
the current crisis creates risks to fiscal sustainability 
in different ways. Growth rates will be negative in 
2009, while the time and extent of the recovery 
remain highly uncertain. Even beyond the short 
term, potential growth is expected to be lower than 

in the precrisis period. While average nominal yields

35(weighted by maturity) have fallen in most countries, 
sovereign spreads have risen sharply in some of 
them (see next section), signaling that governments™ 
marginal funding costs may increase. At the same 
time, inflation is expected to ease significantly in the 
near term, thus boosting real interest rates. Primary 
balances are projected to remain weak in the 
immediate future and, in many cases, are expected to 
achieve levels insufficient to ensure debt 
stabilization (IMF, 2009b). Another reason for 

concern is that rollover risks are likely to increase in 
the short run, given both the limited availability of 
credit and the dramatic and simultaneous increase in 
debt issuance across the world (Box 5). 
. . . Markets Are Concerned
27 . . .In the last few years, credit spreads have been 
extremely narrow. Countries with vastly different 
ratios of debt and deficits to their GDP have been 
able to borrow at essentially
 the same interest rate. 
But it seems increasingly unlikely that countries 

undertaking substantial fiscal expansion in the 
current circumstances will be granted the same 
treatment going forward. To be sure, in recent 

months financial markets have been requiring higher 
default risk premiums across a variety of bond 
instruments and across most issuers. Sovereign 
spreads and credit default swap premiums have 
widened since September 2008 and are now very 
large by historical standards. 
 In the euro area, in particular, spread variance 
across common currency members has risen 
dramatically, suggesting that markets are 
differentiating more and more among government 
issuers. From a range of 0Œ25 basis points in 2007, 
10-year spreads versus the German bund by the end 
of January 2009 had reached close to 300 basis 
points in the case of Greece and over 100 basis 
points for Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain 

(Figure 18).28 Increasing sovereign spreads could 
have a major impact on governments™ marginal

funding costs in the euro area, possibly undoing the 

benefits of declining ri
sk-free interest rates. 
 Behind these developments are, among other 
things, growing concerns about the fiscal solvency 
of some euro area member states in the face of the 
expected increase in public debt associated with the 
fiscal costs of the financial crisis. The medium-term 

net budgetary cost of financial support operations 
will also depend on the extent to which the assets 
acquired by government or the central bank will 
hold their value, on future losses from explicit 
guarantees, and on additional costs from implicit 
guarantees to the banking sector. The high 
correlation between the expected default frequency 
(EDF) of financial institutions and market concerns 
about the fiscal implications of the government 

support, as indicated by wider sovereign spreads, 
points in this direction (Figure 18). 
 Considerations about the relative liquidity of 
different government bond markets may be yet 
another factor. The financial turmoil could lead to a 
flight to safety and liquidity, resulting in a decline in 

the yields of the most liquid sovereign bond 
markets. But global discrimination among different classes 
of default risk may have also contributed to the 
widening of the sovereign risk premium 
differentials. Assuming that risk premiums 

embedded in country-specific sovereign yields are 
determined jointly in the market and influenced by 
the riskiness of the specific asset as well as common 
risk factorsŠsuch as the willingness and the ability 
of investors to bear that riskŠa common 
component in sovereign spreads has been estimated 
(Figure 19).29 This common component seems able 
to capture the general downward trend in sovereign 

spreads due to the Economic and Monetary Union 
_______ 
29 The common risk factorŠwhich is not directly observableŠis 
assumed to be represented by a dynamic stochastic process. It is also 
assumed that sovereign spreads are simultaneously determined 
within a multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional 
heteroscedasticity framework, capturing fat-tail noise. The 

model is estimated using a nonlinear Bayesian estimation 
technique based on the model™s likelihood function.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
38Box 5. Sovereign Financing Needs of Adva
nced Economies and the Rollover Risk 
In 2009, advanced economies around the world are planning to issue a large amount of new public debt to 
finance fiscal deficits and financial sector support. This issuance, together with the need to refinance a large 
amount of maturing debt, raises concerns about rollover risk.
1The currently growing rollover risk looks different from the past, even though that experience is limited in 
advanced economies. The largest increases in public debt occurred during the First and Second World Wars, 
when extensive government control over the economy and moral suasion facilitated sovereign borrowing 
(IMF, 2009b). During the 1970s and 1980s, many advanced economies accumulated sizable government 
debt, but problems with placing debt were few. The only notable exceptions were Italy and the United 
Kingdom in the 1980s. Both countries responded to the difficulties by adjusting their debt-management 
strategy to attract a wider class of investors. However, today™s circumstances differ in several respects: a 
number of countries are planning to issue large amounts of sovereign debt simultaneously, thus 
compounding rollover risk; new debt is projected to be issued within a relatively short period of time; and a 
large accumulation of contingent liabilities related to guarantees of financial sector obligations could require 
additional debt financing. 
What are the global funding needs? 
The gross financing needŠcalculated as the sum of fiscal deficits plus financial sector support measures, 
maturing medium- and long-term debt, and the inherite
d stock of short-term debtŠis particularly sizable 
in the United States and Japan. In Europe, Ireland and Belgium are the countries with the largest 
financing needs (in percent of GDP), followed by the Netherlands, Italy, and Portugal. Among 
European countries, the average annual debt rolloverŠdefined as the stock of outstanding debt (as 
percent of GDP) divided by its average maturityŠis highest in Belgium, Italy, Greece, and Portugal 
(figure). In total, gross fiscal funding needs of the 20 advanced countries in 2009 (including new 
borrowing and refinancing) could reach almost $10 trillion, representing about 23 percent of the 
aggregate GDPŠan increase of over 50 percent relative to 2008, and even more compared with 
previous years. 
Emerging economies™ new sovereign borrowing needs in 2009 are likely to be much less, given the 
limited intervention support of governments in their financial sector, less aggressive use of fiscal stimuli 
and weaker automatic stabilizers.
2 However, they will still add to the global supply of new debt. 
Moreover, their refinancing needs will be large. 
Corporate borrowing needs also will be large. By some estimates, corporate bond issuance (mainly high 
grade) reached a record $373 billion in January 2009, an
d there could be an additional $450 billion in

1 Rollover risk is defined as ﬁthe risk that debt will have to be rolled over at an unusually high cost or, in 
extreme cases, cannot be rolled over at all.ﬂ  See IMF and World Bank (2001). 
2IMF (2009b) estimates for the G-20 emerging economies a fiscal deficit of 3.2 percent of  GDP, and very 
low up-front financial sector intervention financing. 
2. FISCAL POLICY IN ADVANCED COUNTRIES: EFFECTIVENESS, COORDINATION, AND SOLVENCY ISSUES 
39corporate debt issuance during the year, as companies are forced to look for alternative funding while 
banks cut back lending. In addition, in a number of countries, government-guaranteed bonds will be 
issued by private corporations or banks.
3 These bonds typically offer somewhat higher yields than the 
corresponding sovereign bonds, but they are also highly rated, and, therefore, enter into direct 
competition with other sovereign bonds. 
While the demand for funds is escalating quickly, it is unclear whether the supply of funds will grow 
correspondingly. On the one hand, the private sector™s increasing savings could provide additional funds to 
sovereign borrowers. On the other hand, slower reserve accumulation in China and oil-exporting countries 
could reduce the amount invested in sovereign bonds. Also, elevated risk aversion could curtail appetite for 
less creditworthy sovereign bonds.  
What could govern
ments do to limit rollover risks and 
ensure that sovereign bonds will be absorbed without 
pushing up financing costs? First, governments could 
adjust borrowing strategies to adapt to market needs 
and better match investors™ preferences, even if this 
would imply a temporary departure from their long-
standing debt-management strategy. They could also 
take measures to improve the functioning of the 
treasury debt market, for example, by increasing the 
number of primary dealers or allowing direct access of 
final investors to auctions, and seek to diversify the 
investor base. Third, and very important, 
governments need to assure markets that measures 
taken to mitigate the current downturn are consistent 
with medium- to long-term fiscal sustainability 
(IMF, 2009b). 
3According to Fitch Ratings (2009), European governments have guaranteed about •1.5 trillion new issues 
of banks over the next three years. 
spread between end-January 2009 and end-
September 2008 indicates that concerns about fiscal 
sustainability are significant for countries such as 
Greece and Ireland andŠto a lesser extentŠ

Austria, Italy, and Portuga
l. For Ireland, the main 
contributing factor to the widening in sovereign 

spreads is the deterioration in the solvency of the 
country™s financial sector, mirroring market 
concerns about the potential fiscal implications of 
financial sector fragility. The extent to which rising 
EDFs in the financial sector translate into increases 
in government spreads is found to be large and 
significant also in Austria. Finally, ceteris paribus, 
the liquidity of the sovereign bond market appears 
to lessen the Italian government™s financing costs. 
. . . Curbing the Effectiveness of Fiscal 
Stimulus While it is important for countries to support their 
economies in the face of the current unprecedented 
slowdown, it is key that the entailed short-term fiscal 
costs not be seen by markets as undermining long-
run fiscal sustainability. In fact, the empirical link 
between country spreads and sustainability concerns 
suggests that the impact of higher current 
expenditure is strengthened when complemented

40with a credible plan that ensures it is financed at 
least in part by future spen
ding cuts. This is because 
future spending cuts tend to raise current private 

consumption and investment via their effects on the 
long-term interest rate. 
 Simulations with the GIMF model illustrate this 

point: in countries where fiscal sustainability is 
perceived to be in jeopardy, expansionary fiscal 
measures lead to an increase in risk premiums and 
long-term real interest ra
tes, which would tend to 
offset part of the fiscal stimulus effects on spending. 

To highlight the impact of government borrowing 
levels on domestic interest rates, the GIMF model 

has been modified to make the domestic risk 
premium dependent on the government debt-to-
GDP ratio in an asymmetric way, hence allowing for 
a steeply increasing risk premium at large debt-to-
GDP ratios.30 Table 10 provides quantitative ranges to highlight 

the effects of the temporary fiscal stimulus described 
above on GDP, private consumption, public debt, 
_______ 
30 The empirical literature finds that larger government deficits 
tend to increase long-term interest rates. Typical estimates show 
that a persistent increase in debt equal to 1 percent of GDP 

increases long-term real interest rates by between 1 and 6 basis 
points. The effect of a persistent increase in deficits of the same 
magnitude is associated with a 10- to 60-basis point increase in 

long-term real interest rates (Engen and Hubbard, 2004; Gale 
and Orszag, 2004; and Ardagna, Caselli, and Lane, 2004).

41and the real interest rate in an euro area economy in 
two cases: (1) the fiscal expansion is undertaken by a 
member state featuring a low government debt-to-
GDP ratio (60 percent); and (2) the fiscal expansion 
is undertaken by an euro area member state 
featuring a high government debt-to-GDP ratio 
(120 percent).  Consistent with the findings in the previous 
section, the simulation results show that the fiscal 
stimulus is more effective in countries with low 
debtŠand hence with more fiscal roomŠthan it is 
in high-debt countries. Although the fiscal 
expansion is assumed to be temporary, the low-debt 
economy is still found to enjoy real interest rates 
that are approximately 20 basis points below the 
high-debt economy. This finding could have 

implications in the context of international policy 
coordination. It seems to suggest that the 
effectiveness of a joint fiscal expansion would be 
maximized if countries where fiscal sustainability is 
less at riskŠand hence that are enjoying more fiscal 
space and lower risk premiumsŠwere able to help 
finance the fiscal packages announced by countries 
with less fiscal room. 
Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability: 
Policy Options 
 For the fiscal response to the current crisis to be 
the best possible, it will have to be coordinated 
regionally, focus on the most effective measures, 
and take into account the sustainability of public 

finances. This requires both a credible medium-term 
strategy and the fiscal framework to support it. 
Credible Medium-Term Strategy
31 To improve the trade-off between the needed 
fiscal expansion and the risk of a loss of market 
confidence, governments should supplement their 
support packages with a clear and credible strategy 
to ensure fiscal solvency and improve confidence. 
Such a strategy should comprise the following: 
_______ 
31 Prepared with the help of Manal Fouad and Edouard Martin 
drawing on IMF (2009b). 
A clear plan for fiscal consolidation in the aftermath of 
the crisis, including fiscal stimulus packages that 
rely as much as possible on temporary or self-
reversing measures; announcement at an early 

stage of how the deficit will be reduced in the 
medium term; and a firm commitment and a 
clear strategy to contain the trend increase in 

aging-related spending. 
Growth-enhancing structural reforms. 
As growth is a 
key factor in restoring debt sustainability, 
directing expenditures toward productive areasŠ
such as government investment in 

transportation, infrastructure, and educationŠ
would be beneficial. This also holds for tax 
reforms that reduce distortions. 
Transparency.
 The cost of government 
interventions to safeguard the financial sector 

and cushion the downturn should be recorded 

transparently to avoid adding to current 
uncertainties. Where reliable market information 
is not available to estimate asset prices, 

contingent liabilities, and other information 
pertaining to fiscal cost
s, alternative scenarios 
should be considered. In general, countries 
should improve their capacity to identify, 
disclose, and manage fiscal risks.

Strengthening Fiscal Frameworks: 
Role of the Stability and Growth Pact
32 Given the demands on fiscal policy, fiscal 
frameworks can make an important contribution to 
implementing such a medium-term strategy, in 
particular by adding to its credibility. In advanced 
European economies, a wide range of fiscal rules is 
in force at both the national and subnational levels. 
Their role could be usefully strengthened to foster 

fiscal discipline once growth has resumed.
33Arguably, though, the most binding and visible fiscal 

constraint in the European Union (EU) is the 
Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). So, a crucial 
question is, what role can the SGP play in anchoring 
expectations of sustainability while allowing an 
adequate crisis response? 
 Although the SGP was not set up to facilitate an 
EU-wide fiscal stimulus in response to a large 
recession, a closer look at it suggests that the fiscal 
framework™s provisions are likely to be flexible 
enough to accommodate the currently envisaged 
fiscal responses to the crisis (Box 6). At the same 
time, the SGP™s excessive deficit procedure (EDP) is 
likely to provide a useful anchor for fiscal 
adjustment, at least in the short run, by mandating 
reductions in the structural deficit once the recovery 

has set in. 
 Looking beyond the short term, however, there is 
room to strengthen the SGP™s role in ensuring the 
longer-term health of public finances. Under the 
current framework, countries are required to steer 
fiscal policy in line with medium-term objectives 

(MTOs) (the so-called preventive arm).
34_______ 
32 This section was prepared by Xavier Debrun, Jean-Jacques 
Hallaert, and Helge Berger. 
33 For an analysis and empirical evidence on national fiscal rules 
in EU members, see Debrun and others (2008). 
34 MTOs are country specific and reflect the requirement to 
(1) keep a sufficient safety margin
 with respect to the 3 percent 
limit (depending on the size of automatic stabilizers); (2) ensure 
stable debt dynamics around prudent levels (or rapidly declining 
(continued) 
Nevertheless, the SGP so far has failed to provide 
sufficiently strong reasons for EU members to 
adhere to their targets. Observance of MTOs is 
subject only to regular budgetary surveillance by the 
European Commission (EC), which is lacking the 
political ﬁteethﬂ the EDP provides, and analyses of 
the SGP have consistently emphasized this as a 
major flaw in the anchoring role of the framework.
35As a result, many countries have fallen short of their 

MTOs even in good economic times.
36 There are various options to enhance the 

anchoring role of the preventive arm: 
Encourage reforms putting national institutions and rules 
in tune with the SGP. In particular, MTOs could be 
better integrated into
 medium-term fiscal 
frameworks at the national level, providing the 
SGP with a suitable institutional interface in each 
country. The EC has emphasized such 
governance reforms in its surveillance exercises, 

but pressure on member states remains minimal. 
Strengthen the preventive arm.
 One possibility would 
be linking the EDP and the MTOs, for instance 
by abrogating the EDP only after the MTO has 
been reached. Alternatively, MTOs could be 

treated as the reference value under the EDP for 
those countries deemed to have unsatisfactory 
debt dynamics. Both options would require an 

amendment to the EU Treaty, however. 
Enhance the commitment value of MTOs.
 The process 
leading to the definition of MTOs is rather 
opaque, reducing their public visibility and, 
correspondingly, their signaling value and 
political relevance. Establishing a simpler link 

between MTOs and public debt could help put 
them at the core of EU budgetary surveillance 
and, more generally, public scrutiny.

debt toward these levels); and (3) also take into account public 
investment needs.

(2007).36 See European Commission (2006, 2007, and 2008). 
2. FISCAL POLICY IN ADVANCED COUNTRIES: EFFECTIVENESS, COORDINATION, AND SOLVENCY ISSUES 
43Box 6. Is the Stability and Growth Pact an Obstacle to Adequate Fiscal Stabilization? 
In principle, the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) allows for considerable leeway in using fiscal policy for 
macroeconomic stabilization: 
Escape clause (definition of excessive deficit)
. A deficit above the reference value of 3 percent of GDP may not 
be considered ﬁexcessiveﬂ if (1) the deficit is exceptional (i.e., due to unusual events outside the control 
of the member state); (2) temporary; and (3) close to the reference value. Negative GDP growth qualifies 
as an exceptional event. 
Excessive deficit and enforcement procedure (EDP)
. If the deficit of year 
t has been deemed excessive, the initial 
deadline for correction (normally 
2t) can be extended by one year (to 
3t) in case of ﬁspecial 
circumstances,ﬂ including negative GDP growth, and ﬁall other relevant factors.ﬂ Moreover, the EDP 
can be put in abeyance, effectively leading to one-year extensions of the initial deadline. There are two 
conditions for abeyance: (1) the member state complied with the previous Council™s recommendations 
or notices; and (2) ﬁunexpected adverse economic eventsﬂ with major budgetary effects occurred after 
the recommendation or notice was issued. Again, ﬁall other relevant factorsﬂ can be taken into account 
by the European Commission (EC) and the Council in extending the deadline for correcting the 
excessive deficit. 
However, once a country operates under the EDP, there are limits to this flexibility, as an improvement in 
the structural balance is required. As a rule, any country under the EDP will face recommendations (or 
noticesŠwhich are more specific and legally binding) requiring an improvement in the country™s structural 
balance (cyclically adjusted and net of one-offs) by at least 0.5 percent of GDP. In practice, this rule applies 
from 
2t onward (the first year after the excessive deficit has been identified), and it precludes the 
possibility of 
discretionary
 fiscal stimuli in countries that are under the EDP in the preceding year (automatic 
stabilizers would still be allowed). In practice, it is reasonable to expect that a continuation of financial sector 
stress and anemic or negative growth into 2010 would lead to the extension of deadlines under the EDP. In 
this case, a country experiencing an excessive deficit in 2009 would not be expected to correct it before 2013 
at the earliest; however structural adjustment would be expected to begin in 2011 at the latest. 
The EC has clearly indicated that the EDP should not be an obstacle to an adequate fiscal response to the 
downturn. In December 2008, the EC proposed the European Economic Recovery Plan, subsequently 
endorsed by the European Council, calling for a discretionary stimulus of about 1.5 percent of European 
Union GDP. In presenting the plan, the EC stated that ﬁfor Member States considered to be in excessive 
deficit, corrective action will have to be taken in time frames consistent with the recovery of the economy.ﬂ
1Note: The main authors of this box are Xavier Debrun and Jean-Jacques Hallaert. 
1In a similar vein, in considering th
e continued breach of the 3 percen
t target by the United Kingdom 
already operating under an EDP, the EC invited the British authorities to ﬁproceed in financial year 2009/10 
with the stimulus measures consistent with the European Recovery Plan while avoiding any further 
deterioration of public finances.ﬂ 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
44Conclusions and Policy 
Implications 
 In the face of a crisis of historic proportions, 
countries need to continue to support financial 
systems and the economy. Failure to do so would 
result in a prolonged recession, additional financial 

losses, and a further worsening of fiscal accounts. 
With limited scope for further stimulus through 
monetary policy, fiscal policy remains the main 
option available for policymakers to preempt such 
a downward spiral. It is crucial, though, for 
governments to try to maximize the effectiveness 
of fiscal support, while limiting the impact of such 
support on sustainability. 
 In this respect, the analysis presented in the 
chapter suggests the following: 
With regard to the policy instruments mix, 
spending on infrastructure is likely to exhibit a 

larger growth impact than tax cuts and 
transfers increases, despite having the longest 
implementation lags. 
That said, under the present tight credit 
conditions and low collateral values, tax cuts 
and transfer increases can be more effective 
than in the precrisis period in fueling aggregate  
demand, as the share of credit-constrained 
agentsŠwhose consumption pattern is highly 
sensitive to current disposable incomeŠis 
rising. By the same argument, targeting fiscal support 
to specific groups of consumers and firms that 
are mostly credit constrained would enhance 
the effectiveness of the stimulus.  
Given the importance of intraregional trade in 
Europe, coordination of expansionary 
measures would greatly amplify the size of 
fiscal multipliers. 
If fiscal sustainability is perceived to be in 

jeopardy, market interest rate increases could 
partly offset the expansionary effects of 
stimulus packages. Therefore, support 

measures should be accompanied by a clear 
and credible strategy to ensure fiscal 
sustainability, including a plan to withdraw the 

stimulus as the crisis abates. 
Fiscal frameworks, including national and 
subnational fiscal rule as well as the SGP, can 
and should be strengthened to anchor 
expectations of fiscal sustainability and foster 
the implementation of medium-term strategies. 
453. European Emerging Economies in the Crisis: 
Impact and Recovery  
A short period of apparent resilience to the global financial 
turmoil has given way to a deep crisis in several European 
emerging markets, though with substantial differentiation 
across the region. The crisis has put an increased premium on 
sound macroeconomic and macroprudential policies: countries 
with lower inflation, smaller current account deficits, and 
lower dependence on bank-related
 capital inflows in recent 
years have so far fared better. While the external environment 

and structural reform efforts will matter, the banking sector, 
which has played a central role in the run-up to the crisis, 
holds a key to the speed of recovery from the crisis. In the short 
term, bank recapitalizations seem unavoidable to prevent 
recessions from becoming protracted. In the medium term, 
recovery efforts need to be supported by a strengthening of 
financial stability arrangements, including for cross-border 
activities, and the introduction of more forward-looking 
provisioning policies.
Note:
 What determines the impact of the global 

financial crisis on European emerging economies? 
An analysis of cross-country differences of 
sovereign bond spreads during the crisis suggests 
that the soundness of precrisis macroeconomic 
policies, as reflected particularly in inflation and 
current account deficits, is very important in 

explaining the severity of the impact. This is true for 
both the emerging European economies that remain 
outside the European Union (EU) as well as those 
that became EU members; for the latter group, 
adherence to EU rules and institutions has helped to 
mitigate the impact of the crisis but has not shielded 
them completely.  What could determine the speed of recovery 
from the crisis? Aside from external factors and 
reform effects, it is likely that the banking sector, 
which played a central role in the run-up to the 
crisis, will be critical to determining the speed of

recovery as well. Indeed, evidence of procyclicality 
in banks™ operations suggests a negative impact on 
banks™ capitalization from the crisis, and likely a 
credit crunch. There is
 evidence that even 
householdsŠwhich have traditionally been relatively 

debt freeŠhave become dependent on credit for 
their consumption. This suggests that cuts in lending 
could slow the recovery from the financial crisis. 
Hence, policies that, in the short term, help support 
bank capitalization are likely to be beneficial. These policies need to be calibrated with a view to the 
longer term, namely, to allow sustainable 
development and financial deepening in the 
European emerging markets. 
Who Got Hurt More? Stylized 
Facts Developments in emerging European economies 
in the run-up to and during the global crisis had 
several common characteristics. In most of these 
economies, large declines in stock prices and 
increases in sovereign bond spreads during the crisis 
were associated with large external and internal 
imbalances and bank-related capital inflows prior to 

the crisis (Table 11).
37 Many of the emerging 
markets had large current account deficits, financed 

largely by borrowing of subsidiaries of foreign banks 
from their parents. The banks used the relatively 
cheap foreign funding to extend credit to

37 Emerging European economies are defined to include 
(1) countries that joined the EU in 2004 or thereafter and had 
not joined the euro area by end-2008 (Bulgaria, the Czech 
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, 
and the Slovak Republic), and (2) the non-EU countries of 
Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, FYR 
Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and 
Ukraine. In the subsequent econometric analyses, some 

countries were dropped due to lack of data.

46households and nonfinancial firms. This resulted in 
rapid growth of  domestic credit, denominated 
mostly in foreign currency in almost all the 

countries. Credit went largely into financing 
nontradables and imports of consumer durables, 
spilling into current account deficits, and, in most 
cases, into inflation. Despite these remarkable 
common characteristics, cross-country variation 
among the emerging European economies remained 
substantial, in particular in the response of stock 
prices and bond spreads in the countries that receive 
IMF support (Table 11). 
 Three stylized facts emerge from this analysis: 
Differentiation in sovereign spreads.
 Non-EU emerging European economies have been among 
the worst hit. The new EU member states 
(emerging economies that joined the EU in 2004 

and thereafter; NMS), which had smaller spreads 
to begin with, have suffered the least (Figure 21).

47area, and in a few cases spreads have remained 
wider than in the most affected euro area 
countries. With the exception of Hungary, the 

reason has not been primarily fiscal: the spreads 
have in most cases widened despite relatively 
healthy fiscal balances and low government 

debt.38 The widenings have rather reflected 
market participants™ concerns about the 

governments™ contingent liabilities in case of 

major banking and other corporate defaults. 
Strong role for bank-related capital inflows.
 The ratio 
of bank-related capital inflows to GDP in 
emerging European economies has been a 
multiple of the ratios for emerging non-
European economies (Table 11).
39 In general, 
emerging European economies have strong 
banking linkages to advanced economiesŠfor 
_______ 
38 In fact, the average ratio of government debt to GDP in 
countries that had to resort to official financial assistance has 
been less than half of the euro area average. 
39 Bank-related capital inflows are defined as the balance of 
payments item ﬁother investment, liabilities,ﬂ aggregating the 

subitems ﬁloansﬂ and ﬁcurrency and deposits.ﬂ These two items 
capture loans comprising inflows from parent banks into 
emerging market subsidiaries and cross-border loans to banks 
and corporates, excluding portfolio and foreign direct 
investment inflows. The breakdown of this category into bank 

and nonbank flows is not available consistently across countries, 
but available data and anecdotal evidence suggest that the bank-
related portion is large, reflecting the central roles of the 

banking sector and the high degree of foreign ownership in 
most emerging European banking systems. 
instance, emerging Europe™s stock of bank 
liabilities to advanced countries exceeded 
50 percent of its GDP, about three times the 
ratio for other emerging markets (IMF, 2009a). 

But even within emerging Europe, the size of 

these cross-border banking flows has varied. At 
about 13 percent of GDP in the run-up to the 
crisis, bank-related capital inflows were especially 

strong in the countries that eventually received 
multilateral financial support. 
Macroeconomic vulnerabilities.
 Indicators of 
overheating, such as large current account 
deficits, fast credit growth, and accelerating 

inflation, were flashing red in these countries 
subsequently most affected by the crisis. The 
massive capital inflows helped to finance high 

current account deficits, averaging about 
11 ½ percent of GDP in emerging European 
economies in 2008. Moreover, countries with 

higher bank credit growth
 to the private sector 
seem to have been worse hit (Figure 22). The 
same holds true for emerging markets with 
inflexible exchange rate regimes (Table 11).

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
48The EU Halo Effect Seems to Have 
Disappeared . . .  
 Empirical analyses of spreads on NMS sovereign 
bonds during the early 2000s often found that, while 
a fundamental (economic) analysis pointed to rising 
vulnerabilities in some of the NMS economies, 
markets remained optimistic because of the EU halo 

effect, compressing sovereign bond yields to below 
levels seen in other emerging economies (Hauner, 

Jonas, and Kumar, 2007; and Luengnaruemitchai 
and Schadler, 2007).41 However, this effect seems to 
have disappeared during the global financial crisis. 

Using data through early 2009, 
ihák and Fonteyne (2009) find that, after controlling for global liquidity 
conditions and fundamentals, the NMS sovereign 
spreads, which had been low and stable by emerging 
markets standards up to 2006, returned to 
ﬁfundamentalﬂ levels (and even slightly above) in 
2007Œ08 (Figure 23). At the same time, countries 
implementing more prudent macroeconomic 
policies (in particular, those that keep inflation low) 
still tend to have smaller spreads and face weaker 
market pressuresŠa conclusion that is consistent 

with earlier findings by Debrun and Joshi (2008). 
. . . and the Convergence Criteria Have 
Been Less Important Than Domestic 
Policies and External Vulnerabilities

_______ 
41 Different authors have interpreted the halo effect differently. 
Hauner, Jonas, and Kumar (2007) posit that it is linked to EU 
membership, in particular the effect of better institutions and 

processes, such as fiscal rules, that have been put in place since 
EU accession. This would suggest that the halo effect may be 
lasting. Luengnaruemitchai and Schadler (2007) point out that 

the halo effect is essentially an unexplained residual that may 
turn out to be temporary.

3. EUROPEAN EMERGING ECONOMIES IN THE CRISIS: IMPACT AND RECOVERY 
49for euro adoption. The individual states have 
differed substantially on their ability to meet the 
convergence criteria. Slovenia and the Slovak 
Republic have already entered the euro area. The 
other EU emerging economies have been able to 
satisfy some of the criteria, but have had difficulties 
meeting all of them at the same time. 
 Against this background, can a country™s 
performance relative to the convergence criteria 
explain movements in bond spreads during the 
crisis? The answer is a qualified ﬁyes,ﬂ based on an 
analysis of cross-country differences in bond spreads 
in European countries during three recent episodes 
of increased financial market stress: (1) the minicrisis 
period from January 2006 to September 2006 
(marked by a negative ratings report on Iceland, and 

revelations about worse-than-expected fiscal 
outcomes in Hungary); (2) the first phase of the 
financial crisis, from August 2007 to August 2008 
(before the fall of Lehman Brothers); and (3) the 
most recent phase, from September 2008 to 
November 2008 (Table 12).
42 The spreads are influenced by global factors to a 

large extent (the episode fixed effects are strong) but 
beyond these, country-specific differentiation took 
place. The main findings of the empirical analyses 
suggest the following: 
First, the immediate impact of the crisis was clearly 
differentiated among country groups.
 The NMS were hit 
significantly harder than the euro area.
43 And the widening of bond spreads in emerging non-EU 
European countries was on average almost double 
the increase of that in the NMS.  
_______ 
42 The econometric analysis involves robust ordinary least 
squares (OLS) estimates on pooled data of 43 European 
countries, covering three main subgroups: euro area members, 
NMS, and other emerging Europe. Episode fixed effects were 
used to control for common factors that affected all countries. 
Country-specific variables were used to explain cross-country 
differences in performance. 
43 Each convergence criterion (see footnote 40) is assigned one 
point. If the country meets a criterion, it gets 0; otherwise, 1. 
Therefore, the variable used in the regression takes values from 

0 (for a country fulfilling all criteria) to 5 (for a country meeting 
none of the criteria). 
Second, inflation performance matters.
 Countries that 
had greater compliance with the convergence criteria 
saw smaller increases in bond spreads. A more 
detailed analysis suggests that this overall result was 
driven by inflation performance, which seems to 
matter more in explaining cross-country differences 
in the crisis impact on spreads, as well as in 
explaining the evolution of bond spreads, than the 
other items on the convergence criteria checklist. 
Third, financial markets rea
cted adversely to external 
vulnerability indicators, over and above their reaction to the 
convergence criteria. 
High current account deficit.
 Even when controlling 
for the fulfillment of th
e convergence criteria, 
the spreads increased with current account 
deficits. This effect is significantly stronger in the 

NMS and other emerging European economies 
than in advanced economies in Europe. This 
puts renewed emphasis on the importance of 

known vulnerabilities. 
Bank-related capital inflows.
 Reflecting some of the 
stylized facts discussed above, countries with 
larger bank-related capital inflows in percent of 
GDP were hit harder. In this respect, the impact 

on NMS did not substantially differ from that of 
other emerging European economies, possibly 
due to the similarity of structure of ownership of 

the banking systems in almost all countries in 

emerging Europe. One interpretation would be 
that financial markets reacted adversely to bank 
subsidiaries™ borrowing overseas from parent 

banks in an environment where the parent banks 
were experiencing increasing liquidity tightness 
themselves. A ﬁsudden stopﬂ in loans from 

foreign parent banks to subsidiaries, or cross-

border loans to corporates, would have far-
reaching adverse effects on credit and GDP 
growth, apart from pressures that it would put 

on the exchange rate or reserves. Large-scale

movements. 
Credit growth. 
By itself, credit growth was a source 
of concern for financial markets, but not 
independently of that of the capital inflow from 

parent banks. Indeed, such inflows appear to 
dominate the effect of credit growth on bond 
spreads. In other words, the funding of credit 

growth and the adverse implications that a drop 
in such funding would have on GDP growthŠ

given the dependence of economic activity on 
rapid credit growth so farŠseems to be a source 
of concern for foreign investors in emerging

Focus of each regression:
3. EUROPEAN EMERGING ECONOMIES IN THE CRISIS: IMPACT AND RECOVERY 
51 The fact that crisis resilience varied so widely 
across emerging markets has its deeper roots in 
differing policies and vulnerabilities. For instance, 
among NMS economies, Hungary with its large 
fiscal deficit, high inflation, and external debt was an 
early victim of the crisis; the Slovak Republic, which 
adopted the euro in January 2009 after satisfying all 
the convergence criteria, has mostly been riding a 
wave of investor optimism on its spreads and stock 
prices; the Czech Republic, with small fiscal and 

current account deficits, moderate bank-related 
capital inflows, and lower foreign currency bank 
lending, has fared better than
 its neighbors so far. 
Across these countries worries about contingent 

government liabilities from the financial turmoil 
(e.g., in the event parent bank financing dries up and 
nonperforming loans escalate in the banking system) 
have been at least as important as the actual policy 
performance on the fiscal deficit and government 

debt. Another factor affecting country performance 
was the quality of domestic policies in the face of 
the massive private sector capital inflows prior to 
the crisis. Loans from parent banks to eastern 
European subsidiaries and direct cross-border loans 

from foreign banks to corporates created large debt-
rollover needs in the private sector (IMF, 2009a). 
These flows have largely financed activities in the 
nontradable sectors and contributed to overheating 
of the economies: the larger the capital inflows, the 
stronger the demand boom, the greater the 
overheating of the domestic economy, and the larger 
the widening of the current account deficit. While 
this surge in private capital flows was an 

overwhelming force for all, some emerging 
European economies were more able than others to 
limit this overheating pressure; this explains why 
inflation and current account deficits are good 
predictors of the current problems. 
 There are also some indications that countries 
operating under flexible ex
change rate arrangements 
have so far seen, on average, a smaller fallout from 

the crisis in terms of bond spreads. The flexibility of 
the exchange rate provided a welcome policy tool to 
control inflation in the run-up to the crisis, while 
most hard-peg countries have ultimately been unable 
to prevent overheating despite generally prudent 
fiscal policiesŠBulgaria, for instance, managed to 
create a substantial fiscal reserve account. This 
experience reinforces the policy lesson that, 
especially (but not only) under fixed exchange rates, 
strong financial regulation and, in particular, 
macroprudential policies are needed to deal with 
surging capital inflows and the risk they entail. 
Examples of such policies are regulations that make 

banks hold more capital for short-term cross-border 
funds, including those from parent banks, and for 
risky loans, including those in foreign currency, that 
banks extend using such funds. 
 Not surprisingly, the policies and vulnerabilities 
underlying the country differences in resilience also 

seem likely to matter for the duration of the crisis. 
Econometric analysis of emerging economies 
(Box 7) shows that larger external debt and current 
account deficit at the outset of a crisis tend to 
extends its duration. As a consequence, European 
economies as a group are, on average, likely to face a 
longer crisis than the rest of the world. But again, 
the substantial cross-country variation within 
emerging Europe are likely to influence the 

likelihood of an early escape from current troubles. 
Banking Sector Holds a Key to 
the Recovery from the Crisis 
 The banking sector in most of the emerging 
European economies played a central role in the 

run-up to the financial crisis, and it holds a key to 
the speed of recovery from the crisis. In recent 
years, high growth in bank credit, increasingly 
funded by foreign parent banks, enabled the rapid 
growth of incomes in emerging Europe, thereby 
helping the convergence process. At the same time, 
the speed of convergence may have been 
unsustainable, with imprudent banks engaged in 
reckless lending. Risks have, therefore, accumulated 

in the banking sector. However, the rapid 
reassessment of these risksŠby both domestic and 
cross-border lendersŠthreatens to do more than 
correct excessive precrisis growth: it could lead to a 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
52Box 7. Crisis Duration Across Emerging Markets 
The current period of financial distress in emerging economies is likely to be prolonged, given the protracted 
nature of the global credit freeze. Even though there are differences across regions and countries, the 
current crisis could result in a large deterioration in external emerging market conditions, owing to greater 
risk aversion and smaller expected capital flows to emerging markets. Therefore, emerging market countries, 
especially those with weaker underlying economic fundamentals and policy frameworks, are likely to face 
pressures that could extend beyond the average of past crises. 
External Debt and Deficits Are Key 
Looking at the empirical link between crisis duration 
and its possible determinants,
1 emerging European 
economies are likely to experience, on average, longer 
periods of financial distress than other regions (first 
figure).2 While Asian and Latin American countries 
could exit the distress period in about one year, the 
average probability of exiting at the end of the second 
year in eastern Europe is only about 30 percent. 
The large variation among regions™ probability of 
exiting from the distressed state is mostly driven by 
stark differences in initial conditions. Countries with 
higher levels of initial external debt are likely to endure 
more extended periods of financial stress because the 
probability of exiting the crisis state remains low for 
longer (second figure). Similarly, there is a negative 
relationship between the length of the crisis period and 
the initial current account balance of countries. In sum, while many emerging markets are confronting the 
turmoil from a relative position of strength, given their stronger initial conditions, European countriesŠon 
averageŠare less likely to fare well. That said, there is substantial variability in the probability of exiting 
from the distressed state among the European countries in general, and the crisis countries in particular. 
Moreover, global financial conditions play an important role as well and could help to shorten crisis duration 
for all countries. An important caveat to these results is that the underlying model only indirectly takes into 
account financial sector and banking sector conditions. 
Note: The main authors of this box are Ruben Atoyan, Eugenio Cerutti, and Uma Ramakrishnan. 
1 More specifically, the probability of exiting a crisis is modeled as a function of time-varying and country-
specific variables, including a country™s initial extern
al position (the level of external debt and current 
account balance in 2008); global emerging market financing conditions (net private capital flows to emerging 
markets, world interest rate, and trade-weighted partner country demand); domestic policies (changes in 
primary balance, real interest rate di
fferential, and the exchange rate regime, which are all to be fixed at their 
2008 levels); and IMF financing (if any). See Mecagni and others (2007). 
2 The duration analysis is probabilistic rather than deterministic and only illustrates how long the crisis 
duration might be; it is not meant to be an accurate predictor of the actual duration. Furthermore, the 
analysis is an out-of-sample prediction, which may or may not be well suited to predict the duration of the 
current spells of market pressures.

3. EUROPEAN EMERGING ECONOMIES IN THE CRISIS: IMPACT AND RECOVERY 
53Policy Implications 
Lessons from past crises suggest that a strong policy response during a crisis has a positive effect in 
shortening the crisis duration, but strong market pressures during crises severely limit actual policy options. 
As the probability of exiting from distress is highly sensitive to external conditions, crisis resolution efforts 
should focus on restoring investor confidence and improving global liquidity conditions, which, in turn, 
depend on a quick resolution of the crisis in advanced economies. 
reversal of desirable financial deepening and 
economic convergence. If banks hit by the crisis 
respond drastically by cutting lending, this could 
have a major knock-on effect on the economy, in 
particular on consumption and investment, 
considerably slowing the recovery from the crisis. A 

drag on consumption and a general credit crunch 
would make the recovery in investment sluggish as 
well, hurting long-term growth. 
Banks™ Past Imprudence Can Hurt 
Their Capital, Leading to a Credit 
Crunch . . . Many banks in emerging Europe, although still 
appearing to be well capitalized and profitable, did 
not build sufficient reserves for future loan losses 
during the good times. These banks were generally 
in compliance with basic microprudential 
regulations, but they should have gone well above 

the required minimums to maintain sufficient capital 
during the financial crisis. This is true for many 
banks globally, but it is especially valid for those in 
emerging European markets 
that experienced credit booms, building up credit risks. Most of the 
emerging markets were dominated by subsidiaries of 
foreign (mostly western European) banks, meaning 
that many key decisions (such as those on reserves 
and capital) were largely taken outside emerging 

Europe. Host country supervisors have been 
reluctant to impose tougher prudential rules on 
provisioning and higher capital buffers, referring to 
possible inconsistencies with Basel II preparations, 
retaliation by parent banks, and the perceived high 
quality of home country supervision of these 
institutions. As a consequence, when borrowers fail 
to pay their dues, banks need to write off or reduce 
profits by the amount of such loans because existing 

reserves are not adequate. This situation makes bank 
earnings very volatile (and potentially negative), 
adding to bank risk. 
 Empirical evidence on eastern European banks 
shows that, as a rule, bank provisions (i.e., charges 
to profits that build loan loss reserves) have not 

been countercyclical, with important consequences

54for the time profile of bank profits. Pointing in this 
direction is the negative correlation between 
provisions and, respectively, real GDP, asset returns, 
and real credit growth (Table 13). More specifically, 

a panel data analysis on banks in emerging Europe 
for 2000Œ07 suggests the following (Table 14):
44Banks have not been smoothing their earnings.
 Instead, 
lower provisions have been associated with larger 

profits: a 1 percentage point increase in return on 
assets is associated with a 0.06 percentage point 
decrease in provisions to assets on average. In 

other words, banks have profited partly by 
_______ 
44 The estimates use an augmented version of the methodology 
by Laeven and Majnoni (2003). A limitation of the estimates is 
the shortness of the time series 
as well as the fact that eastern 
European banks have not yet been through many business 

cycles. The estimates therefore need to be treated only as 

illustrative. 
provisioning less. This suggests that banks will be 
subject to higher profit volatility when borrowers 
actually default on their payments during the 
crisis. 
Provisioning is procyclical.
 This means that banks 
have not been saving for bad times. They are 
therefore likely to have to provision when 
economic downturn actually sets in: a 
1 percentage point decline in real GDP growth is 

associated with a 0.07 percentage point increase 

in provisioning. In addition, there is a 
0.01 percentage point increase in provisioning 
for every percentage point increase in the 
unemployment rate, indicating a need for 
additional provisioning later in a typical business 
cycle.Riskier banks are provisioning more than other banks.
Using the z-index as a measure of bank stability, 
results show that banks provision more when 
stability goes down (lower z). This behavior 
exacerbates the problems of the banking sector 

by reducing capitalization when the risk goes up, 
rather than building enough capital in 
anticipation of the higher risk.
45 All the above three results hold when the sample 
is restricted to NMS. 
 Based on the estimates, bank provisions are likely 
to multiply manifold with the ongoing deepening of 
the economic downturn. Since profits might not be 
able to cushion such increases in provisions and 

loan losses, capital buffers would have to be tapped, 
thereby reducing banks™ capitalization.
46_______ 
45 See De Nicolò (2000); and Maechler, Mitra, and Worrell 
(forthcoming) for a discussion of the z-index and its various 
forms. Here, z = (return on assets + equity/assets)/mean 
deviation of return on assets within a bank. Higher z should in 
general indicate greater stability or lower risk of insolvency. 
46 To give an example based on the empirical model, a decrease 
in Latvia™s growth rate from 10.0 percent in 2007 to Œ4.6 
percent in 2008Ša decline of about 15 percentage pointsŠ
would mean an increase in provisions by 1.05 percentage 

pointsŠfor a total of 1.26 (=0.21+1.05) percent of 2007 assets. 
For most countries, such an increase is beyond two standard 
errors of average provisions. The quantitative impact modeled 

in the regression is linear, and hence probably on the lower side. 
During a crisis, the effects could be nonlinear mainly for two

55 Such losses are likely to decrease capitalization to 
a point where banks cut back on lending. To some 
extent, cuts in bank lending are exactly what some 
of the emerging European economies need, after a 
period of unsustainable growth and overheating. 
However, a sudden and widespread unavailability of 
loans could have a dramatic impact on the real 
economy, and in particular on private consumption. 
This second-round effect could prolong the 
recession considerably. In emerging Europe, where 

foreign banks dominate the banking system, a sharp 
cutback in cross-border funds and failure of private 
owners of parent banks to respond to the 
recapitalization needs of the emerging European 
subsidiaries could have a serious impact on the 
broader economy. Given that there is already some 
evidence of banks™ reluctance to lend (as Senior 
Loan Officer™s Lending Surveys in some countries 
indicate for the first quarter of 2009), 

recapitalizations done preemptively (before the 
actual shortfall is noticed) would help build 
confidence in the banking systems. 
. . . and the Tightening Credit Could 
Have Severe Effects on the Many 
Households Whose Spending Is 

Constrained by Credit Availability 
 A major credit tightening could have a large 
impact on the real economy in emerging Europe. In 
particular, the sensitivity of consumption to bank 
credit would suggest large declines in consumption 
if a credit crunch were to
 take place. Indeed, the 
April 2009 World Economic Outlook
 shows that the 
key reason that recessions associated with financial 
crises are much worse than other recessions is the 
decline in private consumption.

output and employment would cause further distress on bank 

balance sheets, and, second, widespread balance sheet 
mismatches in foreign currency of the private sector could be 
exacerbated through large-scale exchange rate depreciations 
generating further credit risk for banks. These second-round 
effects have not been modeled here due to lack of data. 
47 In a bivariate vector autoregression of consumption growth 
and income growth in the United States, Blanchard (1993) 

shows that shocks to consumption could be long-lasting and 
could delay recovery from crises.  
depressed consumer sentiment could play a role in 
delaying recoveries from the current crises, absent 
appropriate policy responses. 
 Recent analytical work (e.g., IMF, 2008d) stresses 
that borrowing constraints faced by households in 
the mortgage market play an important part in the 
transmission of monetary policy shocks and asset 

price fluctuations over the cycle. Specifically, private 
consumption tends to be more sensitive to financial 
shocks in countries where housing credit markets 
are more developed. Even where mortgage credit 
markets are not well developed, private 
consumption growth can be adversely affected if a 
large portion of households are dependent on credit. 
With the financial crisis, credit could dry up either 
due to a funding crunch, as unsettled markets make 

it prohibitively expensive for banks to raise funds 
from abroad, or due to a drying up of capital inflows 
from parents in advanced European countries to 
their emerging European subsidiaries. Also, with the 
onset of a crisis and a severe recession, any 
difficulties experienced by customers in repaying 
their lenders could threaten solvency in banks, 
leading to a credit crunch. 
 There are indications that
, in emerging Europe, a 
credit decline is associated with a consumption 
decline. Taking retail sales (available at a monthly 
frequency) as a proxy for consumption (available 
only at a quarterly frequency), household credit 
growth is positively correlated with retail sales 
growth in a number of emerging European 

countries, even though the strength of the 
correlation differs across countries (Table 15).
48 A more in-depth analysis confirms the 
importance of credit constraints. Specifically, 
instrumental variable regressions of retail sales 
growth on current income growth, household credit 

growth, and consumers™ expectations about job  
_______ 
48 The correlation between consumption and retail sales growth 
is, on average, higher than 50 pe
rcent (and significant) for the 
emerging European economies. 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
56prospects (Table 16) for selected countries in 
emerging Europe show the following:
49Growth in household credit helps to explain growth in 
retail sales in almost all countries.
 A 1 percentage point increase in annual real credit growth raises 
_______ 
49 The methodology follows Bacchetta and Gerlach (1997) and 
Bayoumi and Melander (2008), who estimate the effect of 
predictable changes in credit on consumption growth. It 
augments these regressions with measures of consumer 

sentiment about unemployment expectations following Carroll 
and Dunn (1997). To address the shortness of the time series 
for emerging European markets, monthly series on retail sales 
(continued) 
annual retail sales growth by an average of 
0.14 percentage point. The sensitivity of retail 
sales growth to credit growth is especially strong 
in Bulgaria, which has experienced rapid credit 

growth in recent years, but almost zero in the 

Czech Republic, where aggregate credit 
developments have been more subdued. This 
suggests that a severe credit crunch would have a 

much larger negative impact on consumption 
growth in Bulgaria than in the Czech Republic. 
The above finding holds even after controlling for 

fluctuations in current real wages, a proxy for real 
disposable income.
50 This suggests that consumers 
who depend upon current income are coexisting 
with liquidity-constrained consumers who 
depend upon credit for current consumption. 
In addition, unemployment prospects shape consumption.
In most countries, unemployment expectations 
contain additional predictive power for retail 
sales growth, beyond the information contained 
in wage growth and credit growth. This implies 

that some households reduce consumption 
growth when unemployment prospects loom 
larger in the future. Following a financial crisis, 

private consumption growth is likely to be weak 

until households are comfortable that they are 
more financially secure (IMF, 2009d).
51____________________________________________ 
and real wages are used, with the latter approximating 
movements in income. 
50 Because there could be reverse causality from retail sales to 
current income growth, instrumental variables were used to 
substitute for current real wages. Instruments included real wage 
growth and retail sales growth lagged by one through three, six, 
and nine months. Granger causality tests show that credit 
growth, on average, does a much worse job at predicting future 

wage growth than past wage growth or retail sales growth. This 
finding supports the interpretation that the significance of credit 
growth in the regression reflects its ability to explain retails sales 

growth beyond its role in explaining current income growth. 
51 Carroll and Dunn (1997) show that, for the United States, 
when uncertainty about future labor income increases, 

consumers postpone purchases of durable goods until their 

balance sheet condition improves. Another result suggests that 
durables consumption was more sensitive to this uncertainty 
measure after financial liberalization. The sensitivity could have 

increased over time for emerging markets too as their financial 
systems were gradually liberalized over the last decade.

3. EUROPEAN EMERGING ECONOMIES IN THE CRISIS: IMPACT AND RECOVERY 
57Policy Implications 
 The crisis has clearly put an increased premium 
on sound macroeconomic and macroprudential 
policies in individual emerging market countries, as 
financial market participants are paying less attention 
to group effects. This is illustrated by the 
disappearance of the EU halo effect (i.e., the return 
of the NMS bond spreads back to what can be 
explained by fundamentals). It is also illustrated by 
the increased country dispersion of sovereign 
spreads during the crisis, which can to a large part 

be explained by differences in the macroeconomic 
performance and external vulnerabilities of the 
countries, in particular by their success (or lack 
thereof) in keeping inflation low and the financing 
of the current account deficit at a sustainable level in 
the run-up to the crisis. 
 What policies should be implemented to get the 
emerging European countries out of the crisis? 
Given the important cross-country differences, the 
policies will necessarily differ across countries. 
Because of the high financing costs, fiscal stimuli 
cannot be implemented in most of the emerging 
European markets. Rather, further fiscal adjustment 
is required in these countries to restore confidence 
in policies. Financial market measures to revive 

credit and restructure household debt can shorten 
the recessionary span by relieving the borrowing 
constraints of households. 
 Given the central role of the banking sectors in 
emerging European economies, and reduced 
confidence in most of the banking sectors, bank 

recapitalization will be an important element in the 
policy packages in many countries in the short term. 
Even though most banks appear to be well 
capitalized and profitable for the time being, they 
remain vulnerable to loan losses as the economic 
downturn deepens. Capital injections into banks 
seem necessary to prevent recessions from 
becoming protracted in some of the emerging 
economies. Based on this line of reasoning, recent 

IMF-supported programs in crisis countries have 
indeed included substantial funds for meeting the 
recapitalization needs of banks. Such 
recapitalizations could be done preemptively, rather 

than in response to actual insolvencies, to rebuild 
confidence in the banking systems. Stress tests that 
assume a worse-than-expected downturn in the next 
two years could be used to determine potential 
capital shortfalls, in coordination with parent bank 
owners and supervisory authorities. 
 Bank recapitalization would be wasteful if not 
accompanied by a strengthening of the supervisory, 
regulatory, and macroprudential framework. There is 
substantial scope for more effective supervision in 
individual countries under the existing financial 
supervisory frameworks. This includes for instance 
the possibility of imposing stricter capital 
requirements for weaker banks under Basel II 
Pillar 2.52 But given the strong cross-border linkages 
within Europe and given the major role of foreign-
owned banks in emerging Europe, the stricter capital 
requirements need to be accompanied by much 
stronger cross-border cooperation between home-
host central banks, supervisors, and ministries of 
finance. In addition to the microprudential 
improvements, more is also needed to address the 
macroprudential challenges. This should involve 
forward-looking (countercyclical) provisioning 

(IMF, 2008d), to reduce the macroprudential 
volatility in bank profits. Without such reforms, 
provisions are likely to continue to be procyclical, 
meaning that sharp economic downturns can 
adversely affect borrowers™ ability to repay loans and 
drain capitalization of banks, ultimately leading to an 
unwanted credit crunch and lower consumption and 
investment. 
 Addressing the current crisis requires credible 
policies to restore confidence, including confidence 
about future job prospects. In conjunction with 
short-term countercyclical policies, structural 
reforms should be intensified to prevent declines in 
_______ 
52 Under Basel II Pillar 2, bank supervisors need to evaluate 
banks™ internal capital adequacy calculations and compliance, 
and could require higher capitalization for individual banks if 
their risk profiles are higher. Supervisors need to determine this 
risk by conducting stress tests. 
But countries need to have the 
supervisory capacity to make the necessary assessments and the 
adequate legal framework to take action.

58long-run productivity and growth. One such reform 
would be to reinforce policymaking institutions, for 
instance, fiscal frameworks for long-term fiscal 
sustainability (see Chapter 2 and Debrun and Joshi, 
2008). Doubts about fiscal sustainability can slow 
the recovery by lowering consumer spending and 
raising long-term real interest rates, which could 
hurt investment growth (IMF, 2009d). Other  
reforms, potentially importa
nt but not analyzed here 
in detail, include measures facilitating a structural 
shift in production from the nontraded toward the 
traded sector, for example, by making labor markets 
more flexible (IMF, 2008d). Finally, higher policy 
credibility would eventually help the NMS to satisfy 
the convergence criteria for euro adoption.
