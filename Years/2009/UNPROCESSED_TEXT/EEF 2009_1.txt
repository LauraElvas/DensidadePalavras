The EU economy is, finally, at the turning point. Signs of improvement in the economic situation and 
outlook have become increasingly apparent this autumn
. For the first time in tw
o years, the forecast has 
been revised up. GDP growth is expected to turn po
sitive again in the second half of the year, thereby 
putting an end to the deepest, longest and most broa
d-based recession in EU's history. This would not 
have been possible without the determined and concerted policy action taken EU wide. In so doing, both a 

systemic meltdown and an outright depression were avoided. The extraordinary public support put in 

place under the umbrella of the European Economic R
ecovery Plan has been instrumental in stabilising 
the economy. It is now key to fully implement the announced measures to maintain the positive growth 

momentum. Moreover, it is time to move beyond short-term demand management to address the supply-

side forces at play.  
Indeed, while the recession may be over, the impact of 
the crisis is not. Although several financial stress 
indicators are back at pre-crisis levels, the banki
ng sector remains fragile. Possible further losses are 
estimated to range from some •200 to •400 bn in 2009-2010 for this sector. There is also a need for 

deleveraging among households and firms. Capital costs are set to remain higher (than in the pre-crisis 

period) due to elevated risk premia. These factor
s are expected to put a brake on investment and 
consumption growth going forward. Moreover, the full impact of the crisis on the labour market and 

public finances is yet to come. However, there are also risks on the upside. The recovery could, for 

example, prove more pronounced if the impact of measures to restore the soundness of the financial 

sector and on confidence proves stronger than expected.  
Following an initial, largely policy-driven boost, economic activity is expected to ease somewhat in the 
course of next year and to regain ground only gradually as domestic and external demand strengthen. Two 

areas stand out as particularly important in determ
ining how the EU economy will evolve over the more 
medium term. This forecast document 
therefore contains two analytical 
chapters discussing the impact of 
the crisis on labour markets and public debt.  
Starting with the labour markets, developments so far 
(although dire) are better than earlier expected. This 
is partly explained by the use of short-term policy measures along with labour hoarding in some Member 

States. Firms are, however, expected to increase job 
shedding and the unemployment rate is set to rise 
further. Historical evidence suggests
 that an increase in unemployment following a financial crisis could 
become persistent. On the other hand, the better-than-expected development could in part reflect the 

favourable impact of past labour-market reforms, 
which made the labour markets more resilient.   
Turning to public finances, the crisis is taking its toll on debt developments via its impact on fiscal 
balances and lower growth. Although the projected sharp increase in government debt ratios is not 

necessarily out of the ordinary for a financial crisis 
episode, the high initial level of debt, especially in 
some Member States, makes it more difficult to sustain. Once the underlying recovery has gained 

sufficient traction, i.e. in 2011, a period of fiscal co
nsolidation will have to follow to put public debt back 
on a sustainable footing.  
Summing up, this outlook points to a gradual recovery. It will be key to tackle the labour-market and debt 
challenges identified to ensure the 
transition to a solid sustainable recovery further out. Addressing these 
challenges with determination will allow the EU 
economy to emerge stronger after the crisis.

Economic and Financial Affairs 
OVERVIEW   1 The EU economy is emerging from recession with GDP growth turning 
positive again in the second half of this year. This better-than-expected 

rebound in the near term is expected to be followed by a certain easing in 

growth. The outlook is thus for a gradual recovery further out, as several 
factors are set to restrain domestic and external demand in the medium term. 

Future developments in the labour market and public finances, discussed in 

greater detail in the two accompanying analytical chapters, will be crucial in 
this regard.  
The current recession has proved to be the deepest, longest and most broad-
based recession in the EU's history. GDP is set to fall by about 4% in 2009 

for both the EU and the euro area. 
The cumulative output loss amounts to 
some 5% since the recession started in 
the second quarter of 2008. This is 
about three times more than
 the average loss in the previous three recessions. 
All economies are affected by the cr
isis where, among the large Member 
States, the 2009 contraction ranges fr
om about 2% in France to 4½-5% in 
Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. In Poland, GDP growth is expected 

to slow sharply, although it escapes a fall in GDP. This divergence in 

economic performance reflects, inter 
alia, varying exposures to major 
financial sector disturbances, differing degrees of trade openness and the 
existence or not of a housing boom prior to the crisis.  
Signs of improvement in the economic situation have become increasingly 
apparent in both confidence indicators and hard data since the summer. The 

exceptional monetary and fiscal meas
ures put in place have not only 
prevented a systemic meltdown, but also allowed for a marked improvement 

in financial-market conditions, even with
 several indicators back at pre-crisis 
levels. The outlook for the world economy has also strengthened and 

especially so in emerging-market econom
ies, mainly in Asia where China is 
leading the way. Together with the 
impact of improved confidence across 
sectors and countries, growth is expected to turn positive again as of the third 
quarter of 2009 in both the EU and euro area.  
This initial upturn in economic activity in the EU and abroad is, however, 
largely driven by temporary factors. In
 particular, the favourable impact of 
inventory adjustment (with the destocking process coming to an end) and 

stimulus measures are expected to fade
 away in the course of next year 
(1)
. The recovery thereafter is 
projected to be differen
t from earlier cyclical 
upturns as the economy is finding its way to a new equilibrium. Several 

factors are expected to dampen dom
estic demand including a need for 
financial deleveraging across sectors, an expected further deterioration of the 

labour market and supply constraint
s stemming from the adverse impact of 
the financial crisis on potential output.  
The traditional pattern of EU recoveries typically begins with a pick-up in 
exports. The EU initially benefits from an improved outlook for global 

growth and a rebound in trade, notably in the more export-oriented EU 

economies. However, global activity is also set to go through a soft patch in 
the course of 2010 when temporary factors peter out, while private demand 

may not recover fast enough to support growth. The EU's external 
                                                          
 (1) The outlook is prepared using the usual no-policy-change assu
mption, thus taking into account measures known in sufficient 
detail by the cut-off date of 22 October 2009.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  2 environment is also affected by the ongoing rebalancing of world demand. As 
a result, EU export growth is set to firm only gradually over the forecast 
period.  
Notwithstanding the support from an im
proved external environment, a 
sustained pick-up in the underlying recovery would require an improved 

outlook for private domestic demand. Traditionally, an upturn in exports 

spurs demand for investment which subsequently supports employment and 

private consumption growth. At present, however, this export - domestic 
demand nexus is anticipated to be weaker. A historically low capacity 

utilisation rate, relatively weak demand 
prospects, subdued profitability gains 
and still moderating credit growth underpin the projected (unusually 

moderate) recovery of gross fixed capital formation, which is projected to 

turn positive only in 2011. This, together with the need to deleverage 

households' balance sheets further and the expected bleak labour-market 

situation, is likely to make private consumption sluggish (recovering to about 
1% growth only by 2011).  
Overall, after the temporary boost exp
ected during the second half of this 
year, real GDP growth is expected to ease somewhat and to regain ground 

only by the second half of next year. As both external and domestic demand 
gradually strengthen, growth could recover to about 0.5% quarter-on-quarter 

(q-o-q) during 2011 in both the EU and 
the euro area. Taking
 into account the 
weak carry-over from this year, annual growth rates will be limited to about 

¾% in 2010 in both regions. The following year, GDP could grow by some 

1½%, thereby starting to gradually close the output gap that will have opened 
up by then as a result of the crisis.  
The recession has caused a deterioration 
in the labour market, although a less 
dramatic one than initially expected. This is largely explained by the use of 

short-term policy measures, along with the impact of past labour-market 
reforms and labour hoarding in some 
Member States. Firms are, however, 
expected to increase labour sheddi
ng in the coming quarters and the 
unemployment rate is set to increase further, reaching 10¼% in the EU in 

2011 (10¾% in the euro area). Looking ahead to the medium term and as 

discussed in the labour-market chapter, the financial crisis implies a number 

of risks for labour-market developments Œ including the possibility of a 

'jobless' recovery, persistently high unemployment and a shrinking workforce 

- with prospects further out depending on the flexibility of the market and the 
policies in place.   
Growing slack in the economy, particularly high unemployment, should 
dampen wage and inflationary pressures in the period ahead, although 

consumer price inflation is expected 
to rebound somewhat from its current, 
very low level. HICP inflation is estimated to average 1-1¼% in 2010 and 
around 1½% in 2011 in both the EU and the euro area. Differences across 

countries are less pronounced than they 
were prior to the crisis and, area-
wide, both actual inflation and inflation expectations appear well behaved.  
Public finances have been hit hard by the crisis with the government deficit 
set to increase rapidly to 7½% of GDP by 2010 in the EU and to around 7% 

in the euro area (up from 2¼% in the 
EU and 2% in the euro area in 2008). 
This surge follows from the working of automatic stabilisers as the economic 
situation has deteriorated; the discretionary measures taken to support the 

economy; and the stronger-than-usual responsiveness of public revenues to 

the exceptional decline in economic activity
 and, as a result, tax bases, which

soar as a result of the 
crisis 
Overview 
  3 partly reflects the changed composition of growth (towards less tax-rich 
components). Similarly, public debt is bearing the brunt of the crisis and is 

expected to increase to 79¼% of GDP by
 2010 in the EU (84% in the euro 
area). A certain improvement is foreseen in the deficit ratio in 2011 as 

economic activity picks up and tempor
ary measures come to an end. 
However, the debt ratio remains on an 
increasing path in view of the still 
high primary deficit and rising interest payments, which have been only 

partly offset by the recovery in nominal GDP growth. Although a one-off 

increase in government debt does not in itself put public-finance 

sustainability at risk, the chapter on public-debt evolution argues that in 

combination with sustained large deficits, lower potential output and an 

unfavourable demographic development, the debt evolution is a source of 
concern for long-term sustainability.  
The economic situation remains highly uncertain. Overall, risks to the growth 
outlook are broadly balanced. On the one hand, the recovery could prove 

more pronounced in the near term, with
 activity temporarily supported by the 
impact of discretionary measures and the turning of the inventory cycle. 

Further ahead, policy measures might boost the soundness of the financial 

sector, and confidence, by more than 
expected, thereby supporting domestic 
demand. Global demand (and hence exports) could also pick up more 

strongly. On the other hand, if the banking sector does not repair its balance 

sheet, the credit channel is likely to remain impaired posing a major 

downside risk to the sustainability of the recovery. The impact of 

deteriorating labour-market conditions on wage formation and savings 

behaviour could also prove worse than expected. Moreover, the low capacity 
utilisation and higher cost of capital could weigh more on investment.  
Risks to the inflation outlook also appear largely balanced. Higher 
commodity prices imply upward price pres
sures, but these are expected to be 
broadly offset by downward pressure stemming from the remaining slack in 
the economy.  
Uncertainty stays high, 
but risks are balanced 
PART I Economic developments at the aggregated level   1. THE EU ECONOMY: THE ROAD AHEAD 
   7 1.1. ADJUSTING TO A NEW STEADY STATE 
The world economy is beginning to gradually 
emerge from the worst recession in the post WWII 

era. The EU, like most other advanced regions, has 

been hit hard. Indeed, a ke
y feature of the current 
severe downturn has been its global and 

synchronised nature, with all major regions 

registering a marked slowdown or contractions in 

output this year. The global nature of this recession 

reflects the high degree of interconnectedness of 

financial and product markets across international 

borders, which also played 
a role in the very rapid 
propagation of the global financial crisis to the real 

economy. 
The size and impact of the financial shock have 
been markedly more pronounced than expected 

only a year ago. The curren
t financial crisis is now 
widely regarded as the most severe shock to the 

global economy since the 
Great Depression of the 
1930s.

the late summer of 2007, the failure of Lehman

Brothers, a major US investment bank, in 
September 2008 dramatically changed the scene. It 

seriously damaged confidence among investors 

and thereafter rapidly pushed global financial 

markets to the brink of meltdown. The prevailing 

perception in the preceding period, that a systemic 

banking sector collapse was unlikely, suddenly lost 

credibility and gave way to panic. Interbank 

markets nearly stalled or became dysfunctional. 

Risk premia and credit 
spreads in the EU and 
abroad surged, while stocks, in particular those of 

financial institutions, went into tailspin. A second 

perception that changed was the belief that the EU 

economy would be partly immune to the financial 

turbulence, as the real economy was thought to be 

underpinned by strong fundamentals, at the 

aggregate level, and the financial system to have 

little direct exposure to the underlying source of 

the turbulence: the US 
sub-prime credit market. 
However, as graph I.1.1 shows, this perception 

rapidly gave way to a wave of pessimism, with 

forecasts being revised down at record speed to 

lows not seen in decades. Faced with a crisis that 

had began to feed on itself, reflecting feedback 

loops from deteriorating financial conditions to 

confidence and plungi
ng economic activity, 
particularly in international trade and 

manufacturing, monetary and fiscal authorities 

acted decisively and in a concerted manner to 
The EU economy is set to emerge fr
om the deepest and longest recession in its history in the second half 
of this year and to embark on a gradual recovery over 2010 and 2011. This brighter outlook, compared 

with the Commission services™ spring forecast, reflects an upgrading of prospects for global growth and 

trade as well as noticeable improvements in financial market conditions, both supported by decisive 

policy actions to combat the crisis worldwide. 
This cautiously optimistic outlook rests on the interpla
y of several important factors, which tend to push 
the economy in different directions 
in the short and medium term. The 
turning of the inventory cycle and 
the stimulus measures are expected to boost activity in the second half of this year and into 2010. 

Further ahead, elements restraining 
the pick-up in domestic private demand are expected to come to the 
fore. These include, inter alia, the deterioration of the labour market, the need for substantial financial 

deleveraging across all sectors and supply constrai
nts stemming from the adverse impact of the 
financial crisis on potential output. 
However, uncertainty is still high, as would be exp
ected following a deep recession triggered by a 
global financial crisis that is not yet over. The impact on output, unemployment and balance sheets is 

likely to be profound and the underlying recovery, once the favourable effects of temporary factors peter 

out, may thus prove different from earlier cycles, as the EU economy finds its way to a new equilibrium 

in a changed domestic and external environment. Non-negligible risks, therefore, loom further out on 

the forecast horizon of the pr
ojected EU economic recovery.

% Nonetheless, the current recession is set to be the 
deepest, longest and most 
broad-based recession in 
the EU™s history, with real GDP expected to 

contract this year by some 4%. All Member States, 

except Poland, are estimated
 to register a fall in 
GDP this year. Among the largest Member States, 

the contractions range from about 2¼% in France 

to 5% in Germany and Italy. Within the euro area, 

the countries most affected are Slovenia and 

Ireland (around -7½%), followed closely by 

Finland (nearly -7%) and Slovakia (about -6%). 

Outside the euro area the contractions are 

generally more severe than for the euro area 

average, with, for instan
ce, Denmark, Sweden and 
the UK estimated to contract by some 4½%. The 

situation is extreme in the Baltics, where the 

estimated GDP falls are in double digit figures 

(close to -14% in Estonia and about -18% in Latvia 

and Lithuania). 
At the aggregate EU level, the cumulative output 
loss since GDP started to 
contract in the second 
quarter of 2008 is slightly over 5 pps. This is about 

three times as large as the average output loss in 

the previous three recessions since the 1970s (see 

graph I.1.2). In terms of length, the current 

recession spanned five consecutive quarters of 

contractions and was more than twice as long as 

the recessions of the early 1970s and 1980s, 

though only a quarter longe
r than that of the early 
1990s. The relative size 
of the current loss of 
output is in line with recent research findings on

Note:  74Q4, 80Q2, 92Q2 and 08Q2 identify the first 
quarter of 
negative q-o-q GDP growth in the corresponding recession.
 Within GDP, sizable losses in trade and investment 
spending characterise the current recession. 

Reflecting the near collapse of world trade at the 

turn of the year, the cumulative loss in export and 

import volumes has been staggering, in the order 

of 18 and 17 pps. respectively. The drop was over 

four times as large as 
the average decline in 
previous recessions for exports and about three 

times for imports. Next in order of importance was 

the decline in spending on gross fixed capital 

formation (incl. inventories), which fell by some 

13 pps., also about three times larger a drop than in 

previous recessions. In star
k contrast, the drop in 
private consumption spending was only slightly 

larger compared to the average of previous 

recessions. In fact, privat
e consumption appears to 
have been a stabilising factor, contracting 

significantly less than GDP in this recession. 

Finally, owing to the forceful policy response to 

the crisis and the work of automatic stabilisers, 

public spending increased in this recession by 

more than the average of the previous recessions. 
Consistent with this picture, the contributions of 
demand components show that the main drags on 

growth during this downturn were the collapse in 

fixed capital formation and strong stock

exports mentioned above was nearly matched by 

that of imports, the drag from net exports appears 

comparatively small. Nevertheless, this perspective 

conceals the important role of external demand in 

the contraction of activity, as the former was in 

large part responsible for the decline in investment 

and the sharp destocking. 
The crisis has had asymmetric effects across 
Member States. The impact varied depending, inter 

alia, on (i) the degree of exposure to risky assets 

and the size of the financial sector (e.g. the UK) 

(ii) the export dependen
cy of the economy (e.g. 
Germany) and the current
 account position (e.g. 
Hungary, the Baltics) and (iii) the extent to which 

house prices had been overvalued and construction 

industries oversized (e.g
. Ireland and Spain).

 For instance, as illustrated in graphs (I.1.3a,b), the 
impact on the composition of growth has been 

different across countries, depending on their 

initial current account po
sition (with surplus 
countries having had a comparatively stronger 

contraction of net exports, while deficit countries 

having registered larger contractions in domestic 

demand). Thus, the crisis appears to have triggered 

adjustments of current account imbalances within 
the EU. To what extent this
 process is cyclical or 
lasting remains an open question (see also Box 

I.1.5).  
The recognition that growth 
in the pre-crisis period 
was amply supported by unsustainable financial 

conditions suggests that the EU economy may now 

be in a transition phase to a new steady state, with 

possibly numerous structural breaks in the 

traditional relationships linking economic 

variables. These considerations, which come on 

top of the inherent difficulties in assessing the 

outlook at a cyclical turning point, make the 

context of the present forecast rather unique.  
What might this new equilibrium for the EU 
economy look like?  While it is certainly too early 

to provide an accurate description, one can point to 

the main forces likely to delineate its contours. 

Firstly, it seems reasonable to expect a higher cost 
of capital, due to higher risk premia than in the 

pre-crisis period, as the crisis has made investors 

acutely aware of consequences of mispricing risk. 

Secondly
, a related aspect is that the current crisis 
has exposed sizable vulnerabilities within the EU 

economy, notably the excessive financial leverage 

of households, firms and governments. The 

ensuing deleveraging process is likely to take some 

time and constrain the response of each sector to 

the recovery. 
Thirdly
, the full impact of the severe 
recession triggered by the crisis has yet to be felt in 

the labour market and public finances. In labour 

markets, apart from the 
cyclical deterioration, 
some traditionally key industries that are harshly 

hit by the crisis may have to be downsized or 

relocated, potentially leading to increases in 

structural unemployment (a higher NAIRU). 

Regarding public finances, following the 

exceptional stimulus, a protr
acted period of fiscal 
consolidation will have to follow at some stage to 

put public debt back on a sustainable footing. 

Fourthly
, in the absence of appropriate policy 
responses, a considerable deterioration in these 

areas could impinge on growth prospects in the 

medium term. Indeed, a key question at the current 

juncture is whether and to what extent the crisis 

will cast a long shadow on potential output. 
(5)
 Finally
, the external environment for the EU and 
the euro area is likely to become different too, with 

a euro that remains strong and if a sustainable

 These various forces are li
kely to affect Member 
States differently. For in
stance, within the euro 
area, Spain and Ireland, and outside it, the Baltics, 

which are most affected
 by an increase in 
unemployment, may also face the risk of a 

considerable increase in th
e NAIRU, as part of the 
deterioration in the labour market is related to the 

need to adjust oversized construction sectors.  
The next sections of this chapter present the short-
term outlook for the EU economy, addressing to 

some extent also these more medium-term 

questions, as the autumn forecast presented here 

extends the forecast horiz
on to 2011. Indeed, the 
outlook described below is shaped by different 

forces affecting in oppo
sing direction the short-
term and more medium-term growth dynamics. In 

the short term, growth is set to recover Œ quite 

strongly in some cases, e.g. Germany and France Œ 

on the back of the stimulus measures and an end to 

the sharp destocking. Beyond the short term, once 

the favourable impact of
 these temporary factors 
subsides, important forces restraining the pick-up 

in domestic private demand come into play. These 

include, inter alia, historically low levels of 

capacity utilisation, still impaired financial 

intermediation, the need for substantial financial 

deleveraging across all sectors, the further 

deterioration of the labour market, the possible 

increase in the household saving rate and, not least, 

the estimated adverse impact of the financial crisis 

on potential output. 
1.2. THE EU ECONOMY GRADUALLY 
EMERGING FROM THE DEEP RECESSION The economic situation in the EU and the euro 
area has brightened since spring. The pace of 

quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) GDP contraction slowed 

markedly in the second quarter of 2009 in both 

regions, declining by merely 0.3% in the EU and 

0.2% in the euro area. This follows GDP 

contractions of almost 2% in the last quarter of 

2008 and some 2½% in the first quarter of 2009 in 

the two regions. This indicates that a cyclical 

turning-point might have been reached in the first 

quarter of this year. A
ll GDP components except 
stock-building registered some improvement 
                                                          
 (6) The technical exchange rate assumptions for 2009-11, as 
well as other external assumptions, are spelled out in the 
technical box I.1.1. 
relative to the first quarter. In particular, the two 
largest Member States, Germany and France, 

surprised on the upside, posting positive growth 

rates (+0.3% for both) in that quarter, after over a 

year of quarterly contractions. These two 

economies are thus leading the way in the region's 

nascent recovery. Activity continued to contract, 

although at an appreciably
 slower pace, in Italy 
(-0.5%), Spain and the Netherlands (both -1.1%). 
The stabilisation of the pace of economic activity 
in the EU stems from exceptional monetary and 

fiscal policy stimuli as well as considerable 

improvements in the main factors that previously 

drained growth, namely financial markets and the 

external environment. Inde
ed, improvements in the 
latter are necessary to underpin any upgrading of 

prospects for the EU demand components most 

affected by the crisis: exports and investment.  
Financial market conditions are improving 
and– The swift and large-scale policy actions 
undertaken by governments and central banks in 

response to the crisis have not only been successful 

in preventing a systemic meltdown, they have also 

led to the marked improvement in financial market 

conditions observed in the last few months, with 

some stress indicators now back at pre-crisis 

levels. Confidence among market participants has 

also strengthened on the back of a widening stream 

of positive news on the outlook for the real 

economy as well as better-than-expected earnings 

reports by both non-fin
ancial corporates and 
banks.  
Indeed, with falling risk perceptions and easing 
risk premia, financial markets have improved 

considerably since the spring. In interbank money 

markets, responding to sustained loose monetary 

policy and declines in the risk perception of 

financial institutions, spreads have continued to 

narrow, reaching levels not seen since the 

beginning of 2008, and in some cases even earlier 

(e.g. in the US). Corporate and sovereign bond 

spreads have also continued to narrow, supported 

by a decline in default 
perceptions and receding 
liquidity and solvency premia. 
Stock markets around the world have rallied on the 
back of renewed optimism regarding corporate 

profits and the global economic outlook. Most EU 

stock indices have gained some 15% since the  
Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  11 spring forecast was released in May, with the 
rebound in financial sector sub-indices being more 

pronounced (around 20%), in some cases already 

recovering the losses since November 2008 (S&P 

500). 
(7)
   It is noteworthy that the increasing risk 
appetite across financial markets has not affected 

sovereign benchmark yields very much, which 

consequently remained broadly at low levels. 
(8)
. In 
sum, the markets currently appear to be pricing in 

a sustained economic recovery that has yet to be 

confirmed.  
These developments combined with lower interest 
rates have translated into lower financing cost for 

both non-financial corporations and households. 

According to the Composite Financing Cost

ite of ongoing 
concerns regarding the health of banks' balance sheets in 

developed economies. 
(8) Government bond yields seem to embody a more cautious 
assessment of the growth outlook than that reflected in 

stock price developments over the same period. Moreover, 
lower short-rate expectations
 have most likely added to 
lower long-term yields. Fina
lly, a sustained buying of 
government bonds by the banking sector and institutional 
investors may have supported 
bond prices, despite strong 
issuance. Indicator (CFCI) compiled by the Commission 
services,
(9) nominal euro-area financing costs for 
non-financial corporations have declined by about 

1½ pp. since the peak in October 2008, reflecting 

the lower cost of bank loans, equity capital and 

market debt. For households
, the CFCI declined by 
1 percentage point since the peak in October 2008, 

as the cost of all types of loans fell with lower 

retail and market interest rates. However, fund 

raising has been driven mostly by large high-rated 

borrowers in economic sectors that have been less 

hit by the crisis, while smaller and more distressed 

companies are still shut out. 
                                                          
 (9) The CFCIs synthesise developments in external financing 
costs for nonfinancial corporations and households. The 

indicators are calculated as averages of the different 
external financing costs, weighted according to their 
importance for financing (i.e. 
share of total outstanding 
liabilities). For euro area non-fi
nancial corporations the 
CFCI combines the marginal 
costs of taking up short-, 
medium- and long-term bank loan
s, market-based debt and 
quoted equity. For euro-area households, the CFCI 

combines the cost of bank lending for short-, medium- and 
long-term consumer credit, lending for house purchases 
and lending for other purposes

%European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  12   Box I.1.1: 
Some technical elements behind the forecast
The overall cut-off date for taking new information 
into account in this update of the Commission's 
macroeconomic outlook was 22 October.  
External assumptions 
This forecast is based on a set of external 
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the 
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions 
from possible volatility during any given trading 

day, averages from a 10-day reference period 
(between 6 and 19 October) were used for 
exchange and interest rates, and for oil prices.  
Exchange and interest rates 
The technical assumption as regards exchange rates 
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange 
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption 

leads to implied average USD/EUR rates of 1.39 in 
2009 and 1.48 in 2010 and 2011. For the average 
JPY/EUR rates it leads to 130.20 in 2009 and 

132.82 in 2010 and 2011. 
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based. Short-
term interest rates for the euro area are derived 
from future contracts. Long-term interest rates for 
the euro area, as well as short- and long-term 
interest rates for other Member States, are 
calculated using implicit forward swap rates, 
corrected for the current spread between the 

interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no 
market instrument is available, a fixed spread vis-à-
vis euro-area interest rates is taken for both short- 

and long-term rates. As a result, short-term interest 
rates are expected to be 1.3% on average in 2009, 
1.5% in 2010 and 2.5% in 2011 in the euro area. 

Long-term interest rates are assumed to be 3.2% on 
average in 2009, 3.5% in 2010 and 3.8% in 2011. 
Commodity prices 
Commodity-price assumptions are also, as far as 
possible, based on market conditions. According to 
future markets, prices for Brent oil are projected to 
be on average 61.3 USD/bl. in 2009, 76.5 USD/bl. 

in 2010 and 80.5 USD/bl. in 2011. This would 
correspond to an oil price of 44.0 EUR/bl. in 2009, 
51.7 EUR/bl. in 2010 and 54.3 EUR/bl. in 2011. 
Budgetary data  
Data up to 2008 are based on data notified by 
Member States to the European Commission on 1 
October and validated b
y Eurostat on 22 October 
2009 
(1)
. In validating the data, Eurostat expressed a 
reservation for Greece ‚due to significant 
uncertainties over the figures notified by the Greek 
statistical authorities™.  
As usual government deficit data notified by the 
UK for the years to 2008 have been slightly 

amended for consistency with Eurostat's view on 
the recording of UMTS licences proceeds.  
For the forecast, measures in s
upport of financial 
stability have been recorded in line with the 
Eurostat decision of 15 July 2009 
(2)
. Unless 
reported otherwise by the Member State concerned, 
capital injections known in sufficient detail have 
been included in the forecast as financial 
transactions, i.e. increasing the debt, but not the 
deficit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and 
deposits are not included as government 

expenditure, unless there is evidence that they have 
been called at the time the forecast was closed. 
Note however that loans granted to banks by the 

government, or by other entities classified in the 
government sector, usually add to government debt. 
For 2010, budgets adopted or presented to national 
parliaments and all other measures known in 
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. For 
2011, the 'no-policy-change' assumption used in the 
forecasts implies the extrapolation of revenue and 
expenditure trends and the inclusion of measures 

that are known in sufficient detail.  
The general government balances that are relevant 
for the excessive deficit procedure may be slightly 
different from those published in the national 
accounts. The difference concerns settlements 

under swaps and forward rate agreements (FRA). 
According to ESA95 (amended by regulation No 
2558/2001), swap and FRA-related flows are 

financial transactions and therefore excluded from 
the calculation of the government balance. 
However, for the purposes of the excessive deficit 

procedure, those flows are recorded as net interest 
expenditure.

Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  13 On the other hand, the flow of bank loans to non-
financial corporations and households continues to 

moderate. The annual growth rate of total bank 

loans to the euro-area private sector fell to 0.1% in 

August. These developments reflect both the 

deterioration in economic activity last winter and 

spring and the ongoing moderation of house-price 

dynamics. Supply-side factors (such as the ability 

to access market financin
g and banks™ liquidity 
positions) are putting downward pressure on 

lending activity too, although to a diminishing 

degree. The latest ECB Bank Lending Survey (July 

2009) shows that credit standards are still 

tightening, but at a signi
ficantly slower pace, a 
trend likely to continue in the coming quarters.

 Looking ahead, under the assumption of a gradual 
but modest economic recovery and the absence of 

a crystallisation of major risks, financial market 

conditions are expected to improve further. In 

particular, liquidity and funding constraints for 

banks should continue to ease and risk premia in 

financial markets should decline further. Lending 

volumes should eventually turnaround and start to 

rise, though remaining at modest levels. This 

subdued normalisation is expected to have an 

asymmetric impact on countries and economic 

activity.  
However, not all financial market indicators (e.g. 
money market spreads, credit standards, default 
risk premia) are expected to return to their pre-
crisis level over the forecast horizon, as sizeable 

weaknesses in the economic and financial system, 

in particular the high leverage of most economic 

sectors, have been clearly exposed by the crisis 

(see also Box I.1.2). Important concerns remain 

regarding the health of the banking sectors' balance 

sheets and the historical 
evidence suggests that 
banking sector repair takes time. Although there is 

some uncertainty as to the precise amount, 

potential losses for the sector going forward are 

generally deemed as substantial. For instance, 

using different methodologies, recent estimates by 

the ECB and the Committee of European Bank 

Supervisors (CEBS) point to future potential losses 

due to write-downs on loans and securities for euro 

area banks in the range of some •200 to •400 bn 

for the years 2009 and 2010. 
(10)
 These figures 
suggest that the financial sector may experience 

difficulties in carrying out its intermediation 

function and supporting a sustained recovery.  
Overall, whilst the improvements observed in 
financial market conditions since the spring bode 

well for developments on the real side, demand 

prospects also need to gain traction for firms to 

reignite production and investment plans. On this 

front, there has also been positive news from the 

external side, as discussed below. 
–the global economy is exiting the recession 
and world trade stabilising– On the back of the unprecedented policy support 
worldwide and the positive developments in 

financial markets just discussed, the economic 

situation and outlook for the world economy have 

also improved since the spring.   Economic activity

 forecasts are not adjusted for the number of 
working days, but quarterly forecasts are. 
However, the working-day effect in the EU and the 
euro area is estimated to be only limited over the 

forecast horizon, implying that adjusted and 
unadjusted growth rates differ only marginally. The 
calculation of potential growth and the output gap 

does not adjust for working days. Since it is 
considered temporary, it should not affect the 
cyclically-adjusted balances.  
  European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  14   Box I.1.2: 
Private sector's financial situation: impact on future growth
After coming close to a meltdown, the functioning 
of the financial system has improved in recent 
months. This general stabilisation of financial 
markets, in parallel with signs of an economic 
recovery, has also led to a recovery, partly from 
very low levels, of the average creditworthiness of 
banks and non-financial corporations (See Graph 

1) 
(1)
. However, the macro-financial situation 
remains fragile.  
The present box looks at the balance sheets of 
financial and non-financial corporations as well as 
households, which all point to the need for further 
deleveraging amid relatively weak income 
prospects. This tends to reduce the potential for 
further improvements of financing conditions and 

the pace of the future ec
onomic growth, while it 
also increases the risk of setbacks.

Stress in the 
banking sector
 has diminished in 
recent months. The availability of financing for 
banks has improved, but it is still impaired in some 
market segments. For example, while the 
functioning of interbank markets has recovered at 
the short end, it is still not fully functioning for 
longer maturities. Regarding banks' balance sheets, 
some repair has taken place in recent months. 
However, balance-sheet conditions remain 
challenging. Additional banks' write-downs related 
to securities and especially to loan exposures are 
likely as the outlook for the quality of loans to

 A credit default swap is a financial instrument for 
hedging the risk of debt default. The buyer of a CDS 
pays a premium (derived from the CDS spread) for 

effectively insuring against a debt default. He 
receives a previously agreed lump sum payment if the 
debt instrument is defaulted. The spread of a CDS is 

the annual amount the protection buyer must pay the 
protection seller over the length of the contract, 
expressed as a percentage of the notional amount. 
households and firms is expected to deteriorate 
further.
(2) 
On the other hand, the public guarantee 
and recapitalisation schemes in the financial sector 
have been used at the euro-area level up to about 
30% with regard to debt guarantees, up to around 
65% in terms of recapitalisation, and some 85% as 
regards asset relief programmes, leaving altogether 

an important buffer for possible future write-
downs.
(3)
 At the same time, the outlook for earnings 
from core banking activities is relatively weak, 
given the expected depressed level of economic 
activity and the possible damage to the business 
models of some banks following structural changes 
in their operating environment. The need for further 
deleveraging by banks seems significant (and could 
prove challenging). To some extent, this may lead 

to tightness in the availability of bank loans to 
firms and households once demand picks up. 
Despite recent improvements, financing conditions 
for 
non-financial corporations
 remain relatively 
tight, especially for smaller firms and firms 
operating in industries which have been particularly 
hard hit by the recession, such as the construction 
sector. Fundamentals of the non-financial corporate 
sector appear, overall, weaker than during the 
downturns of the early 1990s and the early 2000s. 
The high aggregate indebtedness of non-financial 
corporations (see Graph 2) and the outlook of 
reduced profitability, at least compared to 
profitability levels of prev
ious years, constitute a 
major drain on their balance sheets. The financial 
situation of non-financial corporations is further 
challenged in the near term by the fact that a large 
amount of debt will mature towards the end of 
2009 and in 2010. In this environment, efforts by 
non-financial corporations to deleverage may add 
to dampening investment further ahead.

 Potential losses for the sector going forward are 
deemed as substantial. The aggregate amounts 
estimated by the ECB, the IMF and the Committee of 
European Bank Supervisors (CEBS), however, differ 
due to the distinct methodologies employed. Over the 
period 2007Œ2010, the estimated losses of euro area 
banks due to write-downs on loans and securities 
range from some •450 bn. (ECB) and •580 bn. (IMF) 
billion, with about half still to be booked. The EU-
wide stress testing exercise conducted by CEBS for a 
sample of 22 major European banks indicates that in 

a more adverse scenario potential credit and trading 
losses over the years 2009-2010 could amount to 
almost •400 bn.  
(3)
 Based on information available by 30 September 
2009, the total of approved and not yet effective 
measures amounts to •2200 bn, of which almost 
•2000 bn is in terms of 
guarantees on bank liabilities.
  (Continued on the next page) 
Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  15 and trade are stabilising generally and some 
economies have already st
arted to rebound in the 
first half of 2009. This is particularly the case in 

emerging markets, mainly
 Asia, where China is 
leading the way.  
A more general rebound is expected in the second 
half of this year and the fi
rst half of 2010. This is 
suggested by the strong upturn in short-term 

indicators of global economic activity. The global 

PMI for manufacturing moved back into 

expansionary territory in August and remained 

there in September. After two consecutive 

quarterly drops of above 5%, estimates by the CPB 

(Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy 

Analysis) show that world industrial production 

increased by 2% q-o-q in the second quarter of 

2009, the strongest rise since 2003. Among 

regions, emerging Asia recorded the most 

pronounced rebound in production, but advanced 

economies also saw a stabilisation in the second 

quarter. 
Global GDP (excl. EU) growth is thus projected to 
rebound from a contraction of some Œ½% this 

year, the first contraction of world growth since 

WWII, to about 4% growth in 2010-2011. This 

compares to an average growth rate of about 5¼% 

registered in the 2005-2008 period. However, the 

projected annual profile masks the expectation that 

global growth may soften 
again in the second half 
of 2010 and remain subdued in 2011 in advanced 

economies, and that the recovery may prove more 

dynamic in parts of the emerging world. In the 

short-term, the broadening of the positive 

momentum is driven by the global stimulus 

measures and support from the inventory cycle. 

Further ahead, the world economy may face a soft 

patch, with the favourable impact of these 

temporary factors fading away and private demand 

not recovering fast enough to support growth. This 

is particularly the case for some advanced 

economies, where Œ being at
 the epicentre of the 
financial crisis Œ credit standards are likely to 

remain tight for some considerable time, adding to

Lower interest rates and higher stock prices have 
recently provided some relief for the balance sheets 
of 
households.
 Yet, the situation remains 
challenging. Households' debt has risen 
significantly over recent years, and their financial 
net wealth has decreased slightly across the cycle. 
There are, however, noteworthy differences across 
Member States (see Graph 3). The negative impact 

of these developments may be partly cushioned by 
a more common use of a variable interest rate in 
some of the countries that have recorded the largest 

increases in debt-to-GDP ratio (like Ireland, Spain, 
Greece and Portugal) in an environment of low

short-term interest rates assumed for the forecast 
horizon. 
Looking forward, higher unemployment and 
decelerating wage growth is weighing on 
household income. Meanwhile, households' net 
wealth will also be affected by the weak near-term 
housing-market outlook in several Member States. 
Indeed, the ability of households to honour their 
debt may prove to be weaker than in previous 
recoveries following recessions. In this 
environment, the scope for strong, sustained 
increases in household expenditure appears limited 
unless the labour market reacts swiftly to economic 
activity.

    16 the formidable headwinds still to be faced to 
reanimate private spending in this region.  
Among the largest non-EU advanced economies, 
US GDP is projected to recover from a contraction 

of 2½% this year to about 2¼% growth in 2010, 

before easing somewhat in 2011 (2%). In Japan, 

GDP is projected to recove
r from a contraction of 
some 6% this year to about 1% growth in 2010, 

before slowing to about ½% in 2011 (see Box I.1.3 

for a discussion on global imbalances). 
In contrast, in China, GD
P is projected to grow 
robustly over the forecast 
horizon, by around 8¾% 
this year and 9½% in the two subsequent years, on 

the back of buoyant credit expansion and sizeable 

policy stimulus measures, which raises concern 

about its medium-term sustainability. However, 

China's growth in the fo
recast years remains below 
the 2005-2008 average. 
Beyond China, the cyclic
al lead of emerging 
economies in Asia reflects their favourable starting 

position in this crisis, with large reserve holdings, 

low exposure to the financial market havoc, high 

saving rates and low household debt, placing their 

private sectors in a position to rapidly take 

advantage of the additional income from the 

stimulus measures. For instance, India and 

Indonesia, the largest emerging Asian economies 

after China, have shown remarkable resilience, 

with growth driven by domestic demand expected 

to average, respectively,
 some 5¾% and 4% this 
year. The smaller and more open economies in the 

region (that had been hit hard notably through the 
collapse in trade) have 
clearly rebounded in the 
second quarter of 2009, driven by industrial 

production. Emerging Asia as a whole is expected 

to post 5% growth this year and some 7% in 2010-

2011. Outside this region, Brazil and Russia, two 

other main emerging markets that have also been 

recovering strongly this year, are expected to 

rebound to respectively 4¼% and 2¼% growth in 

2010 and continue at the same pace or somewhat 

higher in 2011, due, inter alia, to firmer 

commodity prices and the rebound in exports of 

capital goods. 
World trade is also stab
ilising. The pace of the 
trade decline slowed sign
ificantly in the second 
quarter of this year, after collapsing in the previous 

two quarters. According to estimates by the CPB, 

world trade volumes fell by just 0.7% q-o-q in 

2009Q2, compared 
to the unprecedented declines 
of Œ6¾% in 2008Q4 and -11% in 2009Q1. Several 

factors could possibly explain the deep fall in 

world trade, which was larger than could be 

expected on the basis of historical relationships. 

These factors include the tr
uly global nature of the 
sharp downturn in demand, the stark impact of the 

recession on manufacturing activity, the drying-up 

of trade finance and the increased vertical 

integration of production across countries.  
During the recession the global drop in demand 
affected mostly manufactured products, and 

especially capital goods and consumer durables, 

leading to a disproportionate impact on world 

trade, as these products form the bulk of 

international trade but represent a lower share of 
Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  17 world output. With the deterioration in financial 
conditions, access to trade financing also 

contracted sharply in the latter part of 2008, further 

dampening trade activity. According to the OECD 

(2009), the tightening of financial conditions in 

late 2008 is estimated to have accounted for close 

to a third of the decline in world trade in the fourth 

quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. 
(11)
  Finally, there seems to have been a faster impact of 

activity on trade as a result of globalisation and the 

increased prevalence of 
global supply chains. 
(12)
 (13) The flip side of this vertical integration 
mechanism is that it could also be a force leading 

to a synchronised surge in global trade once a 

sustained recovery in global demand sets in.

(12) The increased presence of vertical specialisation boosts the 
ratio of trade flows over produc

producing goods in two or more sequential stages, where at 

least one stage of production 
relies on imported inputs, and 
some part of that production is exported (see Yi, K-M.

 In sum, world trade (excluding the EU) is expected 
to contract by at least 
12% in 2009, but expand 
afterwards, by 4¼% in 2010 and 5% in 2011. The 

figure for 2009 constitutes a downward revision 

compared to the spring
 forecast that can be 
explained by the worse-than-expected data for the 

first half of the year, whereas the recovery is set to 

kick-in in the latter part of the year.  
After coming down sharply from the peaks of mid-
2008, oil and commodity prices have been firming 

recently, supported by rising demand from Asia 

and moderate optimism regarding global demand 

prospects, particularly from Asia. Commodity 

prices are generally expected to rise moderately 

over the forecast horizon, in
 line with the expected 
mild economic recovery and some supply 

constraints. Oil prices ar
e now assumed to increase 
from an average of USD 61¼/bl. in 2009 to USD 

76½ /bl. in 2010 and USD 80½/bl. in 2011. 
–providing support for an upgrading of the 
short-term EU outlook The EU and euro area are beginning to benefit 
from the rebound of the global economy. As 

mentioned earlier, this is in line with the traditional 

pattern of EU recoveries, where exports are the 

first demand component to pick-up in a cyclical 

upswing. Monthly data on extra-euro area exports 

show  a  progressive  slowdow

finance constraints appear to 
be working effectively, with 
about  of the USD 250bn of G20 trade finance facility 
having been already used. 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  18   Box I.1.3: 
Developments in global imbalances
Developments in the current accounts of major 
economies around the world have attracted 
attention in global policy debates, since current-
account imbalances are widely viewed as a 
contributing factor in the run-up to the recession. 
Global current-account imbalances built up in the 
world economy starting in the late 1990s, and in the 

years 2003-07 current-
account differences widened 
dramatically (see chart). Massive capital inflows 
allowed the US to finance their large and increasing 

current-account deficit although interest rates 
remained relatively low. These deficits were 
mirrored by substantial 
trade surpluses in and 
capital exports from other economies such as 
China, Japan and the oil-exporting countries. Some 
countries, such as the UK and Spain, also 
developed large and increasing current-account 
deficits. These were matched within the EU by 
current account surpluses in Germany and the 
Netherlands. Overall the EU and euro area current 
account has remained broadly balanced.

forecast
 The current crisis has brought about a 
temporary narrowing– 
The current-account deficit appears to be adjusting 
markedly in the US, from 4.3% of GDP in 2008Q4 
to 2.9 % in 2009Q1 and to 2.8% in 2009Q2 (s.a.), 

much helped by lower oil prices compared to mid-
2008. In Japan, the current-account surplus 
stabilised in 2009Q1, after having shrunk 

considerably in the previous quarters, and declined 
in the second quarter, due to the decline in the trade 
surplus. In China, the current-account surplus for 

the first half of 2009 showed a decrease by more 
than 4 pp. of GDP compared to the same period in 
the previous year. Due to the strong nominal 

growth rate, however, the forecast decline in the 
current account relative to GDP will not result in a 
decline in nominal terms, so China's current-
account surplus will remain high. In most of the 
oil-exporting countries, the surpluses widened in 
2008 because of the steep increase in oil prices in 
the first half of the year, but were then reduced 
markedly in the second half of the year, as oil 
prices dropped.  
–but no clear reversal up to 2011– 
The chart depicts the new set of Commission 
current-account for
ecasts for 2009-11. The current-
account deficit in the US is expected to stabilise in 

2010-11 at around 3
% of GDP. Gains in 
competitiveness from past dollar depreciation are 
more than offset by the return to positive, albeit 
slow, growth. China™s surplus is forecast to start 
increasing slightly again, based on the technical 
assumptions of fixed nominal exchange rates. In 

most of the oil-exporting countries, the assumed 
rise in oil prices will boost surpluses again. Japan™s 
surplus, however, is forecast to diminish following 

the change in government. At global level, the 
Commission forecast shows a stabilisation of 
global imbalances at a lower level than in the 

immediate pre-crisis period. There is a temporary 
component of the narrowing of global imbalances 
in 2009, especially given the correction observed in 
oil prices and the collapse in trade, but there could 
also be a more lasting component, stemming from 
e.g. changes in US household savings behaviour. 
–and global imbalances remain rather large  
Given the expected current-account developments 
in the main contributing economies around the 
world (US, China, oil-exporting countries) and 

under current assumptions for oil prices, as a result, 
global imbalances remain large going forward. 
Japan, however, appear to be contributing less to 

the global imbalances going forward.  
The euro area will switch from a broadly balanced 
current account to a moderate deficit of 0.6% of 
GDP in 2011. The contribution of the euro area to 
global imbalances is negligible, whilst the current 

changes at global level might have significant 
implications for the euro-area outlook, notably by 
changing the conditions on its traditional export 

markets or via exchange rate adjustments. 
However, like most other institutional forecasts, 
Commission forecasts use a technical assumption 

for exchange-rate developments, thus excluding the 
assessment of future developments in this area.  
  Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  19 contraction. While in year-on-year terms exports 
were still falling by about 20% in June (the latest 

available figure), the 3-month over 3-month rate of 

change, which better captures the short-term 

dynamics, has eased in recent months and even 

turned slightly positive. The effect is likely to be 

more pronounced for the more export-oriented 

economies (e.g. in 2009Q2, German exports were 

down by only 1.2% on the previous quarter, after 

drops of almost 11% in 2009Q1 and close to 8% in 

2008Q4). 
Before a revival of exports induces a pick-up in 
investment, however, a rebalancing of supply and 

demand conditions via inventories is required. 

Here recent signals are positive too: the inventory 

cycle appears to be at a point when stocks are no 

longer cut back, whereby it moves from acting as a 

significant drag on growth to contributing 

positively. The ratio of new orders to inventories 

in the manufacturing sect
or from the PMI survey, 
usually a good-leading indicator of underlying 

industrial production, has been trending up since 

early in the year, to reach 
just above 1.2 in the euro 
area in August and September, its highest level 

since late 2006.  
The assessment of stocks from the EU 
manufacturing survey gives a similar message. 

Companies still consider stock levels to be 

excessive, but the indicator is now approaching its 

long-term average, signalling that considerable 

stock-adjustment has taken place. This comes after 

shaving off more than 1 percentage point from 

quarter-on-quarter EU GDP growth between the 

last quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2009 

combined, and about ¾ pp. 
in the euro area (the 
largest negative inventory contribution since the 

start of the GDP series). Inventories should thus no 

longer act as a significant drag in the second half 

of this year.  
These positive signs bode well for manufacturing 
activity going forward. They are complemented by 

continuing improvements in both hard and soft 

leading indicators of industrial activity. After 

falling precipitously at the end of last year and the 

beginning of this year, when industrial production 

in the euro area fell by annualised quarterly rates 

of some 30%, the pace slow
ed to about 5% in the 
second quarter and has largely stabilised over the 

summer. Indeed, the latest reading showed a 0.9% 

m-o-m increase in August as well as sizable 

upwards revisions to previous data, leaving 

industrial output so far in the third quarter about 
1½% higher than the average in the second 
quarter. 
(15)
  An upswing in the industrial sector is 
also suggested by the OE
CD leading indicator for 
manufacturing activity in the euro area, which has 

improved gradually since the beginning of the 

year, reaching a level in August 2009 not seen 

since June 2008.

 Improved prospects are also reflected in overall 
business sentiment, which has continued to 

steadily recover from the historical lows reached at 

the beginning of the year. The composite 

Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) reached 50.4 in 

August, passing the threshold that separates 

contraction from expansion for the first time in 

fifteen months. This upward momentum was 

maintained in September, when the composite PMI 

edged up to a level (51) not seen since May 2008, 

reflecting improvements in both manufacturing 

and services. In September, the Commission's 

Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) was up for 

the sixth consecutive month, in both the EU and 

the euro area.  
Based on past experience, the current levels of the 
ESI and PMI, are consistent with a stabilisation or, 

possibly, positive GDP growth in the second half 

of 2009. This is in contrast to the negative figures 

presented in the spring 
forecast. Similarly, the 
Commission services' business-cycle tracer, which 

maps the survey results to the different phases of 

the business cycle, entered into the upswing area 

this summer, after having been deep in contraction 

territory for several months. 
(16)
  The improvement 
in business confidence is widespread among 
                                                          
 (15) Nonetheless, industrial 
production in August remained 
some 15% below its level in the previous year. 
(16) The business cycle indicator is made up from a weighted 
average of the five principal 
components from the survey 
series conducted in industry, se
rvices, building, retail trade 
and consumers.

 Another element that points to further 
improvements in the EU economy in the coming 

quarters is the fiscal stimulus measures adopted by 

Member States, which are expected to continue 

supporting demand during the second half of 2009 

and into 2010. Somewhat more than half of the 

planned amount for 2009 (about 1% of EU, GDP) 

is expected to be implemented in the second half 

of the year. According to Member States' 

intentions, the distribution between the third and 

fourth quarter should be broadly equal. For 2010, 

the stimulus measures are expected to be only 

slightly lower compared to 2009 (just below 1% of 

EU GDP). Going in the opposite direction, 

however, the termination of some of these 

measures in the meanti
me, such as the car-
scrappage scheme in several Member States, will 
weigh on car registrations and, thus, on private 
consumption.

 These overall positive developments, which were 
also behind the upgrading of projections for the 

second half of 2009 in the September interim 

forecast, explain why the picture for the second 

half of this year is largely maintained in this 

autumn forecast. Real GDP 
is expected to contract 
by some 4.1% this year in the EU and 4% in the 

euro area, practically unchanged compared to the 

spring forecast. However, the upward-revised 

growth momentum (see for instance the year-on-

year figures in the fourth quarter of 2009 in table 

1.1.4, which are considerably less negative than in 

the spring) mechanically improves the EU and 
euro area outlook for 2010, with a carry-over 

effect at the end of 2009 of some 0.2 and 0.3 pp., 

respectively, compared to 
Œ 0.4 pp in the spring.

   21 Constraining factors to cap the recovery 
further ahead– While the current recovery is being kick-started by 
an improved external environment (global activity 

and trade) and financial c
onditions and, not least, 
significant policy stimulus measures, making it 

sustainable ultimately requires a robust pick-up in 

private domestic spending. According to the 

typical recovery sequencing in the EU/euro area, 

the pick-up in exports normally spurs the demand 

for investment in capital and durable consumer 

goods, as these make up the bulk of international 

trade. However, at the cu
rrent juncture there are 
important constraining factors at play that may 

hamper this traditional export-investment nexus. 

Furthermore, with subdued investment growth, the 

next stage in the traditional business cycle 

turnaround, which brings employment and 

subsequently private consumption into the positive 

loop, would also prove weaker than in the past. 
In effect, as the favourable
 effect of the temporary 
factors currently supporting activity peters out, 

GDP growth is set to ease somewhat before 

regaining some ground only by the second half of 

next year. With both external and domestic 

demand gradually strengthening, GDP growth is 

projected to recover to about 0.5% q-o-q by the 

second quarter of 2011 in both the EU and the euro 

area. Taking into accoun
t the weak carry-over 
from 2009, annual growth rates are expected to be 

limited to 0.7% in 2010 in both regions. At the end 

of the forecast horizon, GD
P is forecast to grow by 
some 1½%, thereby startin
g to gradually close the 
considerable output gap that has opened up during 

this crisis. 
Turning to the forecast for the main domestic 
demand components, gross fixed capital formation 

typically plays a central role in shaping the 

business cycle dynamics, since despite accounting 

for little more than 20% of GDP, it is about three 

times more volatile than private consumption. As 

illustrated in section 1.1, investment spending was 

one of the main casualties of the current recession. 

However, the trough appears to have been reached 

in the first half of the year. After plummeting in 

the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of 

2009, the pace of contractio
n of investment slowed 
considerably in the second quarter in both the EU 

and the euro area (-1.9% q-o-q and -1.3% 

respectively). The sectoral
 breakdown shows that 
the contraction was mostly due to non-construction 

investment, which was dragged down by the strong 

decline in manufacturing production (machinery 

and transport equipment essentially). 
Going forward, a historically low capacity 
utilisation rate, weak demand prospects, subdued 

profitability gains, higher risk premia than in pre-

crisis period and still tight credit standards for non-

financial corporations, underpin the unusually 

moderate projected recovery of gross fixed capital 

formation. Overall investment spending is 

expected to continue contracting in 2010, albeit at 

a declining pace (by some
 2%, compared to around 
-11% in 2009), before picking up in 2011 to about 

2½% in the EU and 2% in the euro area. 
The capacity utilisation rate in the EU collapsed in 
the first half of this year in response to the 

dramatic output drop that followed the 

intensification of the financial crisis last autumn. 

The July 2009 reading of the quarterly 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  22 manufacturing survey showed that capacity 
utilisation stood at some 70%, the lowest level 

since DG ECFIN™s survey of the manufacturing 

industry started in 1990.  
To put this figure in perspective, it is worth noting 
that in the period preceding the crisis, the rate of 

capacity utilisation hovered 
in a narrow band, with 
two cyclical peaks at around 84% at end 2000 and 

mid-2007, and lows around 80%. Moreover, in the 

past two upturns, equipment investment began to 

recover when capacity utilisation rates reached 

around 81%. Hence, going by past behaviour, this 

level may be seen as a reasonable threshold for 

firms to resume investment plans. Assuming that 

capacity utilisation adjusts at a similar average 

pace as that observed 
during the do
wnturn, it 
would reach the 81% threshold only at the 

beginning of 2011.

t The manufacturing surv
eys also show that 
insufficient demand has increasingly been the main 

factor limiting production in the euro area during 

the past three quarters, followed by financial 

constraints, which have gained in importance 

during the last three months. An informative short-

term indicator for equipment investment in the 

European Commission's monthly business surveys 

is the service sector's assessment of past demand 

conditions. 
(17)
  Having bottomed out in May, at 
well below its long-term average, the assessment 

of past demand conditions in services has risen 

fairly strongly up to 2009Q3, supporting the view 

that a trough in the trajectory of equipment 

investment may have already been reached.  
                                                          
 (17) Interestingly, this indicator shows stronger correlation with 
equipment investment than either the manufacturing PMIs 
or the EC manufacturing confidence indicator. 
In terms of the financing of equipment investment, 
a useful piece of information contained in the 

ECB's bank lending survey is the assessment of 

credit availability, which is well-correlated with 

the quarter-on-quarter grow
th rate of equipment 
investment. After falling for several quarters, this 

series ceased to deteriorate in the second quarter 

and even improved in the third quarter, possibly 

signalling a reversal of the investment cycle. 

However, the current level of the series remains 

well-below its historical average, consistent with 

weak capital spending in the coming quarters.

 Regarding the other main part of gross fixed 
capital formation, in the second quarter of 2009 

investment in construction in the euro area 

registered its smallest fall since the first quarter of 

2008, contracting by only 0.8%, with non-housing 

investment showing its second consecutive 

increase (0.3%). Housing investment, while still 
declining (-2%), registered a lower rate of 

contraction than in the past four quarters. 

Construction investment activity is expected to 

remain constrained by the ongoing adjustment of 

housing markets in several Member States, 

indicating that, unlike in previous upswings, this 

time little support can be 
expected from this side 
either.  
Moving on to the next main component of private 
domestic demand, household consumption is also 

expected to recover only gradually in this upturn. 

As illustrated in the previous section, private 

consumption proved to be a stabilising factor 

during this recession. In the EU, household 

consumption contracted by significantly less than 

GDP in both 2008Q4 and 2009Q1 (around -¾%), 

and broadly stabilised in the second quarter. The 

relative resilience of household consumption is 

explained by the strong deceleration in inflation 
Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  23 (down from an annual rate of 4.4% in August 2008 
to just 0.3% in September 2009) and support from 

nominal disposable income.  
In turn, the strength of nominal disposable income 
growth can be explained by several factors, 

including wage stickiness, lags in the response of 

employment to the slump in activity, policy 

measures such as the extension of short-term 

contracts as well as the positive impact of 

automatic stabilisers.

 Private consumption is exp
ected to contract this 
year by some 1¾% in the EU and 1% in the euro 

area, before stabilising next year in both areas and 

registering subdued growth in 2011 (about 1%). In 

addition to a weaker impulse than in past upturns 

from investment to employment and hence private 

consumption, there are at
 least two other factors 
restraining a sustainable, strong rebound in private 

consumption. One is the behaviour of the saving 

rate going forward. The eco
nomic crisis associated 
with the need for deleveraging of households' 

balance sheets has already led to an increase in the 
saving rate, by nearly 3 pps. in the EU (and by 

almost 2 pps. in the euro 
area) since the first half 
of 2008. If the adverse environment generated by 

the crisis persists, households may plan to increase 

their savings further, as data on expected savings 

from the EU consumer survey seem to suggest (see 

Box I.2.4 for more details). Another constraining 

factor relates back to the labour market. 

Notwithstanding some easing in the pace of the 

deterioration lately, as discussed in the next 

section, the usual lagged reaction to GDP 

developments indicates that labour market 

conditions are set to weaken further, with some 

stabilisation in the latter part of 2010 and in 2011. 
Finally, a further factor restraining the recovery is 
the estimated adverse impact of the financial crisis 

on potential output. As argued in a recent 

Commission services' study 
(18), potential growth 
rates may not recover to pr
e-crisis levels, in view, 
inter alia, of a permanent change in financing 

conditions following a shift in risk aversion and/or 

a sustained need for deleveraging. The impact of 

the ensuing slower capital accumulation may be 

reinforced by parts of the capital stock becoming 

obsolete even faster. This in turn would adversely 

affect total factor productivity (TFP) growth, as 

resources are then locked into relatively 

unproductive activities. These long-lasting effects 

on growth would come on top of the expected 

adverse impact from an ageing population. It is 

estimated that potential growth in the EU and euro 

area could be reduced considerably in 2009-2010, 

compared with 2008, to 
less than 1% and would 
only recover to 1% by 2011. 
–with labour market developments crucial Having started to weaken in the course of 2008, 

the labour market situation deteriorated further in 

2009, although by less than expected at the time of 

the spring forecast. By the first quarter, 

employment was falling in all Member States, a 

trend that continued into the second quarter in 

most of them; while the unemployment rate stood 

at 9.6% in the euro area and 9.1% in the EU in 

August, more than 2 percentage points above the 

lows of early 2008. Notwithstanding a certain 

improvement in economic prospects going 

forward, labour market conditions are expected to 

continue deteriorating in the second half of 2009

  24   Box I.1.4: 
The household saving rate in the current recovery
This box sheds some light on the main factors 
underpinning the projected saving rate 
developments that underlie the forecasts for private 
consumption.  
Households™ saving rates across the EU started to 
increase in the first half of 2008, in line with 

plunging sentiment. Since then, the household 
saving rate has risen by nearly 3 pps. in the EU 
(and by almost 2 pps. in the euro area); to stand at 

13¾% and 15½%, respectively, in the first quarter 
of 2009 (latest available data). These increases 
have largely mirrored the deterioration in overall 

consumer confidence and, particularly, consumer's 
assessment of unemployment prospects, which are 
currently well above their long-term average (by 

about two standard deviation).

 Looking forward, the autumn forecast assumes the 
household saving rate to remain at rather elevated 
levels over the forecast horizon (2009-2011), 

averaging around 15% in the EU (and almost 17% 
in the euro area). This represents an increase by 
some 2½ pps. compared to 2008 in the EU (and 

close to 2 pps. in the euro area), which, other things 
equal, will curb private consumption. There are a 
number of factors behind the projected increase in 

the household saving rate, including the cyclical 
deterioration in the labour market, the downward 
revision of long-term growth prospects, the impact 

of public finances and asset price corrections on 
saving behaviour. The variability in the household 
saving rates across Member States projected by the 

autumn forecast reflects, to a large extent, the 
differential impact of these factors.

%If households expect a decline in the discounted 
value of future labour income following, for 
instance, a downward revision of potential growth 
estimates as a result of the financial crisis, savings 

should increase and consumption 
accordingly drop. 
The expected significant deterioration of public 
finances may give rise to some Ricardian effects, 

whereby higher public deficits today lead to 
households' expectations of higher taxes in the 
future and should accordingly be met through 

higher savings. 
(1)
 Moreover, as argued in Box I.1.2 
and below, the ongoing process of deleveraging of 
household balance sheets is also expected to put 

upward pressure on the saving propensity of 
households. Given that the first two aspects are 
fairly well known, this box briefly elaborates on the 

third aspect, taking stock of recent analysis carried 
on in DG ECFIN 
(2) 
on balance sheet adjustment in 
the household sector and savings attitudes.  
Changes in asset prices may have important 
implications for households' consumption/saving 

decisions via the traditional wealth effects.  For 
instance, a rise in house prices may boost the 
consumption of house owners, who see their wealth 

and the value of their collateral increase. On the 
other hand, it may also force credit-constrained

Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  25 and into 2010, with a gradual stabilisation 
thereafter.  
Turning first to the outlook for employment, a 
contraction of around 2¼% is now foreseen in the 

euro area and EU in 2009, 
with a further decline of 
about 1¼% forecast for both areas in 2010. This 
represents an upward revision compared to the 

spring forecast (of approxi
mately ¼ pp. for each 
year), largely on account of the relative resilience 

of the labour market to the downturn to date. This, 

in turn, owes much to the implementation of short-

term policy measures,
(19)
 along with the impact of 
past labour market reforms and labour hoarding in 

some Member States. Evidence of the latter can be 

seen in the fairly limited increase in 
                                                          
 (19) The OECD has calculated employment multipliers which 
approximate the response of employment to a fiscal 

stimulus equivalent to 1% of GDP. The multiplier is 0.23 
on average, but varies across countries e.g. around 0.22 in 
Germany, 0.24 in Spain and 0.25 in France. Additional 

details can be found in OECD (2009) 'The Jobs Crisis: 
What are the implications for Employment and Social 
Policy Œ Further Material', OECD Publishing, Paris. 
unemployment (given the size of the output loss) 
but large decline in hours worked in several 

countries, for example Germany and the 

Netherlands; as well as in falling productivity, in 

terms of output per person. 
(20)
 Such a situation cannot, however, be sustained 
indefinitely. With capacity utilisation and 

employment expectations at low levels, and only a 

modest pick-up in demand projected in the near-

term, firms are set to increase labour shedding in 

the coming quarters. The extent of this is likely to 

vary across Member States, with more pronounced 

job losses expected in 
e.g. Germany than in 
countries where the bul
k of the projected 
adjustment has already oc
curred, namely Spain, 
Ireland and the Baltic States. Some unwinding of 

policy measures is also e
xpected in the course of 
2010.

Sustaining the Recovery', IMF Publication Services: 
Washington. 
Box (continued) 
 appears relatively small in the euro area, about 
 of 
the financial effect. A further important interaction 

between housing wealth and consumption is 
represented by the (negative) relationship between 
the saving rate and the mortgage-housing wealth 
ratio. The latter captures the extent to which credit-
constrained households need to save in order to pay 
for the share of acquired property value not covered 

by the mortgage. This 
credit constrain channel
 appears to be sizeable in the euro area and more 
important than the more traditional 
housing-wealth
 channel. 
(1)
 The estimation results point to higher saving rates 
going forward. Indeed, negative financial effects 
linked to past stock market losses (still down about 
35% from the last peak in the euro area) and the 
combination of (mortgage-related) debt overhang 
with housing-price corrections point to a further 
upward adjustment of the household saving ratio 

compared to the recent past, with potential adverse 
implications in terms of consumer spending.  
                                                          
 (1)
 A 1% decline in the financial wealth-disposable 
income ratio increases the saving rate by almost 
0.6%. A 1% decline in the housing wealth-disposable 
income ratio increases the saving rate by almost 
0.2%. A 1% decline in the mortgage-housing wealth 
ratio increases the saving rate by 0.4%. 
If the asset price shock proves to be long-lasting 
the impact ahead on saving/consumption patterns 

would be stronger. Moreover, credit constraints 
may reinforce savings further. If the financial crisis 
induces banks to adopt more restrictive practices in 
terms of loans for house purchases and, as a result, 
the fall in mortgages outpaces the drop in house 
prices (leading to a decline in the mortgage-

housing wealth ratio), the savings ratio will 
increase. The large contribution of the changes in 
the mortgage-to-housing wealth ratio to the drop in 

the savings ratio in the 
euro area in the 1990s 
suggests that the effect could be both large and 
persistent, pointing to an unusually moderate pick-

up of consumer spending in this recovery.

employment is forecast to gradually stabilise as the 

recovery in the euro ar

 2011. For the EU, a 
levelling out is expected in 2010, at around 10¼%. 

This outlook is somewhat less pessimistic than the 

spring forecast on account of the relative resilience 

shown so far, but also pa
rtly because of labour 
supply effects (e.g. 
discouraged workers). 
At Member State level, an increase in the 
unemployment rate is forecast for all countries 

between 2008 and 2011. Differences in terms of 

the scale of the projected increase are marked 

however, ranging from 1¼ pps. in Portugal to 9¼  

pps. in Spain and almost 12½  pps. in Lithuania.  
Looking beyond the forecast horizon, there is a 
risk that the high unemployment levels arising 

from the crisis will become persistent. As Graph 

I.1.5 shows, after a recession, the unemployment 

rate can remain above th
e pre-recession level for 
several years (though experiences differ across 

countries and downturns as discussed in Chapter 

1.2), with considerable economic and social 

consequences.

 Lastly, the unemployment rate in the euro area and

slack is to be expected, dampening wage and

Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  27 inflation last year, the disinflation has been 
remarkable, in the order of 4 pps. over four 

quarters in both regions. This has provided 

substantial support to household real disposable 

income in the downturn.  
The decline in the headline inflation rate has been 
driven mostly by the energy and food price 

components, which have continued on the marked 

disinflationary path that started in the second half 

of last year. In effect, 
energy prices have been 
declining at a two-digit p
ace since the spring in the 
euro area (-11% year-on-y
ear in September 2009, 
-8% in the EU). Disinflation in unprocessed food 

prices has been substantial, albeit much more 

subdued, with prices declining in the year to 

September 2009 (by -1.3% in the euro area and 

-0.5% in the EU). Reflecting the recessionary 

macroeconomic environment,
 underlying inflation 
pressure has also abated considerably. Core 

inflation (HICP inflatio
n excluding energy and 
unprocessed food) decreased from over 2% in the 

euro area at the end of last year to 1.1% in 

September 2009 (1.5% in the EU). The decline 

was mainly the result of an easing in services' 

inflation and, to a lesser 
extent, in processed food 
inflation.

 The effect of the sharp weakening in activity is 
particularly visible in producer-price inflation. It 

fell in the euro area from 
8.4% (y-o-y) in August 
2008 to -7.5% in August 2009, on the back of 

sharply decelerating prices
 for energy and food 
input products and strong base effects. However, 

the speed of the decline in industrial price inflation 

and its main components seems to have slowed in 

the last few months, suggesting an easing of 

downward price pressures. 
Turning to wage indicators in the euro area, the 
picture is somewhat mixed at the current juncture. 

The annual growth rate of hourly labour costs 

remained relatively high in the first and second 

quarters of 2009 (at 3.6% and 4.0% respectively). 

This partly follows from a less than proportional 

decrease in labour remuneration compared to the 

decline in hours worked. Conversely, the growth 

of nominal compensation per employee slowed 

from 1.8% in the first quarter to 1.6% in the 

second quarter (significantly lower than the 3.1% 

growth figure for 2008). Moreover, due to the 

sizeable decline in labour
 productivity per head, 
unit labour costs rose markedly to some 4.8% in 

the second quarter of the year. However, this partly 

cyclical upturn is set to reverse in the coming 

quarters, as the moderation in inflationary pressure 

from the labour market becomes apparent.

 Looking ahead, inflation in the EU and euro area is 
projected to rebound some
what from the current 
very low levels (temporary negative rates in the 

euro area), but to remain 
subdued over the forecast 
horizon. HICP inflation is
 estimated to average 1% 
this year in the EU and 0.3% in the euro area. It is 

projected to increase moderately over the forecast 

horizon, to somewhat above 1% in 2010 and 

around 1½% in 2011 in both areas. This outlook is 

consistent with the projected subdued recovery on 

the real side. In particular, it is supported by the 

large degree of slack in th
e economy, the expected  
weak wage growth going forward and well-

anchored inflation expectations. 
In terms of the quarterl
y profile, inflation is 
expected to have reached a trough in the third 

quarter of 2009, of 0.4% in the EU and -0.4% in 

the euro area, and to incr
ease gradually thereafter, 
but remain safely below 2%. The projected profile 

for inflation is shaped by two factors. On the one

Competitiveness divergence within the euro area could weigh on the recovery
Since the launch of the euro, the euro area has 
experienced significant divergence in the 
"external" economic performance of individual 
Member States. Although the euro-area's 
current account was broadly balanced in the 
past two decades, the dispersion of current-
account balances across euro-area Member 
States increased continuously between the mid-
1990s and the beginning of the crisis, when it 
was at the highest level in more than three 
decades (Figure 1). This current account 
divergence has gone hand in hand with 
significant divergence in price and cost 
competitiveness as measured by the real 
effective exchange rate (REER) (Figure 2).

 A large part of this divergence in the current 
accounts can be traced back to domestic 
demand. External factors such as fluctuations 
in oil prices and export performance have 
played only a second order role. There have 
been considerable and persistent differences in 
the strength of domestic demand across

reduced credit constraints and low real interes
trates on the back of comparatively hig

dfuelled current account deficits. Foreign capita
linflows have been mostly channelled by banks
into private consumption and the housin

also reflects the build up of significan

 Inflation expectations are indeed crucial for the 
inflation outlook. Consumer and producer inflation 

expectations derived from surveys (ESI and PMI) 

provide a direct measure 
of expected inflation, 
though they tend to be highly correlated with 

recent or contemporaneous observations and 

perceptions rather than being driven by forward-

looking rational expectatio
ns. These survey-based 
consumer and producer inflationary expectations 
have continued to ease since the spring, in 

response to the subdued economic outlook and the 

continued drops in actual inflation.  
Market-based expectations, on the other hand, 
provide information on inflation expectations in 

the medium to long-term. Amid a general increase 

in volatility since March 2008, these market-based 

inflation expectations (e.g. inflation index-linked 

bonds), appear to have "flirted" with a close to 

deflationary outlook at the turn of the year, but 

have rebounded to close to 2% since March. 
(23)
   This picture of well-anchored inflation 
expectations is confirmed by the most recent 

results of the ECB's Survey of Professional 

Forecasters (SPF for third quarter 2009). SPF 

participants expect infla
tion to reach a trough in 
the period from July to September and thereafter 

move back into positive territory, although 

remaining at levels below 2% in 2010 and 2011. 

Long-term inflation exp
ectations (for the year 
2014) also remain in line with the ECB's price 

stability objective, at close to but below 2%.  
                                                          
 (23) However, it must be borne in mind that such expectations 
are prone to fluctuations origin
ating in the financial market 
and, at the current juncture, they are distorted by 
unobservable risk and liquidity premia, which are not easy 
to disentangle.

 despite comparatively small differences in 
relative output gap positions. Country 

differences in price competitiveness also reflect 

a range of labour market problems, such as 

inappropriate wage responses to changes in 

productivity, excessive wage growth in the 
public sector or asymmetric responses of wages 
to the cycle.  

With the onset of the crisis, the rapidly 

worsening financing conditions as well as the 

negative confidence shock have led to a 

significant decline in domestic demand in all 

euro-area Member States. The demand shock 

has been particularly large in Member States 

with large current-account deficits and 

significant private sector indebtedness.  

This has led to an improvement in the trade 

balance via the import channel, as a large drop 

in domestic demand reduced imports more than 
the decline in exports. Conversely, the trade
shock has tended to be stronger in Membe
rStates with large current-account surpluses,
bringing their surpluses down via the expor
tchannel. Overall the crisis appears to hav
eworked to correct some of the current-accoun
timbalances within the euro area (Graph 1),

cyclical and thus temporary.

   30 Debt and deficits on the rise The economic and financial crisis is having a 
significant impact on government finances. While 

discretionary fiscal stimulus measures together 

with the working of automatic stabilisers have 

been key to stabilising the economy, the 

implications of both th
e recession and the current 
expansionary stance are expected to lead to a 

significant increase in budget deficits and public 

debts.  
The general government deficit in the EU is 
projected to rise from 2.3% of GDP in 2008 to 

almost 7% in 2009. In the 
euro area the increase is 
also sizeable, from 2% to 
just below 6½% of GDP. 
This is around 1 pp. above the projections of the 

spring forecast. Public deficits are expected to 

increase further in 2010, 
reaching 7½% in the EU 
and almost 7% in the euro area. The increase over 

these two years is therefor
e about 5 pps. in both 
areas. In 2010, all but one Member State 

(Bulgaria) are projected to have a government 

deficit in excess of the 3% of GDP reference value 

foreseen in the Treaty. Government deficits are, 

however, projected to eas
e somewhat in 2011, to 
some 7% in the EU and 6½% in the euro area. 
(24)
 The sharp increase in general government deficits 
in 2009-2010 results mainly from the following 

three developments. 
                                                          
 (24) Made on the basis of the usual no-policy-change 
assumption, these projections exclude any budgetary 

decisions that Member States may take but which are not 
yet sufficiently known and/or spelled out.

 Firstly, considerable discretionary measures have 
been announced and implemented. In line with the 

European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP), many 

Member States have adopted or announced 

significant fiscal stimulus packages to promote 

investment, support households' purchasing power, 

help enterprises and sustain labour markets. They 

have also announced structural reform measures 

aimed at supporting economic growth over the 

medium-to-long term. Taken together, the overall 

discretionary measures amount to 1.4% of GDP in 

2009 and 1.1% of GDP in 2010 in the EU (1.3% 

and 1.2% in the euro area).

  However, many of 
the countries most aff
ected by the crisis, 
particularly among the new Member States, have 

had very limited room to implement stimulus 

measures (and have often predominantly adopted 
                                                          
 (25) As mentioned earlier in the text, fiscal stimulus measures 
alone represent about ¾ of the overall discretionary 

measures in the EU (i.e. 1% of GDP in 2009 and 0.9% in 
2010). 
Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  31 consolidation measures with a view to avoiding a 
further fall-out from the crisis). 
(26)
  Secondly, automatic stabilisers are operating. In 
addition to the discretionary measures, the severe 

economic downturn is triggering strong declines in 

tax revenue and sharp increases in social security 

expenditure, notably unemployment benefits. The 

budgetary impact of these automatic stabilisers is 

estimated at roughly 2½ pps. of GDP over 2009-

10. 
Thirdly, over and above discretionary measures 
and the working of automatic stabilisers, revenues 

have displayed a significantly higher 

responsiveness (elasticity) to faltering economic 

activity in the current exceptional crisis than in 

"normal" cyclical downswings. 
(27)
   This could 
partly be linked to the composition of growth, with 

declining tax intensity (in particular, falling asset 

prices and corporate profits as well as a general 

shift in growth away from domestic demand 

components). Having started to decline in 2008, 

the revenue-to-GDP ratio in the EU is thus 

estimated to fall by a further 1¼ pp. in 2009 and ¼ 

pp. in 2010.  
Taking these three elements together, the 
expenditure ratio is projected to rise from nearly 

46¾% of GDP in 2008 to around 50½% in 2009 

and 2010 in the EU, while the revenue-to-GDP 

ratio is projected to decline from 44½% in 2008 to 

43½% in 2009 and to 43¼% in 2010 in the EU.  
The impact of the economic crisis on public 
finances varies across Member States. In countries 

with strong macroecono
mic imbalances and/or 
where the bursting of an asset bubble adds to the 

effect of the global down
turn (e.g. the UK), the 
                                                          
 (26) Apart from stimulus and structural reform measures, more 
than half of the EU Member States have undertaken 
consolidation measures. In total, these measures account 
for 0.3% of GDP in 2009 in both the EU and the euro area. 

In some countries, the consolidation measures outweigh the 
stimulus and structural measures taken, in particular in the 
Baltics and Romania, but also in Ireland and Greece. 
(27) The relative resilience of the re
venue ratio in 2009 in some 
countries (e.g. Germany) is partly explainable by the 
evolution of indirect taxes a
nd social contributions, which 
are projected to be held up 
by relatively resilient private 
consumption expenditure and 
compensation of employees, 
counterbalancing somewhat the strong fall in direct taxes. 
In countries with a strongly domestically driven downturn 

and/or reversal of an asset boom, such as Ireland, Spain or 
the UK, revenue ratios have been falling substantially, 
while in countries where the slowdown has been mainly 

triggered by the external sector, such as Germany, the re-
composition of tax bases towards tax-richer components 
has limited the impact on the revenue ratio. 
budgetary deterioration is more pronounced than in 
other countries. In some of these countries the 

increase in government deficits combined with low 

(nominal GDP) growth is set to give rise to a large 

increase in debt positions.

 The notable increase in deficits is contributing to 
the upward revision of government debt positions, 

compared to the spring 
forecast. However, the 
deterioration is also due to the rescue interventions 

in response to the financial crisis (bank 

recapitalisations, loans to pr
ivate enterprises, etc.). 
The impact of such opera
tions on the government 
debt is reflected in the so-called stock-flow 

adjustment, which is projected to be 0.6% of GDP 

in 2009 and 0.3% in 2010 (Table I.1.5).

well as the impact of real GDP growth and inflation on the debt ratio (through the 
denominator). The stock-flow adjustment includes differences in cash and accrual 

accounting, accumulation of financial assets and valuation and other residual effects. 
 In the EU, the gross debt ratio is now forecast to 
rise by almost 18 pps. between 2008 and 2010, to a 

level of close to 80% of 
GDP. In the euro area, 
gross debt is projected to rise even further to 84%

(28) (29)   1.3. UNCERTAINTY REMAINS HIGH 
While economic conditions and growth prospects 
have improved somewhat since the spring, the 

outlook for the EU economy remains highly 

uncertain and subject to non-negligible risks. 
On the downside, a lingering important concern is 
the possible intensification of the negative 

feedback loop between the real economy and the 

still relatively fragile financial sector. There are 

several channels through which this could happen. 

For instance, an increase in corporate bankruptcies 

or mortgage defaults, on the back of weaker than 

expected economic and labour market conditions, 

could hamper the process of bank balance sheet 

repair and lead to renewed credit tightening, thus 

reinforcing vulnerabilities in the real economy. 

Equally, a structurally 
weaker banking system 
owing to an incomplete cleansing of balance sheets 

could weaken the sustainability of the recovery. 
Headwinds on the domestic front pose a second 
downside risk to the growth outlook. In particular, 

deteriorating labour market conditions could 

constrain consumption to a greater extent than 

currently envisaged, even more so if the slack in 

the labour market were to result in lower wage 

growth than projected in the baseline. Moreover, in 

an environment characterised by uncertainty and 

rising unemployment, a 
further increase in the 
saving rate cannot be ruled out. As for investment, 
                                                          
 (28) On top of the stimulus measures, Member States have 
adopted numerous extra-budgetary measures (i.e. measures 

not affecting the general government balance) to support 
demand. These measures, such as loans and capital 
injections to the non-financial private sector or enhanced 

investment by public enterprise
s, are currently estimated at 
about ½% of GDP. Additionally, public money amounting 
to about 1¾% of EU GDP ha
s been injected into the 
financial sector in the form of recapitalisations. These 
measures affect government debt, but not the deficit. 
Moreover, guarantees to the financial sector of around 

24½% of EU GDP have been approved by the European 
Commission, of which around 8% of GDP has actually 
been granted so far. Impair
ed asset relief and liquidity 
support to the banking sector, similar in nature to 

guarantees, amount to around 4% of GDP (approved). 
Guarantees represent continge
nt liabilities which affect the 
government deficit (and debt) only once they are called 

upon. 
(29) For further analysis on debt developments in the EU see 
also chapter 1.3 in this report and European Commission 

(2009) 
Sustainability Report
, Directorate-General for 
Economic and Financial Affairs, European Economy 
(9/2009).     
the dampening effect of ongoing housing-market 
corrections in several Me
mber States and spare 
capacity could prove stronger than assumed, while 

the possibility of a permanently higher cost of 

capital is another negative factor. 
(30)
  In addition, 
the ending of a number of stimulus measures and 

the start of the consolidation phase could weigh on 

domestic demand more than expected at present. 

At the same time, the rela
tive strength of the euro 
may restrain export growth somewhat more than 

predicted. 
In terms of the external environment, rising oil and 
other commodity prices could mitigate the global 

recovery (31)
, as could a premature withdrawal of 
stimulus measures in key trading partners. 

Furthermore, growing social tension in light of 

high unemployment may trigger an increase in 

protectionist measures. 
(32)
   On the upside, the turning of the inventory cycle 
could have a more favourable impact than 

expected, while policy measures in the EU (and 

abroad) may prove more ef
fective than assumed to 
date in restoring the financial sector to health and 

boosting confidence among business and 

consumers. As a result, domestic demand could be 

stronger than projected. Added to this, a more 

pronounced pick-up in global demand poses an 

upside risk for export growth. The realisation of 

this risk would, in turn, support the export-

investment link which has been a defining feature 

of previous upswings, but is seen as less strong in 

this recovery.  
Overall, amid continuing
 sizeable uncertainty, 
risks to the EU growth outlook for 2009 and 

further out appear to be broadly balanced.  
Graph I.1.22 quantifies the various risks in terms 
of the possible deviation of output growth from the 

central forecast. It shows the impact that different 

combinations of risks could have on euro-area 

GDP growth, the outcomes being weighted by the 

probability of their occurrence. At a 90%

(31) An illustrative simulation using the QUEST model shows 
that a •10 increase in the price of oil could lower growth in 
the EU by 0.1 percentage point in the first and second 
years.

Euro area GDP forecasts: 
Uncertainty linked to the balance of risks
 Turning to the inflation outlook, risks appear to be 
largely balanced over the 
forecast horizon. Higher 
oil and other commodity prices pose an upside 

risk, whereas the remaining slack in the economy 

(i.e. the large output gap) should keep inflationary 

pressures subdued. As for the risk of a deflation 

scenario, this has subsided
 further over the course 
of the year, at least at the aggregate level. 
Looking beyond the forecast horizon and more 
towards the medium-term, a number of risks to the 

economy's growth prosp
ects on account of the 
crisis can be identifie
d. These include the 
possibility of a 'jobless' recovery and persistently 

high unemployment; unsustainable public 

finances; and, as discussed earlier, the risk that 

potential growth may not return to the pre-crisis 

level, in view, for example, of a permanent change 

in financing conditions following a shift in risk 

aversion and/or a sustained need for 

deleveraging. 
(33)
 1.4. ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AHEAD 
The outlook presented in 
this autumn forecast 
leaves authorities with formidable economic 

challenges ahead in order to secure a return to a 
                                                          
 (33) See also the references in footnote 4. 
balanced and sustainable growth path. The priority 
of these challenges may vary across Member 

States according to the pos
ition prior to the crisis, 
their fiscal room for manoeuvre, etc. These 

challenges are discussed w
ithin each of the country 
chapters. However, at least at the aggregate level 

four economic challenges stand out as the most 

urgent. 
Given the crucial role of the labour market for a 
sustained recovery to materialise, a first economic 

challenge is to halt the worsening of labour market 

conditions and to prevent a return to the significant 

degree of hysteresis experienced by Europe in the 

past. With substantial restructuring across some 

sectors also to be expected in some countries, part 

of the challenge will be to reduce skills-mismatch 

and facilitate the reintegration of displaced 

workers back into employment. 
The marked deterioration of public deficits and 
debt projected in this forecast points to a second 

key economic challenge: addressing the long-term 

sustainability of public finances. The importance 

of this challenge is raised further by the adverse 

implications of an ageing population. 
Given the depth of the recession, a third economic 
challenge relates to mitigating the adverse impact 

of the financial and economic crisis on potential 

growth. With financial markets still fragile, 

particularly the banking sector, this includes 

addressing the outstanding vulnerabilities in this 

sector, so as to reduce risk premia and hence the 

cost of capital going forward. 
Finally, there are also economic challenges related 
to adjustment within
 the euro area. The 
divergences which raised concern before the crisis 

are still present to a certain extent. While the crisis 

has triggered some adjustment, the remaining 

imbalances (e.g. persistent divergences in 

competitiveness positions) would need to be 

corrected in a more demanding domestic and 

external environment.

PROSPECTS    Graph I.2.1:

% 34 2.1. LABOUR MARKET PERFORMANCE 
In 2009, and after years of relatively good 
performance, the EU labour market is undergoing 

a pronounced slowdown with significant job losses 

occurring across many Member
 States and sectors.  
Against the background of
 a modest recovery in 
2010, the unemployment rate is expected to 

continue to climb, reachi
ng about 10½% in the EU 
by 2010 (about 11% in the euro area) and to 

remaining at this high level in 2011 (Graph I.2.1). 

Over the period 2008-2011, the most pronounced 
increase in unemployment is expected in the 
Baltics Estonia, Ireland and Spain. On current 

policies, employment in the EU and in the euro 

area is expected to fall in 2010 with a very 

moderate recovery (0.3%) in 2011 in the EU.  
Unemployment in the EU reached its lowest rate 
(6.7%) in a decade in the 
second quarter of 2008. 
Since then, and up to the 
second quarter of 2009, 
EU GDP has fallen by around 5%, while the 

jobless rate has increased by about 2 pps. 
(34)
                                                           
 (34) For the euro area, the lo
west unemployment rate was 
achieved in the first quarter of 2008; since then the 
While labour markets held up well last year, the adjustment started in earnest in the first half of 2009 
and unemployment had risen by over 2 pps. by the autumn. The responsiveness of unemployment to 

cyclical conditions appears to have increased in the r
ecent years, but in the current recession this has to 
some extent been masked by the use in some countrie
s of short term working schemes in the early phases 
of the crisis. On the contrary, in others there has been a huge contraction of employment owing to the 

need to reallocate resources away
 from low productive sectors.  
However, the true scale of the adjustment is still to be
 seen over the next two years. Unemployment is set 
to rise well into next year, reaching levels not seen
 for over a decade. Given the expected path of the 
labour force and demographic projections, the participation rate in 2009 and 2010 is set to decline 

slightly in the euro area and to re
main largely unchanged in the EU.  
The outlook for the EU economy remains highly un
certain. The unemployment rate could turn out 
higher if uncertainty prevails, sectoral restructuring is more significant than assumed and wages in 

countries and sectors particularly hard hit do not adjust. Past labour market reforms have been effective 

at strengthening the labour market attachment of vulnerable groups. Yet, an uncertain recovery would 

in all likelihood deal a blow to labour supply through discouraged worker effects. It is worth noting that 

historically, the unemployment rate in Europe has always taken more than 3 years to return to pre-

recession levels after recessions have ended. However
, labour market reforms enacted over the last 
decade have made European labour markets more flexible and resilient, implying that increases in 

unemployment could be less persistent than those seen after previous post-war recessions.  
Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  35 During the same period, the labour market lost 
more than 4 million jobs, of which more than two 

thirds in 2009. Almost three years of progress in 

bringing the unemployment rate down from 9% to 

6.7% was wiped out in a year and a half.  
To keep up with the growth of the population, the 
labour market would need
 to create about ½ and ¼ 
million jobs in 2009 and 2010 respectively, to 

avoid unemployment from increasing for a 

constant participation rate, while it is forecasted to 

lose about 4½ and 2¾ million respectively. So far, 

a reduction in the participation rate has been 

registered in only a few 
countries, namely Finland, 
Ireland, Italy and Portugal.  
Workers with "weaker" work contracts, less 
qualified and less experienced workers have borne 

much of the brunt of th
e current recession (Table 
I.2.1). Men tend to be overrepresented in these 

categories. Conversely, women have so far been 

less affected than men, because the crisis hit first 

and foremost sectors such as construction and 

manufacturing, where male employment is 

relatively high. Yet, female employment was in the 

first quarter of 2009 below the level of one year 

earlier Œ the first such fall since the fourth quarter 

of 2005. The unemployment rate for young people 

(15-24) jumped by 4 pps. in one year to 20%. 

Employment for the same group fell by 1 million 

(5% quarter-on-quarter) in the fourth quarter of 

2008, and by another million in the first quarter of 

2009. The fall in employment of prime age 

workers, limited in the fourth quarter of 2008, 

intensified in the first quarter of 2009 when about 

3 million jobs were lost.  
                                                                                  
 harmonised unemployment rate
 has risen to 9.6% in 
August 2009. 
At the onset of the crisis, the bulk of job losses was 
concentrated in just a few Member States (the 

Baltic States, Spain and Ireland), largely as a result 

of pre-existing weaknesses as well as a greater 

exposure to the direct consequences of the shocks. 

However, the crisis subsequently put a widespread 

brake on domestic demand across the whole of the 

EU at a time when external demand was fading, 

and employment started falling in all Member 

States. The unemployment rate increased 

everywhere, particularly in those countries which 

had already been strongly affected by the crisis in 

2008.  
The aggregate data conceal a rather heterogeneous 
adjustment to the global recession across Member 

States. Although, the labour
 market adjustment has 
so far been sizeable in Spain, Ireland, and the 

Baltic States, it has as yet been relatively limited in 

Italy and Germany. Yet 
the correlation between 
output growth and changes in unemployment is 

negative and significant in many Member States 

(Graph I.2.3). Moreover, for the EU as a whole it 

is stronger during the present recession than during 

the recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s, which 

suggest that today's labour market is far more 

flexible, although it could also be affected by the 

sheer size of the contraction in GDP.

  37 2.1.1. The role of labour hoarding in 
moderating the rise in unemployment 
A major feature during the early quarters of the 
recession was the fall in output growth, 

accompanied by an only limited fall in 

employment growth for the EU as a whole (Graph 

I.2.2). However, by the summer of 2009, the 

overall adjustment in unemployment rates had 

caught up with the average during past recessions.  
The importance of labour hoarding during the 
current recession is discussed below and can be 

illustrated by the fall in the average hours worked 

in countries where the increase in unemployment 

is relatively small while the fall in GDP is 

relatively large 
(35). For example, among countries 
with an output loss higher than the EU-27 average, 

the increase in unemploy
ment is lower than 
average in Germany and Italy, while hours worked 

declined proportionally more than employment 

growth. 
(36) Conversely, the average number of 
hours worked in
creased slightly in France and 
declined in Spain (Graph I.2.4), despite similar 

output losses in both countries - about 3% from the 

first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009. 
(37)
 "Okun's law" relates changes in unemployment to 
output growth. Assuming adjustments in labour 

supply are limited, estimates of Okun's law can, 

therefore, give some insight into the phenomenon 

of labour hoarding. This is done by comparing the 

actual changes in unemployment observed during 

the 2008/2009 recession qua
rters with the change 
implied by the historical relationship between 

output growth and unemployment changes (Graph 

I.2.5). 
(38)
 Evidence of strong labour hoarding 
compared to previous patte
rns is found for Finland, 
Austria, the Netherlands and Germany. On the

(36) During the current recession the average hours worked fell 
in Italy and Germany more than during past recent 

recessions. The opposite is observed for France. DG 
ECFIN (2009), "Labour Market and Wage Developments 
in 2008", European Economy, No 8. 
(37) The increase in the average 
hours worked in France may be 
due to the effect of the TEPA law, implemented in 2007, 
which introduced a tax break on overtime work and 

increased overtime premiums in firms with less than 20 

employees. More detailed information about recent reform 
of the working time organisa
tion in France can be found in 
the Country fiche on France in the report "Labour Market 

and wage developments in 2008", European Economy no.

other hand, the adjustment in Spain, Ireland, 
Greece and the Baltics is stronger than that 

suggested by historical patterns.  
In summary, the labour market response to the 
global slowdown has been rather heterogeneous 

across countries. This is partly due to the need to 

reallocate resources away from specific industries 

characterised by low productivity growth and/or 

overcapacity. In addition, recourse to flexible 

working time arrangements has also differed 

significantly across Member States. In many 

European countries, government sponsored 

schemes were already available or were introduced 

during the crisis to supplement the wages of 

workers working at reduced hours. The use of 

these schemes has varied across countries, which 

explains some of the differences in the labour 

market responses. 
Short-time schemes can be 
an effective instrument 
to contain wasteful labour shedding in the face of a 

temporary demand shock. This is less obvious if 

the recovery takes more time to materialise and/or 

companies face the need to
 restructure. In this 
situation adjustments in 
the workforce are required 
which could be hampered if schemes "freeze" 

employment patterns in the affected sectors and 

companies. To address this, Member States often 

impose strict conditionality for access to 

government support, but it is too early to tell to 

what extent this will help to avoid an increase in 

unemployment when the schemes expiry. In any 

event, the limited adjustment observed so far in 

some countries could imply significantly less 

hiring during the early y
ears of the recovery. The 
risk of jobless or job-low growth beyond the 

forecast horizon is potentially high in these 

countries. 
2.2. FACTORS DRIVING THE LABOUR MARKET 
OUTLOOK The severity of the recessi
on raises concerns about 
the labour market adjustment and its persistency. 

In particular, it is clear that employment will 

continue to be affected 
in the year ahead. Job 
losses may translate into longer spells of 

unemployment, which would lead to a 

deterioration of skills, contribute to the persistency 

of unemployment (hysteresis) and increase the 

likelihood of a fall in 
labour supply, ultimately 
translating into a higher natural rate of 

unemployment. A key question is how the labour 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  38 market will behave during the early stages of the 
recovery. This section discusses the potential risks 

to the labour market outlook. It reviews the 

explanations given for a delayed labour market 

recovery and looks at the ri
sks of jobless growth in 
Europe. The matching of vacant posts with the 

unemployed and the risk that high unemployment 

translates into high equilibrium unemployment is 

discussed subsequently. The final section examines 
the impact of the recessi
on on wages and labour 
costs. 2.2.1. Employment intensity of GDP growth: 
the risks of jobless recovery  
At the early stages of recoveries, when firms have 
limited information about demand, they tend to 

adjust productivity more than employment, which 

implies that employment responds with a time lag

pps.Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  39 to changes in output. When these lags are 
substantial, job creation remains insufficient to 

bring unemployment down for a prolonged period 

of time after the upturn, and the recovery turns out 

to be jobless. 
(39)
 Economists have given a number 
of explanations for jobless recoveries: 
• Employment lags the pickup in the economic 
growth as a consequence of labour hoarding 
during the preceding recession. As output falls 

firms do not fire their workers but hold on them 

for a time even if they are not fully utilised. 

Thus, when GDP increases, new workers are 

not hired until the existing ones are fully 

employed. Given the depth of the present 

recession, this effect could be significant.  
• Macroeconomic uncertainty can be considered 
as a stand-alone reason for low employment 
growth at the early stages of economic 

recoveries. The combined effect of a temporary 

pause of aggregate demand and heightened 

uncertainty may lead firms to postpone hiring, 

thus delaying the time at which employment 

starts growing again (Bloom, 2008 and Bloom 

et al, 2009).  
• Another view contends that a reduction in the 
utilisation of labour oc
curs after recessions 
which trigger a considerable degree of 

restructuring. Assuming that jobs are 

permanently destroyed in some sectors, 

aggregate employment growth depends on new 

positions being opened elsewhere. This is 

unlikely to happen without either a substantial 

reduction in real wages or a reduction in the 

uncertainty about the depth and duration of the 

slump. 
(40) Displaced workers are not 
necessarily suitable to fill new jobs and may 

exert little pressure on wages. As a 

consequence both the duration of 

unemployment and the NAIRU could increase. 

According to this interpretation, unemployment 
                                                          
 (39) In the US, during the rec
overy from the 2001 recession, 
employment grew more slowly than could have been 

explained by sluggish output
 growth alone. The gains in 
employment during the recovery were less than what 
observed for the average cycle and made the recovery 

jobless. Despite the employment growth of the second half 

of 2003, it was only in January 2004 that employment 
increased above the level recorded at the trough of the 
cycle. The total numbers of hours worked also resumed 

very slowly compared to previous recoveries. 
(40) The evidence on the structural shift hypothesis is mixed. 
See DG ECFIN, "Labour market and wage developments 

in 2004, with special focus on the risk of jobless growth", 
European Commission - European Economy- Special 
report, No 3/2005. 
is expected to start decreasing and employment 
increasing only when the recovery is set on a 

steady path.  
• According to a fourth explanation, a weak 
labour market may prevail after periods of long 
expansion during which firms delay internal 

restructuring until the recession arrives; high 

aggregate job destruction would occur as many 

firms go through a period of internal re-

organisation.  
• Finally, "just-in-time" employment practices 
allow firms to wait before opening new 
vacancies and hiring fu
ll-time workers until the 
signs of a robust recovery materialise in the 

forms of strong demand for their goods and 

services. 
(41)
  A further consideration concerning the current 
recession relates to the 
presence of an impaired 
financial sector. The 
empirical evidence on 
international banking crises shows that output 

losses that follow financial crises are highly 

persistent and accompanied by a persistent 

increase in unemployment 
(42) owing to: output 
losses; the disruption of the credit flows, which 

creates difficulty in fund
ing operating expenses; 
hiring freezes and delay in the sectoral 

reallocation. 
(43)
 In addition, since the self-
employed are more likely to be liquidity 

constrained, the financial crisis might reduce 

access to bank credit for potential new self-

employed workers, which may make moves from 

self-employment into unemployment or inactivity 

more prevalent than entries into the labour market. 
Implications for the European labour markets  Looking at previous recessions can give clues 

about the extent to which the current labour market 

adjustment is congruent w
ith the past experience. 
In previous recessions unemployment spiked 

quickly and did not fall back to its pre-recession

  40 level for several years (Graph I.2.6). In the 
recession of the early 1
990s, GDP contracted for 
about five quarters in Italy and the UK and two 

quarters in Germany and France. However, the 

unemployment rate only returned to pre-recession 

levels after more than 30 months following the 

onset of the recession in 
Italy and the UK and after 
about 20 months in France and Germany. During 

the recovery of the early 2000s, the behaviour of 

the labour market differs 
from that of the average 
cycle. (44) For example, the increase in output in 
Spain and Italy between 2003 and 2004 translated 

almost entirely into higher
 employment. In France, 
where one year after the trough the recovery was 

jobless, the increase in productivity was higher and 

the participation rate less responsive than in the 

average recovery. In the UK, employment 

continued to increase up to two quarters ahead of 

the trough of GDP and stagnated for the remaining 

part of the year. In Germany, the recovery seemed 

less atypical as the disappointing economic 

recovery was accompanied by modest employment 

growth. Finally, there is a striking contrast 

between the behaviour of unemployment in the US 

in the aftermath of the severe recessions of the 

early 1980s and 1981 and the one that followed the 

two most recent recessions in 1990-1991 and 2001, 

which has made many observers to qualify the last 

two recoveries as jobless.

area unemployment rate incr

between the second quar
ter of 2008 to second 
quarter of 2009, while GDP declined by about 5% 

over the same period. This means that each 

percentage point of decline in GDP has implied an 

increase in unemployment 
of about ½ pp. A key

question is to what extent the actual increase in 
unemployment fully reflects the decline in output 

observed so far. Comparison with past experiences 

is useful and the "Okun relationship" can be a tool 

to address these issues.  
Graph I.2.7 reports for different periods the 
coefficients of this rela
tionship for a number of 
selected EU countries. Current changes in 

unemployment are regressed on current output 

growth, past output growth (up to three lags) and 

past changes in unemployment. The main results 

are the following: 
• The coefficients of current output growth are 
higher than the coefficient of past output 
growth, but both are now larger than in the 

1990s. 
• In addition, the response of unemployment to 
output also depends on the persistence of the 

unemployment rate, which is due to mechanism 

that creates hysteresis. In the more recent 

decade this persistency fa
lls. This implies that 
for a given change in output growth there is 

now less carry-over of changes in 

unemployment rate.  
Thus, there is a change in the relationship between 
unemployment and output, which implies that the 

combined impact of the two effects on 

unemployment is stronger during the first 

quarters. 
(45)
 This suggests that past labour market 
                                                          
 (45) Direct evidence of this is c
onfirmed by the analysis of the 
interim multipliers. These findings differ from those for the 

United States, which give more 
support to the possibility of 
jobless recovery in this country in the more recent period 
(Knotek 2007).

Change in unemployment during the current recession, percentage points
Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  41 reforms have made unemployment more 
responsive to the cycle. 
(46)
  During the present recession
, this has partly been 
offset by the use of short-time schemes, which 

could mean that a recovery would lead to a 

somewhat delayed fall in unemployment; yet, over 

the medium term, the fall in unemployment could 

be stronger than in the past. Thus, without 

significant improvements in output growth, a 

substantial effect on unemployment may be 

expected. Yet the lower persistency of 

unemployment of the more recent period may 

suggest a faster adjust
ment as the economy 
rebounds. 
The extent to which recent
 labour market reforms 
have affected the relationship during the recession 

is unknown. To gain some insight, graph I.2.8 

reports Okun's coefficients estimated using the 

rolling regressions technique. 
(47) By looking at the 
change in the estimates over time, one can infer 

how the relationship changes over the business 

cycle. The graph plots th
e coefficients of GDP 
growth together with the number of recession 

quarters that are included in the sample. It suggests 

that there is an increasin
g effect of GDP growth on 
unemployment (at various lags) in the recent years. 

However, during the most
 recent quarters this 
effect diminishes which could be caused by the use 

of reduced working time during the crisis. 

Moreover, the effect of the contemporaneous GDP 

growth prevails on the effects of lagged GDP 

growth and increases during recessions. What is

characteristics and estimated impact".

Carone, G. and Curci, N. (2009). 
worrying is the fact that in the past the response of 
changes in unemployment to GDP growth has 

become smaller as the economy recovers Œ as is 

evident from the estimation ending in mid 1990s 

(see change in the coeffici
ents around 1995q1 in 
graph I.2.8).  
How does a W or V shape recovery influence 
unemployment and participation?  The reaction of the labour market during a 
recession influences its response during the 

recovery. In addition, the response of the labour 

market is also influenced by the timing and the 

shape of the recovery. If the initial recovery is 

tentative and lacks sustainability, employers will 

be reluctant to open new vacancies and hire 

workers. The shape of the cycle depends very 

much on the types of shock that caused the 

recession. In particular, recessions that take place 

together with a financial crisis, often caused by 

overoptimistic expectations of income growth, are 

followed by prolonged and uncertain recoveries 

(IMF, 2009, Knotek, 2009).

  42 In order to assess the behaviour of labour market 
aggregates in the aftermath of a recession, it can be 

of interest to inspect their evolution in the quarters 

following past recessions.
 Since recessions are not 
all alike, a distinction is made between W-shaped 

and V-shaped recoveries. W-shaped recovery are 

defined as episodes in which output growth 

resumes after a sharp contraction, for a few 

quarters only and returns again negative before the 

recovery takes hold. During V-shaped recoveries, 

output growth is steadily positive over the quarters 

that follow the trough. In the sample of EU-27 

countries it is possible to identify 25 recessions 
(48)
, excluding the current recession, 15 of which are 

W-shaped (table I.2.3). Graphs I.2.9a-I.2.9d report 

the average evolution of GDP growth, 

employment, the unemployment rate and the 

labour force for the 8 quarters that follow the first 

quarter after which the average W- or V-shaped 

recovery consolidates Œ i.e.
 after the trough of the 
V-shaped recovery and 
the second dip of a W-
shaped recovery. For all four variables difference 

compared to the end of the recession are provided. 
                                                          
 (48) Recessions are identified as at least two consecutive 
quarters in which output growth has been negative. Due to 
data limitation, the number of identified recessions 

underestimates the effective number. Only few countries 
have long time series for quart
erly data starting from the 
first quarter of 1980.

%Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  43 When the recovery is on a stable path, output 
growth follows a pattern which does not differ 

across the two types of recoveries Œ but of course it 

takes more time for W-shaped recoveries to reach 

this path. As expected, employment contracts more 

during W-shaped recoveries and remains below the 

trough level for longer time. In the V-shaped case, 

employment returns to the trough level after about 

2 years from the upswing. Unemployment rates 

keep growing during the first year after both W-

shape and V-shaped recoveries. Yet, 

unemployment continues to rise for a further two 

quarters in the case of the relatively faster and 

more solid V-shaped recovery. This finding 

suggests that during a solid recovery the 

perception of finding a job improves and more 

people enter into the labour market. Indeed, the 

fourth panel shows clearly that the labour force 

rises during V-shaped recoveries while it mainly 

hovers around the level which prevails at the early 

stage of a W-shaped recovery. Therefore, in W-

shaped recoveries exit fro
m the labour market, and 
the risks of seeing labour supply shrink, are more 

likely than in V-shaped recoveries.  
As described in the previous chapter, the outlook 
for the EU economy is cautiously more optimistic 
compared with the Spring
 forecast. Consistently 
with the historical experience described above, a 

more rapid recovery woul
d be accompanied by an 
increase in the unemployment rate, owing to the 

usual lags in the response of employment to output 

and the positive effect of brighter outlook on the 

labour supply.  
Sectoral reallocation and unemployment Structural imbalances should lead to substantial 

mobility of workers across different industries. In 

the current situation, the main sectors with 

structural imbalances are construction, finance and 

the automotive sector. As construction output 

returns to levels consistent with the replacement of 

the old housing stock and the growth in the 

population (i.e. the housing boom comes to an 

end), employment in construction and related 

financial services needs to come down. 
(49)
 An 
additional contraction in labour demand is 

expected as the excessive increase in real house 

prices peters out. The ti
me needed for reallocating

lead to an increase in the structural rate of 

unemployment. 
Graph I.2.10a-d display a measure of the sectoral 
reallocation for selected countries, the so called 

Lillien index. 
(50) For the largest euro area 
countries, this measure suggests only an occasional 

and mild sectoral reallocation during 

slowdowns/recessions, which contrasts with the 

more regular pattern observed in the US 
(51). In Italy and France, the dispersion of employment 

growth across sectors increases sharply during the 
                                                          
 (50) The index of reallocation is 
calculated as in Lilien (1982) 
as the weighted standard deviation of cross-sectoral 
employment growth rates using an industry breakdown in 6 
Industries. This broad classification may not capture 

reallocations within sectors. See also European 

Commission, 2009, "European Product Market Review Œ 
microeconomic challenges in the crisis and beyond", 
European Economy (forthcoming).  
(51) In the US, the dispersion of employment growth hovers 
around a level of 1.5% during expansions and doubling or 
tripling during recessions. Valletta and Cleary (2008)

recession of the early 1990s. During the shallow 
recession of 2003, it in
creased in Italy, as 
employment growth in manufacturing sector 

turned out negative while employment expanded 

strongly in services. The measure picks up the 

intense period of restructuring that followed the 

German reunification. Finally, in 2008 and 2009, 

the degree of sectoral rea
llocation increased in all 
countries except Italy. (52) Of course, this 
dispersion can increase as 
a result of shifts caused 
by normal business cycles (i.e. aggregate demand 

shocks) having differentiated impact across 

sectors. This implies that the positive correlation 

between the dispersion and the unemployment rate 

would be determined by aggregate demand shock 

rather than by structural 
change. Indirect evidence 
of the effect of the sectoral reallocation on the 

structural unemployment ra
te can be gained by 
comparing the result of a regression of respectively 

the unemployment rate and the NAIRU on the 

measure of sectoral reallocation (Lillien index). In

sectoral reallocation rises substantially include the Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Ireland, Lithuania, Netherlands, 
Slovenia, and Slovakia.

Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  45 the first case, an increase by 1 pp. in the dispersion 
of employment growth across sectors is 

accompanied by an increas
e in the unemployment 
rate of 0.6pp. The same regression, this time with 

the NAIRU as a measure of the structural rate of 

unemployment, gives a response of 0.1 pp. 
(53)
 Thus, looking ahead, the structural unemployment 

rate may increase in those countries where 

structural reallocation was already occurring in 

2008 and 2009. Compared to
 the effect on the total 
unemployment rate, this increase is relatively 

small.  
2.2.2. Matching process and sectoral 
reallocation: the risk of hysteresis 
One problem with the 
measure of sectoral 
reallocation is that employment dispersion may 

reflect both reallocation shocks and differences in 

industries' cyclical sensitivity and growth trends. 

In this case, it is difficult to distinguish true 

reallocations from differences across industries in 

the cyclical response of
 employment to aggregate 
fluctuations. 
(54)
 During a deep recession, the 
degree of sectoral reallocation can be very high. At 

the same time, the distribution of skills in the 

labour force is fixed in the very short run. As a 

result, the mismatch worsens significantly and the 

effectiveness of the matching process deteriorates.  
The Beveridge curve provid
es a way to distinguish 
structural changes (e.g. 
due sectoral shifts) from 
cyclical developments. It depicts the relationship 

between job vacancies and unemployment rates. 

Over the cycle this relationship exhibits negative 

co-movement, with high vacancies and low 

unemployment when the economy is growing and 

vice versa when it is contracting. This leads to 

shifts along the curve. Shifts of the curve - i.e. 

positive co-movements between vacancies and 

unemployment Œ reflect changes in the 

effectiveness of the matching process, possibly 

related to skill mismatches or sectoral imbalances. 
Graph I.2.11 shows the Beveridge curve for the 
euro area measured at quarterly frequencies over 

the period from first quarter of 1995 to the second 

quarter of 2009. Inspection of the data reveals two 

shifts of the curve leftward since the late 1990s. 

The first one coincides with the dot-com bubble of

the late 90s; the second can be identified after the 
2001 downturn. Both shifts are likely to have been 

caused by reforms that have made the functioning 

of the labour market more efficient. The 

improvements have been significant: 

unemployment rates are about 2-3 pps lower for a 

given level of vacancies 
than in the mid 1990s. 
These results are consistent with analysis carried 

out by the OECD which suggests that actual 

unemployment now has a smaller impact on 

structural unemployment than in the mid 1990s. 
(55)
 The behaviour of the data in the latest six quarters 
up to the second quarter of 2009, which include the 

current recession, should be interpreted with 

caution given the small number of observations 

available. However, so far it seems that we are 

observing changes along the curve rather than 

changes of the curve. Yet, it cannot be excluded 

that protracted sectoral shifts 
(56) may render the 
skills of some workers Œ particularly those 

formerly employed in industries with non-

transferable skills Œ ob
solete leading to skill 
mismatches.  
2.2.3. Labour supply: the risk of a shrinking 
workforce 
The massive unemployment inflows which a 
recession usually brings about can be harmful for 

the strength of the follo
wing recovery. When the 
large stock of new unemployed workers is not 

absorbed quickly as so
on as economic activity 
becomes sustainably anchored, labour supply may 

be negatively affected, which may result in an 

obstacle to a steady recovery. Newly unemployed 

workers may become long-term unemployed for 

many reasons. As a result of a recession, 

unemployed people become less effective in their 

search for a job, leading to more persistent 

unemployment. This may occur because the 

recession influences either the efficiency with 

which information about vacancies is transmitted 

or the time and effort the unemployed devote to 

the job search. In particular, a prolonged period of 

weak labour demand may reduce the search effort 

of the unemployed as discouragement arises after 

many not successful attempts of finding a job (the 
                                                          
 (55) OECD (2009) Economic Outlook No85, June 2009. 
(56) The sectoral shift hypothe
sis of unemployment rate 
suggested by Lilien (1982) can 
be explained by different 
factors including labour and capital market imperfections 
that limit the possibility of moving resources between 

sectors and imperfect matching due to the lack of the skills 
of displaced workers who have to fill positions in new 
expanding sectors. 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  46 so-called "discouraged" wo
rker effect). This can 
be also result from unconditional and extremely 

generous unemployment benefits which may 

create a moral hazard problem reinforcing the 

propensity of job-searcher to be highly selective 

with regard to job offers.  
At the same time, during recessions, households' 
income can be heavily affected by unemployment 

of the bread-winner (typically the man). This 

creates (the perceived ri
sk of) a negative wealth 
effect that induces other members of the household 

to put more effort into finding a job to compensate 

for the expected loss in household income and to 

smooth consumption. The "added" worker effect 

implies that in periods of high unemployment the 

labour supply of non-working spouse increases, as 

the consumption smoothing motive prevails on 

other factors, such as the low substitution of 

leisure time between the hu
sband and the wife (for 
cultural reasons or lack of
 childcare services), that 
keeps women out of the labour market. Whether 

the 'discouraged worker
' or the 'added worker' 
effect prevails in the recessions is an empirical 

question. Eichengreen and Hutton (1987) studied 

unemployment patterns in the US during the Great 

Depression and found that a married woman was 

more likely to work if her husband was 

unemployed than if he was employed. 
(57)  In the current recession, some signals of 
discouraged worker effects prevailing over added 

worker effects have started to emerge, albeit on a 

small scale. The increase in unemployment so far 

has been limited by a fall in the labour force for

two consecutive quarters (-0.3% in the fourth 
quarter of 2008 and -0.5% in the first quarter of 

2009). In 2009 and 2010, the activity rate is 

expected to decline slightly in the euro area and 

stagnate in the EU.  
While these findings could raise some concerns 
about the effects of the crisis on total labour 

supply, it must be kept in mind that reforms in 

many countries have strengthened the labour 

market attachment of most vulnerable groups. As a 

consequence, large reductions in the overall 

activity rate should not occur, implying that job 

losses are likely to be largely reflected in a higher 

unemployment rate. In addition, there is evidence 

that governments are not re
peating the mistakes of 
past recessions in which 
early retirement schemes 
were introduced to reduce unemployment by 

shrinking the size of the labour force.

%%Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  47 2.2.4. Wage developments 
A slack labour market is generally accompanied by 
reduced wage pressures. In the face of a prolonged 

period of weak demand, firms start to reduce their 

workforce. The resulting increase in the jobless 

rate, if not accompanied by a shrinking labour 

supply, puts downward pressure on wages, 

especially where the incr
ease in unemployment is 
sizeable. Even so, unit labo
ur costs increase as 
firms hoard labour during the recession (i.e. 

productivity growth declines) while wages are 

slow to react as they are not continuously 

negotiated. New negotiated wages incorporate the 

effects of the common aggregate demand shock as 

expired contracts are rene
gotiated. The capacity of 
wages to reflect changes in demand at the local 

and sectoral level is expected to influence the 

shape of the recovery, in particular in countries 

where competitiveness is a constraint for economic 

growth. Public wages can play an important role in 

signalling appropriate wage developments for the 

private sector.  
Graph I.2.12 shows the growth of nominal unit 
labour costs and of its components, compensation 

per employees and changes in labour productivity. 

Even though the compensation per employee has 

slowed since the end of 2008, the growth in the 

nominal unit labour costs rose as labour 

productivity was negatively affected by labour 

hoarding. The decline in compensation per 

employee has been so far almost entirely led by the 

fall in the wage drift. Looking ahead, the growth in 

unit labour costs in the EU and the Euro area is 

projected to be more moderate in 2009 and 

negative in 2010, as new negotiated wages 

incorporate the effect of the recession and 

productivity growth recovers.  
As the economy recovers, it will be important that 
relative wages adjust to respond to productivity 

differentials and demand patterns at the local level. 

This is of particular importance for those Member 

States that need to improve their competitive 

position. Given the considerable downward wage 

rigidity recorded in the past crises, reforms of the 

wage bargaining system in this respect will be 

essential in a number of cases.

 2.2.5. Summary and challenges ahead 
The global downturn is now strongly affecting EU 
labour markets. As discussed above, job losses are 

set to translate into rising unemployment across 

the EU as the full impact of output losses starts to 

be felt and labour hoarding is reduced. The 

analysis in this chapter, th
erefore, suggests that at 
the level of the EU as a whole "Okun's law" is very 

much alive; there are consid
erable risks of "jobless 
growth" in the years to come, despite the beneficial 

effect of the labour market reforms of the past 

decades. 
Moreover, the labour market response to the global 
slowdown varies considerably across Member 

States. This is partly due to differences in (i) the 

share of the most affected industries, (ii) pre-

existing weaknesses and (iii) the exposure to 

international trade. In addition, recourse to flexible 

working time arrangements has also differed 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  48 significantly across Member States. In many 
European countries, government sponsored 

schemes were already available or were introduced 

during the crisis to supplement wages of those 

working at reduced hours. The use of these 

schemes has varied across countries, which 

explains some of the differences in the labour 

market responses. 
The significant fall in the 
average hours worked in 
countries where the increas
e in unemployment is 
relatively small suggests that these countries have 

contained the effect of the fall in GDP by resorting 

to substantial labour hoarding. Evidence of strong 

labour hoarding compared to previous patterns is 

found for Finland, Austria, the Netherlands, and 

Germany. On the other hand, the adjustment in 

Spain, Ireland, and the Baltics is stronger than 

what historical patterns would suggest. 
Labour hoarding has often been induced by 
government policies. Short-time schemes can be 

an effective instrument to contain wasteful labour 

shedding in the face of a temporary demand shock. 

However, if these schemes delay transitions by 

protecting employment in structurally shrinking 

sectors, then an increas
e in unemployment upon 
their expiry will occur. While these schemes have 

often been successful in the short-run, the jury is 

still out on the medium term implications.  
Sectoral imbalances and the industrial 
restructuring that this deep recession may trigger 

could require a substantial mobility of workers 

across different industries. Past labour market 

reforms have improved the matching of European 

labour markets, but the question is whether this 

will hold if sectoral restructuring becomes 

significant. The time needed
 to reallocate workers 
from these sectors to other sectors may lead to an 

increase in the struct
ural unemployment as 
workers need time to be retrained Œ particularly 

those formerly employed in industries with non-

transferable skills. A deterioration of the matching 

process would enhance the risk of unemployment 

hysteresis.  The analysis presented in this chapter suggests that 
the impact on unemployment can be sizeable, but 

less persistent than experienced after the recession 

of the early 1990s. Consistently with findings 

suggesting that hysteresis
 effects are now less 
important on account of previous labour market 

reforms than in the 1990s, this would suggest that 

after the absorption of unused labour resources by 
firms, unemployment should come down as 
growth resumes in a durable basis.  
Even so, as underlined in the previous chapter, the 
outlook for the EU economy remains highly 

uncertain and subject to significant risks. In 

particular, the historical ex
perience suggests that in 
W-shaped recoveries employment losses are more 

persistent, which leads to more discouragement 

(people leaving the labour market and becoming 

inactive) than V-shaped recoveries. Interestingly, 

these discouragement effects have been so strong 

in the past that historically the unemployment rate 

rises more strongly during V-shaped than W-

shaped recoveries.  
In the current recession, some signals of 
discouraged worker effects have started to emerge. 

This raises concern about 
the effects of the crisis 
on total labour supply. However, it must be kept in 

mind that reforms in many countries have 

strengthened the labour ma
rket attachment of most 
vulnerable groups. As a consequence, a large 

reduction in the overall activity rate is less likely 

now than it was in the past Œ although careful 

monitoring will be required.  
The shape of the recovery will also be influenced 
by the capacity of wages to reflect changes in 

demand at the local and sectoral level, in particular 

in countries where competitiveness weaknesses 

weigh on economic activity and employment. 

Public sector wages can play an important role in 

signalling appropriate wage developments for the 

private sector. Wage flexibility can, therefore, 

mitigate the rise in unemployment, particularly in 

hard hit industries and Member States. 
In summary, the labour ma
rket prospects in the EU 
will depend critically not only on the nature of the 

recovery and the extent of
 sectoral restructuring, 
but also on the degree to which hysteresis and 

discouragement effects can be avoided and wages 

can adapt. This, in turn, depends on the 

implementation of reforms which are foreseen 

under the EU's flexicurity agenda and which can 

contribute significantly to addressing these 

challenges. These are likely to be of particular 

importance as the recovery becomes sustainably 

anchored and short-term labour market measures 

are gradually phased out. 
These policy challenges should be seen against the 
background of other key elements of the 

"flexicurity" agenda, notably the objective of 
Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  49 rebalancing employment protection legislation in 
parallel with ambitious activation measures, along 

with reforms of the tax and benefit systems that 

reduce benefit dependency by making work more 

economically attractive an
d rewarding. Moreover, 
as our societies will continue to age and, without 

action, the European labour force will begin to 

shrink 
(59)
, many recognise the need of increasing 
the effective retirement age.  
The implementation of such measures will 
necessarily take place ove
r a prolonged period of 
time, but decisions taken early will help to anchor 

expectations and underpin the recovery. Increasing 

participation and enhancing workers' 

employability would contribute to minimising the 

social consequences of the crisis, preserving 

European human capital and, ultimately, to return 

to strong growth.

3. GOVERNMENT DEBT: PAST AND FUTURE 
CHALLENGES    50 The 58¾% of GDP that the government gross debt 
ratio in the EU reached 
in 2007 set what will 
remain a low for several years to come. On 

average, government debt ratios in 2007 were the 

lowest since 1992. However, the debt ratio started 

increasing in the vast majority of Member States 

already in 2008, when 
the global economic and 
financial crisis intensified. In the Commission™s 

autumn 2009 for
ecast, the government debt ratio is 
estimated to have soared in all EU countries in 

2009, by 11½ pps. on average, to 73% of GDP (see 

Table I.3.3). The forecast 
projects the debt-to-GDP 
ratio to increase by further 6¼ pps. in the EU in 

2010 and, based on a no-policy-change 

assumption, to continue rising by 4½ pps. in 2011, 

to 83¾%. A slightly lower increase in the debt 

ratio is projected in the eu
ro area. From the higher 
level of 69¼% of GDP in 2008, in the euro area 

the debt ratio is expected to have risen by 9 pps. of 

GDP in 2009 and is projected to continue to 

increase by 5¾ pps. and 4¼ pps. in 2010 and 2011 

respectively, to reach 88¼% of GDP.  
The 11½ pps. surge project
ed in the debt-to-GDP 
in the EU in 2009 is the biggest one-year aggregate 

increase ever seen in peacetime. The overall 25 
pps. rise projected in the EU by 2011 compared to 
its pre-crisis level (i.e. in 2007) is also 

unprecedented. Not only 
does it by far exceed the 
four-year increases recorded in the aftermath of the 

1974-75 and 1992-93 recessions; it is also higher 

than the progressive rise which occurred in the 

EU-15 debt ratio in the seven years between 1989 

and 1996, when the effects of the generalised 

1992-93 recession combined with the implications 

of the financial crisis in Sweden and Finland and 

German reunification.  
This chapter puts the pr
ojected increase in gross 
government debt-to-GDP ratios in a historical 

perspective. The first section briefly reviews the 

effect of debt on economic activity, while the 

second section analyses the dynamics of 

debt-to-GDP ratios in the EU since the 1970s.
(60)
 The analysis is based on the customary breakdown 

of debt dynamics into their main drivers, namely: 

(i) the primary balance; (ii) the snowball effect, in 
                                                          
 (60) Due to data constraints, from 1978 to 1996, the focus is on 
the EU-15 aggregate. For the 1970-1977 period the 

analysis is further limited to an EU-11 aggregate (Belgium, 
West Germany, Ireland Greece, Spain, Italy, Luxembourg, 
Austria, Finland, Sweden and United Kingdom). 
Rising government deficits, low economic growth and support to the financial sector are leaving a 
legacy of rapidly growing government debt ratios. While direct fiscal costs stemming from the outlays 

made to support countries' financial sectors have 
been, on average, relatively limited up to now, the 
global economic and financial crisis is taking its 
toll on debt developments via its impact on fiscal 
balances and low growth. After increasing by around 3 pps. in 2008, the debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated 

to rise by further 11½  pps. in the EU in 2009, to 73%. It is projected to continue increasing in 2010 

and, based on a no-policy-change assumption, to reach 83¾% in 2011.  
By historical standards, the projected sharp increase in government debt ratios is nothing out of the 
ordinary in a financial crisis. However, past episode
s occurred only at the na
tional or regional level, 
thus having a significantly lower impact on the overall supply of sovereign debt instruments. 

Furthermore, today's rise in debt comes on top of comparatively high starting points, reflecting the 

increase recorded in the 1980s which was only partially subsequently stemmed. Rising government debt 

ratios may harm growth prospects through reduced capital accumulation, i.e. via a crowding out 

private investment. Additionally, a high level of debt
 may raise concerns over its sustainability, with 
possible feedback loops through risk premia.  
A phasing out of the stimulus measures and cyclical recovery, including a rebound in tax revenue from 
the crisis-related lows, will be insu
fficient to prevent government debt ra
tios rising to even higher levels 
before the end of the next decade. Mechanical projec
tions for the debt ratios up to 2020 based on an 
unchanged-policy assumption suggest that a significant adjustment (in many cases well beyond the 

benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum) will be needed to halt and eventually reverse the increase in 

debt.  
Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  51 turn split into interest expenditure, the impact of 
real GDP growth and inflation; and (iii) the stock-

flow adjustment, i.e. the discrepancy between the 

change in government debt and the budget balance, 

which, in turn, reflects the accumulation of 

financial assets, differences between cash and 

accrual accounting, changes in the value of debt 

denominated in foreign currency and remaining 

statistical adjustments.
(61) Section 3 considers how 
government debt ratios were affected by past 

economic and financial crises. Section 4 focuses 

on debt developments during the current crisis. 

The fifth section presents
 mechanical projections 
for the debt ratios up to 2020 based on an 

unchanged-policy assumption, while the final 

section presents the challenges for the coming 

years.  3.1. ECONOMICS OF HIGH GOVERNMENT 
DEBT An essential issue linked to rising debt ratios 
relates to their sustainability. The widening of 

spreads on government bond
 yields in the euro 
area, both for countries with already high debt 

ratios as well as for countries with a sizeable 

increase in contingent liabilities linked to measures 

in support of their banking sectors, suggests that 

market perception of sustainability risks has 

changed. In particular, markets assess 

governments™ capacity to carry debt based on a 

forward-looking perspective, i.e. on their ability to 

generate future primary surpluses and on 

prevailing views about future potential growth and 

real interest rates.
(62) Thus, while a one-off increase 
in the stock of government debt need not put 

sustainability at risk, fundamental concerns arise 

from the structural nature of the high deficit levels. 

The global economic and financial crisis can be 

expected to have a negative impact on potential 

output, which overlaps with the slowdown in 

potential GDP growth and the rise in government 
                                                          
 (61) The change in the debt ratio 
is thus decomposed as follows: 
      
tttttttttttttYSFyyiYDYPDYDYD++−+=−−−−−1*1111        where t is a time subscript; D, PD, Y and SF are the stock 
of government debt, the primar
y deficit, nominal GDP and 
the stock-flow adjustment respectively, and i and y 
represent the average cost of debt and nominal GDP 
growth. The term in parenthesis is the snowball effect. This 

formula is the base of the decomposition of debt dynamics 
presented in Graph I.3.2, and Tables I.3.2 and I.3.3.

expenditure already expect
ed in the EU on account 
of population ageing.  
Even when sustainable, a large stock of 
government debt affects the economy and policy 

making. The issue of the effects of public debt on 

economic growth has been intensely debated, with 

no straightforward conclusion.
(63)
 On the one hand, 
according to the Ricardian 
equivalence hypothesis, government debt does not affect real allocations. 

Rational agents perceive that rising debt implies 

future taxation and correspondingly increase their 

saving. On the other hand, such debt neutrality 

holds only if a number of highly unrealistic 

conditions are met.  
If debt neutrality does not apply, the main reason 
why the build-up of government debt may affect 

potential output is the reduction in capital 

accumulation. Public debt competes with private 

debt for the allocation of savings. To the extent 

that public debt is used to finance productive 

government expenditure and the availability of 

debt instruments that combine high liquidity with 

low risk could result in higher savings, this need 

not result in lowering
 capital accumulation. 
(64)
 However, if persistent deficits increase the share of 

debt in GDP over time, the newly issued bonds can 

only, ceteris paribus, be absorbed by the markets if 

they yield higher real returns, with a consequent 

crowding out of private investment. Moreover high 

debt may further dampen growth through the 

increase in the tax burden needed to ensure 

sustainability and the associated efficiency losses 

(unless matched by economy-wide efficiency gains 

stemming form the expenditure side). 
Econometric evidence regarding the impact of 
fiscal variables on interest rates is not conclusive. 

However, several studies find significant

permanent budget deficits and

  52 effects.(65)
 Overall, empirical findings for EU 
countries are consistent w
ith the expectation that 
persistent budget deficits may compromise income 

prospects via the crowding out of private 

investment. In particular, they show that countries 

with a low government debt-to-GDP ratio also had 

a significantly higher contribution of capital to 

growth.
(66)
 Empirical evidence also points to a non-
linear relationship between public finances and 

national savings. Namely, households tend to 

increase precautionary savings when debt reaches 

very high levels (of the order of 100% of GDP).
(67)
  The high degree of capital mobility normally 
implies that an increased
 supply of government 
bonds in one country can be absorbed by 

foreign/global savings, with no need or little 

change in the interest rate, depending on the size of 

the country concerned. However, in a context of a 
generalised soaring of public debt, the global 

increase in supply of sovereign bonds is sizeable, 

increasing competition for the allocation of global 

savings. Furthermore, a combination of high global 

risk aversion and a perception of low sovereign 

default risk despite public debt ratios ratcheting up 

can result in intensified crowding out of corporate 

sector investment, even in the face of low 

sovereign yield.  
As evidenced during the current crisis, a high level 
of debt can also reduce a country™s ability to deal 

with shocks to interest rates or growth rates, even 

if those are temporary. With the cost of servicing 

the debt increasing with the level of debt, a shock 

to the cost of servicing has the potential to be 

significant for countries with a higher stock of debt 

to re-finance. However, th
e effect of increasing the 
debt servicing costs and th
e consequent increase in 
the interest burden faced by a government issuing 

(and/or re-financing) debt can also play a 

disciplinary role. In particular, once the financial 

markets signal a decreased willingness to take on a 

government™s debt by requiring higher interest 

rates in return, this can exert pressure on 

governments to contain further fiscal deficits. By 

setting out credible plans to stop and reverse the 

increase in their debt levels, governments can try

to reduce the perceived sovereign risk. Once debt 
reaches a certain high level, such actions may 

become necessary to cont
ain the ‚snowball effect™, 
i.e. the self-reinforcing effect of public debt 

accumulation arising from 
a positive differential 
between the implicit interest rate on public debt 

and the GDP growth rate.
(68)
 That is why the 
economy can be expected to react to debt 

accumulation and authorities to take measures well 

before debt ratios reach the levels in the medium-

term term projection presented in the last section. 
Reflecting a prudential appr
oach towards the effect 
of accumulation, the Treaty 
of Maastricht (Article 
104 and annexed Protocol on the excessive deficit 

procedure) sets a reference value for debt at 60% 

of GDP in the context of the excessive deficit 

procedure.   
3.2. DEBT DYNAMICS IN HISTORICAL 
PERSPECTIVE By historical standards th
e expected sharp increase 
in government debt ratios is typical for a financial 

crisis episode. However, it adds to debt ratios 

already relatively high in several Member States 

and the unfavourable prospects due to population 

ageing. Some Member States have already experienced 
debt ratios well above 100% of GDP and managed 

to reduce it substantially. In particular, in 2007 the 

debt-to-GDP ratio in Ireland was around 90 pps. 

lower than the peak of more than 110% reached in 

the late 1980s. In Belgium, it had progressively 

declined by 50 pps. from more that 130% in the 

early 1990s. 
Even the debt ratios above 150% of GDP that, 
based on unchanged policy, have been 

mechanically projected for 
a few Member States in 
the medium term are not historically 

unprecedented in indust
rialised countries.
(69)
                                                           
 (68) The snowball effect can also go in the opposite direction, 
i.e. reduce the debt ratio 
if GDP growth exceeds the 
implicit interest rate.

Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  53 The case of the United Ki
ngdom is particularly 
striking. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the debt 

ratio in the United Kingdom peaked at 185% of 

GDP in 1822, but was reduced to 30% by 1914. As 

a result of a generalised rise in government debt 

occurred during WWI, in 1920s debt ratios were 

well above 100% of GDP in several European 

countries.
(70)
 Some of them inflated a substantial 
part of their debt away. Conversely, in the 1920s 

the United Kingdom succeeded in curbing the 

growth of the debt ratio against a background of 

low growth and deflation. However, it did not 

manage to reduce it. In the late 1930s, the 

government debt-to-GDP ratio in the United 

Kingdom was still at around 150% and peaked at 

300% following WWII. It was steadily reduced 

afterwards and reached a 
low of around 33% of 
GDP in 1990.  
The prolonged period of high nominal growth in 
the 1950s and 1960s brought down debt ratios all 

over the EU. By 1970, the debt-to-GDP ratio for 

an EU-11 aggregate was 
less than 40% of GDP. 
(71)
 Prudent fiscal policies also played a role in this 

decline. A trend growth in government size linked 

to the development of the 
welfare state had led to a 
progressive rise in the share of government 

expenditure and revenue in GDP since as far back

as the 1930s. However, with the exception of the 
war period, it is only in 
the 1970s that sizeable and 
persistent deficit spending started. Some analysts 

remarked that wrong expectations on future 

economic developments could have contributed to 

such behaviour.  Expenditure that seemed to be 

affordable given the high growth in the previous 

two decades ceased to be so when productivity 

growth slowed in the 1970s.
 (72) Graph I.3.1 shows 
that primary balances switched from positive to 

negative in the mid-1970s, in the aftermath of the 

first oil crisis, and turned positive again only in the 

mid-1980s. Over the same period, potential output 

growth gradually declined.  
Despite the negative developments in primary 
balances, in the second half of the 1970s the 

increase in the debt-to-GDP ratios was kept in 

check by the still relatively high, if volatile, real 

GDP growth and unpreced
entedly high peacetime 
inflation. The unexpected inflation also resulted in 

negative real interest rates (see Graph I.3.1). 
Rising debt ratios became the norm in the 1980s 
when inflation expectations became entrenched 

and real interest rates increased above real GDP 

growth. The resulting snowball effect would have 

required appropriate primary surpluses to avoid 

increasing debt ratios. However, on average the 

adjustment started only in the mid-1980s, with 

some Member States delaying it until the end of 

the decade. The debt also rose progressively to

Ireland, Italy and Greece.  
Following the recession of 1991-93, consistently 
high primary balances offset a significant debt-

increasing snowball effect. After peaking at 71½% 

of GDP in 1996, the aver
age debt ratio declined 
progressively to 61½% in 2002. Combined with 

the substantial fall in interest rates that 

characterised the run-up to
 the euro, the decline in 
the level of debt also implied a substantial 

reduction of interest expenditure. The contribution 

of inflation to the reduction of debt ratios was 

considerably lower in the 1990s than in previous 

years (see Graph I.3.2).  
With primary balances on
 a declining path since 
2000, the debt ratios started increasing again in 

2003. Only in 2006 and 2007, when the output gap 

was largely positive, did the primary surpluses 

reach a sufficiently high level to trigger a renewed 

decrease in the average debt ratio. However, the 

scenario changed dramati
cally in 2008, when the 
effects of the financial and economic crisis 

described in the following section started to 

appear, including a sizeable stock-flow adjustment 

due to bank rescue operations.  
The build-up in debt which occurred in many EU 
Member States did not take place exclusively in 
periods of economic slowdown.
(73)
 During the 
cyclical upturns in 1978-91, debt-to-GDP ratios 

continued to increase (see Graph I.3.3). A partial 

improvement in this respect was achieved in 

subsequent years. The debt ratio decreased by 

around 10 pps between 1996 and 2007.  This was 

due to both the marked consolidation which 

occurred in the 1990s on the back of the negative 

cyclical conditions, and the reduction of debt 

during the ensuing cyclical
 upturns. However, that 
reduction was fundamentally supported by a 

decline in interest expenditure (see Graph I.3.2), 

which masked a loosening 
of the fiscal stance.  
3.3. GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENTS DURING

public finances. Although no two crises are alike 

in terms of their severity and the global

place, past experience can give us valuable

(74) Financial crises typically have both direct and 
indirect fiscal costs. Dir
ect fiscal costs result from 
the outlays made to support countries' financial 

sectors and (to the extent that they are not 

subsequently recovered) lead to permanent 

reductions to governments' net worth. These costs 

correspond to in
creases in the government's debt 
position, and consist mainly of capital injections, 

purchases of bank assets, payments to depositors 

and guarantees that are called in, as well as 

subsidies. As the financial crisis eases, some of the 

outlays may be recovered or some dividend 

payments or profits may flow into the government 

accounts making the final ne
t costs lower than the 
initial gross ones. 
Indirect fiscal costs are 
also typically significant Œ 
often more so than direct 
costs Œ and correspond to 
the deterioration in the public finances from the 

impact of the financial crisis on economic activity 

and the tax bases. The first component reflects the 

working of automatic stabilisers, i.e. budgetary 

arrangements which produce a stabilising effect 

without the explicit intervention of policy makers. 

In times of economic difficulty, the deficit rises 

through increases in cycli
cal spending (such as on 
unemployment benefits) and, more significantly, 
                                                          
 (74) This section draws heavily on part III of European 
Commission (2009a), 
Public Finances in EMU Œ 2009
, European Economy 5/2009, European Commission, 
Brussels. the fact that most governm
ent expenditure tends to 
be fixed in the short run, leading to rising shares of 

government spending in GDP in a recession, while 

revenues tend to follow economic developments. 

Further effects on the public finances can arise 

from changes in the composition of economic 

activity and strong falls in asset prices and 

reductions in profits. These effects tend to be 

greater than those that
 normally occur in the 
absence of a financial side to the crisis. Economic 

stimulus measures introduc
ed to prop up aggregate 
output also contribute to the indirect costs of the 

crisis and therefore to debt levels. There is also a 

possible contribution from market reactions which 

can push up interest rates or premiums charged as 

debt and/or perceived risks linked to the public 

finance position increase, while a deterioration in 

the exchange rate can also add to these costs.

costs, as estimated for 49 financial crisis 

episodes.(75)

faced great difficulties repaying contracts on time, 

experienced a large number of defaults, non-performing

capital was exhausted. The 49 episodes whose effects are

  56 fiscal costs corresponding to countries propping up 
their banking systems were substantial, averaging 

13% of GDP. However, at 5½% of GDP on 

average, systemic banking crises were somewhat 

less expensive in the transition and mature 

economies of today's EU. This is a net figure and 

includes the funds recovered. Across all crisis 

episodes, on average, less 
than one fifth of the 
initial gross outlays were recovered. A notable 

exception among EU countries is Sweden, where 

the quick and comprehensive restructuring of the 

banking system allowed the initial fiscal outlays of 

3.6% of GDP to be nearly fully recovered after the 

economic and financial crisis of the early 1990s.  
The data presented above relate to the direct costs 
of crises; more comprehensive measures are 

necessary to look at the impact on deficits and 

debt. Graph I.3.4 shows the deterioration in debt 

seen in previous crisis ep
isodes. On average, debt 
increased by 18 pps. of 
GDP from the year before 
the crisis to the end of the crisis, with significant 

differences across countrie
s. What is universally 
true and has implications for the current crisis is 

that none of the country groups analysed saw debt 

return to its pre-crisis le
vel even 8 years after the 
onset of the financial crises. Such crises clearly 

have long-lasting effects on debt. 
                                                                                  
 detailed information on policies both during and after the 
crises is available. 
3.4. GOVERNMENT DEBT DEVELOPMENTS IN 
THE CURRENT CRISIS Just as might be expected on the basis of past 
evidence, the current financial and economic crisis 

is leading to a steep increase in debt ratios. This 

reflects the central role pl
ayed by public finances 
in the EU in overcoming the crisis. Public finances 

are shouldering the burden
 needed to restore the 
health of the financial sector and supporting the 

intermediation function of financial markets. 

Furthermore, due to the depth of the recession and 

credit constraints, public finances have been called 

on to address demand shortfalls in the short run 

through fiscal stimulus measures and letting 

automatic stabilisers play.  
Only a limited part of the projected rise in debt is 
due to direct costs. In 2008, the stock-flow 

adjustment, which includes inter alia the 

acquisition of financial assets, accounted on 

average for 3¼ pps. of 
the increase in Member 
States' debt-to-GDP ratios. And over 2009-11 the 

stock-flow adjustment is projected to add a further 

1 pp. of GDP on average to the debt ratios (see 

Table I.3.3), taking account only of operations for

  Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  57 I.3.1. In contrast, the projections for the overall 
change of the debt ratio in 2011 as compared to 

2007 is comparable and ev
en higher, as the crisis 
takes its toll via an impact on fiscal balances and 

low nominal growth.  
As shown in Table I.3.2, both in the euro area and 
in the EU as a whole, more than half of the 

approximately 4½ pps. rise in the government 

deficit projected in 2009 is
 explained by the effect 
of the cycle and related automatic stabilisers. In 

particular it is the inertia in adjusting the level of 

non-cyclical expenditure Œ the majority of public 

spending Œ to the lower GDP growth that produces 

the largest stabilising effect. Another quarter of the 

deficit increase in 2009 is accounted for by 

discretionary moves, including the fiscal stimulus 

measures adopted by Member
 States in response to 
the crisis. The estimated expansionary fiscal stance 

significantly exceeds the bu
dgetary impact of the 
discretionary measures, mainly on account of a 

pronounced fall in revenues linked to the most 

volatile tax bases. 
The large movement of fiscal variables should be 
seen in a context of the 
balance sheet adjustment 
triggered by the crisis, i.e. the reduction in the 

borrowing requirement of corporate and household 

sectors. Experience shows that episodes of balance 

sheet adjustments are typically consistent with 

matching increases in government deficits. 
In 2010, the deficit is pr
ojected to further increase 
and the fiscal stance to remain expansionary both 

in the EU and in the euro area, with only ¼ pp. of 
GDP of fiscal stimulus measures projected to be 
withdrawn on aggregate. In 2011, in contrast, 

fiscal balances are projected (on the assumption of 

unchanged policy) to improve, including in 

cyclically adjusted terms. The positive effect of the 

improvement in the cyclical conditions is expected 

to be amplified by a further partial withdrawal of 

the fiscal stimulus measures. These developments 

are projected to be only 
partially offset by the 
steady rise in interest expenditure triggered by the 

increasing debt.  
The decomposition of the dynamics of debt ratios 
presented in Table  show
s that in fact sizeable 
primary deficits and interest expenditure are the 

main drivers of the approximately 25 pps. rise in 

the government debt-to-GDP ratio projected in the 

EU in 2011 compared to 2007. Namely, primary 

deficits account for almost one half of the increase 

in average debt ratio. The overall impact of the 

snowball effect is somewhat lower, as interest 

expenditure broadly matching primary deficits is in 

part offset by the effect of nominal GDP growth. 

This effect is however limited, also due to GDP 

contracting in 2009 even in nominal terms. While 

nominal GDP growth normally reduces the debt 

ratio, in 2009 negative growth is set to increase 

debt ratios in nearly all 
Member States (exceptions 
are Poland, Cyprus and Greece). 
The slightly lower increase in the average debt 
ratio of the euro area as 
compared to the EU as a 
whole is explained by the lower primary deficits, 

partially offset by a higher snowball effect.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  58 Nearly all Member States are expected to run 
primary deficits over 2009-2011, though these 

vary substantially across countries, with 

consequent differences in debt dynamics. In 

Ireland, almost 40 pps. of the approximately 70 

pps. projected increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio 

from 2007 to 2011 can be attributed to the primary 

deficit. The figure is expect
ed to be around 30 pps. 
of GDP in the United Kingdom and Latvia, where 

the debt-to-GDP ratios are projected to increase by 

40 and 50 pps., respectively. In Bulgaria, in 

contrast, the primary balance is projected to regain 

positive territory and the debt ratio a declining path 

in 2011.  
The effect of nominal growth also varies 
significantly across countries. Nominal GDP 

growth is projected to continue to increase the debt 

ratios in 2010 in Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania and, to 

a lower extent, in Estonia and Spain.  
In view of the already very high debt ratios, 
interest expenditure weights heavily in Greece and 

Italy.  
The Commission's projections refer to government 
debt as defined in the Protocol annexed to the 

Treaty on European Union (Maastricht, 1992), 

according to which ﬁDebt me
ans total gross debt at 
nominal value outstanding at the end of the year 

and consolidated between and within the sectors of 

general government.ﬂ
(76) This definition does not 
include assets owned by the government,  or 
                                                          
 (76) This definition is supplemented by revised Council 
Regulation No 479/2009 specifying the components of 

government debt with reference to the definitions of 
financial liabilities in ESA95. In Council Regulation No 
479/2009, the nominal value is c
onsidered equivalent to the 
face value of liabilities. It is therefore equal to the amount 
(contractually agreed) that th
e government will have to 
refund to creditors at maturity. See European Communities 

(2002)

Communities, Luxembourg. 
implicit and contingent liabilities.
(77)
 Yet, in 
several Member States, part of the current increase 

in the debt ratio is due to capital injections, and 

thus has a counterpart in assets that in the future 

could  be sold to repay debt. However, measures of 

net debt have considerable disadvantages in terms 

of transparency and volatility. While financial 

liabilities can be estimated in a timely and accurate 

manner, it is much more problematic to assess 

assets, including their liquidity. The current 

situation has made this difficulty even more 

evident. The role of implicit liabilities can, in part, 

be factored into an analysis based on the debt 

definition in the Treaty by including the cost of 

ageing in the medium-term projections. Contingent 

liabilities, including those linked to public 

interventions in the banking system, add to the 

fiscal risk, but quantifying their magnitude is 

fraught with difficulties. 
(78)
  From the early days of the 
crisis, when the risk of a 
possible credit crunch was anticipated and the 

solvency of banks was called into question, it 

became clear that it was e
ssential to ensure the 
normal functioning of wholesale credit markets 

and more generally to provide support for the 

banking sector in order to avoid a meltdown of the 

financial system and help restore market 

confidence. In October 2008
, the EU heads of state 
or government agreed to 
implement a co-ordinated 
rescue plan for the EU banking sector, comprising 
                                                          
 (77) A contingent liability can be defined as a public sector 
action that determines an outla
y only if an when a certain 
event take place. Implicit liab
ilities are not backed up by 
law, but involve spending for which there is an expectation 
that it will continue or materialise Œ such as pension 

spending.  Implicit and contingent liabilities are not 

mutually exclusive categories.  
(78) Eurostat (news release 149/2009)  has published 
supplementary tables for the financial crisis for the euro 

area and the EU that contain da
ta on "outstanding amounts 
of assets, actual liabilities and contingent liabilities of 
government" in relation to government interventions in the 

context of the financial turmoil for the years 2007 and 2008

The schemes approved encompass recapitalisation 

and other forms of equity intervention, guarantees, 

liquidity support and impaired assets relief. In 

addition to the general schemes, several Member 

States have adopted ad ho
c interventions in favour 
of individual financial institutions.  
Table I.3.4 presents the support measures 
committed and effectively granted by Member 

States since the start of
 the crisis to aid the 
functioning of the financial sector. The effect on 

the fiscal risk depends on the nature of the 

measure. The capital injections in the second 

column appear on the government sector's balance 

sheet and lead to increases in gross debt via the 

stock-flow adjustment presented in Table I.3.3. 

The injections provide the 
governments with assets 
which they sell in the future, but whose value is 

nevertheless subject to uncertainty. Columns three 

and four show the approved and effective 

guarantees provided to financial institutions. For 

some Member States these are particularly 

significant. These are explicit contingent liabilities 

as they represent the amount of government 
underwriting that will not appear on the 
government's balance sheet unless the guarantees 

are called. And commitments
 to guarantee deposits 
in banks up to the ceiling specified in column nine 

will also only impose a cost on the government if 

the guarantee is called (NB their overall amount 

has not been quantified). 
The asset relief and liquidity and bank support 
schemes are a mixed set of interventions, some of 

which transfer risk to th
e public sector without an 
outlay that appears in debt
, thereby also increasing 
the explicit contingent liabilities of the 

government.

By 2011 EU average deficits are forecast to start 

falling (from 7.5% of GDP in 2010 to 6.9% in 

2011), but they remain at a level consistent with a 

steadily increasing level of debt. Although past

  60 experience tells us that the main increases in debt 
occur in the first two year
s of a financial crisis, 
current projections of the public finances raise 

serious concerns due to 
the combination of the 
structural nature of the high deficit levels, which 

combines with the trend slowdown in GDP growth 

and the rise in government expenditure already 

expected to happen in the EU on account of 

population ageing.  
As highlighted in the previous chapters, there are 
also reasons to expect that
 the current crisis could 
lead to lasting negative effects on growth structural 

effects through a number of channels. 
(80)
 Particularly, the need to downsize traditionally key 

industries and the relatively high indebtedness of 

European firms towards a 
banking system that is 
also restructuring may affect the stock of capital 

and total factor productivity. In turn, this could 

influence the NAIRU. A central scenario might 

thus be for growth to recover its medium-term 

potential slowly.  
Reflecting this scenario, this section presents 
medium-term projections for the gross debt-to-

GDP ratio of the EU Member States based on the 

assumption that it will take until 2020 to get back 

to the long-term growth rates that were projected 

before the crisis intensif
ied. The projections are 
derived as a mechanical extension of the 

Commission's autumn 2009 
forecast based on an 
update of the "Lost Decade" macroeconomic 

scenario in the 2
009 Ageing Report
(81), as well as 
on the additional assumptions described in Box 

I.3.1. In particular, the projections do not assume 

policy measures other than those already 

announced within the horizo
n of the forecast. They 
are based on the technical assumption that the 

stimulus measures adopted in line with the 

European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) might 

be only partially withdrawn in 2011 but fully 

reversed in 2012 and that no further additional 

consolidation is implemented.

The no-policy-change assumption (except for the 
full withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus) is chosen for 

purely illustrative purposes and the projections 

therefore cannot be taken as in any way 

foreshadowing future debt developments, which 

can be expected to be affected by future, as yet 

unspecified, consolidation measures. Rather, the 

projections serve to give an indication of the 

magnitude of the adjustment needed. 
These projections are characterised by the explicit 
inclusion of a progressive increase in age-related 

expenditure. The estimated
 increase projected for 
the EU is already sizeable
 by 2020 (1.3 pps. of 
GDP), with significant variations across Member 

States (see Table I.3.6).  
Graph I.3.5 and Graph I.3.
6 present the trajectory 
of debt-to-GDP ratios in euro area and non-euro 

area Member States under the assumptions 

described in Box I.3.1, using a partial equilibrium 

analysis that does not cons
ider the effect of the 
public finances on growth. Graph I.3.11 shows 

what these assumptions imply in terms of primary 

balance. The rise in ageing-related expenditure 

result in a steadily increasing primary deficit after 

the full withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus measures 

in 2012. 
The projections show the debt ratio continuing to 
rise for a majority of Member States thereafter. 

Only in three Member St
ates (Bulgaria, Denmark 
and Sweden) is the debt projected to start declining 

again. For the EU aggregate, debt is projected to 

increase from about 83% in 2011 to around 120% 

of GDP by 2020 Œ with th
e steady increase in the 
years after the crisis set to
 dwarf the direct impact 
of the crisis.  
Economic developments at the aggregated level 
  61 Faced with increasing debt, governments will have 
to take action. The absence of any consolidation in 

the above exercise does not imply that no such 

action is anticipated. Rather
, the exercise seeks to 
illustrate that the discontinuation of the stimulus 

measures and cyclical
 recovery, including a 
rebound in tax revenue from its crisis-related lows, 

will be insufficient to prevent debt rising to very 

high and in several cases likely unsustainable 

levels before the end of the next decade. 
Graphs I.3.7 and I.3.8 show the projected 
trajectory of debt ratio w
ith an annual adjustment 
of 0.5 pp. of GDP until Member States reach their 

medium-term objectives (MTO). This is the 

minimum consolidation that the Stability and 

Growth Pact recommends for countries that have 

not attained their MTOs. It leads, on average, to a 

primary surplus only at th
e end of the decade (see 
Graph I.3.11).  
In terms of debt, it can be seen that this adjustment 
results in an overall slowing of the increase and 

stabilising of debt at around 100% of GDP in the 

EU overall, but is not sufficient to reduce it on 

average. Indeed, in some Member States, debt 
ratios are projected to continue increasing strongly, 
with the consolidation having little real impact on 

sustainability.

Notes: 
  European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  62 However, a stronger consolidation of 1 pp. of 
GDP, leading to a primary surplus of around 3% of 

GDP by 2020, would be sufficient for debt to start 

declining on average (s
ee Graph I.3.9). After 
reaching a peak of around 90% of GDP in 2015, 

by 2020 only the level effect would continue to 

show in the debt, which would be again at around 

80% of GDP. However, for Ireland and Greece this 

would still not be sufficient to stabilise the debt.  
An alternative way to see the challenge facing 
Member States is to consider the required primary 

balance (RPB) and the corresponding budgetary 

effort to meet it in order to for debt to reach the 

60% threshold by 2020. 
(82)
 Graph  shows what this 
would look like. On aver
age, EU countries would 
need a primary balance 
of 4½% of GDP in the 
medium term in order to reach the 60% threshold, 

which corresponds to a budgetary effort of 8¾ pps. 

of GDP spread over the years 2011-15. For the 

euro area, the required primary balance would 

have to be higher, at 5½% of GDP, although 

reaching it would requir
e the same budgetary 
effort.  3.6. A CHALLENGING CONSOLIDATION 
AHEAD Against a background of an economic and 
financial crisis, running up sizeable deficits is a 

natural development for countries that markets 

judge solvable. The proj
ected increase in debt 
ratios in the EU over
 the forecast horizon 
essentially reflects the support provided by 

Member States to economic activity and the 

financial system in the face of the risk of a global 

deflationary spiral. Although a counterfactual does 

not exist, there is every reason to believe that 

sizeable support from public finances prevented an 

even bigger recession.  
However, current fiscal 
trends are unsustainable 
and, notwithstanding the temporary nature of the 

fiscal stimulus, a 'self-liquidating' exit strategy for 

fiscal policy is not an option for a vast majority of 

Member States. The structural deterioration in 

deficit and debt positions induced by the crisis has 

been such that a recovery in the economy, 

including in tax bases, together with a withdrawal 
                                                          
 (82) The required primary balance (RPB) is the immediate and 
permanent budgetary adjustment required to reach the 60% 
debt to GDP ratio in 2020 compounded with the projected 

average structural primary balance in 2011-2015. The 
budgetary effort is the RPB net of the primary balance 
estimated in 2009. 
of the stimulus measures will be in most cases 
insufficient to put public finances back on a 

sustainable path. Restoring the sustainability of 

fiscal trends will require 
a protracted adjustment.  
The empirical analysis c
onfirms the influence of 
national fiscal rules and institutions in determining 

budgetary outcomes. In particular expenditure 

rules foreseeing automatic enforcement 

mechanisms, medium-ter
m budgetary frameworks 
and independent fiscal institutions have been found 

to contribute to greater fiscal discipline and help 

ensure sustainability. They can also support the 

shift to growth-enhancing spending areas. 
Finally, not least in the light of the ageing 
population and the trend increase in expenditure 

and slowdown in growth that it implies, it is 

important that consolidation is underpinned in a 

medium-term perspective by structural reforms 

with direct effect on implicit liabilities (pensions 

and other entitlements reforms) and indirect effect 

through increasing potential growth.

  66   Box I.3.1: 
Assumptions underlying the medium term projection for gross debt of the general 
government
In order to simulate the order of magnitude of 
the risks to potential output related to the 

economic crisis, the 2009 Ageing report(
1) presented a "Lost Decade" macroeconomic 
scenario that assumes that it will take until 

2020 to get back to the long-term growth rates 

in the AWG baseline, which are based on the 

Commission's spring 2008 forecast. The 

projections presented below are derived as 

mechanical extension of the autumn 2009 

forecast built on an update of the "Lost 

Decade" macroeconomic 
scenario. Notably, 
these projections assume: 
Ł A potential GDP path based on the AWG 
"Lost Decade" scenario. The output gap in the 

Commission's forecast shrinks linearly so that 
it is completely eliminated in 2017 and 
becomes positive afterwards; 
Ł A progressive increase in age-related 
expenditure, also derived from the Lost Decade 

scenario. Over the projection period age-related

 expenditure increases, on average, by 0.6 pp. o

value assumed for the purposes of the long-

term sustainability of public finance

assessment) in 2020 for all countries. Othe
rthings being equal, if interest rates were to

converge to a lower (or higher) level, the deb
tlevels would be 5 pps. of GDP higher (o
rlower) on average by 2020;

   PART II Prospects by individual economy 
   Member States   1. BELGIUM 
The path from policy-supported 
recovery to sustainable growth 
 70 Small open economy hit by global crisis The global financial crisis has hit Belgium mainly 
through two channels. First, as a small open 

economy, the country has 
been affected strongly 
by the fall in world trade. Second, the problems in 

the banking sector have depressed domestic 

demand through confidence and wealth effects, 

and a tightening of lending conditions. These 

effects came on top of the ongoing weakening of 

activity, also reflecting the impact of high inflation 

on private consumption at the beginning of 2008. 

In the last quarter of 2008, the slowdown turned 

into a sharp contraction (1.7% quarter-on-quarter). 

Overall, GDP growth in 2008 stood at 1%. The 

contraction continued at the same pace in the first 

quarter of 2009, as investment and inventories, 

which had resisted well up to then, also fell 

strongly because corporati
ons reacted with a lag. 
In response, the government adopted expansionary 
fiscal measures which are 
broadly in line with the 
European Economic Recovery Plan and have an 

estimated budgetary impact of ½% of GDP in both 

2009 and 2010. The package included wage 

subsidies as well as financing and payment 

facilities for firms, increases in social benefits, a 

reduction of the VAT rate for residential 

construction and an acceleration of public 

investment. At the same time, a series of actions 

were taken to support the financial sector, helping 

it to cope with the crisis. Up to now, the problems 

in the banking sector have mainly affected the 

economy through tighter lending conditions and 

adverse wealth and confidence effects. The direct 

impact on the other hand, i.a. through employment 

and investment, has been more contained. 

Nevertheless, banks remain vulnerable, also as a 

result of their exposure to troubled markets.  
Gradual recovery ahead In view of the improved international environment 

and the absence of a further negative contribution 

of inventories, growth is expected to be slightly 

positive in the second half of 2009, as also 

indicated by the improvement of business 

confidence readings. This should result in a 

contraction of 2.9% in 2009 as a whole. And the 

recovery is expected to be very gradual as global 

headwinds continue to impact negatively on 

growth, in particular in the first half of 2010. 
These stem from the restru
cturing that financial 
institutions still need to undergo, and a further rise 

in unemployment together with low capacity 

utilisation. In this context, GDP is forecast to 

expand by 0.6% in 2010 and by 1.5% in 2011. 

Overall, the recession in Belgium has been less 

severe than in the euro area as a whole.

 Belgium's better performan
ce than the euro area in 
2009 stems from a projected smaller contraction of 

domestic demand. First, the inventory cycle had a 

lower impact than in the 
euro area, partly because 
of the lower initial level of inventories. Second, 

investment contracted less. While the decline in 

capacity utilisation, weak demand prospects, worse 

financing conditions and lower profits are the main 

factors behind the fall in corporate investment both 

in Belgium and in the euro
 area, these forces seem 
to have been more limited in Belgium. This 

reflects to some extent the better initial balance 

sheet position of Belgian corporations compared to 

their euro area co
unterparts. In addition, the ECB's 
Bank Lending Survey points to a more limited 

tightening of lending conditions.  
With no significant imbalances in the residential 
real estate market, housing investment is also set to 

decline by less than in
 the euro ar
ea in 2009. 
Moreover, the temporary reduction of the VAT 

rate for residential construction should cushion the 

contraction of housing investment. 
Private consumption is in tu
rn expected to contract 
at the same pace as in th
e euro area in 2009. The 
decline in households' financial assets and the 

deterioration of confidence is likely to lead to an 
Member States, Belgium 
  71 increase in the saving rate by about 1½ percentage 
points. The rise in real disposable income (0.7%) 

as a result of lagged wage indexation in 

combination with foreseen zero inflation, mainly 

on the back of strong base effects on the energy 

component, has helped cushion private 

consumption from sharper fall. In 2010, 

consumption is projected to expand only 

moderately as lower employment and less buoyant 

wage growth depress real disposable income and 

continued negative confidence effects keep the 

savings rate high. Stronger wage growth and a 

stabilisation of employment are predicted to lead 

to stronger consumption growth in 2011. 
The recession in Belgium is
 also expected to be 
more contained than in the euro area because the 

negative contribution of net exports to growth is 

forecast to remain relativel
y limited in spite of the 
open nature of the economy. This is because, in the 

absence of support from domestic demand, the 

pattern of imports is largely dependent on the trend 

in exports, due to the close international 

integration of the production chains. While the 

contraction of world trade is expected to have 

come to an end in the th
ird quarter of 2009, the 
recovery of exports is 
expected to be rather 
subdued.  
The above scenario is subject
 to a number of risks. 
On the positive side, a more vigorous recovery of 

global demand would boost exports. Negative risks 

could stem from worse-than-expected 

developments in domestic demand. A stronger 

increase in unemployment could lead to lower 

consumption, while a stronger-than-projected 

tightening of lending conditions, in particular if the 

banks' solvency position had not sufficiently 

improved to accommodate higher credit demand, 

would depress investment. 
Weakened competitive position in recent 
years weighs on the recovery Belgium will likely not be able to fully benefit 
from a rebound of the wo
rld economy. Since 2005, 
unit labour costs increased more in Belgium than 

in the euro area, mainly as a result of the lacklustre 

development of productivity. In addition, unit 

labour costs in Belgium were driven up by the 

strong increase in wages, in particular compared to 

Germany.  
Export performance also su
ffered from an adverse 
geographical and product market orientation. 
Indeed, exports are mainly oriented towards other 
euro-area countries, whose imports have been less 

dynamic than world trade. In addition, Belgium's 

product specialisation, in goods with relatively low 

technology content, appears to have been less 

beneficial than for the euro area as a whole. 

Looking forward, the demand for these products 

may continue to underperform while price 

competition could become even stronger, thus 

posing challenges regarding the sustainability of 

export growth and firms' profitability. 
Overall, it is not foreseen that the weaknesses in 
the competitive position will be corrected over the 

forecast horizon, one reason being that unit labour 

costs are not expected to grow any more slowly 

than in the euro area. As a result, Belgium is set to 

continue losing market share beyond the loss 

experienced by other mature economies.

 Unemployment peak still ahead The impact of the economic downturn on 
employment has up to now been relatively 

contained as most employers have resorted to the 

extended schemes for temporary unemployment, 

leading to a reduction in the number of hours 

worked. However, in view
 of the lagged reaction 
of employment to changes in economic activity, 

employment is expected to contract more strongly 

in the coming quarters and the unemployment rate 

is forecast to increase 
up to 2011. Given the 
characteristics of the Belgian labour market, with 

high marginal tax rates, long unemployment-

benefit duration and limited job mobility, there is a 

risk that those workers will become permanently 

inactive, further reducing the already low labour 

supply, as illustrated by
 the comparatively low 
employment rate and number of hours worked and 

the high long-term unemployment rate.

     72 The fiscal position has deteriorated The budget balance has been
 strongly affected by 
the economic downturn. The effect of automatic 

stabilisers was larger than could have been 

expected on the basis of standard elasticities 

mainly as a result of a strong fall in corporate tax 

receipts. Furthermore, the 
deficit includes one-offs 
that increase expenditure
 by 0.5% of GDP, in 
particular reflecting capita
l transfers to the private 
sector following two court decisions 
(83)
. The 
widening of the deficit to 5.9% of GDP in fact 

reflects only to a relatively limited extent the 

impact of the expansionary
 measures included in 
the budget for 2009 (½% 
of GDP) and the fiscal 
stimulus packages (½% of GDP). 
In 2010, the deficit is projected to remain broadly 
stable. On the one hand, the economic situation 

will continue to have a negative impact on public 

finances, especially as a re
sult of the further strong 
increase in unemployment. Also interest

 Justice ruled that corporate 
taxes had to be repaid as 
the Belgian 'received dividends 
deduction regime' was not compatible with Council 

Directive 90/435/EEC of 23 July 1990 on the common 
system of taxation applicable in the case of parent 
companies and subsidiaries of different Member States. 

Second, the Belgian Constitutional Court ruled that unduly 
paid personal income taxes should be repaid to cohabiting 
and married unemployed persons to ensure equal treatment. 
taken in the past, e.g. to raise pensions, increase 
social expenditure. The impact of the stimulus 

remains at ½% of GDP, mainly because the 

package includes a number 
of permanent measures 
but also following (i) the prolongation of the 

reduction of the VAT rate for residential 

construction and (ii) the further extension of 

temporary unemployment schemes. On the other 

hand, the government agreed on corrective 

measures amounting to ¾% of GDP. These include 

a reduction of the "work bonus" in Flanders, an 

increase in excise duties, a number of savings in 

the social security system
 (including health care), 
as well as non-fiscal revenues stemming from the 

banking sector and the producers of nuclear 

energy.  In 2011, the headline deficit would remain at 5.8% 
of GDP in spite of the economic recovery, the 

positive impact associated with a number of 

already decided correc
tive measures (¼% of 
GDP), and the marginal wit
hdrawal of the stimulus 
package (0.1% of GDP). Th
is suggests that the 
trend of expenditure growth under unchanged 

policy could be unsustainable.  
As a result of the sizeable headline deficits and 
contained nominal GDP growth, especially in 2009 

and 2010, the debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to 

increase from 90% in 2008 to 104% in 2011. 
2. BULGARIA 
From recession to a more balanced growth pattern  73 The unfolding financial crisis has reinforced the 
need for adjustment Over the past five years, buoyant FDI inflows and 
strong domestic demand-driven real GDP growth 

of above 6% on average have been accompanied 

by widening external deficits and high inflation. 

The financial crisis and its consequences - tighter 

financing conditions and increased uncertainty - 

have brought investment-led growth to an end, 

making the adjustment to a more balanced growth 

even more urgent. The Bulgarian economy was hit 

hard by the global crisis and economic growth 

figures moved into negative territory in the first 

half of 2009, when real GDP fell by 4¼%. The 

deterioration stemmed from the sharp contraction 

in both external demand and foreign investment 

inflows. Reflecting the fall in investment and 

private consumption, domestic demand is expected 

to decline even further by
 the end of 2009. For the 
year as a whole, gross fixed capital formation is 

expected to contract by more than 21%, while 

private consumption should fall by approximately 

5¾%.Graph II.2.1:

forecas
t At the same time, some of the imbalances have 
started to unwind. Inflati
on decelerated in the first 
half of the year and is expected to remain subdued 

over the forecast horizon. The large pre-crisis 

savings-investment gap has started to narrow, 

leading to a welcome adjustment in external 

imbalances. As imports have been declining faster 

than exports, the contribution of net exports to 

growth is set to turn positive in 2009 and the 

current account deficit has been decreasing. The 

downturn has taken its toll on public finances: after 

the first half of 2009, the budgetary surplus 
vanished as revenues decreased while expenditures 
rose. Reliance on public finances to cushion the 

negative impact of the crisis has been limited by 

the need to maintain a sound budgetary position in 

order to underpin macroeconomic stability. To 

mitigate the adverse effects of the crisis, the 

authorities have introduced a number of measures 

aimed at strengthening the economy's resilience, 

expenditure restraint and improving revenue and 

tax collection. The direct influence of the financial 

crisis on the Bulgarian banking sector has been 

limited; accordingly, no support measures have 

been implemented by the government. 
Turnaround expected in 2010 and recovery in 
2011 After the projected contraction of slightly less than 
6% in 2009, real GDP is 
expected to continue to 
decline in 2010, albeit at
 a decelerating pace of 
around 1%. The economy is expected to start to 

recover, under the impact of the international 

cycle, in the second half 
of 2010; real GDP should 
grow by around 3% in 2011. While the magnitude 

of the recovery might be higher than in other EU 

countries, growth in 2011 should remain well 

below the pre-crisis average over the past five 

years, thus temporarily slowing the catching-up 

process. Stronger economic prospects, 

accompanied by improved lending conditions and 

credit easing, are expected
 to lead to a smaller 
decline in both gross fixed capital formation and 

private consumption in 2010 and to bring about 

positive growth rates in 2011. The increase in 

infrastructure investment, mainly due to the 

absorption of EU funds, is expected to have a 

stabilising role at the beginning of the forecast 

period but this may not be sufficient to compensate 

for the slowdown in corporate investment and 

construction. The envisaged government 

infrastructure projects shou
ld contribute to the 
rebound of fixed investment in 2011. The 

projected increase in private consumption is 

expected to be supported by improving economic 

prospects and higher employment. 
Looking ahead, the pattern of
 growth is expected 
to partially shift from domestic demand to the 

external side. The growth contribution of net 

exports is projected to remain positive even in 

2011 when domestic demand should pick up again. 

This rebalancing should result in a partial 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  74 unwinding of the external imbalances, as imports 
fall faster than exports during the downturn. In line 

with the positive developments in external 

demand, exports are expected 
to start to pick up in 
2010, ahead of imports. As real GDP growth 

resumes in 2011 and imports start to rise again, 

projected gains in price competitiveness stemming 

from the adjustment in nominal wages should lead 

to a further narrowing of the trade deficit.  
Risks to this baseline scenario are tilted to the 
upside. Foreign capital inflows may turn out to be 

larger than expected, either through a partial 

recovery in FDI, or through higher absorption of 

EU funds, which would support domestic demand 

and mitigate the strong fall in investment still in 

2010. Following the marked run-down in 2009, a 

rebound of inventories could offer an additional 

boost to growth as the economy starts to recover. 

In addition, the commitment by foreign parent 

banks to support their local subsidiaries might 

translate in some credit easing. A faster-than-

projected adjustment in nominal wages could bring 

unit labour costs further 
down and lead to an 
improvement in price competitiveness. On the 

negative side, despite the relative resilience of the 

labour market in the first half of 2009, 

unemployment could increase faster should the 

slowdown turn out to be more protracted,  thus 

putting further pressure on private consumption.  

In addition, within the context of credit restraint, 

the servicing of the economy™s high external debt 

might crowd out domestic investment and 

spending. In the event that external financing 

conditions become even tighter, the external 

imbalance could narrow more rapidly, but at the 

expense of a slower economic recovery. 
Correcting domestic and external imbalances  With the lowest GDP-per-capita level in the EU, 

the main challenge for Bulgaria is to ensure 

sustained and quick catching-up process while 

preserving macroeconomic stability. Given the 

projected lower contribution of FDI-driven 

investment to economic act
ivity, the adjustment of 
the economy is expected to
 involve a shift to a 
more export-oriented growth pattern, which would 

depend to a large extent on a recovery in external 

demand. In addition, real convergence could be 

enhanced by improved competitiveness and 

structural reforms to boost potential growth. 
With domestic demand contracting in 2009 and 
2010 and recovering only partially towards the end 
of the forecast horizon, a 
significant correction of 
the external deficit by 
2011 is projected. After 
reaching a level of around
 25% of GDP at the end 
of 2008, the current account deficit has been 

adjusting rapidly in 2009 and is expected to more 

than halve by the end of 2010 and to fall further to 

around 8% of GDP thereafter - but to still remain 

at high levels. The sustainability of the current 

account adjustment would depend crucially on the 

supply-side response. With the external imbalances 

correcting, the economy's 
net borrowing vis-à-vis 
the rest of the world is expected to undergo a 

significant downward adjustment. However, given 

the competitiveness challe
nges in recent years, it 
remains to be seen how sustainable these 

adjustments will be and how far they will go. 
Due to tight labour market conditions, nominal 
wage growth in the boom years has by far 

exceeded productivity
 growth, raising nominal unit 
labour costs and fuelling inflation. As a result, over 

the past few years high unit labour costs have led 

to a strong appreciation 
of the real effective 
exchange rate, worsening the economy's price 

competitiveness vis-à-vis the EU average.  
After peaking at 12% on average last year, HICP 
inflation has been on a fast downward path and is 

projected to remain low ov
er the forecast horizon. 
However, when the global recovery gains 

momentum, the prices of oil and other 

commodities in international markets could again 

become sources of inflationary pressures. In 

addition, core inflation is 
set to slightly exceed 3% 
over the forecast horizon, remaining well above 

headline inflation and reflecting a certain degree of 

price rigidity in product markets. At the same time, 

nominal wage adjustment appears to be much 

more sluggish. These trends have persisted in 

2009, which could result in high real wage growth.  
The labour market has remained relatively 
resilient, although the downturn led to a fall in 

employment and an increase in unemployment, 

mainly affecting the labour-intensive sectors, in 

particular construction. Total employment is 

expected to decline by 2% in 2009 and should start 

to increase only in 2011. 
The decline is due to a 
decrease in the number of employees; the number 

of self-employed will in
crease over the whole 
forecast period. As a result 
of the significant fall in 
output, far in excess of the decline in employment, 

productivity growth should be negative in 2009, 

impacting adversely on 
price competitiveness.

expected to gather momentum, with productivity

Maintaining a sound budgetary position The economic downturn, which is adversely 

affecting the tax intensity of the economy and 

leading to higher spending pressures, has already 

resulted in the accumulation of a small deficit 

amounting to around ¾% of GDP in the first eight 

months of 2009. The new government has started 

to implement a number of revenue-raising 

measures targeted at increasing tax compliance and 

combating fraud, as well as expenditure cuts, 

which would limit the general government deficit 

to around ¾% of GDP this year. Under a no-

policy-change assumption, the budgetary outcome 

should yield a deficit of around 1¼% of GDP in 

2010 and less than ½% 
in 2011. There are risks 
that the budgetary deficit might turn out to be 

higher. On the revenue side, Bulgaria could face a 

protracted period of significantly less tax-intensive 

growth composition, as th
e economy shifts to a 
more export-oriented pattern. At the same time, the 

envisaged measures might have a smaller-than-

estimated and/or only temporary impact on 

compliance in the context of the sharp downturn. 

On the expenditure side, as the effect of the crisis 

on the labour market unfolds, social spending 
should increase. As regards the envisaged 
expenditure cuts, while these are essential for 

keeping total expenditure under control, across-

the-board downsizing in items such as capital 

expenditure could affect the economy™s potential 

and the growth prospects in the medium term. 
3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
From recession to gradual recovery 
 76 Economic slump and policy response in 2009– The Czech Republic was one of the best economic 
performers in Central and Eastern Europe in recent 

years. Real GDP grew by an average 5% over 

2003-08, which helped to take GDP per capita 

from 73% to 80% of the EU average over the same 

period. This performance was guided by overall 

sound macroeconomic and st
ructural policies, and 
underpinned by a vibrant export sector. This 

sustained economic expansion did not trigger 

unsustainable dynamics. Credit growth, although 

rapid, was consistent with underlying convergence; 

the current account defici
t remained at readily 
financeable levels; and in
flation remained low for 
most of the period, with the exception of 2008 

when consumer prices increased temporarily due 

to tax increases and emerging capacity constraints. 
These strong fundamentals
 have helped the Czech 
economy to weather the global financial crisis, 

although a large loss of output could not be 

avoided. Like other export-orientated economies, 

the Czech economy slowed 
down significantly in 
2008, suffering from the collapse of external 

demand. The downturn intensified in the first half 

of 2009, when exports and industrial production 

both fell by 18% and real GDP contracted by 5% 

in year-on-year terms. While the global crisis 

affected the Czech economy
 mainly via the trade 
channel, the worsening of output prospects, tighter 

credit conditions and shrinking foreign investment 

inflows also triggered a sizeable decline of 

investment (down 7.4% in the first half of 2009), 

which amplified the economic contraction. As in 

other countries, a sharp correction in inventories 

took place at the turn of the year, which will also 

be a significant drag on growth in 2009. Despite 

the large shock to the real economy, unprecedented 

turbulences in international capital and financial 

markets, and a decline in 
real estate prices, the 
financial sector has remained relatively stable, 

mainly due to prudent regulation, a strong 

domestic deposit base and low exposure to toxic 

assets and foreign exchange loans. 
In response to the ec
onomic crisis, the Czech government adopted two stimulus packages, 

amounting to some 2% of GDP. The main 

measures included cuts in social security 

contributions, increases in public infrastructure 

investment, financial support to businesses and 
measures to support employment. The objective 
was to provide some bridging support for 

businesses during the downturn and to stimulate 

domestic demand, partially compensating for the 

slump in export growth. At the same time, the 

increase in government investment in transport 

infrastructure is expect
ed to bring longer-term 
benefits to the economy.   
–followed by a gradual recovery in 2010-11 Recent high-frequency in
dicators have provided 
some signs of stabilisation in economic activity. 

Business confidence seems to be recovering 

slowly, while exports have stopped falling and the 

inventories cycle has turned
. At the same time, the 
economy is benefitting from the easing of stress in 

international financial markets Œ CDS spreads have 

declined by 260 bps since January 2009 and are 

now close to pre-crisis levels. Against this 

background, the recession ended in the second 

quarter of 2009 with a stabilisation of real GDP. 

Over the coming quarters, the recovery is expected 

to remain shallow, reflecting diverging impulses 

from the underlying drivers of growth.

t On the one hand, the global recovery in 2010 
should support a rebound of exports. In parallel, 

following a sharp contraction in 2009 (-7.2%), 

investment is expected to stop falling and to 

recover slowly in the second half of 2010 if 

expectations about the future pace of the recovery 

continue to improve.
 A gradual rebound of foreign 
investment inflows and the positive impact of EU 

funds should also contribute to this movement.
 On 
the other hand, consumer demand is likely to

Member States, The Czech Republic 
  77 disposable income. Declining employment, 
slowing wages, and the recently-approved fiscal 

consolidation measures should weigh on private 

consumption next year. The planned tax increases 

are set to push inflation up slightly despite low 

commodity prices and the negative output gap. The 

sluggishness of private consumption should persist 

up to the end of 2010, when labour market 

conditions are expected to improve. Overall, 

following the sharp contraction of 4.8% this year, 

real GDP is expected to increase by 0.8% in 2010 

and to gather pace in 20
11 with growth above 2%. 
It appears that, despite considerable uncertainty, 

the risks to the growth outlook are broadly 

balanced. On the upside, a faster recovery would 

be possible if demand for 
Czech exports were to 
pick up more rapidly than
 expected.  The downside 
risks are linked to the steeply rising unemployment 

and weak private consumption.  
Unemployment is set to rise– One of the main challe
nges facing the Czech 
economy in the post-crisis environment will be to 

ensure a rapid adjustment of the labour market to 

the downturn. There is a risk
 that the large drop in 
economic activity, which is particularly 

pronounced in some export
-oriented areas like the 
automotive sector, might tr
anslate into an extended 
period of high unemployment in some regions. 

This could affect the growth potential of the 

economy through hysteresis and losses in human 

capital. The unemployment rate, while lower than 

in most of other new Member States, is expected to 

increase markedly (by arou
nd 3 percentage points) 
over the forecast horizon. Also, following the large 

fall in labour productivity during the crisis Œ 3 

percent in 2009, compared to average annual gains 

of around 4 percent during the boom phase Œ the 

risk exists of a jobless recovery. A rapid 

adjustment of wages could help ensure 

convergence toward a desirable equilibrium in the 

labour market. The imp
act of the recession on 
labour market developments also depends on the 

speed at which longer-term 
structural constraints 
on labour market participation and flexibility such 

as low regional and sectoral mobility as well as 

skills mismatches are alleviated, allowing 

reallocation of the labour 
force from those sectors 
that were hard-hit during the crisis Œ including the 

large automotive sector Œ to those with the most 

favourable medium-term outlook.  
The speed of future real convergence also depends 
on developments in external competitiveness and 
the capacity of the Czech economy to continue its 
successful integration in the global economy. 

Available indicators suggest that the external 
position of the Czech economy has remained 

strong during the crisis, with the koruna valued at a 

level broadly in line with fundamentals. However, 

while a relative advantage in labour-intensive 

goods still exists, it is diminishing over time given 

the increasing competiti
on from lower-wage EU 
members and non-EU countries.

 –while public finances deteriorate further Years of pro-cyclical policy during the boom 
phase had left Czech public finances in a 

structurally weak position at the outset of the 

crisis. While the headline deficit improved by one 

percentage point between 2004 and 2008, the 

structural deficit increased from 2½% to over 4% 

of GDP over the same period. Also, the fiscal 

room for manoeuvre was limited by the risks 

implied by an ageing po
pulation for the long-term 
sustainability of public finances. Although the first 

stages of the pension and healthcare reforms were 

initiated in 2008, both pension- and healthcare-

related expenditures remain high and are set to 

increase markedly in future.  
The public finances are expected to worsen 
considerably in 2009. The general government 

deficit is set to widen from 2.1% of GDP in 2008 

to 6.6% of GDP in 2009, mainly as a result of the 

economic downturn. The structural deficit should 

also increase, reflecting 
anti-crisis measures. On 
the revenue side, cuts 
in social security 
contributions and a reduction of the corporate 

income tax rate from 21% to 19% will contribute 

to the estimated fall in the revenue-to-GDP ratio.

package for 2010 - estim
ated at approximately

the context of the 2010 budget. The main measures 

include increases in VAT, excise duties and real 

estate tax and withdrawal of some anti-crisis 

measures such as higher unemployment benefits 

and temporary reductions in social security 

contributions, all implemented in the course of 

2009. Cuts in public wages have also been 

announced. The consolidation package is expected 

to reduce the general government deficit to around 

5½% of GDP in 2010. Under the no-policy-change 

assumption, public finances are projected to 

deteriorate slightly in 2011 despite higher real 

GDP growth, as parliamentary elections planned 

spring 2010 make consolidation efforts after 2010 

more uncertain. Given the large degree of 

openness of the economy, and the high level of the 
government deficit in 2009, a credible fiscal 
consolidation plan for the medium term should not 

be detrimental to growth. Direct negative effects 

could be offset by a positive impact on private 

sector agents' confidence.  
4. DENMARK 
Fiscal stimulus and private consumption underpin recovery 
 79 Early recession and quick policy response A decade of sustained grow
th and strong economic 
performance in Denmark had already come to an 

end in early 2008. This was initially due to 

domestic reasons, as the economy was suffering 

from a bursting real estate bubble and overheating. 

The global financial and economic crisis therefore 

hit an economy that was 
already in a recession and 
GDP fell by 1.2% in 2008 
Thanks to their robust public finance position, the 
Danish authorities reacted 
to the crisis with a 
significant fiscal expansion, notably with large tax 

reductions, which came into play already in early 

2009 because they had 
been targeted at the 
ongoing domestic recession rather than the more 

severe global recession that was felt in Denmark 

from the end of 2008. These measures are 

expected to turn a comfor
table budget surplus of 
3.4% of GDP in 2008 into an expected deficit of 4 

¾% in 2010. In addition, the financial system was 

stabilised by two bank rescue packages. 
Apart from its early beginning and the rapid 
government response, the crisis is Denmark differs 

from other countries in its remarkable weakness of 

private consumption, which fell by ¼% in 2008 

and by an expected 4½% in 2009. This is notable 

because real disposable in
come at the same time 
continued to increase by ½%, as households 

benefitted from favourable wage increases, 

initially stable employment,
 sizeable tax reductions 
and the release of pension funds. Nevertheless, due 

to falling confidence, diminishing real estate prices 

and the bleak global economic outlook, Danish 

consumers cut back their consumption 

substantially and the savings rate is expected to 

have almost doubled in one year from 5.7% of 

GDP in 2008 to over 10% of GDP in 2009, 

motivated by insecurity and the need to deleverage 

balance sheets.  
In this environment, the massive government 
intervention and sizeable automatic stabilisers 

could not keep the economy from contracting by 

an expected 4½% in 2009
, due to the decline in 
private consumption combined with a fall in 

exports and investment at double-digit rates. 
Private consumption, public investment and 
exports turn the cycle around In spite of the weak response of the Danish 
economy so far, this for
ecast expects that the seed 
has been sown for a modest recovery starting in 

the second half of 2009. Rising confidence 

indicators point to a rebound in consumer 

spending. On top of this, large public investment 

programmes are beginning to take effect, the 

inventory cycle is coming to an end and the 

decline in exports also appears to have come to a 

halt. Investment, by contrast, will probably only 

start to increase quite late in the recovery.

forecast
 The stabilisation of the world economy and the 
gradual pick-up in economic activity around the 

world, together with low interest rates and the 

continued rise in disposab
le incomes, are expected 
to restore consumer confidence. Private 

consumption is therefore 
expected to become the 
main driver of the economic recovery from the end 

of 2009 onwards. 
By contrast, investment is expected to lag behind. 
Low demand, rising unit labour costs, falling 

profits and an uncertain economic outlook had 

already led companies to cut back investments 

sharply in 2007, with the construction sector hit 

especially hard due to the cooling housing market. 

The fall in business investment is expected to 

continue throughout 2009 and into 2010. With 

plenty of spare capacity 
in the corporate sector, 
business investment is expected to be subdued 

throughout the entire forecast period. 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  80 Through the fiscal bills for 2009 and 2010, the 
government has given a boost to public 

consumption and to infrastructure investment in 

railroads, roads, schools and daycare facilities. The 

government investment programs are not expected 

to offset the steep decline in business investment 

completely, but they will cushion it. The timing of 

the investment programs is hard to predict. While 

some projects can be initiated almost immediately, 

others require extensive planning before they can 

be executed. Apart from the immediate stimulus 

effect of the investment 
programs, they are also 
expected to have a positive long-term effect on 

productivity. 
With an improving external environment, Danish 
trade is expected to pick up at the end of 2009 and 

to continue to grow slowly in both 2010 and 2011. 

However, the global economic crisis has forced 

companies around the wo
rld to reassess their 
supply chains. Because of their loss of 

competitiveness in the 
last decade, Danish 
companies will find themselves in an increasingly 

difficult situation vis-à-vis their foreign 

competitors. Despite the erosion of 

competitiveness, Danish exports have performed 

well compared with other countries in the 

European Union. This ca
n probably be explained 
by the composition of Danish exports, with a 

relative large share of ch
emical, agriculture and 
energy-technology products, which are 

traditionally less sensitive to business cycle 

swings. Regardless of the favourable product mix 

in its exports, Denmark is still expected to lose 

market shares throughout the forecast period. 
The fall in demand has also affected employment, 
leading companies to lay off workers in order to 

cut costs. The unemploym
ent rate rose from a 
historical low of 3.3 % in 2008 to an expected 4½ 

% in 2009 and is projected to rise through 2010, 

reaching close to 6% by the beginning of 2011 

before beginning to decline.  Although the rise in 

unemployment has been dramatic, the flexible 

Danish labour market an
d active labour market 
policies are expected to limit the likely rise in 

structural unemployment. 
Inflation is expected to bottom out at just above 
1% in 2009, reflecting strong base effects from 

declining fuel and food prices and recession-

induced downward pressure on profits. With 

higher energy and environmental taxes and an 

expected rise in oil and other commodity prices, 

inflation is forecast to ri
se by 1½% in 2010. With 
the recovery gaining ground and a gradual 
widening of profit margins, a further increase in 

inflation to 1¾% in 2011 is expected.  
The above scenario is subject to a number of 
positive and negative risks. On the positive side, a 

stronger-than-expected recovery in Denmark's 

main trading partners could lead to a stronger 

rebound in exports, raising the growth prospect for 

the entire forecast period. Moreover, private 
consumption may grow more quickly than 

anticipated, given the current upsurge in consumer 

confidence and improved global economic 

outlook. The household savings rate is at a 

historically high level, which creates room for 

increased consumption. The stabilisation of the 

housing and stock markets could be the trigger that 

restores consumer confidence and leads to a strong 

rebound in private consumption.  Downward risks 

to the recovery may, on the other hand, materialise 

in the event of renewed trouble in the financial 

sector. Financial system stability secured through 
government action The financial side of the global economic crisis 
became visible in Denmark at the end of 2008, 

when the 10th largest Danish bank, Roskilde Bank, 

was taken over by the Danish Central Bank due to 

insolvency. Several other minor banks have since 

been taken over by the government or forced to 

merge. The crisis made it difficult for the Danish 

financial sector to acquire funding and raised 

concerns about the sector's financial health. The 

Danish government enacted two bank rescue 

packages providing depositor guarantees and 

capital injections, and the mandate and resources 

of the Danish financial supervisory authority was 

strengthened. The measures taken appear to have 

helped and there are no indications of a serious 

credit squeeze. Risks still 
exist in the financial 
system, and it can not be ruled out that more banks 

might be either liquidated or forced to merge. But 

the overall stability of the system is expected to 

remain robust, at least until the expiry of the bank 

rescue packages. 
Fiscal sustainability and the need for post-crisis 
consolidation The fiscal consolidation 
and structural reforms 
implemented in Denmark over the last decade are 

serving the country well in the current crisis,

The crisis and the expansionary fiscal policy have 
put pressure on public fi
nances, leading to sizeable 
deficits in both 2010 and 2011.  The increase in 

expenditures projected for 2009 and 2010, 

including the draft budget bill for 2010, reflect the 

functioning of automatic stabilisers, especially 

higher unemployment benefits, higher public 

investment brought about by the fiscal stimulus 

programs, and higher interest expenditure due to 

the increase in public debt. Tax revenues are 

expected to be sluggish in the forecast period, 

reflecting the tax cuts decided in 2007 and 2009. 

With the expected deficits in the forecast period, 

government debt is set to increase modestly from 

33½% of GDP in 2008 to 35¼% of GDP in 2011. 
5. GERMANY 
Export-led rebound eventually turn
ing into broad-based recovery 
 82 Sizeable fiscal stimulus in response to slump in 
exports and investment Due to its large export-oriented manufacturing 
sector and its specialisation in investment goods, 

Germany was more exposed to the global trade 

shock triggered by the financial crisis than most 

other economies. As a result, the contraction of 

real GDP in the second ha
lf of 2008 and the first 
quarter of 2009 was among the sharpest of all 

industrialised countries, fuelled by an 

unprecedented slump in exports and investment 

activity. However, thanks to a rebound in exports 

and a remarkably resilient labour market Œ helped 

by short-time work measures Œ the German 

economy bounced back ear
lier than expected, with 
positive quarterly real GDP growth returning 

already in the second
 quarter of 2009. 
In response to the crisis, the German government 
adopted a set of measures to stabilise the banking 

sector, including the provision of guarantees of up 

to EUR 400 bn (around 16% of GDP) via a 

Financial Market Stabilisation Fund. An additional 

EUR 80 bn (around 3% of GDP) was earmarked 

for capital injections and purchasing of troubled 

assets. A "bad bank" scheme was introduced to 

remove impaired assets from bank balance sheets. 

Moreover, apart from letting the automatic 

stabilisers fully operate, Germany also introduced 

a welcomed sizeable fiscal stimulus of around 

1¾% of GDP on average in 2009 and 2010. 

Stimulus measures were aimed at providing relief 

to households and enterprises, increasing public 

infrastructure investment and stabilising the labour 

market. 
Early rebound followed by gradual recovery, 
gathering pace in 2011 The surprisingly swift rebound of the German 
economy is set to accelerate further in the third 

quarter on the back of a pronounced turnaround in 

exports, the reversal of the inventory cycle and the 

start of public infrastru
cture projects. Rising 
unemployment and the expiry of the car scrappage 

scheme are, however, likely to entail some setback 

as from the end of this year, with activity 

remaining subdued especially in the first half of 

2010 and gathering pace ma
inly during 2011. Real 
GDP is thus projected to grow by around 1¼% in 

2010 and 1¾% in 2011. 
Private consumption has remained remarkably 
resilient during the economic downturn thanks to 

low inflation, relatively stable employment, the 

lagged effect of higher wage growth prior to the 

crisis, and policy-induced relief measures. The 

stabilising role of private consumption will, 

however, come to an end in the second half of 

2009 when unemployment and inflation are 

expected to pick up. The 
temporary decline of the 
household saving rate will also most likely be 

reversed with the phasing out of the car scrappage 

premium. Private consumption is therefore 

expected to hold back growth for most of 2010 

despite the implementation of additional tax relief 

measures. In view of extremely low capacity utilisation rates 
and tightened financing conditions, private 

investment is likely to remain weak throughout 

2010. However, with the recovery gathering pace, 

the need in a number of sectors to adjust to 

structural shifts in global demand should lead to a 

marked increase in capita
l formation from 2011. 
Higher public investment, mainly in the 

construction sector, will at least partly compensate 

for the shortfall in private investment demand, 

especially in 2010. In co
ntrast, the withdrawal of 
the stimulus is set to have a dampening effect 

during 2011, when private investment is expected 

to accelerate. Graph II.5.1:

forecast
 Given the production structure of the German 
economy, an impulse from external demand will 

be crucial to kick-start the economic recovery. The 

rebound in exports already started in spring 2009, 

boosted by global stimulus measures and mainly 
Member States, Germany 
  83 from emerging market economies. The 
sustainability of this recovery still needs to be 

confirmed. The expiry of stimulus measures and 

the continued deleveraging of the private sector in 

a number of countries are likely to weigh on export 

growth, especially in 2010. Nevertheless, with its 

cost competitiveness largely intact and its 

comparative advantage in supplying investment 

goods, Germany should be well placed to benefit 

from the recovery especia
lly in emerging market 
economies and should be ab
le to reverse the loss of 
market shares encounte
red during the crisis. 
Therefore, a moderate but steady recovery in 

exports is projected for 2010, gathering 

momentum in 2011 and sustaining a relatively 

broad-based post-crisis recovery in the economy. 

With domestic demand projected to respond more 

vigorously to the increase in economic activity 

than in the past, import growth should also pick up 

markedly, especially in 
2011. The contribution of 
net exports to growth is projected to remain 

moderate compared with th
e pre-crisis situation, 
reflecting a more balanced growth composition. 
Given the sharp contraction in economic activity, 
inflationary pressures are projected to remain 

subdued throughout the forecast period. Thanks to 

lower energy prices and associated favourable base 

effects, annual HICP inflation has decelerated 

sharply during 2009 and has turned temporarily 

negative. With the base effects gradually petering 

out by the end of the year and energy prices rising 

again, HICP inflation is ex
pected to edge up from 
0.3% on average in 2009 to 0.8% in 2010. With 

the recovery gaining ground and the negative 

output gap gradually starting to close, a slight 

pick-up in inflation is projected for 2011. 
This forecast is subject to 
a number of risk factors. 
Firstly, a sharper-than-expected increase in 

unemployment could lead to
 a stronger contraction 
of private consumption in 2010 and a more 

moderate recovery in 2011. Secondly, bank 

balance sheets have been considerably weakened 

because of the high exposure to toxic assets, 

concentrated in some commercial banks and 

Landesbanken
. This could impair the capacity of 
the banking sector to 
provide finance to the 
corporate sector, thereby 
hampering a recovery in 
investment demand. On the other hand, following 

the sharp and sudden contraction of economic 

activity in 2008/09, a normalisation of the situation 

could entail a more buoyant rebound than currently 

envisaged. In line with strong improvements in 

business and consumer confidence indicators, the 
internal dynamics of the recovery could turn out 
stronger than currently expected and together with 

a stronger labour mark
et counterbalance the 
dampening factors identified above. 
Internal adjustments in the 2000s laid the basis 
for more balanced growth The medium-term outlook is influenced by the fact 
that Germany went through
 a decade of profound 
internal adjustments prior to the crisis. Following 

the post-unification boom with above-average 

wage and price inflation, a prolonged period of 

wage moderation helped to restore price 

competitiveness. The household saving rate, which 

had dropped after unification, returned to its 

longer-term average. Co
mpanies used increasing 
profit margins to strengthen their balance sheets. 

This came primarily at the expense of domestic 

investment, as the establis
hment of the euro area, 
enlargement of the EU, gl
obalisation and closer 
financial integration triggered higher capital 

exports from Germany. In the public sector, fiscal 

consolidation brought the general government 

budget back into balance by 2007, from a deficit of 

3.8% of GDP in 2004. A series of labour market 

reforms Œ in combination with wage restraint Œ 

helped tackle the high level of structural 

unemployment.

t As a consequence, domestic demand remained 
sluggish for almost a d

investment growth, fiscal tightening and lacklustre 

private consumption due to stagnant real 

disposable incomes and a rising saving rate. The 

mirror image of these internal adjustments was a 

growth pattern that was tilted towards exports, 

fuelled by improved competitiveness and ebullient 

demand from countries experiencing asset bubbles 

and strong capital inflows. 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  84 At the onset of the crisis, the process of internal 
adjustment had effectiv
ely come to an end. 
Economic growth picked up strongly as from 

2006, with private investment increasing sharply. 

Thanks to past wage moderation and labour market 

reforms, unemployment 
decreased markedly and 
employment growth accelerat
ed, spilling over into 
higher wage growth. These wage gains did not 

immediately lead to stronger private consumption 

growth, as the 2007 increase in VAT and higher 

energy prices in 2008 
reduced real disposable 
incomes. However, the resilience of private 

consumption during the downturn is clearly linked 

to the improved labour market situation and past 

income gains. As a result, Germany's growth 

composition has become considerably more 

balanced already during the crisis, with the current 

account surplus almost halving from close to 8% 

of GDP in 2007 to 4% of GDP in 2009. Moreover, 

after the protracted adjust
ment period in the 2000s, 
Germany's medium-term growth outlook is no 

longer hampered by major domestic imbalances. 
Labour market adjustments ahead Contrary to most other countries, the economic 

crisis so far had only a very limited impact on the 

German labour market. The unemployment rate 

has increased by less than 1 pp. since October 

2008 and employment initially kept growing even 

during the downturn. A number of factors have 

been responsible for this. First, companies took 

advantage of the increased use of flexible working 

time arrangements, cushioning the impact of the 

crisis by reducing overtime work and depleting 

working time accounts. Second, they resorted on a 

large scale to short-time wo
rk, especially since the 
German stimulus package increased the maximum 

duration of short-time work to 24 months and 

offered additional financial incentives to 

companies to use the scheme. Third, given the 

difficulties in hiring qualified workers during the 

2007/08 upswing, many companies proved 

reluctant to lay off work
ers prematurely. Fourth, 
past labour market reforms and wage moderation 

have arguably reduced structural unemployment in 

Germany. The adjustment to this lower level of 

unemployment was not yet fully completed at the 

beginning of the crisis. 
Nevertheless, the sharp contraction in economic 
activity combined with relatively stable 

employment levels has led to a sharp drop in 

productivity and an accomp
anying hike in nominal 
unit labour costs. This is hardly sustainable and 
companies will inevitably start to adjust their 
employment levels. Therefore, unemployment is 

set to increase noticeably we
ll into 2011, albeit to a 
much lesser degree than envisaged in the spring 

forecast. In this context, the challenge is to prevent 

the cyclical increase in unemployment from 

turning once again into
 higher structural 
unemployment. Thus, strengthening the capacity 

of the labour market to generate jobs during the 

upswing will be critical for sustaining the recovery 

of private consumption.

 Overcoming the crisis requires sustained rise in 
productivity–  For Germany, the unwinding of global imbalances 
after the crisis implies 
a number of challenges. 
With the process of deleveraging in full swing in 

countries with high curr
ent account deficits, the 
recovery of the German economy relies to a larger 

extent on domestic factors than in the past. This 

entails a number of structur
al changes, including a 
certain re-allocation of resources between sectors, 

which depends crucially on flexible product and 

factor markets. Particularly important for boosting 

potential output and sustaining high income 

growth would be a reversal of the observed trend 

of declining productivity growth. At the same 

time, the growth and employment opportunities in 

the services sector still appear to be largely 

untapped in Germany. 
–and a stable banking sector The German banking sector has come under severe 

strain from the financial and economic crisis. The 

capital base of financial institutions has been 

significantly weakened by losses and write-downs 

from investments in stru
ctured assets. Moreover, 
bank balance sheets could be burdened in the

This may impair the ability of banks to provide 

financing to the corporate and household sector. A 

successful economic recovery will therefore 

crucially depend on the stabilisation of the banking 

sector and securing access to finance by the 

corporate sector. 
Sound fiscal positions allowed budgetary 
expansion Benefiting from the balanced budgetary position in 
2008, the German authorities adopted a wide range 

of measures to counter the economic downturn, 

including measures to stabilise financial markets 

and a sizeable fiscal stimulus. At the same time, 

automatic stabilisers were allowed to operate fully 

(around 3% of GDP in 2009), including a massive 

increase in short-time work benefits.  
Consequently, the general government balance fell 
to a deficit of 3½% of GDP in 2009. The deficit is 

projected to increase furt
her in 2010 (5% of GDP) 
mainly on the back of substantial tax losses and 

measures in support of the economy. It is set to 

diminish in 2011 to 4½% of GDP as a result of the 

withdrawal of certain stimulus measures and with 

additional investment leveling off. Debt is 

projected to increase from almost 66% of GDP in 
2008 to close to 80% of GDP in 2011, fuelled by 
increasing deficits and financial market 

stabilisation measures. 
The budgetary situation after the recession will be 
complicated by the implicit shortfall in tax 

revenues and significantly higher expenditure. 

Uncertainties related to the strength of the 

recovery also pose a risk to
 public finances. At the 
same time, the new fiscal rule anchored in the 

German constitution, which prescribes a structural 

deficit ceiling of 0.35% of GDP for the Federal 

government as of 2016 Œ and a structurally 

balanced budget for the 
Länder
 as of 2020 Œ 
requires retrenchment from 2011 onwards with an 

additional structural effort estimated by the 

German authorities in the draft medium-term 

financial plan (2009-2013) of 0.2% of GDP 

annually. The main challenge will be to reconcile the 
necessary fiscal consolidation with the 

strengthening of the economy's long-term growth 

potential. A careful review of government 

expenditure, including the fiscal stimulus 

administered, the removal of subsidies potentially 

hindering structural adjustment, and safeguarding 

growth-enhancing spending should be conducive 

to higher potential growth. 
6. ESTONIA 
On a path of rapid adjustment 
 86 Convergence of recent years sharply reversed 
in the current downturn–  Estonia's years of rapid catching up, with growth at 
8½% on average between 2000 and 2007, gave 

way in 2008-9 to the deep
est economic contraction 
since the country's i
ndependence. Sizeable 
imbalances accumulated during the years of high 

growth, ultimately leading to a reversal of the 

cycle, which started with a contraction in domestic 

demand. Quarterly growth rates turned negative in 

early 2008 and, as the gl
obal loss of confidence in 
the second half of the year depressed external 

demand, the contraction in economic activity 

accelerated, reaching 3.6% in the year as a whole. 

The initially slow unravelling of accumulated 

imbalances reflected high price and wage inflation 

and a subdued labour market response. 
Significantly over-optimistic official growth 
assumptions, coupled with a sharp fall in revenue, 

resulted in a distinctly expansionary fiscal stance 

in 2008, which helped counter the worsening 

cyclical conditions. Despite the adoption of a 

restrictive supplementary budget in mid-2008, the 

headline deficit reached 
2.7% of GDP, following 
six years of nominal surpluses. 
The contraction continued in 2009 and the 
economy had shrunk by almost a fifth by mid-year 

compared to the high poin
t of the cycle in 2007. 
This was notably a reflection of the continued 

contraction in domestic demand, which had shrunk 

by 30% in the second quarter of the year compared 

to the same period of 2008. 
This was, in particular, 
due to a decline in fixed investment and de-

stocking, and a smaller but still sizeable fall in 

private consumption. Although contributing to the 

contraction to a lesser extent than domestic 

components, external demand also continued to act 

as a drag on the economy. Across sectors, the most 

pronounced decline was registered in construction 

and financial intermediation Œ formerly the 

backbone of high growth rates Œ and in 

manufacturing. The decline in domestic demand 

was mirrored in the pronounced fall in imports. 
Although there are some indications that the 
economy may have bottomed out during the 

summer months, there are 
no immediate prospects 
for quick recovery. Thus, even with a stabilisation 

in the last few months of the year, the overall 
output contraction is expected to approach 14% for 
2009 as a whole.

 ...but ongoing adjustment of the economy in 
2009 narrows imbalances In the context of Estonia's fixed exchange rate 
regime, the adjustment of
 the economy to correct 
the imbalances accumulated over the past years is 

largely taking place throug
h the labour market and 
in prices.  
After initial inertia Œ partly explained by the 
almost full employment achieved during the boom 

years Œ the adjustment 
in the labour market 
became very pronounced from the beginning of 

2009, with employment falling by over 7% in the 

first quarter and almost 2% in the second. 

Unemployment increased si
gnificantly throughout 
the year, with the seasonal
 pattern being affected 
by changes to the labour law since the summer. 

Wage growth, which had contributed to the erosion 

of cost competitiveness in
 recent years, turned 
negative during the same period. 
After the double-digit figu
res reached in spring 
2008 (11.6%), HICP inflation converged quickly 

towards the euro area av
erage and then turned 
negative in mid-2009, pulled down by a rapid fall 

in world commodity prices, the fading impact of 

earlier administrative price increases, as well as 

negative price pressure
 from weak domestic 
consumption. The latter's weakness also helped to 

limit the impact of a 2 
pps. increase in the VAT 
rate, which took effect from mid-year, but was 

partly absorbed in mark-ups. Inflation is expected 

to remain low in the forecast period, given the still 
Member States, Estonia 
  87 weak global economy 
and the low degree of 
capacity utilisation.  
The severe contraction in internal demand 
contributed to a sudden retrenchment of imports, 

resulting in a sharp move from the high current 

account deficits recorded until 2008 to surpluses in 

the first half of 2009. The main adjustment took 

place through a narrowing of the merchandise 
trade deficit and diminishing profits in companies 

with foreign ownership (reducing the net income 

deficit), while services continued to perform rather 

well during the downturn and transfer receipts 

related to EU structural funds grew further. 
Public sector also contributes to the 
rebalancing of the economy Given the need to correct significant external and 
internal imbalances, the Estonian authorities 

implemented an ambitious fiscal consolidation in 

2009. Their task becam
e increasingly more 
challenging, however, as in the face of the 

worsening economic situation the government 

implemented successive ambitious packages, 

amounting in total to over 8% of GDP.  
The very significant conso
lidation effort put in 
place in 2009 was achieved
 through a mixture of 
permanent and temporary measures, both on the 

revenue and expenditure sides. In particular, the 

reduction of the public sector wage bill has 

contributed positively to the unravelling of 

imbalances in the economy, while scaling down 

planned pension increases and other changes to the 

pension law will also improve sustainability of 

public finances in the medium term. On the 

revenue side, measures 
include increases in 
indirect and labour taxes and higher dividends 

from state-owned companies.
 The deficits in 2008 
and 2009 were largely financed by running down 

assets accumulated as a result of previous years' 

surpluses, so leading to an only modest increase in 

public debt. 
The consolidation effort is expected to bring the 
general government deficit to 3% of GDP in 2009, 

although there are significant risks surrounding 

this forecast, related to the possibility of higher 

unemployment growth and lower tax revenue, as 

well as to meeting targets on expenditure and non-

tax revenue. Hence, the possibility of a deficit 

above 3% in 2009 canno
t be excluded. These 
downward risks should be seen against the 

potential for a faster recovery and the 
determination of the authorities to ensure 
compliance with the Treaty deficit criterion. 
 The fiscal consolidation implemented so far, 
coupled with the ongoing modernisation of the 

public service, are expected to restrain expenditure 

growth going forward. At the same time, tax 

revenue is expected to be sluggish over the 

forecast period, even taki
ng into account already 
implemented and planned tax increases. As a 

result, in the absence of further steps in addition to 

those foreseen in the current draft budget, the 

deficit in 2010 is projected to increase to 

marginally above 3% and remain around 3% in 

2011. In view of the risks and of the need to reduce 

the deficit in a sustainable way, improving 

expenditure controls and th
e efficiency of public 
spending, as well as identifying additional revenue 

sources, could help to strengthen the fiscal position 

over the forecast period. General government debt, 

while increasing, is set to remain low, reaching 

13% of GDP in 2011. 
Recovery likely to be slow and initially 
supported by exports Although the decline in economic activity appears 
to have stabilised, there is little reason to expect a 

fast recovery. The preceding boom and subsequent 

bust have brought economic activity back to the 

levels of 2005 and have left the economy with a 

higher burden of external debt. Servicing this debt 

will be one of the factors weighing on the recovery 

of domestic demand in the medium term.  
While a modest recovery is expected in the coming 
quarters, growth is set to remain flat in 2010, with 

growth for the year as a whole turning positive 

only in 2011. Private consumption is not likely to 

support the recovery before 2011, given growing 

unemployment and declining nominal wages, even 

though consumer confidence is gradually 

strengthening. Likewise, fixed investment is not 

expected to start recoveri
ng before 2011, when the 
need to upgrade existing capacity will stimulate 

equipment investment in particular. However, 

some earlier positive impact can be expected from 

a turn in the stock cycle, as the confidence of 

companies strengthens and new orders show a 

stronger upward trend, taking into account the 

massive de-stocking that
 took place throughout 
2008 and 2009. 
With domestic demand flat, a modest positive 
growth impulse is expected in 2010 from external

market shares are unlik
ely to rise in 2010, 
improving competitiveness could lead to some 

increase in Estonia's shar
e in global trade from 
2011 onwards. 
Lower costs and higher productivity growth 
lead to improved competitiveness The competitiveness of exporting enterprises has 
benefitted from increased financial support made 

available through state programmes Œ in particular 
through EU structural funds Œ and via the banking 

sector. Such firms' expo
rting capacity is further 
reinforced by decreasing co
sts, as wage adjustment 
is already taking place and is expected to continue 

for some time, given the very flexible labour 

market, recently strengthened by the modernised 

Labour Law. Higher productivity growth is also 

expected to boost competitiveness. Ongoing efforts 

to further raise labour skills are helping to 

strengthen human capital efficiency and support a 

shift to more sophisticated exports. The 

counterparts to the increased capital formation in 

the tradable sector Œ supporting higher productivity 

growth Œ include increased domestic saving and 

recovering inward investment. Here, the financial 

sector is expected to play a key role in providing 

and facilitating the necessary
 financing in the right 
sectors. Despite the deteriorating quality of loan 
portfolios, the banking sector remains stable and 
well capitalised. 
7. IRELAND 
Significant domestic adjustment underlying a gradual recovery 
 89 Economic adjustment and policy response in 
2008  The global economic and financial crisis has 
aggravated what started as a home-grown 

downturn and turned it into a protracted recession. 

After over a decade of 
strong economic growth 
that had been increasingly driven by domestic 

demand, a sharp adjustment from its 2006 peak 

started in the Irish housing market and has since 

spread to the wider economy. This development 

was amplified by the decline in global demand and 

especially by the recessi
on in Ireland's main 
trading partners (euro area, US and UK). Similarly, 

the international financial crisis contributed to the 

deepening of the downturn, given the weight of the 

financial services sector in the Irish economy and 

banks' high dependence on foreign wholesale 

funding. The economy entered recession in 2008, 

with real GDP falling by 3% over the year. The 

downturn has also produced a dramatic 

deterioration in the Irish public finances, with a 

large general government deficit emerging and 

feeding into a projected 
steep increase in debt.  
Against this background, Ireland's policy response 
to the crisis has focused 
on containing the fiscal 
imbalances, while also providing support to the 

weakened financial sector, 
inter alia
 through 
guarantees and capital injections. In line with the 

European Economic Recove
ry Plan, and within the 
constraints of the medium-run consolidation 

strategy, Ireland also adop
ted a modest package of 
measures to support economic activity.  
Domestic demand is rebalancing A large drop in real GDP 
is expected in 2009, 
followed by a smaller decline in 2010, before 

positive growth resumes in 2011. The recession 

continues to be driven by domestic demand. In 

particular, the strong fall in employment and 

incipient nominal wage d
eclines are taking their 
toll on household disposable income, despite the 

fall in domestic prices and the increase in social 

transfers. Togeth
er with a significant rise in 
precautionary savings, influenced by households' 

negative employment expectations, this is 

projected to lead 
in 2009 to the strongest decline in 
real private consumption expenditure in over 25 

years. As the pace of deterioration in the labour 

market slows in 2010, this should also be reflected 
in somewhat more benign developments in 
consumption, although the adjustment of 

accumulated imbalances in household balance 

sheets, reflecting in particular their past over-

investment in housing, should continue.  
In the aftermath of the bursting of the housing 
market bubble, gross fixed capital formation is 

expected to further contract by nearly one third in 

2009 and one sixth in 2010 before returning to 

moderate growth in 2011. The ongoing downsizing 

of the construction sector is a major determinant of 

the contraction, and is expected to continue well 

into 2010. On the back of subdued demand 

developments, equipment and machinery 

investment is also declining substantially but might 

pick up in the course of 2010 as prospects for 

global demand and the domestic economy 

improve. Given the need to consolidate the public 

finances, no support can be expected from public 

investment, which should show a marked decline 

in 2009, followed by smaller falls in 2010-2011. 
Driven exclusively by the good performance of the 
Œ relatively acyclical Œ chemical and 

pharmaceutical goods sect
or, Ireland's exports 
have held up remarkably well in the crisis and are 

only expected to record a fairly moderate decline 

in 2009 Œ the smallest 
in the euro area. They 
should expand again in th
e following years. At the 
same time, the strong declines in private 

consumption and investment expected in 2009 

should translate into a marked fall in imports, 

implying a strong positive contribution of external 

trade to GDP growth. The contribution of net 

exports should be smaller but stay positive in the 

remaining years of the forecast horizon, thereby 

contributing to the gradual narrowing of the 

current account deficit.  
As regards risks to the baseline scenario, net 
exports could suffer from a slower recovery in the 

main trading partners or from further appreciation 

of the euro vis-à-vis th
e USD and GBP, to which 
Irish exports are particular
ly exposed. At the same 
time, the composition of exports, which allowed 

for their resilience in the downturn, might dampen 

their growth in an upswing. Concerning the public 

finance forecast, the bulk (a
round 4.3% of GDP) of the consolidation effort for 2010 and 2011 

announced in the April 2009 supplementary budget 

has not been taken into account in the forecast as 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  90 the underlying measures are still to be specified in 
the annual budgets (the exception is the announced 

retrenchment of public investment); the budget for 

2010 will be presented in December 2009. 

Depending on the specific consolidation measures 

that are eventually implemented, a dampening 

effect on domestic demand cannot be excluded. On 

the upside, a faster pace 
of sectoral adjustment 
than assumed might provide support to 

consumption and investment demand.

pps.
 Unemployment rising steeply The pace of recovery will depend crucially on the 
speed at which imbalances accumulated in the past 

can be corrected. This includes the domestic 

rebalancing of economic activity from construction 

to more productive sectors, regaining 

competitiveness, cleaning up private and corporate 

balance sheets, and far-reaching fiscal 

consolidation. 
At the peak of the housin
g market cycle in 2006, 
the construction sector accounted for over 13% of 

total employment, compared to below 8% in the 

euro area. The ongoing downsizing of the housing 

market and the contraction in overall activity are 

reflected in a large declin
e in employment in 2009. 
This adjustment is expected to continue, albeit less 

markedly, in the following years. In response to 

worsening labour market conditions, people have 

started to withdraw fro
m the labour force, as 
evidenced by a fall in the participation rate. At the 

same time, after the significant inward migration 

flows of the last few years, net outward migration 

is now expected as Irish and immigrant workers 

seek job opportunities elsewhere. Despite this, the 

unemployment rate should rise further and peak at 

around 14% in 2010, with young and low-skilled 

workers being hardest hit.  
Downward price and wage adjustment helps to regain competitiveness Over the past few years, Ireland has suffered 
significant losses in comp
etitiveness, as reflected 
in a strong rise in unit labour cost since 2002. The 

Irish price level was among the highest in the euro 

area in recent years and a 
downward adjustment of 
prices is currently taking place, driven partly by 

negative base effects in commodity prices but also 

by downward revisions of profit margins in the 

context of weak domestic demand. Led by 

developments in the public sector, there also 

appears to have been a reduction in nominal wages 

in the private sector in 2009, albeit by less than 

expected earlier. Adequate changes in relative 

prices would further support resource reallocation 

towards the tradables sect
or. These adjustments are 
projected to continue ov
er the forecast horizon, 
thus helping to reverse the past competitiveness 

losses and in turn strengthening the potential 

growth contribution of the external sector. 

Productivity growth, which had declined over the 

past few years, should pi
ck up somewhat as the 
construction sector shrinks, thus contributing 

further to the adjustment. 
Regaining competitiveness will be important also 
given that balance sheet adjustments should 

continue to weigh on domestic demand over the 

next years. The projected increase in households' 

savings rate reflects not only precautionary 

motives but also the need to reduce indebtedness, 

after household debt as a share in GDP had 

doubled between 2001 and 2007 in the context of 

the housing boom. Corporate demand for 

investment credit should also moderate in the short 

term, while bank deleveraging in the aftermath of 

the financial sector crisis might weigh on credit 

supply. It is expected that the measures for the 

financial sector that have been put in place and 

announced by the government should facilitate an 

orderly restructuring process. In particular, a 

National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) has 

been set up to purchase impaired assets from banks 

operating in Ireland in order to revive commercial 

banking operations.  
Focus on fiscal consolidation The domestic property ma
rket correction and the 
financial crisis have taken a heavy toll on Ireland's 

public finances. Starting from mid-2008, the 

government implemented deficit-reducing 

measures estimated to amount to 4½% of GDP in 

2009. Nevertheless, the general government deficit

     91 is expected to widen in 2009 beyond the target set 
in the April 2009 supplementary budget (10¾% of 

GDP), largely due to weaker tax revenue growth 

than expected. Based on
 the no-policy-change 
assumption, a further worsening of the deficit is 

projected over the forecast horizon.  
In 2009, a series of ta
x-increasing measures 
moderated the revenue decline which followed the 

severe economic downturn and ongoing 

adjustment in housing market. In 2010-11, tax 

revenue developments are in line with expected 

economic growth, while also reflecting the full-

year effect of measures ta
ken in the course of 2009 
(as well as the disappearance of some deficit-

reducing one-off measures in 2009). The shift 

away from tax-rich domestic demand-driven 

growth to export-led growth, with sluggish 

employment and consumption growth, would lead 

to only a moderate tax revenue increase once the 

economic recovery takes hold.  
Total expenditure is set to broadly stabilise in 
2009. While there is a 
significant increase in 
unemployment-related spending and in debt-

service costs, the consolidation measures taken so 

far have resulted in a decline in other expenditure 

categories. In particular, public investment will 

decline by 24% compared 
to 2008. The relatively 
low expenditure growth, by around 2½% in 2010-
11, results from the pay freeze in the public sector 
in 2010 and the implementation of the capital 

expenditure cuts announced in the April 2009 

supplementary budget. Social benefits should 

reflect the growing number of recipients, while 

welfare rates are assumed to be flat in the negative 

inflation environment of 2010, but increase by the 

rate of inflation in 2011. 
A combination of the large primary deficits, rising 
interest expenditure and, until 2010, falling 

nominal GDP, should lead to a rise in the debt 

ratio to around 96% of GDP by 2011. In line with 

the 19 October 2009 preliminary view of 

Eurostat (84)
, the bonds (around 30% of GDP) 
expected to be issued by the Special Purpose 

Vehicle associated to the NAMA to finance the 

purchase of loan books from certain financial 

institutions are not recorded as government debt, 

while the majority of those bonds are guaranteed 

by the Irish State. Still, the interaction between 

deficit and debt dynamics on the one hand and low 

nominal growth on the other underlines the 

importance of fiscal consolidation.

8. GREECE 
Economic downturn chall
enges public finances 
 92 Economic adjustment and policy response Having experienced a decade of strong economic 
growth of 4% on average, the Greek economy 

entered a recessionary phase in 2009. The 

accumulation of growing and long-term persistent 

domestic and external imbalances was accelerated 

by the unfolding of the ongoing crisis, weighing on 

the sustainability of the real convergence process 

in the long run. Both consumer and business 

confidence were strongly 
hit, weakening economic 
activity in 2008 and weighing on medium-term 

prospects. Although it reacted later than in other 

countries, GDP growth decelerated strongly in 

2008, growing at only 2% compared with 4½% in 

2007. The downturn is already taking a heavy toll 

on public finances. Tax revenue started to weaken 

in late 2008, while government debt financing 

became more challenging and more expensive, 

putting further pressure on the fragile budget.

 Given the lack of room for manoeuvre, no 
expansionary fiscal policy response to the crisis 

was adopted within the EERP. However, a number 

of temporary measures were implemented in late 

2008 and 2009, aimed at supporting vulnerable 

social groups and the sector
s most hit by the crisis. 
In addition, although the direct impact of the 

financial crisis on the banking sector has been 

relatively contained, mainly thanks to the limited 

exposure of the Greek banks to high risk financial 

investments, a series of measures was 

implemented to safeguard the stability of the 

sector.  Flat growth in 2010 Œ mild recovery in 2011 The outlook is for real GDP to remain almost flat 

in 2010, before recovering mildly in 2011. Credit 

expansion, although still positive, should remain 

sluggish on the back of tighter credit conditions 

and high household indebtedness.
 Moreover, 
falling employment growth, declining wages and 

lower non-labour income growth should weigh on 

disposable income over the medium-term, putting 

a brake on real demand. In view of the highly 

uncertain environment, the households saving rate 

might increase, leading to further pressure on 

consumption growth. As a result, private 

consumption is projected 
to contract by 1¼% in 
2010, while returning to positive growth rates by 

the end of the forecast horizon. 
Negative prospects and tightening credit 
conditions are also expected to worsen profit 

expectations and discourage investment. Gross 

fixed capital formation continued to fall markedly 

in 2009, on the back of both housing and 

equipment investment retrenchment. In spite of the 

government's attempt to accelerate the execution 

of public investment and projects through Public 

Private Partnerships (PPP) in 2009, only a few of 

these projects have as yet started. Public 

investment activity however, is expected to resume 

in 2010 and to continue to rise in 2011. Investment 

should decline further in 2010 before showing 

some positive signs by the end of 2011, reflecting 

the continuing downsizing of the housing sector 

and the contraction in corporate investment. 
The contraction in domestic demand is expected to 
continue in 2010, mirrored also by shrinking 

imports, which are projected to continue falling by 

around 3% in real terms. Total exports, in turn, 

should recover mildly in 2010, after the significant 

fall recorded in 2009, la
rgely because of more 
favourable world demand prospects. Exports of 

goods should rise by almost 2½% in 2010 and 

increase further in 2011, wh
ile exports of services 
- in particular world trade sensitive merchant 

shipping and tourist recei
pts - should return to 
positive territory. All in all, the contribution of net 

exports to GDP growth should be positive both in 

2010 and to a lesser extent in 2011, mainly due to 

the ongoing fall in imports, which goes well 

beyond that implied by historical elasticities.  
Member States, Greece 
  93 The contraction of economic activity is weighing 
heavily on employment which is set to fall by 

some 2% over the forecast horizon. This will push 

the unemployment rate up to around 10¼% and 

11% in 2010 and 2011, respectively.  
The main risks to this baseline scenario are quite 
balanced. On the positive side, the resurgence of 

both consumer and business confidence and the 

gradual improvement of liquidity and 

capitalisation of Greek banks may help to sustain 

credit expansion at modest levels, which could 

underpin private consumption and ease the 

adjustment of the housing sector. In addition, if the 

fall in domestic output is not proportionate to the 

decline in demand, the increase in net exports may 

compensate more for the fall in domestic demand, 

leading to a higher contribution of net exports to 

GDP growth than assumed. On the negative side, a 

sharper fall in external demand would weigh more 

on economic activity. Moreover, within a context 

of tighter credit conditions, external financing 

could prove less benign and so the servicing of 

Greece's fast-rising external debt might crowd out 

domestic spending.  
Sustained recovery implies correcting domestic and external imbalances–  The significant progress made by Greece in terms 
of real convergence over the last decade may be 

considerably challenged. Bringing the Greek 

economy back to a sust
ained convergence path 
involves the prompt identification and correction 

of the factors underlying the widening domestic 

and external imbalances. 
The developments in th
e external sector are 
expected to lead to a significant correction of the 

external deficit in 2010. 
Nevertheless, the expected 
improvement over the medium term is likely to be 

much more moderate, given the structural 

weaknesses of the external performance of the 

economy. Notably, the cu
rrent account deficit, 
although improving, may 
still account for almost 
8% of GDP by 2011. In a context of weak growth 

in both real and nominal terms, external constraints 

are becoming more severe and should eventually 

lead to a serious adjustment.  
Mounting competitiveness losses over the last 
decade are reflected in th
e sizeable appreciation of 
the real effective exchange rate (REER) based on 

unit labour costs. The rapid rise of wage costs and 

mark-ups in excess of productivity growth, as well 
as the persistence of the inflation differential with 
the euro area, has contributed to a wage-price 

spiral. While nominal compensation per employee 

is set to increase by ab
out 2¼% in 2009, HICP 
inflation is projected to remain close to 1% in 

2009, resulting in high real wage growth, well 

above productivity growth. The disconnection 

between wages and labour-market conditions and 

productivity developments, including the weak 

response of wages growth to the current downturn, 

are set to continue in the medium-term, thus 

undermining further the competitive position of the 

economy. The promotion of productivity, together 

with appropriate wage developments, would help 

to regain lost competitiveness. Although current 

inflation rates are low, they are projected to 

quickly return to an upwa
rd trend over the forecast 
period. Core inflation should also rise more rapidly 

than the euro area average,
 also reflecting the poor 
functioning of domestic
 markets, especially 
services.  
–and adjusting public finances. The persistent deterioration of external imbalances 

reflects both rising investment and falling savings. 

The private and public sector
s have alternated over 
time as the driving force of this deterioration, with 

the share of general government de-savings having 

markedly increased in th
e most recent years. The 
ongoing crisis, however, has the potential to make 

these imbalances unsustainable in the medium-

term, with obvious implications for the financing 

of the large external and public deficits.  
As public revenue depends strongly on indirect 
taxation and customs, weak consumption and 

decreasing imports translate swiftly into lower tax 

receipts and significant 
revenue shortfalls. In 
addition, the economic downturn is burdening 

social protection expenditu
re, leading to a further 
fiscal deterioration. With the general government 

deficit well above 3% of GDP on average over the 

current decade, and the accumulation of large debt-

increasing below-the-line operations, public debt is 

quickly returning to levels well above 100% of 

GDP, which will raise the cost of financing 

government debt. This would not only render the 

financing of any additional issuance more 

expensive, but would also increase the cost of 

refinancing the existing stock of public debt. 
The 2008 general government deficit notified by 
the Greek authorities in October 2009 stands at 

7¾% of GDP, higher by 2¾% percentage points of

    94 GDP than the previous notification made in April 
2009. Eurostat expressed a reservation on the 

figures reported by Gr
eece on 21 October 2009 
and did not validate the data 
(85). Any upward 
revision in the 2008 deficit figure would mainly be 

due to higher public expenditure, which had not 

been recorded in the previous notifications 

according to the Greek au
thorities. The notified 
expenditure figure includes a one-off capital 

expenditure of around 1¼ p.p. of GDP, related to 

past years' general government liabilities to the 

private sector, mainly public hospitals' arrears to 

the suppliers of parame
dical and pharmaceutical 
procurement.  
For 2009, the official public deficit estimate stands 
at 12½% of GDP, compar
ed with the budgetary 
target of 3.7% of GDP included in the January 

2009 update of the stability programme. On the 

expenditure side, a number of one-off expenditures 

mainly related to arrears to hospitals' suppliers 

amounting to around 1½ percentage points of GDP 

have been included. Taking into account relevant 

information provided by the Greek authorities, and 

the budget implementation cash-data over the first 
                                                          
 (85) Eurostat (news release 149/2009) has expressed a 
reservation on the data re
ported by Greece on 21 October 
2009, due to significant uncertainties over the figures 
notified by the Greek st
atistical authorities.  nine months, the general government deficit in 
2009 is expected to reach 12¾% of GDP. The 

Commission services' projection also includes the 

impact of measures announced in the 2009 budget 

law, the January 2009 update of the stability 

program and in the fiscal package of March 2009. 

However, the measures presented in June 2009 but 

not implemented in the course of the year, have not 

been taken into account in the projection for 2009. 
Under a no-policy-change scenario assumption and 
on the back of the discontinuation of one-off 

expenditure realised in 2009, the headline deficit 

should remain above 12% of GDP in 2010 and 

increase further over the forecast horizon, 

exceeding 12¾% of GDP by 2011. Both falling 

revenue-to-GDP and rising expenditure-to-GDP 

ratios will contribute to this fiscal deterioration.  
The economic downturn, coupled with high budget 
deficits, is expected to push debt higher, from 

112½% of GDP in 2009 to over 135% of GDP by 

2011, thus weakening 
the already fragile 
sustainability of Greek public finances in the long 

term. 
9. SPAIN 
A protracted economic adjustment ahead 
 95 Economic adjustment and policy response in 
2009 More than a decade of sustained and strong 
economic expansion in Spain 
came to an end in the 
second half of 2008. The accumulation of external 

imbalances, a high degree of household 

indebtedness, an oversized housing sector, and 

persistent competitiveness losses had prompted an 

adjustment of the economy which started in 2007, 

in terms of saving and investment balances and a 

rebalancing of the contribution of domestic 

demand to GDP growth. GDP
 actually contracted 
in the second half of 2008 and in the first half of 

2009. The Spanish economy is expected to 

continue to post negative growth in the third and 

fourth quarters of the y
ear, although the pace of 
contraction should ease. In 2009 as a whole, 

economic activity is estimated to have fallen by 

3¾% compared to a still positive growth of 0.9% 

in 2008. 
The downturn took a heavy toll on both jobs and 
public finances, which may result in high long-

term unemployment and a sharp worsening of the 

long-term sustainability of public finances. 

Domestic demand is estimated to show a sharp 

fall, driven by a significant contraction in both 

investment - especially housing - and private 

consumption. Exports and more especially imports 

are estimated to post very high falls. As a result, 

domestic demand should drag GDP growth down 

by more than 6½ pps. this year, compared to a 

negative contribution of just ¾ pp. last year. 
The policy response in Spain has been twofold. On 
the one hand, expansionary fiscal measures to 

stimulate the economy were adopted in line with 

the European Economic Recovery Plan. The fiscal 

stimulus Œ aimed at enhancing infrastructure and 

supporting households and businesses Œ has 

amounted to about 2½% of GDP in 2009. On the 

other hand, although the direct impact of the 

financial crisis on the Spanish banking sector has 

been relatively contained, owing mainly to a sound 

system of dynamic provisions set by the Bank of 

Spain, a series of measures was implemented to 

support the financial sector in its current process of 

productivity enhancement. 
Slow economic recovery and decelerating job 
destruction over the forecast horizon The outlook features a further contraction, albeit 
much smaller, of the economy in 2010, when it is 

projected to fall by around ¾%, followed by a 

moderate recovery of 1% in 2011. Overall, 

domestic demand is projected to reduce GDP 

growth in 2010 by around 1¾ pps., before starting 

to make a small positive contribution of ¾ pp. in 

2011. This projection is mainly based on weak 

private consumption and still shrinking investment. 

Specifically, private consump
tion is set to contract 
by ½% in 2010 and to increase by nearly 1% in 

2011. 
The protracted fall in employment is set to induce 
slow growth in disposable income, both in nominal 

terms, thus affecting households' balance-sheet 

ratios, and in real terms, with an obvious impact on 

real demand, and thus leading to an increase in 

precautionary saving. In addition, access to 

consumer credit remains more difficult than in the 

past, due not only to tight credit conditions 

imposed by financial institutions, but also to high 

household indebtedness. Sluggish disposable 

income growth is projected to take place despite 

nominal wage growth above inflation, lower 

mortgage burdens, consistent with falling interest 

rates, and the impact of a partial extension into 

2010 of the 2009 Local Investment Fund, which is 

expected to bring some additional labour income. 

The saving rate of households may reach a level 

close to 19% of gross disp
osable income in 2009, 
which compares with about 10% in 2007. 
Gross fixed capital formation is set to keep on 
falling in 2010 and in 2011, albeit at a slower pace. 

Excess supply in the construction sector, where a 

considerable stock of new houses remains unsold, 

is expected to face a diminishing demand, driven 

by negative demographic developments. As a 

result, the adjustment process in the construction 

sector is projected to take longer than expected. 

Construction should contract further - by more 

than 10% in 2010 and almost 4% in 2011 - driven 

by a slimming down of the production capacity in 

housing construction of 16% in 2010 and 6¼% in 

2011, which will help to reduce the large unsold 

dwellings stock. However, while equipment 

investment should still post a contraction in 2010, 

albeit at a lower pace, improving economic 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  96 prospects are assumed to l
ead to mild growth by 
2011. The projected fa
ll in infrastructure 
investment in 2010, reflecting a partial reversal of 

the 2009 Local Investment Fund, will contribute to 

the contraction of other construction over the 

forecast horizon. Graph II.9.1:

Domestic demand + inventories
Net exports
GDP (y-o-y%)
forecast
 In the external sector, imports are expected to 
shrink less markedly in 2010 and to return to 

positive growth in 2011 in line with final demand. 

Exports are projected to s
how a limited recovery in 
the medium term, reflecting not only weak world 

demand, but also a continued deterioration in 

competitiveness. Exports of goods and services 

should increase in 2010 and 2011 by around 1¼% 

and 3¼% respectively. All in all, the positive 

contribution of net exports to GDP growth is 

forecast to decrease in 
both 2010 and 2011. 
In the current context of external financing 
constraints, with a primary income deficit that 

remains at around 4%, the cushioning of the real 

GDP decline at the expense of significant public 

sector dissaving may require domestic financing. 

This financing could come from higher saving 

ratios or from a further contraction in investment, 

thus weighing on real GDP growth over the 

medium term. 
The contraction in economic activity, which 
particularly affects labour-intensive sectors, 

continues to weigh heavily on employment, which 

is projected to suffer a cumulative fall of some 2¾ 

in 2010 and 2011. Despite a projected easing in 

population growth and in labour force, the 

unemployment rate is forecast to rise to just above 

20% of the labour force in 2011.  
The present outlook represents a baseline scenario, 
which is subject to a nu
mber of risks that are 
considered to be broadly balanced. The fall in 
interest rates, the record lows of inflation 
outcomes, and some growth in wages could boost 

disposable income and confidence, thus 

strengthening private consumption and softening 

the adjustment of the housing sector. Private 

consumption might also receive an extra impulse 

should the household saving rate, which is at a 

historical high, stagnate or even fall back. In 

addition, imports may continue to be very sensitive 

to final demand as they were in late 2008 and early 

2009, leading to a higher contribution from net 

exports to GDP growth over the forecast horizon. 
On the other hand, the still subdued employment 
prospects and currently high unemployment rates 

might contribute to a further reduction in 

confidence and household expenditure. In addition, 

some of the recent fiscal
 measures announced in 
the 2010 Budged Law, such as the elimination of 

tax rebates and the VAT increases, might also have 

a negative impact on private consumption. At the 

same time, a tightening of credit conditions would 

further constrain private investment. A lower-than-

expected recovery of external demand would 

certainly weigh more heavily on economic activity 

than was projected in the baseline scenario. 

Finally, an increase in mortgage defaults could 

undermine balance sheet repair in banks with high 

exposure to the real es
tate sector, which might 
have an adverse impact on the real economy. 
Correction of imbalances would help to restore 
sustained convergence  The challenge of bringi
ng the Spanish economy 
back to a sustained convergence path could be 

successfully secured if the recovery were to lead 

not only to a rebalancing of domestic demand but 

also to higher export growth and to underpinning 

higher potential growth. 
Due to the strong decelera
tion of activity in 2009, 
the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP 

is projected to fall from 9.5% in 2008 to around 

5¼% in 2009. However, over the medium term, 

the expected improvement is likely to be more 

moderate, given Spain's current nominal GDP 

growth, which is low by historical standards. 

Notably, the current acco
unt may still reach some 
4¼% of GDP by 2011.  
All in all, the total borr
owing needs of the country 
are projected to remain
 relatively high. The 
negative net investment position has continued to 

feed the deficit in the 
primary incomes account, 
Member States, Spain 
  97 and the trade balance has persistently been in red 
territory, which partially reflects a steady 

deterioration in the country's competitive position. 
Competitiveness could be recovered through 
wage moderation,– The deterioration in competitiveness is due to a 
wide range of factors. Competitiveness losses are 

partially driven by a weak response of wages to the 

current recession. Nominal wages do not seem to 

be adjusting fully to labour market conditions, 

while job losses and unemployment are sharply 

rising. In addition, imbalances in the job market, 

namely high segmentation and inadequate 

bargaining mechanisms, can lead, as in the past, to 

a significant increase in 
long-term unemployment, 
thus reducing the potential growth of the Spanish 

economy. The activation of indexation clauses, in 

line with the high inflation rate recorded last year, 

implies that nominal wages have been growing at 

rates above the euro area average and above the 

expected inflation rate resulting in an increase of 

real wage growth. After 
recording 3¾% growth in 
2009 on the back
 of falling real GDP, the pace of 
growth of real compensation per employee is 

projected to decelerate to
 1¾% in 2010, which is 
still above productivity growth. This disconnection 

between wages and productivity developments is 

undermining the competitive position of the 

Spanish economy. In 2010, the REER based on 

unit labour costs is projected to appreciate by over 

1¾%.  
–productivity enhancement... Productivity growth in Spain has been sluggish 

during the last decade (around ½% on average). 

This mirrors a relatively high allocation of 

investment to the construction sector and some 

low-productivity services. Although measured 

productivity is estimated to increase in 2009 by 

5½%, thus above the euro area average, this is 

mainly due to the sharp contraction of the above-

mentioned activities rather than a significant 

improvement in the structural drivers of total 

factor productivity. Consequently, over the 

medium term, once the adjustment of these low-

productivity sectors is over, productivity gains 

might be more limited. Over the forecast period, 

productivity is projected to
 decelerate to around ¾ 
on average in 2010 and 2011. Therefore, the 

challenge is to enhance innovation and investment 

by firms, enhance permanent training of workers, 

and to encourage competition. 
–and inflation control Although inflation rates are estimated to be 

slightly negative in 2009, they are projected to 

return to positive territory next year, when 

inflation should reach ¾%. In this respect, the 

prices of oil and other commodities in international 

markets represent a significant source of 
uncertainty. In addition, inflation should reach 2% 

over the forecast horizon, thus not closing the 

competitiveness gap with the rest of the euro area, 

and reflecting poor functioning product markets, 

especially services. Restoring the long term sustainability of public 
finances The economic downturn, which has significantly 
reduced the tax intensity of the economy and 

significantly increased soci
al protection needs, has 
led to both rapidly falling revenue-to-GDP and 

rising expenditure-to-GDP ratios, in turn resulting 

in a sharp deterioration 
in the public accounts in 
2009. Total revenues are estimated to fall by 3 pps.

     98 assessment of measures on the revenue side, the 
deficit is projected to reach 10¼% of GDP in 

2010. Based on the customary unchanged-policy 

assumption, the 2011 deficit is forecast at 9¼% of 

GDP. With such a downturn in GDP and high 

public deficits, the government debt is set to 

increase from 39¾% of GDP in 2008 to 74% of 

GDP by 2011. Thus, there is a risk of weakening 

the long-term sustainability of the public finances. 
Public finances in Spain are likely to face a 
relatively long period of subdued tax revenues, 

reflecting from a less tax-friendly growth 

composition associated with the fading out of the 

asset boom, which is expected to be partially 

compensated for by the revenue-increasing 

discretionary measures included in the 2010 

Budget Law. Social contributions may also be 

lower over the medium term because of shrinking 

employment. Enhancing total public receipts 

without distorting economic agents' incentives 

constitutes an important challenge. 
The sharp increase in expenditures projected for 
this year and next reflects the functioning of 

automatic stabilisers, and especially higher 

unemployment benefits, as well as the higher 

burden of interest payments
 associated with rising 
debt levels. Given the likely negative impact of the 

crisis on potential growth and the associated rise in 
long-term unemployment, promoting a swift 
transition into employment, while still reining in 

public expenditures and ensuring social cohesion, 

pose another challenge for the social protection 

system. In addition, structural problems linked to 

population ageing, especially with regards to the 

pension and health care systems, are set to 

undermine fiscal sustainability.  
Against this setting, reducing budget deficits is key 
to boost confidence of eco
nomic agents and lead to 
a retrenchment of productive investment and 

consumption. Increasing public saving and 

improving competitiveness would enhance 

economic growth, and job creation, while 

mitigating the existing structural domestic and 

external imbalances. 
10. FRANCE 
Storm successfully weathered, uneven recovery underway 
 99 Recession and policy response The global financial crisis has dragged France into 
a recession that will have a protracted impact on its 

economy. GDP, which had been growing relatively 

robustly for several years, lost its dynamism in the 

course of 2008 and collapsed in the fourth quarter 

of that year and in the first quarter of 2009 (falling 

by -1.4% in both periods). In the second quarter of 

2009 it picked up again 
by a strong +0.3%. The 
French banking system has been resilient, mainly 

due to the predominance of retail banking and 

relatively sound balance 
sheets in the corporate 
sector and the financial sector. Still, the confidence 

crisis in the banking sector has entailed a 

tightening of liquidity and lending conditions. 

Moreover, the free fall in world trade has taken its 

toll on the French economy.  
Fiscal policy, together with the monetary policy 
implemented by the ECB, has aimed at containing 

the economic downturn and have added to the 

sizeable impact of au
tomatic stabilisers. 
Specifically, a recovery plan amounting to around 

1¼% of GDP has been implemented. Its impact 

was already starting to be felt in the second quarter 

of 2009, most notably in the automotive industry, 

and is expected to last until the beginning of 2010. 

The plan consists mainly of public investment and 

support to firms. Furthermore, cuts in the local 

business tax have recently been proposed, and 

these should encourage in
vestment decisions from 
2010 onwards. In addition, the French authorities 

have also announced an investment programme, 

which is aimed at financing spending to stimulate 

potential growth and, wh
ich will probably be 
financed through debt issuance (ﬁ
Grand 
Empruntﬂ); its impact on public finances is still 
unknown. In the wake of massive state 

intervention and compared to the end of 2008, 

spreads are smaller, lending criteria are less tight 

and interest rates have gradually diminished.  
The role played by automatic stabilisers The recovery in economic 
activity in the second 
quarter of 2009 is set to last, with GDP growth 

positive throughout the second half of 2009. 

However, it is not likely to be so smooth in 2010 

as a consequence of the interaction of the 

stabilisation of global trade and the stimulus 

measures, on the one hand, and the weak domestic 
demand on the other. Overall, GDP is expected to 
fall by 2.2% in 2009. However, the recession has 

been less steep than in many neighbouring 

countries and the euro area as a whole. The 

resilience of domestic demand has played a 

prominent role: private consumption has slowed 

markedly but has remained positive (+0.3% q-o-q 

during the second quar
ter of 2009). Real 
disposable income is expected to increase slightly 

over 2009 given that the drop in earned income, 

notably due to the substantial foreseeable increase 

in unemployment and the drop in income from 

other sources (such as financial assets and real 

estate), should be more than compensated by the 

fall in inflation and the incr
ease in public transfers. 
Whereas the relatively large size of the public 

sector compared to other 
euro area countries might 
have played a strong stabilising role in the current 

downturn, it could turn out to be a reason for a less 

dynamic pick-up. In particular, social contributions 

that help finance the state expenditures could 

weigh on the employment rate and harm 

competitiveness. Other factors can also help to 

explain the relative resilience of the economy, such 

as the smaller degree of openness and the size of 

the manufacturing sector, which is not as 

specialized in investment goods as is the case in 

other large neighbouring countries such as 

Germany or Italy.

 Production has bottomed out and is showing signs 
of recovery, notably thanks to temporary measures 

in favour of the automotive industry in France but 

also in other EU countries. However, the uncertain 

demand outlook and the underutilisation of 

production capacities, combined with widespread 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  100 declines in profits and the need for firms to 
strengthen their balance sheets, do not bode well 

for productive investment. After having shrunk 

sharply in 2009, it is expected to recover timidly in 

the course of 2010 before growing again in 2011. 

Public investment, boosted by the recovery plan, 

will somewhat cushion the drop in construction 

sector activity.  
Following a general fall in activity, world demand 
for French products has declined substantially in 

2009 for both goods and se
rvices. Indeed, even if 
France is not a particularly export-oriented 

country, two-thirds of
 its exports go to the 
European Union, which is strongly affected by the 

current recession. Exports are thus set to drop by a 

double-digit figure. In a context of positive private 

and public consumption growth, import growth is 

likely to diminish but by less than exports. Net 

trade in volume terms is projected to have a 

negative contribution to growth in 2009. The 

current account balance, however, is set to 

improve in 2009 as a consequence of the 

improvement in the terms of trade. 
HICP inflation is expected to bottom out in the 
third quarter of 2009 at a rate below but close to 

zero and become positive in the fourth, mostly 

driven by the base effect
s associated with last 
year™s sharp price increases caused by food and 

energy inflation. Consumer
 prices are projected to 
be stable in 2009 and to increase again in 2010 and 

2011 (by 1.1% and 1.4%, respectively). 
This scenario is subject to both positive and 
negative risks. On the positive side, a more 

vigorous EU recovery would boost the demand for 

French products, leading to a strong positive 

contribution of exports to growth. This could go 

hand in hand with an early end of the destocking 

phase prompted by the downturn. Negative risks 

would imply another trough in activity caused by a 

drop in domestic demand as a consequence of the 

end of negative inflation and its impact on real 

disposable income in a context of a deteriorating 

labour market. This drop in domestic demand 

could occur in a context of increased tightening of 

credit conditions
.  Benefitting from the expected pick-up in world 
demand While its relatively low degree of trade openness 
has helped France to weather the storm, the French 

economy may not fully benefit from the 
foreseeable pick-up of world trade without some 
structural adjustment. The 
combination of a rather 
sustained domestic demand, relatively dynamic 

imports, and declining market shares could lead to 

increasing external imbalances and a sluggish 

recovery.  Net trade has hampered French growth 
significantly way over the last six years. This is not 

due to a single factor but is rather the symptom of 

a series of weaknesses on the supply side. An 

analysis of the French fo
reign trade clearly points 
to the medium-high technology positioning of 

French exports, linked with insufficient private 

expenditure in R&D, especially in mid-sized 

enterprises, which leads to a situation of 

innovation follower. 
Against this background, 
French exporters have 
reduced their profit margins in order to contain the 

loss in terms of price competitiveness. However, 

compressed profit margins have not been enough 

to limit the rapid loss of market shares, given the 

pressure on prices from competitors in emerging 

economies. In addition, France's net exports are 

held back by the size and the number of exporting 

firms. For a large majority of firms, exports 

represent a very limited share of their turnover, 

compared with German companies for example. 
 Increased labour utilisation Œ key for a 
successful recovery Despite modest GDP growth, employment 
continued to expand by around 1% in 2008 

reflecting the traditional lag between growth and 

employment. In 2009 and 2010, employment 

prospects will reflect the weakness of economic 

activity in general. Specifically, labour shedding, 

which started in the third quarter of 2008, has 

gained momentum as a result of the contraction of 

global activity. It is expected to gradually stop in 

the course of 2010 before reversing in 2011. Total 

employment is set to fall by about 1¾ pps. in 2009 

and ¾ pp. in 2010. The unemployment rate is 

projected to increase, reaching 10½% in 2010. 
The employment rate is expected to stabilise over 
the forecast horizon. This
 historically insufficient 
utilisation of labour has repeatedly been 

highlighted as one of the main weaknesses of the 

French economy. One of 
the greatest challenges of 
the French economy is to raise the employment 

rate (64.6% in 2007) by further modernising the 

labour market, which would help the economy to 
Member States, France 
  101 enter a virtuous circle by stimulating economic 
activity and helping to improve public accounts. 

Poor labour market functioning in France 

manifests itself in a rather low participation rate at 

both ends of the age spectrum (young and older 

workers), a high unemployment rate, and a low 

number of average hours worked. The 

unemployment rate of the young has jumped from 

an already high level compared to European 

standards (19.4% in 2007 compared to 15.4% in 

the EU as a whole). Additionally, there are risks 

currently that employer
s might encourage early 
retirement.
 Furthermore, the tax cuts on overtime 
hours may have incentivised employers to favour 

overtime over new recruitment. Finally, 

reintegrating the low-skilled and the young into the 

workforce after the crisis is a major challenge. A 

successful response will avoid a permanent 

destruction in human capital and a durable rise in 

long-term unemployment. 
 Sharp deterioration in public finances In 2009, the deficit is projected to rise markedly to 
8.3% of GDP due to the difficult economic 

environment and the recovery measures, the  

impact of which is expected to be 1.2% of GDP 

compared to 1% previously. The deficit is 

expected to slightly decrease in 2010; without 

consolidation efforts, it could remain high for 

many years, thus constraining economic activity. 

In 2010, the positive impact (by some ¾% of 

GDP) of the phasing-out of the recovery plan is 

projected to offset the ne
w measures in the draft 
budget law of 0.5% of GDP (essentially the 

withdrawal of the local business tax), the normal 

functioning of automatic stabilisers and increasing 

interest payments.  
The starting position of public finances before the 
crisis was not optimal in spite of robust growth in 

the previous years. Cons
equently, in summer of 
2008, the country had less room for expansionary 

policies than if it had implemented more prudent 

policies: as a result, the deficit had already 

breached the 3% of GDP threshold in 2008.

 The debt-to-GDP ratio is set to continue to rise due

to-GDP ratio is expected to rise to 85.2% in 2010 

and approach 90% in 2011,
 compared to close to 
70% at the end of 2008. The resulting high interest 

service burden might crowd out more productive 

expenditure, which would be particularly 

necessary in order to bring growth back to pre-

crisis levels. As announced by the authorities, 

expenditure retrenchment should be the base for 

sustained fiscal consolidation given that the 

expenditure-to-GDP ratio (at 52.7% in 2008) is the 

highest in the euro ar
ea. A fiscal framework 
aiming at controlling the evolution of public 

spending at all general government sub-levels has 

been put in place in recent years, and is now 

yielding its first results. The General Review of 

Public Policies (
Revue Générale des Politiques 
Publiques
, or RGPP), including more than 300 
measures approved by the 
government, is meant to 
be the cornerstone which will ensure that the "zero 

per cent increase in volume terms" for central 

government spending is
 reached. As far as 
healthcare spending is concerned, a spending 

target was introduced with the ONDAM (
Objectif 
National de Dépenses d'Assurance Maladie
) which, however, is not binding and has only been 

met once since its inception. Local authorities' 

expenditures are notably limited by a "golden rule" 

with a legal basis, which prevents authorities from 

raising debt to finance operational expenditures.

     102  11. ITALY 
After the crisis, a return to moderate growth 
 103 Long-standing weaknesses and a constrained 
policy response While the low indebtedness of the household 
sector and relatively solid financial system have 

provided some shelter from the financial turmoil, 

deep-seated structural pr
oblems, giving rise to 
unsatisfactory productivity growth, had weakened 

the Italian economy long before the global 

downturn. A marked slowdown of economic 

activity was already underway before the 

deepening of the financial crisis. In the second 

quarter of 2008, real GDP started declining at an 

increasing pace, initially driven by the impact of 

surging commodity prices and subsequently by the 

collapse in global trade and rising risk aversion. 

Overall, between the first quarter of 2008 and the 

second quarter of 2009, the cumulative loss of real 

GDP was 6½%, similar to that of Germany but 

higher than in most other euro area countries. 
The government's policy response to the crisis was 
constrained by Italy's fragile public finances, in 

particular its very high public debt. Efforts have 

been limited to reallocating public expenditure 

towards growth-enhancing items, while stemming 

the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable 

groups. Even when the recovery from the current 

downturn starts to take hold, structural 

weaknesses, including very high public debt, will 

continue to weigh on the Italian economy. Unless 

these weaknesses are tackle
d, economic activity is 
set to return to a moderate growth path after the 

crisis. Demand for goods hardest hit Real GDP in 2008 and early 2009 mirrors 

developments in industrial output: manufacturing 

value-added shrank by around one-fifth between 

the beginning of 2008 and mid-2009. The 

contraction was particularly pronounced in the last 

quarter of 2008 and the first three months of 2009, 

while it eased in the seco
nd quarter. A significant 
rebound is anticipated in the third quarter. 

Accordingly, real GDP is 
projected to regain some 
strength in the second half of the year. Still, the 

depth of the output contraction so far means that 

for 2009 as a whole real 
GDP is set to record its 
steepest fall in decades. 
The collapse in global demand is reflected in 
Italy's external performance. Despite some 

improvement expected in 
the second half of the 
year, export volumes are 
set to decline by more 
than 20% in 2009 as a whole. Demand for goods 

across most manufacturing sectors is being hard 

hit. Exports of services have been declining as 

well, although at a less marked pace. The projected 

significant fall in domestic demand in 2009, and 

particularly the substantial retrenchment in 

investment, is also affecting imports. However, the 

expected drop in import volumes in 2009 will not 

fully offset the export dr
ag on the economy. This 
implies a negative contribution of net exports to 

growth and a sharp reduction in the already 

relatively low degree of openness of the economy. 

Still, the assumed lower commodity prices should 

lead to an improvement in the trade balance.

 The plunge in external demand has triggered a 
sharp contraction in investment. High uncertainty 

about the pace of the international recovery and 

still moderate growth in domestic demand are 

expected to lead firms to continue scaling back 

their investment plans throughout the second half 

of 2009. For the year as a whole, investment 

expenditure is projected to fall by over 12% in 

volume terms as the huge contraction of private 

investment will be only partly offset by the 

planned acceleration of government capital 

spending. Equipment investment is set to drop very 

sharply on the back of hi
storically low capacity 
utilisation and deteriorating profits. After a decade 

of continuous expansion supported by favourable

building declined moderately in 2008 and a more 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  104 substantial drop is expected in 2009. The fading 
away of demand and tighter financial conditions 

have also implied a significant reduction in firms' 

stockbuilding in 2008 and 2009. 
Private consumption had already fallen in the 
second quarter of 2008 due to the loss of 

purchasing power related to the surge in 

commodity prices. It contracted again in the final 

quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 

because of the high uncer
tainty brought about by 
the financial crisis. The tightening of spending on 

durable goods was followed by a decrease in 

expenditure on non-durable goods on the back of 

strengthened precautiona
ry savings. Several 
measures taken by the government since October 

2008, such as the "social 
card" to support the daily 
purchase of consumables, the "family bonus" 

one-off transfer to poorer households and the 

expansion of wage-supplementation schemes to 

additional categories of workers, have all helped to 

underpin household income. Thanks also to tax 

incentives supporting the purchase of durable 

goods, in particular vehicles, private consumption 

recorded a mild recovery in the second quarter of 

2009. This recovery is set to gather strength in the 

rest of the year, carrying a moderate positive 

growth impulse into 2010. 
Private consumption and exports to drive the 
recovery In 2010 and 2011, economic activity is projected 
to recover gradually. The 
improvement in private 
consumption over the forecast horizon relies on 

various factors. First, the household sector is 

expected to reduce precautionary savings made 

over 2008-2009 as the global financial crisis fades 

away. Second, the still marginal role of pension 

funds and the absence of a housing bubble are 

expected to help minimise
 negative wealth effects 
on aggregate consumption. Finally, purchasing 

power should recover after the losses of 2008, 

thanks to the moderate inflation anticipated for the 

2009-2011 period.  
Investment expenditure is expected to improve 
over 2010, also boosted by a tax break for 

equipment investment ending in June 2010 and 

despite the projected reduction in public 

investment. It is expected to record positive growth 

in 2011 as the increase in
 corporate investment is 
projected to more than offset the further drop in 

government capital spending. 
The assumed increase in demand from Italy™s 
trading partners is set to provide an impulse to 

exports. Imports are expected to regain even more 

strength, but the projected improvement in the 

terms of trade would allow the trade balance to 

remain broadly stable in both 2010 and 2011. The 

current account deficit is 
set to remain at around 
2½% of GDP over the forecast horizon. 
Risks to the productive base  Export growth is expected to continue to lag 

behind global demand over the forecast horizon 

also due to Italy's failure to recoup the heavy 

losses in cost and price competitiveness 

accumulated since the start of this decade. The size 

of the market share loss also depends on the ability 

of firms to survive the crisis. The Italian 

manufacturing sector has undertaken a deep 

restructuring process in recent years to face 

increasing global competition, in particular in 

traditional and medium-to-high technology 

products. Non-price competitiveness has been 

improving, namely in terms of product quality. 

The global financial crisis could jeopardise the 

ongoing restructuring process as exportŒoriented 

firms are hit hard. Having heavily invested in 

opening up internationally and starting from a 

relatively low capitalisation, some firms have been 

taking on debt and now have to cope with both 

tighter financial conditions and the fall in demand. 

The closure of firms that would have the capability 

to compete and expand when the global economy 

recovers could negatively affect the potential 

growth of the Italian economy. 
Resilient employment  In 2008, full-time equivalent employment declined 

by 0.1%, combining a 1.5% contraction in 

self-employment with a 0.5% expansion of wage 

and salary earners. The diverging dynamics of 

value-added (-0.9% in 2008) and employment 

continued in the first half of 2009, intensifying the 

deterioration in productivity already underway. 

Going forward, this trend 
is expected to reverse. 
While value-added is forecast to recover slowly, 

further job losses are expected in the rest of 2009 

and in 2010 because of the assumed lagged impact 

of the sharp downturn onto the labour market. 
In response to the crisis, access to the wage 
supplementation fund (CIG) has been extended to 

additional categories of workers. The scheme 

mitigates the impact of the downturn on headcount 
Member States, Italy 
  105 employment by subsidising part of the income loss 
due to reduced hours worked. The forecast output 

recovery, notably in manufacturing, is expected to 

translate first into a rebound of productivity, then 

into an expansion of hours worked, and only later 

into headcount employment increases. The 

asymmetry between permanent employees and 

semi-independent workers (who have lower or no 

CIG coverage) concentrates the risk of 

unemployment on the latter. Data from the labour 

surveys show that the self-employed and fixed-

term employees account for most of the job losses 

in the first half of 2009. By allowing employees to 

keep their contractual 
bond with the employer, 
thus reducing the risks of labour shedding during a 

recession, the CIG scheme has so far attenuated 

the impact of the crisis on household labour 

incomes and helped to preserve human capital in 

the hardest-hit industries. Still, over-reliance on 

this scheme may delay the needed labour 

reallocation to more productive industries. 
Since the second half of 2008, the evolution of the 
labour force has almost matched the fall in 

headcount employment, in particular in the poorer 

Southern regions where discouragement over the 

prospects of finding a job is more widespread. As a 

consequence, the unemployment rate has increased 

only moderately so far, to reach 7.4% in the 

second quarter of 2009. The regularisation of 

immigrant workers, mo
st of them in-home 
caregivers, in the final part of the year should have 

a favourable impact on the unemployment rate. 

However, the rate is set to continue increasing in 

2010 due to the assumed further decline in 

employment, and to stabilise in 2011. 
After the 3.3% growth recorded in 2008, wages per 
full-time employee are set to moderate in 2009, 

while outpacing inflation also because of lagged 

contract renewals. As of 2010, the application of 

the newly-reformed bargaining framework would 

result in wage increments consistent with inflation 

measured excluding imported energy goods at the 

national level. The productivity-related pay 

component is to be agreed at the firm level. By 

better aligning wages to productivity 

developments, this new system is expected to exert 

a positive influence on unit labour costs, after 

several years of relatively steep rises.  
Headline inflation is proj
ected to decelerate to 
0.8% on average in 2009
, squeezed by the fall in 
energy prices and the compression of business 

profit margins. It is then projected to increase, to 
2% in 2011, further widening the differential with 
the euro area. Core inflation is anticipated to 

remain below 2% over
 the forecast horizon. 
The crisis takes its toll on public finances The government's response to the crisis has had to 
be carefully balanced with the need to avoid a 

substantial deterioration in public finances, given 

the very high government debt in a context of 

increased global risk aver
sion. Measures taken to 
date to support low-income groups and key 

industrial sectors have been financed mainly by 

reallocating existing funds.

widen markedly to 5.3% of GDP in 2009 (from 

2.7% in 2008) and to remain at around that level in 

2010 and 2011. Both sides of the government 

account contribute to the deficit increase. Primary 

expenditure is set to rise by more than 4½% in 

2009, significantly faster than planned in the 

stability programme update submitted in February 

2009. In particular, public wage growth is set to 

continue outpacing inflation. In addition, 

intermediate consumption is still increasing 

substantially despite the budgetary measures 

adopted to contain it. 
Social transfers are 
particularly dynamic in 2009 due to a combination 

of the indexation of pensions to previous-year 

inflation, one-off transfers to poor households and 

the extended coverage of the wage 

supplementation fund. Capital spending is poised 

to rise by some 13%, reflecting recovery measures 

that aim to bring forward some investment plans. 

The only significant item e
xpected to decrease is 
interest expenditure, which is benefitting from 

historically low short-term interest rates. While the 

deep downturn in 2009 has derailed the three-year 

budgetary consolidation plan adopted in summer

     106 2008, a marked slowdown in expenditure 
dynamics is forecast fo
r 2010 and 2011, assuming 
a return to the planned consolidation path. Capital 

expenditure is set to decrease in both years, while 

modest increases are proj
ected for current primary 
expenditure. Interest expenditure is expected to 

rise, also due to the expanding debt. 
On the revenue side, a sizeable contraction is 
expected in 2009 in both direct and indirect taxes. 

Direct tax revenues are set to be dragged down by 

plummeting corporate profits, whereas personal 

income taxes are expected to decrease only 

slightly. Indirect taxes ar
e also forecast to drop, 
driven by the plunge in VAT recorded in the first 

half of 2009. This drop is much sharper than 

implied by developments of its most relevant tax 

base, i.e. nominal private consumption, and does 

not seem to be fully explained by the shift towards 

less-tax-rich consumption items. Sizeable one-off 

capital taxes (0.4% of GDP) related to the 

revaluation of companies' assets will mitigate the 

fall in total revenue. Th
e one-off proceeds of the 
extraordinary tax on repa
triated assets illegally 
held abroad could further raise capital revenues, 

but the size of this effect is not yet known. Going 

forward, indirect tax revenues are assumed to grow 

broadly in line with nominal consumption in 2010 

and 2011, while the direct tax base would take 

longer to return to pre-crisis levels, especially in 
the corporate component. The primary balance is 
projected to turn negative in 2009 and to return to 

a balanced position only in 2011. Even adjusting 

for the cycle, the prim
ary balance is set to 
deteriorate in 2009 relative to 2008. 
The gross government debt-to-GDP ratio is 
expected to climb by almost 9 pp. in 2009, to 

around 114.5%, and to continue rising over the 

forecast horizon, to ar
ound 118% in 2011. The 
bulk of the increase in 2009 is due to falling 

nominal GDP. The projected negative primary 

balance accounts for an additional ½ pp. increase 

in the debt-to-GDP ratio, while the voluntary use 

of government funds to recapitalise the banking 

sector is assumed to contribute some ¼ pp. of 

GDP, i.e. less than made 
available for this purpose.  
Looking forward, the interaction between high 

debt-service requirements and low potential 

growth underline the importance of raising the 

primary balance so as to put the very high debt 

ratio on a declinin
g path once again. 12. CYPRUS 
Ongoing economic adjustme
nt, slow recovery ahead 
 107 Declining activity and policy response After more than a decade of sustained and strong 
expansion, the Cypriot economy has decelerated 

sharply. Notwithstanding the robust growth of 

3¾% recorded in 2008 as
 a whole, the slowdown 
of economic activity started in the third quarter of 

last year and gained momentum in the first half of 

the current year. An ad
verse external economic 
environment, high household indebtedness 

together with tight lending conditions, 

restructuring corporat
e balance sheets and 
deteriorating confidence weighed on growth. The 

crisis has also highlighted the accumulation of a 

high external imbalance, 
a particularly oversized 
housing sector and competitiveness losses. These 

factors set the stage for the 
structural adjustment of 
the economy.  
GDP contracted in the se
cond quarter of 2009. 
This trend is expected to continue until the year's 

end and, for the first time in 30 years, Cyprus is set 

to record a negative growth rate (-¾%). The 

downturn is expected to take a heavy toll on public 

finances: deficits exceeding 3% of GDP are 

projected over the forecas
t period, reflecting both 
lower tax elasticities and higher expenditure. As a 

result, the long-term sustainability prospects for 

public finances are deteriorating. The labour 

market is also expected 
to suffer, especially the 
labourŒintensive sectors.

 As a response to the crisis, the Cypriot government 
acted in a timely manner, adopting some fiscal 

stimulus and structural measures amounting to 1 

½% of GDP. The stimulus package was essentially 
addressed to construction (1 ¼% of GDP) and 
tourism (¼% of GDP) Some support measures 

without a direct impact on the deficit were also 

targeted to households. 
Regarding the financial sector, Cypriot banks have 
not been exposed to toxic assets, mainly thanks to 

strict supervision by the Central Bank. However, 

in order to underpin confidence in the banking 

system, the government raised the deposits 

guarantee and issued treasury bills to provide 

liquidity to the banking system. 
Subdued growth weighs on labour market  The outlook envisages a slow economic recovery 

in 2010 and 2011, with Cyprus lagging behind the 

EU average in both years. GDP is projected to stall 

in 2010, reflecting mainly sluggish world demand 

and depressed private consumption and 

investment. Specifically, private consumption 

growth is likely to be 
subdued over 
the forecast 
period despite nominal wage growth above 

inflation and a falling debt-servicing burden 

consistent with declining interest rates. This is due 

to a high household debt burden, tight financial 

conditions and downbeat consumer sentiment in an 

uncertain environment. Prospects for gross fixed 

capital formation are also likely to remain muted 

over the forecast years. Given the economic 

outlook in Cyprus' main trading partners, foreign 

demand for dwellings by non-residents should 

remain weak. Domestic demand for housing and 

activity in real estate is also expected to stay 

subdued, on the back of high indebtedness and 

high growth of prices in recent years. Although 

infrastructure projects, 
including private and 
Public Private Partnershi
ps (PPP), should support 
investment somewhat, it is unlikely that they 

would be sufficient to fully offset the impact of the 

contraction in housing on total investment. 

Investment in equipment, 
largely associated with 
construction, is also set to follow a similar trend.  
As regards the external sector, imports should 
shrink in 2010 and recover only in 2011 due to the 

slowdown in final demand. Exports of both goods 

and services, particularly tourism, are set to 

recover somewhat in view of an improving 

economic outlook in Cyprus™ main trading 

partners. All in all, the contribution of net exports 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  108 to GDP growth should be positive in both 2010 
and 2011.  
The subdued economic outlook should weigh 
particularly on labour-intensive sectors in 2010, 

especially construction and tourism. Accordingly, 

employment is projected to decline while 

unemployment should rise to historically high 

levels, reaching 6½% in 2010.  
Overall, the balance of risks appears to be neutral. 
Higher total demand would hinge on a faster 

recovery of the economies of Cyprus' major 

trading partners. Also, a reduction in interest rate 

spreads and in banking lending rates could 

underpin private consumption and soften the 

adjustment of the housing sector. On the negative 

side, a sharper-than-expected fall of external 

demand would certainly weigh on economic 

activity more than projected in the baseline 

scenario. At the same time, a tightening of credit 

conditions coupled with high indebtedness of 

private agents could lead to a sharper fall in 

investment and consumption. Furthermore, in a 

context of weak growth in both real and nominal 

terms, the external constraint becomes more 

severe.  Eventually, it could lead to either higher 

cost of debt-financing or higher savings, in each 

case affecting adversel
y economic activity.  
Restoring the external balance should 
underpin a sustained recovery Within this economic outlook, the challenge for 
the Cypriot economy is to return to a sustained 

convergence path. This could be tackled more 

successfully if the recovery
 were to lead to the 
correction of the imbalances
, in a context of higher 
potential growth. 
Due to the strong decelera
tion of activity in 2009 
there was a significant, yet partial, correction of 

the external deficit. However, as a percentage of 

GDP, it is set to remain at two-digit levels. In the 

medium term, the deficit should continue to 

improve but at a much more moderate rate, 

reflecting lower GDP growth. In particular, the 

current account deficit should still reach 7¾% of 

GDP by 2011. As a result, the external imbalance 

is likely to weigh on economic growth over the 

medium-term. Growing public sector dissavings 

would need to be financed by either foreign debt or 

domestic private savings. Thus, the adjustment of 

the current account imbalance would require either 

higher cost of debt-financing or higher savings 
from the private sector. The latter would imply 
lower output growth through lower private 

consumption or investment (crowding-out effect). 
The external imbalance to a certain extent reflects 
a deterioration of competitiveness, partly due to a 

weak response of wages in both the public and 

private sectors to the current recession. In 

particular, nominal compensation per employee is 

estimated to increase by about 1¾% in 2009, 

which exceeds productivity growth. Furthermore, 

even with the prospect of no or minimal wage 

growth in the forthcom
ing sectoral collective 
agreements, the wage drift and indexation 

(COLA), which adjusts wages based on inflation in 

the previous 6 months, should contribute to a 

sustained wage growth, especially in the second 

half of the forecast peri
od. In line with slowing 
activity, productivity growth is expected to slump. 

This, coupled with a minor acceleration in wages, 

is set to keep unit labour costs rising modestly, yet 

higher than the euro area. All in all, the 

disassociation between wages and developments in 

productivity is undermining the competitiveness of 

the Cypriot economy.  
Although the inflation rate is estimated to be very 
low in 2009, a rapid return to the trend rate of 

2½% is envisaged over the forecast horizon. This 

should be driven by developments in oil prices, on 

which Cyprus is highly dependent, and a powerful 

base effect. Core inflati
on should remain above the 
euro area average, mainly reflecting pressures in 

product markets, especially services. 
Deterioration in public finances Public finances in Cypr
us are likely to face a 
relatively prolonged period of low tax elasticities, 

reflecting not only lower growth but also a less 

tax-friendly growth composition linked to the 

fading out of the asset boom. The projected 

increase of expenditures for this year and next 

largely reflects the functioning of automatic 

stabilisers and interest payments associated with 

increasing debt levels and the continuation of 

largely untargeted so
cial transfers.  
While the Cypriot budget balance was in surplus 
during the last two years, it is expected to have 

turned into a deficit of about 3½% in 2009 

compared to a 0.9% surplus in 2008, due to both 

lower than anticipated revenue and to higher-than-

planned expenditure. Revenue appears to be 

declining across the board, reflecting the downturn

measures to the previous

continuation of the 2009 policies. Although the 

Draft Budget mentions a series of supplementary 

measures that could be taken during the course of 

the year as a means to restrain the budgetary 

deficit in 2010 below 3%, they are not accounted 

in the budget target. Th

aimed at fighting tax evas

assumption, the deficit should increase further to 

almost 6% of GDP in 2011. This projected fiscal 

deterioration is driven by
 rising expenditure, which 
is only partly offset by moderately increasing 

revenues. With weak GDP growth and an 

increasing deficit, the debt-to-GDP ratio will raise 

and exceed 60% of GDP by 2011, thus weakening 

the long-term sustainability of the public finances. 
13. LATVIA 
Bulk of output correction over, publ
ic finances and the economy still 
reshaping 
 110 A dramatic end to the boom For several years before the financial crisis, Latvia 
registered the highest GDP growth in the EU. 

Double-digit output growth
 was driven by a credit-
fuelled housing boom, which was based on high 

expectations about households' future income 

potential. On the other hand, the supply side of the 

economy was not able to keep up with the surging 

domestic demand, leading to an acute shortage of 

labour, high inflation, a large trade deficit and a 

deterioration in cost competitiveness. The structure 

of the economy, including investment, shifted 

towards non-tradeables.  
The reversal of the credit 
cycle started in 2007 and 
the adjustment process was rather gradual until 

mid-2008. However, when risk aversion in global 

financial markets became extreme later in the year, 

funding constraints - apparent when a domestic 

bank ran into trouble - forced the government to 

turn to international institutional financing. Credit 

growth in the private sector turned negative in 

November 2008 and has remained so. The 

deleveraging process was exacerbated by credit 

rating agency downgrades, deepening the 

downturn on the property market and causing 

financing difficulties even for firms with viable 

business models. As risk perception towards 

Latvia increased, companies' ability to sign foreign 

contracts was adversely a
ffected. The provision of 
international financial assistance  - conditional on 

the implementation of the necessary fiscal 

consolidation as well as financial system and 

structural reforms - helped to stabilise confidence, 

and provided the needed liquidity to the Latvian 

economy.  
At the end of 2008, on top of its domestic market 
woes, Latvia also suffered a large export shock 

following the temporary collapse of global trade. 

The double-hit from external and internal demand 

led to an unprecedented 11%
 quarterly output loss 
in the first quarter of 2009. Economic sentiment hit 

an all-time low in March, after the prime minister 

resigned following loss of support from the 

governing coalition. Nevertheless, in the second 

quarter of 2009, industrial output and exports 

started to show signs of stabilisation and GDP fell 

by a relatively modest 0.8% from the preceding 

quarter. Market sentiment improved after the 
conditions of the international financial assistance 
programme were reviewed, taking into account the 

performance in the first half
 of the year, and after a 
significant supplementary budget to address the 

unsustainable trends. Nevertheless, uncertainties in 

the implementation of th
e programme at times 
created volatility in confidence vis-à-vis the 

country's commitment to ensure the needed 

adjustment. Recent business and consumer survey 

results and monthly industrial output data suggest 

a continuation of the relative stabilisation trend as 

regards output, although monthly retail sales and 

tax receipts data point to a further significant fall 

in domestic demand. As regards asset price 

adjustment, by mid-2009 the price of standard 

Riga apartments had fallen to one third of mid-

2007 peak levels. Although the current property 

price level appears to be in line with long-term 

local income potential, an imminent revival of the 

real estate market is not in sight.

forecast
 Output trough still to be reached, but 
adjustment ongoing  Despite the massive correction already 
experienced in  domestic demand, it is expected to 

contract still further due to the deleveraging 

process in the financial sector, the weakness of the 

labour market, the down-scaling of industries 

which depended on previously above-potential 

domestic demand and the ongoing fiscal 

consolidation process. Th
e recovery of private 
investment hinges on a clearer view on public 

finances and in particular, future tax policy. It 

appears fair to assume that further specification of 
Member States, Latvia 
  111 these measures would be accompanied by positive 
confidence effects, which could ease financing 

conditions and would counterbalance the negative 

impact of the measures themselves. While 

uncertainty on the timing and composition of fiscal 

consolidation measures re
present a risk which may 
weigh on domestic demand, public investment will 

continue to provide some cushion, given that EU-

funded projects are safeguarded under the fiscal 

consolidation programm
e and their faster 
implementation is being actively sought. Further 

risks are related to the financial sector's ability to 

provide credit to the economy, notably against the 

background of increasing non-performing loans. 
A sizeable correction in the external sector The domestic cost adjustment, together with 

efforts to shift economic re
sources to the tradable 
sector, should put the economy on a stronger 

footing for a sustainable export-led recovery from 

end-2010. Latvia can also build on its relatively 

favourable fundamentals. Over the past decade the 

country performed fairly well in gaining export 

market shares, with improvements in its product 

composition and with services exports being 

particularly dynamic. The product and 

geographical diversification of Latvian exports has 

also improved considerably. Future export 

prospects could also be supported by Latvia's large 

absolute cost advantage relative to other EU 

countries. However, this latter potential could be 

best exploited with productivity-increasing capital 

investment, which requires a stable business 

environment, with predictable tax policy.  
Marking a sharp turnar
ound compared to the 
situation of only a year 
earlier, when the current 
account balance was in double-digit deficit, the 

overall external balance turned into a sizeable 

surplus in the second quarter. This reflected inter 

alia the recording of high losses in the banking 

sector, advance payments by the EU funds and a 

balance in goods and serv
ices trade. The current 
account is projected to be
 in surplus over the 
forecast period, reflecting 
sustained transfers from 
EU funds and subdued imports and further losses 

of foreign banks due to the prolonged weakness in 

the economy. The ratio to GDP of net external 

liabilities is set to increase during the recession.  
Real incomes hit by falling wages and rising 
unemployment Labour market conditions are changing 
dramatically. Falling employment and hours 

worked per employee, plus some nominal 

reduction of full-time equivalent gross wages 

helped firms to absorb the adjustment during the 

crisis. Gross wages fell by 1% in the second 

quarter from its level a year earlier, with private 

sector wages broadly unchanged and public sector 

wages falling by over 6%. On a seasonally-

adjusted basis, private sector wages already fell in 

the first half of the year, at an annualised rate of 

around 5-6%. As official wage statistics are 

blurred by composition changes (initially, mainly 

the lower-paid employees entered unemployment) 

and by the large grey eco
nomy (it being easier to 
cut the unofficial part of the wages, there being no 

need to rewrite contracts and also because a large 

share of the workforce is 
reported at the minimum 
wage), a faster adjustment may have taken place.  
The labour market adjustment is projected to 
continue at its current high pace with 

unemployment rising rapidly. However, the impact 

of falling employment should be reduced by an 

expected fall in the participation rate and by higher 

outward migration. Compensation of employees 

per head is set to fall markedly in both 2009 and 

2010, with the driver shifting from hours worked 

to nominal wage reduction. Latvia's real effective 

exchange rate Œ which, given fixed exchange rate 

vis-à-vis the euro, appreciat
ed during the crisis due 
to the depreciation of partner currencies - 

depreciated during the summer of 2009. This trend 

is expected to continue as disinflationary forces in 

Latvia exert their full effect. However, it is still too 

early to conclude when th
e objective of realigning 
wages with productivity through internal price 

adjustment will be attained.

    112 Extent of price adjustment uncertain Inflation has been decreasing rapidly since its 
double-digit peak in 2008 and the headline figure 

should shortly turn negative, given falling 

domestic demand, wages and energy prices. 

However, the inflation forecast does not take into 

account the impact on pr
ices of possible tax 
increases or other measures required for fiscal 

consolidation, though the probability of such 

measures is high. Lower consumer prices would 

facilitate coping with lower nominal wages and 

encourage the reorientation of the economy 

towards external markets. The scope for price and 

wage reduction in Latvia is however limited by the 

free movement of goods and labour within the 

Single Market.  
Public finances struggle to meet EU-IMF 
programme targets The impact on public finances of the unexpected 
macroeconomic deterioration in the first half of 

2009 was partly mitigated thanks to the 

supplementary budget adopted in June, consisting 

of a consolidation package of around 4.5% of 

GDP, mostly on the expenditure side. Despite 

revenues slightly lower than expected when the 

supplementary budget wa
s adopted, the fiscal 
outturn for 2009 is so far consistent with the 
corresponding deficit target
 of 10% of GDP agreed 
with the EU in July 2009, thanks to lower spending 

expected at the central government level. Some 

risks are linked to local governments, which were 

obliged to adopt supplementary budgets before 1 

October in an unprecedented context: 

municipalities face tight fiscal constraints (tax 

revenues are hard hit by the recession), and have to 

cope with a major administrative reform reducing 

their number to a fifth. However, the necessary 

expenditure cuts could prove feasible given that, in 

comparison with central government, local 

governments were assessed to have greater scope 

to implement reductions, and the risk of overruns 

is limited by the strict restrictions on their 

borrowing capacity.  
The picture is more uncertain as regards the fiscal 
outcome for 2010. The forecast deficit for 2010 of 

12.5% of GDP includes positive carry-over effects 

of the 2009 supplementary budget, notably lower 

pension and wage bills, and higher personal 

income tax, and assumes lower tax bases given the 

macroeconomic context. 
However, the forecast 
does not incorporate the budget currently in 

preparation, which is being designed in order to 

meet the commitment to international lenders to 

undertake a consolidation entailing a further 

improvement in the budget
 balance by 500 million 
lats, thereby targeting a deficit of no more than 
Member States, Latvia 
  113 8.5% of GDP in ESA terms. Government gross 
debt is projected to in
crease from about 20% of 
GDP in 2008 to slightly above 60% of GDP by 

2011. This projection may be affected by further 

financial sector costs and the profile of 

international financial assistance.  
14. LITHUANIA 
Sharp contraction puts public fi
nances under strong pressure  114 Severe economic downturn and strong policy 
response Several years of rapid and increasingly 
unsustainable growth, mainly driven by domestic 

demand and a real estate boom, came to a halt in 

2008. Growth still 
reached 2.8% for the year as a 
whole, but Lithuania quickly moved into recession 

and in the first half of 2009 output fell 17% year-

on-year, one of the sharpest declines in the EU. 

The bursting of the domestic bubble was 

reinforced by the global financial crisis and a 

fading away of external 
demand, nearly returning 
output to pre-boom levels. The sharp decline in 

revenues resulting from the economic contraction, 

together with an expansionary fiscal policy before 

the parliamentary elections in 2008, left Lithuania 

facing significant challenges. 
A strong policy response 
was put in place by the 
new government in autumn 2008. Fiscal 

consolidation measures were adopted in December 

to contain the deterioration in public finances and 

limit debt accumulation, as well as to facilitate the 

adjustment needed in
 the economy, thereby 
supporting the credibility of the currency board 

arrangement. Due to accumulated imbalances and 

constrained financing conditions, there was no 

space for fiscal stimulus. The adjustment of the 

economy is expected to occur via decreases in 

prices and wages and via a restructuring of the 

economy towards tradable sectors. 
Steep contraction of domestic demand, to be 
followed by fragile recovery  A large drop in real GDP in
 2009 is expected to be 
followed by a smaller decline in 2010 before 

positive growth resumes in
 2011. The recession is 
driven by the plunge in domestic demand, 

especially investment and household consumption. 
Despite some tentative signs of economic 
stabilisation, such as a marginal upturn in 

confidence indicators, moderation in the steep 

declines in retail sales and industrial production, 

and green shoots in the global economy, recovery 

still looks very fragile. The situation in the labour 

market is expected to worsen further, while fiscal 

policy is set to remain tight and investment 

depressed.  
Private consumption has plummeted in 2009 and 
should still decline further in 2010. Due to wage 

cuts in the private and publ
ic sectors, an expected 
reduction of social benefits and indirect tax 

increases in 2009, household disposable income 

has fallen and borrowing remained restricted. 

Remittances from abroad are also assumed to be 

lower due to recessions in Lithuania's major 

emigration destinations. 
The contraction of economic activity is weighing 
heavily on employment, 
which is projected to 
suffer a cumulative fall of some 11% in 2009 and 

2010. Even though nominal wages are adjusting to 

labour market conditions, job losses particularly in 

the non-tradable sect
ors are pronounced. 
Unemployment is set to increase strongly during 

the forecast period, reaching
 close to 18% in 2010. 
Youth unemployment is particularly high and 

already reached 30% in 
mid-2009, threatening a 
new emigration wave.

t Investment is undergoing a severe adjustment this 
year due to tight lending conditions, a sharp 

decline in domestic and external demand and 

major uncertainty abou
t future prospects. 
Moreover, the real estate market does not yet seem 

to have reached bottom. However, public 

investment is projected to accelerate as the 

government is committed to frontloading EU co-

financed projects, especially to enhance 

investments in infrastructure and improve energy 

efficiency of public and private buildings. 
The main risk to this baseline scenario could be a 
more rapid than expected rise in unemployment, 

thus contributing further to declines in confidence 
Member States, Lithuania 
  115 and spending, with negative feedback effects on 
business revenue, investment and employment. A 

stronger-than-assumed credit tightening could lead 

to a more negative outlook. On the other hand, a 

stronger performance by the exporting sectors 

could create new job opportunities.    
Some support from external sector  Net exports are supporting GDP growth as a result 

of a sharp fall in imports rather than strong growth 

in exports. The previously high current account 

deficit has narrowed significantly and recorded a 

slight surplus in the first half of 2009, mainly 

driven by a much lower me
rchandise trade deficit. 
Furthermore, the income balance deficit has been 

narrowing, due to lower earnings of inward 

investors. On the other hand, the balance of current 

and capital transfers is set to improve due to 

frontloading of EU funds, although private sector 

transfer receipts are likely to be lower than in 

previous years. 
With major trade partners showing signs of 
recovery, exports are expected to pick up, 

providing a key impulse to recovery from the 

recession. Some export-orien
ted industries, such as 
machinery and equipment, 
chemistry and food, are 
set to revive once global demand bounces back.  

After an initial loss of market shares in some 

neighbouring trade partners that experienced 

currency depreciations, Lithuania has been 

regaining its positions in these markets and 

diversifying in others. Although domestic demand 

for investment and consumption goods can be 

expected to remain depressed for some time, the 

increase in energy imports after the closure of the 

Ignalina nuclear power plant 
at the end of 2009 is 
expected to limit the fall in imports.  
Restoring competitiveness through price– Strong disinflationary pressures are expected to 

help restore some of the competitiveness lost in the 

boom years. There are already signs of 

improvement in terms of real exchange rate 

indicators in 2009. This ad
justment is expected to 
continue throughout the forecast period. HICP 

inflation declined rapidly from over 11% in 2008 

to under 4% in 2009. Due to low economic 

confidence and reduced consumer spending, it 

should turn slightly negative in 2010, despite a 

significant energy price shock. The closure of the 

Ignalina plant is expected to result in a 30% 

electricity price increase, 
adding about 0.75 pp to 
annual inflation. Moreover
, the prices of oil and 
other commodities in international markets and the 

extent of the secondary e
ffects related to higher 
production costs pass-through to consumers are 

uncertain. On the other hand, due to very weak 

domestic demand, high unemployment and 

negative wage pressures, core inflation should 

remain subdued over the forecast horizon.   
–and wage adjustment The necessary adjustment of labour costs started in 

the second half of 2008. The labour market has 

proved to be very flexible as private sector wages 

declined by around 6% y
ear-on-year in the second 
quarter of 2009, and decreased even more 

dramatically by over 20% in some previously 

booming non-tradable sectors. Recently adopted 

changes regarding work co
ntracts should provide a 
higher degree of labour market flexibility. 

Therefore, nominal compensation per employee is 

projected to decrease over
 the forecast horizon, 
falling by some 7% in 2009 and another 6% in 

2010 before stabilising in 2011 when the economy 

starts to recover. Such wage adjustment and 

labour-market conditions are helping to improve 

the competitive position of the Lithuanian 

economy and should underpin the rebalancing 

towards tradables.  
The government has also demonstrated significant 
determination to achieve the goal of wage 

adjustment by adopting a number of wage-

reducing measures in 2
009 and streamlining public 
administration. After having shown slight positive 

growth in the first half of 2009, public sector 

wages are expected to resp
ond more strongly as of 
the second half of 2009: the second supplementary 

2009 budget reduced public sector wages by 8-

10% from 1 August 2009.

    116 Public finances under strong pressure but 
adjustment underway The public sector recorded a deficit of 3.2% of 
GDP in 2008 but this is projected to deteriorate 

markedly over the for
ecast period given the 
contraction in output and thus revenues. The rapid 

deterioration of the public finances has been 

addressed by implementing restrictive initial and 

supplementary budgets. To
tal fiscal adjustment 
measures are estimated at around 7½% of GDP in 

2009, achieved through a combination of spending 

cuts and tax increases and a temporary reduction of 

transfers to the second pillar pension funds. 

However, expenditure has continued to grow, 

mainly reflecting increases in social expenditure 

and public sector wages due to decisions taken last 

year. In spite of repeated fiscal consolidation 

efforts, the deficit has been widening and is 

projected to reach nearly
 10% of GDP in 2009. 
In July 2009, the government initiated a medium-
term strategy initiative entailing discussions with 

the social partners (the so-called National 

Agreement) and proposing
 possible measures and 
structural reforms to be implemented over the 

medium term. In September, the government 

approved cuts in social benefits including pensions 

and generous maternity leave benefits to be 

implemented as of 2010, with some progressivity 
to protect the most vulnerable groups. Other 
measures proposed by the government together 

with the 2010 budget include a substantial 

reduction in current government spending, 

including the wage bill, an increase in the social 

contribution rate by 2 pp and a reduction in the 

corporate income tax rate by 5 pp. The latter was 

raised only in January 2009. However, even a 

substantial consolidation package will limit the 

deficit only to some extent, as tax revenue is 

projected to decline further and some expenditure 

items, such as net interest on public debt, are set to 

increase. The steps taken so far have enabled the 

government to borrow on international capital 

markets after being absent since October 2007. 

The government's intention to focus on long-term 

structural reforms is exp
ected to help improve the 
sustainability of public finances and the 

competitiveness of the economy. A major higher 

education reform is under way and the government 

is preparing health sector and social security 

system reforms.  
With such a strong downturn in GDP growth and 
high deficits, government debt is projected to 

increase from 15.6% of GD
P in 2008 to nearly

Recession followed by a relatively mild recovery 
 117 Economic activity bottoming out after sharp 
downturn The recession is taking a relatively high toll on 
Luxembourg, even if the latest news is somewhat 

encouraging. After four years of robust growth 

(5.5% a year on average over the period 2004-

2007), real GDP stagnated in 2008, with a large 

drop in the fourth quarter (-2.9% quarter-on-

quarter) and in the first quarter of 2009 (-1.7%). 

However, the decline was much more limited in 

the second quarter (-0.3%)
, which suggests that the 
downturn is bottoming out.  
The first victim of the recession was the 
manufacturing industry, which exports almost all 

of its production and is thus totally dependent on 

developments in world trade. Industrial production 

dropped markedly in the fourth quarter of 2008 (-

18% quarter-on-quarter) and in the first quarter of 

2009 (-10%). Luxembourgish industry is heavily 

concentrated in steel products, car suppliers and 

glass, which makes it very dependent on the 

automotive industry and on construction. 

Construction and services have also been hit, in 

particular services to enterprises but also the 

financial sector, which, due to its ownership 

structure (nearly all financial institutions belong to 

foreign groups) and the international character of 

its activity, is extremely sensitive to developments 

abroad. However, the financial sector has been less 

severely affected by the crisis than might have 

been expected. This is pr
obably because much of 
its core business, mainly private banking as well as 

the management and back office work of 

investment funds 
(86)
, has been relatively sheltered 
from the financial turmoil. Moreover, 

Luxembourgish financial institutions seem to have 

shown less appetite than many others for risky 

assets which eventually proved toxic. Thus the 

country's financial sector seems comparatively 

sound but its dependence on developments abroad 

is a source of vulnerability. The Luxembourgish 

authorities intervened in October 2008 together 

with the Belgian and Dutch governments in order 

to support two of the country's largest banks 

(Fortis and Dexia). The government granted each 

of these two banks a loan (the loan to Fortis was 

later converted into cap
ital) and guaranteed 
                                                          
 (86) Luxembourg is the world's second largest investment-fund 
centre after New-York. 
Dexia's new liabilities towards other financial 
institutions and institutional investors for a limited 

period of time.     
Employment remained buoyant for the larger part 
of 2008, rising by 4.8% over the year. Since then, 

the drop in activity has led to a standstill in job 

creation. Unemployment, which had been rising 

since the beginning of 2
008, strongly accelerated 
in the autumn, surging from 4.2% of the active 

population in January 2008 to 5.9% last August. 

The recession also led to a strong rise in short-time 

working, which was encouraged by the 

government in order to limit the rise in 

unemployment.

 The outlook for this year is negative: private 
consumption has been weakened by the negative 

developments on the labour market and the general 

deterioration in the 
economic environment. 
However, it could be supported to some extent by 

the cuts in income tax enacted in 2008 and 2009, 

by the fall in inflation and by the recent decline in 

interest rates (most mortgage loans are at a 

variable rate). Private investment collapsed at the 

end of 2008 and will probably continue to contract 

this year. This fall is likely to be only partially 

compensated by a more than 10% surge in public 

investment decided under the country's recovery 

plan. With markets projected to contract by almost 

15%, exports of goods are 
set to record a historic 
fall in 2009. Exports of services (both financial 

and non-financial) are expected to drop too, though 

probably by less than exports of goods. However, 

this fall in exports should   be partially offset by a 

parallel drop in imports. Overall, real GDP is 

forecast to contract by about 3½%.

    118 Gradual recovery in the offing  The economy is expected to begin to revive in the 
second half of this year following the recovery in 

the EU economy. However, GDP growth will 

probably remain fairly low in 2010, as most 

demand components should post only modest 

positive growth rates with the exception of public 

expenditure, which is forecast to remain extremely 

dynamic. Activity should progressively accelerate 

in the course of 2010 but even in 2011 growth is 

expected to remain far below the strong rates 

recorded a few years ago. 
Employment is projected 
to contract throughout 2009 (the positive growth 

rate forecast for this year being exclusively due to 

the large carry-over from 2008), even if this 

contraction is certainly limited at the moment by 

the massive recourse to part-time unemployment. 

Conversely, the negative ca
rry-over at the end of 
2009 will result in a decline in employment in 

annual terms in 2010, although it could begin to 

recover in the course of th
e year. However, the rise 
in unemployment will be limited by the fact that a 

large part of the workers who will lose their job 

will be non-residents, who will not be registered as 

unemployed in Luxembourg but in their country of 

residence. Despite this, unemployment is still 

projected to rise substan
tially and to reach by the 
end of the forecast period levels unseen for many 
years, though still lower than in most Member 
States.  Budget balance set to move into deficit  Thanks to still buoyant tax receipts and 

employment, the government surplus declined only 

from 3.7% of GDP in 2007 to 2.5% in 2008.  This 

surplus will turn into a deficit this year, due not 

only to the impact of the crisis on government 

revenues and on unemployment outlays but also to 

the tax cuts decided in the 2009 budget before the 

aggravation of the crisis. Moreover, expenditure is 

forecast to rise substantially, reflecting in 

particular the sharp increase in public investment 

which constitutes the bulk of the government's 

recovery plan. Public investment, which had 

already risen by 0.3 of a percentage point of GDP 

in 2008, is set to increase by another 0.6 of a 

percentage point of GDP in 2009 and by 0.3 in 

2010.  Other measures aimed at supporting activity 

comprise large tax cuts, especially in taxes paid by 

households. In particular, personal income tax 

brackets were raised by 9% (after a similar 

increase by 6% in 2008) in order to compensate for 

their non-indexation since 2001, leading to a 

decline in the taxes paid by households by about 

1.2 percentage points of GDP in 2009.  Even if 

these tax cuts had already been decided in the 2009 

budget before the aggrav
ation of the crisis and 
Member States, Luxembourg 
  119 were not originally designed to address it, they can 
also serve this purpose. 
The deficit could exceed 2% of GDP this year and 
widen to more than 4 % in both 2010 and 2011 (on 

an unchanged policy basis), as a result of the 

delayed effects of the recession on tax revenues 

and social transfers.  The public debt doubled in 

2008, due to the financing of the support to the 

financial sector. It could reach about 18% of GDP 

in 2011 but would still be one of the lowest in the 

EU. The current situation of public finance thus 

remains comparatively sound. However, the debt is 

set to increase in the coming decades due to the 

rise in age-related public expenditure and in 

particular in pension payments, which is projected 

to be one of the strongest in the EU.  
 16. HUNGARY 
Forceful adjustments help reduce economic vulnerabilities 
 120 Fragile situation at the onset of the crisis Hungary was in a fragile economic condition when 
the financial crisis broke out in autumn 2008. 

Labour productivity and thus potential output had 

started to decelerate some years earlier, while lax 

fiscal policy and growing private sector 

indebtedness had sustained domestic demand at 

elevated levels. Moreover, from 2004 onwards, the 

share of foreign-exchange-denominated debt also 

increased quickly. Despite the fiscal stimulus that 

raised the general government deficit to 9.3% of 

GDP in 2006, GDP grew by only 4% in that year, 

still lower than the average of the preceding years. 

The mid-2006 fiscal policy reversal, which was 

aimed at correcting the existing economic 

imbalances and restraini
ng the accumulation of the 
public debt, successfully re
duced the budget deficit 
to 3.8% of GDP by 2008.
(87)
 However, these 
corrective fiscal measur
es mainly focused on 
achieving higher revenues and not sufficiently on 

expenditure cuts based on structural reforms, 

which contributed to lower  GDP growth 

compared with most neighbouring countries and 

even old Member States 
in both 2007 and 2008. 
Initial effects of the crisis and short-term 
remedies In autumn 2008, in a context of reduced risk 
appetite linked to the global financial crisis, 

financial market conditions in Hungary rapidly 

deteriorated to the extent that the external 

financing needs of the government could no longer 

be met through market channels. Moreover, due to 

a sudden decline in external demand and high 

uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of 

the crisis, both exports and industrial production 

dropped at double digit rates in the fourth quarter 

of 2008. In the context of an absence of fiscal 

space and financing difficulties, the policy 

response consisted of continued fiscal 

consolidation and measures to support the financial 

sector. In November 2008, acknowledging the 

government™s commitment to maintain the fiscal 

consolidation process and to prevent a more severe 

financial market crash, a joint financial assistance 

of up to EUR 20 billion was provided to Hungary 
                                                          
 (87) In the context of second notification, the ESA95 general 
government deficit increased by 0.4 of a percentage point 
to 3.8% of GDP compared to 
the first notification in spring 
2009. 
by the EU, the IMF and the World Bank linked to 
policy conditions. In order to counteract the 

decreasing revenues caused by declining output, 

the government also implemented a mix of 

structural and temporary expenditure saving 

measures.  Second round effects in the downturn  In a controlled deleveraging process, financial 

institutions tightened credit conditions, which led 

to a decline in corporate lending and a negligible 

net flow to households during the first eight 

months of 2009, also in line with a limited demand 

for credit. Nevertheless, financial market 

conditions are expected to slowly but continuously 

improve over the forecast 
horizon as uncertainty 
about the recovery subsides and investor 

confidence picks up. 
Based on diminishing real wages and increased 
uncertainty regarding employment, consumption 

expenditure by households is foreseen to decline 

by more than 10% between 2008 and 2010. At the 

same time, fixed capital formation is also expected 

to decrease substantially due to financing 

difficulties and low capacity utilisation with the 

possible exception of infrastructure investments 

linked to EU funds. The depletion of inventories 

was extremely strong in the fourth quarter of 2008 

and the first quarter of 2009, when their 

contribution to the decline in GDP is estimated to 

have been around 4½ percentage points. However, 

net exports are projected to make a large positive 

contribution to growth as imports fall even faster 

than exports. GDP is forecast to decrease by 6½% 

in 2009, and to decline further in 2010 before 

returning to positive territory (at around 3%) in 

2011. 
The sharp decline in production has induced a 
pronounced flow from full-time employment to 

part-time and non-employment and has also 

capped wage expectations for those who remained 

active in the labour market. The drop in full-time-

equivalent employment in the private sector could 

be roughly 5% in 2009 and, due to a lagged 

response of the labour market, a further decline is 

expected in 2010. At
 the same time, the 
government launched its 'Pathway to Work' 

programme, which provided short-term 

employment in public services for a large number 
Member States, Hungary 
  121 of non-employed. Moreover, in an attempt to boost 
employment in a budget-neutral way, the 

authorities shifted a part of the tax burden from 

labour to consumption and wealth. All in all, these 

measures, together with growing unemployment 

and deleveraging in the financial markets, took a 

heavy toll on the purchasing power of households 

in the short run. 
The rapid adjustment in consumption and thus 
imports also induced a remarkable decline in the 

current account deficit, wh
ich improved from 7.2% 
of GDP in 2008 to 2.7% in the first quarter of 2009 

and turned into a 2.1% of GDP surplus by the 

second quarter of this year. It appears that the 

adjustment in the curr
ent account is heavily 
frontloaded: no further improvement is therefore 

foreseen in 2010. In the medium term, a smaller 

exportŒimport gap is expected, with the external 

deficit stabilising at a more sustainable level. 
Labour market challenges in a medium-term 
perspective Starting from 2011, the recovery is set to be 
largely supported by an improved external 

environment with both higher demand for 

Hungarian exports and better market sentiment in 

global finances. Moderate wage growth, low 

inflation and decreasing income taxes may 

enhance consumption and previously subdued 

investments may also accelerate. As a result, cost 

competitiveness should improve and attract 

additional direct investment. However, the 

structural problems of th
e labour market are likely 
to deepen during the crisis
 as high and persistent 
unemployment depletes acquired skills. This 

phenomenon, in combination with a permanently 

lower risk appetite, could set the stage for jobless 

and credit-less growth in the medium run. While 

growth could nonetheless become more balanced 

with a lower contribution from public and private 

consumption than previously, which would also 

suggest more sustainable external balances, the 

challenge of escaping a 'low-growth' trap will 

remain.
 Focus on consolidation of public finances General government revenues are forecast to 
decrease by about 6% in real terms in 2009 and by 

4% in 2010, reflecting mainly the deterioration of 

tax bases and to a smaller extent the reduction of 

the tax wedge on wages. In 2009 and 2010, this 

revenue shortfall is expected to be broadly 
counterbalanced by reforms in the pension system 
and in social transfers, and numerous saving 

measures, e.g. freezing the 
wage bill in the public 
sector. As a baseline scenario, ta
king into account adopted 
measures and the draft 2010 budget and applying 

the no-policy-change assumption, the general 

government deficit is forecast to come out at 

around 4% of GDP in the period 2009-2011.

exceed the government's target set at 3.9% of 

GDP, mainly due to the decreasing tax revenues 

related to diminishing corporate profits.   
In 2010, despite the already-adopted and additional 
budgeted measures, as well as the increased level 

of reserves, the deficit target of 3.8% of GDP is 

expected to be exceeded for several reasons. First, 

a larger local government deficit than foreseen in 

the draft budget (1.0% vs. 0.7% of GDP) is 

expected as the reductio
n of central support to 
local governments could be replaced by a 

depletion of their large liquid assets. Second, for 

the time being, the intended reduction of the 

subsidy (of 0.4% of GDP) for the state-owned 

railway company cannot be
 taken into account due 
to the lack of detailed measures. Third, 

expenditure is forecast 0.3% of GDP higher than 

planned in the draft 2010 budget, notably in the 

area of health care financing, partly linked to

overruns could not be counte
racted even if most of 
the 0.7% of GDP reserves were to be frozen 
(88)
. In 2011, the forecast reco
very should trigger the 
increase of the budget revenues, but this cyclical 

increase in revenues is not likely to be fully 

realised due to the decision to increase the ceiling 

of the lower personal income tax bracket from 5 to 

15 million forints. This measure, which is expected 

to lower the budget revenue by 0.6% of GDP, was 

already adopted by Parliament in June 2009 and 

will be effective as of 2011. Moreover, the 

expected losses (of about 0.4% of GDP) of the 

central bank in 2010 will also have to be 

compensated in 2011. Thus, under the no-policy-

change assumption, the de
ficit is expected to 
remain above the 3% of GDP threshold. 
This deficit forecast is subj
ect to risks. In 2009, it 
mainly refers to further expenditure overruns, 

notably in the health care system.  In 2010 and 

2011, the risk is higher and is mainly related to 

two factors. First, some measures that have 

recently supported the deficit reduction do not look 
sustainable (notably a fre
eze in public sector 
wages and expenditure by institutions, lower

spending on education, health care and the local 
government system without structural reform, and 

an increase in the carryover balance). Second, 

there is a risk of lower-than-budgeted revenues 

arising from insufficient companies' profits also in 

2010. 
The general government debt as a ratio of GDP is 
expected to increase significantly in 2009 and to 

reach its peak in 2010 at
 almost 80% of GDP, the 
highest among the central and eastern European 

countries. The drivers of 
this increase are the lower 
nominal GDP and the exchange rate depreciation 

in 2009 compared to 2008. A fall in the debt ratio 

is foreseen from the end of 2010, mainly in view 

of the expected use of the accumulated assets 

although the advance financing obligations of EU 

funds might partly counteract this trend. 
 17. MALTA 
Fragile recovery ahead 
 123 Slowing economic activity and policy 
responses Malta registered strong economic growth in the 
years preceding the global economic crisis. During 

2005-07, real GDP growth
 averaged almost 4%, 
mainly driven by domestic demand. Exports - 

dominated by electronics and tourism - expanded 

due to a growing services sector. Although euro-

area membership (since 2008) has cushioned the 

impact of the crisis by offering enhanced financial 

stability, the economy's resilience has come under 

strain, underscoring the importance of 

strengthening competitiveness.  
The global crisis affected Malta primarily through 
the trade channel as external demand for its 

products fell. Exports of electronics were hit hard, 

while the tourism sector suffered from fewer 

visitors from key source markets. Real GDP 

growth slowed in the last few months of 2008 as 

the global recession took its toll on Malta's small 

and open economy. In 2008 as a whole, real GDP 

growth decelerated to 2.1%. Domestic demand 

held up well as the strong growth in private and 

public consumption outweighed the sharp decline 

in investment caused by lower construction 

activity.  The impact of the global financial turmoil 

on the banking system was limited, reflecting the 

fact that banks are funded from resident deposits 

and their lending is almost exclusively local, while 

their involvement in inter-banking activity with 

overseas banks is limited. The liquidity position of 

the banking sector remains relatively strong even if 

the vulnerability of the system has increased, in the 

wake of the ongoing decline in property prices. 
With no need to directly assist the financial sector, 
Malta's response to the crisis consists of several 

fiscal measures to support 
the real sector in 2009. 
The main focus of the re
covery measures, which 
amount to around 1½% of GDP, is on increasing 

public infrastructure and on support to 

manufacturing, tourism and SMEs. At the same 

time, measures were taken to help contain the 

widening of the government deficit. 
Sharp output contraction gives way to a fragile 
recovery On the back of a significant contraction in output 
in the first half of the year, real GDP is expected to 
shrink by 2.2% in 2009. Even if on a quarterly 
basis the pace of contrac
tion eased in the second 
quarter of 2009, the scope for a quick turnaround 

appears limited. Economic activity is projected to 

gradually improve in 2010 and 2011, although 

growth is set to remain below historical trends.   
Declining exports will continue to weigh on real 
GDP throughout 2009. Imports are set to fall by 

slightly more than exports, due to weak domestic 

demand and the import-intensity of exports, 

leading to a positive contribution of net exports to 

GDP growth. Over the medium term, foreign sales 

of goods and services are projected to move into 

positive territory, albeit mildly in view of weak 

economic prospects in 
Malta's key trading 
partners, as well as unfavourable cost 

developments affecting the price-sensitive 

electronics and tourism sectors. Despite increased 

public capital spending, gross fixed capital 

formation is forecast to act as a drag on GDP 

growth in 2009 as low capacity utilisation, weak 

external demand and lower profits induce 

companies to scale back their investment plans, 

while construction activity is expected to remain 

weak. For 2010-11, investment is set to recover 

marginally, supported by the construction of a 

major ICT business park and improved conditions 

of foreign-owned companies, in line with the 

assumed global economic turnaround. Private 

consumption is set to contract in 2009 due to lower 

real disposable income stemming from rising 

unemployment and slower wage growth. This is 

expected to more than neutralise the support to 

purchasing power provided by personal income tax 

cuts and overall lower infl
ation. Looking forward, 
private consumption is anticipated to post a mild 

recovery, mainly as a result of improved labour 

market conditions.  
Risks to the macroeconomic outlook stem from a 
protracted period of weak external demand, given 

Malta's reliance on tr
ade flows. Private 
consumption may be dampened further as a result 

of deteriorating labour market conditions and 

possible adverse wealth effects from the correction 

in property prices. 
Wage growth exceeds productivity growth After moderating until 2007, wage inflation 

accelerated in 2008. Ap
art from cost-of-living 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  124 adjustments, these dynamics reflect pay increases 
in the public sector. Despite the contraction in 

output, nominal wages continued to accelerate in 

the first half of 2009 compared to the same period 

in the previous year, which may jeopardise 

competitiveness. In addition, the cost-of-living 

adjustment in line with the high inflation registered 

in the past months is expected to entail nominal 

wage growth above the eu
ro-area average in 2010, 
although the relatively flexible private sector 

wages may limit this development. Wage growth 

in excess of HICP inflation is also foreseen up to 

2010, boosted by negotiated rises in public sector 

pay. Despite a deceleratio
n from the peak reached 
in 2008, HICP inflation is projected to stay above 

the euro-area averag
e. Food prices are expected to 
remain dynamic over the forecast horizon. 

Notwithstanding increased competition in the 

distribution trade and lower global prices, 

domestic food prices have proved sticky. 
New high value-added services activities boosted 
productivity during 2004-07. Thereafter, 

productivity receded with th
e turn of the cycle as 
the slowing output was accompanied by a still 

relatively strong employment growth in 2008, led 

by ICT and remote gaming. It is anticipated that 

productivity will remain weak in 2009 as firms 

continue to hoard labour in sectors that have 

benefited from public financial support to retain 

workers, as well as those sectors with a high 

incidence of skilled workers. As a result, job 

growth will be low in the subsequent years. 

Although it will benefit from the expected 

turnaround in output growth, productivity gains are 

set to remain weak. Against this background, unit 

labour cost growth in Malta over the forecast 

horizon is projected to be above the euro-area 

average. This, coupled with the projected 

weakening of the dollar, which is the transaction 

currency used by the elect
ronics sector, may harm 
Malta's competitiveness. 
Restoring public finances Following years of fiscal 
consolidation, the general 
government deficit increased to 4.7% of GDP in 

2008 due to one-off early retirement payments to 

shipyards' employees, the 
reclassification of the 
yards in the general government sector and lower 

tax receipts. 
For 2009, the deficit is estimated to decline 
slightly to 4.5% of GDP. The worsening economic 

situation is expected to depress the tax intake. 
Indirect taxes are projected
 to decline by 0.7% on 
the back of weak private consumption, while social 

contributions are set to fall as a result of softer 

labour market conditions. 
Similarly, tax receipts on 
property transactions ar
e expected to decline, 
reflecting the cooling real estate market. In line 

with developments in cash data for the first eight 

months of 2009, revenue from direct taxes is 

projected to show some re
silience for the year as a 
whole, supported by an amnesty on past income 

tax dues and the part-recuperation of delayed tax 

payments owed by companies in 2008.  
Helped by favourable base effects related to the 
higher remuneration to hea
lth sector employees in 
2008 and the liquidation of the shipyards, the 

growth in government consumption expenditure is 

set to decelerate in 2009.
 Social transfers are 
projected to rise furthe
r amid higher healthcare 
running costs, rising age-related spending and 

higher demand for unemployment benefits. 

Subsidies, on the other hand, are foreseen to fall 

significantly mostly due to the withdrawal of aid to 

the water and energy providers. Capital spending is 

set to increase significantly, as the government 

embarks on environment and infrastructure 

investment projects and provides support to 

manufacturing as part of the economic recovery 

measures. Based on the no-policy-change assumption which 
does not include the forthcoming 2010 budget, the 

general government deficit is projected to decline 

marginally to 4.4% of GDP in 2010. Revenue is 

set to recover in line with the incipient economic 

turnaround, and to grow at a faster pace than 

expenditure. Receipts are anticipated to be buoyant 

primarily due to direct taxes as the delayed income 

tax owed by companies is assumed to be 

recuperated. Social contri
butions are also expected 
to increase as employment growth resumes.

     125 Expenditure is projected to grow steadily, partly 
stemming from more dynamic developments in the 

public sector wage bill and health and age-related 

costs. In 2011, assuming no policy change, the 

deficit is foreseen to decline further to 4.3% of 

GDP. Revenue is expected to continue to recover 

as tax-rich domestic demand improves. 

Expenditure growth is assumed to stabilise, partly 

reflecting the authorities' stated objective of 

following an expenditure-based fiscal 

consolidation. Moreover, with the expiration of the 

current public service 
collective agreement in 
2010, compensation of employees is assumed to 

grow in line with inflation in 2011. However, in 

the absence of concrete measures to tackle the 

spending pressures from healthcare and pensions, 

intermediate consumption and social benefits will 

increase at a sustained pace. Public investment is 

assumed to remain constant as a ratio to GDP. The 

general government debt is projected to continue 

on an upward path over
 the forecast horizon, 
increasing to around 72½% of GDP by 2011.  
18. THE NETHERLANDS 
Recovery from recession to be led by external demand 
 126 Strong downturn in 2008 leading to a strong 
policy response  As one of the most open economies in Europe the 
Netherlands could not remain untouched by the 

effects of the global economic and financial crisis. 

As a result, the high economic growth recorded in 

the Netherlands in 2006 and 2007 came to a 

sudden end in the second quarter of 2008. 

Thereafter, the economic 
downturn accelerated 
further, with a contraction of 1.1% quarter-on-

quarter in the fourth quarter, as exports were 

particularly severely hit by the abrupt fall in world 

trade.  A sizable effort
 from the government to 
stabilise financial markets helped financial 

institutions to cope with the crisis, although Dutch 

financial institutions remain vulnerable. Despite 

the sharp downturn, neither public finances nor the 

labour market reacted 
immediately, with the 
government budget still posting a surplus in 2008 

(0.7% of GDP) and unemployment even falling to 

2.8% during 2008.  
In response to the economic crisis, the Dutch 
government adopted a total of three recovery 

packages, containing stimulus measures which 

were broadly in line with the EERP. The first two 

packages, which were adopted at the end of 2008 

and the beginning of 2009 amounted to ½% of 

GDP in both 2009 and 2010. The third package 

adopted in March 2009 in view of a further 

economic deterioration, was roughly twice the size 

of the two previous packages taken together, 

providing a total stimulus of around 2%. The 

stimulus measures were aimed at the areas most 

affected by the crisis, 
focusing on household 
purchasing power, private (and public) investment 

and employment protection.  
Economy hit by weak external and domestic 
demand GDP growth is projected
 to only just escape 
negative territory at the end of 2009, after six 

consecutive quarters of
 negative growth. The 
moderate recovery is expected to come from a 

rebound in external demand and should lead to 

zero growth in the fourth 
quarter. Overall in 2009, 
GDP should fall by 4½%, which is the sharpest 

contraction ever registered. In 2010, domestic 

demand is foreseen to show a protracted decrease, 

mostly due to lingering wealth effects, but its 
negative contribution to GDP growth will most 
likely be more than offset by a positive one from 

net exports so that GDP growth comes out at 0.3%. 

A recovery in domestic demand, notably in private 

consumption, should then lead to a further 

recovery of economic growth - to 1.6% - in 2011.  
Exports, which account for almost 80% of GDP, 
are expected to fall sharply in 2009, which will 

undoubtedly have a considerable negative impact 

on GDP growth. In line with the recovery in world 

trade, exports should post positive growth again in 

2010 and 2011. In combination with the projected 

slower recovery of domestic demand, which leads 

to slower import growth, the contribution of net 

exports in 2010 and 2011 should be positive 

overall.    
The global economic and financial crisis provoked 
a sharp decrease in asset prices. The resulting 

negative wealth effects led to a strong contraction 

in private consumption expenditure in the first half 

of 2009, despite a rise in real disposable income 

resulting from pre-crisis wage negotiations.

Negative wealth effects seem to have a larger 
impact on consumption in the Netherlands than in 

other European countries. Household wealth is 

influenced by falling asset prices, both directly via 

households' role as investors, and indirectly 

through the impact on pension fund assets.  The 

wealth losses suffered by
 households are foreseen 
to have a prolonged upward effect on their saving 

rate which is expected to increase by about 5 pp. in 

2009 to 18%. In combination with precautionary 

saving, in view of adverse unemployment 

expectations this should lead to a further 
Member States, The Netherlands 
  127 contraction of private consumption in 2010. As the 
labour market adjusts to lower production levels, 

unemployment is expected to roughly double over 

the forecast period, to 
around 6%. Un
til now, the 
increase in unemployment 
has been dampened by 
flexible working hour arrangements, the part-time 

working scheme introduced by the government and 

labour hoarding, as companies are reluctant to let 

qualified personnel go. With unemployment 

growth expected to st
art decreasing from 2011 
onwards, the savings rate is expected to start to 

(slowly) adjust downwards. 
A sharp decrease in production caused by global 
weak demand and tightening credit conditions,     

resulted in a historically low capacity utilisation 

rate. This, combined with widespread declines in 

profits and the need to strengthen their balance 

sheets, means that businesses are expected to 

sharply cut their investment by almost 15% in 

2009. The strongest decline will most likely be 

recorded by cyclically-sensitive investment. 

Construction should show a prolonged contraction, 

which could last well into 2010, because of its 

relatively long planning period, resulting in a 

negative private investment growth close to 8% in 

2010. With replacement investment picking up 

again, gross fixed capital formation is foreseen to 

recover moderately in 2011, showing a growth of 

½%. Graph II.18.2:

forecast
 Since consumer gas prices are only adjusted twice 
a year, energy prices tend to have long adjustment 

lags in the Netherlands. This led to part of the 

sharp increase in energy prices in 2008 only being 

passed through to consumer prices in the first half 

of 2009. This limits the expected decrease in 

inflation in 2009, which is now projected to come 

out at around 1% in 2009, from just over 2% in 

2008. For 2010 and 2011, 
inflation is forecast to 
remain relatively stable as it will remain difficult 
for producers to strongly in
crease prices to restore 
profit margins.  
This scenario is subject to both positive and 
negative risks. On the positive side, a more 

dynamic recovery in world trade would lead to a 

stronger contribution of exports to growth. 

Negative risks are mainly related to ongoing 

uncertainties in the financial sector. The risk to the 

stability of the financial sector has not yet fully 

disappeared, due to its relatively large exposure to 

troubled markets. This may 
also lead to a structural lower supply of credit, which could hamper a 

sustained economic recovery.  
Sustained recovery linked to competitiveness Although the significantly positive trade balance in 

2008 pointed to a relatively favourable competitive 

stance, a closer look rev
eals that Dutch price and 
cost competitiveness have been deteriorating since 

2000 as unit labour costs have increased more 

sharply than in neighbouring countries. The 

dynamic development of unit labour costs is 

mainly due to a relatively strong increase in 

compensation of employees and to a much lesser 

extent to productivity developments. Despite a 

policy of wage moderation in 2004 and 2005, 

employees have profited from a generally tight 

labour market over the past years, which put 

upward pressure on wages. For the coming years, 

the government has announced a renewed policy 

of wage moderation. Combined with the expected 

loosening of the labour market, this could exert 

downward pressure on wage increases, thereby 

improving competitiveness. This would in turn 

increase the probability for the Netherlands to 

benefit fully from the expected recovery in 

external demand in 2010 and 2011. 
 In the short run, labour supply is negatively 
affected by discouraged workers. Some rigidity in 

the labour market, as re
flected for example by 
difficulties in work-to-work transitions, may lead 

to some hysteresis in the aftermath of the crisis. 

This could also hamper labour productivity and 

could eventually limit the possibilities for future 

real wage growth without damaging 

competitiveness. In the long run, the labour market 

is expected to tighten agai
n, as a result of ageing. 
This will lead to a structural decrease in the labour 

force and thus in labour supply, which could have 

an adverse effect on future wage growth and 

competitiveness.

     128 Rapid deterioration of public finances  In 2009, the budget is foreseen to show the 
sharpest drop ever record
ed in the Netherlands. 
The surplus of 0.7% of GDP posted in 2008 has 

turned into a deficit of 4.7% of GDP in 2009. 

Despite the relatively good starting position, the 

recovery measures taken by the government in 

response to the economic crisis, the full working of 

the automatic stabilisers and decreasing gas 

revenues have eroded the budgetary position very 

quickly. In 2010, the deficit will most likely widen 

further to over 6% of GDP, as unemployment 

benefits and interest expenditure in particular will 

show further increases.   
The recovery packages, amounting to about 1% of 
GDP in 2009, are planned to be continued in 2010. 

Depending on growth dynamics, they will be 

(partially) reversed in 2011. Furthermore, 

government plans indicate the start of 

consolidation in 2011. This would lead to an 

improvement of the budget to around 5½% of 

GDP in 2011.   
After the sharp increase in the debt level in 2008, 
because of government operations to stabilise the 

financial markets (amounting to approximately 

15% of GDP), debt is set to increase further over 

the forecast period, mainly as a result of the 
deficits exceeding nominal GDP growth. In 2009 it 
would come very close to 60.0% of GDP and 

should further increase to 70% of GDP in 2011, 

reaching a level not recorded since 1996. 
In March 2009, the government updated the 
budgetary framework by 
removing the cyclically 
sensitive unemployment benefits from the 

expenditure ceilings. This measure prevented pro-

cyclical budget cuts as a result of increasing 

unemployment. It also resulted in a strengthening 

of the automatic stabilisers, which at the same time 

negatively affected the general government 

balance. In principle this is a temporary measure, 

although there is not yet a clear indication of how 

it will eventually be reintegrated under the 

expenditure ceiling. 
Measures were also announced to improve the 
long-term sustainability of public finances. Most 

importantly, the government decided to increase 

the pensionable age from 65 to 67 in two steps (to 

66 in 2020 and 67 in 2025).    
19. AUSTRIA 
From export-led recession to gradual export-led recovery 
 129 Gradual slowdown turns into recession The global financial and economic crisis has 
pushed the Austrian eco
nomy into the deepest 
recession in post-war history. The Austrian 

financial system was fairly well balanced at the 

onset of the crisis, mainly due to the predominance 

of a retail banking system, sound balance sheets in 

the corporate and financial sector, the absence of a 

domestic real estate bubble and only negligible 

financial investment in toxic assets. However, the 

Austrian economy was unabl
e to escape the global 
shock-waves of the financial crisis. As 

international financial markets' risk aversion 

towards countries in Central and Eastern Europe 

(CEE) rose sharply, the strong engagement of 

Austrian banks in this region led to a critical 

international reassessment. As a consequence, 

bank share values dropped sharply and risk premia 

for Austrian bank credit-default swaps increased. 

In addition, the economic downturn has primarily 

been transmitted to the Austrian economy by 

falling exports, reflecting the collapse in world 

trade, and shrinking fixed investment in the light 

of declining demand as well as tighter credit 

market conditions. As a consequence of the slump, 

labour market conditions and public finances are 

set to deteriorate sharply in 2009 and 2010. 
After three years of strong mainly export-driven 
growth, economic activity in Austria lost 

momentum already in 2008. Initially the gradual 

deceleration was caused by weakening consumer 

demand stemming from a fall in the purchasing 

power of private households caused in turn by of a 

sharp increase in inflation. 
In the second half of the 
year external factors b
ecame predominant, in the 
wake of the evolving global economic crisis.  
Policy measures to support recovery At the end of 2008, monetary and fiscal policy 

initiatives were undertaken across the world with 

the aim of dampening the downturn and stabilising 

financial markets. As part of the European 

Economic Recovery Plan
 (EERP) the Austrian 
government introduced discretionary fiscal 

measures providing a timely stimulus, as a large 

part of these took effect in the first four months of 

2009. Two economic recovery programmes, 

income tax cuts and two labour-market-support 

packages were introduced which focused on 
supporting income, reducing lay-offs and 
improving access to training, sustaining investment 

and facilitating access by the private sector to 

finance. Support to credit-constrained enterprises 

came mainly in off-budget
 form as guarantees and 
subsidised loans. To support the automotive sector, 

a premium was offered for scrapping old cars in 

conjunction with the purchase of new ones. 

Together with fiscal meas
ures taken in 2008 to 
support private household purchasing power, 

which became effective in 
2009, fiscal support to 
the tune of 1½% of GDP was implemented in 

2009. In addition to discretionary measures, 

automatic stabilisers were allowed to operate 

freely. As a small and ve
ry open economy, Austria 
benefited from action taken by other countries 

within the EERP. It is estimated that the stimulus 

undertaken by Austria's European partners almost 

doubled the supportive impulse taken by the 

Austrian government, highlighting the importance 

of coordinated fiscal measures. 
The banking sector suffered from profit reductions 
in 2008, in particular from their foreign activities 

in CEE, where Austrian banks hold the largest 

share of total foreign claims. To stabilise financial 

markets, several measures were taken, including: 

guarantees of bank deposits held by individuals; 

and the provision of guarantees up to 24% of GDP 

for interbank loans, bond issues by the newly-

funded Austrian Clearing Bank and commercial 

paper issues by banks. In addition, the government 

has allocated up to EUR 15 billion (5½% of GDP) 

for capital injections and 
asset relief measures to 
financial institutions. By the end of September 

2009, EUR 6 billion of these funds had effectively 

been called. As indicated by assessments by the 

Austrian financial market surveillance authorities, 

the Austrian financial sector is still in a solid 

position and would remain so even if, in contrast to 

the forecast presented here, economic prospects in 

Austria and CEE were to deteriorate more sharply. 
A deep recession in 2009 The outlook features a sh
arp contraction of the 
economy over 2009: GDP is projected to shrink by 

3¾%, reflecting a severe fall in net exports and 

private investment. Private consumption growth, 

although much lower than
 in recent years, has 
become a stabilising factor.  
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  130 Foreign trade declined strongly in the first half of 
2009, as the recession in 
Austria™s main trading 
partners (Germany, Italy and some of the new 

member states in CEE) deepened. Although the 

external competiveness of the Austrian 

manufacturing sector further improved in 2008, the 

negative external demand effects could not be 

avoided. The strongly export-oriented 

manufacturing sector has suffered most, as 

merchandise exports are forecast to shrink by 16% 

in 2009. As a consequence,
 private investment in 
equipment is set to fall by 12% in 2009, because of 

worsening corporate profits, low capital utilisation, 

higher lending margins and tighter credit 

conditions, especially for la
rger enterprises, which 
also face tighter conditi
ons for issuing corporate 
bonds and raising equity capital. Due to several 

fiscal measures (such as infrastructure investment 

and subsidies for thermal renovation of buildings), 

the projected decline is le
ss severe for investment 
in construction.  
Despite lower capital in
come and a weakening 
labour market, private consumption should benefit 

from rising real disposable income, as wages 

increase, inflation has dropped off quickly, income 

taxes have been cut, and transfer payments have 

risen. As a result, and in contrast to most other 

euro-area countries, real
 private consumption is 
projected to increase, by 
½% in 2009. At the same 
time, it is expected that a 
large part of the increase 
in disposable income will be saved by private 

households, thereby raising the savings rate.

forecast
 Signs of a muted but steady recovery Business surveys and other leading indicators point 
to an improving economic situation since the 

middle of 2009 and economic growth is expected 

to resume as of the third quarter of 2009. While 
private domestic demand may still stay sluggish 
for some time, fiscal policy is set to stimulate 

demand also in 2010. As a consequence, the 

domestic component of economic activity will 

remain policy-driven, while endogenous forces of 

growth are too weak to s
timulate a self-sustained 
recovery. Foreign demand is expected to 

strengthen gradually as a result of support from 

policy worldwide, leading to a pick-up in Austrian 

exports. Subsequently, domestic industrial output 

will start growing again. Indeed, some firms have 

already reacted and switche
d back from short-time 
work to normal working hours. The slump in 

investment in machinery and equipment is 

expected to come to an end with a revival of 

industrial production. Tax incentives for 

enterprises in 2010 are 
also likely to encourage 
firms to invest in new production facilities. 

Equipment investment is thus expected to edge up 

slightly but, due to a strong negative carry-over 

from 2009, the annual growth rate is likely to be 

still negative in 2010. While investment in public 

infrastructure is set to be supported by the fiscal 

stimulus packages, private residential building is 

expected to be trimmed further. Hence, domestic 

construction is expected to stay on a downward 

trend also in 2010. 
For 2010 and 2011, 
GDP growth is fo
recast to pick 
up gradually to 1% and 1½% respectively. 

However, this scenario is subject to both positive 

and negative risks. On the positive side, a stronger 

recovery for the Europe
an economy as a whole 
could also lead to stronger demand for goods 

produced by Austrian firms, reinforcing the growth 

contribution of net exports and domestic fixed 

investment. If, however, the expected recovery of 

international trade is weaker, this would also drag 

down the prospects for 
the Austrian economy.  
Low inflation and wages are set to moderate Strong increases in food 
and energy prices resulted 
in a high rate of inflation in 2008 (3.2%). In 2009, 

consumer prices are expected to rise by a mere 

½%, mainly on the back of strong base effects 

from declining fuel and heating oil prices and the 

downward pressure on profit margins from weak 

demand conditions. As commodity prices are 

expected to rise, inflation is forecast to rise to 

+1¼% in 2010. With the recovery gaining ground 

and a gradual rebound in profit margins, a further, 

yet small, increase in inflation is expected for 

2011. Wage settlements negotiated for 2009 were 

based on the higher rate of inflation and strong

    131 productivity growth in th
e previous years. As a 
reaction to the deterioration of economic activity 

in 2009, government policy measures to shield the 

labour market dampened the decrease in 

employment. As a consequence, productivity is 

expected to fall sharply while unit labour costs are 

set to rise. However, this increase is overstated to 

some extent because part of the wage costs for 

employees in short-time work is borne by the 

government. For 2010 and 2011, rising 

unemployment and low inflation are likely to 

contain wage pressures. 
Despite a gradual slowdown of GDP growth in 
2008 employment continued to expand by 1.8%. In 

2009 and 2010, employment prospects will reflect 

both the weakness of economic activity and policy 

measures shielding the labour market. Short-time 

work and extended training in particular contribute 

to a smaller fall in employment than might have 

been expected given the s
cale of the contraction in 
activity. Total employment is forecast to fall by 

1½% in 2009 and ¾% in 2010. Consequently, 

unemployment should increase sharply, from 3.8% 

of the workforce in 2008 to 5½% in 2009 and 6% 

in 2010. For 2011 only a slight improvement of 

labour market conditions is expected. 
Public finances set to deteriorate  Public finances are set to deteriorate rapidly in 

2009 to a deficit of 4¼% of GDP, and to worsen 

further to 5½% of GDP in 2010. This is the result 

of discretionary tax cuts and an erosion of tax 

bases and higher social expenditure in the wake of 

the recession. In addition, Austria has launched 

several fiscal measures to address the effects of the 

economic crisis on the real economy. In the light 

of the more critical assessment of the foreign 

business activities of Austrian banks and 

government support for financial markets, the risk 

premium on Austrian government long-term bonds 

also soared by as much as 130 basis point in early 

2009. Although in the spring, the long-term 

interest rate spread vi
s-à-vis Germany came down 
again to around 50 basis points, it is still above 

pre-crisis levels. The financial markets support 

measures passed at the 
end of 2008 led to an 
increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio without raising 

the deficit. As a result of the expansionary fiscal 

stance and automatic stabilisers, government debt 

is expected to rise rapidly to 77% of GDP in 2011 

after having dipped below 60% in 2007. Restoring 

the long-term sustainability of public finances will 

involve tackling fiscal cons
olidation once the crisis 
has abated, while supporting the still weak 

economic recovery and enhancing long-term 

potential growth prospects. 
20. POLAND 
Weathering the crisis relatively well 
 132 Strong resilience during the crisis, supported by 
a mix of factors Poland™s rapid growth over 2003-08 (5.1% on 
average over the period) did not give rise to any 

major macroeconomic imbalances, even if the 

economy started to face capacity utilisation 

constraints by the end of the period. The external 

position remained sustainable and the economic 

boom facilitated the reduction of the government 

deficit to a relatively low level Œ below 2 % of 

GDP in 2007. These sound fundamentals have 

helped the Polish economy weather the global 

crisis better than other central and eastern 

European countries. W
ith real GDP growth 
projected at around 1¼%, 
Poland is expected to be 
the only country in the EU to post positive growth 

in 2009.  
The resilience of the economy during the crisis 
also reflects a number of othe
r factors. First, with a 
ratio of exports to GDP of about 40%, the Polish 

economy is relatively cl
osed compared to its 
regional peers, which limited the size of the 

demand shock related to the sharp fall in exports at 

the turn of the year (12% in the first half of 2009, 

year-on-year). Second, 
the depreciation of the 
currency (down 41% agai
nst the euro over the 
period August 2008-Fabruary 2009) is set to 

translate into a positive contribution of net exports 

in 2009, as the estimated fall in exports should be 

more than offset by the even larger projected fall 

in imports. The latter is being driven by the decline 

in domestic demand and a price-driven shift in its 

composition from imported goods towards 

domestically produced goods and non-tradables. 

Third, an investment-focused recovery plan and 

the inflow of EU funds have partly cushioned the 

decline in investment, which was severely affected 

by the underutilisation of production capacities and 

tighter credit conditions. Fourth, fiscal measures in 

support of households' disposable income (cuts in 

personal income tax rates and high indexation of 

pensions) have limited the deceleration of private 

consumption.  
The Polish banking system has been resilient 
during the crisis, mainly due to the predominance 

of universal banks, a relatively conservative 

regulatory policy and sound balance sheets in the 

corporate and financial sectors.  Still, the crisis has 

increased risk aversion in the banking sector, 
which has led to a tightening of lending conditions, 
particularly for the corporate sector.  
Extended slowdown and muted rebound over 
the forecast horizon The outlook features sluggish growth in 2010 and 
a moderate rebound in 2011. Real GDP is 

projected to increase by 1¾% in 2010 and 3¼% in 

2011. The main drivers of this recovery are the 

recovery plan, the gradual 
rebound of global trade, 
and softer monetary conditions Œ reflecting 

monetary easing and the easing of financial stress 

in international capital markets.  
The recovery is however likely to be delayed by 
unfavourable labour market developments at the 

turn of 2009-10, reflecting a lagged response to the 

effects of the economic downturn. Falling 

employment and slowing real wages should weigh 

on real disposable inco
me and, combined with 
higher precautionary savings, depress 

consumption. Investment spending is expected to 

be moderately positive in 2010, the planned 

growth in public investment being almost totally 

offset by the expected fall in private investment, 

which is in turn explained by still tight financing 

conditions, falling housing investment and 

overcapacity in certain sectors. The rebound in 

external demand is set to support export growth in 

2010, though the increase 
in market shares may 
already be negatively a
ffected by the recent 
appreciation of the curre
ncy (up 11% against the 
euro over the period Febr
uary-September 2009).

Poland - GDP growth and contributions
pps.
 In 2011, real GDP growth is projected to further 
accelerate to about 3¼%. As the effects of the 
Member States, Poland 
  133 crisis fade away and the world economy continues 
to recover, these developments should be 

supported by stronger domestic demand and export 

growth. The stabilisation of the situation in the 

labour market is set to underpin a recovery in 

private consumption. In parallel, higher FDI 

inflows, public spending in infrastructure, growing 

capacity utilisation and a recovery in the housing 

market are projected to
 support investment. 
Stronger export growth is expected in 2011. 

However, the increase in domestic demand, 

combined with the appreci
ation of the currency 
fuelling imports in 2010, should also lead to an 

acceleration of import growth, turning the 

contribution of net exports to growth slightly 

negative.  
Inflation is expected to remain low over the 
forecast horizon, reflecting the large negative 

output gap following the crisis and the dampening 

effects of the appreciatin
g currency in 2010. It 
should however slightly increase in 2011, pushed 

up by the rebound in economic activity and, to a 

lesser extent, in unit labour costs.  
This scenario is subject to both positive and 
negative risks. On the positive side, a more 

resilient labour market and lower precautionary 

household savings would boost private spending. 

On the negative side, a stronger appreciation of the 

currency could hamper 
exports while increasing 
the cost competitiveness of imported goods and 

contributing negatively to growth. In addition, the 

deteriorating situation of public finances could 

affect market sentiment adversely, thus limiting 

financial inflows and increasing the costs of 

borrowing.   
Sustainable growth dependent on labour 
market reforms While the Polish economy has remained 
surprisingly resilient during the crisis, a key 

challenge for the years ahead is to ensure that it 

remains on a sustainable growth path over the 

medium-term. One of the main issues in this 

respect is the low labour force participation rate. 

The sustained and robust economic performance of 

the economy since 2003 has translated into 

growing employment and a steeply falling 

unemployment rate. However, the employment 

rate has remained low (59.2% in 2008).  More 

specifically, Poland's labour market challenge 

seems to be particularly acute at both ends of the 

working age population, with a poor relative 
performance for both relatively young and 
relatively old workers. The high unemployment 

and low participation rates of young workers might 

be partly explained by a relatively high minimum 

wage (which may discourage firms from hiring the 

least productive workers), the return of emigrants 

affected by the crisis in other EU countries, and the 

poor quality occupational education system which 

does not always provide young workers with the 

appropriate skills. The participation of older 

workers in the labour market is discouraged by a 

relatively generous early retirement system and a 

high tax wedge, although recent reforms have 

improved the situation. 
Increased competitiveness would also boost 
growth The depreciation of the currency has played a key 
role in supporting growth by improving the price 

competitiveness of Polish exports and limiting 

imports. However, this effect will vanish in the 

coming quarters and in the medium-term the 

competitiveness of the export sector will largely 

depend on its capacity to continue to upgrade the 

product structure, which is gradually moving in the 

direction of research-intensive goods and high-

technology industries. As there is a risk that the 

contribution of foreign direct investments to this 

change in specialisation will be more limited in the 

future, domestically driven productivity 

improvements induced by investments in R&D 

will have to play an even more important role than 

in the past. 
 Persistently high structural fiscal deficits The structural position of Polish government 
finances was relatively weak at the outset of the 

crisis. The headline deficit had been reduced to 

below 2% of GDP in 2007, but this was in a period 

of high real GDP growth during which the 

economy was operating above potential. The sharp 

swing in the output gap from positive to negative 

territory between 2007 and 2009 exposed these 

underlying problems, and the general government 

deficit is set to widen by 4½ percentage points of 

GDP in that period.  
Poland is expected to experience a sizeable 
deterioration of its government finances in 2009-

11, with the general government deficit forecast to 

rise from 3.6% of GDP in 2008 to 6.4% of GDP in 

2009 and about 7½% in 2010 and 2011. While the 

projected increase in the deficit mainly reflects the

    134 effects of the economic dow
nturn, its overall size 
reflects a persistently high structural deficit, which 

is expected to hover at about 6½% of GDP over 

the forecast period. These 
projections take into 
account the 2010 draft budget. 
The expected worsening of government finances in 
2009 in part reflects the effect of discretionary 

measures, mainly the personal income tax cut with 

a budgetary cost estimated 
at about ¾ p.p. of GDP 
in 2009. The deterioration in tax revenues is 

mainly due to the unfavourable composition of 

growth. On the expenditure side, social transfers 

have been dynamic, reflecting their indexation to 

past prices and wages. In addition, the impact of 

the replacement of early pensions with less costly 

ﬁbridge pensionsﬂ, which appears to have reduced 

the number of new early retirees, was offset by an 

increase in unemployment benefits as well as a rise 

in regular retirement and other types of transfers, 

such as sickness benefits, 
as a result of the crisis. 
In 2010, total expenditure is projected to increase 

by 2 pps. of GDP, mainly on the back of increasing 

social transfers and intere
st expenditure, and a very 
high increase in the public investment ratio (by 

about 1½ pp. of GDP). The latter is however 

supposed to be broadly neutral for the fiscal 

balance because it will be to large extent financed 

by more capital transfers fr
om the EU funds. This 
absorption should contribute strongly to the 
stimulation of the economy, while enhancing the 
long-term growth potential through an upgrade of 

public infrastructure.  
As a consequence of high deficits, gross debt is 
projected to increase shar
ply from slightly above 
47% of GDP in 2008 to more than 61% in 2011. 

The projected debt figures are subject to 

significant uncertainty because of the high 

volatility of the exchange rate and the ensuing 

valuation effects of the foreign-denominated part 

of the debt (which is more than ¼ of the total 

debt). Finally, given the higher global risk aversion 

of investors, interest expenditure is projected to 

rise significantly over the period, further limiting 

the margin for manoeuvre on the fiscal side.  
21. PORTUGAL 
Gradual and shallow recovery 
 135 Impact of the crisis and policy response in 
2009 Since the early 2000s, Portugal has been recording 
weak economic growth below the euro-area 

average. This has been characterised by 

persistently low productivity, eroded 

competitiveness, rising unemployment and a 

sizeable external deficit. The current crisis has 

exacerbated these weaknesses and some of those 

imbalances are being corrected only slowly and 

partially. Under the impact of the international 

crisis, GDP began to fall already in late 2008, 

reversing the earlier mild upward trend. Annual 

GDP stagnated. In 2009, GDP is projected to 

contract by nearly 3%, with all its components 

falling, barring government consumption. Exports, 

imports and investment are contracting most, by 

over double-digit figures, while the fall in private 

consumption is relatively contained. 
The policy response to the crisis has consisted 
mainly of the implementation of discretionary 

measures to stimulate the 
economy, together with 
the pursuit of structural
 reforms. The fiscal 
stimulus Œ focused on public investment, social 

protection and support to employment, investment 

and exports by the privat
e sector Œ has amounted 
to about 1¼% of GDP in 2009. Some other fiscal 

measures include support to households and firms 

as well as a cut of one point in the standard VAT 

rate already in mid-2008. At the same time, while 

the direct impact of the financial crisis on the 

Portuguese banking sector has been relatively 

contained, a series of measures have been 

implemented to strengthen financial stability. 

Against this backdrop, the challenge is to put the 

Portuguese economy on a footing of higher and 

sustained long-term GDP growth, while restoring 

competitiveness. These ar
e necessary conditions 
for a sustained reduction of the large external 

deficit. 
Mild recovery over the forecast period  The current outlook is one of stagnation of 

economic activity in 2010, to be followed by a 

moderated upswing in 2011, with GDP growing by 

1%. Domestic demand is projected to essentially 

stagnate in 2010, mirroring a mild recovery of 

private consumption and still shrinking investment. 

However, growth in investment is set to turn 
moderately positive, thus pushing domestic 
demand to increase more significantly in 2010.  
Sluggish labour income, with the unemployment 
rate reaching historical hi
ghs is expected to lead 
private consumption to be relatively weak in 2011. 

In addition, after a trough in interest rates, the 

burden of servicing the relatively high level of 

household debt will dampen disposable income. At 

the same time, access to credit remains more 

difficult than in the past as the result of tighter 

credit conditions imposed by financial institutions, 

in the context of high household indebtedness. The 

saving rate of households is expected to remain at 

around 8% of gross disposable income, higher than 

the rates recorded in recent years. 
Investment is projected to keep falling in 2010 and 
to recover mildly in 2011. Against still weak 

demand prospects and dampened profitability, few 

incentives will exist for investment. In addition, 

the coming years are expected to be characterised 

by the consolidation of corporate balance sheets as 

average credit conditions are likely to be stricter

forecast
 The present outlook for domestic demand is 
subject to a number of in
terrelated uncertainties. 
On the one hand, the recent fall in interest rates 

could relieve debt service burdens for both 

households and corporations still well into 2010. 

And the record low inflation rates could underpin 

real disposable income growth more than assumed 

in the current outlook. On the other hand, subdued 

employment prospects, and especially the 

possibility of a rise in long-term unemployment, 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  136 might damage confidence and lead to a further rise 
in household savings. Last but not least, given the 

large borrowing needs of the Portuguese economy, 

mirroring the large external deficit, the pace of 

domestic spending and savings will crucially 

depend on the financial conditions that prevail in 

the future. 
Exports are projected to
 follow the external 
demand recovery, which is expected to be shallow 

given the rather bleak outlook for imports by the 

country's main trading partners, notably Spain, 

which accounts for around a quarter of Portuguese 

exports. In addition, an e
xpected deterioration in 
competitiveness will limit the rebound in exports 

in the medium term. The contraction in imports is 

expected to be smaller in 2010. Imports are 

expected to grow in 2011, largely following the 

path of final demand. All in all, the contribution of 

net exports to GDP growth is forecast to remain 

positive, while declining in both 2010 and 2011. 
Unemployment continues to raise challenges 
for labour market functioning The crisis keeps weighing on employment, which 
is projected to shrink by 
nearly ½% in 2010, after a 
significant contraction of 2¼% this year. In 2010 

and 2011, the unemployment rate may reach some 

9¼%, the highest rate in decades. Yet the increase 

in the unemployment rate
 is expected to be 
dampened by the fall in labour participation. Wage 

moderation is expected to follow but only in a 

gradual way.  
External deficit remains large– With the crisis the current account deficit is set to 

fall from 12% of GDP in 2008 to 10% of GDP in 

2009. But the correction 
is not expected to 
continue over the medium term. The trade balance, 

affected by a weak e
xports performance and a 
rebound in commodities prices, is expected to 

hinder any further improvements in 2010 and 

2011. Overall, this unsustainable external deficit 

path highlights the insufficiency of the domestic 

savings and the competitiveness position.  
The long period of large external deficits has 
added to net external liabilities that have now 

reached 100% of GDP. Th
e servicing of these 
liabilities will continue to absorb a non-negligible 

share of income over the medium term, mirrored in 

the deficit in the primary income balance. The 

primary income deficit is already a major 
component of the current account as well as an 
element of rigidity in the narrowing of the overall 

external deficit. As a re
sult, the gap between the 
gross domestic product and gross national income 

remains large.  
–while productivity growth remains sluggish–  Thus, addressing the external imbalance hinges 

upon a sustained recovery
 in the trade balance, 
which depends on the competitive position of the 

country. Productivity growth in Portugal has been 

sluggish during the last 
decade, partly on account 
of labour market rigidities such as high 

employment protection and insufficient human 

capital accumulation. These weaknesses have led 

to a further widening of the large productivity gap 

with respect to the 
euro-area. Measured 
productivity is projected to grow by just over ¾% 

on average in 2010/2011, thus remaining below the 

euro-area average. From a longer term perspective, 

the challenge is to lift productivity growth in a 

sustained way, which will support competitiveness 

as well as boosting potential GDP growth.  
Cost competitiveness developments also reflect 
inadequate wage and price behaviour, including 

also the weak response of wages to productivity 

and labour market developments. After growing 

strongly in 2009, nominal compensation per 

employee is projected to decelerate to 2% in 2010 

and 2011, above productivity growth. Furthermore, 

combined productivity and wage developments are 

expected to lead to higher unit labour costs growth 

than in most of the country's main trading partners, 

thereby hampering the potential of the external 

sector to contribute more 
to the recovery in overall 
economic activity.

     137 1¼% in 2010 and 2011. Wh
ereas, the prices of oil 
and other commodities have been a key driver of 

the negative inflation rate in 2009, they may create 

some inflationary pressures in 2010 and 2011. 

However, sluggish demand prospects are an 

offsetting factor. After a negative inflation 

differential with the euro area in 2008 and 2009, 

the gap may turn positive again in the years ahead. 
–and public finances deteriorate Public finances are strongly affected by the fall in 

economic activity. In 2009, the government deficit 

is expected to be 8% of GDP in 2009, after 

recording 2.7% of GDP in 2008. 
Fiscal slippages in 2009 reflect the severity of the 
economic downturn. Notably, sharp falls in tax 

revenue are being recorded and, at the same time, a 

rocketing expenditure-to-GDP ratio is expected 

given the fall in nominal GDP coupled with a 

marginal acceleration in underlying spending. The 

upswing in spending is the result of higher 

increases in nominal gove
rnment wages and social 
benefits outlays when compared with earlier years, 

as well as of the customary anti-cyclical behaviour 

of a number of social transfers. In addition, 

discretionary measures taken largely in response to 

the downturn and amounting to around 1½% of 
GDP in 2009 are weighing further on the 
budgetary position.  
On the basis of unchanged policies, the 
government deficit is expected to remain largely 

stable in 2010 and to rise to 8¾% of GDP in 2011. 

Although the assumed reversal in 2010 of most of 

the 2009 temporary fiscal expansion measures, as 

announced in the January 2009 update of the 

Stability Programme, will relieve some pressure 

from public finances, 
the sluggish pace of 
economic activity will not help narrow the fiscal 

imbalance. It is not only government revenue that 

is hurt by the downturn: expenditure too is 

expected to grow in exces
s of the sluggish nominal 
GDP over the entire forecast period. 
With high deficits and continued low GDP growth, 
government debt is risi
ng rapidly, and may reach 
as much as 91% of GDP in 2011, up from 66% of 

GDP in 2008. High government debt ratios, 

coupled with an assumed rebound in interest rates, 

should lead to a fast increase in interest spending, 

which is already a major force behind the projected 

deficit increase in 2011. 
22. ROMANIA 
Gradual recovery and correction of imbalances under way 
 138 High external and fiscal imbalances increased 
Romania's exposure to the global economic 

downturn The economic boom between 2004 and 2008 has 
led to overheating pressures and unsustainable 

fiscal and external imbala
nces: real GDP growth in 
this period averaged 6.6%; inflation peaked at 

8.4% in Q2-2008; the current account deficit 

reached 12.3% of GDP in 2009; banks and other 

businesses were increasingly reliant on short-term 

external funding; and half of domestic private 

credit was in foreign curre
ncy. Moreover, years of 
procyclical budgetary policy had led to a sizeable 

deterioration in the underlying fiscal position, with 

the structural deficit rising from 2.4% of GDP in 

2005 to 8.5% of GDP in 2008. Market participants 

and economic agents became increasingly 

concerned by these developments. This resulted in 

a significant tightening of capital flows to 

Romania and stress in the banking system. 

Pressures on the exchange rate increased, resulting 

in a more than 30% cumulative depreciation 

between August 2007 and January 2009. Balance-

sheet effects and a sharp decline of export demand 

plunged the economy in a severe recession in late 

2008.  
In these conditions, the authorities decided to seek 
external financial support. The EU, the IMF, the 

World Bank, the EIB and the EBRD responded by 

making available to Romania medium-term 

financial assistance of up to EUR 20bn. This 

assistance is conditional upon the implementation 

of a comprehensive economic policy programme, 

comprising fiscal consolidation and reform 

measures in the area of fiscal governance, 

structural reform and financial sector supervision. 

The adoption of the policy programme has 

contributed to an improvement in market sentiment 

and had a positive impact on the Romanian 

economy. Financial stress eased, pressures on the 

exchange rate declined and strains on the 

government securities market diminished with 

average yields on government bonds declining 

from 14% end-2008 to just above 10% in August 

2009.  
Deeper-than-expected recession in 2009, 
shallow recovery starting in 2010 The tightening of access to
 credit and the decline 
in export demand resulting from the worldwide 

crisis caused the Romanian economy to plunge 

into a severe recession, which has been deeper 

than previously expected. For 2009, growth is 

expected to decline by about 8%, followed by a 

shallow recovery by 2010.  
In the first half of 2009, real GDP contracted by 
7.5% y-o-y. As in many other countries in the 

region, the recession was led by a large drop of 

export volumes, followed by a very sharp 

contraction of domestic demand. The 

unemployment rate has jumped to 6.6% of the 

labour force in August, up from 5.4% one year 

earlier. Although wage and price pressures are 

easing, headline CPI inflation has remained 

relatively high: it stood at 5.0% in September 

reflecting, inter alia, hikes in excise duties and 

increases in the public wage bill.  
A large balance of payments adjustment is under 
way. The current account deficit fell by about ¾ in 

the first half of 2009 compared to the same period 

of 2008. This reflects the sharp contraction of 

import volumes associated
 with the drop in 
domestic demand, which more than offset the 

decline of exports. Devel
opments in the capital and 
financial account have been more favourable than 

projected, with higher ro
llover by corporates and 
stronger FDI inflows more than offsetting a 

slightly lower rollover rate for foreign banks. 

Against this background, pressures on the 

exchange rate have eased.  
In the second half of 2009, first signs of economic 
recovery started to appear, initially driven by 

export demand. The decline in industrial 

production and exports has been moderating and 

m-o-m private credit developments turned positive 

in August after 5 months of negative growth. The 

forecast assumes these trends will consolidate over 
the coming quarters. The recovery of domestic 

demand is expected to follow with some delay 

given still rising unemployment and decelerating 

wage growth. Real GDP growth is expected to turn 

positive by the first quarter of 2010 leading to a 

moderate ½% real GDP growth rate in 2010, 

gradually accelerating to 2½% in 2011. The 
Member States, Romania 
  139 recovery, however, will re
main shallow because of 
a continued need for fiscal adjustment, diminished 

capital inflows, at least in comparison with the pre-

crisis period, and the continued high rate of 

unemployment. 
There are upside risks to this macroeconomic 
outlook. Assuming that global financial markets do 

not go through another round of stress, the 

economy may recover slightly faster than projected 

in this baseline. On the negative side, the current 

political uncertainty could delay the 

implementation of measures aimed at stabilising 

the economy and weaken the recovery in a still 

fragile external environment.

forecas
t The unemployment rate is expected to rise from 
5.8% in 2008 to about 9% in 2009, followed by a 

gradual easing to about 8 ½ % in 2011. Wage 

pressures have diminished considerably in the 

course of 2009 but are 
likely to re-emerge, 
although to a lesser extent, once the economy 

rebounds. The widening output gap, the declining 

domestic demand and the recent stabilisation of the 

RON exchange rate have significantly eased 

inflationary pressures ov
er recent months. Yet, 
core inflation remains relatively high, following 

the increase in excise duties and structural 

rigidities in the labour market, driven among 

others by still significant increases in the public 

wage bill observed in the first 8 months of the 

year. HICP inflation is expected to edge down 

from 7.9% in 2008 to 5.7% in 2009 and entering 

into the Central Bank end-2009 target band of 3.5 

+/-1%. For 2010 and 2011, a further easing to 

3.5% and 3.4%, respectively, is anticipated.  
As the economy returns to a more sustainable 
growth path for a transition country, external 

balances are expected to remain in negative 

territory. As the projected rates of increase in 
imports exceed those in exports, both the trade and 
current account deficits are 
forecasted to go up by 
one quarter of a percentage point between 2009 

and 2011. 
Improving competitiveness would help achieve sustainable growth The external competitiveness of the Romanian 
economy has been eroded by years of high wage 

increases, driven by loos
e income policy in the 
public sector Œ wage agreements in the public 

sector play an important signalling role for private 

sector wages. In addition, growing skill shortages 

have put upward pressure on compensation levels 

in the private sector. In 2005, 2007 and 2008 real 

compensation per head rose at double-digit rates. 

In parallel the export sector had to cope with a 

22% nominal appreciation of the RON between 

2004 and 2007. Even though annual productivity 

growth rates in this period exceeded 5%, 

significant losses in competitiveness were 

unavoidable. The real effective exchange rate of 

the RON (based on unit labour costs in the total 

economy) rose by no less than 72% between 2004 

and 2008.  The measures taken in the framework 

of the balance of payments assistance programme 

to support wage moderation in the public sector 

will therefore help not 
only to reduce budgetary 
deficits but also act, in the medium-term, as a 

stimulus to competitivene
ss. Over the past decade 
Romania has recorded 
significant productivity 
gains. Following the set-back of 2009 it faces the 

challenge to bring back labour productivity growth 

rates to pre-recession levels. 
 Deterioration in public finances The sharper than anticipated
 growth contraction in 
the first half of the year has resulted in a 

significant decline in government revenue. The 

general government deficit is forecast to 

deteriorate from 5.5% of GDP in 2008 to 7.8% of 

GDP in 2009. Yet, achieving this target assumes 

that the government will implement the announced 

measures to freeze the wage bill. Furthermore, the 

target assumes full implementation of the 

announced spending cuts in goods and services 

and in subsidies. Considerable risks remain. In 

particular, the current political turmoil could delay 

the implementation of the announced expenditure 

cuts and could weaken the willingness and 

capacity of the authorities to control the traditional 

end-year surge in 
public spending.

     140 The general government deficit is expected to 
decline only marginally to respectively 6.8% and 

5.9% of GDP in 2010 and 2011. As the 2010 

budget has not yet been adopted, this forecast only 

partially includes the effect of the announced 

additional cuts in goods and services expenditure 

and a freeze in pensions (excluding social 

pensions). Risks to the 2010 budget are mixed: on 

the one hand, the adoption and full implementation 

of the Unified Wage law would contribute to 

reducing the size of the public wage bill (this law 

was designed to gradually reduce the size of the 

public wage bill to 7% of GDP by 2015, but it is 

currently under review by the Constitutional 

Court). Similarly, progress on key structural fiscal 

reforms (pension law and fiscal responsibility 

law), as required in the balance of payments 

programme, would contribute to the fiscal 

consolidation process. On the other hand, the 

current political gridlock may weaken or delay the 

fiscal consolidation and stru
ctural reform efforts.  
The large budget deficits will result in a more than 
doubling of public debt from 13.6% of GDP in 

2008 to 31½ % of GDP in 2011, which however 

remains one of the lowest in the EU.  
 23. SLOVENIA 
Sharp fall in activity followed by subdued recovery 
 141 From buoyant demand to recession In the years preceding the 
crisis, Slovenia enjoyed 
solid economic growth driven by flourishing 

exports and investment. At the same time, 2007 

saw the start of strong inflationary pressures, along 

with a widening external deficit as low real interest 

rates fuelled credit, domestic demand and imports, 

while accelerating wage grow
th started to threaten 
competitiveness. 
Thus, after rapid expansion until the third quarter 
of 2008, the economy was hit hard and rather 

abruptly by the global crisis, chiefly through trade 

in view of Slovenia™s very high degree of 

openness. Export volumes contracted significantly 

for two quarters in a row, losing a cumulative 23% 

in the final quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 

2009, which gave rise to a sharp contraction in 

overall activity, by more than 10%, in the same 

period. The global financial turmoil also led to a 

tightening of financing conditions in Slovenia and 

several measures to strengthen the stability of the 

financial sector were adopted, mainly in the form 

of guarantees. 
Given the low government deficit and debt levels 
at the onset of the crisis, the government aimed to 

contain the impact of the downturn on the 

economy with targeted s
timulus measures, which, 
together with tax relief for companies decided 

before the onset of the crisis, added up to almost 

2% of GDP.  
Broad-based recession followed by an export-
led recovery The very negative growth outcomes in the last 
quarter of 2008 and the first of 2009 imply an 

acute contraction of real 
GDP for 2009 as a whole. 
However, benefitting from stimulus measures 

supporting demand in Slovenia's main trading 

partners, tentative signs of stabilisation in 

economic activity became apparent in the second 

quarter of 2009, when real GDP growth turned 

mildly positive on a quarterly basis. A pick-up led 

by exports, in line with the assumed recovery in 

Slovenia's main export mark
ets, is expected for the 
second half of the year. Overall, for 2009 as a 

whole, real GDP is proj
ected to decline by 7.4%, 
one of the sharpest falls in the euro area. 
The recession has been broad-based across all 
demand components except for government 

consumption, which is projected to continue to 

make a positive contribution to growth in 2009. 

Exports have been hit hard by the collapse of 

foreign demand. However, the massive contraction 

in imports projected for 2009 (in line with falling 

domestic demand and exports) would still imply a 

positive contribution of net exports to growth as 

well as a marked narrowing of the external deficit. 

The drop in exports, exacerbated by low capacity 

utilisation, weaker profitability and tighter 

financing conditions, also triggered a sharp 

contraction in private investment. This includes a 

sharp fall in construction, after the double-digit 

real growth rates recorded in 2007-2008, while 

public investment is not expected to provide any 

support. Over 2009 as a whole, it is projected that 

gross fixed capital formation will drop by around 

one quarter in real terms. The fading away of 

demand has also led to a downward adjustment in 

stock-building by firms.

drop in employment and increasing precautionary 

savings. The assumed positive momentum in the second 
half of 2009 and further gradual recovery in 

Slovenia's main trading partners are projected to 

result in mildly positive real GDP growth in 2010, 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  142 led by exports, and a more robust rebound in 2011. 
Private consumption is projected to post positive 

growth only in 2011, given the lagged impact of 

the recession on the labou
r market and low growth 
in average wages in 2010. Similarly, gross fixed 

capital formation is projected to take some time to 

regain strength. Accordingly, the recovery of 

import growth is set to be more gradual than that 

of exports, entailing a positive contribution of net 

exports to real GDP growth in both 2010 and 2011. 
The abrupt slowdown of the economy after a phase 
marked by emerging overheating risks is bringing 

about some adjustment of the domestic economy. 

The forecast embodies a sharp rise in private sector 

savings, reflecting households' precautionary 

motives and enterprises' 
efforts towards restoring 
their balance sheets, while the government sector 

acts to some extent as a cushion by increasing its 

net borrowing significantly. Meanwhile, the 

projected improvement of
 the external balance 
over the forecast horizon mainly reflects 

favourable terms-of-trade developments in 2009 

and weak domestic demand holding back import 

growth. 
WageŒunemployment nexus affected by 
public wage developments Given the openness of the Slovenian economy, 
maintaining competitiveness by bringing wage 

growth in line with productivity improvements 

would help ensure a healthy recovery. In the 

absence of a private sector wage agreement 

between the social partners beyond 2009, the 

forecast assumes that averag
e real wage growth in 
the private sector will be subdued in 2010 and 

2011 in response to competitive pressures and 

rising unemployment. However, there could be 

some secondary effects from the recent increases 

in public sector wages as part of a move to 

eliminate existing pay differences among the 

various professions in the public sector.  
The downturn has brought the unemployment rate 
up from a low of just abov
e 4% in December 2008 
to 6% in July 2009. A further increase is expected 

in the remainder of 2009. Measures to stem the rise 

in unemployment, in the form of subsidy schemes 

for reduced working hours and workers on forced 

leave, have been the focus of the government™s 

efforts to stem the impact
 of the crisis. As the 
schemes are set to gradually expire in 2010 and 

2011, a certain outflow of employees from these 
schemes into unemployment is assumed to take 
place. After peaking in 2008, inflation is expected to 
decrease sharply in 2009 on the back of lower 

commodity prices and weakening economic 

activity. Still, at around 1%, inflation is expected 

to remain above 
the euro-area average, reflecting, 
inter alia, increases in excise duties throughout the 

year. In 2010 and 2011, inflation is projected to 

increase due to the base effect from 2009, reviving 

economic activity and th
e assumed higher oil 
prices. Marked deterioration in public finances After reaching a balanced
 position in 2007, the 
general government balance is estimated to have 

posted a deficit of 1.8% of GDP in 2008. For 2009, 

the deficit is set to widen significantly, to around 

6¼% of GDP. On the expenditure side, the strong 

dynamics of social transfers, especially pensions 

(given indexation arrangements), and of the public 

sector wage bill together with discretionary 

measures, including measures to respond to the 

crisis, are set to lead to
 a steep increase in the 
expenditure ratio. In addition to the impact of the 

automatic stabilisers, the revenue side is affected 

by various measures providing corporate tax relief 

(phasing-out of the payroll tax, further cut in the 

corporate income tax rate and increase in 

investment-related tax allowances), which are 

expected to be broadly offset by the impact of 

higher excise duties. 
Given the widening deficit, the government is now 
turning its attention to resuming fiscal 

consolidation. In the draft budget for 2010, which 

is incorporated in the forecast, the government 

aims to rein in the widening deficit by limiting 

current expenditure growth in, inter alia, the areas 

of the public sector wage bill and social transfers. 

The forecast also incorp
orates the subsequent 
agreement between the gov
ernment and the trade 
unions on public sector wages over the period 

2010-2011. The forecast pr
ojects a further increase 
of the deficit ratio in 2010 to around 7% of GDP 

and, under the no-policy-change assumption, a 

stabilisation in 2011. 
Having fallen gradually over several years, gross 
government debt stood at 22½% of GDP in 2008. 

It is forecast to increase gradually to around 48% 

of GDP by 2011. The si
zeable increase in the 
primary deficit accounts fo

24. SLOVAKIA 
Resuming real convergence 
following a deep recession 
 144 The crisis and policy response in 2009 With an average real GDP growth rate of over 7% 
during the period 2003-08, Slovakia was one of the 

best-performing EU countries. At the same time, 

overall sound macroeconomic and structural 

policies kept the key macroeconomic balances in 

check. The external position remained strong, 

government finances were kept under control and, 

while a few signs of overheating emerged by mid-

2008, inflation hovered in a range from 2 to 5%. 

These achievements enabled Slovakia to adopt the 

euro in January 2009, which helped to shield the 

country from potential exchange rate pressure and 

supported confidence during the crisis. 
Given its high degree of trade openness, the 
Slovak economy has been particularly exposed to 

the crisis. It has been af
fected primarily through 
the trade channel, as demand from trading partners 

has plummeted, triggering a plunge in exports by 

some 25% in the first half of 2009 compared to the 

same period of 2008. This was followed by an 

even larger fall in imports, as uncertainties related 

to the crisis led to a massive increase of savings by 

both households and the corporate sector. Private 

investment and consumption fell respectively by 

4.6% and 4.8% in the year to the first quarter of 

2009. As a result, real 
GDP slowed markedly in 
late 2008 and tumbled by 11% (non annualised) in 

the first quarter of 2009. Despite the large shock to 

the real sector of the economy and intense stress in 

global financial markets, the Slovak banking sector 

has been relatively resilient, due to the good 

liquidity situation of credit institutions and low 

dependence on cross-border lending. 

Consequently, apart from capital injections in two 

small state-owned banks, no major rescue 

operations have been necessary.  
The policy response of the Slovak government to 
the crisis has aimed to contain the economic 

downturn by supporting domestic demand in order 

to partly offset the slump in external demand. 

Fiscal policy has allowed the full operation of 

automatic stabilisers. The authorities adopted anti-

crisis packages in November 2008 and February 

2009, which amount to r
oughly 0.5% of GDP for 
both 2009 and 2010. But these measures have 

mainly been financed th
rough a reallocation of 
resources within the budget, and therefore do not 

have a negative impact on public accounts. They 
are targeted at specific sectors of the economy 
(car-scrapping scheme) and disadvantaged groups 

(increase in tax credit for low earners), and aim at 

supporting employment (contributions for 

retention of employment) and R&D activities.  
Gradual recovery expected in 2010-11 The Slovak economy is projected to recover 

progressively in 2010 and 2011, against the 

backdrop of a gradua
l pick-up in private 
consumption and investment. After a decline by 

5.8% in 2009, real GDP is
 projected to increase by 
around 1.9% in 2010 and 2.6% in 2011. While 

positive, these figures are much lower than those 

recorded during the boom phase. This reflects the 

influence of several factors playing in various 

directions. On the positive side, recent high-

frequency indicators have provided some signs of 

stabilisation in economic activity. Business 

confidence appears to be 
recovering slowly, while 
exports have stopped falling and the inventories 

cycle is gradually turning 
around. With an increase 
of about 2% in the second quarter of 2009 (non-

annualised), real GDP recorded a technical 

rebound after the sharp fall in the first three 

months of the year, and growth is expected to 

remain in positive territory over the forecast 

horizon.

t However, powerful headwinds are likely to slow 
the recovery. The adjustment of the labour market 

will come with a lag Œ in 2010 employment growth 

is projected to remain negative and unemployment 

is set to approach 13%, one of the highest levels 

among central and eastern European countries. 

This will weigh on real disposable income and 
Member States, Slovakia 
  145 contribute to maintaining the households saving 
rate at a high level, thus explaining the projected 

sluggishness of private consumption in 2010-11. 

Similarly, the underutilisation of production 

capacities and the sharp decline of new orders in 

the automotive and electronics sectors, combined 

with a significant reduction in profits and uncertain 

economic outlook, seem likely to prevent a 

sizeable rebound of invest
ment in the short run, 
following the contraction by 12.4% in 2009. 

Inflation, which has been pushed down 

significantly by the contraction in economic 

activity, is projected to remain low over the 

forecast period. A faster economic recovery would 

be possible if export demand were to prove higher 

than expected and total investment were to benefit 

from ongoing publicŒprivate partnership projects 

for motorway construction and further foreign 

direct investment. By contrast, a larger 

deterioration in consumer confidence, driven by a 

bleak labour market outlook, could weigh on the 

recovery.  Key challenges are to limit the medium-term 
consequences of the crisis on the economy–  Following the large loss of output during the crisis, 
one main challenge will be to ensure that the 

downturn does not durably affect the potential 

growth of the Slovak economy. While subject to 

considerable uncertainties in the current 

circumstances, available estimates suggest that 

Slovak potential growth will be, at least 

temporarily, impacted by the crisis, mainly due to 

a slower accumulation of productive capital. If not 

appropriately managed, the restructuring of the 

automotive sector, curren
tly characterised by 
ample Œ and perhaps in part structural Œ 

overcapacity, could also weigh on growth in the 

coming years. Finally, a further rise in the already 

high structural rate of unemployment cannot be 

excluded. Against this background, it would 
appear to be important to prevent the increase in 

unemployment from having permanent effects and 

to facilitate the transition to new types of economic 

activity.  
–and to preserve competitiveness in the post-
crisis environment Following accession to the 
euro area, Slovakia's 
external imbalances can only be tackled through 

adjustments in domestic pr
ices and costs vis-à-vis 
competitors and through improvements in non-

price competitiveness. Si
nce 2000, Slovakia had 
had one of the fastest appreciating currencies in the 
EU Œ the currency appreciated by more than 40% 

in effective real terms. The appreciation has 

continued during the crisis, mainly reflecting 

nominal exchange rate movements in neighbouring 

countries. Although it is difficult to draw firm 

conclusions on the magnitude of a possible 

deterioration in Slovakia's external price 

competitiveness during the crisis, the evolution of 

relative prices and cost developments and 

developments in non-pri
ce factors are crucial for 
enhancing competitiveness. 
 Rapid deterioration of public finances Several years of expansionary policies during the 
economic boom phase Œ with a deterioration in the 

structural deficit from 1.8% of GDP to 4.7% of 

GDP over the period 2005-08 Œ left Slovakia's 

government finances in a vulnerable position at the 

onset of the crisis. The sharp swing in the output 

gap from very positive to mildly negative territory 

between 2008 and 2009 has unmasked looming 

fiscal imbalances, and the general government 

deficit widened by 4 percentage points of GDP to 

6.3% of GDP in 2009. In line with the European 

Economic Recovery Plan, the government decided 

to let automatic stabilisers operate freely in 2009. 

In view of shallow recovery expectations in 2010, 

the announced consolidati
on efforts are expected to lead to a narrowing of the general government 

deficit, which is projected to decline to 6% of GDP 

in 2010. Government debt is projected to rise from 

28% of GDP in 2008 to about 39% of GDP in 

2010 and, under the no-policy-change assumption, 

to roughly 43% of GDP in 2011.

are even more uncertain, 
implying that fiscal consolidation may not be 

harmful for growth. Reversing current negative 

trends in public finances will however be more 

difficult than in the past. Previous strategies, based 

on the partial allocation of revenue windfalls to 

deficit reduction in the context of exceptional 

economic performance, are not likely to be 

effective given the mixed economic outlook for 

Slovakia in the medium term. 
 25. FINLAND 
Strong external exposure takes its toll on the economy 
 147 From strong growth to rapid contraction After a decade of rapid export-driven growth, 
Finland entered the global crisis in 2008 from a 

relatively strong position, having built up a 

substantial surplus in the current account and 

government finances. Nevertheless, the global 

crisis has had a strong
 impact on the export-
dominated Finnish industry, as well as on the 

domestic sectors through negative confidence 

effects. At the outset, the global crisis had a 

sharply negative impact 
on consumer confidence, 
even though domestic factors implied a solid rise 

in consumer purchasing power in 2008 and 2009. 

In contrast, over the course of 2009, consumer 

confidence has rebounded to
 close to pre-crisis 
levels. However, that rebound and a more 

moderate recovery in industry confidence 

indicators were not yet reflected in actual output 

data for the first half of 
2009. GDP contracted at a 
quarterly rate of about 3% in both the first and 

second quarters of 2009, 
yielding an annualised 
contraction of about 8½% over the first half of 

2009. 
Downturn driven by exports of manufactured 
goods Finnish industry has traditionally had a highly 
concentrated structure, with 70% of exports 

generated by the metal engineering, electronics, 

and forestry sectors. A strong specialisation in 

investment goods allowed Finnish exporters to 

benefit from the global economic boom of the past 

few years (see Graph II.25.1).

forecas
t With the global economic cycle turning to bust, 
demand for investment goods has plummeted and 

is expected to revive only with a lag after global 

growth has gained strength. Over the first half of 

2009, Finnish exports dropped by the most in the 

euro area. Apart fro
m the unfavourable 
composition effect, the sudden appreciation of the 

euro's exchange rate ag
ainst the currencies of 
Finland's main trading partners has had a relatively 

strong impact on external trade, given that almost 

70% of Finnish exports go 
outside the euro area, 
which is the highest share of any euro-area 

country. Additionally, 
the sizeable forestry 
industry appears to be in a long-term process of 

downsizing its production capacity in Finland due 

to global shifts in demand and production towards 

Latin America and Asia. Production volumes in 

the electronics industry have traditionally been 

highly volatile and correlated with global demand 

conditions. Because the import content of exports 

is relatively high and domestic consumption has 

also declined by over 5%, the drop in exports is 

similarly mirrored in imports. Since import prices 

have fallen faster than export prices in 2009, the 

impact on the current account is somewhat less 

severe and a slight surplus position of about 1% of 

GDP is still maintained. 
Policy response concentrated on tax cuts Given the sizeable surplus in public finances 

recorded in 2008, Finland allowed the full 

operation of automatic stabilisers and in addition 

provided for a relatively large fiscal stimulus 

amounting to 1½% of GDP in 2009 and a further 

1% of GDP in 2010.  The fiscal stimulus is heavily 

concentrated on tax cuts (primarily cuts to personal 

income tax), making up about 80% of the stimulus 

packages. The expenditure measures designed to 

boost public investment are therefore relatively 

smaller. In addition, funding for export financing 

was sharply increased, as were other measures 

aimed at reducing financi
ng costs for enterprises. 
Given that households have sharply increased their 

savings in the current uncertain economic 

environment, the effect of the tax stimulus on 

consumption appears to have been relatively 

limited. 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  148 A muted, domestically driven recovery ahead While the rebound in household and industry 
confidence indicators suggests that the economy 

should return to growth already over the second 

half of 2009, the recovery is expected to be 

subdued, with GDP growth below 1% in 2010 and 

about 1½% in 2011. This would be well below the 

average growth rates of the previous decade, but 

broadly in line with the 
euro-area average. Over 
the next growth cycle, ex
ports are expected to be 
less significant as a growth driver than they were 

in the previous decade.
 While external trade 
volumes are forecast to rebound to some extent 

from the present exceptional lows, the contribution 

to growth from external trade is expected to turn 

only slightly positive in 2010-11. A stronger 

contribution to growth is expected to be hindered 

by the current export struct
ure, with the investment 
goods sector recovering
 with a lag and the 
maturing electronics and 
forest industry sectors 
facing longer-term stru
ctural changes due to 
globalisation pressures.  Additionally, due to the 

strength of the euro and the rapid rise of unit 

labour costs over 2008-2009, Finland has sharply 

lost external price competitiveness.  
Domestic demand is expected to play a relatively 
stronger role in the initial years of the next growth 

cycle. The rapid recovery of consumer confidence 

over the course of 2009 is matched by a relatively 

robust rise in real disposable income, growing by 

over 1% annually over the forecast years. 

Precautionary savings and a rise in unemployment 

have so far, however, led to a sharp rise in 

household savings rather than spending. While 

household indebtedness ro
se over the past decade 
to historically high levels by Finnish standards Œ 

about 100% of annual disposable income Œ it is 

still around the euro-area average. Moreover, the 

debt burden on households is mitigated by lower 

interest rates (about 90% of mortgages are on 

variable interest rates) and longer debt maturities 

compared with past decades. Also, the housing 

sector does not appear to be facing a major price 

adjustment. While house prices went through a 

temporary dip at the end of 2008, they have 

already partly rebounded over the first half of 

2009. It is anticipated that an improving economic 

outlook will result in a stabilisation of the 

household saving rate and support a modest rise in 

private consumption by about 1% in 2010 and 

1½% in 2011. Given the inherent lags in 

investment activity, housing investment is 

expected to turn positive only in 2011. The main 

risk to the recovery of domestic consumption is 
projected to stem from unemployment 
developments, which have traditionally played an 

important role in influencing consumer behaviour. 
The Finnish financial sector has remained solid 
and well placed to meet the demand for private and 

corporate credit. Overall,
 corporate balance sheets 
do not face major adjustment needs and would 

appear to be well capitalised for undertaking 

investments. Nevertheless, private investment is 

expected to rebound only in
 2011 after the forecast 
global recovery has firmly taken hold. Government 

stimulus measures on the expenditure side are 

relatively limited and are not expected to uphold 

growth in public investment. Given that about two 

thirds of public investment is made by 

municipalities, which are expected to react to 

financing constraints by cutting investment costs, 

public investment is expected to contract in 2010-

11. 
Wages set to moderate, inflation to remain 
relatively high Following a decade of relative wage moderation, 
the previous wave of wage agreements, settled at 

the peak of the economic 
cycle in autumn 2007, 
provided for exceptionally high wage growth over 

the next 2-3 years. The onset of the crisis has not 

triggered a notable reduction in agreed pay rises. 

Wage growth per employee still reached 4½% in 

the first half of 2009. The following rounds of 

wage settlements are expected to be mainly 

negotiated in early 2010 and are likely to attempt 

to make up for the recent loss of wage 

competitiveness. An early indication comes from 

the wage settlement of the technology industry 

branch, concluded already in autumn 2009, which 

provided for a 0.5% wage rise over the next year, 

not counting the effect of a possible wage drift.  
While inflation remained below the euro area 
average in 2002-08, thereafter it has consistently 

exceeded the benchmark. In
flation is expected to 
remain higher also in 2010, primarily due to the 

rapid rise in unit labour costs being passed on to 

service prices. It appear
s that food and energy 
prices have also come down from their peak levels 

more slowly than on av
erage in the euro area, 
possibly indicating a lack of competitive pressure. 

A cut of VAT on food by 5 pp. from 1 October 

2009 is assumed to reduce inflation by about 0.5 

pp., which is partly offset by a rise in alcohol and 

tobacco excises. A rise of the general VAT rate by 

1 pp. as of July 2010 is estimated to increase

Population ageing starting to impact on the 
labour market The labour market reaction to the crisis has so far 
been more subdued than might have been expected 

from the steep fall in output. About half of the 

decline in employment is explained by lay-offs in 

industry. In addition, temporary lay-offs and 

various schemes to reduce working time, mostly 

not reflected in unemployment statistics, have been 

commonly used, amounting to almost 3% of the 

labour force. In the medium term, the Finnish 

labour market is expected 
to be seriously affected 
by the ageing of the popul
ation, with the working-
age population in stead
y decline from 2010 
onwards. This is expected to tighten the labour 

market over the forecast period and lead to a 

reduction in unemployment at a relatively early 

stage of the economic recovery cycle. 
Sharp budgetary easing exacerbates fiscal 
sustainability challenge  General government finances are set to fall by over 
7 pps. from a surplus of 4.5% of GDP in 2008 to a 

deficit of almost 3% of GDP in 2009. The 

weakening of government balances is largely 
explained by a shortfall in tax revenues, with 
expenditure increases accounting only for a minor 

part. About a half of the tax revenue decline in 

2009 is explained by plummeting corporate 

income tax accrual, which 
is forecast to drop by 
about 44%, representing almost 2% of GDP. The 

tax cuts as part of the fiscal stimulus amount to 

over 1% of GDP in 2009. The deficit is forecast to 

widen further to 4½ % of GDP in 2010, as the 

expected modest recovery of economic activity 

would generate only a minor rise in tax revenue, 

countered by further stimulus measures of about 

1% of GDP and expenditure pressures arising from 

public sector wage rises and social expenditure. 

Based on current policies, including the 2010 

budget proposal, the deficit is projected to edge 

down only slightly in 2011 to below 4½% of GDP, 

which is above the deficit threshold of 3% of GDP 

set out in the Stability and Growth Pact and not in 

line with the government's aim to ensure long-term 

sustainability of public finances. The government 

has not yet announced a fully fledged medium-

term consolidation strategy. Driven largely by 

central government lending, the general 

government debt ratio is expected to shoot up from 

below 34% of GDP in 2008 to just below 53% of 

GDP by 2011. 
26. SWEDEN 
Unemployment and fiscal deficit to peak amid muted recovery 
 150 Recession extends into 2009 As a small open economy with an export structure 
oriented towards investment goods and transport 

equipment, Sweden has been hit relatively hard by 

the global recession. While the headwinds from the 

global slowdown were already discernible in early 

2008, it was not until the final months of the year 

that the full force of the global financial crisis 

impacted the Swedish econ
omy. The fourth quarter 
saw GDP shrink by almost 5% compared with the 

preceding quarter as a result of dwindling exports, 

household belt-tightening and a very rapid draw-

down of stocks. For the year as a whole, GDP 

contracted by 0.2%.  
The downturn has been met by a significant 
loosening of fiscal policy and the central bank has 

lowered interest rates to very low levels. 

Discretionary fiscal meas
ures of about 1½% of 
GDP were enacted in 2009 and further measures 

amounting to around 1% of GDP have been 

announced in the budget for 2010. Fiscal policy 

has been geared towards dampening the negative 

effect of the crisis on
 the labour market and 
providing general support to domestic demand, but 

also towards supporting the long-term goal of 

improving incentives to work. 
A muted recovery from mid-2009 onwards After a weak start to 2009, when falling 

investment and continued subdued exports led to a 

further drop in activity, the Swedish economy 

subsequently stabilised, posting its first quarter of 

positive GDP growth in over a year in the second 

quarter (+0.2% compared to the previous quarter).

t Since spring 2009, a number of indicators point to 
a continued gradual recovery of the Swedish 

economy in the second half of 2009. Partly thanks 

to a swift and powerful policy reaction to the 

financial crisis, the situation in the financial 

markets has gradually normalised in the course of 

2009. Spreads on risky assets have come down 

substantially and companies are now more able to 

tap capital markets once again.  
The improved financing conditions and outlook are 
also reflected by the fact
 that the main Swedish 
stock market index was up by more than 40% in 

mid-October 2009. Survey results indicate that 

business and, in particular, consumer confidence 

have recovered strongly from the very low levels 

recorded earlier in the year. The burgeoning 

optimism of households is also underpinned by the 

apparent resilience of the housing market, where 

prices Œ contrary to what has happened in many 

other countries Œ have started to rise again after 

falling back somewhat in the autumn of 2008.  
The number of redundancy 
notices has dwindled in 
recent months. This could imply that 

unemployment might grow a bit more slowly 

going forward. While not yet evident in actual 

production and trade data, there has also been a 

pick-up, albeit muted, in new orders, including 

export orders, during the summer of 2009, pointing 

to a strengthening of activity in the final months of 

2009. However, given the depth of last winter's 

contraction, it appears that these incipient signs of 

recovery will not be able to prevent the economy 

from recording its largest year-on-year decline 

since the 1940s, with GDP e
xpected to contract by 
about 4½% in 2009. 
The outlook for the rema
inder of the forecast 
period is likely to be characterised by a continued 

subdued recovery in 2010, gradually gaining 

momentum in 2011 on the back of renewed 

demand for Swedish exports from the rest of the 

world and relatively strong household 

consumption growth. Export
s should receive some 
support from a still relatively weak krona. Between 

September 2008 and March 2009, the trade-

weighted exchange rate index rose by about 25%, 

indicating a rapid depreciation. Subsequently, the 

krona has recovered about two thirds of this 

depreciation. Private consumption should be 

underpinned by increases in real disposable 
Member States, Sweden 
  151 income stemming from positive nominal wage 
growth, relatively subdued inflation, low monetary 

policy rates that keep mortgage expenses down, as 

well as tax cuts. In addition, as the labour market 

deterioration comes to a halt, the household 

savings rate should start to fall.  
Given the large drop in output, capacity utilisation 
is low and investment is therefore likely to lag 

behind somewhat initially but should ultimately 

recover towards the end of the forecast period. 

Overall, annual GDP growth should reach about 

1½% in 2010 and 2% in 2011. 
It cannot be excluded th
at the Swedish economy 
may grow more quickly than foreseen in the main 

scenario, given the current upsurge in consumer 

confidence. The household saving rate is at a 

historically high level, which creates room for 

increased consumption. 
The wealth effect from 
rising house prices and stock market indices could 

prove stronger than expected, in particular since 

survey data indicate that households expect house 

prices to continue to rise over the coming year.  
Inflation to remain below target Consumer price inflation reached a high in the 

autumn of 2008, but has subsequently fallen 

significantly, as energy prices have reversed their 

previous strong upward movement. Given the 

weak demand, price pressures are likely to be 

subdued during th
e forecast period, despite fairly 
loose financial conditions. Annual HICP inflation 

is expected to fall below 2% in 2009, where it is 

forecast to stay for the remainder of the forecast 

period. 
Inflation is likely to be partly determined by 
domestic cost pressures. In this regard, the 

outcome of the upcoming negotiations between the 

social partners on a new set of collective 

agreements covering about 3 million wage earners, 

i.e. the bulk of the 
labour force, could be 
important. The negotiations are likely to prove 

more difficult than usual given the wide difference 

in expectations between
 employers and unions 
regarding the available room for wage increases. 

The economic downturn and the ensuing sharp rise 

in unemployment are nevertheless expected to 

contain wage pressures over the forecast period. 

Negative wage drift and a general cutback in over-

time compensation have already lowered the pace 

of nominal wage increases. This, combined with 
an expected upswing in productivity growth in 
2010, should benefit corporate profitability. 
Financial vulnerabilities remain Swedish banks are consider
ed relatively solid and 
should be able to cope wi
th expected credit losses, 
which stem mostly from the exposure of some big 

banks to the Baltic States. Unexpectedly large 

losses that are not matched by further 

recapitalisation efforts could, however, hamper the 
lending capacity of the banking system. 
An additional medium-term vulnerability is the 
ongoing rise in household indebtedness, which 

looks set to reach 160% of disposable income in 

2009 and is likely to continue rising in 2010. After 

a slight slowdown in its rate of expansion in 2008, 

household borrowing has acc
elerated again, rising 
at an annual pace of more than 8% per month in 

the summer of 2009. This
 process is to a large 
extent driven by the currently exceptionally low 

interest rates and household optimism regarding 

house prices (household borrowing mainly takes 

the form of mortgages). Once interest rates 

normalise, an increased debt service burden could 

weigh on household consumption in the medium 

term Œ in particular so if house price inflation 

should fall short of expectations. Swedish house 

prices are currently rising at one of the fastest rates 

in the EU. 
Avoiding hysteresis in the labour market a key 
policy challenge Since the onset of the crisis, the situation in the 
Swedish labour market has deteriorated 

significantly, with unemployment rising from an 

average level of 6.2% in 2008 to 8.3% in 

September 2009. So far, the bulk of the job-cutting 

has taken place in the manufacturing industry, with 

the public sector and the services sector proving 

more resilient. While the number of redundancy 

notices has fallen back sign
ificantly since the peak 
levels of last autumn, they are still relatively high. 

As the economy is expected
 to continue to grow 
fairly slowly in the near term and taking into 

account the new cohorts ente
ring the labour force 
without finding jobs, unemployment looks set to 

continue to rise for yet some time. It should 

increase to an average leve
l of 8.6% in 2009 before 
peaking at slightly above 10% in 2010.  
Once the recovery gets under way, job growth is 
likely to be fairly subdued, partly because

    152 companies have hoarded labour to a larger extent 
than usual. Up to 100 000 workers may already be 

covered by exceptional crisis agreements at local 

level stipulating shorter working hours and lower 

pay. This provides a pool of underemployed 

workers that can be tapped once production 

expands.  
A key challenge will be to avoid that a relatively 
job-anaemic recovery lead
s to hysteresis in the 
labour market with permanent loss of labour 

supply. This will also be important in order to 

ensure a continued and sufficient improvement in 

the fiscal position as GDP growth gains 

momentum. Ensuring that active labour market 

policies remain of high quality even as they 

expand in scope will be important in this regard. 
Fiscal deficit on the rise until 2010 Due to a combination of cyclical effects, reflecting 

a high tax elasticity, and discretionary fiscal 

measures (in the form of various fiscal packages 

totalling about 1½% of GDP in 2009), public 

finances are expected to swing from a surplus of 

2.5% of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of slightly above 

2% of GDP in 2009. Further stimulus measures 

introduced with the 2010 Budget Bill combined 

with an expected further 
rise in unemployment in 
2010 are likely to widen the deficit to 3¼% of 
GDP in 2010. While unemployment is expected to 
remain high in 2011, stronger GDP growth should 

contribute to bringing the deficit down to the 2½-

2¾% of GDP range in 2011. 
The return to deficits, combined with negative or 
slow nominal GDP growth, is likely to reverse the 

previous trend towards a lower government debt 

ratio. The government has also put further 

privatisations on hold at least until after the general 

elections in the autumn of 2010. The gross public 

debt ratio is forecast to
 rise from about 38% of 
GDP in 2008 to 44% of GDP in 2011. Significant 

guarantee schemes for the banking sector remain 

in place, which imply potentially large contingent 

liabilities. 
 27. THE UNITED KINGDOM 
Path to recovery complicate
d by remaining imbalances 
 153 Abrupt end to decade of growth and stability   The UK entered its deepest post-war recession in 
the second half of 2008, 
after a decade of strong 
and continuous expansion, falling unemployment 

and steep rises in asset prices. As in many other 

countries, the recession undid much of the output, 

employment and financial gains built up in 

previous years: GDP at the end of the second 

quarter 2009 stood at the level of late 2005, while 

the unemployment rate surged by 2.5 pps. to 

around 8% in the year to mid-2009. In addition, a 

number of imbalances had been mounting in the 

UK economy over the last decade - notably in the 

housing market and public finances - that 

compounded the impact.  
Policy intervention since the onset of the crisis has 
aimed at stemming systemic failure and restoring 

financial stability through a range of operations to 

improve banks' liquidity and solvency, as well as 

increasing the flow of cred
it to the private sector 
and supporting domestic demand through radical 

monetary easing and fiscal policy measures. Partly 

in response to the change in the monetary stance, 

which as well as historically low interest rates 

included the exceptional use of quantitative easing 

mainly through the purchases of UK government 

bonds, the exchange rate weakened substantially. 

While the success of some of these measures 

intended to support broad money growth and 

spending cannot yet be adequately gauged, 

financial market conditions are gradually returning 

to normality, although credit growth remains low.  
Exiting recession with weak domestic demand 
and some support from the external sector Following the sharpest quarterly loss of GDP in 
over fifty years in the first quarter of 2009, the 

speed of contraction moderated in the following 

quarter.
(89)
 Positive growth is expected in the 
second half of the year
, though this reflects a 
number of temporary factors, such as high 

government spending, a rebound in the inventories 

cycle and the re-increase of the VAT rate in 2010. 

Notwithstanding this positive development, GDP 

in 2009 as a whole is expected to contract by 4½%,

t Throughout the recession, falling domestic demand 
has dominated the overall picture, as fixed 

investment fell by around 17% between the first 

quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009, 

and private consumption contracted by close to 4% 

over the same period. Looking ahead, domestic 

demand is not expected to improve in 2010, 

although it is likely to do so in 2011, albeit 

modestly. 
The outlook for private consumption, which 
accounts for around 60% of
 domestic demand, is 
marked by weak househo
ld income throughout 
most of the forecast period, as additional expected 

falls in employment in 2009 and 2010 depress 

labour income and impact on consumer confidence 

and spending intentions. This will be compounded 

by weaker earnings growth, as inflation moderates 

and rising unemployment keeps wage pressures in 

check. On the other hand, higher transfer payments 

to households will temper the labour market's 

negative impact on gross disposable income in 

2010, as was already the 
case throughout 2008 and 
the first half of 2009. As
 employment is expected 
to begin to rise in 2011 and earnings growth to 

recover somewhat, disposab
le income would then 
rise again in both nominal and real terms. 
Household spending growth will be tempered by a 
number of factors over the forecast period, notably 

households' desire to increase savings in response 

to a higher risk of unem
ployment and the sizeable 
falls in households' net wealth brought about by 

sharp asset price falls since the onset of the crisis. 

Households may also wish to provide for future 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  154 interest rate rises that would increase their debt 
servicing costs appreciably, following sharp 

increases in household indebtedness in the last ten 

years. Furthermore, those intending to buy 

residential property are now faced with a 

significantly higher deposit requirement, while 

households with negative housing equity intending 

to move home are also 
likely to increase their 
saving. Overall, this supports an outlook for 

consumption that involves a fall in 2009 and a 

bottoming-out in 2010 before rising moderately in 

2011. As a result, the household saving rate is 

expected to rise over th
e forecast horizon, reaching 
levels last seen at the beginning of the decade.

forecast
 Fixed investment was more affected by the crisis 
than other demand components, not least due to its 

greater dependence on credit financing and its link 

to both expected and actual capacity utilisation. 

The latter fell sharply during the crisis as 

production cuts reduced the stock of active capital, 

which in turn reduced the amount of gross 

investment required to offset depreciation of active 

capital. The outlook for investment spending 

shows little improvement as weak demand growth 

limits the need for net new capacity: fixed 

investment stabilises in early 2010, but grows at 

low rates thereafter, esp
ecially for machinery and 
equipment. Investment in housing, which was 

badly affected by the fall in mortgage lending 

during the crisis, is assumed to perform slightly 

better on account of improved credit conditions.  
Changes in inventories throughout the recession 
were comparatively large and showed sizeable 

variation over time, as stockbuilding turned 

sharply negative in the final quarter of 2008, 

particularly in the retail and motor trade industries. 

The rate of destocking slowed after the first quarter 

2009 and is expected to continue doing so until the 
second half of 2010, when replenishment of 
depleted stock levels is expected to start. Overall, 

inventories are likely to 
subtract 1¼ pps. from 
GDP growth in 2009, but will add ¾ pp. and ½ pp. 

respectively in 2010 and 2011. 
Government consumption expenditure continued 
growing throughout the recession, although at 

relatively modest levels, thereby providing only a 

minor stimulus to domestic demand in the first half 

of 2009, although transfer payments to households 

and lower tax receipts supported disposable 

income growth. Current budget plans imply that 

government spending growth should pick up 

throughout the remainder of the financial year 

2009/10, before fiscal plans for the following 

financial year dictate reductions in expenditure that 

will dampen domestic demand.  
Net external demand for goods and services, by 
contrast, recorded a positive contribution to output 

growth in 2008 and the first half of 2009, driven 

by import falls that outstripped the reduction in 

exports, which benefitted from the weaker pound. 

The supporting effect from net foreign demand is 

likely to peak in 2009, but will continue over the 

forecast horizon, by around ½ pp. in each year.  
Unemployment still rising Developments on the labour market throughout the 

crisis have reflected the severity of the output 

contraction in falling employment and rising 

unemployment levels, particularly for full-time 

employment. The unemployment rate in the 

second quarter of 2009 reached 7.9%, from 5.3% 

one year earlier. Employers' employment 

intentions in the third quarter continue to signal 

further employment losses, albeit at a lower rate, 

and the number of vacancies remains historically 

low, suggesting further unemployment rises in the 

near term. Given the UK's relatively flexible 

labour market, the lag between output losses and 

employment response should be short, so that the 

unemployment rate is expected to peak in the 

second quarter of 2010. The rate of net job creation 

thereafter is expected be moderate, in line with 

expectations for a relatively muted recovery in 

domestic demand. 
Deleveraging and banking sector uncertainties These projections are clouded with considerable 

risks and uncertainties. The prospects for a return 

to strong and sustainable growth will depend in 
Member States, The United Kingdom 
  155 part on when and how imbalances in the 
government and household sectors are unwound.. 

An important trade-off in this respect will be the 

rebalancing speed, which will determine the extent 

to which adjustment in the household and 

government sector takes a toll on economy-wide 

expenditure in the short term. However, an 

excessively protracted adju
stment could be at the 
expense of domestic and external confidence, and 

might thereby fail to strengthen resilience to future 

shocks. Furthermore, the expected recovery in 

domestic demand is heavily contingent on credit 

demand rising and on credit provision being 

improved on price and quantity terms. The extent 

to which loan default rates rise from their current 

level will be one important determinant of the 

latter, together with future developments in 

wholesale funding conditions and the potentially 

large further losses by UK banks.

% Housing market stabilisation not yet solidified The previously buoyant UK residential property 
market succumbed to its own exuberance in late 

2007, with the impact of the financial crisis 

compounding the effects. Following a tripling of 

average house prices betw
een 1997 and late 2007, 
these fell thereafter by 20
% up to early 2009, with 
moderate price growth resuming thereafter. The 

number of transactions slumped, and in the third 

quarter of 2009 remained well below average. 

Available evidence points towards the recent price 

recovery being in large part due to a shortage of 

properties for sale. As pri
ce rises are expected to 
attract more sellers and forced sales rise with 

unemployment, supply pressures should ease, thus 

dampening price growth in
 the near term. Housing 
demand is expected to remain depressed, as labour 

market conditions will affect disposable income.  
Inflation surprisingly sticky, to ease further  Despite the large rise in economy-wide spare 

productive capacity and oil prices having halved 

compared to their previous year's level, annual 

HICP inflation moderated only gradually 

throughout 2009 to 1.1% in September. This was 

driven to a large extent by the sharp nominal 

effective depreciation of sterling compared to the 

previous year (-10%, Q3 
average). In view of the 
weakness of economic activity relative to 

potential, disinflationary pressures should continue 

to bear down on infla
tion throughout the forecast 
period, although in January 2010 the reversal of 

the 2.5 pps. VAT reduction is likely to lift inflation 

temporarily. Average earnings growth slowed 

noticeably through
out 2009 to ar
ound 2%, and 
should continue to slow further in 2010.  
Competitiveness gain through depreciation  As markets' perception of risks in the UK financial 

sector turned increasingl
y pessimistic throughout 
the crisis, sterling depreciated substantially. This is 

expected to help rebalance the economy and 

generate a positive growth contribution from net 

external trade th
roughout the forecast period. The 
merchandise trade deficit has widened since the 

late 1990s, only partly financed by a rising surplus 

in services trade and in
vestment income.  An 
improvement in the trade ba
lance is likely over the 
forecast horizon, driven by 
a recovery in exports of 
goods and services in 20
10 as world trade activity 
resumes following its partly trade-finance-induced 

collapse in early 2009. The UK is in a good 

position to consolidate its strong services trade 

surplus in the medium term, and could further 

capitalise on its science and technology base by 

raising skill levels and private R&D spending. 

Imports are  expected to
 lag the expected export 
recovery, as domestic demand stays weak and 

higher import prices gradually lead to a 

substitution for domestically produced output.  
Extraordinary deterioration in public finances The public finances are e
xpected to remain in a 
very weak position throu
ghout the forecast period. 
The high level of the structural government deficit 

before the outbreak of the present economic crisis 

limited the government's capacity to pursue a 

looser fiscal stance without compromising 

budgetary sustainability. The recent financial 
sector rescue operations have helped to shore up 

the banking sector, but have also generated large 

new contingent liabilities. The government deficit

     156 in 2009/10 is estimated to increase to over 13% of 
GDP from 6.9% in the preceding financial year 

(running from April to March). Three-fifths of the 

forecast deterioration in 2009/10 is due to a drop in 

the revenue ratio that is largely a result of two 

interconnected factors: firs
t, the sharp contraction 
in economic activity; and secondly, the additional 

losses in tax revenue from two hitherto major 

sources: the financial sector and the housing 

market. The expenditure ratio is also forecast to 

rise sharply, primarily reflecting the planned 

increase in non-cyclical 
primary and investment 
expenditure, higher social security expenditure and 

the front-loading of expenditure from 2010/11.

 The stimulus measures of around 1½% of GDP 
that were announced by the government for 

2009/10 are estimated to account for a quarter of 

the increase in the deficit ratio in that year. The 

reversal of those stimulus measures should 

contribute to an improvement in the primary 

balance in 2010/11, though the reduction in the 

total deficit will be more modest as a result of a 

surge in debt servicing costs. In 2011/12, fiscal 
consolidation is set to accel
erate, driven by a sharp 
deceleration in planned di
scretionary expenditure, 
especially through lower investment spending, and 

an increase in social security contribution rates. A 

temporary fiscal operating rule has been devised to 

apply after the end of the crisis, but it will impose 

only a relatively weak constraint in terms of 

minimum fiscal effort (0.5 pp. of GDP p.a.). 
The decline in the share of domestic demand in 
economic activity will depress revenue growth in 

2011/12 and beyond. Revenue from corporate 

taxation, which accounted for a quarter of the tax 

revenue increase during the five years to 2007/08, 

and income tax will be also affected by financial 

sector weakness. On the expenditure side, the 

spending plans announced in the 2009 Budget 

imply a freeze in real 
government expenditure 
from 2011/12 to 2013/14, compared to an annual 

increase of 4¼% between 1999/00 and 2010/11. 

These spending targets, however, are not yet 

backed by published departmental spending plans.  
The UK's debt ratio in 2009/10 is estimated to

high primary deficit and, to a lesser extent, by 

debt-increasing financial sector interventions and a  

denominator effect from lower GDP. In 2011/12 

the debt ratio, at around 90% of GDP, is set to 

overtake that of the European Union as a whole. 
 Candidate Countries   28. CROATIA 
Mild recovery after strong contraction 
 158 The economy decelerated markedly in the first 
half of the year– Over the last few years, Croatia enjoyed relatively 
strong economic growth, averaging 4.3% in 2004-

08. The growth performance was primarily 

domestic-demand-driven, fuelled by large capital 

inflows and strong credit growth. This was 

accompanied by a marked expansion of non-

tradable industries, such as retail, construction and 

the financial sector.  The global financial crisis and 

economic slowdown in Croatia's main trading 

partners started to affect the Croatian economy in 

the last quarter of 2008, when domestic demand 

and trade flows declined abruptly. In the first half 

of 2009, Croatia went into
 a deep recession. Real 
GDP growth declined mark
edly Œ by 6.5% year-
on-year compared to 2.4% in 2008. The 

contraction in output was mainly driven by a 

considerable drop in domestic demand. Private 

consumption fell by around 9.7% and real 

investment dropped by 12.6%. Only government 

consumption maintained positive growth of close 

to 2.6%, as spending was not reduced in line with 

falling revenues. All in all, domestic demand 

posted a negative contribution to GDP growth of 

12.3 pp. At the same time, total exports declined 

by 17% year-on-year, though less strongly than 

total imports (-22.8%), resulting in a positive 

contribution by net exports to GDP growth of 

5.8 pp.  
–but the downturn is expected to be less 
pronounced in the remainder of 2009– Recently published high frequency indicators 
suggest a further contractio
n of the economy in the 
third quarter. Industrial 
production and retail trade 
recorded strong declines in
 the two months of July 
and August of 8.7% and 14% year-on-year 

respectively. However, there are some signs that the pace of 
economic downturn has somewhat moderated 

recently. In particular, revenues from tourism came 

out better than expected and seasonally adjusted 

production data point to a marginal positive 

growth in the second compar
ed to the first quarter. 
A slowly improving external environment is 

expected to lead to a moderation of export losses 

towards the end of the year. External financing 

constraints have somewhat eased, and the 
deceleration of credit growth
 is set to stop in the 
second half of 2009. Therefore, a continuation of a 

very modest recovery on a quarterly basis is to be 

expected in the third and fourth quarter. This will 

however not be sufficient to avoid a significant 

decline in real GDP for the year as whole. The 

forecast projects a fall in GDP of close to 

6% year-on-year. –followed by a zero growth rate in 2010 and 
continued mild recovery in 2011  The outlook for 2010 remains rather uncertain. It is 
still to be seen whether recent improvements in the 

external environment w
ill translate into a 
strengthening of external demand. External 

financing constraints have eased somewhat in the 

course of the year, as ev
idenced by an increase in 
the external liabilities of domestic banks. 

However, a higher risk awareness among potential 

investors and the huge debt amortisation 

obligations weighing on both the private and 

general government sectors 
are likely to constrain 
financing for new investment. Domestic 

confidence levels and disposable incomes may not 

recover quickly, as the unemployment rate is set to 

increase and the number of employed to fall. 

Credit growth has decelerated significantly during 

the crisis, due to both demand and supply factors. 

Lower demand for loans as well as tighter 

financing constraints and higher risk awareness by 

banks have led to a slowdown in bank lending, 

particularly to private households. Although the 

banking sector is well-capitalised, sound and 

profitable, credit activity to the private sector will 

only slowly accelerate. Moreover, important public 

sector borrowing requirements limit the 

availability of credit to the private sector. 

Therefore, relatively low growth of private sector 

borrowing, in combination with higher interest 

rates, is expected to continue to put a brake on 

economic activity, particularly over the first part of 

the forecast horizon. Public consumption and 

investment are unlikely to 
accelerate in view of the 
fiscal constraints and huge refinancing needs of the 

public sector. On this ba
sis, the forecast projects 
that the Croatian economy is likely to stagnate in 

real terms in 2010 on a year-on-year basis.  Upside 

risks are mainly related to a faster-than-projected 

economic recovery in the EU as well as to the clear 

prospect of Croatia's accession in the near future 

which may provide additional impetus to the 
Candidate Countries, Croatia 
  159 economy, through stronger net FDI flows, inter 
alia. For 2011, the for
ecast projects a small 
positive growth of around 2%, mainly based on a 

slight acceleration of pr
ivate consumption and 
investment growth, while net exports continue to 

contribute negatively to output growth.

forecas
t External deficits are likely to fall temporarily As a result of the financial crisis, the high external 
deficits of the past years have undergone severe 

adjustments. Reduced capital inflows and a 

contraction of domestic demand have led to a 

sharp reduction of trade and current account 

deficits. In the first half of 2009, the current 

account deficit dec
lined by around 
40% year-on-year. In terms of GDP, it fell from 

9.3% in 2008 to 6% annualised in June. As to the 

outlook, total exports are expected to fall less 

strongly in the second half of 2009, and to slightly 

increase in 2010, in lin
e with an expected 
strengthening of foreign demand in key trading 

partner countries. Total imports are likely to 

continue to contract at 
a stronger pace than exports 
through 2009, and will pick up only slowly 

thereafter. In light of expected trade flows and on 

the assumption that external financing constraints 

may somewhat persist, the current account balance 

is projected to fall to around 6% of GDP in 2009 

and to slightly widen to around 7¼% on average 

over the forecast period, ma
inly due to an expected 
increase in commodity prices.  
Inflation pressures to remain low Annual inflation has fallen markedly from its peak 

of 8.4% in July 2008, as a result of rapidly 

contracting domestic demand and lower 

commodity prices. Inflationary pressures are 

expected to remain low ov
er the forecast horizon. 
Domestic demand is set to only slowly and 
gradually recover. Cost push pressures are 
expected to remain limited as the growth of unit 

labour costs will slow down. Upside risks are 

related both to foreign and domestic factors. On 

the external front, somewhat higher prices for 

imported raw material are likely to have some 

effect on the domestic pr
ice level. Moreover, some 
mild inflationary pressures will result from the 

recent increase of VAT (by 1pp.) and excises as 

well as further adjustments of administrative 

prices, which will be nece
ssary in the context of 
EU accession. At the same time, it is reasonable to 

assume that a stability-oriented monetary policy 

framework will help to prevent a significant re-

acceleration of inflation 
over the medium term.  
Labour market performance to suffer 
eventually Wage developments have so far been moderate 
and remained in line with productivity growth. The 

government made an attempt to reverse earlier 

public sector wage increases which should 

contribute to limiting wage pressures in 2009 and 

2010. In addition, the economic slowdown means 

that only moderate increases in labour costs in the 

private sector are expected.   
As elsewhere, slowing growth and investment 
dynamics will have an impact on labour market 

developments with some delay. In 2009, 

employment is set to fall and the unemployment 

rate (labour force survey) 
to increase. The slight 
recovery of economic activity forecast for 2010 

and 2011 is expected to somewhat ease the 

pressures on the labour market, but not yet to 

support a significant reduction of unemployment.  
Fiscal deficit is widening significantly despite 
re-balancing measures  Fiscal policy was strongly 
affected by the crisis 
from late 2008, when revenues started to 

underperform markedly in line with declining 

economic activity. While some short-term 

adjustments were made in late 2008 to keep the 

deficit in line with the envisaged target, public 

finances came under increasing pressure in 2009.  

In the first half, state budget revenues declined by 

8.6% year-on-year while 
total spending increased 
by 7.9%. The budget balance turned into a deficit, 

equivalent to 2.2% of projected GDP, compared to 

a small surplus in the same period a year ago. A 

bleaker-than-expected economic outlook and 

worsening fiscal trends forced the authorities to

budget revision in July. 
The re-balancing efforts 
foresaw some spending 
cuts, but were mostly 
concentrated on measures to compensate for 

falling revenues. This included, among other 

things, a special tax on income, a VAT increase of 

1 pp., and increases in excises. Despite those 

adjustments, the planned fiscal deficit increased to 

3.3% of GDP, compared 
to an original budget 
target of 1.4% of GDP. There remain downside 

risks to the 2009 budget execution: if the economic 

downturn persists for longer than expected, 

government revenues would be reduced further. 

Also, pressures for more government activism 

could result in higher-than-projected spending to 

combat the recession.  
The forecast projects the fi
scal deficit to increase 
to around 3½%-4% of GDP in 2009. A mild 

economic recovery and stronger revenue 

performance are expected to support a reduction of 

the deficit to around 3% in 2010. The general 

government debt-to-GDP ratio is set to increase 

from 33.3% to around 39½% of GDP.  
Overall, public finances in Croatia are expected to 
remain under pressure as downside risks are 

evident on both the revenue and spending side of 

the budget. Therefore, a key challenge will be to 

design and implement a credible medium-term 
fiscal strategy aimed at reducing budget rigidities 
and enhancing the efficiency and quality of public 

spending. Such a strategy would need to be 

supported by a continuation and acceleration of 

economic restructuring on a broader front as well 

as by deeper reforms of the social benefit system.  
 29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV
 REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA Workers' remittances support stability 
 161 Output decline accelerated during first half 
year   The global financial crisis increasingly affected 
economic activity from the last quarter of 2008 

onwards. Investment dropped markedly end of 

2008 in response to declining export prospects and 

increased uncertainty. 
Private consumption 
dropped in the second quarter, reflecting growing 

uncertainty among households about the near-term 

future and increasing lay-offs in the manufacturing 

industry. However, the output decline has 

remained rather moderate so far, partly thanks to a 

resilient banking sector but also due to significant 

government spending at the end of 2008, turning 

an accumulated fiscal surp
lus of 2% of GDP into 
the envisaged end-year deficit of 1% of GDP.  
In response to the financial crisis, the government 
announced two anti-crisis packages, one in 

December 2008, claiming a volume of some 5% of 

GDP and another in March in the form of an 

extended investment programme, envisaging an 

increase of public investment from some 3% of 

GDP in the past to 7% of GDP in 2009. However, 

the actual impact of bo
th packages on public 
revenue and expenditure so far has been very 

limited, leaving the end-year spending boom as the 

main fiscal stimulus. These substantial income 

transfers and public purchases probably supported 

domestic demand in the first quarter of 2009, but at 

the same time kept external imbalances rather 

high. In view of declining capital inflows, the 

financing of these imports created pressure on the 

country's foreign reserves.  
Consumer price inflation further decelerated 
during 2009, from some 4%
 in December 2008 to 
slightly negative rates since mid-2009. The main 

driving factors for the decline in inflation are lower 

prices for food, energy and transport.   
The labour market situation worsened towards the 
end of 2008, when the slowdown in economic 

activity was accompanied by a deceleration in 

employment growth. Furthermore, many of the 

newly created jobs were low income jobs in the 

agricultural sector or were related to public 

construction activities. Unemployment dropped 

slightly, but still remained at the alarmingly high 

level of some 34% of the labour force. Youth 

unemployment stayed at some 54%.

is expected to decline 
by about 2% in 2009, due to shrinking exports, 

lower investment and a drop in private 

consumption. In 2010, the negative impulse from 

the global crisis is exp
ected to subside, which 
should allow the economy to expand by around 

1½%. The main sources for this recovery will be 

private and public consumption, while exports are 

likely to remain sluggish. In 2011, economic 

activity is expected to 
increase by some 2½%, 
benefiting from the recovery of the country's 

export markets.  
Given the uncertainties related to the global 
economy, domestic demand, and in particular real 

disposable income will be key factors for the 

country's growth dynamics. Overall, real 

disposable income is expected to remain rather 

stable, benefiting from relatively low inflation and 

the stabilising impact of workers' remittances on 

household income.  
In recent years, workers' remittances and other 
private capital inflows had 
increased to up to 19% 
of GDP. During the forecast period, those inflows 

are expected to return to their previous levels of 

some 15% of GDP, reflecting the more difficult 

labour market situation in the host countries. 

Nevertheless, this source of income is expected to

     162 remain at a very significant level. As long as 
international prices for energy and raw materials 

remain moderate, inflation probably will be low 

during the forecasting period. This should support 

the real income of households. 
Labour income is likely to shrink in 2009, 
resulting from declining employment and low 

wage growth. During r
ecent years, employment 
growth has been rather high at some 3% annually. 

However, many of the newly created jobs were in 

sectors with low productivity, such as agriculture. 

In view of the likely still difficult international 

environment in 2010 and 2011, the country's 

potential for creating additional jobs or raising real 

wages will remain limited. Improving the country's 

labour income thus is closely linked to improving 

productivity by modernising and deepening the 

capital stock.   
As a result of subdued domestic activity, the 
current account deficit is likely to decline in 2009, 

but to remain relatively high. Increasing domestic 

demand in 2010 and 2011 will keep the external 

imbalances at a high level. 
Public finances are likely to deteriorate  Weaker domestic activity and low inflation imply 

a significant drop in public revenues. At the same 
time, a high share of non-discretionary spending is 
likely to keep public expenditure high. So far 

crisis-related spending, such as the need to 

recapitalise troubled banks,
 has remained rather 
limited.

 As a result, the forecast expects an only moderate 
increase in the deficit, assuming that revenue 

shortfalls will be partly compensated by lowering 

spending for capital investment. Accelerating 

economic activity in 2010 and 2011 will help to 

lower the deficit towards 3% of GDP. However, 

public debt is likely to increase, reaching some 

30% of GDP by 2011.  
30. TURKEY 
Drawn-out recovery after deep recession 
 163 Economic activity slumps in 2008 After an outstanding growth performance during 
2002-06, the Turkish economy started to 

decelerate already 
in 2007. Domestic factors, such 
as increased political uncertainty, a slowdown of 

reforms and tight monetary policy following the 

currency crisis in mid-2006, took a heavy toll on 

the growth dynamics.   
In 2008 the econo
mic crisis hit Turkey mainly via 
the trade and financial channels. In the last quarter 

of the year real GDP cont
racted by 6½% in annual 
terms, as exports and investment declined by 8½% 

and 17% respectively. Global demand shrank 
fast in sectors such as 
automotive and white goods, 
where Turkey had previously built a solid 

manufacturing basis for the European market. 

Simultaneously, lower private external inflows and 

decelerating domestic credit led to a 5
% annual decline in private consumption. The combined 

trade and financial shock disrupted activity in the 

manufacturing sector causing a 12
% decline of 
industrial output in the last quarter of 2008. 

Overall, real GDP growth slowed to below 1% 

while investment growth already turned negative 

by -5% in 2008.  
Previous structural reforms, in the banking sector 
in particular, had put Turkey on a sturdy footing. It 

was therefore rather resilient to the global turmoil 

and avoided a full-fledged financial crisis. The 

authorities could also afford to significantly loosen 

both the monetary and fiscal stance in response to 

the crisis. This helped cushion the downturn and in 

particular the decline in private consumption. The 

fiscal stimulus, planned at around 5% of GDP 

during 2008-10, was focused and prioritised after 

the local elections in Marc
h 2009, when significant 
consumption tax incentives and an investment 

scheme were introduced. Private sector confidence 

would have benefitted from clearer fiscal plans 

however, including a timely release of the 

Medium-Term Economic Programme. 
Deep contraction in 2009 followed by gradual 
recovery The recession hit its trough in the first quarter of 
2009 when real GDP collapsed by 14
% year-on-
year. The decline in 
private consumption, 
investment and exports were all in the double-digit 
range. The anti-crisis measures introduced by the 
government,  in particular the consumption tax 

cuts, helped limit the decline in private 

consumption to -1¼% year
-on-year in the second 
quarter of 2009. Indeed, seasonally adjusted real 

GDP even increased by 
around 7% quarter-on-
quarter in the second quarter of the year. But 

investments and exports improved only marginally 

compared to their disappointing performance in the 

first quarter, suggesting 
that the pace of the 
recovery would slow down once the effects of the 

fiscal stimulus fade away. Overall, economic 

output is expected to decline by 5¾% in real terms 

in 2009.  
With regard to the GDP components, private 
consumption is expected to drop sharply by almost 

5% even though it is cushioned by the government 

fiscal incentives. The decline in total domestic 

demand would be somewhat alleviated by the 

3¼% growth in public consumption. Among the 

domestic demand components, investment is 

forecast to experience the sharpest decline in 

excess of 20%. A substantial destocking as 

companies try to adjust to lower sales is also 

expected to contribute negatively to growth, 

cutting about 1¼ pps. off the real GDP growth 

rate. The unfavourable ex
ternal environment is 
expected to lead to a double-digit decline in 

exports, which represents a significant drag on 

economic activity in 2009.

t The feedback loop from the underperforming real 
economy to the financial sector is likely to remain 

subdued given the still moderate increase in non-

performing loans. Having been reshuffled after the 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  164 2001 crisis, the banking sector is now well 
capitalised and its exposure to currency and 

maturity mismatches remains limited. Nonetheless, 

loan growth has decelerated
 markedly in the crisis 
due to external financing constraints, lower 

economic activity and tighten
ed lending standards. 
This has negatively affected domestic demand in 

2009 and is likely to slow the recovery of private 

consumption and investment also over the forecast 

horizon. Moreover, the notable increase in public 

sector borrowing requirements would further limit 

the availability of credit for the private sector. 
The recovery of investment in equipment is likely 
to be hampered by the low capacity utilisation rate, 

which is still about 10 pps. below the 2007 average 

level. As the external demand is also projected to 

pick up only slowly and the fiscal expansion to be 

gradually reined in, the recovery is likely to be less 

robust than in previous boom-bust cycles. 

Therefore, real GDP growth
 is expected to return 
to positive territory, 2¾% in 2010 and 3
% in 2011, but to remain below potential growth over 

the forecast horizon. Un
like in 2009, domestic 
demand and stock-building are likely to make a 

positive contribution to growth, but the 

contribution of net exports will turn negative 

again. Graph II.30.2:

 Lower external imbalances The positive terms-of-trade shock caused by the 
decline in oil and commodity prices together with 

the depressed domestic demand are leading to a 

major contraction of the trade and current account 

deficits in 2009. In the first eight months of the 

year, the current account deficit declined by more 

than 80% year-on-year. It 
is projected to shrink 
from around 5
% of GDP in 2008 to about 2% of 
GDP in 2009. Over the 
forecast horizon, it is 
expected to grow moderately to around 3
% of GDP in 2011, as foreign capital inflows recover.  
Exports of goods and services will return to 
positive, but relatively slow annual growth of 

about 2% in 2010 and 4% in 2011. This is in line 

with an expected strengthening of external demand 

and benefits from the 2008 base effect. Helped by 

the recovery of domestic demand, imports are 

projected to pick up faster than exports, leading to 

wider external imbalances. At the same time, the 

high level of unaccounted inflows in foreign 

currency, which made up for the shortfall in 

official capital inflows since October 2008 are 

unlikely to continue at the same pace going 

forward.  
The welcome adjustment of external imbalances 
together with the relatively smooth access to 

external financing relieved the pressure on the 

exchange rate. The continuation of FDI inflows in 

the crisis, albeit at a 
lower pace, may provide 
additional impetus to the recovery. 
Inflation to meet targets during 2009-11 In 2009, the disinflation process has been 

supported by the depressed aggregate demand and 

the decline in energy prices which outweighed 

inflationary pressures st
emming from the central 
bank's substantial interest rate cuts. The end-of-

period inflation is expected to recede substantially 

below the central bank's target of 7½%. 

Inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued 

over the forecast horizon. Given the slow and 

gradual recovery of domestic demand the 2010 and 

2011 targets of 6½% and 5½% respectively are 

also expected to be
 met. The elevated 
unemployment rate is expected to help lower unit 

labour costs in real terms, thus facilitating the 

structural adjustment process. 
Unemployment shoots up  The situation on the labour market worsened 

already in 2008, when the unemployment rate 

started to pick up, in particular in the last quarter 

of the year. The 2009 recessi
on is likely to lead to 
the unemployment rate surging by almost 4% pps. 

Although employment is ex
pected to grow over 
the rest of the forecast 
horizon, the unemployment 
rate will continue to rise towards 14% in 2010 and 

recede only modestly in 
2011. The annual inflows 
into the labour force are large at around 2% 

annually given Turkey's young population.

     165 Consequently, the relatively slow recovery 
foreseen during 2010-11 is unlikely to bring the 

unemployment rate down rapidly.  
Protracted fiscal adjustment after the crisis In 2009, the fiscal stance was loosened 

significantly in response to the crisis and before 

the local elections. While revenues remained 

almost flat compared to 2008, public expenditures 

accelerated at a double-digit 
rate and in particular 
for current transfers. The authorities expect the 

central budget deficit Œ on a cash basis Œ to widen 

by almost 5% pps. to 6
% of GDP in 2009. 
Therefore, the general government balance is 

likely to reach almost 8% 
of GDP in 2009 in ESA 
95 terms. 
As a corollary, public debt is expected to surge to 
about 47% of GDP from 39½% of GDP in 2008. 
The announcement of the Medium-Term 

Economic Programme - although delayed by 

several months - removed some of the uncertainty 

regarding the fiscal path. Pending further 

elaboration of the progr
amme's measures to 
support the achievement of the fiscal targets, the 

budget deficit is expected
 to decline more slowly 
than foreseen in the pr
ogramme and reach around 
6¾% of GDP in 2010 and 5¾% of GDP in 2011. 

This would not be enough to ensure the planned 
stabilisation of the public debt-to-GDP ratio over 
the programme period. As a result, the public debt-

to-GDP ratio will continue 
to rise over the forecast 
horizon to 51% of GDP in 2011. 
  Other non-EU Countries   31. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
Strong headwinds will slow down recovery 
 168 The recession which started at the end of 2007 has 
been the deepest and longest in the United States 

for more than sixty years. It has taken a heavy toll 

in terms of employment and output loss. Current 

data indicate that output contraction ended last 

summer and that the economy is stabilising 

although unemployment continues to rise. The 

financial system has improved, but remains fragile. 

The headwinds facing the 
economy are formidable 
and are likely to make the recovery relatively 

sluggish and prone to se
tbacks over the forecast 
period. 
Exit from the Great Recession The National Bureau of Economic Research, the 

quasi-official arbiter of th
e US business cycle, has 
determined that the recession started in December 

2007.  The downturn was moderate at first, partly 

because the stimulus pack
age from February 2008 
supported domestic demand temporarily. When the 

financial crisis worsened in connection with the 

failure of Lehman Brothers, economic activity 

started to contract sharpl
y. According to current 
data, real GDP declined by 3.8% from the second 

quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009.  
Currently, a wide array of data is suggesting that 
the recession ended in the summer months 

although this will not be confirmed for some time. 

Data on industrial production and the purchasing 

managers' index indicate that manufacturing is 

expanding again. The PMI for the non-

manufacturing sector has also risen above the 

50%-mark in September. Capital spending shows 

signs of stabilisation after the free fall of last 

winter. Export volumes have started to increase 

again. The housing sector seems to have bottomed 

out with home sales and housing starts rising from 

very low levels. House prices have stopped 

declining and may even be rising again, according 

to some national measures. Consumer spending 

has increased in the third quarter, helped by 

government incentives for car purchasing. Overall, 

economic activity seems to
 be expanding at an 
above-trend pace in the 
second half of 2009. 
Certainly employment, always a lagging indicator 

of the business cycle, has continued to fall, but at a 

much reduced speed compared to the worst months 

of the recession last winter. 
Drivers of the recovery One of the main drivers of domestic demand at the 

current juncture is the fiscal stimulus contained in 

the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009
 which was adopted in February. According to 
the Congressional Budget 
Office, the Recovery 
Act will increase the federal deficit by $787 billion 

over the next ten years, predominantly in the first 

three years. The expected sequence of measures 

means that the fiscal stimulus amounts to 2.0% of 

GDP in 2009, 2.3% in 2010 and 0.7% in 2011.  

About one quarter of the stimulus consists of tax 

cuts. Most of the rest is devoted to infrastructure 

projects, but it also includ
es assistance to state and 
local governments, an extension of unemployment 

insurance benefits, and additional funding for other 

social programmes. Most of the $150 billion of 

expenses in the first six months have been for 

individual tax cuts, state fiscal relief, and transfers 

to those most directly hurt by the recession.  
Plausible estimates of th
e macroeconomic impact 
of the Recovery Act suggest that annualised real 

GDP growth has been lifted by about 2 pps. in the 

second quarter and by 3 pps. in the third quarter. 

The effect on GDP growth will decline gradually 

in subsequent quarters and turn negative in the 

second half of 2010. In addition to February's 

stimulus package, consumer spending and GDP 

growth received temporar
y support in the third 
quarter from the $3 billion spent under the 

government incentive pr
ogramme for new car 
purchases ("cash for clunkers").  
A second important driver of the economy in the 
near term is the inventory cycle. In the first half of 

2009 business inventories were reduced at a very 

fast rate, which deepened the recession 

significantly. Stocks have now been brought into 

much better alignment with sales, particularly in 

the automotive industry. Although inventories 

overall are still declining, this now seems to 

happen at a slower rate which already provides a 

positive contribution to GDP growth. As the 

inventory cycle progresses and enters the 

restocking phase, the positive growth contribution 

will continue. It is expected that the effect will be 

very strong until next spring and then flatten out. 
The dollar's recent depreciation will also 
strengthen the recovery over time (based on the 
Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America 
  169 assumption of constant exchange rates). In real 
effective terms the dollar's exchange value has 

fallen by 8% between March and September 2009, 

thereby reversing the appreciation over the 

preceding six month period and benefitting the 

international competitiveness of US goods and 

services. Once import-intensive restocking has 

petered out and trade flows have normalised, net 

exports are expected to make a positive 

contribution to GDP growth.  
In addition, the recovery will be supported by a 
continuation of an extremely accommodative 

monetary policy and the recent improvement in 

financial market conditions. The Federal Reserve 

already lowered the policy interest rate to close to 

zero at the end of last y
ear and continues to state 
that "economic conditions are likely to warrant 

exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate 

for an extended period". There has been an 

impressive rise in equity values since March and a 

material decline in private sector borrowing rates

forecast
 Headwinds The fiscal stimulus and the inventory cycle will 
only boost growth temporarily. The key question 

for the recovery is therefore whether it will have 

become self-sustained wh
en the temporary factors 
subside. A cyclical upturn has an inherent 

dynamism which will usually ensure this. 

However, the US economy is currently 

encumbered by a number of weaknesses which 

will tend to mitigate the recovery.  
(1) The drop in house and equity prices has 
reduced the net worth of US household by close to 

17% between the beginning of the recession and 

mid-2009. This is bound to result in a large 

negative wealth effect. Households will cut back 

on consumption as they try to rebuild their wealth 
by saving out of income to compensate for the fall 
in the value of their assets.  The net saving rate 

(measured as personal saving as a percentage of 

personal disposable income) has already doubled 

from 2% in the pre-recession period to around 4% 

between May 2008 and August 2009. A further 

significant rise is likely since wealth effects 

usually operate with a time lag.  
(2) Although the fiscal stimulus is going to add to 
GDP growth until the middle of next year, the 

effect has probably already peaked. Unless 

additional stimulus is injected into the economy or 

other demand-boosting factors will take over from 

the Recovery Act, the payback in terms of reduced 

growth numbers will become clear in the course of 

2010. In addition, the budgets of states and local 

governments are facing large revenue shortfalls 

which need to be addressed with tax increases or 

spending cuts under existing constitutional 

requirements. Federal transf
ers appropriated in the 
Recovery Act will only finance part of the growing 

budget deficits. This means that the sub-federal 

public sector will exert a drag on the recovery over 

the forecast period.  
(3) The labour market has continued to weaken in 
recent months although the 
rest of the economy is 
stabilising. Employment has declined throughout 

the third quarter while unemployment has 

approached the 10% mark. Even a more concurrent 

indicator like first-time claims for unemployment 

benefits has remained in recessionary territory and 

hourly earnings are clos
e to stagnation. The 
implication is that income growth will continue to 

suffer and consumer spending with it. The 

experience of "jobless recoveries" after the two 

preceding recessions seems to be repeated. The 

dismal state of the labour 
market is also reflected 
in consumer confidence. Although it is up from the 

record-low early this year
, it remains close to a 
level which represented the lows during previous 

recessions. (4) The economy's spare capacity in the form of 
unemployed workers, idle manufacturing capacity 

and vacant homes are at or
 close to record-high 
levels. The Congressional Budget Office estimates 

that output will be about 7% below its potential in 

2009. The existing slack in resource utilisation is 

likely to restrain private fixed investment 

throughout the fo
recast period.  
(5) Although financial conditions have improved 
recently, credit availability 
for households is likely

   170 to remain more restricted than before the financial 
crisis. Mortgage lending has clearly returned to 

stricter lending standards. 
New issues of subprime 
mortgages have practically disappeared and non-

conforming loans are on
ly made with large 
premiums. Consumer credit is contracting, partly 

reflecting stricter lending practices. At least as 

long as unemployment is rising and, thereby, 

default risk, credit availability is unlikely to 

improve. This will be an additional restraint on 

consumer spending going forward.  
A subdued recovery with a second dip in 2010 The balance and sequence of driving forces and 

headwinds suggests a growth profile with an 

above-trend expansion of around 3% during three 

quarters starting in mid-2009. But when the fiscal 

stimulus and the inventory cycle lose most of their 

power next spring, the economy is likely to fall 

into a state of low growth in which the inherent 

dynamics of the recovery are largely offset by the 

restraints listed above. Only in 2011 the economy 

should be able to return gradually to growth close 

to its long-run potential. But this will be far from 

sufficient to close the output gap by the end of the 

forecasting period. It would result in annual 

average growth of 2.2% in 2010 and 2.0% in 2011. 

This would represent a very subdued performance 
by historical standards and in view of the depth of 
the preceding recession.  
In this scenario, the unemployment rate will rise to 
10% next year and slightly higher in 2011. The 

large slack in resource utilisation should keep 

headline inflation low over
 the forecasting period. 
The household saving rate will rise by 4½ pps. 

from 2008 to 2011. Over the same period, the 

fiscal deficit of general government will more than 

double to 13% of GDP. The current account deficit 

is narrowing significantly from 4.9% of GDP last 

year to 2.9% in 2009. But this improvement is not 

expected to last. In 2010 and 2011 the current 

account deficit should wi
den again to around 3
% of GDP although export growth is projected to be 

higher than import growth, particularly in 2011. 
The risks associated w
ith this forecast are 
considerable, but appear to be balanced. Regarding 

GDP growth, the risks relate mainly to the 

uncertainties about the magnitude of the rise in the 

household saving rate. 
32. JAPAN 
Huge economic challenges
 for the new government 
 171 More than one 'lost decade'? Following the bursting of asset bubbles in 1989-90 
Japan had been going through a period of very low 

annual GDP growth, the 
so-called 'lost decade.' 
The lack of reduction in 
existing overcapacities in 
industry and banking and the slow resolution of 

problems in the banking sector led to a period of 

anaemic growth coupled with deflationary 

developments. This drove Japan into a recession in 

1998, when the unfortunat
e timing of the rise in 
the sales tax coincided with the outbreak of the 

Asian financial crisis. To each crisis, the LDP-led 

government reacted with huge fiscal stimulus plans 

focused on construction projects. In a highly 

developed country like Japan, this not only led to 

'cathedrals in the desert', but also induced a fast 

rise in the country's debt burden, bringing the gross 

debt-to-GDP ratio to the highest among G7 

countries. The economy took another hit when the 

global IT bubble burst in 2001.  
Japan's experience in tackling this long crisis 
period is noteworthy. Economic developments 

only turned better, when in the same year the 

newly appointed government started to implement 

some overdue structural reforms. The problems 

related to non-performing loans of the banking 

sector were resolved through the injection of 

considerable b
udgetary means into the banks' 
capital (however, this did not change the chronic 

inefficiency of most of Japan's banking sector). 

Furthermore, the successive governments in the 

years 2001 to 2006 implemented strong cuts in the 

construction budget(s) and the country's pension 

system, which succeeded in bringing to a halt the 

fast rise in the debt ratio. Structural labour market 

reforms were enacted, which led to a rapid 

increase in the share of 
non-regular employment in 
overall employment. The favourable global 

developments and a Yen weakened by carry-trades 

supported an export-driven recovery, which for the 

first time since 1990 led to considerable recovery 

in land prices in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka, 

underlining the rising regional discrepancies in 

economic development. In the final phase, 

deflation was overcome and nominal GDP was 

finally clearly higher than in 1990. Private 

consumption also started to perform well, driven 

not least by a considerable decline in the country's 

saving rate.  
Following the Prime Minister's resignation in 
2006, however, the reform process stalled, leaving 

Japan relatively unprepared for the current Great 

Recession, in spite of the low exposure of the 

country's banks to toxic assets.  
The downturn was precipitous In spite of this low exposure and of the rising 

importance of other Asian markets for Japanese 

exports - China's share 
in Japanese exports 
(19.1%) is now clearly higher than the US share 

(15.8%) or the EU one (11.4%) - Japan was hit 

early by developments in the US. Following the 

rising problems of the financial sector in the US, 

carry-trades reversed as Japanese investors 

repatriated funds into Japan's safe heaven. As a 

consequence, the Yen appr
eciated strongly, rising 
from an average monthly rate of Yen 122.7 to the 

US dollar in June 2007 to Yen 112.5 in December 

2007, and Yen 106.7 in September 2008. On a 

relative effective basis, the negative impact of 

exchange rate developments was worsened by the 

fact that in July 2008 China de facto re-pegged its 

currency to the US dollar and that neighbouring 

countries like Korea saw their currency decline 

strongly against the US dollar.

 Following the failure of Lehman Brothers in 
September last year, the already ongoing decline in 

Japan's growth accelerated clearly and a second-

wave of Yen repatriation started, driving the Yen 

up to Yen 91 per US dollar in December 2008 and 

Yen 88.3 at the point of writing. This time, the 

Yen also appreciated stro
ngly against the euro, 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  172 rising from an average of 
Yen 153 to the euro in 
September 2008 to Yen 123 in December last year. 
With exports down by 13.6% in the fourth quarter 
of last year (in volume and seasonally-adjusted 

terms), and by 22.5% in the first quarter - while 

imports proved more resilient - GDP declined by 

3.5% q-o-q in the fourth quarter of 2008 and by 

another 3.1% in the first quarter of 2009. 

Supported by the government's stimulus package, 

in the second quarter both public investment and 

private consumption contributed positively to the 

quarterly growth rate of 0.6% as did net exports.  
Trade as a whole, however, continues to 
underperform. Exports in August were still down 

by 37.1% on the year (in value terms), following a 

decline by 37.6% in July and imports in August 

declined by 42.8% (following a drop by 41.2% in 

July and by 43.8% in June). In the first seven 

months of this year, th
e current account surplus 
has declined further, due to the ongoing decline in 

income from abroad.  
Given the strong appreciation of the Yen and the 
rising (negative) output gap, it does not surprise 

that the growth of consumer
 prices has also turned 
negative again. In August, the core index (i.e. 

excluding volatile fresh food prices) was down by 

2.2% on the year, th
e sharpest drop since 
comparable data was first recorded in 1971.  As 

growth is expected to remain weak in the short-

term and on the basis of our exchange-rate 

assumptions, it seems likely that deflationary 

developments will continue for some time and that 

the 2010 inflation rate will still be negative.

 Subdued growth in the short-term   The short-term outlook for the Japanese economy 
has improved compared to the quarterly 

projections of the spring 
forecast. With public 
investment in particular and final demand as a 

whole expected to be higher than assumed in 

spring, growth in the second half of the current 

year is likely to be higher
 than forecast in spring. 
Industrial production in the third quarter has 

increased regularly and the short-term outlook for 

industrial production for October remains positive, 

with METI (Ministry for Economy, Trade and 

Industry) forecasting a rise by 2.2% on the month. 

Furthermore, the Tankan, the most accurate 

leading indicator for the Japanese economy has 

also continued to improve in September, rising 

from minus 48 in the June survey to minus 33 

among large manufacturers and from minus 29 in 

June to minus 24 in September among large non-

manufacturers. Nevertheless, given the worse-

than-projected performan
ce in preceding quarters, 
the expected GDP growth rate for the current year 

as a whole has deteriorated from  -5.3% in spring 

to -5.9% now. 
Regarding the year 2010, the improved outlook for 
the second half of this year also implies a slightly 

higher positive overhang into next year. Combined 

with the improved outlook for the US, this induces 

a higher growth in the order of 1% compared to a 

forecast of 0.1% in spring.  
Risks to the forecast are 
relatively balanced. On 
the one hand, private consumption could perform 

worse than anticipated, as unemployment is at 

record levels and nominal wages are falling. On 

the other hand, growth in China, in particular in 

2010, could turn out even
 higher than forecast, 
implying a better Japanese export performance 

than currently anticipated. Furthermore, the 

technical assumption of this forecast, i.e. a stable 

nominal exchange-rate of the Yen could turn out to 

be relatively 'pessimistic' for exports.  
The outlook both for 2010 and 2011, however, is 
particularly uncertain, given the first clear election 

victory by an opposition party against the LDP 

since the LDP's foundation in 1955 on 30 August 

2009. In its election manifesto, the victorious 

Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has inter alia 

announced higher spending on child allowances 

and education to be financed by the elimination of 

waste and the ending of "unnecessary and non-

urgent projects", e.g. in infrastructure. In line with 

this announcement, the

Japan's new Prime Minister on 16 September, has 

stopped many projects contained in this fiscal 

year's supplementary budgets (FY 2009). 

Furthermore, on 29 September, the government 

has asked for fresh requests from ministries and 

agencies for the budget 
for the FY 2010 (starting 
on 1 April 2010) until 15 October to "redraft the 

state budget from scratch".  
While the new government's insistence on 
changing Japan's growth model from business and 

export-orientation towards private demand ("put 

people's life first") is encouraging for consumption 

in coming quarters and welcome globally, it 

remains to be seen whether this policy orientation 

will be able to withstand the huge challenges the 

country is facing, especially
 the fast ageing and the 
demographic decline. Overall, given the 

information that we have at this stage, a dynamic 

rebound of the Japanese economy appears 

unlikely. 
 33. CHINA 
Will China's growth model change? 
 174 An economic success story– Following the start of economic liberalisation in 
1978, the average growth ra
te in China has reached 
10% per year, multiplying by close to the factor 

'10' the GDP per capita in only thirty years. Since 

the second wave of reforms initiated by DENG 

Xiaoping in 1992, China's growth model relied 

ever more on the urban, 
coastal, export-oriented 
provinces which were expe
cted to pull the central 
and western provinces with them. Profound 

structural reforms were initiated in parallel, which 

allowed the country to embark on a strong growth 

path. 
During the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, 
China's favourable fiscal situation allowed the 

country to launch a first stimulus package aimed at 

improving infrastructure. In parallel, China for the 

first time acted as an anchor for regional economic 

stability by refusing to devalue its currency against 

the US dollar.  
From 2001 onwards, the export-oriented growth 
model allowed the country to profit fully from the 

general acceleration in globalisation. With the 

Chinese currency continuing to be pegged to the 

US dollar at a competitive rate and exports 

growing by double digit rates, China started to 

accumulated exchange reserves to a degree never 

observed before. The suspension of the peg in July 

2005 and the ensuing gradual appreciation against 

the US dollar did not change this trend, and 

provided the country with a valuable buffer during 

the current crisis.  
–not lastingly damaged by the Great 
Recession With a GDP growth rate of 13% in 2007 Œ 
compared to the official target of 8% - economic 

policy was aimed at avoiding overheating and 

keeping inflation at bay. This restrictive policy was 

successful as it succeeded in
 reducing the growth 
rate in 2008 to 9% only.  
The focus of economic policy only changed in 
summer 2008, when the RMB was again pegged to 

the US dollar at an exch
ange-rate of (around) 
RMB 6.83 to the US dollar and monetary policy 

stopped being restrictive.  
Following the failure of Lehman Brothers on 15 
September, the official line changed rapidly to 

'fiscal stimulus and relatively loose monetary 

policy'. A vast fiscal stimulus programme for the 

years 2009 and 2010 Œ corresponding to around 

15% of 2008 GDP Œ was announced in November 

2008; its rapid implementation allowed China's 

economy to recover strongl
y after the trough in 
growth reached in the first quarter of 2009, when 

the GDP growth rate declined to 6.1% y-o-y, 

driven by a strong dec
line in exports (down by 
23.5% in value terms in the first half of 2009 

compared to the same period in 2008).

t  As the decline in exports was to a considerable 
degree due to the collapse of processing trade, the 

overall impact on value added in manufacturing 

has remained limited, but the effects on 

employment were considerable, with an estimated 

20 million migrant workers (out of a total estimate 

of at least 150 million) losing their jobs and 

finding themselves withou
t any social security 
support. As a consequence, the unemployment 

rate, estimated at 9% in September 2008 by the 

Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, is very 

likely to have reached a d
ouble digit figure early 
this year. With many of these unemployed migrant 

workers returning to their rural homes to celebrate 

Chinese New Year, the Ch
inese authorities reacted fast by promoting private consumption in 

particular in the countryside.  
At the same time monetary policy turned decidedly 
expansionary, mostly through 'informal' 

instruments such as 'administrative guidance' to 

banks. As a consequence, in the first half of 2009 

the supply of broad money M2 increased by 28.5% 
Other non-EU Countries, China 
  175 on the year and new loans were up by RMB 7.4 
trillion to RMB 37.7 billion. This monetary 

loosening combined with the fiscal stimulus 

programme led to a strong rise in fixed asset 

investments, which rose by more than 33% on the 

year in the first six months of 2009. Industrial 

production, which had 'only' risen by 5.1% in the 

first quarter accelerated to 
a growth rate of 9.1% in 
the second quarter (and 10.7% in June), 

confirming the early and strong recovery of the 

Chinese economy.

t Favourable short-term outlook– Not surprisingly under these circumstances, GDP 
growth accelerated to 8.
9% on the year in the 
second quarter, already high
er than the official 8% 
growth target. Given the strong rise in loans, an 

improving external environment and the statistical 

base effect (due to a very weak fourth quarter 

2008), the annual growth ra
te is likely to accelerate 
further in the last quarter of this year, bringing the 

overall growth rate for 2009 to more than 8.5%.  
Developments in 2010 are likely to remain 
favourable, as the fiscal stimulus will be 

maintained and the external environment is 

expected to improve furt
her. The likely tightening 
of monetary policy and the announced reduction in 

overcapacities in some sectors like steel, however, 

should lead to slightly lower growth rates in the 

second half of 2010. With growth in the US 

forecast to accelerate agai
n in 2011, 
the running out of the domestic stimul
us package should be at 
least partly compensated for by a more favourable 

external environment, no
t least due to a clear 
recovery in processing trade. However, because of 

overall strong domestic demand, import growth 

should be higher than the growth rate of exports 

both in 2010 and 2011.  
All in all, GDP growth in 2010 and 2011 is 
forecast to reach 9.6% and 9.5% respectively, still 

implying a relative underp
erformance compared to 
the average rate observed since 1978. However, 

demand by China should give a bottom to global 

prices of raw materials including petrol. 
The growth rate of consumer prices, which is 
likely to be slightly negative in the current year, is 

expected to turn positive in 2010 and rise further in 

2011.  
Data on general government finance is not easily 
available, but on current trends is appears likely 

that the general government deficit will be only 

somewhat higher than the of
ficial target of 3% of 
GDP, in spite of the considerable volume of the 

fiscal stimulus package.  
China's GDP valued at market exchange rates is 
likely to be the second highest in the world as early 

as next year and China's contribution to world 

growth will continue to be the single most 

important one, far ahead of any other country or 

region. 
–but how about medium to long-term 
imbalances? The focus of the stimulus package on 
infrastructure investment, welcome as it may be in 

the short term, not least to mitigate the impact of 

the slowdown on unemployment, has however 

contributed to increase the existing domestic 

imbalances of the Chin
ese economy. Even with 
real consumption likely to grow by more than 8% 

in the current year, the ex
tremely high growth rate 
of fixed asset investment implies that the already 

low share of private consumption in overall GDP 

will decline further. In addition, the fiscal stimulus 

package has allowed some sectors like steel to 

maintain capacities, which might turn out to be 

idle if external demand does not return to the 

growth rates observed in the pre-crisis years.  
While the Chinese authorities have announced 
their intention to cut down on potential 

overcapacities in these sectors, it remains unclear 

if and when they will implement this 

announcement. Furthermore, the expansionary 

monetary policy is likely to lead to a considerable 

misallocation of resources, which would not only 

fuel the growth of non-performing loans in the 

banking sector, but might even create new 

overcapacities.

   176 One of the counterparts of
 this domestic imbalance 
is the external imbalance.
 While the huge current 
account surplus, 11% of GDP 
in 2007, is likely to 
continue to decline, as was already observed in 

2008, it will remain sizeab
le in absolute terms 
(around USD 350 billion in both 2010 and 2011), 

the decline in terms of GDP being primarily due to 

the ongoing strong rise in China's nominal GDP 

figure.  
Reducing both domestic and external imbalances 
appears to be the crucial challenge facing the 

Chinese economy in the medium to longer term. 

Under current policies, China risks to see its 

monetary policy having less and less traction, as 

speculative capital inflows are likely to rise again, 

obliging the central bank to intervene via the 

compulsory purchases of bonds by Chinese banks, 

which impacts negatively on bank profitability. 

The assumption of no-policy-change behind this 

forecast also assumes that 
the Chinese renminbi de 
facto remains pegged to the US dollar throughout 

the forecast horizon. 
34. EFTA 
Different paths towards recovery 
 177 While all EFTA countries have been severely hit 
by the crisis in their path to recovery, challenges 

vary by country. Norway enjoys the relatively 

comfortable position related to its substantial oil-

income, which allows a strong fiscal stimulus to 

reboot the economy. Switzerland is struggling with 

a banking sector under pressure following the 

eroding bank secrecy and feels the threat of 

deflation this year. The 
outlook for 
the forecast 
years, shows a return to moderate growth in 

Switzerland1, and Norway. Iceland faces a severe 
recession. Iceland's GDP is forecast to grow 

significant in 2010 and 2011 but much depends on 

the successful implementation of the IMF 

programme. Also, Icelan
d's application for EU 
membership on July this year may help raise 

confidence. 
 Growth depends largely on fiscal spending in 
Norway Norway has been hit hard by the global economic 
downturn. The export sector has been severely 

affected, and domestic demand, mainly 

investment, has been contracting rapidly. 
Domestic demand is shrinking through all its 
components, apart from government spending, and 

also external trade is
 contributing to the 
contraction. Real GDP for 2009 is forecast to 

contract by 2.2% to only return to slight growth by 

the end of 2010. This grow
th is expected to be 
mostly driven by domestic demand, particularly 

government spending. The challenge for Norway 

will be to keep growth momentum, even when the 

fiscal stimulus fades away. 
The decline in investment in Norwegian mainland 
industries that started earlie
r this year is expected 
to continue into 2010. Afterwards investment in 

the mainland industries (offshore excluded) is 

expected to increase in 2011 however without 

reaching the record high 2
008 level. Investments in petroleum are expected to fall somewhat from the 

first half of this year, but on an annual basis will 

increase slightly this year to remain stable in 2010.  
The fiscal policy has been 
expansionary this year, 
with estimated growth in public consumption and 

investments of 5.2% and 12% respectively. The 

policy is expected to be far less expansive in 2010. 
The stance of the fiscal po
licy in 2011 is expected 
to be relatively neutral.  
Household consumption, responsible for around 
55% of the GDP in mainland Norway, is likely to 

increase significantly in 
the second part of the 
forecast period. Low interest rates, increased 

incomes, increased wealth and better prospects all 

contributed to increased household consumption in 

the second quarter of 2009, after being in decline 

for a year.  While for 2009
 consumer spending is 
expected to decrease sligh
tly, in 2010 and 2011 a 
rebound to growth is expected in house hold 

consumption. 
Housing prices fell during the second half of 2008, 
but have subsequently increased since. However, 

no further increase is expected for the rest of 2009 

though housing prices are 
expected to continue to 
increase in 2010 and 2011
. The improvement in 
the housing market is e
xpected to contribute to 
increased investments in housing, thus turning the 

decline of the past two years into an upswing next 

year. Graph II.34.1:

 Whilst unemployment is the main challenge The Norwegian government budget for 2010 top 
priority aims to secure jobs and Norway is among 

the countries in Europe with the lowest 

unemployment. However, unemployment in 

Norway is expected to be relatively high in the 

forecast years, from 4.8% 
of the total work force 
this year to 5.0% in 2010 and 2011.   
The current slump in the Norwegian economy is 
partly responsible for the clear fall in wage growth. 

Wage growth will be slowing further in the 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2009 
  178 forecast period. Consumer inflation is expected to 
fall, with an annual average in 2009 of 1.9%. A 

strong Norwegian Krona is expected to contribute 

to inflation falling below 1% next year. 
Switzerland, exports are key Switzerland's economy slipped into its worst 

recession in over three decades in mid-2008 as the 

global economic slump hit its exporters hard. The 

economy is expected to sh
rink by 2.4% this year, 
to stagnate in 2010, to finally rebound slightly only 

in 2011 with GDP growth of 0.6%. 
In the first quarter of 2009 exports, key economic 
factor for Switzerland, 
declined by 14 % and 
imports were down by 11%. However, 

Switzerland's deep recessi
on unexpectedly slightly 
eased in the second quarter driven by an increase 

in private and public spending, while a drop in 

imports outstripped the decline in export. The 

biggest challenge ahead fo
r Switzerland might well 
be the drop in real growth in exports of goods and 

services. Export growth is expected to decelerate 

significantly in the for
ecast years with a serious 
downside risk to the service sector in relation to 

the eroding bank secrecy, which may have a 

serious impact on the contribution of the financial 

sector to GDP. Overall external trade should 

continue to provide a positive, and growing, net 

contribution in the forecast years. 
With saving rates on the increase and consumer 
confidence being low household consumption is 

dropping in 2009 and 2010. However, in 2011 it is 

likely to return to growth. Growth in public 

investment is expected to be modest in the forecast 

years despite increased government spending on 

infrastructure. Weak export demand for Swiss 

machinery and equipment will cause little extra 

incentive for Swiss corporations to invest and 

government investments will not be sufficient to 

offset the sharp fall in investment of the private 

sector.  The Swiss National Bank is likely to 

continue fighting the threat of deflation using all 

available means, including currency interventions.  

Inflation rates should stay close to zero in 2009, 

2010 and 2011. 
Worsening labour market The unemployment rate is expected to continue to 

rise significantly, and for 2010 and 2011 

unemployment is expected to breach the 5% level, 

these levels have not been observed since 1997. 
Wage growth is expected to diminish significantly 
in the same period, having a decreasing impact on 

inflation subsequently.

 Iceland™s road to recovery After a period of high growth rates supported by 
large investment projects and strong domestic 

demand, which have generated significant 

imbalances, Iceland is now facing the 

consequences of the currency crash of 2008 and 

the ensuing economic crisis.  For the economic 

recovery to take hold, the banking system needs to 

function again. During the early days of the crisis, 

the authorities nationalised the three biggest banks 

and created three new, holding all domestic 

deposits and claims from the old banks. 

Privatisation of these new banks, possibly with 

foreign banks participation, is likely to contribute 

to restoring a sound financial sector in Iceland. 
Domestic demand declined sharply in 2008 and is 
forecast to further decrease significantly in the 

forecast years, due to high interest rates and 

collapsed private consump
tion. Incomes are under 
pressure and specifically pensioners are facing 

benefit cuts following the worsened position of the 

Icelandic pension fund. Unemployment is set to 

increase significantly in
 the forecast years, 
following the impact of the crisis, in all sectors and 

the banking sector in particular.  Inflation peaked 

in 2008 and is expected to remain high in 2009 

easing to around 2% by the end of 2011. The 

current account deficit, high 
in the previous years,   
is expected to decline 
significantly, following 
decreasing imports and is 
expected turn into a 
small surplus by the end of 2010 which may not be 

sustained in 2011.

    179 Jobs wanted Unemployment in Iceland increased within months 
from a low 1% to around 8.7% in May 2009. 

Unemployment in Iceland is now at a similar level 

on average as in the neighbouring countries. 

However, due to the fact that the increase is 

relatively recent in 
Iceland, long-term 
unemployment is still considerably lower than in 

the euro area or the EU as
 a whole. This should 
make it somewhat easier to reduce as the economic 

situation improves. For 2010 and 2011 however 

the unemployment is still expected to remain high, 

around the 10% level. 
Capital restrictions Capital controls were introduced early on in the 

crisis, within the framework of the IMF Stand-By 

Arrangement. Whilst being in
 place, they helped to 
prevent massive outflows and support the 

exchange rate. However, it is likely that these 

restrictions will be lifted during the forecast 

period, to re-introduce normal financial relations 

with foreign markets. This may impose further 

pressure on the exchange rate and further sliding of 

the currency and as such constitute a downside risk 

to this forecast. 
EU Membership The outcome of Iceland's bid for an EU 

membership is not part of this forecast, 

nevertheless it is likely that Iceland's application 

bid may have a positive effect, boost confidence 

levels and provide an upside risk to this forecast.  
Challenges Iceland will be facing challenges generated by the 

current credit crisis a
nd possible further krona 
depreciation, as well as the mounting 

unemployment, entailing significant downside 

risks to this forecast. 
35. RUSSIAN FEDERATION 
Unexpectedly deep recession, tentative recovery 
 180 Russia in 2008 saw its 10
th straight year of strong 
growth, with GDP growing at 5.6% in that year 

and bringing the 1999-2008 average to 6.9%. 

However, amidst the global crisis, in 2009 the 

country was hit by an unex
pectedly deep recession. 
After a double-digit GDP fall in the first half of 

2009 (the economy contracted by 9.8% in the first 

quarter, and by a surprising 10.9% in the second 

quarter) growth in 2009 is expected to be -7.2%, 

while a relatively mild recovery is foreseen for 

2010 (2.3%), gaining some speed in 2011 (2.7%). 

The main reason behind this expected recovery is 

positive net exports, linked to a recovery in 

commodity prices. 
This contraction was the result of the twin shocks 
that hit the Russian economy and the interaction 

between these: firstly the financial shock caused 

by the sudden stop in access to international capital 

flows (affecting a domestic banking system that 

was financing double-digit credit growth with 

external resources); and secondly the real shock 

linked to the sudden and sharp fall in commodity 

prices that form the bulk of Russia™s exports. On 

the demand side, the profile in 2009 is driven by 

steep falls in the main domestic demand 

components: investment fell by around 19% until 

July, and retail sales (a proxy for consumption) by 

over 8% in the same period (on the other hand, the 

contribution of net exports to GDP became 

positive for the first time since 2006).

Russia - GDP
forecas
t This GDP fall should be accompanied by a 
reduction of the current account and trade 

surpluses and by a swing from large fiscal 

surpluses to significant fis
cal deficits. The budget 
is expected to swing sharply from a hefty surplus 
to large deficits, of around 6% of GDP in 2009, 
falling to around 2% in 2010 and 2011, due to the 

reduction in commodity prices and in economic 

activity, plus the fiscal st
imulus package. In the 
case of Russia, it is important to keep in mind that, 

at least for 2009 and 2010, 
these fiscal deficits will 
be financed by the Oil Stabilisation Fund. Russia is 

also forecast to see a large fall in its trade and 

current account surpluses in 2009, with slight 

increases in 2010 and 2011.
 Respectively, the trade surplus shall be 3.6%, 5.3% and 6.4%, while the 

current account su
rplus is expected to reach 1.7% 
in 2009, growing to around 3% and 4% of GDP. 

Unemployment is also fo
reseen to reach around 
8%, falling slowly towards 7%, while inflation is 

expected to slow from 10.5% in 2009 to below 8% 

by 2011. 
Financial and real sector developments Signs of recovery in financial variables appeared 

in March 2009 (when oil prices started to increase 

again), while indications 
of improvement in real 
variables only occurred by the summer of 2009.
  Russia™s main stock markets indexes (the MICEX 
and the RTS) fell by 33% and 47% respectively 

since mid-2008, but had stabilised in levels already 

by November 2008 (after foreign investors 

withdrew speculative shor
t-run liquidity from the 
Russian markets). These indexes increased by 

around 52% and 78% respectively between the end 

of the first quarter and early October 2009. 
A similar pattern is to be found in exchange rate 
developments. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) 

aim is to stabilise a nomi
nal euro-dollar currency 
basket (set at 45 cents of the EUR and 55 cents of 

the USD). Faced with the 2008 terms of trade 

shock, the CBR chose for greater flexibility, 

announcing in January 2009 a 26-41 rouble ﬁbandﬂ 

to the basket in which the currency has be allowed 

to float mostly freely. While the rouble lost around 

22% against the basket since mid-2008, the 

exchange rate has not only stabilised since the 

introduction of the band, but appreciated by over 

8% up to early October 2009 (with the CBR even 

having to recently intervene to counteract what it 

perceived as excessive appreciation).  
Russian hard currency rese
rves fell from a peak of 
almost USD 600 billion at the summer of 2008 to 
Other non-EU Countries, Russian Federation 
  181 around USD 413 billion by late September 2009 
(still the third largest reserves worldwide). This is 

a fall of around 31%, but 
this hides the fact that 
reserves have stabilised roughly at the current level 

since late January 2009. Additionally, at least part 

of the loss in reserves was potentially justified as a 

tool to enable a staged 
and orderly de-leveraging 
of foreign currency debt by Russian companies 

and banks, faced with the ﬁsudden stopﬂ of capital 

flows in late 2008. The Russian banking system 

was financing double-digit growth rates of credit 

(over and above the double-digit growth rates of 

domestic deposits) via external financing. Since 

the significant and abrupt worsening of 

international capital markets in the fall of 2008, the 

net external liabilities of the Russian banking 

system fell from USD 130 billion in mid-2008 to 

USD 26 billion by June 2009. This huge 

adjustment was only possible without widespread 

bank failures due to the massive transfer of hard 

currency reserves from the CBR to the banking 

system. Also, data up to July 2009 indicates a 

limited nominal increase in deposits. 
Finally, another sign of stabilisation lies in interest 
rates. After massive liquidity provisions by the 

CBR, the overnight ﬁMosprimeﬂ rate declined 

from 25% to 6.2% by early October 2009. Parallel 

to that and to the fall in inflation, the CBR reduced 

its own overnight rates (which had been hiked in 

late 2008, as part of its initial strategy to defend 

the peg) six times up to late September 2009. 
Indications of stabilisation in real variables are 
both more recent and more tentative. The ﬁBasic 

Sectorsﬂ monthly index, a composite indicator that 

proxies for GDP, started showing month-on-month 

positive growth only in June (following the pattern 

of industrial production). This brief positive trend 

was interrupted in August 2009, which might 

merely reflect a base effect (as August 2008 was 

the peak of the previous positive manufacturing 

cycle). On the other hand
, the Russian PMI finally 
went above the 50-mark for the first time in 

fourteen months in September 2009 (signalling a 

return to expansion). Russia is the third most 

important trading partner of the EU (and its second 

export market after the US). Its nominal USD 

exports fell by an estimated 45% y-o-y up to 

September 2009 (although the speed of the fall 

seems to be slowing, reflecting the relative 

recovery in oil prices, from Œ48% in January 2009 

to around -40% by September). Imports, on the 

other hand, fell by somewhat less, by Œ40%, 

during the same period, but the speed of decline 
seems to have increased as 2009 progressed (from 
Œ33% in January 2009 to over -40%). This may 

reflect some limited lagged expenditure-switching 

effects arising from the earlier rouble devaluation. 

As a result, the trade surplus until September 2009 

was down by Œ52% compared to September 2008, 

but improving from the Œ60% in January to around 

Œ40% by September. 
Policy reactions  Similarly to other countr
ies, Russia enacted an 
extensive set of polic
y measures, from the 
provision of liquidity to direct support to the 

banking sector, discretionary fiscal stimulus and a 

more flexible exchange rate. Some of these were 

discontinued as the economic situation stabilised 

(notably, the auctioning of fiscal funds by the 

Ministry of Finance to banks and the provision of 

uncollateralised short term funds by the CBR).
(90) The additional fiscal impulse for 2009-10 is 

estimated at around 6% of the 2008 GDP. 
Policy issues and overall prospects till 2011 Russia has been significan
tly affected by the 
global downturn, although some initial, early signs 

of stabilisation may be appearing. Arguably for 

Russia the main channel of transmission was the 

real one, while the financ
ial channel also had large 
effects. The real channel originates in the fall of 

commodity prices, which, beyond trade, has direct 

investment, consumption and budgetary 

consequences. The unexpected depth and duration 

of the downturn, given Russia™s strong initial 

position, is due to the specific way in which those 

shocks interacted in the country. Briefly, the 

forecast is of a subdued recovery from the depths 

of a profound 2009 recession. Inflation should fall 

below double-digit levels only slowly. The budget 

is expected to post significant deficit throughout 

the forecast horizon. Trade and current account 

surpluses are expected to
 decline. Unemployment 
will only progressively be reduced. 
Russian policies used to counteract the downturn 
are very similar to the ones pursued in more 

mature economies: measures to support and re-

capitalise financial markets and institutions, 
                                                          
 (90) Also similarly to other regions, there is a significant 
difference between the announced amounts of the stimulus 
and the totals actually committe
d. For instance, in terms of 
capital injections in the ba
nking sector, the values 
committed are around 40% of the ones announced, while 
for the purchase of assets and lending by the Ministry of 

Finance, this is even lower, at around 31%.

   182 enabling credit markets to continue to work, plus 
fiscal support packages for the wider economy. 

Additionally, Russia, a country with a pegged 

exchange rate, allowed more flexibility in the 

rouble as part of its policy tools. As the economic 

situation stabilizes, some tools are already being 

withdrawn or scaled back. 
Certain longer-term policy 
issues could also be 
drawn from the current downturn. A first one is 

that a greater integration into the World economy, 

via trade and capital flows (the large capital 

outflow from Russia, for instance, was only 

possible because of its liberalised capital account, 

while its most exposed banks were those that were 

privately-owned, either domestically or foreign) 

might also imply some costs. However, such 

recognition of some possibl
e costs associated with 
ﬁGlobalisationﬂ does not imply a support for 

protectionism. The relevant policy question to be 

potentially explored would be to design 

mechanisms that could 
dampen the transmission 
mechanisms of negative shocks arising from the 

changes brought about by greater global economic 

integration.  
A second point is that, as the financial component 
of the shock arguably led 
(or at least preceded) the 
real one, supervisory and regulatory financial 

frameworks reforms are cen
tral in this respect. 
Given the observed spillovers and the integration 
of the global financial system (which, again, ought 

to ultimately be preserved), such reforms should 

have a global and coordinated character. The G-20 

process, in which both the EU and Russia are 

already intensely involved, is the best example of 

those global coordinated policy responses. 
A third element is that albeit macroeconomic 
stabilisation factors (sound fiscal positions, robust 

fiscal rules, large hard currency reserves, a more 

flexible exchange rate) did not insulate Russia 

from the crisis, they enabled it to implement 

policies that cushioned the shock. This could be 

interpreted as reinforcing the importance of the 

(largely pre-existing) robust and consistent 

macroeconomic policy frameworks. 
A fourth aspect is that the growth models that 
relied more on primary sectors have seemingly 

showed themselves to be more affected by the 

downturn. Efforts for a diversification of growth 

sources towards a less commodities-biased 

economic structure could be intensified in the 

future. This, incidentally, is something that is 

explicitly indicated in Russia™s own long-term 

development strategy, the so-called ﬁRussia 2020ﬂ.
