  OVERVIEW   1 The economic situation is exceptionally uncertain. The financial crisis 
deepened and broadened this autumn with
 the banking sector at the eye of the 
storm. Important policy measures have been undertaken by governments in 
both the US and the EU as well as by central banks to restore financial 

stability. Nonetheless, the EU and euro-area economies cannot escape the 

negative effects of the financial distress. Not least because in several 

countries it comes on top of severe housing-market corrections, which in turn 

have been further aggravated by the financial crisis. These shocks have put a 
brake on domestic demand at a time when external demand is fading.  
GDP growth, thus, is expected to come to a stand-still in 2009 in both the EU 
and the euro area, implying a downward revision of about 1½ pps. since the 

spring forecast. Several EU countries 
are forecast to experience a technical 
recession, i.e. two consecutive quarters of
 negative quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) 
growth. Some countries will be subject to more pronounced downturns 

and/or lasting corrections reflecting their exposure to the shocks above and to 

other country-specific factors. For 2010, 
a slow recovery is thus foreseen for 
most, but not all, economies suggesti
ng an acceleration of GDP growth to 
about 1% in both regions.  
Inflationary pressures are 
abating. The expected sh
arp slowdown in economic 
activity should lead to higher unemployment and weaken domestic demand 

growth, easing domestic pressures on consumer prices. Moreover, a rapid 
slowdown in the global economy has reversed the fierce commodity price 

inflation that drove consumer price inflation high in the past. Consumer price 
inflation is thus projected to decline further throughout 2009-2010. 
Reflecting the rapid slowdown and incr
easing unemployment, as well as the 
potentially large costs of the measures to safeguard financial system stability, 
public finances are set to deteriorate appreciably.   
There are significant downside risks to our forecast. Most importantly, the 
deteriorating conditions on the real side could adversely affect the already 

tenuous conditions in financial markets, which in turn could further slow the 
economy, fuelling the feedback loop.  
Forecasts crucially depend on the assump
tions about how the financial crisis 
and its interaction with the real eco
nomy will play out. This forecast now 
assumes that uncertainty about the ultimate size and location of credit losses 

and hence the exceptionally high counterparty risk will continue over the 

coming months and that the negative effects on the broader economy will 
persist throughout the forecast period.  
Turning to the details of our new baselin
e forecast, the impact of the financial 
crisis, the ongoing correction in house prices and lagged effects from 

elevated commodity prices 
are causing global growth 
to fall sharply, with a 
particularly pronounced slowdown in 
advanced economies
. Global real GDP 
growth is set to decelerate from the 
exceptionally strong 5% recorded on 
average in 2004-2007, to 3¾% this year and 2¼% in 2009. During 2010, 

growth is expected to pick up gradually as financial markets stabilise, 

boosting confidence and trade. Excluding the EU, global growth is projected 

to decline from 4¼% in 2008 to around 3% in 2009, but pick up again in 

2010 to 3¾%. Reflecting these developm
ents, world trade is forecast to slow

  2 markedly, from about 7% in 2007 to 5¼% this year and further down to just 
below 2½% in 2009, before reaccelerating to 4% in 2010.  
The US economy is facing a recession. Th
e previously projected W-shaped 
growth profile is maintained, but the recovery is now expected to be more 

gradual. On the back of a significant fiscal stimulus and a stronger-than-
expected depreciation of the dollar, an improvement in net exports and 

stronger consumer spending led to a better-than-expected performance in the 

first half of 2008. However, as the te
mporary impact of the fiscal package 
fades, while residential investment continues to fall, and employment 

declines, the outlook is fo
r a recession in the US ec
onomy during the coming 
winter. Real GDP growth is expected to fall to 1½% this year and to -½% in 

2009. As the impact of the massive easing of monetary policy becomes 

stronger, together with an expected decline in inflation on the back of lower 

oil prices, economic activity
 should rebound gradually from the second half 
of 2009 onwards. The pronounced deterioration in the fiscal position implies 

an increase in the budget deficit to 9% of GDP by 2010. At the same time, 

private savings will increase, leading to an appreciable improvement in the 
current-account balance.  
Emerging economies
 appeared somewhat more resilient until recently, but the 
outlook is darkening. Still, a number of factors play to soften the impact of 

the global downturn. In many countrie
s, macro-economic fundamentals have 
improved over recent year
s, with sounder fiscal policies and a healthy 
external position. Moreover, the increased importance of domestic demand 

and intra-regional trade has shielded 
these economies to a certain extent 
against external shocks. Nonetheless,
 no economy is expected to escape 
unscathed from the current financial crisis, particularly not those with close 
trade ties to the US. 
Commodity prices continued to soar in the 
first half of this year. In particular, 
the global economy was hit by a significant terms-of-trade shock in the 

second quarter of 2008 when commodity
 prices surged by
 55% year-on-year 
(y-o-y). While the price increase for oil was particularly pronounced (at about 
70% y-o-y), prices of non-oil commodities, such as food and metal prices, 
also rose sharply. 
The expected global slowdown should
 ease price pressures in commodity 
markets. This forecast includes a techni
cal assumption for oil prices based on 
current expectations in fu
tures markets, which lead to oil prices of 104 US-
dollars per barrel (USD / bl.) on averag
e in 2008, still well below the peak at 
145 USD / bl. in July 2008, before easing somewhat in 2009-2010 to 86 and 

90 USD / bl. respectively. Food and meta
l prices are also assumed to remain 
at high levels.  
Concerning financing conditions, the intens
ification of the financial crisis has 
caused risk premia to increase sharply 
recently, leading to higher borrowing 
costs for enterprises and households
. Moreover, the ECB's bank lending 
survey suggests a marked tightening of credit conditions. In this environment, 

the banking sector has found it increasingly difficult to raise new capital. The 

necessary deleveraging is therefore expected to slow lending going forward. 

Differences across EU countries are 
sizeable, with e.g. the UK already 
experiencing a credit crunch.

US...

economies held up

    3 Looking ahead, survey indicators point to a further weakening of the 
underlying growth momentum in the EU in the coming months. Confidence 

indicators have fallen almost uninterruptedly since May 2007 and are now 

well below their long-term averages
. In September, the Commission's 
Economic Sentiment Indicator for the EU declined to its lowest level since 
December 1993, while in the 
euro area, it is approach
ing the level of the 2001 
trough. Confidence has deteriorated significantly in all sectors and almost all 

Member States over the last year, and it is likely to deteriorate further in the 

near term, since the September data 
were collected before the marked 
intensification of the financial crisis that followed in the wake of the collapse 

of Lehman Brothers. Other high frequency data on economic activity also 

point to a marked deceleration in bo
th the EU and the euro area. Most 
importantly, industrial production fell by 
0.7% y-o-y, while retail sales were 
down by 1.8% y-o-y in August in the euro area.  
Against the background of unfavourable external conditions as well as the 
further deterioration of soft and hard
 data in recent months, GDP is now 
expected to have declined in the third quarter of this year in both the EU and 
the euro area. This, together with th
e contraction recorded in the second 
quarter for the euro area, would imply th
at the euro area as a whole, a number 
of its Member States, but also some countries outside the euro area are 
already in, or set to ente
r a technical recession.  
Looking further ahead, the outlook fo
r the EU and euro-area economies 
remains bleak. Real GDP is forecast to 
contract during the winter before 
recovering modestly in several countries in the course of 2009 on the back of 
a gradual stabilisation of financial mark
ets and, towards the end of next year, 
an improved external demand. For 2009 as a whole, GDP is expected to 

expand by a mere 0.2% in the EU (0.1
% in the euro area). GDP is forecast to 
accelerate gradually to 1.1% in the EU 
and 0.9% in the euro area in 2010.  
In per capita terms, GDP is expected to decline by 0.1% in the EU and by 
0.2% in the euro area before acceler
ating by about ¾%
 in 2010. As a 
comparison, GDP per capita in the US is
 expected to fall by almost 1½% next 
year before stabilising in 2010.

Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  4 The slowdown in economic activity is broad based, but with continued 
differences across Member States. This
 partly follows from a catching-up 
process in some, but it is also due to other country-specific characteristics 
such as the country's compe
titiveness, its exposure to the financial crisis or to 
a housing shock. Among the largest Member States, GDP is therefore 

expected to fall in Spain and the United Kingdom next year, whereas the 
economy is projected to come to a stand-still in France, Germany and Italy.  
Regarding demand components, while investment, together with exports, was 
a key driving force behind the upswi
ng in recent years, it is now slowing 
abruptly and is expected to act as 
a drag on growth next year. Indeed, 
reflecting the impact of the different shocks, investment has already been 

falling more rapidly than in the previous cyclical downswing at the beginning 

of this decade. Total investment grow
th is forecast to drop from some 5½% 
in 2007 to 1¼% in 2008 and -2% in 2009 before regaining some ground in 

2010 (up to about 1%) in the EU. The profile for the euro area is similar, 
albeit at a somewhat lower level. 
This marked slowdown of investment follows from several factors: tighter 
lending conditions and reduced availability for credit reflecting the need for 

deleveraging in the financial sector; as well as a significant drop in investor 
confidence and demand expectations. Equipment investment, after growing 

by more than 6% in 2007, is projected to fall by about 3% in 2009 in the euro 

area. The downturn of construction investment reflects the cooling-off of 

overvalued housing markets in several EU economies. Construction 

investment is expected to fall by a cumulative 10% or more over the forecast 

period in Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Spain and Lithuania and by more than 
5% in France and the United Kingdom.   
Private consumption, which was unusually weak during this business cycle 
relative to earlier ones, contracted sligh
tly during the first half of this year, 
reflecting both reduced real household income due to high inflation and 
rapidly falling consumer confidence.  
Despite a rebound in real disposable income growth as inflationary pressures 
abate, consumption is expected to remain subdued. Private consumption 

growth is forecast to stay at about ¼%
 in the EU and ½% in the euro area. 
Nonetheless, consumption is expected to fall, in several EU economies that 

are more directly affected by the financial and/or housing crises. A moderate 

recovery is foreseen for 2010 with
 consumption growth accelerating to 
around 1% in both the EU and the euro area.  
Net exports are forecast to contribute 
positively to GDP gr
owth by around ¼ 
pp. in both the EU and th
e euro area over the forecas
t years, despite export 
growth declining rapidly as global trade growth eases. Indeed, growth in 

exports of goods and services
 are expected to drop by more than two thirds in 
the EU from 2007 to 2009. Differences across countries reflect largely their 

regional and sectoral export composition as well as their competitive 

position. However, given the marked slowdown in final demand, the 

deceleration of imports is even more
 pronounced, resulti
ng in the positive 
growth contribution overall. 
The slowdown has started to affect th
e labour market as well, which has 
performed very well in recent years. Em
ployment growth has eased gradually 
to 0.2% q-o-q in the second quarter of this year in both the EU and the euro 
area, while unemployment appears to have bottomed out at just below 7% of

    5 the labour force in the EU, and has incr
eased somewhat in the euro area to 
stand at 7.5% in August. Looking ahead, the labour market situation is 

expected to deteriorate sharply next year. Business surveys point to a 

considerable weakening of employmen
t prospects across sectors and the 
outlook is for a fall in employment next year by some ½% in both the EU and 

the euro area. Further out, some improvement in employment growth is noted 

for most Member States as econom
ic activity picks up. Altogether, 
employment is expected to increase by 
a meagre ¼ million jobs in the EU 
and ½ million the euro area 
in 2009-2010, compared with the 6 million new 
jobs that were created in 2007-2008 in the EU (including 4 million in the 
euro area). 
As a result of the decline in employment, the unemployment rate is expected 
to increase by about 1 pp. in the next 
two years, to some 8% in the EU and 
8¾% in the euro area by 2010, with 
increasing differences across Member 
States.  During the first half of 2008, the labour market situation was still tight and 
capacity utilisation high in several countr
ies and sectors. This, together with 
some limited second-round ef
fects from the surge in 
consumer price inflation 
that started a year ago, caused wage gr
owth to increase to 3.7% in the EU in 
2008. With unemployment rising (above the estimated structural 

unemployment level in 2009) and demand for labour falling, wage pressures 

should ease over the forecast period. Co
mpensation of employees per head is 
expected to decelerate gradually to 3.2% 
in 2009 and 3.0% in 2010 in the EU 
(and to 3.1% and 2.7%, respectively, in the euro area).  
Differences in wage growth persist ac
ross countries, sometimes going well 
beyond what could be explained by discrepancies in productivity growth, 

raising concern about competitiveness. In particular, while unit labour cost 

growth is expected to amount to 3.4% on average this year, it is forecast at 
5% or more in Ireland, Greece, Italy, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia and at 

more than 13% in Bulgar
ia, the three Baltic countries and Romania. Not 
surprisingly, export performance is also projected to deteriorate in some of 

these economies. Going forwar
d, unit labour cost growth is expected to slow 
to 2.7% in 2009 and 2.1% in 2010 in the EU, but to remain at above 5% in 
Bulgaria, Greece and Ro
mania throughout the forecast period.

Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  6 Consumer price inflation continued to rise rapidly in the first half of this year 
on the back of soaring energy and food prices. Headline HICP inflation 

reached a peak of 4.4% in the EU in 
July (4.0% in the eu
ro area), recording 
its highest value in 12 years. At the same time, core inflation, which excludes 

energy and unprocessed food, has increas
ed by about ½ pp. However, with 
the impact of past increases in co
mmodity prices fading away, inflation 
should have turned the corner. Indeed, HICP inflation has declined gradually 
in the most recent months and in September stood at 3.6% in the euro area.  
Overall, HICP inflation is thus forecast 
at 3.9% this year in the EU (3.5% in 
the euro area), up by almost 1½ pp. since 2007 in both regions. In 2009, 

inflation is expected to fall back to 2.4% in the EU with base effects 

remaining favourable (2.2% in the euro
 area) and to decelerate further in 
2010, albeit more slowly. Besides reduced pressure from commodities, the 

weaker economic outlook will put a brake on wage growth, while 

productivity is set to rebound. Moreover, inflation expectations have fallen 
back significantly in recent months, th
ereby becoming well anchored again.  
The current-account deficit declines gradually from 1% of GDP in the EU in 
2008 to about ½% in 2010, whilst being broadly in balance in the euro area. 

However, aggregate developments contin
ue to mask significant differences 
across Member States with several Memb
er States forecast 
to post a double-
digit deficit this year (i.e. Bulgar
ia, Estonia, Greece, Cyprus, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Portugal and Romania), while a significant surplus is expected in 

e.g. Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Finland. Although sizeable 

current-account deficits may facilitate a catching-up process, thereby 

supporting income convergence, both productivity growth and the investment 

share are relatively low for a number of the countries with large deficits. For 

others, productivity growth is relatively modest despite a still high 
investment share.  
Judging from the first ten years of ex
perience with EMU, imbalances across 
euro-area Member States have a tendency 
to persist. This may turn out to be 
particularly damaging in the current situation where some of the countries 

which have built up large external defic
its, partly reflecting continued losses 
in competitiveness, are also those where housing markets are now going 
through the most significant adjustment.  
The economic downturn is expect
ed to have a negative impact on 
government finances over the for
ecast period. The aggregate general 
government deficit in the EU is projected to rise from 0.9% of GDP in 2007 
to 1.6% of GDP in 2008. Si
milarly, in the euro area 
the deficit is forecast to 
increase from 0.6% of GDP in 2007 to 1.3% in 2008. A gradual worsening of 

the government balance is foreseen in both 2009 and 2010, based on the 

usual no-policy-change assumption for the latter, with the deficit foreseen at 

2.6% in the EU and at 2% in the euro area in 2010. Similarly, government 

debt positions have been revised up significantly compared to the spring 

forecast. In the euro area, 
the debt ratio is now expected to increase by over 1 
pp. between 2007 and 2009, in contrast
 to a projected decline of almost 2 
pps. in the spring forecast. Similarly, for 
the EU as a whole, the debt ratio is 
projected to rise by over 2 pps. between 2007 and 2009. Moreover, it must be 

noted that this projection does not incl
ude the potential im
pact of the recent 
rescue packages on debt.   
The deterioration of government finances is due to developments on both the 
expenditure and the revenue side. In pa
rticular, over the forecast period the

Overview 
  7 expenditure-to-GDP ratio is forecast to ri
se by close to 1 pp. in the euro area 
and more than 1 pp. in the EU. At the same time, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is 

projected to decline by 
around ½ pp. in both the EU and the euro area. A 
slower growth of tax bases, a shift aw
ay in the composition of growth from 
domestic demand to external demand, the ongoing decline in asset prices and 

tax cuts in some countries are the main factors behind the decline in the 
revenue ratio. 
Moreover, the public finance projections are subject to significant downside 
risk at present, due, in particular, to the risks related (i) to the general macro-

economic outlook, (ii) to uncertainties regarding the impact of the re-
composition of growth and falling asset prices on government revenues, and 

(iii) to the potential impact on government finances of measures in support of 

financial stability. In particular, the recent rescue operations for financial 

sector companies may lead to higher debt levels. However, given that 

governments take up equity in and provide loans to banks, thereby also 

increasing government assets, this does not entail a rise in net liabilities, at 

this stage. Nonetheless, contingent liabilities (i.e. liabilities that may arise in 

the future if, for example,
 guarantees are called) ha
ve increased significantly 
in this process. 
The projected deterioration of budgetary positions in 2008 and 2009 affects 
most EU countries. It is particularly
 sharp for Ireland,
 however, where the 
government balance 
is projected to reach a defi
cit of 5.5% of
 GDP in 2008 
and almost 7% in 2009. Spain is also expected to see a marked budgetary 
deterioration between 2007 and 2009, by a total of 5 pps. relative to GDP, 

though starting from a surplus position.
 Overall, seven Member States are 
projected to breach and/or stay over th
e 3% of GDP reference value in 2009 
(Ireland, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania and the United 

Kingdom - Hungary and the United Kingdom already being subject to the 

excessive deficit procedure). While Hunga
ry™s headline deficit is forecast to 
fall to below 3½% in 2008 and 2009, the deficit for the UK is projected to 
rise to 4¼% of GDP in 2008 and to above 5½% in 2009.  
Overall, this outlook implies a signifi
cant revision of the spring forecast 
figures. Many of the risks identified at the time have not only materialised 

simultaneously, but also intensified dramatically. This concerns in particular 
the deepening and widening of the financial crisis, which has aggravated the 

housing-market corrections in several countries, but also the spike in 

inflation, with the ensuing global downturn. The situation remains fragile as 

this report goes to print (end-October), with the uncertainty surrounding the 
outlook being exceptionally large an
d risks to the outlook sizeable.  
Concerning the forecast for GDP growth, 
the most important downside risk is 
related to the ongoing financial crisis. It cannot be excluded that the financial 

stress may intensify even further, last longer or have a more pronounced 

impact on the real economy, fuelling the negative feedback loop. This could 
also reinforce the ongoing correction of some housing markets, putting 

balance sheets under increasing strains, which could both hamper the 

necessary deleveraging process in the financial sector and, via negative 

wealth and confidence effects, reduce pr
ivate consumption. Moreover, abrupt 
shifts in risk-preferences cannot be ru
led out in such a situation, suggesting 
that countries with sizeable external deficits and/or debts could face 

increasing difficulties in securing their financing. As the risk scenario in Box 

1 demonstrate, even a relatively moderate

  8 longer a remote possibility, can trigger an
 outright recession (a decline of one 
percent in GDP in 2009) in the euro area.   
Although declining, global imbalances remain significant and could trigger 
disruptive exchange-rate developments. In addition, protectionist or other 

trade-distorting measures can not be fully ruled out, although caused by the 

marked downturn in activity (rather than
 high food prices as was the case 
earlier this year). Finally, whilst emerging-market economies appeared more 

resilient than advanced economies earlier, their outlook has also deteriorated 

and they may be even more affected by
 the financial crisis and the marked 
slowdown among advanced economies than expected. This would have a 

significant impact on global growth, as their contribution to this amounted to 
70% in 2007.  
The future development of commodity prices could entail both upside and 
downside risks: with growth prospects deteriorating, commodity prices and 

also headline inflation could recede fa
ster than expected
, supporting real 
disposable income to a greater extent.  
Upside risks to the inflation outlook 
have receded significantly since the 
spring. Besides the risks regarding future commodity prices, second-round 

effects have been largely contained so far and should become less likely as 
the labour market situation eases sharpl
y. Inflation expectations have also 
fallen in recent months to the levels that prevailed before the outbreak of the 
financial turmoil last year.  
To conclude, risks to economic activity have increased significantly and 
remain firmly tilted to the downside. This, in turn, eases inflationary 

pressures and makes the risks to the pr
ojection for consumer
 price inflation 
more balanced.

Overview 
  9   Box 1: 
Risk scenario autumn 2008 forecast
Uncertainties concerning future developments in 
financial markets form a major risk to the forecast. 
It is not impossible that financial markets will 
remain severely disrupted for a longer period of 
time than assumed in the baseline projections. If 
mistrust among banks and institutions continues to 
affect inter-bank lending for the foreseeable future, 

this could force them to reduce their debt and 
lending to other sectors in the economy even 
further (accelerated deleveraging). The ec
onomy 
could then face a prolonged period in which credit 
availability will be severely restricted.  
In order to demonstrate the implications for the 
forecast, this box describes a model-based scenario 
which assumes such a prolonged and deepening 
credit crisis. In the current circumstances it is 
impossible to foresee how credit markets are going 
to recover from the present turmoil. The scenario 

presented here should therefore not been seen as an 
alternative forecast, but merely as an illustration of 
the potential uncertainties surrounding the central 

forecast. 
The cost of finance for firms and households has 
increased dramatically over the last couple of 
months. As a result of the rise in bank lending rates 
and yields on loans, debt securities and shares, the 
overall financing costs for non-financial 
corporations were by September almost 100 bp 
above the average level in 2007, and lending rates 

for households for consumer credit, house 
purchases and other purposes were more than 50 bp 
higher. Following the deepen
ing of the crisis in the 
weeks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, these 
costs have risen further. As a result of the need for 
banks to de-leverage, inter-bank lending has been 

severely disrupted and reduced availability of credit 
has become a major concern for policy makers.  
The central scenario shows a slowdown in growth 
to levels much below potential in the euro area: 1.2 
per cent in 2008, 0.1 percent in 2009 and 0.9 per 

cent in 2010. The simulation presented here 
assumes a worse-case scenario, in which banks 
tighten their lending conditions further via even 

higher spreads and increased collateral 
requirements. The model used in this analysis is a 
new version of the QUEST III model, a multi-

country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
model that includes some relevant features which 
make it a useful tool to analyse the current financial 

crisis, in particular the explicit modelling of 
housing investment and the presence of credit-
constrained households. The disa
ggregation of the 
household sector into borrowers and lenders allows 
us to look more closely at the transmission of 
financial market (especially mortgage market) 
shocks throughout the economy. 
The simulations assume a further increase in 
financing costs and a reduction in credit available 

to the economy.  The spread firms and households 
are having to pay over and above official interest 
rates to finance (housing) investment is assumed to 

rise by an additional 50 basis points and to remain 
at this elevated level for the foreseeable future. The 
effect of this shock is to
 reduce investment growth 
by 3 per cent in both 2009 and 2010. In addition a 
further contraction of lending of banks to 
households is assumed through a tightening of the 
collateral requirements that credit-constrained 
households f
ace when borrowing for 
house 
purchases, reducing the average loan-to-value ratio 

by an additional one percentage point in 2009. This 
has an impact on consumption and housing 
investment, especially by credit-constrained 

households, and reduces outstanding stock of 
mortgage debt relative to the baseline scenario by 2 
percent in the long run. These model simulations 

suggest the overall effect of these shocks could be a 
further growth contraction of 1 percentage point in 
2009 and between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points in 
2010. Roughly half of this effect would come from 
the increase in spreads (price rationing) and the 
other half from the restrictions in the access to 

credit (non-price rationing).  
This simulation is for illustrative purposes only and 
it should be borne in mind that the QUEST model, 
like other global macro models, may not fully 
capture all factors that could play a role in the 

adjustment to the major upheavals in credit 
markets, as certain non-linearities and interactions 
may not be appropriately captured in the model. 

Nonetheless, the scenario 
illustrates the uncertainty 
surrounding the central forecast and gives an 
indication of the order of magnitude of the potential 

impact of a further deepening and/or lengthening of 
the financial crisis.  
The impact on potential growth (see Box 2.3.1) 
would also be larger, as the increase in financing 
costs and/or rationing of credit would further 

reduce capital accumulation and hence reduce 
potential growth in the medium run. 
  Chapter 1 Current international developments and prospects   1. CHALLENGING TIMES FOR GLOBAL FINANCE 
AND GROWTH 
   13 The financial crisis has dramatically changed the 
global economic outlook. During the first half of 

2008, global growth was relatively robust, 

notwithstanding the imp
act of the combined 
shocks of the surge in commodity prices, the 

financial turmoil and the downturn in several 

countries' housing markets. The terms-of-trade 

shock associated with rapidly rising commodity 

prices started to slow growth in most advanced 

economies from the spring 
onwards, but worse was 
to come when the financial turmoil escalated into a 

full-fledged crisis during the autumn, paralysing 

large parts of the financial system, with sizeable 

effects on confidence and 
subsequently on the real 
economy.  
Led by the downturn in the US, growth in non-EU 
economies will be significantly lower over the 

forecasting period than in previous years. The 

slowdown will be most pronounced in advanced 

economies, while the resi
lience of individual 
emerging economies will vary, depending on their 

specific vulnerabilities.  
The baseline scenario pr
ojects a marked slowdown 
in world growth, falling to 2.3% in 2009, well 

below the long-term average of 3½%. The baseline 

scenario projects 3.7% world growth in 2008 

(down from 5.0% in 2007) and 3.2% in 2010. For 

the world excluding the EU, growth is set to ease 

to 4.3% in 2008 (down from 5.6% in 2007), 2.9% 

in 2009, and return to 3.8% in 2010. This 

represents a substantially more pronounced 

slowdown in 2009 than forecast in the spring. The 

global downturn is expected to take hold in the 

second half of 2008 and to continue through 2009. 

During 2010, global growth will recover only very 

gradually.  
The full impact of the financial crisis is still 
difficult to predict This being the deepest financial crisis since World 
War II means there is exceptional uncertainty at 

present, and sizeable downside risks prevail. Due 

to its extraordinary character, it is very hard to 

estimate how deep the financial crisis will be, how 

long it will last, and what negative effects it will 

ultimately have on the real economy. Underlying 

this forecast is the assumption that the functioning 
of financial markets will resume only gradually in 
the coming months and that the negative effects of 

the crisis on the financial sector and on the broader 

economy will be persistent throughout the forecast 

period. Previous periods of significant financial 

distress can only give some guidance, as the 

combination of the deep and broad-based financial 

crisis (with its interplay with the housing market 

corrections) and the significant policy response to 

it, makes this episode a unique event. 
In recent months, conditions in the global financial 
system have become extr
emely fragile, reflecting 
the dislocation of several key credit markets, 

notably the markets for interbank lending. This 

follows from the collapse in investor confidence, 

amid pervasive uncertainty about the strength of 

banks' balance sheets. The extreme degree of risk 

aversion, particularly since the collapse of Lehman 

Brothers, has led to a generalised flight to quality. 

Interest rates on ten-year government bonds 

declined in the US and in the euro area by, 

respectively, 60 bp and 90 bp (average for the 

area) between mid-June (when they reached their 

most recent high) and 23 October 2008, which is 

the cut-off data for 
the autumn forecast.

Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  14 As a response to this financial crisis, the G7, the 
EU Member States and other countries have put in 

place rescue plans. These plans comprise capital 

injections into financial institutions, state-backed 

guarantees for bank loans, increased access to 

liquidity from central banks and higher levels of 

minimum deposit insurance. These measures 

appear to be having some effect, as indicators of 

stress in money and credit markets have eased 

somewhat from peak levels, although it is too early 

to draw conclusions about the robustness of these 

latest developments.

 On top of the rescue plans, policy rates were 
lowered by the main central banks in a joint 

confidence-building effort on 8 October 2008. 
The problems of the banking sector, linked to the 
freeze in the interbank markets and the lack of 

recapitalisation possibilities, has been reflected in 

its equity price. Compared
 with the start of the 
year, worldwide equity prices for financial 

companies were 53% lower on 23 October 2008 

(against 43% for all companies). Problems have 

also spread to market segments that were 

previously unaffected. Some money-market funds, 

which are traditionally seen as safe-haven 

investments, have experienced heavy outflows, 

after incurring losses on their investments. Worries 

also spread to emerging markets, with a doubling 

in the emerging-marke
t bond spread during 
October 2008.  
The risk of a severe credit crunch is receding. 
Conditions in the credit markets have improved, 

but are still far from normal. As the details of the 

government rescue packages emerge, this trend 

should gather pace. On th
e other hand, the focus of 
financial-market attention has started to shift from 

the health of the banking system to the health of 
the real economy. In view
 of the strong linkages 
from the real to the financial side, there may be 

some way to go before financial markets stabilise 

on a durable basis. On 23 October 2008, euro-area 

corporate bond spreads (over government bonds) 

were at least twice as high as their level at the start 

of the year: 96 bp (from 43 bp) for AAA-bonds 

and 421 bp (from 160 bp) for BBB-bonds.  
The financial crisis has also led to significant 
exchange-rate moves and high volatility. Markets 

continuously re-assess the relative positions and 

outlook for GDP growth, interest rates as well as 

financial stability. Since late summer 2008, growth 

projections for the euro area have deteriorated 

sharply, also relative to growth projections for the 

US, and markets' expecta
tions of euro-area policy 
interest rates have declined. This led to a 

significant recovery of the US dollar. The bilateral 

euro-dollar rate fell to 1.28 on 23 October from a 

peak just below 1.60 in mid-July.

 Meanwhile, the Japanese yen staged an impressive 
rebound, as carry trades were unwound and funds 

repatriated on account of hi
gher risk aversion. The 
bilateral euro-yen rate fell to 127 on 23 October 

from a peak just below 169.5 in mid-July. The 

financial crisis implies a risk of further large 

exchange rate moves. 
Looking at the broader picture, the euro is closer in 
line with fundamentals at th
e end of October, as its 
real effective exchange rate is down 6% from its 

April peak and now stands about 3% above its 

long-term average. The US 
dollar is also closer to 
its long-term average in real effective terms. From 

mid-July, the US dollar™s 
real effective exchange 
rate rapidly appreciated and,
 at the end of October, 
stands 14% above its April trough and some 3% 

below its long-term average. The improvement of 
Current international developments and prospects 
  15 the US current account deficit has stalled at a still 
sizeable level of about 5% 
of GDP. Given that past 
dollar depreciation has occurred mainly against the 

currencies of some advanced economies (most 

prominently the euro), there is room for further 

dollar depreciation against the currencies of the 

main surplus countries in East Asia and among oil 

exporters. 
Commodity prices: the straw that broke the 
camel's back? The global economy was hit by a huge terms-of-
trade shock in the second 
quarter of 2008. In dollar 
terms, commodity prices went up by 62% y-o-y 

(24% q-o-q). While the increase for oil stood out 

(78% y-o-y and 27% q-o-q), non-oil commodity 

prices also rose significan
tly. Food prices, notably, 
were up 26% y-o-y (with the bulk of the rise 

already in the first quarte
r). All over the world, 
households' real disposable income was squeezed, 

contributing to social un
rest in some emerging 
markets (e.g. Indonesia). 
Global business was also 
affected: the global PMI for manufacturing dipped 

below 50 in June 2008 (for the first time since 

2003) and world trade growth slowed to 5% y-o-y 

in the second quarter. The sizeable rise in global 

inflation in the second quarter slowed global 

growth significantly, especially among advanced 

economies.  
After reaching a peak of 146 USD/bl. in July, the 
(Brent) oil price declined considerably, to stay 

around 100 USD/bl. for most of September. 

During October, however, a continuous, sizeable 

downward correction of global growth 

expectations drove the oil price much lower, to 

reach 66 USD/bl. on 23 Oc
tober. Using futures for 
the rest of 2008 and the two coming years, the 

average oil price for 2008 
is expected to remain 
above the hundred-dollar 
mark at 104 USD/bl, 
while the futures indicate a decline to 85.7 USD/bl. 

on average in 2009 and to 90.4 USD/bl in 2010.  
The futures curve is still upward-sloping as the 
structural shift towards stronger oil demand, 

mainly from Asia and the Middle East, is expected 

to constitute a floor for oil prices despite the sharp 

moderation in global growth. Moreover, oil 

producers are expected to continuously fine-tune 

supply in order to support prices. Nevertheless, the 

present lower level of oil prices (and its projected 

path) should be supportive to households' 

disposable income and firms' profits margins, 
helping growth, specifically in the advanced 
economies. 
The price of food commodities went up strongly in 
the second half of 2007 and the first quarter of 

2008. This is explained by several factors. First, 

demand for food is rising in India and China, 

reflecting increased income levels and population 

growth. Second, demand for some products by the 

bio-fuel industry is surging, with ensuing 

substitution effects; and, third, export taxes have 

been imposed in major producer countries. Futures 

point to a further, but more gradual increase. As a 

result, for 2008 as a whole, a rise in USD terms of 

16% is assumed, which will moderate to 3.1% in 

2009 and 2.3% in 2010. 
Prices for most metals have also risen strongly in 
the first quarter of 2008, but have come down 

since the second quarter. On an annual basis, this 

implies a rise of 3.8% in 2008 and in 2009 (based 

on futures prices). In 2010, the rise will moderate 

to 2.4%. While the situation differs strongly from 

one metal to another, sustained demand will 

support metal prices. Finally, for non-food 

agricultural goods, substantially larger increases 

are foreseen for 2008 and 2009 (respectively 

+32.5% and +14.2%), moderating to 0.9% in 2010.

forecast
 World growth resumes in 2010, but remains well 
below the 2004-2007 rates The period 2004-2007 was exceptional for world 
growth, reaching 5% in most years, against a long-

term average of 3½%. Due to a strong first half of 

the year, annual world growth in 2008 (at 3.7%) 

will again exceed the l
ong-term average. The 
growth rate for 2009 (around 2½%), however, is 

similar to the lowest point of the previous 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  16 downturn (2001).
 Growth will re-accelerate only 
very gradually, to 3.2% in 2010.  
A world growth rate of 5% can be expected to 
remain out of reach, even in the medium term, as  

reduced access to external financing means lower 

investment and, as a result, lower potential growth, 

also at the global level. Moreover, in the aftermath 

of the financial crisis, part of the capital stock will 

not be used in a productive way and business 

investments could be crowded out to some extent. 

The projected government deficit for the US in 

2010 amounts to about 2% of world GDP, with the 

government deficits of the EU and Japan together 

adding another ¾%. 
In 2009, the economies of the US and Japan are 
forecast to shrink both by about ½%. The 0.2% 

rise in EU GDP and stronger growth in some of the 

other advanced economies will, however, not be 

sufficient to keep the advanced economies as a 

group from stagnation in 2009. As a result, the 

contribution of advanced economies to world GDP 

growth, aggregated on a purchasing-power-parity 

basis, which will drop to an exceptionally low 

share of 22% already in 2008, will fall to zero in 

2009, before rebounding to 21% in 2010. This 

share was above 30% in the period 2003-2006. 
While emerging economies are expected to 
perform better, their GDP growth in 2009 and 

2010 will also stay well below the achievements of 

the recent past, at respectively 6.2% and 6.9%, 

against an average growth rate of 8.2% over the 

period 2003-2008.  
The relative resilience of emerging markets as a 
group masks substantial differences in individual 

growth developments (and outlook), linked to a 

number of key factors. These include the position 

of the economy as a net 
commodity exporter; the 
indebtedness of its economic agents; the currency 

and term structure of its financing needs; the 

openness of the economy and its trade exposure to 

low-growth areas; and the room of manoeuvre for 

economic policy. 
The macro-economic fundamentals of many 
emerging markets have improved over recent 

years, driven by sounder fiscal policies than in the 

past, credible monetary policies and a generally 

healthy external position. Nevertheless, in October 

2008, financial markets became increasingly 

worried about the impact of the financial crisis (on 

the emerging economies), the stagnation in 
advanced economies and significantly lower oil 
prices. As a result, emerging-market stocks, bonds 

and currencies all plummeted in the days before 

the cut-off date of
 this forecast.  
The increasing reliance of the global economy on 
emerging markets is clearly visible in international 

trade. Imports of goods by emerging markets were 

still up by 9% y-o-y in July 2008, while imports by 

advanced economies were flat compared with one 

year ago. Graph 1.1.5:

3mma yoy%
 In the forecast, imports by advanced economies 
stagnate in 2009, due do the large drop in the US. 

As a result, the contribution of emerging 

economies to world import growth (aggregated on 

a current-exchange-rate basis) will reach 100% in 

2009, up from a already previously unprecedented 

73% in 2008, before falling back to 63% in 2010.  
Overall, global trade growth is expected to 
decelerate from 5% in 2008 to 2.3% in 2009. The 

projected reacceleration to 4% in 2010 still falls 

short of its long-term av
erage growth rate (6%). 
Emerging economies put a floor under the fall 
in global growth China
's growth rate is lik
ely to reach 9.7% in 
2008, notwithstanding a s
light deceleration in the 
second half, partly due to weaker exports. In 2009, 

lower export growth is projected to lead to a 

reduction in investment growth, bringing the 

growth rate down to 7.9%. Growth should still be 

supported by improving terms of trade and still-

strong private consumption. The recent decline in 

commodity prices and the 
favourable harvests are 
expected to bring inflation down further, allowing 

for more monetary stimulus if needed. This 

possibility, as well as some improvement in the 
Current international developments and prospects 
  17 international environment will bring a slight 
acceleration in growth to 
8.8% in 2010. The risks 
around the projected grow
th path are balanced. 
The main negative risk is a weaker-than-expected 

international environment. The main positive risk 

is the possibility Œ and by now probability Œ of a 

sizeable fiscal stimulus
 package. With export 
growth now projected to
 decelerate more than 
import growth, both the trade and the current-

account surplus are likely to
 decline considerably.  
Growth in 
Asia (excluding China and Japan)
 has 
remained resilient so far. Until mid-2008, it was 

thought that Asia had a 
fair chance to decouple 
from the slowdown in advanced economies. The 

momentum, however, has clearly turned. 

Currencies have come under pressure in most 

Asian countries and the cost of capital is rising. 

This coupled with capital outflows may expose 

structural deficiencies 
and external financing 
vulnerabilities in some Asian countries, which 

have unfavourable current account positions (in 

particular 
Korea
, Pakistan and 
India
).  
Asian commodity exporter countries (such as 
Indonesia, Malaysia
 and 
Thailand
) should 
nevertheless continue to benefit from commodity 

prices that are still high by historical standards. 

Also, countries where the economy and/or 

financial sector is relatively less exposed (e.g. 

Singapore
), or where strong domestic demand has 
been driving growth (e.g. 
India
), may prove to be 
more resilient at this juncture. The gradual re-

orientation of growth towards domestic demand 

and prudent macroeconomic management in a 

number of countries has provided policymakers 

with some room for manoeuvre.  
The robust performance of the 
Russian economy 
continued in the first half of 2008. Since this 

summer, a significant d
eceleration was observed, 
however, likely due to the transmission of the 

marked increase in financial instability into the 

real economy. The increased
 foreign borrowing by 
Russian companies, especially banks, is one of the 

elements behind the current fragility of the Russian 

banking system. Due to the strong performance in 

the first half of the year, the forecast for 2008 is a 

robust 7.1%, with a si
gnificant deceleration to 
6.0% in 2009 and 6.5% in 2010, though with a 

larger margin of uncert
ainty around the forecast 
than in spring. Inflation will slowly fall back to 

single-digit levels, while the budget surplus, as 

well as the trade and th
e current account surplus 
are projected to shrink. 
Economic growth in the 
other CIS countries 
(excluding Russia) reached 9.4% in 2007. The CIS 

remains one of the fastest-growing regions in the 

world. Growth in the region
 is expected to be close 
to 7.2% in 2008, but shou
ld decelerate further to 
6% in 2009 and 2010. This
 deceleration reflects, in 
particular, the moderation in the largest CIS 

economies, notably in Kazakhstan, following the 

direct impact of the financial crisis. 
Growth prospects in the 
Middle East and North 
Africa (MENA)
 region remain relatively positive 
in the face of the expect
ed slowdown in global 
growth. The improvement in economic policy 

frameworks will help the region to maintain a 

growth rate of at least 5% during the period 2008-

2010. In oil-exporting countries, the oil sector will 

continue to support the economic activity by 

financing large public investment projects and 

increases in wages. Non-
oil exporting countries 
will face the consequences of slowing export 

markets but continue to benefit from capital 

inflows, especially from the Gulf countries, 

tourism demand and work remittances. 
In Latin America, the unfavourable external 
environment and more difficult financing 

conditions are dampening growth in most countries 

in 2008. Growth in commodity-rich countries will 

reaccelerate again in 2010
. In 2009, growth will 
slow down to 3.3% in 
Brazil
 and to 0.8% in 
Mexico
, which are facing simultaneously the 
slowdown in the US and strong exposure to 

Chinese competition in third markets. 
Argentina
 and Venezuela
 should also see a strong 
deceleration in growth alre
ady in the current year, 
primarily due to soaring inflation. 
In 
sub-Saharan Africa
, growth in 2008 is 
estimated to slow down to 6%, from 6.6% in 2007, 

as the external environment starts to deteriorate 

and is reducing inflows of foreign capital. 

However, oil production is still increasing in 

several countries, while high domestic demand 

should continue to support growth in many oil-

importing countries. Therefor
e, growth is expected 
to decelerate only slightly
 to 5½% in 2009 and to 
return to 6% in 2010. 
Advanced economies stagnate in 2009 Due to the effects of the financial crisis, weaker 

external demand, and a housing shock in several 

economies, the growth projections for most 

developed economies follow a similar pattern: a

    18 sizeable deceleration of annual growth in 2008 and 
2009, returning in 2010 to approximately the same 

low rate as in 2008. While a majority of advanced 

economies will see positive growth rates for 2009, 

some advanced economies are expected to 

experience technical recessions, defined as at least 

two consecutive quarters
 of negative real GDP 
growth. 
The US economy
 performed better than expected 
in the first half of 2008, due to sharply improving 

net exports, against the background of dollar 

depreciation and softening domestic demand, 

reflecting 
inter alia
 the ongoing housing 
correction. Moreover, cons
umer spending held up 
reasonably well, as a result of the sizeable tax 

rebates. Thanks to the positive carry-over from 

2007 and the performance in
 the first half of the 
year, real GDP growth in 
2008 is projected to be 
1.5%.  
Real GDP is projected to 
decline from mid-2008 to 
mid-2009, resulting in a contraction of annual 

GDP by 0.5% in 2009. Already in the third quarter 

of 2008, private consumption is projected to 

contract (for the first time since the recession in 

1990-91). Households are reining in their spending 

as employment falls, real wages are declining, 

credit conditions are tightening, and lower house 

and equity prices are reducing wealth. Importantly, 

the depression in the housing sector continues to 

deepen. Residential investment has already fallen 

by 40% since the peak of the housing boom. 

Housing starts and new-home sales have fallen by 
even more and there is still a large excess of 
supply in the market, which is continuing to 

depress prices and building activity. At the same 

time, non-residential investment, both in buildings 

and equipment, looks precarious. Most indicators 

point to corporate retrenchment. Furthermore, 

growth in US export markets is slowing which will 

reduce the contribution from net exports to GDP 

growth. 
The dramatic worsening of the financial crisis in 
September and October is bound to depress 

economic activity further. The extent to which the 

recent escalation of the fina
ncial crisis will impact 
on economic activity will, to a large extent, depend 

on the effectiveness of the various policy measures 

launched to address the crisis and improve 

confidence.  
The US economy is projected to recover very 
slowly from the second half of 2009 on, with 

growth staying below potential throughout the 

forecast period. This results in an annual growth 

rate of 1.0% in 2010. This profile is based on a 

number of factors which will counteract a negative 

feedback loop between a deteriorating labour 

market and declining demand. First, monetary 

policy has been eased aggressively including the 

recent lowering of the Fed funds rate and an 

unprecedented provision 
of liquidity. Second, 
consumer-price inflation will decline sharply as 

commodity prices stabilise and with a large output 

gap exerting downward pressure on prices and 

wages. This will improve consumers' purchasing 
Current international developments and prospects 
  19 power in real terms. Third, net exports are 
expected to continue to contribute to GDP growth. 

Finally, it is projected that, by mid-2009, the share 

of residential construction in GDP will bottom out 

at 2.6%, down from 5.4% at the end of 2005. By 

then, the imbalances in the housing market are 

expected to have been absorbed. The contribution 

of residential construction to GDP growth would 

thus turn positive. 
The Japanese
 economy is already in a technical 
recession. Growth in Japa
n is expected to slow 
markedly, from 2.1% in 2007 to 0.4% in 2008 and 

-0.4% in 2009 before gradually picking up to 0.6% 

in 2010, still remaining below potential. Against 

the backdrop of lower profits and the global 

economic slowdown, business investment growth 

is expected to remain sluggish, but slightly positive 

in 2008 and 2009. Toward
s the end of the forecast 
horizon, business activity is expected to gradually 

pick up, led in particular by brighter exports 

prospects, mainly to partners in the rest of Asia. As 

regards consumption, the deterioration in the 

labour market will contain wage growth while real 

disposable income will be reduced by inflation. As 

a result, household spending growth is forecast to 

remain subdued over the 
forecast horizon. On the 
external side, export gr
owth is expected to 
decelerate further in 2009, 
before picking up again 
in 2010. Import growth will remain much weaker, 

in line with final demand, leading to a gradually 

increasing trade surplus.  
Canada's GDP data for the first half of 2008 
reflect a bipolar economy Œ sturdy domestic 

demand growth with an ailing external sector 

(partly due to the past appreciation against the 

USD). Overall, the subdued first half will cap 2008 

GDP growth at 0.5%; a slightly lower rate is 

projected for 2009, due to 
the financial crisis and 
the resulting weak global demand. Sound 

macroeconomic fundamentals should help growth 

to accelerate to 2.0% in 2010. In 
Australia
, growth is likely to decel
erate to 2.5% in 2008 
(from 4.2% in 2007) and 
to 2.1% in 2009 because 
of tighter financial conditions and the worsening 

external environment. However, its financial 

system has coped relatively well with the crisis due 

to low levels of problem loans and sound 

capitalisation. In 2010, growth is projected to 

accelerate again to 2.7%. 
New Zealand
's 
economy, in contrast, is already in a technical 

recession. Growth is
 expected to slow to 0.7% in 
2008 from 2.2% in 2007. Growth is expected to 

accelerate somewhat in 2009 
to 1.0% owing to the 
combined effects of tax cu
ts and the recovery from 
the drought, before stepping up to 1.7% in 2010. 
Also for the largest 
EFTA countries
, a return to 
more moderate growth is foreseen. In 
Norway
, domestic demand will continue to be the main 

driver of growth, with still low interest rates 

fuelling strong private consumption. The large 

investments in the oil and gas sector that were 

spurred by soaring oil pric
es are expected to be 
completed in the course of 2008, implying a 

deceleration in investment
 growth going forward. 
The real GDP growth rate 
for 2008 is forecast to 
moderate to 1.9% (from 3.7% in 2007) and further 

down to 1.3% in 2009. For 2010, a rebound to 

higher growth at 2.1% of GDP is expected. In 

Switzerland
, growth in 2008 (at 1.8%) reflects 
both relatively strong external demand in the first 

half and sound investment growth. Stable growth 

in consumer spending will be based on continued 

growth in incomes. Due to the slowdown in world 

growth, the positive external growth contribution 

will turn negative in 2009. Growth is expected to 

decelerate significantly to 
1.2% in 2009 followed 
by a slight rebound to 1.6% for 2010. 
Iceland was 
particularly hit by the 
financial crisis, as its 
banking sector collapsed under the weight of its 

foreign debt. This forecast was closed before 

arrangements with international financial 

institutions were concluded and projects a 

substantial contraction in domestic demand and 

GDP for 2008 and 2009. Positive growth of 2% 

would return in 2010. 
In the three 
candidate countries, economic 
activity is expected to benefit from strong 

domestic demand (including catching-up driven 

investment growth). However, going forward, 

lower external demand and tighter credit 

conditions will weigh on the growth dynamics. 

Growth in the three candidate countries as a whole 

is expected to be around 3.4% in 2008 and to 

decelerate to 2.7% in 2009,
 but to recover to some 
4% in 2010. The acceleratio
n in 2010 is mainly 
due to the recovery of domestic demand in 

Turkey.  Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU   1. A RAPIDLY COOLING ECONOMY 
   23 Renewed growth weakness in the first half of 
2008 Economic activity in the EU and the euro area has 
weakened substantially 
in recent months, after 
almost three years of 
robust economic growth. 
GDP expanded well above trend in 2006 and 2007, 

with annual growth rates of 3.1% and 2.9% in the 

EU (2.8% and 2.6% in the euro area). During that 

period, the broadening of world growth boosted 

EU exports, while domestic demand benefited 

from favourable financing conditions, solid 

corporate earnings owing to moderate increases in 

unit labour costs, and positive developments in 

disposable income, as a result of significant 

improvements in labour market conditions. In 

some EU Member States, the marked increase in 

household net worth coupled with sustained 

borrowing further buoyed up consumption and 

investment. 
Since mid-2007, the underlying pace of economic 
activity in the EU has moderated notably. Year-on-

year GDP growth in the second quarter of 2008 

(latest available figure) cam
e in at 1.7% in the EU 
and just at 1.4% in the eu
ro area, a deceleration of 
1.2 pps. compared to one year earlier in both 

regions. For the year 2008
 as a whole, real GDP 
growth is estimated to slow down to 1.4% in the 

EU and 1.2% in the euro 
area. This represents a 
downward revision of 0.6 pp. for both the EU and 

the euro area from th
e spring forecast.  
Reflecting an external environment characterised 
by soaring commodity pri
ces and a deceleration in 
world growth and trade (even if this deceleration 

must be seen in relative terms after the vibrant 

expansion of the previous year), as well as the 

adverse effects of the financial turmoil and 

housing market corrections in some EU countries, 

economic activity in th
e EU weakened again 
during the first half of 2008. In the second quarter 

of 2008, output even cont
racted in the euro area 
(-0.2%) for the first time since the inception of the 

monetary union and indeed since the early 1990s 

(it remained flat in the EU). The slowdown partly 

represented a technical reaction to the 

exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter 

(0.6% in the EU and 0.7% 
in the euro area), when 
the unusually mild winter in many parts of Europe 

boosted construction activity.

(Quarter-on-quarter % ch.)
(Contributions in pp.)
 Nonetheless, the decelera
tion of activity in the 
euro area was not just a re
flection of the short-term 
volatility of GDP data. In fact, if construction 

investment were excluded, GDP growth in the 

second quarter would have been as low as 0.2% in 

the EU and nil in the euro
 area. Taking the first 
two quarters together to smooth out the volatility 

of quarterly national accounts data, GDP in the 

first half of 2008 expanded at the modest (average) 

quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 0.3% in the EU 

and 0.2% in the euro area
. This represents a sharp 
deceleration compared to the 0.5% registered 

during the previous half year and a sizeable 

downward revision compared to the spring forecast 

(0.5% for the EU and 0.4% for the euro area.  
Softening of export and import growth In terms of the composition of GDP, both export 

and import growth have been on a downward path 

since the third quarter of last year. This culminated 

in a contraction in the second quarter of 2008 in 

both the euro area and EU.  
While the downward trend in import growth was in 
line with weak final dema
nd, the deceleration in 
the growth of exports may be attributed to the 

slowdown in world trade growth and the previous 

appreciation of the euro. According to estimates by 

the CPB Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy 

Analysis, world trade has continued to soften in 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  24 recent quarters. The year-o
n-year growth rate of 
world imports decelerated from almost 8% in the 

third quarter of 2007 to less the 5% in the second 

quarter of 2008. The loss in import momentum 

was broad-based although sharper in industrial 

economies, where imports expanded by a mere 

0.5% on the year, the lowest growth rate since the 

economic downturn in 2001.  
In parallel, the euro-area nominal effective 
exchange rate (NEER) appr
eciated by more than 
7% in the first half of 2008, implying a 

considerable deterioratio
n of euro-area price and 
cost competitiveness.  The shift in the geographical 

composition of EU exports towards fast-growing 

and oil-exporting economies in recent years has 

limited the negative effects of the slowdown in 

developed economies. But the negative impact on 

euro-area exports is likely to be larger in the future 

than it has been in the recent past, due to the 

widespread cooling of global growth as well as the 

usual lags in the reaction of trade to exchange-rate 

developments.  
Nearly stagnant private consumption In the euro area, private consumption contracted in 

both the first (-0.1%) and the second quarter of 

2008 (-0.2%) and was broadly flat in the EU. 

Household spending was dampened by muted real 

disposable income growth, following the sharp 

increase in commodity prices. Tighter lending 

conditions to households and adverse 

developments in asset prices also dampened 

private consumption. According to euro-area 

institutional sector accounts, in the first half of 

2008 real disposable income rose only by 0.3% 

year-on-year, the lowest rate of growth since 1999. 

Soaring energy and food prices pushed up HICP 

inflation to 3.6% in the second quarter, which is 

higher than the 3.4% pr
ojected in the spring 
forecast. In addition, household net worth in the 

first half of 2008 was severely affected by the 

sharp decline in the value 
of share holdings (-12% 
on a year earlier) and further losses in house price 

momentum.  
The stagnation of consumption growth during the 
first half of 2008 was in line with the deterioration 

of consumer confiden
ce. According to the 
Commission's business and consumer surveys, 

managers became more pessimistic about 

employment prospects both in manufacturing and 

services, against the background of a visible 

turnaround in labour market conditions. 
Employment growth, while still positive, 
decelerated between the 
first and the second 
quarter and the unemployment rate rose marginally 

in recent months to stand at
 7.5% in the euro area 
in August (compared to the historical low of 7.2% 

in March). The surveys also revealed consumer 

perceptions of stronger price trends in the first half 

of the year, though these were partly reversed 

during the third quarter. Such perceptions are 

likely to have been influenced by the dynamics of 

commodity prices, especially
 food prices, over the 
same period. In this context, the appreciation of the 

euro provided a shelter agai
nst a stronger impact of 
commodity price movements on domestic 

inflation.

 The subdued growth of private consumption goes 
hand in hand with the downward trend in the 

growth in loans observed since early 2006. In the 

second quarter of 2008, the year-on-year growth 

rate of loans to households slowed down to 5% 

and monetary data available for August 2008 

showed the annual growth rate declining further to 

3.9%. This slowdown reflects the impact of 

increases in bank lending rates since late 2007 and 

the moderation of housing market dynamics in a 

number of euro-area countries as well as a 

tightening of credit standards. Lending to 

households for house purcha
ses is decelerating at a 
faster pace than total households loans.  
Looking to the third quarter, initial indications 
suggest that the weakness in consumption may 

persist. The volume of euro-area retail trade was 

lower in July and August than in the previous 

quarter and was down by 2.5% on a year before. 

Consumers' intentions to make major purchases 

over the next twelve months fell in August to its 

lowest level since the survey began in 1985.  
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  25 Subdued investment spending Much of the volatility of quarterly domestic 
demand during the first half of the year was shaped 

by the profile on investment growth, which rose by 

1.4% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter in the 

euro area and fell by 1.0% in the subsequent 

quarter (+0.8% and -1.0, re
spectively, in the EU). 
The remarkable dynamism of investment in the 

first quarter was fuelled by construction 

investment, which rose by an extraordinary 2.3% 

quarter-on-quarter in the 
euro area (1.9% in the 
EU). This atypical increase was reversed in the 

second quarter: -1.6% in 
the euro-area and -2% in 
the EU.  
Taking the first two quarters together, data show a 
significant loss of momentum in investment 

spending so far this year. Compared to an average 

quarter-on-quarter growth rate above 1% in both 

the EU and the euro area 
in the second half of 
2007, gross fixed capital formation in the first half 

of 2008 contracted slightly in the EU (-0.1%) and 

was hardly growing in the euro area (0.2%).  
Several factors are dampen
ing corporate spending. 
First, (expected) demand Œ one of the key driving 

forces of industrial investment according to 

surveys Œ is slowing down at a faster pace than in 

the recent past. In terms of sectoral activity, value 

added in industry (including constructions) was 

broadly flat in the first half of 2008 (-0.1%, 

quarter-on-quarter, on average) in the euro area, a 

marked weakening compared to the 0.7% growth 

rate observed in the second half of 2007. Activity 

in services was more resilient, while still softening 

from 0.5% to 0.4% over the same period. 
Second, as demand softens, corporate profitability 
deteriorates. The year-on-year growth rate of gross 

operating surplus for the whole economy halved 

between the third quarter of 2007 (6%) and the 

second quarter of 2008 (3.2%). The deterioration 

in profitability was even stronger for non-financial 

corporations (from 6% to less than 2%). Tensions 

on profit margins seem confirmed by 

developments in real unit labour costs, in turn 

related to persistent sluggishness in labour 

productivity. Labour productivity growth came 

down from an annual growth rate of 0.9% in 2007 

to just 0.3% in the first half of 2008. At the same 

time, unit labour costs accelerated from 1.6% to 

3.4%. Enterprises seem to have shed much of the 

gain in profitability registered during the cyclical 

upswing (between mid-2005 and mid-2007).

 Third, capacity constraints are waning. At 82.7 in 
the third quarter of 2008, the degree of capacity 

utilisation in the manufacturing sector was still 

above its long-term averag
e, but is decelerating 
fast from the peak reached 
in the second quarter of 
2007. According to the Commission 

manufacturing survey for the third quarter of 2008, 

firms' perception of a lack of equipment as a factor 

limiting production has been steadily waning. 
Fourth, the tightening of credit conditions since the 
start of the financial turmoil are adversely 

affecting corporates' i
nvestment plans. The 
average cost of external
 financing for euro-area 
non-financial corporations increased by more than 

200 bp. since August 2007. In line with these 

developments, the demand for loans by non-

financial corporations is slowing down, while 

evidence of quantitative constraints on bank loans 

has been limited, so far.  
Increased growth differences across Member 
States Growth dispersion among EU and euro area 
countries, as measured
 by the (non-weighted) 
standard deviation of year-on-year growth rates, 

has remained almost unchanged between 07Q1and 

08Q2. By contrast, growth dispersion among the 

largest EU countries has slightly increased (+0.4 

pp.). The increased dispersion is likely to reflect 

the varying degrees of vulnerabilities in different 

countries. Germany appear
ed, until recently, more 
resilient and less exposed to current headwinds in 

credit and housing markets, but the latest data 

show a marked weakening. Both France and Italy 

suffer from a weak external competitive position, 

Italy also from subdued domestic demand. Spain 

and the UK are exposed 
to a downturn in the 
housing market reinforced by the financial distress. 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  26   Box 2.1.1: 
Sharp housing and construction sector corrections in the EU
The housing cycle has turned in the EU and several 
Member States are currently experiencing sharp 
losses in price momentum, which is also reflected 
in a marked slowdown in residential construction 
activity. The acute stress in global financial 
markets of the last months is further aggravating 
this adjustment process and thereby adding 

considerable downside risks to the growth outlook. 
An important concern at the current juncture is 
therefore how far and for long the housing 
correction will last and what its overall impact on 
the economy will be. This box attempts to provide 
some insights by reference to recent research 
looking at the historical experience with previous 
house cycles in advanced countries. 
The ongoing correction follows nearly a decade of 
buoyant housing markets in which, driven by low 
interest rates and Œ in some cases Œ dynamic 

demographics, several EU countries posted double-
digit rates of house price increases in real terms for 
several years in a row. Among the largest 
countries, France, the United Kingdom and Spain 
were in that position from the turn of the century, 
while Ireland and Denmark stood out among the 
smaller countries. In fact, price increases have been 
considerably more pronounced for these countries 
than for the US over the same time period (Graph 
1).  Recent developments in real house prices across 
selected EU Member States, however, tell a very 
different story. In Ireland,
 real prices declined by 
more than 8% in the first half of 2008 vis-à-vis the 
same period of last year. This compares with an 
average annual increase of more than 6% between 
2001 and 2007. A marked reversal in the dynamics 
of house prices can be seen also in Denmark and 
Spain. Real house prices also declined in Germany 
in the first half of 2008, but this represents the 
continuation of a prolonged downward trend 
observed since the construction boom following 
reunification. In several other EU countries, 

including Finland, France, Italy, United Kingdom, 
Netherlands and Sweden, real house price growth 
has remained positive in the first half of 2008, but 
the pace has slowed considerably compared to the 
(average) annual growth rate observed between 
2001 and 2007.  
The dynamics of real house prices appears to be on 
a parallel path to the ongoing adjustment in 
residential investment. In terms of the contribution 
of housing investment to GDP growth, the 
correction appears to be particularly strong in those 
countries where the downturn in house prices

 European Commission 
has been most marked in recent quarters. Ireland is 
the prime example. In this case, housing 
investment subtracted as much as 3.6 pps. from 
GDP growth in the first half of 2008, against an 
annual contribution of about 0.4 pp. on average, 
between 2001 and 2007. A contraction in housing 

investment in the first half of 2008 was observed 
also in Spain, Germany, Italy and Denmark. In all 
these countries, but Germany, housing investment 
has supported growth over 2001-2007. On the 
basis of available data for other EU Member 
States, housing investment was still adding to GDP 
growth in the first half of 2008, albeit with a 
significantly smaller contribution than in the 
previous eight years. An exception is Sweden, 
where housing investment has not shown any signs 
of weakness so far.  
The extent of the correction in house prices still to 
be expected will depend, inter alia, on the degree to 
which house prices are considered to be 
overvalued. This requires an estimate of an 
equilibrium house price level, on the basis of its 
fundamental determinants. Typically such 
estimates vary depending on the estimation 
technique used, as well as on the sample, data 
sources and time period considered. Nonetheless, it 
seems reasonable to estimate the average 
overvaluation by the end of last year in Ireland and 
the UK at about 20-30%, and about 10-20% in 

Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands (IMF, 
World Economic Outlook, 2008).  However, the 
 (Continued on the next page)

  27 Box (continued) 
 extent of the correction will also depend on other 
factors such as the general economic environment, 
the characteristics of the housing finance system 
(such as the ease of access to mortgage credit, the 
prevalence of variable-rate mortgages and the 
degree of mortgage exposure in the banking 
sector), as well as the policy responses. Therefore, 
the current downgrading of growth prospects 
combined with the severe tightening of credit 
conditions does not bode well for the ongoing 
housing corrections.

 European Commission 
Regarding the possible duration and scale of the 
correction, research by the OECD on 18 countries 
over a 35 year period (Girouard, Kennedy, van den 
Noord and André, "Recent house price 

developments: the role of fundamentals", OECD 
Working Paper No. 475, 2006) suggests that the 
"average" cycle lasts about 10 years. During the 
expansion phase of about six years, real house 
prices increase on average by around 45%. In the 
subsequent contraction phase, which lasts around 
five years, the mean correction is in the order of 
25%. What is noteworthy is that, if only major 
cycles are considered (those with a cumulative real 
price increase equalling or exceeding 15%), both 
the duration and extent of the most recent upturn 
are found to have far exceeded previous 
experience. 
As regards the likely impact on the economy, 
previous research has shown that EU countries 
tend to have a lower sensitivity of consumption, 
residential investment and overall activity to 

swings in the housing markets than non-EU 
countries (such as the US). This is partly explained 
by differences in collateral and housing wealth 
effects. Nevertheless, the historical experience 
suggests that major housing downturns have also 
had a substantial macroeconomic impact in the EU.  
For example, in past housing downturns the 
median
 growth contribution of residential 
investment swung from a positive contribution of 
around ½ percentage point to a negative 
contribution of roughly the same magnitude. The 
median
 growth rate of household consumption and 
GDP have also tended to respond strongly, with 
household consumption plummeting from roughly 
3½% (annual rate) prior to the housing peak to 

close to nil one year after the peak, and GDP 
falling from around 3% to almost -1% after 1½ 
years (Commission services' autumn 2007 

forecast). 
These findings on the EU are in line with research 
by the IMF (WEO 2007, 2008) that reviews post-
war experience in industrial countries and indicates 
that abrupt adjustments in house prices (housing 
busts) are associated with a substantial slowing in 
real GDP growth. The average bust is associated 
with a roughly 3 pp fall in GDP growth, and 
declines in the growth rates of all the main 
components of private final domestic demand. The 
price correction during the busts averaged about 
30%.  
A comparison of recent developments in selected 
EU Member States with the median performance in 
previous housing cycles would indeed suggest that 
the adjustment is far from having run its full course 

(Graph 3). The median experience shows that three 
years after the peak, house prices continue falling, 
with no sign of a recovery.  Moreover, all countries 

featured in the charts reached a higher peak in this 
cycle than in the median house cycleŒ though how 
much higher varied. 
The unfolding global financial crisis is not only 
likely to exacerbate the scale and duration of the 
remaining adjustment, but the interaction of the 
phenomena is also adding considerable risks to the 
growth outlook. The combination of deteriorating 
growth prospects, tightening credit conditions, and 
falling asset prices could rapidly turn the current 
liquidity crisis into one of solvency in the 
economies concerned, with serious consequence 
for the overall economy. The evidence from the 
1960s reviewed in Claessens, Kose and Terrones, 
"What happens during recessions, crunches and 
busts" IMF Working Paper forthcoming, 2008, 
shows that recessions in advance d economies that 
are associated with house 
price busts and a credit 
 (Continued on the next page) 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  28   Box (continued) 
 crunch are slightly longer and deeper than other 
recessions. In particular, they are associated with a 

significantly steeper rise in unemployment (twice 
as high as in other recessions by the 12
th quarter 
following the onset of the recession). 
Finally, a related but separate consideration for the 
growth outlook is that the past decade of 
buoyant 
housing markets also saw a surge in household 
debt, which may have overshot its fundamental 
 level since 2006Q4 (European Commission's 
Quarterly Report on the Euro Area, 2008 N°3). As 

indicated in the report, the necessary deleverage of 
households' balance sheets may have dampened 
consumption growth in the past two years and may 

continue to do so in the immediate future.

  2. THE FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS STRONG 
REPERCUSSIONS FOR THE REAL ECONOMY    29 Financial crisis has intensified markedly in 
recent months The global financial crisis is now in its second year 
and has intensified markedly in recent months. 

Since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (then, 

the fourth largest US investment bank) in mid-

September, confidence in the banking system has 

largely evaporated amid 
a perception of pervasive 
counterparty risk. This
 perception reflects 
continued uncertainty abou
t the ultimate scale and 
location of credit losses an
d asset write-downs due 
to the crisis.  
While the financial crisis was triggered by 
problems in the subprime segment of the US 

mortgage market, it has grown in scale over the 

past 16 months and has been transmitted around 

the global financial syst
em via interconnected 
markets and complex investment instruments. So 

far, about USD 700 billion in credit losses and 

asset write-downs has been recorded globally Œ of 

which one third has been recorded in the EU Œ but 

most recent estimates put
 the likely total losses 
very much higher.  
As investor confidence has collapsed, several key 
credit markets Œ including the markets for 

interbank lending Œ have become progressively 

dislocated, hampering the distribution of liquidity 

within the financial system and the broader 

economy. The accumulating 
stress in credit 
markets is evident from 
the sharp widening in 
Euribor-OIS spreads, which are a measure of the 

scarcity of liquidity (see Graph 2.2.1).  
Central banks have responded to the liquidity 
problems with a range of measures to facilitate 

access to their monetary operations. In this way, 

they have ensured that the demand for liquidity is 

met but the measures have not led to a recovery in 

interbank lending. Indeed, central banks have 

gradually assumed the role of market-maker as 

banks prefer to borrow and deposit money directly 

with a central bank rather
 than transact with each 
other.

1m3m12m6m1y6 m3m1m Banking sector in the eye of the storm The banking sector has been most adversely 
affected by the financial crisis. EU banks have so 

far disclosed losses and booked write-downs of 

more than USD 200 billion, compared to about 

twice the amount in the United States. A number 

of banks Œ both in the United States and the EU Œ 

have been rescued by government intervention and 

partly or fully nationalised. These losses and likely 

further losses in the future have put pressure on 

bank balance sheets, requiring recapitalisation, sale 

of assets or a combination of both. In such 

circumstances and, give
n the bleak outlook for 
profitability, the share prices for banks have 

declined sharply making recapitalisation very 

difficult. 
In October, Member States announced a 
comprehensive rescue package for their banking 

sectors, comprising measures to facilitate 

recapitalisation of systemically important financial 

institutions, to exchange government securities for 

illiquid assets and to guarantee bank debt. After an 

initial attempt to exit the crisis solely by buying 

toxic assets, the US moved also in this direction. 

The EU packages fo
llowed a significant 
reinforcement of national deposit insurance 

schemes. In parallel with the announcement of the 

EU rescue packages, ther
e was a co-ordinated cut 
in interest rates by the major central banks. In 

addition, the ECB further relaxed the rules 

governing access to its monetary operation.  
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  30 The market reaction to the rescue packages has 
been relatively encouraging. Conditions in the 

credit markets have improved slightly (see Graph 

2.2.1, for example), although they are still far from 

normal. As the details of the government rescue 

packages gradually emerge and the packages are 

implemented, this improving trend should gather 

pace. On the other hand, 
the focus of financial-
market attention is increasingly shifting from the 

health of the banking system to the health of the 

real economy. Indicators ou
tside of credit markets 
reflect mounting concerns about the prospect of a 

sharp economic slowdown and possible recession. 

On this basis, there may be some way to go before 

financial markets stabilise on a durable basis.     
Financing conditions have tightened further There is now growing evidence that the financial 

crisis is impacting on the real economy, as 

tightening in credit conditions for both the 

corporate and household sectors begins to feed 

through to activity levels.  
In the euro area, a net balance of 43% of banks 
(subtracting those easing standards from those 

banks tightening them) tightened lending standards 

vis-à-vis firms in Q2/2008, indicating the fourth 

consecutive broad-based tightening of bank 

lending standards in a row. Banks are expected to 

have tightened standards further in Q3/2008. In 

Q2/2008 a near-record net balance of 30% of all 

banks reported a tightening of standards as regards 

loans for house purchase and a record 24% of all 

banks, on balance, reported a tightening of 

standards on consumer loans. Lending standards 

have been tightened by even more in some euro 

area countries, but also in the UK. 
The tightening lending standards can also be partly 
seen in the interest rate
s charged by euro area 
banks for new loans, which have increased by an 

estimated 42 basis points (on average) for non-

financial corporations from July 2007 to June 2008 

(up 10 bps since March 2008). Interest rates for 

house purchases have increased by corresponding 

27 basis points (up 16 bps since March 2008) 

during the same period. 
Risk premia have widened sharply in all corporate 
bond rating classes and the risk of insuring against 

corporate debt default has increased dramatically. 

The issuance of non-financial corporate securities 

issuance has become negativ
e, contracting by EUR 
2.7 billion in June, its third drop within four 
months. As of June 2008, the year-on-year change 
in net issuance of non-financial corporate debt 

securities declined to 4.0%, down from the 7.8% 

recorded in March 2008. Th
e annual rate of change 
for quoted shares has al
so decelerated to 0.3%, 
down from 1.2% recorded in March this year.  
The risk of a broader credit retrenchment Œ or even 
a credit crunch Œ would rise if loan losses were to 

materialise at a significantly faster rate than 

expected. Indeed, tighter lending standards could 

contribute to higher delinquencies as they make 

refinancing more difficult. Indeed, the easy credit 

availability may have shielded banks from larger 

loan delinquencies in recent years.  
Corporate sector under pressure The outlook for the EU 
non-financial corporate 
sector has deteriorated in recent months. The 

change in the outlook reflects concerns about 

future earnings growth and has resulted in sharp 

declines in equity prices and widening yield 

spreads on corporate debt. So far in 2008, the pan-

European Euro Stoxx 600 and the narrower DJ 

Euro Stoxx 50 indices have both declined by about 

50%. The yield spreads on corporate bonds have 

increased in recent months to their highest level 

since 1999 for AA-rated and A-rated issuers and to 

the highest level since end-2002 for lower-rated 

bonds (see Graph 2.2.2).

AAAAAABBBBBB
AAA
AAA The prospect of weaker 
corporate earnings growth 
must be assessed against the background of high 

levels of accumulated debt. The ratio of corporate 

debt to GDP was 88% in Q1/2008, while the ratio 

of debt to value-added in the sector has climbed to 

177%. These high debt ratios leave the sector 

vulnerable to a significant further tightening in 

financing conditions. While the ratio of corporate 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  31 debt to financial assets was still below earlier 
peaks in Q1/2008, the decline in equity prices 

suggests that this ratio may rise further. On the 

other hand, the sector retains very substantial cash 

balances, which could provide a cushion against 

the effects of tighter financing conditions.   
Corporate debt/GDP 
ratios have reached 
particularly high levels in many EU Member 

States, e.g. Belgium, De
nmark, Finland, France, 
Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, 

and the United Kingdom. In contrast, corporate 

debt/GDP remains relatively low in Germany, 

reducing the EU averag
e. Corporate debt/GDP 
ratios in the recently-acceded Member States have 

increased rapidly from the relatively low levels 

recorded only a few years ago, rising above 100% 

in Bulgaria and Estonia and moving in line with 

the EU average in Latvia and Hungary. 
The tightening of financing conditions could 
impact severely on those companies with a high 

proportion of short-term debt. Significant 

refinancing needs within a relatively short period 

of time will be faced
 by many euro area 
companies, which have accumulated a total of 

more than EUR 1,300 billion in bank debt with a 

maturity of less than one year. Non-investment 

grade borrowers will face
 particular financing 
pressures as their access to 
direct financing via the 
bond market is curtailed and the lending standards 

on bank lending have been tightened. Leveraged 

buy-out companies are also likely to face particular 

problems in refinancing in the current credit 

environment.  
The favourable financing conditions of recent 
years have arguably kept corporate default ratios at 

artificially low levels, as reflected in 

correspondingly low loan-loss provisioning in the 

banking sector. As financing conditions become 

markedly tighter, a rise in corporate debt defaults 

is to be expected, putting additional pressure on 

bank balance sheets. Given the often observed pro-

cyclical behaviour of banks, this could result in a 

further tightening of credit conditions in a vicious 

circle.  Household balance sheets suffer amid 
correction in housing markets  The EU household sector has been adversely 
affected by the deteriora
tion in housing markets, 
with significant implications for consumer 

confidence. Housing wealth
 in the euro area is 
estimated to be about 450% of gross disposable 
income of households, making it by far the largest 

wealth component of the household sector.
 A negative evolution in house prices is, therefore, 

likely to weigh on consumer confidence and 

spending, amplifying the negative effects of 

higher-than-expected inflation on disposable 

income. Against this background, the consumer 

climate indicator for the eu
ro area has declined to 
its lowest level in 15 years and the volume of euro-

area retail sales has declined when compared with 

a year ago. Similar developments have been 

experienced in some Member States outside of the 

euro area.  
As for the corporate sector, tighter financing 
conditions for households must be assessed in a 

context of high levels of accumulated debt. In the 

euro area, the household debt/GDP ratio was 59% 

in Q1/2008, broadly unchanged from the same 

period one year earlier but significantly higher 

than the 45% recorded 
in 1999. The ratio of 
household debt to gross disposable income was 

about 91% in Q1/2008 comp
ared to less than 70% 
in 1999. Moreover, the euro-area average conceals 

important differences among Member States.  
Household-debt/GDP ratios in some Member 
States are above 100% 
such as in Denmark, 
Ireland, Netherlands and the UK and between 80% 

and 90% in Portugal and Spain. Debt to gross 

disposable income has reached more than 200% in 

Denmark and Ireland, about 150% in the UK and 

roughly 130% in Spain, Portugal and Sweden. 

Household debt levels are generally much lower in 

the new Member States, but have increased rapidly 

in recent years amid a rapid expansion in domestic 

credit. The often heavy reliance on foreign 

currency borrowing by households in these 

Member States constitutes an additional concern.  
As financing conditions have tightened, the share 
of non-performing loans to households appears to 

have increased. Only a limited number of Member 

States release non-performing loan data, but there 

is evidence of an incr
ease in non-performing 
household loans in those Member States where 

data are available. The 
trend in non-performing 
household loans in individual Member States will 

also reflect the relative weight of fixed-rate 

mortgages and the relative ease with which the 

maturity of mortgage contracts can be extended. 

While such factors will benefit mortgage holders, 

limit debt defaults and help to underpin housing

  32 markets, they also imply lower profitability for 
banks and tighter lending standards as a result.  
Member States with external imbalances 
particularly vulnerable Several of the recently-acceded Member States of 
central and eastern Europe have been affected by 

the deepening financial crisis. The catching-up 

process in these Member States has been driven by 

access to external financing on historically 

favourable conditions, resulting in significant 

current account deficits. In a number of these 

Member States, large current account deficits have 

resulted in the accumulation of external debt 

liabilities, often denominated in foreign currency. 

With financing conditions now more difficult, 

access to foreign capital has become more 

challenging. In such conditions, external funding 

gaps can emerge, resulting in balance of payments 

problems, downward pressure on exchange rates 

and possible risks to financial stability   
Current account deficits and external debt levels 
have also become high in some euro-area Member 

States. For these, challenges relating to external 

financing will not be reflected in exchange rate 

pressures, but in a marked deceleration of domestic 

demand. The situation is aggravated by the 

increasing loss of competitiveness in some of the 

most exposed Member States. As a result, the 

export sector may not be able to offset the 

deceleration in domestic demand.   
 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  33   Box 2.2.1: 
Some technicalities behind the forecast
The overall cut-off date for taking new information 
into account in this macroec
onomic outlook was 23 
October. The forecast also incorporates validated 
public finance data from Eurostat's press release 
147/2008, dated 22 October 2008. 
External assumptions 
This forecast is based on a set of external 

assumptions, reflecting the market expectations at 

the time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions 
from possible volatility during any given trading 
day, averages from a 10-day reference period 

(between 7 to 20 October 2008) were used for 
exchange and interest rates, and for oil prices.  
Exchange and interest rates 
The technical assumption as regards exchange rates 
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange 
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption 
leads to implied average USD/EUR rates of 1.48 in 

2008 and 1.36 in 2009 and in 2010, and average 
JPY/EUR rates of 155.0 in 2008 and 137.4 in 2009 
and in 2010. 
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based. Short-
term interest rates for the euro area are derived 
from future contracts. Long-term interest rates for 
the euro area, as well as short- and long-term 
interest rates for other Member States, are 

calculated using implicit forward swap rates, 
corrected for the spread between the 3-month inter-
bank interest rate and the 3-month swap rate. In 

cases where no market instrument is available, a 
fixed spread vis-à-vis euro-area interest rates is 
taken for both short- and long-term rates. As a 

result, short-term interest rates are expected at 
4.6% on average in 2008, 3.5 in 2009 and 4.1 in 
2010 in the euro area. Long-term interest rates are 

assumed at 4.1% in 2008, 4.0% in 2009 and 4.1% 
in 2010. 
Commodity prices 
Commodity-price assumptions are also, as far as 
possible, based on market conditions, c.f. table 62 
of the statistical annex. In the case of oil prices 
special attention is paid to futures' prices. Prices for 

Brent oil are, accordingly, projected to be 104.0 
USD/bl in 2008, 85.7 USD/bl in 2009 and 90.4 in 
2010. This would correspond to an oil price of 70.3 

EUR/bl. in 2008, 63.0 EUR/bl. in 2009 and 66.5 
EUR/bl. in 2010. 
Budgetary data  
Data up to 2007 are based on government debt and 
deficit data notified by Member States to the 
European Commission on 1 October 2008, except 
in the case of Denmark and the UK for which more 
recent data have become available after the 

notification. In validating these data, ‚Eurostat has 
withdrawn the reservation on the data previously 
reported by Greece in the April 2008 notification 

(News Release 54/2008 of 18 April 2008 on the 
provision of data for the excessive deficit 
procedure)™. 
Eurostat made the following reservation on the data 
for the UK: ‚In 2007 the Bank of England made a 
loan of GBP 26.93 bn (1.9% of GDP) to Northern 
Rock Bank in the context of a rescue operation. 
Eurostat has taken the provisional view that the 

Bank of England lending to Northern Rock should 
have government as the principal party of the 
transaction in the national account framework. If 

the loan were to be treated in this way, the debt to 
GDP ratio would be 46.1% at end 2007 and 44.9% 
at end 2007/2008. The issue will be the object of 

further discussion with the Office for National 
Statistics (ONS). The lending to Northern Rock 
Bank has no direct impact on the UK government 
deficit for 2007.™ Moreover, Eurostat has, as usual, 
amended the deficit data notified by the United 
Kingdom for years 2004 to 2007 for consistency of 

recording of UMTS licences proceeds. Reported 
debt figures were kept unchanged. 
In addition, Eurostat noted that ‚governments have 
implemented or announced a number of measures 
in support of financial stability. As far as 2008 is 

concerned, Eurostat is examining the statistical 
treatment of these bank rescue operations to ensure 
a consistent approach.  
For the forecast, measures in s
upport of financial 
stability have Œ as a rule Œ been recorded as 

follows. Unless reported otherwise by the Member 
State concerned, capital injections known in 
sufficient detail have been included in the forecast 

as financial transactions, i.e. increasing the debt (by 
the amount of the capital injection), but not the 
deficit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and 

deposits are not included as government 
expenditure, unless there is evidence that they have 
been called at the time the forecast was closed. 

Fees by financial institutions for receiving state 
guarantees were also not included as government 
revenue, unless for 
payments that were certain at 
 (Continued on the next page) 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  34 Box (continued) 
 the time of the forecast. This approach is to be 
considered as a technical assumption and in no way 

prejudges Eurostat™s final decision on the statistical 
recording of each of these transactions.  
For 2009, budgets adopted or presented to national 
parliaments and all other measures known in 
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. For 

2010, the 'no-policy-change' assumption used in the 
forecasts implies the extrapolation of revenue and 
expenditure trends and the inclusion of measures 

that are known in sufficient detail.  
The general government balances reported by 
Member States to the European Commission may 
be slightly different from those published in the 
national accounts. The difference concerns 
settlements under swaps and forward rate 
agreements (FRA). According to ESA95 (amended 
by regulation No 2558/2001), swaps and FRA-

related swaps are financial transactions and 
therefore excluded from the calculation of the 
government balance. However, for the purposes of 

the excessive deficit procedure, those flows are still 
booked as interest. 
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output 
gaps The number of working days may differ from one 
year to another. For 2005 and 2006, the effects in 
the EU and the euro area were negative at around -

0.1 pp. each year, while in 2
007 they were neutral. 
The Commission's annual GDP forecasts are not 
adjusted for the number of working days, while 

quarterly forecasts are. As 2008 is a leap year, the 
working-day adjustment is positive, estimated at 
around 0.1 pp. for the EU and the euro area. In 
2009 the working-day effect is estimated to be 
broadly neutral in the EU and with -0.1 pp. slightly 
negative in the euro area while in 2010 it is 

estimated to be broadly neutral in both areas. 
The calculation of potential growth and the output 
gap does not adjust for working days. Since it is 
considered temporary, it should not affect the 
cyclically-adjusted balances. 
  3. EUROPEAN ECONOMY AT A STAND-STILL 
   35 External environment weighing on the outlook In the spring black clouds started to darken the sky 
of Europe's economic prospects. Those clouds 

have now become a heavy storm which the 

European economy is finding increasingly difficult 

to weather. What has been the most severe global 

financial crisis in many decades has brought 

several banks and insurers to the brink of 

bankruptcy. The stress in financial markets 

markedly intensified this autumn, bringing crucial 

credit markets to a stand-still. Financing conditions 

became significantly tighter 
for private enterprises 
and households. Heightened concerns about 

solvency obliged central 
banks and governments to 
intervene in order to stabilise financial markets and 

ensure that financial intermediation continued to 

function as far as possible. 
The financial crisis has also been intensifying the 
correction of housing markets in several European 

economies, where it is creating an additional drag 

on growth. In addition, the financial and housing 

market crises are taking place against the 

background of a markedly slowing world 

economy, reducing the potentially stabilising effect 

of exports. Finally, even taking their recent decent 

into account, commodity pri
ces remain at elevated 
levels, still weighing on real disposable income 

and fading out of inflation only gradually. 
Amid this worsening economic environment, the 
European economy is set to slow markedly. As the 

situation on financial markets remains precarious, 

the risks to our forecast ar
e significant and clearly 
tilted to the downside. Recognising that the 

situation is exceptionally uncertain, our baseline 

scenario is for a modest recession in the EU and 

the euro area until the end of this year with a 

gradual recovery to be expected from mid-2009 Œ 

for most but not all Member States. Overall, 

quarterly GDP growth turned slightly negative in 

the middle of this year in
 both the euro area and 
the EU, bringing the average growth rate for 2008 

down to 1.2% and 1.4% respectively. Average 

GDP growth is expected to slow sharply next year 

to close to a stand-still, before accelerating 

gradually to around 1% in 2010. However, annual 

average growth rates ma
sk the marked slowdown 
this year as well as the moderate recovery expected 

for 2009 due to the statistical carryover from 2007. 

In contrast, year-on-year (y-o-y) growth rates in 
the fourth quarter in th
e corresponding years are 
displaying the underlying momentum more clearly. 

For example, in th
e fourth quarter of 2008 the y-o-
y growth rate is about 1 percentage point lower 

than the average annual gr
owth rate in 2008. In 
2009 however, the acceleratio
n in the course of the 
year is stronger than in 
2008 even if the annual 
average growth rate is about one percentage point 

lower.

Decomposition of the GDP growth forecast
 The impact of the financial crisis– As discussed in section 2.2, the crisis in financial 
markets has deepened, with events unfolding 

rapidly. The current situation is characterised by 

first steps to regain confidence after governments 

and central banks have undertaken unprecedented 

measures. Many key credit markets still are barely 

functioning while the ability of banks to mediate 

financing in the economy is still weakened. As the 

real economy cannot escape 
unaffected, the risk of 
a negative feedback loop emerges. Risks are 

particularly pronounced in those Member States 

where the economic dynamism of recent years was 

accompanied by a strong credit expansion and 

where current-account deficits are large. 
Forecasts at this juncture depend crucially on the 
assumptions made regarding the financial crisis 

and its interaction with the real economy, 

particularly the housing sector. Our assumption is 

that authorities will succeed in avoiding further 

systemic crises, but that the deleveraging of 

financial markets will continue until the end of 

2009 with corresponding negative effects on the 

real economy lasting well into 2010. Overall, 

financing conditions are expected to remain tighter 

than in early 2007 reflecting a repricing of risks.

   36 –and housing market corrections– In several EU Members States increases in housing 
prices have come to a halt while in some countries 

prices even started to drop significantly. In 

consequence, housing investment has started to fall 

and negative wealth effects have started to weigh 

on private consumption in the economies 

concerned. The adverse effects of the global 

financial crisis are reinforcing the ongoing 

adjustments in housing markets, with the decline in 

nominal house prices accelerating. 
–in light of earlier slowdowns Even if the current enviro
nment is characterised by 
several crises at the same time and therefore may 

not be directly comparable with earlier 

downswings, a comparison of different cyclical 

slowdowns may help to shed some light on the 

likely length and depth of the current downturn. 
Earlier studies have shown that EU economies 
tend to have a lower sensitivity of consumption, 

residential investment and overall activities to 

swings in the housing markets than non-EU 

economies (such as the US, see also Box 2.1.1). 

Nevertheless, past experience suggests that major 

housing downturns have also had a substantial 

macroeconomic impact in the EU.  
When comparing the current downswing with that 
of 2000-02 (see Graph 2.3.1), the current one 

appears to be less marked, with the y-o-y growth 
rate 5 quarters after the peak still only about 1½ 
pps. lower than at the peak; in the earlier 

slowdown the difference at the same stage was 

nearly twice as large. However, as the current 

situation is characterised by the existence of 

several, mutually reinforcing shocks, the current 

downswing is expected to continue in the coming 

quarters and to reach a trough of a similar depth 

and after a similar period as was the case in 

2001/2002. In view of th
e structural adjustment 
needed in several economi
es (construction sectors 
and external balances), the recovery thereafter will 

remain moderate until 2010.

 The EU economy to contract further Even though most of the 
available indicators were 
compiled before the tumultuous developments on 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  37 financial markets in September, the downward 
trend is already clearly 
visible in both soft and 
hard data. Survey indicators, which have fallen 

almost uninterruptedly since May 2007, are now 

well below their long-term averages. In September, 

the Commission's Economic Sentiment Indicator 

for the EU reached its lowest level since December 

1993. Moreover, the pace of
 the worsening has not 
yet slowed down and, as mentioned, the September 

values were collected before the intensification of 

the financial crisis. The Economic Climate Tracer 

suggests that the economy is set to contract and 

also purchasing managers' indices (PMI) for the 

last three months indicate 
that economic activity in 
the euro area was in contraction in the third 

quarter, hence signalling further contraction.

 The intensifying headwinds are not only visible in 
the soft data, but are increasingly reflected in hard 

data. The most prominent examples are industrial 

production and retail sales (see Graph 2.3.3). 

Plummeting retail sales indicate that private 

consumption is being severely affected. The main 

factors are the reduction of real disposable income 
linked to past commodity-price increases, 
substantial negative conf
idence effects at the 
current juncture, negative wealth effects due to 

both financial and housing markets, as well as the 

worsening of both credit availability and credit 

conditions for existing loans with adjustable rates. 
Member States affected to varying degrees EU Member States will be affected to different 

degrees depending on their exposure to global 

headwinds, country-speci
fic characteristics and 
domestic adjustment needs.  
The impact firstly depends on the scale of the 
housing market correction. Among the largest EU 

economies, Spain, the United Kingdom and, to a 

lesser degree, France have experienced a 

particularly sharp downturn in their housing prices. 

However, smaller economies like Denmark and 

Ireland are also facing su
bstantial housing market 
adjustments. The direct growth contribution of 

housing investment, which has been substantial in 

recent years, has already 
become negative e.g. in 
Ireland, the UK and Spain and is expected to 

weigh on growth well into next year. In addition, 

housing-related wealth effects, which contributed 

significantly to private consumption growth in 

recent years, are now turn
ing negative, an effect 
reinforced by tightening credit conditions. 

Meanwhile, the adverse effects of the global 

financial crisis are reinforcing ongoing 

adjustments in housing markets, with the decline in 

nominal house prices accelerating. 
The impact also depends on how far an economy is 
integrated in the world economy and hence is 

affected by the slowdown in the main export 

markets. Germany, for example, being a relatively 

open economy, faces a reduction in export growth 

between 2006 and 2009 by more than 10 pps. 

However, at the same time open economies will 

start profiting from the moderate global recovery 

expected in the course of 2009. And countries that 

have gained in price competitiveness, like 

Germany, might be better placed to withstand any 

slowdown in global demand and take advantage of 

the expected uptick therea
fter than those where 
wages have grown faster than productivity over 

many years such as Romania, the Baltics and 

Hungary as well as some large economies within 

the euro area such as Italy and Spain.  
This is particularly important for countries with 
high current-account deficits. While sizeable

   38 current-account deficits may facilitate the 
catching-up process and support income 

convergence, the vulnerab
ility of countries with 
high and persistent current-account deficits 

crucially depends on the following factors: 

productivity growth and investment shares 

achieved via capital inflows, unit labour costs 

reflecting nominal wage growth and productivity 

gains as well as continuity of financial 

intermediation at the current juncture, with 

particular importance of shares of foreign debt and 

debt in foreign currencies as well as the reliance on 

short- rather than long
-term capital flows. Large 
current-account deficits may turn out to be 

particularly critical for countries like the Baltics 

which have built up large external deficits and 

debts, partly reflecting continued losses in 

competitiveness, and at the same time facing 

significant adjustment on their housing markets.  
Finally, the crises on financial markets and 
solvency problems of banks will most severely 

affect economies with a relatively high share of 

financial intermediation in gross value added such 

as Luxembourg or the United Kingdom.  
Private consumption growth will be dampened 
with a moderate recovery in 2010 In 2008, private consumption suffered from 
higher-than-expected in
flation, reducing real 
disposable income. Despite the recent drop in most 

commodity prices, however, 
they remain at higher 
levels than those seen only a few years ago. In 
addition, consumption is being adversely affected 
by severe confidence effects due to the financial 

crisis as well as credit constraints in some Member 

States, which vary in degree and are partly due to 

the substantial decline in house prices.  
The inflationary impact of higher commodity 
prices is, however, expected to fade out of inflation 

in the coming months and in the course of 2009. 

Moreover, wage growth remains relatively robust 

compared with recent year
s. This, in combination 
with a relatively moderate impact of the recession 

on the labour market, will support real disposable 

income. Consequently, the outlook for private 

consumption is expected to stabilise in several EU 

economies that are less affected by the housing and 

financial crises. Overall, a moderate recovery can 

be expected in 2010 in 
both the euro area and the 
EU. This projection would also bring the current 

downswing in consumption in line with the 

experience during the slowdown in the first years 

of this decade. While private consumption 

remained relatively robust after the y-o-y rates of 

GDP growth peaked in 2007Q1, consumption is 

now expected to fall in real terms in the coming 

quarters and differences in y-o-y growth rates 

compared with the peak ar
e expected to bottom out 
only towards the end of 2008/beginning of 2009.  
With lower private consumption growth and 
nominal disposable income continuing to improve 

relatively robustly, the private households´ savings 

rate is expected to increase in most European 

economies in line with the experience of 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  39 countercyclical movements 
in the course of earlier 
business cycles. The savings rate is therefore 

forecast to break its downward trend, which has 

been visible in most larger Member States since 

the mid-1990s. 
Investment held back by slowdown and 
housing correction Investment by the corporate sector in machinery 
and equipment is currently being squeezed by two 

factors. Firstly, in line with the severe economic 

downturn, expectations of future demand are 

dropping. Consequently, in accordance with the 

accelerator theory, corporate investment is falling 

sharply. This process is now being reinforced by 

credit tightening and increased requirements for 

collaterals, while financing directly via the 

financial markets has proven difficult. As a result, 

machinery and equipment in
vestment in the euro 
area is expected to fall 
from nearly 6% annual 
growth in 2007 to nearly -3% in 2009. However, 

with a moderate recovery 
thereafter, the corporate 
sector is expected to start increasing its investment 

in 2010. 
The recession in the housing sector is even more 
marked. However, the decline in housing 

investment by 5% in 2009 in the EU masks 

substantial differences acro
ss countries. In Ireland, 
for example, construction investment is expected 

to fall by about 19% in 2008 and by another 22% 

in 2009. It is also falling sharply, albeit less so, in 

Estonia, Lithuania, Spain, Denmark, the United 

Kingdom and France.

 Due to the financial crisis and housing market 
corrections, total investment has already fallen 

more rapidly than in the previous downswing. 

Quarterly growth rates 
are forecast to remain 
negative well into 2009 and the level of gross fixed 
capital formation is expected to become constant 

only towards the end of 2009, with a moderate 

recovery thereafter. The maximal difference 

between the y-o-y growth rates compared with the 

peak of the business cycle 
is therefore expected to 
be about -11 percentage points in the current 

slowdown while at the beginning of the decade this 

difference was -7 percentage points (see Graph 

2.3.4). 
Government consumption remains stable Government consumption is clearly expected to be 

a stabilising factor in this business cycle with 

broadly constant quarterly growth rates in the EU 

and a slight decline in 2009 and 2010 in the euro 

area. This is in line with the experience of earlier 

downswings which shows that that only after a 

time lag of one to two years does a deterioration in 

the stance of public finan
ces (see section 2.6) lead 
to a slowdown in government consumption. 
International trade supporting growth Given the slowdown in world demand and world 

trade, growth of real EU 
exports is forecast to cool 
down from 5% in 2007 to about 1½% in the 2009 

and regain some momentum thereafter to more 

than 3% in 2010. However, given the marked 

slowdown in domestic 
demand and recession in 
several European economies, the deceleration of 

imports is even stronger. As a consequence, net 

external demand will continue to contribute 

positively to a stabilisation of the business cycle by 

about ¼ pp. in the EU an
d the euro area over the 
forecast period. The current-account balance of the euro area is 
forecast to become only marginally negative in 

2008 and 2009 and the defic
it of the EU 
is forecast 
to stay at or below 1% of GDP. Moreover, the 

deficits of individual Member States are in most 

cases not expected to widen further, in contrast to a 

strong trend witnessed in recent years. That current 

account positions are not expected to improve 

more strongly over the forecast horizon is also due 

to the substantially higher level of imports than of 

exports. As a consequence a much more marked 

slowdown of imports compared with exports or 

even a drop in imports is 
needed in order to reduce 
the net balance. 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  40  Box 2.3.1: 
Impact of earlier oil price increases and the financial crisis on potential growth
Potential growth broadly stable so far– 
Over the last 10 years potential growth in the euro 
area has remained largely stable, although a 
marginal decline of 0.2 pp. has been estimated (see 
Graph 1). The falling growth rates of total factor 
productivity (TFP) have been broadly balanced out 

by a stronger contribution from employment and, to 
a lesser degree, from capital formation. Potential 
growth is set to decline if both oil prices and 

borrowing costs associated with the financial crisis 
remain at elevated levels. Commission estimates 
using the production-function approach show that 

potential growth for the euro area could fall from 
2% in 2007 to 1½% in 2010. This box illustrates 
the likely impact on potential growth from both 
events, using projections from the Commission's 
DSGE model, the so-called QUEST III model.

–before the impact of oil price hikes and– 
Oil prices have increased strongly over the last 
years. Even after having fallen sharply recently, 
future markets expect oil prices to remain about 
150% above the average level of 2000 to 2003 of 

27 euro (see box 2.2.1). These permanently higher 
oil prices could have long-run supply side effects 
because they negatively affect the marginal 

efficiency and, as a result, the level of capital and 
labour. In the medium-run employment will 
recover as real wages adjust to the new productivity 

level. The impact of employment on potential 
growth is hence negligible. The effect on capital 
formation is more permanent since there is no 

corresponding decline of capital costs for firms, 
leadin
g to lower investment. Potential 
growth could 
thus be held back by just above 0.1% p.a. over the 
next 10 years and negative effects will not have 
entirely disappeared even after that. (
1)  –the financial crisis 
The Commission's internal calculations show that 
financing costs for non-financial corporations are 
currently about 120 basis points above their 2007 
levels. In this simulatio
n it is assumed that the 
increase in financing costs is persistent, but is 
currently at a peak, and that financial frictions will 
not unwind quickly. Financing costs, including risk 

premia, will thus remain higher than in the middle 
of the current decade. Crucial financial markets 
may only gradually become functional again, and 
re-establishing efficient financial intermediation 
could take time. In addition, we also consider that 
banks are likely to become more cautious with 

mortgage lending, resulting in a reduced 
indebtedness of private households (with a 
permanent 5 pp. reduction of the loan-to-value ratio 

set by banks). Both financial market shocks will 
cause a substantial short-term decline in 
investment, consumption and employment. Again, 

there is no direct effect on the NAIRU and 
employment should recover after a cyclical 
slowdown. However, both the increase in the 

capital cost and a tightening of credit to private 
households is expected to have a medium-run 
effect on the capital stock. In addition, innovation 

processes will be slowed down and total factor 
productivity could need time to recover. As a 
consequence, potential growth might be reduced by 

a further 0.1 pp. per annum over a period of at least 
three to four years. Depending on how fast bank 
lending returns to normal levels, there could be a 
prolonged effect on capital formation. (
2)  Both shocks could result in about ¼ pp. being 
shaved off potential growth in the medium term. 
However, simply adding the impact of the two 
shocks might give a too-pessimistic picture, as oil 

prices could decline more strongly if the financial 
crisis causes world growth to slow more than is 
already priced in on oil futures markets.

   41 Labour market developments in the EU are 
forecast to weaken notably during the coming two 

years, as firms react to weaker demand outlook, 

tighter financing conditions and some acceleration 

in labour costs. Labour market developments are 

expected to follow cha
nges in economic growth 
with a certain time lag, in line with average 

cyclical patterns. Employment growth is forecast 

to turn negative in 2009 before broadly stagnating 

in 2010, while the rate of unemployment is 

expected to increase by about 1 pp.

 After growing around 1½% per year during 2006Œ
2007, employment is forecast to grow 0.9% in 

2008 in both the euro area and in the EU. This 

cooling of the labour market reflects the general 

economic slowdown taking place in the course of 

2008 and is broadly in line with the spring 

forecast. In fact, while downward revisions to the 
employment growth forecasts have been made in 
some countries where the economic outlook has 

deteriorated more rapidly, most notably Ireland 

and Spain, positive surprises have led to upward 

revisions especially in Bulgaria, Austria and 

Slovenia. 
Employment growth is expected to slow in most 
Member States in 2008, 
especially in Ireland, 
Spain, Lithuania and Latvia, which are all 

relatively strongly affected by the ongoing 

economic slowdown. Employment growth is, 

however, still expected to be relatively benign in 

2008 compared to histor
ical averages across the 
Member States. Among the largest countries, this 

is particularly the case 
for Germany and Poland, 
where employment growth has been relatively 

weak during the past ten years.

 For the year as a whole, the unemployment rate is 
forecast to average 7.6% in
 the euro area in 2008, 
slightly up from 2007. In the EU, the 

unemployment rate is forecas
t to decline slightly to 7.0% in 2008. The marked
 decline of recent years 
has, however, come to an end (between 2004 and 

2007, the unemployment ra
te declined in every 
Member State, except Portugal, Hungary, the UK 

and Ireland). Moreover, si
gnificant differences in 
unemployment levels persist. While the 

unemployment rate forecast for 2008 is close to 

3% in Denmark, at the high end it is almost 11% in 

Spain. Deterioration in employment expectations Recent survey data show a rapid weakening in 

employment expectations in both the euro area and 

the EU, suggesting an increased easing in the 

labour market situation during the second half of 

2008. According to the Commissions' business 

surveys, employment prospects have weakened 
considerably since late 2007 or early 2008 in 
services, retail trade and manufacturing, while in 

construction the deterioration started already 

earlier. The bleak short-term outlook for 

employment is supported by the recent Purchasing 

Managers' Indices (PMI), which also show a 

significant deterioration in employment 

expectations in both manufacturing and services in 

the euro area. In addition to business expectations, 

households' employment expectations have also 

weakened in recent months, according to the 

Commission's survey. 
Bleak labour market outlook for 2009Œ2010 Further ahead, labour market developments are 

expected to deteriorate markedly. An outright 

decrease in the number of those employed is 

forecast in 2009, with em
ployment decreasing by 
0.4% in the euro area and by 0.5% in the EU. A 

marginal recovery is expected in 2010, with 

employment increasing again, though by a mere 

0.1% in both areas. The number of employed is 

forecast to increase by ro
ughly ½ million during 
2009Œ2010 in the euro area 
and almost stagnate in 
the EU, a significant deteri
oration compared to the 
6 million new jobs created during 2007Œ2008 in 

the EU (of which 4 million were in the euro area). 
Employment developments are expected to 
weaken across most Member States. According to 

the forecast, the average change in employment 

during 2009Œ2010 is less than that during 2007Œ

2008 in almost every 
Member State. The only 
exception is Hungary, wh
ere relative improvement 
in employment growth rate is expected after 

notable underperformance compared to EU 

average during the past five years. The most 

pronounced decreases in employment in 

percentage terms in 2009 are expected in Latvia, 

Lithuania, Spain, Estonia, the UK, Ireland and 

Denmark, all recently st
rongly affected by a 
downturn in the housing market, and all 

experiencing negative or very slow GDP growth in 

2009 according to the forecast. While employment 

is expected to rebound marginally in 2010 in the 

euro area and the EU on av
erage, it is expected to 
continue decreasing in Latvia, Lithuania, 

Denmark, Spain, Estoni
a, Sweden and France. 
Unemployment rate set to rise After broadly stagnating in 2008, unemployment is 
forecast to increase markedly
 in the next two years 
in both the euro area and 
in the EU, as the labour 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  43 market cools down. By 2010, the rate of 
unemployment is expected to rise to 8.7% in the 

euro area and to 8.1% in the EU. The largest 

cumulative increase is exp
ected to take place in 
Spain, with the unemployment rate rising from 

8.3% in 2007 to 15.5% in 2010. As the Spanish 

unemployment rate was already among the highest 

in the EU in 2007, its exp
ected strong rise leads to 
a renewed widening in the range of unemployment 

rates across the Member States during 2008Œ2010. 

The number of unemployed is forecast to increase 

by 2.0 million in the euro area and by 2.7 million 

in the EU between 2008 and 2010. 
While the unemployment rates start increasing 
again in the euro area and 
in the EU, the structural 
rate of unemployment (NAWRU) is estimated to 

continue decreasing slightly in the EU and to 

remain broadly unchanged in the euro area. 

According to the forecasts and estimates, the 

unemployment rates in the euro area and in the EU 

are below the NAWRU levels in 2007 and 2008, 

but rising above them in 2009 and 2010. The 

recent tightness in the lab
our market situation is 
thus forecast to ease.

% Strong wage growth in 2008 and 2009 The annual change in compensation per employee 
in the euro area increased 
markedly during the first 
half of 2008. It rose to 3.6% in the second quarter 

of the year, the highest level since the mid-1990s. 

Other measures of nominal labour costs also 

accelerated at the same 
time. According to the 
data, the acceleration has been broad based across 

industries. Growth in 
real compensation has, 
however, been more muted due to the surge in 

inflation. 
The annual change in compensation per employee 
is forecast to rise to 3.6% on average in the euro 

area in 2008, and to decrease thereafter to 3.1% in 

2009 and to 2.7% in 2010. The growth of nominal 

compensation is thus forecast to remain high 

relative to recent years. The strong nominal wage 

growth in 2008 reflects 
the recent tight labour 
market situation in several countries and inter alia 

the effects of wage indexation to past inflation in 

some Member States. The slowdown expected 

during the next two years follows, above all, from 

the rapid loosening of the labour market situation. 
In real terms, compensation per employee is 
expected to increase by ju
st 0.3% in 2008, due to 
the rise in inflation. But as inflation is expected to 

decline thereafter, real compensation per employee 

is forecast to grow by 0.9% in 2009 and by 0.6% 

2010 in the euro area, which would be 

significantly more than in the past five years on 

average. 
As employment developments are forecast to 
follow changes in GDP growth with a certain lag, a 

considerable weakening in labour productivity 

growth is expected early on in the downturn, i.e. in 

2008. Thereafter, labour productivity is forecast to 

accelerate somewhat. Togeth
er with the elevated 
compensation per employee growth in 2008 and 

2009, this implies a surge in unit labour costs. In 

the euro area, the annual change in nominal unit 

labour costs is forecast to increase from 1.7% in 

2007 to 3.3% in 2008. Thereafter in it is expected 

to gradually moderate, declining to 1.9% in 2010. 
Lisbon employment target will not be reached After several years of increases, the employment 

rate is forecast to decline 
in 2009 in bo
th the euro 
area and the EU, before rising again slightly in 

2010. The share of employed persons in the 

working-age population is expected to stand at 

65.5% in the EU and at 65.8% in the euro area in 

2010. Europe will thus fail Œ by a wide margin Œ to 

reach the 70% target set in the Lisbon agenda. This 

Œ together with the need to improve potential 

growth and to ensure sustainable public finances Œ 

points to the need to pre
ss ahead with structural 
reforms.

 in the euro area surged in 
the first half of 2008 and 
reached a peak in July at 
4.0%, which is twice as high as the level recorded 

in August 2007 and the highest value in 12 years. 

Since then, however, inflation has eased 

somewhat, to 3.6% in September. Inflation in the 

EU followed a similar pattern, more than doubling 

from 1.9% in August 2007 to 4.4% in July 2008, 

and moderating subsequently to 4.2% in 

September. 
– on the back of surging oil and food prices – The surge in oil prices, which started in the second 

half of 2007, has increased the contribution of the 

energy component to head
line inflation from just 
0.1 pp. in the third quarter of 2007 to 1½ pps. one 

year later. Similarly, an unprecedented 

acceleration of world fo
od commodity prices 
increased the contribution of the HICP food 

component from ½ pp. to 1¼ pps. (see also Box 

2.5.1) 
–but underlying inflation remained subdued In contrast, 
core inflation
 (HICP inflation 
excluding energy and unprocessed food) in the 

euro area grew at a more subdued pace from 2.1% 

(y-o-y) in the second half of 2007 to 2.5% in the 

first three quarters of 2008. Similarly, another 

measure of underlying inflation Œ HICP inflation 

excluding energy only Œ increased from 2.2% to 

2.6%. Although a rise of core inflation is in line 

with the economy reaching a mature cyclical 

position, it also reflects a certain pass-through of 

strong increases in primary commodity prices, 

particularly food prices. This is confirmed by a 

third measure of underlyin
g inflation, i.e. HICP 
inflation excluding energy and all food, which 
decreased slightly from 1.9% in the second half of 

2007 to 1.8% in the first three quarters of 2008.

 The rise in the first measure of underlying inflation 
can thus be mainly attributed to processed food, 

where inflation increased from 2% in the first half 

of 2007 to 6¾% in the third quarter of 2008. This 

hike is driven by a combination of both transitory 

and structural supply and demand factors. Supply 

was reduced due to damaged crops because of 

adverse weather conditions in 2007 and low 

inventory levels. Subsequent trade restrictions 

imposed by major food-exporting countries have 

also contributed to limiting global supply and thus 

increasing food prices. Conversely, demand was 

boosted due to a switch to biofuels and the rising 

income level in emerging economies. Moreover, 

part of the increase in fo
od prices follows from the 
pass-through of higher energy prices to input and 

distribution costs. Indeed, 
the effect of elevated 
energy prices on the production and distribution 

costs of consumer prices of, for example, dairy 

products partly explains why processed food prices 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  45 have recently increased 
more than unprocessed 
food prices. 
At the same time, 
services inflation
 in the first half 
of 2008 hovered around 2.5%, broadly unchanged 

from 2007 on average. However, during this 

summer, a certain accelera
tion was observed. This 
can be attributed to a larger contribution of 

recreational services (restaurants and cafes in 

particular) and transport services, which is linked 

to higher input prices (i.e. food and fuel, 

respectively).  In contrast, inflation in 
non-energy industrial 
goods
 was stable in the first half of 2008, at a 
slightly lower level than in 2007. Remarkably, 

increasing pressures from rising input costs and 

high capacity utilisation in the manufacturing 

sector seem not to have passed through to this 

price category. This can be explained by deflation 

recorded in the durable 
goods category (electronic 
equipment and cars in particular) and offsetting 

developments in the semi-durable and non-durable 

categories, all linked both to the dampening effect 

of the appreciating euro on import prices and a 

competitive international environment. 
Price pressures mounted at the producer level Price pressure has been building up, however, at 

the producer level. Between July 2007 and August 

2008 
producer price
 inflation surged from 1.9% to 
8.5% in the euro area and 
from 1.7% to 10.4% in 
the EU on the back of accel
erating prices of energy 
and food input products, as well as rising wages. 

At a sectoral level, the increase was particularly 

marked in the energy sector, in which inflation 

climbed from -2.2% to 22.5% in the euro area and 

from -2.7% to 27% in the EU.

 At the same time, inflation in the durable 
consumer goods sector, 
the most immediately 
relevant component for consumer prices, only 

increased to around 2½%, 
1 pp. higher than in the 
first half of 2007. The annual rate of price 

increases in intermediate goods, the largest 

component of the index, continued on a downward 

trend until end-2007 to increase substantially 

thereafter to close to 6% in the third quarter. 
Nominal wage growth accelerated, though it 
did not keep up with headline inflation As regards the 
labour costs
, the loss of households' 
purchasing power due to surging inflation fuelled 

wage claims. The annual growth rate in 

compensation per employee in the euro area 

reached 3.6% in the seco
nd quarter of 2008, which 
compares with 2.2% one year earlier and with a 

2.5% growth for the 2007 as a whole.  
Other labour cost indicators also point to 
increasing nominal wages in 2008, after modest 

developments last year. The ECB's indicator of 

negotiated wages moved up from 2.1% in 2007 to 

2.8% in the second quart
er of 2008. The annual 
growth rate in Eurostat's hourly labour cost index 

for both the euro area
 and the EU shows an 
acceleration from 2.5% (3.7
% in the EU) in the 
third quarter of 2007 to 3.5% (4.4% in the EU) in 

the first quarter of 2008, but with a subsequent 

easing to 2.7% (3.4% in the EU) in the following 

quarter, which can be linke
d to the effect of the 
timing of Easter on the number of hours. The real 

wage growth declined from 0.6% in the third 

quarter of 2007 to -0.9% in the second quarter of 

2008. Rising wage pressures, which appear to have 

been broad-based across most sectors of the 

economy, can be attributed to several factors, 

including tighter labour markets and continued 

high capacity utilisation, as well as, in some 

European countries, to wage indexation schemes 

linking wages to past price developments. 

Nevertheless, as mentioned in the previous section, 

there appears to be limited evidence of 

broad-based second-round e
ffects in the euro area 
so far.  
The slowdown in labour productivity growth in the 
course of 2007 implied 
that the acceleration of 
wage growth had a non-negligible inflationary 

impact. It is estimated that productivity in the euro 

area rose by 0.9% (1.1% in the EU) in 2007, 

decelerating to 0.5% (0.6% in the EU) in the first 

half of 2008. Accordingly, growth in unit labour 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  46 costs is estimated to have picked up in the euro 
area from 1.6% in 2007 to 3% in the first half of 

2008 (the highest value in five years), whilst it 

declined in the EU as a whole from 2% to 0% in 

the same period, due to the developments in the 

UK, where decelerating labour productivity went 

hand in hand with declining compensation of 

employees in the light of the depreciation of the 

pound sterling. 
Worries about unanchored inflation 
expectations dissipated In the first half of 2008, a key concern was 
whether 
inflation
 expectations
 would remain well-
anchored. In September 2008, the survey 

assessment of future price developments pointed to 

an easing in inflation.
 Compared to August, 
managers' input and selling-price expectations in 

September decreased markedly in both industry 

and services in the euro area. They are, however, 

still at high levels and above their long-term 

average, signalling that
 although the ongoing 
short-term inflationary pressures are easing, they 

could still continue in the months ahead. 

Consumers™ price expectations decreased 

significantly from the peak this summer and 

currently stand below the 
long-term average. After 
increasing somewhat at the 
end of last year, long-
term inflation expectatio
ns in the euro area, 
measured on the basis of French government 

inflation-indexed bonds maturing in 2015, hit a 

record high of 2.6% in July 2008, followed by a 

substantial decline to 2.1% in September and again 

to below 2% at the beginning of October.

 Inflation set to fall on account of weak growth 
outlook Looking ahead, average annual HICP inflation in 
the euro area is projected to rise sharply from 2.1% 

last year to 3.5% this year, before coming back to 

around 2.2% in 2009 and easing further to 2.1% in 

2010. In the EU, inflation is expected to mount 

from 2.4% in 2007 to 3.9% this year and to ease 

significantly to 2.4% in 2009 and 2.2% in 2010. 

Compared to spring, the new projections entail an 

upward revision for 2008 (0.4 pp. for the euro area 

and 0.3 pp. for the EU), which mainly reflects 

higher commodity prices in the first half of 2008. 

For 2009, no revision has been done, neither for 

the for the euro area nor for the EU.

Core inflation (HICP excl. energy and unprocessed food)
 In terms of quarterly profiles, inflation both in the 
euro area and in the EU is now considered to have 

reached a peak in the thir
d quarter of 2008 and is 
expected to decrease sign
ificantly thereafter, on 
account of weak growth 
outlook, looser labour 
markets, falling capacity utilisation, lower price 

assumptions for commodities and, last but not 

least, favourable base effects from past hikes of 

commodity prices. From the third quarter of 2009 

onwards, inflation is expected to stabilise at about 

2.1% in both the euro area and the EU until the end 

of the forecast horizon. 
The new projection for inflation originates 
externally from lower-
than-earlier-expected commodity prices and, 
domestically by gradual 
deceleration in unit labour 
cost, after its surge in 
2008. The annual rate of increase in total primary 

commodity prices (including fuels) in USD terms 

is assumed to rise sharply from 9.4% in 2007 to 

about 35% in 2008, but to lose momentum 

thereafter and even decreas
e in 2009, on account 
of falling fuel and metal prices. On the other hand, 

prices of other primary commodities are actually 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  47 set to rebound again only in the fourth quarter of 
2009. Meanwhile, the annual rate of increase of 

import prices is projected to increase from about 

1% in 2007 to 4¼% in 2
008 and ease thereafter to 
about 2% in 2010.  
On the domestic side, growth in nominal unit 
labour costs in the euro area is expected to 

accelerate from 1.7% in 2007
 to 3.3% in 2008 and 
to ease thereafter to 2.5%
 in 2009 and 1.9% the 
following year. This profile is explained chiefly by 

the elevated nominal compensation per employee 

over the forecast horizon, while productivity gains 

remain weak (at 0.4Œ0.6%), with a moderate up-

tick in 2010 only. The accel
eration in wage growth 
in 2008 appears in line with a tight labour market 

in several countries and a general loss of 

purchasing power due to surging inflation. The 

subsequent easing of wage pressures is expected 

on account of a markedly weak growth outlook 

and easing prices.  
The euro-area unemployment rate is projected to 
stay below the NAWRU 
in 2008, exerting an 
upward pressure on wages and inflation. The 

unemployment rate, which dropped to its lowest 

rate since the early 1990s in the first half of 2008, 

is expected to rise from 7.6% in 2008 to 8.7% in 

2010. With unemployment above the NAWRU, a 

negative output gap in 2009 and 2010 should 

eliminate inflationary 
pressures coming from the 
labour market.  
Inflation prospects differ across Member States As regards the situation in individual Member 

States, the upward revisions for 2008 were 

registered in all euro-ar
ea countries apart from the 
Netherlands (a downward revision) and Ireland 

(unchanged). The size of the corrections ranged 

from 0.1 pp. in Germany to 1.1 pp. in Belgium, 

bringing a wider dispersion of inflation rates 

across the euro-area Member States. Among the 

largest countries, Germany 
is set to see an increase 
in inflation in 2008 of 3.0%, France 3.3%, Italy 

3.6% and Spain 4.2%. An expected sharp fall in 

inflation to around 2½% in these countries (with 

the exception of Italy) is likely to bring inflation in 

the euro area to 3.0% already in the last quarter of 

2008. In 2009 the picture is more mixed, as 

inflation has been revised upwards since the spring 

forecast in most but not all countries (Spain, 

France and Italy being thre
e notable exceptions). 
The different pace of pa
ss-through from past 
commodity price hikes is reflected in diverse 
quarterly profiles for inflation. Contrary to other 
countries, in the Netherlands the peak in inflation 

is expected only in the first quarter of 2009. While 

in 2010 inflation in most of the larger euro-area 

Member States (but Spai
n) converges to about 
2.1%, it is projected to remain above or close to 

3% in Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Luxembourg, 

Slovenia and Slovakia.

Dispersion of euro-area MS inflation rates
 Outside the euro area, 
inflation for 2008 was 
revised up in all Member States, with the 

exception of Poland and 
Hungary (unchanged) and 
Latvia (a downward revision). The largest upward 

revisions were recorded for Bulgaria, Lithuania 

and Estonia. In 2009 and 2010 inflation is set to 

ease again. Among the larger non-euro-area 

Member States, inflation in Poland is projected to 

increase to 4.3% in 2008 and ease thereafter to 

about 2½% by the end of 2010, while in the UK it 

is expected to rise to 3.7% in 2008 and come down 

rapidly due to a recession outlook to 1.9% in 2009 

and 1.2% in 2010. Similarly, the expected 

economic recession in Latvia and Estonia is likely 

to bring inflation in these countries substantially 

down by the end of the forecast horizon, from 

double-digit levels recorded in 2008 to 4% and 

3%, respectively. Other Member States with high 

inflation rates Œ Bulgaria and Lithuania Œ are also 

expected to see a decrease 
in inflation, albeit at a 
slower pace. Lithuania is a notable exception 

among all Member States with inflation increasing 

slightly in 2010 on the back of the expected strong 

rise in energy prices resulting from the planned 

closedown of its nuclear power plant. 
 Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  48   Box 2.5.1: 
Commodity price hikes explained
Commodity price hikes behind the surge in 
inflation  
In the course of the last 12 months, the European 
economy was hit by a commodity price shock, 
particularly from oil and agricultural products. As a 
consequence, consumer price inflation doubled, 
peaking at 4.4% in the EU in July. Simulations with 
the Commission's QUEST model suggest that the 

accumulated effect of the oil price increase between 
2004 and early October 2008 (i.e. from •27 to •65 
per barrel) would imply a reduction in GDP of ¾% 
in 2008 and 1% in 2009, and an increase in 
consumer prices of 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively. 
The contribution from energy to headline HICP 

inflation in the EU surged from about 0.3 pp. at the 
beginning of 2007 to 1.7 pps. in July 2008. 
Meanwhile, the contribution from food prices to 

headline HICP increased from 0.6 pp. to 1.5 pps.  
The impact of the commodity price hikes has 
differed from one country to another. Energy prices 

contributed most to inflation in Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Belgium, Cyprus and Luxembourg. In 
these countries, energy added between 2 and 3 pps. 

to inflation in the first half of 2008. By contrast, the 
role of energy in overall inflation has only 
moderately increased in Malta and the Netherlands, 

while it has decreased in Slovakia since end-2006. 

The sizeable variations in the contribution of energy 
prices to HICP inflation across Member States are 
due to differences in the increase in energy prices 

(on account of differences in the energy mix and in 
energy tax levels), the functioning of domestic 
energy markets, and the weight of energy in national 

HICP baskets (ranging from 5.4% in Malta to 18% 

in Romania).  
Similarly, it can be observed that food price 
increases have had the largest impact in Latvia, 
Lithuania, Bulgaria, and Romania, where the 
contribution from both processed and unprocessed 

food ranged from 4.7 to 8.0 pps. in the first half of 
2008. Conversely, hardly any change in contribution 
from food to headline inflation was observed in 

Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Greece. The 

differences across countries can be attributed both to 
the degree of competition on food products markets 
and the relative importance of food in the HICP 
basket (ranging from 15% in the UK to 43% in 
Romania).

Structural and temporary factors, not 
speculation, behind price hikes 
The recent commodity price surge, and the oil price 
boom in particular, has been driven by a 
combination of structural supply and demand 
factors. On one hand, sustained strong demand 

growth, in particular from emerging markets in Asia 
and the Middle East, has generally proved to be 
relatively unresponsive to oil price changes, at least 

in the short term, reflecting inter alia a high degree 

of subsidies. On the other hand, the response along 
the supply chain was sluggish, from exploration to 
extraction, oil transport and refining, due to 

underinvestment and slow capacity expansion in the 
late 1990s following many years of low commodity 
prices. Thus, the onset of the latest boom coincided 

with lower-than-usual inventory and spare capacity, 
which usually act as buffers at times of rapidly 
growing demand.  
Contrary to common perception, there is hardly any 
evidence that real or financial speculation (the 
purchase of commodities intended for resale at a 

higher price rather than for commercial use) may 
have contributed to the commodity price increases. 
Inventory holdings of key commodities generally 

remained low or even declined in the current boom, 
indicating that any price increases cannot be 
ascribed to the build-up of real assets. The role of 

financial s
peculation in drivin
g up the 
prices of

 commodities was also negligible, as there is little 
evidence to suggest that tr
ading in futures markets 
has driven the price increases or has destabilised the 

commodity markets in the first half of 2008.

The price of oil has more than halved from the 
recent peak in July, reaching about 70 USD/bl in 
mid-October. This decline was driven by a higher 

supply from the OPEC countries on one hand and on 

the other by the deteriorating growth outlook and 

materialising risk of recession in many advanced 

economies. 
Similarly, the hike in food commodity prices reflects 
a combination of supply and demand factors, both 

structural and temporary.  
On the supply side, there was a decline in yield 
growth rates in 2006-2007 linked to a series of 

weather-related shocks, including a drought damage, 

particularly in eastern Europe, North Africa and 

Australia. The impact of weather-related shocks is 

generally temporary and indeed the crop prospects 

for 2008 are favourable. The recent food 

commodities boom occurred 
in a setting with low 
global inventory levels, which can partly be 
attributed to declining relative prices and low 
investment rates due to high levels of protectionism 

in agriculture in advanced economies and the bias of 

public expenditure in developing economies towards 

subsidies rather than investment in infrastructure or 

research. Moreover, rising energy costs passed

through to food prices due to higher input costs o
fagricultural production, most notably fuel an

   50 Government finances in 2008-2010 hit hard by 
economic downturn The economic downturn is expected to have a 
significant negative impact on government 

finances over the forecast period. In addition, the 

public finance outlook is also surrounded by 

particularly high uncertainties. Evidently, 

developments in public finances are closely related 

to the general macro-economic outlook. To the 

extent that the latter is subject to high (ﬁfat-tailﬂ) 

downside risks, there are also considerable 

downside risks to the development of public 

finances. Moreover, following several years of tax-

rich growth there is high uncertainty attached to 

the evolution of tax revenue, as it is unclear to 

what degree a much less tax-favourable growth 

pattern over the forecast period will dent the 

elasticity of tax revenue with respect to growth. 

Significant imponderables also stem from the 

public rescue operations for the financial sector. 

Potentially, the impact on government finances 

may be very large, but on the basis of the currently 

very limited knowledge only a few operations 

could be incorporated in the forecast (see Box 

2.2.1 for more details on technical assumptions 

regarding the recording of these rescue 

operations).  
Bearing these caveats in
 mind, the aggregate 
general government deficit in the EU is projected 

to rise from 0.9% of GDP in 2007, the most 

favourable position in many years, to 1.6% GDP in 

2008, thereby more than offsetting the decline 

recorded in the year before
. Similarly, in the euro 
area the aggregate defic
it is forecast to bounce 
back from 0.6% of GDP in 2007 to 1.3% in 2008, 

following its decline by the same magnitude in 

2007. This represents an upward revision of the 

spring forecast projections by 0.4 pp. in the EU 

and by 0.3 pp. in the euro area.  
A further worsening of the government balance is 
foreseen in 2009, to a deficit of respectively 2.3% 

of GDP in the EU and 1.
8% in the euro area Œ a 
deterioration of 1.0 and 0.7 pp. compared with the 

projections in the spring forecast. On the basis of 

the usual no-policy-change assumption, the deficit 

is projected to rise further in 2010, to 2.6% of GDP 

in the EU and to 2.0% in the euro area. 
The deterioration of government finances is due to 
developments on both the expenditure and the 

revenue side. The somewhat more pronounced 

deterioration of the government balance in the EU 

compared to the euro area is explained by the fact 

that the projected upward 
dynamics of expenditure 
is stronger for countries outside the euro area than 

for those inside. In particular, the expenditure ratio 

(total government expenditure as a percentage of 

GDP) in the EU as a whole is forecast to rise from 

45.8% in 2007 to 47.1% in 2010. In the euro area, 

the expenditure ratio is projected to rise more 

moderately, from 46.1% to 46.9% of GDP over the 

same period. This reverses the trend decline in the 

expenditure ratio observed for both areas in the 

years up until 2007. In line with the worsening of 

the economy, the expansion of government 

expenditure is projected to be predominantly 

driven by social benefits and transfers, while other 
The economies of the euro area and the EU

profits, etc.). Moreover, the composition of output 

growth is set to move away from tax-rich domestic 

demand to tax-poor external demand, especially in 

countries where current account deficits are high.  

In addition, due to the ongoing correction in asset 

markets, extra revenue linked to asset price 

inflation and transaction duties ("stamp duties") 

are likely to dry up. Finally, several countries have 

announced or already im
plemented reforms aimed 
at cutting taxes. In view of the large number of 

factors adversely affecting government revenue the 

deterioration in government revenue remains 

surprisingly mild. This is due to various balancing 

factors such as the impact of fiscal drag and a 

relatively robust labour market situation over the 

forecast period. Correcting for cyclical factors, one-offs and other 
temporary measures, the structural deficit is also 

projected to deteriorate in 2008, by ½ pp. in both 

the EU and the euro area, reaching 1½% and just 

below 2% of GDP, respectively. This represents an 

upward revision of the sp
ring forecast figure by ½  
and ¾ pp., partly reflecting a downward revision 

of the cyclical component of the deficit (in turn 

due to a higher than previously estimated output 

gap). In 2009 and 2010, the structural balance is 

forecast to stabilise in both areas, indicating that 
the deterioration in headline positions is mainly 
caused by less favourable cyclical conditions.   
In the spring forecast it 
was already pointed out 
that the commonly agreed method of estimating 

potential output may overestimate potential growth 

in times when forecasts for actual growth have to 

be revised down. The downward revision of 

potential growth Œ and, mechanically, the 

concomitant upward revision of the cyclical part of 

growth Œ in the current forecast does not therefore 

come entirely as a surprise. Since further 

downward revisions of potential growth cannot be 

excluded, it may well be that
 future estimates will 
lead to a further worseni
ng of structural balances 
without this necessarily being driven by an 

underlying deterioration in the fiscal position. This 

may affect in particular developments after 2008, 

when the current forecas
t projects structural 
balances to broadly stabilise in the EU and the 

euro area.

 Euro area: budgetary deterioration in most 
countries  The projected deterioration of (headline) budgetary 
positions in 2008 is broad-based among euro-area 

countries. Only Germany,
 Greece, the Netherlands 
and Portugal escape this general trend. In Greece, 

this is helped by sizeable one-off operations and 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  52 follows a large statistical upward revision of the 
deficit for 2007 (to 3.5% of GDP). The swing 

between 2007 and 2008 is particularly large for 

Ireland and Spain (-5.7 and -3.8 pps.), the two 

countries that are hardest hit by the economic 

downturn. The projected rise in the budget deficit 

is also significant for Malta (-2 pps.) which, 

together with Ireland, is expected to breach the 

3%-of-GDP reference value in 2008. Other euro-

area countries where the 
deterioration in the 
budgetary balance is fore
seen to be significant 
(more than, say, 0.5 pp.) are Italy and Cyprus. For 

France, the government balance is estimated to hit 

the 3% of GDP threshold in 2008 - though not to 

breach it.   
In 2009, all euro-area 
countries except Greece, 
Malta and Slovakia are set to see a (further) 

worsening in their budgetary positions. A further 

rise in the deficit is forecast, in particular, for 

Ireland (to almost 7% of GDP) and Spain (to 

almost 3% of GDP), while the continued budgetary 

deterioration in France is expected to lift the deficit 

above the 3%-of-GDP reference value (to 3.5% of 

GDP). In Portugal, the deficit is projected to rise to 

2.8% of GDP. By contrast, in Malta the deficit is 

expected to fall back below the 3%-of-GDP 

reference value. 
In 2010, based on the customary no-policy-change 
assumption budgetary positions are projected to 

broadly stabilise for most euro-area countries. A 

strong rise of the deficit (of 0.5 pp. or higher) is 

projected for Greece and 
Portugal. Portugal's 
deficit would surpass the 3%-of-GDP reference 

value.  
Correcting for cyclical factors, one-offs and other 
temporary measures, the underlying structural 

budgetary position in 2008 is forecast to 

deteriorate, in particular, for Spain and Ireland, 

Cyprus, Italy, Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia. The 

structural deficit of Spain and Ireland is forecast to 

further worsen in 2009, while most other countries 

are projected to see broadly unchanged or even 

improved structural positions in 2009. 
Significant budgetary worsening also outside 
the euro area Outside the euro area, two Member States, 
Hungary and the UK, are cu
rrently subject to the 
excessive deficit procedure. While Hungary™s 

headline deficit is forecast 
to decline to 3.4% in 
2008 (from 5% of GDP in 2007), the UK's is 
estimated to rise to 4.2% of GDP. A further small 
decline is projected for Hungary in 2009, while the 

UK is expected to see a further deterioration of its 

budgetary position, with the deficit rising to 5.6% 

of GDP.  
Of the other Member States
 outside the euro area, 
budgetary positions are set to deteriorate markedly 

in the Baltic countries and in Romania. In the 

former, this is due in large part to the sharp 

economic downturn, while 
in Romania a lack of 
expenditure control seems to be behind the rising 

deficit. In 2008, only Romania is expected to 

exceed the 3%-of-GDP reference value, but in 

2009 the budgetary balances of Latvia and 

Lithuania are also forecast to breach the 3%-of-

GDP deficit threshold. Estonia is expected to keep 

its government finances within the 3%-of-GDP 

deficit limit over the whole forecast period.  
Relatively steady budget
ary positions are forecast 
for the Czech Republic and Poland, as the 

economic slowdown in thos
e countries is expected 
to be mild. Among countries in surplus, i.e. 

Bulgaria, Denmark and Sweden, the budget 

balance is projected to 
remain largely unchanged 
in Bulgaria, while Denmark and Sweden will see a 

fairly substantial decline in their surpluses, with 

Denmark expected to remain in surplus over the 

forecast period but Sweden forecast to post a small 

deficit in 2010.  
In structural terms, budgetary positions are 
projected to develop largely in line with headline 

positions, with notable deteriorations for the Baltic 

countries, Romania and the UK, but also for the 

countries in surplus (Denmark and Sweden). By 

contrast, improvements ar
e projected for Bulgaria, 
the Czech Republic and Po
land. For Hungary, the 
structural balance is proj
ected to remain fairly 
stable around 3½% of GDP.  
Debt again on the rise Government debt positions have been revised 

upwards significantly compared to the spring 

forecast. In the EU, the debt ratio is projected to 

rise by 2¼ pps. between 2007 and 2009, a 

significantly worse development than the slight 

improvement projected in th
e spring. Similarly, in 
the euro area the debt ra
tio is now expected to 
increase by more than 
1 pp. between 2007 and 
2009, in contrast to a proj
ected decline of 2 pps. in 
the spring forecast. The de
cline in the debt ratio 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  53 observed between 2005 and 2007 will therefore 
reverse again.  
In the euro area, an increa
se in the debt ratio is 
expected in 2008 for Belgium, Ireland (by more 

than 5 pps.), Spain, Fr
ance, Luxembourg, Malta, 
the Netherlands and Portugal. With the exception 

of Belgium and the Netherlands these countries are 

forecast to also see their debt ratio increasing in 

2009. Outside the euro area, rising government 

debt levels are projected for the Baltic countries 

and Romania (from very low levels), and for the 

UK.  
As was mentioned above, there is a risk that the 
recently implemented or 
announced measures in 
support of financial stability may push up debt 

levels even further. However, as part of the rescue 

operations for financial sector companies, 

governments are also taking up equity and 

providing loans to banks, thereby increasing 

government assets. A rise in gross debt does 

therefore not entail a corresponding rise in net 

government liabilities at this stage. 
 
 7. DOWNSIDE RISKS PREVAIL 
   54 Risks to the growth outlook firmly on the 
downside– The economic situation and outlook for the EU 
have turned exceptionally uncertain. Many of the 

main downside risks to the growth outlook 

identified in the spring have not only materialised 

simultaneously, but also intensified sharply. Prime 

among these is the financial crisis, the spike in 

inflation, the ensuing global downturn, and the 

housing market corrections in several Member 

States. In the first place, the ongoing financial market 
turmoil, which originated in the US subprime 

mortgage market in the summer of 2007, 

intensified sharply over the last few months, 

turning into the most severe financial shock to 

industrial economies sin
ce the 1930s. From mid-
September, against the background of a collapse in 

confidence among market participants and a 

generalised flight to quality, events unfolded 

rapidly, unpredictably, and with dramatic 

consequences. The failure of Lehman Brothers 

sent shockwaves to market segments previously 

unaffected in the US and abroad. Despite central 

banks repeatedly injecting massive liquidity into 

the system, key credit ma
rkets remained largely 
blocked, with investors unwilling to assume 

counterparty risk. Other major investment banks 

soon faced intense strain and had to be taken over. 

In an attempt to restore confidence an 

unprecedented bail-out pack
age (700 billion USD) 
was announced, after some initial difficult 

negotiations, and passed in the US. This failed to 

restore confidence and problems continued to 

spread, with several major banks in various 

countries having to be rescued or nationalised. In 

early October, a wave of panic took hold of equity 

markets, leading to the largest slides in decades, in 

both industrialised and emerging economies. To 

prevent an outright run on their banking sectors, 

several governments enacted or raised blanket 

deposit guarantees. In an
 extraordinary move, a 
group of some of the main central banks, including 

the US Fed and the ECB, resorted to concerted 

surprise interest rate cuts in an effort to restore 

confidence and attenuate the impact on the real 

economy. EU government
s also showed their 
strong determination to fight the crisis in a 

concerted fashion at the ECOFIN and European 

Council meetings in October. However, despite 
some encouraging signs in money markets, at the 
time of writing the situation remains fragile and 

highly uncertain, as illustrated by still plummeting 

stock markets.  
The baseline scenario for the autumn projections 
assumes that the financial turmoil will last until 

2009, with effects on the 
real economy being felt 
also in 2010. However, at the current juncture, 

there is a substantial risk that financial stress may 

intensify even further or remain very high for a 

longer time period. This could come about, for 

instance, through a "negative feedback loop", with 

the deteriorating economic prospects adversely 

affecting the already precarious conditions in 

financial markets, and vice versa. With a longer 

lasting period of uncertainty about counterparty 

risk in financial markets, it cannot be excluded that 

adverse credit conditions, such as increased 

spreads, collateral requirements and the required 

deleverage process may limit the pace of economic 

activity more than assumed in the current 

projections. Further abrupt adverse shifts in 

investor and consumer confidence cannot be ruled 

out either. In addition, the negative wealth effect 

caused by falling real and financial asset prices 

could hamper domestic demand further.  
A second major risk to the growth outlook relates 
to the ongoing correction in housing markets in 

several Member States, which could be more 

pronounced and protracted 
than currently assumed. 
This concerns especially
 Ireland and Spain, but 
also Denmark, France, Sweden, and the UK, where 

house prices have been assessed as overvalued. 

Experience with housing cycles since the 1970s in 

industrial countries indicates that following a 

boom in house prices, the median downturn lasts 

for around five years a
nd is associated with a 
substantial slowing in real GDP growth (an 

average decline of about 3 
pps., six quarters after 
the peak), with all main growth components being 

negatively affected (see al
so Box 2.1.1). The risk 
associated with the ongoin
g housing corrections is 
clearly aggravated by the 
financial crisis, as the 
impact of a further tightening of lending conditions 

and reduced credit availability is likely to intensify 

the housing downturn.  
The impact from the current distress in the 
financial markets could also have a large adverse 

impact on Member States with high external 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  55 deficit and debt. One of the lessons to be drawn 
from ten years of experience with EMU is that 

imbalances across euro-area member countries 

have tended to persist. This may turn out to be 

particularly damaging in the current situation 

where countries which have built up large external 

deficits, partly reflecting continued losses in 

competitiveness, are also those where housing 

markets have been hit the hardest. Although 

outside the euro area diff
erences in current-account 
positions partly reflect the increased heterogeneity 

within the EU, as the 
catching-up process may 
involve sizeable current-account deficits, in some 

cases it also points to a need for adjustment. A 

rising external debt servicing burden implies a loss 

of domestically available income, which ultimately 

limits growth. The ongoing financial market 

turmoil, by hampering the smooth flow of funds, 

increases the risks for the financing of large 

current account deficits. 
Other downside risks to the growth outlook relate 
to the possibility of disruptive exchange-rate 

developments associated with the continuation of 

significant global imbalances (though the US 

current-account deficit is projected to narrow 

further over the forecast period). While the euro 

has depreciated significantly since the summer, as 

markets have re-assessed the outlook for GDP 

growth and interest rates in the major economies, 

bringing it closer in line with fundamentals, it 

remains somewhat above its long term average in 

real effective terms. Foreign exchange markets 

have lately been going through a phase of 

volatility, reacting strongly 
to financial sector 
developments and policy efforts to safeguard 

financial stability. This suggests that as long as the 

financial crisis lasts, there is a heightened risk of 

abrupt exchange-rate moves. Furthermore, the 

possibility of rising protectionist and other 

measures distorting trade and capital flows 

represents an additional downside risk to the 

current growth projections. Finally, as the financial 

crisis spreads globally, it may end up affecting 

emerging markets more than
 currently anticipated, 
thereby depressing world and trade growth more 

than expected in the current projections. 
On the upside, inflation, which continued to soar 
throughout this spring and into the summer, 

reaching levels not seen 
in a decade, appears to 
have passed its peak. Inflation developments 

largely reflected the surg
e in commodity prices, 
which have also retreated since reaching peak 

levels in the summer. On the back of deteriorating 
growth prospects, commodity prices, and also 
headline inflation, could recede faster than 

currently assumed, thus freeing up more 

disposable income than envisaged in this 

forecast. (1)  Another upside risk to the growth outlook relates 
to the relatively sound starting position in the 

current downturn of ba
lance sheets in the non-
financial corporate sector in the EU, which could 

allow European economies to withstand the current 

headwinds better than cu
rrently anticipated, as 
long as the period of financial stress is not 

sustained.  
Graph 2.7.1 quantifies these risks in terms of the 
possible deviation of output growth from the main 

scenario. It shows the impact various combinations 

of risks could have on euro-area GDP growth, the 

outcomes being weighted by the probability of 

their occurrence. At a 90
% confidence interval, 
GDP growth in the euro area in 2009 could be 

about 2 pp. lower than the central scenario if all 

negative factors materialise, but it could also be up 

to 1¼ pp. higher if the positive risks to the outlook 

were to materialise.

 (1) Oil prices have continued to 
fall since the cut-off date for 
the autumn forecast and stood at 60 USD / bl. on 28 

October. Recent developments would imply that the oil 
price assumptions based on future markets could have been 
close to 10 USD lower / bl. in 2009 if they had been 

derived when this report went to print, but only 5 euro / bl. 
lower taking into account recent exchange-rate movements 
as well. Using the multipliers from the Commission's 

DSGE model 'QUEST' as a rule of thumb, GDP would 
have increased by up to 0.1 pp. and consumer price 
inflation decreased by 0.2 pp. 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  56 In 2010, risks to the 
forecast become more 
pronounced and at the same time further skewed to 

the downside. Taking ag
ain the 90% confidence 
interval, euro-area GDP growth could be up to 3 

pp lower, if mostly downside risks materialise. In 

the opposite case, euro-area GDP growth could 

also be somewhat (1½ pp.) higher. 
–while inflation risks more balanced As regards the inflation outlook, risks appear to be 

broadly balanced, though slightly tilted to the 

downside. The risk identifie
d in the spring forecast 
of a further up-tick in commodity prices has 

already materialised and have had a direct impact 

on consumer price inflation so far in 2008. 

However, second-round effects have been 

relatively limited thus far. Soaring oil and food 

prices, especially the latter, have had a significant 

but temporary impact on inflation expectations 

(see Graph 2.5.3), while wage claims have 

gathered pace mostly 
on account of a maturing 
cyclical position, including tighter labour markets 

and continued high capacity utilisation, though in 

some cases nominal wage indexation schemes 

linking wages to past inflation developments have 

also played a role. The easing of commodity price 

pressures after their peak in July 2008, falling 

confidence due to the financial crisis and the 

worsening outlook for GDP growth have brought 

expectations substantially down, to levels last seen 

before the supply shocks (see Section 2.5). 
Looking ahead, the risk of additional second-round 
effects is considered to 
be small at the current 
juncture, with the European and global economy 

slowing sharply, implying an easing of labour 

markets and decreasing capacity utilisation. 

Moreover, if the emerging market economies were 

to be less resilient than currently assumed, it could 

result in commodity prices declining further, 

posing a downside risk to the inflation outlook. On 

the other hand, commodity prices have surprised 

on the upside several years in a row and there can 

be no certainty that they will gradually decline in 

the coming years, especially since global oil 

inventories are still relatively low and the oil 

market is prone to geopolitical tensions. 
To conclude, in an exceptionally uncertain 
environment, the outlook for the EU is clouded 

with substantial and mostly downside risks. 

Already in the spring, but also in the interim 

forecast released in early September, it was 

stressed that risks to the growth outlook were on 
the downside. As a result of the deepening and 
widening financial crisis, downside risks to the 

growth outlook now appear even larger than at the 

time of the interim forecast. On the other hand, 

with the deteriorating growth prospects, risks for 

inflation have become more balanced than in both 

the spring and interim forecasts.  
Given the substantial risks associated to the 
unfolding financial crisis and the exceptional 

surrounding uncertainty, an alternative scenario is 

presented in Box 1. It simulates the 

macroeconomic impact of a further tightening of 

financial conditions (an increase in spreads and a 

further tightening of collateral requirements). The 

results show that this would entail a significant 

additional loss in output for the euro area of some 

1 pp. this year and a further 0.2 pp. next year, 

compared to the baseline sc
enario contained in this 
forecast.  Chapter 3 Member States   1. BELGIUM

forecas
t58 Economic activity decelerates strongly  The Belgian economy started losing momentum in 
the course of 2007. In particular, net exports 

became increasingly negativ
e as export growth 
gradually slowed down in line with the weakening 

of external demand, while the further increase in 

domestic demand led to a strong rise in imports. 

From the beginning of 2008, also domestic 

demand softened as a result of the sharp increase 

in inflation, related to the rise in commodity prices 

and, more recently, the financial crisis. The 

slowdown is expected to have intensified in the 

second half of the year and activity is projected to 

contract in the current and the next quarter. Annual 

growth is forecast to amount to 1.4% in 2008 and 

to further slow down to 0.1% in 2009, before 

picking up to about 0.9% in 2010. 
All components of demand under pressure Real disposable income is expected to broadly 

stabilise in 2008. Sustained employment growth 

and the automatic indexation of wages are forecast 

to compensate the impact of high inflation 

(projected at 4.7% in 20
08). Since the households' 
savings ratio is projected 
to decline in 2008 as a 
result of smoothing behaviour, consumption 

growth would still amount to
 1.4%. In 2009, lower 
inflation, the indexation of personal income tax 

brackets as well as a number of tax reductions 

would lead to an increase in real disposable 

income, in spite of negative employment growth. 

However, households incurred very important 

losses on their financial asset portfolio and there 

may be significant confidence effects stemming 

from the problems in the financial sector in the 
second half of 2008 an
d the projected rise in 
unemployment. This is expected to lead to a rise in 

the savings rate in 2009
 and, hence, a much 
smaller increase in consumption (0.4%) than in 

2008. In 2010, consumption is forecast to develop 

broadly in line with real disposable income as 

negative confidence and wealth effects would 

gradually fade out. 
Both for households and corporations, a 
contraction of investment is projected in 2009. The 

further tightening of credit conditions, partly 

through higher interest rates, as well as confidence 

effects are expected to have a negative impact. In 

the case of the corporate 
sector, the uncertainty 
regarding demand, the decrease in capacity 

utilisation and lower profits are also likely to be 

important drivers of lower investment. As these 

factors are forecast to gradually disappear towards 

the end of 2009, investment
 is expected to pick up 
in 2010. 
Export growth is projected to slow down in 2008 
and 2009 as a result of 
the marked cooling of 
external demand. In addition, Belgium is expected 

to continue to lose market share, also as a result of 

the stronger rise in wages in 2008. The gradual 

recovery of export mark
ets towards the end of 
2009 should lead to higher export growth in 2010. 

As a result of lacklustre final demand in 2009, 

import growth is projected to remain subdued and 

the contribution of net exports to GDP growth is 

forecast to be neutral, after a very negative 

contribution in 2008. In 2010, the net contribution 

is projected to become slightly negative again. 
Inflation and wage growth set to moderate Inflation is projected to turn out 1.2 p.p. higher 

than the euro area average 
in 2008, as a result of 
the higher weight of the energy component, in 

particular heating oil, but also because gas 

providers implemented large price hikes and 

transport and distribution tariffs for gas and 

electricity were raised substantially. As energy 

prices have recently decreased, inflation is 

expected to come down to 2.5% in 2009, on the 

back of important base effects, and 2.0% in 2010. 

As a result of the pass-through of higher energy 

prices and wages in a wide range of products and 

services, core inflation is projected to decline more 

gradually, but starting from a much lower level.

    59 Wage growth in 2008 is
 forecast to come out 
significantly higher than in the neighbouring 

countries as a result of their indexation to 

consumer prices (excluding 
i.a.
 motor fuels). For 
2009 and 2010, wage developments largely depend 

on the outcome of the upcoming bargaining 

rounds, but should, according to the law on 

competitiveness, be in line with those in Germany, 

France and the Netherlands.
 The projected increase 
of the unemployment rate from 7.1% in 2008 to 

8.7% in 2010 should help to contain wage growth. 
Marked deterioration of government balance For 2008, a deficit of 0.5% of GDP is projected, 

compared to a balanced
 budget target and 
following a deficit of 0.3% of GDP in 2007. While 

higher-than-expected inflation has a positive 

impact on personal income tax revenue, it also 

leads to higher expenditure. In particular, wage 

costs, health care expend
iture and social benefits 
are projected to grow st
rongly. The latter also 
results from measures to raise these benefits. In 

addition, the decline in corporate profits, especially 

of banks, is expected to put a drag on tax revenue. 

In 2009, the deficit is for
ecast to widen to 1.4% of 
GDP, compared to a balanced budget presented by 

the government. The differ
ence is explained by our 
more pessimistic macro-ec
onomic scenario and the 
exclusion of the measures 
which were, at the time 
of the forecast, not sufficiently specified. The 

impact of the economic deterioration on tax 

revenue is amplified by the indexation of personal 

income tax brackets (following high inflation in 

2008) and a number of m
easures to reduce the tax 
burden on labour. In addition, the projected rise in 

health care expenditure and social benefits as a 

result of population ageing, the lagged impact of 

high inflation and a number of new measures, 

contribute to higher spending. Finally, interest 

costs are set to rise strong
er than in the past as a 
result of the increase in 
government debt following 
the operations to stabilise the financial system. In 

2010, the deficit is projected to widen further as 

tax revenue growth is expected to remain subdued. 
For the forecast, and without prejudging the final 
statistical treatment to be approved by Eurostat, the 

technical assumption on the operations to stabilise 

Fortis, Dexia and Ethias is that they have no direct 

impact on the government balance. However, these 

measures have a debt-inc
reasing effect on the 
public debt by about 5% of GDP in 2008. Overall, 

the debt-to-GDP ratio would, after the initial 

increase in 2008, hover around 86% until 2010.

60 Buoyant growth to slow down Economic activity has so far remained robust and 
resilient to the deterioration in the global economic 

environment. Real GDP growth accelerated to 

slightly above 7% in the first half of 2008, driven 

in particular by buoyant domestic demand and 

very strong investment. Nevertheless, the 

worsening external conditions are expected to have 

an impact on Bulgaria. The exceptional degree of 

uncertainty on the international financial markets, 

a longer-lasting slowdown in global economic 

activity and high energy prices will inevitably 

affect domestic demand. Thus, real GDP growth is 

expected to decrease from 6½% in 2008 to 4½% in 

2009. However, there are major downside risks to 

this central scenario, esp
ecially for investment and 
private consumption. Growing risk aversion 

among foreign investors could result in a more 

significant deceleration in capital inflows and 

investment than assumed; 
rising interest rates and 
persistently high inflation may additionally 

dampen real disposable income and private 

consumption. 
Consumption and investment expected to 
decelerate In line with more moderate credit growth, rising 
interest rates and high inflation, as well as some 

deceleration in wage and employment growth, 

private consumption expenditure is expected to 

slow from 5% in 2008 to about 4½% in 2009. By 

contrast, public consumption expenditure growth 

will be further boosted by additional current 

spending in 2008, r
eaching around 4%.  
Driven by FDI inflows an
d surging credit growth, 
gross fixed capital formation will grow at about 

19% in 2008. Tighter global liquidity conditions, 

rising interest rate spreads and lower returns have 

already started affecting FDI and investment 

growth, most noticeably in
 the construction sector. 
As a result, the financing of the external deficit is 

no longer covered entirely by FDI, but involves 

accumulation of short-term
 liabilities. With these 
developments likely to persist, gross fixed capital 

formation growth is projected to slow sharply to 

9% in 2009 and to furt
her decelerate to 7% in 
2010. 
A modest reduction in external imbalances After a particularly weak performance in 2007, 

export growth seems to be recovering in 2008. 

However, as a result of lower external demand, 

exports will decelerate in
 2009, while a partial 
upward correction will follow in 2010, as 

industrial restructuring and the large foreign 

investment stock affect the country's export 

potential. At the same time, due to weaker 

domestic demand, import growth will decelerate 

from 9% in 2008 to around 6¼% in 2009. Thus, 

the negative contribution of net exports to growth 

will decrease. The trade deficit is expected to 

narrow only gradually in 2008-2010, inducing a 

small reduction of the very high current account 

deficit to about 21½% of GDP from a level of 

slightly over 24% of GDP in the second half of 

2008. This, together with capital transfers from the 

EU, should bring the economy's net borrowing 

position to slightly below 20% of GDP by 2010.  
Wage growth and inflation to subside from 
current peak  Employment growth remains strong at around 
3¼% in 2008. With the employment rate expected 

to reach almost 64% in 2008, increases in 2009-

2010 are expected to be of a smaller magnitude. 

The unemployment rate will maintain its 

downward trend, falling below 6% in 2009. 
Nominal wage growth has accelerated to above 
20% in 2008, compared w
ith 18% in 2007, largely 
as a result of tight labour market conditions. 

However, part of this wage growth might also be 

explained by the ongoing reduction in the grey 

economy triggered by successive cuts in income

   61 taxes and social contributions. Moreover, public 
sector wage developments have been in line with 

private sector increases.  Nominal wage growth is 

expected to remain high during the forecast period. 

However, it may decelerate as a result of weaker 

labour demand due to increased wage costs and the 

economy slowing down in the next two years. 

Labour productivity is expected to increase from 

around 3% in 2008 and 2009 to almost 3½% in 

2010, well below wage growth. As a result, 

nominal unit labour costs developments will 

continue to reflect a persistent deterioration of 

price competitiveness co
mpared with the EU 
average.  
HICP inflation has surged in the first half of 2008 
and is expected to average 12½% in 2008. The 

imminent global economic downturn and the 

resulting fall in domestic demand could potentially 

slow inflation to below 8% in 2009, followed by a 

further deceleration in 
2010. However, future 
developments in commodity prices and the 

capacity to contain sec
ond-round effects remain 
crucial to the inflation outlook.  
Budgetary position remains strong  At around 3¼% of GDP, the projected general 
government surplus is abov
e the official target of 
3% of GDP in 2008. The better-than-targeted 

surplus is mainly due to higher-than-expected 

revenue and a result of favourable growth 

composition, higher inflation and improved 

collection of direct taxes. On the expenditure side, 

however, there may be some slippages with regard 

to the official targets, as additional social and 

infrastructure spending has been approved.  
On the basis of the no-policy-change assumption 
the general government budget surplus will remain 

high at slightly below 3% of GDP in 2009 and 

2010. A small decline in the revenue-to-GDP ratio 

compared to 2008 is linked to a less tax intensive 

composition of growth, notably a projected 

slowdown in domestic demand. The overall 

expenditure ratio is expected to remain below 40% 

during the forecast period.  
In line with strong nominal GDP growth and 
continued high primary fiscal surpluses, general 

government gross debt is expected to drop well 

below 10% of GDP by the end of 2010.

62 Moderate growth while inflation still high The economic performance in the first half of 2008 
deteriorated as expected
. Compared to the 6½% 
growth in 2007, GDP growth eased below 5% in 

the first half of 2008 with net exports as the main 

contributor to growth. Domestic demand, the 

engine of growth in the 
last two years, slowed 
down considerably in the first half of 2008 due to 

several reasons and in particular the negative 

impact of the stabilisation package mainly the 

increase in the lower band of VAT dampening 

private consumption. The current surge in 

inflation, chiefly due to increases in regulated and 

commodity prices, eroded
 disposable income 
growth. Gross fixed capital formation growth 

decelerated on account of 
weaker domestic and 
external demand, feeding mainly in construction, 

machinery and transport eq
uipment. In spite of 
slowing external demand and the appreciation of 

the Czech koruna, export 
was still robust in the 
first half of 2008. On the contrary, import growth 

decelerated in the same pe
riod compared to 2007, 
affected by the relatively weaker domestic 

demand. The current account deficit has been 

modest so far. While the trade balance recorded a 

surplus for the third consecutive year, the income 

account registered a widening deficit reflecting 

wage and dividend transfers at foreign-owned 

companies. The cooling gl
obal economy as well as 
the expected weakening in domestic demand is 

likely to dampen future performance of the 

economy. The Czech financial sector which is 

dominated by banking has not been seriously 

affected so far by the global financial crisis.  

However, the main downsi
de risk to the forecast 
stems from the potentially tighter credit conditions 
which could impede investment growth to 
materialise. Weaker exports partly counterbalanced by 
revived consumption  Economic growth is foreseen to slow down to 
about 4.4% for the whole of 2008 and further to 

3.6% in 2009 before edging up again to 3.9% in 

2010. Domestic demand is set to recover in 2009, 

while the contribution from net export is likely to 

drop on account of a weak external environment 

and in particular the outlook for Germany. 

Consumer spending is expected to accelerate in 

2009, based on slowing inflation and the negative 

impact of the measures related to the Stabilisation 

Package fading away.  Additionally, rising 

employment and strong wage growth should 

support the recovery of private consumption. 
As the consequence of economic slowdown, 
employment growth is likely to moderate in the 

forecasting period. The unem
ployment rate is set 
to fall slightly in 2008 and to remain broadly 

stable. The nominal wage increase is anticipated to 

remain strong due to tight market conditions while 

real income growth of households, significantly 

eroded by the high inflation in 2008, should pick 

up again when inflation pressures ease down, 

supporting private consumption recovery in 2009-

2010. 
Investment growth is expected to pick up slightly 
in 2009 and 2010 supported by EU funds, FDI and 

the lower corporate tax rate. While export growth 

is anticipated to moderate visibly under the 

influence of weaker exte
rnal demand in 2009 and 
the strong currency it is expected to pick up 

slightly afterwards, supported by new export-

oriented investments and the likely better 

economic global outlook at 
the end of the forecast 
horizon. The trade balance should remain in 

surplus in 2009 and 2010.  
Inflationary pressures anticipated to ease Inflation escalated further in
 the first half of 2008, 
fuelled by a range of administrative measures, 

including the increase in the lower VAT rate from 

5 to 9%, the introduction of environmental taxes 

effective from January 2008, a further rise in 

excise duty and hikes in regulated prices. The

    63 surge in commodity prices has boosted inflation 
additionally, while the appreciation of the currency 

has partly helped curbing imported inflation. 

While inflation is expected to remain high, at 

about 6.5% for 2008, it is anticipated to decelerate 

in 2009 and 2010. The gradual decline in inflation 

should be supported by moderate domestic demand 

and a strong currency. High nominal wage growth 

could lead to second round effects. 
Mixed pressure on public finances The 2007 general government deficit of -1% of 

GDP was significantly lower-than-anticipated. The 

better outturn was mainly due to continued strong 

growth, falling unemployment, and slower growth 

in government investment. A host of fiscal 

measures came into effect
 in 2008. Revenue from 
individual taxation will be affected by the 

introduction of a ‚flat-tax™ on personal income. On 

the other hand, the increase in the rate of the lower 

VAT band from five to nine per cent should 

significantly raise revenue from indirect taxation, 

even in the context of overall moderate private 

consumption, given that the lower band applies 

mainly to essential goods. On the expenditure side, 

growth in social expenditure should slow by a 

range of measures to reduce social and welfare 
benefits, as well as a consequence of continued 
low unemployment. In addition, the introduction of 

health charges on consultations, hospitalisation, 

and basic medicines should make an annual 

budgetary saving in the region of ¼% of GDP. The 

outturn of the central budget for the first half of 

2008 has been consistent with the government™s 

budgetary plans. On the basis that budgeted 

expenditure will remain on track for the rest of the 

year, and that government investment will regain 

momentum, the forecast pred
icts that, despite the 
slow down, the government deficit will remain 

broadly contained at -1.2% of GDP in 2008. In 

2009 and 2010, the deficit is forecast to slightly 

widen, due mainly to weakening growth. The wide 

range of tax changes implemented in 2008 and 

2009 places a degree of uncertainty over revenues. 

Expenditure predictions are also complicated by 

the use of reserve funds, in which government 

departments roll over spending allocations, which 

accumulated to over 2½ of GDP at the beginning 

of 2008. The structural deficit is set to slightly 

improve to -1½% of GDP by 2010. The 

government debt ratio is predicted to continue 

falling to below 26½% of GDP in 2010.

64 Housing market dragging down activity The turn of the Danish bus
iness cycle set in earlier 
than in other Member States and was initially 

driven by domestic conditions. In the course of 

2007 the annual GDP growth rate more than 

halved from 3.7% to 1.7%, thus dropping below 

potential. Hopes were high for a controlled slow-

down of activity, avoiding potential overheating 

effects from capacity co
nstraints and labour 
shortages. A brief spell of technical recession 

around the turn of the year 
gave a clear signal that 
the slow-down had set in, although temporary 

factors were also at pl
ay. The second quarter 
brought some respite, but growth was largely 

driven by developments in inventories. 
With the successive worsening of financial market 
conditions, a soft landing of the housing market 

appears less likely. Declining house prices have 

become a more general tre
nd rather than a regional 
phenomenon, and the price of one-family homes 

has now dropped some 4% from the peak in 2007. 

Despite significant cuts in asking prices, turnover 

remains low and the number of houses for sale is 

increasing. The number of forced sales has reached 

the pre-housing-boom level, which, while not 

being high compared to de
velopments in the early 
1990s, is clearly above 
the average of the past 
decade. The outlook for th
e housing market has 
turned more sombre with adverse developments in 

financing conditions. The correction foreseen is 

thus more rapid than was previously expected, 

bringing real house price developments closer in 

line with fundamentals. The extent of the housing 

market correction remains 
a downside risk to the 
forecast given the uncertainties related to financing 
conditions and estimates of current overvaluation. 
The labour market will follow Historically, house prices have often moved in 
parallel with labour market developments. Over 

the summer, unemployment reached a record low 

compared with the past 30 
years. In line with past 
experiences, the unemployment rate is expected to 

increase from the second half of 2008 throughout 

the forecast period, albeit 
somewhat mitigated by a 
shrinking labour force and a net reduction in 

frontier workers. 
The combination of high employment and low 
economic growth in 2007-2008 reflects very weak 

productivity developments, in part possibly due to 

labour hoarding effects. Productivity growth is 

now expected to pick up as the unemployment gap 

is closing. 
Households hold up, government steps in More generally, the financial turmoil has brought 

tighter credit conditions and troublesome 

confidence effects to th
e Danish economy. The 
coinciding negative dynamics in real and financial 

assets markets might put a significant drag on 

investment activity over the forecast period. 

Domestic demand is foreseen to slump in 2009 due 

to a sharp drop in residential construction, in 

particular, but also a weakening of other 

investment components and private consumption.  
Negative wealth effects are likely to discourage 
private consumers. On the other hand, households' 

real disposable income will benefit from lower 

taxes in 2009 and 2010, as well as substantial real 

wage increases and a relatively resilient labour 

market. The savings rate is expected to pick up, in 

part due to the reintroduction of the ﬁspecial 

pensions contributionﬂ, a personal compulsory 

savings scheme. Public consumption is foreseen to 

catch up in the second half of 2008 to approach the 

planned level of expenditure despite the late 

adoption of the budget in April and public sector 

strikes. For the coming years, general government 

is expected to take up some of the beginning slack 

in the economy through increasing consumption 

expenditure and investment.

   65 External balance to improve despite cost 
pressure In line with global develo
pments, inflation reached 
a peak of 4.8% in August, and is expected to 

recede to trend over the fo
recast period as energy 
and commodity prices dr
op. Meanwhile, domestic 
inflationary pressure is foreseen to persist as 

higher labour costs feed through. After a spell of 

strikes in the spring of 2008, public sector wage 

negotiations resulted in wage increases of nearly 

13% over three years. 
Private sector wages, 
negotiated the year before, are also foreseen to 

grow at a high pace. 
Despite weak prospects for price competitiveness, 
the growth contribution from the external balance 

is expected to develop from negative to positive 

over the forecast period. This is mainly due to 

subdued import growth reflecting the weakening of 

domestic demand. Exports could, however, pick up 

as capacity constraints ease. Agricultural exports 

are also expected to benefit from lower input 

prices. The strong services
 balance should hold up, 
although both exports and 
imports are foreseen to 
increase more slowly over the period as the growth 

in shipping activity subs
ides. Overall, however, 
exports fail to keep up with the import growth of 
trading partners, indicating a loss of market shares.  
Public finance remain in surplus Public finances have benefited from the strong 
labour market and high oil prices. As energy prices 

as well as the extraction of oil and gas are foreseen 

to decline, revenue is ex
pected to follow. Revenue 
is also quite sensitive to developments in financial 

asset prices. Deteriorating cyclical conditions and 

transitory revenue effects 
imply that the projected 
headline surplus of 3% of GDP for 2008 is 

foreseen to diminish gradually to ½% of GDP in 

2010. In line with the government proposal, the 

ﬁspecial pension contributionﬂ is assumed to be 

reintroduced in 2010, causing income tax revenue 

to drop by some ¼% of GDP because such 

contributions are tax deductible. Continued budget 

surpluses are envisaged to contribute to a further 

reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio to around 20% 

of GDP in 2010.

t66 Marked deceleration of growth in 2008 After an exceptionally strong first quarter Œ largely 
thanks to favourable weather conditions boosting 

construction activity Œ real
 GDP contracted during 
spring. While this relapse was largely a technical 

correction following the strong growth at the 

beginning of the year, the worsening of the global 

economic environment has also clearly taken its 

toll. The slowdown of economic activity in key 

trading partners and a stronger euro have led to an 

abrupt deceleration of expo
rt growth. At the same 
time, high food and energy prices have weighed 

heavily on private cons
umption. As a result, 
household consumption is expected to decrease for 

a second year in a row. Mo
reover, the deterioration 
in the economic ou
tlook Œ as reflected by rapidly 
weakening business confidence indicators Œ is also 

affecting investment plans and will drag down 

gross fixed capital formation. Therefore, real GDP 

is expected to contract furt
her in the second half of 
the year, even though for 
the year as a whole real 
GDP growth will remain at around 1¾%. 
Weaker exports and investment in 2009 The global financial crisis and adjustments in the 

housing sector in a number of countries have 

triggered a sharp deceleration of economic activity 

both inside and outside the EU. As a heavily 

export-oriented economy, Germany will be 

directly affected by this
 global downturn. Export 
growth is expected to decrease from 4½% in 2008 

to around just 1% in 2009. While exports to some 

emerging markets may still hold up relatively well, 

this will be insufficient to compensate for the 
downturn in other key trading partners. 
The weakened outlook for economic activity and 
exports together with tighter financing conditions 

in the wake of the financial crisis will dampen 

investment growth, despite the relatively sound 

financial position of German companies. 

Investment in equipment in particular will contract 

significantly in 2009, while construction 

investment may be slightly less affected, thanks 

notably to higher public investment in 

infrastructure. Altogether, gross fixed capital 

formation is thus expected to decrease by around 

1¾% in 2009. 
Subdued recovery of private consumption High wage growth and strong employment 

creation in recent years should have laid the basis 

for a recovery of private consumption after more 

than five years of stagnation. However, the 

pronounced pick-up in inflation in 2008 has 

reduced real disposable incomes and weakened 

consumer confidence, lead
ing to another year of 
negative growth in private consumption. On the 

back of falling inflation, high wage increases and a 

still fairly robust labour market, private 

consumption is set to expand in both 2009 and 

2010. Nevertheless, the fallout from the global 

financial crisis and the downturn in consumer 

confidence imply a rather moderate recovery with 

annual growth rates expected to hover around ½% 

in both years. In combination with the weaker 

outlook for exports and investments, real GDP 

growth is therefore likely to stagnate in 2009. 
Member States, Germany 
  67 Sounder fundamentals may facilitate recovery Thanks to improved m
acroeconomic conditions 
Germany should be well placed for a relatively 

broad-based economic recovery once the negative 

impact of the global down
turn recedes. As a result 
of very moderate wage increases in recent years, 

Germany has gained in price competitiveness. 

Temporarily higher wage growth over the forecast 

period will not substantially change this situation. 

German exports can therefor
e be expected to pick 
up when the world economy starts to rebound from 

the current downturn. In this case, the sound 

financial position of German companies and 

comparatively low reliance on outside financing 

should also be conducive 
to a recovery of gross 
fixed capital formation. Finally, structural 

improvements in the labour market and the 

associated reduction in unemployment should help 

underpin consumption. Hence, a certain recovery 

with real GDP growth of around 1% can be 

expected for 2010, provided that the main negative 

effects of the global financial crisis have been 

overcome by then. 
Labour market before the downturn Employment growth has been buoyant in recent 

years, reflecting not only
 the cyclical upswing of 
economic activity, but also structural 

improvements following a 
series of labour market 
reforms. The unemployment rate has fallen from 

over 10% in 2005 to around 7½% in 2008. The 

economic slowdown in 2008 and 2009 will leave 

its mark on the labour market with temporarily 

higher unemployment and a decline in 

employment. However, in 2010 the labour market 

is set to recover somewhat as the economic 

situation improves. 
Inflation gradually receding despite wage 
pressures Wage growth has picked up during 2008 due to 
strong job creation and also in compensation for 

very moderate wage increases in recent years. This 

trend will continue in 2009 despite the worsening 

of the economic situation, when wage growth is 

expected to peak at around 3%. With productivity 

growth decreasing slightly, nominal labour costs 

would increase noticeably st
ronger than in recent 
years, by around 2¾% in 2009 and 1½% in 2010. 
Due to higher wage grow
th and lagged effects 
from high energy and food prices, core inflation is 

expected to increase temporarily. However, as the 
impact of recent energy and food price hikes is 
petering out, headline inflation is set to gradually 

fall to below 2% in 2010 on the back of favourable 

base effects and falling oil prices. 
Strong tax revenues help to balance the 
budget in 2008 The general government budget is estimated to be 
in balance in 2008. 
The improvement can 
principally be ascribed to a rise in revenue, in 

particular from direct 
taxes, reflecting positive 
developments on the labour market. Tax revenues 

have also benefited from stronger wage increases. 

Importantly, the negative short-run effects of the 

company tax reform have not materialised to the 

extent expected. Nevertheless, the budget has been 

burdened by a reduction of the contribution rate to 

unemployment insurance.
 The increase in the 
contribution to long-term care insurance has served 

in turn to fund additional spending.  
On the expenditure side, the further decline in the 
jobless rate has led to a reduction in spending on 

unemployment benefits. Still, an additional burden 

to the budget has resulted from the ad-hoc upward 

adjustment of the retirement benefits which went 

beyond the legislation in force since the 2004 

pension reform. In addition, public sector wages 

have been raised at all levels of the government.  
Relative resilience in times of economic 
slowdown Despite the marked economic slowdown, 
Germany's public finances are expected to remain 

relatively resilient in 2009. The general 

government balance is projected to relapse into a 

slight deficit of 0.2% of GDP. Tax revenue is 

likely to benefit from a still fairly robust labour 

market and expected substantial wage increases. 

However, higher wages are likely to dampen 

company profits, and hence profit-related taxes. 

The most significant budg
etary measures are the 
increase in the rate of contributions to health-care 

insurance (from 14.9% to 15.5%) and a further 

reduction of the contribution rate to unemployment 

insurance (from 3.3% to 2.8%). 
 Total government spending will increase by 0.5 
pp. of GDP on the back of additional expenditure 

in the health-care sector, in
creases in public sector 
wages and higher social spending (e.g. childcare 

and household allowances).

    68 In 2010, the general government balance is 
projected to recede into a deficit of 0.5% of GDP. 

The key budgetary measure 
is the increase in the 
contribution rate to unemployment insurance (from 

2.8% to 3.0% as of mid-year). On the no-policy-

change assumption, other social contribution rates 

are forecast to remain unchanged. The budget is 

likely to be burdened by the tax deductibility of 

health-care insurance contributions to the order of 

around 0.3% of GDP. Finally, changes introduced 

in 2008 to adjust upwards the retirement benefits 

are expected to be reversed.  
Moreover, both the 2008 and 2009 budgets will be 
burdened by the retroactive tax reimbursements 

resulting from the ruling of the European Court of 

Justice (ECJ) on taxation of foreign dividend 

income (with the total impact estimated at 0.2% of 

GDP). In 2009, a temporary budget relief of 

around 0.1% of GDP is expected from a reduction 

in Germany's contributions to the EU budget based 

on the Council decisions on own resources for the 

EU budget 2007-2013.  
German public finances are also likely to be 
burdened by the rescue plan granted to troubled 

banks which are assumed to have a direct impact 

on the debt (
1). While their impact in 2008 on the 
deficit remains still limited (0.06% of GDP), the 
effect on the debt was estimated at the time of the 

forecast at 1.6% of GDP. Nevertheless, the 

government debt ratio is projected to fall from 

65% of GDP in 2007 to 62% of GDP by 2010.  
The uncertainty surrounding the financial crisis 
may become a risk to Germany's public finances in 

the medium-term. In addition to the above 

mentioned direct effects, the budget might be 

affected indirectly through tax revenue losses, in 

particular from prof
it-related taxes. 
                                                          
 (1) The budgetary effects of the financial market stabilisation 
package from Oct. 2008 depend on the degree and timing 
of its utilisation which was unknown at the time of the 

forecast. Therefore, on the no-
policy-change basis, they 
have not been included in the budgetary projection.

69 Domestic demand contracts sharply  The deceleration of the Estonian economy, which 
began in the second half of 2007, turned into a 

steep decline in the first half of 2008, with two 

consecutive quarters of
 negative growth. The 
decline in domestic demand was largely caused by 

subsiding credit growth, as financing conditions 

became less attractive due to
 higher retail interest 
rates and more cautious lending practices by 

banks. Very low confidence levels among both 

consumers and businesses contributed to falling 

private consumption and a 
decline in investment. 
Consumers were particularly affected by very high 

inflation, which remained at double-digit levels 

from the beginning of 2008. In anticipation of 

lower real disposable 
income and fears about 
employment prospects, households reduced 

spending and increased precautionary saving. 

Business confidence plunged, largely in response 

to a perceived lack of demand.  
The composition of GDP growth which 
characterised the peak years of the economic cycle, 

led by private consumption and construction 

investment, has given way since the beginning of 

2008 to a negative contribution of domestic 

demand and (through a sharp contraction in 

imports) a positive contribution of net exports. 

Both exports and imports were affected by a 

decline in transit-type trade, while in some 

merchandise categories export volumes continue to 

increase. Labour market is starting to adjust Initially the labour market has been relatively slow 
to react to changes in domestic demand. 
Unemployment remained at historical low levels in 

the first half of 2008 and wage increases have 

continued to exceed productivity increases 

significantly.  
Signs of adjustment in the labour market have 
become clearer in the seco
nd half of 2008 with 
wage growth moderating and the number of 

unemployed increasing. The adjustment is 

expected to continue with a decline in employment 

and wage growth through
out the whole forecast 
period. 
Unwinding imbalances A reversal of the cycle is bringing about an 

unwinding of the imbalances that have been 

accumulated over the years of rapid growth. This 

is already clearly visible 
in the external balance, 
which narrowed to near 10% of GDP in the first 

half of 2008, compared with 17% in 2007. The 

most positive impact is expected to come from an 

improvement in the merchandise trade balance and 

to a lesser extent from the growing current and 

capital transfers, includin
g those related to EU 
funds. However, no substantial improvement is 

expected in the primary income balance. The 

structure of Estonian gross liabilities, where FDI 

represents almost half, should help to limit the 

deterioration of the in
come account through a 
reduction in profits made in Estonia. At the same 

time, net income paid on other investments is 

showing a steady increase, which is expected to 

continue over the forecast period. 
HICP headline inflation is likewise set to slow 
substantially, due to lower world commodity 

prices and the fading impact of large excise tax 

increases in January and July 2008, while core 

inflation is expected to fall along with domestic 

demand pressures. Nevertheless, a deterioration in 

cost competitiveness indicators is expected to 

abate only gradually. 
Can a shift to tradeables save the day? The credit-expansion-driven boom of recent years 

resulted in a rapid expansion of the non-tradeable 

sectors, in particular those related to real estate. To 

support further growth in a changed environment, 

a shift towards the tradeabl
es sector and external

  70 demand will be necessary. Restructuring needs are 
also dictated by rapid 
rises in labour costs and 
energy prices. However, while the boom years 

were associated with very supportive financial 

conditions, the needed restructuring will now have 

to take place in a much less accommodative 

environment. Coupled with a dim outlook for 

external demand, this implies a more prolonged 

readjustment path. 
Subdued private consumption and falling 
investments are expected to bring negative growth 

rates in both 2008 and 2009, with a moderate 

recovery in 2010. Any recovery in private 

consumption is unlikely to
 take place before the 
second half of 2009, when inflation is expected to 

abate and indexation of social benefits reinforces 

consumer confidence. Pros
pects of a recovery in 
investment activity are subject to considerable 

uncertainty, although positive effects are expected 

from the sizeable public sector investments related 

to the absorption of EU structural funds. 
Deteriorating public finances The decline in economic activity has led to a 

deterioration in public finances in 2008. Despite 

the mid-year adoption of a supplementary budget 
that lowered expenditure targets, a deficit of 1½% 
of GDP is expected for th
e year as a whole. The 
draft 2009 budget, adopted by the government in 

September, includes a postponement by a year of 

previously planned tax cuts and corporate income 

tax reform, coupled with some other revenue-

increasing measures and restricted expenditure 

growth. While these measures will to some extent 

mitigate the worsening outlook for public finances, 

this nevertheless appears insufficient to avoid a 

further deterioration of the headline balance in 

2009 and, based on the no-policy-change 

assumption, in 2010. 
Deficits over the whole forecast period are 
projected to increase the 
debt to GDP ratio from 
3.5% in 2007 to around 6% by the end of 2010. It 

is assumed that part of the deficit will be financed 

by running off assets accumulated during the 

earlier period of high growth and fiscal surpluses.

71 A sharp drop in GDP in 2008 In the first half of 2008, real GDP declined by 1% 
year-on-year. A further easing is projected in the 

second half, leading to a drop in real GDP by some 

1½% for the year as a 
whole. The recession 
reflects the sharp adjustment in the housing market 

which has spread to the wider economy and has 

been amplified by the financial crisis and lower 

growth prospects in the main trading partners (euro 

area, US and UK). Ther
e is a significant and 
broad-based decline in inve
stment. In face of soft 
retail sales, private consumption is set to decline 

by ¼%, even assuming more resilient consumption 

of services. On the external side, the volume growth of 
merchandise exports is expected to moderate 

compared to 2007, with so
me sectors (in particular 
chemicals) still posting a strong performance. 

Exports of services are expected to grow less 

rapidly, reflecting inter alia reduced activity in the 

financial sector. Merchandise imports are forecast 

to decline by 7% in 2008, owing to reduced 

domestic demand and weaker exports, while 

services imports are projected to record positive 

growth with business services and royalties 

remaining relatively dynamic. Net exports are thus 

forecast to make a positiv
e contribution to growth, 
providing a partial offset to the strongly negative 

contribution from domestic demand. 
GDP is projected to fall not only in real but also in 
nominal terms (by 2¼%). The GDP deflator 

declines reflecting significantly negative terms of 

trade as well as falling property prices. 
Recovery may start from end-2009 The economy is expected to
 shrink also in 2009, 
by almost 1%, with only a gradual pick-up in 

activity from the final quarter, leading to positive 

growth of some 2½% in 2010. The growth profile 

is driven to a large extent by a continued poor 

performance of investment. Residential housing 

construction is expected to remain below its 

estimated long-term equilibrium level in 2009 and 

2010. The decline in other construction in 2009 

reflects weak activity in 
the commercial property 
sector and a downward revision of government 

capital expenditure plans in the budget for 2009. 

Private consumption is expected to remain positive 

but weak in 2009 in view of limited wage growth 

and a soft labour market. A turnaround in these 

two factors together with low inflation should 

produce a rebound in 2010. 
The fall in domestic demand in 2009 is expected to 
be partly compensated by a positive contribution 

from net exports to GDP. However, this reflects a 

further marked decrease in imports (on the back of 

declining domestic demand) rather than a strong 

performance of exports, as exports growth remains 

subdued. In 2010, domestic demand leads the 

recovery, with the contribution from net exports 

set to diminish in view of the competitiveness 

losses sustained in recent years. The trend shift 

within exports from goods to services is expected 

to continue on the forecast horizon. 
The external deficit will decrease in light of the 
cyclical downturn of the economy and the 

expected improvement in the terms of trade.  
Job losses and rising unemployment Employment gains slowed significantly in the first 

half of 2008. A further deceleration is expected in 

the second half, resulting in a slight decrease for 

the year as a whole. A further, more marked 

decline is projected for 2009, followed by a pick-

up in employment in 2010. The job losses in 2008-

09 reflect in particular a sharp contraction in 

construction and the poor performance in 

manufacturing together with less dynamic services 

sector employment than in
 recent years. Although 
employment is projected 
to decline, labour 
productivity would decline as well in 2008 and 

post a small increase in 
2009, reflecting labour

    72 hoarding. The recession is 
expected to slow inward 
migration so that labour force growth would be 

more subdued than in recen
t years. This mitigates 
the rise in the unemployment rate, which would 

reach some 6% in 2008
 and 7½% in 2009-10. 
Growth in compensation per employee is expected 
to moderate from 3½% in 2008 to 2¼% in 2009, 

reflecting weak labour market conditions and the 

national wage agreement, which sets low pay 

increases coupled with a pay pause. A likewise 

limited increase of 2¾% 
is expected in 2010. 
Energy and food prices 
were the main factors 
behind the rising trend in HICP inflation until June 

2008. Inflation is 
decelerating in the second half of 
2008, reflecting also moderating service inflation 

and declining prices fo
r non-energy industrial 
goods. In view of the negative output gap and 

subdued wage increases, inflation is projected to 

ease from 3.3% in 2008 to 2.1% in 2009 and 1.8% 

in 2010. 
Large deficits expected over forecast horizon The general government deficit is estimated at 

5.5% of GDP, compared to a stability programme 

target of 0.9%. The marked deterioration owes 
largely to a massive tax undershoot linked not only 
with the correction in the property market but also 

reflecting the wider recession. Expenditure 

overruns play a much smaller role. 
The deficit is projected to widen to 6¾% of GDP 
in 2009, worse than targeted (6.5%), reflecting the 

somewhat worse economic outlook and some 

limited slippages in the implementation of the 

budget. The budget includes several revenue-

enhancing measures, such as an income levy and 

indirect tax hikes as well as a one-off improvement 

of 0.3% of GDP from advancing tax payment 

dates. On the expenditure side, it incorporates a 

social welfare package and much weaker 

expenditure growth (both current and capital) than 

in recent years. The deficit is projected to reach 

7¼% of GDP in 2010 on a no-policy change basis. 
With a sizable increase in
 the primary deficit, 
government debt is projected to almost double 

over the forecast horizon, from below 25% of GDP 

in 2007 to some 46% in 2010. Irish public finances 

could also be affected by the September 2008 

financial rescue package but in the absence of 

information on the degree and timing of its 

utilisation the forecast 
includes no impact.

t73 Economic activity slows in 2008  Economic growth decelerated to just above 3½% 
in the first half of 2008. Weakening domestic 

demand was the main reason behind the recorded 

slowdown, which is expected to continue in the 

second half of the year. In spite of this, economic 

activity is estimated to continue to grow at well 

above the euro area average 
at around 3% in 2008, 
on the back of resilient private consumption. 
Although still benefiting from continued 
employment and wage growth, private 

consumption growth is expected to slow to 2½%, 

in a context of deteriorating confidence and 

financial uncertainty. Investment is expected to 

decelerate on the back of the housing sector 

weakening, which in contrast to the surge in the 

recent past will bring ab
out a contraction of 
construction activity, especially dwellings. After 

recording strong growth in the first half of 2008, 

corporate investment in turn
, is expected to decline 
in the second half. Public consumption growth is 

expected to decelerate 
from the unusually high 
levels of last year and return to long term trends. In 

spite of the gradual erosion of competitiveness, a 

deteriorated external environment and slowing 

economic activity 
in the euro area, exports appear 
to be growing strongly, mainly towards extra-EU 

trading partners. Imports on the other hand are 

foreseen to slow in line with domestic demand. 
External imbalances persist while the outlook 
deteriorates Economic growth is expected to decelerate further 
to 2½% over the forecast ho
rizon, continuing to be 
exclusively driven by domestic demand. In a 
context of uncertainty in the global financial and 

capital markets, tightening credit conditions would 

induce a further slowdown in private consumption, 

though this is expected to show signs of recovery 

by the second half of 2010. Government 

consumption is expected to grow in line with GDP, 

while public investment is projected to rebound in 

2009, largely reflecting an 
accelerating pace in the 
implementation of the Community Structural 

Funds. Credit conditions will also hinder 

investment in equipment, which is projected to 

decelerate in 2009, in para
llel with a stagnation of 
dwellings. Both sectors might recover somewhat 

by the end of the forecast period. As a result, the 

contribution of domestic demand is projected to 

increase until 2010.  
On the external side, rising unit labour costs above 
the euro area average, will weigh on 

competitiveness and somewhat hinder growth in 

exports of goods. However, following last years' 

rebound resulting from positive developments in 

transportation and tourism, 
exports of services are 
expected to decelerate back
 to historical trends. 
Although a more moderate growth of imports is 

foreseen, in line with domestic demand, the overall 

slowdown in exports will result in a negative 

contribution to GDP growth from the external 

sector. Consistent with these developments, the 

current account balance would continue to increase 

to above 15% of GDP by 2010, still financed 

through portfolio investment, while net foreign 

direct investment inflows are marginal. 
Steady deterioration of competitiveness The deceleration of econom
ic activity will lead to 
lower growth in job creation, at around 1%, until 

2010. The decline in unemployment observed in 

recent years is accordingly 
expected to end and the 
unemployment rate would increase. Nominal 

wages in turn would rise faster than productivity, 

thus pushing unit labour costs growth clearly 

above those of the euro
 area over the forecast 
horizon, which will further worsen the country™s 

competitive position, especially in the goods 

sector.  Following the developments in oil and commodity 
markets, HICP inflation accelerated in the first 3 

quarters of 2008 and is projected at 4.4%.

   74 Inflationary pressures are 
expected to ease in 2009 
and 2010, reflecting the expected stabilisation of 

oil prices.  
Public finances remain fragile The shortcomings as regards the Greek public 

finance statistics remain a recurrent issue. The 

general government deficit for 2007 has been 

revised upwards from 2.8% to 3.5% of GDP (
2).  For 2008, the official public
 deficit target has been 
revised by ¾ p.p. of GDP, compared with the 

initial budgetary target of 1.6% of GDP. This 

deviation reflects expenditure overruns of 1 p.p. of 

GDP and revenue shortfalls of ½ p.p. of GDP, 

partially compensated by a series of measures 

implemented in September. This extraordinary 

package consisted of both revenue enhancing and 

public consumption cutting measures. The 

budgetary impact of this 
package is projected at 
some ¾ p.p. of GDP, including one-off revenues of 

½ p.p. of GDP. On this basis, the government 

deficit is expected to attain 2½% of GDP. The 

structural balance will improve by some ½ p.p. of 

GDP.  
The 2009 draft budget targets a deficit of 1.8% of 
GDP, including ¾ p.p. of GDP deficit-reducing 
one-offs. Total revenues are budgeted to rise by 

around ¾ p.p. of GDP, mainly through higher 

direct and indirect tax revenues. Total expenditures 

in turn would also increas
e by almost ¼ p.p. of 
GDP, mostly due to higher
 social transfers. On 
account of a less favourable
 growth scenario and a 
more prudent assessment of revenue enhancing 

discretionary measures, which is consistent with 

past outcomes, the Commission services project a 

deficit of 2¼% of GD
P. Measured by the 
cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-offs, the 

structural balance would improve by some ¼ p.p. 

in 2009. Under the customary unchanged policy 

assumption, the 2010 deficit is projected close to 

3% of GDP.  
The general government debt ratio is projected to 
decrease slightly to 92% of GDP by 2010, 

compared with 93½ 
of GDP in 2008.

75 The end of a long expansionary phase The outstanding economic performance of Spain 
since the mid-nineties came to an end in 2008. The 

long expansion of economic activity can be 

broadly attributed to a combination of positive 

shocks, such as a sustained credit expansion and 

strong immigration, together with sound choices in 

monetary and fiscal policies in the framework of 

the accession to the monetary union.  
Significant imbalances emerged however during 
the expansionary phase: (i) an oversized housing 

sector, (ii) a growing curr
ent account deficit, (iii) a 
high indebtedness of private agents, households 

and firms, and (iv) a persistent inflation differential 

with the euro area which, 
coupled with insufficient 
productivity growth, has hurt the competitiveness 

of the Spanish economy.  
Sharp deceleration in 2008 After having posted a remarkable GDP growth rate 

of 3.7% in 2007, economic activity rapidly 

decelerated in 2008, and is
 expected to record an 
average growth rate of slightly below 1½% for the 

year as a whole, with negative quarterly growth 

rates during the second half of the year.  
Domestic demand started to show some signs of 
fatigue already during the first half of 2007, but the 

situation worsened substantially due to the housing 

sector adjustment, worsening consumer 

confidence, higher oil and food prices, and tighter 

credit conditions associated with the financial 

crisis. Specifically, investment in dwellings might 

decline by around 9½%. Additionally, investment 
in equipment, which had remained resilient and 
grew at two-digit levels in 2007, might stagnate in 

2008. For the year as a whole, domestic demand is 

expected to contribute about ¾ percentage point to 

GDP growth.  
Exports could increase by 3½%, on the basis of a 
relatively good performa
nce when compared to 
domestic demand, explained by efforts of domestic 

manufacturing exporters to 
keep market shares by 
reducing mark-ups. Due to the recorded slowdown 

in consumption, imports might increase by 1¼%, 

compared with more than 6¼% in 2007. As a 

result, the positive growth contribution of net 

exports could attain 0.5 pp. in 2008, compared to a 

negative contribution of 0.8 pp. in 2007. 
Private consumption contracts in 2009 In 2009, GDP growth is 
expected to decline by 
around ¼% on the back 
of a negative carryover, 
lower private consumption and the ongoing 

contraction of housing and equipment investment, 

compensated in part with public consumption and 

exports.  
Private consumption should develop in line with 
the outlook for disposable income and 

employment. Specifically, employment contraction 

would put pressure on labour income; and the 

negative prospects of net wealth effects and 

increasing interest payments are expected to weigh 

negatively on real dispos
able income, which might 
broadly stagnate, largely explaining why private 

consumption is unlikely to take off next year. 

Moreover, access to consumer credit, which could 

have cushioned the negative effects of real 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  76 disposable income on private consumption, might 
be more difficult than in the past due to high 

household indebtedness and uncertainties in 

financial markets. The household saving rate 

should reverse its previous declining trend and 

slightly increase over the forecast horizon. 

Investment in dwellings is projected to decline by 

around 18%. Investment in equipment is also 

expected to decline in 2009. All in all, fixed capital 

formation could contract by 5¾%. Overall, 

domestic demand is projected to contribute -1¾ 

percentage points to GDP growth in 2009. 
Following exporters' effo
rts to keep or even 
slightly expand market shares, export growth is 

forecast at around 2¼%, s
lightly above world trade 
growth. Consistent with private consumption 

developments, imports should decline by 2½% in 

real terms, increasing the positive contribution of 

net exports to GDP growth to 1½ percentage point 

of GDP. 
Uncertainties prevail in 2010 GDP is projected to expand in 2010 by ½%. 

Private consumption should break out of negative 

territory on the basis of slightly better prospects for 

real disposable income, which could benefit from a 

timid recovery of employment creation. All in all, 

consumption is expected 
to increase by a meagre 
half of one percentage point. The ongoing 

contraction in housing investment should 

decelerate but is still projected to amount to around 

10% for the year as a whole. Overall, the 

contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth 

will post a virtual zero.  
On the back of the mild recovery in private 
consumption, it is envisaged that the positive 

contribution of net exports will decline to half a 

percentage point on the basis of import growth by 

around 1%. Exports are projected to accelerate 

slightly, allowing to broadly keep its market 

shares.  
External imbalances persist The deficit in trade of 
goods and services is 
forecast to decline from 6½
% of GDP in 2008 to 
4¼% in 2010. However, this may be insufficient as 

to unwind significantly the external imbalances: 

the negative balance of primary income, caused by 

the growing external debt
 and projected to reach 
4% of GDP by the end of the forecast period, is 

expected to largely offset
 the improvement of the 
trade balance. The balance of current transfers, 
mainly immigrants' remittances, is forecast to slow 

and post a deficit of about 1% of GDP over the 

forecast horizon. All in 
all, the current account 
deficit is expected to record a slight improvement 

of two percentage points, from around 10% of 

GDP in 2008 to slightly above 8% in 2010.  
On a sectoral basis, th
e improvement in private 
individuals' balance position will be in part offset 

by the worsening of the public sector financial 

position, which will shift from a comfortable net 

lender position to a net borrower already in 2008. 
Risks are on the downside Risks to this baseline scenario seem to be tilted 

towards the downside. A 
sharper-than-expected 
adjustment of the housing sector and further 

tightening of credit conditions could weigh on 

private consumption and investment activity more 

than projected above.   
Labour market, costs and prices  Employment prospects reflect the picture for 
economic activity in gene
ral. Specifically, job 
creation (in full-time equivalents) is expected to 

reverse in 2008, from +3% in 2007 to -¼%.  
For the rest of the forecast period, employment 
growth is expected to be negative as a result of 

weakening activity. Total jobs are set to be lost at 

around 2% and 1% in 2009 and 2010, respectively. 

Although the domestic labour force is on a 

declining path, still relatively strong migrant 

inflows could keep it growing above 1% over the 

forecast period, leading to an increase in the 

unemployment rate, to as much as 15½% in 2010.  
Inflation has rocketed in
 2008 on the back of

inflation is expected to diminish significantly in 

2009 and 2010, mainly reflecting the sudden fall in 

oil prices since last summer and base-year effects 

associated with energy and food prices, but should 

then converge towards co

    77 growth for the economy as 
a whole is expected to 
increase over the forecast 
horizon, at around 1¾% 
per year. As a result, unit labour costs should grow 

by 3¼% in 2008 and 1% in 2010. Accordingly, the 

competitiveness of the Spanish economy vis-à-vis 

the rest of the euro area would deteriorate further, 

in a context of a high and persistent current 

account deficit. Public finances entering the red territory For 2008, the general government deficit is 

estimated at 1½% of GDP. This is a much worse 

budgetary outcome than in 2007 (a surplus of 2.2% 

of GDP), and well below the target in the 2008 

budget law (a surplus of 1¼% of GDP). It can 

mainly be explained by lower-than-expected 

revenues, the impact of the discretionary measure 

of a tax allowance of •400 per taxpayer and the 

functioning of automatic stabilisers through 

unemployment benefits.  
For 2009, the draft budget law targets a deficit of 
almost 2% of GDP, in co
ntrast with a surplus of 
1¼% in the updated 2007 stability programme. 

The draft budget law seems to be based on an 

optimistic macroeconomic scenario, in which GDP 

would grow by 1%, leading to favourable 
projections for tax revenues and unemployment 
benefits. On the basis of a more prudent 

macroeconomic scenario a
nd budgetary prospects, 
the Commission expects the 
public sector deficit to 
reach 2.9% of GDP in 2009.  
In 2010, based on the customary no-policy-change 
scenario, the general government deficit is forecast 

to slightly increase to 3.2%. Revenue is projected 

to grow at about 3%, close to nominal GDP. Total 

expenditure is assumed to grow by 3¾%, 

reflecting higher unemployment benefits in 

particular.  
The primary balance should decline from 
equilibrium in 2008 to a deficit position of 1½% in 

2010. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to 

increase from 37½% in 20
08 to around 44½% in 
2010.  
For the forecast, and without prejudging the final 
statistical treatment, which will have to be 

approved by Eurostat, the technical assumption on 

the operations to stabilise the financial system is 

that they have no direct impact on both 

government balance and debt.

78 Domestic demand weakens in 2008 The French economy lost momentum in the first 
six months of 2008 with GDP declining in the 

second quarter by 0.3%. It is expected to contract 

again in the remainder of the year, resulting in an 

annual growth rate of 0.9%. Domestic demand, the 

traditional main support of growth is likely to 

shrink, making a negative contribution to 

economic activity for the 
first time since 2001. 
The disappointing economic performance in the 
second quarter largely refl
ected the strong decline 
in investment and exports. There are no signs of a 

significant pick up in growth in the coming 

quarters, as short-term indicators (e.g. business 

surveys and industrial production) are still showing 

a downward trend. The deceleration in foreign 

demand, associated with the effects of the euro's 

past appreciation, will continue to limit export 

growth. Private consumption will suffer from the 

decline in households' di
sposable income, as the 
worsening of the labour market in the second half 

of 2008 will gradually replace the impact of high 

inflation. Both productive and residential 

investment will shrink, as a result of the worsening 

economic outlook and th
e tightening of credit 
conditions. Imports will slow sharply reflecting the 

weak domestic demand. After picking up in the 

summer, inflation will decline strongly thanks to 

falling oil and food prices and in the absence of 

second round effects (the indexation of the 

minimum wage has only a small impact and there 

are no other indexation clauses). HICP inflation 

will be 3.3% on average in 2008 up from 1.6% in 

2007. 
Weak growth as domestic demand remains 
soft The financial crisis and the global slowdown are 
expected to contribute to the weak economic 

activity in 2009 with cooling private consumption 

and a contraction in investment. Subdued 

economic activity in the first half of 2009, 

combined with a negative carry-over from 2008, 

will imply stalling growth in 2009.  
Private consumption is forecast to be weak and to 
provide only limited support to growth. This is due 

to the fact that the real disposable income will 

slow down, despite the easing of inflationary 

pressures because of a fall in employment. 

Moreover, the access to new bank loans to finance 

private consumption could become even more 

difficult due to the tightening of credit conditions. 

In a context of growing uncertainties, households 

are likely to remain pessimistic and to save more. 

Households' residential investment is likely to 

contract further in 2009, hampered by purchasing 

power losses, rising interest rates, the tightening of 

lending criteria on mortgage loans, and the 

delaying of purchasing decisions by buyers in 

response to the expected further fall in housing. 

The effects of these factor
s are already visible in 
the decline in the number of housing starts, 

transactions, and building permits. Investment in 

construction as a whole will also contract as the 

phasing out of the local electoral cycle in public 

investment will last into 2009. Business 

investment will be hampered by softer domestic 

and external demand, the likely fallback in 

production, and tighter financing conditions. In 

addition, capital spending will also be restrained as 
Member States, France 
  79 the capacity utilisation rate has fallen recently and 
the corporate investment ratio remains high.  
In the external sector, exports will be limited by 
the slowdown of global demand and still 

unfavourable cost-competitiveness developments, 

implying a loss of market shares. With imports 

expected to be very weak, net trade will no longer 

put a drag on growth in 2009.  
In 2010, GDP is ex
pected to remain lacklustre. On 
average, GDP growth will come out at 0.8% in 

2010. Private consumption will remain weak since 

households' disposable income will improve only 

slightly. Housing investment is expected to remain 

negative as the housing market continues to adjust 

and prices to fall. However, demographic factors 

as well as fiscal measures to support household 

investment may be expected to support demand for 

housing to some extent. Productive investment will 

gradually recover thanks to better demand 

expectations, mainly coming from abroad and to a 

limited easing of credit conditions. All in all, fixed 

capital formation is likely to stall. Exports will 

grow at a faster pace than 
in 2009 and benefit from 
stronger markets, associated with an improvement 

in price-competitiveness. However, the structural 

losses seen in market shares will persist. 

Consistent with domestic demand developments, 

imports will increase slightly, resulting in a 

positive contribution from net exports to growth. 
The law for the modernisation of the economy 
(LME
3) is assumed to have a limited impact on 
growth as the large-scale restructuring of the retail 

sector entailed would take time.  
Unemployment will grow in 2009 and 2010 In 2008 employment will increase by 0.7% on 

average, due to a dynamic creation of employment 

in the first half of 2008 followed by a contraction 

in the second half and in 2009, which reflects the 

traditional lag between employment and growth 

and the contraction in the construction sector. In 

2010, employment is set to almost stall in the face 

of continued job losses in the first half followed by 

a slight increase later in the year in the wake of the 

gradual economic recovery. Following two years 

of strong decline, the unemployment rate is 

projected to rise in 2009 and 2010. Given the 

deterioration in the labour market, wage growth 

will be moderate over th
e forecast horizon. Unit 
labour costs should be at 2% in 2009 and gradually 

decline in 2010, after a peak in 2008, as 
productivity growth is expected to slightly 
increase. HICP inflation should be around 1.8% in 

2009 and 2010. Inflationary pressures will abate in 

line with the assumption on commodity prices, the 

slowing of demand and also assuming some 

positive impact on retail prices from the LME in 

2009 and especially in 2010. Core inflation is 

likely to ease until the end 
of the forecast period.  
Public finances hit by the downturn The general government deficit, which increased 
from 2.5% of GDP in 2006 to 2.7% in 2007, is 

expected to deteriorate further, to 3.0% of GDP in 

2008 against the backgr
ound of a significant 
economic slowdown. This 
compares with a new 
official target of 2.7% of GDP (up from 2.5% in 

spring, and from 2.3% in the latest update of the 

Stability Programme). This difference stems from 

slightly higher expenditure and lower revenue. 

2008 should show a small deterioration in the 

structural balance (cyclically-adjusted-balance net 

of one-offs) of around 0.1 % of GDP. Positive one-

off measures in 2008 are expected to amount to 

around 0.1% of GDP, broadly similar to 2007 (
4).  On the expenditure side, the state expenditure rule 
(a stabilisation in volume) should be achieved, but 

the underlying target in value terms will be 

breached, due to higher-than-envisaged inflation, 

which notably weighs on the cost of sovereign 

debt, partially indexed on inflation. Social Security 

expenditure should remain dynamic, and the target 

set for healthcare expenditure evolution would 

once again be exceeded (by ½ pp of GDP), 

although by a lesser extent than in 2007 thanks to 

measures adopted in the 
2008 Social Security 
Finance Act. Local expenditure growth, and 

chiefly investments, should be contained. All in 

all, the expenditure-to-GDP ratio will increase 

marginally from 52.4% in 2007 to 52.6% of GDP, 

the second highest level of
 the EU. On the revenue 
side, the overall tax burden is foreseen to slightly 

decrease to 43.2% from 
43.5% in 2007. This 
reflects both the economic environment and the tax 

cuts adopted in the previous years (including the 

fiscal package enacted
 in summer 2007 (
5), with an 
overall negative impact of 0.3 % of GDP in 2008, 

and the 
taxe professionnelle
 rebates
, with a 
negative impact of around 0.1 % of GDP). 

However, the latter would be partially offset by the 

reform of the dividend taxation (with a positive 

one-off effect of 0.1%).

    80 In 2009, the deficit is expected to deteriorate 
significantly to 3.5% of GDP, compared with an 

official target of 2.7%. 
This increase above the 3% 
of GDP threshold represents the limited structural 

adjustment in years during which growth was 

firmer, as well as the envisaged deterioration of the 

macroeconomic environment. The latter will affect 

public finances more than in 2008, due to (a) the 

lag in the collection of certain taxes (income and 

most of the corporate tax)
, (b) the deceleration of 
inflation, which will no longer support VAT 

receipts anymore, (c) the la
bour market situation, 
with a negative effect on social contributions, and 

(d) on the expenditure side, the indexation of most 

of social benefits on last year's inflation. There are 

many new fiscal measures, yet their overall impact 

will be only slightly positive, since new taxes 

should be somewhat offset by tax cuts. Among the 

largest measures are the additional effect of the 

2007 fiscal package, the additional taxation on 

savings revenue and the contribution of private 

healthcare insurances. The forecast also assumes 

that the "0 volume growth rule" for the state is 

observed. Local expenditure growth should remain 

moderate, while the forecast is based on a prudent 

assessment of corrective m
easures adopted in the 
2009 social security Finance Act. The expenditure-

to-GDP ratio will increase by 0.7 pp and the 
revenue-to-GDP ratio by 0.2 pp. In structural 
terms, the deficit will improve by 0.3 pp. 
The deficit forecast for 20
10 is 3.8%, under the 
conventional assumption of unchanged policies.  
After a small deterioration to 63.9% in 2007, the 
debt ratio is expected to increase more 

dramatically over the for
ecast period, to 65.4% in 
2008, 67.7% in 2009 and 69.9% in 2010. This 

takes into account the capital increase in Dexia to 

which the State subscribed (0.05% of GDP) and 

the injection of EUR10.5 billion (or 0.5% of GDP) 

worth of capital into the country's six largest banks 

by year-end (
6); it assumes as well that 
privatisation proceeds, limited in 2008, would still 

be subdued in 2009 and 2010, reflecting the 

gloomy financial markets.

t81 Real GDP growth in negative territory for most 
of 2008  The marked slowdown of real GDP growth in Italy 
has already been under way since mid 2007, prior 

to the euro area peer
s and well before the 
deepening of the financial market crisis. It turned 

into a contraction in the 
second quarter of 2008. 
For the second half of the year, most available 

indicators, in particular industrial output and 

business confidence, signal
 that the country has 
moved into a technical recession. It is only thanks 

to the first-quarter rebound Œ to a large extent a 

statistical effect after a st
rongly negative outturn in 
the final quarter of 2007 Œ that economic activity 

in 2008 is expected to be flat. This implies a 

negative growth impulse into 2009.  
The main driver of the negative developments is 
domestic demand. Under the impact of 

accelerating price increases, in particular of the 
most frequently purchased goods, as well as 

negative wealth effects and 
heightened uncertainty, 
households are cutting their consumption. This 

entails a substantial rise in the household savings 

rate in 2008, also on the back of substantial wage 

and employment growth. Falling demand and 

tightening financial conditions are leading firms to 

scale back their investment plans. Residential 

investment is bound to slow down in line with the 

sharp deceleration in loans for house purchases. In 

the external sector, im
ports are expected to 
contract compared with 2007 as domestic demand 

falls. Exports are slowing down after the rebound 

recorded in the first quart
er of the year, under the 
lagged impact of the appreciation of the euro and 

deteriorating cost compe
titiveness. By sector, 
industry is the main driver of the quarterly real 
GDP contractions. The services sector continues to 

expand, albeit at a very slow pace.  
Lower inflationary pressures to support a mild 
recovery Inflation is estimated to have peaked in the third 
quarter of 2008. Under the assumption of 

decelerating energy and no
n-oil commodity prices, 
it will return to 2% in 2009. The energy 

component of the HICP index will decline relative 

to 2008, whereas the unprocessed food component 

will moderate. Core inflation will decelerate but 

will remain slightly more dynamic than headline 

inflation throughout the forecast horizon.  
Lower inflation and some further wage increases 
will sustain real disposable incomes. A mild 

recovery in private consumption will gradually set 

in throughout 2009 and 2010, resulting in a 

stabilisation of the household savings rate. 

Prospects for a recovery of gross fixed capital 

formation appear to be somewhat further away. 

The negative impact of tighter financial conditions, 

decreasing profitability, lower confidence and 

sluggish demand will affect private investment 

throughout 2009. Only in 2010 will it recover 

pace, in particular as 
the turnaround in demand 
will support equipment investment. As for public 

investment, its dynamics will be affected by the 

planned containment of government expenditure.  
With prospects of subdued global demand, on the 
one hand, and the assumed depreciation of the 

euro, on the other, export growth will gradually 

resume some strength in the second part of 2009 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  82 and more decisively in 2010. This will not prevent 
further losses of market shares. The recovery of 

import growth will be marginally stronger, 

entailing a slightly negative contribution of net 

exports to real GDP growth in 2010. Nevertheless, 

after increasing in 2008, the current account deficit 

will narrow in 2009 and 2010, as Italy™s terms of 

trade are projected to im
prove thanks to lower 
commodity prices.  
Overall, real GDP is expected to stagnate also in 
2009 and to increase by 0.6% in 2010. 
The labour market loses some of its vigour  Relatively robust employment growth in the first 

half of 2008, particularly in the services sector, is 

providing yet another illustration of the resilience 

displayed by the labour market over the past 

several years. In the forecast scenario, employment 

is set to increase by 0.7% in 2008 as a whole, 

assuming some contraction in the last two quarters 

of the year. Unemployment, however, is projected 

to increase for the first time in ten years as new 

jobseekers, many of them women and new or 

newly recorded immigrants, outnumber new hires. 

Under the lagged impact of the significant 

slowdown in economic activity, employment 

growth is projected to stall in 2009, before 

resuming pace in 2010. The unemployment rate is 

expected to continue increasing gradually, as the 

rise in the labour force still outpaces employment 

growth.    
Labour productivity decreases substantially in 
2008 and is forecast to re
main virtually flat in 
2009 and 2010. This scenario highlights the 

persistent productivity challenge for the Italian 

economy, with little prospects for any decisive 

improvement in the medium 
term in the absence of 
bold structural reforms. Moderate demand and 

sluggish productivity growth adversely affect 

profitability: the gross operating surplus is 

expected to decelerate markedly in 2008 and will 

not recover over the forecast period.  
The wage agreements signed since late 2007 in 
many sectors of the economy, both private and 

public, are at the basis 
of the marked acceleration 
in compensation per employee in 2008. Combined 

with negative labour productivity growth, this 

gives rise to a sharp speeding up of unit labour 

costs and continues to weigh on the competitive 

position of the Italian economy, both within the 

euro area and against the 
rest of the world. In 
2009, labour cost growth should ease; in real terms 
it will be broadly in line with productivity growth 

in both 2009 and 2010. In 
other words, the forecast 
scenario assumes that the 
recent sizeable increases 
in wages will not be repeated in the next few years 

and therefore will not 
generate second-round 
effects on prices. If that were not the case, 

accelerating domestic input
 prices would promote 
the diffusion and duration of inflationary and wage 

pressures.  
Structural budgetary position to worsen in 
2008– After falling to 1.6% of GDP in 2007, its lowest 
level since 2000, the gover
nment deficit is forecast 
to increase again in 2008, to 2½% of GDP. The 

adverse economic cycle, together with 

discretionary expansionary measures, including the 

sizeable increase in compensation of employees, 

will lift the expenditure to GDP ratio by almost ¾ 

pp. compared with 2007. 
A marginal decline Œ ¼ 
pp. of GDP Œ is projected on the revenue side. 

Direct taxes, in particular on personal income, 

continue to display healthy growth, supported by 

the increase in employment and wages. By 

contrast, indirect taxes are declining on the back of 

sluggish private consumption and discretionary 

cuts.  The substantially higher headline deficit in 2008 
relative to 2007 implies that the structural balance, 

i.e. the balance adjusted fo
r the effects of the cycle 
and excluding one-offs, will worsen by ½ pp. of 

GDP. This follows the substantial structural 

improvement achieved over 2006-2007 to correct 

the excessive deficit, by around 3 pp. of GDP.  
–before improving in 2009-2010 thanks to the 
three-year fiscal package The forecast for 2009 and 
2010 incorporates the 
impact of the three-year fiscal package that was 

approved by Parliament in the summer. With it, the 

government substantiated its commitment to 

achieving the medium-term objective of a balanced 

budget in 2011, mainly through a progressive 

containment of expenditure at all levels of 

government. The deficit targets for 2009 and 2010 

were set at 2.1% and 1.2% of GDP, with real GDP 

growing by 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively.  
In the Commission services
™ forecast, the headline 
deficit in 2009 will increase slightly compared 

with 2008, to 2.6% of GDP. This forecast assumes

    83 the firm implementation, at all levels of 
government, of the expenditure cuts envisaged in 

the fiscal package and conf
irmed in the draft 2009 
budget presented to Parliament in September. On 

the revenue side, corporate income taxes are 

expected to fall, also because of the delayed 

impact of the economic downturn, while indirect 

taxes will gradually recover. Compared with the 

official target, the high
er deficit forecast is 
essentially explained by lower GDP growth. In 

structural terms, the 2009 government balance will 

improve by ½ pp., bringing it back to the level 

seen in 2007.  
In 2010, resolute consolidation efforts in a context 
of slightly positive economic growth will allow 

reducing the headline defi
cit to 2.1% of GDP. 
Starting form a more unhealthy budgetary position, 

the remaining difference with the official deficit 

target for 2010 is due to the lower expected 

economic growth, a more cautious projection of 

direct tax developments and the incorporation of 

some limited expenditure slippages, in particular at 

local level. The structural balance will improve 

again by ½ pp. of GDP relative to 2009. 
The expected economic stagnation and a still low 
primary surplus Œ at around 2½% of GDP - will 
prevent any reduction in the government debt ratio 
in 2008 and 2009 from the 104.1% of GDP 

recorded in 2007. A slight decline is projected only 

in 2010 on the back of a higher primary surplus. 
Downside risks to the forecast Despite the relatively low indebtedness of the 

Italian private sector, there are risks of a more 

significant transmission of the financial crisis to 

the real economy. These risks primarily relate to 

consumer confidence: should it remain at very low 

levels or worsen further, private consumption will 

stay even more subdued than projected. In this 

context, this forecast assumes a consistent 

implementation of the planned fiscal consolidation 

effort, which will play a crucial positive role by 

anchoring consumers' and businesses' expectations 

of an orderly resolution of the crisis. Still, the 

execution of the expenditure containment 

provisions in the fiscal package is not without 

challenges, as they mainly take the form of 

financial constraints and leave it to the 

administrations in charge to define how the 

savings will be achieved, requiring them to 

increase spending efficiency.

84 Buoyant but activity slowing down in 2008 Economic activity in Cyprus remained strong in 
the first half of 2008, recording a growth rate of 

4%. However, GDP is expected to have 

decelerated somehow over the second half of the 

year, which should lead to 
an annual rate of 3¾%. 
Economic activity has been exclusively driven by 

robust domestic demand. Private consumption 

benefited from continued employment and wage 

growth, low interest rates and sustained credit 

expansion as well as euro adoption confidence 

effects. Gross fixed capital formation has 

decelerated from the unusua
lly high levels of last 
year although still dynamic. A deteriorated 

external environment and a slowing of economic 

activity in Cyprus' main trading partners had an 

adverse effect on exports. Specifically, revenue 

from tourism decreased in nominal terms. Due to 

the more moderate growth of private consumption 

and investment, imports are 
also expected to slow 
down, compared with 2007. All in all, the growth 

contribution of external sector will be negative. 
Subdued real estate activity weighs on 2009 
growth prospects In 2009, economic activity is foreseen to 
decelerate further and gr
ow by almost 3%. GDP 
would continue being driven exclusively by 

domestic demand. Private consumption would still 

be robust supported by rising disposable income, 

which reflects sustained employment and wage 

growth, as well as the impact of the recent income 

tax reform. Compared with
 the most recent past 
though, private consumption is projected to show 

signs of moderation in the face of rising household 
debt burden, of a severely uncertain environment 
and of the ongoing international financial crisis. 

Housing investment will decelerate strongly and 

weigh on growth, largely due to a subdued demand 

for dwellings by non-residents. As a result, 

housing prices, mainly in the coastal areas, are 

foreseen to somehow moderate. The projected 

slowdown in private consumption and deceleration 

in investment should put a brake on import growth. 

Exports of goods would grow only moderately 

while exports of services are expected to grow 

below their long-term trend, due to the adverse 

external conditions. The contribution of net 

exports to GDP growth 
will remain negative.  
GDP growth is projected to recover mildly in 
2010, on the back of a so
ft rebound in private 
consumption and investment. Imports are foreseen 

to follow. In line with an improving external 

environment and demand, exports, particularly of 

services, are projected also
 to rebound. However, 
the contribution of net exports to growth will 

improve only marginally 
while the current account 
deficit is projected to remain at about 10% of 

GDP.  
Labour market remains tight, while costs and 
prices rise In line with moderating economic activity, 
employment growth is proj
ected to decelerate and 
grow at around 1½% per year until 2010. Less 

dynamic immigration inflows, coupled with solid 

employment growth, should keep the 

unemployment rate decreasing despite the 

softening growth outlook. On top of higher than 

anticipated contractual salary increases in a context 

of tight labour market conditions, the application 

of the cost-of-living-allowance system would lead 

to strong high wage growth. Also, the increase in 

pension contributions in 2009, as part of the 

pension reform, will add additional pressure on the 

compensation of employees. As productivity will 

grow only moderately, unit labour costs will 

continue growing at high levels in the coming 

years, above the euro area 
average. As a result, the 
competitive position of the Cypriot economy will 

keep deteriorating, which would contribute to the 

persistent current account deficit.

markets, HICP inflation accelerated in the first

    85 eight months of 2008 to 4¾%. Base effects from 
the past sharp increase in oil prices would help rein 

in inflation. HICP inflation is projected to decrease 

just below 3% in 2009 and inch up in 2010, in line 

with the projected energy prices.  
Public finances remain in surplus For 2008, the government surplus is projected at 

1% of GDP. This is much lower than the 2007 

outturn of 3½% of GDP. Revenue decelerated, 

largely due to a more moderate property tax 

receipts, but still remain at historically high levels. 

However, expenditure increased on the back of 

higher contractual salary increases and transfers to 

disadvantaged social groups as well as spending 

related to the drought, such as importation of 

potable water and compensation to farmers whose 

crops were destroyed by the drought.   
For 2009, a government surplus of ¾% is 
forecasted. This is sligh
tly lower than the budget 
target of a 1% of GDP 
surplus, mainly on account 
of a somewhat less optimistic macroeconomic 

scenario and a more prudent assessment of 

measures on the revenue side. A small increase in 

revenue is totally offset by an equivalent rise in 

expenditure. A reduction in direct taxes and other 
revenues, associated with subdued real estate 
activity and lower corporate profitability would be 

only partially offset by an increase in indirect 

taxes. The latter reflects the introduction of the 

minimum rate on specific goods and services. 

However, social contributio
ns are projected to rise 
by about ½ p.p. of GDP, within the framework of 

the recently adopted pension reform. In terms of 

GDP, expenditure is target
ed to increase slightly. 
Increases in public wages, social transfers and 

other expenditure amounting to about 1 p.p. of 

GDP are expected to be only partially offset by a 

reduction in interest payments and subsidies. 

Measured by the cyclically-adjusted balance net of 

one-offs, the structural balance would remain at 

similar levels as in 2008. Based on the customary 

no-policy-change assumption, the 2010 surplus is 

projected to inch down 
at about ½% of GDP.  
Debt would continue on a decreasing path 
attaining about 41% of GDP by 2010, largely 

reflecting high primary surpluses and the planned 

reduction of deposits with the central bank, 

amounting to almost 6% of GDP in 2008.

86 Boom turned quickly into a recession After real GDP growth of 10.3% in 2007, data 
suggest that Latvia entered a recession already in 

the first half of 2008. The sharper slowdown than 

assumed in the spring forecast is mainly a 

consequence of a steeper 
than expected drop in 
domestic demand following sharp falls in 

consumer and business 
confidence. The global 
financial crisis amplifies the shock of the reversal 

of Latvia's own lending and house price boom by 

tightening credit availability and conditions. The 

concomitant downturn on the export markets has 

hit the tradable sector, which was already 

weakened by huge cost increases from the 

previous years. On the expenditure side, private 

consumption and investment is falling in 2008, as 

house prices and credit continue their steep 

downward trend. Up to September 2008, prices of 

standard Riga apartments have fallen by around 

30-40% from the peak in April 2007, but were still 

more than double their level at the time of Latvia's 

EU-entry. In view of th
e market conditions, the 
government has decided to lift some of the 

measures of its 2007 anti-
inflation plan. However, 
these changes are unlikely to
 lead to a short-term 
revival, as potential buyers are waiting in 

anticipation of further pr
ice decreases, while banks 
are increasingly unwilling to lend. As regards 

external demand, exports have lost momentum, but 

the large drop in imports
 which accompanies the 
correction in domestic demand leads to a positive 

growth contribution of net exports. From the 

production side, wholesale and retail trade have 

become the worst performing sector, overtaking 

manufacturing, registering year-on-year 

contractions of 5.9% and 5.3% respectively in the 
second quarter. Services grew by 0.5% year-on-
year and construction by 5.6%. Transport, storage 

and communication grew by a modest 2.0% y-o-y 

growth in Q2. Monthly statistics suggest a further 

deterioration essentially in all GDP categories in 

the third quarter of 2008. 
Bleak prospects for domestic demand Unusually large uncertainty remains around short-

term economic prospects due to the fading of 

earlier main growth drivers and serious doubts as 

to the ability of domestic industry to increase 

exports and thus to help achieve a more balanced 

growth path. The global financial crisis only adds 

to this uncertainty, with Latvia being heavily 

dependent on foreign funding both due to its 

relatively large foreign debt and to the need for 

further financing of its economic catching-up.  
Although very difficult to gauge in speed and 
breadth, a readjustment from the non-tradable to 

the tradable sector is expected to take place over 

the forecast horizon. Domestic demand oriented 

sectors, mainly services, can be expected to lose 

output and workers. However, due to the lagging 

reaction of the labour market, the most painful part 

of this adjustment is still ahead. It is expected to 

take years until companies in the tradable sector 

regain their cost competitiveness. Till then, strong 

pressure remains to invest in technology and 

capital and public investment projects Œ 

increasingly directed to
wards strengthening the 
country's export potential, Œ will provide some 

cushion against a too-sharp drop in investment. 

Nevertheless, a recovery in private investment is 

expected to come only in 2010, after the trough of 

the recession. By then, real
 estate prices should 
reach levels substantiated by realistic long-term 

local income potential, which Œ together with 

obvious need for better and more housing units Œ  

should revive lending to households and 

developers. Net exports will likely keep their 

strong positive growth contribution during the 

correction, especially in 
2008-2009. However, the 
short-term outlook for exports is constrained by 

weakness in key export markets, more difficult 

financing conditions and previous and forthcoming 

energy and labour co
st increases. Private 
consumption is expected to become a positive 

growth driver only in the second-half of 2010. The 

ratio to GDP of net external liabilities is set to

   87 snow-ball higher during the recession, but the rate 
of deterioration is expected to decrease sharply in 

2010. Although, the external imbalance is poised 

to moderate significantly, dependency on short-

term financing is expected to remain with poor 

prospects for FDI in the immediate term.  
Lasting impact of overheating There are increasing signs th
at tight labour market 
conditions have started to ease, but there is a 

natural lag till the market adapts from an 

overheating environment of large nominal wage 

growth and high inflation to recessionary 

circumstances. Neverthele
ss, the reaction on the 
labour market to the drop in domestic demand is to 

be significant. This is expected to be apparent both 

from a rapid moderation in nominal wage growth 

and from rising unemployment, though the latter is 

to be restrained by a decrease in the participation 

rate (due to more retirement and emigration) and 

quick reshuffling of the workforce among different 

branches of the economy. In
flation is expected to 
moderate, due to base effects and falling domestic 

demand, but country-specific energy price 

increases and the still present wage pressure works 

against a quicker than forecasted improvement. 
General government deficit to swell The fiscal outturn for 2007 is reported to be around 

balance. In view of the unfolding economic 

situation, the original 2008 target of a surplus of 

0.7% of GDP was abandoned in the July 2008 

supplementary budget, which lowered the balance 

target by 1% of GDP, while also cutting 

government expenditures. The growth of VAT 

revenue slowed dramatically during 2008, 

indicating that tax elasticities are turning 

unfavourable in the slowdown phase of the 

economic cycle. Revenue from other major tax 

categories have so far held out well on the back of 

high inflation, but thes
e favourable effects are 
starting to fade.  
The forecast is based on th
e budget draft, as it was 
presented to the Saeima on 16 October. Taking 

into account less favourabl
e macroeconomic - and 
hence revenue projections - than those on which 

the draft budget was based, 
deficits are forecast of 
over 5% of GDP in 2009 and 6% in 2010. The 

final version of the 2009 budget is to be adopted 

only at the end of November. Under the no-policy-

change assumption, the debt ratio is projected to 

increase from 9.5% in 2007 to 23.0% by 2010.

88 Soft landing so far The expected slowdown 
has now clearly set in, 
and even though growth moderated to only 6.1% 

in the first half of 2008, rapidly deteriorating 

economic sentiment, slowing retail sales and 

weakening industrial production point to a more 

pronounced deceleration in the second half of the 

year and to around 4% fo
r the year as a whole. 
Domestic demand remains the main growth driver.  
Investment decelerated rapi
dly in the first half of 
the year, mainly due to 
a correction in the real 
estate market, and is expected to weaken further. 

Although consumer spending
 will also decelerate, 
it is forecast to remain relatively strong, as 

suggested by the still relatively high growth of 

credit and retail sales, though both are clearly 

slowing. Household disposable income has been 

boosted by the 3 pp. cut in the personal income tax 

rate in January 2008, as well as by accelerating 

wages and rising social transfers. The external 

balance widened significantly in the first half of 

the year, though some narrowing of the deficit can 

be expected as the slowdown progresses and 

imports slow. 
Less bright prospects for the future Hopes that Lithuania would "decouple" from the 

sharp growth slowdowns 
seen in the other two 
Baltic States seem less and less realistic. Real GDP 

growth is projected to weaken considerably in 

2009, led by a sharp drop in domestic demand. 

This reflects global financial conditions, falling 

confidence among businesses and consumers and 

the deteriorating external environment. Lithuania 
will face additional challenges in 2010 related to 
the energy price shock expected as a result of the 

closure of the Ignalina nu
clear power plant which 
is scheduled by the end of 2009, and overall 

growth is set to turn negative. 
Investment growth is thus likely to decelerate 
significantly over the forecast period. Residential 

construction is expected to drop as a consequence 

of an ongoing housing market correction; tighter 

credit conditions are al
so likely to affect 
infrastructure and non-residential business 

investment. In 2010, there will be a pressing need 

for investment to improve energy efficiency and 

technologies, although tight credit conditions will 

act as a constraint. Private consumption growth is 

also forecast to weaken substantially, as inflation is 

expected to remain high, credit growth is rapidly 

decelerating and expectations are worsening. Any 

recovery of domestic demand in 2010 will be 

dampened by high inflation as a consequence of 

the Ignalina decision. 
The external environment is now much less 
benign, with price pressures increasing and growth 

in Lithuania's main trading partners expected to 

weaken substantially. There is increasing 

uncertainty as to whether deteriorating export 

opportunities in EU countries will be offset by 

continuing demand from neighbouring CIS 

countries (the market for about a third of 

Lithuania's exports). Nevertheless, net exports are 

forecast to contribute positiv
ely to growth in 2009, 
with import growth set to
 recede. The external 
deficit is expected to narrow but remain 

substantial; the merchandise trade deficit is likely 

to improve and increasing current and capital 

transfers from the EU 
should exert a further 
moderating influence. In 2010, additional imports 

of energy will lead to a renewed widening of the 

external balance. Consequently, net external 

liabilities relative to GDP are expected to continue 

to increase during the forecast period. 
Labour market flexibility to be tested The previously tight labour market is easing 

somewhat. Unemployment started to increase in 

the first half of 2008, while
 vacancy rates fell in all 
sectors. However, continuing high wage increases 

in 2008 reflect a lagged labour market adjustment 

as well as higher wage growth in the public sector.

   89 Unemployment is set to rise significantly further 
but this should help slow wage growth. 
Serious energy price shock in 2010  HICP inflation escalated 
further from 5.8% in 
2007 and reached double digits in the first half of 

2008. It was fuelled mainly by rising food and 

energy prices, following global trends, but also 

reflected high domestic pressures. After a 

significant increase in the price of imported gas 

over the last two years, gas prices for consumers 

increased by around 65% at the beginning of 2008 

and regulated prices for heating are set to go up by 

around 40% in autumn 2008
. An increase of excise 
duties on fuel, alcohol and tobacco at the 

beginning of 2008 has also added to inflation. 

Overall, in 2008 inflation is expected to be just 

below 12%. In 2009, infla
tion is projected to ease 
somewhat but an increase in
 electricity prices is 
likely and increases in exci
se duties on tobacco are 
planned. After the closur
e of the Ignalina nuclear 
power plant, an expected
 electricity price shock 
will raise inflation pressures. The direct effect on 

inflation is estimated to be around 2.5pp and is 

included in the forecast. Upside risks relate to 

possible indirect effects. 
Public finances under pressure In 2008, the general government deficit is forecast 

to widen substantially to more than 2½%, far 

beyond the target of 0.5% in the previous 

convergence programme.
 This reflects both 
revenue-decreasing measures such as direct tax 

reductions and also higher spending, including an 

increase of social transfers 
and a substantial rise in 
public sector salaries. Moreover, tax receipts also 

started to weaken in the 
second half of the year 
against the backdrop of weaker domestic demand.  
In 2009, given the rapid deterioration of domestic 
demand, and the expenditure-increasing measures 

adopted in 2008, the general government deficit is 

projected to deteriorate 
to about 3½% of GDP in 
the absence of corrective 
measures. The draft 2009 
budget includes increas
ed excise duties, tax 
exemptions for companies investing in R&D, 

significant wage increases for some public sector 

workers and a higher soci
al contribution rate. In 
2010 the general government deficit is set to reach 

4% of GDP against the backdrop of negative 

growth and on the basis of the customary no-

policy-change assumption. Gross public debt is set 

to increase to above 20% of
 GDP by the end of the 
forecast horizon. 15. LUXEMBOURG

forecast
90 2007 was excellent and 2008 still rather good– According to recently rel
eased revised data, real 
GDP grew by 5.2% in Luxembourg in 2007, only 

slightly less than in 20
06 (6.4%). A deceleration 
has clearly been underway 
since the second quarter 
of 2007 but, according to the latest available data, 

the first half of 2008 was still rather strong. 

Employment has remained buoyant, rising by an 

annual 5.1% in the first half of this year. Private 

consumption has been rather subdued in 2008 

despite the tax cuts foreseen by the budget and the 

non negligible increase in wages (1¼% a year in 

real terms in 2006 and 2007). Investment is likely 

to slow down considerably (but it was very strong 

in 2007): private investment, in particular, is 

projected to be weak, growing by around 1%, 

while government investment should rise by nearly 

5% in volume. Exports of services have already 

slowed down considerably. 
In total, real GDP is 
expected to grow by about 2½% in 2008, chiefly 

thanks to the still rather strong first semester. 
– but 2009 might be quite gloomy  The crisis on the financial markets and the global 

slowdown in growth will certainly take their toll 

on Luxembourg too: exports of goods will suffer 

from the global slowdown in the world                                                                                         

economy, rising by about 1% in volume. Exports 

of services are likely to post negative growth rates 

in 2009, reflecting the decline in the activity of the 

financial sector, and so will private investment. 

The main support to growth in 2009 will probably 

come from the government, whose consumption 

and investment are projected to continue to rise 

strongly. Besides, private consumption will be 
fuelled by a new cut in income tax foreseen in the 
2009 budget, the ex ante cost of which is estimated 

at 0.9% of GDP (after a first one provided by the 

2008 budget and amounting to 0.5% of GDP). 

Moreover, the 2009 budget foresees the 

replacement of the current tax reductions for 

children by a system of tax credits, a reform which 

will result in an additional increase in households' 

disposable income by about 0.25% of GDP. 

Furthermore, wage increases are projected to 

remain relatively strong in 2009, though less than 

in 2008. However, these positive factors will be at 

least partially offset by wealth effects resulting 

from the drop in stock markets and by the negative 

impact that the financial turbulences and the 

economic downturn are 
already exerting on 
consumer confidence. GDP 
growth will thus slow 
down considerably in 2009, probably to slightly 

more than 1%, which would constitute the lowest 

growth rate ever recorded in Luxembourg since the 

beginning of the country's success story in the mid 

80's. The economy is forecast to improve in 2010 

in line with the rest of the EU: exports of services 

should again post positive growth rates, exports of 

goods will re-accelerate with world trade and 

investment will probably recover from the trough 

projected for 2009. Howe
ver, the speed of the 
upturn will crucially depend on the recovery on the 

financial markets: it could thus well be relatively 

slow and growth will probably hardly exceed 2%.  
Needless to say, this 
forecast is subject to 
considerable downside risks. A priori, the 

Luxembourgish financial sector does not seem 

weaker than those of other countries but its size 
7 and its extreme dependency on abroad 
8 imply that 
financial shocks might have a much bigger impact 

than on most other countries. If any forecast made 

at this juncture is mark
ed by a deep uncertainty, 
this is especially true for Luxembourg.  
Employment growth will slow down– Employment growth, too, will slow down in 2009 

but this deceleration will be less visible in the 

yearly average than that 
in output, particularly 
because of the very large carry-over from 2008. 

The lag between the slowdowns in output and in 

employment seems to be especially long in 

Luxembourg, as could already be observed during 

the 2001-2003 downturn. Employment growth will 

probably continue to decline all over the forecast

   91 period and might fall to about 1% in 2010, which 
would be the lowest growth rate recorded since 

1985. As a result, unemployment, which had 

begun to decline in the autumn of 2007, will rise 

again. Due to the lag in employment, productivity 

will drop next year, as was already the case in 

2001. This will strongly push up unit labour costs, 

which might well increase significantly over the 

forecast period as they alre
ady did in 2001-2003.  
–and inflation is going to decrease– Consumer prices accelerat
ed markedly in 2008, 
following the rise in oil and food prices. The HICP 

will probably increase by about 4.4% this year 

(after 2.7% in 2007) and the national CPI, which 

excludes consumption by non-residents and 

especially their large pu
rchases of car fuel, by 
about 3.7%. In view of th
e recent decline in oil and 
food prices, inflation should diminish in 2009. 
–and so will the government surplus The general government surplus rose from 1.3% of 

GDP in 2006 to 3.2% in 2007. It will decline this 

year and more substantially in 2009 and 2010, first 

as an effect of the la
rge cuts in income tax 
provided by the 2008 and 2009 budgets (the latter 
also foresees a reduction in the corporate tax rate 
from 22% to 21%) and of the strong rise in 

government consumption and investment but also 

because of the impact 
of the economic slowdown 
on revenues. However, this effect is difficult to 

assess as, for institutional reasons, the shortfalls in 

revenues form corporate tax can be spread over the 

five years following the decline in profits (or the 

losses) that generated them. The recent operations 

in support of financial stability (in particular in the 

case of Fortis and Dexia) comprised a convertible 

loan granted by the Luxembourgish authorities to 

the local subsidiaries of these banks and 

amounting to about 7% of 
GDP. This loan will be 
financed by borrowing. This operation will have in 

itself no effect on the government balance but it 

will result in a doubling of the public debt ratio, 

from 7% of GDP in 2007 to about 14% in 2008.

92 The starting economic recovery– Growth fell to 1.1% in 2007 compared with a 
historical average of 4.2% between 2001 and 2006. 

The fiscal austerity measures from mid-2006 

certainly played a role in the slowdown. 

Nevertheless, the private sector showed some 

resilience as consumption expenditure grew by a 

moderate 0.7% in 2007 despite the close to 5% 

decrease in real wages (as measured on cash-flow 

basis). Gross fixed capital formation also increased 

at a modest rate, while net exports continued their 

surge, providing the momentum for the economy. 

These trends continued in the first half of 2008. 

However, preliminary data for end summer 2008 

and current soft indicator
s suggest that external 
shocks, such as the financial crisis, may have 

interrupted the recovery of the economy.  
–was obliterated by the financial crisis Hungarian financial markets came under severe 

stress from early October 2008, as there was a 

freeze on the government bond market, a sharp fall 

in the stock market and a strong depreciation of the 

forint exchange rate. These events were provoked 

by the substantially increas
ed risk aversion vis-à-
vis emerging markets, and in particular with 

respect to Hungary due to its vulnerabilities (e.g. 

large external debt). (
9) The financial crisis will have the largest impact on 
the Hungarian real economy through two channels. 

First, foreign demand and thus export performance 

will have to abate due to
 the slowdown in the EU 
and the rest of the world. Second, widespread 

credit rationing will seriously affect households™ 
ability to borrow. Consumption expenditure is thus 
foreseen to decline in 2009 by more than 1%, 

assuming a temporary halt in foreign currency 

lending to households. The evolving credit crunch 

would also hinder the reacceleration of investment 

activities, albeit some stimulus is still expected 

from the already announced foreign direct 

investments and an increasing inflow of EU funds. 

Export performance is likely to slow down to 

below 8% in 2008 and to below 2% in 2009. 
Based on monetary conditions prevailing in mid-
October, GDP growth is anticipated to decline to 

0.7% in 2009 before resuming its recovery by 

reaching 1.8% in 2009. At
 the same time, given 
falling consumption and the adjusted fiscal plans, 

the current account deficit is foreseen to decrease 

to around 5% of GDP in 2009. However, should 

the financial turmoil turn out to be more serious, or 

should the authorities adopt additional austerity 

measures as currently 
discussed, the slowdown 
will be more pronounced and the recovery will be 

even more protracted. 
Inflationary pressures subside After reaching 8% in 2007, inflation is expected to 

decline in the coming years,
 supported by both the 
significant fall in oil and food prices and tighter 

monetary conditions, as well as the widening 

negative output gap. However, wages are expected 

to remain more persistent than inflation, providing 

a moderate rise in real wages. Since mid-2006, 

firms™ profitability has been suffering from 

persistently high wages and increases in labour 

taxes. This together with changes in retirement 

regulations has led to a decline in employment in 

the first half of 2008. The radical slowdown in 

economic activity is likely to take its toll on 

employment as well, which is now expected to 

decrease by around 1% both in 2008 and in 2009. 
Public finances After the very high budgetary outturn recorded in 

2006 (a deficit of 9.3% of GDP), the deficit was 

reduced significantly to 5% of GDP in 2007 as a 

result of the fiscal consolidation programme. In 

2008, due mainly to further expenditure restraints 

and the elimination of deficit increasing one-off 

operations, the deficit is expected to decrease to 

3.4% of GDP (well below the official target of 4%

expected wage dynamics and further economic 

whitening. The changes in the expenditure side are 

expected to move in both directions (e.g. indexed 

social transfers are up, investment expenditures are 

down), and finally would lead to another 0.2% of 

GDP deficit reduction. In 2009, the general 

government deficit is expected to decline 

moderately to 3.3% of GDP in 2008 (against the 

2.9% of GDP target set in the revised draft 

budget). Based on the usual no-policy-change 

assumption, the deficit is envisaged to remain at 

this level in 2010. 
The forecast is based on the measures contained in 
the revised draft budget (submitted to Parliament 

on 18 October); therefore it could not incorporate 

any additional expenditure cuts as currently 

discussed. On the revenues side, given the full 

withdrawal of the measur
es of the Government's 
multi-year tax package, th
e forecast is based on an 
unchanged tax code. The foreseen meagre growth 

would especially take its toll in the form of a 

slowdown in the growth of indirect taxes. On the 

expenditure side, the forecast assumes that the 
planned savings in social transfers and government 
consumption will only partly be achieved after 

2008, since it may be difficult to continue to 

contain spending, particularly for operational 

expenditures and the public wage bill in 2010. The 

forecast does not inco
rporate any budgetary 
loosening linked to the forthcoming election 

scheduled for 2010. This assumption, however, is 

subject to considerable risks as evidenced by past 

experience; although historical trends cannot be 

extrapolated, since various structural changes have 

taken place since mid-2006. It also does not 

consider any receipt or cap
ital transfer in relation 
to the ongoing privatisation of the State-owned 

railway company's (MÁV) cargo division.  
After the stabilisation of the debt-to-GDP ratio in 
2007 at 65¾%, a gradual 
decrease is expected for 
2008 to below 65½%, chiefly as a result of the 

anticipated shift to a pr
imary surplus of around 
½% of GDP. However, the debt ratio is projected 

to increase again in both 2009 and 2010.

94 GDP growth slows down in 2008 Following a strong outturn for 2007, economic 
activity decelerated in the 
first half of 2008. The 
downward trend is set to persist, bringing GDP 

growth for 2008 to 2.4%. Private consumption is 

foreseen to grow by 2.2%. Purchasing power 

benefitted from income tax cuts and higher transfer 

payments but was dented by increases in food and 

utility prices as well as softer employment growth. 

Growth in gross fixed capital formation is 

expected to decelerate in 2008 mainly due to a 

decline in public investment following the 

completion of the 
Mater Dei 
hospital. The pace of 
private investment is expected to slow from the 

highs of the previous two years on the back of 

lower housing starts and investment by the 

manufacturing sector. Growth in exports is 

projected to be mainly driven by services, 

specifically remote gaming and ICT. Following a 

strong result in 2007, the performance of tourism 

is projected to be modest this year.  
Subdued consumption but investment picks up 
in 2009-10 Going forward, real GDP 
growth is expected to 
weaken further in 2009 and remain practically 

unchanged in 2010. Until now the financial crisis 

had a modest effect on Malta but economic 

activity, especially the exte
rnal sector, is expected 
to suffer from the ensuing global slowdown. 

Domestic demand will remain the main driver of 

growth. 
Though benefitting from lower inflation, private 
consumption growth is anticipated to slow in 2009 
on the back of weaker labour market conditions. 
For 2010, consumption is foreseen to increase at a 

similar pace with somewhat better employment 

growth. 
Investment is foreseen to pick up in 2009 mainly 
on account of public capital spending. Private 

construction will be supported by the 

commencement of construction on a major ICT 

business park but in general the weak international 

economic scenario is likel
y to adversely impact 
investment decisions. For 2010, investment is 

anticipated to accelerate further. 
Net exports affected by the global slowdown The external sector will remain fragile in the face 

of worsening global conditions. Tourism is 

anticipated to weaken over
 the forecast horizon as 
a result of sluggish demand especially from the 

price-sensitive British market, which is Malta™s 

single most important source market. On the other 

hand the business services sector, specifically ICT 

and remote gaming, is anticipated to show 

resilience to the global slowdown and will 

continue to be the main contributor to growth in 

export of services. Foreign sales of goods, 

dominated by semi-conductors, will remain 

sluggish, albeit supported by the further expansion 

of the emerging pharmaceu
tical industry. Imports 
are projected to remain moderate in line with the 

slowdown in both private consumption and the 

import-intensive exports. 
The current account deficit is projected to worsen 
over the forecast horizon. In view of the projected 

weak external demand, the deficit of trade in goods 

(in percent of GDP) is set to widen until 2009 to 

19.5% of GDP, and to broadly stabilise thereafter. 

The surplus on the services
 account, which peaked 
at 15.5% of GDP in 2007, 
is projected to decrease 
over the forecast horizon, mainly on account of 

weaker tourism earnings. 
Inflation to recede amid a softer jobs market Inflation continued to rise rapidly in the first half 

of 2008 driven by an 
acceleration in food and 
tourist accommodation prices, the latter 

representing around 20% of the index, and 

reinforced by unfavourab
le base effects. The

    95 and electricity prices in 
mid-year added impulse to 
inflation. For 2008, inflation is expected to average 

4.4%, reflecting the assumed reduced price 

pressures from unprocessed food and the lower 

tourist accommodation prices in the wake of softer 

demand. 
For 2009 and 2010, inflation is anticipated to 
decelerate on the back of
 lower commodity prices 
and the anticipated weak
 prospects for tourism 
which will ease accommodation prices. Wage 

increases may feed into inflation but this would be 

more a reflection of already negotiated salary rises 

and automatic wage indexation rather than 

prevailing labour market conditions. Indeed, the 

strong pace of employment creation in the first half 

of 2008 is expected to slow down. The labour 

market is projected to rema
in soft over the forecast 
period reflecting subdued activity in 

manufacturing as well as in tourism and wholesale 

and retail. 
Budgetary position weakens  The downward trend in the general government 

deficit, which had started in 2005, is projected to 

experience a marked setback. In 2008, the deficit 

ratio is estimated to increase to 3.8% of GDP from 
1.8% of GDP in the previous year. The 
deterioration results primarily from the 

expenditure side: (i) a higher increase in the wage 

bill on account of additio
nal recruitment and 
higher wages in particular in the health sector; (ii) 

higher subsidies given the decision to freeze water 

and electricity prices and 
the sharp rise in the oil 
price; and (iii) early retirement schemes in 

preparation for the privatisation of the Malta 

Shipyards with an estimated one-off cost of 1% of 

GDP. 
On a pre-budget basis and with the one-off cost of 
the early retirement schemes vanishing, the deficit 

is projected to decline to 2¾% of GDP in 2009. 

Tax revenue and social contributions are projected 

to be less buoyant reflecting the sluggish economic 

activity. Under the customary no-policy-change 

assumption, the deficit ratio in 2010 is projected to 

decline to 2½% of GDP. 
In line with weaker nominal GDP growth and a 
return to a deficit on
 the primary balance, 
government debt is estimated to increase from 

62.2% of GDP in 2007 to 63.1% in 2008. 

Thereafter the ratio is expected to remain 

practically unchanged.

t96 Activity in 2008: still positive but weakening 
underlying growth impetus Following a buoyant ec
onomic performance in 
2007, GDP growth slowed in the first half of 2008, 

with the first two quarters posting 0.4% and 0.1% 

respectively. In the first quarter growth was mainly 

driven by investment, the bulk of which was one-

off investments in airplanes and energy projects. 

Looking beyond the incidental factors, underlying 

economic growth impetus has weakened 

considerably. Economic activity is expected to be 

subdued in the second half of the year. Due to the 

exceptional momentum generated in 2007 

however, annual GDP grow
th should still reach 
2.3% in 2008.  
Private consumption expenditure is expected to 
expand by 2.0% in 2008. It is being driven by 

higher natural gas consumption, a reform in the 

health care system shifting public to private 

consumption and a high carry-over from 2007. On 

the other hand, consumption is being weakened by 

increases in taxes and social premiums, which act 

as a brake on purchasing power growth. 

Furthermore, the sharp drop in consumer 

confidence is expected to
 start having a negative 
impact on consumption as consumers expect their 

personal financial situation to worsen in view of 

the financial crisis. On ba
lance, quarterly growth 
in 2008 remains well below the long term average.  
Despite an expected ma
rked slowdown in the 
second half of 2008, private investment growth is 

expected to reach 7.1% this year. This is mainly 

due to the one-off investments, which contributed 

to an unusually strong first quarter. These also  
largely explain the expected negative contribution 
of 0.5 pp of the foreign balance to GDP growth in 

2008, as a large part of investment demand is 

directed towards transportation equipment, most of 

which is being imported. Exports are slowing in 

2008 to 4.0% and will stay broadly in line with the 

international import demand, thereby retaining 

their market share. 
Falling consumer confidence and tightening 
credit conditions result in a slowdown in 2009 

and 2010 Economic growth is expected to slow down further 
in 2009, as the impact of the ongoing financial 

crisis on the Dutch economy and the euro area is 

likely to be much stronger than previously 

expected. On average, GD
P growth in 2009 is 
projected to fall to a mere 0.4%. With the 

slowdown already starting in
 the second quarter of 
2008, the carry-over for 2009 is expected to be 

relatively low at 0.1% of GDP, down from 1.7% at 

the end of 2007. For 2010, the annual growth rate 

is expected to come out at 0.9%, due to a modest 

recovery of domestic demand, which is likely to 

profit from lower inflation and somewhat less tight 

credit conditions. 
Private consumption growth is expected to slow 
down to 0.6% in 2009, de
spite an increase in real 
disposable income growth from 1.1% in 2008 to 

2.4% in 2009, which is the result of decreases in 

taxes and social premiums on the one hand and 

falling employment growth and rising inflation on 

the other. The slowdown is assumed to be caused 

mainly by falling consumer confidence and 

tightening credit conditions, which are likely to 
Member States, The Netherlands 
  97 lead to a significant incr
ease in the savings rate, 
thereby lowering consumption. For 2010, private 

consumption growth is for
ecast to increase slightly 
to 0.8% of GDP as a decrease in inflation benefits 

purchasing power.  
The combination of tightening credit conditions, 
falling confidence and the maturing economic 

cycle is expected to have
 a significant impact on 
gross fixed capital formation. Investment growth is 

forecast to decrease by 2.7%
 in 2009. In particular 
cyclically sensitive type investment, such as 

equipment, is likely to show a large decrease. 

Construction is likely to be more heavily 

influenced by stricter le
nding criteria. With these 
tighter lending conditions still largely in place, 

only a modest recovery is assumed for investment 

in 2010, with the average growth rate remaining 

negative at -0.5%. 
 Net exports are expected to contribute positively to 
GDP growth in 2009 and 2010, at around 0.3 pp in 

both years.  Although export growth is expected to 

slow down to 1.3% in 2009, due to an assumed 

slowdown in world trade growth, this is also the 

case for import growth in line with the weak 

domestic and external demand. In 2010 export 

growth is forecast to increase to 3.0%, reflecting 

the more benign external environment. At the same 

time a rebound of import growth to 2.9% is 

expected, which is largely linked to a revival of 

external demand and the stimulus on imports from 

re-exports as the Netherlands is an important 

transit country. 
Labour market loosening, prices still rising  The labour market is currently very tight with a 
projected unemployment rate of 3.0% in 2008 and 

a high number of unf
illed vacancies. From 2009 
on, tensions in the labour market are expected to 

loosen. Unemployment is forecast to rise to 3.4% 

in 2009 and 3.7% in 2010.  The increase in 

unemployment is caused by a slowdown in labour 

demand and in employment growth.  
Employment growth is forecast to slow from 1.8% 
in 2008 to 0.3% in 2009 and 2010, mainly as a 

consequence of the agei
ng population. Over the 
forecast period, the popula
tion of working age is 
projected to remain almost stagnant. Employment 

growth in 2009 and 2010 will be driven mainly by 

(young) women entering the labour market. The 

main trend is for older  women outside the labour 

market being replaced by younger women who are 
supplying labour, thereby increasing the activity 
rate.  Despite the apparent tightness of the labour 
market, labour unions have kept their wage 

demands relatively subdued to date. Over the 

forecast horizon, wages ar
e expected to increase, 
in response to both the still tight labour market and 

increasing inflation. Although rising, wage 

demands are likely to remain reasonably low, 

limiting growth of wages and salaries per full-time 

equivalent to 3.7% in 2009 and 4.0 % in 2010, 

which is a relatively small increase from the 

expected 3.6% rise in 2008. Wage demands are 

expected to be weakened to some extent by the 

government offer to lower social contributions in 

exchange for lower wage demands. Furthermore, 

they are moderated in view of the uncertainty 

surrounding employment b
ecause of the ongoing 
financial crisis. 
HICP inflation is expected to increase to 2.5% in 
2008, from 1.6% in 2007. For 2009, a further 

increase in inflation to 3.0% is expected, despite a 

projected lowering in the 
prices of oil and other 
raw materials. This rise is mainly caused by a slow 

pass-through of higher prices of raw materials into 

consumer prices. Energy and rental prices tend to 

have especially long adjustment lags, as consumer 

gas prices are only adjusted twice a year and rental 

prices of regulated housing only once a year. In 

2010, inflation is project
ed to decrease to 2.3%, 
mainly driven by an expected fall in energy prices. 
Public finances show surpluses  The government balance is expected to improve 
substantially from a surplus of 0.3% in 2007 to 

1.2% in 2008. This improvement is mainly caused 

by higher gas revenues and an increase in taxes. 

Specifically, some new indirect taxes were 

introduced during 2008, for instance taxes on 

aviation (plane tickets) and on packaging of both 

imported and domestically produced goods.  
In 2009, the government balance is projected to 
deteriorate to a surplus of
 ½% of GDP. The budget 
in 2009 will benefit from higher natural gas 

revenues  and from the reduction of the 

contribution to the EU bu
dget in accordance with 
the Council decision on the EU own resources. 

Because the lower contri
bution has officially entered into force with the new financial 

perspectives in 2007, the EU will also reimburse 

the Netherlands for excess contributions paid in

    98 2007 and 2008. In total this amounts to 0.5% of 
GDP, out of which 0.3% of GDP is a one-off, 

linked to 2007 and 2008.  On the other hand, the 

budget is affected by a 0.4% of GDP cut in taxes 

and premiums. The most important measures are a 

decrease in health care premiums, which mainly 

affects corporations, and the lowering of social 
contributions for employees. The first measure 

results from the fact that in previous years 

premiums have been set at too high a rate. The 

lowering of social contributions by 0.3% of GDP 

was made conditional by the government on 

reasonable wage demands by labour unions. Tax 

elasticities in 2009 are expected to be below their 

historical average in th
e light of the projected 
economic downturn. The rise in interest payments 

is linked to the forecasted increase in the debt 

ratio.  
Based on the usual no-policy-change assumption, 
the general government bala
nce in 2010 is forecast 
to deteriorate further to close to balance. The 

deterioration stems in large part from the reversed 

effects of events in 2009.  
The structural balance is expected to increase from 
a deficit of ½% in 2007 to a surplus of ½% in 2008 

and is likely to deteriorate slightly in 2009 to ¼% 
of GDP.  
In spite of a government balance surplus, the 
government debt ratio is forecast to increase to 

48.2% in 2008 from 45.7% in 2007. This increase 

can be more than fully explained by the 

government operations in the financial markets, 

such as the purchase of Fortis bank, approximately 

2¾% of GDP, and the capital injection for ING 

bank, approximately 1¾% of GDP. These 

operations -following a technical assumption (and 

not prejudging the final statistical recording to be 

approved by Eurostat)- do not affect the deficit, 

but increase the debt. In 2009 and 2010, the debt 

ratio is expected to decreas
e gradually again to just 
above 45 % of GDP at 
the end of the forecast 
period

99 Respectable growth until mid-2008 The Austrian economy en
joyed strong economic 
performance over the period 2005-2007, with real 

GDP advancing by close to or above 3% each year, 

thereby exceeding the euro
 area average. On the 
back of lively demand in key foreign markets and 

strong price competitiveness, exports provided the 

major growth momentum that was amplified by a 

rebound in corporate investment. Private 

consumption expanded at a more moderate pace, 

relying on growing employment rather than on 

gains in real per-capita earnings. Output growth 

and job creation remained remarkably resilient 

until mid-2008, but the weakening external 

environment is increasingly taking its toll.  
Solid fundamentals in an unfavourable  
environment Even though the banking sector in Austria so far 
has not been directly exposed to the global 

financial crisis, confidence indicators have started 

to decline across the board 
and there are signs that 
spending plans for investment and consumption 

are being retrenched. This is likely to entail a 

slowdown to quarterly growth rates close to zero 

already in the second half of
 this year. For 2008 as 
a whole, an annual growth
 rate of 2% appears, 
however, within reach.  
Sluggish growth will continue well into 2009 as a 
result of the global slowdown combined with a 

general loss of confidence. Austria's otherwise 

strong competitive position, lack of a real estate 

bubble and healthy bala
nce sheets, suggest, 
however, that the downturn should be less 
pronounced than in most other euro area Member 
States. In a difficult exte
rnal environment, real 
GDP may thus still edge up by around ½ % in 

2009. The assumed gradual global recovery during 

the course of 2009 would be in line with a 

projected growth rate of 1¼ % in 2010.  
After solid growth rates in the last year, business 
fixed investment volumes ar
e expected to decline, 
as it is hit simultaneously by a weakening export 

demand, lower confidence and more difficult 

financing conditions. Only as these three factors 

peter out, probably towards the end of 2009, will 

investment growth resume.  
Decelerating activity is expected to bring to a halt 
the strong employment growth that by mid 2008 

has brought the unemployment rate down below 

4% (Eurostat definition). As job creation will not 

be sufficient to match the growing labour force due 

to increased inflow of migrants and rising 

participation rates of women and older workers, 

unemployment is expected to notch up in 2009 and 

2010.  
Consumption is expected to provide the main 
support to growth in 2009 and beyond, and should 

increase at a rate of about
 1% annually. Although a 
relatively modest increase 
in consumption over the 
past few years suggests that pent-up demand may 

unwind, a weakening employment growth, modest 

wage increases, still relatively high rates of 

inflation, and falling consumer confidence are 

taking their toll. The savings rate, which has been 

on the rise for a few year
s already, is therefore 
expected to stay high.  
Easing inflationary pressures  On the positive side, the high inflation rate in 

Austria, which touched nearly 4% in the summer 

of 2008, is likely to come down substantially over 

the forecast period. This is
 driven mostly by an 
easing of prices in the commodity markets, and the 

fact that seco
nd-round effects have remained 
limited so far, and since cost increases might 

become progressively more difficult to pass on to 

consumers as demand weakens. In addition, in 

2009 inflation is dampened by reduction in VAT 

rates for pharmaceuticals 
and the lowering of 
student tuition fees.

   100 External competitiveness being maintained Even though the immediate growth prospects of 
Austria are curtailed by a weakening external 

environment, Austria will continue to profit from 

the high competitiveness it acquired through wage 

restraint over the past decade and its strong 

position as an exporter to Central and Eastern 

European markets. With continued moderate gains 

in price competitiveness, Austria should be able to 

enjoy a small growth contribution from the foreign 

balance over the forecast period.  
Budget deficit set to widen The first half of 2008 brought unexpectedly high 

tax revenues. In spite of this, the fiscal deficit in 

2008 is expected to remain broadly unchanged, 

because of discretionary measures that raised 

spending, notably the increased child care and 

family allowances, the heating subsidy for the 

elderly and the advancement of the pension 

increase.  For 2009, the for
ecast suffers from the fact that no 
new government has been formed yet and no draft 

budget is available. It is
 clear, however, that the 
slowdown of the economy and the rising 

unemployment rate is likely to have a tangible 
negative impact on public finances, both on the 
revenue and the expenditure side. On the basis of 

the no-policy-change assumption and reflecting 

budgetary measures decided before 23 October, it 

is expected that the deficit will widen by about 

½ % of GDP in 2009 and rise a further ¼ % of 

GDP in 2010. Much of the deterioration is owed to 

the weak business cycle. The deficit could widen 

further, however, if an additional fiscal stimulus 

package should be decided by Parliament. 
In spite of the rising government deficits, the debt-
to-GDP ratio is expected to fall from 59.5% in 

2007 to around 57 % in 2010.

101 Robust growth on the back of domestic 
demand Robust economic activity continued in the first 
half of 2008. Driven by domestic demand, real 

GDP growth eased to 6.1% year-on-year from 

6.6% in 2007. Growth was driven by rebounding 

private consumption (4.8%) and investment 

(15.2%).  
Quarterly data indicate only a marginal loss in 
momentum in the second quarter (6%) after some 

deterioration in the first quarter (6.2%). Strong 

consumption activity was backed up by rising 

employment and wages, the second round of tax 

wedge cuts and the indexation of pensions. 

Investment activity remained healthy thanks to 

construction which picked up after the winter.  
Export and import growth in the first half of 2008 
decreased to about 7½% and 10% respectively in 

real terms, year-on-year. Nonetheless, net exports 

contributed negatively to GDP growth (Œ½ p.p.) to 

a much lower extent than in 2007 (Œ1.8 p.p.) due to 

strong external demand.  
The Polish financial sector which is dominated by 
universal banks with a strong deposit base has 

proved to be resilient to the global financial crisis 

so far, but some small and medium sized banks are 

dependent on foreign financing making them 

vulnerable to external developments. The number 

of completed dwellings grew in the first half of 

2008, while the gap between offer and transaction 

prices has widened, indicating faltering demand 

due to tighter lending conditions.         
Slowdown expected but fundamentals remain 
sound  GDP growth is expected to slow considerably, to 
around 0.6% quarter-on-quarter until the end of 

2008. Lower external demand on the side of the 

main trading partners will be the main drag on 

growth exacerbated by weakening consumption 

and investment in the second half of the year. 

Falling consumer confidence
 and a rising cost of 
credit will limit consumption growth in the second 

half of 2008, which however remains supported by 

strong wage increases (owing to a tax wedge cut 

and a tight labour market). For 2008 as a whole, 

GDP is projected to
 grow at 5.4%.  
Domestic demand will continue to be the main 
driving force of GDP growth, which is expected to 

fall to 3.8% in 2009 and 4.2% in 2010. Both 

investment and private consumption growth are 

likely to decrease somewh
at over the projection 
period. Investment is set to grow at around 8% in 

2009-2010, supported by the inflow of EU funds, 

foreign direct investment and companies' own 

funds accumulated during th
e last years, but the 
rising cost of capital and falling stock prices will 

exert a negative influence. The strong housing 

investment is set to taper off out throughout 2009 

and into 2010, as tightened access to mortgages 

will limit demand and induce a fall in prices in 

some segments of the housing market (mainly 

apartments in large cities), but the effect thereof on 

disposable income will be limited.  
Private consumption growth is expected to slow 
gradually over the forecast period, to 3.4% in 

2010. The tight labour market (exerting upward 
Economic Forecast, Autumn 2008 
  102 pressure on wages) and lower personal income 
taxes in 2009 are the main factors supporting a 

moderate decrease in consumption dynamics, in 

spite of a fall in consum
er confidence, expected 
reduced availability of credit and faltering 

employment growth. Falling investment and 

private consumption is set to steadily decrease 

import dynamics to 5.7% in 2010, limiting the 

negative contribution of net exports to GDP 

growth towards the end of the forecast period.  
Export growth is expected to slow considerably, to 
about 3.9% in 2009 due to lower external demand 

in the EU Œ the main trading partner Œ and to 

rebound thereafter to 5.6% in 2010. The relatively 

robust performance of Polish exports despite the 

negative external outlook will stem 
inter alia
 from 
the structure and cost co
mpetiveness of the Polish 
export industry. External imbalances will augment, 

widening the trade and current account deficit in 

2009 to Œ5¼% of GDP and around Œ6% of GDP, 

respectively. An export rebound and a further 

decrease in imports in 2010 will leave the trade 

and current account deficits 
for that year at similar 
levels. Thanks to higher 
transfers from the EU the 
external deficit will be limited to 3¾% of GDP in 

2010, which still represents a widening compared 

with the previous years.
 Employment growth expected to falter In the course of the first half of 2008 an impressive 
improvement was seen in the labour market, 

continuing the trend seen in 2006. In August 2008 

the unemployment rate fell to 6.7% from an annual 

average of 9.6% in 2007, which corresponds to a 

decrease of more than 450 000 in the number of 

unemployed. Although total employment increased 

(by 3% in the first half of 2008), part of the drop in 

the unemployment rate may be attributed to the 

labour force contracting due to increased early 

retirement. As economic act
ivity is expected to 
weaken employment growth
 should decelerate to 
0.1% in 2010, while a return of emigrants, 

activation of older workers and a reduction of 

taxes on labour should increase the participation 

rate. The number of unemployed is projected to 

reach some 1.2 million in 2009 Œ close to 7¼% of 

the labour force Œ and to increase in 2010 by about 

0.1 million leaving the unemployment rate at 

around 7¾%. 
Inflationary pressures limited by weakening 
economic outlook  Annual HICP inflation decreased from 4.5% in the 
first quarter of 2008 to 4.3% in the second quarter 

and bounced back to 4.4% in the third quarter, 

boosted by strong wage pressure and elevated 

energy prices. Inflation is likely to fall, on the back 

of favourable base effects, stabilising fuel and food 

prices and weakening growth to 3½% in 2009, and 

to decrease further to about 2.6% in 2010, which 

remains marginally above the Polish central bank™s 

medium-term target of 2.5%.  
Unit labour costs are projec
ted to increase by about 
6½% in 2008, as a result of strong wage growth 

combined with modest productivity increases. In 

2009 and 2010, nominal unit labour costs are 

likely to continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace, as 

productivity growth recovers supported by high 

investments from previous years and slow 

employment creation mitigating the impact of 

rising wages. 
The main downside risk to
 the forecast stems from 
the potentially tighter credit conditions which 

could hamper the inflow of the foreign direct 

investment and limit private investment. 

Moreover, the recent depreciation of the Polish 

zloty, if experienced for a longer period of time, 

could substantially affect foreign investment and 

the inflation outlook. 
Fiscal deficit broadly stable under tax cuts and 
restrained expenditure growth The 2007 general government deficit was 2.0% of 
GDP, as confirmed in the October 2008 fiscal 

notification. Spending in 2008 is significantly 

below planned levels, especially due to low central 

government investment, though it is expected to 

accelerate before the end of the year, as it used to 

in the previous years. While employment and wage 

growth remain high, especially in the first half of 

2008, direct taxes generate windfall revenues. As a 

result, the 2008 general government deficit is 

expected to deteriorate less than expected in the 

spring 2008 forecast to 2.3% of GDP (compared to 

2.5% of GDP previously thought). The 

deterioration results mainly from the reduction of 

social contributions (of 
almost 1½ pp. of GDP, 
more than previously expected) but also from 

increases in personal income tax reliefs for 

families (which turned out less costly than 

foreseen before) and a generous indexation of

Despite the restraint imposed by the 2009 draft 
central budget on the growth of many expenditure 

items, the general government deficit is forecast to 

deteriorate slightly to 2½% of GDP in 2009. This 

is the expected outcome of a worse economic 

situation, a personal income tax reform, which was 

adopted by the previous parliament before the 

autumn 2007 elections. According to the reform, 

the current three income tax rates of 19%, 30% and 

40% will be replaced by two rates of 18% and 

32%, with a total cost of more than ½% of GDP 

for the general government. Moreover, various 

measures taken to improve the business climate, 

including slightly lower value-added and corporate 

income taxes together with the restitution of the 

ﬁAlimony Fundﬂ social tran
sfers, are foreseen to 
costs about % of GDP in total. High wage 
increases for large groups of
 public sector, such as 
teachers, medical staff an
d judiciary personnel, are 
also expected to contribute to the deterioration in 

the budget balance. A pl
anned increase of excise 
duties on cigarettes and the replacement of 

publicly fully financed early pensions available to 

numerous professional groups with more narrowly 

targeted ﬁbridge pensionsﬂ, partly financed with 
new social contributions will be insufficient to 
offset these deficit-increasing measures. 
In 2010, the general government deficit is expected 
to remain broadly the same as in 2009 under the 

assumption of no policy change. In particular, the 

possible introduction of a flat personal income tax 

and higher healthcare contributions are not 

considered in the forecast. 
Gross debt is projected to decrease gradually from 
44.9% of GDP in 2007 to about 43% in 2010. A 

faster reduction in the debt ratio than projected in 

this forecast will require a considerable 

improvement in the effectiv
eness of the process of 
privatisation. In the recent years, revenue from this 

source and the number of privatised enterprises 

were notably below the plans and the financial 

crisis may additionally curb privatisation.

t104 Activity decelerating in the course of 2008 Economic activity in Port
ugal decelerated rapidly 
in the course of 2008 after a gentle upswing in 

2006-2007, such that for 
2008 as a whole, GDP is 
projected to grow by only ½%, down from almost 

2% in 2007. Domestic demand has weakened 

mainly as the result of construction falling back 

into the red. Furthermore, exports growth has 

worsened rapidly while high demand for 

equipment goods has added to imports, leading to 

a negative contribution of net exports to GDP 

growth after the positive readings of 2006-2007. 

Thus, the large trade deficit worsened, hurt now 

also by higher commodity prices. The primary 

income deficit also deteriorated markedly mainly 

reflecting a rapidly growing external debt service 

burden. As a result, the 
already high external 
deficit deteriorated further. 
Gloomy prospects for 2009 and 2010 GDP growth is expected to fall further and 

stagnate in 2009 and only slight rebound in 2010, 

lifted by the tide in the euro area, albeit with a lag. 

The economic prospects for the forecast period are 

clouded by the current financial crisis Œ marked 

inter alia by lower credit supply, unstable interest 

rates and falling asset prices Œ and weakening 

external demand. These shocks are expected to bite 

throughout the forecast period. They may be 
particularly hurting given the mismatch between 

aggregate spending and income observed for a 

number of years in the Portuguese economy, which 

has been reflected in the persistent and large 

external deficits and debt accumulation. In all, 

these shocks are expected to reinforce the need for 
balance sheet consolidation to lift savings in the 
years ahead, consequently constraining expansions 

of domestic spending. 
The rising service of relatively high households' 
debt levels, together with
 tighter credit conditions, 
will dampen consumption opportunities. However, 

in 2009, accelerating social transfers may give 

some support to disposable income, though not 

enough to offset a deceleration in labour income. 

Investment is expected to decline in response to 

gloomier demand prospects. In addition, the 

current financial crisis seems bound to trigger a 

deleveraging of corporate balance sheets, which, 

together with rising capital costs and stress on 

profits, will limit the room for investment. 
Exports growth is projected
 to be clearly hurt by 
the global downturn. Imports will trend down with 

weak activity and with imports of equipment and 

durable consumer goods tapering off. As a result, 

the trade deficit is expected
 to decline, helped also 
by more stable commodity prices, including falling 

oil prices in 2009. Yet the external debt service 

burden will put further pressure on external 

borrowing needs, such that only a marginal 

improvement is projected fo
r the external deficit. 
Against the current backdr
op, risks to the forecast 
scenario are unusually high. First, more substantial 

changes in financial markets may take a heavier 

toll than projected, especially on agents with more 

vulnerable balance sheets and hence trigger a 

faster spending adjustme
nt. Second, exports may 
suffer more if the downturn in key export markets 

turns out stronger than expected. 
Labour market, costs and prices without 
improvements After a decline in 2008, the unemployment rate is 
expected to rise in 2009
 as activity loses pace. 
Average wage growth has remained relatively flat, 

while the apparent labour productivity has receded 

in 2008 and, on account of poor employment 

creation, is expected only 
to very mildly accelerate 
over the remainder of the forecast period. Overall, 

sluggish productivity growth seems to be 

hampering gains in unit labour costs vis-à-vis trade 

partners. Hence, cost competitiveness will remain 

more or less unchanged, which will give limited 

help in correcting external imbalances. In 2009 and

    105 2010, inflationary pressures are expected to ease 
somewhat owing to the stabilisation of commodity 

prices and continued sluggish demand. 
Public finances remain weak In 2008, the general government deficit is forecast 

at 2¼% of GDP, down from 2.6% of GDP in 2007. 

The 2008 fiscal outturn benefits from one-off sales 

of concessions by the government, which, in total, 

lower its deficit by 0.4% of GDP. A higher tax 

revenue-to-GDP ratio has also helped the 

budgetary outcome: in particular, corporate tax and 

social contributions pro
ceeds have grown at high, 
albeit declining, rates. Some spending moderation 

has again been observed, notably on personnel and 

social transfers; howeve
r, with economic growth 
low, expenditure has risen in terms of GDP.  
For 2009, the government deficit is projected to 
rebound to over 2¾% of GDP. On the revenue 

side, the economic downturn is expected to take a 

heavy toll on tax proceeds. On the spending side, 

some acceleration is exp
ected on the back of 
higher social transfers, 
which reflect, first, the 
(partial) indexation of 
cash transfers to the 
previous year's inflation rate; second, recent policy 

measures, and, third, no further decline in 
unemployment benefits. However, tighter 
retirement conditions introduced in earlier years 

should relieve some pressure from spending. 

Finally, the budgetary execution will temporarily 

profit from the sale of concessions by the 

government worth some 0.3% of GDP, mainly 

associated with energy 
policy. In 2010, on the 
basis of the customary no-policy change 

assumption, the government deficit is forecast at 

around 3¼% of GDP reflecti
ng also the impact of 
the continued downturn on the budget. (
10) After falling in 2007, the government debt ratio is 
projected to resume it
s upward trend over the 
forecast period reaching 66½% of GDP by 2010. 
                                                          
 (10) There is a break between 2008 and 2009 in the series of 
government expenditure and reve
nue due to a change in the 
recording of payments to the government employees' 

pension scheme. Without such a break, both expenditure 
and revenue for 2009 and 2010 
would be some 1½% of 
GDP higher. The adoption of this methodological change 

in these forecasts is a technical assumption to be in line 
with the draft 2009 budget; the consistency of this change 
with ESA95 will be scrutinised by Eurostat in due time. 

While this change has no imp
act on the government deficit 
and debt levels, it would have a significant impact on a 
number of deflators, on nominal GDP (by around -1½%) 

and consequently on GDP ratios. Note, however, that these 

implications have not yet been considered in these 
forecasts.

106 Romania's economy is overheating, but growth is 
set to slow down. Nevertheless, the current 

account deficit will remain at worrying and only 

slightly falling levels. This, together with a 

worsening fiscal outlook, protracts the 

vulnerability to external shocks, particularly in the 

current period of global financial stress. 
Domestic demand boom set to slow down After reaching 6.0% in 2007, real GDP growth 

accelerated to 8.8% in the 
first half of 2008. This 
performance significantly exceeded expectations 

and has mainly been driven by a record surge in 

private consumption and gross fixed capital 

formation, following high real wage growth, a 

boom in domestic credit and sustained FDI 

inflows. A procyclical fiscal policy added to the 

domestic demand pressures. GDP growth was 

further boosted by an improvement in the trade 

performance, following significant investments in 

the manufacturing sector in past years and helped 

by a 15% RON depreciation since August 2007.   
From the second half of 2008, domestic demand is 
expected to moderate, leading to a still very high 

GDP growth rate of 8½% for the whole of 2008, 

also due to a positive one-off effect from 

agriculture, following the severe drought in 2007. 

Growth is anticipated to fall to 4¾% in 2009 and 

to 5% in 2010. Domestic demand is expected to 

slow down due to tighter credit conditions induced 

by monetary policy and the general global 

financial situation. In addition, it is likely to be 

affected by a decrease in consumer and investor 

confidence.  
External vulnerabilities remain Export growth is set to decelerate on the back of 

lower growth prospects in
 the euro area, which 
represents about 70% of all exports. However, 

further FDI-driven improvements in export 

competitiveness are likely to play a more 

prominent role towards 
the end of the forecast 
period. Hence, the current account deficit is 

expected to ease from almo
st 14% of GDP in 2007 
to around 12½% in 2010. Although FDI flows 

covered about 60% of the current account deficit in 

the first half of 2008, the reliance on short-term 

debt has increased over recent years, putting an 

additional premium on policies that strengthen 

investor confidence.  
Labour market, costs and prices The labour market continues to tighten, with 

unemployment decreasing to a record low of 

around 6% in the first half of 2008. Shortages on 

the labour market have also driven up gross wages, 

which have risen by 25% y-o-y in July 2008. 

Unemployment is expected to slightly pick up in 

2009 and fall back again in 2010. 
Wage and exchange-rate developments, 
compounded by supply-side shocks, have also 

fuelled an upturn in inflation, which is expected to 

edge up to 7¾ % in 2008, from 4.9% in 2007. In 

response, the main policy rate has been raised by a 

cumulative 325bps since November 2007 and new 

prudential rules on foreign exchange lending have 

been imposed. As both supply and demand 

pressures are expected to ease somewhat over the 

forecast period, inflation is projected to decelerate 

to 5¾% in 2009 and 4% in 2010. 
Risks to the outlook While the forecast scenario projects a rather 

gradual moderation of GDP growth, a sharper and 

more sudden adjustment cannot be ruled out. 

Trade, financial and confidence spillovers related 

to the international financial crisis could lead to a 

much faster reduction of both export and domestic 

demand. The crisis could also lead to a sudden 

reassessment of Romania's external vulnerabilities 

and fiscal policy stance by international investors. 

Associated higher exchange rate volatility would 

affect household and enterprise balance sheets,

    107 which are increasingly relying on foreign exchange 
denominated credits.  
Public finances The fiscal loosening continues and the budget 

deficit is expected to deteriorate from 2.6% of 

GDP in 2007 to almost 3½% of GDP in 2008. 

Several budget amendments have been 

implemented, which implied that windfall tax 

revenues have been used mostly for increasing 

current expenditure, in particular higher public 

wages, subsidies and social
 transfers. On the other 
hand, the public investment to GDP ratio is 

projected to remain broadly at its 2007 level. 

Despite some measures aimed at broadening the 

contribution base, social contributions are 

predicted to be negatively affected by a shift of 

pension revenues from the first to the second 

funded, pillar (the budgetary cost is estimated at 

0.2% of GDP) and by a gradual cut in the social 

contribution rate by 6pps in the course of 2008.  
In 2009, the deficit is expected to widen further to 
about 4% of GDP due to another increase in 

pensions, the full impact of the 2008 cuts in the 

contribution rate and the cost related to the second 

pension pillar (0.3% of GDP). Public sector wage 
increases are assumed to remain high.  
Under the assumption of unchanged policies, the 
budget deficit is expected to remain well above 

3½% of GDP in 2010. A pension reform cost of 

0.3% of GDP is included in the 2010 deficit 

forecast. However, there are considerable risks of 
significantly higher deficits, adding to the already 

expansionary fiscal policy in a context where 

macro-economic vulnerabilities would call for a 

more restrictive fiscal policy. First, there is a major 

risk that public wage increases will be 

substantially higher already in 2008, notably if the 

recent decision to increase teachers' wages by 50% 

is actually implemented. This could trigger similar 

wage claims in the rest of the public sector. 

Secondly, there is the risk 
that revenues could turn 
out lower, especially if there is a sharper growth 

slowdown. Thirdly, there could be further 

pressures for more public spending ahead of the 

forthcoming elections in 2008 and 2009. All this 

would continue the general dismal track record in 

budgetary planning and execution.

t108 Moderating activity in 2008 Economic growth remained strong in 2008, albeit 
well below the exceptional 
performance recorded 
in 2007. Real GDP increased
 at an annual rate of 
5.5% in the first half of the year, but with leading 

indicators pointing to some moderation for the 

remaining quarters, growth of 4.4% is projected 

for the year as a whole. 
Domestic demand was the driving force behind the 
continuing strong growth in the first two quarters. 

In particular, gross fixed capital formation 

remained buoyant, recording a 12.6% increase 

year-on-year. The construction sector expanded 

strongly, especially in non-housing construction 

reflecting ongoing motorway investment. 

Equipment investment was also buoyant. In view 

of the deterioration of the external environment 

and a decreasing trend in capacity utilisation, 

investment is expected to slow in the second half 

of the year. While continuing to be lively in the 

first half of the year, private consumption growth 

slowed in 2008 (+3.3%) because of high inflation, 

despite sizeable increases in nominal wages and 

still strong employment growth. Owing to the 

deteriorating external environment, export growth 

slowed considerably in 2008. Despite a significant 

moderation in import growth in view of lower 

domestic demand and reduced demand for 

intermediate goods for exports, the external sector 

is expected to make a negative contribution to 

growth in 2008. 
 Further deceleration in 2009, some recovery in 
2010 In 2009, growth is projected to slow to 2.9%, 
driven by a broad-based deceleration in investment 

activity. Motorway construction investment is 

expected to be slower compared to previous years 

and also housing and equipment investment is 

projected to moderate further. Private consumption 

growth should remain broadly unchanged from 

2008. It would be supported by slowing inflation 

and significant wage increases, while much lower 

employment growth is likely to have a dampening 

effect. The weak external environment is forecast 

to lead to a further deceleration of exports. Even 

so, the contribution of the external sector to growth 

is projected to be somewhat less negative than in 

2007-08 because of an 
even more pronounced 
moderation in import growth given more subdued 

demand in particular for investment goods. 
In 2010, some recovery is expected, driven by a 
pick-up in investment growth, especially in 

railways infrastructure. Growth in equipment 

investment should also quicken in line with the 

general pick-up in the economy. Higher 

employment growth and continued strong wage 

inflation should lead to
 a slight acceleration of 
private consumption. Exports should benefit from 

the expected recovery in 
the external environment. 
The high current account deficit (6.3% of GDP in 
2008) is projected to decline somewhat over the 

forecast period. However, th
is outlook is subject to 
risks as high wage and price growth going forward 

may further endanger competitiveness, which has 

already weakened since 2007. 
Risk to the inflation and employment outlook 
from high wage growth Having picked up markedly to an average annual 
rate of 3.8% in 2007, inflation peaked in mid-

2008, reaching 6.9% in 
July. Commodity price 
shocks played a significant role and were 

amplified by domestic factors such as strong 

demand pressures, with core inflation rising to a 

peak of 6.0% in April 2008. With the influence of 

rising commodity prices fading out and the gradual 

slowdown of activity setting in, inflation started to 

slowly come down in the 
second half of the year 
and is expected to aver

    109 highest in the euro area by
 far. For 2009-10 some 
further moderation is expected but Slovenia would 

remain among the worst inflation performers in the 

euro area. Risks to the inflation outlook are on the 

upside, in particular with regard to wage growth. 
The average nominal wage 
is projected to increase 
strongly in 2008 (+8.7%), reflecting inter alia 

nearly full indexation to 2007 inflation. The public 

sector wage agreement reached in mid-2008, 

which aims at reducing ﬁwage disparitiesﬂ, entails 

increases of 13% over 2008-2010. Together with 

the agreed sizeable wage increases in the private 

sector and further second-round effects in 2009 

based on the agreed backward-looking indexation 

of wages, this is expected to increase the average 

wage by 7.5% in 2009 and 6.9% in 2010. 
After the remarkable 3% employment growth 
recorded in 2007, a simi
lar increase was recorded 
in the first half of 2
008. Some deceleration is 
expected in the second half, leading to 

employment growth of about 1.8% for 2008 as a 

whole. The ongoing econ
omic deceleration and 
high projected wage increases should bring 

employment growth down substantially next year 

(+0.1%) before it picks up again in 2010. 
Small government deficits  The general government deficit is estimated at 

0.2% of GDP in 2008, better than the target of 

0.9% in the stability programme. The main reason 

for the more favourable outcome is a better-than-

expected 2007 outturn (a surplus of 0.5% of GDP 

compared to a 0.6% deficit in the programme). At 

the same time, however, additional expenditure 

was decided in the run-up to the elections, which is 

projected to be only partly compensated by a tax 

overshoot from recent strong economic activity. 
The deficit is projected to
 widen to around ¾% of 
GDP in 2009, broadly in line with the stability 

programme target. The impact of the economic 

slowdown and the agreed
 public sector wage 
increases would by and large offset stronger tax 

revenue from higher-than-
anticipated inflation. 
With government coalition negotiations after the 

recent elections ongoing, a (revised) budget for 

2009 is only expected to be adopted in spring 

2009. On a no-policy-change basis, the deficit 

should narrow to about ½% of GDP in 2010 due to 

the pick-up in economic activity. 
Debt as a share of GDP is expected to continue on 
a decreasing path, reaching about 20% by 2010.

110 Decelerating yet still robust growth in 2008 Despite strong growth in the first two quarters, 
economic expansion in 2008 may slow down to 

7% from 10½% in 2007. It should be mainly 

driven by domestic demand while the external 

growth contribution is 
likely to decelerate.  
Private consumption growth seems to remain 
resilient in 2008 against the backdrop of strong 

wage and employment growth while government 

consumption is increasing. Vigorous investment 

activity in construction is maintaining gross fixed 

capital formation growth at about 6½%.  
Export growth is about to slow down by some 6 
percentage points to roughly 10%. At the same 

time, as import growth is set to move in the same 

direction to around 9%, the declining trade deficit 

is likely to contribute to a further decline in net 

borrowing from the rest of the world.  
Domestic resilience in 2009 and 2010 GDP growth is expected to
 decrease to just below 
5% in 2009 before increasing again to some 5½% 

in 2010.  
It is especially domestic demand that is likely to 
drive the economy over the forecast horizon. Wage 

growth and further improvements in the labour 

market, albeit moderated, are projected to continue 

to support the somewhat weaker private 

consumption growth, which should, nevertheless, 

remain at roughly 5% over
 the forecast horizon. 
Gross fixed capital formation growth is also 

anticipated to slow down in 2009 before 
recovering in 2010. It should still remain healthy, 
as new infrastructure project
s in the public sector 
are expected to be started. However, since some of 

these projects have a private financing component 

(public private partnerships), financing difficulties 

and a possible reversal of investor sentiment might 

postpone their launch.  
The contribution of net exports should stay in 
positive territory. Against the backdrop of lower 

growth prospects in the euro area and the recent 

exchange rate appreciation, exports growth is 

projected to decline. Nevertheless, it is likely to 

continue to outpace import 
growth and, hence, the 
trade balance is anticipated to keep improving over 

the forecast horizon. 
Labour markets, costs and prices  After a healthy increase in the first half of the year, 

mainly due to improved employment opportunities 

in the construction sector, total employment is 

projected to perk up by some 2¼% in 2008 and by 

more moderate rates in 2009 and 2010. The 

unemployment rate is likely to decrease to below 

10% in 2008 and further decline in 2009 and 2010, 

albeit only marginally, as Slovaks working abroad 

are expected to increasingly seek job opportunities 

at home. Given strong public sector wage growth, 

unit labour costs are likel
y to increase by around 
4% in 2008. Thereafter, lower productivity growth 

should keep their growth at some 3½% and 2½% 

in 2009 and 2010. 
Average annual HICP inflation is estimated to 
increase to around 4% in 2008 and then to 

decrease gradually to some 3½% in 2009 and 3¼% 

in 2010. Annual HICP inflation has been gradually 

increasing since August 2007 as it was pushed up 

by rising food and energy prices. Favourable base 

effects at the end of 2008 should ensure some 

moderation in the inflation rate which will, 

however, be partly offset by a jump in the inflation 

contribution of tobacco prices. Moreover, 

regulated gas prices for households are expected to 

be increased at the beginning of 2009 in order to 

reflect past oil price hikes, thus counterbalancing 

disinflationary effects induced by recent strong 

exchange rate appreciation. Thereafter, 

decelerating food and ener
gy prices are likely to 
ensure gradual decreases in overall HICP inflation 

which should in 2010 be partly offset by

Public finances The 2008 general government deficit is likely to 

end up close to the budget target at around 2¼% of 

GDP. The January 2008 increase in excise taxes 

induced a large accumulation of stocks of 

cigarettes by consumers a
nd enterprises at the end 
of 2007 and thus resulted in a revenue-shortfall of 

some ½% of GDP in 2008. However, another 

hoarding of cigarettes motivated by a lower excise 

tax hike set for February 2009 should partly offset 

this negative revenue effect while resulting in a 

revenue shortfall of some ¼% of GDP in 2009. 
In addition, revenue-increasing measures in 2008 
such as a broadening of the corporate and personal 

income tax base and an increase in the maximum 

ceiling on social contributions are foreseen to 

generate additional revenue of around ¼% of GDP 

in 2008. Moreover, the temporary opening of the 

second pension pillar in the first half of 2008 

induced an outflow of some 7% of participants 

from the scheme and thus resulted in one-off 

revenue of around ¼% of GDP in 2008 as pension 
savings accumulated in previous years have been 
transferred from the second to
 the first pillar, i.e. 
from the private to the general government sector. 

On the expenditure side, farming subsidies are set 

to continue increasing substantially.  
In 2009, the general government deficit is expected 
to remain close to 2¼% of
 GDP. The 2009 budget 
proposal approved by the government foresees 

some expenditure growth restraint, mostly 

regarding defence spending and public sector 

wages. On the other hand, the budget also reflects 

the so-called social pack
age, including measures 
such as a forward shift in pension indexation from 

July to January 2009 and an increase in child-birth 

benefits requiring additional public expenditure of 

some ½% of GDP. Nevertheless, another 

temporary opening of the second pension pillar in 

the first half of 2009 could generate further one-off 

revenue of around ¼% of GDP.   
Under the customary no-policy-change assumption 
the budget deficit is proj
ected to rise to around 
2½% of GDP in 2010. The debt-to-GDP ratio is 

expected to increase slightly over the forecast 

horizon from 28¾% of GDP in 2008 to 29¼% of 

GDP in 2010.

t112 Buoyant, yet balanced growth over past years Finland has enjoyed an extended period of 
economic boom, with GDP growth reaching 4.9% 

in 2006 and 4.5% in 
2007, exceeding estimated 
potential growth by over 1 percentage point. 

Moreover, growth was free of distortions, avoiding 

the accumulation of major macro-economic 

imbalances or asset price bubbles. Also, inflation 

stayed one of the lowest among the EU Member 

States. Exports provided strong forward 

momentum, maintaining the current account at a 

sizeable surplus of close to 5% of GDP. 

Investment activity was particularly robust in 

2007, expanding by 8.5%, especially on account of 

non-residential construction and spending on 

equipment. Private consumption increased by a 

solid rate of slightly over 3% in 2007. Over the 

first half of 2008, the business cycle has taken a 

downturn. GDP growth has moderated to about 2½ 

%, led by slowing domestic demand.  
Strong wage growth, but inflation set to ease 
from the present high Even though the recent 
economic upswing created 
labour shortages in many sectors, wage growth 

remained contained by the previous general wage 

agreement. The current wage settlement from 

autumn 2007 resulted in notably higher wages for 

the following 3-year period, growing by 5½ % in 

2008 and slightly less thereafter. In the setting of 

slowing economic activity, it leads to a sharp rise 

in unit labour costs. Indeed, inflation has increased 

sharply over the past 
year, though mainly 
reflecting higher global food and energy prices. 

Additionally, a hike in energy and alcohol excises 
in 2008 contributed by about 0.3 pp. to inflation. 
Since August 2008, also core inflation (excluding 

energy and food) has acceler
ated, driven by a rise 
in healthcare fees. Annual 
inflation is forecast to 
drop from 4.1% in 2008 to slightly above 2½ % in 

2009 and further to below 2% in 2010, in line with 

the easing of global energy and food prices. 

Decelerating economic activity would counteract 

the upward inflationary pressures resulting from 

the wage hikes. A notable disinflationary effect 

will come in October 2009 from cuts to VAT rates 

on food.  
Economy to remain resilient  Economic growth is forecast to decelerate further 

in the course of 2008 and 2009, as the domestic 

slowdown coincides with the global downturn. In 

line with the rest of the 
euro area, consumer and 
business confidence indicators have plummeted 

over 2008. Economic activity is expected to slowly 

revive from the end of 2009 onwards as the 

external environment is assumed to stabilise. 

Finland is expected to w
eather the global financial 
market crisis relatively better than most other euro 

area countries, given the strength of its 

macroeconomic fundamentals, public finances and 

the financial sector, which is relatively well 

shielded from the direct
 impacts of the global 
crisis. Households' purchasi
ng power is forecast to 
remain at par with the previous boom years, 

supported by higher wages, substantial income tax 

cuts focused to 2009, moderating inflation and the 

labour market seen to remain resilient. 

Nevertheless, private consumption is still expected 

to slow in 2009 as households would increase 

savings in an environment of economic 

uncertainty.  
Investment is seen to contract in 2009, led by a 
decline in housing construction and more cautious 

business expansion in the aftermath of the 

financial crisis. Investment activity is forecast to 

resume in line with the economic recovery in 

2010. Also, the relative scarcity of housing in 

some regions would encourage residential 

construction. Net exports are predicted to weaken 

sharply in 2009 in line with faltering demand in 

Europe and the prominent forest industry facing 

major challenges from Russian raw-wood export 

duties eventually halting timber supply from 

Russia. Also in 2010, the relatively high wage

Labour market defying the economic slump Over the first half of 2008, employment growth 

has maintained the momentum gained during the 

boom years, still growing at almost 2% annually.  

Unemployment has declined further to close to 6% 

of the labour force. The labour market faces a 

fundamental change as the working age population 

would turn to a constant decline from 2010 

onwards. The resulting tightness in the labour 

market is seen to hold unemployment down even 

with weak employment developments. It is 

expected that in spite of below-potential GDP 

growth in 2009, employment and unemployment 

rates would hold steady at broadly present levels. 

Employment is initially supported by the high 

vacancy rates that built up
 during the economic 
boom years and the imminent decline in labour 

supply would encourage labour hoarding. 
Strong public finances afford tax cuts Expenditure growth was effectively contained 

during the economic upswing, providing the 

margin for substantial tax cuts while still building 
up a considerable surplus in public finances, 
amounting to 5.3% of GDP in 2007 and forecast to 

stay at broadly the same level in 2008. The surplus 

arises from the central 
government finances (about 
2% of GDP) and from social security (over 3% of 

GDP, which is used to further accumulate pension 

fund assets). The local government finances have 

remained close to balance. Over the forecast 

period, the trend of increasing surpluses will 

however be reversed. Expenditure is set to grow 

relatively faster than in the previous years due to 

higher inflation and wage growth in the public 

sector. On the revenue side, the government has 

decided to concentrate its 
income tax cuts package, 
amounting to almost 0.9% of GDP, mainly in 

2009. Coupled with a slow-down of tax revenue 

during the economic downturn, the general 

government surplus would decline by about 1½ pp. 

of GDP in 2009 and a by a further 1 pp. in the 

following year. The surplus would still amount to 

2½% of GDP in 2010. In view of continued budget 

surpluses, the government debt-to-GDP ratio is set 

to decline to below 30% by 2010.

t114 The economic slowdown worsened in 2008 Over the summer and early autumn months, hopes 
that the Swedish economy would be only mildly 

affected by the ongoing international financial 

crisis have rapidly faded. The second quarter of 

2008 saw growth in economic activity that started 

to slow in the first half of 2006 coming to a 

screeching halt, with real GDP staying flat 

compared to the first quarter. Driving the downturn 

since the cyclical peak has been a weakening of 

external demand in the wake of the unfolding 

global financial crisis. Exports actually fell by 

more than 1% in the second quarter.  
Thanks to relatively strong employment and wage 
growth and implemented tax cuts, household 

consumption held up reasonably well in the first 

half of 2008. Over the summer, however, 

consumer confidence has plunged dramatically to 

levels not seen since the crisis in the early 90s.  
Rising consumer price inflation, which reached a 
new high of 4.4% in September (year-over-year), 

has eroded the purchasing power of households 

and triggered a series of rate hikes from the central 

bank. The last hike took place as recently as in 

early September. To instil confidence in the 

faltering financial markets and to counteract the 

worsening growth outlook, however, the central 

bank has made an abrupt about-face and cut rates 

by a cumulative 100 basis points to 3.75% in 

October. Unusually wide spreads have also 

contributed to taking a large bite out of household 

disposable income and borrowing conditions have 

been tightened.  
Over the summer, business sentiment has also 
weakened significantly, weighed down by rising 

production and financing costs, a continued fall in 

productivity and a dwindling number of new 

orders. Moreover, the number of bankruptcies has 

started to pick up.
 The downturn expected to continue in 2009 While household consumption is likely to be 
supported by income tax cuts and a gradual fall in 

inflation in 2009, consumer pessimism and 

worsening labour market prospects are likely to 

lead to a period of subdued household 

consumption growth over
 the forecast period.  
Households entered the downturn with fairly 
strong balance sheets, but 
as borrowing costs rise 
and the labour market worsens, an increasing 

number of households are expected to encounter 

difficulties servicing their loans. Consumer 

sentiment and household wealth has also taken a 

hit from plunging stock markets, with the OMX 

index falling by about half since its peak last 

summer. Overall, the housing market has cooled 

down, with single-family house prices rising by 

only 2% over the three months to September and 

prices of flats falling by 5% over the same period.  
With gloomy prospects for economic growth, 
capacity utilisation is likely to fall with negative 

repercussions on investment activity. Therefore, 

gross fixed capital formation is likely to fall in 

2009 and only stage a muted recovery in 2010 on 

the back of an expected pick-up in exports. After 

growing by less than 1% in 2009, exports should 

gain some support from a gradual recovery in 

trading partners' economies and the lagged effects 

of a somewhat weaker Swedish krona. 
In sum, annual GDP growth is expected to slow 
down significantly in
 the coming year, 
decelerating from 1.0% in 
2008 to -0.2% in 2009. 
The subsequent recovery is expected to be gradual 

and muted, with GDP growth rising to 1.6% in 

2010.  
Unemployment is expected to rise rapidly in 
2009-10  As noted above, employment held up well in the 
first half of 2008. In the autumn, the situation has

   115 drastically changed with the number of announced 
lay-offs rising rapidly. The prolonged period of 

slow productivity growth observed over the last 

year and a half seems to a large extent to be due to 

companies not having adapted their workforce to 

the surprisingly weak demand. Only very recently, 

they have started to do so by cutting employment. 

In combination with the rapidly deteriorating 

growth outlook, this is expected to lead to a rapid 

rise in the unemployment rate, which is foreseen to 

rise to about 7½% in 2010. 
Fiscal surplus expected to turn into small deficit 
in 2010 Public finances recorded a strong surplus of about 
3½% of GDP in 2007. Despite various 

expansionary elements contained in the 2007 

budget, including reductions of income taxes and 

the abolition of wealth taxes, the strengthening of 

the labour market contributed to both higher-than-

foreseen tax revenues and lower expenditure. Due 

to the continued relative strength of employment 

growth and household consumption in the first half 

of 2008, public finances continued to register solid 

surpluses, despite the introduction of further tax 

cuts and the ongoing weakening of economic 
activity. 
A combination of slower economic growth (with 
its concomitant worsening of the labour market), 

sharp falls in share prices and the implementation 

of a fiscal stimulus package should lead to 

significant worsening of th
e fiscal balance over the 
forecast period. The Budg
et Bill for 2009, which 
was presented in September, contains tax cuts and 

spending increases of about 1% of GDP in total. In 

2008, the surplus is expected to hold up relatively 

well at around 2½% of GDP, but should then 

decline to ½% of GDP in 2009 and turn into a 

small deficit of about the same size in 2010. The 

fiscal policy target of havi
ng a 1% surplus over the 
cycle is, however, likely to continue to be 

respected. 
On the basis of continued general government 
surpluses and privatisati
on receipts to date, the 
government debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to 

decline further to around 32% in 2010.

116 Domestic demand begins to fall Economic activity in the first two quarters of 2008 
slowed sharply compared 
to the previous year, 
reaching standstill in the 
second quarter, and 
contracted by 0.5% in the third. (
11) In 2007 annual 
growth had reached 3.0%, following 2.8% in 2006.  
Notwithstanding the overall slowdown, growth 
continued to be supported mainly by private 

consumption in the first half of 2008, which 

however stagnated in the second quarter following 

a sharp increase in the first. Gross disposable 

income increased slightly in the first half of the 

year, with a notable rise in
 the second quarter. In 
the face of the high househ
old spending, the saving 
ratio nonetheless turned negative (-0.6%) in the 

first half, compared to an already low 2.5% in 

2007. 
Fixed investment fell markedly in the first two 
quarters, subtracting on average 0.4 percentage 

points from quarterly growth. The weakening was 

broad-based, driven by a fall in both residential 

and business investment, although general 

government investment provided a small stimulus. 

General government consumption contributed 

positively to overall growth in the first half while   

the build-up of inventories dampened it slightly.  
Net external demand provided a sizeable stimulus 
in the first two quarters on account of falls in 

imports and a slight improvement in exports. The 

current external balance s
howed marked swings in 
the first two quarters due to sharp changes in the 

income balance, leaving the current balance in 

deficit by 3.0% of GDP in the second quarter, 
following a deficit of 3.8% in 2007.  
Financial market conditions proved both tense and 
volatile throughout the year, culminating in sharp 

rises in money market spreads and a pronounced 

weakening in equity markets. Following the 

nationalisation of the Northern Rock (NR) bank in 

February 2008, the UK government took 

ownership of Bradford & Bingley (B&B), another 

UK mortgage lender, in late September. In 

response to mounting pressures on the banking 

sector, the government announced a banking 

recapitalisation plan on 8 October, accompanied 

by a sovereign guarantee of certain types of new 

short- and medium-term corporate debt as well as 

an enhanced extension of the Bank of England's 

Special Liquidity Scheme. 
Financial and housing markets depress outlook The economic outlook in the medium term is 

shaped by developments in the housing market and 

domestic credit conditions, both of which will 

weigh on domestic demand going forward. The 

historically large depreciation of the pound's 

nominal effective exchange 
rate since mid-2007 is 
likely to improve the price competitiveness of UK 

exports in the medium term. 
The central outlook envisages a marked fall in 
private consumption in 2009 and 2010, driven by 

more restrictive borrowing conditions and lower 

household wealth. The Bank of England's October 

2008 credit conditions survey showed that 

conditions for all types of lending to households 

and corporations tightened successively from the 

onset of the credit crunch through to the third 
Member States, The United Kingdom 
  117 quarter 2008, and would be restricted further in the 
fourth. The expected continuation of the 

downward correction in house prices will also 

weaken the collateral value of housing for secured 

borrowing, thus compounding the ongoing 

tightening of credit conditions. Private 

consumption will be dampened further as 

household spending responds to falling 

employment, which depresses disposable income, 

as well as to falls in net housing and financial 

wealth. The heightened unemployment risk is also 

likely to prompt increases
 in savings from their 
currently very low level.  
Fixed investment is set to fall sharply in both 2008 
and 2009 on account of a 
restrictive borrowing environment, as well due to a weak demand 

outlook in both the housing market and business 

sector. Faced with easin
g capacity pressures, 
business investment will fall until end-2009 before 

recovering, while housing investment will be cut in 

response to house price 
falls, low turnover and a 
weak and uncertain demand outlook. Government 

consumption will continue providing a moderate 

stimulus over the entire forecast period, with 

expenditure plans confirmed until 2010.  
The growth contribution of net external demand is 
expected to continue to be weakly positive. 

Imports are expected to slow in 2009 in line with 

domestic demand growth, while exports will 

increase only moderately due to an appreciable 

softening of export markets and some absorption 

of a weaker exchange rate in UK exporters' profit 

margins. (
12) Foreign income flows will be affected 
by writedowns of both UK assets and liabilities, 

but will continue to help finance the UK's 

substantial trade deficit and the external deficit is 

therefore likely to stabilise at slightly below 3% of 

GDP over the forecast period.   
In summary, growth in the UK economy is 
expected to slow to 0.9% in 2008. In 2009, a 

negative carryover and the contraction in domestic 

demand through the year will lead to a contraction 

of around 1%, followed by a gradual recovery in 

2010 to annual growth of around ½%. This 

scenario is subject to downside risks relating to the 

length and severity of financial market problems, 

which remain highly uncertain but are crucial in 

view of the scale of household indebtedness and 

the typically strong growth contribution of the 

UK's financial sector.  
Employment falls and inflation drops sharply The previously strong labour market showed early 

weakening, with employment starting to fall and 

unemployment rising markedly over the summer. 

Over the forecast period employment growth is 

expected to turn negative as a result of falling 

output. The supply of labour is also projected to 

increase at a slower pace, reflecting reduced 

immigration. As activity weakens the 

unemployment rate will rise by around 1½ 

percentage points over the forecast period. 

Average earnings growth remained stable at just 

below 4% in the first half of 2008, but is expected 

to moderate in 2009 due to labour market 

weakening. HICP inflation will remain high at 

above 4% in the final quarter of 2008, but will ease 

sharply in 2009 as economic activity and energy 

and commodity prices weaken.  
Government deficit set to reach 6½% of GDP 
by 2010/11 In the 2008/09 financial year the general 
government deficit is forecast to rise to 4¾% of 

GDP.(
13) Thereafter, public finances are expected 
to continue deteriorating, with the deficit ratio 

forecast to reach 6% in 2009/10 and 6½% in 

2010/11. The structural budget balance in 2008/09 

is set to deteriorate substantially, the greater part of 

the deterioration due to the weakening of 

economic activities yielding high tax intakes.

2 In 2007 the Bank of England made a loan equivalent to 1.9% of GDP to Northern Rock 
(NR) bank in the context of a rescue operation. Eurostat has taken the provisional view that 
the lending should have the government as the principal party of the transaction in the 
national accounts framework. If the loan were to be treated in this way, the debt-to-GDP 
ratio would be 46.1% at end-2007 and 44.9% at end 2007/08. The lending to NR has no 
direct impact on the government deficit in 2007/08. 
 In 2008/09 the revenue ratio is forecast to drop by 
almost a three-quarter-percentage point. Revenue 

from corporate taxation, which accounted for a 

quarter of tax revenue increases over the past five 

years, is expected to d
ecrease, primarily reflecting 
financial sector difficulties. An increase in 

corporate taxes as a resu
lt of higher profits from 
oil and gas extraction will be largely offset by 

lower profitability in the oil-consuming industries. 

Meanwhile, the sharp drop in property transactions 

and falling property prices will reduce stamp duty 

revenue. VAT revenues are also forecast to grow

007/08, due to an increase 
in the share of household expenditure on food and 

domestic energy, which are not subject to the 

standard VAT rate. 
Subsequent to the March 2008 budget, which was 
fiscally neutral, the UK authorities announced for 

2008/09 fiscal relaxation measures costing around 

¼% of GDP in foregone revenue. On the 

expenditure side, the forecast assumes adherence 

to the envelope set in the government's 2007 

Comprehensive Spending Review for the three 

years from April 2008, wh
ich foresees decelerating 
non-cyclical primary expe
nditure. By contrast, the 
sudden rise in inflation in 2008 will result in 

higher interest payments on index-linked gilts and 

sharply uprated social benefits in the near term.   
In 2009/10 and 2010/11, the deceleration in 
corporate profits will weigh down on tax revenue, 

with no significant improvement in the 

contribution of the financial sector. Personal 

income tax receipts are also expected to slow 

sharply, mirroring lower employment and a 

deceleration in earnings, 
while the contraction in 
real consumption expenditure and low inflation 

depresses indirect tax revenue. Social transfers are 

forecast to continue growi
ng at a high rate, in part 
due to a weak labour market. Interest payments in 
2010/11 are expected to
 increase by a third 
compared to 2007/08, 
mirroring a surge in 
government debt. The general government gross 

debt ratio is forecast to rise by more than 15 

percentage points, to over 60% by 2010/11, driven 

by the primary deficits and government capital 

injections to the banking sector. 
The deficit projections above could be subject to 
upside adjustment as a result of government 

decisions concerning the financial sector. The 

latter include the probable conversion into equity 

of debt owed by NR and the transfer of funds to 

Abbey following its takeover of B&B's retail 

deposits. The projections above do not include 

possible revenues and/or expenses from the 

government guarantee on interbank lending. The 

statistical implications of these operations are 

currently being examin
ed by Eurostat.

forecast
120 Growth started to decelerate as consumption 
moderated– Amid a rather solid economic performance, 
economic growth has starte
d to decelerate in the 
last quarter of 2007. In the first half of 2008, GDP 

grew by 3.8% year-on-on year, down from 6.8% in 

the same period a year before. The slowdown was 

largely due to a significant moderation of total 

consumption. Household consumption growth 

decelerated strongly, partly due to lower 

government transfers to pensioners, amounting to 

1.3% of GDP, and slowing credit growth. Public 

consumption growth also declined from a high 

base in 2007, fuelled by increases in spending in 

the run-up to the November 2007 general 

elections. At the same tim
e, investments remained 
strong, partly fuelled by construction activity and 

some major public investment projects. The export 

performance has started to weaken, reflecting 

lower demand from major EU trading partners. 
–and the slowdown will accentuate in 2008 
and 2009 The forecast predicts a si
gnificant slowdown of 
real GDP in 2008 and 2009 with downside risks 

being more elevated compared to the Spring 

forecast. The global financial crisis has so far had 

limited direct effects on the Croatian economy. 

However, spreads and borrowing costs have 

increased and a growth sl
owdown in the main EU 
trading partners will dampen prospects for exports 

and growth. Regardless of the impact of the 

external environment, growth will also be affected 

by specific domestic factors. The forecast predicts 

a significant moderation of domestic consumption. 
Debt repayments to pensioners will be 
considerably lower in 2008 and 2009 as compared 

to 2007. The recent rise in inflation has reduced 

real disposable incomes and consumer 

expectations have worsened. Wealth effects 

resulting from stock exchange losses may further 

dampen consumer spending. A continuation of 

relatively tight monetary policies by retaining 

existing credit controls will continue to affect real 

domestic credit growth. Public spending is likely 

to moderate from the high base of 2007, also in 

view of tighter fiscal constraints as revenue growth 

is expected to decelerat
e. Recent increases in 
public sector employment and wages may partly 

compensate for lower spending on goods and 

services. Higher domestic 
borrowing costs and a 
possible decline in confidence levels may dampen 

private investment activity. Moreover, it cannot be 

excluded that cross-borde
r lending, currently an 
important financing source of the corporate sector, 

will be adversely affected by the global financial 

crisis. Public investment is likely to slow down, in 

view of tighter financing conditions in 

combination with significant refinancing needs of 

the general government sector in 2009.    
External imbalances continue to widen as 
external demand drops The current account deficit has continued to widen, 
notably as a result of higher world energy and 

commodity prices and still strong import growth. 

Net external demand is expected to weaken in 

2008 and 2009, largely as a result of lower growth 

in the EU and in the main regional trading 

partners. At the same time, the growth of imports 

will not decelerate to the sa
me extent, as a certain 
level of investment activity would require 

sustaining a relatively robust level of imports. The 

contribution of net exports to GDP growth is 

forecast to remain in th
e negative territory. The 
current account deficit is expected to increase to 

above 10% of GDP and remain around that level, 

before it slightly improves towards 2010 as the 

growth of total exports is likely to recover. 
Inflation has risen strongly since mid-2007, but 
is expected to subside from the current peak Higher inflation was mainly due to a surge in 
agricultural, food and energy prices, but it was also 

partly driven by adjustments in administrative

    121 prices. Core inflation has also increased markedly, 
indicating that higher energy and commodity 

prices have led to second round effects. End-of-

period inflation has somewhat fallen since July, 

and some moderation of inflationary pressures is 

likely to occur in the event of a slowing economy. 

As a result, average infla
tion in 2008 is projected 
to reach 6.5%. In the 
short term, additional 
pressures may arise from further adjustments of 

administered prices, e.g. 
for gas. However, a sound 
monetary policy framework in combination with 

lower domestic demand and a stabilisation of 

world energy and commodity prices will help 

containing inflationary pressures during the 

forecast period. Overall, average inflation is set to 

gradually fall to 4% by 2010. 
Labour market developments not immune to 
slowdown Wage developments have so far been moderate 
and remained in line with productivity growth. 

However, the recent increa
se in average inflation 
and public sector wage adjustments may add to 

temporarily stronger wage pressures. At the same 

time, the economic slowdown would only provide 

for moderate increases in labour costs.   
Slowing growth and investment dynamics will 
have its impact on labour market developments.  

Employment growth is set to decelerate and the 

fall in unemployment (LFS) will decelerate. 
Fiscal consolidation unlikely to continue as 
envisaged  A particularly strong revenue performance in 2007 
led to a further reduction of the general 

government deficit (ESA 95) to 1.6% of GDP 

(from 2.5% in 2006).  However, including pension 

debt repayments, the deficit stood at 2.8% of GDP 

(3.4%). In 2008, the growth of public consumption 

is expected to moderate somewhat, but spending 

on subsidies, transfers and social benefits are 

expected to remain stro
ng, in the absence of 
policies to support an expenditure-led fiscal 

consolidation process.  At the same time, lower 

growth will affect revenue collection.  Therefore, 

the fiscal balance is forecas
t to slightly deteriorate 
in 2008 and in 2009, before it improves in 2010 on 

the back of stronger growth and revenues.

122 Growth has remained strong so far  After years of subdued growth, economic activity 
has continued to accelerate during 2007 and the 

first half of 2008, reaching real GDP growth of 

6%. The acceleration in economic activity was 

mainly based on stronger domestic demand. 

However, imports also 
rose sharply, partly 
reflecting higher expenditures for energy imports, 

but also due to machinery imports. 
The labour market situation continued to improve, 
albeit at a slow speed. Employment rose by some 

3½% during the first half of 2008, while the 

number of unemployed dropped by 1½%. As a 

result, unemployment declined to 33.8% in mid 

2008. However, youth unemployment, which 

accounts for some 20% of the unemployed, stayed 

at 56% of the labour force in this age group. 
Consumer price inflation 
started to decelerate by 
mid-2008, after higher food and energy prices had 

brought inflation close to 10% in the first half of 

2008. By September, average inflation had come 

down to 9.3%, compared to 1.4% a year before.  
The current account started 
to deteriorate by the 
end of 2007, reaching a deficit of 3% of GDP by 

the end of the year and of 13% of GDP by June 

2008. The main factors for 
this strong increase in 
imports were higher expenditures for energy and 

machinery. However, FDI rose sharply during the 

last year, reaching some 
9% of GDP in mid-2008, 
compared to 3% a year before. A considerable part 

of these capital inflows was related to investment 
of foreign banks in private local banks. 
Central government accounts registered a 
significant surplus of some 2% of GDP during the 

first half of 2008, mainly due to a strong revenue 

performance. In June and October, the parliament 

adopted supplementary budgets, envisaging 

additional expenditures amounting to some 2½% 

of GDP. The additional funds will be used to cover 

losses of the state owned electricity generation, for 

additional social and labour market related 

measures and for construction and renovation. The 

fiscal target for 2008 envisages a deficit of 1.5% of 

GDP, compared to a realis
ed surplus of 0.6% in 
2007. The general government debt ratio declined 

from 39% of GDP at the end of 2006 to some 25% 

at the end 2007. This drop was mainly due to early 

debt repayments.  
Lower global growth and constrained external 
financing will take their toll in 2009 In the last quarter of 2008 and during 2009, the 
economy is likely to experi
ence the indirect effects 
of the global slowdown, in the form of a more 

difficult export environment and lower capital 

inflows, affecting investment and private 

consumption. However, recent progress in 

structural reforms and the country's EU accession 

perspective should help to sustain a domestic 

driven growth momentum, benefitting from 

increased employment and consumer confidence.  
Overall, GDP growth is likely to slow down to 
4½% in 2009, which is about 1 percentage point 

lower than forecasted in spring. The probably more 

favourable growth conditions towards the end of 

the forecasting horizon should lead a slight 

acceleration of output expa
nsion in 2010, to about 
5%. However, in case of a more protracted 

slowdown in the country's main trading partners, 

economic growth could slow down further.  
Private and public consumption are seen to be the 
main sources for economic
 growth. The former is 
likely to benefit from the 
positive effect of recent 
social security reforms on employment and thus on 

income. Furthermore, the 
forecast expects workers 
remittances to remain an important support for 

households. Public consumption is likely to remain

the new government's ambitious programme for 

boosting economic growth and employment. 

Domestic and foreign investment is seen to 

respond to the overall less benign international 

environment, with a slowdown in investment 

growth to some 6% in 2009 and 8% in 2010. 

However, the external financing constraint will 

also result in a slowdown of imports. 
Unemployment will remain an issue, while 
inflation will slow down  Recent reforms in social s
ecurity legislation should 
improve the functioning of the labour market. 

However, the level of unemployment is expected 

to remain high. A large part of the new jobs are 

likely to be filled by so far unregistered labour, 

which will dampen the decline in the number of 

unemployed. Overall, employment is expected to 

increase by more than 3% on average in 2009 and 

2010, which will help to bring down 

unemployment to about 31% of the labour force.  
Once the inflationary impulse of higher prices for 
food, energy and basic materials will have petered 

out, annual inflation rates are likely to come down 

to some 7% in 2008. In view of the countries de-
facto peg with the Euro, the high trade integration 
with the EU and the still negative output gap, 

inflationary pressures are likely to remain low. 

However, in view of strong growth and the need to 

adjust electricity prices 
to cost-covering levels 
inflation will remain above EU levels, at some 

3½% in 2009 and to 2¾% in 2010.  
Public sector deficits are likely to rise  A more expansionary policy stance of the 

government, and the need to modernise the 

country's infrastructure an
d institutions will result 
in a shift from the close-
to-balance deficits or 
surpluses of the previous years, to higher deficits 

in the near future. In 2008, the deficit is expected 

to increase to about 1% of GDP, compared to a 

surplus of 0.6% in 2007. In 2009 and 2010, the 

budget deficits probably will be significantly 

higher. In view of the co
untry's sizeable external 
imbalance, good governance and maintaining a 

sound fiscal policy will be of utmost importance. 

The higher deficits could neutralise the positive 

base effect of strong nominal growth on the debt 

ratio. As a result, public sector debt would remain 

stable at some 23% of GDP or - in a less benign 

environment - could even start to rise.

t124 A tense political situation exacerbated the 
economic slowdown in 2008 The Turkish economy still lives in close symbiosis 
with politics. This became 
highly visible when the 
governing party was sued for anti-secular actions, 

and the Constitutional Court ruled against the 

requested ban, but imposed fines. In addition, 

domestic political uncertainties stemming from 

this court case were aggravated by the global credit 

crisis. GDP growth decelerated from 7% in 2006 

to 4
% in 2007 and further to 4¼% in the first 
half of 2008, chiefly due to weaker private 

consumption and lower investment. Imports grew 

at 6½% in the first half of 2008, up from 5% in 

2007.  Export growth rose from 6
% in 2007 to 
7% in the first six months of 2008. 
Inflation went up significantly in large part due to 
rising price pressures of energy and foodstuff. 

Consumer price inflation rose from around 9% in 

2007 to 11% in the third quarter of 2008.  
Labour markets appeared 
to react to the economic 
slowdown. The unemployment rate went up by 

over ½% in the first three quarters of 2008. The 

labour force participation rate remained still low at 

around 49¾% in mid-2008.  
The current account deficit rose Œ partly reflecting 
high oil and energy prices in the first half of the 

year - from 5
% in 2006 to 6½ % in 2007. Net 
FDI-inflows fell by one third, and covered only 
about 30% of the current account deficit in the first 
half of 2008. 
A slowdown in economic activity in 2009 looks 
inevitable, as a result of weaker external 

demand and tighter credit conditions The economy is in a better position than in the past 
to weather the global financial crisis, but the large 

external financing needs increase the vulnerability 

to shocks. A sharp slowdown in economic activity, 

coupled with the already ongoing correction in 

asset prices and the valu
e of the currency, looks 
inevitable. GDP growth is expected to fall 

gradually from about 3½% in 2008 to 2¾% in 

2009, due to the weakening consumer and business 

confidence and lower lending and spending linked 

to the global financial crisis.  A weaker external 

demand, including from the EU, should also 

adversely affect export growth.  
As from 2010, output growth is expected to 
accelerate to around 4% and become increasingly 

balanced, with higher private consumption and 

equipment investment growth mitigating lower 

public consumption growth.  Along with a 

declining inflation, growth of real disposable 

income will accelerate, wh
ich allows the private 
sector to increase consumption growth from 2
% in 2009 to 4½% in 2010.  Fixed investment is 

expected to rebound rapidly as a result of reduced 

macroeconomic and political uncertainty and 

declining real interest rates. Strong investment and 
higher consumption growth will lead to continued 

high growth of imports, in particular of consumer 

durables and capital goods.  Exports will 

accelerate and benefit from diversification and 

quality improvements resulting from earlier high 

investments. However, the large financing needs 

of the non-financial corpor
ate sector are a source 
of vulnerability, even as the slow down in growth 

and the decline in oil pri
ces are expected to ease 
the pressure on the current
 account. If the global 
credit crunch and the sl
owdown were to prove 
deeper and more persistent than we currently 

expect, the Turkish economy may have to 

undergo a more serious adjustment process.

    125 Labour markets and prices react to the 
rebalancing process in 2009 and 2010 In line with the economic slowdown, employment 
growth is forecast to decrease from 1% per year in 

2007 to 
% in 2009.  This will lead to a rise in the 
unemployment rate by one percentage point by 

2009. In 2010, stronger GDP growth will reduce 

unemployment by about ½ percentage point.  
Annual consumer price infl
ation is expected to fall 
to rates close to the end-year targets of 7½% by 

2009 and to 6½% by 2010.  While the monetary 

and fiscal policy mix in combination with falling 

energy and commodity prices will support the 

disinflation process, this may be Œ in particular in 

2009 Œ partially mitigated by the exchange rate 

pass-through stemming from the TRY-depreciation 

in 2008-2009. However, in 2010, a decline in 

inflationary pressures will allow a fall in interest 

rates and help improving the investment climate. 
The current account deficit is forecast to fall from 
6% of GDP in 2008 to 5½% of GDP in 2009, 
before growing to 6% of GDP in 2010 as imports 

start responding to increasing domestic demand.  A 

higher surplus of the services balance should help 

to maintain positive medium-term prospects in the 
external sector.  Public sector balances will be affected by 
higher interest rates, and the announced 

higher public spending Public sector balances will be affected by higher 
interest rates, and the announced higher public 

spending, including the South-Eastern Anatolia 

project and lower revenues as growth slows down. 

Public finance reforms will help to widen the tax 

base and to improve the efficiency of tax 

collection.  The general government deficit is seen 

to rise from 1¼% of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of 

2½% of GDP in 2009. In 2010, a budgetary deficit 

of 1¾% of GDP is projected as a result of a 

gradual fiscal tightening and falling interest rates.  
General government debt is seen to further decline, 
albeit at a decelerating pace. The government 

made progress in lengthening the average maturity 

and swapping foreign denominated into lira 

denominated debt. However, Turkey pays 

relatively high interest rates on its debt, which 

highlights the country's relatively high 

vulnerability to interest and exchange rate 

volatility and rollover risk.

128 Fiscal stimulus provided temporary support Following a slight contraction at the end of last 
year, the US economy performed better than 

expected in the first half of 2008 considering the 

bursting of the housing bubble, financial market 

dislocations, and soaring energy prices. In the 

second quarter, GDP expanded even at an annual 

rate of 2.8%. Most of this was due to sharply 

improving net exports which happened against the 

background of the dollar depreciation and 

softening domestic demand. But consumer 

spending held up reasonably well, too. This seems 

to have been the result of the earlier-than-expected 

disbursement of tax rebates which has pulled 

forward much of the expansionary effect of the 

fiscal stimulus adopted in February. However, 

residential investment continued its cyclical 

downturn unabated, business investment was 

subdued and payroll empl
oyment declined at a 
moderate rate. All this indicated a persisting 

fundamental weakness of the economy. 
The second leg of the downturn has started In the third quarter, the signs of recession became 

increasingly clearer, incl
uding a sharply rising 
unemployment rate and a collapsing ISM 

manufacturing survey. Most importantly, 

consumer spending declined in the context of 

falling employment and real wages, tighter credit 

conditions, and a negative wealth effect from 

lower house and equity prices. These headwinds 

for consumer spending are all set to intensify in the 

near term and consumer confidence has already 

plunged to long-time lows. 
The depression in the housing sector continues to 
deepen. Residential investment has fallen by 40% 

since the peak of the housing boom. Housing starts 

and new-home sales have fallen even more. Some 

nationwide house price indices are 20% below 

their historical highs in 2006. There is still a large 

excess of supply which continues to push down 

prices and building activity. At the same time, non-

residential investment, both in structures and 

equipment, looks precarious. Most indicators point 

to corporate retrenchment
. Furthermore, US export 
markets are slowing sharply and the dollar's 

appreciation since July
 (more than 10% in 
effective terms) will offset much of the gain in 

competitiveness acquired during the dollar's 

previous depreciation. 
Financial distress intensifies The dramatic worsening of the financial crisis in 

September and October is bound to depress 

economic activity further, but to an uncertain 

extent. Even before the recent escalation, financial 

conditions had tightened markedly despite a 

substantial easing of monetary policy. Interest rate 

spreads for riskier borrowers had widened and 

credit standards had become much stricter since 

the summer of 2007.  
Recession to last until mid-2009 The present forecast proj
ects a relatively mild 
recession which will lower the level of real GDP 

by 1% between 2008Q2 and 2009Q2. The 

economy is currently in 
the early stages of a 
negative feedback loop between a deteriorating 

labour market and declining demand. Most of the 

negative wealth effects from housing and financial 

markets have still to materialise. The 

malfunctioning financial system will exacerbate 

the downturn in the real economy. But a number of 

factors will counteract the strong negative 

momentum. First, monetary policy has been eased 

massively with the accumulated cuts in the fed 

funds rate since September 2007 and an 

unprecedented provision of
 liquidity. Secondly, 
consumer price inflation will decline as oil and 

other commodity prices stabilise at their new and 

lower level and with a large output gap exerting 

downward pressure on prices and wages. This will 

improve consumers' purchasing power in real 

terms. Thirdly, net export is likely to continue to

  129 contribute to GDP growth, although at a 
diminishing rate. Finally, the projected end of the 

recession in mid-2009 is based on a gradually 

declining drag from residential construction as the 

imbalances in the housing market are being 

eliminated. It is proj
ected that residential 
construction will fall to the level of 2.6% of GDP 

in 2008Q3, down from 5.4% at the end of 2005. 

Subsequently, residential construction should 

embark on a gradual recovery. 
Recession followed by subpar growth Annual growth in 2008 should still register 1.5% 

thanks to the carryover 
from last year and the 
performance in the first half of the year. Real GDP 

is projected to contract at 
an average annual rate of 
1% between mid-2008 and mid-2009. 

Subsequently, the growth rate is projected to rise 

only slowly, remaining significantly below its 

estimated long-term potential of about 2½% 

throughout the forecast pe
riod. This W-shaped 
growth profile (cf. Graph 5.1.1.) implies annual 

growth rates of -0.5% in 2009 and 1.0% in 2010.  
The labour market has already seen a sustained 
decline in payroll employment and a sharp rise in 

unemployment. In view of protracted subpar 
growth, the unemployment rate is projected to rise 
by 2 additional percentage points to 8.1% over the 

next two years. The increasing slack in resource 

utilisation combined with the stabilisation in 

commodity prices will push headline inflation 

down from 4.4% in the current year to below 1% 

in 2010. The fiscal deficit of general government 

has suffered from February's stimulus package and 

has already surpassed 5% of GDP, up from 2.9% 

in 2007. The recession and the various financial 

rescue operations will in
crease public deficit and 
debt significantly over 
the forecast period. The 
general government deficit is projected to reach 

9% by 2010. On the other hand, the current 

account will benefit from 
the downturn with the 
deficit falling below 3% of GDP. The household 

saving rate is projected to increase by more than 3 

percentage points from 2008 to 2010 as 

households try to restore their wealth. 
The downside risks to this forecast are 
considerable as it is premised on a relatively 

benign resolution of the financial crisis. The 

negative wealth effects from declining house and 

equity prices could also be much stronger than 

assumed here. Drastic policy measures may be 

adopted which adds extraordinary uncertainty.

130 Economic activity started contracting in Q2 
2008– After a strong first quarter of the year, GDP 
contracted by 3.0% q-o-q annualised in the second 

quarter. Private consumption fell sharply in the 

second quarter as higher food and energy prices 

eroded real income; real wages resumed their 

declining trend and consumer confidence collapsed 

further. After having plummeted in 2007 due to 

errant implementation of the revised building 

standard law and having 
increased significantly in 
the first quarter, growth in housing investment 

turned again negative 
in the second quarter. 
Moreover, business investment started to decline 

dramatically in the first ha
lf of 2008 as corporate 
profits fell and confidence disappeared. Lastly, a 

sharp drop in public investment also implied a drag 

on growth as the temporary suspension of the 

gasoline tax in April limited funding for road-

related spending. On the external front, exports 

declined for the first time since Q1-2005. Despite a 

decline in imports, net exports, which had been the 

main engine of the economy, made a negative 

contribution to GDP growth in the second quarter 

for the first time since Q4-2004. High frequency 

indicators and business surveys have continued to 

deteriorate during the summer, suggesting that the 

Japanese economy is in recession. 
–and the economy is likely to enter another 
period of anaemic growth While the Japanese banks and financial institutions 
were initially relatively shielded from the fallout of 

the US subprime crisis (mainly because they had 

adopted very cautious investment strategies 
following the banking sector crisis of the 1990s), 
the Japanese economy is now also adversely 

impacted through cha
nnels like weakening 
external trade, falling corporate profits, low 

confidence and deteriorating financial market 

conditions. The initially sound position of the 

Japanese banking system is, however, expected to 

allow for relatively accommodative financing 

conditions, thus lowering the likelihood of a broad 

credit crunch. 
Looking ahead, business surveys show a 
significant deterioration in business leaders' 

sentiment amid rising co
sts, squeezed profitability, 
concerns over sluggish domestic demand and 

weakening export markets.
 Against the backdrop 
of lower profits and the global economic 

slowdown, business investment is expected to 

decline in 2008 and part of 2009 before gradually 

recovering towards the end of the forecast horizon 

on the back of sound financial situation, little 

credit tightening and relatively resilient export 

markets (mainly in the rest of Asia). Construction 

activity is already showing signs of improvement. 

Barring a significant credit crunch, residential 

investment is forecast to 
stabilise. For households, 
with a situation in the labour market expected to 

deteriorate, wage growth will remain constrained 

while confidence will continue to be low. As a 

result, consumer spending is forecast to remain 

sluggish in 2008, to fall in 2009 and to regain 

some impetus in 2010 when the gradual economic 

recovery is expected to gradually translate into 

higher income. On the 
external side, though 
decelerating, emerging 
market economies (which 
account for almost half of Japanese exports) are 

expected to show some relative resilience to the 

global economic slowdown. However, as Japan's 

trading partners are also 
affected by the global 
slowdown, the contribution of external trade to 

Japanese GDP growth is expected to decline 

steadily, before regaining gradually momentum 

towards the end of 2009 and in 2010. All in all, 

GDP growth is forecast to 
slow from 2.1% in 2007 
to respectively 0.4% in 2008 and -0.4% in 2009 

before regaining some speed (at 0.6%) in 2010, yet 

still well below potential.

and energy, core inflation remained subdued and 

was even zero in August. The unfavourable base 

effect from soaring energy 
and food prices in 2008 
is forecast to gradually 
fade. In 2008, headline 
inflation is expected to average 1.6%. In line with 

the slowdown in economic activity, inflation is 

expected to gradually d
ecelerate to respectively 
0.8% in 2009 and 0.7% the following year. 
The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has kept its policy rate 
unchanged at 0.5% since February 2007. On the 

basis of the weaker outlook, the BoJ has toned 

down its normalisation policy strategy, implying a 

reversal to a more neutral policy stance. Most 

economists and market participants expect the 

policy rate to remain unchanged at this juncture 

but a rate cut cannot be ruled out if the downturn 

intensifies.  
An economic stimulus package with limited 
room of manoeuvre  On the fiscal front, some improvement had been 
registered thanks to cyc
lical revenue buoyancy and 
expenditure cuts in fiscal year (FY) 2007 (ending 

30 March 2008). However, in calendar year terms, 

the general government deficit is estimated to have 
increased from 1.4% to 2.2% of GDP in 2007.  
The authorities' medium term fiscal consolidation 
programme was presented in 2006. It foresaw two 

stages: first, a primary surplus (excluding social 

security) to be achieved by FY2011. Thereafter, 

the debt-to-GDP ratio would be progressively 

brought down. Following new downward revisions 

of the growth projections, the risk of missing the 

government's target have now materialised. Even 

in the most optimistic scenario, the primary 

balance is projected to remain in deficit in 

FY2011. Moreover, on 29 August, the government 

announced an economic stimulus package of 

11.7trl JPY (2.3% GDP). The bulk of the measures 

consist of subsidies for low-income households 

and industries, government loans and credit 

guarantees and measures to promote energy 

efficiency. With limited r
oom of fiscal manoeuvre, 
the package only included 0.3% of GDP of 

additional spending. The net impact of the package 

is therefore expected to be limited. Following its 

nomination on 24 September, the new government 

is envisaging an additional stimulus package. 

Unsurprisingly, discussions on raising the 

consumption tax rate have been postponed in this 

uneasy political context.

t132 Strong growth performance in first half of '08 GDP growth in the first nine months of the current 
year reached 9.9% y-o-y, with annual growth 

declining from 10.4% in the first quarter to around 

9% in the third quarter. Growth was in particular 

driven by still very high investment rates and 

rising private consumption, while the growth 

contribution of net exports declined strongly. 
In the fourth quarter of 2008, annual growth rates 
are expected to decline 
further, due both to a 
statistical base effect (very high growth rates in the 

same period of last year
) and the deceleration in 
global trade growth. Already in the months up to 

September for which customs data are available, 

Chinese exports to the US and to Japan in 

particular posted sub-average growth numbers. 
All in all, China's growth
 rate is still forecast to 
reach 9.7% in 2008. At the same time, however, 

2008 would mark the seco
nd year in a row where 
China's contribution to global economic growth is 

the highest in the world. 
With inflation decelerating fast, monetary 
easing has set in Consumer price inflation, which had reached a 
peak of 8.7% in February, has decelerated to a 

year-on-year rate of 4.6% in September. Against 

the background of a fast
 deceleration in global 
growth, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has 

lowered its benchmark lending rate by 27 basis 

points to 7.2% as of 16 September and additional 

cut of 27 bp. as of 15 October, as well as the 

reserve requirement ratio for smaller banks to 
16.5% as of 25 Septem
ber. Given the recent 
decline in commodity prices
 and the good harvests 
in China, the inflation rate should continue to 

decline, allowing the PBoC to ease monetary 

conditions further.  
Such a monetary easing would be in line with 
recent reports that the coun
try's leadership Œ which 
had so far given priority to the fight against 

inflation Œ has decided end of July to prioritize 

economic growth.  
Growth outlook for next year and 2010 Given the expected recessions in many advanced 

economies, 2009 should be the first year since 

2002 with a single-digit annual growth rate. 

Relatively low export growth (see chart) is 

projected to lead to a 
reduction in investment 
growth, bringing the overall growth rate to 7.9% y-

o-y. Growth should be supported by improving 

terms-of trade and still strong private consumption. 

Developments in the medium-term are likely to 

benefit from the projected easing in monetary 

conditions and the projected recovery in advanced 

economies, implying a slight acceleration in the 

GDP growth rate to 8.8% in 2010. 
The risks around the projected growth path are 
balanced. On the one hand, a stronger than 

projected slowdown in advanced economies 

coupled with a further fall in commodity prices 

would clearly constitute the biggest negative risk 

to this outlook. 
On the other hand, following a general government 
surplus of around ½ point of GDP in 2007, 

budgetary developments in the first seven months 

of the current year indicate a further improvement 

in government finances. Not astonishingly under 

these circumstances, the Chinese leadership seems 

to be discussing a fiscal stimulus package, which 

would not only consist of tax cuts for companies 

and individuals, but also of rising expenditure on 

infrastructure; reports both
 in the Chinese and in 
the western media talk about a total amount of up 

to USD 58 billion (or slightly more than 2 ½ pp. of 

GDP). Should such a programme be implemented, 

the current forecast for GDP growth would clearly 
have to be revised up.

   133 Trade surplus, current account – According to Chinese customs' data, China's trade 
surplus in 2007
 reached USD 262 billion (up by 
48% compared to 2006). 
According to the same 
source, Chinese exports we
re up by 22.3% in the 
first nine months of 2008 compared to the same 

period last year; with imports rising by 29%, the 

trade surplus decreased 
slightly to USD 153.2 
billion. The EU is now by far China's most 

important trading partner; the EU trade deficit up 

to September reached USD 118.4 billion, slightly 

lower than the US deficit of USD 126.8 billion.  
While the trade surplus ha
s decreased slightly, FDI 
in the first six months of 2008 was up by 39.9% on 

the year, reaching USD 74.4 billion, partially 

explaining the strong increase in foreign exchange 

reserves from USD 1.53 trillion end of 2007 to 

USD 1.9 trillion end of |Sep
tember this year (of 
which at least USD 500 b
illion in US treasuries).  
With export growth now projected to decelerate 
considerably while import growth is likely to 

remain relatively buoyant, both the trade surplus 

and the current account are likely to decline 

considerably in nominal and relative terms.  
Worst-case-scenario Under such a scenario, global trade would 

decelerate much more th
an currently projected, 
forcing many of China's manufacturers to cut 

profits even more and then to shut down. Some 

evidence of this happeni
ng is already observed 
(e.g. FerroChina). Under these assumptions, China 

would join other countries in having to face severe 

economic, political and social developments. As 

already pointed out, however, in terms of monetary 

and budgetary policies, China's point of departure 

seems much better than that of other emerging 

economies, let alone most advanced economies.

134 Norway continues to enjoy solid economic 
growth... Norway continued to enjoy dynamic growth for 
the fourth year in a row, with GDP growth for the 

mainland reaching the second highest level in 10 

years in 2007 at 3.7%. Growth in Norway is 

broadly based, sustained by an expansion in almost 

all demand components and in most main 

industries. Driven by domestic demand, which is 

partly offsetting the slightly less favourable terms 

of trade, the real GDP growth rate for 2008 is 

forecast to moderate to 2.6% and further down to 

1.9% in 2009 thus slightly narrowing the output 

gap. For the year 2010 a rebound to higher growth 

at 2.1% of GDP is expected whereas the output 

gap will remain roughly the same at around 2%. 
Domestic activity will continue to be the main 
driver of growth, with relatively low interest rates 

fuelling strong private consumption. The latter is 

expected to keep growing at annual rates up or 

above 2.5% until 2010 included. The financial 

crisis will effect Norway mostly through the  

supply of capital, which has declined, and it is 

more expensive and more difficult for banks, 

enterprises and households to obtain funding. The 

large investments in the oil and gas sector that 

were spurred by soaring oil prices are completed in 

the course of 2008, implying a continuation of the 

deceleration in investment growth that started 

already in 2007. 
Norway is expected to continue 
its expansionary fiscal policy, which is mainly 

funded through high oil revenues and tax 

increases. Government cons
umption is expected to 
decelerate while public in
vestments remain strong. 
–however unemployment is on the rise The expansion in economic activity has led to a 
decline in unemployment,
 which has reached the 
lowest level in 20 years despite high labour force 

growth. Unemployment is 
forecast to remain low, 
but to inch up slightly in the years 2008 until 2010 

included. Inflation peaks in 2008 close to 4% 

however is expected to decrease to around 2% 

during the forecast years. 
The outlook for Switzerland remains positive... The economic upturn that started four years ago 

has ended in 2007. The upswing, which was 

initially driven by foreign demand, has become 

more broadly based over the last two years thanks 

to a significant expansion in domestic demand. 

Further supported by an accommodative monetary 

policy, GDP growth in 2007 was largely driven by 

domestic demand. However, the global slowdown 

and the expected recession in the US will limit 

GDP growth in Switzerland significantly to 1.8% 

in 2008 and 1.2% in 2009, followed by a slight 

rebound to 1.6% for 2010. The slowdown in world 

growth is expected to dampen foreign demand for 

Swiss goods and services this year and next. 

Consequently, real growth in exports of goods and 

services is expected to d
ecelerate significantly in 
the forecast years. Imports grew at a slower pace 

than exports in 2007 but are likely to match and 

overtake export growth in
 the forecast years. 
Overall external trade should continue to make a 

positive, albeit declining, net contribution to 

economic growth over th
e whole forecast period. All in all, GDP growth in 2008 reflects both 
relatively strong external demand and sound 

investment growth, mirroring a healthy business 

environment. The capacity of the domestic 

economy to stimulate growth can be observed 

through the remaining strong demand for imported 

consumer and capital goods. Stable growth in 

consumer spending will be based on continued 

growth in incomes. Though the financial crisis 

does not seem to have a significant impact on the 

economy, corporate investments and consumer 

spending will be affected and possibly postponed 

to some extend. Through the lower growth rates 

GDP will approach potential growth, eventually 

possibly turning the small positive output gap into 

a negative output gap towards the end of 2009.

   135 –while unemployment continues to be low Employment is expected to increase slightly in the 
forecast period, while the unemployment rate is 

expected to remain low at around 3.0%. The 

prospects for employment and wage income 

declining but remain positive and are likely to 

support consumer confidence, which in turn should 

provide support to private consumption.  
Iceland, ripples in the water or a sinking ship– After a period of high growth rates supported by 

large investment projects and strong domestic 

demand, which have generated significant 

imbalances, Iceland is now facing a period of 

macroeconomic adjustment. Demand pressures in 

the economy decline sharpl
y in 2008 and onwards, 
due to very high interest rates, slowing private 

consumption and expected ongoing weakness of 

domestic demand. Incomes are under pressure and 

specifically pensioners are facing benefit cuts 

following the worsened position of the Icelandic 

pension fund. Unemployment is set to increase 

significantly this year following the impact of the 

crisis on the banking sector specifically, tripling 

the number of unemployed.  Inflation is peaking in 

2008 and expected to remain high in 2009 and 

2010. The current account deficit in 2008 is high at 
around 20% of GDP but is expected to decline 
significantly following decreasing imports. 
The financial crisis is gravely worsening this 
period of unwinding unbalances. GDP is expected 

to already shrink in 2008 and even more 

significantly in 2009 to return to modest growth 

only in 2010. Declining domestic demand and a 

worsening labour market are turning the positive 

output gap in 2008 into a negative gap in 2009 and 

2010. 
The uncertainty generated by the current credit 
crisis and the massive deva
luation of the krona as 
well as the increasing unemployment entail a 

significant downside risk,   which could easily lead 

to a much higher GDP contraction in 2009 and 

onwards. Another factor of uncertainty is the 

possible effect of international rescue operations. 

The impact of a combined IMF Œ EU financial 

assistance programme may 
dampen the effects of 
the crisis on GDP growth 
for the forecast years, 
while its absence could lead to worsening 

conditions for the Icelandic economy.

136 Uncertain growth prospects 2007 was the 9
th straight year of strong growth for 
Russia, reaching 8.1%, wh
ile the average 1999-
2007 is 7%. This strong performance was 

sustained until the summer of 2008. GDP growth 

was around 8% in the first half of 2008, supported 

by an investment growth of 17%. Starting in the 

summer, a deceleration was observed, initially due 

to a base effect, but later likely due to the 

transmission of the increased financial instability 

into the real economy. A
ccording to preliminary 
estimates, GDP growth during January-September 

fell, albeit somewhat marginally, to 7.7%. 

Similarly, the growth rate of investment is 

estimated to have fallen to 13% during the same 

period. With the expected slowdown during the 

last quarter of 2008, the 
forecast for the whole of 
2008 is a robust 7.1%
. The deceleration is 
expected to last until mid-2009, resulting in a 6% 

growth, increasing to 6.5% in 2010, although the 

margin of uncertainty of 
the forecast has increased. 
External position and unstable capital flows The effects of greater ca
pital inflows in the 2007 
growth performance are highlighted by changes in 

the current account. The 
Central Bank of Russia 
(CBR) estimate of 
net capital inflows for 2007 is 
close to EUR 63.5 billion, far above the figure for 

2006. This was largely fuelled by borrowing by 

Russian companies and especially banks: this 

increased foreign borrowing 
is one of the elements 
behind the current instability of the Russian 

banking system. For 2008 estimates point to a 

significant capital outflow (perhaps as high as 

EUR 90 billion for the period August-October), 
while CBR preliminary figures indicate a EUR 
11.9 billion outflow for the July-September period 

- 95% of which out of the banking sector - but also 

showing a marginal pos
itive inflow of EUR 0.6 
billion for the first nine months of 2008. The 

capital outflow was initially driven by the conflict 

with Georgia in early August, and picked up speed 

with the ongoing global financial instability. 

CBR™s reserves (the third largest in the world) 

stood at around EUR 400 billion by mid October 

2008, but in USD terms (as both the euro and the 

rouble have fallen towards the USD) this figure is 

a 13% fall since their position at end-July. 
The instability in the capital account described 
above has been partially compensated by an 

increase in the trade surp
lus, due to higher oil 
prices. The price of the Urals Blend was close to 

USD 90 by early 2008, above USD 130 by July 

2008, but fell again to around USD 70 in mid 

October. Up to September 2008 the rise in oil 

prices generated a record trade surplus of USD 153 

billion, or a 68% increase in nominal USD over the 

same period of 2007 (nevertheless, the recent fall 

in oil prices to the levels observed in October 2007 

shall reduce the 
growth rate
 of the trade surplus 
for the whole of 2008). In 2007 the current account 

surplus was around 6% of GDP, and the trade 

surplus 10%. Due to higher
 oil prices, the forecast 
projects an increase of both 
aggregates in 2008, to, 
respectively, above 6.5% and 12%. At the same 

time, the forecast fall in oil prices is expected to 

reduce swiftly both the trade and the current 

account surplus during 200
9-2010, which are to 
fall to 3.9% and -0.3%, respectively. 
A still strong fiscal surplus  The budget surplus reached 5.5% in 2007. Again 

due to oil prices, this figure is expected to increase 

in 2008 to 6.4%. Nevertheless, the surplus is 

expected to decline to below 3% of GDP by 2010. 

Additionally, the flurry of measures announced in 

support of the Russian financial system may too 

have 
some
 future fiscal effects (see below).

recent fall in oil prices, 
as Russian stock markets 
are dominated by stocks from energy and 

commodity firms). This said, the events observed 

in September-October are clearly related to the 

spreading of instability from developed markets 

into emerging ones such as Russia, so far 

considered as a relatively ﬁsafe havensﬂ. As a 

result, Russia™s two main stock markets, MICEX 

and RTS, are both down by over 70% since the 

start of the year (see graph 
in the previous page).  
Currently, debt markets 
in Russia seem largely 
shut to second and third-tier banks, bar the access 

to CBR and Ministry of Finance (MinFin) 

injections of liquidity. The CBR also reduced 

reserve requirements, to release extra liquidity. In 
addition, the MinFin is holding frequent auctions 
of fiscal funds for on-lending to banks. The 

government also announced a series of other 

measures, including cuts in crude oil export duties, 

an extension of the bank deposit insurance scheme, 

delayed payment of certain taxes, large support 

packages for the re-financing of maturing external 

debt and provision of long-term financing. The 

support packages announced until mid October are 

estimated to reach over 12
% of GDP, albeit not all 
of these measures imply fiscal costs. 
Overall prospects till 2010 Overall, Russia™s growth is expected to remain 

strong during 2008-2010, 
albeit a deceleration from the very high rates observed recently is 

expected. As a result, GDP growth is likely to 

average 6.5% in 2008-2010, although there is a 

considerable degree of un
certainty concerning the 
forecast for 2009. Inflati
on will fall back to below 
double-digit levels only gradually. The budget 

surplus shall fall below of 3% of GDP by 2010, 

while Russia is also forecast to have a reduction of 

both trade and current account surpluses.
