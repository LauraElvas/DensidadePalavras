FINANCIAL AFFAIRS                                              February 2008 Interim forecast  Press conference of 21 February 2008 
Interim forecast, February 2008 
  
 
 The current headwinds start to take their toll in the EU The global economic situation and out
look remain unusually uncertain at the start of 2008, in view of 
continuous distress in financial markets, a more marked US slowdown and soaring commodity prices. 
So far, the European economy has weathered these 
headwinds relatively well, but EU economic 
activity is set to moderate.  
The initial resilience of the EU and euro-area econom
ies follows from their sound starting position when the turmoil broke out. Household and ent
erprise balance sheets have improved markedly in 
recent years and both the internal and external balan
ces are sound. However, confidence indicators 
peaked and have been on a steady declining path 
since last summer. Against this background, a 
certain easing of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2007, to 0.5% from 0.8% quarter-on-

quarter (QoQ) in the EU (and to 0.4% QoQ in the 
euro area), did not come as a surprise.    
GDP growth has now been revised down by 0.4 percentage point (pp.) in both the EU and the euro 

area this year. The update of the outlook fo
r the seven largest EU economies results in a GDP 
projection of 2.0% for the EU and 1.8% for the euro
 area. The revision is particularly pronounced for 
Italy, where the sharp contraction in industrial pr
oduction in the last quarter of 2007, as well as the more marked deterioration in th
e services sector confidence indicator,
 weighs on the annual average for 2008. Growth rates remain firm in Poland and the Netherlands.  
Consumer price inflation has picked up in recent m
onths, fuelled by high commodity prices. The 
outlook for inflation has been revised up by ½ pp. in
 both areas to 2.9% in the EU and 2.6% in the 
euro area. Inflation expectations have also increased somewhat late
ly and currently stand close to the high levels reached in 2001. But so far, however,
 second-round effects have been contained. 
 A bleaker global outlook  
The global economic situation and outlook remain 
unusually uncertain at the start of 2008. This 

follows from the ongoing turmoil in financial 
markets, a sizeable deceleration of growth in the 
US economy, where the slowdown has spread 

beyond the housing market, and soaring commodity 
prices. First, the hopes that the financial turmoil might be 
relatively short-lived and that it would gradually 
peter out Œ which was a crucial assumption in the 
Commission's autumn 2007 forecast Œ have now 

given way to a realisation that further problems 
may still be ahead.  
Second, following a sharper downturn in the US 
economy, global growth is expected to slow to 

below 4% this year. This represents a more marked 
easing than expected in the autumn forecast. 
However, the difference also
 reflects the impact of 
revised purchasing power parities on the starting 
position. This revision trimmed global growth by 
about ½ pp. during 2005-2007. 
Third, a weaker outlook for growth in the 

developed world has allowed oil prices to ease back 

from record highs at the tu
rn of the year. However, 
oil prices remain high and volatile, driven by 

limited spare capacity and geopolitical tensions in 

oil-producing countries. Based on futures, the oil-
price assumption is revised up by 15% in USD- 
terms compared to the autumn outlook.   
 International financial system remains fragile
  The functioning of several key credit markets has 
been severely impaired since last summer. The 
current distress was triggered by a rapid increase in 

defaults in the US subprime mortgage market. 
Exposure to these losses spread to financial 
institutions around the world, as sub-prime loans 

were mixed with different types of loans or 
receivables into complex financial products, such as 
collateralised debt obligations (CDO) and passed on 

to other financial institutions. Investor confidence 
has been seriously undermined by the uncertainty 
regarding the ultimate scale and location of these 

losses.  Interim forecast, February 2008 
    Central banks have responded effectively to the 
turmoil by ensuring adequate liquidity in the 
banking system in a series of interventions in the 

second half of 2007. These actions have stabilised 
liquidity since the start of 2008 and allowed the 
short-term interest rates to come down markedly 

(together with the impact of a sizeable monetary 
easing in the US). However, markets are not yet 
functioning properly. This is reflected, for example, 

in inter-bank spreads remaining at elevated levels, 
at about 35 basis points (bp) compared to a long-
term average of 20 bp.  
The Ecofin Council has also responded by 
endorsing a roadmap for action to follow-up on the 
turmoil (October 2007), where work is now well in 

progress. These actions are structured around the 
following four main objectives:  
(i) Improving transparency in the market
, notably 
with respect to banks' exposures relating to 
securitisation and off-balance sheet items;  
(ii) Upgrading valuation standards
 to respond in 
particular to the problems arising from the 

valuation of illiquid assets;  
(iii) Strengthening the EU's prudential framework 
for the banking sector, e.g. with respect to the 
treatment of large exposures, banks' exposures to 
securitisation and liquidity risk management; and 
(iv) Investigating structural market issues
, such as 
the role played by credit rating agencies or the 
"originate and distribute" model. 
At the international level, work has also been 
initiated by e.g. the G7 Finance Ministers to 
diagnose the causes of the financial turmoil and to 
make appropriate recomm
endations. In response, 
the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) has set up a 
Working Group on Market and Institutional 
Resilience with a view to (a) developing a diagnosis 

of the causes of recent events; (b) identifying the 
weaknesses that merit attention from policymakers; 
and (c) recommending actions needed to enhance 
market discipline and institutional resilience.  
The working group's initial findings, presented 
earlier in February, are 
consistent with those 
identified in the ECOFIN roadmap. The IMF has 
also been invited to report on the threats to the 
global economy from financial-sector 
developments, in parallel to the report by the FSF, 

at the IMF/World Bank meetings in April 2008.

 Meanwhile, problems in other parts of the financial 
markets have intensified. Credit ratings for CDOs 
have come under renewed pressure as defaults 
spread to higher-quality segments of the US 
mortgage market as well as to credit-card debt and 
automobile loans. A growing concern about the 

financial health of bond insurers (so-called 
monolines), which underwr
ote much of the credit 
risk linked to CDOs, now adds to the pressure.  
Financial losses incurred by banks, which so far 
amount to around • 100 bn., have triggered a 
generalised tightening in lending standards. While 
some of the larger banks have been able to 

recapitalise, often from so
vereign wealth funds, 
their balance sheets remain vulnerable to a further 

deterioration in the quality of assets or in 

securitising outstanding loans to the private equity 
sector.  A tightening in lending conditions, together with a 
reduction in investor's risk appetite, implies a 

reduced availability of credit for businesses and 
households going forward. This has reinforced the 
expectations of a more marked slowdown in the 

US, and, to a large extent, also in the EU 
economies, reflected in bot
h a marked fall in long-
term interest rates and a sharp correction in equity 

prices since the beginning of this year (Graph 1). A 
certain spill-over of the financial turmoil (and its 
impact on the US economy) is now noticeable also 
in emerging markets, albeit to a lesser extent. 
 2 Interim forecast, February 2008 
    Diverging growth trends with developed economies 
more affected 
The financial turmoil was initially contained to the 
financial markets themselves. The impact on hard 

(essentially backward looking) data has, so far, 
been limited. However, soft data such as consumer 
and investor confidence ha
ve been on a declining trend since last summer,
 albeit with marked 
differences across sectors 
and countries (see also 
the section on survey indicators). The deterioration 

of confidence has now started to affect the real 
economy.  
In the US, recent data not only point to a more 
severe contraction of the housing sector, but also to 
a larger spill-over into the rest of the economy. The 
financial distress has caused a sharp tightening in 

lending conditions for many borrowers, which 
reinforces this process.
 Quarterly GDP growth 
dropped to 0.2% in the last quarter of 2007. 
According to some analys
ts the US economy is 
already in, or at the brin
k of, a recession. However, 
net exports are providing considerable offset to 
weakness in domestic demand and the US may still 
avoid a recession.  
Looking ahead, it is crucial to assess the impact of 
the recent monetary and fiscal easing in the US. 

The Federal funds rate has been lowered sharply to 
3% in January and an 'economic stimulus act' has 
been adopted that provides households with 

significant additional spending power, mainly in the 
form of tax rebates. Together with the investment 
incentives for business, the 
fiscal easing amount to some 1.2% of GDP. These measures will provide a 

certain stimulus to activity, especially in the second 
half of 2008, but the question is to which degree. 
Household finances are stretched during the current 
housing downturn and the propensity to spend may 

well be lower than during previous periods with tax 
cuts. Taking this into acc
ount, the forecast for US 
GDP growth in 2008 is revised down by almost ½ 
pp. to some 1¼% in 2008.

 The outlook for 
Japan
 is also bleaker this year. 
Despite a surprisingly good last quarter of 2007, 
where net exports and investment boosted the 

economy, Japan's GDP growth is expected to 
decelerate in 2008 amid weak personal 
consumption (consumer's confidence deteriorated 

sharply in recent months) and the drag that a 
deteriorating international economic environment 
will exert on net exports. On the positive side, 

construction investment, which plummeted in the 
second half of last year because of the introduction 
of new safety regulations, should rebound in 2008. 
 In China,
 economic growth has, yet again, surprised 
on the upside at 11.4% in 2007. However, growth 
rates have probably moderated somewhat in the 
course of last year. Reflecting a stronger-than-

expected slowdown in developed countries, real 
GDP growth is expected to decline to around 9½% 
in 2008.   
Overall, the global economy is expected to slow by 
0.8 pp. in 2008 compared to 2007, markedly more 
than expected in the autu
mn forecast (excluding the 
impact of revised purchasing power parities, which 
lowered growth by about ½ pp. during 2005-2007).  
However, it is important to recall that growth has 
been exceptionally strong 
in recent years. In a 
historical perspective, 
the projected global GDP 
growth remains about ½ pp. above the long-term 

average.  
  3Interim forecast, February 2008 
    Oil prices expected to stay high
 A weaker outlook for growth in the developed 
world has allowed oil prices to decline somewhat in 
the most recent weeks. Prices have come down 

from a level of close to 100 USD/bl. at the turn of 
the year. However, oil prices remain high and 
volatile, driven by limited spare capacity and 

geopolitical tensions in oil-producing countries.  
For the year 2008 as a whole, oil prices are 
assumed to average 90 US
D/bl. according to the futures market (i.e. up by 15% compared to the 
autumn outlook, see Graph 
2). For the euro area, 
the impact of higher oil prices is partly cushioned 

by the recent appreciation 
of the euro. Measured in 
EUR, the change is limited to 11%.  
In the last three years, oil prices have almost 
doubled when measured 
in EUR and more than 
doubled in USD-terms. While the past increase in 
oil prices has contributed to a higher inflation and 
has dampened real activity, it is noteworthy how 

relatively resilient the global economy remained Œ 
ahead of the outburst of the financial turmoil last 
summer.
1   Growth in Europe also moderating towards the 

end of 2007– 
The year 2007 started on a strong note in the EU 
and the euro area, on 
the back of solid 
fundamentals. GDP growth was driven by strong 
job creation that supported private consumption 
together with robust investment growth. In addition, 
the absence of external imbalances and, 
comparatively low public deficits placed the 
European economies in a good position to weather 

the headwinds from a gradually deteriorating global 
outlook in the course of 2007. 
                                                   1 Estimates from the Commission's QUEST III model, 
which is a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
(DSGE) model, point to a lower impact on real activity 
than earlier model simulations have suggested, but also to 

a higher pass-through to infl
ation. A more detailed 
description of the model and its simulation results will be 

presented in the upcoming spring 2008 forecast.

 GDP growth came in at 0.8% in both regions in the 
third quarter, thus above potential and higher than 

projected last autumn. The pick-up was broad-
based across the largest EU economies covered by 
this update.  
Growth in the third quarter was exclusively driven 

by domestic demand. Gross fixed capital formation 
rebounded strongly as activity in the construction 
sector recovered and investment in equipment 

continued to expand rapidly.  Private consumption 
confirmed the positive indications observed in the 
previous quarter, while 
net external trade was a 
drag on growth, particularly in the EU.  
As anticipated by most short-term indicators of 
hard and soft data, Eurostat's flash estimate of GDP 
growth confirmed the d
eceleration of economic 
activity in Q4, with QoQ GDP growth slowing 

down to 0.5% in the EU and 0.4% in the euro area.  
According to available data, economic activity 

weakened particularly in Italy, Germany and 
France.  Growth decelerat
ed but remained healthy 
in the Netherlands, the UK and Poland while, 
contrary to expectations, GDP growth rose in 
Spain. As a result, the 
divergence of QoQ growth 
rates in the EU increased to 0.6 pp. in the fourth 
quarter (from 0.2 pp. in the previous quarter).

Information made available by some Member 
States suggests that domestic demand may have 
slowed, possibly dragged down by private 
consumption in the fourth quarter. Information 

about the external side s
eems to confirm the impact 
of a certain cooling of glob
al growth, reinforced by 
a euro appreciation. 
For the whole of 2007, GDP 
growth is estimated at 
2.9% in the EU and 2.7% in the euro area. The 
carry-over for GDP growth in 2008 is currently 
estimated at 0.9% in the EU and 0.8% for the euro 

area.  –in line with weaker survey indicators  
Looking ahead, on top of the slowdown in Q4, the 
recent distress in the financial markets appears to 
have had a certain, but also differentiated impact 

across Member States. Confidence indicators offer 
some indication as to the impact of the financial 
turmoil and the cooling of global growth across 
sectors and countries.  
The European Commission's economic sentiment 
indicator peaked in July 2007 and has been on a 

steady declining path since then, indicating growth 
moderation (Graph 4). Despite this deterioration, 
the indicator remains abov
e the long-term average 
in both the EU an
d the euro area. 
Sentiment deteriorated in all sectors in the past few 
months in both the EU and the euro area.

Nonetheless, the sectoral confidence indicator for 
industry remains above 
the long-term average. 
Capacity utilisation rates remain high in both areas 

(at just below 84%). On the contrary, confidence in 

the services sector dropped below its long-term 
average in both the EU and the euro area.  
The composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), 
which combines the indi
ces for manufacturing and 
services, declined further to 51.8 in January from 
53.3 in December, and is now below its long-term 
average value.  
The index was dragged down by a decline in the 

services sub-component, which is far below its 
long-term average, while the manufacturing sub-
component is broadly unchanged, close to its long-
term value.  
In the past seven months, since the outburst of the 
financial turmoil, the change in confidence 

indicators points to mixed developments across 
Member States (Graph 
5). The overall economic 
sentiment indicator significantly deteriorated in 
Spain, Italy and Germany, while it remained robust 
in Poland. 
At the sectoral level, confidence in the services 
sector has deteriorated significantly in most 

Member States, and especially
 in Italy, but also in 
the United Kingdom, while confidence in the 

manufacturing sector has clearly held up well. 
 5Interim forecast, February 2008 
    Consumer confidence, on the other hand, has 
declined particularly in th
e Netherlands and France.  
 Growth outlook revised down for 2008 
Based on the individual updates for Germany, 
Spain, France, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Poland and 
the United Kingdom (which are presented in greater 
detail in the country-specific sections below), and 
taking into account the flas
h estimate for Q4, the 
update for the euro-area aggregate for 2008 points 
to a growth rate of 0.3% QoQ in Q1 and Q2, and 
0.4 % in Q3 and Q4. Compared to the fully-fledged 
autumn forecast, it represents a more pronounced 
slowdown in the first half of 2008. This reflects in 

part the slowdown of global growth driven by the 
US through the trade channel, and also a certain 
effect on domestic demand via reduced confidence 
and tighter credit conditions.  
At the level of Member 
States, the slowdown is 
reflected in a revision of annual GDP growth by 

-0.7 pp. in Italy and by -0.5 pp in both Germany 

and the UK. At the same time, the Dutch economy 
grew surprisingly fast in both the third and fourth 
quarters on the back of higher gas production, 

implying a markedly higher carry-over into 2008 
contributing to an upward revision of annual 
growth in 2008. Nevertheless, the Netherlands are 

expected to decelerate 
strongly in 2008 on a 
quarterly basis compared with the autumn 

projection following the impact of the easing of 
global growth on this very open economy. Some 
Member States appear rela
tively more isolated from 
the effects of the financial turmoil, with robust 

domestic demand, notably Poland.   
As a result, annual GDP growth is revised 
downwards by 0.4 pp. in both areas as compared to 

the autumn forecast, to 2.0%
 in the EU and 1.8% in 
the euro area.  Risks to th
e growth forecast remain 
sizeable (see also the sec
tion on downside risks to 
the growth outlook). 
Looking further ahead, this updated outlook for 
2008 points to a reduced growth momentum at the 
turn of 2009. Th
e impact of the lower carry-over 
from 2008, the more pronounced and protracted 
slowdown in the US and the re-pricing of risks 
would need to be carefully assessed against other 
information. The next fully-fledged forecast by the 
Commission, planned for 28 April, will provide a 
more detailed assessment of these issues. 
Inflation up on soaring food and oil prices 
After recording moderate rates of growth in the first 

half of 2007 (around 1.8%), HICP inflation in the 
EU rose to above 3% 
in November-December 
2007. The flash estimate by Eurostat continues to 

indicate an increase to 3.2% in January 2008 in the 
euro area. The r
ecent increase in 
headline
 inflation
 has been driven by soaring oil and food prices, 

combined with unfavour
able base-effects.  
 The strong rise in oil prices in 2007 has inflated the 

contribution from the energy sector significantly to 
0.8-0.9 pp. in November-December. Likewise, the 

contribution of food has increased to 0.9 pp. in 
December, reflecting the tr
ansmission to consumer 
prices of surging international agricultural prices 
(e.g. cereals, dairy products and meat).  The pass-
through from oil and international agricultural 
prices to consumer prices varies from one Member 

State to the other, resulting in an increased 
dispersion in headline inflation across European 
economies. 
 Within headline inflation, the favourable base-

effects from energy-price developments faded away 

at the end of 2007, on 
account of a surge in oil 
prices, while inflation in unprocessed food was 

relatively high in 2007.  
 Core
 inflation
 (HICP excluding energy and 
unprocessed food) remained stable in the first half 
of 2007, but it increased gradually to 2.3% in 
December after a 0.2 pp. rise in November. 
 The increase in core inflation can be attributed to 

services, non-energy industrial goods and processed 

food altogether.  Some additional upward pressure 
continued to develop in the price of services in 
2007, and inflation in processed food picked up 

markedly in the second half of 2007. Moreover, 
industrial price pressures 
at the producer level had 
remained moderate in the first half of 2007 (rising 

by around 2½% on averag
e) but increased in the 
second half of the year to around 3%, suggesting 

that expected price pressures referred to in the 
autumn forecast have now materialised.

Turning to 
wage indicators
, the growth of nominal 
compensation per employee remained subdued in 
2007, increasing by 2.0% YoY in Q3 (up from 

1.9% in Q2), while total hourly labour costs edged 
up to an annual rate of 2.5% in the third quarter of 
2007. Nevertheless, unit labour costs increased by 

1.2% in Q2 and Q3 on the back of a moderation in 
productivity growth. Considering the relatively 
strong improvement in the labour market in 2007, 

wage growth has been contained. Some Member 
States have seen increased wage claims, which so 
far have not resulted in higher wage settlements. 

Furthermore, the current weakening in confidence 
indicators and the general uncertainty surrounding 
economic activity might put a lid on wage claims. 
 At this juncture, the key concern is whether 

inflation 
expectations
 will remain well-anchored. In 
January 2008 future price developments showed 

diverging developments. Compared to December, 

managers' selling-price expectations slightly 
increased in industry, while they decreased in the 
construction sector. Consumers™ price expectations 

increased, and currently stand close to the high 
levels reached in 2001. Moreover, long-term 
inflation expectations, derived from French 
inflation-indexed bonds have continued to pick up 
(since the beginning of September). In both 
November and December they averaged 2.3%, 10 

bp higher than the first ten months of 2007.

YoY % ch.
  Looking ahead, the aggregated outlook for inflation 
in 2008 has been revised upwards significantly, 
based on upward revisions in most of the largest 

Member States, except for the Netherlands. HICP 
inflation is now expected to average 2.9% in the EU 
and 2.6% in the euro area th
is year. This adds about 
half a pp. to consumer price inflation in both areas 
compared to the autu
mn 2007 forecast.  
 This upward revision takes into account the higher 
oil and food-price assumptions and a risk of 

possible second-round effects on price and wage-
setting resulting from the observed increase in 
inflation expectations. High capacity utilisation and 

fairly tight labour market
s may further fuel wage 
demands, which could drive up unit labour costs.  
 In terms of 
quarterly developments
, inflation in the 
EU is now expected to peak in the first quarter at 
just above 3% and moderate gradually thereafter 

reaching close to 2% in the fourth quarter, on 
account of reduced infla
tionary impulses from 
commodity prices. 
  Employment and public finances react with a lag 
In the second half of 2007, employment growth 
moderated somewhat to 0.3% QoQ in the third 
quarter in both the EU and the euro area (down 

from a robust 0.5% in the EU and 0.6% in the euro 
area in Q2). Compared to 
one year ago, the increase 
in 07Q3 was 1.7% in the EU and 1.9% in the euro 
area, representing widespread employment gains 
across Member States. The unemployment rate 
 7Interim forecast, February 2008 
    declined to 6.8% in Decem
ber 2007 in the EU and 
was 7.2% in the euro ar
ea. Overall, the annual 
average unemployment rate was 7.1% in 2007 in 

the EU, as expected in the autumn forecast. In the 
euro area, it was 7.4% in 
2007, compared with an 
autumn forecast of 7.3%.  
However, given that employment growth lags 
output growth, employment growth will not remain 
unscathed from the downward revision to GDP 
growth forecasts. In th
e autumn forecast, the 
Commission projected a deceleration of 
employment growth to around 1% a year in 2008 

and 2009. This forecast is likely to be taken further 
down in coming months, thereby worsening labour 
market developments in the coming years.  
This is in line with survey data being still above 
long-term averages, althou
gh they appear to have 
peaked. Hiring intentions in the services sector, 

which is the largest employer, continued to 

deteriorate in January. A similar observation can be 
made in the manufacturing sector. In addition, 
consumers' unemployment expectations have 

worsened in January. 
Turning to public finances, the information 
available suggests that, given the marked 
downward revision to economic activity, the 2008 

budgetary position in the 
EU and the euro area 
could be worse than expected in the autumn 

forecast (after reaching its 
best outcome in 2007, in 
structural terms, since at least the start of monetary 
union.). In particular, the slowdown heightens the 

risk that, following years of tax buoyancy, revenues 
may surprise on the downside. However, for some 
countries this may be partly compensated by a 

better-than-expected outcome for 2007. A full 
assessment of the prospects 
for public finances will 
be carried out in the Commission's spring forecast. 
 Downside risks to GDP outlook continue to 

prevail 
The autumn forecast iden
tified the risks to the 
growth outlook as being clearly tilted to the 

downside in 2008, while being tilted to the upside 

for consumer price inflation. 
As regards the 
risks to the growth outlook
, developments since the autumn forecast have 
confirmed a number of them, not least the one 
related to the slowdown in the US economy, which 
now appears both to be more pronounced and more 

protracted while the imp
act of the monetary and 
fiscal easing is surrounded by a sizeable degree of 

uncertainty.  
The turmoil in the financial markets has also proven 

more persistent than assumed last autumn, with 
problems spreading to or intensifying in other credit 
markets. Spreads also remain at higher levels (not 

only compared to the level of last summer, when 
risks were compressed to an unsustainable level, 
but also above long-term averages). This signals a 
continued lack of confidence affecting liquidity and 
credit provisions.  
It cannot be excluded that credit conditions and 

credit availability may be more seriously affected 
than assumed in this update of the outlook. This 
could affect, 
inter alia
, the housing markets 
adversely, not only in the US, but also in the EU. 
Indeed, it should be noted that the exposure to and 
impact from the current distress in the financial 

markets differ across Memb
er States. Countries 
having had a housing boom in the recent past, with 

high external debt or a high share of debt at variable 
interest rates are likely to be more exposed than 
others. From this follows that, although the 
downward revision is relatively limited, the outlook 

for Spain remains uncertain.
 In the case of the UK, 
the above-average importance of the financial 

services sector adds to th
e (downside) risks at the 
current juncture. As rega
rds the French economy, 
the housing market remains relatively resilient, 

although slowing down, and the impact of the 
additional measures taken to support household 
disposable income is difficult to predict.  
Other risks relate to the effect of e.g. higher oil 

prices, changes in exchange rates and, not least, 
adverse shifts in consumer and investor confidence.  
On the other hand, commodity prices could decline 

faster than futures currently suggest or the growth 
momentum in emerging markets could surprise on 
the upside. The importance of the still positive 

employment growth in the regular labour market on 
consumption propensity may also have been 
underestimated.

 Graph 8 provides a quantification of these risks in 
terms of possible deviation of output growth from 
the main scenario. More
 specifically, the graph shows the impact various 
combinations of risks 
could have on euro-area GDP growth, the outcomes 

being weighted by the probability of their 

occurrence.  
At a 90% confidence interval, GDP growth in the 
euro area could be 0.8 pp. lower in 2008 compared 
to the central scenario if all negative factors 

materialise. But growth could also be up to 0.4 pp. 
higher if the positive risks to the outlook were to 
materialise. As regards 
the inflation outlook
, the risks identified 
in the autumn forecast of a further up-tick in 
commodity prices have already materialised and 
have had a direct impact on consumer price 

inflation.  
Second-round effects have been relatively limited 
so far. However, a certain impact from soaring oil- 

and food prices on inflation expectations and 
subsequently on wage claims has been noted in 
some Member States. While competitive pressures 

from globalisation are expected to limit the 
acceleration in wage growth at the aggregated level, 
a relatively tight labour market in some sectors 

and/or Member States could imply a higher wage 
growth than assumed.  
On the other hand, in view of a general moderation 
of growth, domestic inflationary pressures should 
ease. In particular if commodity prices were to 
decline faster than futures suggest.  
Overall, whilst the risks to the inflation outlook 
now appear more balanced, they are still on the 

upside with the increase in inflation expectations 
(and its possible impact on wage formation) being a 
particular source of concern.  
 9Interim forecast, February 2008 
    Growth and inflation prospects in the 
seven largest Member States 
 1. Germany Œ slower growth despite strong 
fundamentals 
Despite overall sound fundamentals, growth in 

Germany is set to slow down to slightly above 1½% 
in 2008. This revision by half a pp. compared with 
the autumn forecast is a direct consequence of both 

a weakening of growth towards the end of 2007 and 
a more cautious outlook for 2008. 
Contributing factors to the growth moderation are 
the continuing financial turmoil and a more 
subdued international environment, which have led 
to a drop in consumer and producer confidence. 

Exports are further dampened by the euro 
appreciation since early
 2006. Additionally, 
stronger-than-expected increases in oil and food 
prices have dampened real disposable income 
growth and thus private consumption. In addition to 
reducing the carry-over by a quarter of a pp. from 
2007 to 2008, these effects will weigh on growth in 
2008.  
At the current juncture, Germany's economy is 
expected to remain on a positive growth path. 

Given the sound financial position of private 
households and enterprises as well as a subdued  
housing market, Germany is only to a limited extent 

vulnerable to shocks from the financial turmoil. In 
addition, price competitiveness of German exports 
and their composition remain relatively favourable. 
Private consumption, which was dampened in 2007 
by VAT-induced purchases brought forward to 
2006 as well as price increases, should benefit from 
healthy employment growth 
already seen over the 
last two years (Graph 9). Accelerating wage growth 
should also add to risi
ng disposable income 
compensating for higher inflation. However, the so 
far buoyant labour market performance could be 

jeopardised by higher inflation and low consumer 
confidence weighing on private consumption.

 In December 2007 inflati

Oil and food prices are pred
icted to remain high but 
no longer rising. Therefore, base effects after price 

increases in the context of the VAT hike and the 
introduction of tuition fees in some 
Länder should 
help to gradually bring inflation down in the course 
of the year.   2. Spain Œ still in for a soft landing 
 GDP grew in Spain by 0.8% in quarterly terms in 

the fourth quarter of 2007, up from 0.7% in the 
third quarter. For the year as a whole, economic 
activity is estimated to have expanded by 3.8%, 

unchanged from the autumn forecast and, as in 
previous years, exclusively based on domestic 
demand. In 2008, and in spite of the robust growth 

in the last quarter of 2007, GDP growth is projected 
to slow down to 2.7%. This would be fully 
explained by a decelera
ting domestic demand on 
the back of a drop of consumer confidence, a 
cooling down of the housing sector and tighter 
credit conditions due to the financial turmoil.  
 Concerning the external sector, the most recent 
available information would suggest that exports 
might be on an acceleratin
g path and growing well 
above imports, which should lose momentum as a 
result of a weaker domestic demand. All in all, and 
 10 Interim forecast, February 2008 
    in spite of expected lower activity in the euro area, 
the traditional negative contribution of net exports 
to GDP growth observed in previous years should 

almost vanish in 2008. Finally, the rebalancing of 
the economic growth pattern might still be 
insufficient to improve the 
current account deficit, 
which should still remain close to two-digit 
territory.

  Inflation rose sharply to 4% in the last quarter of 
2007 compared with 2.4% 
in the previous one. The 
inflationary rebound is mainly explained by the 

increase in energy and fo
od prices. The inflation 
differential vis-à-vis the euro area has widened 
during the last quarters and, from about ½ pp. last 
summer, it has widened to above one pps. recently 
and is projected to remain around that level. While 

price increase for the year as a whole would not 
depart substantially from 3¾%, it is projected to 
decline at the end of the year to below 3%. 
 3. France Œ slower growth in a cooling global 
environment After 2% real GDP growth in 2006, the French 
economy is estimated to have expanded by 1.9% in 

2007, as in the Commission services' autumn 2007 
forecast (albeit with a s
lightly lower carry-over) 
and below current estimates of potential growth. In 
2007, GDP growth was driven by domestic 
demand, in particular by strong private 
consumption in line with the improvement of 
households' disposable income, while the external 
sector once more provided a negative contribution.  
In 2008, economic activity is projected to slow 
down, growing at 1.7% (against 2.0% in the autumn 

forecast). Although most 
sentiment and activity 
indicators are still posting comparatively positive 
readings (with the notable exception of consumer 

confidence), they are likely to turn more negative in 
the course of the year. The downward revision with 
respect to the autumn forecast results from the 
lower carry-over from 2007, higher-than-expected 
inflation and the weakening of the global 
environment. 
Slower economic growth in France's main trading 
partners will entail a stronger drag on growth from 
net trade. Nevertheless, domestic demand and in 

particular private consumption is expected to 
remain comparatively resilient (Graph 11). Still 
favourable employment developments and tax and 

social contribution cuts introduced with the TEPA 
package in August 2007
, as well as additional 
measures on purchasing power adopted in February 
2008, will partly limit the negative impact of 
considerably higher inflation on households' 
disposable income. Business investment is expected 

to grow more slowly than in 2007 due to a 
slackening demand and tighter financial conditions.  
Risks to this scenario are tilted to the downside, 
notably since the French economy could be affected 

more than projected by the global slowdown and 
measures to support households disposable income 
may be less effective than assumed in the forecast.  
For 2007 as a whole, head
line inflation turned out 
at 1.5% in line with the autumn forecast. In the 

fourth quarter, inflation however has risen more 

quickly than expected 
peaking at 2.8% in 
December, the highest mont
hly year-on-year (YoY) change since May 2004, due chiefly to higher oil 

and food prices. In 2008, headline HICP inflation is 
forecast to average close to 2.4%, 0.7 pp. higher 
than expected last autumn. In view of broadly 

stable oil prices following a peak at the turn of the 
year and of a base effect after the high level of 
inflation recorded in the last quarter of 2007, 
headline HICP shou
ld gradually decrease during the 
year. Core inflation as measured by the HICP 
excluding food and energy prices, should increase 
 11Interim forecast, February 2008 
    to close to 1.8% for 2008 as a whole, from an 
estimated 1.5% in 2007.
 Graph 11: France Œ Growth of GDP and domestic 
demand 
 4. Italy - weaker prospects for GDP growth
 Economic activity in Italy slowed down more than 

in the rest of the euro area in the latter part of last 

year. Real GDP is expected to have contracted 
relative to the previous quarter. The resulting 
annual growth rate for real GDP in 2007 is 

estimated at 1.8%, 0.1 pp. lower than projected in 
the autumn forecast.
2   The expected contraction in
 the fourth quarter of 
2007 also implies a substantial weakening of the 
growth impulse into 2008. The carry-over effect is 
now a mere 0.1%, well below the 0.5% expected in 
autumn. The available indications for economic 

activity in the first quarter of 2008 are rather 
negative. Business surveys re
flect expectations of a 
further slowdown. But while in the services sector 
the PMI indicator has fallen well below the critical 
threshold of stagnating activity, it remains slightly 
above that threshold in the manufacturing sector. 
                                                 2 On 29 February, the Italian statistical office (ISTAT) 
will release new annual Nati
onal Accounts incorporating 
a revised methodology for computing exports and 
imports deflators. This could 
lead to a different real GDP 
growth. Moreover, since part of the contraction in industrial 
production in the fourth quarter of 2007 appears to 
be due to exceptional factors, namely, strikes in the 

transportation sector in D
ecember, a small recovery 
in 2008 Q1 is expected. On the demand side, the 

deceleration in foreign demand associated with the 

appreciation of the euro af
fects export growth. Also 
the expansion of private consumption is expected to 

have lost momentum, under the impact of higher 

prices and lower confidence. After having 
rebounded in the third quarter of 2007, investment 
is expected to ease on the back of decreasing capital 
utilization. Quarterly real GDP growth in the first 
quarter of 2008 is thus forecast to remain almost 

flat.   -3%-2%-1%0%1%

 Annual HICP inflation in 2007, at 2%, turned out 
slightly higher than projected in the autumn 
forecast, due to the accelerat
ion recorded in the last 
quarter of the year (2.6% YoY). In the fourth 
quarter of 2007, core inflation also peaked at 
around 2%. In January, HICP inflation surged 
further to 3.1%. The main sources for the sustained 
 12 Interim forecast, February 2008 
    high level of headline inflation were the increases 
in oil and food prices, bu
t also the increases in tariffs and the rising prices of house services and 
tobacco. On the assumption of broadly stable oil 
prices over the forecast horizon, inflation should 
remain at around 3.0% in the first quarter of 2008 

and progressively ease therea
fter to reach 2.2% in 
2008 Q4, due to a gradually smaller base effect. 

Overall, HICP inflation is 
expected to average 2.7% 
in 2008.  
 5. The Netherlands - strong growth in 2008 masks 

deceleration Economic growth was 3.5% in 2007, the highest 

level since the start of th
e century and significantly 
above the autumn forecast. 
Sluggish growth in the 
second quarter of 2007 turned buoyant in the 

second half of the year (Graph 13), supported by 
dynamic employment growth, which brought the 
unemployment rate below 3% at the end of 2007. 

Strong intra-year dynamics were related to high 
variability in the volume of gas production, as 
production normalised in the second half of the year 
following the relatively high temperatures in the 
winter of 2007. On balance, however, economic 
growth over the year 2007 was unaffected by 
volatile gas production and was primarily driven by 
strong domestic demand, supported by the, at the 
time, still favorable international environment. 
 Graph 13: The Netherlands - Export volume and 

quarterly GDP growth 
Furthermore, private consumption expenditure 
growth is expected to be held back by rising 
inflation that reduces households' purchasing 

power. Despite the slowdown, economic growth in 
2008 is likely to come out better than anticipated in 
the autumn forecast, at 2.
9%. This is linked to the 
exceptionally high growth in the second half of 
2007, which raised the carry-over to 1.9% from 1% 
projected in the au
tumn 2007 forecast. 
 Consumer price inflation is forecast to increase 

from 1.6% in 2007 to 2.3% in 2008, in line with the 
autumn 2007 forecast. Fact
ors that act to increase 
inflation include higher food and energy prices and 
- from mid-2008 onwards - increased fuel levies, 
the introduction of the aviation tax and an expected 
increase in housing rental prices. 
  6. Poland Œ moving towards more sustainable 

levels Economic activity continued to be robust at the end 
of 2007. GDP growth is estimated to have surged to 
1.7% QoQ in the last quarter of 2007. This is a 

preliminary estimate subject to revision. Firm 
growth in the fourth quarter, supported by 
continued strong investments and private 

consumption fuelled by wage increases, contributed 
to an annual growth rate of 6.5% (the highest in ten 
years), which is in line w
ith the autumn forecast. 
For 2008, GDP growth is expected to lose some 

momentum and reach 5¼%, which is ¼ pp. lower 
than in the autumn forecas
t. This follows from the 
expected slower growth in
 the EU, the main trading 
partner of Poland. Lower external demand will 
increase the trade deficit and thus hamper GDP 

growth despite solid domestic fundamentals.

 Consumption growth is being supported by a 
continued recovery in the labour market and 
increasing nominal wages. In 2007 until the third 
quarter, the employment rate increased by ca. 2.4 
pps. to 57.8% (yet it is still far behind the EU 

average), while the unemployment rate declined 
from 11.8% to 8.1% at the end of the year, which 
was, by far, the largest drop in the EU. The 

improvement is expected to continue, albeit at a 
slower pace due to emergi
ng skill mismatches.   
HICP inflation reached 2.
6% YoY in 2007, a notch 
higher than in the au
tumn forecast. Planned 
increases in administrative 
prices, soaring food and 
oil prices together with high wage demands in the 
public sector and labour shortages in certain 

segments of the market, will put upward pressure 
on inflation in 2008. The appreciation of the Zloty 
and a tightening monetary policy are expected to 

mitigate the impact somewhat. Overall inflation for 
2008 has been revised upwards compared to the 
autumn forecast from 2.8% to 3.8% with the peak 
in the first quarter at 4¼
% and afterwards a decline 
to 3¼% in the last quarter, back within the Polish 
central bank's inflation band. 
     7. The United Kingdom Œ weakening growth 
driven by private consumption slowdown 
 In the second half of 2007 economic activity in the 

UK remained relatively strong but showed some 
signs of moderation relative to the first half of the 

year amidst ongoing financial market turmoil. In 
the third and fourth quarters of 2007 real GDP grew 
by 0.7% and 0.6% QoQ respectively. If confirmed 

in final GDP data, this brings annual growth in 
2007 to 3.1%, in line with
 the autumn forecast.  
 In the third quarter (for which detailed national 
accounts exist), domestic demand growth proved 

robust and more than comp
ensated for a sharp fall 
in net exports, which subtracted 0.5% points from 

quarterly growth. Consumer spending remained 

vigorous, supported by relatively strong housing 
market activity. However, household sector data 
continued to show very low saving. Fixed 

investment rebounded sharply and made a positive 
contribution to growth, as did changes in 
inventories. The overall employment rate grew and 
the unemployment rate fell slightly in the final 
quarter.  
 Perceptions of the UK's relatively greater exposure 

to changed credit market conditions contributed to a 
depreciation of the pound sterling between October 

and mid-February of around 6% in nominal 
effective terms, and UK policy rates were cut by a 
cumulative 50 bp in December and February. 
 GDP growth in 2008 is expected to slow markedly 

from 0.4% in the first quarter to 0.2% QoQ in the 
final two quarters, driven by a substantial 
weakening of domestic demand growth. Private 

consumption is likely to moderate due to the 
combined impact of tighter credit conditions for 
household borrowing and a weakening housing 

market. Furthermore, heightened uncertainty over 
households' real income growth prospects is likely 
to encourage precautionary saving. Investment 
growth is expected to moderate on account of 
tighter credit conditions and a less supportive 
business environment, both domestic and external, 

over the medium term. External demand is set to 
weaken in 2008 due to the deterioration in global 
growth prospects, but the weaker exchange rate is 

likely to support export growth in the medium term.  
 14 Interim forecast, February 2008 
    Overall, GDP growth for th
e entire year is forecast 
to reach 1.7%, significan
tly lower than in the 
preceding year and ½% weaker than in the 
Commission services' 2007 autumn forecast.  
 The YoY HICP inflation rate in January 2008 rose 

slightly to 2.2% from 2.1% in the previous month. 
However, the rate of inflation is expected to 
increase significantly during the rest of 2008 due to 

higher energy and food prices and the gradual pass-
through of higher import pr
ices. These inflationary 
pressures are also evident in rising producer price 

inflation, which reached 5.7% in January 2008, the 
highest rate in over 16 
years. Therefore, average 
HICP inflation in 2008 is expected to be 2.5%, 
somewhat higher than forecast in the autumn, with 
full-pass through of inflationary pressures expected 

to be progressively mitigated by demand weakness.

    Box: Technical background to the interim forecast 
 In February 2006, the Commission presented the first 
of what are now twice-year
ly interim forecasts with 
the objective of updating its comprehensive spring 
and autumn economic forecas
ts (with the next fully-fledged forecast scheduled for 28 April 2008). This 

interim forecast updates the outlook of the autumn 

2007 economic forecast of 9 November 
(http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/thematic_articl
es/article12054_en.htm). The cut-off date for this 
interim forecast to take new information on board was 
15 February 2008. 
The interim forecast updates 
the outlook for the seven  
Member States i.e. Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom (which 
are the largest in the EU based on an average of the 

ranking in terms of both population and nominal 
GDP), as regards real GDP growth and HICP inflation 
for the current year. These 
updates are prepared using 
indicator-based forecasting 
models or judgemental 
forecasting techniques.  
Estimates for the European Union and the euro area 

are prepared using the nominal GDP-weighted 

updates for the largest Member States. These 
countries account for 80% of
 the European Union and 
almost 85% of the euro ar
ea in terms of nominal 
GDP. The outlook for the smaller Member States, 

which have tended to grow faster than the larger ones, 
have not been updated. The Commission has made 

projections for the euro ar
ea and the EU using the 
updates for the five and seven largest Member States 

respectively, and assuming that the revision for the 
smaller Member States is equal to that of the larger 
ones. 
Quarterly data are updated with the latest available 

information. When comparing quarterly with annual 
GDP growth it must be kept in mind that, whenever 
possible, quarterly data are adjusted for both seasonal 

influences and the number of working days while 
annual data is presented in unadjusted form. As 2008 
is a leap year, the working day adjustment is likely to 

be positive, estimated at 0.1 pp. for the euro area. 
External conditions  
This forecast is based on a set of external 
assumptions. These assumptions are based on market 
expectations at the time of 
the forecast. To shield the 
assumptions from possible volatility during one 
specific trading day, averages from a 10-day reference 

period have been used for all technical assumptions.  
The technical assumption as
 regards exchange rates 
has been standardised using fixed nominal exchange 

rates for all currencies. They are kept constant based 

on the averages from 31 January to 13 February, 
implying an annual average of USD/EUR of 1.47.  
Interest rates assumptions are, since spring 2007, 
market-based instead of
 expert-based. These 
assumptions should be interpreted with caution, as 

market-based assumptions do not only reflect policy 

rate expectations, but also liquidity conditions in this 
period of market uncertainty. Short-term interest rates 
for the euro area are derive
d from future contracts. 
Long-term interest rates for the euro area, as well as 
short- and long-term interest rates for Poland and the 
UK are calculated using implicit forward swap rates, 
corrected for the spread between the 3-month 
interbank interest rate and the 3-month swap-rate. As 
a result, the short-term rate is at 3.8% and the long-

term interest rates at 3.9% in 2008 for the euro area. 
The outlook for oil prices is based on futures prices. 
The price for a barrel of Bren
t crude oil is projected at 
90.3 USD/barrel in 2008 (corresponding to 61.4 
EUR/barrel). This would be 11.5 USD/barrel (or 5.9 
EUR/barrel) higher than assumed in the autumn 2007 
forecast, reflecting maintained strong demand from 
e.g. emerging markets and geopolitical uncertainties.  
Global demand in 2008 is revised downwards, 
following the recent distress
 in the financial markets 
and a weaker outlook for the US. However, a still 
relatively strong growth in emerging markets, 
especially China, limits the overall easing of global 

growth. Global GDP growth is thus forecast to slow 
to 3.8% in 2008 (down from 4.8% in 2007). This 
update uses the revised purchasing power parities 

from the international comparison programme (ICP) 
for 146 countries, which lower global growth by 
around ½ pp. a year in 2005-2007.  
World trade is also set to slow somewhat in 2008, 

with growth in export and import volumes of goods 
estimated at just below 7%.
