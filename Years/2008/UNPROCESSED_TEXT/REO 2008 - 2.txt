viiExecutive Summary Outlook: Navigating Turbulent Waters  The spread of the crisis in financial markets has significantly dampened the outlook for 
the European economy. Even though Europe faced the financial turbulence from a position 
of strong fundamentals, spillovers from the expected mild recession in the United States, the 
global reassessment of risks, and the strains in the financial system are sapping its economy™s strength. The appreciation of the euro and the sharp increase in inflation, driven by food and 
energy prices, are adding to these troubles. Growth
 in Europe is expected to decline sharply,  by 1¼ percentage points in 2008, with growth rates in the advanced economies projected to 
fall well below potential for some time.  
 The risks to the growth outlook are substantial. On the downside, spillovers from weaker 
global growth could be even larger than expected; global imbalances could unwind suddenly, 
accompanied by a further appreciation of the euro; and the credit squeeze could turn into a 
full-blown credit crunch. Risks are greater in countries that are going through a correction in housing prices, though this factor is mitigated in Europe by the limited reliance of 
households on borrowing against home equity collateral. Emerging economies with large 
current account deficits or high external debt ratios would be especially vulnerable to shifts 
in investor confidence. On the upside, domestic demand could be stronger than projected, 
especially in the short run, as labor markets are still strong. The challenges facing policymakers in advanced economies are to restore confidence in 
the financial system and minimize the impact of the financial sector crisis on the real economy, while maintaining hard-won inflation credibility and long-term fiscal sustainability. 

The immediate priorities are to rebuild counterparty confidence and reinforce the soundness of financial institutions. Liquidity should continue to be provided as needed. Central banks 
will have to strike the right balance between supporting the real economy and preventing 

second-round effects from the recent rise in inflation. In the euro area, while current 

inflation is uncomfortably high, prospects point to its falling back below 2 percent during 
2009 in the context of an increasingly negative outlook for activity. Accordingly, the European Central Bank (ECB) can afford some easing of the policy stance. For countries 

with fiscal room, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully to cushion the downturn. In the event of a more severe contraction in growth, timely, temporary, and well-targeted fiscal stimuli could be effective in supporting the economy for a few countries. 
 The economies of emerging Europe continue to grow rapidly, but their dynamism is being 
challenged by the slowdown in advanced economies, the repricing of risk, and the rise in commodity prices. The financial turbulence is starting to affect the cost and availability of 
financing: sovereign and private bond spreads have risen, short-term cross-border financial 
flows have moderated, and credit growth is starting to slow in some countries. For most 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY viiicountries, growth is expected to weaken only moderately, adjusting toward potential rates 
and limiting the risks of overheating. However, the growing risks of a hard landing in countries with large external imbalances call for a continued focus on reducing vulnerabilities and managing demand pressures.Financial Turbulence: Testing Resilience and Dampening Growth 
 Financial turmoil has spread quickly through Europe™s financial systems (see Chapter 2). 
Direct valuation and income losses on subprime-related securities dented the capital and 

profitability of European financial institutions. With uncertainty about exposures and 
counterparty risk becoming pervasive, credit risk has been reappraised, but asymmetrically 
across the various asset classes. The erosion of risk appetite has generated unprecedented pressures in the commercial paper and interbank money markets. Despite the depth and width of the turmoil, Europe™s financial systems have held up 
relatively well so far. The soundness of the major systemic players has been maintained, as 
shareholders and outside investors have injected fresh capital where needed. Partly as a result 
of this and partly because ﬁplain vanillaﬂ debt instruments have been less affected, bank 
lending in advanced economies in Europe has held up, and spillovers to emerging Europe 

have been limited.  
 But the test of Europe™s financial systems is not over. A range of estimates suggest that 
loss recognition in many financial institutions still needs to catch up with reality. Meanwhile, 

until U.S. housing market conditions stabilize, the values of subprime mortgage products will 
likely fall further. The continuing financial distress is spreading to other forms of debt and 
debt default insurance and, through its impact on parent banks in advanced economies, may 

spill over into emerging Europe. Moreover, liquidity remains seriously impaired despite 

aggressive responses by major central banks. 
 An overarching concern is the toll of the unfolding crisis on the real economy. Analytical 
work suggests that the effects on growthŠfrom the rising cost of finance and the credit 
supply squeeze, as well as from knock-on effects through equity and housing price 

correctionsŠare likely to be significant. A more severe credit crunch remains a distinct 

possibility and would amplify the slowdown. Emerging Europe: Sustaining Convergence and Addressing Vulnerabilities Analysis of the prospects and vulnerabilities of emerging Europe (see Chapter 3) suggests 
that the convergence trend of the region is based on strong fundamentals and will therefore continue, albeit at a slower pace. Structural reforms have progressed in most countries, 
thanks to which growth has been driven primarily by productivity improvements. However, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ixgrowth rates in recent years have been above estimates of potential for most countries and an adjustment is already under way.  Fast growth has been associated with rising external imbalances in several economies, 
including large current account deficits and high levels of external debt, raising risks of a 
hard landing. Although fundamentals justify relatively large current account deficits in the 

region, deficits in some countries may be excessive, suggesting the need for adjustment in 
the medium term. High external debt levels and balance sheet exposures in some countries 
are an additional source of vulnerability.  
 Macroeconomic policies and structural reforms will need to do more to address emerging 
Europe™s imbalances. Monetary conditions tend to be on the loose side in most of the region 
and should be tightened where possible. Fiscal consolidation has not always taken full advantage of the strong cycle and needs to play a more prominent role in managing domestic demand, particularly in countries where monetary policy focuses on exchange rate stability. 
Our analysis also reveals a strong link between structural reforms and potential growth, 
suggesting that further progress in these reforms may be essential to ensure a smooth 
convergence in emerging Europe. Moreover, structural reforms will facilitate the gearing of resources toward the tradable sector, thereby helping to reduce external imbalances. 
11. Outlook: Navigating Turbulent Waters 
 Growth in Europe is expected to slow significantly in 
2008Œ09, reflecting spillovers from weaker global growth, 

rising commodity prices, and the strains in financial 

markets. Meanwhile, inflation has picked up, driven by a 

surge in food and energy prices. The challenges for 

policymakers in advanced economies are to restore confidence 

in the financial system and support real activity while 
maintaining inflation credibility and safeguarding long-term 
fiscal sustainability. In emerging Europe, policies need to 

focus on reducing vulnerabilities and strengthening the 

resilience of the financial system. 
Advanced EconomiesHeadwinds to Growth  
 Growth momentum in advanced economies 

decelerated toward the end of 2007 as concerns 

about the health of the U.S. subprime mortgage 

market prompted a reappraisal of risks across a 
broad range of financial markets. Growth in the 
United States slowed sharply, reflecting the 
continuing housing sector correction and financial 

market dislocations.1 In Europe, growth 
deceleration in the fourth quarter was relatively 

mild; however, business confidence and indicators 

of economic activity suggest continuing weakness 

in early 2008 (Figures 1 and 2).2 At the same time, headline inflation picked up, 

boosted by a surge in global commodity prices

1 See the IMF™s World Economic Outlook 
(2008a) and the GlobalFinancial Stability Report
 (2008b) for a detailed discussion of global developments and the ou
tlook for the United States. 2 In what follows, the group of emerging European 
economies comprises Albania;
 Belarus; Bosnia and 
Herzegovina; Bulgaria; Croatia; the Czech Republic; Estonia; 
Hungary; Latvia; Lithuania; Macedonia, FYR; Malta; 
Moldova; Montenegro; Poland; Romania; Russia; Serbia; the 
Slovak Republic; Slovenia; Turkey; and Ukraine. All other 
European economies are included
 in the group of advanced 
economies. (Figure 3). Energy prices rose by 70 percent in the 
year ending February 2008, while food prices 

increased by nearly 40 percent. This rise in food 

and energy prices was driven by a combination of 

strong demand growth from emerging economies 
and the biofuel industry and tight supply 
constraints (including adverse weather and 

disruptions in oil production). The higher 

commodity prices are depressing consumers™ 
purchasing power and pushing up production 

costs. Growth in the advanced European economies 
is expected to decline by 1¼ percentage points to 

1.5 percent in 2008Šwell below potential 

growthŠand to weaken further in 2009 (Figure 1 

and Table 1). The projection reflects the current 

IMF staff assessment of the economic impact of 

the financial turbulence (from higher funding 

costs and tightening credit conditions), the likely 

spillovers to Europe from weaker U.S. and global 
growth, and the effects of higher commodity prices. Inflation is expected to remain elevated in 

the near term but should come down gradually 

later in the year as commodity price growth 

moderates and economic activity eases.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 4Repricing of Risks Led to Higher Lending Rates . . . The financial turmoil in advanced economies 
has intensified in recent
 months (see Chapter 2). 
What started as a liquidity squeeze, sparked by 

strains in a small section of the U.S. household 

lending market, quickly developed into a 

generalized repricing of credit risks, affecting a 

wide range of financial markets. The drying up of 
the asset-backed securities market and liquidity 
strains in the interbank market raised the cost of 

bank financing relative to policy rates. With banks 

passing on the rise in their funding costs to 

borrowers, lending rates have increased (Figure 4). 
The cost of bond and equity financing has also 

gone up. All major European central banks have 

acted aggressively to mitigate the rise in the cost 

of wholesale funds by increasing liquidity 
provision in the interbank market. Some central 
banks have also introduced new intervention 

instruments and broadened the range of securities 

that can be used as collateral. Despite these 

efforts, liquidity remains seriously impaired as 

concerns about credit risks have intensifiedŠthe 

spreads between short-term interbank and policy 

rates are well above historical averages (Figure 5).  
. . . and Prompted a Tightening of Credit Standards Credit growth remained relatively strong 
through the end of 2007, although there are signs 
that lending is starting to cool off. Mortgage credit 

growth is slowing in many countries; however, in a 

number of cases the slowdown was already in 
train before the onset of the crisis. Business 
lending growth has also moderated in the United 

Kingdom. Corporate lending in the euro area has 

continued apace so far, although that could be due, at least in part, to a switch from market to 

bank financing. Only a few sectors, such as

OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING TURBULENT WATERS 5leveraged buyouts, are experiencing a notable drop 
in access to credit.  
 Surveys of lending conditions in Europe 
suggest that lenders are tightening credit standards 

and nonprice lending terms, particularly for loans 

to enterprises (Figure 6). The main factor 
explaining this tightening of standards is the 
deterioration of the macroeconomic outlook. 

Additional factors for some lenders are the need 

to rebuild capital and halt the expansion of 

balance sheets resulting from reduced 

securitization of loans, activation of credit lines, 

and assumptions of off-balance-sheet liabilities. 
 A particular concern is that the expected 
tightening of bank credit is not likely to be offset 

by increased availability of bond and equity 

financing. In past episodes of financial market 

turbulence, different parts of the financial system 

were able to compensate partially for the 

difficulties experienced in one segment. This may 

not be possible at present because the crisis has 
affected both banks and capital markets, the twin 
engines of the financial system.  
 IMF staff analysis suggests that the turbulence 
in financial markets is likely to reduce real growth 

in Europe by about ¾ percentage point in both 

2008 and 2009 relative to a baseline without 
financial shocks (see Chapter 2). This reduction 
reflects the combined impact of rising lending rates, reduced access to funds, and the likely 

declines in asset prices. Since the crisis is still 

unfolding, estimates of its impact are subject to 

significant uncertainty.  
Spillovers from Weaker Global 
Growth Could Be Large  
 The deflation of the house price bubble and the 
dislocations in financial markets have brought the 

U.S. economy to the brink of recession (IMF, 

2008a). The United States is a major trading 

partner for many European countries (e.g., Ireland 

and the United Kingdom) and accounts for about 

15 percent of export demand for the euro area. 

Historically, the spillovers from a slowdown in the 

United States to Europe have been substantial, 
with financial linkages an even more important 
channel of transmission than trade (Bayoumi and 

Swiston, 2007). The IMF staff estimates that a 1 

percentage point decline in U.S. growth reduces 

growth in Europe by about ½ percentage point 

(Box 1). The recent appreciation of the real effective 
exchange rate of the euro may strengthen the 

negative trade effects for the euro area (Figure 7).

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 6Box 1.  Spillovers from Weaker U.S. Growth 
Changes in U.S. growth have a clear impact on growth in both advanced and emerging European economies. A 
vector autoregression (VAR) analysis based on quarterly data from 2001 to 2007 suggests that a 1 percentage point 
temporary slowdown in U.S. growth directly reduces gr
owth in advanced and emerging Europe by about ½ 
percentage point within two quarters. Furthermore, indirect spillovers from weaker growth in advanced economies 
in Europe could weaken growth in the emerging economies by a further ¼ percentage point. Previous IMF staff 
work suggests that the spillovers may be even greater in the event of a U.S. recession (IMF, 2007). 
Note: The main author of this box is Srobona Mitra. 
IMF staff estimates suggest that the euro is on the strong side of its medium-term equilibrium value. 

Specifically, the euro is overvalued, as is the U.S. 
dollar, vis-à-vis the currencies of countries with 
current account surpluses, such as the oil 

producers and some Asian economies.   
Uncertainties around the Outlook Are Unusually High  
 The risks around the current growth projection 
are substantial. The turbulence in financial 

markets is still unfolding, and assessments of its 

potential impact on growth are fraught with 

uncertainty. If growth and employment in Europe 

decline sharply, structural rigidities in the 
advanced economies™ labor and product markets 
could make for a prolonged slowdown. First, the 
slowdown in the United States may be deeper and 
more protracted than currently projected, causing 

greater spillovers to the rest of the world. Such 
developments would depress further growth in 
Europe. Second, as events unfold, banks™ losses 

could turn out to be larger than currently assessed. 

In this case, the credit squeeze could become 
more severe, with corresponding consequences 

for activity. Third, a significant further 

appreciation of the euro may affect 

competitiveness, especially if it is driven mainly by 

a decline in the relative risk premium on euro 
assets. Other risks to growth include further gains 
in commodity prices, a rise in protectionist 

pressures, and the possibility of disorderly 

developments related to global imbalances.

OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING TURBULENT WATERS 7 Risks may be magnifie
d in countries going 
through an adjustment of house prices. Many 

European countries, including Ireland, Spain, and 

the United Kingdom, have experienced house 

price booms over the past decade. In recent 
months, house prices have started to decline in 
Ireland and the United Kingdom, while in other 

countries growth rates have come down 

substantially. It is difficult to predict the 

magnitude of the correction, but simple indicators 

of sustainability, such as the ratios of prices to 

rents and of prices to income, remain significantly 

above their historical averages. Commercial real 

estate prices are also declining in the United 
Kingdom. Although some
 asset price corrections 
are already built into the outlook, a more abrupt 

or sizable adjustment would depress economic 

activity further and could trigger financial 

decelerator effects.  
 On the positive side, households in many 
advanced European countries have lower debt-to-
income ratios than their U.S. counterparts, making 

them less sensitive to changes in credit conditions. 

A number of studies suggest that the effects of 

changes in house prices on consumption are 

relatively small in Europe, because equity 

withdrawal is less prevalent than in the United 

States. In addition, there is very limited or no 

domestic subprime lending in most countries, 
which should limit the extent of homegrown 
credit problems. Even in the few countries that do 

have a subprime mortgage marketŠsuch as the 

United KingdomŠthe share of subprime loans in 

total loans is much smaller than in the United 

States. Finally, the historically high rate of 

employment should support domestic demand in 

the near term. 
 Upside risks to the inflation outlook include 
further increases in oil and agricultural prices and 

the possibility of an acceleration of wage growth, 

given the high capacity utilization and tight labor 

conditions throughout Europe. Downside risks 

are a deepening of the financial turmoil, further 
euro appreciation, and a reversal of commodity 
prices.Policy Challenges  
 The immediate task facing policymakers in 
Europe™s advanced economies is to minimize the impact of the financial market turmoil on the real 

economy, while maintaining hard-won inflation 

credibility and long-term fiscal sustainability. 
Parallel efforts to restore confidence in the 
financial system and improve the financial 

regulation and supervision framework should help 

safeguard financial stability. Meeting these 

challenges will also help emerging economies, 

which are vulnerable to further disruptions of the 

global financial system. Monetary policymakers face a 
delicate balancing act The combination of rising inflationary 
pressures, increasing downside risks to growth, and high volatility in financial markets creates a 
particularly challenging environment for monetary 

policy authorities. Inflation is set to move higher 

in the near term, although it should come down 

later as slower demand growth tempers pressures 

on capacity and commodity price growth 

moderates. However, with labor markets still tight, 

wage and price pressures (ﬁsecond-round effectsﬂ) 

may intensify. Because the appropriate monetary 
policy response in the current circumstances depends on the likelihood of such effects 

materializing, policymakers are closely monitoring 

the outcome of ongoing private and public sector 

wage negotiations in several European countries.
3If real wages adjust flexibly and inflation 

expectations remain anchored, monetary policy 

authorities can accommodate the commodity price 

rise, thereby minimizing the impact on growth. 
_______ 
3 To ensure that the rise in inflation remains temporary, real wage growth needs to slow
 temporarily relative to 
productivity. Resisting the adju
stment of real wages would 
exert further upward pressure on prices and lead companies 
to scale back employment. The 
agreements that
 have been 
completed so far suggest that wa
ge pressures are likely to be contained. REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 8 The challenge for individual central banks is to 
find the right policy balance for their economies. 
The European Central Bank (ECB) has 

appropriately kept interest rates on hold through 

the end of March. However, policymakers should 
stand ready to respond flexibly to changes in the 
economic environment. While current inflation is 

uncomfortably high, prospects point to its falling 

back below 2 percent during 2009 in the context 

of an increasingly negative outlook for activity. 

Accordingly, the ECB can afford some easing of 

the policy stance. The Bank of England has 

reduced its policy rate by a cumulative ½ 
percentage point since last summer. There may be 
room for some further monetary policy easing as 
downside risks to growth have increased, and 

inflation may undershoot the target at the two-

year policy horizon. At the other end of the 

spectrum, the decision of the Swedish central 

bank to increase its policy rate by ¼ percentage 
point in February was justified by strong demand 

pressures, high capacity utilization, and rising 

costs. Future policy moves by individual central 
banks will depend on shifts in the balance of risks 
to inflation. 
Fiscal policy: allow automatic stabilizers to operate
 Under the baseline forecast, policymakers 
should allow automatic stabilizers to cushion the 

downturn. Most advanced European economies 

have larger automatic stabilizers and more 

extensive social safety nets than the United States. 

A number of countries have reined in their fiscal 

deficits during the recent economic upswing, 
freeing space for stabilizers to operate fully in the 
downturn (Table 2). However, in economies that 

are close to the boundaries set by their fiscal rules 

(France, Italy, and Portugal), stabilizers should be 

allowed to operate only as long as adjustment 

toward medium-term objectives continues. It will 

be important not to jeopardize the process of 

improving public balance sheets in preparation for 

the coming rise in population aging-related 
expenditure.  If downside risks materialize and growth 
contracts to near-recession levels, discretionary 

fiscal stimuli would be warranted in countries 

where medium-term objectives are well in hand. 

Normally, monetary policy should be the first line 
of defense in case of a global slowdown. 
However, if financial dislocations weaken the 

normal monetary transmission mechanism, a 

timely, temporary, and well-
targeted fiscal stimulus could be effective in supporting the economy. An 

example of a specific measure is a one-off tax 

rebate to low-income households. Most fiscal 

rules (including the Stability and Growth Pact, or 

SGP) allow for temporary deviations from targets 
in cases of a sharp economic downturn. The 
stimulus should be unwound once the economy 

has stabilized: if fiscal sustainability becomes a 

concern, long-term interest rates may rise, 

reducing the effectiveness of the stimulus.   
Confidence in the financial system needs to be restored Financial sector policies in the short term 
should aim to improve transparency and restore 

confidence in financial markets. As long as 

uncertainty about asset va
luations and concerns 
about the health of financ
ial institutions persist, 
banks will remain overly cautious in their lending 

behavior, and the effectiveness of a monetary 

stimulus of the economy will be limited.
4Policymakers also need to put in place reforms to 
_______ 
4 So far, there have been no failures of major financial 
institutions in Europe beca
use capital has been injected 
promptly. The U.K. authorities had to nationalize a medium-
sized mortgage lender that
 relied heavily on wholesale 
funding and mortgage securitization. Germany salvaged two 
small banks that were heavily ex
posed to products related to 
the U.S. subprime market. A few large European financial 

institutions have received capita
l injections from shareholders 
or other sources, strengthening their capital positions. 
Nonetheless, uncertainty abou
t the magnitude of potential 
losses in the financial sy
stem and concerns about 
counterparty risk remain (Chapter 2).

Emerging EconomiesGrowth to Decrease from High 
Levels; Inflation Remains a Concern Growth in the emerging economies 
substantially outpaced growth in the rest of 
Europe in 2007, continuing the process of 

convergence (Table 1 and Figure 8). Activity was 
supported by strong domestic demand, including 

buoyant residential investment. Fiscal stimulus 
added to demand pressures in a number of 
countries, including the Baltics, Romania, and 

Serbia. Concerns that some economies may be 

overheating intensified as current account deficits 

continued to widen, inflation picked up sharply, 

and, in some cases, wage growth significantly 

outpaced productivity.  
 The rapid rise in headline inflation was driven 
mostly by food and energy prices, but core 

inflation pressures also intensified. Food price 
increases have had a particularly large effect on 

headline inflation in emerging EuropeŠespecially 

in southeastern Europe, the Baltics, and 

UkraineŠowing to the large share of food in the 

consumption baskets, local supply shocks, and 
convergence pressures (see Box 3). 
 Economic activity mode
rated in a few countries in the early part of 2007 for idiosyncratic reasons. 

Hungary™s tightening of public finances to achieve 

fiscal sustainability depressed private consumption 

and investment. Activity also weakened in Turkey, 
reflecting a sharp, drought-related drop in 
agricultural production, the lagged effect of earlier 

monetary tightening, and the renewed strength of 

the lira. Growth in Latvia and Estonia slowed and 

house prices started to decline as foreign banks 

lowered the rates of credit expansion.  Emerging Europe will be affected by the 
turbulence in financial markets and the slowdown 

in advanced economies. Growth momentum from 

continuing integration into the European 

economy and the benefits from past structural 

reforms should strengthen the resilience of the 

region. However, the economies™ greater openness 

to trade and financial flows leaves them vulnerable 

to spillovers from global developments. Based on 
the latest available data for imports, retail sales, 
and credit growth, some softening of activity is 

becoming apparent in several economies, 

including the Baltics and Slovenia. Confidence 

indicators have also turned down since last 

summer (Figure 9).

OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING TURBULENT WATERS 11Box 2.  Financial Turbulence: Policy Lessons 
Against the backdrop of growing concerns about counterparty cre
dit risks, a range of financia
l policies may be required to 
rebuild counterparty confidenceŠwhich is an immediate priority to reduce systemic threats and spilloversŠand set the 
stage for more medium-term reforms, aimed at rein
forcing the financial soundness of institutions.  
In the short term, continued efforts will be needed in the following areas: 
Providing liquidity. Central banks should continue to provide liquidity in the interbank market to mitigate the rise in the 
cost of wholesale funds. 
Improving transparency. Lack of reliable information about exposures and risks leads to possible misperceptions and 
heightened risk aversion. While loss recognition on the side of financial institutions remains essential (Chapter 2), 
supervisory authorities should seek to fill information gaps about the vulnerabilities of national financial institutions 
and markets, highlighting plans to restore financial soundness. 
Raising bank capital.
 To strengthen confidence and prevent capital reductions from constraining lending, banks with 
weak capital positions should be strongly encouraged to raise capital. In some instances, supervisors may need to direct 
banks to suspend dividend payments and share buybacks in order to preserve capital ratios.
Over the medium term, more fundamental changes are needed to ensure institutions manage risks well:  
Enhancing supervisory oversight of risk management
. Regulators should provide incentives for financial institutions to review 
and improve their internal risk management.  
Building capital buffers. Banks must maintain sufficient capital to absorb shocks from the reduction in mark-to-market 
valuations or losses on asset sales. This would reassure coun
terparties that access to funding can be sustained, including 
during periods of severe turbulence. Indeed, whenever the supervisors identify deficiencies, the second pillar of the 
Basel II capital accord should be used to ensure that banks hold additional capital beyond the minimum requirement 
identified by risk weights or by internal models under the first pillar. 
Monitoring balance sheet leverage
. Bank supervisors need to consider balance sheet leverage more carefully when assessing 
capital adequacy. In line with the Basel II framework, market
 and liquidity risks accompan
ying balance sheet growth 
need to be properly considered for capital adequacy purpos
es. Particular vigilance is needed toward banks that are 
characterized by an asset base that (1) is mostly subject to mark-to-market valuations, (2) is highly dependent on 
markets for funding, or (3) has a high degree of leverage. 
Managing liquidity risks. Banks need to improve their management of liquidity risk. This may include improving the 
assessment of backup contingency lines and conducting regula
r, well-calibrated stress test exercises. Supervisors also 
need to be more proactive in identifying cases of underinsurance against liquidity risks. 
Strengthening regulation of off-balance-sheet entities.
 Incentives to set up off-balance-sheet entities should be reduced, while 
stricter rules are needed on their use by banks. Disclos
ure should be improved so that investors can assess the 
sponsor™s risk to the entity. Supervisors may also need to strengthen guidelines regarding the circumstances under 
which risk transfers to off-balance-sheet entities warrant capital relief.

When the failure of an institution poses
 a systemic threat, public assistance 
may need to be considered, but the institution™s shareholders must bear the full brunt, and clear mechanisms 
must be implemented to ensure that operations will continue on a commercial basis, with an unambiguous 
plan for exit by the public sector. Resolution should avoid adding to pressures of distressed debt sales, as 
this may force banks to become undercapitalized, leading to costly strains on insured depository institutions. 
Reinforcing cross-border supervisory cooperation
. Rapidly increasing cross-border integration in advanced Europe, as 
well as stronger reliance of emerging European economies on concentrated foreign funding, underscores the 
need for greater cross-border supervisory cooperation in the European Union (see also Boxes 4 and 5 in 
Chapter 2). The expansion abroad of local banks also raises new challenges. The ongoing implementation of 
the Basel II capital accord has called for more effect
ive cross-border coordination among bank supervisors.
 The baseline outlook is for a relatively soft 
landing, with projected growth rates for most of 

the region remaining close to IMF staff estimates 

of potential growth. More specifically, growth is 

expected to slow from 6.9 percent in 2007 to 5.5 

percent in 2008, and soften somewhat further in 

2009 (Figure 1 and Table 1). Headline inflation is 

expected to come down in the second half of 2008 

as food and commodity prices moderate. The 
projection assumes that domestic demand will 
continue to provide impetus to growth as external 

demand weakens and that the disruption of 

financial flows to the region will be contained. 

However, the downside risks are substantial, 

especially for countries with large external 

imbalances. The highest potential risk is a 

significant retrenchment in foreign investors™ 

exposure to the region.  
 The impact of the turmoil in financial markets 
so far has been greater in emerging Europe than 

in other emerging markets, reflecting the region™s 

high dependence on external financing. With 

foreign banksŠwhich dominate the banking 

system in most of the regionŠstarting to pass on 
the increase in their cost of funds, lending rates 
are rising, although real lending rates still remain 

low. The cost of market financing has also gone 

up (Figure 10), and access to market funds has 
become more difficult. External debt spreads have 
widened substantially, and equity markets have 
sold off. Bond issuance by the private sector has 

contracted sharply since mid-2007 (Figure 11). As 

a result, credit growth rates have started to fallŠ

from very high levelsŠin several countries, 
including the Baltics and Croatia. In Turkey, 
funding to domestic banks from securitized loans 

has contracted, and there are concerns that 
syndicated loans may also be slowing and that

OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING TURBULENT WATERS 13Box 3.  Understanding Food Price Inflation in Emerging Europe 
Headline inflation in Europe has increased sharply since the summer of 2007, driven mostly by a rise in global 
commodity prices. World food prices rose by 40 percent (in U.S. dollars) since May 2007 as demand for biofuel 
production surged, while poor wheat harvests in 
Europe, North America, and Australia restricted 
supply. The steady rise in oil prices also fueled the 
inflation pressures.The impact of food price increases on headline 
inflation has been larger in Europe™s emerging 
economies than in the advanced economies (first 
figure). What are the factors that can explain this 
difference? 
Food prices have a much larger weight in the 
consumption baskets of emerging market 
economies due to these countries™ lower average 
income levels (second figure). In 2007, the share 
of food in the consumer price index averaged 14 
percent in the advanced European economies, 22 
percent in the new EU members, and above 40 
percent in Albania, Belarus, and Ukraine. 
Because the price levels of most agricultural 
commodities in emerging economies are lower 
than in the advanced economies, a similar absolute 
price increase across Europe would lead to a 
greater increase in percentage terms in emerging 
Europe. 
The upward trajectory of food prices in emerging 
Europe was exacerbated by local supply shocks 
(poor weather conditions). In Bulgaria, agricultural 
value added plummeted by 30 percent in 2007, in 
Romania it fell by 17 percent, and in Hungary and 
Turkey by 13 and 6 percent, respectively. These 
effects are expected to be transitory. 
Growing trade integration and the gradual convergence of wages also contributed to the 
faster pace of food price inflation in the emerging 
economies. In recent years, trade in food products 
increased rapidly, especially for the new EU member countries (third figure), putting pressure on local 
prices. Rising wages and transportation costs added to this pressure. Finally, income convergence is 
increasing local demand, especially for higher-value-add
ed food items. These trends are likely to continue 
until full integration has been achieved.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 14liquidity in the currency swap markets, which 
domestic banks use to transform foreign currency 
funding into local currency, may be drying up. 
Uncertainty around the Outlook Is 
Substantial; Risks Are Skewed to the 

Downside  
 First, there is significant uncertainty about the 
duration and depth of the global downturn and 

the magnitude of spillovers to emerging Europe. 

IMF staff analysis (Box 1) suggests that emerging 

European economies may be more vulnerable to a 

global slowdown than the advanced economies in 
Europe. The direct trade effect from a sharp 

downturn abroad is likely to be significant because countries in the region are highly open, with 
exports accounting for 30 to 80 percent of GDP. 

Most exports are going to other European 

economies. The share of exports going to oil-

producing countries and the dynamic emerging 

economies in AsiaŠwhich are likely to be less 

affected by the current downturnŠis very small. 

A sharper-than-expected global slowdown would 

also increase the severity of financial contagion.  
Box 3 (concluded)
In terms of policy response, containing the second-
round effects of the sharp increase in inflation will be 
essential. Monetary policy may need to be tightened to 
prevent a wage-price spiral in countries with floating 
exchange rates. Good communication with the public 
may helpŠpolicymakers should make it clear that 
most factors driving the increase in inflation are 
temporary and that inflation is expected to return to 
target in the medium term. Price controls should be 
avoided since they would introduce distortions and 
inefficiencies into the market. Instead, there may be a 
case for providing targeted temporary subsidies to the 
most vulnerable social groups. Competition in the 
retail and distribution sectors should be encouraged to 
reduce markups and ease price pressures.

OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING TURBULENT WATERS 15 Second, the extent of moderation of food price 
inflation in 2008 is difficult to predict. While the 

effect of domestic supply shocks is likely to wear 

off, convergence factors and heightened global 

demand for biofuel products could continue to 
exert upward pressure. Also, oil prices may rise 
further amid tight supply. The impact of rising 

energy prices would be especially large in Ukraine 

and Moldova, where gas prices still need to 

converge to world levels.  
 Third, the heavy dependence on foreign capital 
leaves the region exposed to an abrupt 
retrenchment of capital inflows. Emerging Europe 
relies more heavily than other emerging 
economies on foreign inflows intermediated by 

the banking system. In the Baltics, Romania, 

Serbia, and Ukraine, more than 25 percent of 

domestic lending is financed by borrowing abroad, 

and the share has been rising (see Box 5 in 

Chapter 2). Rapid credit growth, fueled by capital 
inflows, has boosted economic activity in recent 
years. A sharp decline would dampen both 

consumption and investment. 
 The extent to which foreign banks will curtail 
lending in response to the financial turmoil in 

mature markets is highly uncertain. It is likely to 
depend on the health of parent banks, their access 
to funding, and the size and concentration of their 

exposures to emerging markets. The foreign banks 

with the greatest involvement in emerging Europe 

have little (known) direct exposure to U.S. 

subprime mortgages; however, the heavy reliance 

of some of them on interbank loans for financing 

increases the risks of indirect contagion. 
Scandinavian banks are attempting to gradually 
reduce credit growth to the region to avoid 
triggering sharp asset price declines that would 

weaken their balance sheets.   
 If downside risks materialize, countries with 
greater imbalances will be more susceptible to 

shifts in confidence. Economies with large current 
account deficits or high external debt ratios would 
be especially vulnerable if foreign financing dried 

up (Figure 12). A number of countries experienced stock market and house price 
booms in recent years, raising concerns about 

potential asset price bubbles (Figure 13). Since 

mid-2007, stock prices have fallen sharply and 

house prices are starting to come down in some 

countries. Large, abrupt asset price adjustments 

would weaken banks™ balance sheets and 

consumer confidence, and might trigger 

financial decelerator effects (see Chapter 3 for a 
detailed discussion of vulnerabilities).

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 16Policy Focus: Reducing Imbalances 
and Ensuring a Soft Landing  
 In those emerging economies still experiencing 
overheating pressures, policies should remain 

focused on dampening domestic demand, 

reducing domestic and external imbalances, and 

preventing second-round effects from the sharp 

increase in inflation:  
In countries with flexible exchange rate 
regimes, monetary policy needs to bring down 

the rate of inflation. With wages rising faster 
than productivity in some countries and little 
slack in the labor markets, preventing the 

temporary wave of inflation from feeding into 
wage growth will be important to avoid a 
further loss of competitiveness. The central 
banks in Poland, the Czech Republic, 
Romania, and Serbia appropriately raised their 

policy rates in early 2008 to ensure that the temporary rise in commodities inflation does 
not trigger a wage-price spiral. Further policy 
tightening may be needed in several countries, 
especially Russia, to achieve a reduction in 

inflation. In some economies, an appreciation 
of the exchange rate has helped contain 
inflation pressures. Fiscal tightening should 
complement monetary policy in cooling off 
economic activity.   
In countries with fixed or heavily managed 
exchange rates, fiscal restraint remains the key 
tool for controlling overheating.  
Restraining the growth of public sector wages will help moderate private sector wage 
demands (especially in Bulgaria, Estonia, 
Latvia, and Romania). 
However, with the cycle already turning in a 
number of countries, concerns about overheating 

are giving way to worries about the imbalances 
that have built up during the cyclical upswing. The 
risks of a hard landing have increased, and 
countries with greater imbalances may be 
especially vulnerable. Policymakers need to be  
ready to adapt policies flexibly to the changing 
circumstances: 
Under the baseline forecast, overheating pressures will dissipate, as demand falls in line 
with potential output. In this scenario, policies 
will need to focus less on demand management. However, reducing 
vulnerabilities and implementing reforms that 
raise potential output should remain top policy 
priorities.  
In the case of a greater-than-expected 
slowdown, automatic fiscal stabilizers should 
be allowed to play fully. There would be 
relatively little room for discretionary fiscal 
policy, especially in the new member states that 

are either close to the deficit limit of 3 percent 
of GDP under the SGP or have sizable current 
account deficits and external debt levels. For 
countries with floating exchange rates, 
monetary easing could also be an option once 
inflation pressures dissipate.5Continued emphasis on strengthening the 
resilience of the financial system and 
implementing structural reforms would help 
reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate the risks of a 
sharp growth slowdown. As demonstrated by the 
Russian crisis in 1998, investors do differentiate 
among countries on the basis of fundamentals, 
even in times of a generalized increase in risk 
aversion. To minimize the possibility of 
disruptions in the functioning of the domestic 

financial systems, policymakers should step up 
oversight (including nonbank financial sector 
supervision), bring regulations in line with best 
practices, and strengthen cross-border supervisory 
cooperation. The introduction and enforcement 

of prudential measures, such as limits on loan-to-
value ratios and higher reserve requirements for 
foreign borrowing, would create buffers that could

policymakers might have little

OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING TURBULENT WATERS 17improve adjustment to shocks. Tightening the 
disclosure requirements for risk management and 
internal control would encourage better risk 
control and enhance transparency. At the same 
time, structural reforms that help reduce 
vulnerabilities and raise potential  
outputŠsuch as increasing labor market 
flexibility, fostering competition, strengthening the 

quality of institutions, enforcing the rule of law, 

and improving the business climateŠshould 

continue.
192. Financial Turbulence: Testing Resilience 
and Dampening Growth  A global reappraisal of cr
edit risk and a repricing of 
financial assets commenced in the summer of 2007 against 

the background of mounting tensions in the U.S. subprime 
mortgage market. Reflecting the pervasive uncertainty about 
the magnitude of the risks faced by financial institutions, 

frictions spread across asset classes and throughout Europe. 

Despite the severity of the crisis, Europe™s financial systems 

have remained relatively resilient thus far. Yet financial 

system resilience is likely to be tested further, as loss 

recognition catches up and additional risks remain on the 

horizon. Although quantification is subject to considerable 

uncertainty and evidence so far is limited, financial 
turbulence is likely to take a significant toll on real activity.
*How Financial Turbulence Spread to Europe 
 A reappraisal of credit risk and a repricing of 
financial assets began in the summer of 2007, 

stemming from mounting creditworthiness 

problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage market. 

After a period of high liquidity, aggressive credit 

expansion, growing complexity in mortgage 

securitization, and loosening in underwriting 

standards, credit markets abruptly changed 
direction. The pervasive uncertainty about the 
valuation of structured finance productsŠand the 
lack of clarity surrounding the extent of bank on- 

and off-balance-sheet exposures to these 
instrumentsŠtriggered a reversal in market 

sentiment and set the stage for a severe liquidity 

squeeze. The turmoil quickly spread to Europe, 

prompting bank rescues and capital injections. 

Despite the width and depth of the crisis, 

European mortgage markets have remained largely

Global Risk Repricing and   
Spillovers Since end-July 2007, global financial markets

from low historical standards, as investors are 

demanding more compensation for the credit risk

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 20not, so far, been particularly notable with regard 
to the absolute level reached by risk premiums, 

the speed of the reversal in market sentiment has 

been remarkable. Besides, the complexity of 

financing structures and risk transfer strategies in 
the financial sector are prolonging the repricing 
process, causing risks to propagate in pervasive 

and unexpected ways.  
 With the increased presence of international 
investorsŠreacting to any given shock by 

rebalancing their portfolios in assets and markets 
that would otherwise seem to be unrelatedŠthe 
abrupt shift in risk-taking attitude turned out to be 
the key channel through which financial 

turbulence spread from the U.S. mortgage market 

to other assets and countries, including advanced 

and emerging Europe.
7 In advanced Europe, the rise in uncertainty and 

the drop in confidence among major banks have 

severely disrupted the interbank market, with 

money center banks becoming unable to finance 

large securities portfolios in wholesale markets 

(Table 3).
8 Spreads between the three-month euro 
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) and the 

overnight index swap (OIS) rate have remained 

wide, indicating some combination of greater 
preference for liquidity over unsecured lending to banks and widening counterparty risk premiums

of transmission during periods 
of financial distress includes, 
for example, Kumar and Persaud (2002), Gai and Vause 
(2006), Coudert and Gex (2007), and Gonzalez-Hermosillo (2008).8 Theoretically, a number of recent studies have explained 
that an asset™s market liquidityŠ
the ease with which an asset is tradedŠand traders™ funding liquidityŠthe ease with 

which traders can obtain fundingŠ(1) are inherently related 
to uncertainty, (2) comove with the market, and (3) have 
commonalities across securities. In particular, see 

Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2007), Caballero and 
Krishnamurthy (2007), and Adrian and Shin (2008). 
(Figure 15, panel 1).9 Owing to cash hoarding by 
international investors, sovereign bond markets 
have also come under strain (Figure 15, panel 2), 

with underbidding in some auctions for Italian 

notes and liquidity tightening in the Greek 

government debt market. Global risk repricing has 

also contributed more than 50 percent to the rise 

in volatility in corporate bond markets; the 

notable exception to this has been the financial 

sector, where uncertainty has been related mainly 
to institution-specific factors (Table 3). In a sign 
of discrimination among different classes of credit 
risk, the correction has primarily halted activity 
and widened the spreads of the high-yield segment 

of the European corporate bond market (Figure 

15, panel 3).10 Emerging markets remained initially unaffected 
by the financial turmoil, bolstered by improved 
fundamentals and financial buffers built up over 

recent years. Nonetheless, European emerging 

markets™ bond spreads rose significantly in the 

first quarter of 2008 (Figure 15, panel 4). Higher

300REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 22domestic loan markets, while enhancing financial 
stability in the region. Subprime loansŠwhich 

account for about one-tenth of total mortgage 

lending in the United StatesŠare virtually 

nonexistent in continental Europe and represent a 
limited share of the total mortgage stock in the 
United Kingdom.
11 The adequate debt-servicing 
capacity of European borrowers provides a buffer 
during volatile periods in the real estate market. 

Most important, though, national boundaries, more cautious risk management, and stricter 

regulation make banks in most of Europe slow to 

adopt those risky financial innovations in 

secondary mortgage markets that have proved 
problematic in the United States. Despite their 
recent decline, retail deposits still constitute more 

than half of the funding source for housing 

finance in European Unio
n (EU) member states. 
Securitization characterizes less than one-third of 

total mortgage financing and relies mainly on 

covered bondsŠplain vanilla debt instruments 

regulated by EU legislation and secured against a 

pool of mortgages that remains on the balance 
sheet of the issuer. Loan-to-value ratios, prudent 
property valuation rules, and special investor 

protection reinforce the relative safety of 

European mortgage-covered bond markets, while 

allowing lenders to obtain comparatively cheap 

funds in capital markets and benefit from 

relatively low regulatory risk weightings.
12 Emerging Europe™s mortgage market deserves, 

nonetheless, a note of caution. Housing loans 

have contributed significantly to the rapid credit 

growth experienced by the region, as well as to 

sustained increases in real asset prices. Given the 
importance of these assets as loan collateral, a 

downward adjustment in house prices might lead 

to increased provisioning requirements for banks and ultimately larger losses if delinquencies rise, 
adding to concerns about regional financial 

vulnerabilities. Moreover, the overall net asset

remains relatively lowŠboth in absolute terms 

and compared with the euro areaŠcontributing to 

the risks of a slowdown in the housing market. 
Impact on Financial System 
ResilienceResilient So Far . . .  Europe™s financial systems have thus far held 
up relatively well. With the subprime fallout 

translating into direct investment losses, higher 

funding costs, heightened uncertainty about 
funding availability, widespread reassessments of 
credit and counterparty risk, and large 

unanticipated assumptions of off-balance-sheet 

assets, financial systems have been tested. Yet, 

based on the information available through end-

March 2008, the soundness of the major systemic 

players has been preserved, as shareholders and 

outside investors have injected fresh capital where 

needed. As a result, while capital ratios have been 
affected, those of the large and complex banking 
groups in the euro area have continued to exceed 

the regulatory minimums. However, liquidity 

remains seriously impaired despite aggressive 

responses by major central banks.  
 The continuing growth in lending in Europe 
thus far has also been suggestive of a relatively 
resilient banking system, even though this could 

be partly due to reintermediation (Figure 16).
13 In advanced economies, where corporate lending has 

remained robust, household lending has continued 

its deceleration, which had begun well before the 

crisis broke out last summer. Credit standards 

have tightened across the board, but not as 

sharply as in the United StatesŠin part because 
they had not been loosened by as much to begin 
with. Meanwhile, many emerging economies have 

continued to register rapid credit growth. While a 

cooling of credit growth has become apparent in 

some countries, this development has mostly _______ 
13 European Central Bank (2008). FINANCIAL TURBULENCE: TESTING RESILIENCE AND DAMPENING GROWTH 23preceded the onset of the current episode of 
financial turmoil and has in most cases also been 

considered helpful in dealing with overheating 

pressures. Individual financial institutions, however, have 
reported substantial write-offs. As markets 
reassessed risks, large money-center banks and 

major financial institutions booked extensive 

write-downs of structured securities, prompting  

credit downgrades and increases in default risk 
premiums. As the reassessment continued, 
European banks in several countries were forced 
to reintegrate into their balance sheets exposures 

to special investment conduits and structured 

investment vehicles. This resulted in significant 

changes in the market value of assets and the 

book value of short-term liabilities over the period 

January 2007ŒJanuary 2008 (Figure 17).. . . But Markets Remain Concerned 
 Market-based estimates of default frequencies 

have risen, but from a low base and to a lesser 

extent than in the United States (Figure 18). 

Considering a sample of 226 European and 666 

U.S. banks, the time pattern of expected default 

frequencies (EDFs) derived using Moody™s KMV 
CreditEdge methodology suggests that, while the 
risk of bank default within the next year has risen 
since the onset of the subprime crisis, it remains 
relatively small.
14 The resilience of European banks has also been less affected than that of the 
U.S. banks in the sample, particularly for the worst 
10th percentile.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 24 Implied spreads on credit default swaps suggest 
a similar picture (Figures 19 and 20). Banks have 
seen their credit default swap spreads widen 

significantly, suggesting a sharp rise in their risk 

profiles. The higher price for market risk (i.e., a 

higher Sharpe ratio) is one factor that has 

contributed to the widening of spreads. But, 

particularly for exposed banks, the market appears 

to have priced in a generalized increase in asset 

volatility due to concerns about asset quality, 
worsening liquidity conditions, and associated fire 
sales. Rising market leverage has been a further 

contributing factor, particularly for institutions 
that have had to expand their balance sheets 
unexpectedly due to exposures to special 

investment conduits and structured investment 
vehicles. 
 The market™s evaluation of assets under distress 
suggests that the quality of system assets has 

deteriorated to below investment grade. As shown 

in Figure 21, this deterioration in asset quality has 

produced a progressive shift in the curve linking 

an increasing share of total assets to higher 

expected default frequencies. At the beginning of 

2007, market prices implied that, for banks with 
an investment grade, none of the assets were 
under distress, whereas by the end of January 2008 

as much as 40 percent of these assets were below 

investment grade.15Loss Recognition Needs to Catch Up   Direct exposures to the U.S. subprime 

mortgage markets have been a main driver of 
write-downs by European banks. With direct net 
exposures of global banks to U.S. subprime 

mortgage markets estimated at about $700 billion, 

European banks hold about 40 percent of this 

amount. Compared with U.S. banks, European 

banks are relatively less exposed to unsecuritized

FINANCIAL TURBULENCE: TESTING RESILIENCE AND DAMPENING GROWTH 25subprime mortgage loans and subprime mortgage-
related collateralized debt obligations (CDOs); 

however, they are relatively more exposed to 

subprime mortgage-related asset-backed securities 

(ABS) (Table 4).  
 The losses incurred by banks on these 
exposures are estimated to be significant. As of 
March 2008, expected losses on subprime 

mortgage-related exposures are estimated at $123 

billion in Europe and $144 billion in the United 

States (Table 5). These estimates reflect the 

following scenario on a large sample of banks: 

average losses of 15 percent on unsecuritized 

mortgage loans, 30 percent on ABSs, 60 percent 

on CDOs, and 5 percent on liquidity lines to off-
balance-sheet conduits and special investment 
vehicles (SIVs). For Europe, CDOs account for 

the largest share of these losses, followed by losses 

incurred on ABSs and off-balance-sheet liquidity 

lines. These estimates remain subject to a margin 

of uncertainty, as they are sensitive to assumptions 

and their underlying determinants continue to 

evolve.16 These findings suggest that loss recognition will 

need to catch up. While several European banks 

have disclosed large losses, the aggregate number 

so far (roughly $80 billion as of March 2008) still 

falls short of the total estimate. The concern, 

therefore, is that financial institutions in Europe 

still need to own up to larger losses of 
approximately $43 billion.  
_______ 
16 For precise details on the ca
lculation of expected losses, 
see IMF (2008a). 
The Test Is Not Over  Financial system resilience in advanced Europe 
is likely to be tested further. 
As the crisis in U.S. subprime mortgage 
products deepens, this will inevitably negatively 

affect the direct exposures held by Europe™s 

financial institutions. With U.S. housing 
market conditions yet to stabilize, additional 
bouts of distress remain highly plausible in the 
mortgage markets. Such episodes would 
further lower the value of securitized and 

structured products and exacerbate existing 
losses.The continuing financial distress is likely to 
accelerate the spread of the crisis to other 
forms of debt and debt default insurance. Asset quality is already deteriorating, or 
expected to deteriorate, for other forms of 

debt, such as other types of consumer debt 
(credit card, auto, and prime mortgage loans), 
commercial property loans, and corporate 
leveraged loans. Changes in the credit ratings 
of bond insurers could also translate into more 

credit losses for banks and investors. More generally, the market for debt default 
insurance, which has not yet been tested in a downturn, is also at risk. At this point, 
however, it is difficult to predict how an 

additional failure in one segment of the 
financial system would spread to other Table 5. Estimated Losses on

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 26segments, and how this would play out 
precisely for Europe™s financial systems.  
Equally significant, however, the slowing of 
global growth is likely to add to existing 
challenges. First, the deteriorating economic 
outlook could weaken European household 

and corporate balance sheets appreciably, even 
though they have from the outset generally 
been stronger than in the United States. 
Second, financial institutions™ attempts to 
preserve profitability, solvency, and liquidity 

are bound to off-load some of these evolving 
pressures to the real economy, an outcome that could not only amplify the growth 
slowdown but also feed back into the 
performance of financial systems. Third, if the 
crisis spilled over into emerging Europe, the 
profits of foreign banks that are significantly 

exposed to the region would be reduced, 
thereby weakening the banks™ soundness.  
The impact of these risks on financial system 
resilience would manifest itself in several ways. 
First, deteriorating asset quality would amplify 
existing investment losses and reduce profitability 
and retained earnings. Second, if additional assets 
needed to be taken onto the balance sheet as a 
result of contingent credit lines, this would 

compound existing problems through an increase 
in leverage and a deterioration in asset quality. 
Third, as the need for additional capital injections 
intensifies, the availability of outside capital may 
decline. Fourth, liquidity risk could create further 

trouble if price discovery in previously well-
established markets continues to be hampered and 
institutions are forced to sell at fire-sale prices to 
meet unexpected liquidity demands. Finally, the 
potential for extreme events to spill over from one 

bank to anotherŠboth domestically and across 
bordersŠhas increased over time and represents 
an additional source of stress (Box 4).  
Although emerging Europe™s financial systems 
have generally fared well thus far, they face 
increasing risks: 
While the impact of the credit turmoil was 
relatively muted until early 2008, signs of 
spillovers have started to emerge. Limited 
direct exposures to complex structured products are a mitigating factor. But downside 
risks have risen, as tighter global liquidity could significantly curtail credit growth and problems 
in parent banks could easily be transmitted 
across borders. Evidence of such spillovers has 
surfaced. For example, sovereign debt markets 
have begun to be affected. Also, private bond 
issuance has fallen sharplyŠthough from a 
low baseŠwhich could matter for banks that 
have relied on external financing to support rapid domestic credit growth. More generally, 
however, if credit growth were to slow 
considerably and standards tighten, there is the 
risk that asset quality would deteriorate where 
lending standards had previously been lax.  
Foreign bank presence may be a boon, but 
foreign banks could also be a destabilizing 
factor by importing or exporting financial 
instability. While a strong foreign bankpresence could help to contain domestic 
downturns, it would likely exacerbate financial 

instability in the case of more significant 
events, such as a parent bank™s experiencing 
liquidity shortages in the home country. If 
parent banks remain well capitalized, their 
financial support might lower the sensitivity of 

affiliates to local conditions and provide a 
measure of stability to local financial systems. 
Yet the concentration of international players 
in a number of countries and the similarity of 
their activities expose emerging economies to 

common-lender contagion risks (Box 5). 
Recent stress tests in emerging Europe suggest 
that these vulnerabilities could seriously affect 
financial system resilience. First, capital buffers 

were not always found to be sufficient to 
accommodate shocks that are severe but still 
plausible, a particular concern for the smaller 
banks. Yet, on the positive side, the results also 
suggest that, when consolidated with parent 

banks, capital buffers are generally substantial. 
Second, credit risk is usually the key risk, 
particularly when the indirect effects of currency 
and interest rate risk are included. Foreign
FINANCIAL TURBULENCE: TESTING RESILIENCE AND DAMPENING GROWTH 27Box 4.  Spillover Risks among Major EU Banks 
The scope for cross-border spillovers among the major European banks can be examined using the extreme 
value theory framework. This framework analyzes como
vements between extreme ev
ents (ﬁco-exceedancesﬂ), 
specifically the comovement of extreme negative (left-tail) realizations of banks™ soundness measures. The 
soundness measure chosen in this analysis is the distance to default (DD), defined as the difference between the 
expected value of assets at maturity and the default threshold, which is a function of the value of the liabilities. A 
higher DD is associated with a lower probability of the bank™s default. It is generally a useful proxy for default 
risk if stocks are traded in liquid markets.  
The DDs for 27 of the largest EU banking groups were computed for May 2000ŒApril 2007 using daily stock 
prices and annual balance sheet data. A binomial logit model was used to estimate the probability of a bank 
experiencing a large negative DD change in response to large negative shocks to the DD changes of other banks. 
Large negative shocks were defined as those falling in the tenth percentile of the left tail of the common 
distribution of the changes in the DD across all banks. Four control variablesŠchanges in the slope of the term 
structure, and the volatility of the domestic, regional, and world stock market indicesŠwere also included in the 
model to account for common factors. 
The results (table) suggest that, although spillovers 
within domestic banking systems generally remain 
more likely, the potential for extreme events to spill 
over from one bank to another appears to have 
increased, both among domestic banks and across 
borders. The number of significant cross-border links 
is already larger than the number of significant links 
among domestic banks, underscoring the need for 
greater cross-border supervisory cooperation in the 
European Union.

ihák and Li Lian Ong. For details, see 
ihák and Ong (2007). 
currency lending is still substantial, and the 
majority of loans are made with flexible rates. 
Third, in most countries, individual name and 
industry concentration (particularly in real estate 

and construction) is important. Finally, the 
sustainability of liquidity positions depends 
critically on the level of commitment of the parent 
banks. This risk is mitigated when parent banks 
have ample liquidity and strong profit and capital 

buffers. At the same time, the growing access of 
domestic banks to nonparent financing requires 
careful monitoring of the maturity structure of 
such debt.Impact on the Real Economy 
 Empirically assessing the macroeconomic 
effects of the current 
financial turbulence is difficult. Indeed, existing macroeconomic models 
incorporate only a few elements of the many 

potential transmission channels through which the 
unfolding financial shocks may affect the real 
economy. Moreover, today™s turmoil is quite 
unprecedented, making estimates based on 
historical data less than fully reliable.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 28Box 5.  Regional Financial Interlinkages and Contagion Channels 
With the pace of private sector credit growth remaining brisk in emerging Europe, dependence on nondeposit 
funding has increased in many countries. High and rising loan-to-deposit ratios(LTDs) mirror increasing reliance 
on foreign funding channeled primarily through the bankin
g sector, given the relatively undeveloped domestic 
capital markets and easy access to cheap financing from the parent institutions of the mostly foreign-owned 
banks.1LTDs have been rising in most countries in the region, 
particularly in the Baltic countries, where they have 
roughly doubled since the early 2000s, and in Ukraine, 
Hungary, and Russia, where they ranged from 120 to 
150 percent in 2007. Except in a few cases (Moldova; 
Serbia; Macedonia, FYR; and Bosnia and 
Herzegovina), the changes in bank creditŒto-GDP 
ratios significantly exceeded those in the ratio of bank 
deposits to GDP, suggesting that credit growth has 
significantly outpaced deposit
 growth in recent years 
(first figure).  
The sizable cross-border financial linkages across 
Europe highlight the vulnerabilities arising from 
reliance on concentrated foreign funding. International 
banking statistics from the Bank for International 
Settlements provide consolidated foreign claims of 
reporting banks on individual countries (through both 
direct lending and local banking systems) and give a sense of the magnitude and distribution of exposures of 
emerging European countries to western European banking systems. Similarly, they provide exposures of 
western European countries to emerging European economies by the nationality of the reporting banks. 
Data suggest that most emerging European economies are heavily exposed toŠand dependent onŠwestern 
European banks (either directly or through the local banking systems). Exposures are significant, in relation to 
both the recipient countries™ GDP and the size of their banking system assets (second figure). 
Outstanding foreign claims owed to reporting banks in
 all western European banks are larger for emerging 
European countries whose banking systems are largely foreign owned: although risks in these countries should 
not be exaggerated where local bank lending is financed mainly by localdeposits, vulnerabilities could increase in 
the event of problems in parent banks. Exposures are al
so significant in terms of the host country™s banking 
sector assets for many countries; however, there are several notable exceptions, such as Russia, Turkey, and 
Ukraine.Note: The main authors of this box are Zsofia Arvai, Karl Driessen, Daniel Hardy, and 
nci Ötker-Robe. 
1In a few cases (e.g., Hungary, Latvia
, and Lithuania), the relatively large volume of money market instruments 
and bond issuance by banks has provided some support for funding.

FINANCIAL TURBULENCE: TESTING RESILIENCE AND DAMPENING GROWTH 29The concentration of funding exposure is contributing 
to the vulnerabilities associated with heavy reliance on 
foreign funding, particularly when it concerns the 
funding of banks.
2 Most countries in the region have 
concentrated exposures to banks in Austria, Italy, and 
Germany, and the Baltic countries have large exposures 
to Sweden (third figure). Among those most dependent 
on foreign funding, some are more diversified (e.g., the 
Czech Republic and Poland), while several depend on 
funding from a very few countries. Sweden provides 85 
percent of the external funding for the Baltic countries, 
while Austria holds at least 40 percent of the claims on 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, and the Slovak 
Republic, and more than 30 percent on Romania. 
Similarly, Italy provides more than 30 percent of foreign 
funding for Bulgaria, Croatia, and Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. 
Such concentration of funding renders emerging 
Europe vulnerable to a credit squeeze or crunch 
originating from advanced economies. Banking systems 
that are heavily dependent on foreign borrowing to 
support credit growth could face a sudden shortfall of 
funding or a sharp increase in its cost if there were a 
sudden reassessment of parent bank exposure to a host 
country (e.g., due to concerns about growing 
vulnerabilities in that country or region). While 
reputational risks could make it unlikely that parent 
banks would abandon their subsidiaries, unconditional 
support is unlikely. Liquidity or solvency problems in a 
parent bank could also be easily transmitted to local 
banks in a concentrated banking system. 
2  The vulnerabilities posed by nonbank borrowing are not of the same order as those posed by bank borrowing. 
If a corporate does not repay the foreign bank from whic
h it borrowed directly, the credit risk is borne by the 
foreign bank and not the local bank.

   1/ Funding exposure concerns bank and nonbank sectors in 

recipient countries. In countries with foreign bank ownership, 

consolidated claims include claims by foreign-owned banks on 

residents; net claims are lower to the extent that banks hold domestic 
deposits.
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 30Box 5 (concluded)
The impact of a retrenchment of credit would be 
amplified if funding from other (nonbank) sources were 
also limited. Some emerging European economies that 
turned to international capital markets for funding in 
recent years have seen demand decline significantly since 
August 2007 (e.g., Eurobond issuance by the Russian 
and Ukrainian financial sectors), and some banks in 
central and eastern Europe reportedly postponed their 
planned bond issues as a result of wider spreads. 
International bond issuance has been a negligible source 
of funding for most other countries in the region.  
The magnitude of western European bank exposures to 
emerging Europe is far smaller than the exposures of the 
latter, with the exception of Austria. For Austria, the 
claims of the reporting banks on emerging Europe 
amount to 23 percent of its banking system assets, 
though exposures seem well diversified across several 
countries and small with respect to each individual 
country. The exposures of banks in Belgium and Sweden 
to emerging Europe are also significant but remain 
below 10 percent of banking system assets. For the 
remaining countries, the exposures are negligible, 
including those of France, Germany, and Italy with the 
most active banks in central and southeastern Europe. 
However, even where the exposures seem well diversified, the ultimate impact of possible adverse developments 
in one country may be much more significant, as troubles in one country may spill over to others. Such regional 
spillovers could make even Austria™s exposures substantial. 
  Subject to these caveats, our analysis indicates 
that the macroeconomic impact of the turmoil is 

likely to be significant, especially in advanced 

economies in Europe, while uncertainty remains 

about the probability of a more severe credit 

squeeze that could result in further output losses. 

In Europe™s emerging economies, the output 

slowdown stemming from the direct impact of 
financial shocks, as well as the spillover effects 
from lower demand from advanced economies, 

are expected to curb the robust growth rates 
experienced by these economies in recent years. 

The output loss would be bigger in the event of a 

significant credit squeeze, especially in countries 

where the recent expansion has been largely 

driven by foreign borrowing and very rapid credit 

growth.Channels of Transmission to the Real Economy  
 The current financial turmoil will continue to 
affect the real economy through several channels. 
First, borrowing costs for firms and households 
are rising, in line with banks™ increasing funding 

costs, thereby adversely affecting investment and 

consumption decisions. Second, firms also face 

higher costs in issuing bonds and stocks, as 

corporate spreads and equity premiumsŠthe 

excess return of equity over the risk-free rateŠ

increase to compensate investors in the face of 

declining risk appetite.  
 On top of the effect on the price of credit, the 
financial turmoil is expected to have an adverse 

impact on the supply of credit, which, in turn,

  1/ Emerging Europe exposure to western European banks is defined as 
the share of the reporting banks in each western European country in the 
total outstanding claims on a given emerging European country (both 
bank and nonbank sectors). For example, about 42 percent of Croatia's 
exposures to western European reporting banks is owed to Austrian 

banks, 38 percent to Italian banks, 13 percent to French banks, etc. For 
the Baltic countries, 85 percent or more of exposures to the reporting 
banks is owed to Swedish banks.

FINANCIAL TURBULENCE: TESTING RESILIENCE AND DAMPENING GROWTH 31would dampen consumption and investment. 
First, banks™ higher funding costs reduce their 

liquidity and ability to extend loans.
17 More important, subprime-market-related losses 

incurred by banks in Europe™s advanced economies impair their capital adequacy and, 
hence, their lending capacity. Furthermore, the 

significant contraction in the issuance of 

structured products reduces financing 

opportunities for banks in these countries and 

their ability to extend credit.
18 While not directly exposed to the subprime market, banks in 

emerging Europe also face the risk of a credit 

squeeze, as parent banks in advanced Europe 
could cut back lending to their subsidiaries and 
branches.  
 The turnaround of the housing market cycle in 
a number of countries and the recent weakness of 

equity markets will also have macroeconomic 

consequences. Asset prices affect consumption 
through wealth effects. Property prices also have 
an impact on construction activity.
19 Furthermore, 
declining equity and house prices, as well as 

increasing borrowing rates, distress firms™ and 

households™ balance sheets and cash flows, thus 

reducing their creditworthiness and ability to 

borrow.
20Quantifying the Impact  
 The current financial turmoil is likely to have a 

significant impact on output in advanced 

European economies. Widening corporate spreads 
_______ 
17 This is the so-called lending channel, first identified by 
Bernanke and Blinder (1988). 18 Since 1999, securitization has contributed significantly to 
credit growth in the euro area (Altumbas, Gambacorta, and 
Marqués, 2007). 
19 Several studies have estimated the link between asset prices 
and the business cycle in ad
vanced economies. See, for 
example, IMF (2000), Catte and others (2004), and IMF 
(2008b). 20 The role of balance sheet effe
cts and collateral in credit 
cycles was first pointed out by Bernanke and Gertler (1989), who developed the so-called fina
ncial accelerator theory. See 
also Kiyotaki and Moore (1997); and Bernanke, Gertler, and 
Gilchrist (1999). are expected to reduce euro area output by 0.3 and 
0.4 percent in 2008 and in 2009, respectively, 

relative to a hypothetical scenario without 

financial shocks. The tightening of lending 

standardsŠassociated with a rise in the spread 
between lending and deposit ratesŠtogether with the decline in equity and house prices, will 

contribute to a further output slowdown of at 

least 0.4 and 0.5 percent in 2008 and 2009, 

respectively, compared with a scenario without 

financial shocks (Table 6).
21 In the United Kingdom, the GDP loss stemming from the rise 

in corporate spreads is estimated to be 0.3 percent 

in 2008 and 0.4 percent in 2009, relative to a no-
shock scenario. The assumed fall in house prices 
in the United Kingdom will, however, produce a 

larger output slowdown than in the euro area. In 

the other advanced European economies, financial 

shocks are expected to have a milder impact on 

GDP. In all advanced economies, further output 
losses would materialize if banks were to reduce 

credit supply significantly. Our estimates indicate 

that European banks™ current increased risk 
_______ 
21 These estimates are based on
 simulations performed with 
the National Institute Global Economic Model (NiGEM). 

NiGEM is a multicountry model th
at allows an assessment of 
the impact of shocks hitting in
dividual economies directly, as 
well as spillover effects from the slowdown in other 

countries. Specifically, th
e following scenarios were considered:  (1) a 100-basis-point (bp) incr
ease in the spread between corporate and government bond
s in all advanced economies 
(including non-European), lastin
g for two years, in line with 
the observed increase in spreads, and consis
tent with the assumption of a sustai
ned repricing of risk; (2) a 100 bp rise in the spre
ad between lending and deposit rates sustained for two years, in advanced economies 

(including non-European), re
flecting banks™ attempt to 
maximize profitability to rebuild their capital, as well as the 
tightening of lending standards; 

(3) a 15 percent decline in e
quity prices in advanced and 
emerging economies (including non-European), lasting for 
one year, in line with equity 
market developments since the 
beginning of 2008; and (4) a decline in nominal house 
prices in the United States, 
United Kingdom, Spain, and Ireland of 10Œ16 percent over 

two years, consistent with expected developments in the 
respective housing market. 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 32profile is likely to affect the supply of loans only 
moderately, and that the resulting impact on GDP growth will be limited (Box 6). Nevertheless, a 

sharper-than-expected credit squeeze cannot be 

ruled out. This could trigger a downward spiral, 
whereby lower credit expansion could result in a 
sharp economic slowdown, which, in turn, would 

curtail the demand for credit. 
 The financial turmoil is expected to have 
negative real effects also in emerging Europe. In 

the new member states,
22 declining equity prices, together with the total spillover effects from lower 
demand from advanced ec
onomies, are estimated 
to result in output losses of at least 0.8 and 0.5 

percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively, relative to 

a hypothetical scenario without financial shocks 

(Table 6). Given the brisk rate of growth 

experienced by these economies in the past years, 

such estimates point to a relatively mild 
slowdown. However, rising domestic and foreign 
borrowing premiums could take a further toll on 
growth in emerging Europe. Specifically, the 

concurrent rise in foreign and domestic risk 

premiums by 100 basis points (bps), sustained for 

two years, could reduce output by 0.8Œ1 percent in 

2008, and by 0.3Œ0.8 percent in 2009, compared 

with a scenario without shocks (Box 7).
23 The output slowdown in emerging Europe 

would be sharper if a significant credit squeeze 

were to materialize. Estimates of vector 

autoregressions (VARs) for selected emerging 
economies suggest a considerable impact. If credit 

growth were to fall temporarily by 10 percentage _______ 
22 This group comprises the fo
llowing countries: Bulgaria, Estonia, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Poland, Romania, and the Slovak Republic. 
23 These estimates are based on
 simulations of a general 
equilibrium model for a stylized emerging economy, where 

GDP growth is largely driven by consumption and 
investment, which are financed by foreign borrowing and 
very rapid credit growth (see Box 7 for details). We resort to 

this alternative model because NiGEM does not capture the 
important relationship between foreign and domestic risk 
premiums, credit growth, and the real sector, which is a key 
part of the transmission of th
e current financial shocks to 
emerging Europe. points, real GDP growth would decline 
significantly in the first year in Estonia and 

RomaniaŠtwo economies where credit growth 

has been among the strongest within emerging 

Europe since the mid-1990sŠbefore rebounding 

in the second year (Table 7).
24 In the Czech 
Republic, the negative effect on output would be 
smaller on impact but more prolonged, while in 
Hungary the growth reduction would be more 

contained.
_______ 
24 The VAR includes the following variables: credit growth, 
real GDP growth, inflation (all annualized), the lending rate, 
and, as an exogenous variable, the LIBOR. Credit growth is 
expressed in nominal terms following Bernanke and Lown 
(1991), who argue that this measure is the most appropriate in 
proxying the real value of credit extensions in the context of 
bank-borrower relationships, where the effective maturity of 

loans is very long. The model is estimated on quarterly data 
between the mid-1990s and the third quarter of 2007. The 
number of lags is determined through standard information 
criteria. Shock responses are computed using the generalized 
impulse response function.

FINANCIAL TURBULENCE: TESTING RESILIENCE AND DAMPENING GROWTH 33Box 6.  Banks™ Risk Profile, Credit Growth, and the Real Economy 
To what extent is the current financial turmoil, and the as
sociated increase in banks™ risk profile, likely to affect 
banks™ supply of credit? And what is the potential impact on output? To address these questions we estimate the 
relationships between banks™ risk conditions, loan growth, and real GDP growth on a sample of 42 major banks 
from seven advanced European economies (France, Germany,
 Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United 
Kingdom) over 1991Œ2007. The model specification consists of two simultaneous equations. In the first, loan growth in 42 banks is regressed 
over a measure of banks™ risk profile (lagged), real GDP growth, and a number of control variables (including the 
interbank rate, house and stock price indices, and a measure of banks™ size). The second equation explores the 
relationship between loan growth and output growth.
1 Banks™ risk profile is proxied by Merton-type credit risk 
indicators, including different versions of the distance-to-default (DD) and Moody™s KMV expected default 
frequency (EDF).2Our model estimates indicate that a rise in banks™ risk profile results in (statistically significant) lower credit 
growth. Specifically, on average, a 1 percent increase in a bank™s EDF can result in up to a 0.05 percentage point 
decrease in its annual loan growth, with some variations across countries.
3 Given the change in banks™ risk profile 
observed since August 2007 (Figure 18 in main text), our model predicts a reduction in annual credit growth of 
up to 4 percentage points. In our model, such a slowdown in credit expansion implies a decline in GDP growth 
of less than 0.1 percentage point.
 4 We obtained similar results when estimating the model on macroeconomic 
rather than individual bank data. 
Note: The main authors of this box are Andrea M. Maechler and Alexander Tieman. The analytical underpinnings 
of this box are presented in Maechler and Tieman (forthcoming). 
1  The model is estimated at quarterly frequency. 
2  Both risk indicators are based on a Merton-type option pricing structural model. The DD represents the 
number of standard deviations a market-based estimate of a bank™s equity is away from default. It has a negative 
relationship with financial risk (a lower DD means more risk). Moody™s KMV EDFs, which measure probabilities
of default, use a database of historic defaults to translate the model-implied risk-neutral probabilities to real-world 
(risk averse) expected default frequenc
ies. EDFs exhibit a positive relationship to financial risk (a higher EDF 
means more risk). 
3  Relative to French banks, the top German, Spanish, and Swedish banks contract their credit expansion more 
sharply in response to a deterioration in their risk profiles. 
4  For longer-term estimates of the potential impact of the financial turmoil on credit expansion and output in the 
United States, see IMF (2008a). 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 34Box 7.  Real Sector Implications of Financial Turbulence for an Emerging Market Economy 
To assess the potential macroeconomic consequences of the current financial turmoil on emerging Europe, we 
simulated a simple dynamic general equilibrium model for a stylized emerging market economy, characterized by 
(1) a high degree of openness; (2) a fixed/tightly managed 
exchange rate; (3) high levels of financial dollarization 
(with most loans and deposits linked to foreign currency); (4) rapid credit growth to the private sector, facilitated 
by banks™ foreign borrowing; and (5) corporate sect
or direct access to international financial markets.
1   
We consider the following two-year shock: a 100-basis-point increase in the foreign risk premium, which affects 
the rate at which agents borrow from abroad, together with a 100-basis-point rise in the domestic risk premium, 
reflecting banks™ smaller risk appetite. The shock results in an immediate rise in lending rates and a drop in bank 
foreign borrowing and corporate credits. Direct corporate 
foreign borrowing increases, however, as it is cheaper 
than bank borrowing, given the rise in the domestic risk premium. Bank household credits fall, but less than 
bank corporate credits, as households cannot resort to direct foreign borrowing (figure). 
Real output declines by 0.8Œ1 percent in 2008, and by 0.3Œ0.8 percent in 2009, compared with a scenario 
without shocks (figure). Consumption also falls, although less than production, as households reduce their stock 
of deposits in smoothing consumption. The output slowdown reduces inflation in 2008 and 2009. As 
consumption and the relative price of domestic to imported goods both decline, imports fall and the trade 
balance improves. When the premium shocks have subsided, bank foreign borrowing and bank corporate 
credits rebound, contributing to output and consumption recovery, which is associated with inflationary 
pressure and trade balance deterioration. 
Note:  The main authors of this box are 
nci Ötker-Robe and David Vávra. 
1  On the real side, the model has three sectors (nontradables, exports, and imports), and assumes nominal and 
real rigidities. In the fully dollarized financial sector, banksextend loans to finance consumption and production, 
and collect deposits from households. Interest rates move with the loan-deposit ratio. Firms have access to 
credit through an intermediary that bundles two imperfectly substitutable credit sources: bank loans and direct 
foreign borrowing. Imperfect substitution allows for a sm
ooth reallocation between the two sources when their 
relative prices change. For a detailed description of the model, see Benes, Ötker-Robe, and Vávra (2008) and 
Benes, Castello-Branco, and Vávra (2007).

373. Convergence in Emerging Europe: 
Sustainability and Vulnerabilities 
 Emerging Europe™s convergence trend is set to continue, 
based on good fundamentals, although its pace is likely to 

slow. Concerns about overheating are giving way to those 
about vulnerabilities. Imbalances in some countries could 
lead to a more volatile growth experience, with risks of a 

hard landing. For most emerging economies, macroeconomic 

and financial  policies will need to be further tightened to 

reduce vulnerabilities, while progress in structural reforms 

will be essential to sustain smooth convergence over the 

medium term. 
*Overview Convergence continues apace for most of the 

emerging economies in Eu
rope. After the volatile 
1990s, growth in emerging Europe accelerated 
sharply, reaching rates second only to the ones 

achieved in emerging Asia. Tighter integration 

with the more advanced economies of Europe has 

allowed emerging Europe to grow considerably 

faster than countries in other regions with similar 

income levels, allowing it to display real 

convergence (Figure 22). 
 Fast growth has been associated with large 
imbalances in several emerging economies, raising 

questions about sustainability and concerns about 
vulnerabilities. Although converging economies 

are expected to attract foreign savings to help 

finance investment and smooth consumption, 

most emerging European economies have current 

account deficits that are larger for their income 
levels than the rest of the world™s (Figure 23). 
Expectations of fast co
nvergence have generated large capital inflows in search of high returns in 

the region. Capital inflows have contributed to 

very high levels of external debt in some countries

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 38 Analysis of emerging Europe™s fundamental 
growth prospects and vulnerabilitiesŠthe subject 

of this chapterŠsuggests the following. The convergence trend of emerging Europe is based on 
strong fundamentals and is expected to continue. 
Potential growth, determined by existing 
fundamentals, is relatively high. Growth-
enhancing reforms have progressed in most countries, recent growth has been driven primarily by productivity improvements, and 
investment has increased throughout the 

region.Large current account deficits are to some 
extent expected during 
regional convergence. 
Moreover, high levels of foreign direct 
investment and the absence of strong exchange 

rate appreciations in the region are reassuring. 
Financial intermediation has considerable 
scope to deepen and broaden. However, the region™s growth is likely to ease. 
Growth rates in recent years have been well 
above estimates of potential growth for most 
countries. Reforms in some parts of the region 
have not progressed enough to sustain current 
growth rates. Recent growth has been driven primarily by 
the production of nontradables while the 
necessary, gradual shift of capital and labor toward the production of tradables is likely to 
involve adjustment costs.  
The pace of financial deepening and capital 
inflows is expected to slow, in part as a result 
of the repricing of risk in the context of the 
global financial turbulence. The convergence path may be volatile in countries with large 
external imbalances, with risks of a hard landing. 
Current account deficits are well above 
estimates justified by fundamentals and subject to risks of an abrupt adjustment in most cases. 
High levels of external debt are a source of 
vulnerability, and debt dynamics are 
particularly sensitive to exchange rate 
movements.Balance sheet analysis suggests that there are 
large exposures of the corporate and household sectors to exchange and interest 
rate risks, which imply vulnerabilities for the 
financial sector through credit risks and for the 
public sector. 
Macroeconomic policies could do more to address the 
region™s imbalances. 
Indicators suggest that, despite efforts to 
tighten, monetary conditions seem to have 
remained on the loose side in most of the 
region.Fiscal consolidation has not always taken full 
advantage of rapid growth, and in some 

countries fiscal balances have deteriorated in 
structural terms.  
Structural reforms have been essential to raise potential 
growth, suggesting that, together with sound macroeconomic 
policies, further progress in this area will be key to ensure a 
smooth convergence in emerging Europe.  The extent to which these conclusions apply 
varies by region within emerging Europe. The 
Baltics have accumulated considerably larger 
external imbalances than the rest of the region. 
Although faster progress in structural reforms has 
increased their flexibility, adjustment to shocks 
may still be difficult, as their fixed exchange rate 
regimes preclude nominal exchange rate 
adjustment to cushion the impact of shocks. 
External imbalances in southeastern Europe, 
albeit smaller, are also sizable and have been 
deteriorating. Moreover, these economies lag 

behind in structural reforms and may lack the 
capacity to adjust swiftly to shocks. In contrast, 
most of the central-eastern European economies 
have smaller external imbalances and are relatively 
advanced in reforms, thus mitigating 

vulnerabilities.CONVERGENCE IN EMERGING EUROPE: SUSTAINABILITY AND VULNERABILITIES 
39Sustaining Growth Growth Led by Domestic Demand 
 On the supply side, recent growth in emerging 
Europe has been driven primarily by services, 
followed by industrial production (Figure 24). The 

relative expansion of nontradable production 

(primarily services) is to be expected during the 
beginning of the convergence process, and is 
associated with an increase in the relative price of 

nontradables and wages.
25 However, successful convergence eventually requires a turnaround of 

this process and a shift of resources toward the 

production of tradables.  
 On the demand side, recent growth in 
emerging Europe has been driven by domestic 

demand, with a sharp jump in the investment-to-

GDP ratios in many countries and rapid growth of 

consumption (Figure 25). Even though exports 

have been growing at a respectable pace, the 

contribution of net exports to growth has been 

negative in most countries. The large contribution 

to growth from consumption is mainly explained 
by its dominant share in GDP. Indeed, investment has been growing faster than consumption during

Contributor Production function estimates provide further 
insights into the factors that are driving growth in emerging Europe. Growth accounting links 

growth to the accumulation 
of capital, changes in the use of labor, and a residual factor, commonly 

known as total factor productivity (TFP). Growth 
that is primarily driven by factor accumulation 
without improving productivity may not prove to 

be sustainable because of diminishing returns to

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 40transformation, which bodes well for future 
growth prospects (Figure 26).
26 Growth in emerging Europe has been driven primarily by 

TFP, and countries with higher TFP growth have 

been growing faster. Capital accumulation has also 
been important in most countries; meanwhile, 
labor has added less and even registered a negative 

contribution in some countries, with emigration a 

key factor. 27
Structural Reforms Are Essential Drivers of Economic Growth  
 Reforms that have been found to foster 
economic growth and productivity explain fast 

growth in the Baltics and in central-eastern 

Europe, while lower starting income positions and 

convergence arguments explain fast growth in 
southeastern Europe and in the Commonwealth 
_______ 
26 We assume a Cobb-Douglas technology with two factors, 
capital and labor, and with constant returns to scale: 
Y(t) = A(t) F[K(t), 
L(t)]. 
Y is real GDP; 
A is an index of the level of 
technology, or TFP; 
K is capital; and L is employment. 
Contributions to growth are 
then computed according to y(t)= a(t) + 
 k(t) + (
1Œ)l(t), where 
 is the share of rental 
payments to capital in total income and (1Œ
) is the share of 
wage payments to labor in total income, assuming 
competitive product markets, and lowercase letters indicate 

growth rates. 
a(t) is estimated as a residual, and although 
assumed to measure productivi
ty improvements, it also 
captures production forces in addition to capital and labor, as 

well as possible measurement e
rrors. For more details, see 
Barro and Sala-í-Martin (2004). 27 This is consistent with Schadler and others (2006), who 
find that TFP growth in central-eastern Europe has been 
higher than in other emerging economies, including east Asia 
and Latin America. Some caution in interpreting these results 

is in order as it is difficult to estimate capital stocks for 
transition economies. Investment data are not reliably 
available before the 1990s so an ad hoc assumption needs to 
be made about the starting value of the capital stock. We 
assumed that the initial ratio of capital to GDP in the 
European transition economies is somewhere between the 
average level in the low- and 
middle-income economies in the 
world in 1995. This leads to a range of TFP estimates for each country that may be more 
plausible than estimates based on short investment time series
. The data in Figure 26 show 
the middle of these ranges fo
r TFP growth and the growth 
contribution of capital. The in
come shares were taken from 
previous IMF country studies, or assumed to be equal to the 
average in the region when country data were not available. 
of Independent States (CIS) countries (Table 8).

The Baltics have progressed considerably faster in 
structural reforms, reducing the role of the state in 

the economy and creating a business-friendly 
environment that has led to larger investment 
shares. In some of these areas, the Baltics already 

compare well with the euro area.
29 Central-eastern 
Europe follows, with notable progress in most 

growth determinants. Both regions are also very 

open to international trade, are well advanced in 

the transition process, and have relatively good 

public infrastructure, a well-educated population, 

and labor markets that are more flexible than in 
the euro area. Southeastern Europe has fallen 
behind in structural reforms, while the CIS 

countries are lagging even more (these differences

28 Table 8 includes factors that the literature has found to 
determine potential economic 
growth and productivity. 
Although the statistical and re
lative economic significance of many of these determinants is 
still subject to discussion, these 
factors can indicate the growth prospects of a country or 
region and provide guidance to 
policy. For more details, see Barro and Sala-í-Martin (2004); George, Oxley, and Carlaw 
(2004); Helpman (2004); and Aghion and Durlauf (2005).

the region to which emerging 
Europe is converging, the convergence pace of the latter is 
conditional on its reform progress compared with that of the 
euro area. Figure 26. Emerging Europe: Growth

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 42may be partly due to the EU harmonization, 
which drove reforms in the new EU member 

states in recent years). The lack of reform 

progress may explain why some countries in 

these areas have not been growing faster than 
the rest of emerging Europe, despite starting from a lower income position.
30 Other growth determinants in the region are 

conducive to convergence, or at least are not an 

obstacle. The financial sector has been 

developing at a fast pace across emerging 
Europe, although this process is far from complete. And the demogr
aphic characteristics 
in the region and human capital indicators are 

similar to the ones in the rest of Europe. 
Financial Deepening May Lose 
Steam IMF staff research suggests that, despite 
recent progress, the financial sectors in 

emerging European economies still have a long 

way to go to converge with the more advanced 

financial sectors in the rest of Europe.
31 The 
stock of domestic bank private sector credit as a 
share of GDP is still small in most economies in 

the region relative to income levels. Estimates in 

Schadler and others (2005), in IMF Country 

Report 06/169 (for Romania and other new EU 

member states), and data for 2006 suggest that 

the credit ratios in the new EU member 

countries are considerably below their long-run 

equilibrium, with the exceptions of Latvia and 
Estonia, which are slightly above equilibrium. 
Moreover, debt and equity markets have 

considerable room to develop. Therefore, 

financial deepening in emerging Europe is part

of an equilibrium convergence process that is 
likely to continue in the medium term.  
 However, the recent speed of financial 
deepening in the region may have been extreme. 

The pace of credit expansion relative to 

economic growth in emerging Europe has 

exceeded that in other emerging economies 

(Figure 27). Also, including loans taken by the 

nonfinancial sector directly from abroad, the 

credit-to-GDP ratio is considerably higher (see, 
for example, evidence for southeastern Europe 
in Sorsa and others, 2007). Therefore, although 

the trend of financial deepening is likely to 

continue in emerging Europe, its pace may slow 

in the near term, even in the absence of 

shocks.32 This, in turn, is expected to contribute 
to a slowing of output growth.

CONVERGENCE IN EMERGING EUROPE: SUSTAINABILITY AND VULNERABILITIES 
43Growth Is Likely to Slow in Line with 
Potential Although good fundamentals justify high 
potential growth rates in emerging Europe, actual 

growth rates seem to have been even higher, 

suggestive of overheating pressures.
33 Estimates 
based on a growth model show that potential 

growth is high throughout the region (Box 8). 

However, comparisons of the growth model 

estimates with actual growth rates reveal that all 
emerging European economies have been growing 
at above-potential rates in the past five years, 

except Hungary, which has remained below 

potential. The difference is the largest for Latvia, 

Russia, and Ukraine. On average, the region is 

estimated to have grown faster than potential by 2 percent during 2003Œ07 (1.8 percent excluding 

Russia). Therefore, although convergence is 

expected to continue, its pace may slow. 
Moreover, the road back to potential may be 
bumpy in economies where excess demand 

pressures have led to vulnerabilities.   
 The estimates also suggest that further 
structural reforms could substantially increase 

potential growth rates in emerging Europe, in 
some cases to even above current growth rates. 
Continuing with reforms at the same pace as in 

recent years is estimated to increase potential 

growth by an average of 1.6 percent annually. 
Addressing Vulnerabilities Some Trends Are Reassuring . . .  As noted, most emerging European economies 

have current account deficits that are considerably 

larger than in similar economies in the rest of the 

world. Although this makes the region vulnerable 

to external shocks (see below), other trends are 
more reassuring.  
_______ 
33 Firm conclusions on the degr
ee of overheating are difficult 
to draw as the level of potential output is hard to pin down. 
Most of the recent deterioration of current 
account balances in emerging Europe seems to 

be driven by an increase in investment 
(Figure 28). And in almost half of the 
countries, savings actually rose. In most 
countries with large deficits, such as the Baltics 
and Bulgaria, investment increased the most, 
although in many cases savings also declined. 
High investment is expected to improve the 

region™s growth prospects and eventually help 
reduce the current account deficits. 
Foreign direct investment (FDI) has financed 
most of the current account deficits in 
emerging Europe in recent years (Figure 29). 

FDI is less volatile than other capital flows as 
it cannot leave the country on short notice. 
One of its key features is that it fully shares in 
the economic risks and often signals approval 
of a country™s economic policies and positive 

expectations about its prospects. Therefore, 
FDI-financed current account deficits are 
generally more sustainable and tend to adjust 
more gradually than deficits financed by debt

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 44Box 8.  Potential Growth Estimates in Emerging Europe Based on a Growth Model 
For transition economies, there are several obstacles to estimating potential growth, including short time series, 
the unavailability of some key variables, measurement issues, and frequent changes in statistical methods. 
Furthermore, using historical data to estimate potential
 growth and recent trends to gauge future prospects may 
lead to false conclusions during structural transforma
tion. However, estimates of potential output growth are 
still useful in determining to what extent actual growth is driven by temporary factors.  
With these caveats in mind, we estimate an economet
ric growth model based on a large cross-country sample 
of 107 developed and developing economies, during 1996Œ2006. The estimated coefficients are used to forecast 
potential growth in emerging Europe based on the curren
t values of the independent variables in each country.
1Focusing on the past 10 years has a number of advantages: the sample includes transition economies; some 
cross-country indices are not available for earlier years; and overall data quality has improved since previous 
years.   
The empirical specification is the following: 
 (Real GDP per capita growth)
i  =c + 
Xi + u,   for country 
i = 1,–, 
n.   
The dependent variable is the average per capita purchasing power parity (PPP) real GDP growth rate for each 
country i;c is the constant term; 
 is the matrix of parameters to be estimated; 
Xi is the matrix of independent 
variables; and 
u is the error term (see Table 8 in the main text for data sources). Each country has one 
observation, which is either the average over 10 years or the initial value in 1996, depending on the variable.  
The preferred, estimated specification is 
Real GDP per capita growth = 11.00(2.93)** Œ1.38( 4.52)*** initial real GDP per capita Œ7.05(-3.86)*** 
age dependency rate +0.13(3.93)*** investment/GDP +0.02(1.80)*  university enrollment ratio Œ0.015(-
2.34)** inflation rate +0.07(1.50) foreign direct investment/GDP +0.59(3.00)** index of economic 
freedom in 1995 +0.86(3.97)*** change in the index of economic freedom during 1995Œ2005 +0.90(1.73)* 
dummy variable for transition +0.67(
1.69)* dummy variable for Africa.  
***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent level, respectively; the number of 
observations is 107; the adjusted 
R2 is 0.59; heteroscedasticity-consistent 
t-statistics are in parentheses. 
The results suggest that, keeping everything else constant, a country with a relatively low income level, a low 
dependency ratio, a large investment share, a low inflation rate, and a relatively educated population grows 
faster. The index of economic freedom, which measures a number of different aspects of macroeconomic and 
structural policies and reforms, has a posit
ive and statistically significant estimate.
2 The FDI-to-GDP ratio has a 
positive coefficient but is statistically significant at only the 15 percent level. Separate constants for transition 
economies and for African countries have positive estimates. 
The estimate of the dummy variable for transition economies suggests that these economies have been growing 
faster during the past 10 years than would be justified by the growth determinants in this specificationŠby 
about 0.9 percent annually in terms of per capita GDP, with most of these economies having collapsed at the 
beginning of their transition. However, this ﬁgrowth bonusﬂ may not continue in the future, or at least not to 
the same extent.   
1  A similar methodology was used in Schadler and others (2005) for central-eastern Europe, in Moore and 
Vamvakidis (forthcoming) for Croatia, and in IMF Country Report 06/345 for Macedonia, FYR. 
2  For more information on the index of economic freedom, see www.freetheworld.com. 
CONVERGENCE IN EMERGING EUROPE: SUSTAINABILITY AND VULNERABILITIES 
45Using these estimates and the 
latest values of the independent 
variables for each emerging 
European economy gives a range 
of potential growth estimates and 
the growth impact of economic 
reforms (see table; some countries 
are dropped from the sample 
because of missing values for 
some of the growth determinants). 
The lower end of the range 
assumes that the transition growth 
bonus will not continue in the 
medium term, while the upper end 
assumes that it will. The range 
with no reforms assumes no 
further progress in structural 
reforms (the index of economic 
freedom remains at its 2005 level), which may be an extreme assumption, while the range with reforms assumes 
that structural reforms continue at the same pace, 
which may also be an extreme assumption because past 
reforms started from a very low level. In the main text, the average of all these estimates is used as the potential 
growth rate for each economy.  
 or portfolio flows (although a sudden stop of 
FDI inflows cannot be excluded). However, an 
important caveat is that some of the recent 
FDI into emerging Europe was linked to 
privatization and, therefore, may not be 
repeated. Furthermore, foreign bank 
borrowing from parent banks has been 
financing an increasing share of the current 
account deficits in most countries, primarily in 

the Baltics and in southeastern Europe.  
Exchange rate appreciation does not seem to 
explain the accumulation of external 
imbalances in emerging Europe (Figure 30). 
There is no significant correlation between the 

changes in current account balances in 
emerging Europe and the changes in real 
effective exchange rates in recent years (the 
latter are also not correlated with the levels of 
the current account deficits). 
Emerging Europe has been gaining market 
share. As a share of world imports, exports of 
goods and services (excluding oil) have risen in 
all countries in the region since 2002Šin some 
considerably so (Figure 31). Therefore, 
competitiveness problems do not seem to    Sources:  IMF,

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 46explain the large current account deficits in the 
region.. . . But Current Account Deficits Are Well Above Estimates Based on Fundamentals Estimates of expected current account deficits 
based on fundamentals suggest that some 

countries in emerging Europe have excessive 

external imbalances. Although such estimates are 
subject to uncertainty and very sensitive to 
empirical specification, their gaps from actual 

deficits in most countries in the region are 
substantial and suggest the need for an adjustment 

in the medium term, signs of which are beginning 

to appear.34 Multiple methodologies are used to estimate 

equilibrium current account deficits; the so-called 

CGER approach is the standard at the IMF.
35Recent IMF staff reports for emerging European 

countries have published such estimates.
36 In this section, we discuss new results from three 

alternative methodologies. 
 First, results from the simulation of an 
empirical model on the determinants of current 

account balances in Europe in Abiad, Leigh, and 

Mody (2007) give mixed results for selected new 

EU members. This model takes financial 

integration explicitly into account and, therefore, 
_______ 
34 The results are based on a common methodology for all 
emerging European countries. 
Although this is useful for 
cross-country comparisons, it leaves out some country-specific aspects. However, IMF 
country reports, some of 
which are referenced in this ch
apter, address country-specific 
issues in more detail. 35 CGER stands for the Consultative Group on Exchange 
Rate Issues, which was established in the IMF in 1995 to 
strengthen its capacity to assess current account positions and 
exchange rate levels. The CGER
 assessments are based on 
three complementary approa
ches: the macroeconomic 
balance approach, the reduced-form equilibrium real 
exchange rate approach, and the external sustainability 
approach. For more details, see Isard and Faruqee (1998); 

Isard and others (2001); and IMF (2006). 
36 For example, IMF Country Report 07/255 for Estonia. 
is particularly relevant for emerging Europe.
37 The results suggest that current account deficits in the 

past five years have been considerably larger than 
_______ 
37 The CGER approach may un
derestimate the equilibrium 
current account deficit in a setting of EU convergence and 
rapid financial integration. Abiad, Leigh, and Mody (2007) 
take this into account in their empirical model and find 
financial integration to be 
the main determinant of the 
current account balances in Europe.    Sources:  IMF, 
World Economic Outlook;

47would be justified by fundamentals in Latvia and 
Estonia, somewhat larger in Lithuania, Hungary, 

and the Slovak Republic, and smaller in the Czech 

Republic and Poland (Figure 32).
38 Second, estimates of current account balances 

for new EU member states based on the 
macroeconomic balance approach show that 

fundamentals justify larger deficits in the region 

than in other emerging market economies, but not 

to the extent seen in some countries (Box 9). The 

Baltics and, more recently, Bulgaria and Romania 
have diverged from the model predictions. This 
divergence seems to be mainly driven by cyclical 

and structural factors, but also by economic 

policies. Although deviations from model 

predictions are not conclusive evidence of 

disequilibrium, particularly given the sensitivity of 

such estimates to the empirical specification, an 

adjustment would require the shift of resources to 

the tradable sectors and a slowing of domestic 
demand. Third, estimation of a model of intertemporal 
optimization during regional convergence in 

emerging Europe leads to similar conclusions. In 

this model, based on Blanchard and Giavazzi 

(2002), emerging economies converge toward the 
more advanced economies in the region by 
borrowing in international capital markets.
39 The _______ 
38 The differences between predicted and actual current 
account deficits are largely explained by cyclical factors. For a 

detailed discussion of these si
mulations for Lithuania, see 
Ohnsorge (forthcoming). 
39 The regression equation is 
cait = t + t(yit Œ yt)+ 
Xit + it,where cait is the current accoun
t balance of country i at time 
t,t is a common time effect, y
it  is the log per capita GDP of 
country i at time 
t, yt is the log of the average per capita GDP 
in the euro area, and 
Xit is a set of other control variables for 
country i at time 
t, including the age dependency ratio and 
real GDP growth. We would expect that the larger the 

income gap of an emerging
 European economy from the 
advanced European economi
es, the higher the age dependency ratio, and the strong
er the current growth cycle, the larger its current account deficit. The coefficient of 
relative income varies over ti
me. As argued in Blanchard and 
Giavazzi (2002), financial integration in Europe has increased 

substantially in recent years, allowing emerging economies to 
borrow more, invest more, and save less during convergence, 
current account balances of emerging economies 
depend on a time effect, relative per capita 

income, demographic factors, and the business 

cycle. Foreign borrowing finances relatively high 

consumption and investment in the present, based 

on expectations that living standards will improve 
in the future. Therefore, fast growth in emerging 
economies is associated with large current account 

deficits, which would describe what one has seen 

in emerging Europe in recent years. The model 

can be used to forecast the levels of the current 

account balances that are consistent with regional 

convergence in emerging Europe.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 48Box 9.  Current Account Sustainability in the EU-10
1The fact that most new members of the European 
Union have been running current account deficits 
that are, on average, larger than those experienced by 
other emerging market economies appears to be 
justified by fundamentals (figure). Using the so-called 
macroeconomic balance approach, an equilibrium 
relationship between the current account balance and 
a set of fundamentals that determines a country™s 
saving and investment positions was estimated on a 
sample of 59 industrial and developing countries. The 
resulting larger predicted current account deficits in 
the EU-10 are driven by two factors: a larger share of 
dependent population and a much lower net foreign 
assets position (first table).  
The demographic profile of the EU-10 is closer to 
the one in industrial Europe than that in other 
emerging market countries outside Europe. Having a 
larger share of old-age dependent 
population lowers national saving, 
implying a larger current account 
deficit. In addition, foreign 
investors™ greater confidence in 
the growth prospects of the EU-
10 and the higher dependence of 
the latter on foreign capital for 
growth are reflected in a lower net 
foreign assets position. Unlike 
emerging Asia, where growth has 
mostly been self-financed, 
emerging Europe™s convergence is 
financed from abroad. Robustness 
checks also point to the 
desirability of excluding non-
European emerging market 
countries from the sample. Doing 
so produces slightly larger current account model predictions for the EU-10. 
To what extent have actual current account balances in the EU-10 diverged from the model predictions? There 
is a wide cross-country variation, with Slovenia and Poland, on one end, showing mostly positive deviations, 
and the Baltic countries and the Slovak Republic, on the other end, showing persistently negative deviations. 
Within this latter group, the Slovak Republic has redu
ced its divergence over time, whereas the Baltics have 
been moving in the opposite direction, joined recently by Bulgaria and Romania.

CONVERGENCE IN EMERGING EUROPE: SUSTAINABILITY AND VULNERABILITIES 
49The divergence of actual current account balances from their ﬁannualﬂ model predictions, which are 
calculated using coefficients from the current account balance regression and annual values of the 
fundamental variables, can be explained by three kinds 
of factors: cyclical or temporary (the output gap and 
capital inflows brought in by EU accession), structural (export composition and cost competitiveness in the 
manufacturing sector), and policy-related (the exchange
 rate regime and financia
l sector policies) factors.
2Because structural and policy variables are also statistica
lly significant, in addition to cyclical and temporary 
variables, in explaining the variation in divergence in the EU-10, the results suggest that the elimination of 
large deficits is likely to require an improvement in export performance (second table). 
In fact, the experience of countries where large deficits were absent (Poland and Slovenia) or have been 
brought down over time (the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Hungary) demonstrates the 
importance of exports. While imports increased rapidly in all of the EU-10, exports took off in a 
determined fashion only in this subgroup. This takeoff, in turn, was facilitated not just by strong growth 
and increasing market shares, but also by a composition that became increasingly diversified in favor of 
products with higher technological content and productivity growth that favored the tradable sector.   
The question is whether the rest of the EU-10 countries, all of which are running double-digit current 
account deficits, can follow the same 
script. Concerns about external 
stability have mounted in these 
countries, given their sizable external 
debt, blistering pace of credit growth, 
rising domestic wage pressures, and 
limited policy flexibility. High and 
increasingly negative net foreign asset 
positions imply that the deterioration 
in the income balance in coming years 
is likely to offset the expected 
improvement in the transfer balance. 
Hence, a turnaround in the trade and 
services balance will be essential to 
obtain the needed adjustment and will 
require a very strong export 
performance in addition to a slowdown in domestic demand. 
2  For this analysis, the regression coefficients are obtained from the estimation results using industrial and 
European emerging market countries only. 
 The results show that large current account 
deficits in emerging Europe are only partly driven 

by regional convergence. Most of these deficits are 
at levels within equilibrium ranges (determined by 
a 95 percent confidence band) during regional 

convergence (Table 9). However, these ranges are 

wide, and the deficits of most emerging European 

economies are well above the central estimates 

within these ranges. Moreover, three economies 
have deficits above the estimated ranges: Latvia, 
Bulgaria, and Estonia.
40_______ 
40 According to the latest IMF World Economic Outlook
projections, Estonia is expected 
to be within this band by 
2008, Latvia by 2009, and Bulgaria by 2010 (IMF, 2008b).

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 50High External Debt Causes Concerns  A number of emerging European economies 
have levels of external debt that, as a share of 

GDP, are considerably higher than in most other 

emerging economies. High levels of external 

indebtedness, as well as of domestic debt in 

foreign exchange, could expose parts of the region 

to shocks, including rollover difficulties, sharp 

interest rate and exchange rate movements, 
changes in investors™ sentiments, and changes in 
the expansion plans of foreign banks, which own 

the lion™s share of banking assets in most 

countries. Repayment would require that indebted 

economies either export their way out or reduce 

their domestic demand. The first path is obviously 

preferable, but achieving it will depend on 

progress with reforms.41 While most debt is of medium- and long-term 

maturities, reserve coverage of short-term debt is 

low in a number of countries. A ratio of short-

term debt to central bank foreign reserves higher 

than 100 is not usually considered to provide a 
sufficient buffer during shocks. About half of 

emerging European economies are well below this

limit, about one-fourth are very close to or 
somewhat above it, and th
e rest (the Baltics and 
Belarus) are well above it (Figure 33).
42 Based on a methodology described in Milesi-

Ferretti and Razin (1997), a standard debt-
accounting framework can be used to determine 
the dynamics of external debt in response to a 

number of adverse shocks (Table 10).
43 Three shocks are considered: a 20 percent depreciation 
_______ 
42 Net external debt, which adjusts for private sector foreign 
assets, is considerably lower in most countries. In Latvia, for 

example, where external debt is the highest in emerging Europe, net debt was estimate
d at about 52 percent of GDP 
in 2007Šthe ratio of net short-ter
m debt to foreign reserves was estimated at 98 percent. Alt
hough a large share of foreign 
assets could provide some bu
ffer during external shocks, possible mismatches between 
asset owners and debtors 
suggest that there is no immunity. 43 The path of external debt as a share of GDP is determined 
by the following process:
dt+1Œdt = (1/(1+gt+t+gtt)*[rtŒgtŒt(1+gt)]dt-tbt+1,whered is the ratio of ext
ernal debt to GDP, 
r is the effective nominal interest rate on external debt, 
g is the rate of 
real GDP growth, 
tb is the noninterest current account balance in percent of GDP, and 
 is the change in the 
domestic GDP deflator in euros: (1+
t) = (1+t) (1+t),where t is domestic GDP deflator inflation and 
t is the rate of nominal appreciation. Th
is methodology assumes no 
further accumulation of foreign 
reserves. For an application 
of this framework to Lithuania, see IMF Country Report 
05/122.

51of the exchange rate (only for countries with 
floating exchange rates), an increase in lending 

interest rates of 2 percentage points, and a fall of 

real GDP growth by 2 percent from the baseline 

of the IMF™s World Economic Outlook. All three shocks are projected to lead to higher 
debt levels in the medium term than in the 
baseline projections. The exchange rate shock has a considerably stronger impact on debt than the 

other two shocks, which have almost the same 

impact. The exchange rate shock has the most 

severe impact on Hungary and Croatia. The 

growth and interest rate shocks have the most 

severe impact on Latvia, Bulgaria, Hungary, 

Croatia, and Estonia.  
Balance Sheet Analysis Indicates 
Vulnerabilities Recent IMF staff work has emphasized balance 
sheet vulnerabilities in a number of emerging 
European economies. The balance sheet approach 
analyzes the economy as a system of interlinked 

sectoral balance sheets (public, private financial, 

corporates, and households), focusing on stocks, 

in contrast to traditional macroeconomic analysis, 

which is typically concerned with aggregate flow 

variables. The balance sheet approach clarifies 

intersectoral linkages and provides useful insights 
into balance sheet maturity, currency, and capital 
structure mismatches, which may exacerbate a 

country™s vulnerability to shocks.

050100150200250300350REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 52 This approach is particularly relevant for 
emerging European countries with high levels of 

foreign currency debt. A balance sheet analysis 

may show sectoral exposures that are netted out in 

a country™s aggregate balance sheet. Problems in 
servicing foreign currency debt in one sector may 
quickly spread to other sectors, with broader 

economic implications.  
 Although this research is at an early stage and 
requires building extensive sectoral data sets, 

which are not always available even for advanced 
economies, some early conclusions can be drawn 
based on the recent IMF studies for selected 

emerging European economies.
44Banks have a net liability position with the 
nonresident sector and a net asset position 
with the domestic nonfinancial private sector. 
These positions reflect intermediation of funds 
from the former sectorŠprimarily parent 
foreign banksŠto the latter, in the form of 

bank loans, and could make these banks 
vulnerable to sudden stops. 
Although domestic lending in foreign 
currencies provides banks with hedging from 
exchange rate risks, the banks remain indirectly 

exposed to such risks through credit risks, as 
most of their debtors (domestic private 
nonfinancial sector) are not hedged.
45The banking sector is exposed to interest rate 
risk. Floating interest rates in most mortgages 

provide a cushion, but even in these cases 
banks remain indirectly exposed to interest rate 
risks through credit risks. 
With a large share of mortgages in their loan 
portfolios, banks could also be vulnerable to 

developments in the real estate market. 
The balance sheets of the domestic private 
nonfinancial sector (corporates and

Estonia, 05/277, 06/354 for Latvia, and 06/379 for Hungary.

percent of loans in foreign currencies are made to unhedged borrowers in Croatia. 
households) are subject to exchange rate risks 
from large and rising foreign currency 
exposures and to domestic and foreign interest 
rate risks from debt in variable interest rates. Although households also have large foreign 
currency deposits, borrowers may be distinct 

from savers and thus subject to these risks. 
Public sector balance sheets are generally 
strong (with the exception of Hungary). 
Moreover, some governments have been 
refinancing external debt in the domestic 

market. However, the large foreign currency 
exposures of the nonfinancial private sector 
imply fiscal risks in case of a severe downturn. 
In sum, a balance sheet analysis for selected 
emerging European economies suggests that large 
exposures to exchange rate and interest rate risks 
on the part of the corporate and household 
sectors imply some vulnerabilities for the financial 
sector through credit risks, and indirectly for the 

public sector in case of a severe shock.  
Running Sound Macroeconomic Policies In many cases, macroeconomic policies in 
emerging Europe have not been tightened 

sufficiently in response to overheating pressures. 

In some countries, instead of ﬁleaning against the 

wind,ﬂ policies may have added fuel to the fire. 

Fiscal policy, in particular, has not always stepped 

in to manage domestic demand in the absence of 

monetary policy in fixed exchange regimes.  
Monetary Conditions Seem Loose  
 Fast credit growth and overheating pressures in 

a number of emerging European countries are 
driven partly by low borrowing costs. Real lending 

interest rates fell during recent years in most 

countries in the region. Moreover, corporates, and 

increasingly households, in emerging Europe are 

able to borrow directly from abroad and take 
advantage of even lower interest rates, albeit at the 
expense of incurring exchange rate risk.CONVERGENCE IN EMERGING EUROPE: SUSTAINABILITY AND VULNERABILITIES 
53 Monetary policy has not always managed to 
tighten monetary conditions as needed. Open 

capital accounts, high euroization (in some cases), 

financial deepening and integration, and fear of 

floating of exchange rates (in some cases) have 

weakened the effectiveness of monetary policy. 

Tightening measures in some countries, such as 

higher reserve requirements and credit controls, 

have not been effective in slowing foreign 
borrowing and credit growth as desired, and have 
been often circumvented by lenders and 

borrowers.
46 Indeed, monetary conditions seem to be loose throughout emerging Europe. 
 According to the Taylor rule, monetary 
conditions have loosened in emerging Europe 
during recent years (Figure 34), particularly in the 
Baltics after 2003.
47 Loosening in central and southeastern Europe followed, but at a much 

slower pace. Monetary conditions in the rest of 
_______ 
46 For more details, see Hilbers and others (2005). 
47 The Taylor rule is defined as 
the sum of the output gap, the 
equilibrium interest rate (assumed to be equal to potential 
growth estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter), expected 

inflation (assumed to be equal to actual inflation in the past 
three years), and the inflation 
gap (assumed to be equal to 
actual inflation minus 
an inflation target, which is taken to be 
the 2 percent ECB target plus 1.5 percent from Balassa-
Samuelson effects). 
the region started from a very loose position in 
2003, were tightened up until 2006, but started 
loosening again in 2007.
48 The monetary conditions index shows a similar 

trend (Figure 35).
49 The index suggests a loosening of monetary conditions throughout the region in 

recent years. However, in contrast with what is 

suggested by the Taylor rule, monetary conditions 

seem to have been relaxed the most in 

southeastern Europe and the least in the Baltics.
_______ 
48 The result that monetary conditions are loose does not 
suggest that monetary policy is
 loose (this conclusion would be particularly wrong for emer
ging European economies with 
fixed exchange rates, where there is no independent monetary policy). It suggests, rather, that
 tightening policies in emerging 
Europe have not been effect
ive in tightening monetary 
conditions (which can be loos
e even in a country with a 
currency board arrangement). This interpretation of the result 
is derived from the fact that the Taylor rule calculations in 
this chapter include the lending interest rate, instead of the policy interest rate. The latter is relevant for determining whether monetary policy is loose,
 while the former is relevant 
for determining whether moneta
ry (lending) conditions are 
loose. 
49 The monetary conditions index is equal to 100 in 2003 and 
is the weighted sum of the changes in the real lending interest 
rates and in the real effectiv
e exchange rates, with weights 
equal to 0.75 and 0.25, respectively.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 54Fiscal Consolidation Is Insufficiently 
Ambitious Most emerging European economies have 
taken advantage of the strong cycle to improve 

their fiscal balances. Strong, growth-driven 

revenue performance in recent years has fostered 

fiscal consolidation just by allowing the automatic 

stabilizers to operate. Overheating and 

vulnerability concerns in some economies 

prompted calls for even tighter policies to offset 
strong private sector demand and create room to 
support the economy in case of a severe 

downturn. However, adjusting for the cycle, progress in 
fiscal consolidation in the region has been mixed 

(Figure 36).50 During the past five years, fiscal 
balances improved by less in structural terms than 
actual balances in all countries in the region except 

Albania. In nine economies, fiscal balances 

deteriorated in structural terms, despite the 

improvement of actual balances in five of them. 

Structural balances improved by an annual average 

of more than ½ percentage point of GDP only in 

Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkey, and 

Poland in this sequence. In structural terms, only 
Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, 
FYR, Estonia, and Bulgaria had fiscal surpluses in 

2007. This outcome ran counter to a well-accepted 

rule (consistent with a long-run objective of the 

EU™s Stability and Growth Pact) for a balanced 

budget over the cycle.
51_______ 
50 Potential output and the output gap are measured using the 
Hodrick-Prescott filter or IMF staff estimates based on 

alternative methodologies for each country. Potential growth estimates based on the growth model in the earlier section 
cannot be used because they cannot determine the level of 

potential output. The potential 
output estimates based on the 
Hodrick-Prescott filter may be overestimated, as growth has 
been well above potential based on the growth model 

estimates in the period considered. 
51 Although infrastructure needs would justify structural 
deficits in parts of emerging 
Europe, projections for rising 
health and pension spending du
e to aging populations would 
call for structural surpluses. Policy Agenda 
 The analysis in this chapter suggests that, 
although emerging economies in Europe are set to 

continue converging toward their more advanced 

European peers, the recent pace of convergence 

may not be sustainable and, in some cases, may 
have increased vulnerabilities to shocks and risks 
of a hard landing. Addressing these vulnerabilities 

is crucial to ensure smooth convergence in the 

medium term and, in some countries, a soft 

landing. The IMF™s recent policy recommendations for 
the region, which are also supported by the 
empirical results in this chapter, can be 

summarized as follows:Enact structural reforms to increase potential 
growth by ensuring fair market competition, 
reducing the role of the state in the economy, 
improving the business environment, cutting 
red tape, reforming the judiciary, and progressing in the EU harmonization process 

in EU-candidate countries.

CONVERGENCE IN EMERGING EUROPE: SUSTAINABILITY AND VULNERABILITIES 
55Implement policies to ensure macroeconomic 
stability, address external imbalances, and 

reduce vulnerabilities, including tightening 
monetary policies where available, and 
advancing in fiscal consolidation well beyond 
what is driven by the operation of automatic stabilizers during the expansion stage, 
particularly in countries with limitations in 
conducting monetary policy. Wage increases 

should be in line with productivity 
improvements. Fiscal distortions that might 
create incentives for excessive private sector 
borrowing should also be reconsidered and in 
some cases eliminated.52Implement policies to strengthen the financial 
sector and create buffers to help adjust to 
shocks, including prudential measures, such as 
larger risk weights for foreign currency lending 
to unhedged borrowers and limits on loan-to- 
_______ 
52 These incentives include mortgage interest deductibility of 
varying generosity (Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, 
Hungary, Lithuania, and Poland);
 housing subsidies, including 
interest rate subsidies and savi
ng bonuses (Hungary, Croatia, 
the Czech Republic, and Poland); and exemption of primary 

residences from property tax and capital gains tax (in all 
countries). value and debt serviceŒto-income ratios. 
Establishing credit registries and strengthening 
nonbank financial sector supervision would 
substantially increase the effectiveness of these 
measures.These policies will ensure that convergence 
continues in emerging Europe. As discussed in 

Chapter 1, a gradual slowing of growth, which 
seems to be already under way in parts of the 

region, is the most likely scenario. However, a 
more abrupt adjustment cannot be excluded, given 
the considerable vulnerabilities in some countries. 
High levels of external debt in some cases suggest 
that these vulnerabilities will continue well into the 

medium term, making progress in implementing 
the recommended policies and reforms essential 
to prepare the region for unexpected shocks and 
to reduce external imbalances and the resulting 
vulnerabilities over time.
