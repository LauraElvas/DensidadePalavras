10ECB Annual Report
2008In 2008 the European Central Bank celebrated its tenth anniversary. With annual inß ation averaging only slightly above 2% in the euro 
area, we have witnessed a decade of relatively 
stable prices, in line with the ECB™s mandate 
to deliver price stability. Likewise, longer-term 
inß ation expectations have remained broadly 
anchored at levels in line with price stability 
during this time, reß ecting the high degree of 
credibility enjoyed by the ECB™s monetary 
policy. This success is also tangible proof 
of the institutional robustness, coherence and 
unity of the Eurosystem Œ of its capacity to act 
in a truly European spirit on the basis 
of shared values, high standards and 
common principles. From the outset, the 
euro has been a stable currency. It is now 
used by 329 million fellow citizens in 
16 euro area countries and is also widely 
accepted in international Þ nancial markets. 
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome 
the citizens of Slovakia to the euro area. 
Following the adoption of the euro by Cyprus 
and Malta in 2008, Slovakia joined the euro area 
as the 16th member on 1 January 2009.2008 was an exceptional year which was 

characterised by extraordinary economic 

and Þ nancial developments. Owing to strong 
rises in commodity prices, inß ation rose 
signiÞ cantly in the 
Þ rst half of 2008 and 
upside risks to price stability mounted over 

this period. Annual HICP inß ation peaked 
in the middle of the year, reaching 4.0% 

in both June and July. In particular, there 

were increasing indications of rising wage 

pressures. The monetary analysis conÞ rmed 
the assessment that upside risks to price 

stability prevailed. In order to prevent broad-
based second-round effects and to preserve 

the solid anchoring of inß ation expectations, 
the Governing Council of the ECB raised its 

key interest rates in July 2008. From mid-
September the Þ nancial tensions intensi
Þ ed 
considerably and increasingly spread to the 

real economy throughout the world. Together 

with strong declines in energy and other 

commodity prices, this led to a reduction in 

global and euro area inß ationary pressures. 
At the same time, uncertainty increased to 

an exceptional extent, affecting liquidity, 

asset prices and balance sheets. Overall, these 

developments implied signiÞ cantly higher 
downside risks to growth and a considerable 

reduction in inß ationary pressures in the 
medium term. 
In a coordinated move, the ECB and other major central banks announced reductions in their 
policy interest rates on 8 October 2008. Overall, 
between October 2008 and March 2009, the 
Governing Council lowered the key ECB 
interest rates by 275 basis points. The overnight 
money market rates fell even more steeply over 
this period, as the ECB signiÞ cantly enlarged 
its liquidity provision to euro area banks. These 
unprecedented decisions were fully in line with 
the ECB™s mandate to maintain price stability, 
in the light of declining inß ationary pressures 
and risks. The monetary analysis indicated that 
upside risks to price stability were gradually 
abating, as the underlying pace of monetary 
expansion decelerated, particularly in the 
second half of 2008. The growth of loans to 
the non-Þ nancial private sector also moderated 
11ECB Annual Report
2008in the course of the year, in line with the tightening of Þ nancing conditions and weaker 
economic activity. Overall, despite the clear deceleration in inß ation rates from mid-2008 onwards, average 
annual HICP inß ation in 2008 reached 3.3%, 
the highest level recorded since the introduction 
of the euro. This compared with rates of around 
2% in the preceding years. Notwithstanding 
sharp ß uctuations in headline in
ß ation rates, the 
ECB™s monetary policy succeeded in keeping 
medium and long-term inß ation expectations 
Þ rmly anchored at levels broadly consistent with 
price stability throughout 2008. At the same 
time, real GDP growth in the euro area slowed 
to 0.8% in 2008, following solid growth rates of 
2.7% in 2007 and 3.0% in 2006. While economic 
growth in the euro area at the beginning of 2008 
was relatively resilient, it deteriorated rapidly 
later in the year in the face of a pronounced 
slowdown in world economic activity. With regard to Þ scal policy, the relatively 
favourable Þ scal outcomes achieved in recent 
years were reversed in 2008 as the Þ nancial 
crisis unfolded and the macroeconomic 
environment deteriorated rapidly. According 

to the European Commission™s interim 

forecast of January 2009, the average 

general government deÞ cit in the euro area 
increased from 0.6% of GDP in 2007 to 

1.7% in 2008, and it is expected to increase 

considerably further to 4.0% of GDP in 2009. 

In October 2008 euro area countries agreed 

on coordinated action to stabilise the banking 

system, including the recapitalisation of 

Þ nancial institutions and guarantees for loans 
and deposits. In December 2008 the European 

Council approved a European Economic 

Recovery Plan which is intended to support 

economic recovery by strengthening aggregate 

demand and increasing efforts to implement 

the structural reforms envisaged by the Lisbon 

strategy. The rising Þ scal de
Þ cit and debt 
ratios and the highly uncertain outlook pose 

considerable challenges for Þ scal policy in 
the euro area. To support public conÞ dence in 
the sustainability of public Þ nances, a credible 
commitment to a path of consolidation in 

order to return to sound Þ scal positions, fully 
respecting the provisions of the Stability and 

Growth Pact, is of the essence. 
Turning to structural policies, the ongoing weakness of economic activity and high levels 
of uncertainty about the economic outlook 
imply the need to strengthen the resilience of 
the euro area economy. At the current juncture, 
it is essential to pursue economic policies 
in line with the principle of an open market 
economy with free competition, resisting any 
protectionist pressure. Moreover, product 
and services market reforms should foster 
competition. Labour market reforms should 
help to facilitate appropriate wage-setting, 
thereby protecting employment and fostering 
labour mobility across sectors and regions. This 
will be particularly important for those areas 
and sectors hit strongly by the negative demand 
shock. In several countries, it is also crucial to 
take measures to address competitiveness losses 
accumulated over recent years.***Challenges in Þ nancial markets mounted 
considerably during 2008. Euro money 
markets continued to be characterised by high 
credit spreads and very low trading volumes, 
notwithstanding the stabilising effect on these 
variables of the special measures which the ECB 
had started to introduce in 2007 and extended 
in 2008. These measures mainly consisted of 
ﬁfrontloadingﬂ the liquidity provision to the 
banking sector within reserve maintenance 
periods, increasing the average maturity of the 
Eurosystem™s reÞ nancing operations and, in 
cooperation with the Federal Reserve System, 
providing liquidity in US dollars.As tensions across all money market segments and maturities intensiÞ ed very signi
Þ cantly in mid-September 2008, the Eurosystem 
took further liquidity management measures 
to ensure the continued ability of banks to 
reÞ nance themselves. In particular, a 
Þ xed rate tender procedure with full allotment was 12ECB Annual Report
2008adopted for main reÞ nancing operations and 
all longer-term reÞ nancing operations, and the 
set of eligible collateral accepted in reÞ nancing operations was temporarily widened. Moreover, the corridor formed by the interest rates on the 
standing facilities was temporarily narrowed. 
As a result of these measures, banks generally 
continued to have broad access to euro liquidity, 
although tensions remained, especially at longer 
maturities. ***The ECB actively contributed to the key policy 
and regulatory responses which were adopted 
in 2008 to address the Þ nancial crisis and to 
strengthen the Þ nancial system. At the global 
level, the ECB participated in the deliberations 
leading to the recommendations of the Financial 
Stability Forum to the G7 Þ nance ministers and 
central bank governors in April 2008. These 
recommendations aim to strengthen prudential 
requirements, transparency and valuation 
frameworks, as well as improve the use of credit 
ratings, the authorities™ responsiveness to risks 
and arrangements for dealing with stress in the 
Þ nancial system. The ECB also contributed to 
other major global policy responses, namely 
the action plan agreed by the G20 countries on 
15 November 2008.At the European level, the ECB gave advice on the design of measures by public authorities to 
support the functioning of the banking sector. 
The Paris Declaration of the euro area countries 
of 12 October 2008 Œ subsequently endorsed by 
the European Council on 16 October Œ set out an 
action plan of coordinated measures to restore 
conÞ dence and improve 
Þ nancing conditions 
in the economy. These measures included the 
granting of government guarantees on bank debt 
issuance and the recapitalisation of banks. The 
Governing Council issued recommendations 
on the main features and pricing of government 
guarantees and recapitalisation instruments. 
The aims of the recommendations were 
to preserve the level playing-Þ eld among 
Þ nancial institutions, enhance the stability 
of the Þ nancial system, facilitate a return to 
normal market conditions, and ensure the proper 
Þ nancing of the economy. The recommendations 
were duly taken into consideration by the 
Member States in their actions and reß ected in the guidance issued by the European 
Commission regarding compliance with the 
state aid rules of the Treaty.In early 2009 the ECB contributed to the deÞ nition of guiding principles on asset relief 
measures aimed at removing the uncertainty 
surrounding the valuation of certain securitised 
assets on the balance sheets of Þ nancial institutions. The contribution of the ECB was 
reß ected in the guidance issued by the European 
Commission on such measures.***During 2008 the ECB continued to actively 
foster the process of European Þ nancial integration. The ECB provided advice in 
particular on Þ nancial regulation and supervision, 
as well as on securities clearing and settlement 
and payment systems. In addition, the ECB 
continued to act as a catalyst for private sector 
activities by facilitating collective action. The 
Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) initiative, 
which the ECB has strongly supported since its 
inception, reached its Þ rst major milestone with the launch of the SEPA credit transfer and the 
SEPA cards framework in January 2008. Since 
then, the Þ rst bene
Þ ts of SEPA have materialised 
for banks and, more importantly, have started to 
reach the end-users of payment services. In the Þ eld of central bank services that also foster 
Þ nancial integration, the decentralised 
Þ rst-generation TARGET system, the Eurosystem™s large-value payment system, was fully replaced 
by a second-generation single platform system 
(TARGET2) in May 2008. TARGET2 is the 
Þ rst market infrastructure to be completely 
integrated and harmonised at the European 
level. Furthermore, in July 2008 the Governing 
Council decided to build a new securities 
settlement platform called TARGET2-Securities 
(T2S). By offering harmonised, borderless and 
neutral settlement services in euro and other 13ECB Annual Report
2008currencies, T2S will be a major step towards an integrated securities market in Europe. In 
July 2008 the Governing Council also decided 
to establish a single shareable platform 
(CCBM2) for collateral mobilisation, with 
liquidity and collateral management facilities 
for Eurosystem counterparties.***At the end of 2008 the ECB had an approved 
headcount ceiling of 1,357.5 full-time 
equivalent positions, compared with 1,348 at 
the end of 2007. The members of staff of the 
ECB come from all 27 countries of the EU 
and are recruited by means of open selection 
campaigns to Þ ll vacancies published on the 
ECB™s website. In line with the ECB™s mobility 
policy, 165 members of staff moved internally 
to other positions in 2008, while 23 members of 
staff were seconded to other organisations and 
30 were granted unpaid leave, in most cases to 
take up employment with other organisations. 
The continuous acquisition and development of 
skills and competencies by all members of staff, 
including management, remained a cornerstone 
of the ECB™s human resources strategy. In 2008, in order to take into account the latest developments in terms of life expectancy and 
Þ nancial sustainability, the ECB started a 
review of the retirement plan it offers to its staff. 
The results of this review are expected to be 
implemented in spring 2009. ***The year 2008 brought fresh challenges with 
regard to the New ECB Premises project, as the 
public tender procedure for a general contractor 
did not produce a satisfactory economic result. 
Consequently, during the summer months all 
possible options were thoroughly examined, 
and the cost calculations and tender strategy 
were reviewed. Based on this analysis, the 
Governing Council decided to divide the 
procurement of construction works into the 
main separate trades and lots, and to restart the 
public tender procedure accordingly. Against the background of further research conducted 
on the construction market, the ECB remains 
determined to complete the project within the 
given budget. ***The ECB earned a surplus of •2.66 billion in 
2008 compared with a surplus of •0.29 billion 
in 2007. The Governing Council decided to 
transfer, as at 31 December 2008, an amount 
of •1.34 billion to the provision against foreign 
exchange rate, interest rate and gold price risks. 
The size of this provision, which, following 
the 2008 transfer, amounts to •4.01 billion, 
is reviewed annually. The ECB™s net result 
in 2008, after the transfer to the provision had

DEVELOPMENTS ANDMONETARY POLICY16ECBAnnual Report
2008In 2008 the ECB conducted its monetary 
policy against the backdrop of the Þ nancial 
turmoil observed since August 2007. The 

Governing Council kept the key ECB interest 

rates unchanged in the Þ rst half of 2008, 
before raising them by 25 basis points in July 

and then lowering them in three stages by a 

total of 175 basis points in the fourth quarter 

of the year. Developments in key ECB interest 

rates in 2008 reß ected the evolution of risks 
to price stability over the medium term, 

which were strongly inß uenced by two global 
phenomena: developments in international 

commodity prices, particularly energy and 

food prices; and the economic impact of the 

ongoing Þ nancial turmoil, which intensi
Þ ed in 
mid-September.In the Þ rst half of 2008 in
ß ationary pressures in 
the euro area increased, largely as a result of a very rapid increase in international commodity 
prices. Annual HICP inß ation remained well 
above 2% during this period, increasing from 
3.2% in January to peak at 4.0% in June and July, 
mainly owing to developments in energy and 
food prices. With inß ationary pressures rising in 
the presence of relatively tight labour markets, 
the risk of second-round effects increased. 
In addition, the underlying pace of broad money 
growth remained vigorous, despite moderating 
gradually from the peaks seen in the second half 
of 2007. In order to contain upside risks to price 
stability and ensure that long-term inß ation expectations remained solidly anchored in line 
with the ECB™s deÞ nition of price stability, the 
Governing Council raised the minimum bid rate 
in the main reÞ nancing operations by 25 basis 
points to 4.25% in July 2008. Moving into the third quarter of the year, until mid-September available data suggested that 
risks to price stability over the medium term 
remained on the upside. Uncertainty regarding 
the outlook for economic activity remained 
considerable, owing, among other things, to 
the very high and volatile commodity prices 
and the ongoing tensions in Þ nancial markets. 
Overall, downside risks to the economic outlook 
prevailed. As of mid-September, the Þ nancial turbulence 
intensiÞ ed signi
Þ cantly, causing severe 
disruptions and liquidity shortages in many 
Þ nancial market segments and leading to a 
substantial deterioration in the global economic 
outlook. Inß ation also fell sharply in the last few 
months of the year and inß ationary pressures 
weakened. Driven by declines in commodity 
prices, particularly oil prices, annual HICP 
inß ation fell in the second half of the year, 
reaching 1.6% in December. Monetary trends, 
which continued to moderate in the second half 
of the year, supported the view that inß ationary pressures were weakening. In this context, the 
main reÞ nancing rate was cut by 50 basis points 
to 3.75% on 8 October in a coordinated move 
together with other major central banks. The 
main reÞ nancing rate was then lowered by a 
further 50 basis points in November and another 
75 basis points in December and stood at 2.50% 
at the end of the year (see Chart 1). Real GDP growth in the euro area was sustained, 

but somewhat below trend in the Þ rst half of the 
year, although the impact that unusual weather 

conditions had on construction activity created 

volatility in the quarterly growth rates. Economic 

conditions worsened in the second half of 

2008, particularly after the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial market tensions in mid-September. 
The Þ nancial crisis spread to the real economy 
more broadly than had previously been expected. 

In the third quarter real GDP in the euro area 

contracted by 0.2% quarter on quarter, primarily 

reß ecting the large negative contribution of net 
trade, which stemmed from weak export growth 

combined with a strong rebound in imports. 

The fourth quarter saw a broad-based economic 

contraction amid heightened uncertainty, with 

real GDP contracting by a further 1.5%. Overall, 

euro area real GDP grew by 0.8% in 2008, 

signiÞ cantly less than the 2.7% recorded in 2007. 
Average annual HICP inß ation was very 
high in 2008, standing at 3.3%, the highest 
level since the introduction of the euro, 
after standing close to 2% in previous years 
(e.g. 2.1% in 2007). Inß ation increased from
3.2% in January to peak at 4.0% in June and July, 1 MONETARY POLICY DECISIONS 
17ECBAnnual Report
2008before declining to reach 1.6% in December. These inß ation developments were driven 
mainly by global developments in commodity 
prices, especially energy and food prices. 
In particular, oil prices increased from around 
USD 100 per barrel in January to peak at almost 
USD 150 in July, before falling to around 
USD 40 per barrel in December. For most of 
2008 the inß ation rate stood signi
Þ cantly above 
the ECB™s deÞ nition of price stability, mainly on 
account of those commodity price developments. 
Unit labour cost growth remained strong, driven 
by stronger wage increases in the presence of 
tighter labour markets and some second-round 
effects, but also a cyclical slowdown in labour 
productivity growth later in the year. Signs of an 
upward drift in long-term inß ation expectations 
derived from Þ nancial market instruments were 
apparent towards the middle of the year, but 
these disappeared after the interest rate increase 
in July and the reversal observed in the price of 
commodities, in particular oil, which reduced 
concerns regarding the emergence of second-
round effects. Overall, in spite of the sharp 
movements observed in inß ation owing to large 
changes in commodity prices, survey-based 
measures of long-term inß ation expectations 
remained broadly anchored at levels consistent 
with price stability, in line with the medium-
term orientation of the ECB™s monetary policy.The underlying pace of monetary expansion moderated over the course of 2008, but remained 
vigorous. While M3 growth tended to overstate 
trend monetary dynamics owing to the impact 
of the ß at yield curve and other temporary 
factors, particularly in the Þ rst half of the year, a 
broad-based assessment of the components and 
counterparts of M3 conÞ rmed that underlying 
money growth remained strong. The growth of 
loans to the non-Þ nancial private sector also 
moderated in the course of the year, in line 
with the tightening of Þ nancing conditions and 
weaker economic activity. The increased stress 
observed in the Þ nancial system as a result of 
the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial tensions 
in September was apparent in the monetary 
data towards the end of the year. As regards 
monetary aggregates, that increased stress 
mainly triggered shifts between the components 
of M3, rather than having an impact on M3 
itself. The subdued developments in loans at the 
end of the year conÞ rmed that corporate credit 
had weakened signiÞ cantly following a long

2008period of dynamic growth. Those developments mainly reß ected the slowdown in real economic 
activity, although supply factors may also have 
played a role, as indicated by the Eurosystem™s 
bank lending survey. Overall, monetary trends 
supported the view that inß ationary pressures 
weakened towards the end of 2008.INFLATIONARY PRESSURES LED TO AN INCREASE 

IN KEY ECB INTEREST RATES IN JULY 2008Looking more closely at the monetary policy 
decisions taken in 2008, the year can be divided 
into two parts: the period up until summer 2008, 
when the data available at the time indicated 
increasing upside risks to price stability; and 
the post-summer period, when new information 
indicated that the ongoing Þ nancial turmoil and 
the global economic slowdown were having a 
stronger impact on euro area activity and that 
inß ationary pressures were weakening. 
In the Þ rst half of the year economic conditions 
were characterised by high levels of uncertainty 
regarding the ongoing reappraisal of risk in 
Þ nancial markets and its potential impact on 
the real economy. Quarterly growth had begun 
to moderate in the course of 2007. Indicators 
of business and consumer conÞ dence had also 
begun to decline, but in early 2008 remained 
at levels that pointed to sustained growth. The 
outlook for economic growth had moderated 
somewhat, but was still relatively favourable 
at the beginning of 2008. It was expected that 
domestic and foreign demand would moderate, 
but continue to support ongoing growth. Despite 
the dampening effect of higher commodity 
prices, consumption growth was expected to 
contribute to economic expansion, in line with 
rising employment, as unemployment rates 
had fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. With 
resilient economic activity in emerging market 
economies expected to mitigate the impact that 
the US economic slowdown would have on the 
euro area™s foreign demand, external demand 
was expected to provide sustained support to 
euro area exports. Indeed, in the Þ rst half of the year incoming 
macroeconomic data suggested that real GDP growth would moderate, but only slightly. The June 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections foresaw average annual real 
GDP growth of between 1.5% and 2.1% in 2008 
and between 1.0% and 2.0% in 2009. While the 
projections for 2008 remained at the lower end 
of the range published in December 2007, the 
projections for 2009 were revised downwards 
somewhat. The uncertainty surrounding the 
outlook for economic growth was considerable, 
and risks were considered to lie on the downside. 
Those risks related mainly to the potential for 
Þ nancial market developments to have a broader 
than expected impact on Þ nancing conditions 
and economic sentiment, with a negative impact 
on world and euro area growth. Further downside 
risks stemmed from the scope for additional 
increases in oil and other commodity prices, 
concerns regarding protectionist pressures 
and the possibility of disorderly developments 
owing to global imbalances. At the same time, the euro area was experiencing a period of rising annual rates of inß ation, mainly 
as a result of sharp increases in energy and food 
prices at the global level. Annual HICP inß ation was above 3% at the start of 2008 and increased 
from 3.2% in January to 3.7% in May, with 
strong upward pressure on headline inß ation in the short term. Consequently, the Governing 
Council noted in June that risks to price stability 
over the medium term had increased further. 
HICP inß ation was expected to remain high 
for a more protracted period than previously 
thought. There were also signs of an upward 
drift in long-term inß ation expectations. The 
June 2008 Eurosystem staff projections foresaw 
average annual HICP inß ation of between 3.2% and 3.6% in 2008 and between 1.8% and 3.0% in 
2009. The ranges projected for inß ation in 2008 
and 2009 were thus markedly higher than those 
in previous staff projections, mainly reß ecting higher oil and food prices and increasing 
inß ationary pressures in the services sector. 
There was also a concern that wage growth 
might turn out to be stronger than expected, 
taking into account the high levels of capacity 
utilisation, the tight labour market conditions 
and the risk of second-round effects. 19ECBAnnual Report
2008Despite moderating, the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M3 remained vigorous. 
A number of temporary factors, particularly 
the relatively ß at yield curve, suggested that 
M3 growth was overstating the pace of the 
underlying monetary expansion. Even taking 
such effects into account, a broad-based 
assessment of the monetary data conÞ rmed that 
the underlying rate of money and credit growth 
remained strong. The growth of household 
borrowing had moderated somewhat, reß ecting the impact of the increases in key ECB interest 
rates as of December 2005 and the cooling 
housing markets in several parts of the euro area. 
However, the growth of loans to non-Þ nancial corporations remained robust. In this context, the Governing Council considered that the risks to price stability remained clearly 
on the upside and had increased further. Those 
risks stemmed in particular from the possibility 
of second-round effects on wage and price-
setting, but also from the potential for further 
rises in oil and food prices. The possibility of 
increases in administered prices and indirect 
taxes that exceeded those foreseen at the time 
also constituted an upside risk to the inß ation outlook. This assessment was supported by 
cross-checking with data on money and credit 
growth. Given the strong growth seen in money 
and credit aggregates, the monetary analysis 
conÞ rmed the indications from the economic 
analysis that upside risks to price stability 
prevailed over the medium to longer term. The 
Governing Council stressed its determination to 
Þ rmly anchor medium and long-term in
ß ation expectations in line with price stability.In order to prevent broad-based second-round effects and counteract the increasing upside 
risks to price stability over the medium term, the 
Governing Council decided to raise the key ECB 
interest rates by 25 basis points on 3 July 2008, 
having kept rates unchanged since June 2007 
in view of the heightened level of uncertainty 
in the context of the ongoing Þ nancial turmoil. 
The Governing Council emphasised its strong 
determination to keep medium and long-
term inß ation expectations 
Þ rmly anchored in 
line with price stability. This would preserve 
purchasing power in the medium term and 
continue to support sustainable growth and 
employment in the euro area.Moving into the third quarter of 2008, the real GDP growth Þ gures that were to be released 
for the second quarter of 2008 were expected 
to be substantially weaker than those for the 
Þ rst quarter of the year. While this was partly 
a technical reaction to the strong growth seen in 
the Þ rst few months of the year, it also re
ß ected a weakening of GDP growth owing to slower 
expansion at the global level and the dampening 
effects of high and volatile oil and food prices. 
Uncertainty regarding the outlook for economic 
activity remained considerable, owing, among 
other things, to the very high and volatile 
commodity prices and the ongoing tensions 
in Þ nancial markets. Overall, downside risks 
continued to prevail.At the same time, information available in August and September conÞ rmed that annual 
inß ation rates were likely to remain well 
above levels consistent with price stability 
for a protracted period of time. The data also 
suggested that risks to price stability over the 
medium term remained on the upside. Having 
reached 4.0% in June, inß ation had remained at 
4.0% in July and stood at 3.8% in August, largely 
as a result of both the direct and the indirect 
effects of previous strong increases in energy 
and food prices at the global level. Moreover, it 
was conÞ rmed that wage growth had accelerated 
signiÞ cantly. With labour productivity growth 
slowing, this resulted in sharp increases in unit 
labour costs. WEAKENING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES LED TO 

MONETARY POLICY EASING IN THE LATTER PART 

OF 2008The Þ nancial tensions intensi
Þ ed in September, 
dominated by events in US markets, particularly 
following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers 
on 15 September. This led to substantial 
volatility in all Þ nancial market segments, low 
levels of liquidity across a number of market 
segments, signiÞ cant restructuring at several 
20ECBAnnual Report
2008large Þ nancial institutions, a 
Þ nancial crisis 
in Iceland and contagion effects for other countries, and unprecedented policy action by 
governments. The Þ nancial market turmoil 
also resulted in a signiÞ cant increase in risk 
aversion. This could be seen, inter alia, in the 
substantial widening of corporate and sovereign 
bond spreads, which had a signiÞ cant downward 
impact on the real economy. At its meeting on 
2 October the Governing Council discussed 
extensively the recent intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial market turmoil and its possible impact 
on economic activity and inß ation, recognising 
the extraordinarily high level of uncertainty 
stemming from recent developments. As the 
world economy as a whole was feeling the 
adverse effects of this prolonged and intense 
period of Þ nancial market turmoil, economic 
activity was also weakening in the euro area. Inß ationary pressures had begun to moderate in 
the euro area, as well as in a number of other major countries in the world economy, mainly 
reß ecting a marked decline in energy and 
other commodity prices. Inß ation expectations 
had declined, returning to levels consistent 
with the ECB™s deÞ nition of price stability. 
By increasing the downside risks to growth, the 
intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial crisis had also 
reduced the upside risks to price stability.In a coordinated move, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the ECB, the Federal Reserve 
System, Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss 
National Bank announced reductions in policy 
interest rates on 8 October. In this context, the 
Governing Council lowered key ECB interest 
rates by 50 basis points, acknowledging that 
upside inß ationary risks in the euro area had 
recently decreased and inß ationary pressures had 
begun to moderate. The Governing Council also 
adopted two temporary measures to support the 
implementation of monetary policy, narrowing 
the corridor formed by the rates on the standing 
facilities and announcing full allotment at Þ xed rates in its tender operations. Tensions increasingly spilled over from the Þ nancial sector to the real economy and from 
advanced economies to emerging market 
economies. The outlook for global growth 
deteriorated sharply, implying a contraction 
in foreign demand that would have a negative 
impact on euro area activity. Business conÞ dence indicators, which had started to decline in 
mid-2007, began to fall faster and reached 
new record lows every month. The fourth 
quarter was marked by a broad-based economic 
slowdown with a high level of uncertainty, and 
governments announced substantial economic 
stimulus packages. Incoming information 
on current economic developments justiÞ ed the more pessimistic outlook, which was due 
notably to the materialisation of previously 
identiÞ ed risks stemming from the 
Þ nancial market tensions. Looking ahead, global 
economic weakness and very sluggish domestic 
demand were expected to persist in the following 
few quarters. In fact, the December 2008 
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections 
for the euro area indicated that the outlook had 
signiÞ cantly deteriorated. Annual real GDP 
growth was projected to lie between -1.0% and 
0.0% for 2009 and between 0.5% and 1.5% 
for 2010. These Þ gures represented substantial 
downward revisions relative to the previous staff 
projections. The economic outlook continued to 
be surrounded by an exceptionally high degree 
of uncertainty, and risks to economic growth 
remained on the downside.With regard to price developments, annual HICP inß ation had declined substantially, 
falling to 2.1% in November, down from 3.2% 
in October and 3.6% in September. Inß ation rates were expected to continue to decline in 
the coming months. The intensiÞ cation and 
broadening of the Þ nancial market turmoil was 
likely to dampen global and euro area demand 
for a protracted period of time. In such an 
environment, taking into account the strong 
declines observed in commodity prices in recent 
months, price, cost and wage pressures in the 
euro area were also expected to moderate. The 
December 2008 Eurosystem staff projections 
foresaw annual HICP inß ation of between 1.1% 
and 1.7% for 2009 and between 1.5% and 2.1% 
for 2010. For 2009, these projections constituted 21ECBAnnual Report
2008substantial downward revisions in relation to the previous staff projections, mainly reß ecting the 
large declines observed in commodity prices and 
the impact of weakening demand. Risks to price 
stability at the policy-relevant medium-term 
horizon were considered to be more balanced 
than in the previous quarter. Turning to the monetary analysis, data available towards the end of 2008 showed that 
the annual growth rates of broad money and 
credit aggregates, while still remaining strong, 
continued to decline. The intensiÞ cation of
the Þ nancial market turmoil observed since
mid-September had been seen as a potential 
watershed in the evolution of monetary 
developments, with money and credit data for 
October indicating a signiÞ cant impact on the 
behaviour of market participants. However, in 
November there were some signs of a return 
to the pattern of monetary developments seen 
prior to Lehman Brothers™ default. Overall, both 
the broad aggregate M3 and, in particular, the 
components of M3 most closely related to the 
ongoing Þ nancial tensions Œ such as holdings 
of money market funds Œ showed considerable 
month-to-month volatility in the Þ nal months 
of 2008. Looking through this volatility, 
the underlying pace of broad money growth 
continued to gradually decline from the peak seen 
in 2007. However, the intensiÞ cation of 
Þ nancial tensions observed as of September 2008 led to 
signiÞ cant substitution among the components 
of M3. Monetary analysis also indicated the 
continued moderation of the growth rate of 
loans to the non-Þ nancial private sector. Prior 
to December this was largely on account of 
weakness in loans to households, especially 
for house purchase, but by the turn of the year 
a clear decline was also observed in the growth 
rate of loans to non-Þ nancial corporations. These 
subdued developments in loans seem mainly to 
reß ect the slowdown in real economic activity, 
although the Eurosystem™s bank lending survey 
suggests that supply factors may also have 
played a role. The heightened level of stress 
in the Þ nancial system remained apparent in 
the monetary data towards the end of the year. Overall, monetary trends supported the view that 
inß ationary pressures were weakening further.
These revisions to the outlook for economic 
activity, and therefore also for inß ation, warranted 
signiÞ cant monetary policy easing. On the basis 
of its regular economic and monetary analyses, 
the Governing Council decided to reduce the 
key ECB interest rates by a further 50 basis 
points at its meeting on 6 November, in line with 
the reduction in upside risks to price stability 
arising from the materialisation of downside 
risks to growth. At its meeting on 4 December 
the Governing Council then decided to reduce 
the key ECB interest rates by a further 75 basis 
points. Evidence obtained since its last meeting 
showed that inß ationary pressures had weakened 
further and, looking ahead, inß ation rates were 
expected to be in line with price stability over 
the policy-relevant horizon. 22ECBAnnual Report
20082 MONETARY, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS2.1 THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC 
ENVIRONMENT 
REPERCUSSIONS OF THE FINANCIAL MARKET 
TURMOIL ON GLOBAL ACTIVITY 
In 2008 the Þ nancial market turbulence 
intensiÞ ed and reached levels not seen in 
decades, with severe consequences for the real 
economy in the latter part of the year. In the 
Þ rst half of the year, the economic weakness in the United States extended beyond the housing 
sector, and the global repercussions of the 
Þ nancial turmoil translated into a slowdown 
in economic growth in major developed 
economies. Overall, global economic activity 
remained relatively well supported by the 
resilience in the economic conditions of 
emerging markets. However, from mid-
September, when the Þ nancial crisis resulted 
in the collapse of a major US investment bank 
and the unravelling of a number of large actors 
in the global Þ nancial system, the challenges 
facing economic activity intensiÞ ed. Global 
economic conditions deteriorated rapidly 
in view of faltering consumer and business 
conÞ dence, tighter credit conditions worldwide 
and adverse wealth effects stemming from 
declining house prices and equity valuations. 
While important and unprecedented measures 
were taken by governments and central banks 
around the world to limit systemic risks and to 
restore Þ nancial stability, the 
Þ nancial market 
turmoil led to the global downturn becoming 
increasingly synchronised, which ampliÞ ed the adverse feedback between the Þ nancial crisis and real economic activity. Towards 
the end of the year, most advanced economies 
were already in or on the brink of recession. 
Moreover, the economic weakness began to 
spread more forcefully to emerging economies. 
In particular, economic conditions in countries 
with large external and domestic imbalances 
deteriorated rapidly, and economic growth in 
small open economies moderated signiÞ cantly in a very short space of time. Global inß ation developments were strongly 
affected by the sharp movements in commodity prices and global economic conditions. In the Þ rst half of the year, global in
ß ationary pressures mounted. In the OECD countries, 
annual headline inß ation peaked at 4.8% 
in July 2008. This was mostly due to rising 
food and energy prices. On 11 July 2008 
Brent crude oil prices surged to a record level 
of USD 147.5 per barrel. Emerging economies, 
with a higher weight of food in the consumption 
basket, experienced even stronger inß ationary pressures. In the second half of the year, 
however, a sharp reversal in commodity prices 
associated with the global economic slowdown 
signiÞ cantly alleviated global in
ß ation rates. 
Oil prices plummeted in the second half of the 
year and stood close to USD 40 per barrel by the 
end of 2008. Accordingly, after passing its peak Chart 2a Main developments in major

2008in July, annual inß ation in the OECD countries 
slowed to 1.5% in December. Excluding food and energy, consumer prices rose by 2.0% in the 
year to December.UNITED STATESIn the United States, economic activity 
decelerated markedly in 2008. For the whole 
of 2008, real GDP increased at a rate of 1.1%. 
While there was positive growth in the Þ rst half of the year partly due to temporary Þ scal stimulus measures and support from foreign 
trade, intensifying Þ nancial market strains, 
restrictive credit conditions and weaker foreign 
demand all contributed to an outright contraction 
in output throughout the second half of 2008. 
Private consumption was negatively affected 
by deteriorating consumer sentiment and labour 
market conditions, in addition to a decline in 
household wealth owing to falling house prices 
and equity valuations. At the same time, business 
investment weakened amid declining corporate 
proÞ ts, tighter lending standards, as well as the 
broadly weakening outlook for demand. The 
ongoing housing market correction Œ intensiÞ ed by the Þ nancial turmoil Œ continued to be a 
major drag on the economy, with residential 
investment subtracting 0.9 percentage point 
from GDP growth in 2008. Foreign trade was 
a major contributor to growth throughout most 
of 2008, reß ecting buoyant external demand 
earlier in the year and the lagged effects of past 
US dollar depreciation. However, the positive 
trade effect faded towards the end of the year 
as a sharp economic slowdown in a number of 
US trading partners weighed on foreign demand 
and exports. Nonetheless, the current account 
deÞ cit narrowed from 5.3% of GDP in 2007 to 
5.0% on average in the Þ rst three quarters of 
2008, although this improvement was limited 
somewhat by the higher price of oil and other 
commodities during most of that period, which 
pushed up the average value of imported goods 
relative to the previous year. As regards US price developments, the average annual rate of change in the CPI for 2008 was 
3.8%, up from 2.9% the year before. Headline 
inß ation oscillated in a wider than usual range, 
reß ecting volatility in oil and other commodity 
prices. CPI inß ation was at elevated levels during 
the Þ rst half of 2008 and peaked at 5.6% in July 
amid rapidly rising energy costs. Towards the 
end of the year, the annual rate of change in the 
CPI fell sharply to 0.1% in December owing to 
sharp falls in commodity prices and increasing 
slack in the economy as the recession deepened. 
Excluding food and energy, annual CPI inß ation stood at 2.3% in 2008 (the same as in 2007). 
The declining trend throughout most of the year 
reß ected to some extent a deceleration in the 
owner-equivalent rent component. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve System decreased the 
target for the federal funds rate from 4.25% at 
the beginning of 2008 to a range from 0.0% to 
0.25% by the end of the year. At its meeting in 
December 2008, the Committee anticipated that 
weak economic conditions were likely to warrant 
exceptionally low levels in the policy rate for 
some time to come. The FOMC undertook a 
number of targeted programmes to enhance 
liquidity and provide support to Þ nancial markets in view of deteriorating conditions. As regards Þ scal policy, the federal budget 
deÞ cit widened in the 2008 
Þ scal year Œ which 
started in October 2007 Œ compared with the previous year. This stemmed from a combination 
of lower tax receipts as the economy slowed 
and an increase in government spending, partly 
reß ecting the implementation of 
Þ scal stimulus 
measures. According to estimates from the 
Congressional Budget OfÞ ce, the federal budget 
deÞ cit stood at 3.2% in the 2008 
Þ scal year. 
JAPANIn Japan, economic expansion ended abruptly 
in 2008, with slightly positive growth in the 
Þ rst quarter followed by a marked decrease in 
overall production thereafter. Strong external 
demand and domestic investment supported 
real GDP growth in the Þ rst quarter. However, 
substantial declines in net exports and business 
investment Œ which had been the driving force of 
the Japanese recovery in previous years Œ along 
with restrained consumption owing to increasing 24ECBAnnual Report
2008labour market uncertainty and declining real incomes offset the positive growth of the Þ rst quarter and resulted in negative GDP growth 
rates for the rest of the year. Consumer price 
inß ation accelerated noticeably in the 
Þ rst half 
of the year, peaking at 2.3% in July, but slowed 
to 0.4% in December. While the Japanese 
banking sector remained relatively resilient to 
the global Þ nancial market turmoil, substantial 
stock market losses and the intensiÞ cation of 
the Þ nancial turmoil had a negative impact 
on Þ rms™ investment and consumption in the 
second half of the year. A strong appreciation 
in effective terms of the Japanese yen put 
additional downward pressure on proÞ tability and investment in export-oriented industries. 
In view of the rapid deterioration in economic 
conditions, the Bank of Japan decided to lower 
its target for the uncollateralised overnight 
call rate cumulatively by 40 basis points 
to 0.1% at its meetings on 31 October and 
19 December 2008, after having left the target 
unchanged since February 2007.EMERGING ASIAIn the course of 2008 economic activity slowed 

down gradually in emerging Asia. Amid the 

broadening of the economic slowdown and 

tight global Þ nancial conditions, export growth 
declined sharply in the second half of the year, 

especially in small open economies, such as 

Singapore, Taiwan P.o.C. and Hong Kong 

S.A.R. The overall slowdown in economic 

activity was also driven by a weakening of 

domestic demand owing to deteriorating 

consumer and business conÞ dence, and the 
downturn in real estate investment. 
Rising commodity and food prices led consumer 
price inß ation to increase in many countries in 
the Þ rst half of the year. In some countries, 
this led to an erosion of consumer purchasing 

power and some weakening in consumption 

expenditure. However, inß ationary pressures 
started to ease in the second half of the year, 

owing to a signiÞ cant decline in the prices of 
oil and food products. Given these countries™ 

relatively sound macroeconomic performance 

and limited direct exposure to derivatives linked 
to sub-prime mortgages, until mid-September 

there were only low levels of spillover from 

the Þ nancial turmoil into economic activity. 
Since then, however, the sudden shift towards 

risk aversion and the strong deleveraging at 

the global level have induced a signiÞ cant 
sell-off on equity markets and a sharp 

depreciation of local currencies in most of 

emerging Asia. Financial market volatility 

has varied across countries. Its impact on 

China was more contained owing to the 

relatively closed and less developed state of 

its Þ nancial system, while stronger 
Þ nancial 
market volatility in Korea and Indonesia was 

observed amid concerns about the high level 

of domestic debt and falling commodity prices 

respectively.

2008As regards the Chinese economy, real GDP growth declined from 13% in 2007 to 9% in 
2008. The economic slowdown was driven by 
both external and domestic factors. Reß ecting the trade surplus and money inß ows induced by 
expectations of steady exchange rate appreciation 
and a positive interest rate differential 
until September 2008, the foreign reserves 
continued to rise, totalling USD 1.9 trillion 
in 2008. Consumer price inß ation peaked in 
February at 8.7%, but then dropped signiÞ cantly in response to the stabilisation of domestic food 
prices. In September, when inß ation had receded 
and the global Þ nancial crisis was intensifying, 
Chinese authorities shifted policies towards 
measures aimed at enhancing economic growth. 
The People™s Bank of China started to ease its 
monetary policy stance: the one-year benchmark 
lending and deposit rates were cut respectively 
Þ ve and four times by a total of 216 and 
189 basis points, and the reserve requirement 
ratio was lowered by 200-400 basis points, 

depending on the institution. Furthermore, the 

steady pace of appreciation of the renminbi 

against the US dollar halted in the fourth quarter. 
LATIN AMERICAEconomic growth in Latin America was robust 

in the Þ rst half of 2008 (around 5% in South 
America, but only 2.1% in Mexico), while 

inß ationary pressures were elevated and rose 
throughout the year, with inß ation rates for 
the region increasing to 8.7% in 2008 from 

6.1% in 2007. Countries with Þ xed or quasi-
Þ xed exchange rates recorded higher in
ß ation 
than those with an inß ation-targeting regime. 
Improved macroeconomic fundamentals, high 

commodity prices and strong domestic demand 

continued to support the economic outlook 

in the Þ rst half of 2008, but also resulted in 
increased inß ationary pressures. However, 
from mid-September 2008 external Þ nancial 
conditions deteriorated as the global Þ nancial 
crisis unfolded. In particular, spreads on credit 

default swaps on Latin American sovereign 

debt widened considerably, especially in 

Argentina and Venezuela (by around 4,000 

and 3,000 basis points respectively at the end 

of the year). In addition, currencies fell vis-à-vis the US dollar, equity markets dropped 

signiÞ cantly by around 50% over the year and 
liquidity shortages emerged. Brazil and Mexico 

were particularly hit by liquidity shortages, as 

large outß ows affected the 
Þ nancial landscape 
of the region. 
SHARP DECLINES IN COMMODITY PRICES IN THE 

SECOND HALF OF 2008Commodity price developments attracted a 
great amount of attention throughout 2008. In 
the Þ rst half of the year, oil prices continued to 
surge with increasing momentum and peaked 
on 11 July at USD 147.5 per barrel of Brent 
crude oil (see Chart 3). Thereafter, prices 
started to decline, and the downward trend was 
exacerbated by the Þ nancial market turmoil. At 
the end of 2008, prices stood at USD 39.5 per 
barrel. Measured in euro terms, this corresponds 
to roughly the level recorded in December 2004. 
For the year as a whole, the average price of 
Brent crude oil was USD 98.3, which was 35% 
above the average of the previous year. The Þ rst half of the year was characterised by 
very tight market conditions. On the supply side, non-OPEC supply Þ gures repeatedly

2008disappointed expectations. This development forced OPEC to increase production to match 
demand. In turn, this led to an exceptionally 
low spare capacity in OPEC member countries, 
amplifying concerns over possible supply 
disruptions owing to geopolitical events. On the 
other hand, demand continued to grow robustly. 
While increasing prices caused demand to 
moderate in OECD countries, this did not happen 
in emerging economies, where oil imports were 
buoyant owing to strong economic growth and 
government subsidies. Against this background, 
stocks in OECD countries declined, and prices 
proved extremely reactive to any news or 
rumours suggesting gloomier conditions for the 
supply-demand balance. In mid-July stocks in the United States started to increase counter-seasonally, which triggered 
the subsequent price correction. The decline was 
exacerbated by the Þ nancial market turmoil and 
its impact on the global economic outlook. This 
led to the heavy downward revision of demand 
projections, including for emerging economies. 
Against this background, OPEC acted to stabilise 
prices by means of sizeable supply cuts. The prices of non-energy commodities were also extremely volatile throughout the year (see 
Chart 3). The index increased strongly in the Þ rst quarter of 2008, mainly driven by agricultural 
commodities, and moved sideways thereafter. 
As energy prices started to decline, non-energy 
commodity prices followed, with the subsequent 
Þ nancial market turmoil hitting metals prices 
in particular. In aggregate terms, non-energy 
commodity prices (denominated in US dollars) 
increased by an average of approximately 14% 
in 2008 compared with the previous year. 2.2 MONETARY AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS 
THE UNDERLYING PACE OF BROAD MONEY 
GROWTH MODERATED IN THE COURSE OF THE 

YEAR, WHILE NONETHELESS REMAINING ROBUSTHaving peaked in the fourth quarter of 2007, 

the underlying pace of broad money and 

credit growth in the euro area moderated in 
the course of 2008. This is reß ected in the 
declining annual growth rates of both the broad 

monetary aggregate M3 and MFI loans to the 

private sector, which fell to 7.3% and 5.8% 

respectively in December 2008, substantially 

lower than the 11.5% and 11.2% seen a year 

earlier (see Chart 4). 
Despite moderating steadily, M3 growth remained robust in 2008. This partly reß ected a 
stimulative effect stemming from the relatively 
ß at euro area yield curve, which encouraged 
shifts from longer-term assets into short-
term monetary instruments (notably MFI 
time deposits) that offered similar levels of 
remuneration but were subject to less risk. Such 
effects are unlikely to continue once the slope 
of the yield curve normalises. However, when 
these and other temporary effects are taken into 
account using a broad-based analysis of the 
monetary data, the trend rate of broad monetary 
expansion remained robust at the end of the year, 
as reß ected, for instance, in the strong growth of 
household deposits. The moderation of broad money and credit growth in the course of 2008 largely reß ected the impact of past increases in interest rates, Chart 4 M3 and loans to the private sector

2008generally tighter Þ nancing conditions and the 
slowdown in economic activity. Although at times the prevailing Þ nancial tensions had a 
signiÞ cant impact on those speciÞ c components and counterparts of M3 that were most closely 
related to the nature of the turmoil (e.g. holdings 
of money market fund shares/units), the Þ nancial turmoil did not, overall, give rise to sharp breaks in the moderating trend of broad money 
and credit growth. Meanwhile, the results of 
the Eurosystem™s bank lending survey suggest 
a progressive tightening of credit standards 
over the course of the year. For a more detailed 
analysis of the impact that the Þ nancial turmoil 
has had on monetary analysis at the euro area 
level, see Box 1.Box 1THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL MARKET TENSIONS ON MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS 
The Þ nancial tensions that started in August 2007 have had a profound impact on shorter-
term developments in some items on the MFI balance sheet, leading in a number of cases to 
signiÞ cantly higher volatility and changes in the direction of growth. This box discusses examples 
of such visible effects in different phases of the period of tension. Three broad phases are used 
as reference points: the phase in which the tensions started, covering the period from August 
2007 to February 2008 (including the uncertainties that prevailed at the end of 2007), the phase 
from March 2008 to mid-September 2008, and the phase from mid-September 2008 onwards, in 
which the tensions intensiÞ ed.Visible effects on the components of M3One example of the Þ nancial tensions having a clear impact on the components of the monetary
 aggregate M3 is their effect on marketable instruments such as money market fund shares/units or 
short-term MFI debt securities. The volatility of 

the monthly ß ows into/out of these instruments 
has increased, although there have been distinct 

periods of outß ows and in
ß ows (see Chart A). 
That increased volatility has coincided with 

substantial declines in the annual growth rates 

of these instruments.The increases in uncertainty observed during 
the Þ rst phase of the tensions were re
ß ected 
in sizeable outß ows from money market funds 
both at the very start of the tensions in August 

2007 and again in December 2007, driven by 

concerns about the exposure of some euro area 

money market funds to asset-backed securities. 

However, these outß ows appear to have been 
reversed in subsequent months, and the rebound 

in January 2008 was the largest inß ow recorded 
since the start of Monetary Union. In the second 

phase, the monthly ß ows were mostly negative

2008but small, and those cumulative outß ows were more or less offset by a strong in
ß ow in August, 
just before the tensions intensiÞ ed. The third phase then saw out
ß ows in September and October, 
which, by contrast with the outß ows in the 
Þ rst phase, were due to an increase in risk aversion 
towards money market funds on a wider scale triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and 
losses incurred by US money market funds investing in its commercial paper. This was exacerbated 

by the fact that banks™ funding behaviour led to a rechannelling of funds from money market funds 

into favourably remunerated bank deposits. However, in the Þ nal two months of 2008, despite 
the fact that the enhanced deposit guarantee schemes announced by governments do not cover 

money market funds, positive ß ows were recorded again, suggesting that euro area residents™ fears 
regarding the possible failure of such funds have been fading away.Developments in short-term debt securities with a maturity of up to two years were, to some extent, a mirror image of those in money market funds, implying that the overall effect 
on shorter-term developments in the broader monetary aggregates was limited. This can be 
explained by the attractive remuneration of short-term debt securities, which may have led 
institutional investors in particular to initially hold them as a substitute for money market fund 
shares when the latter were perceived to be exposed to counterparty credit risk. In the second 
phase, the perceived counterparty credit risk gradually shifted to credit institutions and tended to 
result in money holders acquiring a much smaller amount of short-term MFI debt securities. In 
the third phase, while there was a large inß ow into debt securities in September, monthly 
ß ows turned negative in the last three months of 2008, reß ecting the reluctance of the money-holding sector to acquire these instruments on a net basis.By contrast with marketable instruments, there has been little visible impact on other components of M3. An impact on M1 was visible only in the third phase of the crisis, when the default of 
Lehman Brothers triggered more widespread concerns about the stability of banking systems 
and led to considerable withdrawals of cash 
from euro area banks (see Chart B). In October 
2008 currency in circulation was around 
•35 billion higher than in previous months. 
Flows normalised again in November and 
December, though the October increase did not 
unwind, suggesting that the sizeable share of 
additional currency in circulation may largely 
reß ect demand by non-residents. A similar 
pattern was observed for overnight deposits, 
with strong inß ows in October as the high level 
of uncertainty prompted money holders to keep 
their funds in highly liquid deposits. In this 
respect, overnight deposits have been used on a 
temporary basis to park funds transferred from 
other types of deposit or received following the 
sale of long-term debt securities and shares. 
These inß ows were reversed in November in 
line with the announcement of government 
measures to support the banking system and 
thus the return of remuneration considerations 
in the allocation of funds. Renewed inß ows Chart B Monthly flows into or out of currency

2008were recorded in December, but these could simply signal a desire on the part of money holders Œ and non-monetary Þ nancial intermediaries other than insurance corporations and pension funds 
(other Þ nancial intermediaries Œ OFIs) in particular Œ to hold liquid assets at the turn of the year.
Visible effects on the counterparts of M3Turning to the counterparts of M3, the dynamics of overall credit to the private sector did not change substantially as a consequence of the Þ nancial tensions. However, there were more 
visible changes at more disaggregated levels.In particular, the ß ow of loans to OFIs was strong in the Þ rst phase of the tensions, reß ecting 
the fact that conduits set up by banks and classiÞ ed as OFIs, faced with investors™ increased 
reluctance to fund them, tapped credit lines granted by their sponsoring banks (see Chart C). 
The ß ow remained considerable for most of the second phase; however, it is probable that 
this increasingly reß ected the short-term need for 
Þ nancing and liquidity buffers on the part 
of investment funds. Whereas during the Þ rst phase MFIs provided funding to their conduits 
in the OFI sector directly through loans, in the second phase they did so by purchasing 

those conduits™ debt securities. This increasingly took the form of ﬁretained securitisation 

operationsﬂ, whereby MFIs sold part of their loan book to special-purpose vehicles and bought 

back the underlying securities in order to use them as collateral in Eurosystem operations. 

This led to a reduction in the contribution of loans to the expansion in overall MFI credit 

and a corresponding increase in the contribution of debt securities. In the third phase of the 

tensions, retained securitisation operations and their impact on the MFI balance sheet became 

even more important as the extent to which MFIs used debt securities to receive liquidity 

from the Eurosystem increased. At the same time, lending to OFIs declined, reß ecting a fall in 
intermediation in connection with the slowdown in real activity.Chart C Monthly flows of loans to OFIs,

2008THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE FINANCIAL 
TENSIONS IN MID-SEPTEMBER AFFECTED 

MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS 
Financial market developments following 

the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in mid-
September triggered changes in the behaviour of 

the banking and money-holding sectors. Given 

the potential for the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial 
turmoil to have an impact on asset prices, wealth, 

Þ nancial institutions and con
Þ dence, the MFI 
balance sheet is likely to be affected in various 

ways with differing degrees of intensity and a 

variety of different time lags. For example, this 

intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial market tensions 
could trigger portfolio shifts both between 

monetary and non-monetary assets and between 

individual monetary instruments. Consequently, 

the overall impact is difÞ cult to anticipate. 
The data available up to December 2008 suggest 
that as the Þ nancial tensions became more acute, 
this led to signiÞ cant shifts between the various 
components of broad money. For example, 
ß ows into M1 increased substantially during 
September and October, reß ecting an increased 
preference for liquid assets in the presence of Þ nancial uncertainty (including uncertainty 
regarding the health of the banking sector), 
leading to a reversal of the overall downward 
trend of M1. However, the overall impact on 
headline M3 was relatively minor, particularly if 
one looks through the month-to-month volatility. 
Moreover, while banks had to resort to different 
funding mechanisms (as reß ected in their 
issuance and holdings of debt securities), there 
is little indication of a sharp break in the supply 
of bank loans after mid-September that would 
imply the drying-up of loans to the non-Þ nancial private sector, although monthly developments 
have moderated since then. However, the 
results of the Eurosystem™s bank lending survey 
point to the progressive tightening of the credit 
standards applied to loans.DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COMPONENTS OF M3 

WERE INFLUENCED MAINLY BY THE FLAT YIELD 

CURVEOn the components side, the annual growth rate 
of M1 continued to moderate up until the third 
quarter of 2008, standing at 0.2% in August, 
markedly below the rate of around 6% recorded 
in the fourth quarter of 2007. This moderation The large number of securitisation operations, especially in the second and third phases of the 
tensions, also had an impact on the dynamics of loans to the private sector (particularly loans to 
households), as the derecognition of securitised loans reduced net loan ß ows by up to •35 billion 
per month. Overall, this suggested a stronger decline in the availability of funding to the 
non-Þ nancial private sector than was actually the case. Despite the decreasing growth rate of 
loans to the private sector, their contribution to the changes in ß ows into and out of total MFI 
assets has typically been stable. The volatility observed in the ß ows of MFI assets was due mainly 
to assets other than originated loans to the private sector (see Chart D). However, this changed 
in the last two months of the year, when an outß ow was recorded from credit institutions™ assets, 
while in December loan ß ows to the private sector were negative even after correcting for the 
effect of securitisation operations. This might be explained by increased deleveraging at the end 
of the year in order to ﬁwindow dressﬂ balance sheets.Conclusions
The period of Þ nancial tensions has triggered considerable short-term movements in speci
Þ c sub-components of the broad money and credit aggregates. This has made the extraction of the policy-relevant underlying trends in monetary developments more challenging, but at the 
same time provided important insights as regards the conditions in the Þ nancial sector and the non-Þ nancial sector™s access to 
Þ nancing.31ECBAnnual Report
2008was driven mainly by developments in overnight deposits, for which a negative annual 
ß ow was observed in the third quarter. Overall, 
M1 growth in 2008 continued to be inß uenced mainly by the dampening effect resulting 
from the rising opportunity cost of holding 
M1 associated with the increases in interest rates as of December 2005. That effect was 
probably partially offset by the desire to hold 
M1 as a buffer in the context of the Þ nancial market turmoil. From mid-September onwards, 
however, holdings of M1 appeared to gain some 
momentum following the increase in Þ nancial tensions (see Box 2). Box 2DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EURO AREA MONEY MARKET IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FINANCIAL TURMOILThe Þ nancial turmoil that started in August 2007 continued into 2008 and intensi
Þ ed in the 
autumn of that year, posing considerable challenges as regards the functioning of the interbank 
money market and the Eurosystem™s liquidity management. This box describes the developments 
in the main segments of the euro area money market in 2008, relates developments to underlying 
factors in the global Þ nancial markets and explains the Eurosystem™s decisions on liquidity 
management in response to the tensions. The origins of the crisis 
In August 2007 the global Þ nancial system entered a period of considerable turbulence, 
triggered primarily by the impact that rising delinquency rates for US sub-prime mortgages had on the valuation of a broad class of mortgage-based securities. The complexity and opacity of 
the structured securities, together with the absence in many cases of a market price for these 
instruments, made these products difÞ cult to value, with adverse implications for the evaluation of banks™ overall balance sheets. More precisely, investors retreated from structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and conduits that were based on asset-backed securities derived from the securitisation of US sub-prime mortgages and became reluctant to hold or roll over asset-
backed commercial paper (ABCP) issued by these investment vehicles. As a consequence, 

banks faced the risk of having to reintermediate such SIVs onto their balance sheets and/or 

provide funding to SIVs and conduits issuing ABCP. As banks became increasingly concerned 

about their liquidity and balance sheets, they became less willing to provide funds to other 

banks. The complexity and opacity of many of these products increased banks™ reluctance 

to participate in interbank transactions, both because banks doubted the creditworthiness of 

their potential counterparties and because banks were uncertain about their own exposures 

(with regard to capital and liquidity) derived from conduits and SIVs. As a consequence, 

banks hoarded liquidity. Liquidity diminished in the interbank money market, impairing the 

functioning, in particular, of the longer-term unsecured deposit markets (owing to banks™ 

preoccupation with the possible risk exposures of their counterparties), non-government repo 

markets, commercial paper markets and foreign exchange swap markets.Although considerable progress has since been made in identifying and valuing exposures to the complex securities at the epicentre of the market turbulence, there is still uncertainty about the 
losses that will ultimately be suffered by investors and Þ nancial institutions across the globe. 
Money markets therefore remained under strain throughout 2007 and 2008.32ECBAnnual Report
2008The evolution of the crisis in 2008In reviewing developments in money markets in 2008, it is useful to divide the year into four broad periods: January to February; March to June; June to September; and September onwards. 
For each of these periods, the driving events, the market reactions and the measures adopted by 
the ECB are described.The period from January to February 2008
The Þ rst period covers the 
Þ rst two months of 2008, during which no major disruptive events occurred in the euro area money market. However, unsecured money markets remained volatile, with interest rates generally falling from the peaks observed at the end of 2007 as the 
end-of-year effects wore off (see Chart 9). Secured rates remained largely stable, given that the 
ECB™s monetary policy remained unchanged. As a consequence, the spread between the secured 
and unsecured money market rates broadly declined (see Chart 10). In 2008 the ECB continued to emphasise the separation it maintains between monetary policy decisions and the liquidity management necessary in order to ensure the smooth functioning of 
the markets. The ECB continued its policy of allocating liquidity in excess of the benchmark 
amount in its main reÞ nancing operations, while still aiming for balanced conditions at the end of 
maintenance periods. Moreover, the ECB increased the maturity of its operations by increasing 
the amounts allotted in longer-term reÞ nancing operations at the expense of main re
Þ nancing operations with a view to smoothing out 
conditions in the term money markets and 
conducted Þ ne-tuning operations at the end of 
maintenance periods in order to offset liquidity 
imbalances. Overall, the ECB made full use of 
the ß exibility provided by its implementation 
framework. The liquidity framework was kept 
unchanged until September. As a consequence, 
the EONIA remained fairly close to the 
minimum bid rate in the main reÞ nancing operations, although it was relatively volatile 
(see Chart A). The period from March to June 2008
The collapse in mid-March of Bear Stearns, one of the largest investment banks and 
securities trading and brokerage Þ rms in the 
United States, triggered a period of renewed 
market tension amid concerns about continuing 
bank losses, the deteriorating macroeconomic 
environment and rising oil prices. This lasted 
until approximately mid-June. During that 
period unsecured money market rates increased 
markedly, particularly longer-term rates. This 
development partly reß ected increased money Chart A ECB interest rates and the

2008market tensions, particularly for longer maturities, as well as increases in market expectations regarding the future path of key ECB interest rates, which were at the time more pronounced 
for the latter part of 2008 and thus had a greater impact on rates with longer maturities. Secured 
rates continued to be broadly stable, with the result that the spread between unsecured and 
secured rates was again determined mainly by the behaviour of unsecured rates. This period saw 
greater volatility in the EONIA and an increased need for liquidity provided by the Eurosystem, 
as suggested by the higher marginal rates in the main reÞ nancing operations. The continuation of 
the Eurosystem™s liquidity measures helped to address these needs to a large extent.The period from June to September 2008
The period between mid-June and mid-September 2008 was, overall, a period of stability in 
the markets. Further events related to Þ nancial stability in other major economies (such as the
 US government takeover of government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on 

7 September) did not trigger any agitation in money markets. Unsecured markets, albeit still 

strained, were more stable, while a slight increase tended to be observed in interest rates in the 

secured markets, in line with the Governing Council™s decision to increase the minimum bid rate 

in the main reÞ nancing operations to 4.25% on 3 July. As a consequence, the spread between 
unsecured and secured rates at the three-month horizon declined, but did not reach the low levels of 

January and February. The EONIA enjoyed a period of low volatility from July until the beginning 

of September, when tensions resurfaced prior to the events of mid-September. 
The period from September 2008 onwards
A more troubled period started in mid-September, strongly affecting the behaviour of money markets until the end of the year. There was a resurgence in tensions, which reached unprecedented 
levels in mid-September, when, in the space of a few days, the markets witnessed the selling-
off of Merrill Lynch and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (two of the four remaining global 
investment banks), the US government™s provision of emergency liquidity to AIG, the biggest 
US insurance company, and the seizing by federal regulators of Washington Mutual, the largest 
savings and loan association in the United States. In October spillover effects were felt more 
widely in the euro area, while money markets suffered further tensions as a result of a sharp 
slump in equity markets amid the deteriorating macroeconomic environment. Market tensions intensiÞ ed signi
Þ cantly and credit risk premia increased to levels above those 
seen previously during the period of Þ nancial turmoil. Unsecured market rates, especially for 
short maturities, rose sharply after the failure of Lehman Brothers as the effects of that default cascaded through the euro area banking system. The implied volatility derived from options on 
three-month EURIBOR futures, which experienced a prolonged period of decline from March 
to September, increased dramatically in mid-September and reached unprecedented levels in 
October (see Chart B). The Eurosystem acted quickly and decisively in response to the acute reintensiÞ cation of the turmoil. 
The Governing Council made a number of temporary changes to its liquidity implementation framework, aimed, in particular, at strengthening its intermediation function and reassuring the 
markets about liquidity risks. SpeciÞ cally, on 8 October the Eurosystem took the exceptional 
decision to temporarily conduct its main reÞ nancing operations as 
Þ xed rate tender procedures 
with full allotment at the main reÞ nancing rate and to reduce the corridor formed by the standing 
34ECBAnnual Report
2008facilities around the interest rate on the main reÞ nancing operations from 200 basis 
points to 100 basis points (a decision that was 
reversed on 18 December with effect from 
21 January 2009). Moreover, on 15 October 
the Eurosystem decided to provide enhanced 
longer-term reÞ nancing until the 
Þ rst quarter 
of 2009, as well as expanding its collateral 
framework. At the same time, governments 
across the euro area made coordinated efforts 
to support bank solvency. Consequently, as of October 2008 unsecured rates declined again, falling to levels lower 
than those observed earlier in the year. Those 
declines were supported by market expectations 
of further cuts in key ECB interest rates in the 
coming months. The implied volatility derived 
from options on three-month EURIBOR 
futures also tended to decline, albeit remaining 
much higher than the levels observed prior to 
September.A signiÞ cant and unprecedented increase was 
recorded in the spread between three-month 
secured and unsecured market rates in the weeks 

that followed Lehman Brothers™ bankruptcy. 

During that period secured and unsecured 

market rates moved in opposite directions, with 

secured rates dropping fast in anticipation of future cuts in key policy rates. That steep decline in 

secured rates continued from late October until the end of the year, in line with cuts in key ECB 

interest rates and market expectations of further rate cuts. The fact that declines were observed 

for both secured and unsecured market rates as of late October meant that the spread remained 

relatively large and volatile. 
Finally, looking at rates for very short maturities, the turmoil during the period from September to October dramatically increased banks™ demand for liquidity, as attested to by the signiÞ cant spread that developed between the marginal rate and the minimum bid rate in the main reÞ nancing operations. This led to the Eurosystem supplying generous amounts of liquidity, which tended 
to drive the EONIA below the interest rate in the main reÞ nancing operations. Before the 
introduction of the new framework, these declines were reversed at the end of every maintenance 
period. However, following the changes to the framework in mid-October and November, the 
EONIA tended to linger at levels below the Þ xed rate in the main re
Þ nancing operations, in line 
with the abundant liquidity provided to the markets.Overall, the euro area money markets were relatively volatile during 2008 and were confronted 
with considerable challenges. In particular, in the fourth quarter of the year the tensions in the 

Þ nancial markets intensi

2008In 2008 short-term deposits other than overnight 
deposits (i.e. M2-M1) remained the most 

dynamic component of M3. However, following 

sustained strengthening as of mid-2004, which 

continued Œ albeit more moderately Œ in the Þ rst 
half of 2008, the annual growth rate of short-term 

deposits other than overnight deposits declined 

in the second half of the year, falling to 13.3% 

in December 2008 (see Chart 5). These deposits™ 

contribution to annual M3 growth continued 

to increase in the course of 2008, reaching 

7.4 percentage points in the third quarter, partly 

offsetting the declines observed for the other 

components of M3. It lost momentum, though, 

in the fourth quarter of the year in line with the 

decline in the growth rate. However, this strong 

growth masks divergent developments across the 

various sub-components, as the ongoing strong 

inß ows for short-term time deposits (i.e. deposits 
with an agreed maturity of up to two years), 

which grew at an annual rate of around 40% in 

2008, were accompanied by a continued decline 

in the holdings of deposits redeemable at notice 

of up to three months, which fell by more than 

2% on average in the course of the year.Up until the fourth quarter of the year the remuneration of short-term time deposits 
broadly followed the rise in short-term 
money market interest rates. Thus, the spread 
vis-à-vis the remuneration of short-term 
savings deposits and overnight deposits 
widened, as the remuneration of these deposits 
generally increased more slowly and modestly (see Chart 6). This supported shifts within M3, 
namely from M1 and savings deposits into time 
deposits. At the same time, with a relatively 
ß at yield curve, short-term time deposits offer 
a rate of remuneration that is similar to that of 
longer-term assets. Since longer-term assets are 
less liquid and holding them typically implies 
somewhat greater risk, a ß at yield curve tends 
to increase the attractiveness of shifting funds 
into monetary assets from outside M3. The 
intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial tensions in the 
fourth quarter of the year further increased banking and Þ nancial system. At the same time, the macroeconomic conditions steadily worsened 
and signiÞ cantly burdened the already fragile 
Þ nancial markets. Consequently, the money market 
tensions in the fourth quarter of 2008 were much stronger and had a more lasting impact on money 

market rates. Nevertheless, the Eurosystem stepped up its efforts to ensure that market participants 

had access to liquidity, which Œ combined with government measures Œ helped to avoid any 

further deterioration in the banking sector. In this regard, throughout the year the ECB made full 

use of the ß exibility provided by its implementation framework and continued to emphasise in its 
communication the importance of separating monetary policy decisions from the implementation 

of liquidity policy in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the markets. The monetary policy 

stance was aimed at achieving the price stability objective, while liquidity management measures 

were aimed at supporting continuity and the smooth functioning of the money markets.Chart 5 Main components of M3(annual percentage changes; adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects) 04

2008the attractiveness of time deposits, with banks making additional efforts to attract such deposits 
at a time when it was difÞ cult to obtain funding in the wholesale money markets and with bank 
deposit guarantees being raised. Following sustained increases in 2007, the annual growth rate of marketable instruments 
(i.e. M3-M2) declined signiÞ cantly in the course 
of 2008, reaching a low of 1.7% in November, 
It then recovered slightly to stand at 3.0% in 
December, down from 20.0% in December 2007. 
Developments in these instruments resulted 
mainly from the marked declines recorded in 
the annual growth rates of money market fund 
shares/units and debt securities with a maturity 
of up to two years. As a result, marketable 
instruments™ contribution to the annual growth 
rate of M3 declined, standing at 0.6 percentage 
point in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared 
with 2.7 percentage points in the fourth quarter 
of 2007. THE GROWTH OF HOUSEHOLDS’ MONEY 

HOLDINGS REMAINED STRONG 
The broadest aggregation of M3 components 
for which reliable information is available 
by holding sector is short-term deposits and repurchase agreements (hereafter referred to 
as ﬁM3 depositsﬂ). The annual growth rate 
of households™ M3 deposits reached 8.8% in 
December 2008 (see Chart 7), thereby making 
the largest contribution to aggregate M3 deposit 
growth. Thus, the upward trend observed since 
mid-2004 in the growth rate of households™ M3 
deposits continued in 2008, despite showing 
signs of stabilisation in line with the weakening 
of economic activity. The continued robust 
growth of households™ M3 deposits Œ the 
sectoral component that captures the bulk of 
traditional bank deposits, those that are least 
affected by Þ nancial innovation Œ supports 
the view that underlying broad money growth 
remained strong at the end of 2008. By contrast, having levelled off in mid-2007 and declined somewhat in the second half of 
that year, the annual growth rate of M3 deposits 
held by non-Þ nancial corporations declined 
further in the course of 2008, standing at 0.3% 
in December, down from 11.3% at the end of 
2007. This may reß ect an ongoing marked 
deterioration in the cash ß ows of non-
Þ nancial corporations, given the cyclical nature of this 
sector™s money demand. It may also indicate 
that non-Þ nancial corporations are using their

2008cash ß ows to compensate for a reduction in 
loan growth. Similarly, the growth rate of M3 deposits held by OFIs showed a high 
degree of volatility in the course of the year 
and declined by more than 5 percentage points 
in 2008 to reach 17.5% on an annual basis in 
December. However, the annual growth rate 
of OFIs™ M3 deposits remained signiÞ cantly stronger than that observed in other sectors. 
This probably reß ected the fact that, given 
the current Þ nancial environment, investment 
funds needed to maintain cash buffers in order 
to accommodate possible redemptions. Those 
buffers may also have been bolstered by loans 
from parent MFIs. GROWTH IN CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR 

MODERATEDAfter strengthening in 2007, the annual growth 
rate of MFI credit to euro area residents 
declined in 2008, falling from 10.1% in 
December 2007 to 6.5% in December 2008 
(see Chart 8). This mainly reß ected a signi
Þ cant decline in the annual growth rate of credit to 
the private sector, while the annual growth 
rate of credit extended to general government 
turned positive. Three-month annualised growth 
rates, an indicator of short-term developments, 
declined more markedly, falling from 12.0% in 
December 2007 to 6.9% in September 2008 and 
3.9% in December 2008.In particular, MFI loans to general government increased somewhat, especially in the second 
half of the year, and while the amount of 
general government debt securities in MFIs™ 
portfolios declined at the beginning of the 
year, it increased strongly in the Þ nal quarter. 
It should also be mentioned in that regard that 
some volatility was observed towards the end of 
the year, with a decline recorded in September 
and October in the MFI sector™s holdings of 
government securities. That decline is linked to 
the deleveraging of credit institutions given the 
liquidity of government bond markets and the 
favourable nature of price developments. This 
decline can be seen as an indication that credit 
institutions have been using their more liquid 
assets as buffers in order to absorb the pressures on their capital positions and funding, with a 
view to shielding their core, relationship-based 
business, namely the granting of loans to Þ rms and households. By contrast, the November and 
December data indicate a substantial increase in 
the holdings of government debt securities.The annual growth rate of MFI credit to the private sector remained robust in early 2008, 
continuing the trend observed in 2007, before 
declining in the second half of the year. Loans  

to the private sector, despite decelerating 
markedly, remained the dominant form of 
credit granted by MFIs in 2008, although the 
contribution of MFIs™ purchases of securities 
other than shares increased moderately. That 
increased contribution largely reß ected MFIs™ 
purchases of securities issued by OFIs in the 
context of securitisation activities.The annual growth rate of MFI loans to the 
private sector, the largest component of credit to 

the private sector, declined to stand at 7.3% in the 

fourth quarter of 2008 and 5.8% in December,

2008after hovering around 11% at the start of the year. 
This decline was in line with the expected impact 

of the increases seen in bank lending rates as of 

late 2005, the ongoing slowdown in the housing 

market, the tightening observed in credit standards 

in the course of the year and developments in 

economic activity more generally. The three-
month annualised growth rate declined sharply 

in late 2008, falling from 6.8% in September to 

2.7% in December taking into account the effect 

of securitisation.The overall deceleration in lending to the private 
sector was broadly based across the various 

money-holding sectors, although the level of 

adjustment varied from sector to sector. The 

annual growth rate of loans to households showed 

a marked decline, continuing the trend observed 

in 2007, while the declines observed in the annual 

growth rates of loans to non-Þ nancial corporations 
and non-monetary Þ nancial intermediaries 
were slightly smaller. In fact, the momentum 

observed at the end of 2007 in loans to non-
Þ nancial corporations and non-monetary 
Þ nancial 
intermediaries continued in the Þ rst quarter of 
2008, with a decline in the annual growth rate 

of loans to non-Þ nancial corporations not being 
recorded until the second quarter of the year. 
The moderation observed in the annual growth rate of loans to households was driven mainly 
by the falling annual growth rate of loans for 
house purchase, which reß ected the ongoing 
moderation in the housing market dynamics 
of a number of euro area economies, as well 
as tightening Þ nancing conditions and the 
impact of past increases in interest rates and 
weakening economic prospects. At the same 
time, securitisation activity continued to distort 
loan growth to some extent. In fact, the impact 
that true-sale securitisation activities had on 
annual ß ows reduced the annual growth rate 
of MFI loans to the private sector by around 
1.7 percentage points in December (slightly 
above the average for the year). However, the 
nature of these securitisation activities differed 
from that observed prior to the onset of the 
market turmoil, as MFIs kept the securitised 
assets on their own balance sheets in order to submit them as collateral in Eurosystem 
operations. Nevertheless, even taking this 
adjustment into account, loan growth slowed 
substantially in the course of the year.The annual growth rate of MFI loans to non-Þ nancial corporations declined in 2008, 
although it remained strong in historical terms. 
Those corporations™ demand for loans remained 
robust in the Þ rst half of the year, although the 
Eurosystem™s bank lending survey pointed to 
a slight moderation. The annual growth rate of 
loans to non-Þ nancial corporations began to 
decline in the second half of 2008, but remained 
robust. Various factors may be supporting the 
ongoing dynamism of such loans. First, the 
fact that longer-maturity loans are the most 
resilient component may indicate that some 
frontloading of borrowing has been taking place 
in anticipation of a future deterioration in the 
availability of credit. Moreover, this may also 
reß ect a shift from debt securities to loans in 
MFIs™ Þ nancing of non-
Þ nancial corporations. 
The data for the fourth quarter of 2008 point to 
a further moderation in the short-term dynamics 
of loans to non-Þ nancial corporations, which 
is in line with the cyclical environment and 
the tighter Þ nancing conditions, although it is 
impossible to rule out the possibility of supply 
factors also having played a role. In conclusion, loan developments in 2008 
appeared to reß ect a robust yet declining 
ß ow of 
Þ nancing from banks to non-
Þ nancial 
corporations and households, with little 

evidence of these sectors™ access to bank 

loans being signiÞ cantly impaired, even after 
the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial tensions in 
mid-September. However, a signiÞ cant 
weakening of growth in corporate credit was 

observed at the end of the year. Furthermore, the 

results of the Eurosystem™s bank lending survey 

point to signiÞ cant tightening of credit standards.
Among the other counterparts of M3, the 
annual growth rate of MFI longer-term Þ nancial liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) 
held by the money-holding sector declined 
substantially, reaching 1.0% in the fourth 39ECBAnnual Report
2008quarter of 2008 and -0.1% in December, having stood at 8.5% at the end of 2007. Developments 
are especially relevant in the case of two 
sub-components, namely longer-term deposits 
and MFI debt securities. The reduction observed 
in the growth rate of holdings of longer-term 
deposits may reß ect a shift towards shorter 
maturities given the shape of the yield curve and 
the intensiÞ cation of 
Þ nancial tensions, while 
developments in long-term debt securities issued 
by MFIs point to the difÞ culty of obtaining 
funding through this source. The net external asset position of the MFI sector displayed two different trends in the course of 
2008. Sizeable capital outß ows were observed 
in the Þ rst half of the year, averaging more than 
•30 billion per month, followed by smaller 
inß ows in the second half. Those out
ß ows were probably driven to a large extent by 
non-euro area residents selling euro area assets 
(i.e. shifts out of euro area assets), while the 
inß ows re
ß ect the fact that external liabilities 
declined more strongly than external assets. 
As a result, the annual inß ows observed in 
MFIs™ net external asset position in the course 
of 2007 became annual outß ows at the start of 
2008. Those annual outß ows peaked at almost 
•300 billion in July, before decreasing thereafter. 
These continued outß ows probably re
ß ect the 
ongoing rebalancing of international portfolios, 
particularly in relation to the deterioration of 
economic prospects in the euro area and the need 
to obtain liquidity. The monetary presentation of 
the balance of payments reveals that the annual 
outß ows observed in MFIs™ net external asset 
position mainly reß ect a decline in net portfolio investment in equity.MONEY MARKET TENSIONS INTENSIFIED IN THE 

CONTEXT OF THE FINANCIAL MARKET TURMOILEuro money markets continued to exhibit 
severe tensions throughout 2008, following the 
onset of the global Þ nancial turmoil in August 
2007. Interbank trading volumes remained very 
modest, particularly at longer maturities, and 
the spreads between secured and unsecured 
money market rates remained very elevated by 
historical standards.Unsecured money market interest rates rose 
across the entire maturity spectrum between 
January and the beginning of October, before 
declining substantially thereafter. Having stood 
close to 4% in January 2008, the three-month 
EUREPO rate rose to a peak of around 4.35% 
at the end of July and the beginning of August.
It then stayed around that level until mid-
September, before declining to stand at around 
0.94% at the end of February 2009. This mainly 
reß ected developments in key ECB interest rates 
and market expectations regarding those rates 
(see Section 1 of this chapter). In addition to developments in policy rates, variations in both the intensity of the ongoing 
Þ nancial market tensions and the impact that 
those tensions had on credit and liquidity premia 
also played an important role in determining 
unsecured money market interest rates 
(see Box 2). More speciÞ cally, the three-month 
EURIBOR increased from a low of 4.29% on 
29 January to peak at 5.39% on 9 October. The 
increase was particularly steep in the aftermath 
of Lehman Brothers™ default in mid-September 
(see Chart 9). The three-month EURIBOR then 
fell to stand at 2.89% at the end of 2008 Œ a 
result not only of expectations of policy rate 
cuts, but also of Member States™ announcement 
of government packages to support Þ nancial institutions. At the end of February 2009 the 
three-month EURIBOR stood at 1.83%.The slope of the money market yield curve Œ as measured by the spread between the 
twelve-month and one-month EURIBOR rates Œ 
showed some volatility in the course of 2008, 
with that spread rising from a low of 12 basis 
points at the end of January 2008 to peak at 
97 basis points in June, before declining and 
stabilising at around 50 basis points at the end 
of February 2009. The spread between secured and unsecured money market rates was also very volatile in 
2008, remaining elevated by historical standards 
and exceeding the levels observed in the second 
half of 2007 in the initial phases of the Þ nancial turmoil. The spread between the three-month 40ECBAnnual Report

2008EURIBOR and EUREPO rates increased from around 40 basis points in mid-January 2008 to 
around 70 basis points in March following the 
takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase. 
It peaked at 184 basis points in early October, 
before declining to around 90 basis points at the 
end of February 2009 (see Chart 10).Implied volatilities derived from options on three-month EURIBOR futures contracts also 
ß uctuated signi
Þ cantly in 2008, re
ß ecting the 
volatility of money market conditions and the 
uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic 
outlook and thus the course of monetary policy. 
Driven by the high levels of uncertainty that 
followed Lehman Brothers™ default, this measure 
of interest rate volatility (i.e. the implied 
volatility derived from three-month EURIBOR 
futures contracts maturing in March 2009) 
peaked on 10 October. GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS DECREASED AMID 

HIGH VOLATILITY IN 2008In 2008 government bond markets in the euro 
area as well as in the rest of the world were 
characterised by large yield swings driven 
mainly by direct and indirect consequences 
of the intensiÞ ed Þ nancial crisis. Amid high 
day-to-day volatility, long-term government 
bond yields in the euro area and the United States 
declined markedly overall in 2008, reß ecting largely investors™ ongoing preference for highly 
liquid and safe securities, strong reductions 
in monetary policy rates, and eventually sharp 
downward revisions in the market™s outlook for 
economic activity and inß ation. The extraordinary 
uncertainty as to the eventual impacts of the 
Þ nancial crisis on the future state of the global 
economy and the consequent monetary policy 
reactions was reß ected in heightened levels of 
actual and expected bond market volatility, Chart 9 Unsecured money market

2008whereby investors™ uncertainty surged especially towards the end of the year in the context of 
intensiÞ ed Þ nancial strains after the bankruptcy 
of Lehman Brothers. Moreover, the spreads 
between the yields on long-term euro area 
government bonds and those on long-term 
German government bonds continued to widen 
in 2008, reß ecting differences in credit risk and 
liquidity premia (for further details, see Box 6). 
At the end of 2008 euro area and US ten-year 
government bond yields stood at around 3.6% 
and 2.2% respectively, which was 75 and 
184 basis points lower than the levels prevailing 
one year earlier (see Chart 11).The events related to the ongoing Þ nancial turmoil, its further escalation since September 2008, and its impacts on the real economy 
can, at least partly, explain the developments 
in major bond markets. Throughout 2008 the 
Þ nancial landscape underwent a dramatic 
reshaping amid a number of staggering events. 
As a consequence, governments both in the 
United States and in the euro area announced 
a number of measures aimed at supporting 
the Þ nancial system, strengthening consumer 
conÞ dence, sustaining economic activity and 
ensuring credit availability for households and 
corporations. In the United States, starting with 
the takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase 
in March, the investment bank stand-alone 
business model disappeared. The Þ nancial crisis escalated in late summer/autumn when, inter 
alia, the US government-sponsored enterprises 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken into 
public ownership, Lehman Brothers Þ led for 
bankruptcy, and the Federal Reserve extended 
an extraordinary loan to the insurance group 
AIG in exchange for an 80% stake. By the end 
of September severe Þ nancial distress had spread 
to the euro area as well, putting under strain 
several Þ nancial institutions. As a consequence, 
in the euro area, there were a number of 
interventions aimed at bringing relief to the 
banking system. As reported by the European 
Commission in relation to the declaration on a 
concerted European action plan of the euro area 
countries made at the 12 October summit, these interventions were meant ﬁto coordinate national 
efforts to prop up banks and protect depositors 
and to increase the ß ow of credit. Under the 
plan, national governments would buy into 
banks to boost their Þ nances and temporarily 
guarantee bank reÞ nancing to ease the credit 
crunchﬂ. Against this background and faced 
with the deterioration of the macroeconomic 
outlook, both the Federal Reserve and the ECB 
undertook a series of initiatives to enhance their 
liquidity facilities and to provide support to 
Þ nancial markets. In addition, the two central 
banks repeatedly reduced their policy rates, 
thereby affecting bond yields. In particular, on 
16 December 2008 the Federal Reserve™s actions 
culminated with a reduction in policy rates to a 
record low. The target for the federal funds rate 
was kept within a range, rather than at a point, 
between zero and 0.25%. Moreover, among 
other things, the Federal Reserve announced the 
possibility of purchasing longer-term Treasury 
securities, which might have also contributed to 
pushing down bond yields.Against this backdrop, until the beginning of spring 2008, on both sides of the Atlantic long-
term government bond yields continued on a 
declining trend that started in mid-2007, when Chart 11 Long-term government bond yields(percentages per annum; daily data)2.02.5

derived from euro area sovereign triple-A bonds.42ECBAnnual Report

2008concerns over the state of the US real estate market began to mount. This episode brought 
about a pronounced decline in risk appetite, which 
resulted in portfolio shifts from stocks and other 
risky assets to sovereign bonds and a consequent 
decrease in yields. Ten-year government bond 
yields increased between the spring and the end 
of the summer and declined sharply thereafter. 
While the increase in yields can be attributed to 
the perceptions of heightened global inß ation risks amid the strong upward pressure on 
commodity and food prices, their subsequent 
decline can be explained by ß ight-to-quality and ß ight-to-liquidity episodes on account of 
renewed concerns regarding the Þ nancial sector 
and more speciÞ cally the further escalation of 
the Þ nancial turmoil. Moreover, in the autumn 
incoming macroeconomic data pointing towards 
a marked slowdown in global growth and a 
change in the perception of inß ation risks, which 
were revised downwards, must have contributed 
to this decline in bond yields. Not surprisingly, 
in the United States, where the Þ nancial crisis 
became quite severe, the decline in bond yields 
was more pronounced than in the euro area. 
More generally, US government bonds were also 
viewed on average as being more liquid than euro 
area government bonds, which also contributed 
to a further decline in government bond yields in 
the United States.In the euro area, from the beginning of the year until approximately mid-September, real 
government bond yields hovered around 2%. 
Subsequently, until about end-October real 
yields increased. After reaching a peak of about 
3% in October, the Þ ve-year forward real yield 
Þ ve years ahead went down and, at the end of 
the year, stood just below 2%. While between 
September and October real yields increased 
owing to low liquidity and technical factors 
causing dislocations in the inß ation-linked bond 
market, the trend was subsequently reversed 
amid concerns over the macroeconomic 
outlook.During 2008 the evolution over time of the Þ ve-year forward break-even in
ß ation rate 
Þ ve years ahead, which measures market 
participants™ long-term inß ation expectations 
and the related risk premia, was also affected 
by developments in Þ nancial markets and the 
macroeconomic outlook. While this measure 
of market participants™ long-term inß ation expectations and the related risk premia in the 
euro area edged up and stood at around 2.5% 
until the summer, reß ecting mounting pressures 
in commodity and food prices, it declined 
signiÞ cantly in the autumn (see Chart 12). At 
the end of 2008 this rate stood at around 2%. 
Both moderating inß ation expectations in the 
context of the weakening economic outlook 
and technical factors distorting the relative 
pricing of conventional nominal bonds vis-à-vis 
the typically much less liquid inß ation-linked government bonds contributed to this decline. 
Hence, the interpretation of break-even inß ation rates as indicators of market participants™ 
inß ation expectations and related risk premia 
has been severely hampered by special market 
factors, in particular since the intensiÞ cation of 
the Þ nancial crisis in September.
Market participants™ perception of government 
bond uncertainty in the euro area and the United 
States, as measured by implied volatility, kept 
on increasing throughout the year, surging from Chart 12 Euro area zero coupon break-even

2008September onwards, amid the great unrest on global Þ nancial markets. At this time of the year, 
following the unravelling of a number of large 
actors in the Þ nancial system and the consequent 
ß ight to safety and to liquidity, bond market 
volatility reached particularly pronounced 
levels in the United States. However, by the end 
of September, when Þ nancial instability became 
more severe in Europe as well, bond market 
volatility rose also on this side of the Atlantic 
(for further details, see Box 3).In the Þ rst two months of 2009 euro area 
long-term government bond yields increased 
moderately by about 10 basis points, while 

the increase in US bond yields was more 

pronounced and equal to around 80 basis 
points. On 27 February euro area and US ten-
year government bond yields stood at around 

3.7% and 3.0% respectively. Developments 

in long-term bond yields on both sides of the 

Atlantic were inß uenced by the weakening 
economic outlook, heightened risk aversion and 

the associated ß ight-to-safety ß ows, as well as 
increasing concerns about the Þ nancing needs 
of sovereign issuers. While the Þ rst two factors 
would tend to push yields down, the third one, 

which apparently dominated the other two, 

especially for the United States, would tend to 

push yields up. Over the same period, in the 

euro area, yields on long-term inß ation-linked 
bonds increased as well, probably reß ecting 
continued strains in the inß ation-linked 
bond market. 
Box 3VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN EQUITY AND GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETS 
Stock and bond markets have become increasingly volatile in the course of the Þ nancial crisis, 
as can be seen from Chart A. 1 This high degree of market volatility stems from a combination of the unwinding of leveraged positions, the large number of information shocks impacting 
markets, great uncertainty and elevated levels of risk aversion among market participants. This 
heightened risk aversion is likely to have compounded the impact that the information shocks 
and the uncertainty have had on price developments, with the result that price ß uctuations have 
been larger than would have been the case given lower levels of risk aversion.For long periods during the crisis there has been a strong negative correlation between stock and bond returns (see Chart B). This negative correlation may be interpreted as evidence of 
safe-haven ß ows from stock markets to the most liquid segments of the government bond markets. 
Such a pronounced negative correlation was last observed around the time that the stock market 
bottomed out in 2003. During the Þ nal months of 2008 the negative correlation between these 
markets became less pronounced as the bond markets also became more volatile. This followed 
increasingly clear evidence of signiÞ cant spillovers from developments in 
Þ nancial markets to the 
real economy. In addition to the increased variability of inß ation expectations and risk premia, 
large revisions to market participants™ expectations regarding future developments in monetary 
policy rates are likely to have contributed to the increased volatility of long-term bond yields.The increased volatility in the government bond market has generally made market participants less inclined to provide continuous liquidity to each other by posting tradable quotes for large 
amounts in limit order markets. Although the most liquid government bonds, such as those issued 1 See the box entitled ﬁAbnormal volatility in global stock marketsﬂ in the November 2008 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.
44ECBAnnual Report

2008by the US and German governments, have acted as a safe haven for investors during the Þ nancial crisis, liquidity has been under pressure even for this asset class.2 Government bonds, unlike stocks, are largely traded outside exchanges, which inevitably means that the picture of trading activity in these markets is more fragmented. Available evidence from electronic platforms used 
for the trading of European government bonds points to sizeable declines in both volumes traded 
and depths quoted, even for the most liquid securities. Signs of deterioration in market liquidity 
are also evident in quoted bid-ask spreads, which have widened signiÞ cantly. As in previous 
episodes of liquidity stress, such as the 1998 turmoil, the deterioration of liquidity has been 
most severe for securities, which were already relatively illiquid before the onset of the Þ nancial crisis. For example, the yields of inß ation-linked bonds appear to have been strongly affected by 
liquidity premia in some markets. 3 According to market participants, larger trades in particular are increasingly being executed by 
inter-dealer brokers, with the result that the decline in trading volumes on electronic platforms is 
likely to overstate the decline in overall trading activity. However, the level of trading activity in 
the euro area government bond market can also be gauged from the futures market. Government 
bond futures are among the most heavily traded instruments in the world and represent one of the 
few markets where liquidity is relatively intact. When it comes to measuring market activity, a 
clear advantage of futures is that they are exchange-traded instruments for which data on overall 
activity are readily available. 2 See Box 6 for further analysis of the impact of 
ß ight-to-safety ß ows on euro area government bond markets.

2008Anecdotal evidence suggests that bond dealers have signiÞ cantly reduced the size of their balance 
sheets in response to the increased volatility in yields and the higher funding costs. Since futures contracts are very often used for the hedging of interest rate risk on dealers™ bond portfolios, the 
number of futures traded for this purpose may have declined. Chart C shows that the trading 
volume for futures contracts has indeed declined since the onset of the Þ nancial turmoil in 
mid-2007. In particular, the number of contracts traded for the most frequently used instrument, 
the ten-year government bond future, has declined by more than two-thirds in the United States 
and by more than half in Germany since mid-2007. Slightly smaller declines have been observed 
in the trading volumes for Þ ve-year government bond futures. 
Chart D shows that for stock markets, volumes Œ measured as the average number of stocks 
traded per month Œ have remained relatively resilient in both the euro area and the United States, 
despite declining somewhat at the beginning of 2009, particularly in the euro area. As noted 
above, the relatively robust trading volumes observed on stock markets may reß ect the many 
information shocks affecting markets. All other things being equal, market prices should adjust 
when new information becomes available. Thus, when information shocks hit markets with a 
greater frequency than normal, the frequency of trading will also increase. For stock markets, 
these information shocks can reß ect both revised expectations of future dividends and changes 
in the discount factor. By contrast, cash ß ows from standard government bonds are 
Þ xed in 
nominal terms, and so valuations respond only to changes in the discount factor.The considerable increase in macroeconomic uncertainty in the course of 2008, combined with market participants™ downsizing of balance sheets, has generated spikes in volatility and a severe 
deterioration in market liquidity in many Þ nancial market segments. This has even affected

2008STOCK PRICES DECREASED SHARPLY IN 2008 
The year 2008 was characterised by high volatility 
and sharp declines in stock prices around the 

world, amid a number of events that have 

reshaped the Þ nancial landscape, especially in 
the United States, as well as deteriorating global 

macroeconomic conditions. All in all, at the end 

of 2008 equity prices in the euro area, the United 

States and Japan, as measured by the Dow Jones 

EURO STOXX, the Standard & Poor™s 500, 

and the Nikkei 225 indices respectively, were 

lower by around 46%, 39% and 42% compared 

with the end of 2007 (see Chart 13). Stock price 

ß uctuations became particularly pronounced 
in March, and from September, reß ecting 
unrest in global Þ nancial markets. Moreover, 
declining actual and expected earnings growth 

on both sides of the Atlantic also contributed 

to the negative performance of stock markets. 

These price developments took place amid high 

volatility, which in October and November 

surged to exceptional levels.From the beginning of the year until mid-March 2008, equity prices in the euro area, the United 
States and Japan followed a declining trend. 
This trend was partly reversed when JPMorgan 
Chase took over Bear Stearns after receiving a 
loan in non-recourse Þ nancing from the Federal Reserve. The Bear Stearns rescue package was 
favourably perceived by market participants, 
who changed their risk perceptions, thereby 
contributing to sustaining equity markets. 
Against this background, from mid-March to 
the beginning of June the Dow Jones EURO 
STOXX increased by almost 10%, the Standard 
& Poor™s 500 by around 8.5%, and the Nikkei 
225 by 22.5%.However, during the summer stock prices declined signiÞ cantly on account of renewed 
concerns regarding the Þ nancial sector and the 
outlook for the world economy. Over this period pressure mounted on the US government-
sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac, as well as on bond insurers. 
Furthermore, in the Þ rst half of the summer 
commodity prices rose rapidly, darkening the 
world economic outlook. In September events 
in Þ nancial markets escalated further, when 
in the United States the aforementioned GSEs 
were taken into public ownership, the Federal 
Reserve together with the US Treasury arranged 
the rescue of the insurance group AIG, and the 
stand-alone investment bank business model 
ceased to exist after the bankruptcy of Lehman 
Brothers, the takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank 
of America, and the conversion of Goldman 
Sachs and Morgan Stanley into bank holding 
companies. Following these extraordinary events 
and in response to the spreading of the turmoil 
beyond the US Þ nancial system, government-

eventually moderate once the macroeconomic uncertainty has subsided and the period of 
deleveraging has run its course, leading to some normalisation of market liquidity.47ECBAnnual Report
2008sponsored rescue plans were initiated for a number of European Þ nancial institutions as 
well. On both sides of the Atlantic governments 
and public institutions alike undertook a 
number of measures aimed at stabilising the 
Þ nancial system. These measures included 
deposit guarantees to private account holders, 
bank recapitalisation measures and actions to 
strengthen bank liquidity. In addition, major 
central banks cut their policy rates amid the 
intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial turmoil and the 
deterioration of the macroeconomic outlook.The decline in stock markets was compounded by a decrease in actual and expected earnings 
growth on both sides of the Atlantic. Between 
December 2007 and December 2008, actual 
earnings growth, computed in terms of earnings 
per share of corporations listed in the Dow 
Jones EURO STOXX index, turned negative to 
around -16%. Similarly, earnings expectations 
were also sharply revised downwards. The 
forecast annual growth rate of earnings per 
share 12 months ahead fell from about 9% at 
the end of December 2007 to around 1.6% at 
the end of December 2008. The decrease in euro 
area corporations™ proÞ tability, together with 
negative news from macroeconomic indicators, 
have weighed negatively on stock market 
valuations.Against a background of continued unrest in Þ nancial markets and deteriorating 
macroeconomic conditions, stock markets were 
characterised by a high degree of uncertainty, 
as measured by the implied volatility extracted 
from stock options. Stock volatility was 
especially elevated during the major episodes 
shaking Þ nancial markets, i.e. in March and 
since September (see Chart 14). Against this 
backdrop, it is likely that equity risk premia have 
increased both in the euro area and the United 
States, thereby contributing to depressing stock 
market prices.From a sectoral perspective, in both the euro area and the United States stock prices in the 
Þ nancial industry suffered the heaviest losses 
between December 2007 and December 2008, declining by about 57% and 51% respectively. 
Stock prices in the non-Þ nancial sector also fell 
signiÞ cantly, decreasing by around 41% in the 
euro area and 36% in the United States.In early 2009 the deteriorating global economic outlook as well as renewed concerns about the 
health of the Þ nancial system pushed stock 
prices further down. Between the end of 2008 
and 27 February 2009, the Dow Jones EURO 
STOXX and the Standard & Poor™s 500 indices 
declined by around 17% and 19% respectively.HOUSEHOLD BORROWING MODERATED FURTHERThe dynamics of household borrowing continued 
to slow in the course of 2008, reß ecting the 
impact of factors such as tighter Þ nancing conditions, the weakening of economic prospects 
and the ongoing moderation of housing market 
dynamics. The annual growth rate of MFI loans to households, which were the main source of Chart 14 Implied stock market volatility(percentages per annum; Þ ve-day moving average of daily data)

2008household borrowing in 2008, declined to stand at 1.8% in December, down from 6.2% at 
the end of 2007. At the same time, the annual 
growth rate of loans to households by non-MFIs 
(i.e. OFIs, insurance corporations and pension 
funds) continued to exceed that of MFI loans to 
households, which stood at 10.4% in the third 
quarter of 2008. This partly reß ects the effect 
of true-sale securitisation activities, where 
loans are derecognised and thereby removed 
from MFI balance sheets, subsequently being 
recorded as loans from OFIs. A breakdown of MFI loans to households by purpose indicates that the main driver of 
that moderation was the declining growth 
rate of borrowing for house purchase. The 
annual growth rate of loans to households for 
house purchase was 1.7% in December 2008, 
having stood at 7.1% in December 2007 
(see Chart 15). This decline was consistent with 
the slowdowns observed in house price growth 
and housing market activity in a number of euro 
area economies. The results of the Eurosystem™s 
bank lending survey support this assessment, as 
in the course of 2008 banks identiÞ ed worsening 
housing market prospects and deteriorating 
consumer conÞ dence as the main factors 
contributing to the dampening of households™ 
demand for loans for house purchase. Moreover, 
the worsening housing market prospects were 
also partly responsible for the tightening of 
banks™ credit standards, which played an 
important role in the moderation of loan growth. The moderation of the annual growth rate of loans for house purchase also reß ected the 
dampening impact of the increases in key ECB 
interest rates as of December 2005. Continuing 
the trend observed in 2006 and 2007, although 
at a slower pace, MFI interest rates on loans for 
house purchase rose by 31 basis points between 
December 2007 and September/October 2008, 
before declining by 10 basis points in the fourth 
quarter (see  Chart 16). The increase observed 
in the Þ rst three quarters of the year was broadly 
based across the maturity spectrum, although 
it was slightly larger for loans with initial rate 
Þ xation periods of up to one year and between 
one and Þ ve years.

2008The annual growth rate of consumer credit also declined, falling to 1.5% in December 2008, 
around 4 percentage points lower than at the end 
of 2007. Over recent quarters the annual growth 
rate of consumer credit has declined in line with 
falling consumer conÞ dence and the gradual 
moderation in private consumption in the euro 
area. Moreover, the results of the Eurosystem™s 
bank lending survey indicate that credit 
standards applied to loans for consumption 
continued to tighten in 2008, in line with 
developments in the fourth quarter of 2007, 
owing to the worsening expectations regarding 
general economic activity and the deterioration 
observed in the creditworthiness of borrowers. 
MFI interest rates on consumer credit, which 
remained well above those on loans for house 
purchase in 2008, increased by 56 basis points 
between December 2007 and November 2008,  

thereby dampening demand for consumer credit. 
They then declined, with the rates observed in 
December 2008 standing 15 basis points above 
those of December 2007. HOUSEHOLD INDEBTEDNESS STABILISEDIn the second half of 2008 the protracted 
moderation observed in the growth rate of 
lending to households and the ongoing increase 
in disposable income led to a slight decline in 
the ratio of household debt to disposable income, 
which was estimated at around 92% in the 
fourth quarter (see Chart 17). The same pattern 
can be observed for the ratio of debt to GDP, 
which, according to data from the euro area 
integrated accounts, declined to around 60% in 
the fourth quarter of 2008. That being said, the 
level of indebtedness of euro area households is 
relatively modest compared with countries such 
as the United States or the United Kingdom. 
The moderation of euro area households™ 
indebtedness has helped to stabilise their 
exposure to changes in interest rates, income 
and asset prices. It is also worth mentioning 
that there is a large degree of heterogeneity in 
the indebtedness of households across the euro 
area. In particular, higher levels of risk apply to 
households in those parts of the euro area where 
the economic slowdown is more marked or there are still signs of overvaluation in housing 
markets. At the same time, although the level of household indebtedness stabilised in 2008, 
past increases in lending rates for households 
led to a further increase in households™ debt 
servicing burden, measured as interest payments 
plus principal repayments as a percentage of 
disposable income. Indeed, the interest payment 
burden is estimated to have reached 3.8% in the 
second half of 2008, up from 3.6% at the end 
of 2007. This also exceeds the previous peak 
observed in 2001.THE COST OF EXTERNAL FINANCING FOR 

NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS INCREASED 

CONSIDERABLY IN 2008 
In 2008, amid the Þ nancial market turmoil, 
the real cost of external Þ nancing for 
non-Þ nancial corporations in the euro area 
increased considerably compared with recent Chart 17 Household debt and interest 
payments(percentages)45556575859520011.52.02.53.03.54.0interest payment burden as a percentage of gross disposable income (right-hand scale)ratio of household debt to gross disposable income (left-hand scale)ratio of household debt to GDP (left-hand scale)2002200320042005200620072008

2008years. Although corporate proÞ tability remained 
resilient in the Þ rst part of 2008, it displayed 
signs of rapid deterioration in the remainder of the year, markedly so in the last quarter. 
Following a spike in the Þ rst quarter mainly 
due to the strong dynamics of MFI loans, the 
growth of external Þ nancing to non-
Þ nancial corporations moderated. However, the leverage 
of the non-Þ nancial corporate sector is expected 
to have increased further in 2008.Amid intensifying tensions in Þ nancial and 
credit markets, the overall real cost of external 
Þ nancing for euro area non-Þ nancial corporations 
rose sharply in 2008 (see Chart 18). In the 

last quarter of 2008 the evident deterioration 

in both macroeconomic conditions and the 

macroeconomic outlook contributed to a sharp 

increase in the cost of external corporate Þ nance 
as increased default expectations and downward 

earnings revisions weighed on investors™ appraisal 

of credit and market risk. Throughout the year 

the increase was mostly driven by a sharp rise 

in the real cost of market-based debt and equity 

Þ nancing. 
Turning to the components of the cost of external 
corporate Þ nancing, interest rates on MFI loans 
to non-Þ nancial corporations declined in real 
terms (see Chart 18) when compared with the 
end of 2007. The point-to-point comparison 
between year-ends conceals pronounced intra-
year dynamics. Nominal short-term interest 
rates broadly increased for most of the year, 
closely tracking the upward trend of the three-
month EURIBOR, although the effect was 
dampened in real terms by the pick-up in short-
term inß ation expectations until September. 
In November and December short-term rates 
declined considerably, reß ecting the cuts in 
policy rates and the decrease in money market 
rates. As a result, the nominal rates on loans 
with a ß oating rate and an initial rate 
Þ xation period of up to one year fell by 70 and 106 basis 
points on small and large loans respectively.Long-term MFI lending interest rates, after increasing up to September 2008, declined in the 
last quarter of the year, with the decline being more marked for large loans. Compared with 
the end of 2007, long-term MFI rates for small 
loans remained broadly unchanged, while those 
on large loans fell by 72 basis points. Yields 
on government bonds of comparable maturity 
also displayed a mixed trend over the year, 
Þ rst increasing and later decreasing sharply. 
Overall, yields on Þ ve-year government bonds 
were 85 basis points lower in December 2008 
compared with end-2007. As a result of these 
developments, the spreads between long-term 
bank lending rates and comparable market rates 
on average tended to widen during the second 
half of the year. The widening of the spreads 
came along with the soaring cost of capital 
market funding for banks. The real cost of market-based debt for non-Þ nancial corporations surged during 2008, 
reinforcing the upward trend that started at the Chart 18 Real cost of the external financing

2008end of 2007. By December 2008 this cost was 200 basis points above the level of the previous 
year and 420 basis points above the historical 
low reached in 2005. The level attained at the 
end of 2008 represents an all-time high since the 
start of EMU and was well above that recorded 
in 2000. By contrast, as mentioned above, yields 
on government bonds of comparable maturity 
declined. As a result, corporate bond spreads 
widened signiÞ cantly during the second half of 
2008. The increase in spreads also reß ects the 
tightening of credit standards and higher credit 
risk perceptions among investors.The real cost of quoted equity of non-Þ nancial 
corporations increased markedly during the year. 
An evident deterioration took place in the second 

half of 2008, when stock market prices (measured 

for instance by the Dow Jones EURO STOXX, 

a broad euro area index) plummeted and risk 

aversion reached exceptionally high levels. After 

showing noteworthy resilience in the Þ rst half 
of the year, earnings growth of listed enterprises 

also deteriorated sharply, turning negative by 

November on an annual basis.THE PACE OF EXTERNAL FINANCING BY NON-
FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS MODERATED 
Non-Þ nancial corporations™ external 
Þ nancing moderated progressively in the course of 2008. 
In the fourth quarter of 2008 the real annual 
growth rate of Þ nancing of non-
Þ nancial corporations was 2.7%, down from 4.9% in 
the fourth quarter of 2007 and 5.1% in the 
Þ rst quarter of 2008. This development was 
mainly driven by the slowdown, albeit from 
high levels, in the contribution of loans granted 
by MFIs, and, to a lesser extent, by the decline 
in the issuance of quoted equity, while the 
contribution of debt securities remained broadly 
stable (see Chart 19).According to aggregated Þ rm-level data from 
corporate Þ nancial statements of listed 
Þ rms, proÞ ts remained resilient during the 
Þ rst half 
of 2008 (see Chart 20). However, measures of corporate proÞ tability dropped considerably in 
the second half of 2008. In parallel, earnings 
expectations in the euro area were abruptly revised downwards in the last quarter of 2008. 
The number of downward revisions to earnings 
expectations for listed euro area Þ rms reached an 
unprecedented peak around the end of the year.The rate of growth in MFI loans to non-Þ nancial corporations slowed down in 2008. Following a peak in nominal terms of 15.0% in March 
2008, this rate of growth moderated to 9.4% 
in December. This still robust year-on-year 
growth rate somewhat conceals the underlying 
weakening dynamics of the growth of MFI 
loans to the corporate sector, through a carry-
over effect from strong growth in the Þ rst half 
of 2008. Indeed, as shown by short-term growth 
rates, an acceleration in the slowdown took place 
towards the end of the year, more markedly 
in December, as a result of the deterioration 
in Þ nancing conditions. The deceleration is 
broadly in line with the tightening of Þ nancing conditions reported in the Eurosystem™s bank 
lending surveys throughout the year, reduced 
merger and acquisition (M&A) activities and 
the moderation of economic activity. There 
might be a number of possible explanations Chart 19 Breakdown of the real annual

2008why MFI loan growth, while decelerating, continued to be relatively robust, at least up to 
November. Corporate developments in the euro 
area remained relatively resilient in the Þ rst part 
of 2008, thereby sustaining loan demand for 
Þ nancing activities. Another contributing factor 
may have been the drawing-down of credit 
facilities negotiated in more benign times. The 
demand for bank loans could have also been 
supported by a substitution effect stemming from 
hampered capital market funding, a reduction 
in internally generated funds and a contraction 
in trade credit. Furthermore, obstacles to the 
prompt adjustment of productive capacity and 
the implementation of cost-cutting programmes 
often inhibit corporate spending from adjusting 
in the short term. This may partly explain the 
resilience of credit demand in the second half of 
the year, despite weakening growth prospects. Growth in market-based Þ nancing (through both 
debt and equity) slowed down, in parallel to the surge in the cost of these sources of funding. The annual growth rate of debt securities issued 
by non-Þ nancial corporations declined from 
around 9.0% at the beginning of the year to 
6.6% in December 2008. The issuance of short-
term debt securities, which picked up after the 
onset of the Þ nancial turmoil in the summer 
of 2007, also progressively moderated. This 
pattern is conÞ rmed by short-term developments 
in seasonally adjusted data. Adding to the rise 
in corporate spreads, these developments may 
further reß ect the decline in M&A activity. The annual growth rate of quoted shares issued by 
non-Þ nancial corporations fell considerably 
throughout 2008, reaching zero in December. 
The negligible contribution of the net issuance 
of quoted shares to the net Þ nancing of the 
euro area corporate sector is attributable to the 
soaring real cost of equity and to highly volatile 
equity market conditions. The growth of external Þ nancing to non-
Þ nancial corporations, albeit moderating, may be related to a wider Þ nancing gap or net borrowing Œ

2008calculated as the balance between gross saving and gross capital formation (see Chart 21). The 
Þ nancing gap experienced by non-
Þ nancial corporations in the euro area in 2007 and up to 
the third quarter of 2008 resulted from decreases 
in corporate saving and, to a lesser extent, 
increases in real investment in relation to GDP. 
During the Þ rst part of 2008 falling corporate 
saving was mainly the result of rising interest 
payments. A FURTHER RISE IN CORPORATE DEBTWith regard to developments in the balance 

sheet position of non-Þ nancial corporations 
in the euro area, the protracted rise in debt 

Þ nancing led to a further increase in debt ratios 
(see Chart 22). In the fourth quarter of 2008 

the debt-to-GDP and debt-to-gross operating 

surplus ratios rose to 80.5% and 403% 

respectively. After a period of consolidation 

between 2002 and 2004, the debt ratios of 

non-Þ nancial corporations have continuously 
increased over the last four years. The ratio 

of debt to Þ nancial assets of non-
Þ nancial 
corporations edged upwards in most of 2008, 
interrupting the declining trend observed since 

the Þ rst quarter of 2003. The combination of 
higher debt and rising interest rates translated 

into a signiÞ cant increase in the net interest 
burdens of non-Þ nancial corporations in the 
course of 2008. 
2.3 PRICE AND COST DEVELOPMENTS
Overall HICP inß ation averaged 3.3% in 2008, 
which was a sharp increase by comparison 
with previous years Œ when annual inß ation rates clustered around 2.2% Œ and well above 
the ECB™s deÞ nition of price stability over 
the medium term (see Table 1). The increase 
for 2008 as a whole resulted from two sharply 
distinct patterns in HICP developments over the 
course of the year: starting from an already high 
level at the end of 2007 of 3.1%, annual inß ation rates grew further to reach a peak of 4.0% in 
June and July 2008, but receded thereafter, at a 
rapid pace in the last few months of the year, to 
stand at 1.6% in December.The sharply contrasting overall HICP inß ation developments in 2008 were dominated by patterns in global commodity prices (energy 
prices, as well as the prices of other commodities, 
including food) (see Chart 23). In the Þ rst part 
of the year, booming world demand continued 
to push up commodity prices, which reached 
extremely high levels, while the rapid slowdown 
in activity in the second part of the year, which 
developed into a pronounced contraction by the 
year-end, abruptly pushed them down again. 
Most prominently, oil prices continued to surge 
in the Þ rst half of 2008, following rapid increases 
in 2007, and reached a historical high in early 
July against the background of tight supply and 
demand conditions. During the second half of 
the year oil prices fell precipitously, ending at 
levels well below those seen at the beginning of 
the year. In a parallel development, processed 
food price inß ation, which began from already 
elevated levels at the end of 2007, increased 
sharply during the Þ rst part of the year as a result 
of a worldwide tightening in food commodity 
inventories, before receding rapidly towards Chart 22 Debt ratios of non-financial

2008the end of the year. By contrast, HICP inß ation excluding energy and food (processed and unprocessed) remained broadly stable (at 1.9% 
in 2008 as compared with 1.8% in 2007).Labour costs accelerated during the Þ rst half 
of 2008, with substantial upward pressure on unit labour costs in the context of a marked 
cyclical decline in labour productivity growth. 
This raised serious and growing concern about 
the risk of signiÞ cant second-round effects 
emerging in the euro area, which peaked around 
the middle of the year. These concerns receded 
in the autumn as the economy entered a phase of 
pronounced contraction. Accordingly, consumer inß ation perceptions and 
expectations, which had risen markedly during the Þ rst part of the year, reaching their highest 
levels since the introduction of the euro, started 
to moderate towards the end of the year.HICP INFLATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED 

BY ENERGY AND FOOD PRICE DEVELOPMENTSThe volatility in commodity prices was the 
main factor driving the pronounced movements 
in euro area HICP inß ation during 2008. The 
steady increase in the annual rate, to a peak of 
4.0% in June and July, followed unprecedented 
increases in energy, industrial and food Table 1 Price developments(annual percentage changes, unless otherwise indicated)2006200720082007200820082008200820082009

2008commodity prices (see Box 4). Conversely, the subsequent rapid decline in HICP inß ation, to 
1.6% by the end of the year, resulted from the 
strong decline in crude oil prices and reductions in the prices of a broad range of other global 
commodities, including food, plus a favourable 
base effect, in a context of rapidly deteriorating 
economic activity.Box 4COMMODITY PRICES AND HICP INFLATIONThe prices of a broad range of commodities 
rose sharply in the period between the start of 
2005 and July 2008 (see Chart A). They have 
declined rapidly since then, amid the marked 
deterioration in global economic activity. 
These developments Œ in particular those in oil 
and food prices Œ have had a major bearing on 
consumer prices in the euro area and largely 
explain the spike in overall HICP inß ation in 2008. This box reviews the effects of 
commodity prices on euro area inß ation.1Direct and indirect effectsCommodity price increases affect HICP inß ation directly through their immediate 
effect on the consumer prices of energy and 
food, which represent almost 30% of the 
overall HICP. They may also have an indirect effect on consumer prices through producer prices, 
as Þ rms facing higher input costs pass these cost increases on to sales prices in order to maintain or restore their proÞ t margins.
The extent to which cost increases are passed on to further stages of production and to consumers 
depends on several factors, including competitive pressures in the market and business cycle 
conditions. As cost shocks take time to work through the supply chain, indirect effects are 
generally thought to materialise with longer time lags and to last longer than direct effects.Turning to the data, most of the increase in headline HICP inß ation from August 2007 was due 
to the direct and indirect effects of the commodity price shock. In line with this, processed and unprocessed food and energy prices Œ the HICP components more directly exposed to the shock Œ 
rose substantially up to July 2008, whereas measures of inß ation excluding food and energy 
remained largely unchanged over the period (see Chart B).Indirect effects also appeared to emerge in other HICP components that use oil and raw food as 
a production input. For example, within the services component, the prices of transport-related 

services, package holidays and restaurants Œ which use oil and food as production inputs Œ rose

2008signiÞ cantly in 2008, as commodity prices spiked (see Chart C). However, these rises may also 
reß ect other factors in addition to the increases in oil and food prices, such as wage developments 
and the strength of consumer demand, in particular in the Þ rst half of the year.
Second-round effectsIn addition to direct and indirect effects, usually described as Þ rst-round effects, a commodity price
 shock also entails the risk of what are known as second-round effects, which may put further upward 
pressure on consumer prices. Second-round effects typically refer to the increase in consumer prices 

over and above Þ rst-round effects owing to the impact of the shock on wage bargaining and price-
setting behaviour. An increase in inß ation owing to the direct and indirect effects of a commodity 
price shock may lead to second-round effects if economic agents (in particular price and wage-setters) 

attempt to compensate for the loss of real income caused by past inß ation shocks. This may, in turn, 
affect inß ation expectations and further in
ß uence price and wage-setting behaviour. In this way, a 
transitory inß ation shock may become entrenched and thus more costly to eradicate.
The likelihood of a commodity price shock leading to second-round effects depends on several 

factors, including the cyclical position of the economy, the ß exibility of goods and labour markets 
(in particular the presence of automatic indexation mechanisms affecting wage bargaining and price-
setting processes), the formation mechanism of inß ation expectations and, most importantly, the 
credibility of the central bank.Inß ation expectations and labour cost developments may be used to monitor the risk of second-round effects. Inß ation expectations derived from surveys of professional forecasters rose 
somewhat between mid-2007 and mid-2008. Expectations implied by break-even inß ation rates derived from bond yields followed a clear upward trend over the same period, but, with the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial turmoil and the subsequent fall in oil prices, there has been a

2008The pronounced movement in the energy 
component of the HICP Œ which has a weight 

of 9.8% in the overall HICP Œ reß ected the 
abrupt changes in the prices of liquid fuel 

(such as petrol, diesel and heating fuel) driven 

by global oil prices, combined with the lagged 

response of non-oil energy components (such 

as electricity and gas) that tend to follow 

crude oil prices with a lag (see Chart 24). In 

June 2008 oil prices in euro were around 

63% higher than a year earlier. By December 

2008 they were 49% lower than a year earlier, 

having fallen by around 63% from their June 

2008 peak. This marked variation in the annual 

proÞ le was also ampli
Þ ed by a pronounced 
movement in reÞ ning margins. The year-on-
year change in HICP energy prices peaked at 

17.0% in July 2008, compared with 9.1% in 
December 2007, before retreating rapidly and 

even turning negative in December, when it 

stood at -3.6%.The annual growth rate of the processed food 
component of the euro area HICP followed a 

similar proÞ le to that of the energy component, 
rising considerably in the autumn of 2007 before 

declining strongly from the middle of 2008 

onwards. The annual rate of change in processed 

food prices reached a peak of 7.2% in July 2008, 

up from 2.0% in July 2007, before falling back 

to 3.6% in December 2008. Much of the spike 

in processed food prices and of the subsequent 

easing was related to components that are strongly 

affected by global agricultural commodity prices, 

such as bread and cereals, dairy products, and oils 

and fats. For the year as a whole, processed food 
subsequent reversal of this trend (see Chart D). 
Evidence from wage bargaining developments 
in the course of 2008 also points to strong 
wage growth in various euro area countries, 
although it is difÞ cult to pinpoint how much of 
the rise is attributable to second-round effects 
(more details on recent wage developments in 
the euro area can be found in Box 5).While the direct, ﬁmechanicalﬂ effects of 
a commodity price shock on consumer 

prices are unavoidable and indirect effects 

are, depending on the transmission of the 

shock through the price chain, possible, it 

is imperative that widespread inß ationary 
pressures related to second-round effects 

be avoided. The role of a monetary policy 

geared towards maintaining price stability 

over the medium term is to ensure that a 

commodity price shock does not affect 

longer-term inß ation expectations and trigger 
broader price pressures. Consequently, in a 

context of intensifying inß ationary pressures, 
the ECB decided to raise its key interest rates 

in July 2008 in order to stabilise inß ation 
expectations. However, interest rates were 

lowered later in the year, when it became clear 
that the inß ationary pressures would be signi
Þ cantly alleviated by the sharp fall in commodity 
prices and the economic downturn.Chart D Longer-term inflation expectations

2008price inß ation reached 6.1% on average in 2008, 
as compared with 2.8% in 2007. By contrast, 
unprocessed food prices rose by 3.5% in 2008 

compared with 3.0% in 2007.Excluding energy and food (processed and unprocessed), HICP inß ation was largely 
stable over 2008. The impact of notably higher 
input prices arising from high commodity 
prices (energy and non-energy) was offset by 
the dampening effect of lower import price 
pressures, in the context of an appreciation of 
the euro until the middle of the year and strong 
international competition, as well as by the 
favourable base effect relating to the fact that the 
3 percentage point increase in VAT introduced 
in Germany on 1 January 2007 started to drop 
out of the annual inß ation rates at the beginning 
of 2008.Non-energy industrial goods prices rose by 
0.8% in 2008, showing a slight deceleration 
compared with the rate of 1.0% recorded in 
2007. Despite the input cost pressures signalled 
by domestic producers and the high utilisation 
rate of manufacturing capacity, non-energy 
industrial goods price inß ation moderated in 
the Þ rst half of 2008. It rebounded somewhat 
from July, on account of, among other things, 
the impact of the abrupt appreciation of the 
US dollar observed in the second half of the year 
and of some exceptional seasonal discounting 
which affected textile prices in the summer.Services price inß ation was broadly stable 
throughout much of 2008, although remaining at relatively elevated levels of around 2.5%, 
following a marked increase in 2007. While 
the indirect impact of price increases in global 
commodities, especially oil and food, may have 
contributed to a persistent upward effect on 
some services components, such as transport 
services and restaurants and cafés, this was 
counterbalanced to a large extent by pronounced 
declines in other services components, such as 
communications.HIGHER AVERAGE PRODUCER PRICE INFLATION IN 

2008 BUT PRONOUNCED DOWNWARD PRESSURES 

TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEARSupply chain price pressures reached extremely 
elevated levels in late spring, against the 
background of the high commodity price 
inß ation, exacerbating concerns about in
ß ation. However, these pressures receded steadily in 
the course of the summer, and then at a more 
pronounced pace in the last few months of the 
year Œ with falls in index prices (excluding 
energy and construction) from October Œ as 
commodity prices started falling rapidly and 
pressures on factors of production (both capital 
and labour) abated. The annual rate of change in industrial producer prices (excluding construction) in the euro area 
was 6.2% on average in 2008, considerably 
higher than in 2007 (2.8%). After reaching a 
historical peak of 9.2% in July 2008, the year-
on-year rate of producer price inß ation declined

2008rapidly to 1.7% in December, mainly on account of energy and food price developments. The 
annual rate of change in energy producer prices 
reached a peak of 24.9% in July 2008, but had 
fallen back to 1.6% by December.Excluding construction and energy, the annual growth rate of industrial producer prices reached 
its 2008 peak of 4.4% in July, before declining 
to 1.6% in December. This marked move 
affected intermediate and consumer goods, 
although to varying degrees and at different 
times, but had less of an impact on capital goods 
(see Chart 25). Intermediate goods price inß ation accelerated 
during the Þ rst eight months of the year, peaking 
at 6.0% in August. In the Þ rst half of the year, 
intermediate goods prices were still affected by upward pressure from increasingly higher 
industrial raw materials and energy prices. 
During the second half of the year, the latter™s 
decline in world markets and the slowdown in 
activity dampened output price developments 
in many parts of the intermediate goods sector. 
By the end of the year, many output prices were 
falling in the context of a sharp contraction in 
activity. Movements in the annual growth rate of capital goods prices were delayed and more subdued, 
with a slight acceleration to 2.2% in September 
(reversing the downward trend observed in 
2007) which levelled off towards the end of the 
year as competition intensiÞ ed in the context of 
a rapid fall in demand.Further down the production chain, the sharp acceleration in consumer goods prices observed 
in the last few months of 2007 continued in the 
Þ rst half of 2008. The annual rate of change in 
overall consumer goods prices rose to 4.7% in 
March 2008, the highest rate since the beginning 
of Monetary Union in 1999, mainly driven by 
non-durable consumer goods prices, which 
reß ected global food price pressures. Excluding 
tobacco and food prices, the annual rate of 
change in consumer goods prices remained ß at throughout the year.Overall, by the end of the year, the general 
weakening in euro area demand had resulted 
in considerably more competitive market 
conditions at various stages of production. This 
more competitive environment, combined with 
falling world commodity prices, was reß ected in widespread reports of price falls (or price 
stabilisation), in input as well as output prices, 
for both manufacturing and services.LABOUR COSTS ACCELERATED MARKEDLYAvailable labour cost indicators for the euro area 
suggest a substantial acceleration around the end 
of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, following 
years of wage moderation. The average annual 
growth rate of compensation per employee in 
the Þ rst three quarters of the year was 3.3%, 
notably higher than the average annual growth 
rates recorded in the period 2005-07, which 
ranged from 1.8% to 2.5% (see Table 2). 
Hourly compensation provides a similar picture, 
although the Þ rst quarter was affected by the 
early timing of Easter in 2008, thus resulting in 
a spike in the series in that quarter. Negotiated 
wages also accelerated in the course of 2008 
from the band of between 2.1% and 2.3% within Chart 25 Breakdown of industrial producer

2008which they had ß uctuated in past years, rising 
to 2.9% in the Þ rst half of the year, 3.4% in the 
third quarter and 3.5% in the fourth quarter.The acceleration in wage growth in the Þ rst half of the year may have reß ected, aside from 
some differences in employment growth rates across wage levels, the prevailing tightness 
in the labour market and the direct or indirect 
impact of past HICP developments. Given the 
sizeable hike in global commodity prices, the 
very tight labour market conditions and the long 
lag required for movements in economic activity 
to have a decisive impact on labour costs, 
there was a signiÞ cant risk by mid-2008 that 
second-round effects, stemming in particular 
from the indexation of wages to high inß ation outcomes (even if temporary), might outweigh 
any possible dampening impact on wage costs 
stemming from the gradual slowdown in activity 
foreseen at that time. The rapid alleviation of global inß ation pressures, 
which saw headline HICP inß ation fall back 
below 2% by December 2008, and the sudden and 
stronger than expected contraction in euro area 

activity considerably weakened the risk of broad- 

based second-round effects materialising. Firms 

were expected to implement measures to contain 

labour costs in view of the uncertainty surrounding 

the euro area outlook, and the rapid deterioration 

in labour market conditions also contributed to the 

moderation of wage cost pressures. 
Sectoral data indicate some heterogeneous behaviour across sectors. Growth rates in all 
labour cost indicators were particularly high for the construction sector in 2008, perhaps 
reß ecting some composition effects, with lay-offs 
concentrated among lower-paid workers amid 
pronounced regional differences. Compensation 
per employee in the services sector also increased 
strongly, particularly with regard to non-market 
services (see Chart 26). By contrast, labour cost 
inß ation in the industrial sector increased only 
moderately on average and displayed a high 
degree of volatility in the course of 2008.Given the slowdown in activity and the expected adverse cyclical impact on labour productivity, 
unit labour costs accelerated rapidly, reducing 
business margins. Annual growth in labour Table 2 Labour cost indicators(annual percentage changes, unless otherwise indicated)200620072008

2008productivity slowed to 0.2% in the Þ rst three 
quarters of 2008 on average, even turning negative in the third quarter, compared with 
annual growth rates of around 1% on average in 
2006-07. Unit labour costs thus surged from an 
annual growth rate of 1.6% in the third quarter 
of 2007 to 3.6% by the third quarter of 2008. In 
the Þ rst three quarters of 2008, unit labour costs 
grew at an annual rate of 3.2%, compared with 
average growth rates of 1.7% and 0.9% in 2007 
and 2006 respectively. The rapid increase in unit 
labour costs compressed proÞ ts in the course 
of 2008, as companies were unable to pass on 
these higher costs in full. An indicator of overall 
proÞ t mark-up, measured as the difference in 
the rates of growth of the GDP deß ator and unit 
labour costs, points to a fall in proÞ t margins 
after several years of increases. Mark-ups 
fell on average by 0.9 percentage point in the 
Þ rst three quarters of 2008 compared with the 
corresponding period of the previous year, after 
increasing by 0.9 percentage point in 2007.RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICE INCREASES 

SLOWED DOWN FURTHER 
Residential property prices, which are not 
included in the measurement of the HICP, 
decelerated in the Þ rst half of 2008, continuing 
the slowing trend observed since the second half 
of 2005. According to the latest estimates, the 
annual growth rate of residential property prices 
for the euro area as a whole declined to 2.7% in 
the Þ rst half of 2008, from 3.9% in the second 
half of 2007 (see Chart 27). Country data conÞ rm that the gradual moderation in house price 
inß ation in the euro area was relatively broad-
based in the Þ rst half of 2008, notwithstanding a 
certain degree of heterogeneity across countries. 
House price increases slowed down signiÞ cantly in Belgium, Spain and France compared with the 
period 2006-07. House prices started falling in 
Ireland in the second half of 2007, and in Malta 
in the Þ rst half of 2008. However, in Italy, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and Austria, house price 
increases in the Þ rst half of 2008 were roughly 
comparable with those observed in 2007. In 
Germany, data showed small increases in house 
prices in 2008, following a period of subdued 
developments. DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION PERCEPTIONS AND 

EXPECTATIONSThe sharp rise in headline inß ation during the 
Þ rst half of 2008 increased the focus on in
ß ation perceptions and expectations for the assessment 
of future inß ation developments. The European 
Commission™s measure of consumers™ 
qualitative perceptions of inß ation over the 
previous 12 months continued to increase, by 
mid-2008 reaching levels far beyond those 
seen in the wake of the euro cash changeover in 
January 2002 (see Chart 28). By the end of the year, these perceptions had receded somewhat. Similarly, consumers™ 
inß ation expectations for the next 12 months 
tended to increase (expectations reported in 
the survey are to be judged by reference to 
the perceptions reported) in the early months 
of 2008 until the summer, before converging 
towards lower levels by the end of the year. 
However, the European Commission survey 
provides a measure of short-term expectations 
which is closely in line with observed inß ation. It does not gauge long-term expectations, 
which are more important for monetary policy-Chart 27 Residential property price

2008making. Information derived from professional forecasters indicates that survey-based long-
term inß ation expectations (
Þ ve years ahead) 
remained anchored around 2.0%, although there 
were, in the middle of the year, indications of 
some upward movements and increased risks. 
These were reversed later in the year, according 
to survey data from Consensus Economics, 
Euro Zone Barometer and the ECB Survey of 
Professional Forecasters. Break-even inß ation rates derived from inß ation-linked bonds and 
swaps in the euro area (using the implied one-
year forward break-even inß ation rate four years 
ahead) increased gradually to more than 2.5% by 
mid-2008, before receding in the autumn, falling 
to around 1.8% by the year-end. However, these 
market-based measures (in particular bond-
based measures) were distorted at the time by 
sudden movements in investors™ preferences 
and portfolio shifts. All in all, by mid-2008 a 
number of survey and market-based indicators 
pointed to a clear risk of inß ation expectations 
becoming unanchored, which required a clear 
but balanced signal on the part of the ECB, and 
by the end of the year, inß ation expectations had 
fallen back to more satisfactory levels.2.4 OUTPUT, DEMAND AND LABOUR MARKET 
DEVELOPMENTSSHARP SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITYReal GDP growth in the euro area slowed to 0.8% 

in 2008, following solid growth rates of 2.7% 

in 2007 and 3.0% in 2006 (see Table 3). While 

the year started on a relatively resilient note, 

there was a rapid deterioration in activity from 

the middle of the year in the face of weakening 

domestic demand and a pronounced slowdown in 

the world economy. The year ended with a sharp 

contraction in activity amid renewed Þ nancial 
turmoil and a virtually unprecedented downturn 

in global activity and demand. 
Quarterly growth rates were affected by certain technical factors. The strong GDP growth rate 
of 0.7% in the Þ rst quarter partly re
ß ected an 
unusually mild winter in many parts of Europe, 
which boosted construction and thus investment, 
and a positive contribution to growth from 
inventories at the start of the year. The unwinding 
of these factors contributed to the quarter-
on-quarter contraction in GDP of 0.2% in the 
second quarter of 2008. Notwithstanding these 
technical factors, the Þ rst half of 2008 taken as 
a whole pointed to a continuation of the mild 
slowdown in activity observed in the course of 
2007, with quarterly GDP trend growth slowing 
down from ½% to ¼%. Only half of the quarter-
on-quarter growth in the Þ rst part of the year 
arose from internal demand, amid particularly 
subdued consumption and weakening residential 
investment, while the other half resulted from 
net exports. However, external demand started to show signiÞ cant signs of contraction in the summer, 
as renewed weaknesses emerged in the US 
economy and activity in emerging markets Œ 
which had previously been perceived to 
be shielded from the effects of the global 
slowdown Œ decelerated (see Chart 29).Chart 28 Euro area consumers’ qualitative

2008From September 2008 the sudden and extraordinary intensiÞ cation and broadening of 
the Þ nancial turmoil and the ensuing heightened 
uncertainties led to a rapid contraction of euro 
area GDP (-1.5% quarter on quarter). Firms 
started to react forcefully to the rapid depletion 
of order books, postponing expansion plans and 
cutting inventories in the face of costlier and 
reduced access to Þ nancing, while households 
increased their savings in reaction to the 
increased uncertainty about short-term job 
prospects and to negative wealth effects.THE SLOWDOWN IN GDP GROWTH WAS 

BROAD-BASEDThe weakening in demand during 2008 was 

broadly based across GDP components. External 

demand slowed as activity in advanced economies 

decelerated and emerging markets became 

increasingly affected by the Þ nancial turmoil. 
Domestic demand also softened considerably. 

Rising commodity prices strongly affected 

households™ real income in the 
Þ rst half of the 
year, while cooling housing markets led to a 
rapid decline in residential investment. Waning 

capacity pressures, renewed uncertainty and 

tighter Þ nancing conditions led to cuts in corporate 
investment.Faced with subdued real income growth, falling Þ nancial wealth, tightening credit conditions and 
worsening labour market prospects, household 
spending moderated considerably in the course 
of the year, with private consumption growing 
by around 0.6% in 2008 as a whole Œ fully on 
account of the carry-over effect from 2007 on the 
yearly growth rate, as during 2008 consumption 
increased in only one quarter Œ compared with 
1.7% in 2007. Although nominal household 
income growth was reasonably robust during 
most of the year, owing to the solid growth in 
compensation of employees (resulting from the 
acceleration in compensation per employee and 
still resilient employment), the real disposable 
income of households came under signiÞ cant downward pressure from accelerating HICP 
inß ation. Large increases in commodity 
prices raised the cost of households™ typical Table 3 Composition of real GDP growth(percentage changes, unless otherwise indicated; seasonally adjusted)Annual rates 1)Quarterly rates 2)2006200720082007200820082008200820072008200820082008

2008consumption basket, and year-on-year growth in real household disposable income fell to its lowest 
rate since 2003 (to around 0.7% on average in the 
Þ rst three quarters of 2008). Households reacted cautiously, choosing to retrench spending rather 
than to smooth consumption and reduce savings.While the recent cycle has generally been 
characterised by relatively subdued household 

spending, the ongoing Þ nancial turmoil is 
likely to have been an additional factor behind 

households™ reluctance to spend. Large falls 

in Þ nancial wealth as stock markets slumped 
caused households Œ either because some of 

the losses were perceived to be permanent 

or because uncertainty about the economic 

outlook was heightened Œ to reduce expenditure 

and build up precautionary savings. The 

deteriorating outlook for the labour market also 

contributed to a decline in consumer sentiment. 

Consumer conÞ dence indicators, which had 
peaked in mid-2007, fell to their long-term 

average levels in the early months of 2008, 

sharply deteriorating further to reach very low 

levels by the end of the year (see Chart 30).Total investment growth declined sharply to 

around 0.6% in 2008 following two years of 

elevated growth (5.8% in 2006 and 4.2% in 

2007), with quarter-on-quarter contractions in 

the last three quarters offsetting the positive 

carry-over effects from 2007 and a strong Þ rst 
quarter that beneÞ ted from unusually good 
weather (with the latter mechanically depressing 

the Þ gures for the second quarter). This 
deceleration was more marked for residential 

investment than for other private investment.Indeed, housing investment contracted in 2008, following the end of the expansionary phase 
of the residential construction cycle in 2007 in 
the context of slowing house price growth. The 
deceleration was generally more pronounced in 
countries that had experienced very fast growth 
in previous years. The Eurosystem™s bank 
lending survey also indicated a considerable 
drop in demand for loans for house purchase 
since the start of the Þ nancial turmoil in 
summer 2007, reß ecting the downturn in the 
housing market. At the same time, there was a 
substantial tightening in credit conditions.Chart 30 Confidence indicators(percentage balances; seasonally adjusted)-40-35

65ECBAnnual Report
2008Corporate investment, which had expanded at a brisk pace in 2007, reß ecting strong pro
Þ tability and high capacity utilisation rates, also slowed 
markedly in 2008, contracting in the second 
half of the year after a dynamic Þ rst half. This 
reversal in corporate investment resulted to 
varying degrees from weakening demand and 
the ensuing waning capacity pressures, from 
reduced proÞ tability owing to the incomplete 
pass-through of the commodity price shock in 
the Þ rst part of the year and to the surge in unit 
labour costs over the course of the year, and 
from tighter lending standards.The tightening of Þ nancing conditions, 
which had been ongoing since the start of 
the Þ nancial turmoil, accelerated abruptly in 
September 2008, pushing the cost of market-
based Þ nance considerably higher, as well as 
the overall real cost of Þ nance (an aggregate 
measure combining the costs of market debt, 

equity and bank-based Þ nance). Nonetheless, 
the proportion of Þ rms citing 
Þ nancing as 
a factor limiting production remained low 

in 2008. This was largely due to the fact 

that the impact of tighter credit conditions 

tends to appear with a lag, because Þ rms 
can rely on previously committed credit 

lines, and that internally generated funds 

remained at a high level. In addition, the 

proportion of industrial Þ rms identifying a 
lack of equipment or space as a factor limiting 

production decreased sharply after peaking in 

the third quarter of 2007, while the utilisation 

rate of industrial capacity returned to its 

long-term average in October 2008. Firms 

also faced heightened uncertainty concerning 

the economic outlook, as evidenced by the 

exceptional volatility of Þ nancial markets, 
particularly in the last few months of 2008, 

and by the unusually wide dispersion of GDP 

forecasts in the ECB Survey of Professional 

Forecasters for the fourth quarter of 2008. 
Growth in euro area exports slowed down markedly in 2008, to an annual rate of around 
1.8%, compared with 6.0% in 2007, and turned 
negative over the last three quarters of the 
year. The external environment deteriorated signiÞ cantly in 2008, aggravated by the 
Þ nancial crisis, with growth slowing in advanced 
economies and emerging markets becoming 
increasingly affected. During the last few months 
of the year, various survey indices on industrial 
export orders or order books fell to historically 
low levels. Euro area imports also slowed in 
2008, reß ecting sluggish domestic demand. Net 
trade had a neutral impact on growth in 2008, 
following two years of positive contributions, 
with the strongly negative Þ gures in the second 
half of the year offsetting the positive Þ gures recorded in the Þ rst half and carry-over effects 
from 2007. From a sectoral perspective, the slowdown in activity was broadly based, although more 
marked in the industrial sector, which tends 
to display greater sensitivity to economic 
cycles. Manufacturing activity fell abruptly in 
the second half of the year, in particular with 
regard to capital goods, which suffered from 
weaker external demand, a rapid depletion of 
order backlogs and sharp cuts in activity in the 
car industry. Construction continued to be very 
weak, despite a temporary boost in the Þ rst quarter owing to good weather conditions, with 
a steady deterioration in the residential sector 
which was particularly severe in some countries. 
Although more resilient, services grew at their 
slowest pace since 2004, against the background 
of weak private consumption and slackening 
business activity.DECLINE IN THE LABOUR MARKETConditions in the euro area labour market 
worsened in 2008, after two years of substantial 
improvements. Over the previous few years, euro area labour markets had performed very positively, 
with strong increases in employment, rising 
participation levels and low unemployment rates, 
the latter reaching in early 2008 the lowest level 
since the 1980s (7.3%). Thus, by the end of 2007 
labour markets were particularly tight and wage 
pressures were beginning to rise. However, these 
trends were reversed in the course of 2008, with 
employment contracting in the second half of 66ECBAnnual Report
2008the year and the unemployment rate rising from the second quarter and accelerating towards the 
end of the year (see Box 5 for more details).Taking a sectoral perspective, employment in the construction sector was contracting at an 
annual rate of 2.7% by the third quarter of 2008, 
after having grown at a very strong rate of 3.9% 
in 2007 (see Table 4). Employment in industry 
excluding construction increased in the Þ rst half of the year, continuing an unusual pattern 
that began in 2007 after years of job losses, but 
reverted to its historical downward trend in the 
second half of the year. Employment growth 
in the services sector was relatively resilient, 
recording an annualised quarter-on-quarter rate 
of change of 1.6% in the Þ rst half of the year.
The average monthly increase in the number of 

unemployed persons during 2008 stood at around 

170,000. The unemployment rate was 8.1% in 

December 2008 (see Chart 31).Labour productivity growth, measured as GDP divided by total employment, slowed to almost 
zero in 2008 on average (with falls during the 
second half of the year), down from 1% in 2007. 
This sharp deceleration in labour productivity 
growth was mainly due to the business cycle. It is costly for Þ rms to recruit and dismiss staff, 
particularly those with permanent contracts, as 
this often involves large losses in Þ rm-speciÞ c human capital. Companies may thus initially 
retain staff at the beginning of a slowdown if 
they expect it to be mild or relatively short-lived, 
or if they wish to wait to assess its magnitude.Table 4 Labour market developments(percentage changes compared with the previous period; percentages)2005200620072006200620062007200720072007200820082008

2008Box 5LABOUR MARKET DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EURO AREA IN 2008 
After three years of buoyant employment growth and rapidly declining unemployment, euro area labour markets experienced a clear slowdown in 2008. Unemployment started to rise 
in the second quarter of the year, reaching 8.1% by the end of 2008, while the annual rate of 
employment growth slowed to 0.8% in the third quarter, more than 1 percentage point below the 
average rate for the previous year. This box examines the factors behind the downturn in euro 
area labour market developments.In general, developments in labour market variables tend to lag those in economic activity. Chart A shows employment growth clearly lagging economic growth. When a fall in demand 
Þ rst occurs, 
Þ rms do not know whether this fall is temporary or likely to be more persistent. 
They therefore tend to react by maintaining production and employment levels, leading to a 
build-up of inventories of unsold goods. If, over time, the fall in demand becomes more persistent, 
Þ rms need to stop the excessive accumulation of inventories and start reducing production. 
However, they still generally maintain employment levels. When employers are uncertain about 
the probable depth or duration of a downturn, they are likely to adjust labour input by varying 
working hours rather than the number of people employed. The reasons for this are clear: given 
the signiÞ cant costs involved in recruiting, training and dismissing staff, employers are reluctant 
simply to ﬁwrite offﬂ their investment in staff until they are convinced that a downturn in product 
markets is likely to persist. Consequently, Þ rms prefer to maintain employment levels and cut 
production via a reduction in capacity utilisation (e.g. a shortening of hours worked or a decline 
in output per worker). While it is not immediately apparent from recent quarterly data (owing 
to the distortionary effect of the early timing of Easter in 2008), some slowdown in the rate of 
growth of hours worked seems to have occurred in the course of 2008 (see Chart B). Averaging 
hours worked in the Þ rst half of 2007 and those worked in the 
Þ rst half of 2008 shows a sharp 
decline in the growth rate of total hours worked (down from around 1.7%, on an annualised 
basis, in the Þ rst half of 2007 to just over 1.2% in the 
Þ rst half of 2008; see the dotted line). 
Moreover, in 2008 working hours, rather than the level of employment, seem to have played an 
increasingly important role in determining developments in the growth of total hours worked in 
comparison with previous years. It is only when the fall in demand and the required cutback in production are expected to be persistent and large that a signiÞ cant reduction in employment levels is observed, as 
Þ rms seek to cut labour costs. A marked deterioration in labour demand is likely to hit Þ rst those 
categories of workers with more ß exible working conditions, such as temporary workers, who 
are less costly to lay off. There is now considerable empirical evidence that developments in 
temporary employment exhibit different patterns to those in permanent employment in periods 
of weakening activity and economic downturn.1 As is often the case in the early stages of an economic slowdown, in 2008 temporary employment growth declined more rapidly than 
permanent employment growth (see Chart C).1 See, for example, S. Bentolila and G. Saint-Paul, ﬁThe macroeconomic impact of 
ß exible labor contracts, with an application to Spainﬂ, 
European Economic Review, Vol. 36, 1992, pp. 1013-1047; B. Holmlund and D. Storrie, ﬁTemporary work in turbulent times: the Swedish experienceﬂ, Economic Journal, Vol. 112, June 2002, pp. F245-F269.68ECBAnnual Report
2008An increase in part-time work is also likely to be observed during a downturn, for a number of reasons. First, the weakening of economic activity may lead to changes in the structure of the 
economy, including a shift towards those sectors that are typically more reliant on part-time jobs. 
Second, employers may modify the hours worked in line with changes in output demand, to the 
extent that previously full-time positions are transformed into part-time jobs.2 Third, workers who would prefer to work full time may be forced to consider part-time work because they cannot 
Þ nd a full-time position. Finally, additional workers may enter the labour market as household 
members take up part-time jobs to compensate for the unemployment or under-employment 
of the main worker in the household.3 However, these cyclical effects are not always easy to identify in the data, since part-time employment growth has followed a clear long-term upward 
trend in the euro area, in large part owing to labour market reforms aimed at fostering increased 
labour force participation (see Chart D).Meanwhile, the potential supply of labour is likely to grow less rapidly as a result of an economic slowdown. It is a well-known phenomenon that some workers become discouraged from seeking 
work as they see the number of available jobs fall. The nature of the current slowdown may 
result in some reallocation of workers away from those sectors worst affected by the downturn 
(e.g. Þ nancial services, real estate and construction, as well as the car industry), while the 
resulting mismatch Œ as people take time to retrain and relocate Œ may result in a slowdown 
in labour supply. Looking ahead, cyclical downturns can have a negative long-term effect on 
labour supply growth through the atrophy of skills. This problem becomes particularly acute if 
individuals remain unemployed for a long period of time: the longer they remain unemployed, 2 For the most part, Eurostat™s Labour Force Survey distinguishes between full-time and part-time employment on the basis of 
respondents™ assessments.3 See, for example, H. Buddelmeyer et al., ﬁWhy do Europeans work part-time? A cross-country panel analysisﬂ,

20082.5 FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS
REVERSAL IN BUDGETARY POSITIONS IN 2008The relatively favourable Þ scal outcomes 
achieved in recent years were partly reversed 
in 2008 as the Þ nancial crisis unfolded and the 
macroeconomic environment deteriorated rapidly. 

According to the European Commission™s interim 

forecast of January 2009, the average general 

government balance in the euro area worsened 

from -0.6% of GDP in 2007 to -1.7% in 2008 
(see Table 5). The deÞ cit increase is accounted 
for by lower revenue, also owing to tax cuts, and 

higher primary expenditure, in the context of a 

slowdown in economic activity. The impact of 

government interventions to stabilise the Þ nancial 
system on the 2008 deÞ cit was negligible. 
In Ireland, Greece, Spain, France and Malta, the 

government deÞ cit rose above the 3% of GDP 
reference value in 2008, whereas in 2007 only 

Greece had a deÞ cit higher than 3% of GDP. The 
the more detached they become from the labour market. As it becomes increasingly difÞ cult for 
these people to Þ nd work, long-term unemployment is likely to increase.
Under such circumstances, labour market measures need to avoid a structural deterioration in 

unemployment levels and a reduction in long-term labour force participation. Such measures 

should include policies to support wage ß exibility and foster wage moderation, not least 
through the abolition or overhaul of wage indexation schemes. Such policies would reduce 

cost pressures on Þ rms, enhance competitiveness and support employment. Reforms which 
enhance the effectiveness and efÞ ciency of active labour market policies would make it easier 
for the unemployed to (re)train and Þ nd new jobs. With regard to those in employment, policies 
permitting greater ß exibility in 
Þ ne-tuning working hours could give 
Þ rms some leeway to 
reduce working hours without losing human capital through lay-offs. Labour market reforms 

must be implemented with a view to improving the resilience of the euro area economy to the 

crisis and creating a favourable environment for recovery and long-term economic growth and 

job creation.Chart C Breakdown of employment growth

20082007 Greek deÞ cit was revised upwards to 3.5% 
of GDP in Eurostat™s validation of the autumn 
2008 notiÞ cation, from 2.8% in the spring 2008 
notiÞ cation. The revision resulted from the 
correction of the recording of EU grants and 

the improved coverage of extra-budgetary, local 

government and social security funds. Comparing 

the 2008 Þ gures with the targets set in the stability 
programme updates released at the end of 2007 

and in early 2008, the euro area average balance 

fell short by 0.8 percentage point of GDP. 
As a result of the economic and Þ scal deterioration 
and the interventions by governments to stabilise 
the Þ nancial system, the average government 
debt ratio in the euro area rose from 66.1% of 

GDP in 2007 to 68.7% of GDP in 2008. The debt 

increase could end up being even more sizeable, 

depending on the statistical classiÞ cation of 
Þ nancial rescue operations by Eurostat, which 
has yet to be Þ nalised (see Box 7). In particular, 
government debt increased signiÞ cantly in 
countries which undertook sizeable interventions 

in Þ nancial institutions or which experienced a 
sharp macroeconomic slowdown. The annual 

growth rate of debt securities issued by euro 

area governments in 2008 increased noticeably 

compared with 2007, while sovereign spreads 

vis-à-vis Germany widened considerably for 

some countries (see Box 6).

2008Box 6DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ISSUANCE AND YIELD SPREADS OF EURO AREA GOVERNMENT DEBT 
SECURITIESThe annual growth rate of the outstanding 
amount of euro area general government debt 
securities stood at 8.0% in 2008. Although 
signiÞ cantly higher than the 2.8% recorded 
in 2007 (see Table A)1, it is comparable to the Þ gures recorded in previous periods of 
slowing economic growth. This growth in the 
net issuance of government debt securities, 
together with the sharp slowdown in GDP 
growth observed in 2008, was also reß ected in the deterioration in the government debt-to-
GDP ratio for the euro area, which rose from 
66.1% in 2007 to 68.7% in 2008.2 Looking at the composition of net issuance 
in 2008, the activity of the euro area 
short-term debt securities primary market was 
remarkably strong. This partly reß ects the fact that the yield curve became steeper during 
2008, making short-term Þ nancing relatively 
cheaper. This is a feature common to other 
episodes of slower economic growth with declining short-term interest rates. As a result, long-
term debt accounted for around 88.7% of outstanding debt securities in 2008, the lowest level 
since the start of Stage Three of EMU (see Table B).1 Growth rates are calculated on the basis of 
Þ nancial transactions and therefore exclude reclassi
Þ cations, revaluations, exchange rate 
variations and other changes that do not arise from transactions. For details, see the technical notes relating to Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of 
the ﬁEuro area statisticsﬂ section of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.2 As at January 2009 the potential direct impact of announced government support to the banking sector on euro area general gov
ernment debt was estimated at •284.6 billion (around 3% of euro area GDP).Table A Annual growth rates of debt securities issued by euro area governments(percentages; end of period)1999200020012002200320042005200620072008

2008Chart A breaks down changes in interest payments into: i) an effect stemming from changes in government debt, ii) an effect resulting from changes in interest rates and 
iii) a residual cross effect.3 Interest expenditure increased by around 0.2 percentage point of GDP in 2008. This was mostly a reß ection of the increase in the level of debt, whereas the impact of 
the decline in interest rates and cross effects was marginal.Following the developments triggered by the onset of the Þ nancial turmoil in August 2007, the 
spreads between the yields on long-term euro area government bonds and those on German bonds widened signiÞ cantly in 2008, particularly over the second half of the year. This is illustrated 
in Chart B, which shows the spreads against Germany for eight euro area countries (Belgium, 
Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal). The differences between 
government bond yields across euro area countries ultimately reß ect differences in credit risk 
and liquidity premia. First, in response to the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial turmoil in the second half of 2008, the 
summit of euro area countries in Paris on 12 October announced coordinated rescue packages, including guarantees for bank debt, capital injections for banks and outright purchases of banks™ 
risky assets. The expected Þ scal burden of such measures may have increased the perceived 
probability of defaults on sovereign bonds. Credit risk premia increased in all euro area countries, 
albeit to varying degrees, as illustrated in Chart C, which shows sovereign credit default swap 
spreads.4 Second, for most of 2008 the changes in euro area government bond yields also reß ected ß ight-to-quality behaviour on the part of investors. This process was also characterised by increased 
discrimination among investors with regard to their ß ight-to-quality destinations. German

2008According to the European Commission™s estimates, the average structural budget balance 
(the cyclically adjusted balance excluding one-
off and other temporary measures) in the euro 
area worsened in 2008 by 0.7 percentage point 
to -2.3% of GDP. The deterioration in structural 
balances amounted to more than half of the 
rise in the average government deÞ cit, which 
suggests that cyclical conditions (on average) 
had a more limited impact. Moreover, there was 
a favourable ﬁcomposition effectﬂ. The growth 
in tax-rich wages, salaries and (nominal) private 
consumption continued to support tax receipts 
in some countries, despite the overall worsening 
economic situation. However, it should be noted 
that structural balance estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty in the current situation 
and, in particular, may be revised at a later stage. 
Looking at individual countries, among the euro 
area countries, only Cyprus, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands and Finland met their medium-term 
budgetary objective, while Spain and Slovenia 
moved away from theirs.MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO THE FINANCIAL 

CRISIS AND ECONOMIC DOWNTURNIn October 2008 the euro area countries and 
the United Kingdom agreed on coordinated 
action to stabilise the Þ nancial sector, including the recapitalisation of Þ nancial institutions 
and guarantees for loans and deposits, which 
was subsequently approved by the European bonds are generally regarded as the most liquid of all the euro area government bonds, with the 
result that these attracted most of the ß ight-to-quality ß ows, partly explaining the widening of 
sovereign spreads vis-à-vis Germany even where countries were perceived as having an identical 
or even a better Þ scal outlook.

2008Council. The effects of these interventions on public Þ nances in the euro area are dif
Þ cult to assess (see also Box 7). As at 1 January 
2009 the potential direct impact of announced 
government support to the banking sector on 
euro area general government debt was estimated 
at •284.6 billion (around 3% of euro area GDP), 
and on government contingent liabilities at 
around 19%. The impact of these interventions 
on the euro area government deÞ cit in 2008 was 
estimated to be negligible. In response to the severe economic downturn, the European Council approved a European 
Economic Recovery Plan in its meeting on 
11 and 12 December 2008. According to this plan, 
individual EU Member States will contribute 
•170 billion to a total Þ scal stimulus of
•200 billion (1.5% of EU GDP), with the 
remainder coming from the EU budget and the 
European Investment Bank. This coordinated 
effort by the Member States is intended to 
support economic recovery by strengthening 
aggregate demand and increasing efforts to 
implement the structural reforms envisaged in the 
Lisbon strategy. Depending on national circum-
stances, measures can take the form of increased 
public spending, a reduction in tax burdens or 
social security contributions and aid to certain 
categories of enterprises or households. At the 
same time, the European Council conÞ rmed its 
full commitment to the implementation of the 
Stability and Growth Pact and to sustainable 
public Þ nances. Member States were called on 
to return as soon as possible to their medium-
term budgetary targets. Many euro area countries adopted Þ scal measures to stimulate aggregate demand. In the autumn of 2008, the German government 
adopted a package of measures, mostly on the 
revenue side of the budget, amounting to 1.3% 
of GDP in 2009 and 2010. At the beginning of 2009, the government announced a second 
stimulus package, accounting for about 2% of 
GDP and consisting of additional measures in 
the same two years. In France, measures worth 
some 1.5% of GDP were announced at the 
end of 2008 for the period 2009-11, including 
accelerated public investment and support for 
small businesses and speciÞ c industries. In 2008 
the Italian government adopted expansionary 
measures, mostly focusing on the expenditure 
side, amounting to half a percentage point 
of GDP for 2009 and 2010. Their impact 
on net borrowing is planned to be largely 
offset by compensating measures. In Spain, a 
number of revenue measures to stimulate the 
economy were taken in the Þ rst half of 2008, 
and additional public investment plans were 
announced in November, representing more 
than 3% of GDP in the period 2008-10. Most 
other countries also adopted sizeable Þ scal stimulus measures.While a deeper assessment of the stimulus policies will have to wait until the exact measures and their implementation are known, it is clear that 
current government intentions pose some risks 
(see also Box 8). Rising deÞ cits can undermine 
conÞ dence in 
Þ scal sustainability, especially 
since the reversibility of the stimulus measures 
is in many cases not addressed and may prove to 
be very difÞ cult. The sharp rise in government 
bond spreads vis-à-vis Germany is a warning 
sign that Þ nancial markets are watching the 
evolution of the potential risks very carefully. 
The effectiveness of the stimulus measures 
is sometimes doubtful, as a wide range of 
measures has been envisaged. Not all measures 
are clearly linked to the root of the current 
economic problems and some may reß ect political compromises rather than economic 
considerations. Government intervention also 
carries the risk of distorting the behaviour of 
economic agents. 75ECBAnnual Report
2008Box 7STATISTICAL ACCOUNTING CONSEQUENCES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS ON GOVERNMENT DEFICIT AND 
DEBTIn response to the global Þ nancial crisis and its consequences for European 
Þ nancial institutions, 
European governments, central banks and other public authorities are implementing measures to 
stabilise the Þ nancial markets and the economy in general. These government operations include 
(partial) nationalisations, capital injections (recapitalisations), the purchase and/or exchange of 
Þ nancial assets and the provision of guarantees (on deposits and new debt issuances by banks, as 
well as on interbank lending).The government deÞ cit and debt, which are the key 
Þ scal variables monitored under the Stability 
and Growth Pact, are recorded in accordance with the European statistical accounting rules known 
as the European System of Accounts 1995 (ﬁESA 95ﬂ) and the ESA 95 Manual on deÞ cit and debt. 
The European Commission (Eurostat) has further developed methodological guidance on recording 

the above-mentioned government operations, on the basis of the ESA 95 and the Manual, in order to 

ensure that the compilation of government deÞ cit and debt statistics is carried out consistently and 
homogeneously across Member States. In this process, Eurostat has consulted the Committee on 

Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics (in which the national statistical institutes 

and the national central banks of the EU Member States, as well as the European Commission and the 

ECB, are represented) to determine how the accounting rules should be applied. In each individual 

case a number of questions will need to be answered, to decide on the appropriate recording:Do the entities created to recapitalise Þ nancial institutions or provide guarantees to Þ nancial  Œ
institutions belong to the government sector in national accounts? If so, their deÞ cit and debt 
will augment the government deÞ cit and debt.
Have governments bought shares in Þ nancial institutions at market prices, which indicate 
 Œ
that a Þ nancial asset has been acquired (without an impact on the de
Þ cit), or should part of 
the amount injected into Þ nancial institutions be considered as a capital transfer (a subsidy)?
If the government lends money to a Þ nancial institution, does the 
Þ nancial institution have 
 Œ
an obligation to pay interest and to repay the loan? If not, it should be recorded as a capital 
transfer and not as a Þ nancial transaction.
If the government takes over part of a Þ nancial institution™s liabilities and obtains a stake in 
 Œ
the Þ nancial institution in return, is the stake worth the same as the liabilities? If not, (part 
of) the takeover of liabilities is considered a capital transfer with a negative impact on the 
government budget balance.
At what point are government guarantees very likely to be called, so that they may have an  Œ
impact on the deÞ cit and debt at the moment they are granted? Normally guarantees have an 
impact on the deÞ cit and debt only at the time when they are called.
If a Þ nancial institution is fully nationalised, should it be reclassi
Þ ed to the government 
 Œ
sector? As a general rule, it will become a public corporation, but not a governmental body. 
However, if a special unit is set up by government to acquire shares in a Þ nancial institution, 
this unit may need to be classiÞ ed within the government sector if it is not autonomous or if it 
is not deemed to be engaged in a market activity. Eurostat will publish the preliminary statistics on the government deÞ cit and debt of the EU 
Member States for 2008 in the second half of April 2009. 76ECBAnnual Report
2008FURTHER FISCAL DETERIORATION EXPECTED 
IN 2009 
The Þ scal outlook in euro area countries 
is set to deteriorate further in 2009. 

According to the interim forecast of the 

European Commission, which includes the 

available stability programme updates at the 

end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, the 

average general government deÞ cit in the euro 
area is expected to increase by 2.3 percentage 

points to 4.0% of GDP (see Chart 32). 

Government expenditure is set to increase by 

2.1 percentage points of GDP, and revenues 

to decrease by 0.1 percentage point of GDP. 

The average government debt ratio in the 

euro area is expected to increase in 2009, by 

4.0 percentage points, to 72.7% of GDP.In all euro area countries except Malta, the 
general government balance is expected to 

decline, according to the Commission™s interim 

forecast. Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, 

Portugal and Slovenia are expected to breach 

or remain above the 3% of GDP reference 

value in 2009, in some cases by a wide margin. 

DeÞ cits in Belgium and Austria are expected to 
be at the 3% reference value and in Germany 

and Slovakia to be just below it. There are 
clear risks that actual outcomes could be even 

worse than expected.FOCUS ON FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY ESSENTIALThe reversal in Þ scal outcomes and the 
highly uncertain outlook pose considerable 

challenges to Þ scal policy in the euro area. 
Public Þ nances are coming under pressure 
from four developments. First, deÞ cits are 
rising signiÞ cantly as a result of the operation 
of automatic stabilisers in the macroeconomic 

slowdown. Second, on top of the unwinding of 

revenue windfalls of recent years, additional 

revenue shortfalls may materialise owing to, 

among other factors, sharp falls in Þ nancial 
asset prices, as well as a housing slump 

in some countries. Third, the government 

interventions in the Þ nancial sector to prevent a 
systemic banking crisis and much more severe 

macroeconomic disruption carry substantial 

Þ scal risks. Fourth, stimulus measures to 
counter the economic slowdown put the Þ scal 
outlook under pressure. 
In this challenging environment, it is crucial 
that Þ scal discipline and a medium-term 
perspective are maintained. A precondition 

for maintaining the public™s trust in the 

sustainability of public Þ nances is to safeguard 
the integrity of the rules-based EU Þ scal 
framework. It is therefore essential that all 

parties involved adhere to their commitment 

to fully apply the provisions of the Stability 

and Growth Pact, which provide the necessary 

ß exibility to deal with adverse economic 
circumstances. 
The substantial stimulus packages adopted in 
2008 and early 2009 add to Þ scal imbalances in 
the euro area. To prevent a loss of conÞ dence in 
the sustainability of public Þ nances, a credible 
commitment to undo stimulus measures as soon 

as possible is required. In the implementation 

of the stimulus packages, careful consideration 

should be given to the quality of the measures 

to ensure their effectiveness. Determined 

efforts in euro area countries to achieve 

and maintain sound public Þ nances are also

2008warranted because of the need to cope with the 
expenditure pressure resulting from an ageing 

population in the decades ahead. A binding 

medium-term Þ scal framework at the national 
level, if properly designed and rigorously 
implemented, can complement the European 

Þ scal framework enshrined in the Stability and 
Growth Pact in assisting a quick return to the 

medium-term budgetary objectives (see also 

Box 8). 
Box 8THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND FISCAL POLICYA key policy challenge is to prevent the Þ nancial crisis and the subsequent economic downturn from 
undermining the credibility and sustainability of public Þ nances. In the EU, the Stability and Growth 
Pact provides the appropriate framework for the conduct and coordination of Þ scal policies, in good 
as well as bad times. While compliance with the Pact in the initial ten years was somewhat uneven, 

the EU™s overall Þ scal performance in terms of avoiding high budget de
Þ cits and the build-up of 
government debt was much better than in the decades preceding the Pact. 1A missed opportunity making the Þ scal challenge unnecessarily onerous
Many euro area countries entered the Þ nancial crisis and the economic downturn with weak 
Þ scal positions. Governments had not used the opportunity presented by past years™ revenue 
windfalls to consolidate their budgets. In this regard, the arguments set out in the ECB™s Annual 
Report 2007 still hold and, indeed, their relevance is now magniÞ ed. 2 At the time, the ECB emphasised an important Þ scal lesson to be learnt from the period 2000-01, namely that the 
revenue outlook can change dramatically in a short period of time. Indeed, experience shows that 
the volatility of government revenues is greater than that of the spending side and also exceeds 
that of the business cycle. Taken together with the difÞ culty of predicting turning points for 
GDP growth, this presents a strong reason to increase caution in good times, i.e. to use revenue 
windfalls for faster deÞ cit and debt reduction rather than for extra spending. 
3 This would allow countries to create budgetary room for manoeuvre to absorb revenue shortfalls and deal with 
extra spending should conditions change. One of the Þ scal policy errors prior to and during 
2000-01 was to mistakenly interpret budgetary improvements in good times as evidence of 
structural improvements, which were often used to motivate spending increases or tax cuts.The role of automatic stabilisersThe Þ scal adjustment in response to the economic downturn re
ß ects to a large extent the operation of 
automatic Þ scal stabilisers, which contribute to smoothing economic 
ß uctuations. This is appropriate, 
since this type of Þ scal reaction is timely and shielded from political economy risks that can undermine 
the effectiveness of discretionary Þ scal measures. In particular, automatic stabilisers are not subject 
to time lags in the identiÞ cation of measures or in the political decision-making and implemenation 
processes. Moreover, the automatic reaction of revenues and, to a lesser extent, expenditures to the 

cycle makes automatic stabilisers self-reversing. Finally, the impact of particular interest groups in

20082.6 EXCHANGE RATES AND BALANCE OF 
PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS 
THE EURO APPRECIATED MODERATELY IN 2008 IN 
EFFECTIVE TERMSThe Þ nancial turmoil in money and 
credit markets which started in August 2007 
and its ensuing spillovers into the real 
economy worldwide signiÞ cantly in
ß uenced 
developments in 
foreign exchange markets in 2008. More precisely, the Þ rst four months of 
2008 saw the euro continue its strengthening 
trend established in late 2000, supported by 
fairly upbeat market expectations about the 
relative economic prospects of the euro area. 
After reaching a historical peak in April, the 
nominal EER broadly stabilised until August. 
Thereafter the euro experienced a sharp 
depreciation which, in just three months, brought 
it to the level prevailing around mid-2007. The achieving group-speciÞ c bene
Þ ts is low. Countries in the euro area that comply with the Stability and 
Growth Pact can take advantage of their relatively large automatic stabilisers.The risks of Þ scal activism in times of 
Þ nancial crisisRegarding the use of discretionary Þ scal policy measures to stimulate demand, a consensus has
 emerged that such measures should be timely and targeted to ensure effectiveness, and temporary to 
avoid additional risks for Þ scal sustainability. In particular, unless a reversal of de
Þ cit-increasing Þ scal 
measures is expected, such measures may undermine public conÞ dence in the sustainability of public 
Þ nances and lead to higher precautionary savings or negative 
Þ nancial market reactions and higher 
interest rates Œ thus counteracting the intended expansionary effect. In this regard, the experience of 

Þ scal activism during the oil crisis of the 1970s stands out as a warning: instead of boosting demand, 
it ultimately contributed towards destabilising the real economy and increasing inß ationary pressures 
and government debt Œ with little, if any, net gain.Regarding targeting, actions should be taken where elasticities are the highest and where the distortions to incentives are the least onerous. In this regard, consideration should be given to 
the quality of the Þ scal stimulus so that action can be taken that is most conducive to a sound 
foundation for recovery and long-term growth. Timeliness is essential, since past experience 
shows that discretionary policy measures frequently end up being pro-cyclical, because they 
become effective only after a considerable time lag.The quality of Þ scal policy is important in many ways. While the issue of the optimal size of 
government is a matter for debate, 4 the citizens of euro area countries could be at least as well off as they are today, but pay less in taxes, if the quality of public spending were better. Moreover, there is some evidence that past increases in government size have come at the cost of lower 
economic growth. 5 If euro area governments comply with the Stability and Growth Pact, their economies are more likely to reap long-term beneÞ ts and their citizens to enjoy greater welfare. 
64 There is evidence to suggest that, in many industrialised countries, governments have grown in size beyond what is warranted to attain 
core objectives. See, for example, A. Afonso, L. Schuknecht and V. Tanzi, ﬁPublic sector efÞ ciency: an international comparisonﬂ, 
Public Choice, Vol. 123 (No 3-4), 2005, pp. 321-347, and A. Afonso and D. Furceri, ﬁGovernment size, composition, volatility and economic growthﬂ, Working Paper Series, No 849, ECB, 2008.5 See A. Afonso, W. Ebert, L. Schuknecht and M. Thöne, ﬁQuality of public 
Þ nances and growthﬂ, 
Working Paper Series, No 438, ECB, 2005.6 The costs of downsizing governments may be rather limited if appropriately designed and implemented; see for example S. Haupt
meier, M. Heipertz and L. Schuknecht, ﬁExpenditure reform in industrialised countries: a case study approachﬂ, Working Paper Series, No 364, ECB, 2006.79ECBAnnual Report
2008sharp depreciation of the euro was associated primarily with a revision of market expectations 
about the euro area economic outlook Œ as the 
Þ nancial crisis continued to unfold and its global 
reach gradually began to be realised Œ and took 
place within an environment of heightened 
market uncertainty and global risk aversion. 
Towards the end of the year, the euro rebounded 
strongly, reaching another historical peak on 
18 December 2008. By the end of 2008 the 
euro was, in nominal effective terms, about 
2.5% higher than at the beginning of the year 
and about 7% above the average level in 2007. 
Much of the nominal effective appreciation 
of the euro in 2008 can be accounted for by 
its sizeable strengthening against the pound 
sterling, which was only partly counterbalanced 
by the euro™s weakening against the US dollar 
and the Japanese yen.Against the US dollar, the euro underwent a 
strong appreciation in the Þ rst eight months of 
the year, peaking in mid-July at USD 1.60. This 

appreciation was driven largely by expectations 

of a widening interest rate differential in favour 

of euro area assets, reß ecting market beliefs 
that the euro area was going to be affected by 

the ongoing Þ nancial turmoil to a signi
Þ cantly 
lesser extent than the United States. From that 

period on, however, data releases began to show 

that the Þ nancial turmoil that originated in the 
sub-prime US mortgage market in August 2007 

was unfolding into a synchronous economic 

slowdown across all main economic areas. As a 

result, the euro began to depreciate sharply against 

the US currency in August. In the course of the 

autumn, renewed strains in global money and 

credit markets intensiÞ ed the downward pressure 
on the euro, with the single currency reaching 

USD 1.25 in October. This sizeable depreciation 

was associated partly with a worldwide dollar 

liquidity shortage which commanded a sizeable 

repatriation of foreign investments and concerted 

central bank policy actions. In this environment of 

extremely heightened risk aversion and Þ nancial 
deleveraging, the US dollar found support in its 

international status. Other technical, and possibly 

transitory, factors in foreign exchange markets 

also appear to have lent support to the US dollar, 
as can also be deduced from the weakening of 

the link between interest rate differentials and 

movements in the EUR/USD exchange rate 

during this period. In December, however, the 

euro experienced a strong rebound as the strength 

of the above-mentioned non-cyclical factors that 

supported the dollar in the autumn waned and 

foreign exchange markets refocused attention on 

the growth outlook and interest rate differentials 

across major economic areas. On 31 December 

the euro was trading at USD 1.39, i.e. about 5% 

weaker than at the beginning of 2008 and about 

6% stronger than its 2007 average. 
Following a similar pattern to the EUR/USD exchange rate, the euro also ß uctuated widely 
against the Japanese yen in the course of 2008, 
trading within an unusually wide range of 
JPY 115.75 and JPY 169.75. The volatility 
in the EUR/JPY exchange rate seems to have 
reß ected not only a changing market assessment of relative economic prospects, but most 
importantly market expectations relating to asset 
price volatility. As a consequence, the latter had 
an impact on the expected proÞ tability of carry 
trades, i.e. trades that consist of borrowing in 
a low-yielding currency (such as the yen) and 
investing in a high-yielding currency. In general, 
an increase in the expected volatility of the yen 
reduces its attractiveness as a funding currency 
for carry trades, tending to put upward pressure 
on the yen and downward pressure on high-
yielding currencies. Indeed, implied volatility 
in the EUR/JPY exchange rate Œ as measured 
through indicators based on option prices Œ saw 
wide gyrations in the course of 2008, peaking 
in October and subsiding thereafter. These 
extremely volatile conditions in the foreign 
exchange market accounted mostly for the initial 
appreciation and subsequent sharp depreciation 
of the euro against the yen in 2008. On 
31 December 2008 the euro traded at JPY 126.14, 
i.e. 23% weaker than at the beginning of the year 
and about 22% lower than its 2007 average.The euro also continued to appreciate against the pound sterling in 2008, strengthening by 
a sizeable 28.5% by the end of the year, after 
the 9% appreciation witnessed in 2007. On 80ECBAnnual Report
200829 December the euro traded at GBP 0.98, the highest level since the launch of the single 
currency in 1999. The noticeable weakening 
of the pound, particularly in the last months 
of 2008, relates to the signiÞ cant slowdown in 
economic activity in the United Kingdom, which 
triggered a sizeable easing of monetary policy 
conditions and an associated fall in longer-term 
yields.The euro appreciated signiÞ cantly against 
the currencies of several EU trading partner 
economies between early January and 

31 December, for example by 15.3% against 

the Swedish krona, 15.3% against the Polish 

zloty, 12.3% against the Romanian leu, 5.3% 

against the Hungarian forint and 1.9% against 

the Czech koruna. A sizeable strengthening 

was also witnessed vis-à-vis the Korean won 

(33.6%), the Norwegian krone (22.1%) and 

the Australian and Canadian dollars (21.0% 

and 17.1% respectively). The appreciation 

of the euro against these currencies was 

counterbalanced partly by its weakening 

against the currencies of several Asian 

partners whose currencies are linked to the US 

dollar, namely the Chinese renminbi (11.4%) 

and the Singapore and Hong Kong dollars 
(5.2% and 6% respectively). The euro also lost 

ground against the Swiss franc (10.2%) amid 

positioning in and out of carry trades, given 

that the Swiss franc, like the Japanese yen, 

played the role of funding currency in this form 

of Þ nancial transaction.
The real EER, based on different cost and price 
measures, appreciated in the Þ rst four months 
of 2008 and then stabilised until August. 
After declining until November it rebounded 
somewhat in the last month of 2008. In the last 
quarter of 2008 the real EER of the euro, based 
on consumer prices, was 2% below its average 
value in 2007 and 4% below its average level in 
the corresponding quarter of 2007.CURRENT ACCOUNT SHIFTED INTO DEFICIT IN 2008In 2008 the current account of the euro area 
recorded a deÞ cit of •63.2 billion (or 0.7% of 
euro area GDP), compared with a surplus of 
•36.3 billion in 2007. This resulted largely 
from the goods balance shifting into deÞ cit. In 2008 the goods balance recorded a deÞ cit of •0.6 billion, compared with a surplus of 
•56.6 billion in 2007. The weakening of 
exports, particularly in the second half of the 
year, together with a robust increase in import Chart 34 Euro area export volumes to

2008prices in the Þ rst eight months of the year, 
were the main factors behind this development. The higher deÞ cit in current transfers and 
the shift into deÞ cit of the income component 
also contributed to the overall deterioration 
in the current account balance. At the same 
time the surplus in services, which stood at 
•50.6 billion in 2008, decreased only marginally 
(by •2.6 billion) compared with the previous 
year (see Chart 33).The contraction of goods exports in the course 
of 2008 can be largely explained by the fall in 

global demand and possibly by a deterioration 

in trade Þ nancing conditions worldwide. After 
a temporary rebound in the Þ rst quarter of the 
year, euro area exports to the United States and 
other OECD countries, as well as to China and 

the rest of Asia, contracted, while exports to the 

EU Member States that have joined the EU since 

2004 also weakened. By contrast, the growth in 

exports to OPEC countries remained robust over 

the entire year, amid strong economic growth 

in these countries and wealth effects from oil 

revenues (see Chart 34).The decline in euro area price and cost 
competitiveness observed since 2001 was partly 

reversed after mid-2008 owing to the depreciation 

of the euro. The moderation in the growth of 

euro area export prices in the Þ rst half of the year 
may indicate that euro area Þ rms adjusted their

Box 9RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN EURO AREA 

COMPETITIVENESS 
An assessment of the international price 
and cost competitiveness of the euro area Œ 
which also reß ects the competitiveness of the 
individual euro area countries Œ can provide 
important information for monitoring the 
euro area economy. This box therefore looks 
at developments in euro area competitiveness 
as measured by various real EERs, both at the 
aggregate and individual Member State levels. 
In summary, these indicators show a decline in 
the euro area™s price and cost competitiveness 
over the past decade, owing largely to the 
nominal appreciation of the exchange rate of 
the euro over the same period. Although this 
result holds true irrespective of the deß ators used, there is considerable heterogeneity in 
competitiveness developments across the 
individual euro area countries. Looking at the euro area as a whole, 
Chart A compares the evolution of the nominal EER of the euro and a range drawn from Þ ve 
real EER indices based on different deß ators. 1 Overall, the various measures reveal a decrease 
1 The Þ ve de
ß ators are the CPI, producer prices, GDP, unit labour costs in manufacturing and unit labour costs in the total economy.

2008in competitiveness of around 5-10% between 
1999 and 2008, according to both real and 

nominal EERs. Thus, there is a high degree of 

co-movement between nominal and real EERs, 

reß ecting similarities in price developments in 
the euro area and its trading partners. The overall 

decline in competitiveness for the euro area is 

therefore explained primarily by movements in 

the nominal exchange rate, which can be split 

into several episodes. The Þ rst episode saw an 
increase in competitiveness between 1999 and 

2001, reß ecting the depreciation of the euro 
around this time. This was followed by decreases 

in competitiveness driven primarily by the 

appreciation of the euro in the period 2002-04 

and again from 2006. More recently, the euro 

area has registered a rise in competitiveness 

owing to the depreciation of the euro during the 

second half of 2008. 
The evolution of price competitiveness for the 
euro area as a whole can mask quite different 

developments across the individual countries. 

For an analysis of the latter, the ECB employs 

a consistent methodology by compiling for 

each euro area country a set of harmonised 

competitiveness indicators against the other 

euro area countries and a set of extra-euro area 

trading partners. 2 There are three harmonised 
competitiveness indicators that are calculated 

as a weighted average of bilateral exchange 

rates based on trade weights Œ which reß ect the 
relative importance of the individual country™s 

major competitors Œ deß ated by either the 
CPI, GDP or unit labour cost deß ator. Among 
these harmonised competitiveness indicators, 

the CPI-based indicator seems to be the most 

widely used, partly because of the relatively 

homogeneous deÞ nition of the CPI across 
countries, as well as the absence of signiÞ cant 
data revisions and the relatively short delay 

in availability. Meanwhile, the GDP deß ators 
and unit labour cost-based indicators provide 

alternative measures of competitiveness 
2 For a more detailed analysis of the harmonised competitiveness indicators, see F. di Mauro and K. Forster, ﬁGlobalisation and the 
competitiveness of the euro areaﬂ, Occasional Paper Series, No 97, ECB, September 2008, and the article entitled ﬁMonitoring labour cost developments across euro area countriesﬂ in the November 2008 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.Chart B Changes in harmonised competitiveness

2008focused more on the production rather than the 
consumption side of the economy. 
Various caveats should be borne in mind 
when interpreting these indicators. Index-
based competitiveness indicators do not 

account for differences in initial price levels, 

hence it is not possible to draw conclusions 

as to which country is more competitive in 

absolute terms. Conclusions based on such 

indicators are also sensitive to the choice 

of the start and end point of the period 

considered. Furthermore, the harmonised 

competitiveness indicators capture only 

limited aspects of competitiveness. In order 

to obtain a broader picture, other factors, such 

as trade specialisation or the general business 

environment, as well as the degree of pricing 

to market and the responsiveness of trade 

prices to changes in the exchange rate, could 

be considered in a more detailed analysis. 3 Moreover, at the current juncture, the 

methodology used for these indicators does 

not fully recognise cross-country differences 

in the productivity of the services sector. 

(The trade patterns of this sector are not 

reß ected in the weighting of trading partners.)
Turning to past movements in the harmonised competitiveness indicators, Chart B reveals 
considerable heterogeneity in competitiveness developments across the euro area countries. 
Using the CPI-based harmonised competitiveness indicator, Ireland has recorded the strongest 
declines in competitiveness since 1999 (above 20%), followed by Cyprus, Malta, Luxembourg 
and Spain (10-20%). Austria, Germany, Finland and France show the smallest declines or even 
slight improvements in competitiveness over the same period. Focusing on the period of the 
most recent appreciation of the euro, i.e. since the beginning of 2006, the differences appear to 
be less pronounced, with all countries recording decreases in price competitiveness. While the 
magnitude of competitiveness developments across the countries is sometimes sensitive to the 

choice of deß ator, the qualitative conclusions remain the same across the different measures. 
The harmonised competitiveness indicators also make it possible to distinguish between 
developments in intra-euro area and extra-euro area competitiveness at the country level. This is a useful distinction, as movements in the nominal exchange rate since the launch of 

the euro remain important only for external competitiveness. Hence, price competitiveness 

between the euro area countries is inß uenced only through differing developments in costs 
and prices. In general, declines in price competitiveness at the country level are more

2008Volumes of imported goods decreased in 2008, 
particularly those of intermediate goods. At the 

same time, import prices increased robustly up 

to the third quarter of 2008 and moderated in the 

last quarter of the year. As price developments 

more than offset the decline in the volume 

of imports, overall import values increased 

noticeably over the Þ rst three quarters of the 
year. Price data by category of goods suggest 

that the steady increase in import prices up to 
the summer and the subsequent deceleration 

were driven largely by developments in oil and 

non-energy commodity prices (see Chart 35). 

Nevertheless, despite the fall in oil prices 

from the summer onwards, in the 12-month 

cumulated period up to November 2008, the 

oil trade deÞ cit stood at •223.6 billion, well 
above the already high level of more than 

•170 billion registered at the end of 2007. 
NET INFLOWS IN COMBINED DIRECT AND 

PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT INCREASED IN 2008In the Þ nancial account, the euro area experienced 
net inß ows of •128.5 billion in combined direct and portfolio investment in 2008, compared with 
net inß ows of •47.3 billion a year earlier. This 
increase reß ected a rise in net in
ß ows of debt 
instruments and equity portfolio investment. 
The above developments were offset partly by 
an increase in net outß ows in direct investment 
(see Chart 36). In 2008 the Þ nancial turmoil led to heightened 
volatility in all segments of the Þ nancial markets 
and, given the Þ nancial spillovers to the real side 
of the economy, to a high degree of uncertainty over the global outlook. In this context, global 
portfolio allocation decisions were inß uenced by the ensuing drain of liquidity in key market pronounced with respect to extra-euro area trade partners, as shown by the regression 

line which captures the relationship between the intra- and extra-euro area indicators 

(see Chart C). This largely reß ects the overall nominal appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro 
between 1999 and 2008. Accordingly, countries such as Ireland, which have a relatively large share 

of trade with partners outside the euro area, also exhibit a relatively larger decline in extra-euro 

area competitiveness. However, for most countries, the high correlation between intra- and extra-
euro area competitiveness also suggests that the relative competitive positions of the individual euro area countries are determined mainly by the evolution of domestic costs and prices. Overall, Austria is the only country which improved its competitiveness both inside and outside the euro 

area. Finland, France and Germany also recorded increases in their intra-euro area competitiveness, 

but registered declines vis-à-vis their extra-euro area trade partners. The remaining euro area 

countries recorded decreases in competitiveness both inside and outside the euro area. 
In summary, according to various measures of real EERs, the euro area has experienced a decline in price and cost competitiveness over the past ten years or so, owing largely to the nominal 
appreciation of the euro. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in competitiveness 
developments among the euro area countries, reß ecting mostly differences in the evolution of 
their domestic costs and prices, as well as the geographical specialisation of their foreign trade. Chart 35 Extra-euro area import prices(indices: Q1 2003 = 100; seasonally adjusted; three-month moving average)80100120140160

2008segments and, in turn, affected euro area cross-border portfolio investment ß ows. Speci
Þ cally, the equity market witnessed unusually high net 
sales of both euro area Þ nancial instruments 
by global investors and foreign equities by 
euro area investors. Global investors seemed 
to reduce their foreign investments, possibly 
reß ecting more cautious investment strategies 
and the global fall in equity prices. Also in the wake of the Þ nancial turmoil, both 
foreign direct investment ß ows into the euro 
area and euro area investment ß ows abroad fell 
substantially in 2008, indicating a preference for 
home markets. Disinvestments by non-residents 

in the euro area were larger than euro area 

disinvestments abroad, leading to overall higher 

net outß ows of direct investment for the euro area. 
Finally, higher net inß ows of debt securities, 
amounting to •345.6 billion, compared with 
•122.8 billion in 2007, contributed to the 
increase in net inß ows in the 
Þ nancial account. 
Increased risk aversion, heightened liquidity 
needs and short-term interest rate differentials 
might have contributed to this development. In 
particular, money market instruments recorded strong net inß ows, reaching in September and 
October 2008 their highest levels since 1999. 
These developments possibly reß ect attempts 
to boost liquidity amid the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial turmoil.
INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION IN 2008Data on the international investment position 

(i.i.p.) of the euro area vis-à-vis the rest of the 

world, available up to the third quarter of 2008, 

indicate that the euro area recorded net liabilities 

of •1,158 billion vis-à-vis the rest of the world 

(representing 12.5% of euro area GDP), compared 

with net liabilities of •1,131 billion (also equal 

to 12.5% of GDP) at the end of 2007 (see 

Chart 37). This marginal increase in net liabilities 

in 2008 resulted largely from an increase in 

the net liability position in other investment 

(by •191 billion) and in portfolio investment (by 

•76 billion), which were almost entirely offset 

by an increase in the net asset positions in euro 

area direct investment abroad (by •182 billion) 

and in Þ nancial derivatives (by •35 billion). 
Reserve assets also increased only marginally, 

with valuation effects resulting from asset price 

changes and movements in the exchange rate 

contributing to these developments.

20083 ECONOMIC AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS 
IN NON-EURO AREA EU MEMBER STATESECONOMIC ACTIVITYIn most non-euro area EU Member States economic growth declined in the course of 2008 
following several years of robust expansion
(see Table 6).1 While this pattern of slowing economic activity was observed across almost 
all of the countries, annual GDP growth rates 
and the extent of the slowdown differed 
considerably. The Baltic States experienced the most pronounced slowdown, with average annual 
growth more than halving in Lithuania 
compared with the previous year and turning 
negative in Estonia and Latvia. In all three 
countries these developments followed several 
years of very strong growth in economic 
activity, accompanied by exceptionally strong 
increases in wages, credit and inß ation, as well 
as very large current account deÞ cits. Indeed, 
macroeconomic imbalances in the Baltic States 
remained large in 2008, notwithstanding the 
partial correction observed in the course of the 
year. The deceleration in GDP growth in most other non-euro area EU Member States was driven 
mainly by the weakening external environment 
and, later in the year, by the direct impact of the intensifying Þ nancial crisis. Tighter 
Þ nancing conditions and falling asset prices weakened 
consumer and industrial conÞ dence and 
dampened domestic demand. The deceleration of economic growth in Slovakia, 
from 10.4% in 2007 to 6.4% in 2008, was in 

part a normalisation following exceptionally 

high growth in the previous year. In Hungary, 

the very low annual growth of 0.5% in 2008 

reß ects the lagged impact of the sizeable 
Þ scal 
consolidation package in 2007, from which 

the economy started to recover slowly in 2008, 

combined with the subsequent impact of the 

Þ nancial crisis on the economy. In the three 
non-euro area EU Member States that joined 

the EU before 2004, the impact of the Þ nancial 
crisis was equally pronounced, resulting in 

annual GDP growth rates for 2008 of 0.7% in the 

United Kingdom, -0.2% in Sweden and -1.3% in 

Denmark. Economic activity in Poland and the 

Czech Republic appears to have been affected to 

a somewhat lesser extent, decelerating in 2008 

to 5.4% and 3.2% respectively. While Romania

2008and Bulgaria registered robust growth Þ gures of, 
respectively, 7.1% and 6.0% in 2008, economic 
activity in these countries also slowed more 

noticeably towards the end of the year, following 

a lengthy period of very high growth fuelled by 

buoyant domestic demand and strong credit and 

wage growth, and supported by sizeable foreign 

direct investment inß ows. 
PRICE DEVELOPMENTSAverage annual inß ation increased in 2008 in 
all non-euro area EU Member States (with the 

exception of Hungary) and, in inß ation-targeting 
countries, signiÞ cantly exceeded in
ß ation targets. 
The increase reß ects the initial upward trend 
in inß ation rates in most countries in the 
Þ rst 
half of the year, which was later reversed. In 

December 2008 inß ation was in most countries 
lower than at the beginning of the year.The highest inß ation rates were recorded in 
the Baltic States and Bulgaria, where average annual HICP inß ation ranged between 10.6% 
and 15.3%. In the Czech Republic, Hungary and 
Romania, average annual HICP inß ation was 
between 6.0% and 7.9%, while in the remaining 
countries Œ Denmark, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden 
and the United Kingdom Œ inß ation was between 
3.3% and 4.2%. One of the main factors behind the broad-based 
rise in inß ation was common to almost all non-
euro area EU countries, namely a strong increase 
in the world prices of food and energy. Some 
countries also implemented marked increases in 
administered prices and indirect taxes, and in a 
number of economies currency depreciation also 
contributed to the rise. Finally, in some cases 
buoyant domestic demand, increasing capacity 
constraints and agricultural supply shocks 
also exerted strong upward pressure on wages 
and prices. The factors driving the considerable moderation in inß ation later in 2008 were 
also common to most countries. First, annual 
inß ation rates started to decline as the effects 
of the global commodity price shock of 
2007 and early 2008 faded and world prices 
of oil declined signiÞ cantly. Second, domestic 
demand pressures eased in parallel with the 
decline in economic growth in the previously 
fastest-growing economies, and later also in 
most other non-euro area EU Member States 
as the Þ nancial crisis intensi
Þ ed. Nevertheless, 
wage pressures remained signiÞ cant in a number 
of countries, where real wage growth continued 
to outpace productivity growth, leading to 
signiÞ cant increases in unit labour costs.

2008FISCAL POLICIESThe Þ scal situation in the non-euro area EU 
Member States evolved very heterogeneously in 2008. Only Bulgaria, Denmark and Sweden 
continued to record Þ scal surpluses; the 
remaining countries registered in some cases 
high Þ scal de
Þ cits (see Table 8). The de
Þ cit ratio rose to above 3% of GDP in Latvia, 
Romania and the United Kingdom and was 
close to this level in Lithuania. Hungary 
reduced its deÞ cit from 5.0% of GDP in 2007 
to 3.3% in 2008. In the Baltic States, Romania 
and the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent 
in Sweden, budgetary outcomes for 2008 failed 
to meet the targets contained in the updated 
convergence programmes submitted at the 
end of 2007 or the beginning of 2008. For the 
Baltic States as well as for the United Kingdom, 
this was partly the result of the considerably 
worsening macroeconomic conditions, which 
rendered planned continued expenditure growth 
and therefore the 2008 budget unsustainable. Table 8 Fiscal positions in the non-euro area EU Member States and the euro area(as a percentage of GDP)General government surplus (+) / deÞ cit (-)

2008In the remaining non-euro area EU countries (i.e. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Hungary, Poland and Slovakia), budgetary 
outcomes for 2008 were broadly in line with or 
better than the convergence programme targets.In a generally deteriorating economic and Þ scal environment, Slovakia, Sweden and 
the United Kingdom planned or implemented 
Þ scal stimulus packages towards the end of 
2008, whereas several other non-euro area EU 
Member States announced plans for Œ in some 
cases ambitious Œ Þ scal consolidation in 2009. 
Latvia and Hungary, which received emergency 
Þ nancial support from, among others, the EU 
and the IMF, committed to sizeable Þ scal consolidation packages for 2009 and beyond. At the end of 2008, Hungary and the United Kingdom were subject to excessive 
deÞ cit procedures. The ECOFIN Council 
abrogated the excessive deÞ cit procedures 
for the Czech Republic and Slovakia in June 
and for Poland in July. In June Romania received 
policy advice from the European Commission 
in view of the risk that it would breach the 3% of GDP deÞ cit ceiling in an environment of 
strong GDP growth.The government debt ratio remained substantially below the 60% of GDP reference 
value in 2008 in most non-euro area EU Member 
States, with only Hungary recording a debt ratio 
above 60%. However, developments differed 
signiÞ cantly across countries. The debt ratio 
increased in Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Hungary, 
Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom, 
while it declined or was broadly unchanged in 
the other countries. Increases in the debt ratio in 
most countries reß ect mainly the deterioration 
in GDP growth and in the budget balance. For 
the United Kingdom the increase in the debt 
ratio relates to some extent also to the budgetary 
impact of emergency support provided to 
Þ nancial institutions. In the case of Denmark, 
the increase reß ects bond issuance in excess of 
the funding requirement.BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS

2008(see Table 9). While Denmark and Sweden reported surpluses, all other countries recorded 
deÞ cits. For many of the countries that joined 
the EU in 2004 or later, deÞ cits are a normal 
feature of the catching-up process, to the 
extent that they reß ect favourable investment 
opportunities and inter-temporal consumption 
smoothing. However, the very large current and 
capital account deÞ cits in some non-euro area 
EU Member States were also driven by buoyant 
domestic demand, benign global Þ nancing conditions and strong credit growth. The global 
Þ nancial turmoil in 2008 and its spillover to 
the real economy led to cooling or contracting 
domestic demand, thereby contributing to a 
narrowing of the deÞ cit in several non-euro area 
EU countries. Looking at the high-deÞ cit countries, the 
contraction in the current and capital account deÞ cit was the most pronounced in Estonia 
and Latvia, even though the deÞ cits recorded 
by those countries remained very large at the 
end of 2008. In Lithuania the deÞ cit narrowed 
to a signiÞ cantly lesser extent and in Romania 
it remained broadly unchanged, while Bulgaria 
recorded a further increase. In all the above 
countries the deÞ cit continued to exceed 10% of 
GDP, with the Bulgarian deÞ cit at over 20%. 
As regards countries with lower external deÞ cits, only the United Kingdom witnessed a contraction 
in its deÞ cit in 2008. In the Czech Republic and 
Poland the deÞ cit was broadly unchanged, while 
in Hungary and Slovakia it increased somewhat. 
The external imbalances in most countries 
originated from a deÞ cit in goods trade, except 
in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, 
where the deÞ cit in the income balance was 
the most important factor. In comparison with 
2007, net direct investment inß ows decreased in 
some countries in 2008. Most non-euro area EU 
Member States recorded a deÞ cit in the basic 
balance, i.e. the sum of the combined current 
and capital account and the direct investment 
balance, which exceeded 4% of GDP in several 
economies. Net portfolio investment ß ows were 
negative or broadly neutral in all non-euro area 
EU Member States in 2008, with the exception of the United Kingdom. Net ﬁother investmentﬂ 
ß ows continued to be largely positive in most 
countries that joined the EU in 2004 or later, 
reß ecting mainly loans from foreign-owned 
parent banks to their subsidiaries in the region. EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTSExchange rate developments in the non-euro 
area EU Member States in 2008 were strongly 
inß uenced by the exchange rate regimes of the 
individual countries. The currencies of Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia participated in ERM II. 
They were subject to a standard ß uctuation band of ±15% around their central rates against 
the euro, except for the Danish krone, with 
a narrower band of ±2.25% (see Chart 38). 
ERM II participation is, in some cases, 
accompanied by unilateral commitments on 
the part of the countries concerned to maintain 
narrower ß uctuation bands. These unilateral 
commitments place no additional obligations 
on the ECB. In particular, it was agreed that the Chart 38 Developments in ERM II(daily data; deviation from the central rate in percentage points)-15-12-9

200720082009Source: ECB.Notes: A positive (negative) deviation from the central rate 
against the euro implies that the currency is on the weak (strong) 
side of the band. For the Danish krone, the ß uctuation band is 
±2.25%; for all other currencies, the standard ß uctuation band of 
±15% applies. However, on the basis of unilateral commitments, 
the ß uctuation band for the Latvian lats is ±1%, and for both 
the Lithuanian litas and the Estonian kroon a currency board 
arrangement is maintained. The central rate of the Slovak koruna 
was revalued by 8.5% on 16 March 2007 and by 17.6472% on 
29 May 2008.91ECBAnnual Report
2008Estonian kroon and the Lithuanian litas could join ERM II with their existing currency board 
arrangements in place. The Latvian authorities 
decided to maintain the exchange rate of the lats at 
its central rate against the euro with a ß uctuation band of ±1%. The agreements on participation 
for the countries whose currencies joined 
ERM II in 2004 or later (i.e. all the countries 
listed above except Denmark) are also all based 
on a number of other policy commitments 
by the respective authorities. These relate to, 
among other things, the pursuit of sound Þ scal policies, the promotion of wage moderation and 
wage developments in line with productivity 
growth, the pursuit of prudent credit policies 
and the implementation of further structural 
reforms. Prior to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, money market spreads were 
relatively stable in most of the above-mentioned 
countries, some volatility in the Latvian market 
notwithstanding. In the fourth quarter of 2008, 
while exchange rate developments continued 
to reß ect the of
Þ cial exchange rate regimes, 
the intensiÞ cation of the global 
Þ nancial crisis, 
the deteriorating economic outlook, investors™ 
concerns about external vulnerabilities in some 
countries, together with credit rating downgrades 
for Latvia and Lithuania and decisions on the 
part of credit rating agencies to place Estonia 
under review for a rating downgrade, contributed 
to a rapid and pronounced widening of bond and 
money market spreads vis-à-vis the euro area in 
all ERM II countries except Slovakia. In Latvia, 
where the money market spread widening was 
particularly pronounced, and in Denmark, the 
central banks supported their currencies with 
foreign exchange intervention and by increasing 
the ofÞ cial interest rate spreads vis-à-vis the 
euro area. Against the background of a sharp 
deceleration in economic activity and tensions 
in the Þ nancial system, Latvia nationalised 
its largest domestically owned bank and in 
December 2008 arranged a •7.5 billion joint 
international Þ nancial support programme. The 
programme includes measures to stabilise the 
Þ nancial sector, substantial domestic economic 
reforms, Þ scal consolidation and signi
Þ cant public wage reductions, and is based on 
maintaining the current narrow-band exchange 
rate peg with a view to achieving Latvia™s policy 
goal of entering the euro area at the earliest 
possible date.By contrast, the prospect of Slovakia joining the euro area appears to have shielded the Slovak 
koruna from the negative impact of the global 
Þ nancial crisis. In the 
Þ rst half of 2008 the 
koruna strengthened considerably against the 
euro. On 29 May the currency™s central rate was 
revalued by 17.6472% to SKK 30.1260 against 
the euro. After the decision of the EU Council in 
July 2008 allowing Slovakia to adopt the euro, 
the Slovak koruna remained close to its new 
central rate, which was also the rate at which it 
was converted to the euro when the latter was 
introduced in Slovakia on 1 January 2009.Turning to the currencies of the non-euro area EU Member States that did not participate in 
ERM II, developments varied considerably 

across countries (see Chart 39). Most currencies
were broadly stable in the Þ rst half of 2008, 
while some, such as the Czech koruna, Chart 39 Developments in non-ERM II EU

2008the Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty appreciated and reached record levels against 
the euro. From September, however, the 
deepening of the Þ nancial crisis, amid marked 
global deleveraging and severe problems in the 
functioning of interbank markets worldwide, 
resulted in a rapid and pronounced depreciation 
of several currencies, in particular the Polish 
zloty, the Hungarian forint, the Romanian leu 
and, to a lesser extent, the Czech koruna. The joint international Þ nancial support 
programme for Hungary, which was aimed at alleviating the tensions in the Þ nancial market, helped initially (in late October and 
November 2008) to ease the downward pressure 
on both the forint and other currencies in the 
region. However, the deteriorating economic 
outlook and investors™ concerns about external 
vulnerabilities in some countries, together with 
credit rating downgrades for Bulgaria, Hungary 
and Romania in October and November, resulted 
in a further sharp depreciation of the zloty, 
the forint, the leu and, to a lesser extent, the 
koruna. Reß ecting its euro-based currency board 
arrangement, the Bulgarian lev remained Þ xed against the euro, notwithstanding an increase 
in interest rate spreads vis-à-vis the euro area. 
The pound sterling weakened sharply against 
the euro in the fourth quarter of 2008, with 
mounting recession fears in the United Kingdom 
and decreasing interest rate differentials vis-
à-vis the euro area.  In the Þ rst two months of 
2009 the pound appreciated somewhat against 
the euro amid high volatility. The Swedish krona 
depreciated substantially against the euro in the 
course of 2008.FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTSBetween January and December 2008 long-
term government bond yields in the non-euro 

area EU Member States (other than Estonia, 

for which no comparable long-term interest 

rate is available) were strongly affected by the 

global Þ nancial crisis. Portfolio changes due 
to a general increase in investor risk aversion 

were an important factor driving bond market 

developments in these countries. In the Þ rst 
part of 2008, developments in government 

bond yields in most non-euro area EU countries 

were similar to those in the euro area, where 

yields were relatively stable. This was followed 

by a period of increased divergence across the 

non-euro area EU countries, with some 

countries showing declining yields, as in the 

euro area, and others experiencing abrupt 

increases. In December 2008 long-term interest 

rates in the non-euro area EU Member States 

were, on average, around 85 basis points higher 

than at the beginning of 2008, compared with 

a decrease of 34 basis points in the euro area. 

The largest increases took place in Lithuania 

and Latvia (by 430 and 330 basis points 

respectively), mainly reß ecting the increased 
difÞ culties encountered by those governments 
in meeting their Þ nancing requirements in the 
context of a sharp deterioration in economic 

growth.Between January and December 2008, government bond yield spreads against the euro 
area increased on average in the non-euro area 
EU Member States. In Lithuania and Latvia they 
reached historical peaks, standing in December 
at around 500 basis points. As in the bond markets, stock exchange indices were negatively affected in all non-euro area 
EU countries in 2008 by higher uncertainty, 
negative sentiment as regards future economic 
developments and news of continued losses 
in the Þ nancial sector. Stock markets were 
generally characterised by high volatility and 
marked declines Œ on average by 50% between 
December 2007 and December 2008. Stock 
prices fell most in Bulgaria and Romania, where 
they decreased by more than 70%, mainly 
reß ecting the higher risk assigned by investors 
to the capital markets of these countries. MONETARY POLICYThe primary objective for monetary policy in 
all non-euro area EU Member States is price 
stability. Monetary policy strategies, however, 
differ considerably from country to country 
(see Table 10). 93ECBAnnual Report
2008In 2008 the monetary policy and exchange rate regimes of most non-euro area EU 
Member States remained largely unchanged. 
However, in February Hungary replaced 
its exchange rate band vis-à-vis the euro 
with a free-ß oating exchange rate and 
freed its existing inß ation-targeting regime. 
Some reÞ nements were made to monetary 
policy frameworks in a few other countries 
with a view to future monetary integration in the 
euro area. The intensiÞ cation of the global 
Þ nancial turmoil in autumn 2008 brought about several challenges for monetary policy in most non-euro area EU countries, with a number of countries 
experiencing liquidity constraints in their 
interbank markets, as well as tensions in their 
foreign exchange markets. The responses by the 
NCBs to these challenges varied depending on 
the economic conditions and the monetary policy 
framework in place.With regard to monetary policy decisions taken in 2008, most central banks participating in 
ERM II adopted monetary policy measures 
which often mirrored moves by the ECB.

2008on the main reÞ nancing operations of the 
Eurosystem by 25 basis points, before cutting its main policy rate in the last quarter of the year 
in three steps by a total of 175 basis points. Given their currency board arrangements,   (Bulgarian National Bank), Lietuvos bankas and Eesti Pank have no 
ofÞ cial policy rates; they automatically adjust to 
the rates set by the ECB. In addition, in view of 
diminishing conÞ dence among domestic banks 
and liquidity pressures in the interbank markets, 
the former two central banks lowered their 
minimum reserve requirements to ease liquidity 
constraints.Turning to the countries participating in ERM II and not operating under a currency board 
arrangement, Latvijas Banka, which maintains 
a ±1% ß uctuation band around the central rate 
of the lats as a unilateral commitment, kept its 
main interest rate at 6% throughout the year. 
However, it increased the deposit facility rate 
by 100 basis points to 3% and applied different 
marginal lending facility rates depending on the 
number of days the lending facility had been 
used within the previous 30-day period. Latvijas 
Banka also reduced its minimum reserve ratio 
for bank liabilities of over two years in Þ ve steps 
by a total of 500 basis points to 3%, and for other 
liabilities by a total of 300 basis points to 5%,
in order to ease the liquidity constraints in the 
banking sector. In December it entered into a 
swap agreement with Sveriges Riksbank and 
Danmarks Nationalbank, enabling it to borrow 
up to •500 million as short-term funding to 
preserve macroeconomic and Þ nancial stability.
Danmarks Nationalbank increased its main 
policy interest rate in four steps by a total of 125 
basis points between May and October 2008. 
While one decision (in July) followed a 
25 basis point rate increase by the ECB, the 
other measures were taken when the interest 
rate on the main reÞ nancing operations of 
the Eurosystem was left unchanged or even 
decreased, and were aimed at increasing the 
spread in policy rates vis-à-vis the euro area. 
The interest rate increases by Danmarks Nationalbank were intended to support the 
weakening krone in periods of tension in 
the foreign exchange markets. In October, 
Danmarks Nationalbank and the ECB announced 
the establishment of a swap line amounting to 
•12 billion to improve liquidity in short-term 
euro markets. This followed the conclusion of a 
similar arrangement by Danmarks Nationalbank 
with the Federal Reserve System in September. 
Following some easing of tensions in Danish 
Þ nancial markets, Danmarks Nationalbank 
followed the ECB in November and December 
2008 and decreased its main policy interest rate 
in two steps by a total of 125 basis points.In light of Slovakia™s coming adoption of the euro, Národná banka Slovenska followed the 
monetary policy decisions of the ECB from 
October 2008 and reduced its repo rate in three 
steps by a total of 175 basis points to 2.5%. It 
also narrowed the corridor of overnight rates 
around the repo rate to 100 basis points. Most NCBs with inß ation targets and not 
participating in ERM II tightened their monetary policy stance at the beginning of 2008, with 
the aim of containing inß ationary pressures 
stemming in large part from food and energy 
price increases, and in some countries also from 
robust wage growth. In the Þ rst three quarters of 
2008 Sveriges Riksbank, the Magyar Nemzeti 
Bank and Narodowy Bank Polski each increased 
their main policy rates by a total of 100 basis 
points in several steps, while Banca Naional a României increased its key interest rate in 
six steps by 275 basis points. eská národní 
banka increased its main policy rate only once, 
by 25 basis points in February, a move which 
was reversed in August. Having already started 
to lower policy rates in December 2007, the 
Bank of England continued to cut interest rates 
throughout the Þ rst three quarters of 2008. 
As inß ationary pressures diminished on the back 
of declining commodity prices, a weakening 
economic outlook and an intensiÞ cation of 
the global Þ nancial crisis, most NCBs with an 
inß ation target decreased their policy interest 
rates in the fourth quarter of 2008. On 8 October 95ECBAnnual Report
2008the Bank of England and Sveriges Riksbank cut interest rates by 50 basis points in a concerted 
action with the ECB and other, non-EU central 
banks. On 22 October, however, the Magyar 
Nemzeti Bank raised its key policy rate by 
300 basis points in response to Þ nancial market 
developments. In contrast, the Bank of England 
and Sveriges Riksbank continued to reduce 
rates in several steps, by a total of 300 basis 
points and 275 basis points respectively in the 
fourth quarter. The central banks of the Czech 
Republic, Poland and Hungary also made a 
series of policy rate decreases, reducing rates by 
a total of, respectively, 125, 100 and 150 basis 
points in November and December.Former ECB President Willem F. Duisenberg with his wife Gretta and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl arriving at the ceremony to celebrate the inauguration of the ECB on 30 June 1998CHAPTER 2CENTRAL BANK 
OPERATIONS 
AND ACTIVITIES98ECBAnnual Report
20081.1 MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS
The monetary policy operations of the Eurosystem comprise on the one hand open 
market operations, such as main reÞ nancing operations (MROs), longer-term reÞ nancing operations (LTROs) and Þ ne-tuning operations, 
and on the other hand standing facilities. 
Within the operational framework for the 
implementation of monetary policy, which 
is based on a system of minimum reserve 
requirements, these instruments are used to 
manage liquidity conditions in the interbank 
money market with a view to steering very 
short-term interest rates close to the ECB™s key 
policy rate.During 2008 Governing Council decisions affecting the key ECB interest rates were taken 
on four occasions. On 3 July the Governing 
Council decided to increase the key ECB interest 
rates by 25 basis points to 4.25%. On 8 October, 
6 November and 4 December it decided to lower 
the key ECB interest rates to 3.75%, 3.25% and 
2.50% respectively. In addition, on 8 October 
the Governing Council decided to narrow the 
corridor around the MRO interest rate formed 
by the rates on the standing facilities, from 
200 to 100 basis points, as of 9 October. As a 
consequence, the marginal lending facility rate 
was set at 50 basis points above the MRO interest 
rate, and the deposit facility rate at 50 basis 
points below the MRO rate. On 18 December the 
Governing Council decided to restore the width 
of the corridor to its pre-October levels with 
effect from 21 January 2009. The implementation of monetary policy during 2008 was driven by the Eurosystem™s efforts 
to address the tensions in the money markets 
related to the Þ nancial turmoil. In a 
Þ rst wave 
of measures, in the period up to September, the 
Eurosystem frontloaded the supply of liquidity 
at the beginning of the reserve maintenance 
period, allowing the banks to fulÞ l their 
minimum reserve requirements somewhat 
earlier in the maintenance period, and reduced 
it later, thus leaving the total supply of liquidity over the entire maintenance period unchanged. 
At the same time, the average maturity of open 
market operations was lengthened by increasing 
the share of liquidity provided via longer-term 
operations.In October 2008, following a marked deterioration in Þ nancial market conditions 
after the failure of Lehman Brothers, the ECB 
launched a second wave of measures. These 
measures included a move to a Þ xed rate tender procedure with full allotment for open market 
operations, the reduction of the corridor of 
standing facility rates from 200 to 100 basis 
points and the expansion of the list of assets 
eligible to be used as collateral in Eurosystem 
credit operations. All these measures aimed to ensure the continued access of solvent banks to liquidity, thus helping 
to improve the impaired functioning of the 
money market, while at the same time also 
steering short-term interest rates (see Box 10 for 
more details).1 MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS, FOREIGN

MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS DURING THE RECENT FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITYThe Þ nancial market turmoil affected the conduct of monetary policy operations throughout 
2008. This box describes the monetary policy operations conducted by the ECB in relation to the turmoil. It focuses on liquidity management measures, with regard to both euro operations 
and operations in foreign currencies, and describes how the collateral framework supported the 
implementation of monetary policy during this period. Two phases of liquidity management can be identiÞ ed in 2008. The 
Þ rst was the period from 
January to September, when the ECB broadly continued with the measures it had adopted during the second half of 2007. The second phase began with the failure of Lehman Brothers in 
September, which led to intensiÞ ed money market tensions and triggered a new wave of liquidity 
management measures.Liquidity management from January to September 2008
The ECB™s measures to address the tensions in the money market in the period from January to September 2008 can be grouped under three headings:1  Provision of liquidity earlier in the maintenance period
During this period the ECB increased the supply of liquidity at the beginning of the 
maintenance period and reduced it towards the end. This ﬁfrontloadingﬂ of liquidity enabled 

counterparties to fulÞ l their reserve requirements somewhat earlier in the maintenance period, 
but did not change the average supply of liquidity over the entire maintenance period. Credit 

institutions appeared to develop a preference for the early fulÞ lment of reserve requirements 
in an environment of high uncertainty and decreasing turnover, especially in longer-term 

segments of the money market. On some occasions, the ECB conducted Þ ne-tuning operations 
on days within a maintenance period with the aim of steering short-term interest rates close to 

the policy rate.2  Supplementary longer-term reÞ nancing operations
In this period the outstanding amount of reÞ nancing provided via longer-term operations,
 which had increased from roughly 30% before the start of the turmoil in July 2007 to around 
60% in January 2008, was kept broadly unchanged. On 7 February 2008 the Governing 

Council decided1 to renew the two additional three-month operations that had been introduced 
in 2007 with the aim of supporting the normalisation of the money market (initially for an 

amount of •60 billion and then for the reduced amount of •50 billion). At the same time, 

the average maturity of outstanding reÞ nancing was further increased with the introduction 
of supplementary LTROs with maturities of three and six months. On 28 March 2008 the 

Governing Council decided to introduce additional three-month operations of •50 billion as 

well as six-month operations. The Þ rst such six-month operations were settled on 3 April and 
1 The full list of statements communicated by the ECB can be found at http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omo/html/
communication.en.html. 100ECBAnnual Report
200810 July for amounts of •25 billion each. During 2008 these operations were all renewed when 
they matured.3  Operations in connection with the US dollar Term Auction Facility 
In order to address disruptions in the European US dollar funding markets triggered by the Þ nancial market turmoil, in 2007 the ECB established a reciprocal currency arrangement (swap 
line) with the Federal Reserve System. In connection with the US dollar Term Auction Facility 
of the Federal Reserve System, and in close cooperation with other central banks, the Eurosystem 
provided the US dollar funding received via this swap line to its counterparties against collateral 
eligible for Eurosystem credit operations.The Eurosystem provided US dollar liquidity for the Þ rst time in December 2007, in two operations which were renewed in January 2008. In view of the reduced demand for US dollars following these operations, the Eurosystem temporarily discontinued its US dollar-providing operations in 
February. However, liquidity pressures in funding markets increased again in February and at 
the beginning of March and prompted coordinated action by several central banks to address the 
renewed tension. As part of this coordinated action, the Governing Council decided on 11 March 
to reactivate the provision of US dollar funding to Eurosystem counterparties. US dollar funding was provided on a bi-weekly basis with a maturity of 28 days and for an amount of USD 15 billion in each auction. However, in view of persisting money market strains 
in some funding markets, evidenced by the high deposit rates for terms longer than overnight 
(e.g. one week) in various currencies, the unusually high US dollar rates implied by foreign 
exchange swap rates and the strong levels of demand in the Eurosystem™s US dollar operations, 
the amount in each bi-weekly auction was raised to USD 25 billion on 2 May.In order to better accommodate banks™ US dollar funding needs, the existing Eurosystem US dollar funding facilities were further enhanced on 30 July. The ECB, in coordination with 
the Federal Reserve System, announced the introduction of an 84-day Term Auction Facility to 
complement the existing 28-day US dollar funding. However, the total outstanding amount was 
left unchanged at USD 50 billion. Liquidity management from October to December 2008 
As tensions across all segments of the money market intensiÞ ed in mid-September 2008, the 
ECB adopted Þ ve additional liquidity management measures.1  Fixed rate tenders with full allotment
Heightened pressure in Þ nancial markets in the second half of September and early October
 2008 led to additional disruption in money markets, making it increasingly difÞ cult for credit 
institutions to obtain funding on the money market. In response to these developments, the 
Governing Council decided on 8 October that as of 15 October, and at least until the end of 

the maintenance period ending on 20 January 2009, all MROs would be conducted as Þ xed 
rate tenders with full allotment. This measure was aimed at signalling to market participants 

that the ECB was willing to supply as much liquidity as needed to avoid a liquidity crisis. 
101ECBAnnual Report
2008The measure led to a signiÞ cant increase 
in the total volume of outstanding euro-denominated open market operations, as 

the liquidity supply was now determined by 

the aggregate amount bid by counterparties 

(see Chart A). The full allotment policy was 

de facto implemented on 9 October by means 

of a liquidity-providing Þ ne-tuning operation 
in which all bids were satisÞ ed. 
Moreover, on 15 October the Governing 
Council decided to apply Þ xed rate tenders 
with full allotment also to LTROs (and 
supplementary LTROs), with effect from 
30 October and at least until the end of the Þ rst quarter of 2009. This enhanced liquidity provision signiÞ cantly alleviated tensions at the short end of the money market and led to a general decline 
in the EONIA, starting from the date of the 
announcements (see Chart B). Between mid-
October and the end of 2008, the EONIA was 
consistently below the MRO rate. Moreover, 
the EONIA declined within each maintenance 
period, in line with counterparties™ gradual 
fulÞ lment of reserve requirements and 
increasing overall use of the deposit facility.2   Reduction of the corridor formed by the 
standing facility ratesOn 8 October the Governing Council also decided to reduce the width of the corridor 
formed by the two standing facilities 
(i.e. the marginal lending facility and the deposit 
facility) from 200 to 100 basis points. The rate 
on the marginal lending facility was set at 
50 basis points above the MRO rate, and the 
rate on the deposit facility was set at 50 basis 
points below the MRO rate. The reduction 
of the corridor aimed to further ease banks™ 
liquidity management by offering cheaper 
central bank intermediation to the banking 
sector. This measure became effective 
on 9 October and remained in place until 
20 January 2009, when the width of the corridor 
was widened again to 200 basis points.Chart A Liquidity supply through open

20083   Supplementary longer-term re
Þ nancing operations
Following a decision by the Governing Council on 15 October, the provision of longer-term reÞ nancing was enhanced by rolling over existing operations and launching new operations. As a result, during each maintenance period four longer-term operations were conducted: one for 
the length of the maintenance period (a special-term reÞ nancing operation), two with a maturity 
of three months, and one with a maturity of six months. Consequently, by the end of 2008 
the share of MROs in the total reÞ nancing volume had declined to about 28%, while LTROs, supplementary LTROs and the special-term reÞ nancing operation accounted for the remaining 
72% (see Chart A).4  Additional US dollar and Swiss franc-providing operations 
The Eurosystem™s US dollar-providing operations From mid-September 2008 strains in the US dollar money markets worsened signiÞ cantly. In 
particular, the rates quoted for US dollar deposits during Asian, European and early US trading 
hours were very high, at times reaching levels above 10%. Market liquidity in the foreign 
exchange swap market was also unusually low amid signs of increased stress and market 
segmentation, whereby access to US dollar funding became extremely difÞ cult for institutions outside the United States. In response, the Eurosystem further reinforced its provision of 
US dollar liquidity to Eurosystem counterparties by adding operations with a 7-day and thereafter 
an overnight maturity to the existing 28-day and 84-day operations. It also further increased the 
amounts offered to counterparties in these US dollar-providing operations in two steps, each time 
also increasing the swap line with the Federal Reserve System. In early October the maximum 
amounts in the Eurosystem™s US dollar liquidity-providing operations reached USD 50 billion 
in the overnight operations, USD 40 billion in the 28-day operations and USD 20 billion in the 
84-day operations. On 15 October, given the high levels of uncertainty prevailing in the banking system, the ECB, in coordination with the Federal Reserve System, committed to fulÞ l all bids at a 
Þ xed rate for 
the 7-day, 28-day and 84-day operations, while the overnight operations were discontinued. In order to mitigate the potential problem of insufÞ cient availability of eligible collateral, given 
the full allotment procedure in both euro and US dollar liquidity-providing operations, the ECB 
announced on 15 October 2008 that the Eurosystem would also conduct US dollar liquidity-
providing operations in the form of EUR/USD foreign exchange swaps. These foreign exchange 

swap operations, conducted in parallel with the existing US dollar collateralised repurchase 

operations, were also Þ nanced through the swap agreement with the Federal Reserve System, 
which had been extended until 30 April 2009.The Eurosystem™s US dollar repurchase operations continued to meet with fairly high demand, with large bid amounts and a large number of bidders, whereas participation in the US dollar 
foreign exchange swap operations generally remained very limited in terms of both bidding 
volumes and the number of participants. The Eurosystem™s Swiss franc-providing operations The increased tensions in international money markets observed in October 2008 also led to 
upward pressure on short-term Swiss franc money market rates. At the same time, the Swiss 103ECBAnnual Report
2008franc funding needs of banks with no direct access to the Swiss National Bank™s operations, notably in the euro area, increased. Therefore, on 15 October the Swiss National Bank and the 
ECB jointly announced measures to improve liquidity in short-term Swiss franc money markets, 
whereby the Eurosystem would provide its counterparties with Swiss franc funding received via 
a swap line with the Swiss National Bank. The provision of Swiss franc liquidity by the Eurosystem took the form of EUR/CHF foreign exchange swaps at a Þ xed price and with a maximum allotment amount determined by the ECB 
in coordination with the Swiss National Bank. These swaps were initially introduced with a 
seven-day maturity only, but were later complemented by swaps with a three-month maturity, 
which were aimed at reducing tensions in this segment of the Swiss franc money markets. The maximum amount for each of these tenders was set at •20 billon in the 7-day and •5 billion in the 84-day operations. The EUR/CHF foreign exchange swaps met with fairly 
moderate demand, with bidding volumes below the maximum amount in all operations. The 
bid-to-cover ratio was stable at around 0.6 in the 7-day swaps and around 0.1 in the 84-day 
operations.The ECB™s euro liquidity provision to some EU central banks In October and November 2008 the ECB signed agreements to provide euro liquidity to a number 

of EU central banks outside the euro area. The ECB™s intention in establishing these agreements 

was to support various measures taken by these central banks, all of which were aimed at improving 

euro liquidity in their respective domestic Þ nancial markets. 
This support took the form of repurchase agreements for an amount of up to •5 billion with 
the Magyar Nemzeti Bank and for up to •10 billion with Narodowy Bank Polski. The ECB 
and Danmarks Nationalbank established a reciprocal currency swap arrangement amounting to 
•12 billion.5  Expansion of the list of collateral 
On 15 October the Governing Council decided to expand the list of eligible collateral on a temporary basis until the end of 2009. Availability of collateral was not a constraint throughout 
much of 2008, owing to the breadth of the Eurosystem™s collateral framework. Nevertheless, in 
the light of the extension of liquidity at various maturities in euro and in US dollars and of the 
introduction of Þ xed rate tenders with full allotment, the collateral framework was temporarily 
expanded as follows:Ł As of 22 October 2008 the credit threshold for marketable and non-marketable assets was lowered from ﬁA-ﬂ to ﬁBBB-ﬂ, with the exception of asset-backed securities, for which the credit quality threshold of ﬁA-ﬂ remains in force. In addition, since 22 October 2008 
the Eurosystem has also accepted debt instruments issued by credit institutions, including 
certiÞ cates of deposit, which are not listed on a regulated market, but traded on certain non-regulated markets deemed acceptable by the ECB. Subordinated marketable debt instruments, 
which are protected by an acceptable guarantee and which fulÞ l all other eligibility criteria, 
can also be used as collateral.104ECBAnnual Report
2008LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF THE BANKING SYSTEM 
When supplying liquidity through open market operations, the Eurosystem takes into 
account a daily assessment of the liquidity 
needs of the aggregate euro area banking 
system. These liquidity needs are determined 
by the sum of minimum reserve requirements, 
funds held in excess of these requirements on 
credit institutions™ current accounts with the 
Eurosystem (excess reserves) and autonomous 
factors. Autonomous factors are those items 
on the Eurosystem™s balance sheet, such as 
banknotes in circulation and government 
deposits, which have an impact on credit 
institutions™ current account holdings but are 
not under the direct control of the Eurosystem™s 
liquidity management. In 2008 the average daily liquidity needs of the euro area banking system amounted to 
•487.1 billion, 10.3% higher than in 2007 
(see Chart 41). One reason for the increase was 
the continued growth in reserve requirements, 
by 12.5%, to •210.8 billion. Another important 
reason was an exceptional increase in the 
demand for banknotes which was unrelated 
to seasonal factors. Chart 42 shows that 
the amount of banknotes in circulation rose 
signiÞ cantly, by more than 6% between 
September and early November 2008, which 
contributed to the total increase in liquidity 
needs. Overall, in 2008 autonomous factors 
increased by 8.9% to •274.5 billion. Although 
average excess reserves for the maintenance 
periods ending in 2008 increased compared 
with 2007, by •0.2 billion to •1.1 billion, they 
remained negligible in relative terms at 0.5% of 
reserve requirements.Ł Since 14 November the Eurosystem has also accepted marketable debt instruments issued in 
the euro area and denominated in US dollars, pounds sterling and Japanese yen, provided that 
the issuer is established in the EEA.In order to fulÞ l the Eurosystem™s statutory obligation to ensure that its balance sheet remains 
protected against Þ nancial risk, risk control measures are applied to the enlarged set of eligible 
collateral. The expansion of the eligibility criteria is thus combined with vigilant monitoring of 
the use of the framework.Chart 41 Liquidity factors in the euro area

2008MINIMUM RESERVE SYSTEM 
Credit institutions in the euro area are required to hold minimum reserves on current accounts 
with the Eurosystem. As has been the case since 
1999, the minimum reserve requirements were 
equal to 2% of credit institutions™ reserve base in 
2008 and amounted to •210.8 billion on average. 
It is the growth in the reserve base, which is 
determined by certain short-term liabilities 
on credit institutions™ balance sheets, which 
explains the above-mentioned 12.5% increase 
in the total amount of reserve requirements 
during 2008. Since for any maintenance period 
the Eurosystem remunerates reserve holdings 
at a rate which is the average of the marginal 
rates of the MROs (if conducted as variable rate 
tenders) or at the Þ xed MRO rate (in the case 
of Þ xed rate tenders), the minimum reserve 
system does not impose signiÞ cant costs on 
the banking sector. At the same time, it fulÞ ls two important functions in the operational 
framework for monetary policy implementation. 
First, it stabilises short-term money market rates, 
because the reserve requirements have to be 
fulÞ lled only on average over the maintenance 
period, allowing credit institutions to smooth 
out temporary and unexpected liquidity inß ows and outß ows. Second, it enlarges the liquidity 
deÞ cit of the banking system, i.e. banks™ overall 
need for reÞ nancing from the Eurosystem.
OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 
The Eurosystem uses MROs, LTROs and 
Þ ne-tuning operations to manage the liquidity 
situation in the money market. All liquidity-
providing operations have to be fully 
collateralised. MROs are regular operations 
with a weekly frequency and normally have 
a maturity of one week. They are the main 
instrument for signalling the ECB™s monetary 
policy stance. Until 8 October 2008 MROs were conducted as variable rate tenders with a minimum bid rate, and 
from 15 October as Þ xed rate tenders in which 
all bids were satisÞ ed. The number of eligible 
counterparties increased during 2008 from 1,693 
to 2,099. Most of this increase took place during 
the months of October and November, when some banks decided to apply for eligibility owing 
to borrowing constraints in the money market. 
On average, 443 counterparties participated in 
MROs in 2008, 31% more than in 2007 (when 
338 counterparties participated on average). 
This increase was also related to the intensiÞ ed pressure in the money market, which meant that 
many counterparties had to fulÞ l their liquidity 
needs by borrowing from the ECB instead of 
the market. The number of bidders in the MROs 
increased further when the ECB switched to Þ xed rate tenders with full allotment in October, from 
an average of 354 in the variable rate tenders to 
747 in the Þ xed rate tenders. 
Up until 8 October the Eurosystem allotted 
•175 billion on average in the variable rate 
tender MROs. The allotted amount varied 
considerably during this period owing to 
the frontloading policy, which resulted in a 
declining pattern of allotment amounts in the 
course of each maintenance period, and to the 
increased liquidity provision through LTROs. 
When Þ xed rate tenders with full allotment 
were introduced for MROs on 15 October 2008, 
allotment amounts increased signiÞ cantly, to 
•291 billion on average. By the end of 2008 the 
liquidity provided in MROs represented 28% of 
the total reÞ nancing volume, considerably less 
than in previous years, when it amounted to 
around 65-75%. LTROs are monthly liquidity-providing operations with a three-month maturity. In 
addition to these operations, a number of 
further supplementary LTROs were introduced 
gradually during 2008. By the end of the year, 
two supplementary LTROs were conducted 
during each maintenance period, one with a 
three-month and one with a six-month maturity, 
as well as one special-term reÞ nancing operation 
with a maturity equal to the length of the 
maintenance period. Until mid-October LTROs 
and supplementary LTROs were conducted 
as pure variable rate tenders (i.e. without a 
minimum bid rate). The allotment amount in 
the LTROs and three-month supplementary 
LTROs during this period was •50 billion 
(with the exception of two supplementary 106ECBAnnual Report
2008LTROs settling on 21 February and 13 March, in each of which •60 billion was allotted). 
Two of the six-month supplementary LTROs 
were conducted for an amount of •25 billion 
(on 2 April and 9 July), and one was conducted 
for an amount of •50 billion (on 8 October).As of 30 October 2008 longer-term operations were also conducted as Þ xed rate tenders with 
full allotment. The rate applied in all these 
operations was the MRO rate. The change 
to Þ xed rate tenders led to a general increase 
in allotment amounts also for longer-term 
operations. However, given strong expectations 
of a cut in key ECB interest rates, especially 
towards the end of 2008, the Þ xed rate applied 
in these tenders led to only a moderate increase 
in allotment amounts for supplementary LTROs 
with a maturity of three or six months. At the 
end of 2008 the outstanding amount of all 
longer-term operations (LTROs, supplementary 
LTROs and special-term reÞ nancing operations) 
stood at •617 billion, which represented the 
largest share of ECB reÞ nancing to the banking 
sector ever, at roughly 72% of all open market 
operations. LTROs are open to the same set of counterparties as MROs, 157 of which participated on average 
during 2008, compared with 145 in 2007. 
The introduction of Þ xed rate tenders led to 
a decrease in the average number of bidders 
in the LTROs from 161 (in variable rate 
tenders) to 146 (in Þ xed rate tenders). In the 
special-term reÞ nancing operations, which are 
also open to the same set of counterparties, 
210 counterparties participated in the variable 
rate tender settled on 30 September, while an 
average of 97 counterparties participated in the 
following two Þ xed rate tenders. 
The ECB may conduct liquidity-providing and 
liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning operations on 
an ad hoc basis to manage liquidity conditions 
in the market and to steer interest rates. Until 
5 October 2008 the Eurosystem selected a 
limited number of counterparties most active in 
the money market for these operations (136 on 
30 September 2008). Following a decision by the Governing Council, from 6 October 2008 
access to Þ ne-tuning operations was widened 
by granting eligibility to all counterparties that 
are eligible to participate in Eurosystem open 
market operations based on standard tenders, 
and that additionally fulÞ l certain selection 
criteria speciÞ ed by the respective NCBs.
In 2008 the ECB conducted 25 Þ ne-tuning operations. The practice of conducting end-of-
period Þ ne-tuning operations was maintained 
throughout the year, with 12 of these operations 
taking place on the last day of the maintenance 
periods. The remaining 13 were conducted in 
response to prevailing liquidity conditions and 
short-term money market interest rates. On 
2 and 3 January, when tensions related to the 
year-end eased, liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning operations were conducted in an environment 
of excess liquidity supply. On 20 and 31  March 
liquidity was provided in Þ ne-tuning operations 
as a result of money market tensions related to 
the Easter holiday period and the bankruptcy 
of Bear Stearns. To address the heightened 
pressure in money markets in September, the 
ECB conducted nine Þ ne-tuning operations 
between 15 September and 9 October, Þ ve of 
which were liquidity-providing and four of 
which were liquidity-absorbing.STANDING FACILITIESCounterparties may use the two standing 
facilities on their own initiative to obtain 
overnight liquidity against eligible collateral or 
to place overnight deposits with the Eurosystem. 
At the end of 2008, 2,267 counterparties had 
access to the marginal lending facility and 
2,802 counterparties had access to the deposit 
facility. The rates for these facilities in principle 
provide a ceiling and a ß oor for the overnight 
rate and therefore perform an important function 
for monetary policy implementation.In October 2008, following a decision by the Governing Council, the width of the corridor 
formed by these two rates was reduced from 
200 to 100 basis points symmetrically around 
the MRO rate as a measure to alleviate tensions 
in the money market. This measure, together 107ECBAnnual Report

2008expand the list of eligible collateral amounted to around •870 billion at the end of 2008. 
The list of eligible collateral also includes 
non-marketable assets, mostly credit claims 
(also referred to as bank loans). In contrast 
to marketable assets, non-marketable assets 
are assessed for eligibility only at the time of 
their acceptance. For this reason, the volume 
of potentially eligible non-marketable assets 
cannot easily be measured. The amount of non-
marketable assets put forward by counterparties 
as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations 
reached •0.2 trillion in 2008, representing 2% of 
total eligible collateral in the Eurosystem. The 
lower credit threshold temporarily introduced to 
expand the list of eligible collateral (see Box 10) 
was also applied to non-marketable assets.The average value of marketable and non-marketable assets put forward by counterparties 

as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations 

rose signiÞ cantly, from •1,148 billion in 
2007 (revised upwards from •1,101 billion) 

to •1,579 billion in 2008. This increase was 

mainly due to the fact that counterparties put 

forward large additional amounts of collateral 

with the Eurosystem in response to the 

Þ nancial market turbulence (see Chart 44). As 
the comparison of collateral with outstanding 

credit to the Eurosystem™s counterparties 

indicates, the share of deposited collateral

policy operations increased marginally on an 

aggregate basis. This suggests that sufÞ ciency 
of collateral has not been a systemic constraint 

on the Eurosystem™s counterparties despite the 

increasing volume of liquidity received in the 

reÞ nancing operations.
As regards the composition of collateral put 
forward, the average share of asset-backed 
securities increased from 16% in 2007 to 28% 
in 2008, overtaking uncovered bank bonds 
as the largest class of assets put forward as 
collateral with the Eurosystem. Uncovered 
bank bonds accounted on average for slightly 
less than 28% of the collateral put forward in 
2008. The average share of non-marketable 
assets increased from 10% in 2007 to 12% in Chart 44 Collateral put forward in Eurosystem

temporarily eligible accounted for around 3% of 
the total marketable collateral put forward.RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
The Eurosystem mitigates the risk of a 
counterparty default in a Eurosystem credit 
operation by requiring counterparties to submit 
adequate collateral. However, the Eurosystem is 
still exposed to a number of Þ nancial risks if a 
counterparty defaults, including credit, market 
and liquidity risk. In addition, the Eurosystem is 
exposed to currency risk in the context of 
liquidity-providing operations in foreign 
currencies against euro-denominated collateral, 
such as those conducted in 2008. In order to 
reduce these risks to acceptable levels, the 
Eurosystem maintains high credit standards for 
assets accepted as collateral, valuates collateral 
on a daily basis and applies appropriate risk 
control measures. As a matter of prudence, the 
Eurosystem has established a buffer against 
potential shortfalls resulting from the eventual 
resolution of collateral received from Þ ve speciÞ c counterparties that defaulted in 2008, 
the level of which will be reviewed annually, 
pending the eventual disposal of the collateral 
and in line with the prospect of recovery.1 More generally, Þ nancial risks in credit operations are 
quantiÞ ed and regularly reported to the ECB™s 
decision-making bodies.Every two years a review of the risk control 
measures for Eurosystem credit operations 

is conducted. These risk control measures 

are applied to the assets put forward by the 

Eurosystem™s counterparties as collateral for the 

credit the Eurosystem provides through its open 

market operations and the marginal lending 

facility, as well as in the form of intraday 

credit for payment systems purposes. While 

fully preserving the principle of accepting a 

wide range of collateral, the biennial review 

in 2008 led to some technical reÞ nements of 
the risk control framework for Eurosystem 

credit operations. These reÞ nements re
ß ect, 
among other things, improvements in the 
methodological framework, the assessment 

of market and liquidity risk characteristics of 

eligible assets, the actual use of eligible assets 

by counterparties and new developments in 

Þ nancial instruments. They were announced 
on 4 September 2008 and entered into force on 

1 February 2009.In the context of these reÞ nements, valuation 
haircuts for asset-backed securities and uncovered bank bonds have been revised. In 
addition, the prohibition to submit collateral that 
is issued or guaranteed by entities closely linked 
to the submitting counterparty has been extended 
to include special forms of close links that may 
arise when asset-backed securities are used as 
collateral. As of 1 February 2009, enhanced 
transparency is required for credit assessments 
of asset-backed securities issued by an eligible 
external credit assessment institution.Finally, the Eurosystem has the possibility to limit or exclude the use of certain assets as 
collateral for its credit operations if required, 
also at the level of individual counterparties, 
to ensure adequate risk protection of the 
Eurosystem in line with Article 18.1 of the 
Statute of the ESCB. 1.2 FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS
In 2008 the Eurosystem did not undertake any 
interventions in the foreign exchange market 
for policy reasons. The ECB™s foreign exchange 
transactions were exclusively related to 
investment activity. Furthermore, the ECB did 
not undertake any foreign exchange operations 
in the currencies that participate in ERM II. 
The standing agreement between the ECB and 
the IMF to facilitate the initiation of special 
drawing right (SDR) transactions by the IMF on 
behalf of the ECB with other SDR holders was 
activated on 17 occasions in 2008.In the context of the continuing Þ nancial market volatility in 2008, the Eurosystem also For further details, see the press release of 5 March 2009.1 110ECBAnnual Report
2008conducted 73 operations in connection with the US dollar Term Auction Facility of the Federal 
Reserve System (57 reverse transactions against 
eligible collateral and 16 through EUR/USD 
foreign exchange swaps), providing US dollar 
liquidity to the Eurosystem™s counterparties, 
and 15 Swiss franc-providing operations in 
cooperation with the Swiss National Bank 
(for more details, see Box 10). 1.3 INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
The ECB™s investment activities are organised 
in such a way as to ensure that no insider 
information about central bank policy actions 
may be used when making investment 
decisions. A set of rules and procedures, known 
as the Chinese wall, separates the business units 
involved in operational investment activities 
from other business units.FOREIGN RESERVE MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio was 
originally set up through transfers of foreign 
reserve assets from the euro area NCBs. Over 
time, the composition of the portfolio reß ects changes in the market value of the invested assets, 
as well as foreign exchange and gold operations 
of the ECB. The main purpose of the ECB™s 
foreign reserves is to ensure that, whenever 
needed, the Eurosystem has a sufÞ cient amount 
of liquid resources for its foreign exchange 
policy operations involving non-EU currencies. 
The objectives for the management of the ECB™s 
foreign reserves are, in order of importance, 
liquidity, security and return. The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio consists of US dollars, Japanese yen, gold and SDRs. The 
US dollar and Japanese yen reserves are actively 
managed by the ECB and the euro area NCBs, 
as agents for the ECB. Since January 2006 a 
ﬁcurrency specialisation modelﬂ has been in 
operation to increase the efÞ ciency of the 
Eurosystem™s investment operations. Under this 
scheme, each NCB is as a rule allocated a share 
in either the US dollar or the Japanese yen 
portfolio, with two NCBs currently managing two.2 During 2008 two arrangements were put in place which enable certain NCBs to pool 
operational activities for the management of 
their shares of the ECB™s foreign reserves: the 
Central Bank of Cyprus has pooled with the 
Bank of Greece and the Central Bank of Malta 
has pooled with the Central Bank and Financial 
Services Authority of Ireland since January 
2008. As of January 2009 Národná banka 
Slovenska manages a US dollar portfolio as an 
agent for the ECB.During 2008 the ECB sold 30 tonnes of gold in total. These sales were in full conformity 
with the Central Bank Gold Agreement of 
27 September 2004, to which the ECB is a 
signatory. The proceeds of the gold sales were 
added to the US dollar portfolio.The value of the ECB™s net foreign reserve assets 3 at current exchange rates and market prices increased from •42.8 billion at end-2007 to 
•49.5 billion at end-2008, of which •38.5 billion 
was in foreign currencies Œ the Japanese yen 
and the US dollar Œ and •11 billion was in gold 
and SDRs. Applying the exchange rates of end-
2008, US dollar-denominated assets represented 
77.5% of the foreign currency reserves, while 
those denominated in Japanese yen accounted 
for 22.5%. The increase in value of the foreign 
currency portfolio, of 19.9%, mainly reß ected capital gains and interest income generated by 
portfolio management activities, particularly 
with regard to US dollar-denominated assets. 
The appreciation of the Japanese yen (by 
30.8%) and the US dollar (by 5.8%) versus the 
euro also contributed to the increase in value 
of the currency portfolio. Finally, the ECB™s 
foreign currency reserves also rose as a result of 
the investment of the proceeds of the gold sales 
mentioned above. The value of both the gold For more details, see the article entitled ﬁPortfolio management 2 at the ECBﬂ in the April 2006 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.
Net foreign reserve assets are calculated as ofÞ cial reserve assets 
3 excluding the net, marked-to-market value of foreign currency 
swaps, plus deposits in foreign currency with residents, minus 
future predetermined net drains on foreign currency holdings 
owing to repurchase and forward transactions. For detailed 
information on the data sources, see http://www.ecb.europa.eu/
stats/external/reserves/templates/html/index.en.html111ECBAnnual Report
2008and SDR holdings increased by around 2.6% in 2008, despite the sale of 30 tonnes of gold 
during the year. This increase was mostly due 
to the appreciation of gold by around 9.4% in 
2008, as measured in euro terms. No losses in 
the ECB™s foreign reserves were experienced as 
a result of defaulting investment counterparties. In 2008 the list of eligible instruments in which the ECB™s foreign reserves can be invested was 
kept unchanged. Interest rate swaps, which were 
introduced in late 2007, were used regularly 
in 2008. The preparatory work to establish an 
automatic securities lending programme for 
the ECB™s US dollar-denominated assets was 
completed in 2008. It is envisaged that the 
programme will start in 2009, although this will 
depend on prevailing market conditions. OWN FUNDS MANAGEMENT 
The ECB™s own funds portfolio consists of 
the invested counterpart of the ECB™s paid-up 
capital, as well as amounts held from time to 
time in its general reserve fund and its provision 
against foreign exchange rate, interest rate and 
gold price risks. The purpose of this portfolio is 
to provide the ECB with income to help to cover 
its operating expenses. The objective of its 
management is to maximise expected returns, 
subject to a no-loss constraint at a certain 
conÞ dence level. The portfolio is invested in 
euro-denominated Þ xed income assets. 
The value of the portfolio at current market prices 

grew from •9.3 billion at end-2007 to •10.2 billion 

at end-2008. The increase in market value was 

due to the investment in the own funds portfolio 

of the provision against foreign exchange rate, 

interest rate and gold price risks established by the 

ECB in 2005, as well as to investment returns and 

the contributions by the Central Bank of Cyprus 

and the Central Bank of Malta to the capital and 

reserves of the ECB following the adoption of the 

euro by Cyprus and Malta. 
The list of eligible issuers of covered bonds and senior uncovered bonds was extended slightly 
in 2008. No losses were experienced as a result 
of defaulting investment counterparties.RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUESThe Þ nancial risks to which the ECB is 
exposed in its investment activities are closely 
monitored and measured in order to keep 
them within the levels speciÞ ed by the ECB™s 
decision-making bodies. For this purpose, a 
detailed limit structure is in place and limits are 
monitored daily. Regular reporting ensures that 
all stakeholders are adequately informed of the 
level of such risks. In 2008 the ECB further enhanced the risk 
management framework for its investment 

operations by upgrading IT systems and Þ ne-tuning its credit risk methodology. The overall 

framework proved resilient in the wake of the 

Þ nancial crisis and no losses occurred as a result 
of a counterparty or issuer default. Moreover, 

as part of its efforts to support the development 

of state-of-the-art strategic asset allocation 

methodologies in central banks, the ECB, in 

cooperation with the World Bank and the BIS, 

organised the Þ rst conference on strategic asset 
allocation for central banks and sovereign wealth 

managers in Frankfurt on 24 and 25 November 

2008.One of the indicators used to monitor market 
risk is Value-at-Risk (VaR), which deÞ nes 
the loss for a portfolio of assets that will not 

be exceeded at the end of a speciÞ ed period of 
time with a given probability. The value of this 

indicator depends on a series of parameters used 

for the calculation, in particular the conÞ dence 
level, the length of the time horizon and the 

sample used to estimate asset price volatility. 

As an illustration, computing this indicator for 

the ECB™s investment portfolio on 31 December 

2008, using as parameters a 95% conÞ dence 
level, a time horizon of one year and a sample 

of one year for asset price volatility, would result 

in a VaR of •9,185 million. Computing the same 

indicator with a Þ ve-year instead of a one-year 
sample would result in a VaR of •5,823 million. 

Most of this market risk is due to currency and 

gold price risk. The low levels of interest rate risk 

reß ect the fact that the modi
Þ ed duration of the 
ECB™s investment portfolios remained relatively 

low in 2008.112ECBAnnual Report
2008The Eurosystem has the statutory task of promoting the smooth operation of payment 
systems. Its main instrument for carrying out 
this task Œ aside from the oversight function 
(see Section 4 of Chapter 4) Œ is the provision 
of payment and securities settlement facilities. 
To this end, the Eurosystem created the 
Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross 
settlement Express Transfer system, known 
as TARGET, for large-value and urgent 
payments in euro. The technically decentralised 
Þ rst-generation system was progressively 
replaced by a second-generation system 
(TARGET2), which is based on a single technical 
infrastructure, the Single Shared Platform 
(SSP). Three Eurosystem central banks Œ the 
Banca d™Italia, the Banque de France and the 
Deutsche Bundesbank Œ jointly provide the SSP 
and operate it on behalf of the Eurosystem. The 
migration to TARGET2 started in November 
2007 and was completed in May 2008. With regard to collateral mobilisation, the Eurosystem and the market offer a 
number of channels to facilitate the use of 
collateral across national borders. In 2008 the 
Eurosystem, together with market participants, 
continued to work on the development of 
TARGET2-Securities (T2S), with the objective 
of providing securities settlement services in 
central bank money through a single European 
technical platform with harmonised processes 
and procedures. The project was approved by 
the Governing Council in July 2008, and the 
technical details of the project are now in the 
process of being deÞ ned. T2S will harmonise 
domestic and cross-border settlements of 
securities transactions in central bank money 
within the euro area.2.1 THE TARGET SYSTEM
TARGET plays an important role in the 
execution of the single monetary policy and 
the functioning of the euro money market. 
TARGET offers a real-time settlement service 
in central bank money and broad market 
coverage. It processes large-value and urgent transactions and has also attracted a variety 
of other payments. TARGET is available for 
payments in euro between participating banks, 
without any upper or lower value limit. Such 
transfers are made both between banks in the 
same Member State (intra-Member State trafÞ c) and between those in different Member States 
(inter-Member State trafÞ c).THE MIGRATION TO TARGET2The TARGET system began operations on 
4 January 1999, following the introduction of the 
euro. It was originally made up of 15 national 
real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems and 
the ECB payment mechanism (EPM). Despite its 
success, TARGET had a number of shortcomings 
that stemmed from its heterogeneous technical 
design and decentralised structure. To address 
these issues and to cater for developments such 
as the further enlargement of the euro area, the 
Eurosystem launched the TARGET2 project in 
October 2002.The Eurosystem™s aim in developing TARGET2 was to create a streamlined version of the 
original TARGET system which would better 
meet user needs, providing a harmonised service 
level with a harmonised pricing scheme and 
ensuring cost-efÞ ciency. TARGET2 was also 
designed to be able to respond ß exibly and in a 
timely manner to future developments, such as 
euro area and EU enlargement. The TARGET2 system started operations on 19 November 2007, when the Þ rst group of 
countries (Germany, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Luxembourg, Malta, Austria and Slovenia) 
migrated to the SSP. This Þ rst step was very 
successful and conÞ rmed the reliability of the 
TARGET2 platform, which, following this 
initial migration, was already settling around 
50% of the overall TARGET trafÞ c in terms of 
volume and 30% in terms of value.On 18 February 2008 the second migration group (Belgium, Ireland, Spain, France, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and Finland) successfully 
joined the SSP, followed on 19 May by the Þ nal group (Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Poland 2 PAYMENT AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS
113ECBAnnual Report
2008and the ECB). As a result of careful monitoring by the central banks, all related testing activities 
were completed successfully and on time for all 
user communities. Between November 2007 and 
May 2008, procedures were in place to ensure 
that those user communities which had a later 
migration date (and were therefore still operating 
in the Þ rst-generation TARGET system) could 
interact effectively with the user communities 
already connected to the SSP of TARGET2. The 
six-month migration process was very smooth 
and did not cause any operational disruptions.TARGET OPERATIONSThe TARGET system functioned smoothly 
in 2008 and continued to settle an increasing 
number of euro payments. The system™s market 
share was stable, with 90% of the total value of 
payments in euro large-value payment systems 
being executed via TARGET. The average 
number of payments processed by the TARGET 
system each day increased by 1%, to 369,966, 
while the average value rose by 10%, to •2,667. 
On 22 December 2008 TARGET reached 
a peak of 576,324 transactions, which is an 
all-time high for the system. Table 11 provides 
an overview of the payment trafÞ c in the 
TARGET system in 2008, comparing it with the 
trafÞ c in the previous year.
The overall availability of TARGET, i.e. the 

extent to which participants were able to use the 

TARGET system during their business hours 

without incident, reached 99.79% in 2008. It is 

noteworthy that this is the highest Þ gure since 
the start of TARGET operations in 1999 and 

that the migration to TARGET2 did not have 

any negative effects on the system™s availability. 

More than 99.76% of the payments on the SSP of 

TARGET2 were processed within Þ ve minutes. 
The feedback from TARGET2 users on the 

system™s performance has been very positive.By December 2008 900 direct participants maintained an RTGS account on the SSP of 
TARGET2. This Þ gure is lower than the 1,072 
direct participants which had accounts in the Þ rst-generation TARGET system at the start of the 
migration. There are two main reasons for this. First, a number of credit institutions reconsidered 
their direct participation at the time of their 
migration and opted instead to connect indirectly 
via a direct participant. Second, TARGET2 
created strong incentives for banks to rationalise 
their euro liquidity management and to centralise 
it in fewer RTGS accounts. The overall number 
of banks (including branches and subsidiaries) 
that can be addressed worldwide through 
TARGET has remained stable at some 52,000.RELATIONS WITH TARGET2 USERS 
During its development, TARGET2 beneÞ ted greatly from the active cooperation between the 
Eurosystem and the future users of the system. 
This considerably improved the understanding 
of market requirements and was instrumental in 
ensuring a smooth migration process and high 
levels of acceptance of the system by the users.This cooperation continued beyond the migration phase. The Eurosystem maintains 
close relations with TARGET2 users and 
regular meetings were held between the euro Table 11 Payment traffic in TARGET 1Volume (number of transactions)20072008

2008area NCBs and national TARGET2 user groups in 2008. In addition, joint meetings of 
the Eurosystem Working Group on TARGET2 
and the TARGET Working Group of the 
European banking industry took place regularly, 
at which TARGET2 operational issues were 
discussed. Strategic issues were addressed in 
the Contact Group on Euro Payments Strategy, 
a forum composed of senior representatives of 
commercial and central banks.THE CONNECTION TO TARGET OF NON-EURO AREA 

COUNTRIESAll euro area countries participate in TARGET, 
as its use is mandatory for the settlement of any 
euro operations with the Eurosystem. TARGET 
is also available, on a voluntary basis, to non-
euro area Member States to facilitate the 
settlement of euro-denominated transactions in 
these countries.4 When Cyprus and Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008, the Central 
Bank of Cyprus, the Central Bank of Malta and 
their respective national user communities were 
already using the TARGET system. In the 
context of Slovakia™s entry into the euro area on 
1 January 2009, Národná banka Slovenska also 
joined the system.FORTHCOMING DEVELOPMENTSIt is foreseen that a new release of the SSP will 
be made available each year, offering a range of 
enhancements and new features to TARGET2 
users. The content of these annual releases will 
be deÞ ned following a broad consultation of the 
user community. The Þ rst annual release of the 
SSP went live on 17 November 2008. Its content 
was mainly driven by the new SWIFT standard 
release, which went live on the same day. As an 
exception, two releases are scheduled for 2009. 
The Þ rst one, in May, will enhance the interface 
with ancillary systems, in particular allowing 
settlement across central securities depositories 
(CSDs). The second release, in November, 
will incorporate various other enhancements 
requested by users.2.2 TARGET2-SECURITIES 
The European securities settlement market 
is still highly fragmented, although some 
positive developments in the form of increased 
consolidation and cooperation have been 
observed. The existence of a large number of 
settlement systems, among other things, means 
that settlement costs are much higher for EU 
cross-border transactions than they are for 
domestic transactions or for transactions in the 
United States. At the same time, demand for 
an integrated European securities settlement 
infrastructure is increasing. T2S was proposed by the Eurosystem in 2006 as a solution to the existing fragmentation 
of the settlement infrastructure. It will be a 
multi-currency settlement platform, owned and 
operated by the Eurosystem, which will enable 
European CSDs to settle securities transactions 
in central bank money. The participating 
CSDs will maintain legal relations with 
their customers and will continue to perform 
custody and notary functions. T2S will provide 
a single technical platform where all EU 
securities can be exchanged for euro and other 
participating currencies through standardised 
processes and means of communication. 
Furthermore, T2S will signiÞ cantly reduce 
participants™ liquidity needs and Þ nancial risk exposure by providing facilities such as 
auto-collateralisation (i.e. automated generation 
of an intraday credit in central bank money 
against collateral when the buyer has insufÞ cient funds to settle securities transactions), 
continuous optimisation, recycling mechanisms 
and a night-time settlement window. Moreover, 
being able to settle all EU securities transactions 
in central bank money on one single platform 
will eliminate the Þ nancial risk exposure 
that participants may currently encounter in Throughout 2008 the non-euro area countries connected to 4 TARGET were Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.115ECBAnnual Report
2008cross-CSD settlement. T2S will thus increase the efÞ ciency of collateral management, enable 
users to optimise their Þ nancing across all EU 
assets and contribute to the stability of the 
Þ nancial system.
In December 2007 the T2S Advisory Group 5 completed the Þ rst draft version of the T2S user 
requirements, which describe the features that 
CSDs and Þ nancial market participants require 
from T2S. The ECB coordinated the process and 
took a major role in the drafting. On 
18 December 2007 the Eurosystem published 
these draft user requirements, together with the 
methodology for an economic impact analysis, 
for public consultation. The Advisory Group Þ nalised the user 
requirements on the basis of the comments received in the public consultation. On 
23 May 2008 the Governing Council invited 
all European CSDs to join the T2S initiative, 
providing them with detailed information about 
the work undertaken thus far. All euro area CSDs expressed their willingness, subject to certain conditions, to use the T2S 
platform once it starts operations. In addition, 
the Danish CSD and Danmarks Nationalbank 
indicated that they wanted to use T2S for the 
settlement of securities transactions denominated 
in both Danish krone and euro. In addition, the 
CSDs of Sweden, Switzerland and the United 
Kingdom indicated their intention to participate 
for euro settlement. In view of this widespread 
support from European CSDs, the Governing 
Council on 17 July 2008 ofÞ cially launched the 
T2S project, with the T2S platform expected to 
be in place by 2013 at the latest. The Governing 
Council also approved the Þ nal version of the 
user requirements and assigned the technical 
development and operation of T2S to the 
Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banco de España, 
the Banque de France and the Banca d™Italia. As foreseen in the governance framework for the speciÞ cation phase, a new Advisory Group 
was subsequently established, consisting of 
an equal number of central bank, CSD and user representatives. It met for the Þ rst time in 
October 2008, when it created six sub-groups 
to organise the T2S workstreams. Two of these 
sub-groups focus on harmonisation efforts, 
one on ﬁprocess efÞ ciencyﬂ and another on 
ﬁcorporate actionsﬂ. Coordination with existing 
harmonisation initiatives, in particular the 
work undertaken by the European Commission 
(e.g. within the Clearing and Settlement 
Advisory Monitoring Expert Group II and the 
Legal Certainty Group) is also ensured.Furthermore, in 2008 a change management process for the T2S user requirements was 
established, and the process of deÞ ning the T2S general functional speciÞ cations on the basis of 
the user requirements began. The ECB provided 
advice to the non-euro area central banks to help 
them to decide, together with local CSDs and 
market participants, whether or not to include 
their currencies in T2S. By the end of 2008 
the Lithuanian CSD and Lietuvos bankas had 
conÞ rmed that they intended to settle securities 
transactions in litas as well as euro via T2S. 
Furthermore, the CSDs of Bulgaria, Estonia 
and Romania indicated that they intended to use 
T2S for the settlement of their euro transactions. 
The legal and contractual arrangements between 
the participating CSDs and the Eurosystem are 
being prepared.2.3 SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES FOR COLLATERAL 
Eligible assets may be used to collateralise all 
types of Eurosystem credit operation, not only 
at the domestic level but also across national 
borders. Since the introduction of the euro, 
the use of cross-border collateral has grown 
continuously. In 
December 2008 the amount of 
cross-border collateral held by the Eurosystem 

increased to •861 billion, from •683 billion in 
the same month of the previous year. Overall, 

at the end of 2008 cross-border collateral 

represented 45.0% of 
the total collateral 
provided to 
the Eurosystem.The T2S Advisory Group is composed of NCB and CSD 5 representatives as well as market participants.116ECBAnnual Report
2008Two main channels are available for the cross-border mobilisation of collateral. These 
are the correspondent central banking model 
(CCBM) provided by the Eurosystem and 
eligible links between euro area securities 
settlement systems (SSSs).EUROSYSTEM COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT 

SERVICESThe CCBM has remained the main channel 
for transferring cross-border collateral in 
Eurosystem monetary policy and intraday credit 
operations. It accounted for 36.7% of the total 
collateral provided to the Eurosystem in 2008. 
Assets held in custody through the CCBM 
increased from •558 billion at the end of 2007 
to •713 billion at the end of 2008. The CCBM framework has been revised in order to allow for the integration of new euro 
area countries. In this connection, the CCBM 
Agreement with Národná banka Slovenska was 
signed in the context of Slovakia joining the 
euro area. Despite its success and considerable contribution to the process of Þ nancial integration, the 
CCBM arrangement has some drawbacks, 
mainly linked to the fact that it was designed as 
an interim solution that relies on the principle 
of minimum harmonisation. These drawbacks, 
in combination with the growing importance 
of cross-border collateral, led to the Governing 
Council™s decision of 8 March 2007 to review 
the existing Eurosystem collateral management 
handling procedures and to create a new 
single-platform collateral management system 
for the Eurosystem, called Collateral Central 
Bank Management, or CCBM2. Market 
participants were involved by means of public 
consultations and ad hoc meetings in the 
deÞ nition of the principles and user requirements 
for CCBM2. Given the positive feedback on the Eurosystem initiative, the Governing Council decided on 
17 July 2008 to launch the CCBM2 project. 
The development and operation of CCBM2, on 
behalf of the Eurosystem, was assigned to the Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale 
de Belgique and De Nederlandsche Bank, with 
a view to implementing the system before or, at 
the latest, at the same time as T2S. The objective of CCBM2 is to consolidate the 
Eurosystem™s internal systems for collateral 

management, thereby rendering them more 

efÞ cient. In particular, it aims, where possible, 
to address the drawbacks of the current set-up by 

optimising the cost of mobilising collateral and 

by enhancing liquidity management. The scope of 

CCBM2 goes beyond that of the current CCBM, 

as it will provide for a single set of procedures 

with a harmonised level of service for the 

delivery and acceptance of all eligible collateral 

(securities and non-marketable assets) used on 

both a domestic and a cross-border basis. 
The participation of the euro area NCBs in CCBM2 will be voluntary, and a modular 
approach will be adopted. CCBM2 will consist 
of several modules, only one of which Œ the 
message router Œ will be compulsory for the 
NCBs participating in CCBM2. Through this 
mandatory module, standardised interaction 
between the Eurosystem and counterparties 
will be ensured. The other modules, which 
deal with the actual handling of marketable and 
non-marketable assets, will remain optional. This 
modular approach gives NCBs the ß exibility to 
choose the CCBM2 modules that suit their own 
needs and those of their market. CCBM2 will 
be able to adjust to changes in the Eurosystem™s 
collateral and operational framework, as well 
as to adapt to market developments in a smooth 
and timely manner.In the current project phase, detailed speciÞ cations 
for users are being developed by the Eurosystem 
on the basis of the approved user requirements 
6. The Eurosystem will maintain an open dialogue 

with market participants throughout the 

subsequent phases of the CCBM2 project.

2008ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITIES 
SETTLEMENT SYSTEMSNational SSSs can be linked by means of 
contractual and operational arrangements to 
allow the cross-border transfer of eligible 
securities between systems. Once eligible 
securities have been transferred via such links 
to another SSS, they can be used through local 
procedures in the same way as any domestic 
collateral. 60 direct and 6 relayed links are 
currently available to counterparties, but only 
a limited number of them are actively used. 
Furthermore, these links only cover part of the 
euro area. Links become eligible for Eurosystem 
credit operations if they fulÞ l the Eurosystem™s 
user standards (see Section 4 of Chapter 4). The amount of collateral held through links increased from •125 billion in December 2007 
to •148 billion in December 2008, but 
accounted for only 8.3% of the total collateral 
(both cross-border and domestic) held by the 
Eurosystem in 2008, compared with 8.9% 
in 2007. 118ECBAnnual Report
20083 BANKNOTES AND COINS 
3.1 THE CIRCULATION OF BANKNOTES AND 
COINS AND THE HANDLING OF CURRENCYDEMAND FOR EURO BANKNOTES AND COINSAt the end of 2008 the number of euro banknotes in circulation stood at 13.1 billion, with a value 
of •762.8 billion. This represented an increase 
of 8.3% in terms of volume and 12.7% in terms 
of value compared with the levels at the end of 
2007 (12.1 billion banknotes with a value of 
•676.6 billion).Following the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial market turmoil, a strong increase in the number of euro banknotes in circulation was recorded 
in the Þ rst half of October 2008, equivalent to a value of •35 to •40 billion. In the last quarter of 2008 demand was particularly high for the denominations •100 and 
•500 and was to a large extent driven by demand 
from outside the euro area. As a result, by the 
end of the year the average value of a banknote 
in circulation had increased to •58.15 (compared 
with •55.85 at the end of the previous year). Statistics indicate that net shipments of euro banknotes by euro area credit institutions to destinations outside the euro area reached a 
total value of around •96 billion by the end 
of December 2008, which represents a share 
of 13% of the total value of euro banknotes in 
circulation. These shipments were due to an 
increase in demand from foreign residents. 
Given that there are additional reasons for euro 
banknotes to travel beyond the euro area (such 
as tourism or guest worker remittances), it is 
estimated that, in value terms, close to 20% of 
the euro banknotes in circulation are held by 
non-euro area residents.Charts 46 and 47 illustrate the steady increase in the total number and value of euro banknotes 
in circulation, together with the annual growth 
rates. Looking at the breakdown of the denominations, the •500 banknote, which is to a large extent 
used for hoarding, showed the strongest growth 
in circulation, rising by 17.1% at the end of 2008 
compared with one year earlier. It was followed 
by the •100, •50 and •200 banknotes, which 
rose by 14.2%, 10.6% and 9.3% respectively. 
The number of the lower denominations in 
circulation rose at rates of between around 3% 
and 6% (see Chart 48).Chart 46 Number of euro banknotes in

2008In 2008 the total number of euro coins in circulation (i.e. net circulation excluding stocks 
held by the NCBs) grew by 7.9% to 82.3 billion, 
while their value rose by 5.7% to •20.4 billion. 
The 1 and 2 cent coins accounted for most of 
this increase. The share of the low-value coins, 
the 1, 2 and 5 cent coins, in the total number of 
coins in circulation remained stable at 59%. BANKNOTE HANDLING BY THE EUROSYSTEMIn 2008 the euro area NCBs issued 34.1 billion 
banknotes, while 33.2 billion banknotes were 
returned to them. The return frequency 7 of banknotes in circulation remained almost 
unchanged at 2.79, meaning that, on average, 
a banknote was checked for authenticity and 
circulation Þ tness by the fully automated 
banknote processing machines of the euro area 
NCBs around once every four months. Since 2004 the Eurosystem has conducted annual surveys with the aim of monitoring the 
condition of euro banknotes in circulation at 
the euro area level. In 2008 a trend towards an 
improvement in the condition of the banknotes 
in circulation was observed. The condition of 
the banknotes also became more homogeneous 
within the euro area, reß ecting the Eurosystem™s 
coordinated sorting/issuing policies. The NCBs 
identiÞ ed some 5.6 billion banknotes as un
Þ t for 
circulation and replaced them accordingly. The unÞ t rate,
8 at around 17.0%, remained close to the rate recorded in the previous year. 3.2 BANKNOTE COUNTERFEITING AND 
COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCECOUNTERFEIT EURO BANKNOTES 
The total number of counterfeit euro banknotes 
received by National Analysis Centres 9 in 2008 was around 666,000 10, which represented an increase from the relatively stable levels 
observed in previous years. However, the 
number of genuine banknotes in circulation also 
increased signiÞ cantly in 2008. Compared with 
the number of genuine euro banknotes in 
circulation, which reached 13.1 billion by the 
end of 2008, the quantity of counterfeits is very 
small indeed. Therefore, the probability of 
randomly receiving a counterfeit banknote from 
circulation remains very low. Chart 49 shows 
the trend in counterfeits removed from 
circulation, with Þ gures taken at half-yearly 
DeÞ ned as the total number of banknotes returned to NCBs in

2008intervals since the euro banknotes were launched. In 2008 the •20 and •50 banknotes 
were the counterfeiters™ biggest targets, between 
them accounting for about three-quarters of the 
number of counterfeits. Chart 50 gives a detailed 
breakdown of the distribution of counterfeits in 
terms of volume. The public can remain conÞ dent in the security 
of the euro: it has proven to be a well-protected currency, in terms of both the sophistication 
of its security features and the effectiveness 
of European and national law enforcement 
authorities. However, this conÞ dence should 
never give rise to complacency, and the ECB™s 
advice to the public remains to be alert to 
the possibility of fraud and to remember the 
ﬁfeel-look-tiltﬂ test.11 The Eurosystem continues to invest considerable effort in ensuring that 
both the public and professional cash handlers 
are well-informed with regard to the recognition 
of counterfeit banknotes. COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCEThe Eurosystem continued in 2008 to work 
closely with Europol and the European 
Commission (in particular the European Anti-
Fraud OfÞ ce, OLAF) in the 
Þ ght against 
counterfeiting of the euro. The Eurosystem is active, both in the EU and beyond, in training 
professional cash handlers in the recognition 
and handling of counterfeit banknotes. The Eurosystem participates actively in the work of the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence 
Group (CBCDG) (a working group of 31 central 
banks and note-printing authorities cooperating 
under the auspices of the G10). The group 
sponsors research into techniques designed to 
prevent the illicit reproduction of banknotes. 
The ECB hosts the International Counterfeit 
Deterrence Centre (ICDC), which acts as the 
technical centre for all CBCDG members. Its 
main role is to provide technical support and to 
operate a centralised communication system 
serving all parties involved in the Þ eld of 
counterfeit deterrence systems. The ICDC also 
maintains a public website 12 which provides information and guidance concerning the 
reproduction of banknote images as well as links 
to country-speciÞ c websites.

20083.3 BANKNOTE PRODUCTION AND ISSUANCE
PRODUCTION ARRANGEMENTSA total of 6.4 billion euro banknotes were produced in 2008, compared with 6.3 billion in 
2007. The allocation of euro banknote production continued to be based on the decentralised 
production scenario with pooling, adopted in 
2002. Under this arrangement, each euro area 
NCB is responsible for the procurement of 
an allocated share of the total requirement for 
certain denominations. Table 12 summarises the 
2008 production allocation. THE EXTENDED CUSTODIAL INVENTORY PILOT 

PROGRAMMEIn 2008 the Extended Custodial Inventory 
(ECI) pilot programme for euro banknotes in 
Asia, which had been established in 2007, was 
successfully operated by two large commercial 
banks active in the wholesale market for 
banknotes. An ECI is a cash depot maintained 
by a commercial bank that holds currency on a 
custodial basis. ECIs facilitate the international 
distribution of euro banknotes and provide 
statistical data on euro banknote circulation 
outside the euro area, as well as information on 
counterfeits found in their region. In view of the 
success of the pilot programme, the Governing 
Council decided in March 2008 to launch a three-
year ECI programme based on the experience 
with the pilot. Following a negotiated tender procedure, three wholesale banknote banks 
applied for the three-year ECI programme. One 
started operations in Hong Kong and another in 
Singapore in February 2009, and it is foreseen 
that the third will start ECI operations in Hong 
Kong in mid-2009. These are the main logistical 
hubs for trading euro banknotes in the East 
Asian region, which has the highest turnover of 
euro banknotes outside Europe. The Deutsche 
Bundesbank is the logistical and administrative 
counterpart for the ECI banks. Before the end of 
the three-year term, the Eurosystem will assess 
whether and where the ECI programme should 
be continued.ROADMAP FOR GREATER CONVERGENCE OF NCB 

CASH SERVICESFollowing the Governing Council™s adoption 
in 2007 of a roadmap which aimed to achieve, 
in the medium term, greater convergence of the 
cash services offered by euro area NCBs, the 
Eurosystem continued its work in this area in 
2008. Greater convergence is important because 
it will allow stakeholders Œ in particular those 
with signiÞ cant cross-border cash activities Œ to fully reap the beneÞ ts of the single currency, 
and will ensure fair competitive treatment. In 
view of the different national economic and 
geographical environments, the Eurosystem 
does not envisage a ﬁone-size-Þ ts-allﬂ cash 
supply system. The process of convergence 
will require some ß exibility regarding customer requirements, the cash infrastructure and 
transitional periods for implementation. The Eurosystem has also been working on a number of further steps, including an electronic 
data exchange with credit institutions for cash 
lodgements and withdrawals and banknote 
packaging standards for the free-of-charge NCB 
cash services. Consultations with stakeholders 
have been conducted at both the national and 
the European level, in particular with regard 
to the issue of common banknote packaging, 
in view of the possible operational and cost 
implications.Technological developments with regard to banknote processing machines now allow Table 12 Allocation of euro banknote

2008banknotes to be read and processed irrespective of the way in which they are fed into the machine. 
In time NCBs will introduce these improvements 
free of charge, as foreseen in the roadmap.THE SECOND SERIES OF EURO BANKNOTESIn 2005 the ECB started work on the 
development of a new series of euro banknotes. 
The functional and technical requirements 
were established and the security features to 
be included in the new series of banknotes 
were developed. In 2008 work focused on the 
further development of the design and security 
features of the banknotes and the integration 
of the security features into the design. The 
development of the origination materials, the 
master materials used for banknote production, 
also started in 2008. The design of the second series of euro banknotes will be based on the ﬁages and styles of Europeﬂ 
theme and will include the most important design 
elements from the Þ rst series of banknotes. As 
the design and development of the origination 
materials is an iterative process, this work 
will continue in 2009. All major stakeholders 
involved in the cash cycle are being consulted 
and kept informed of the progress made during 
the development process. The new series will 
be launched over a period of several years, with 
the Þ rst denomination expected to be issued in a 
few years™ time. The exact launch date will be 
determined at a later stage. The ECB will inform 
the public well in advance about the modalities 
of the introduction of the new banknotes. The 
NCBs will redeem euro banknotes from the Þ rst series for an unlimited period of time.123ECBAnnual Report
2008The ECB, assisted by the NCBs, develops, collects, compiles and disseminates a wide range 
of statistics which support the monetary policy 
of the euro area and various tasks of the ESCB. 
They are also used increasingly by the Þ nancial markets, the media and the general public. 
The regular provision of euro area statistics 
in 2008 proceeded in a smooth and timely 
manner. A major achievement was the adoption 
by the Governing Council of an improved 
legal framework that will signiÞ cantly enrich 
euro area monetary and Þ nancial statistics, in 
particular through the increased availability 
of data on loan sales and loan securitisations. 
Another key development was the adoption 
of the medium-term work programme for the 
ECB™s statistical function, which will guide 
the production of ESCB statistics for the period 
2009-12. Finally, the ECB, in close collaboration 
with the NCBs, continued to contribute to the 
further harmonisation of statistical concepts in 
Europe and to the review of global and European 
statistical standards.4.1 NEW OR ENHANCED EURO AREA STATISTICS
The legal framework for the collection of 
monetary and Þ nancial statistics was enhanced 
with a new ECB Regulation concerning 
statistics on the assets and liabilities of Þ nancial vehicle corporations engaged in securitisation 
transactions 13. In addition, the ECB™s legal acts on the collection of statistics from MFIs 
were amended to address new requirements 
(owing to Þ nancial innovation, for example) for balance sheet statistics 14, statistics on interest rates on deposits and loans vis-à-vis households 
and non-Þ nancial corporations 
15 and statistics on securitisations 16. These regulations also address additional statistical requirements that 
have resulted from the Þ nancial turmoil, in 
particular with regard to the measurement of 
synthetic securitisation as a means of credit 
risk transfer. The reporting of these additional 
statistics is scheduled to begin in mid-2010 
(in order to provide NCBs and reporting agents 
with the necessary time to implement the new 
reporting schemes), with the exception of MFI securitisation and Þ nancial vehicle corporation 
statistics, for which data will be reported 
from December 2009. The development of 
these regulations involved a comprehensive 
assessment of the merits of the new statistics 
and their estimated costs, for both reporting 
agents and NCBs, in order to ensure that the 
highest-priority user requirements can be met at 
a reasonable cost.The Governing Council also adopted a recast Guideline on monetary, Þ nancial institution and 
market statistics, which consolidates previous 
amendments and now includes further provisions 
for these statistics. Further reÞ nements to the 
ECB™s legal framework comprised amendments 
to the ECB Guidelines on the statistical reporting 
requirements in the Þ eld of government 
Þ nance statistics (abolishing the remaining derogations) 
and of quarterly Þ nancial accounts (to improve 
the efÞ ciency of the data 
ß ows). With regard to statistics on the assets and 
liabilities of investment funds, the NCBs began 
providing the ECB with new harmonised data as 
of February 2009, using December 2008 as the 
reference period.17Since June 2008 further statistics on the 
circulation of euro banknotes and coins have 
been released in the statistics section of the 
ECB™s website (for example, monthly data 
on outstanding amounts and ß ows of euro 
banknotes and coins in circulation and data on 
the number and value of banknotes checked for A preliminary list of Þ nancial vehicle corporations had already 
13 been compiled, which made it possible to start work on cross-checking with other datasets and making a limited 
preliminary analysis of the recent developments in this Þ eld.Regulation ECB/2008/32 of 19 December 2008 concerning 14 the balance sheet of the monetary Þ nancial institutions sector 
(recast).
A regulation amending Regulation ECB/2001/18 concerning 15 statistics on interest rates applied by monetary Þ nancial institutions to deposits and loans vis-à-vis households and non-
Þ nancial corporations will soon be published.
Regulation ECB/2008/30 of 19 December 2008 concerning 16 statistics on the assets and liabilities of Þ nancial vehicle 
corporations engaged in securitisation transactions.

2008authenticity and Þ tness). Enhanced harmonised 
competitiveness indicators for the euro area countries based on consumer price indices, GDP 
deß ators and unit labour costs are now also 
published regularly within the Eurosystem joint 
dissemination framework. Their purpose is to 
provide comparable measures of price and cost 
competitiveness developments in the euro area 
countries that are also consistent with changes 
in the real effective exchange rates of the euro. The ECB continued to improve its Short-Term European Paper (STEP) statistics. These 
show primary market volumes and yields for 
short-term debt securities that have been issued 
in the context of programmes which have 
received the STEP label (see also Section 3 
of Chapter 4). Detailed ß ow and stock data, 
including the outstanding amounts of the 
individual STEP programmes, are expected to 
be published in the Þ rst half of 2009.
New MFI balance sheet statistics to underpin 
the monetary analysis have also been released. 
For instance, following the improvements in 
the availability of Þ nancial accounts data, the 
ECB has started publishing sectoral statistics 
on holdings of M3 instruments by non-Þ nancial corporations, households (including non-proÞ t institutions serving households), other Þ nancial intermediaries (including investment funds), and 
insurance corporations and pension funds. Time 
series are also available from the Þ rst quarter 
of 1999. In September 2008 the Governing Council approved the conduct of a Eurosystem survey on 
euro area household Þ nance and consumption. 
This project aims to Þ ll a signi
Þ cant gap in the 
availability of data on the Þ nancial situation 
of segments of the household sector, thereby 
supplementing the macroeconomic statistics (for 
instance by providing information on the assets 
and liabilities of households throughout the euro 
area). A survey on access to Þ nance by small and 
medium-sized enterprises is also in preparation. 
It is planned that this survey will be undertaken 
in cooperation with the European Commission. 
The ESCB also continued its work on enhancing the Centralised Securities Database (CSDB). 
The CSDB contains benchmark information on 
individual securities that are relevant for ESCB 
statistical purposes and plays a pivotal role in 
the move towards security-by-security reporting. 
Systems which collect data on an item-by-item 
basis have the potential to signiÞ cantly alleviate 
the reporting burden for respondents while 
improving the quality and ß exibility of euro area 
statistics. The database is already used by several 
NCBs to compile national Þ nancial statistics, and 
further developments are under way. 4.2 OTHER STATISTICAL DEVELOPMENTS
The two framework regulations on the collection, 
compilation and dissemination of statistics in 
Europe, issued by the European Statistical 
System (the ESS, a partnership between Eurostat 
and the national statistical institutes) and by the 
ESCB respectively, are being updated. Close 
cooperation between the ESCB and the ESS has 
resulted in various mirroring provisions in the 
two draft legal acts, in particular concerning the 
exchange of conÞ dential statistical information 
between the ESCB and the ESS. The ECB 
issued a recommendation for a Council 
regulation amending Regulation (EC) 
No 2533/98 on the collection of statistical 
information by the ECB in September 2008.18 Since 2007 the ECB and Eurostat have 
regularly published quarterly, integrated, 
non-Þ nancial and 
Þ nancial euro area sector 
accounts. In 2008 work began on enhancing 
the timeliness, completeness and consistency of 
this comprehensive macroeconomic accounting 
framework.The dissemination of statistics was improved through the publication of additional tables 
on euro area statistics and all corresponding 
national data on the websites of both the 
ECB and the NCBs. The extensions covered: 
i) lists of MFIs, ii) MFI interest rate statistics, http://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/18 c_25120081003en00010005.pdf125ECBAnnual Report
2008iii) payments statistics and iv) detailed data on the HICP and GDP. The ECB™s Statistical 
Data Warehouse (SDW) is an increasingly 
popular tool for accessing euro area statistics 
on the internet. In 2008 more Þ nancial market 
statistics were incorporated into the SDW 
and the number of SDW users doubled to 
around 40,000 per month. The launch of a new 
interactive visualisation tool for monitoring 
inß ation on the ECB™s website is also part of 
a better communication strategy with regard 
to euro area statistics. Finally, a wider range 
of statistics and indicators was presented in 
various regular ECB publications, such as 
the ﬁEuro money market surveyﬂ, the report 
entitled ﬁFinancial integration in Europeﬂ and 
the Financial Stability Review. Several documents published in 2008 served to raise awareness about ECB and ESCB statistics, 
their governance and their quality. The ECB 
Statistical Quality Framework and quality 
assurance procedures,19 the updated publication ﬁECB statistics Œ an overviewﬂ 20 and the publication of the proceedings of the fourth 
ECB conference on statistics 21 are examples of the ECB™s transparency in this Þ eld.The ECB continued to cooperate closely with 
Eurostat and other international organisations 
(for example, in the preparation of the joint 
2008 ﬁStatus report on information requirements 
in EMUﬂ and in the revision of Eurostat™s 
ﬁESA95 manual on government deÞ cit and 
debtﬂ) and played an important role in the 
update of global statistical standards (with the 
work on the System of National Accounts 93, 
the IMF™s Balance of Payments Manual and the 
OECD Benchmark DeÞ nition of Foreign Direct 
Investment). The ECB supports Eurostat in the 
revision of the ESA 95. The ESA 95 guides a 
series of policy decisions at the European level. 
The ECB also supports and implements global 
technical standards for data exchange. Together 
with the NCBs, the IMF and the BIS, it also 
developed a handbook on securities statistics. 
Finally, the ECB released an update of its 
ﬁGovernment Þ nance statistics guideﬂ.
22 Statistics for the euro area were adapted to 
account for the entry of Cyprus and Malta on 
1 January 2008. No problems were encountered 
thanks to the long-term preparation undertaken 
by these countries, even before they joined the 
EU, in close cooperation with the ECB and 
other Member States. In addition, as in previous 
years, statistics played an important role in 
monitoring the convergence of EU Member 
States that do not yet belong to the euro area. 
The ECB, together with the central banks of 
these Member States, also assisted Eurostat 
with the provision of long-term interest rate 
and exchange rate statistics, and collected and 
compiled additional statistics supplementing 
the four primary convergence indicators in the 
ECB™s 2008 Convergence Report (see Section 1 
of Chapter 3). 4.3 THE MEDIUM-TERM WORK PROGRAMME FOR 
THE ECB’S STATISTICAL FUNCTION (2009-12) 
The medium-term work programme for the 
ECB™s statistical function (2009-12) was 
published on the ECB™s website in July 2008.23 It is the result of a detailed analysis and aims to 
further increase the efÞ ciency and effectiveness 
of the collection and compilation of euro area 
statistics, with a view to using the resulting 
efÞ ciency gains to close some remaining gaps. 
Improvements are expected to be made in the 
form of, among other things: i) more detailed 
securities holdings statistics, ii) better data on 
credit derivatives, iii) the compilation of timely 
quarterly statistics on insurance corporations 
and pension funds and iv) the enhanced re-use 
of available micro-data for statistical purposes. 
The latter include data derived from corporate 
Þ nancial statements held in national central 
balance sheet ofÞ ces and information available

2008from central credit registers. Furthermore, work is being undertaken, together with the Committee 
of European Banking Supervisors, to achieve, 
where possible, some reconciliation between 
supervisory and statistical requirements for 
credit institutions. The ESCB also continues to 
assess the statistical needs resulting from the 
Þ nancial turmoil. This strategy for the medium 
term will require intensiÞ ed cooperation among 
all involved parties, i.e. the statistics departments 
of the NCBs and the ECB, as well as external 
partners such as statistical institutes, supervisors 
and representatives of the Þ nancial industry.
127ECBAnnual Report
2008The main functions of research at the ECB, as well as in the Eurosystem as a whole, are: to 
provide research results that are relevant for the 
formulation of policy advice on monetary policy 
and other Eurosystem tasks, and to design and 
implement the respective models and analytical 
tools; to maintain and use econometric models 
for economic forecasts and the comparison 
of the effects of alternative policies; and to 
communicate with the academic community, 
for example through the publication of research 
results in peer-reviewed scientiÞ c journals and 
the organisation of research conferences.5.1 RESEARCH PRIORITIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Economic research at the ECB is performed in a 
decentralised way: all business areas can conduct 
research projects according to their needs and 
expertise. The Directorate General Research, as 
well as producing high-quality research itself, 
plays a central role in coordinating research. The 
Directorate chairs the Research Coordination 
Committee, which aligns research activities at 
the ECB with the requirements of the institution. 
The Committee sets broad priority areas for 
each year.The following Þ elds were identi
Þ ed as the main 
research priorities for 2008: forecasting and model development; improving the monetary 
analysis; understanding the transmission 
mechanism of monetary policy; Þ nancial stability; the efÞ ciency of the European 
Þ nancial system; and international and Þ scal issues.
In the area of forecasting and model 
development, a number of existing projects 
were continued in 2008 and some new ones 
were launched. The New Area-Wide Model 
(NAWM) was introduced into the projection 
exercises and was used both in the construction 
of the central projections and for scenario 
analysis. The Christiano-Motto-Rostagno model 
was further developed and was used in a number 
of policy exercises focusing on the behaviour 
of Þ nancial markets. Both are examples of the 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models that are becoming increasingly common 
in policy work at central banks. Other DSGE 
models were developed in house to tackle 
speciÞ c policy issues. Work initiated in 2006-07 
on short-term forecasting tools was brought to 
fruition in 2008, with the introduction of these 
tools into the regular economic assessment and 
policy preparation work. Research work on 
existing and new forecasting tools will continue 
in 2009. A new method for the construction of projection ranges was introduced in the course 
of 2008 and used in the ECB/Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic projections published in 
September and December. Forecast uncertainty 
will be a topic of interest also in 2009.Research on monetary analysis concentrated on the development and use of quantitative methods 
for monetary analysis, with an emphasis on 
providing high-quality analytical tools for the 
preparation of policy decisions. Work focused 
on developing money-based indicator models 
for inß ation and on analysing money demand, 
as well as on designing monetary scenarios 
from a structural perspective. In this context, 
the Christiano-Motto-Rostagno model was used 
extensively. Particular attention was paid to the 
use of different structural models and other tools 
as cross-checking devices.With regard to the monetary policy transmission mechanism, the Wage Dynamics Network 
(WDN), which consists of ESCB researchers, 
presented the results of its work at a conference 
in June 2008. The WDN investigates the features 
and sources of wage dynamics in the euro area 
and their relationship with prices, at both the 
aggregate and the micro level. One important 
achievement of the network in 2008 was a 
survey it conducted, covering 17 countries, on 
wages, labour costs and price-setting behaviour 
at the Þ rm level. 
The euro area-wide household Þ nance and 
consumption survey (see Section 4 of this 
chapter), prepared by a Eurosystem network, 
will cover micro-level information on a wide 5 ECONOMIC RESEARCH 
128ECBAnnual Report
2008range of household decisions related to the holding of real and Þ nancial assets, the taking 
of debt, risk attitudes, employment, income, 
pensions, intergenerational transfers, gifts, 
consumption and savings. Data collection 
is expected to start in early 2009 in a number 
of euro area countries. It is expected that 
anonymised euro area micro-data on household 
Þ nance and consumption will also be made 
available to the research community in the 
future. Related research on household Þ nance and consumption was presented at a conference 
organised by the Center for Financial Studies 
and the ECB in September 2008. Other topics 
analysed within this area of research were central 
bank communication policies, the monitoring of 
Þ nancial markets, housing markets, the role of 
banks and credit in the monetary transmission 
mechanism, and heterogeneity in the euro area 
from various perspectives.Financial stability issues and their impact on monetary policy were also explored, particularly 
in the context of work carried out for the ECB™s 
Financial Stability Review. The Þ nancial system 
was analysed along two dimensions: its degree 
of integration and the evolution of capital 
markets. The interaction of credit and market 
risks was also covered.Regarding research on payment and settlement systems, the ECB joined forces with several 
interested central bankers (from the Bank of 
England, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago, the Bank of Canada 
and De Nederlandsche Bank) and academics to 
establish an informal Payment Economics 
Network. This network promotes awareness of 
the research undertaken on payment and 
securities settlement systems and reinforces the 
link between research and practice in this Þ eld. The network™s website 24 provides links to working papers, relevant policy documents, 
details on upcoming and past conferences, and 
information on research projects in this area.Under the research priority related to international issues, the main areas of interest were global imbalances, on which a high-
level seminar was organised in 2008, and the 
international role of the euro. With regard to 
the latter, work focused on the relationship 
between currency invoicing and exchange rate 
pass-through. The results of this work will be 
integrated into the report entitled ﬁReview of the 
international role of the euroﬂ. In the context of 
this research priority, an international extension 
of the NAWM was developed.5.2 RESEARCH DISSEMINATION: PUBLICATIONS 
AND CONFERENCESAs in previous years, ECB staff research was 
published in the ECB™s Working Paper Series 
and Occasional Paper Series. 141 Working 
Papers and 22 Occasional Papers were published 
in 2008. A total of 116 Working Papers were 
written or co-written by ECB staff, many with 
Eurosystem economists, while the remainder 
were written by external visitors attending 
conferences and workshops, working in the 
context of research networks or following a 
prolonged stay at the ECB for the completion 
of a research project. As is now the established 
norm, most of the papers are eventually expected 
to be published in leading, peer-reviewed 
academic journals. In 2008 ECB staff published 
more than 30 articles in academic journals.The Research Bulletin is a regular ECB publication which is used to disseminate research 
work of general interest to a wide audience. In 
2008 it focused on the credit market turmoil, the 
features of the euro area business cycle, housing 
wealth and consumption, and regional inß ation dynamics.The ECB organised or co-organised around 15 conferences or workshops on research topics. 
Co-organised conferences involved the Centre 
for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) and 
other central banks, both from the Eurosystem 
and from outside the Eurosystem. Furthermore, 
a large number of workshops and seminars http://www.paymenteconomics.org24 129ECBAnnual Report
2008were organised to disseminate research within the ECB. As in previous years, most of the 
conferences and workshops were related to 
speciÞ c research priority areas; the programmes 
for these events and the papers presented are 
available on the ECB™s website. The conferences and workshops covered a wide range of subjects. Financial topics were 
the focus of seven of them: two tackled the 
impact of the Þ nancial turmoil, one of them 
co-sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Chicago, and another dealt with Þ nancial integration. The remainder addressed different 
aspects of the workings of the money and retail 
transfer markets. The Þ fth conference of the 
International Research Forum on Monetary 
Policy (co-sponsored with the Federal Reserve 
Board, Georgetown University and the 
University of Frankfurt) in June 2008 analysed 
monetary policy topics. Other conferences 
examined data issues (co-sponsored with the 
CEPR through the Euro Area Business Cycle 
Network), labour markets and the Þ rst ten years of the euro.An additional mechanism for the dissemination 
of research was the organisation of seminar 

series, of which two were of particular 

relevance: the Joint Lunchtime Seminars, 

co-organised with the Deutsche Bundesbank 

and the Center for Financial Studies, and the 

Invited Speaker Seminars. The two series 

comprise weekly seminars at which external 

researchers are invited to present their recent 

work at the ECB. The ECB also organises 

research seminars outside the scope of these 

two series on a more ad hoc basis.130ECBAnnual Report
20086.1 COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITION OF 
MONETARY FINANCING AND PRIVILEGED 
ACCESSPursuant to Article 237(d) of the Treaty, the 
ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring the 
compliance of the 27 EU NCBs and the ECB 
with the prohibitions implied by Articles 101 
and 102 of the Treaty and Council Regulations 
(EC) Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93. Article 101 
prohibits the ECB and the NCBs from providing 
overdraft facilities or any other type of credit 
facility to governments and Community 
institutions or bodies, as well as from purchasing 
debt instruments directly from them. Article 102 
prohibits any measure, not based on prudential 
considerations, which establishes privileged 
access by governments and Community 
institutions or bodies to Þ nancial institutions. 
In parallel with the Governing Council, the 
European Commission monitors Member States™ 
compliance with the above provisions. The ECB also monitors the EU central banks™ secondary market purchases of debt instruments 
issued by the domestic public sector, the public 
sector of other Member States and Community 
institutions and bodies. According to the recitals 
of Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/93, the 
acquisition of public sector debt instruments 
in the secondary market must not be used to 
circumvent the objective of Article 101 of the 
Treaty. Such purchases should not become 
a form of indirect monetary Þ nancing of the 
public sector.The monitoring exercise conducted for 2008, based on information provided by the 27 NCBs 
of the ESCB and the ECB, conÞ rms that, with 
one exception, the provisions of Articles 101 
and 102 of the Treaty and the related Council 
Regulations were in general respected during 
the period under review.De Nederlandsche Bank reported an interday overdraft facility, leading to a situation of 
non-compliance limited to one day as regards 
the Treaty™s monetary Þ nancing prohibition, 
which was immediately corrected.6.2 ADVISORY FUNCTIONS
Article 105(4) of the Treaty requires that the 
ECB be consulted on any proposed Community 
or national legislation falling within its Þ elds of competence.25 The obligation to consult the ECB is not prejudiced in a scenario where a 
draft legislative provision is to be adopted under 
a fast-track procedure. In addition, the adoption 
of legislative provisions within a very short 
period of time following a consultation request 
should be permitted only in exceptional cases, 
such as the current period of market turmoil. All 
ECB opinions are published on the ECB™s 
website. The ECB adopted 92 opinions in 2008: 11 were in response to consultations by the 
EU institutions and 81 were in response to 
consultations by national authorities. This 
compares with 43 consultations in 2007. A list 
of the opinions adopted in 2008 and early 2009 
is annexed to this Annual Report. The following ECB opinions issued at the request 
of the EU Council are particularly noteworthy. 
The ECB issued an opinion 26 on a proposal to amend the Settlement Finality Directive 27 and the Financial Collateral Directive 28. The changes concern the protection under the Settlement Finality Directive of night-time settlement and 
interconnected systems owing to the expected 
increase in system interoperation resulting from 
the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 
and the European Code of Conduct for Clearing 
and Settlement. Among the categories of 
Þ nancial collateral that may be provided under 
The United Kingdom is exempt from the consultation obligation, 25 pursuant to the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, annexed 
to the Treaty, OJ C 191, 29.7.1992, p. 87.

131ECBAnnual Report
2008the Financial Collateral Directive, the proposal also includes credit claims eligible for the 
collateralisation of central bank credit operations 
in order to facilitate their use throughout the EU. 
In its opinion, the ECB welcomed the proposal 
and suggested in particular that the deÞ nition of ﬁsystemﬂ should be extended i) to expressly 
include systems established by an ECB legal 
act and ii) to allow the ECB to designate such 
ECB systems itself. The ECB also proposed 
that credit claims be included in the scope of 
the Financial Collateral Directive according 
to a single general deÞ nition that is not linked 
to central bank eligibility, and recommended 
harmonising some elements of the conß ict of 
law rules on credit claims in the EU. The ECB was also consulted on a proposal for a directive amending the Capital Requirements 
Directive 29 with respect to banks afÞ liated to 
central institutions and certain own funds items. The ECB issued an opinion 30 on a proposal for a directive amending the E-money Directive 31 which aims to open up the market for the issuance of electronic money, through 
electronic money institutions (ELMIs). The 
ECB supported the review but expressed serious 
concerns about changing the nature of ELMIs to 
ﬁÞ nancial institutionsﬂ, as de
Þ ned in the recast 
Directive 2006/48/EC, 32 since this would have far-reaching consequences for the conduct of 
monetary policy. The proposed directive also 
causes concern from a supervisory perspective, 
as it lightens the supervisory regime of ELMIs 
while simultaneously broadening the scope of 
the activities ELMIs may undertake. With regard to the Lamfalussy framework,33 as part of the process of clarifying and expanding the scope of the tasks of the Level 3 Committees 
(the Committee of European Banking 
Supervisors (CEBS), the Committee of European 
Insurance and Occupational Pensions 
Supervisors (CEIOPS) and the Committee of 
European Securities Regulators (CESR)), the 
ECB was consulted on a draft Commission 
decision establishing CEBS, replacing 
Commission Decision 2004/10 34. The ECB opinion 35 welcomed the proposed amendments and emphasised that its speciÞ c comments were 
without prejudice to possible future contributions 
to the broader debate, for instance in relation to 
the high-level group chaired by Jacques de 
Larosière. The ECB suggested a few 
amendments to the draft decision, in particular 
regarding the involvement of the ECB and the 
Banking Supervision Committee in certain 
CEBS tasks. The ECB recommended ensuring 
consistency between the provisions of the draft 
decision and those of the CEBS charter regarding 
voting procedures and suggested that the 
Commission take into account these comments, 
wherever applicable, for the draft decisions on 
the other two Level 3 Committees, on which the 
ECB is not being consulted.The ECB also issued an opinion 36 on a proposal for a regulation on cross-border payments replacing Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 37.While welcoming the inclusion of cross-
border direct debits in the proposed regulation, 
the ECB warned that balance of payments 
(b.o.p.) reporting issues would require careful 
consideration. In this context, it is essential that 
the user needs for euro area and national b.o.p. 
statistics be met and that the timely emergence 
of SEPA be safeguarded. The development of 
SEPA implies that b.o.p. reporting systems based 
mainly on payments data cannot be maintained, 
as these are for payments in euro within the The Capital Requirements Directive consists of Directive 2006/48/29 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 
relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit 

institutions (recast), OJ L 177, 30.6.2006, p. 1 and Directive 

2006/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of

2008EU. The reform of such systems may imply reduced reporting obligations for banks but also 
an increased reporting burden for non-banks, 
which should be kept to a minimum. It should 
also be ensured that b.o.p. statistics continue to 
be compiled with the high reliability, frequency 
and timeliness required for the ECB™s conduct 
of monetary policy. The ECB issued an opinion 38 on amendments to the Deposit-Guarantee Schemes Directive 39 aimed at improving depositor conÞ dence by 
increasing the minimum coverage amount of deposit-guarantee schemes and reducing the 
maximum delays in payouts of guaranteed 
deposits. The ECB supported these aims, while 
stressing that the credibility of deposit-guarantee 
schemes should be preserved by establishing 
efÞ cient operational processes for verifying 
claims and paying depositors, ensuring that 
sufÞ cient funding is available, and enhancing 
depositors™ awareness of the terms and conditions 
of deposit protection. Any arrangements must 
respect the monetary Þ nancing prohibition of 
Article 101 of the Treaty.40 The ECB expects to contribute to further work in this Þ eld in 2009.
The ECB continued to be consulted by national 

authorities on issues pertaining to the NCBs, in 

particular on amendments to the statutes of the 

Belgian, Bulgarian, Czech, German, Estonian, 

Spanish, Luxembourg, Hungarian, Romanian 

and Swedish NCBs.41 With regard to a proposed 
amendment to the Law of the Deutsche 

Bundesbank, the ECB noted that a Member 

State may not impair an NCB™s ability to 

employ and retain the qualiÞ ed staff necessary 
for the NCB to perform independently the tasks 

conferred on it by the Treaty and the Statute of 

the ESCB, and that an NCB may not be put in a 

position where the government may inß uence 
its policy on staff matters.42 The ECB indicated 
that it would welcome a revision of the 

proposed amendments, extending the powers 

of the Executive Board of the Deutsche 

Bundesbank to adopt staff regulations. In 

connection with the proposed amendments to 

the Statute of Banca Naional a României,  the 
ECB was of the opinion that they would 
considerably limit central bank independence, 

in particular owing to the requirement for 

parliamentary approval of Banca Naional a României™s annual report and the possibility of 

central bank staff being held personally liable 

for losses.43 In its opinion on the Þ nancial 
independence of Sveriges Riksbank in the 

context of capital structure and proÞ t distribution, the ECB emphasised that Sweden 

was obliged to have brought into force the 

necessary adaptations to comply with the 

relevant provisions of the Treaty and the 

Statute of the ESCB concerning central bank 

independence by the time of the establishment 

of the ESCB on 1 June 1998.44 Moreover, the 
ECB underlined that any legislative reform 

should aim to gradually achieve consistency 

with Eurosystem standards. In addition, the 

ECB submitted an own-initiative opinion on 

the reform of the Greek social security system, 

since the ECB considered that the proposed 

provisions could affect the status of the Bank 

of Greece as an independent authority.45 The 
Bank of Greece™s pension fund was integrated 

into a state-run pension fund and the Bank was 

required to contribute an amount of •23 million 

annually for a period of 15 years. The relevant 

provisions of the law would have warranted 

consideration with regard to the possible 

implications for central bank independence, 

including Þ nancial independence, and the 
prohibition of monetary Þ nancing.The ECB was consulted twice by Luxembourg 
on a draft law improving the legislative 
framework for Luxembourg as a Þ nancial centre 
and amending the Law on monetary status and CON/2008/70.38 Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the 39 Council of 30 May 1994 on deposit-guarantee schemes, OJ L 135, 31.5.1994, p. 5.

2008on the Banque centrale du Luxembourg.46 The opinions welcomed the strengthening of the Banque centrale du Luxembourg™s Þ nancial stability role and the establishment of a legal 
basis for the possible extension of emergency 
liquidity assistance by the Bank. In the area of payment and settlement systems, the ECB was consulted by Poland on a draft 
law amending the Law on trading in Þ nancial instruments and other legislation.47 In line with earlier opinions, the ECB recommended express 
provisions concerning the NCB™s competence in 
the Þ eld of oversight of payment and settlement 
systems.With regard to Þ nancial supervision, Finland 
consulted the ECB on a draft legislative 
proposal on the integration of Þ nancial and 
insurance supervision.48 The ECB supported a 
strengthening of the supervisory structure, but 

emphasised the need for safeguards for 

budgetary arrangements, the reimbursement 

mechanism, and auditing and reporting. In line 

with previous opinions, the ECB stated that 

cooperation and information-sharing between 

supervisory authorities and central banks was 

essential for the conduct of macro-prudential 

monitoring and the oversight of payment 

systems. In the area of Þ nancial stability, the 
ECB was consulted by Poland on a draft law 

amending the Law on the Bank Guarantee 

Fund.49 The ECB restated the criteria allowing 
the NCBs to extend credit to national deposit 

protection schemes and emphasised the 

importance of the effective coordination of 

such schemes.In the context of the global Þ nancial crisis, 
the ECB issued a large number of opinions 50 on national rescue measures concerning state guarantees, the recapitalisation of distressed 
banks, the purchase of banks™ assets and deposit-
guarantee schemes. In this connection, the ECB 
emphasised the importance of a coordinated 
approach in compliance with the concerted 
action plan adopted on 12 October 2008 by the 
euro area Heads of State or Government and 
with Community law (in particular with regard to state aid provisions), and stressed that the 
state™s role as shareholder should be limited 
in time.51With regard to the introduction of the euro in 
Slovakia, the ECB was consulted by Slovakia 
on draft national legislation on the dual display 
of prices and rounding rules.52 The ECB recalled the importance of the principles of price 
neutrality and continuity of legal instruments 
and recommended adopting an approach that 
was consistent with comparable cases related to 
methodologies and practices of rounding.As of 2008, information regarding clear and important cases of non-compliance with the 
obligation to consult the ECB on draft national 
and Community legislation is also included in 
the Annual Report. In addition to the reform 
of the Greek social security system, on which 
the ECB issued an own-initiative opinion as 
described above, there were six such cases 
of non-consultation of the ECB on proposed 
national legislation in 2008. In two cases, the Bulgarian and Cypriot authorities failed to consult the ECB on legal 
provisions providing grounds for dismissal of 
the central bank governor in addition to those 
of the Statute of the ESCB. The Bulgarian 
Law on prevention and disclosure of conß icts of interests of 16 October 2008 provides that 
non-compliance with its provisions and the 
existence of a conß ict of interests are grounds 
for dismissal of public ofÞ cials, including

2008Cypriot Law imposes restrictions with respect to certain economic activities and beneÞ ts, non-compliance with which provides a ground 
for dismissal of the Governor of the Central 
Bank of Cyprus. Had the ECB been consulted, it 
would have made signiÞ cant critical comments 
as to the compliance of these provisions with 
Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB. The ECB was not consulted by the French authorities on two amendments to the draft 
law on the modernisation of the economy 
which further simpliÞ ed the statute of the 
Banque de France by, inter alia, abolishing the 
monetary committee of its General Council and 
transferring to the Governor responsibility for 
transposing ECB guidelines. Although the ECB 
would not have objected to these institutional 
changes, it should have been consulted since the 
provisions relate to the Banque de France.The Dutch authorities failed to consult the ECB on the Law amending the law on Þ nancial supervision. The Law states that in exceptional 
circumstances, De Nederlandsche Bank 
and the Autoriteit Financiële Markten may 
adopt temporary rules to foster the stability 
of the Þ nancial sector. In a letter to the Dutch 
Minister of Finance, the ECB noted that the 
draft legislation related to an NCB and rules 
applicable to Þ nancial institutions that materially 
inß uence the stability of 
Þ nancial institutions 
and markets, and that the ECB should therefore 
have been consulted.The ECB was not consulted by the Portuguese authorities on three legal acts adopted in the 
context of the Þ nancial turmoil. One assigned to 
the Banco de Portugal tasks such as assessing 
credit institutions™ requests for an increase of 
own funds and overseeing compliance with 
recapitalisation plans. The other two legal acts 
provided for the Portuguese state to stand as 
guarantor to the Þ nancing of credit institutions 
registered in Portugal, with the Banco de 
Portugal being one of the authorities responsible 
for reviewing Þ nancing requests and monitoring 
the enforcement of such state guarantees. 
Since the adopted legislation relates to an NCB and lays down rules applicable to Þ nancial institutions that materially inß uence the stability 
of Þ nancial institutions and markets, the ECB 
should have been consulted.The ECB was not consulted by the Romanian authorities on draft legislative provisions 
transposing Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory 
audits of annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts into Romanian law. Although this 
concerned the transposition of an EC Directive, 
the ECB should have been consulted since 
the provisions concerned Banca Naional a României.6.3  ADMINISTRATION OF THE BORROWING AND 

LENDING OPERATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN 

COMMUNITYIn accordance with Article 123(2) of the Treaty 
and Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 
332/2002 of 18 February 2002, the ECB continues 
to have responsibility for the administration of 
the borrowing and lending operations of the 
European Community under the medium-term 
Þ nancial assistance mechanism. In 2008 the 
ECB received a principal sum from creditors 
vis-à-vis the Community and paid the loan 
amount to the borrower country (Hungary). The 
total amount of outstanding Community lending 
operations with Hungary as at 31 December 
2008 was •2 billion (by comparison, there were 
no outstanding balances at the end of 2007).6.4 EUROSYSTEM RESERVE MANAGEMENT 
SERVICESIn 2008 a comprehensive set of services 
continued to be offered under the framework 
established in 2005 for the management of 
Eurosystem customers™ euro-denominated 
reserve assets. The complete set of services Œ 
which is available to central banks, monetary 
authorities and government agencies located 
outside the euro area, as well as to international 
organisations Œ is offered under harmonised 
terms and conditions in line with general market 135ECBAnnual Report
2008standards by individual Eurosystem central banks (the Eurosystem service providers). The ECB 
performs an overall coordination role, ensuring 
the smooth functioning of the framework. The 
number of customers maintaining a business 
relationship with the Eurosystem remained 
stable over 2008. With respect to the services 
themselves, there was a sizeable increase in 
customers™ total cash balances and securities 
holdings, particularly in the second part of the 
year. Following a customer satisfaction survey 
carried out in 2007, which conÞ rmed customers™ 
overall satisfaction, the Eurosystem commenced 
work in 2008 to further enhance the range of 
services available under the framework and the 
quality of service offered. Cashiers being trained at Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands Bank in Helsinki in September 2001CHAPTER 3ENTRY OF SLOVAKIA 
INTO THE EURO AREA138ECBAnnual Report
2008On 8 July 2008 the ECOFIN Council adopted 
a decision allowing Slovakia to join the euro 

area as from 1 January 2009, increasing the 

number of euro area countries from 15 to 

16. The Council™s decision was based on the 

convergence reports prepared by the ECB and 

the European Commission in May 2008, and 

followed discussions by the EU Council in the 

composition of the Heads of State or Government, 

an opinion of the European Parliament and a 

proposal from the European Commission. On 

the same day, the ECOFIN Council adopted a 

regulation irrevocably Þ xing the conversion rate 
between the Slovak koruna and the euro at SKK 

30.1260, the ERM II central rate at the time of the 

decision. On the day that the conversion rate was 

set, the Slovak koruna was trading close to that 

rate. During the Slovak koruna™s participation in 

ERM II, from 28 November 2005, its central parity 

was revalued twice against the euro, by 8.5% in 

March 2007 and by 17.6472% in May 2008. 
Slovakia™s economy has grown at very robust rates in recent years, following a period of 
sluggish economic growth below 2% in the 
late 1990s. The improvement in the growth 
performance over the past ten years has been 
supported by deep structural reforms and the 
ensuing signiÞ cant in
ß ow of foreign capital. 
Real GDP growth peaked above 10% in 2007, 
followed by a more moderate rate of 6.4% 
in 2008 (see Table 13). Slovakia™s economic 
performance over the past few years has been 
closely related to signiÞ cant improvements 
in its production capacity, in particular in the 
industrial sector. The majority of new plants, 
which are concentrated in the car and electronic 
industries, are export-oriented. Looking at the 
external environment, Slovakia has recorded 
signiÞ cant de
Þ cits in its combined current and 
capital account for most of the past decade. 
These deÞ cits, however, have to a large extent 
been Þ nanced by in
ß ows of foreign direct 
investment, with debt-creating ß ows playing 
only a secondary role. In the Þ rst half of the 
decade, large investment projects initially caused 
some deterioration in the current and capital 
account balances, reß ecting in particular imports 
of new technologies. This effect was, however, temporary, as signiÞ cant improvements in the 
export capacity of industry contributed to a 
reduction of these deÞ cits. The average current 
and capital account deÞ cit has stood at 5.5% of 
GDP over the past Þ ve years. 
The inß ation performance of the Slovak 
economy over the past decade has been relatively 
volatile. Changes in administered prices and 
indirect taxes contributed signiÞ cantly to this 
volatility. Following a period of high inß ation, annual HICP inß ation decreased gradually 
from 2004, reaching a trough of 1.9% in 2007, 
notwithstanding a temporary increase in 2006. 
This decline followed the adoption of an 
inß ation-targeting framework by Národná 
banka Slovenska. The moderation in inß ation was supported by the gradual appreciation of the 
Slovak koruna against the euro. Subsequently, 
Slovak HICP inß ation increased again, peaking 
in September 2008 at 4.5%, reß ecting to a 
signiÞ cant extent developments in global energy 
and food prices. Against the background of the 
signiÞ cant easing of global commodity prices, 
inß ation rates started to moderate again in the 
last few months of 2008 and in early 2009. For 
2008 as a whole, HICP inß ation stood at 3.9%. 
Notwithstanding signiÞ cant improvements, the 
labour market continues to be characterised 
by considerable structural rigidities. At the 
beginning of this decade, the situation in the 
labour market did not improve in spite of 
relatively robust economic growth. This changed 
in 2004, when substantial tax, social beneÞ t and labour market reforms were implemented, 
which, together with the ensuing sizeable inß ow of foreign capital, contributed to robust job 
creation. The unemployment rate also declined 
because of the outward migration of workers 
following Slovakia™s accession to the EU in 
May 2004. Despite these improvements, the 
unemployment rate has remained close to 10%, 
reß ecting the existing rigidities in the labour 
market. These rigidities contribute, in particular, 
to the high rate of long-term unemployment, an 
unfavourable skill mix among the unemployed 
and substantial disparities between regional 
labour markets.1 ECONOMIC AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS 
IN SLOVAKIA139ECBAnnual Report
2008Fiscal policy has become more supportive of the achievement of price stability over recent years 
in Slovakia. Starting from very high levels, the 
general government deÞ cit-to-GDP ratio fell 
from 12.3% of GDP in 2000 to 2.3% of GDP in 
2008. The excessive deÞ cit procedure that had 
been initiated upon Slovakia™s entry into the EU 
in 2004 was abrogated in June 2008. The general 
government debt-to-GDP ratio has also declined 
in recent years, falling from 50.3% of GDP in 
2000 to 28.8% of GDP in 2008. However, Þ scal deÞ cits in Slovakia are high considering the 
very strong economic growth recorded in recent 
years. Looking ahead, Slovakia must ensure that 
its budget deÞ cit is kept below 3% of GDP in 
a sustainable manner by implementing credible 
and sustainable consolidation measures, which 
would also allow the country to reach its 
medium-term budgetary objective.Monetary policy played an important role in stabilising the Slovak economy. In autumn 1998 
the exchange rate regime of the Slovak koruna 
was set to managed ß oating with the euro as 
the reference currency from January 1999, and 
Národná banka Slovenska adopted an implicit 
inß ation-targeting monetary policy strategy. On 
1 January 2005 the monetary policy strategy 
of Národná banka Slovenska was modiÞ ed to 
become an ﬁinß ation-targeting regime under 
the conditions of ERM IIﬂ. The Slovak koruna 
entered ERM II on 28 November 2005 and its 
central rate against the euro was initially set at 
SKK 38.4550. The standard ß uctuation band 
of ±15% was applied. Reß ecting improving 
macroeconomic fundamentals, the Slovak 
koruna appreciated signiÞ cantly and its central 
parity was revalued twice against the euro 
during its participation in ERM II.In the context of the inß ation-targeting framework in effect between 2005 and 2008, the monetary policy of Národná banka Slovenska 
was geared towards maintaining price stability. 
As a consequence, the mounting inß ationary pressures that started to emerge towards the 
end of 2005 initiated a period of monetary 
tightening. Národná banka Slovenska increased Table 13 Main economic indicators for Slovakia(annual percentage changes, unless otherwise indicated)1999200020012002200320042005200620072008

2008its policy rate in several steps by a total of 175 basis points, so that it stood at 4.75% in 
September 2006. The subsequent stabilisation 
of inß ation and the strong commitment of the 
newly elected government to the original euro 
adoption timetable helped to overcome this 
brief episode of economic instability. Moreover, 
renewed conÞ dence in the euro adoption plans 
and solid macroeconomic developments 
provided support for the exchange rate of the 
Slovak koruna, which started to appreciate 
gradually against the euro. In 2007 Národná 
banka Slovenska started to ease its monetary 
policy stance, reducing its policy rate in two 
steps by a total of 50 basis points to 4.25%. In 
the light of the expected euro adoption, Národná 
banka Slovenska followed the ECB™s interest 
rate decisions from October 2008, reducing its 
repo rate in three steps by a total of 175 basis 
points to 2.5%. Money market interest rates in 
Slovakia moved broadly in line with the central 
bank™s policy rate. Owing to excess liquidity in 
the Slovak banking sector, money market rates 
were below those in the euro area in the last 
few months of 2008. Long-term government 
bond yields have declined over recent years, 
reß ecting strong market con
Þ dence in economic 
developments in Slovakia. Now that it has adopted the euro, Slovakia can 
no longer beneÞ t from its currency appreciating against the euro, which helped to contain 
inß ation in the past. Following the adoption of 
the euro, the authorities should pursue ambitious 
economic policies on all fronts. Priority must be 
given to the achievement of further sustainable 
economic convergence. The preservation of 
a low-inß ation environment is crucial in that 
respect. In particular, the rigorous and credible 
implementation of Þ scal policy in line with 
the Stability and Growth Pact commitments 
is essential to contain inß ationary pressures 
in the economy. Despite the recent economic 
slowdown, the authorities should continue to 
avoid excessive Þ scal de
Þ cits and proceed with 
Þ scal consolidation so as to reach their medium-
term budgetary objective as soon as possible. 
Further efforts should be made in Slovakia 
to underpin external competitiveness and 
strengthen economic resilience. The functioning 
of Slovakia™s labour market must be further 
improved and efforts need to be made to tackle 
the high level of structural unemployment. 
There is also a need to improve the business 
environment in order to enhance productivity 
growth and preserve the country™s attractiveness 
for foreign capital. Box 11STATISTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE EURO AREA TO INCLUDE SLOVAKIASlovakia™s entry into the euro area on 1 January 2009 is the fourth occasion on which statistical 
series for the euro area have had to be amended to include additional member countries. The 
preparation of statistics for the enlarged euro area has been coordinated, where necessary, with 
the European Commission.The entry of Slovakia into the euro area means that Slovak residents have become residents of the euro area. This affects statistics for which euro area aggregates are not a simple sum 
of national data, such as monetary, balance of payments and international investment position 
statistics, as well as Þ nancial accounts, because transactions between residents of Slovakia and 
other euro area residents must now be consolidated.141ECBAnnual Report
2008As of January 2009 Slovakia is thus obliged to meet all the statistical requirements of the ECB, i.e. to provide fully harmonised and comparable national data.1 Since the preparatory work for new statistics requires a long lead time, Národná banka Slovenska and the ECB started the 
statistical preparations well before Slovakia joined the EU. After becoming a member of the 
ESCB, Národná banka Slovenska intensiÞ ed its preparations to ful
Þ l the requirements of the 
ECB in the Þ eld of monetary, banking, balance of payments, government 
Þ nance, Þ nancial accounts and other Þ nancial statistics. In addition, it had to carry out the necessary preparations for the integration of Slovak credit institutions into the ECB™s minimum reserve system and to 
fulÞ l the relevant statistical requirements.
For the data reporters and NCBs of the other euro area countries, the enlargement of the euro 
area means that since January 2009 they have had to report transactions (or ß ows) and positions 
with residents of Slovakia as part of the euro area data, rather than as transactions and positions 
with non-euro area residents. In addition, Slovakia and the other euro area countries all had to provide backdata with sufÞ cient geographical and sector detail, dating back as far as 2004, the year Slovakia joined the EU.
Regarding the publication of euro area statistics, the ECB has granted users online access to two sets of time series, one containing data for the current euro area (i.e. including Slovakia) as far 
back as available, and one linking the various compositions of the euro area, starting with the 
11 countries in 1999. 1 The statistical requirements of the ECB are summarised in the document ﬁECB statistics: an overviewﬂ, April 2008.
142ECBAnnual Report
2008Pursuant to Article 122(2) of the Treaty, the ECB reviewed the statute of Národná banka 
Slovenska and other relevant Slovak legislation 
for compliance with Article 109 of the Treaty. 
The ECB made a favourable assessment of the 
compatibility of Slovak legislation with the 
Treaty and with the Statute of the ESCB, as 
stated in its Convergence Report published in 
May 2008. The ECB and Národná banka Slovenska put in place a number of legal instruments with a 
view to ensuring the integration of Národná 
banka Slovenska into the Eurosystem on 
1 January 2009. The Eurosystem™s legal 
framework was adapted as a consequence of 
the decision taken by the ECOFIN Council 
on 8 July 2008 to abrogate the derogation of 
Slovakia 1. The introduction of the euro in Slovakia and the integration of the central bank 
into the Eurosystem also required changes to 
some Slovak legal instruments. By the end of 2007 Národná banka Slovenska™s statute had been brought into line with 
recommendations in the ECB™s 2004 and 2006 
Convergence Reports. Slovakia consulted the 
ECB on the draft amendments to the statute of 
Národná banka Slovenska on 20 July 2007 and 
the ECB adopted an opinion proposing certain 
changes, which were reß ected in the 
Þ nal version of the statute.2 The ECOFIN Council™s decision of 8 July 2008 
entailed amendments to Council Regulation 
(EC) No 974/98 to enable the introduction 
of the euro in Slovakia 3, and the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 694/2008 4 amending Regulation (EC) No 2866/98, which 
determined the irrevocably Þ xed exchange rate 
of the euro vis-à-vis the Slovak koruna. The 
Council consulted the ECB on its proposals 
for both these regulations, on which the ECB 
adopted an opinion 5. The ECB was also consulted on national legislation governing 
the euro changeover, payment and settlement 
systems, rounding rules and currency circulation 
in Slovakia.6 As regards legal preparations for the integration 
of Národná banka Slovenska into the 
Eurosystem, the ECB adopted the necessary 
legal instruments to provide for the paying-up 
of the remaining capital and the transfer of 
foreign reserves to the ECB.7 The ECB also reviewed its legal framework and introduced, 
where necessary, amendments resulting from 
Národná banka Slovenska™s membership of the 
Eurosystem. This included a review of Slovak 
legislation implementing the Eurosystem™s legal 
framework for monetary policy and TARGET2, 
which enabled Slovak counterparties to 
participate in the Eurosystem™s open market 
operations from 2 January 2009. The ECB also 
adopted a decision on transitional provisions for 
the application of minimum reserves by the 
ECB following the introduction of the euro in 
Slovakia.8 Finally, the ERM II agreement 9 was terminated for Národná banka Slovenska. Council Decision 2008/608/EC of 8 July 2008 in accordance 1 with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Slovakia of the single currency on 1 January 2009, OJ L 195, 24.7.2008,

143ECBAnnual Report
2008Following the ECOFIN Council™s decision of 8 July 2008 on the adoption of the euro by 
Slovakia on 1 January 2009, the ECB conducted 
technical preparations with a view to fully 
integrating Národná banka Slovenska into the 
Eurosystem. In line with the provisions of the 
Treaty, Národná banka Slovenska joined the 
Eurosystem with exactly the same rights and 
obligations as the NCBs of the EU Member 
States that had already adopted the euro.The technical preparations for the integration of Národná banka Slovenska into the Eurosystem 
covered a wide range of areas, notably Þ nancial reporting and accounting, monetary policy 
operations, foreign reserve management and 
foreign exchange operations, payment systems, 
statistics and banknote production. In the Þ eld of operations, preparations involved extensive 
testing of the instruments, procedures and 
technical systems for the implementation 
of monetary policy and foreign exchange 
operations. 3.1 MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS 
Following the adoption of the euro by Slovakia 
on 1 January 2009, 26 Slovak credit institutions, 
a list of which is published on the ECB™s 
website, became subject to the Eurosystem™s 
reserve requirements as from that date. The 
entry of Slovakia into the euro area changed 
the liquidity conditions in the Eurosystem only 
slightly. The aggregate reserve requirements of 
euro area credit institutions increased by less 
than 0.5% (•740 million). Net autonomous 
liquidity factors in Slovakia for the period from 
1 to 20 January 2009 were liquidity-providing, 
reducing the liquidity needs of the entire euro 
area banking sector by •7.21 billion on average. 
This liquidity-providing effect occurred despite 
the fact that the liquidity-absorbing monetary 
policy operations launched by Národná banka 
Slovenska before entering the euro area, which 
matured between 6 and 13 January 2009, 
were also treated as autonomous factors, as 
were debt certiÞ cates issued by the central 
bank which matured on 20 January. Taking all of these factors into account, the entry of 
Slovakia into the euro area reduced the total 
liquidity needs of the euro area banking sector 
by •11 billion, roughly equal to 1% of aggregate 
liquidity needs.Given the liquidity surplus, counterparties from Slovakia submitted bids for relatively 
small amounts in the open market operations 
conducted at the beginning of 2009: •1 million 
in the main reÞ nancing operation which settled 
on 14 January, and •15 million in both the three-
month and the six-month longer-term reÞ nancing operations which settled on 8 January. On entering the euro area, Národná banka Slovenska also adopted the collateral framework 
of the Eurosystem and reported •17.6 billion 
in assets located in Slovakia which were 
eligible for Eurosystem credit operations as of 
1 January 2009.3.2 CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECB’S CAPITAL, 
RESERVES AND FOREIGN RESERVE ASSETSUpon joining the ESCB on 1 May 2004, 
Národná banka Slovenska paid up 7% of its 
share of the subscribed capital of the ECB as 
a contribution to the ECB™s operational costs. 
In accordance with Article 49.1 of the Statute 
of the ESCB and the legal acts adopted by the 
Governing Council on 31 December 2008, 
Národná banka Slovenska paid up the remaining 
part of its subscription on 1 January 2009. Its 
total subscribed share amounts to •39.9 million, 
equivalent to 0.6934% of the ECB™s subscribed 
capital of •5.761 billion as at 1 January 2009.At the beginning of 2009, in accordance with Articles 30 and 49.1 of the Statute of the 
ESCB, Národná banka Slovenska, on the basis 
of its share of the ECB™s subscribed capital, 
transferred to the ECB foreign reserve assets 
equivalent to a total of •443.1 million (85% of 
which was in US dollar-denominated assets 
and 15% in gold). Národná banka Slovenska 
has opted to conduct the operational activities

the transfer of foreign reserve assets to the

2008THE LOGISTICS OF THE CASH CHANGEOVEROn 1 January 2009 Slovakia adopted the euro as its currency. After a dual circulation period 
of two weeks, the euro had fully replaced the 
Slovak koruna. To ensure the smooth introduction of the euro banknotes and coins, all relevant market players, 
in particular the banking sector, were involved 
in the changeover preparations. The national 
changeover plan provided all businesses and 
the general public with a timetable, well before 
•-Day. Building on the experience gained with 
the cash changeovers in Slovenia in 2007 and 
in Malta and Cyprus in 2008, the Governing 
Council adopted a new ECB Guideline on certain 
preparations for the euro cash changeover and 
on frontloading and sub-frontloading of euro 
banknotes and coins outside the euro area.10 The Guideline provides, for example, for the 
possibility of euro cash to be pre-distributed 
to micro-enterprises in accordance with very 
simple procedures in addition to the normal 
procedure applied in the previous changeovers. 
Each NCB joining the Eurosystem may decide 
whether or not to make use of the provisions 
contained in the Guideline. Following the ECOFIN Council™s decision of 8 July 2008 on the adoption of the euro in 
Slovakia on 1 January 2009, Národná banka 
Slovenska became eligible to borrow banknotes 
from the Eurosystem in preparation for the cash 
changeover and for the banknote requirements 
in 2009. For geographical and logistical reasons, 
the required 196.2 million banknotes, with a face 
value of •8.3 billion, were delivered on behalf 
of the Eurosystem by the Oesterreichische 
Nationalbank. The initial supply of 499 million euro coins, with a face value of •165.22 million, was minted by 
the Slovak Mint in Kremnica. The frontloading of euro coins and banknotes to Þ nancial institutions started in September and 
October 2008 respectively. Sub-frontloading to 
businesses began in November 2008. Národná 
banka Slovenska, banks and post ofÞ ces also 
made available coin starter kits (each containing 
coins with a face value of •16.60) to the general 
public as of 1 December 2008. These made exact 
payments in retail transactions possible, thus 
reducing the amount of small change required 
immediately after the changeover date. The frontloading and sub-frontloading operations allowed the delivery of the euro banknotes 
and coins to be spread over a longer period of 
time, thus avoiding supply bottlenecks. The 
frontloaded amounts were largely used for the 
timely adaptation of automated teller machines 
(ATMs) to the euro. Virtually all ATMs 
dispensed euro banknotes as of 1 January 2009. In connection with the introduction of the euro in Slovakia, euro area NCBs exchanged Slovak 
koruna banknotes against euro at par value from 
the Þ rst working day of 2009 until 
28 February 2009 as a free-of-charge service.11 The amount exchanged was limited to •1,000 
for any given party and transaction on any one 
day. Národná banka Slovenska will continue to 
redeem Slovak koruna banknotes for an 
unlimited period of time and coins until the end 
of 2013. THE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN ON THE 

INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO 
The ECB worked closely with Národná 
banka Slovenska to prepare a comprehensive 
information campaign in preparation for 
the introduction of the euro in Slovakia on 
1 January 2009. The logo ﬁ• Our moneyﬂ, which was based on the logo used successfully by the Eurosystem

Article 52 of the Statute of the ESCB requires that the Governing 11 Council of the ECB take the necessary measures to ensure that 
banknotes denominated in currencies with irrevocably Þ xed exchange rates to the euro are exchanged by the euro area NCBs

adopted a guideline on the exchange of such banknotes on 
24 July 2006.4 THE CASH CHANGEOVER IN SLOVAKIA
146ECBAnnual Report
2008was employed by Národná banka Slovenska in its communication activities relating to the 
introduction of the euro in Slovakia.The euro information campaign organised by the ECB and Národná banka Slovenska aimed to 
familiarise cash handlers and the general public 
with the visual appearance and security features 
of the euro banknotes and coins, as well as with 
the cash changeover arrangements. The combination of communication tools used in the campaign took into account the 
experience gained in past changeovers and 
comprised 17 different publications, including 
training materials for professional cash 
handlers. Národná banka Slovenska distributed 
over 7 million copies of the various publications 
(including a public information leaß et, euro 
conversion cards and other publications in 
four language versions) in the course of the 
fourth quarter of 2008. In December 2008 each 
Slovak household received a copy of the public 
information leaß et and two euro conversion 
cards. The euro conversion cards showed 
different images depending on the angle at 
which they were viewed. On the front, a series 
of 28 prices were shown both in euro and in 
Slovak koruna, while the reverse displayed the 
main security features of the •20 banknote. Several press and public relations events were held, including an ECB media seminar on 
4 September 2008, an exhibition on the euro 
banknotes and coins, which was launched 
on 21 September 2008 at Národná banka 
Slovenska, a euro conference in Bratislava on 
22 September 2008 and state celebrations on 
8 January 2009. The ECB co-Þ nanced the largest banner ever 
produced in Slovakia, which was displayed on the facade of Národná banka Slovenska™s 
building in Bratislava, while smaller copies 
of the banner appeared on the buildings of all 
the central bank™s branches throughout the 
country. Over 100 partners, mainly banks and 
public authorities, were given access to the 
high-quality print Þ les of the relevant ECB 
publications, which they were able to adapt and 
use in their own communication activities. Following contact with associations for the blind, the ECB developed a ﬁtalking cardﬂ for 
the visually impaired, in which an embedded 
MP3 Þ le played a recording containing basic 
information about the euro banknotes and coins. Willem F. Duisenberg accepting the Charlemagne Prize on behalf of the euro in Aachen on 9 May 2002CHAPTER 4FINANCIAL STABILITY 
AND INTEGRATION150ECBAnnual Report
20081 FINANCIAL STABILITY
The Eurosystem contributes to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent 
national authorities relating to the prudential 
supervision of credit institutions and the stability 
of the Þ nancial system. It also offers advice to 
these authorities and the European Commission 
on the scope and implementation of Community 
legislation in these Þ elds. 1.1 FINANCIAL STABILITY MONITORING 
The ECB, in collaboration with the ESCB™s 
Banking Supervision Committee (BSC), aims to 
safeguard the stability of the Þ nancial system.
1 Key activities are monitoring risks to Þ nancial stability and assessing the Þ nancial system™s 
shock-absorbing capacity. The principal focus is 
on banks, as they are still the primary 
intermediaries of funds. At the same time, the 
increasing importance of Þ nancial markets and 
other Þ nancial institutions and their linkages 
with banks means that vulnerabilities in these 
components of the Þ nancial system are also 
monitored by the ESCB. CYCLICAL DEVELOPMENTSIn 2008 the stresses on the euro area Þ nancial system, which had been sparked in 2007 by 
losses incurred by Þ nancial institutions around 
the world on securities backed by US sub-
prime mortgages, intensiÞ ed further. As the 
year progressed, euro area banks experienced 
further asset valuation write-downs, higher 
loan impairments and credit costs, as well 
as large falls in trading revenues. The main 
developments and the lessons that may be 
learned from this episode are treated elsewhere 
in this report (see Section 2 of Chapter 1), as 
well as in a number of other ECB publications, 
notably the Financial Stability Review. As uncertainty grew about the global economic outlook, with the balance of risks increasingly 
skewed to the downside, risk aversion among 
Þ nancial market participants rose, with most 
Þ nancial asset prices falling as a result. Credit 
market liquidity and funding conditions 
deteriorated markedly during the course of the year and securitisation markets became more 
or less inactive. Persistent liquidity stresses 
eventually gave way to deeper concerns about 
the creditworthiness and sufÞ ciency of capital 
buffers. In this environment, investors and 
creditors began to lose conÞ dence in the ability 
of some Þ nancial companies to meet their 
obligations. This left many key Þ nancial Þ rms facing mounting challenges in accessing short-
term funding and capital markets. Some of the 
world™s largest Þ nancial institutions suffered 
both rating downgrades and sharp drops in their 
share prices. This development ultimately forced 
several euro area and international Þ nancial institutions to consolidate or to seek additional 
support from shareholders or the government. 
However, for a number of international Þ nancial institutions, bankruptcy could not be avoided.Euro area banks initially faced the Þ nancial turmoil with their solvency positions generally well above regulatory minimum requirements 
following several years of strong proÞ tability performances. Although some large euro area 
banks were badly affected by valuation write-
downs on structured credit securities and related 
market stresses, which had persisted for more 
than a year, they seemed to be broadly resilient 
to adverse disturbances until the situation 
deteriorated considerably in September 2008.Euro area banks™ return on equity generally fell during the Þ rst half of 2008, burdened by 
mark-to-market losses. In addition, impairment 
charges on loans and securities rose signiÞ cantly while fee and commission income as well as 
trading revenues fell, given the challenging 
conditions in capital markets. Despite the fall in 
proÞ tability, regulatory capital ratios increased 
during the Þ rst half of 2008. This improvement 
Since the end of 2004 the ECB has published its Financial 1 Stability Review, a semi-annual report on the stability of the euro area Þ nancial system. In 2008 it also published the seventh 
edition of its report on ﬁEU banking structuresﬂ, as well as ad 
hoc reports on ﬁCommercial property marketsﬂ, ﬁThe incentive 
structure of the ‚originate and distribute™ modelﬂ, ﬁCovered 
bonds in the EU Þ nancial systemﬂ and ﬁEU banks™ liquidity 
stress testing and contingency funding plansﬂ. These publications 
present the main Þ ndings of the monitoring by the BSC of the 
structure and stability of the banking sector, and are available on 
the ECB™s website.151ECBAnnual Report
2008reß ected discretionary deleveraging of risk-
weighted assets by individual banks, a widespread raising of capital despite challenging 
business conditions and, to some degree, the 
impact of both the implementation of the 
Basel II Framework and prudential Þ lters.The prospects for proÞ tability to return to pre-
turmoil levels do not look very promising in the 

short term. SigniÞ cant further declines in the 
values of other structured Þ nance products Œ 
including US consumer asset-backed securities 

and euro area residential mortgage-backed 

securities Œ cannot be ruled out. Lower growth 

rates for loans to households and Þ rms, a virtual 
standstill in securitisation activities, and reduced 

income from fees and commissions as well as 

trading are likely to pose challenges to the Þ nancial 
performance of banks in 2009. In response, banks 

have tightened their lending standards and cut 

costs. Against this background, signiÞ cant policy 
actions were taken by the Eurosystem and by 

euro area governments to bolster market liquidity, 

conÞ dence and capital buffers. 
The Þ nancial performance of large euro area 
insurers deteriorated in the Þ rst half of 2008, 
with most insurers witnessing reductions in 
premiums compared with the same period 
of 2007. A signiÞ cant reason for this was a 
fall in demand for life insurance products 
following the equity and credit market turmoil. 
The Þ nancial market turbulence and knock-
on effects for the real economy will continue 
to pose further challenges for many insurance 
Þ rms. In addition, insurers which offer banking 
services or are part of a Þ nancial conglomerate 
continue to be affected by the challenges facing 
the banking sector. Global hedge fund returns were strongly negative across almost all investment strategies by the 
end of September 2008. Volatile asset price 
reversals, forced deleveraging and margin calls, 
sudden bans on short sales by public authorities 
and investor redemptions contributed to this 
weak performance. While the hedge fund sector 
is known to have deleveraged considerably since 
the start of the market turmoil, thereby reducing its vulnerability to further margin calls or 
unexpected cuts in bank credit lines, hedge funds™ 
vulnerability to the risk of investor redemptions 
appears to have grown during 2008 as investor 
redemptions tend to be sensitive to hedge funds™ 
performance. Looking ahead, if hedge funds 
increasingly fail to retain their investors, the 
possibility of further sizeable asset sales by the 
sector may represent a non-negligible threat to 
the stability of the Þ nancial markets.
STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
The major structural trends in the EU banking 
system are in line with those observed in 
previous years.2 Consolidation continued, despite 
showing signs of a moderate slowdown. Trends 
varied across the 15 older EU Member States, 
while the number of credit institutions in the 
countries that have joined the EU since 2004 
remained broadly unchanged, with Cyprus being 
a notable exception owing to the ongoing 
consolidation in the cooperative banking sector. 
Altogether, the number of credit institutions in 
the EU declined by 166 in 2007 (from 8,514 to 
8,348), while the corresponding Þ gure in the 
previous year was 175. At the same time, the EU banking landscape continued to be dominated by domestic credit 
institutions (which had a 71.3% market share), 
with the remainder equally divided between 
branches and subsidiaries of foreign institutions. 
It should be highlighted, however, that there are 
signiÞ cant differences among countries, with 
the newer Member States characterised by the 
prominence of foreign entities, especially those 
with a parent company in one of the older EU 
countries. It is noteworthy that, in contrast to the 
situation in 2006, branches of foreign institutions 
in the EU showed an increase in terms of market 
share of total assets. This was particularly true in 
the countries that have joined the EU since 2004, 
where the market share of foreign branches 
increased by approximately 1 percentage point, 
while that of foreign subsidiaries saw a decline 
of approximately 4 percentage points.The data in this section are taken from the ECB™s report entitled 2 ﬁEU banking structuresﬂ, which only contains data up to 2007.152ECBAnnual Report
2008With regard to merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, the total number of transactions 
declined in 2007. However, a signiÞ cant increase was recorded in the number of 
acquisitions by EU credit institutions of banks 
located in countries outside the EU, which have 
exceeded the Þ gures for domestic deals over the 
past three years. The value of M&As has been 
growing since 2003, with 2007 being the second 
consecutive year in which the total value of 
M&A transactions exceeded the peak recorded 
in 2000. Concentration increased, reß ecting, on 
the one hand, continuing market consolidation 
and, on the other hand, the dynamic growth of 
certain banking groups, partly as a result of their 
M&A activity. It should be noted that smaller 
countries tend to have more concentrated 
banking sectors, with the notable exceptions of 
Austria and Luxembourg, the former having a 
strong savings and cooperative banking sector, 
and the latter hosting a large number of foreign 
credit institutions. Finally, banking intermediation was strengthened, 
as evidenced by the fact that the total assets of 
credit institutions grew at a higher rate than 
GDP. However, the growth of total assets 
(10.7%) in 2007 at the EU level decelerated in 
comparison with previous years (2005: 13.7%; 
2006: 11.9%).3 It should be noted that this aggregate Þ gure conceals strong 
ß uctuations: the 
newer Member States experienced above average 
growth of nearly 25% in nominal terms, while 
the United Kingdom, whose Þ nancial sector 
accounts for approximately a quarter of the EU 
banking sector™s assets, reported only a 2.3% 
increase in total assets. With the structural 
changes in the Þ nancial system and the decline 
in investment funds and hedge funds, core 
commercial banks will become more central to 
credit intermediation.1.2 FINANCIAL STABILITY ARRANGEMENTS 
Initiatives were launched both internationally 
and in the EU to address the weaknesses of the 
overall Þ nancial stability framework revealed 
by the Þ nancial turmoil.
In April 2008 the Financial Stability Forum 

(FSF) proposed recommendations to enhance 

market and institutional resilience. In this 

context, authorities are expected to clarify 

and strengthen national and cross-border 

arrangements for dealing with weak banks, 

as well as to review and, where necessary, 

strengthen deposit insurance arrangements. 

In terms of bank resolution arrangements and 

cross-border crisis management, the Basel 

Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) 

carried out a review of national practices. 

Meanwhile, the FSF is developing a set 

of high-level principles for Þ nancial crisis 
management.In May 2008 the ECOFIN Council updated the EU roadmap on strengthening Þ nancial stability arrangements adopted in October 
2007. In accordance with this roadmap, the 
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 
cross-border Þ nancial stability among EU 
supervisory authorities, Þ nance ministries 
and central banks entered into force on 
1 June 2008.4 The BSC Œ through a dedicated task force Œ has been assisting the relevant 
authorities in the implementation of this 
MoU, focusing on implementing the common 
analytical framework for assessing the systemic 
implications of a Þ nancial crisis. In addition, the 
BSC has reviewed the key crisis management 
functions currently in place in the Member 
States, providing input on initiatives to review 
the tools at the authorities™ disposal. In October 2008 EU Member States took a number of initiatives to ensure that the design 
of national stabilisation measures to resolve 
the Þ nancial turmoil does not lead to negative 
It should be noted that this analysis is based on stock 3 on-balance-sheet data. The analysis of trends with regard to total assets would be improved by the availability of ß ow data 
on securitised assets (both publicly and privately placed). The 
lack of data on securitised assets has less of an impact on the 
analysis for the countries that have joined the EU since 2004, 
where asset securitisation is not so developed. In addition, for 
non-euro area countries, Þ gures are not exchange rate-adjusted, 
so developments could be partially inß uenced by changes in the 
exchange rate between local currencies and the euro.

2008spillover effects and that a level playing-Þ eld is 
maintained across countries. First, the ECOFIN Council decided on 7 October to increase the EU minimum protection for 
individual deposits to •50,000 for at least one 
year. As a result, the Commission adopted a 
proposal for the amendment of the Directive on 
deposit guarantee schemes on 15 October 2008. 
The Directive, with the amendments approved 
by the European Parliament and the EU Council, 
is expected to be published in the OfÞ cial Journal around March 2009. In particular, the 
Directive will increase the level of mandatory 
protection for individual deposits to •50,000 by 
June 2009 and further to •100,000 by end-2010 
unless the Commission reports that this would 
be inappropriate.Second, a set of ﬁEU common principlesﬂ 
were deÞ ned, which were complemented by 
more precise guidelines agreed at the summit 

of euro area countries in Paris on 12 October 

and subsequently endorsed by all 27 Member 

States at the European Council meeting of 

15-16 October. They determined, among other 

things, the common features for Member 

States™ interventions, including the guarantees 

applied to the funding and recapitalisation of 

banks.In the case of measures aimed at supporting 
ﬁliquidity-constrained solvent banksﬂ, it was agreed 

that government guarantees could be provided for 

new medium-term (up to Þ ve years) bank senior 
debt issuance. The criteria for determining which 

Þ nancial institutions are eligible to take part in the 
guarantee scheme must be non-discriminatory and 

include subsidiaries of foreign institutions with 

substantial operations in an EU Member State. 

The scheme should also be limited in amount 

and expire on 31 December 2009. Importantly, 

the Paris declaration states that governments 

must ﬁwork in cooperation with the European 

Central Bank so as to ensure consistency with 

the management of liquidity by the Eurosystem 

and compatibility with the operational framework 

of the Eurosystemﬂ.With regard to recapitalisation measures, 

Member States decided to make core capital 

available to relevant Þ nancial institutions, 
for instance by acquiring preferred shares. 

Although governments committed themselves to 

providing the appropriate amount of capital when 

needed, they will generally favour the raising of 

private capital.The European Council at its meeting of 15-16 October underlined the importance 
of cooperation mechanisms and announced 
the establishment of a ﬁÞ nancial crisis cellﬂ. 
This cell, in which the President of the ECB 
participates, aims to improve crisis management 
among EU Member States through measures 
including informal warnings, information 
exchange and an evaluation mechanism. The 
European Council also stressed the importance 
of regular meetings of national supervisors.Finally, the ECOFIN Council, at its meeting on 2 December 2008, speciÞ cally emphasised 
the need to establish, without delay, national 
schemes to support the banking sector in respect 
of guarantees and, in particular, recapitalisation 
plans. The European Commission was requested 
to work closely with the ECB on these issues.With the aim of enhancing the stability of the Þ nancial system and maintaining a level playing-
Þ eld, the Eurosystem issued recommendations 
on government guarantees for bank debt and on 
the pricing of bank recapitalisations. In 
December 2008 the European Commission 
adopted a communication on the recapitalisation 
of Þ nancial institutions, which also re
ß ected the 
ECB™s recommendations on this matter.5In February 2009 the ECOFIN Council agreed 
that, in order to safeguard banking sector 
stability, measures to deal with impaired assets 
could in speciÞ c cases complement government guarantees for bank debt and recapitalisations. 
These measures should remain consistent The communication was published in January 2009 (OJ C 10, 5 15.1.2009, pp. 2-10).154ECBAnnual Report
2008with the principles set out in October 2008, in particular with regard to: i) safeguarding 
Þ nancial stability and restoring the provision of 
credit and lending to the economy; ii) ensuring a 
level playing-Þ eld within the Single Market; and 
iii) containing the impact on public Þ nances. The 
Commission, in cooperation with the ECB, has 
provided elements of guidance in this respect at 
the EU level.155ECBAnnual Report
20082 FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
2.1 GENERAL ISSUES
Following the conclusion of the review of the Lamfalussy framework 6 for Þ nancial regulation 
and supervision, conducted by the European 
Commission with contributions from the 
Eurosystem, the emphasis in 2008 was on the 
implementation of the recommendations adopted 
by the ECOFIN Council in December 2007. First, the Level 3 Committees 7 amended their respective charters to introduce the possibility of applying qualiÞ ed majority voting. Although 
the committees™ decisions are not legally binding 
for their members, those who do not comply 
should at least explain their decisions publicly. Second, the Level 3 Committees enhanced their accountability by starting to transmit their yearly 
work programmes to the European Commission, 
the EU Council and the European Parliament to 
allow them to express their views on the key 
priorities and give policy advice on supervisory 
convergence and cooperation.Third, the Member States were invited to introduce a European dimension into the 
mandates of their national supervisors. The ECB 
participated in the discussions in the various 
European committees on how to implement 
the ECOFIN Council™s recommendations. 
On 14 May 2008 the ECOFIN Council asked 
the Commission to revise the Decisions 
establishing the Level 3 Committees to 
include speciÞ c tasks to foster supervisory 
convergence and cooperation. The Eurosystem 
on 7 November 2008 adopted an opinion on 
the revision of the Decision establishing the 
Committee of European Banking Supervisors 
(CEBS). Among other things, the ECB 
commented on the appropriate division of 
labour between CEBS and the BSC with regard 
to the risk assessment of the EU banking sector. 
While the BSC, in line with its mandate, focuses 
on identifying the main prudential risks for the 
Þ nancial system and the banking sector, CEBS 
concentrates on the proactive identiÞ cation of 
speciÞ c risks, supervisory concerns and possible 
policy actions. In addition to strengthening the Lamfalussy 
framework, authorities have launched a number 
of concrete initiatives at both the international 
and the European level to address systemic 
concerns and identify the possible long-term 
effects of policy proposals related to the revision 
of the current regulatory and supervisory 
framework. At the international level, the FSF 
undertook work to analyse the challenges that 
supervisors and regulators face with regard to 
the potential pro-cyclical effects of the capital 
adequacy regime, loan loss provisioning 
practices, compensation arrangements and 
the valuation methods applied by Þ nancial institutions.At the EU level, the President of the European Commission established in October 2008 an 
independent High-Level Group on EU Þ nancial supervision that made recommendations in 
February 2009 on strengthening European 
supervisory arrangements covering all Þ nancial sectors.8 The informal ECOFIN Council meeting on 12-13 September set up a working group, 
in which the ECB was represented, with a 
mandate to assess the range of policy responses 
that could help to reduce the cyclical swings 
inherent in the activities of the Þ nancial system. 
In addition, the ECB was asked to produce a 
regular report on the potential pro-cyclicality 
of capital requirements under the Capital 
Requirements Directive. To this end, the ECB 
works closely with the BSC and CEBS, and a 
preliminary report, which is based on qualitative 
information from competent authorities pending 
the availability of supervisory data series, was 
produced at the end of 2008. The Lamfalussy approach is a four-level process for approving 6 securities, banking and insurance legislation. For more details, see the report entitled ﬁFinal report of the Committee of 
Wise Men on the regulation of European securities marketsﬂ, 
15 February 2001, which is available on the European 
Commission™s website. See also the ECB™s Annual Report 2003, 
p. 111.
Level 3 of the Lamfalussy framework focuses on strengthening 7 supervisory convergence and cooperation. Three committees 
carry out this work: the Committee of European Banking 
Supervisors (CEBS), the Committee of European Securities 
Regulators (CESR) and the Committee of European Insurance 
and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS).

20082.2 BANKINGCAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DIRECTIVEThe Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) aims to safeguard the Þ nancial soundness of banks and 
investment Þ rms by closely aligning regulatory 
capital requirements with the underlying risks 
that these institutions face. In October 2008 the 
European Commission adopted a proposal to 
amend certain provisions of the CRD, to take into 
account, among other things, the lessons learned 
from the Þ nancial crisis. With regard to the 
large exposures regime, banks™ exposures to any 
single party will be restricted, resulting also in 
limitations in the interbank market. Furthermore, 
clear EU-wide criteria will be introduced for 
assessing the eligibility of hybrid capital, with 
the aim of improving the quality of banks™ own 
funds. In the area of risk management, revisions 
apply to liquidity risk management and the 
treatment of securitised products. With regard 
to the former, a number of provisions have 
been introduced, in line with the ongoing work 
of the BCBS and CEBS. With regard to the 
latter, provisions aim to improve transparency, 
strengthen the risk management processes 
of originators and investors alike, and better 
align incentives along the securitisation chain. 
Finally, the Commission™s proposal foresees 
the establishment of ﬁcolleges of supervisorsﬂ 
for all cross-border banks and a clariÞ cation of 
the role of competent authorities with the aim 
of strengthening the supervision of cross-border 
banking groups. The ECB was consulted on the 
draft proposal of the Commission. In providing 
its input, the ECB beneÞ ted from work carried 
out by the BSC in the context of two reports it 
published in the fourth quarter of 2008.In November the BSC published a report on EU banks™ liquidity stress-testing and contingency 
funding plans. The report contains a detailed 
description of liquidity stress-testing techniques 
and liquidity contingency funding plans, which 
are highly diverse across EU banks. It also 
analyses the adequacy of liquidity stress-testing 
techniques and liquidity contingency funding 
plans with regard to the absorption of liquidity 
shocks, in particular during the market turmoil, reaching the conclusion that there is room for 
improvement in both areas.In December the BSC produced a report on the ﬁoriginate and distribute modelﬂ, examining the 
development of the model both during the time 
of its growth in popularity and in the context 
of the turmoil in the Þ nancial markets. The 
report presents the incentive structure and the 
various conß icts of interest between the actors 
in the model. It proposes a number of market 
solutions and policy measures that could play 
an important role in reducing the effects of the 
conß icts of interest. 
ACCOUNTINGThe Þ nancial market turmoil has con
Þ rmed the importance of accounting standards from 
a Þ nancial stability perspective. In particular, 
issues related to the enhanced disclosure of 
exposure to structured products, the treatment 
of off-balance-sheet vehicles and fair-value 
accounting when markets become inactive 
or illiquid have been identiÞ ed by both the 
ECOFIN Council™s roadmap and the FSF as 
areas requiring attention.In response to a request by the FSF, the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) set up an Expert Advisory Panel, in 
which the ECB participates, which issued 
guidance on the application of fair-value 
accounting when markets became inactive at the 
end of October 2008. Another issue relates to the importance of ensuring a level playing-Þ eld globally with 
regard to accounting standards, in particular 
on both sides of the Atlantic. In this context, 
the IASB adopted decisions aimed at reaching 
consistency between the International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the US 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US-
GAAP) on the reclassiÞ cation of items across 
accounts. In addition, the IASB set up a High-
Level Advisory Group to help to ensure that 
reporting issues arising from the global economic 
crisis are considered in an internationally 
coordinated manner. Furthermore, the European 157ECBAnnual Report
2008Commission identiÞ ed key areas of divergence 
between the IFRS and US-GAAP and urged the accounting standard-setters to address these 
as a matter of priority. Following the positive 
opinions of the ECOFIN Council, the European 
Parliament and the European Securities 
Committee, the European Commission decided 
on 12 December 2008 that the generally 
accepted accounting principles of the United 
States, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and 
India would be considered equivalent to the 
IFRS as of January 2009. The Commission also 
announced that it would keep the situation under 
review and would report on its Þ ndings by 2011 
at the latest for the last four countries. The ECB 
is closely monitoring these developments. 2.3 SECURITIESSince the outbreak of the Þ nancial market 
turmoil, credit rating agencies have been widely 
criticised for their initial ratings of structured 
Þ nance securities, owing to the perception that 
their ratings did not fully reß ect the risks 
inherent in those securities. The FSF report on 
enhancing market and institutional resilience of 
7 April 2008 9 highlighted some weaknesses in rating models and methodologies and made a 
number of recommendations for further 
measures to enhance the quality of the rating 
process. In order to address such issues, on 
31 July 2008 the European Commission 
published for consultation a draft regulation on 
credit rating agencies. This draft regulation 
addresses the conditions for the authorisation, 
operation and supervision of credit rating 
agencies and aims to ensure that such agencies 
meet high standards of independence, integrity 
and quality in the performance of their tasks. 
The Eurosystem responded to the public 
consultation on 25 September 2008,10 broadly welcoming the draft proposal. It emphasised 
that an EU regulation on credit rating agencies 
should aim to increase the level of transparency 
related to the issuance of ratings and the ongoing 
surveillance of those ratings, ensure that the 
regulatory framework does not interfere with 
the content of ratings, and safeguard the integrity and independence of agencies by dealing with 
conß icts of interest. The Eurosystem suggested 
an EU regulatory and supervisory structure 
according to which credit rating agencies would 
still be formally authorised and supervised by 
the national supervisors, but this authorisation 
and supervision would follow a joint assessment 
process and be accompanied by a joint 
supervisory process. CESR could play a role in 
the coordination of the competent national 
authorities as regards both the authorisation and 
the implementation of enforcement action.Finally, the Eurosystem stressed that any coordination arrangements for the regulation 
and supervision of credit rating agencies should 
allow for an appropriate level of involvement 
by the Eurosystem, given that it has already 
established a Eurosystem credit assessment 
framework which monitors the performance 
and activities of agencies in the context of the 
implementation of monetary policy operations.Following a public consultation, the Commission published a proposal for a regulation on credit 
rating agencies in November 2008. http://www.fsforum.org/publications/r_0804.pdf9 http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/regulationcreditratingagencies10 2008en.pdf158ECBAnnual Report
20083 FINANCIAL INTEGRATION 
The Eurosystem has a keen interest in Þ nancial integration in Europe, as a well-integrated Þ nancial system enhances the smooth and 
effective transmission of monetary policy 
impulses in the euro area and has implications 
for the Eurosystem™s task of safeguarding 
Þ nancial stability. Financial integration also 
supports the smooth functioning of payment 
and securities settlement systems. Furthermore, 
Þ nancial integration, a priority objective of the 
EU, can help to promote the development of the 
Þ nancial system, thereby raising the potential 
for economic growth. The Eurosystem distinguishes between four types of activity through which it contributes 
to enhancing European Þ nancial integration: 
i) raising awareness of and monitoring Þ nancial integration, ii) acting as a catalyst for private 
sector activities by facilitating collective 
action, iii) giving advice on the legislative and 
regulatory framework for the Þ nancial system 
and direct rule-making, and iv) providing 
central banking services that also foster Þ nancial integration. The ECB continued its activities in 
all four areas throughout 2008. RAISING AWARENESS OF AND MONITORING 

FINANCIAL INTEGRATION 
In April 2008 the ECB published its second 
annual report on ﬁFinancial integration in 
Europeﬂ.11 The main purpose of this report is to contribute to the advancement of European 
Þ nancial integration and to raise public 
awareness of the Eurosystem™s role in supporting 
the Þ nancial integration process. The report 
Þ rst sets out the ECB™s assessment of the state 
of Þ nancial integration in the euro area, based 
on a set of quantitative indicators that are also 
published semi-annually on the ECB™s website. 
In 2008 the range of indicators was extended to 
cover the European market infrastructure. The 
report also contains in-depth analyses of selected 
issues, chosen on the basis of their importance 
to the EU™s Þ nancial integration agenda and 
their relevance to the ECB™s tasks. These special 
analyses covered four topics in 2008: concepts 
and measures of Þ nancial development, the 
Short-Term European Paper (STEP) initiative, the integration and development of mortgage 
markets in Europe, and the integration of large-
value payment and securities transactions. 
Finally, the report provides an overview of the 
Eurosystem™s contribution over the past calendar 
year towards achieving more integrated and 
developed Þ nancial markets in Europe.
Given that Þ nancial integration is expected to 
have implications for the development of the 
Þ nancial system and for economic growth, the 
ECB™s work on Þ nancial integration is closely 
linked to its wider analysis of factors supporting 
the functioning of Þ nancial systems. Work in 
this area continued in 2008,12 with the aim of setting out a conceptual framework for 
monitoring and assessing potential frictions in 
the Þ nancial systems on a regular basis. 
In 2008 the ECB also continued its involvement 
in the Research Network on Capital Markets 
and Financial Integration in Europe, run in 
cooperation with the Center for Financial 
Studies at the University of Frankfurt am Main. 
The network continued its series of conferences 
with academics, market participants and 
policy-makers, with the active participation 
of NCBs. The network completed its second 
phase in 2008, culminating in its second 
symposium on ﬁCapital markets and Þ nancial integration in Europeﬂ held in Frankfurt on 
13-14 February. The third phase started 
with the network™s 11th conference, hosted 
by eská národní banka in Prague on 20-21 October 2008, which focused on ﬁThe 
market for retail Þ nancial services: development, 
integration, and economic effectsﬂ. As in 
previous years, in 2008 the ECB awarded Þ ve ﬁLamfalussy Fellowshipsﬂ to young researchers 
in the context of the network. The network™s 
current priorities are: i) Þ nancial systems as risk 
managers, risk distributors and risk creators, 
ii) the integration and development of retail 
Þ nancial services and the promotion of

2008innovative Þ rms, and iii) 
Þ nancial modernisation 
and governance and the integration of the European Þ nancial system into global capital 
markets. ACTING AS A CATALYST FOR PRIVATE SECTOR 

ACTIVITIES 
Progress in European Þ nancial integration 
depends to a large extent on private sector 
initiatives aiming to make use of the existing 
opportunities for cross-border business. Public 
authorities support such private efforts. In 2008 the Eurosystem continued to strongly support the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) 
initiative, which allows individuals, corporations 
and public administrations to make cashless 
payments in euro throughout the euro area and 
the other SEPA countries from a single account 
anywhere in SEPA, using a single set of payment 
instruments, as easily, efÞ ciently and safely 
as they can make them today at the national 
level. SEPA is a move towards an integrated 
payments market in Europe which will bring 
substantial economic beneÞ ts to society. SEPA 
is the logical consequence of the introduction of 
the euro in, currently, 16 countries in Europe. The successful launch of the SEPA credit transfer in January 2008 marked the initiative™s 
Þ rst major milestone. Since then, the 
Þ rst beneÞ ts of SEPA have materialised for banks 
and, more importantly, have started to reach the 
end-users of payment services. The Eurosystem 
has invited the operators of infrastructures to 
assess their SEPA compliance on a regular basis. 
Most automated clearing houses which process 
credit transfers in euro are now compliant 
with the credit transfer scheme, and several of 
them have made the step from offering purely 
domestic operations towards providing services 
on a pan-European basis. However, as set out in 
the sixth progress report on SEPA issued by the 
Eurosystem in November 2008, the migration 
process is still too slow and measures should be 
taken to accelerate it.The SEPA framework for card payments was also put in place in January 2008, but more effort is still needed in this Þ eld. The SEPA framework 
for cards should bring about greater choice and 
efÞ ciency through the gradual elimination of 
legal, technical and scheme-imposed obstacles, 
as well as through increased competition in 
the Þ elds of issuing, acquiring, acceptance and 
processing. The migration to chip cards with 
a personal identiÞ cation number (PIN), an 
important SEPA building block, advanced well 
in 2008. Several card schemes adapted their rules 
to the SEPA requirements. However, doubts 
remain about whether all card schemes have 
effectively separated their processing activities 
from their scheme management functions. The 
Eurosystem expects at least one additional 
European card scheme to emerge in the coming 
years which meets its requirements and those of 
cardholders, banks, merchants and competition 
authorities. The Eurosystem has been discussing 
this topic with major European banks and other 
stakeholders since April 2008, and has observed 
increasing support. Several market initiatives 
are under way to create such a European card 
scheme, which the Eurosystem considers to be 
a clear sign that the market recognises the need 
for a scheme of this nature.Preparations continued to be made for the launch of the SEPA direct debit scheme on 
1 November 2009, resulting in the adoption 
of two rulebooks on the core and business-
to-business services. However, uncertainties 
still surround the launch of the scheme, and 
these must be resolved urgently, in particular 
those related to the application of a multilateral 
interchange fee. To support the timely launch of 
the scheme, in September 2008 the ECB, in close 
consultation with the European Commission, 
suggested an interim arrangement whereby 
existing multilateral interchange fees would be 
applied to SEPA direct debits. During a transition 
period, which would only last a few years, banks 
would have to change their business models and 
inform their customers in an adequate manner. 
The Eurosystem continued its efforts to ensure 
the timely launch of these new payment services 
at the European level. In this context, the sixth 
progress report on SEPA suggests priorities and 
encourages further work on the project.160ECBAnnual Report
2008The market for short-term paper in Europe is of a largely domestic nature. The STEP 
initiative, pursued by market participants 
under the auspices of the European Banking 
Federation and ACI Œ The Financial Markets 
Association, and steered by the STEP Market 
Committee, has addressed this gap in Þ nancial integration through the development of a core 
set of commonly agreed market standards 
and practices, with which market participants 
comply on a voluntary basis. The Eurosystem has supported the STEP 
initiative since its inception in 2001 

by facilitating interaction among market participants, contributing to the development 
of the STEP Market Convention and raising 
public awareness regarding the initiative. 
Following the successful launch of the STEP 
market in June 2006, the Eurosystem has 
continued to contribute to the initiative in two 
ways. First, the ECB provides statistics on the 
STEP market. Second, the Eurosystem assists 
the STEP Secretariat in the labelling of STEP 
paper. This second measure is a temporary 
arrangement which will expire in June 2010.The STEP Market Committee has launched a review of the STEP Market Convention, 
with the aim of making its application 
easier for a larger number of markets from a 
technical point of view, while maintaining or 
even enhancing the standards of the Market 
Convention. The ECB welcomes such a 
review. First, as markets evolve, the Market 
Convention must be adjusted accordingly. 
Second, it is a good opportunity to take stock 
of the processes and procedures applied since 
the start of the STEP market in June 2006 and 
to make any necessary improvements to the 
Market Convention.The ECB produces daily statistics on yields on new issues of euro-denominated STEP 
securities, as well as monthly volumes of STEP 
debt securities. Despite the distressed market 
conditions, the total outstanding amount of 
STEP debt securities increased by 24% (year on 
year) in the fourth quarter of 2008. ADVICE ON THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY 

FRAMEWORK FOR THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND 

DIRECT RULE-MAKINGThe Eurosystem regularly contributes to the 

development of the EU legislative and regulatory 

framework by providing advice on the main 

policy initiatives under way. 
Activity with regard to Þ nancial supervision in 
the EU focused in 2008 on the follow-up of the review of the Lamfalussy framework, to which 
the Eurosystem contributed (see Section 2 
of this chapter). Furthermore, as part of its 
advisory role in accordance with Article 105(4) 
of the Treaty, the ECB regularly provides advice 
on the legislative proposals of the European 
Commission (see also Section 2). The ECB provided advisory input on issues related to the integration of securities 
settlement systems and of payment systems. 
In particular, the ECB was closely involved 
in the work relating to the ﬁCode of Conduct 
for Clearing and Settlementﬂ. The code aims 
to foster competition on the basis of price 
transparency, access and interoperability, and 
service unbundling and accounting separation. 
Given that the code is a self-regulatory tool, a 
strict monitoring mechanism has been set up to 
ensure that all the measures are implemented 
properly and on time. The mechanism relies 
on external auditors and an ad hoc Monitoring 
Group composed of the European Commission, 
CESR and the ECB. The Monitoring Group met 
four times in the course of 2008. The ECB and 
the European Central Securities Depositories 
Association conducted an analysis on price 
transparency and provided suggestions on how 
to improve price comparability.As the code of conduct ultimately aims to establish freedom of choice, it needs to be 
complemented by the full removal of the 
ﬁGiovannini barriersﬂ to efÞ cient clearing and 
settlement (named after the group that identiÞ ed them in 2001), which result from differences in 
technical standards and business practices, legal 
uncertainty, and differences in tax procedures. 
The ECB continued to participate in the Clearing 161ECBAnnual Report
2008and Settlement Advisory Monitoring Expert Group (CESAME) which addresses the removal 
of the Þ rst set of barriers. The ECB also continued 
to take part in the Legal Certainty Group, which 
in August 2008 presented 15 recommendations 
on the removal of legal barriers related to 
post-trading.Since harmonisation of the European legal framework forms the basis for SEPA, the 
Eurosystem has taken an active interest in 
Community legislation in this area. The 
Payment Services Directive 13 was formally adopted in November 2007. According to the 
European Commission, the Member States are 
well on track with their work on transposing the 
Directive into national law before the deadline 
of 1 November 2009. The ECB participates in 
the Commission™s transposition working group. 
The review of Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 
on cross-border payments in euro 14 also has major consequences for SEPA and especially for 
SEPA direct debits. It is widely recognised that 
this Regulation was the trigger for the banking 
industry™s decision to start developing SEPA 
in 2002. The Commission™s proposal 15 aims at adapting the Regulation to the current payments 
landscape, for example by extending it to direct 
debit transactions. This will mean that the prices 
for cross-border SEPA direct debit transactions 
cannot be higher than those for corresponding 
national direct debit transactions. The ECB has 
been involved in the Commission™s work on the 
draft regulation and has published an opinion in 
this context.16The ECB has also been involved in the 
Commission™s preparations for a review of the 
E-Money Directive, which establishes the legal 
framework for e-money institutions™ activities.17 The Commission states that the provision and 
use of e-money is not growing as expected and 
therefore suggests amending the Directive. 
From the ECB™s point of view, the review is 
welcome; however, some parts of the 
Commission™s proposal cause concern, 
particularly with regard to the prudential 
framework and institutional status of e-money 
institutions.18 PROVIDING CENTRAL BANKING SERVICES WHICH 

FOSTER FINANCIAL INTEGRATIONTARGET2, the second generation of the 
Eurosystem™s large-value payment system, 
successfully went live on 19 November 2007, 
and fully replaced the Þ rst-generation TARGET 
system on 19 May 2008. The new system is 
designed to give euro money and Þ nancial markets an effective and secure execution 
mechanism for the real-time settlement 
in central bank money of euro payments. 
TARGET2 represents a decisive contribution 
by the Eurosystem to European Þ nancial integration. It is the Þ rst market infrastructure to 
be completely integrated and harmonised at the 
European level, and has remedied the previous 
fragmentation in the management of central 
bank liquidity and the execution of large-value 
payments. The new system™s features have 
both enabled and driven organisational changes 
among credit institutions that operate in several 
European countries, by allowing these entities 
to rationalise their back ofÞ ce functions and to 
consolidate their management of euro liquidity 
(see Section 2.1 of Chapter 2).Furthermore, the Eurosystem and market participants have continued their work on 
the TARGET2-Securities (T2S) project. T2S 
will be a multi-currency platform used by 
European central securities depositories for the 
settlement of securities transactions in central 
bank money. The Governing Council decided 
on 17 July 2008 to build T2S and to assign its 
development and operation to the Deutsche 
Bundesbank, the Banco de España, the Banque Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the 13 Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC, 2005/60/EC 
and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC.

2008de France and the Banca d™Italia. By offering harmonised, borderless and neutral settlement 
services in euro and other currencies, T2S will 
be a major step forward in the delivery of an 
integrated securities market and an important 
contribution to Þ nancial integration in Europe 
(see Section 2.2 of Chapter 2). Finally, in the area of collateral management, the Governing Council decided in July 2008 to 
establish a single shareable platform (CCBM2) 
for euro area NCBs with a view to consolidating 
and increasing the efÞ ciency of the Eurosystem™s 
internal systems and enhancing counterparties™ 
liquidity and collateral management. The 
Governing Council assigned the Nationale Bank 
van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique and 
De Nederlandsche Bank to develop and operate 
the platform on behalf of the Eurosystem. 
It is being developed in close cooperation 
with market participants (see Section 2.3 of 
Chapter 2).163ECBAnnual Report
2008Payment and securities clearing and settlement systems are basic infrastructures which are 
necessary for the proper functioning of market 
economies. They are indispensable for the 
efÞ cient ß ow of payments for goods, services 
and Þ nancial assets, and their smooth functioning 
is crucial for the implementation of the central 
bank™s monetary policy and for maintaining the 
stability of and conÞ dence in the currency, the 
Þ nancial system and the economy in general. 
Through its oversight function, the Eurosystem 
aims to ensure the safety and efÞ ciency of 
payment and securities settlement systems and 
of central counterparties operating in euro, 
by applying, among other things, minimum 
standards and requirements. In particular, the 
oversight function aims to maintain systemic 
stability in the payment system by containing 
the exposure to systemic risk. In this context, 
overseers are generally concerned with both 
individual payment and securities settlement 
systems and Œ given the interdependencies 
between these systems Œ the market 
infrastructure as a whole. Payment instruments 
also fall within the scope of the Eurosystem™s 
oversight, which focuses in particular on their 
safety and efÞ ciency.The Treaty assigns oversight responsibilities to 
the Eurosystem. For the purpose of effective and 
efÞ cient oversight, the ECB and the NCBs of 
the Eurosystem carry out these responsibilities 
in a way that allows the Eurosystem to beneÞ t from its decentralised structure, while ensuring 
coordination of its oversight activities and equal 
application of its policies. The Eurosystem™s 
oversight policies and requirements reß ect internationally recognised standards, the details 
of which are adjusted to the speciÞ c conditions 
and needs of the Eurosystem.4.1 LARGE-VALUE PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE PROVIDERSThe Eurosystem oversees all large-value 
payment systems which settle euro transactions, 
including those managed by the Eurosystem itself. The Eurosystem applies the same 
oversight standards to both its own systems and 
those that are privately operated. These standards 
are the Core Principles for Systemically 
Important Payment Systems, deÞ ned by the 
G10 Committee on Payment and Settlement 
Systems (CPSS) and adopted by the Governing 
Council in 2001. They are complemented by the 
Eurosystem™s business continuity oversight 
expectations for systemically important payment 
systems which were adopted by the Governing 
Council in 2006 and are to be implemented by 
all systemically important payment systems in 
the euro area by June 2009.Key payment infrastructures settling euro-denominated transactions (TARGET2, EURO1 
and CLS), infrastructure service providers (such 
as SWIFT) and euro securities clearing and 
settlement infrastructures coped successfully 
with the challenges arising from the market 
turmoil that continued in 2008. From an 
oversight perspective, a number of lessons could 
be learned from these events, not least with 
regard to the importance of adequate capacity 
management by system operators and well-
established frameworks for crisis communication 
between overseers, other relevant authorities 
and market infrastructure providers.TARGET2 
The gradual transition from TARGET to 
TARGET2, which started in November 2007, 
was completed smoothly and on schedule 
when the third and last group of national 
banking communities successfully connected 
to TARGET2 on 19 May 2008. All TARGET2 
oversight activities are led and coordinated by 
the ECB, which acts in close cooperation with 
the participating NCBs. The latter conduct the 
oversight of the local features of TARGET2 and 
contribute to the oversight of the central features 
of TARGET2 on a voluntary basis. In early 2007, when TARGET2 was still under development, the TARGET2 overseers started 
to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the 
TARGET2 design against the Core Principles 
for Systemically Important Payment Systems 4 PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND MARKET 
INFRASTRUCTURE OVERSIGHT164ECBAnnual Report
2008and the Eurosystem™s business continuity oversight expectations for systemically 
important payment systems. The Þ rst results 
of the assessment were encouraging and, at 
the end of 2007, the TARGET2 overseers 
concluded that TARGET2 was likely to fully 
comply with all relevant Core Principles, 
provided that a number of oversight Þ ndings were addressed by the system operator in the 
course of 2008 on the basis of an agreed action 
plan. In November 2008 the system operator 
provided a report to the overseers, detailing 
how the points included in the action plan 
had been addressed. The TARGET2 overseers 
reviewed the report and the actions taken by the 
TARGET2 operator and provided a Þ nal report on the oversight assessment of the TARGET2 
design to the decision-making bodies of the 
ECB in March 2009. A public version of the 
assessment report will be made available. The TARGET2 overseers consider that the 
operation of the system has been in line with 
expectations. Only one major incident, which 
occurred on 30 June 2008, required special 
attention and action on the part of the TARGET2 
overseers. Some oversight recommendations 
related to this incident have been discussed with 
the system operator and mitigation measures 
have been implemented.EURO1 
EURO1 is a large-value payment system for 
cross-border and domestic transactions in 
euro between banks operating in the EU. It is 
operated by the clearing company of the Euro 
Banking Association, EBA CLEARING. 
EURO1 works on a multilateral net basis. The 
end-of-day positions of EURO1 participants 
are ultimately settled in central bank money via 
the TARGET2 system, with the ECB acting as 
settlement agent. Oversight activities in 2008 
focused on, among other things, the migration of 
the settlement of EURO1 end-of-day positions 
to TARGET2 in May 2008, when the previous 
TARGET system ceased to exist. The migration 
of settlement to TARGET2 was completed 
without any problems. On 7 July 2008 EBA CLEARING implemented 
two additional liquidity distribution windows 
in EURO1 under the Flexible Settlement 
Capability (also referred to as the liquidity 
bridge), one at 1 p.m. and the other at 3.30 p.m. 
The liquidity bridge arrangement facilitates the 
processing of payments that would otherwise 
be placed on hold as a result of banks having 
reached their debit or credit caps in EURO1. 
The two additional liquidity distribution 
windows aim to reduce the balance kept on the 
EURO1 pre-settlement account in TARGET2 
and to maximise the recycling of pre-funded 
liquidity. Their implementation received a 
positive assessment from the overseers from 
both a EURO1 and a TARGET2 perspective. CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEM 
The Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) 
system provides a multi-currency service for 
the simultaneous, i.e. payment-versus-payment 
(PvP), settlement with Þ nality of payment 
instructions relating to foreign exchange 
transactions. Through its PvP mechanism, CLS 
virtually eliminates foreign exchange settlement 
risk, i.e. the risk that one party to a foreign 
exchange transaction will pay the currency it has 
sold, but not receive the currency it has bought. CLS was launched in 2002 and initially settled foreign exchange transactions in seven major 
currencies, including the euro. Following the 
approval by CLS overseers of the Mexican peso 
and the Israeli shekel for settlement by CLS in 
2008, CLS now settles in 17 currencies. In 
addition, CLS settles single-currency payment 
transactions that are linked to a limited set of 
Þ nancial instruments, i.e. over-the-counter 
(OTC) transactions in credit derivatives and 
non-deliverable forward 19 transactions. CLS is managed by CLS Bank International 
(CLS Bank), New York. CLS Bank is owned 
by private sector banks and other Þ nancial DeÞ ned as ﬁnet cash settledﬂ forward foreign exchange transactions, 
19 whereby two parties agree to enter into two notional foreign 
exchange transactions and settle the difference between the two 

notional transactions in cash in an agreed currency. The currencies 

speciÞ ed in the two notional foreign exchange transactions are not 
physically exchanged by the parties to the non-deliverable forward.165ECBAnnual Report
2008institutions. The Federal Reserve System accepts primary oversight responsibility for 
CLS under a cooperative oversight arrangement 
involving the G10 central banks and the central 
banks of CLS-settled currencies. Within this 
cooperative oversight arrangement, the ECB 
(in close cooperation with the euro area NCBs) 
has primary oversight responsibility for the 
settlement of the euro by CLS. In terms of value, CLS is the largest payment 
system settling euro transactions outside the euro 

area. Accordingly, the safety and efÞ ciency of 
CLS and its compliance with the Eurosystem 

policy principles 20 is of primary importance to 
the Eurosystem. In December 2008 CLS settled 

an average of 473,000 foreign exchange 

transactions per day with an average daily 

settlement value equivalent to •3.3 trillion.21 This 
is a substantial increase in terms of volume 

compared with December 2007, when CLS 

settled an average daily volume of 381,436 

transactions with an average daily settlement 

value equivalent to •2.9 trillion. With a share of 

around 21% of all transactions settled in CLS, the 

euro has continued to be the second most 

important currency for settlement, after the US 

dollar (around 44%). In 2008 the average daily 

value of CLS transactions settled in euro was 

•560 billion. 
In 2008 the BIS published a report entitled ﬁProgress in reducing foreign exchange 
settlement riskﬂ.22 The report, which includes contributions from the Eurosystem, indicates 
that the comprehensive long-term strategy 
endorsed by the G10 central banks in 1996 
has signiÞ cantly reduced the systemic risk 
arising from the way in which foreign exchange 
transactions are settled. However, it also 
points out that more can and should be done 
by individual institutions, industry groups and 
central banks to tackle remaining exposure 
and to guard against the risk of reversing the 
progress that has already been made. SWIFT 
The ECB participates with the other G10 central 
banks in the cooperative oversight of SWIFT, with the Nationale Bank van België/Banque 
Nationale de Belgique being the overseer with 
primary responsibility. The G10 cooperative 
oversight of SWIFT concentrates on the 
objectives of security, operational reliability, 
business continuity and resilience of the SWIFT 
infrastructure. During 2008 the oversight 
group reviewed whether SWIFT was pursuing 
these objectives by ensuring the existence of 
governance arrangements, structures, processes, 
risk management procedures and controls that 
enable it to effectively manage the potential 
risks to the proper functioning of market 
infrastructures using SWIFT and to Þ nancial stability in general. In 2008 the SWIFT overseers paid particular attention to SWIFT™s project to move to a 
multi-zone messaging architecture. SWIFT™s 
processing will be divided into two zones, 
namely the transatlantic and the European 
zone, with the aim of increasing the processing 
capacity of its infrastructure, enhancing its 
resilience and meeting European data protection 
requirements. As part of the project, which 
will be implemented in two phases by 2010 
and 2013 respectively, a new global operating 
centre will be established in Europe to serve 
both the transatlantic and European zones. 
European-based customers of SWIFT will be 
automatically assigned to the European zone, 
with all their intra-European trafÞ c being 
processed and stored in Europe. The overseers 
are reviewing SWIFT™s processes for the design 
and roll-out of this architecture, while at the same 
time monitoring whether due attention is being 
paid to the continued resilience and availability 
of the SWIFT services which are crucial for 
maintaining global Þ nancial stability.
ﬁThe Eurosystem policy principles on the location and 20 operation of infrastructures settling euro-denominated payment transactionsﬂ, ECB, July 2007. 
The cash settlement of each foreign exchange trade consists of 21 two payment transactions, one in each currency involved. Thus, 
in December 2008 CLS settled 236,396 trades with an average 
daily value equivalent to around •1.65 trillion.

20084.2 RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND 
INSTRUMENTSThe Eurosystem™s oversight also covers retail payment systems and payment instruments. In 
2008 the ECB continued to monitor the smooth 
functioning of STEP2, which is a payment 
system for cross-border, and increasingly also 
for domestic, retail payments in euro, operated 
by EBA CLEARING. In 2008 a number of 
changes in the system had to be assessed against 
the applicable oversight standards. On 28 January 2008 EBA CLEARING launched 
a SEPA credit transfer service in STEP2 for the 

processing of credit transfers in compliance 

with the SEPA credit transfer scheme rulebook 

of the European Payments Council (EPC). 

In May 2008 an additional intraday cycle 

was introduced for the SEPA credit transfer 

service to cater for the demands arising from 

the migration of euro area countries™ domestic 

trafÞ c to this new service. A major change in 
the system occurred on 8 December 2008, 

when the settlement of the SEPA credit transfer 

service was moved to TARGET2. Prior to 

that date, the credit transfer service settled in 

EURO1, as the other STEP2 services continue 

to do. These changes did not alter the level 

of compliance of STEP2 with the applicable 

oversight standards. 
In January 2008 the Governing Council approved the oversight framework for card 
payment schemes operating in the euro area, 
taking into account the comments received 
in the public consultation held in 2007. In 
May 2008 the Eurosystem started its oversight 
assessment of card payment schemes operating 
in the euro area against the newly established 
oversight standards. The assessment includes 
26 schemes, four of which are international. 
International card schemes are being assessed 
by cooperative assessment groups consisting 
of a lead overseeing central bank and other 
volunteering central banks.23 The assessments of all individual national and international card 
schemes will be subject to peer reviews in order 
to ensure equal application of the oversight standards. It is envisaged that an overall 
assessment report describing the main results at 
the aggregate level will be published.In 2008 the Eurosystem started to develop oversight frameworks for the new SEPA 
payment instruments developed by the EPC, 
namely the credit transfer scheme that was 
put in place as from 28 January 2008 and the 
direct debit scheme planned for 2009. Once the 
oversight frameworks have been set out, it is 
envisaged that they will be published for public 
consultation.4.3 SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES CLEARING 
AND SETTLEMENTThe Eurosystem has a strong interest in the 
smooth functioning of securities clearing and 
settlement systems because failures in the 
clearing, settlement and custody of collateral 
could jeopardise the implementation of 
monetary policy, the smooth functioning of 
payment systems and the maintenance of 
Þ nancial stability.
In its capacity as a user of securities settlement 
systems (SSSs), the Eurosystem assesses the 
compliance of SSSs in the euro area, as well as 
links between those SSSs, against the 
Eurosystem user standards.24 SSSs and links are eligible for Eurosystem credit operations if they 
fulÞ l these user standards, which also provide 
the basis against which the Eurosystem assesses 
any new SSSs and links or signiÞ cant updates of 
those systems already eligible.In 2008 a new system (VP Lux) and one new relayed link were assessed and found to be 
compliant with the Eurosystem user standards. 
The Governing Council also assessed the 
Slovakian SSS in preparation for the entry of The ECB is the Eurosystem™s lead overseer for VISA, American 23 Express and Diners/Discover. It participates as an assessment group member in the cooperative oversight of MasterCard, while

2008Slovakia into the euro area on 1 January 2009. It found the SSS to be compliant with the user 
standards and thus eligible for use in Eurosystem 
monetary policy and intraday credit operations. 
In addition, the Eurosystem also undertook its 
Þ rst comprehensive assessment of all SSSs, 
links and relayed links already in use, the results 
of which are expected to become available in 
spring 2009. In 2008 the Eurosystem assessed a new holding arrangement for international debt securities 
in global registered form issued jointly by the 
two international central securities depositories 
(ICSDs), Euroclear Bank (Belgium) and 
Clearstream Banking Luxembourg. This new 
arrangement Œ to be introduced by mid-2010 Œ 
will replicate the main principles of the New 
Global Note arrangement introduced in 2006 
for international debt securities in global bearer 
form. In view of the decreasing issuance of 
international debt securities in individual note 
form, a revision of their holding structure was not 
justiÞ ed. It was therefore decided to withdraw 
these securities from the list of eligible assets 
for Eurosystem credit operations. A transitional 
period ending on 30 September 2010 has been 
deÞ ned, in which securities of this type issued 
before or on that date will continue to be eligible 
for use as collateral until their maturity.ESCB-CESR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SECURITIES 

CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT IN THE EUROPEAN 

UNIONIn 2001 the Governing Council approved a 
framework for cooperation between the ESCB 
and CESR on issues related to securities 
clearing and settlement systems. A joint 
working group was created in the same year to 
adapt the recommendations for SSSs drawn up 
by the CPSS and the International Organization 
of Securities Commissions (the CPSS-IOSCO 
recommendations) to the EU landscape, and 
from 2004 also the recommendations for central 
counterparties. The work was frozen in 2005 
owing to three open issues regarding the scope, 
content and legal basis of the ESCB-CESR 
recommendations. On 3 June 2008 the ECOFIN Council formally 
invited the ESCB and CESR to adapt and Þ nalise their draft ﬁStandards for securities clearing 
and settlement in the EUﬂ by autumn 2008, 
respecting a number of principles, namely 
that: i) the adopted text should take the form of 
non-binding recommendations addressed solely 

to public authorities and not to market participants, 

ii) its scope should include ICSDs and exclude 

custodian banks, and iii) on credit and liquidity 

risk controls, the benchmark accepted by the 

G10 Œ namely CPSS-IOSCO Recommendation 9 

for SSSs Œ should be adopted.In accordance with the ECOFIN Council™s request, the ESCB-CESR working group 
resumed its work and prepared a set of draft 
recommendations which were subject to a 
public consultation from 23 October 2008 
until 23 January 2009. During the consultation 
period, a public hearing for interested parties 
was held. The European Parliament, the European Commission, CEBS, market participants and 
associations were closely involved in this 
work at various stages. The Þ nal approval of 
the revised recommendations by CESR, the 
Governing Council and the non-euro area NCBs 
is expected to take place at the end of the Þ rst quarter of 2009. In parallel, CEBS is carrying 
out an analysis to identify areas where further 
measures may be needed to bridge the gap 
between the ESCB-CESR recommendations 
and the banking regulation applicable to banks 
which have internalised clearing and settlement 
activities.The recommendations, once Þ nalised, will be used 
by central bank overseers and securities regulators 
with a view to safeguarding both the soundness 

and efÞ ciency of securities clearing and settlement 
in the EU as well as ensuring a level playing-Þ eld 
for the various infrastructures. The ESCB-CESR 

recommendations complement the work of other 

EU fora and are regarded as one of the pillars of 

the EU policy on the post-trading sector, together 

with TARGET2-Securities, the Code of Conduct 
168ECBAnnual Report
2008for Clearing and Settlement, and the dismantling 
of the Giovannini barriers.REDUCING COUNTERPARTY RISK IN CREDIT 

DEFAULT SWAPSAccording to BIS Þ gures, the outstanding 
notional amount of credit default swaps stood 
at USD 57 trillion in June 2008, accounting for 
around 8% of all OTC derivatives. The need 
for a more resilient operational framework 
to support the orderly processing of OTC 
derivatives trades, which had been identiÞ ed in the CPSS™s March 2007 report entitled 
ﬁNew developments in clearing and settlement 
arrangements for OTC derivativesﬂ, became 
more urgent as a result of the Þ nancial market 
turmoil in 2008. The ECB hosted a meeting on 
3 November 2008 with European stakeholders 
concerning the establishment of central 
counterparties (CCPs) for credit default swaps. 
Participants included the potential providers 
of such CCPs, dealers, users and regulators. 
The meeting complemented initiatives by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the 
European Commission in this Þ eld. The ECB 
also participated in a working group set up by 
the European Commission addressing both 
short-term and long-term supervisory, regulatory 
and competition issues in the derivatives market 
with the aim of promoting Þ nancial stability. 
Stakeholders have underlined the merits of 
having multiple solutions, and at least one 
European solution. On 18 December 2008 the 
Governing Council recalled the importance 
of strengthening the infrastructure for OTC 
derivatives, and the need for at least one 
European CCP for credit derivatives. Given its 
potentially systemic importance, this European 
CCP should be located within the euro area.The Eurosystem shares the views of the Financial Stability Forum and the European Commission 
on the importance of reducing counterparty 
risk and of enhancing transparency in OTC 
derivatives markets, in particular in areas of 
systemic importance (e.g. credit derivatives). 
The introduction of CCPs for OTC derivatives 
is considered an appropriate solution because 
CCPs, by virtue of concentrating outstanding positions in one place, i) reduce the counterparty 
risk to which market participants are exposed 
and render risk management more efÞ cient, ii) increase market integrity, transparency and 
the availability of information, iii) standardise 
the criteria for evaluating exposure, and 
iv) free up collateral. The Eurosystem announced 
its intention to cooperate with other authorities 
to facilitate effective collective action by the 
private sector in this regard. In December 2008 
the ECOFIN Council invited the ESCB and 
CESR to adapt their draft recommendations 
on CCPs to explicitly address the risk of 
OTC derivatives.4.4 OTHER ACTIVITIES
In order to inform public authorities, market 
infrastructure providers and their participants, as 
well as the general public‡ about developments 
related to its oversight framework, and about its 
oversight activities related to speciÞ c payment 
systems, the ECB published its ﬁPayment 
systems and market infrastructure oversight 
report 2007ﬂ on 11 July 2008. This report was 
the Þ rst publication dedicated to the ECB™s 
oversight activities. The scope of the report will 
be widened, with subsequent issues taking the 
form of a Eurosystem oversight report.Given that payment and securities infrastructures are crucial for the proper functioning of market 
economies, it is important that these 
infrastructures, including their participants and 
third-party service providers, implement 
effective and efÞ cient risk management and 
business continuity procedures and are compliant 
with the relevant national and international 
standards. In view of the many interdependencies 
between the various market infrastructures and 
the need to ensure a high level of information 
exchange and mutual understanding, the ECB 
and the EU NCBs have agreed to promote 
information-sharing on international and 
national standards relevant to operational 
resilience, and in particular those relevant to 
business continuity. In February 2008 the ECB 
established on its website a dedicated webpage 169ECBAnnual Report
2008on market infrastructure business continuity.25 The webpage provides interested parties with information on the latest business continuity 
standards applicable to infrastructures operating 
in Europe, a glossary of terms related to business 
continuity and up-to-date information on the 
latest European developments in this Þ eld. The 
webpage also provides links to central banks 
and other regulators that have issued relevant 
standards and market practices applicable in 
their countries (including non-European 
countries such as the United States, Hong Kong 
and Japan). To ensure the consistent use of terms in all of the ESCB™s publications that relate to payments, 
clearing and settlement, on 30 September 2008 
the ECB published for public consultation 
a glossary of terms relating to the technical 
aspects of payment, clearing and settlement 
systems in the EU. The terms included in the 
glossary have been deÞ ned in a user-friendly 
and non-legalistic style in order to promote their 
acceptance. The Þ nal version of the glossary 
will be published on the ECB™s website. Finally, the ECB publishes statistical data on payments and securities trading, clearing 
and settlement on an annual basis. Data are 
broken down by country and, as of 2007, are 
made available solely in electronic form via 
the Statistical Data Warehouse on the ECB™s 
website. The data for 2007 were published on 
26 November 2008. The webpage can be found under 25 http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/pol/bc/html/index.en.html Willem F. Duisenberg at his farewell event on 22 October 2003 handing over the bell used at the Governing Council meetings to Jean-Claude TrichetCHAPTER 5EUROPEAN AND 
INTERNATIONAL 
RELATIONS 
172ECBAnnual Report
2008In 2008 the ECB continued to have regular contacts with European institutions and fora, 
particularly with the European Parliament 
(see Chapter 6), the ECOFIN Council, the 
Eurogroup and the European Commission. The 
President of the ECB participated in meetings 
of the ECOFIN Council when matters relating 
to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB were 
discussed, as well as in the meetings of the 
Eurogroup. The President of the Eurogroup and 
the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary 
Affairs attended meetings of the Governing 
Council when they deemed it appropriate.1.1 POLICY ISSUES
THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACTIn 2008 the initially favourable macroeconomic environment supported the improvement of 
budget balances in most countries and hence 
the abrogation of excessive deÞ cit procedures 
for Þ ve out of the six Member States with an 
excessive deÞ cit at the end of 2007. In June 
2008 the ECOFIN Council brought to an end 
the excessive deÞ cit procedures for the Czech 
Republic, Italy, Portugal and Slovakia, and 
took the same step for Poland in July 2008. For 
Slovakia, this removed a major obstacle to its 
adoption of the euro in 2009. The revision of 
the Greek deÞ cit for 2007 from 2.8% to 3.5% of 
GDP did not lead to procedural steps under the 
excessive deÞ cit procedure.
However, the deterioration of the macroeconomic 
environment in the course of the year and the 
impact of the Þ nancial crisis on tax revenues 
put pressure on public Þ nances and led to the 
re-emergence of high deÞ cits, especially in 
countries which were vulnerable owing to 
insufÞ cient consolidation in good times. In 
July 2008 the ECOFIN Council launched an 
excessive deÞ cit procedure against the United 
Kingdom, recommending under Article 104(7) 
of the Treaty that the United Kingdom should 
bring the deÞ cit below 3% of GDP by the 
Þ nancial year 2009/10. Hungary remained 
subject to an ongoing excessive deÞ cit procedure 
during 2008, with a deadline to correct the deÞ cit by 2009 at the latest. In addition, in 
May 2008 the Commission issued ﬁeconomic 
and budgetary policy adviceﬂ to France, 
inviting the country to carry out the necessary 
consolidation of public Þ nances and to pursue 
structural reforms. Reß ecting on the need for a 
binding medium-term Þ scal framework and the 
risk of the deÞ cit exceeding 3% of GDP, the 
Commission also gave advice to Romania in 
June 2008.In May the Eurogroup endorsed the policy framework set by the Stability and Growth Pact. 
Ministers noted that in several countries more 
ambitious policies would be needed to comply 
with the provisions of the preventive arm of the 
Pact and achieve the budgetary objectives of the 
2007 Berlin agreement, namely that Member 
States would achieve their medium-term 
objectives in 2008 or 2009 and that all of them 
should aim for 2010 at the latest.As the Þ nancial turbulence increased over 
the year, leading to diminishing conÞ dence in the Þ nancial sector, the ECOFIN Council 
called in October for Þ scal prudence to support 
conÞ dence. Ministers reiterated that the Pact 
remained the adequate framework and should be fully applied. In particular, automatic stabilisers 
should help to cushion the expected slowdown. 
With regard to the long-term sustainability of 
public Þ nances, the Council discussed proposals 
on how to include the ageing-induced Þ scal burden in the deÞ nition of the medium-term 
objectives.THE LISBON STRATEGY 
The Lisbon strategy Œ the EU™s wide-
ranging programme of economic, social and 
environmental reform Œ entered a new three-
year policy cycle in 2008, the second cycle since 
the review of the strategy in 2005.In spring 2008 the European Council conÞ rmed the Integrated Guidelines adopted for the 2005-08 cycle and stressed that the focus 
during the present cycle should be on the 
implementation of agreed objectives. It 
also complemented these guidelines with 1 EUROPEAN ISSUES
173ECBAnnual Report
2008country-speciÞ c recommendations for each 
Member State and a horizontal guideline addressed to the euro area countries. The 
European Commission was invited to continue 
working with Member States on a clear and 
transparent methodology for the monitoring 
and evaluation of Lisbon reforms. Furthermore, 
to ensure continued commitment to structural 
reforms, the European Council invited the 
Commission, the EU Council and the national 
Lisbon coordinators to start reß ecting on the 
future of the Lisbon strategy after 2010.In the autumn of 2008 Member States submitted their national reform programmes. These 
programmes set out the progress Member States 
have made so far in implementing their structural 
reform strategies. These strategies aim to ensure 
the sustainability and quality of public Þ nances, improve the regulatory environment of 
businesses, increase investment in research and 
development as well as innovation, and 
introduce measures to boost labour participation 
and enhance labour market ß exibility. At the 
end of 2008 the European Commission published 
its Þ rst assessment of the implementation of the 2008-10 Community Lisbon Programme, which 
was adopted at the end of 2007 and complements 
the national reform programmes by detailing 
actions to be taken at the EU level. The 
Commission also suggested additional measures 
to reinforce the Lisbon strategy as part of the 
European Economic Recovery Plan.1 The ECB has repeatedly stressed the importance 
of implementing structural reforms aimed 
at enhancing growth and employment. Euro 
area countries in particular should implement 
comprehensive reform measures to foster the 
smooth functioning of EMU.FINANCIAL MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND 

FINANCIAL INTEGRATION 
The policies pursued by the EU during 2008 in 
the Þ nancial market area were to a large extent 
driven by the Þ nancial crisis. In the second 
half of 2007 the EU Council had adopted three 
roadmaps in response to the Þ nancial market 
turbulence which emerged in August of that year. These three roadmaps speciÞ ed the 
measures to be taken regarding i) the response 
to the Þ nancial turbulence, ii) the strengthening 
of EU arrangements for Þ nancial stability and 
iii) the review of the Lamfalussy process on 
Þ nancial regulation and supervision.
In the course of 2008 substantial progress was 
made on all three roadmaps. Regarding the 
response to the Þ nancial turbulence, the European 
Commission in July published its suggestions 
concerning the conditions for the authorisation, 
operation and supervision of credit rating 
agencies. In October it presented a proposal 
for an amendment of the Capital Requirements 
Directive (for more details, see Section 2 of 
Chapter 4). To strengthen the EU arrangements 
for Þ nancial stability, the supervisory authorities, 
central banks and Þ nance ministries of the EU 
adopted a Memorandum of Understanding on 
cooperation on cross-border Þ nancial stability, 
which entered into force in June. Substantial 
progress was also made on the review of the 
Lamfalussy process, leading to the agreement 
that the mandates of national supervisors should 
include an EU dimension by mid-2009 and that 
ﬁcolleges of supervisorsﬂ should be established 
for the largest cross-border Þ nancial groups. 
When the Þ nancial crisis intensi
Þ ed in autumn 
2008, EU institutions and Member States 
stepped up their coordination of measures to 
address the renewed challenges. On 12 October 
the euro area Heads of State or Government 
adopted a concerted action plan. On 15 October 
the European Council endorsed the principles 
agreed by the euro area countries and called 
on EU countries to adopt national measures in 
conformity with the action plan. The President 
of the ECB participated in both meetings.The main objectives of the concerted action plan were to ensure appropriate liquidity conditions These measures include: i) speeding up the implementation of 1 measures to enhance the business environment, ii) improving the functioning of labour markets, iii) reducing skills shortages 
and iv) bringing forward public infrastructure investments. The 
European Economic Recovery Plan also stresses the importance 
of improving international market access and intensifying 
international regulatory cooperation.174ECBAnnual Report
2008for Þ nancial institutions, to facilitate the funding 
of banks, to provide Þ nancial institutions 
with additional capital resources, to allow for the efÞ cient recapitalisation of distressed 
banks and to ensure sufÞ cient ß exibility in the 
implementation of accounting rules. In addition, 
a Þ nancial crisis cell was established to facilitate 
rapid and effective action in a crisis situation. 
This cell brings together representatives of the 
country holding the EU presidency, the President 
of the European Commission, the President of 
the ECB (in conjunction with other EU central 
banks), the President of the Eurogroup and the 
governments of the Member States.OTHER EU POLICIES 
The ECB monitored developments in the Þ eld of EU climate change and energy policies, in 
view of their potential impact on macroeconomic 
developments, price stability and Þ scal positions. 
As regards energy policies, improving the 
functioning of the EU™s internal market for 
energy can be expected to have a positive impact 
on energy price developments and to enhance the predictability of energy supply. In both 
policy Þ elds, the focus during 2008 was on 
turning the EU™s ambitious commitments into 
legislation.2 The ECB also monitored developments in the Common Agricultural 
Policy (CAP), in particular as regards their 
impact on food prices. In response to the surge 
in food prices, the EU Council agreed on several 
measures to improve food supply, such as the 
sale of public stocks, the suspension of the 
obligation for farmers to leave some of their 
arable land uncultivated, an increase in milk 
quotas and the suspension of import duties for 
cereals. Following the launch of the ﬁCAP 
Health Checkﬂ by the Commission, the EU 
Council reached an agreement in November 
2008 to modernise and streamline the CAP and 
to remove remaining restrictions on farmers in 
response to the growing demand for food.According to the climate and energy legislative package, the 2 EU should, by 2020, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared with 1990 and increase the use of renewable energy 
sources to 20% of overall EU energy consumption. Moreover, it 
should increase energy efÞ ciency by 20%.

TEN YEARS OF EMU 
2008 marked the tenth anniversary of the ECB and of the Eurosystem and the ESCB. This anniversary provided an opportunity to review the Þ rst decade of EMU and to draw lessons from 
the experience gained during this period.In May 2008 the ECB published a special edition of the Monthly Bulletin, which gave an account of the Eurosystem™s work and achievements and looked at the challenges that the 
Eurosystem and the euro area face as they enter their second decade. The Þ rst ten years of EMU 
have demonstrated the ECB™s ability to fully live up to its Treaty mandate. In spite of a difÞ cult external environment, characterised by a signiÞ cant increase in commodity prices, price stability 
has been broadly achieved. In the euro area, consumer prices rose, on average, at an annual rate of 
2.1% between 1999 and 2007, well below average annual consumer price inß ation in the period 
from 1990 to 1998, which amounted to 3%. Moreover, the ECB has succeeded in anchoring 
longer-term inß ation expectations at levels consistent with price stability. EMU has also fostered 
employment creation. Employment in the euro area rose by around 16 million persons between 
1999 and 2007, as compared with around 6 million persons in the period 1990-98. The European Commission published a communication in May, together with a report entitled ﬁEMU@10: successes and challenges after 10 years of Economic and Monetary Unionﬂ, in 175ECBAnnual Report
20081.2 INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
THE TREATY OF LISBONFollowing the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon by the Heads of State or Government on 
13 December 2007, Member States started the 
ratiÞ cation procedure in accordance with their 
respective constitutional requirements. So far, 
23 Member States have ratiÞ ed the Lisbon 
Treaty. Germany and Poland are very close to 
formal completion of the ratiÞ cation procedure. 
In the Czech Republic, parliamentary ratiÞ cation is still pending.In Ireland, the Lisbon Treaty was submitted to a binding referendum and failed to achieve 
majority support. Against this background, the 
European Council at its meeting on 19-20 June 
2008 reiterated that the Lisbon Treaty, with 
its aim ﬁto help an enlarged Union act more 
effectively and more democraticallyﬂ, should 
still be pursued. At the European Council 
meeting on 11-12 December 2008, the Heads 
of State or Government agreed to give ﬁlegal guaranteesﬂ to Ireland following the rejection of 
the Lisbon Treaty. The Irish government made 
a commitment to seek ratiÞ cation of the Lisbon 
Treaty by the end of the term of the current 
European Commission.CONVERGENCE REPORTS 
In line with Article 122 of the Treaty, the 

ECB and the European Commission prepared 

convergence reports on the progress made 

by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, 

Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, 

Slovakia and Sweden in meeting the conditions 

to join the euro area. In these reports, which 

were published on 7 May 2008, Slovakia was 

assessed in somewhat more depth than the 

other countries because the Slovak authorities 

had submitted a request for an examination 

in view of Slovakia™s intention to adopt the 

euro as of 1 January 2009. On the basis of a 

proposal from the Commission, the ECOFIN 

Council decided on 8 July 2008 that Slovakia 

fulÞ lled the conditions to join the euro area on 
1 January 2009 (see Chapter 3). 
which it emphasised that ten years after the introduction of the euro, the currency is a success. 
The Commission also put forward several proposals to improve coordination and surveillance 
within EMU, to enhance the euro area™s international role and to promote effective governance 
of EMU.The ECOFIN Council discussed the Þ rst ten years of EMU at its meeting of 7 October 2008. 
Ministers concluded that EMU had contributed to macroeconomic stability over the past ten years and that, following the reform processes within EMU, the EU was now better equipped to cope 
with economic shocks. In order to reap further beneÞ ts from EMU and to improve the economic 
performance of Member States, the ECOFIN Council agreed on several proposals, including 
i) better monitoring of competitiveness developments (particularly in countries participating in 
the euro area and ERM II), ii) a prioritisation of structural reform recommendations in order 
to take account of the economic situation and iii) measures to better account for the effects of 
economic cycles, and related cycles in asset prices, on tax revenues.The European Parliament also adopted a resolution on the Þ rst ten years of EMU 
(see Chapter 6).
The general conclusion emerging from the reß ections on the 
Þ rst ten years of EMU was that 
EMU™s institutional set-up works well. However, to make EMU a continued success, policy-makers need to be Þ rmly committed to the objectives agreed at the European level and vigorously 
implement the necessary policies.176ECBAnnual Report
20081.3 DEVELOPMENTS IN AND RELATIONS WITH EU 
CANDIDATE COUNTRIES 
The ECB continued its policy dialogue with the central banks of the EU candidate countries 
through bilateral meetings and within the overall 
institutional framework for the enlargement 
process set up by the EU. Accession negotiations with Croatia began in October 2005. Negotiations on the individual 
chapters of the acquis communautaire were opened in June 2006 and advanced signiÞ cantly in the course of 2008. By the end of the year, 
negotiations had been opened on 21 chapters and 
provisionally closed on 4. The ECB continued 
its fruitful bilateral relations with the Croatian 
National Bank, for example in the context of  

the high-level policy dialogue. After opening accession negotiations with Turkey in October 2005, the European 
Commission started negotiations on the 
individual chapters of the acquis communautaire in June 2006. In December 2006 the European 
Council decided to suspend talks for 8 out of 
the 35 chapters in the EU accession process, 
owing to the lack of progress in the extension 
of the customs union to the EU Member States. 
The EU institutions are continuing to evaluate 
the compatibility of Turkish legislation with the 
acquis communautaire and are making progress with the opening of the other chapters. The ECB 
continued its long-standing high-level policy 
dialogue with the Central Bank of the Republic 
of Turkey. Although the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted candidate status in 2005, 
it still needs to fulÞ l a number of institutional 
criteria before EU membership negotiations can 
start, including some related to crucial areas of 
political reform. Staff level contacts between 
the ECB and the National Bank of the Republic 
of Macedonia remained strong. 177ECBAnnual Report
20082 INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
2.1 KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMSURVEILLANCE OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES IN 
THE GLOBAL ECONOMYGiven the high level of economic and Þ nancial integration, the global economic environment 
is extremely relevant for the conduct of 
economic policy in the euro area. As a result, 
the Eurosystem closely monitors and analyses 
macroeconomic policies and underlying 
developments in countries outside the euro area. 
The ECB also plays an important role in the 
process of international multilateral surveillance 
of macroeconomic policies, which takes 
place mainly at the meetings of international 
organisations such as the BIS, the IMF and the 
OECD, as well as in fora such as the G7 and 
G20 groups of Þ nance ministers and central 
bank governors. The assessment of international 
developments with a view to contributing to a 
stable macroeconomic environment and sound 
macroeconomic and Þ nancial policies was 
especially important in 2008.The international economic environment in 2008 was largely dominated by the global Þ nancial turmoil, reß ecting the disorderly unwinding of 
domestic and external imbalances that had built 
up in preceding years and the materialisation of 
surrounding risks.The problems resulting from the realisation of these risks were rapidly transmitted around the 
world, given the global nature of regulatory, 
accounting and business models which 
contributed to practices that subsequently 
proved to be opaque and unsustainable, as well 
as the strength of cross-border Þ nancial and 
trade linkages. The original shock, which had 
started in the US sub-prime housing market, was 
considerably ampliÞ ed by, among other things, 
Þ nancial institutions™ high debt leverage and the 
underpricing of risks at the global level. While 
episodes of market turbulence between August 
2007 and September 2008 were comparatively 
short-lived and limited to a relatively small 
number of Þ nancial institutions, the occurrence 
of difÞ culties in a number of very large and 
globally active institutions caused major 
shockwaves from September 2008 onwards. 
These triggered high tensions in the interbank 
markets and in other key Þ nancing markets, 
severe episodes of stress in the banking sectors 
of several countries, signiÞ cant changes in global 
exchange rates and oil prices, a pronounced 
fall in asset prices worldwide, and a marked 
slowdown in real activity (see also Chapter 1). 
Although this Þ nancial crisis originated in the 
United States, an increasing number of countries 
have been affected, including both advanced 
and, more recently, emerging market economies. 
Several countries requested assistance from the 
IMF (see the section below on the international 
Þ nancial architecture). Liquidity assistance 
to central banks of other countries was also 
provided by the major central banks, including 
the ECB and the Federal Reserve System. For 
example, the latter set up liquidity swap facilities 
with the central banks of four large systemically 
important economies (Brazil, Mexico, 
South Korea and Singapore) at the end of
October 2008, in an effort to unfreeze money 
markets among emerging nations. 3Largely as a result of these developments, 
current account balances changed markedly in 
2008. First, the US current account deÞ cit fell 
by 0.7 percentage point, to 4.6% of GDP, mostly 
as a result of lower domestic demand. 4 Second, some countries registering current account 
surpluses saw these surpluses decline 
signiÞ cantly: China recorded a decline of 
1.9 percentage points of GDP and Japan a fall of 
0.8 percentage point. Meanwhile, oil-exporting 
countries as a whole recorded a rise in their 
current account surpluses in 2008; although oil 
prices declined strongly towards the end of the 
year, they remained above their 2007 level for 
most of the year. The euro area™s current account 
position moved from a surplus in 2007 to a 
deÞ cit of 0.5% of GDP in 2008.
For information on swap lines provided by the ECB, see Section 3 1 of Chapter 2.The Þ gures in this paragraph are taken from the IMF™s ﬁWorld 
4 Economic Outlookﬂ, October 2008. 178ECBAnnual Report
2008On a number of occasions in 2008, the Eurosystem stressed the risks and distortions 
related to the persistence of global imbalances. It 
also conÞ rmed its full support for a cooperative 
approach to ensure an orderly adjustment of 
global imbalances. In particular, the Eurosystem 
repeatedly called for policies aimed at increasing 
private and public savings in countries with 
current account deÞ cits, the implementation of 
further structural reforms in mature economies 
with relatively low potential growth, measures 
to increase domestic demand in emerging 
market economies with large current account 
surpluses, improved capital allocation in these 
countries, and a better appreciation of risks 
more generally. In the context of the ongoing 
reß ections on how to improve the international 
Þ nancial architecture (see below), in which the 
ECB and other Eurosystem central banks are 
participating, the Eurosystem has underscored 
the importance of ensuring that such an 
improvement also enhances macroeconomic 
policy discipline, in addition to fostering 
Þ nancial market discipline. A strengthened 
multilateral economic surveillance framework 
should help to ensure that economic policies, 
especially in systemically important countries, 
are stability-oriented and sustainable.Finally, the euro area itself is subject to international policy surveillance exercises. In 
2008 both the IMF and the OECD conducted 
regular reviews of the monetary, Þ nancial and 
economic policies of the euro area, as a 
complement to their reviews of the individual 
euro area countries. The Article IV consultations 
of the IMF and the review by the OECD™s 
Economic and Development Review Committee 
provided an opportunity for useful discussions 
between these international organisations and 
the ECB, the Eurogroup presidency and the 
European Commission. Following these 
discussions, both the IMF and the OECD 
produced individual reports assessing the euro 
area policies. 5 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE 
The Þ nancial turmoil led to a wide-ranging 
debate on the set-up and functioning of the international monetary and Þ nancial system. 
The EU Heads of State or Government agreed 
at their informal meeting in Brussels on 
7 November 2008 to coordinate their responses 
to the Þ nancial crisis and to implement common 
principles upon which to build a new international 
Þ nancial system. On 15 November the leaders 
of the G20 countries convened in Washington, 
D.C. for their Þ rst ever summit on 
Þ nancial markets and the world economy. They called 
for action in the areas of Þ nancial regulation and 
macroeconomic policies and underlined their 
commitment to free trade. The follow-up work 
to this summit has been organised through four 
working groups reporting to the G20 Þ nance and 
central bank deputies, who prepared the meeting 
of the G20 Þ nance ministers and central bank 
governors in spring 2009.In response to calls from the IMF™s members, concrete changes were made to the Fund™s 
facilities for Þ nancial support. In October a 
new Þ nancing instrument was created, the 
short-term liquidity facility. The purpose of 
this instrument is to provide quick-disbursing 
Þ nancing for countries with strong policies and 
a good track record that are facing temporary 
liquidity problems arising from developments in 
external capital markets. As well as establishing 
this new instrument, the Fund embarked on a 
review of the various aspects of its lending role. 
Furthermore, it provided Þ nancing to some of its 
member countries, including Belarus, Hungary, 
Iceland, Latvia, Pakistan and Ukraine, through 
its regular standby arrangements. Various efforts to reform the IMF continued in 2008. Key areas for reform which were 
discussed included IMF surveillance, the 
Fund™s lending role, the governance of the Fund 
(including quotas and voice), and its income and 
expenditure framework. Agreement on these 
issues has been pursued through discussions 
both inside the IMF and in other fora, such 
as the G7 and G20, with the ESCB and the 
Eurosystem playing their part by monitoring and ﬁEuro area policies: 2008 Article IV consultation Œ staff reportﬂ, 5 IMF, August 2008 and ﬁEconomic survey of the euro areaﬂ, OECD, January 2009.179ECBAnnual Report
2008contributing to the discussions on these issues as appropriate. Following the introduction of a new decision on bilateral surveillance over members™ 
policies in mid-2007, the Fund focused on 
its implementation in the regular Article IV 
consultations with its member countries. This 
new decision aims to ensure that greater attention 
is paid to cross-country spillovers by employing 
the concept of external stability as the organising 
principle for surveillance. External stability 
is deÞ ned with reference to the exchange rate, 
the analysis of which consequently becomes a 
key component of the surveillance process. In 
October the Fund adopted its Þ rst ﬁStatement of 
surveillance prioritiesﬂ, which is to guide IMF 
surveillance until 2011. This statement identiÞ es four key priorities for Fund surveillance: to 
resolve Þ nancial market stress, to strengthen 
the global Þ nancial system, to adjust to sharp 
changes in commodity prices and to promote 
the orderly reduction of global imbalances. In 
support of these priorities, the Fund intends 
to improve its early warnings of risks and 
vulnerabilities, among other things through the 
analysis of macro-Þ nancial linkages, and to 
extend its vulnerability exercise to advanced 
economies. The Fund also continued to focus 
on Þ nancial sector issues and related policy 
lessons and to improve its collaboration with the 
Financial Stability Forum.In addition, the Board of Governors of the IMF agreed on a comprehensive quota and voice 
reform package, which mainly provides for a 
new quota formula; a second round of ad hoc 
quota increases based on the new formula; a 
tripling of basic votes to increase the voice 
of low-income countries; and an additional 
Alternate Executive Director for the two African 
chairs on the Executive Board. The two key 
objectives of the reform were to realign quota 
shares with members™ relative weight and role 
in the global economy and to enhance the voice 
and participation of low-income countries in 
the IMF. Work on the Fund™s governance will 
continue on the basis of, among other things, the 
2008 report of the IMF™s Independent Evaluation OfÞ ce and the report of the committee of 
eminent persons on IMF governance reform, to 
be released by spring 2009. The Board of Governors of the IMF also agreed on measures to put the institution on a sounder 
Þ nancial footing. On the income side, the Fund 
will rely in the future on broader and more 
sustainable income sources. This includes a 
broadening of the Fund™s investment authority 
and the establishment of an endowment 
funded by the proÞ ts from a strictly limited 
sale of gold consistent with the Central Bank 
Gold Agreement. On the expenditure side, 
consideration of the Fund™s core mandate and 
careful priority-setting guide a new expenditure 
framework, entailing substantial budget 
reductions. Moreover, in the context of the 
Þ nancial turmoil, discussions are ongoing with 
regard to the adequacy of IMF resources. An important contribution to strengthening the resilience of the global Þ nancial system 
was made by the Financial Stability Forum, 
which facilitated the coordination of various 
national and international initiatives and 
oversaw their timely implementation. It also 
issued, and reviewed the implementation of, 
recommendations in Þ ve key areas, namely 
prudential oversight, transparency and valuation, 
credit ratings, the authorities™ responsiveness to 
risks and arrangements for dealing with stress in 
the Þ nancial system.
The agenda of the international Þ nancial community also continued to feature the 
promotion of mechanisms for crisis prevention 
and orderly crisis resolution. In this context, 
further progress was made in the implementation 
of the principles for stable capital ß ows and 
fair debt restructuring in emerging markets, 
which were endorsed by G20 Þ nance ministers 
and central bank governors in 2004. The aim 
of these principles, which are market-based 
and voluntary, is to provide guidelines for 
the behaviour of sovereign issuers and their 
private creditors regarding information-sharing, 
dialogue and close cooperation. An increasing 
number of Þ nancial institutions and issuing 
180ECBAnnual Report
2008countries have voiced support for the principles and expressed particular interest in advancing 
their implementation. At its last meeting in 
Washington, D.C. in October 2008, the Group 
of Trustees, a body comprising senior leaders 
in global Þ nance established to guide the 
implementation of the principles, reviewed the 
progress being made within the framework of 
the international Þ nancial architecture and gave 
guidance for future work. Another Þ nancial market initiative taken in 2008 
was the development of the Santiago Principles 
by the International Working Group of Sovereign 

Wealth Funds. Jointly agreed by sovereign 

wealth funds from advanced, emerging and 

developing economies, the principles represent 

a collaborative effort to set out a comprehensive 

framework to improve the understanding of the 

operations of sovereign wealth funds. The aim of 

these principles, which are voluntary in nature, 

is to enhance the stabilising role played by 

sovereign wealth funds in Þ nancial markets and 
to help to maintain the free ß ow of cross-border 
investment. The OECD is providing guidance on 

the policies of recipient countries with regard to 

investments by sovereign wealth funds.2.2 COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES OUTSIDE 
THE EU 
The Eurosystem continued to foster its 

international activities with the central banking 

community outside the EU through the 

organisation of seminars and workshops. In 

addition, the technical assistance provided by 

the Eurosystem remained an important tool for 

strengthening the administrative capacity of 

central banks, especially in the EU™s neighbouring 

regions, and enhancing compliance with 

European and international standards. The ECB 

also actively participated alongside the European 

Commission in the EU™s macroeconomic 

dialogue with China, India and Russia.The ECB continued to deepen its relations with 
countries in the western Balkans. On 

1 September 2008 the ECB and 17 EU NCBs 6 began a nine-month programme of technical 

assistance with the National Bank of Serbia. The 

programme, funded by the European Agency for 

Reconstruction, will provide the National Bank of 

Serbia with a needs analysis report on progress to 

be made in selected central banking areas in 

preparation for EU accession. The areas to be 

covered are the supervision of banks; the 

harmonisation of legislation in line with the acquis 
communautaire under the competence of the 

National Bank of Serbia; the liberalisation of 

capital movements; the conduct of monetary 

policy and the foreign exchange rate regime; 

monetary, Þ nancial and balance of payments 
statistics; and Þ nancial services consumer 
protection.Technical cooperation with the Bank of Russia 
intensiÞ ed with the start on 1 April 2008 of 
a new central bank cooperation programme, 

funded by the European Commission. This 

programme involves the ECB in partnership 

with the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Bank of 

Greece, the Banco de España, the Banque de 

France, the Banca d™Italia, De Nederlandsche 

Bank, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, and 

Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands Bank in cooperation 

with Rahoitustarkastus (the Þ nancial supervision 
authority of Finland). It will end in December 

2010. The aim of the programme is to share EU 

knowledge and experience with the Bank of 

Russia in the area of internal audit and to support 

it in the gradual implementation of the Basel II 

principles in the banking supervisory framework. 
The Þ fth high-level Eurosystem seminar 
with governors of central banks of the EU™s southern and eastern Mediterranean partners Œ
co-organised by the ECB and the Central Bank of 
Egypt Œ took place on 26 and 27 November 2008 
in Alexandria. Governors reviewed recent 
economic and Þ nancial developments in the 
region and discussed monetary policy strategies 
and exchange rate regimes as well as banking 
sector issues in Mediterranean countries. ECB The NCBs of Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 6 Germany, Estonia, Greece, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Romania and the 
United Kingdom.181ECBAnnual Report
2008representatives also participated in a number of meetings that focused on economic and Þ nancial issues within the framework of the Barcelona 
Process: Union for the Mediterranean.Continued cooperation with the Central Bank of Egypt led to the launch of a new three-year 
programme on 1 January 2009, funded by the 
European Commission. The programme will 
involve experts from    (Bulgarian National Bank), eská národní banka, the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Bank 
of Greece, the Banque de France, the Banca 
d™Italia and Banca Naional a României. The programme has three main objectives: to prepare 
guidelines that help the Central Bank of Egypt to 
establish new regulations in line with the basic 
Basel II regime, to Þ nalise the regulations and 
the organisation of their implementation, and 
to design a new scheme for data reporting from 
banks to the Central Bank of Egypt in order that 
the new regulations can be implemented. For the Þ rst time, a high-level Eurosystem 
seminar, co-organised by the ECB and the 
Deutsche Bundesbank, was held with governors 

of central banks and monetary agencies of the 

member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council 

(GCC) 7. It was held in Mainz on 11 and 
12 March 2008. Discussions focused on economic 

developments and structures in GCC countries 

and the GCC™s role in the global economy, in 

particular as regards money and Þ nance as well 
as energy and trade.The ECB, the People™s Bank of China and the Banca d™Italia jointly organised the fourth 
high-level seminar of central banks in the East 
Asia-PaciÞ c region and the euro area at the 
Banca d™Italia in Rome on 26 and 27 June. The 
purpose of the seminar was to exchange views 
on issues confronting policy-makers in both 
regions, such as the Þ nancial turmoil, global 
imbalances and the growth outlook.During 2008 the ECB further strengthened its relations with the People™s Bank of China. A 
Memorandum of Understanding signed by the 
two institutions in 2002 was renewed in 2008. Cooperation has greatly intensiÞ ed over the past 
few years, comprising both high-level meetings 
and enhanced cooperation at the staff level.

20081 ACCOUNTABILITY VIS-À-VIS THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTCentral bank independence has established itself over the past decades as an indispensable element 
of the monetary policy regimes of mature and 
emerging economies. The decision to grant 
central banks independence is Þ rmly grounded 
in economic theory and empirical evidence, both 
of which show that such a set-up is conducive to 
maintaining price stability. At the same time, it 
is a founding principle of democratic societies 
that any independent institution bestowed with a 
public function should be accountable to citizens 
and their elected representatives. In the case of 
an independent central bank, accountability 
can thus be understood as the obligation to 
explain and justify its decisions to citizens and 
their political representatives. Accountability 
is therefore an important counterpart to central 
bank independence.Since its establishment, the ECB has always recognised the fundamental importance of being 
accountable for its policy decisions. As required 
by the Treaty, it has maintained a regular dialogue 
with EU citizens and the European Parliament. 
The ECB™s commitment in this respect is also 
illustrated by the many publications it released 
in 2008 and the numerous speeches delivered by 
the members of the Governing Council during 
the year.The Treaty lays down precise reporting requirements for the ECB, which include the 
publication of a quarterly report, a weekly 
Þ nancial statement and an annual report. The 
ECB in fact exceeds these statutory obligations, 
for instance by publishing a Monthly Bulletin 
(rather than the required quarterly report) and 
by holding monthly press conferences following 
the Þ rst Governing Council meeting of each 
month. The European Parliament Œ as the body which derives its legitimacy directly from the citizens 
of the EU Œ has continued to play a key role in 
holding the ECB to account. In accordance with 
the Treaty, the President of the ECB presented 
the ECB™s Annual Report 2007 to the plenary 
session of the European Parliament in 2008. 
In addition, the President continued to report regularly on the ECB™s monetary policy and 
its other tasks during his quarterly hearings 
before the European Parliament™s Committee 
on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The 
President also appeared before a joint meeting 
of the European Parliament and the national 
parliaments to discuss the EU™s framework for 
safeguarding Þ nancial stability.
Other members of the Executive Board also 
appeared before the European Parliament on 
a number of occasions. The Vice-President 
presented the ECB™s Annual Report 2007 to 
the Committee on Economic and Monetary 
Affairs. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell appeared 
twice before the Committee to inform its 
members about recent developments in the Þ eld of securities clearing and settlement and the 
Eurosystem™s TARGET2-Securities project. 
Jürgen Stark presented the ECB™s Convergence 
Report 2008 to the Committee and participated 
in a discussion on the entry of Slovakia into the 
euro area. Lorenzo Bini Smaghi participated in 
a panel discussion organised by the Committee 
on the Þ rst ten years of EMU and the future 
challenges. In addition, discussions took place between ECB staff and members of the European Parliament on 
matters in which the ECB has speciÞ c expertise (e.g. euro counterfeiting, capital requirements 
and statistics). In line with established practice, 
a delegation of the Committee on Economic and 
Monetary Affairs visited the ECB to exchange 
views with the members of the Executive Board 
on a variety of issues. The ECB also continued 
its voluntary practice of replying to written 
questions from members of the European 
Parliament on issues related to the ECB™s Þ elds of competence. 185ECBAnnual Report
2008During the various exchanges of views between the European Parliament and the ECB, a wide 
range of issues were addressed. The key issues 
raised during these discussions are outlined 
below. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION ON THE 

ECB’S ANNUAL REPORT 2007In line with established practice, the European 
Parliament adopted on 9 July 2008 an own-
initiative resolution on the ECB™s Annual Report 
2007. In its resolution, the European Parliament 
acknowledged the full independence of the 
ECB and recognised that publishing the minutes 
of Governing Council meetings could lead 
to political pressure on Governing Council 
members. The resolution also recognised the 
excellent work of the ECB in managing the 
Þ nancial turmoil and highlighted the fact that 
the major central banks Œ including the ECB Œ 
had warned against underestimating risks prior 
to the onset of the Þ nancial crisis. In addition, 
the resolution underscored the beneÞ ts of the 
Eurosystem™s two-pillar monetary strategy. FINANCIAL REGULATIONThe European Parliament and the ECB 
continued their close dialogue on matters 
concerning Þ nancial regulation. In its resolutions 
on this issue, the European Parliament called for 
appropriate counter-cyclical capital requirements 
for all entities operating in Þ nancial markets. 
The European Parliament also saw a need for 
appropriate disclosure and accounting treatment 
of off-balance-sheet items, and called for more 
and better information on complex products 
and the securitisation process. As regards 
rating agencies, the Parliament advocated the 
establishment of an EU review mechanism, 
and pressed for measures to improve both 
the transparency of rating methodologies and 
quality assurance systems. During his appearance before the joint meeting of the European Parliament and the national 
parliaments on 23 January 2008, the President 
warned that the growing complexity of Þ nancial instruments and the lack of clarity regarding 
the exposure of Þ nancial institutions could give 
rise to increased uncertainty about the degree of 
risk involved and the ultimate bearer of these 
risks, which could prompt a more generalised 
contagion. The President emphasised the need 
to increase transparency and to render the 
regulatory framework more counter-cyclical. 
He also called upon Þ nancial institutions to 
improve their risk management practices. On 
several occasions, the President underlined the 
need for a swift implementation of the strategic 
roadmap of the ECOFIN Council setting out 
the necessary policy responses to the Þ nancial turmoil. THE EU FRAMEWORK FOR FINANCIAL 

SUPERVISION AND STABILITYThe EU framework for Þ nancial supervision 
and stability also featured prominently during 
the discussions between the ECB and the 
European Parliament. In its various resolutions 
on this topic, the European Parliament noted that 
Þ nancial supervision in Europe had not kept pace 
with the integration of EU Þ nancial markets. 
Accordingly, the European Parliament saw a 
need for the creation of ﬁcolleges of supervisorsﬂ 
for the largest cross-border Þ nancial groups, and 
for the strengthening and clariÞ cation of the 
status and accountability of the three Level 3 
Committees of the Lamfalussy framework (see 
Section 2 of Chapter 4 for further information 
on the Lamfalussy framework). The European 
Parliament also urged the ECB and the ESCB 
to play an active role in the elaboration and 
implementation of EU policies on macro-
prudential supervision and Þ nancial stability, 
and called upon supervisors and central banks to 
provide the ECB Œ via the Banking Supervision 
Committee Œ with relevant micro-prudential 
information. Finally, the Parliament advocated 
legislative action with a view to enhancing crisis 
prevention and management arrangements. During his appearances before the Parliament, the President emphasised that the potential of 
the Lamfalussy framework should be further 
exploited and that the decisions foreseen in 
the roadmap on the review of the Lamfalussy 
framework should be implemented swiftly. 
The President also called for the rapid 2 SELECTED TOPICS RAISED AT MEETINGS WITH 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT186ECBAnnual Report
2008implementation of the steps foreseen in the roadmap for strengthening EU arrangements for 
Þ nancial stability. In particular, he stressed the 
need for smooth interplay and an appropriate 
exchange of information between supervisors 
and central banks. TEN YEARS OF EMUThe European Parliament also contributed to 
the discussion on the Þ rst ten years of EMU 
(see Box 12). On 18 November 2008 it adopted 
a resolution setting out its views that the Þ rst ten years of EMU had been a success, with the 
single currency enhancing economic stability 
and integration in the euro area countries. At 
the same time, the Parliament considered that 
more needed to be done to reap the full beneÞ ts of EMU, in particular as regards the pursuit of 
structural reforms and sound Þ scal policies. 
The President of the ECB concurred that 
structural reforms and prudent Þ scal policies 
were crucial to ensure the smooth functioning of 
EMU. He also expressed his concerns about the 
slowdown in the implementation of structural 
reforms and Þ scal consolidation efforts.

COMMUNICATION190ECBAnnual Report
20081 COMMUNICATION POLICY 
External communication at the ECB aims to enhance the public™s understanding of the 
ECB™s policies and decisions. It is an integral 
part of the ECB™s monetary policy and of its 
other tasks. Two key elements Œ openness and 
transparency Œ guide the ECB™s communication 
activities. Both contribute to the effectiveness, 
efÞ ciency and credibility of the ECB™s monetary 
policy. They also support the ECB™s efforts to 
give full account of its actions, as explained in 
more detail in Chapter 6. The concept of real-time, regular and comprehensive explanations of the monetary 
policy assessment and decisions, which was 
introduced in 1999, represents a uniquely 
open and transparent approach to central bank 
communication. Monetary policy decisions are 
explained at a press conference immediately 
after the Governing Council has taken them. 
The President delivers a detailed introductory 
statement at the press conference, explaining the 
Governing Council™s decisions. The President 
and the Vice-President are then at the media™s 
disposal to answer questions. Since December 
2004 decisions taken by the Governing Council 
other than those setting interest rates have also 
been published every month on the websites of 
the Eurosystem central banks. The ECB™s legal acts are made available in all the ofÞ cial languages of the EU, as are the

20082 COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES
The ECB addresses a variety of audiences, such as Þ nancial experts, the media, governments, 
parliaments and the general public, with varying 
levels of knowledge of Þ nance and economics. 
Its mandate and decisions are therefore explained 
through a range of communication tools and 
activities which are constantly being reÞ ned in order to make them as effective as possible, 
taking into account the different audiences and 
the communication environment and needs. The ECB publishes a number of studies and reports, such as the Annual Report, which 
presents a review of the ECB™s activities in the 
previous year and thus contributes to the ECB™s 
accountability. The Monthly Bulletin provides 
regular updates of the ECB™s assessment of 
economic and monetary developments and the 
detailed information underlying its decisions, 
while the Financial Stability Review assesses the 
stability of the euro area Þ nancial system with 
regard to its ability to absorb adverse shocks. All members of the Governing Council directly contribute to enhancing public knowledge 
and understanding of the Eurosystem™s tasks 
and policies by giving testimonies before the 
European Parliament and national parliaments, 
delivering public speeches and granting 
interviews to the media. In 2008 the President 
of the ECB appeared Þ ve times before the 
European Parliament. The members of the 
Executive Board of the ECB delivered around 
300 speeches to a variety of audiences in the 
course of 2008 and granted some 200 interviews 
to the media, as well as having articles published 
in journals, magazines and newspapers. The euro area NCBs play an important role in ensuring the dissemination at the national 
level of Eurosystem information and messages 
to the general public and interested parties. 
They address a variety of national and 
regional audiences in their own languages and 
environments. In 2008 the ECB organised 12 seminars aimed at 
enhancing the knowledge and understanding of 

international and national media representatives, 
either on its own or in cooperation with the EU 

NCBs and the European Journalism Centre. For 

the Þ rst time, one of these seminars was organised 
on the occasion of an external Governing Council 

meeting, on 4 December in Brussels. 
The ECB welcomed approximately 14,000 
visitors to its premises in Frankfurt in 2008. 

The visitors received Þ rst-hand information 
in the form of presentations given by ECB 

experts and managers. Secondary school and 

university students, together with professionals 

from the Þ nancial sector, made up the majority 
of visitors. 
All documents published by the ECB and its various activities are presented on the ECB™s 
website. In 2008 the website received 18 million 
visits (20% more than in the previous year), 
with 126 million pages viewed and 25 million 
documents downloaded. In 2008 the ECB 
replied to around 60,000 enquiries from the 
public requesting information on a number of 
issues related to the ECB™s activities, policies 
and decisions. The ECB™s communication activities in 2008 
focused in particular on explaining the events 

and consequences of the global Þ nancial 
turmoil and the measures adopted by the 

ECB and the Eurosystem. A quarter of all 

public speeches delivered by the members of 

the Executive Board and a third of the ECB™s 

press releases were related to this issue and 

were concentrated in the second half of 2008. 

An increase was witnessed in the number 

of opinions issued by the ECB on Þ scal and 
regulatory measures taken by individual EU 

Member States. There was also a signiÞ cant 
rise in the number of requests received from 

the press, the public and visitors to the ECB 

for information on the Þ nancial turmoil and the 
measures taken by the Eurosystem. The open 

market operations section of the ECB™s website 

was enhanced to meet the increased demand 

for information: a news feed with information 

on monetary policy tender operations was 

introduced, and data on all market operations 

since 1999 were published.192ECBAnnual Report
2008On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, the ECB opened its doors to the general public 
on 1 June 2008. Guided tours of the building, 
workshops, exhibitions and games were 
organised for 1,400 registered visitors. The Cultural Days of the ECB, organised in 2008 in cooperation with all central banks of the 
ESCB, were dedicated to the EU and featured 
artistic contributions from all 27 EU Member 
States. The Cultural Days programme was 
timed to coincide with the ECB™s anniversary 
celebrations, which were attended by EU Heads 
of State and Government and a number of 
Þ gures who had made a major contribution to the 
realisation of EMU. An anniversary edition of 
the Monthly Bulletin was published, providing 
an overview of the Þ rst ten years of EMU and 
examining the challenges ahead. The Fifth ECB 
Central Banking Conference held in Frankfurt 
on 13 and 14 November 2008 on ﬁThe euro at 
ten: lessons and challengesﬂ brought together 
central bankers, academics, market participants 
and the media from all over the world. In 2008 the ECB, in conjunction with Národná banka Slovenska, organised an information 
campaign in preparation for the introduction of 
the euro in Slovakia on 1 January 2009. The logo 
ﬁ• Our moneyﬂ, developed by the Eurosystem, 
was used in all communication activities related 
to the introduction of the euro in Slovakia. The 
Slovakian campaign followed the pattern of the 
communication concept developed for Slovenia, 
Cyprus and Malta. It aimed to familiarise 
professional cash handlers and the general public 
with the visual appearance and security features 
of the euro banknotes and coins, as well as with 
the cash changeover procedures (see Chapter 3). 
In preparation for the launch of the second 
series of euro banknotes in the coming years, a 
communication concept is being developed by 
the Eurosystem central banks.Panel at the Fifth ECB Central Banking Conference on 13 and 14 November 2008CHAPTER 8INSTITUTIONALFRAMEWORK,ORGANISATION ANDANNUAL ACCOUNTS196ECBAnnual Report
20081 DECISION-MAKING BODIES AND CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE OF THE ECB1.1 THE EUROSYSTEM AND THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF CENTRAL BANKS
The Eurosystem is the central banking system of the euro area. It comprises the ECB and the 
NCBs of the EU Member States whose currency 
is the euro (16 since 1 January 2009). The 
Governing Council adopted the term 
ﬁEurosystemﬂ in order to facilitate understanding 
of the structure of central banking in the euro 
area. The term underlines the shared identity, 
teamwork and cooperation of all of its members. 
The Treaty of Lisbon incorporates the term 
ﬁEurosystemﬂ.1The ESCB is composed of the ECB and the 
NCBs of all EU Member States (27 since 
1 January 2007), i.e. it includes the NCBs of the 
Member States which have not yet adopted the 
euro. The ECB is the core of the Eurosystem and the 
ESCB and ensures that their respective tasks 
are carried out either through its own activities 
or via the NCBs. It has legal personality under 
public international law. Each NCB has legal personality according to the law of its respective country. The euro 
area NCBs, which form an integral part of the 
Eurosystem, carry out the tasks conferred upon 
the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules 
established by the ECB™s decision-making 
bodies. The NCBs also contribute to the work 
of the Eurosystem and the ESCB through For more information on the Treaty of Lisbon, see Section 1.2 1 of Chapter 5. GoverningCouncilGoverningCouncilGeneral CouncilGeneral CouncilNationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de BelgiqueDeutsche BundesbankBank of Greece

2008their participation in the Eurosystem/ESCB committees (see Section 1.5 of this chapter). 
They may perform non-Eurosystem functions on 
their own responsibility, unless the Governing 
Council Þ nds that such functions interfere with 
the objectives and tasks of the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed by the decision-making bodies of the ECB: the 
Governing Council and the Executive Board. 
The General Council is constituted as a third 
decision-making body of the ECB, for as long 
as there are EU Member States which have 
not yet adopted the euro. The functioning of 
the decision-making bodies is governed by 
the Treaty, the Statute of the ESCB and the 
relevant Rules of Procedure.2 Decision-making within the Eurosystem and the ESCB is 
centralised. However, the ECB and the euro 
area NCBs jointly contribute, strategically and 
operationally, to attaining the common goals 
of the Eurosystem, with due respect to the 
principle of decentralisation in accordance with 
the Statute of the ESCB. 1.2 THE GOVERNING COUNCIL
The Governing Council comprises the 
members of the Executive Board of the ECB 
and the governors of the NCBs of the Member 
States which have adopted the euro. Its main 
responsibilities, as laid down in the Treaty, are:to adopt the guidelines and take the decisions  Œ
necessary to ensure the performance of the 
tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem; to formulate the monetary policy of the  Œ
euro area, including, as appropriate, decisions relating to intermediate monetary 
objectives, key interest rates and the supply 
of reserves in the Eurosystem, and to 
establish the necessary guidelines for their 
implementation. The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twice 
a month at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurt 
am Main, Germany. It conducts, inter alia, an 
in-depth assessment of monetary and economic 
developments and takes related decisions 
speciÞ cally at its 
Þ rst meeting of the month, 
while the second meeting usually focuses on 
issues related to other tasks and responsibilities 
of the ECB and the Eurosystem. In 2008 two 
meetings were held outside Frankfurt: one was 
hosted by the Bank of Greece in Athens and the 
other by the Nationale Bank van België/Banque 
Nationale de Belgique in Brussels. When taking decisions on monetary policy and on other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem, 
the members of the Governing Council do not 
act as national representatives, but in a fully 
independent personal capacity. This is reß ected by the principle of ﬁone member, one voteﬂ 
applied within the Governing Council. On 
18 December 2008 the Governing Council 
decided to continue its current voting regime 3 and to introduce the rotation system only when 
the number of governors of the euro area NCBs 
exceeds 18.4 This decision was triggered by the increase in the number of governors in the 
Governing Council to 16 as a result of the 
adoption of the euro by Slovakia on 
1 January 2009. At the same time, the Governing For the ECB™s Rules of Procedure, see Decision ECB/2004/2 2 of 19 February 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank, OJ L 80, 18.3.2004, p. 33; Decision 
ECB/2004/12 of 17 June 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure 
of the General Council of the ECB, OJ L 230, 30.6.2004, 
p. 61; and Decision ECB/1999/7 of 12 October 1999 concerning 
the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board of the ECB, 
OJ L 314, 8.12.1999, p. 34. These rules are also available on the 
ECB™s website.
As provided for by Article 10.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, 3 which limits the number of governors with a voting right to 
15 but also foresees the possibility for the Governing Council 
to postpone the implementation of the rotation system until the 
number of governors exceeds 18.
See the press release of 18 December 2008 and Decision 4 ECB/2008/29 to postpone the start of the rotation system in the 
Governing Council of the European Central Bank.198ECBAnnual Report
2008Council decided on the main aspects of the 
implementation of the rotation system
 5 once the 
number of governors exceeds 18. Having 

analysed a number of models, the Governing 

Council opted for the following rotation model: 

governors will rotate in and out of the voting 

right after one month. The number of governors 

rotating at any one time will be determined by 

the difference between the number of governors 

and the number of votes allocated to each group 

minus two, taking the absolute value in the event 

of a negative number. This rotation model 

achieves short periods without vote for 

individual governors and ensures the relative 

stability of the composition of the voting 

college. 6 On 19 December 2002 the Governing Council decided on a 
5 rotation system according to which the NCB governors will 

exercise a voting right with different frequencies depending 

on an indicator of the relative size of the economies of their 

countries within the euro area. Based on this indicator, NCB 

governors will be allocated to different groups. This allocation 

determines how often the governors can exercise a voting right. 

Initially, there will be two groups and, once there are 22 euro 

area countries, there will be three groups. For a description of 

the rotation system, see also the press release of 20 December 

2002 at 
http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2002/html/index. en.htmlThe rotation model will be formally implemented via an ECB

Koenraad De Geest204ECBAnnual Report
2008The Eurosystem/ESCB committees have 
continued to play an important role in assisting 

the ECB™s decision-making bodies in the 

performance of their tasks. At the request of 

both the Governing Council and the Executive 

Board, the committees have provided 

expertise in their Þ elds of competence and 
have facilitated the decision-making process. 

Membership of the committees is usually 

restricted to staff of the Eurosystem central 

banks. However, the NCBs of the Member 

States which have not yet adopted the euro 

take part in the meetings of a committee 

whenever it deals with matters that fall within 

the Þ eld of competence of the General Council. 
Where appropriate, other competent bodies, 

such as national supervisory authorities in the 

case of the Banking Supervision Committee, 

may also be invited. As at 31 December 2008, 

13 Eurosystem/ESCB committees had been 

established under Article 9.1 of the Rules of 

Procedure of the ECB. 
The Budget Committee, which was established under Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure, 
assists the Governing Council in matters related 
to the ECB™s budget. The Human Resources Conference was 
established in 2005 under Article 9a of the 
Rules of Procedure as a forum for the exchange 
of experience, expertise and information among 
Eurosystem/ESCB central banks in the Þ eld of 
human resources management.In line with the Eurosystem mission statement 
and the organisational principles, which state 
the aim of exploiting synergies within the 
Eurosystem and achieving cost-efÞ ciency gains 
through economies of scale, the Governing 
Council established the Eurosystem IT Steering 
Committee (EISC) in August 2007, with a 
mandate to steer continuous improvement in the 
use of IT within the Eurosystem. The EISC™s 
responsibilities relate in particular to Eurosystem 
IT governance, and it aims to increase the 
efÞ ciency and effectiveness of the Governing 
Council™s decision-making on Eurosystem/ESCB 
IT projects and operations. The EISC, composed of one member per Eurosystem central bank, 
reports to the Governing Council via the 
Executive Board.1.6 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
In addition to the decision-making bodies, the 
corporate governance of the ECB encompasses 
a number of external and internal control 
layers, three codes of conduct as well as rules 
concerning public access to ECB documents. EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe Statute of the ESCB provides for two layers, 

namely the external auditor, which is appointed 

to audit the annual accounts of the ECB 

(Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB), and the 

European Court of Auditors, which examines the 

operational efÞ ciency of the management of the 
ECB (Article 27.2). The annual report of the 

European Court of Auditors, together with the 

ECB™s reply, is published on the ECB™s website 

and in the OfÞ cial Journal of the European Union. 
In order to reinforce public assurance as to the 

independence of the ECB™s external auditor, 

the principle of audit Þ rm rotation 
is applied.8 In 2008, in the context of the 
Governing Council™s statutory task of making 

recommendations to the EU Council on the 

appointment of external auditors for the central 

banks of the ESCB, as provided for under 

Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the 

Governing Council approved ﬁGood practices for 

the selection and mandate of External Auditorsﬂ, 

which were published on the ECB™s website. 

These good practices, which provide high-level 

guidance for each Eurosystem central bank when 

selecting external auditors and determining their 

mandate thereafter, enable the Governing Council 

to formulate its recommendations to the EU 

Council on the basis of harmonised, consistent 

and transparent selection criteria. 
KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft AG Wirtschafts-8 prüfungsgesellschaft was the ECB™s external auditor for the Þ nancial years 2003-07. Following the conclusion of a tender 
procedure and in line with the agreed practice of rotating 
audit Þ rms, PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was appointed as the ECB™s 
external auditor for the Þ nancial years 2008-12.
205ECBAnnual Report
2008INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe internal control structure of the ECB is based on an approach in which each organisational 
unit (section, division, directorate or directorate 
general) is responsible for managing its own risks 
and controls, as well as the effectiveness and 
efÞ ciency of its operations. Each organisational 
unit implements operational control procedures 
within its area of responsibility in accordance 
with the risk tolerance set ex ante by the 
Executive Board. For example, a set of rules 
and procedures Œ known as a Chinese wall Œ is 
in place to prevent inside information originating 
in the areas responsible for monetary policy 
from reaching the areas responsible for the 
management of the ECB™s foreign reserves and 
own funds portfolio. In 2008 the ECB continued 
to make progress in its approach to operational 
risk management. First, a central unit in the 
Directorate General Human Resources, Budget 
and Organisation coordinated a comprehensive 
top-down exercise in which business areas 
identiÞ ed operational risks which, if they were 
to materialise, could have signiÞ cant negative 
business, reputational or Þ nancial consequences 
for the ECB. On the basis of this exercise, action 
plans were established for the treatment of such 
risks. Second, the ECB and the euro area NCBs 
developed a framework for operational risk 
management for Eurosystem tasks and processes, 
which will be implemented as of 2009.Independently from the internal control structure and risk monitoring of the ECB, audit missions 
are performed by the Directorate Internal Audit 
under the direct responsibility of the Executive 
Board. In accordance with the mandate deÞ ned in the ECB Audit Charter, 9 the ECB™s internal auditors provide independent and objective 
assurance and consulting services, bringing a 
systematic approach to evaluating and improving 
the effectiveness of risk management, control and 
governance processes. The Directorate Internal 
Audit abides by the International Standards for 
the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing of 
the Institute of Internal Auditors. A Eurosystem/ESCB committee, the Internal Auditors Committee, which is composed of the heads of internal audit at the ECB and the 
NCBs, is responsible for coordinating the 
auditing of Eurosystem/ESCB joint projects and 
operational systems. In order to enhance corporate governance, the Governing Council created an ECB Audit 
Committee in April 2007, composed of three of 
its members, with John Hurley (Governor of the 
Central Bank and Financial Services Authority 
of Ireland) as Chairman. CODES OF CONDUCTThere are three codes of conduct in place at the 

ECB. The Þ rst is for the members of the Governing 
Council and reß ects their responsibility to 
safeguard the integrity and reputation of the 

Eurosystem and to maintain the effectiveness of 

its operations.10 It gives guidance to, and sets 
ethical standards for, the members of the 

Governing Council and their alternates when 

exercising their functions as members of the 

Governing Council. An adviser has also been 

appointed by the Governing Council to provide 

guidance to its members on some aspects of 

professional conduct. The second code is the Code 

of Conduct of the ECB, which gives guidance to, 

and sets benchmarks for, the staff of the ECB and 

the members of the Executive Board, all of whom 

are expected to maintain high standards of 

professional ethics in the performance of their 

duties.11 In accordance with the Code of Conduct™s 
rules against insider trading, the ECB™s staff and 

the members of the Executive Board are prohibited 

from taking advantage of inside information when 

conducting private Þ nancial activities at their own 
risk and for their own account, or at the risk and 

for the account of a third party.12 The third code is 
a Supplementary Code of Ethical Criteria for the

the other two codes by further detailing the ethical 
regime applicable to members of the Executive 

Board. An Ethics Adviser appointed by the 

Executive Board ensures a consistent interpretation 

of these rules. 
ANTI-FRAUD MEASURESIn 1999 the European Parliament and the EU 
Council adopted a regulation 14 to step up the Þ ght against fraud, corruption and any other 
illegal activity detrimental to the Communities™ 
Þ nancial interests. The regulation provides inter 
alia for the internal investigation of suspected 
fraud by the European Anti-Fraud OfÞ ce (OLAF) within the Community institutions, 
bodies, ofÞ ces and agencies. 
The OLAF Regulation foresees that each of the 
latter adopt decisions in order for OLAF to be 
able to carry out its investigations within each 
of them. In June 2004 the Governing Council 
adopted a decision 15 concerning the terms and conditions for investigations by OLAF of the 
ECB, which entered into force on 1 July 2004. PUBLIC ACCESS TO ECB DOCUMENTSThe ECB™s Decision on public access to ECB 
documents 16 adopted in March 2004 is in line with the objectives and standards applied by 
other Community institutions and bodies with 
regard to public access to their documents. It 
enhances transparency, while at the same time 
taking into account the independence of the 
ECB and of the NCBs and ensuring the 
conÞ dentiality of certain matters speci
Þ c to the 
performance of the ECB™s tasks.17 In 2008 the number of public access requests 
remained limited. See the Supplementary Code of Ethical Criteria for the members 13 of the Executive Board, OJ C 230, 23.9.2006, p. 46 and the ECB™s website.

20082.1 HUMAN RESOURCES
In 2008 the ECB continued to implement its human resources (HR) policy framework, which 
incorporates the ECB™s values and the basic HR 
principles.18 The HR policy framework explains why speciÞ c HR policies have been chosen and 
how they relate to one another. Under the 
framework, policies relating to HR management 
fall into four main areas:CORPORATE CULTUREWith staff from the 27 EU Member States, the 
ECB has integrated diversity management into 
its HR practices to ensure that the individual 
competencies of staff are recognised and fully 
utilised for the purpose of achieving the ECB™s 
objectives. The management of diversity at the 
ECB is based on the diversity strategy launched 
in 2006. It seeks to ensure that all members 
of staff are treated with respect and that their 
performance is assessed on the basis of merit. 
In 2008 the ECB organised its Þ rst diversity 
forum for managers with the aim of increasing 
awareness of diversity issues and sharing views 
and experiences on various topics linked to 
gender, nationality and age. The six ECB common values (competence, effectiveness and efÞ ciency, integrity, team 
spirit, transparency and accountability, and 
working for Europe) were further embedded in 
the HR policies with a view to shaping day-to-
day behaviour and improving performance.STAFF DEVELOPMENTThe general principles for internal mobility at 
the ECB, which encourage members of staff 
to change positions after Þ ve years of service, 
continued to receive considerable support. 
Mobility is seen as an opportunity for staff 
to widen their expertise and develop their 
skills and as a means for the ECB to broaden 
awareness among its staff and increase synergies 
across business areas. The internal recruitment 
policy, which places emphasis on broad 
competencies, thus aims to further facilitate 
internal staff mobility. In 2008 165 members 
of staff, including 17 managers and advisers, moved internally to other positions, either on a 
temporary or on a long-term basis.The ECB™s external work experience scheme facilitates the secondment of staff to the 27 
NCBs in the EU or to relevant international 
organisations (e.g. the IMF and the BIS) for 
periods of two to twelve months. 23 members 
of staff were seconded under this scheme in 
2008. In addition, the ECB granted unpaid 
leave, for up to three years, to 30 members of 
staff. Many of them (19) took up employment 
at NCBs, international organisations or private 
companies. Others used these periods of unpaid 
leave for study purposes. The total number of 
staff members on unpaid leave at the end of 
December 2008 was 54 (compared with 56 in 
2007), while the number of staff on parental 
leave was 26 (compared with 23 in 2007).In addition to promoting mobility, including managerial rotation, the HR strategy continued 
to focus on the development of ECB staff and, 
in particular, on strengthening managerial 
skills through training and individual coaching. 
Training for managers concentrated on the 
enhancement of team performance, leadership 
and recruitment skills, and various aspects of 
performance management. Managers also participated in the multi-source feedback exercise in which directly reporting 
staff, peers and external contacts identify areas 
for managers™ personal development. Based 
on the results of the multi-source feedback, 
individual coaching was provided.The continuous acquisition and development of skills and competencies by all members of staff 
remains a cornerstone of the ECB™s HR strategy. 
As a basic principle, learning and development 
are a shared responsibility between staff and 
institution. On the one hand, the ECB provides 
the budgetary means and training framework 
and managers deÞ ne the training needs of staff 
The basic HR principles are: organisational need, decentralised 18 staff management, merit, diversity, attractive employment conditions and reciprocal commitment.2 ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
208ECBAnnual Report
2008for their current position. On the other hand, staff have to take the necessary steps for learning 
and development and ensure that their expertise 
is maintained at the highest level. In addition 
to numerous in-house training opportunities, 
staff continued to take up external training 
opportunities to address individual training 
needs of a more ﬁtechnicalﬂ nature. They also 
beneÞ ted from training opportunities organised 
as part of ESCB programmes or offered by 
the NCBs. In the context of its secondary training policy, the ECB provided 12 members of staff with 
support to acquire a qualiÞ cation that would 
increase their professional competence beyond 
the requirements of their current position. RECRUITMENTAt the end of 2008 the actual full-time equivalent 
number of staff holding contracts with the ECB 
was 1,536 19 (compared with 1,478 at the end of 2007).External recruitment to Þ ll permanent positions 
was carried out on the basis of Þ xed-term contracts of Þ ve years for managerial positions 
and three years for other positions, which may be converted into unlimited contracts, 
subject to organisational considerations and 
individual performance. Fixed-term contracts 
may also be issued to replace permanent staff 
who are temporarily absent for periods of 
more than 12 months, for instance in cases of 
parental or unpaid leave. In 2008 the ECB 
offered a total of 108 Þ xed-term contracts. By 
contrast, 45 members of staff with Þ xed-term or permanent contracts left the ECB in 2008. 
Furthermore, 113 short-term contracts were 
issued during 2008 (in addition to some contract 
extensions from 2007) to cover for absences of 
less than one year, while 83 short-term contracts 
expired in the course of the year. The ECB also offers short-term contracts to staff from NCBs and international 
organisations, thus allowing the ECB and 
these organisations to gain from each other™s 
experience. Employing NCB staff on a short-term basis also helps to foster an 
ESCB-wide team spirit. On 31 December 2008 
122 employees from NCBs and international 
organisations were working at the ECB on 
various assignments (compared with 91 on 
31 December 2007).In September 2008 the third intake of participants in the ECB™s Graduate Programme, 
which is aimed at recent graduates with a broad 
educational background, joined the Bank on 
the basis of two-year non-convertible contracts. 
The Þ rst generation of participants completed 
the Graduate Programme in 2008, and a large 
number of them successfully applied for 
convertible Þ xed-term positions at the ECB.
The internship opportunities offered by the 
ECB focused on students and graduates with 
backgrounds in economics, statistics, business 
administration, law and translation. On 
31 December 2008 84 interns were being hosted 
by the ECB.The ECB also offered two fellowships as part of the Wim Duisenberg Research Fellowship 
Programme, which is open to leading 
economists, and Þ ve fellowships to young 
researchers in the context of its Lamfalussy 
Fellowship Programme. EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONSTaking into account the most recent 
developments regarding life expectancy 
and long-term Þ nancing, the ECB has been 
conducting a review of the retirement plan it 
offers to its staff. The results of this review are 
expected to be implemented in early 2009.In 2008 the ECB also started a review of its disciplinary and appeals procedures. The 
changes introduced were aimed at increasing the 
effectiveness and efÞ ciency of both procedures 
while preserving the rights granted to members 
of staff.  Staff on unpaid leave of absence are excluded. This number 19 includes staff with permanent, Þ xed or short-term contracts and 
the participants in the ECB™s Graduate Programme. Staff on maternity or long-term sick leave are also included.209ECBAnnual Report
2008In order to improve the balance between professional and private life, and to further 
develop the resilience of the ECB, the Executive 
Board decided in 2008 to launch a pilot project 
with a view to progressively introducing 
teleworking. After completion of the project 
in 2009, the beneÞ ts and drawbacks will be 
carefully assessed before a decision is taken on 
whether to extend the scheme.2.2 THE HUMAN RESOURCES CONFERENCE 
The activities of the Human Resources 
Conference (HRC) and its substructures 
covered multiple aspects of staff training 
and development in 2008. Based on a needs 
analysis, new ESCB training activities have 
been developed and will be introduced in 
2009. The HRC also took measures to increase 
intra-ESCB mobility with a view to extending 
opportunities for staff from Eurosystem/ESCB 
central banks to learn from one another and 
promoting cooperation and team spirit.Furthermore, with the aim of exchanging experiences and moving towards the 
establishment of best practices, the HRC and the 
Eurosystem/ESCB Communications Committee 
organised a conference on communication 
in HR, at which all ESCB central banks were 
represented. At its meetings, the HRC covered 
other topics, such as demographics, assessment 
centres, and the future of HR in Europe and the 
key challenges up until 2015.2.3  NEW ECB PREMISES
Further progress was made in 2008 with regard 
to the ECB™s new premises in the Ostend part of 
Frankfurt. In April 2008 preparatory works commenced on the new site in advance of the building works. 
The two four-storey annex buildings at the 
end of the Grossmarkthalle were demolished 
manually, with most of the clinker bricks being 
reserved for the renovation of the facade of the Grossmarkthalle in order to retain the colouring 
and texture of the original bricks. In late spring 
initial excavation works began for the two 
basement ß oors of the of
Þ ce towers and the 
underground staff car park in the southern part of 
the site. The foundation piles were subsequently 
inserted into the ground. These preliminary 
works were completed by September 2008, on 
schedule and within budget. On 6 May 2008 the Lord Mayor of the City of Frankfurt, Petra Roth, presented the 
building permit for the ECB™s new premises 
to the President of the ECB. The building 
permit constitutes formal legal approval for 
the new premises on the site of the former 
Grossmarkthalle. On 25 June 2008 the ECB decided to formally close the international public tender procedure 
for a general contractor to construct the new 
ECB premises, since it had not produced a 
satisfactory economic result, with the received 
bid considerably exceeding the ECB™s estimated 
budget. During the summer and autumn of 
2008, the architects and planners conducted an 
in-depth analysis of the situation in the 
construction market. On the basis of this 
analysis, the Governing Council decided in 
November 2008 to change the tender strategy, 
dividing up the construction works into separate 
trades and lots, and to re-launch the tender 
process for the construction works accordingly. 
In the course of 2009 around 15 distinct 
invitations to tender will be issued for the 
structural works, the facade and other parts of 
the building. The aim of this tender strategy is 
to attract more competitive bids, including from 
medium-sized companies, and to Þ nd specialised 
companies for each trade. The tender strategy 
will be based on balanced contractual terms 
which are frequently used in the construction 
market.The ECB remains fully committed to adhering to the estimated building costs of around 
•500 million (at 2005 constant prices). These 
costs are revaluated in line with the relevant 
ofÞ cial price indices compiled by the German 
210ECBAnnual Report
2008statistical ofÞ ce (Statistisches Bundesamt). 
The construction of new premises designed to meet the ECB™s speciÞ c needs is considered to 
represent the best option in terms of value for 
money. At the end of 2009, following the evaluation of the tenders, the Governing Council will take the 
necessary follow-up decisions. 2.4 THE EUROSYSTEM PROCUREMENT 
COORDINATION OFFICEIn July 2007 the Governing Council decided 
to establish the Eurosystem Procurement 
Coordination OfÞ ce (EPCO) in order to 
enhance cooperation within the Eurosystem in 
the Þ eld of procurement. A total of 20 central 
banks from the ESCB participate on a voluntary 
basis. In December 2007 the Banque centrale du 
Luxembourg was designated to host EPCO from 
1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012. In 2008 
all four EPCO staff members were recruited 
and seven meetings of procurement experts 
from the participating central banks were held. 
Work focused on establishing best practices. 
In November 2008 the Governing Council 
adopted a decision laying down the framework 
for joint Eurosystem procurement. Based on 
this decision, which aims to ensure a level 
playing-Þ eld for central banks participating in 
joint procurements, the Governing Council also 
approved a procurement plan for 2009. EPCO 
is guided by the EPCO Steering Committee, 
which reports to the Governing Council via the 
Executive Board. 211ECBAnnual Report
20083 ESCB SOCIAL DIALOGUE
The ESCB Social Dialogue is a consultative forum involving the ECB and employee 
representatives from the central banks of the 
ESCB and from European trade union 
federations 20. Its purpose is to provide information and foster exchanges of views on 
issues that may have a major impact on 
employment conditions at the central banks of 
the ESCB. This information is provided in a biannual newsletter and at meetings held in April and 
October. The meetings held in 2008 focused 
on the issues of cooperation and specialisation 
in the Eurosystem, the Treaty of Lisbon and 
its impact on the ESCB, and the role of market 
operations and Þ nancial supervision in times 
of turbulence. Issues relating to banknote 
production and circulation, as well as payment 
systems (TARGET2, TARGET2-Securities and 
CCBM2), were also discussed. The employee 
representatives were also informed of the work 
being carried out by the HRC.An ad hoc working group on banknote production and circulation was set up. It 
involved a very limited number of participants 
and aimed to address technical questions relating 
to banknotes prior to the plenary meeting of the 
ESCB Social Dialogue.The Standing Committee of European Central Bank Unions 20 (SCECBU), Union Network International Œ Europa (UNI-Europa Finance) and the European Federation of Public Service Unions 
(EPSU).212ECBAnnual Report

The ECB™s activities in 2008 are described in detail in the relevant chapters of the Annual 
Report.2 OBJECTIVES AND TASKS
The ECB™s objectives and tasks are described 
in the Statute of the ESCB (Articles 2 and 3). 
An overview of performance against these 
objectives is included in the President™s 
foreword to the Annual Report. 3 KEY RESOURCES, RISKS AND PROCESSES
GOVERNANCE OF THE ECBInformation relating to the governance of the ECB is given in Chapter 8. MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARDThe members of the Executive Board are appointed 

from among persons of recognised standing and 

professional experience in monetary or banking 

matters by common accord of the governments 

of the Member States at the level of the Heads 

of State or Government, upon a recommendation 

from the EU Council after it has consulted the 

European Parliament and the Governing Council. 
The terms and conditions of members™ employment are determined by the Governing 
Council, based on a proposal from a Committee 
comprising three members appointed by 
the Governing Council and three members 
appointed by the EU Council.The emoluments of the members of the Executive Board are set out in note 29 ﬁStaff 
costsﬂ of the Annual Accounts.EMPLOYEESThe average number of staff (full-time equivalent) 

holding contracts with the ECB 1 rose from 1,448 
in 2007 to 1,499 in 2008. At the end of that year 

1,536 staff were employed. For further details, 

see note 29 ﬁStaff costsﬂ of the Annual Accounts 

and Chapter 8, Section 2, which also describes 

the ECB™s human resources strategy.INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserves portfolio consists of 
foreign reserve assets transferred to it by the euro 
area NCBs in accordance with the provisions 
of Article 30 of the Statute of the ESCB, and 
the income thereon. It serves to fund the ECB™s 
operations in the foreign exchange market for 
the purposes set out in the Treaty.The ECB™s own funds portfolio reß ects the 
investment of its paid-up capital, the counterpart of the provision against foreign exchange, 
interest rate and gold price risks, the general 
reserve fund and income accumulated on the 
portfolio in the past. Its purpose is to provide the 
ECB with income to contribute to the coverage 
of its operating expenses.The ECB™s investment activities and its management of the associated risks are described 
in greater detail in Chapter 2.THE BUDGET PROCESSThe Budget Committee (BUCOM), composed 
of ECB and euro area NCB experts, is a key 
contributor to the ECB™s Þ nancial governance 
process. In accordance with Article 15 of the 
Rules of Procedure, BUCOM supports the 
Governing Council by providing a detailed 
evaluation of annual ECB budget proposals and 
requests for supplementary budget funding by 
the Executive Board, prior to their submission to 
the Governing Council for approval. Spending 
against agreed budgets is monitored regularly 
by the Executive Board, taking into account 
the advice of the ECB™s internal controlling Staff on unpaid leave of absence are excluded. This number 1 includes staff with permanent, Þ xed or short-term contracts and 
the participants in the ECB™s Graduate Programme. Staff on maternity or long-term sick leave are also included.MANAGEMENT REPORT FOR THE YEAR 
ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2008214ECBAnnual Report
2008function, and by the Governing Council with the assistance of BUCOM.4 FINANCIAL RESULT 
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTSUnder Article 26.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Annual Accounts of the ECB are drawn up 
by the Executive Board, in accordance with 
the principles established by the Governing 
Council. The accounts are then approved by the 
Governing Council and subsequently published.PROVISION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, 

INTEREST RATE AND GOLD PRICE RISKS 
Since most of the ECB™s assets and liabilities are 
periodically revalued at current market exchange 
rates and security prices, the ECB™s proÞ tability is strongly affected by exchange rate exposures 
and, to a lesser extent, interest rate exposures. 
These exposures stem mainly from its holdings 
of foreign reserve assets held in US dollars, 
Japanese yen and gold, which are predominantly 
invested in interest-bearing instruments. In 2005, taking into account the ECB™s large exposure to these risks and the size of its 
revaluation accounts, the Governing Council 
decided to establish a provision against foreign 
exchange rate, interest rate and gold price 
risks. As at 31 December 2007, this provision 
amounted to •2,668,758,313. In accordance 
with Article 49.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central 
Bank of Malta also contributed the amounts 
of •4,795,450 and •2,388,127 respectively 
to the provision with effect from 1 January 
2008. Taking the results of its assessment into 
account, the Governing Council decided to 
transfer as at 31 December 2008 an additional 
amount of •1,339,019,690 to the provision. 
This transfer increased the size of the provision 
to its permitted maximum of •4,014,961,580. 
The Governing Council has decided that the 
provision, together with any amounts held in the 
ECB™s general reserve fund, may not exceed the value of the capital shares paid up by the euro 
area NCBs.This provision will be used to cover realised and unrealised losses, in particular valuation 
losses not covered by the revaluation accounts. 
Its size and continuing requirement is reviewed 
annually, taking a range of factors into account, 
including in particular the level of holdings of 
risk-bearing assets, the extent of materialised 
risk exposures in the current Þ nancial year, 
projected results for the coming year, and a risk 
assessment involving calculations of Values 
at Risk (VaR) on risk-bearing assets, which is 
applied consistently over time. FINANCIAL RESULT FOR 2008The net income of the ECB prior to the transfer 
to the provision against risks was •2,661 million, 
compared with •286 million in 2007. The net 
proÞ t of •1,322 million after the transfer was 
made was distributed to the NCBs. In 2007, the appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese 
yen resulted in write-downs in the euro value 
of the ECB™s holdings of assets denominated in 
these currencies. These write-downs amounted to 
some •2.5 billion and were expensed in the ProÞ t and Loss Account. In 2008, the depreciation 
of the euro vis-à-vis the Japanese yen and the 
US dollar resulted in unrealised gains of some 
•3.6 billion. These gains were recorded in 
revaluation accounts, in line with the common 
accounting policies that have been established 
by the Governing Council for the Eurosystem. In 2008, net interest income decreased to •2,381 million from •2,421 million in 2007, 
owing mainly to (a) lower net interest income 
denominated in US dollars, and (b) higher 
remuneration of NCBs™ claims in respect of 
foreign reserves transferred. The resulting 
decrease in net interest income was only partially 
offset by the increase in interest income arising 
from the allocation of euro banknotes within 
the Eurosystem, mainly reß ecting the general 
increase in euro banknotes in circulation.215ECBAnnual Report
2008Net realised gains arising from Þ nancial operations decreased from •779 million in 2007 to •662 million in 2008, due mainly to the lower 
volume of gold sold in accordance with the 
Central Bank Gold Agreement, which came into 
effect on 27 September 2004 and of which the 
ECB is a signatory. The resulting lower realised 
gains from these operations were only partially 
offset by higher net realised gains from security 
sales in 2008, following the drop in US interest 
rates in that year.Total administrative expenses of the ECB, including depreciation, increased from 
•385 million in 2007 to •388 million in 2008. CHANGE TO THE CAPITAL OF THE ECBPursuant to Council Decisions 2007/503/EC 
and 2007/504/EC of 10 July 2007, Cyprus 
and Malta adopted the single currency on 
1 January 2008. Consequently, in accordance 
with Article 49.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central 
Bank of Malta paid up the remainder of their 
capital subscription to the ECB as of that 
date. As a result of these payments, the ECB™s

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUESOn the basis of the ECB™s ﬁEnvironmental Policy Frameworkﬂ, adopted at the end of 
2007, an inventory of environmental aspects of 
the ECB™s administration and a Þ rst estimate 
of its ecological impact were prepared in 
2008. The ECB has also decided to establish 
an environmental management system that is 
compliant with the internationally recognised 
standards ISO 14001 and EMAS. A project 
has been launched to obtain certiÞ cation of the 
bank™s environmental management system in 
2010, and some measures were successfully 
implemented in 2008.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICE 

MANAGEMENT 
In 2008, the ECB was the Þ rst central bank 
to receive certiÞ cation of compliance with 
international standard ISO/IEC 20000 for 
excellence in IT service management (ITSM). 
ISO/IEC 20000 describes an integrated set of 
management processes for the effective delivery 
of IT services to the business and its customers. 
Its application was a major contribution to the 
delivery of IT services at the ECB and it has 
already resulted in measurable beneÞ ts and 
higher end-user satisfaction. 216ECBAnnual Report

2008FORM AND PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTSThe Þ nancial statements of the ECB have been 
designed to present fairly the Þ nancial position 
of the ECB and the results of its operations. 
They have been drawn up in accordance with 
the following accounting policies,2 which the Governing Council of the ECB considers to be 
appropriate to the nature of central bank 
activity. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe following accounting principles have been 
applied: economic reality and transparency, 
prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet 
events, materiality, the accruals principle, going 
concern, consistency and comparability.RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIESAn asset or liability is only recognised in 
the Balance Sheet when it is probable that 
any associated future economic beneÞ t will 
ß ow to or from the ECB, substantially all of 
the associated risks and rewards have been 
transferred to the ECB, and the cost or value of 
the asset or the amount of the obligation can be 
measured reliably.BASIS OF ACCOUNTINGThe accounts have been prepared on a historical 
cost basis, modiÞ ed to include market valuation of marketable securities, gold and all other on-
balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currency. 
Transactions in Þ nancial assets and liabilities 
are reß ected in the accounts on the basis of the 
date on which they were settled. With the exception of securities, transactions 
in Þ nancial instruments denominated in foreign 
currency are recorded in off-balance-sheet 

accounts on the trade date. At the settlement 
date the off-balance-sheet entries are reversed 

and transactions are booked on-balance-sheet. 

Purchases and sales of foreign currency affect 
the net foreign currency position on the trade date 

and realised results arising from sales are also 

calculated on that date. Accrued interest, premiums 

and discounts related to Þ nancial instruments 
denominated in foreign currency are calculated 

and recorded daily, and the foreign currency 

position is also affected daily by these accruals. 
GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND 

LIABILITIESAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency are converted into euro at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet 
date. Income and expenses are converted at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the recording date. 
The revaluation of foreign exchange assets and 
liabilities, including on-balance-sheet and off-
balance-sheet instruments, is performed on a 
currency-by-currency basis.Revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 
is treated separately from the exchange rate 
revaluation. Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at the year-end. No distinction is made between 
the price and currency revaluation differences 
for gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is 
accounted for on the basis of the price in euro 
per Þ ne ounce of gold, which, for the year 
ending 31 December 2008, was derived from 
the exchange rate of the euro against the US 
dollar on 31 December 2008.SECURITIES 
All marketable securities and similar assets are 
valued either at the mid-market prices or on the 
basis of the relevant yield curve prevailing at the 
Balance Sheet date, on a security-by-security 
basis. For the year ending 31 December 2008, The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in 
1 Decision ECB/2006/17, OJ L 348, 11.12.2006, p. 38, as amended.These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 2 of the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised approach 
to the rules governing the accounting and Þ nancial reporting of 
Eurosystem operations.ACCOUNTING POLICIES1220ECBAnnual Report
2008mid-market prices on 30 December 2008 were used. Non-marketable securities are valued at 
cost, while illiquid equity shares are valued at 
cost subject to impairment.INCOME RECOGNITIONIncome and expenses are recognised in the 
period in which they are earned or incurred. 
Realised gains and losses arising from the sale of 
foreign exchange, gold and securities are taken 
to the ProÞ t and Loss Account. Such realised 
gains and losses are calculated by reference to 
the average cost of the respective asset.Unrealised gains are not recognised as income but are transferred directly to a revaluation 
account.Unrealised losses are taken to the ProÞ t and Loss 
Account if they exceed previous revaluation gains registered in the corresponding revaluation 
account. Unrealised losses in any one security 
or currency or in gold are not netted against 
unrealised gains in other securities or currencies 
or gold. In the event of an unrealised loss on any 
item at the year-end, the average cost of that 
item is reduced to the year-end exchange rate or 
market price.Premiums or discounts arising on purchased securities are calculated and presented as part 
of interest income and are amortised over the 
remaining life of the assets.REVERSE TRANSACTIONSReverse transactions are operations whereby 
the ECB buys or sells assets under a repurchase 
agreement or conducts credit operations against 
collateral.Under a repurchase agreement, securities are sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement 
to repurchase them from the counterparty at an 
agreed price on a set future date. Repurchase 
agreements are recorded as collateralised inward 
deposits on the liability side of the Balance 
Sheet and also lead to an interest expense in the ProÞ t and Loss Account. Securities sold under 
such an agreement remain on the Balance Sheet 
of the ECB. Under a reverse repurchase agreement, securities are bought for cash with a simultaneous 
agreement to sell them back to the counterparty 
at an agreed price on a set future date. 
Reverse repurchase agreements are recorded 
as collateralised loans on the asset side of the 
Balance Sheet but are not included in the ECB™s 
security holdings. They give rise to interest 
income in the ProÞ t and Loss Account.
Reverse transactions (including security lending 
transactions) conducted under an automated 
security lending programme are recorded on the 
Balance Sheet only where collateral is provided 
in the form of cash placed on an account of 
the ECB. In 2008 the ECB did not receive any 
collateral in the form of cash in connection with 
such transactions.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTSCurrency instruments, namely foreign exchange 
forward transactions, forward legs of foreign 
exchange swaps and other currency instruments 
involving an exchange of one currency for 
another at a future date, are included in the net 
foreign currency position for the purpose of 
calculating foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest rate instruments are revalued on an item-by-item basis. Daily changes in the variation 
margin of open interest rate futures contracts 
are recorded in the ProÞ t and Loss Account. The 
valuation of forward transactions in securities 
and of interest rate swaps is based on generally 
accepted valuation methods using observable 
market prices and rates and the discount factors 
from the settlement dates to the valuation date. POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTSAssets and liabilities are adjusted for events that 
occur between the annual Balance Sheet date 
and the date on which the Governing Council 
approves the Þ nancial statements, if such events 
221ECBAnnual Report
2008materially affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date. Important post-balance-sheet events that do not affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the 
Balance Sheet date are disclosed in the notes.INTRA-ESCB BALANCES/INTRA-EUROSYSTEM 

BALANCESIntra-ESCB transactions are cross-border 

transactions that occur between two EU 

central banks. These transactions are processed 

primarily via TARGET23 Œ the Trans-European 
Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express 

Transfer system (see Chapter 2) Œ and give 

rise to bilateral balances in accounts held 

between those EU central banks connected to 

TARGET2. These bilateral balances are then 

assigned to the ECB on a daily basis, leaving 

each NCB with a single net bilateral position 

vis-à-vis the ECB only. This position in the 

books of the ECB represents the net claim or 

liability of each NCB against the rest of the 

ESCB. 
Euro-denominated intra-ESCB balances of the euro area NCBs with the ECB (except for 
the capital of the ECB and positions resulting 
from the transfer of foreign reserve assets to 
the ECB) are described as intra-Eurosystem 
claims or liabilities and are presented in the 
Balance Sheet of the ECB as a single net asset 
or liability position. Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystem are included as a single net 
asset under ﬁClaims related to the allocation 
of euro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ 
(see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).Intra-ESCB balances of non-euro area NCBs with the ECB, arising from their participation in 
TARGET2,4 are disclosed under ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ. TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETSFixed assets, with the exception of land, 
are valued at cost less depreciation. Land is 
valued at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a 
straight-line basis, beginning in the quarter after 
acquisition and continuing over the period for 
which the asset is expected to be available for 
use, as follows:The depreciation period for capitalised building and refurbishment expenditure relating to the 
ECB™s existing premises has been reduced in 
order to ensure that these assets are completely 
written off before the ECB moves to its new 
premises. THE ECB’S RETIREMENT PLAN AND OTHER 

POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITSThe ECB operates a deÞ ned bene
Þ t scheme 
for its staff. This is funded by assets held in a 
long-term employee-beneÞ t fund. 
BALANCE SHEETThe liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in 
respect of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t plans is the present 
value of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation at the 
Balance Sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets used to fund the obligation, adjusted for 
unrecognised actuarial gains or losses. The technically decentralised Þ rst-generation system was 
3 progressively replaced by a second-generation system (TARGET2) system, which is based on a single technical 
infrastructure, the Single Shared Platform (SSP). The migration  

to TARGET2 started in November 2007 and was completed in 
May 2008.
As at 31 December 2008, the non-euro area NCBs participating 4 in TARGET2 were: Danmarks Nationalbank, Latvijas Banka, 
Lietuvos bankas, Narodowy Bank Polski and Eesti Pank.Computers, related hardware and 
software, and motor vehicles 4 yearsEquipment, furniture and plant in 
building 10 yearsFixed assets costing less than •10,000Written off in the 
year of acquisition222ECBAnnual Report
2008The deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value 
of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash ß ows, using interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds that are denominated in euro and have 
similar terms of maturity to the term of the 
related pension liability.Actuarial gains and losses can arise from experience adjustments (where actual outcomes 
are different from the actuarial assumptions 
previously made) and changes in actuarial 
assumptions.PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNTThe net amount charged to the ProÞ t and Loss 
Account comprises: the current service cost of the beneÞ ts (a) accruing for the year; interest at the discount rate on the deÞ ned (b) beneÞ t obligation;
the expected return on the plan assets; and (c) any actuarial gains and losses recognised in (d) the ProÞ t and Loss Account, using a ﬁ10% 
corridorﬂ approach.“10% CORRIDOR” APPROACHNet cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains and losses which exceed the greater of (a) 10% of the 
present value of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation 
and (b) 10% of the fair value of plan assets, 
are to be amortised over the expected average 
remaining working lives of the participating 
employees. PENSIONS OF EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS AND 

OTHER POST-RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
Unfunded arrangements are in place for the 
pensions of members of the Executive Board 
of the ECB and disability beneÞ t provisions for 
the staff. The expected costs of these beneÞ ts are accrued over the Executive Board/staff 
members™ terms of ofÞ ce/employment using an 
accounting approach similar to that of deÞ ned beneÞ t pension plans. Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised in the same manner as 
outlined above. These obligations are valued annually by independent actuaries to establish the appropriate 
liability in the Þ nancial statements.
BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATIONThe ECB and the euro area NCBs, which 
together comprise the Eurosystem, issue euro 
banknotes.5 The total value of euro banknotes in circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem central 
banks on the last working day of each month in 
accordance with the banknote allocation key.6 The ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of 
the total value of euro banknotes in circulation, 
which is disclosed under the Balance Sheet 
liability item ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ. The 
ECB™s share of the total euro banknote issue is 
backed by claims on the NCBs. These claims, 
which bear interest,7 are disclosed under the sub-item ﬁIntra-Eurosystem claims: claims 
related to the allocation of euro banknotes within 
the Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/
intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies). Interest income on these 
claims is included within the item ﬁNet interest 
incomeﬂ. This income is due to the NCBs in the 
Þ nancial year in which it accrues, but is 
distributed on the second working day of the 
following year.8 It is distributed in full unless Decision ECB/2001/15 of 6 December 2001 on the issue of euro 5 banknotes, OJ L 337, 20.12.2001, p. 52, as amended.ﬁBanknote allocation keyﬂ means the percentages that result from 6 taking into account the ECB™s share in the total euro banknote 
issue and applying the subscribed capital key to the NCBs™ share 
in that total.
Decision ECB/2001/16 of 6 December 2001 on the allocation of 7 monetary income of the national central banks of participating 
Member States from the Þ nancial year 2002, OJ L 337, 
20.12.2001, p. 55, as amended.
Decision ECB/2005/11 of 17 November 2005 on the distribution 8 of the income of the European Central Bank on euro banknotes 
in circulation to the national central banks of the participating 
Member States, OJ L 311, 26.11.2005, p. 41.223ECBAnnual Report
2008the ECB™s net proÞ t for the year is less than its 
income earned on euro banknotes in circulation, and subject to any decisions by the Governing 
Council to make transfers to a provision for 
foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 
price risks and/or to charge costs incurred by the 
ECB in connection with the issue and handling 
of euro banknotes against this income.RECLASSIFICATIONSA number of items were reclassiÞ ed in 2008 for 
presentational reasons and the comparable 
balances as at 31 December 2007 have been 
adjusted accordingly. These reclassiÞ cations are 
described in the Notes on the Balance Sheet.9 OTHER ISSUESTaking account of the ECB™s role as a central 
bank, the Executive Board considers that the 
publication of a cash ß ow statement would not 
provide the readers of the Þ nancial statements 
with any additional relevant information.In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute of the ESCB, and on the basis of a 
recommendation of the Governing Council, 
the EU Council has approved the appointment 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the external 
auditors of the ECB for a Þ ve-year period up to 
the end of the Þ nancial year 2012.
The reclassiÞ cations comply with the accounting policies of the 
9 ECB laid down in Decision ECB/2006/17, OJ L 348, 11.12.2006, p. 38, as amended.   224ECBAnnual Report
20081 GOLD AND GOLD RECEIVABLES 
As at 31 December 2008 the ECB held 17,156,546 ounces of Þ ne gold (2007: 
18,091,733 ounces). The reduction was due to 
(a) sales of 963,987 ounces of Þ ne gold in 
accordance with the Central Bank Gold 
Agreement, which came into effect on 
27 September 2004 and of which the ECB is a 
signatory, and (b) the transfer by the Central 
Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta 
to the ECB of 19,151 and 9,649 ounces of Þ ne gold 10 respectively upon the adoption of the single currency by Cyprus and Malta, in 
accordance with Article 30.1 of the Statute of 
the ESCB. The decrease in the euro equivalent 
value of this holding, resulting from these 
transactions, was more than offset by a 
signiÞ cant rise in the price of gold during 2008 
(see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and 
liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).2 CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA AND EURO 
AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN 

CURRENCYRECEIVABLES FROM THE IMF 
This asset represents the ECB™s holdings 

of special drawing rights (SDRs) as at 

31 December 2008. It arises as the result of a 

two-way SDR buying and selling arrangement 

with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 

whereby the IMF is authorised to arrange 

sales or purchases of SDRs against euro, 

on behalf of the ECB, within minimum and 

maximum holding levels. The SDR is deÞ ned 
in terms of a basket of currencies. Its value 

is determined as the weighted sum of the 

exchange rates of four major currencies (euro, 

Japanese yen, pound sterling and US dollar). 

For accounting purposes, SDRs are treated 

as a foreign currency (see ﬁGold and foreign 

currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on 

accounting policies). 
BALANCES WITH BANKS AND SECURITY 

INVESTMENTS, EXTERNAL LOANS AND OTHER 

EXTERNAL ASSETS; AND CLAIMS ON EURO AREA 

RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY 
These two items consist of balances with banks 
and loans denominated in foreign currency, 
and investments in securities denominated in 
US dollars and Japanese yen. The amortisation 
of discounts and premiums on securities 
denominated in foreign currency was previously 
included under the headings ﬁAccruals and 
prepaid expensesﬂ and ﬁAccruals and income 
collected in advanceﬂ respectively. The ECB has 
decided, for presentational reasons, to reclassify 
these items under the heading ﬁBalances with 
banks and security investments, external loans 
and other external assetsﬂ. The comparable 
balances as at 31 December 2007 have been 
adjusted accordingly.The increase in current accounts held with 
non-euro area residents is due mainly to 

(a) the settlement of the Danish krone leg of swap 

transactions with Danmarks Nationalbank that 

were outstanding on 31 December 2008 amounting 
The transfers, with an aggregate value equivalent to •16.5 million, 
10 were made with effect from 1 January 2008.

In 2007 money market deposits and current 
accounts held with non-euro area residents as a 
direct counterpart to the capital and reserves of 
the ECB were included under this heading. The 
ECB has decided to reclassify these holdings 
as a dedicated portfolio, which is now included 
under the heading ﬁOther Þ nancial assetsﬂ. The 
comparable balance as at 31 December 2007 has 
been adjusted accordingly. As at 31 December 2008 this item consisted 
mainly of a claim of •460.0 million on the 
Magyar Nemzeti Bank in connection with 
an agreement established with the ECB on 
repurchase transactions. This agreement 
provides the Magyar Nemzeti Bank with a 
facility to borrow up to •5 billion in order to 
support its domestic operations for the provision 
of euro liquidity. 4 OTHER CLAIMS ON EURO AREA CREDIT 
INSTITUTIONS DENOMINATED IN EURO 
In 2007 money market deposits and current 
accounts held with euro area residents as a 
direct counterpart to the capital and reserves of 
the ECB were included under this heading. The 
ECB has decided to reclassify these holdings 
as a dedicated portfolio, which is now included 
under the heading ﬁOther Þ nancial assetsﬂ. The 
comparable balance as at 31 December 2007 has 
been adjusted accordingly. As at 31 December 2008 this claim consisted of a current account with a euro area resident.5 INTRA-EUROSYSTEM CLAIMS

TARGET2 balances of the euro area NCBs 
vis-à-vis the ECB (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/
intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies). The increase in this 
position was due mainly to back-to-back 
swap transactions conducted with NCBs in 
connection with US dollar liquidity-providing 
operations (see note 9, ﬁLiabilities to non-euro 
area residents denominated in euroﬂ). This item also includes the amount due to euro area NCBs in respect of the interim distribution 
of the ECB™s income derived from banknotes 
(see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies). 6 OTHER ASSETS
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETSThese assets comprised the following items on 31 December 2008:The increase in the category ﬁAssets under 
constructionﬂ is due mainly to initial works 
related to the ECB™s new premises. Transfers 
from this category to the relevant Þ xed asset 
headings will occur once the assets are in use.OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETSThe amortisation of discounts and premiums on 

securities denominated in euro was previously 

included under the headings ﬁAccruals and 

prepaid expensesﬂ and ﬁAccruals and income 

collected in advanceﬂ, respectively. The ECB 

has decided, for presentational reasons, to 

reclassify these items under this heading. In 

addition, money market deposits and current 

accounts in euro held as a direct counterpart 

to the capital and reserves of the ECB are now 

included under this heading (see note 3, ﬁClaims

227ECBAnnual Report
2008The main components of this item are as follows:Current accounts, money market deposits, (a) securities and reverse repurchase agreements 
in euro constitute the investment of the 
ECB™s own funds (see note 12, ﬁOther 
liabilitiesﬂ). The net increase in the value of 
the ECB™s own fund assets was due mainly 
to the investment in the own funds portfolio 
of the counterpart of the amount transferred 
to the ECB™s provision against foreign 
exchange rate, interest rate and gold price 
risks in 2007, unrealised gains on securities 
(see note 14, ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ) and 
income received on the own funds portfolio.The ECB holds 3,211 shares in the Bank (b) for International Settlements (BIS), which are included at the acquisition cost of 
•41.8 million.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS REVALUATION 

DIFFERENCES 
In 2008 this item was composed mainly of 
valuation gains in outstanding interest rate swap 
transactions (see note 19, ﬁInterest rate swapsﬂ). ACCRUALS AND PREPAID EXPENSESIn 2008 this position included accrued interest 
receivable on the ECB™s claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystem for the Þ nal quarter (see ﬁBanknotes 
in circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting 
policies), amounting to •500.4 million, and 
accrued interest receivable on the TARGET2 
balances due from euro area NCBs for the Þ nal month of 2008, amounting to •648.9 million. Also included under this item is accrued interest on securities (see also note 2, ﬁClaims on 
non-euro area and euro area residents 
denominated in foreign currencyﬂ, and note 6, 
ﬁOther assetsﬂ) and other Þ nancial assets.
SUNDRY 
This item consists mainly of the accrued interim 
distribution of the ECB™s income derived from 
banknotes (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in 
the notes on accounting policies and note 5, 
ﬁIntra-Eurosystem claimsﬂ).This item also includes positive balances related to swap and forward transactions in 
foreign currency that were outstanding on 
31 December 2008 (see note 20, ﬁForeign 
exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). 
These balances arise from the conversion of 
such transactions into their euro equivalents at 
the respective currency™s average cost on the 
Balance Sheet date, compared with the euro 
values at which the transactions were initially 
recorded (see ﬁOff-balance-sheet instrumentsﬂ 
in the notes on accounting policies).A claim against the German Federal Ministry of Finance in respect of recoverable value added 
tax and other indirect taxes paid is also included 
under this heading. Such taxes are refundable 
under the terms of Article 3 of the Protocol on 
the privileges and immunities of the European 
Communities, which applies to the ECB by 
virtue of Article 40 of the Statute of the ESCB. 7 BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION

RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN EURO 
This item comprises deposits by members of 
the Euro Banking Association (EBA) which are 
used in order to provide the ECB with collateral 
in respect of the EBA™s payments settled through 
the TARGET2 system.9 LIABILITIES TO NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN EURO 
This item consists mainly of a liability to the 

Federal Reserve amounting to •219.7 billion 

in connection with the US dollar Term Auction 

Facility. Under this programme, US dollars 

were provided by the Federal Reserve to 

the ECB by means of a temporary reciprocal 

currency arrangement (swap line), with the 

aim of offering short-term US dollar funding 

to Eurosystem counterparties. The ECB 

simultaneously entered into back-to-back 

swap transactions with euro area NCBs, which 

used the resulting funds to conduct US dollar 

liquidity-providing operations with Eurosystem 

counterparties in the form of reverse and 

swap transactions. The back-to-back swap 

transactions between the ECB and the NCBs 

resulted in intra-Eurosystem balances between 

the ECB and the NCBs reported under ﬁOther 

claims within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ.A liability to the Swiss National Bank 
amounting to •18.4 billion is also included 

under this heading. Swiss francs were provided 

by the Swiss National Bank by means of a 

swap arrangement with the aim of offering 

short-term Swiss franc funding to Eurosystem 

counterparties. The ECB simultaneously 

entered into swap transactions with euro area 

NCBs, which used the resulting funds to conduct 

Swiss franc liquidity-providing operations with 
Eurosystem counterparties against euro cash 

in the form of swap transactions. The swap 

transactions between the ECB and the NCBs 

resulted in intra-Eurosystem balances reported 

under ﬁOther claims within the Eurosystem 

(net)ﬂ. In addition, this item includes a liability 

to the Swiss National Bank amounting to 

•15.4 billion. This liability arose from the 

placement with the ECB of euro funds received 

by the Swiss National Bank from operations 

with other counterparties. 
The remainder of this item reß ects balances 
held with the ECB by non-euro area NCBs arising from transactions processed via the 
TARGET2 system (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/
intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).10 LIABILITIES TO EURO AREA AND NON-EURO 
AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN 

CURRENCY 
This position consists mainly of repurchase 
agreements conducted with euro area and 
non-euro area residents in connection with the 
management of the foreign currency reserves of 
the ECB.11 INTRA-EUROSYSTEM LIABILITIES 
These represent the liabilities to the euro area 
NCBs that arose from the transfer of foreign 
reserve assets to the ECB when they joined the 
Eurosystem. They are remunerated at the latest 
available marginal rate for the Eurosystem™s 
main reÞ nancing operations, adjusted to re
ß ect a 
zero return on the gold component (see note 23, 
ﬁNet interest incomeﬂ). The transfer of foreign reserve assets by the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of 
Malta upon the adoption of the single currency 
by Cyprus and Malta led to an increase in these 
liabilities of •107,781,807.229ECBAnnual Report
2008The claims of the Central Bank of Cyprus 
and the Central Bank of Malta were set at 

•71,950,549 and •35,831,258 respectively in 

order to ensure that the ratio between these 

claims and the aggregate claim credited to the 

other NCBs that have adopted the euro will 

be equal to the ratio between the weightings 

of the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central 

Bank of Malta in the ECB™s capital key and 

the other participating NCBs™ aggregate 

weighting in this key. The difference between 

the claim and the value of the assets transferred 

(see note 1, ﬁGold and gold receivablesﬂ, and 

note 2, ﬁClaims on non-euro area and euro area 

residents denominated in foreign currencyﬂ) 

was treated as part of the contributions of the 

Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank 

of Malta, due under Article 49.2 of the Statute 

of the ESCB, to the reserves and provisions 

equivalent to reserves of the ECB existing as at 

31 December 2007 (see note 13, ﬁProvisionsﬂ, 

and note 14, ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ).12 OTHER LIABILITIES
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS REVALUATION 
DIFFERENCES 
This item is composed mainly of valuation 
changes in swap and forward transactions in 
foreign currency that were outstanding on 
31 December 2008 (see note 20, ﬁForeign 
exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). 
These valuation changes are the result of the 
conversion of such transactions into their euro 
equivalents at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the Balance Sheet date, compared with the 
euro values resulting from the conversion of the 
transactions at the average cost of the respective 
foreign currency (see ﬁGold and foreign currency 
assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting 
policies and also note 6, ﬁOther assetsﬂ).Valuation losses on interest rate swaps are also included in this item. ACCRUALS AND INCOME COLLECTED IN ADVANCE 
This item consists mainly of interest payable 
to the NCBs in respect of their claims relating 
to the foreign reserves transferred (see note 11, 
ﬁIntra-Eurosystem liabilitiesﬂ), amounting to 
•1.4 billion. It also includes accruals on 
balances due to NCBs in respect of TARGET2, 
accruals on Þ nancial instruments (see also 
note 2, ﬁClaims on non-euro area and euro area 
residents denominated in foreign currencyﬂ, and 
note 6, ﬁOther assetsﬂ) and other accruals. SUNDRY 
This item consists mainly of negative balances 
related to swap and forward transactions in 
foreign currency that were outstanding on 
31 December 2008 (see note 20, ﬁForeign

This item consists of a provision against foreign 

exchange rate, interest rate and gold price risks and 

other miscellaneous provisions. The latter include 

an appropriate provision against the contractual 

obligation of the ECB to restore its current 

premises to their original condition when they are 

vacated and the ECB moves to its new site.The Governing Council, taking into account the ECB™s large exposure to foreign exchange rate, 
interest rate and gold price risks, and the size of 
its revaluation accounts, deemed it appropriate 
to establish a provision as at 31 December 2005 
against these risks. This provision will be used 
to the extent deemed necessary by the Governing 
Council to offset future realised and unrealised 
losses, in particular valuation losses not covered 
by the revaluation accounts. The size and 
continuing requirement for this provision is 
reviewed annually, based on the ECB™s 
assessment of its exposure to the above risks. 
This assessment takes a range of factors into 
account, including in particular the level of 
holdings of risk-bearing assets, the extent of 
materialised risk exposures in the current 
Þ nancial year, projected results for the coming 
year, and a risk assessment involving 
calculations of Values at Risk (VaR) on risk-
bearing assets, which is applied consistently 
over time.13 The provision, together with any amount held in the general reserve fund, may 
not exceed the value of the ECB™s capital paid 
up by the euro area NCBs.As at 31 December 2007 the provision against 
foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 
price risks amounted to •2,668,758,313. In 
accordance with Article 49.2 of the Statute of 
the ESCB, the Central Bank of Cyprus and the 
Central Bank of Malta contributed the amounts 
of •4,795,450 and •2,388,127 respectively to 
the provision with effect from 1 January 2008. 
Taking the results of its assessment into account, 
the Governing Council decided to transfer, as 
at 31 December 2008, an additional amount of 
•1,339,019,690 14 to the provision. This increased the size of the provision to •4,014,961,580, 
which is the value of the ECB™s capital paid up 
by the euro area NCBs as at 31 December 2008, 
and reduced net proÞ t to •1,322,253,536. 
14 REVALUATION ACCOUNTS 
These accounts represent revaluation balances 
arising from unrealised gains on assets and 
liabilities. In accordance with Article 49.2 of the 
Statute of the ESCB, the Central Bank of Cyprus

amounts of •11.1 million and •5.5 million 
respectively to these balances with effect from

16 POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTS
CHANGES TO THE ECB’S CAPITAL KEYPursuant to Article 29 of the Statute of the ESCB, the shares of the NCBs in the ECB™s 
capital key are weighted according to the 
shares of the respective Member States in 
the EU™s total population and GDP in equal 
measure, as notiÞ ed to the ECB by the European 
Commission. These weights are adjusted 
every Þ ve years.
17 The second such adjustment following the establishment of the ECB was 
made on 1 January 2009. Based on Council 
Decision 2003/517/EC of 15 July 2003 on the 
statistical data to be used for the adjustment 
of the key for subscription to the capital of the 
European Central Bank,18 the NCBs™ capital key shares were adjusted on 1 January 2009 as 
follows:ENTRY OF SLOVAKIA INTO THE EURO AREAPursuant to Council Decision 2008/608/EC of 

8 July 2008, taken in accordance with 

Article 122(2) of the Treaty, Slovakia adopted 

the single currency on 1 January 2009. In 

accordance with Article 49.1 of the Statute of 

the ESCB and the legal acts adopted by the 

Governing Council on 31 December 2008,19 Národná banka Slovenska paid up an amount

2008representing the remainder of its capital 
subscription to the ECB. In accordance with 

Article 30.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, 

Národná banka Slovenska transferred foreign 

reserve assets with a total value equivalent to 

•443,086,156 to the ECB with effect from 

1 January 2009. The total amount transferred 

was determined by multiplying the euro value, 

at the exchange rates prevailing on 

31 December 2008, of the foreign reserve 

assets already transferred to the ECB by the 

ratio between the number of shares subscribed 

by Národná banka Slovenska and the number 

of shares already paid up by the other NCBs 

without a derogation. These foreign reserve 

assets comprised amounts of US dollars in the 

form of securities and cash, and gold, in 

proportions of 85 to 15 respectively. 
Národná banka Slovenska was credited with claims in respect of the paid-up capital and 
foreign reserve assets equivalent to the amounts 
transferred. The latter is to be treated in an 
identical manner to the existing claims of the 
other participating NCBs (see note 11, ﬁIntra-
Eurosystem liabilitiesﬂ).EFFECT ON THE ECB’S CAPITAL 
The adjustment of the NCBs™ capital key shares 
in conjunction with Slovakia joining the euro 
area resulted in an increase of •5,100,251 in the 
ECB™s paid-up capital.EFFECT ON THE NCBS’ CLAIMS EQUIVALENT TO 

THE FOREIGN RESERVE ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO 

THE ECBThe net effect of the change in NCBs™ 
weightings in the ECB™s capital key and of the 
transfer by Národná banka Slovenska of foreign 
reserve assets on the NCBs™ claims equivalent 
to the foreign reserve assets transferred to the 
ECB was an increase of •54,841,411. OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS17 AUTOMATIC SECURITY LENDING PROGRAMME 
As part of the management of the ECB™s own 
funds, the ECB has concluded an automatic 

security lending programme agreement, 

whereby an appointed agent enters into security 

lending transactions on behalf of the ECB 

with a number of counterparties, designated 

by the ECB as eligible counterparties. Under 

this agreement, reverse transactions with 

a value of •1.2 billion (2007: •3.0 billion) 

were outstanding as at 31 December 2008 

(see ﬁReverse transactionsﬂ in the notes on 

accounting policies). 
18 INTEREST RATE FUTURES 
In 2008 interest rate futures were used as part of 

the management of the ECB™s foreign reserves 

and own funds. As at 31 December 2008 the 

following transactions were outstanding: 
Foreign currency interest rate futuresContract value •Purchases2,041,082,857Sales1,209,470,518Euro interest rate futuresContract value •Purchases50,000,000Sales33,000,00019 INTEREST RATE SWAPS
Interest rate swap transactions with a contract value of •459.3 million were outstanding as at 
31 December 2008. These transactions were 
conducted in the context of the management of 
the ECB™s foreign reserves.235ECBAnnual Report
200820 FOREIGN EXCHANGE SWAP AND FORWARD 
TRANSACTIONS 
MANAGEMENT OF THE FOREIGN RESERVESIn the context of the management of the ECB™s foreign reserves, foreign exchange swap and 
forward transaction claims of •358.1 million 
and liabilities of •404.3 million remained 
outstanding as at 31 December 2008. LIQUIDITY-PROVIDING OPERATIONSForward liabilities to Danmarks Nationalbank 
amounting to •3.9 billion remained outstanding 
as at 31 December 2008. These liabilities arose 
in connection with the reciprocal currency 
arrangement (swap line) established with 
the ECB. Under this arrangement, the ECB 
provides euro funds to Danmarks Nationalbank 
against Danish kroner for the duration of the 
transactions. The resulting funds are used in 
support of measures to improve liquidity in euro 
short-term markets. In addition, forward claims on NCBs and liabilities to the Federal Reserve, which 
arose in connection with the provision of US 
dollar liquidity to Eurosystem counterparties 
(see note 9, ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area residents 
denominated in euroﬂ), were outstanding on 
31 December 2008. Forward claims on NCBs and liabilities to the Swiss National Bank, which arose in connection 
with the provision of Swiss franc liquidity 
to Eurosystem counterparties (see note 9, 
ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area residents 
denominated in euroﬂ), were also outstanding 
on 31 December 2008.21 ADMINISTRATION OF BORROWING AND 
LENDING OPERATIONS 
In accordance with Article 123(2) of the 
Treaty and Article 9 of Council Regulation 
(EC) No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002, the 
ECB is responsible for the administration of the borrowing and lending operations of the 
European Community under the medium-term 
Þ nancial assistance mechanism. Under this 
scheme, a loan from the European Community 
to Hungary for an amount of •2.0 billion was 
outstanding as at 31 December 2008. 22 PENDING LAWSUITS 
An action for damages was brought against the 
ECB before the Court of First Instance of the 
European Communities (CFI) by Document 
Security Systems Inc. (DSSI), alleging that the 
ECB had infringed a DSSI patent 20 in the production of euro banknotes. The CFI 
dismissed DSSI™s action for damages against 
the ECB. 21 The ECB is currently pursuing actions to revoke the patent in a number of 
national jurisdictions. Furthermore, the ECB 
Þ rmly maintains that it has in no way infringed 
the patent, and will consequently also enter a 
defence against any infringement action that 
may be brought by DSSI before any competent 
national court.As a result of the CFI™s dismissal of DSSI™s action for damages against the ECB, as well as 
the ECB™s successful actions to date in certain 
national jurisdictions to revoke national portions 
of DSSI™s patent, the ECB remains conÞ dent that the possibility of payments to DSSI is 
remote. The ECB is actively monitoring all 
developments in the continuing litigation. DSSI™s European Patent No 0455 750 B1.20 Order of the Court of First Instance of 5 September 2007, Case 21 T-295/05. Available at www.curia.eu.236ECBAnnual Report
200823 NET INTEREST INCOME
INTEREST INCOME ON FOREIGN RESERVE ASSETSThis item includes interest income, net of interest expense, in respect of assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currency, as follows: INTEREST INCOME ARISING FROM THE 

ALLOCATION OF EURO BANKNOTES WITHIN THE 

EUROSYSTEM 
This item consists of the interest income relating 
to the ECB™s share of the total euro banknote 
issue. Interest on the claims of the ECB in respect of its share of banknotes is earned at the latest 
available marginal rate for the Eurosystem™s 
main reÞ nancing operations. The increase in 
income in 2008 mainly reß ected the general 
increase in euro banknotes in circulation. This income is distributed to the NCBs as described in ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the 
notes on accounting policies. Based on the 
ECB™s estimated Þ nancial result for 2008, and 
the decision to fund the transfer to the provision 
against foreign exchange rate, interest rate 
and gold price risks out of the ECB™s income 
on euro banknotes in circulation (see note 13, 
ﬁProvisionsﬂ), the Governing Council decided 
to distribute the remaining •1.2 billion 
of this income to the euro area NCBs, in 
accordance with their respective shares in the 
ECB™s capital.REMUNERATION OF NCBS’ CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF 

FOREIGN RESERVES TRANSFERRED 
Remuneration paid to euro area NCBs on their 
claims on the ECB in respect of the foreign 
reserve assets transferred under Article 30.1 
of the Statute of the ESCB is disclosed under 
this item.OTHER INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER INTEREST 

EXPENSEThese items include interest income of 
•8.0 billion (2007: •3.9 billion) and expenses 
of •7.6 billion (2007: •3.8 billion) on balances 
arising from TARGET2 (see ﬁIntra-ESCB 
balances/intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in 
the notes on accounting policies). Interest 
income and expenses in respect of other assets 
and liabilities denominated in euro are also 
shown here.24 REALISED GAINS/(LOSSES) ARISING FROM

237ECBAnnual Report
2008The overall reduction in net realised exchange rate and gold price gains in 2008 was due 
mainly to the lower volume of gold sold in that 
year (see note 1, ﬁGold and gold receivablesﬂ). 25 WRITE-DOWNS ON FINANCIAL ASSETS AND 
POSITIONS 
In 2008 this expense was due mainly to the 
write-down of the acquisition cost of individual 
securities shown on the Balance Sheet to their 
market value as at 30 December 2008. 26 NET EXPENSE FROM FEES AND COMMISSIONS 
Income under this heading includes 
penalties imposed on credit institutions for non-compliance with the minimum reserve 
requirements. Expenses relate to fees payable 
on current accounts and in connection with 
the execution of foreign currency interest rate 
futures (see note 18, ﬁInterest rate futuresﬂ).27 INCOME FROM EQUITY SHARES AND 
PARTICIPATING INTERESTS 
Dividends received on shares in the BIS 
(see note 6, ﬁOther assetsﬂ) are shown under this 
heading. 28 OTHER INCOME 
Other miscellaneous income during the year 
arose principally from the contributions of other 
central banks to the cost of a service contract 
held centrally by the ECB with an external 
provider of an IT network, and the transfers of 
unused administrative provisions to the ProÞ t and Loss Account.29 STAFF COSTS 
Salaries, allowances, staff insurance and other 

miscellaneous costs of •149.9 million (2007: 

•141.7 million) are included under this heading. 

Staff costs of •1.1 million (2007: •1.1 million) 

incurred in connection with the construction of the 

new ECB premises have been capitalised and are 

excluded from this item. Salaries and allowances, 

including the emoluments of holders of senior 

management positions, are modelled in essence 

on, and are comparable with, the remuneration 

scheme of the European Communities.Members of the Executive Board receive a basic 
salary and additional allowances for residence 

and representation. In the case of the President, 

an ofÞ cial residence owned by the ECB is 
provided in lieu of a residence allowance. Subject 

to the Conditions of Employment for Staff of 

the European Central Bank, members of the 

Executive Board are entitled to household, child 

and education allowances, depending on their

subject to a tax for the beneÞ t of the European 
Communities as well as to deductions in respect of 

contributions to the pension, medical and accident 

insurance schemes. Allowances are non-taxable 

and non-pensionable. 
Basic salaries paid to members of the Executive Board in 2008 and 2007 were as follows:The total allowances paid to the members of the Executive Board and their beneÞ ts from the 
ECB™s contributions to the medical and accident 
insurance schemes amounted to •600,523 
(2007: •579,842), resulting in total emoluments 
of •2,259,007 (2007: •2,207,366).Transitional payments are made to former members of the Executive Board for a period 
after the end of their terms of ofÞ ce. In 2008 
these payments and the ECB™s contributions to 
the medical and accident insurance schemes of 
former members amounted to •30,748 (2007: 
•52,020). Pension payments, including related 
allowances, to former members of the Executive 
Board or their dependents and contributions to 
the medical and accident insurance schemes 
amounted to •306,798 (2007: •249,902).Also included under this item is an amount of •24.3 million (2007: •27.2 million) recognised 
in connection with the ECB™s retirement plan 
and other post-employment beneÞ ts (see note 12, 
ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ). At the end of 2008 the actual full-time equivalent number of staff holding contracts with the ECB 
was 1,536,22 including 144 with managerial positions. The change in the number of staff 
during 2008 was as follows:2330 ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
These cover all other current expenses relating 
to the renting and maintenance of premises, 
goods and equipment of a non-capital nature, 
professional fees and other services and supplies, 
together with staff-related expenses including 
recruitment, relocation, installation, training and 
resettlement expenses.31 BANKNOTE PRODUCTION SERVICES 
This expense relates to costs arising from the 
cross-border transportation of euro banknotes 
between NCBs to meet unexpected ß uctuations in demand for banknotes. These costs are borne 
centrally by the ECB. Staff on unpaid leave of absence are excluded. This number 22 includes staff with permanent, Þ xed or short-term contracts and 
the participants in the ECB™s Graduate Programme. Staff on maternity or long-term sick leave are also included.
In 2007, staff numbers in this table included staff on unpaid/23 parental leave, while staff with short-term contracts, as well 
as staff from other central banks of the ESCB with temporary 
assignments with the ECB and the participants in the ECB™s 
Graduate Programme, were excluded. The change in the 
presentation of the Þ gures for 2008 was considered to make them 
more useful for the users of the Þ nancial statements. The 2007 
Þ gures have been adjusted accordingly.

2008This note is not part of the Þ nancial statements 
of the ECB for the year 2008.INCOME RELATED TO THE ECB’S SHARE OF TOTAL 
BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATIONIn 2007, following a decision by the Governing 
Council, the full income of •2,004 million 
earned on the ECB™s share of total banknotes in 
circulation was retained to ensure that the ECB™s 
total proÞ t distribution for the year did not exceed 
its net proÞ t for the year. In respect of 2008, an 
amount of •1,206 million, comprising part of 
the income earned on the ECB™s share of total 
euro banknotes in circulation, was distributed to 
the NCBs on 5 January 2009, in proportion to 
their paid-up shares in the subscribed capital of 
the ECB. PROFIT DISTRIBUTION/COVERAGE OF LOSSESPursuant to Article 33 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
the net proÞ t of the ECB shall be transferred in 
the following order:an amount to be determined by the Governing (a) Council, which may not exceed 20% of the 
net proÞ t, shall be transferred to the general 
reserve fund subject to a limit equal to 100% 
of the capital; and the remaining net proÞ t shall be distributed

200814 JANUARY 2008MAIN REFINANCING OPERATIONSThe ECB continues to closely monitor liquidity conditions and aims at keeping very short-term 
rates close to the minimum bid rate on the main 
reÞ nancing operations. The ECB will, for as 
long as needed, allocate more liquidity than 
the benchmark amount in main reÞ nancing operations to accommodate the demand of 
counterparties to fulÞ l reserve requirements 
early in the maintenance period. The ECB aims 
at balanced liquidity conditions at the end of the 
maintenance period. 7 FEBRUARY 2008SUPPLEMENTARY LONGER-TERM REFINANCING 
OPERATIONSThe Governing Council today decided to renew 
the two supplementary longer-term reÞ nancing operations (LTROs) that were allotted on

12 December 2007 (•60 billion) and that 
will mature on 21 February 2008 and on 
13 March 2008 respectively. The renewal of 
these two supplementary LTROs is aimed at 
further consolidating the progress achieved so far 
in the normalisation of the euro money market. 
The renewal will be carried out as follows 
and will not affect the regular LTROs: The 
two supplementary LTROs will be carried out 
through variable rate tenders, each with a preset 
amount of •60 billion. The Þ rst operation will 
be settled on 21 February 2008 and will mature 
on 22 May 2008. The second operation will be 
settled on 13 March 2008 and will mature on 
12 June 2008. The two supplementary LTROs 
will be carried out through a standard tender 
procedure, with announcement and allotment 
taking place two days and one day respectively 
before settlement. 28 MARCH 2008SUPPLEMENTARY LONGER-TERM REFINANCING 
OPERATIONSThe Governing Council decided at its meeting 

on 27 March 2008 to conduct supplementary 

longer-term reÞ nancing operations (LTROs)

and six-month LTROs are aimed at supporting 

the normalisation of the functioning of the euro 

money market. The supplementary three-month 

and six-month operations will be carried out 

as follows: They will all be carried out through 

a variable rate standard tender procedure with 

preset amounts. As a rule, they will mature 

on the second Thursday of the given month. 

One supplementary six-month LTRO with a 

preset amount of •25 billion will be allotted 

on Wednesday, 2 April, settled on Thursday, 

3 April, and will mature on Thursday,

OPERATIONSThe Governing Council today decided to renew 

the outstanding six-month supplementary longer-
term reÞ nancing operation (LTRO) of •25 billion 
that was allotted on 2 April and that will mature 

on 9 October 2008. It also decided to renew 

the two three-month supplementary LTROs 

(•50 billion) that will mature on 13 November 

and 11 December 2008 respectively. The renewal 

of these supplementary LTROs is aimed at

29 SEPTEMBER 2008SPECIAL-TERM REFINANCING OPERATIONThe Governing Council of the ECB decided to conduct a special-term reÞ nancing operation. 
The aim of this operation is to improve the 
overall liquidity position of the euro area 
banking system. The operation will be carried 
out as follows: It will be conducted today 
through a standard tender procedure, using a 
variable rate tender with no preset amount. It 
will be settled on Tuesday, 30 September 2008 
and will mature on Friday, 7 November 2008. 
The ECB will continue to steer liquidity towards 
balanced conditions in a way which is consistent 
with the objective to keep very short-term rates 
close to the minimum bid rate. The special-term 
reÞ nancing operation will be renewed until at 
least beyond the end of the year. 3 OCTOBER 2008 2GENERAL ANNOUNCEMENT ON LIQUIDITY POLICYThe Governing Council of the ECB has decided 
that, from 6 October 2008 until further notice, 
all institutions that are eligible to participate 
in Eurosystem open market operations based 
on standard tenders and that fulÞ l additional 
operational or other selection criteria speciÞ ed General announcements on liquidity policy which were not 2 directly related to the provision of liquidity are not included in this list. They are available on the ECB™s website.263ECBAnnual Report
2008by the respective NCBs will also be eligible to participate in quick tenders, i.e. the tender 
procedure normally used for Þ ne-tuning operations. The NCBs may announce further 
details applicable for institutions established in 
the respective Member States, where necessary. 7 OCTOBER 2008SUPPLEMENTARY LONGER-TERM REFINANCING 
OPERATIONToday the Governing Council of the ECB 
decided to increase from •25 billion to 
•50 billion the allotment amount in the six-
month supplementary longer-term reÞ nancing operation that was pre-announced in the press 
release of 4 September 2008 and will be allotted 
on 8 October 2008. Accordingly, a maximum 
bid amount of •5 billion will be applied in 
this operation. 8 OCTOBER 2008GENERAL ANNOUNCEMENT ON LIQUIDITY POLICYThe Governing Council of the ECB today decided, by means of a teleconference, on 
the following two measures: As from the 
operation settled on 15 October, the weekly 
main reÞ nancing operations will be carried 
out through a Þ xed rate tender procedure with 
full allotment at the interest rate on the main 
reÞ nancing operation, i.e. currently 3.75%. As 
of 9 October, the ECB will reduce the corridor 
of standing facility rates from 200 basis points 
to 100 basis points around the interest rate on 
the main reÞ nancing operation. Therefore, as of 9 October, the rate of the marginal lending 
facility will be reduced from 100 to 50 basis 
points above the interest rate on the main 
reÞ nancing operation, i.e. currently to 4.25%, 
and the rate of the deposit facility will be 
increased from 100 to 50 basis points below the 
interest rate on the main reÞ nancing operation, 
i.e. currently to 3.25%. The two measures will 
remain in place for as long as needed, and at 
least until the end of the Þ rst maintenance period 
of 2009, on 20 January. The ECB will continue to steer liquidity towards balanced conditions in 
a way which is consistent with the objective to 
keep short-term rates close to the interest rate on 
the main reÞ nancing operation. 
9 OCTOBER 2008FINE-TUNING OPERATIONThe operation implements the decision of yesterday (see press release of 8 October) to 
satisfy all demand of counterparties, i.e. full 
allotment, for reÞ nancing at the main re
Þ nancing rate of 3.75% against eligible collateral, for 
as long as needed, and at least until the end 
of the Þ rst maintenance period of 2009, on 
20 January. 15 OCTOBER 2008SUPPLEMENTARY LONGER-TERM REFINANCING 
OPERATIONS/SPECIAL-TERM REFINANCING 

OPERATION 3The Governing Council of the ECB today 
decided, by means of a teleconference, that as 
from the operation settling on 30 October 2008 
and until the end of the Þ rst quarter of 2009, 
the provision of longer-term reÞ nancing by 
the Eurosystem will be enhanced as follows, 
consistent with the temporary expansion of the 
collateral pool:All longer-term reÞ nancing operations will, 
until March 2009, be carried out through a Þ xed rate tender procedure with full allotment. 
The two three-month supplementary longer-
term reÞ nancing operations (LTROs) maturing 
in February and in March 2009 will be rolled 
over and an additional three-month operation 
will be conducted in January 2009. The 
outstanding six-month supplementary LTRO 
maturing in January 2009 will be rolled over, 
and four additional six-month supplementary 
LTROs will be carried out in November 2008, Announcements on the Þ xed rate applied in the LTROs, 
3 supplementary LTROs and special-term reÞ nancing operations 
between 30 October and 31 December 2008 are not included in this list. They are available on the ECB™s website.264ECBAnnual Report
2008December 2008, February 2009 and March 2009 in parallel with the respective three-month 
supplementary LTROs. As a result, two three-
month LTROs/supplementary LTROs and one 
six-month LTRO will be carried out each month 
up to and including March 2009. Moreover, the 
special-term reÞ nancing operation allotted on 
29 September 2008 will be rolled over when 
it matures on 7 November 2008 and will have 
a maturity equal to the length of the reserve 
maintenance period.The ECB will continue to steer liquidity towards balanced conditions in a way which is consistent 
with the objective to keep short-term rates close 
to the interest rate on the main reÞ nancing operation. For that purpose it will also accept 
Þ xed-term deposits with a one-week maturity.

http://www.nbp.pl.18 DECEMBER 2008GENERAL ANNOUNCEMENT ON LIQUIDITY POLICYFurther to the press release on changes in 
tender procedures and in the standing facilities 

corridor of 8 October 2008, the Governing 

Council of the ECB today decided the 

following: The main reÞ nancing operations 
will continue to be carried out through a Þ xed 
rate tender procedure with full allotment 

beyond the maintenance period ending on 

20 January 2009. This measure will be in place 

for as long as needed, and at least until the 

last allotment of the third maintenance period 

in 2009 on 31 March. As of 21 January 2009, 

the corridor of standing facility rates, which on 

9 October 2008 was reduced to 100 basis 

points around the prevailing interest rate on the 

main reÞ nancing operation, will be restored to 
200 basis points. Therefore, as of 21 January, 

the rate of the marginal lending facility will 

be increased from 50 to 100 basis points 

above the interest rate on the main reÞ nancing 
operation, and the rate of the deposit facility 

will be reduced from 50 to 100 basis points

2008This glossary contains selected terms that are used in the Annual Report. A more comprehensive and detailed glossary can be found on the ECB™s website.Balance of payments (b.o.p.): a statistical statement that summarises, for a speciÞ c period of time, 
the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world. The transactions considered are those involving goods, services and income; those involving Þ nancial claims on, and liabilities to, the rest of the world; and those (such as debt forgiveness) that are classiÞ ed as transfers.
Benchmark portfolio: in relation to investments, a reference portfolio or index constructed on the 
basis of the objectives for the liquidity and risk of, as well as the return on, the investments. The 
benchmark portfolio serves as a basis for comparison of the performance of the actual portfolio.Bond market: the market in which longer-term debt securities are issued and traded.Candidate countries: countries for which the EU has accepted an application for EU membership. Accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey began on 3 October 2005, while those with the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have not yet started.Central counterparty: an entity that interposes itself between the counterparties to the contracts traded in one or more Þ nancial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.
Central government: the government as deÞ ned in the 
European System of Accounts 1995 but excluding regional and local governments (see also general government).Central securities depository (CSD): an entity that i) enables securities transactions to be processed and settled by book entry, and ii) plays an active role in ensuring the integrity of securities issues. Securities can be held in physical (but immobilised) or dematerialised form (i.e. so that they exist 
only as electronic records).Collateral: assets pledged or otherwise transferred (e.g. by credit institutions to central banks) as a guarantee for the repayment of loans, as well as assets sold (e.g. by credit institutions to central banks) under repurchase agreements.Consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector: a balance sheet obtained by netting out inter-MFI positions (e.g. inter-MFI loans and deposits) in the aggregated MFI balance sheet. It provides 
statistical information on the MFI sector™s assets and liabilities vis-à-vis residents of the euro area not belonging to this sector (i.e. the general government and other euro area residents) and vis-à-vis non-euro area residents. It is the main statistical source for the calculation of monetary 
aggregates, and it provides the basis for the regular analysis of the counterparts of M3.Corporate governance: rules, procedures and processes according to which an organisation is 
directed and controlled. The corporate governance structure speciÞ es the distribution of rights and 
responsibilities among the different participants in the organisation Œ such as the board, managers, 
shareholders and other stakeholders Œ and lays down the rules and procedures for decision-making.Corporate proÞ tability: a measure of the earnings performance of corporations, mainly in relation to their sales, assets or equity. There are a number of different corporate proÞ tability ratios based on company Þ nancial statements, such as the ratio of operating income (sales minus 
GLOSSARY276ECBAnnual Report
2008operating expenses) to sales, the ratio of net income (operating and non-operating income, after tax, depreciation and extraordinary items) to sales, the return on assets (relating net income to total 
assets) and the return on equity (relating net income to shareholders™ funds). At the macroeconomic 
level, the gross operating surplus, based on national accounts, for instance in relation to GDP or value added, is often used as a measure of proÞ tability.Correspondent central banking model (CCBM): a mechanism established by the Eurosystem with the aim of enabling counterparties to use eligible assets on a cross-border basis. In the CCBM, NCBs act as custodians for one another. Each NCB has a securities account in its securities 
administration for each of the other NCBs (and for the European Central Bank).Cost of the external Þ nancing of non-
Þ nancial corporations (real):
 the cost incurred by non-Þ nancial corporations when taking up new external funds. For 
euro area non-Þ nancial corporations, 
it is calculated as a weighted average of the cost of bank lending, the cost of debt securities and the cost of equity, based on the amounts outstanding (corrected for valuation effects) and deß ated by 
inß ation expectations.
Counterparty: the opposite party in a Þ nancial transaction (e.g. any party transacting with a central 
bank).Credit derivative: a Þ nancial instrument which separates the 
credit risk from an underlying Þ nancial transaction, enabling the credit risk to be priced and transferred separately.
Credit institution: i) an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credit for its own account; or ii) an undertaking or any other legal person, other than those under i), which issues means of payment in the form of electronic money.Credit risk: the risk that a counterparty will not settle an obligation for full value, either when due or at any time thereafter. Credit risk includes replacement cost risk and principal risk. It also includes the risk of the failure of the settlement bank.Debt security: a promise on the part of the issuer (i.e. the borrower) to make one or more payment(s) to the holder (the lender) at a speciÞ ed future date or dates. Such securities usually carry 
a speciÞ c rate of interest (the coupon) and/or are sold at a discount to the amount that will be repaid at maturity. Debt securities issued with an original maturity of more than one year are classiÞ ed as 
long-term.Deposit facility: a standing facility of the Eurosystem which counterparties may use to make overnight deposits, remunerated at a pre-speciÞ ed interest rate, at an NCB (see also 
key ECB interest rates).Direct investment: cross-border investment for the purpose of obtaining a lasting interest in an 
enterprise resident in another economy (assumed, in practice, for ownership of at least 10% of the 
ordinary shares or voting power). Included are equity capital, reinvested earnings and other capital 
associated with inter-company operations.ECOFIN Council: the EU Council meeting in the composition of the ministers of economy and Þ nance.277ECBAnnual Report
2008Economic analysis: one pillar of the European Central Bank™s framework for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability, which forms the basis for the Governing Council™s monetary policy decisions. The economic analysis focuses mainly on the assessment of current economic and Þ nancial developments and the implied short to medium-term risks to price 
stability from the perspective of the interplay between supply and demand in goods, services and 
factor markets at those horizons. Due attention is paid to the need to identify the nature of shocks 
affecting the economy, their effects on cost and pricing behaviour, and the short to medium-term 
prospects for their propagation in the economy (see also monetary analysis).Economic and Financial Committee (EFC): a consultative Community body which contributes to the preparation of the work of the ECOFIN Council and the European Commission. Its tasks include reviewing the economic and Þ nancial situation of the Member States and of the Community, 
and budgetary surveillance.Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): the process that led to the single currency, the euro, and the single monetary policy in the euro area, as well as to the coordination of the economic policies of the EU Member States. This process, as laid down in the Treaty, took place in three stages. Stage Three, the Þ nal stage, started on 1 January 1999 with the transfer of monetary competence to 
the European Central Bank and the introduction of the euro. The cash changeover on 1 January 2002 completed the process of setting up EMU.
Effective exchange rate (EER) of the euro (nominal/real): a weighted average of bilateral euro exchange rates against the currencies of the euro area™s main trading partners. The European Central Bank publishes nominal EER indices for the euro against two groups of trading partners: the EER-21 (comprising the 11 non-euro area EU Member States and 10 main trading partners 
outside the EU) and the EER-41 (composed of the EER-21 and 20 additional countries). The 
weights used reß ect the share of each partner country in euro area trade and account for competition 
in third markets. Real EERs are nominal EERs deß ated by a weighted average of foreign, relative to domestic, prices or costs. They are thus measures of price and cost competitiveness.EONIA (euro overnight index average): a measure of the effective interest rate prevailing in the euro interbank overnight market. It is calculated as a weighted average of the interest rates on 
unsecured overnight lending transactions denominated in euro, as reported by a panel of contributing 
banks.Equities: securities representing ownership of a stake in a corporation. They comprise shares traded on stock exchanges (quoted shares), unquoted shares and other forms of equity. Equities usually 
produce income in the form of dividends.Equity market: the market in which equities are issued and traded.ERM II (exchange rate mechanism II): the exchange rate mechanism which provides the framework for exchange rate policy cooperation between the euro area countries and the non-euro area EU Member States. ERM II is a multilateral arrangement with Þ xed, but adjustable, 
central rates and a standard ß uctuation band of ±15%. Decisions concerning central rates and, possibly, narrower ß uctuation bands are taken by mutual agreement between the EU Member State 
concerned, the euro area countries, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the other EU Member States participating in the mechanism. All participants in ERM II, including the ECB, have the right 
to initiate a conÞ dential procedure aimed at changing the central rates (realignment).
278ECBAnnual Report
2008EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate): the rate at which a prime bank is willing to lend funds in euro to another prime bank, as reported by a panel of contributing banks, computed daily for 
interbank deposits with different maturities of up to 12 months.Euro area: the area encompassing those Member States which have adopted the euro as the single currency in accordance with the Treaty and in which a single monetary policy is conducted under the responsibility of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. The euro area currently comprises Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, 
Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.European Central Bank (ECB): the ECB lies at the centre of the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and has its own legal personality in accordance with the Treaty (Article 107(2)). It ensures that the tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem and the ESCB are implemented either through its own activities or through those of the NCBs, pursuant to the Statute 
of the ESCB. The ECB is governed by the Governing Council and the Executive Board, and, as a third decision-making body, by the General Council.European Monetary Institute (EMI): a temporary institution established at the start of Stage 
Two of Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January 1994. It went into liquidation following the 
establishment of the European Central Bank on 1 June 1998.European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95): a comprehensive and integrated system of macroeconomic accounts based on a set of internationally agreed statistical concepts, deÞ nitions, classiÞ cations and accounting rules aimed at achieving a harmonised quantitative description of the 
economies of the EU Member States. The ESA 95 is the Community™s version of the world System 
of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 93).European System of Central Banks (ESCB): composed of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the NCBs of all 27 EU Member States, i.e. it includes, in addition to the members of the Eurosystem, the NCBs of those Member States that have not yet adopted the euro. The ESCB is 
governed by the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the ECB, and, as a third decision-making body of the ECB, by the General Council.Eurosystem: the central banking system of the euro area. It comprises the European Central Bank and the NCBs of the Member States that have adopted the euro.Excessive deÞ cit procedure:

Þ cit and 
regulates steps to be taken following the observation that the requirements for the budgetary balance or government debt have not been fulÞ lled. Article 104 is supplemented by Council Regulation 
(EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive

is one element of the Stability and Growth Pact.Executive Board: one of the decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank (ECB). It comprises the President and the Vice-President of the ECB and four other members appointed by 
common accord by the Heads of State or Government of the Member States that have adopted the 
euro.279ECBAnnual Report
2008Financial stability: condition in which the Þ nancial system Œ comprising Þ nancial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures Œ is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of Þ nancial imbalances, thereby mitigating the likelihood of disruptions in the 
Þ nancial intermediation process which are severe enough to signiÞ cantly impair the allocation of savings to pro
Þ table investment opportunities.Financing gap of non-Þ nancial corporations:
 the Þ nancing gap can be de
Þ ned as the balance between the corporate savings (through retained earnings and depreciation allowances) and the non-Þ nancial investment of non-
Þ nancial corporations. The 
Þ nancing gap can also be de
Þ ned on 
the basis of the Þ nancial accounts, as the balance between the net acquisition of 
Þ nancial assets and 
the net incurrence of liabilities by non-Þ nancial corporations. There are statistical discrepancies 
between the two measures owing to differences in source statistics. Fine-tuning operation: an open market operation executed by the Eurosystem in order to deal with unexpected liquidity ß uctuations in the market. The frequency and maturity of 
Þ ne-tuning operations are not standardised.
Foreign exchange swap: simultaneous spot and forward transactions exchanging one currency against another.
General Council: one of the decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank (ECB). It comprises the President and the Vice-President of the ECB and the governors of all the NCBs of the European System of Central Banks.General government: a sector deÞ ned in the European System of Accounts 1995 as comprising resident entities that are engaged primarily in the production of non-market goods and services intended for individual and collective consumption and/or in the redistribution of national income 
and wealth. Included are central, regional and local government authorities, as well as social 
security funds. Excluded are government-owned entities that conduct commercial operations, such 
as public enterprises.Governing Council: the supreme decision-making body of the European Central Bank (ECB). It comprises all the members of the Executive Board of the ECB and the governors of the NCBs of the Member States that have adopted the euro.
Gross operating surplus: the surplus (or deÞ cit) on the value of output of production activities 
after the costs of intermediate consumption, compensation of employees and taxes less subsidies on production have been deducted, but before payments and receipts of income related to the 
borrowing/renting or owning of Þ nancial and non-produced assets have been taken into account.Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP): a measure of the development of consumer 
prices that is compiled by Eurostat and harmonised for all EU Member States.Implied volatility: the expected volatility (i.e. standard deviation) in the rates of change of the price of an asset (e.g. a share or a bond). It can be derived from the asset™s price, maturity date and exercise price of its options, as well as from a riskless rate of return, using an option pricing model such as the Black-Scholes model.280ECBAnnual Report

ﬁthe most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the worldﬂ, launched in 2000 by 
the Lisbon European Council.Longer-term reÞ nancing operation:
 a regular open market operation executed by the Eurosystem in the form of reverse transactions. Such operations are carried out through a monthly standard tender and normally have a maturity of three months.
M1: a narrow monetary aggregate that comprises currency in circulation plus overnight deposits held with MFIs and central government (e.g. at the post ofÞ ce or treasury).
M2: an intermediate monetary aggregate that comprises M1 plus deposits redeemable at a period of notice of up to and including three months (i.e. short-term savings deposits) and deposits with an

 a regular open market operation executed by the Eurosystem in the form of reverse transactions. Such operations are carried out through a weekly standard tender 
and normally have a maturity of one week.Maintenance period: the period over which credit institutions™ compliance with reserve requirements is calculated. The maintenance period begins on the settlement day of the Þ rst main reÞ nancing operation
 following the meeting of the Governing Council at which the monthly assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled. The European Central Bank publishes a calendar of the reserve maintenance periods at least three months before the start of the year.
Marginal lending facility: a standing facility of the Eurosystem which counterparties may use to receive overnight credit from an NCB at a pre-speciÞ ed interest rate against eligible assets

2008MFIs (monetary Þ nancial institutions):
 Þ nancial institutions which together form the money-
issuing sector of the euro area. These include the Eurosystem, resident credit institutions (as deÞ ned in Community law) and all other resident 
Þ nancial institutions whose business is to receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from entities other than MFIs and, for their own account (at least in economic terms), to grant credit and/or invest in securities. The latter group 
consists predominantly of money market funds.MFI credit to euro area residents: MFI loans granted to non-MFI euro area residents (including general government and the private sector) and MFI holdings of securities (shares, other equity 
and debt securities) issued by non-MFI euro area residents.MFI interest rates: the interest rates that are applied by resident credit institutions and other MFIs, excluding central banks and money market funds, to euro-denominated deposits and loans vis-à-vis households and non-Þ nancial corporations resident in the 
euro area.MFI longer-term Þ nancial liabilities:
 deposits with an agreed maturity of over two years, deposits redeemable at a period of notice of over three months, debt securities issued by euro area MFIs with an original maturity of more than two years, and the capital and reserves of the euro area MFI sector.MFI net external assets: the external assets of the euro area MFI sector (such as gold, foreign currency banknotes and coins, securities issued by non-euro area residents and loans granted to non-euro area residents) minus the external liabilities of the euro area MFI sector (such as non-euro 
area residents™ deposits and repurchase agreements, as well as their holdings of money market fund shares/units and debt securities issued by MFIs with a maturity of up to and including two 
years).Minimum bid rate: the lower limit to the interest rates at which counterparties may submit bids in the variable rate tenders. 
Monetary analysis: one pillar of the European Central Bank™s framework for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability, which forms the basis for the Governing Council™s monetary policy decisions. The monetary analysis helps to assess medium to long-term trends in inß ation, in view of the close relationship between money and prices over extended horizons. The monetary analysis takes into account developments in a wide range of monetary 
indicators including M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and various measures of excess liquidity (see also economic analysis).Monetary income: income accruing to the NCBs in the performance of the Eurosystem™s monetary policy function, derived from assets earmarked in accordance with guidelines established 
by the Governing Council and held against banknotes in circulation and deposit liabilities to credit institutions.Money market: the market in which short-term funds are raised, invested and traded using instruments which generally have an original maturity of up to and including one year.Open market operation: an operation executed on the initiative of the central bank in the Þ nancial market. With regard to their aims, regularity and procedures, Eurosystem open market operations can be divided into four categories: main reÞ nancing operations
; longer-term reÞ nancing 282ECBAnnual Report
2008operations; Þ ne-tuning operations
; and structural operations. As for the instruments used, reverse transactions are the main open market instrument of the Eurosystem and can be employed in all four categories of operations. In addition, the issuance of debt certiÞ cates and outright transactions 
are available for structural operations, while outright transactions, foreign exchange swaps and the collection of Þ xed-term deposits are available for the conduct of 
Þ ne-tuning operations.Option: a Þ nancial instrument that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell 
speciÞ c assets (e.g. a bond or a stock) at a predetermined price (the strike or exercise price) at or up 
to a certain future date (the exercise or maturity date).Other Þ nancial intermediary (OFI):
 a corporation or quasi-corporation (other than an insurance corporation or pension fund) that is engaged mainly in Þ nancial intermediation by incurring 
liabilities in forms other than currency, deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from institutional entities other than MFIs. OFIs include in particular corporations engaged primarily in long-term Þ nancing (such as Þ nancial leasing), securitised asset holdings, other Þ nancial holdings, securities and derivatives dealing (on their own account), venture capital and development capital. Portfolio investment: euro area residents™ net transactions and/or positions in securities issued by non-residents of the euro area (ﬁassetsﬂ) and non-residents™ net transactions and/or positions in securities issued by euro area residents (ﬁliabilitiesﬂ). Included are equity securities and debt securities (bonds and notes, and money market instruments), excluding amounts recorded in 
direct investment or reserve assets.Price stability: the maintenance of price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem. The Governing Council deÞ nes price stability as a year-on-year increase in the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. The Governing Council has also made it clear that, in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inß ation rates below, but close to, 2% over 
the medium term.
Primary balance: government net borrowing or net lending excluding interest payments on consolidated government liabilities.
Projections: the results of exercises conducted four times a year to project possible future macroeconomic developments in the euro area. Eurosystem staff projections are published in June and December, whereas European Central Bank (ECB) staff projections are published in March and September. They form part of the economic analysis pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB and are thus one of several inputs into the Governing Council™s assessment of the risks to price stability.Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system: a settlement system in which processing and 
settlement take place on an order-by-order basis (without netting) in real time (continuously) (see 
also TARGET).Reference value for M3 growth: the annual growth rate of M3 over the medium term that is consistent with the maintenance of price stability. At present, the reference value for annual M3 growth is 4½%.
Repurchase agreement: a contract to sell and subsequently repurchase securities on a speciÞ ed date and at a speciÞ ed price. Also called a ﬁrepoﬂ.
283ECBAnnual Report
2008Reserve base: the sum of the eligible balance sheet items (in particular liabilities) that constitute the basis for calculating the reserve requirement of a credit institution.Reserve ratio: the ratio deÞ ned by the central bank for each category of eligible balance sheet 
items included in the reserve base. The ratio is used to calculate reserve requirements. Reserve requirement: the minimum amount of reserves a credit institution is required to hold with the Eurosystem over a predeÞ ned maintenance period. Compliance with the requirement is determined on the basis of the average of the daily balances in the reserve accounts over the 
maintenance period.Reverse transaction: an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under a repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.Securities settlement system (SSS): a transfer system for settling securities transactions. It comprises all of the institutional arrangements required for the clearing and settlement of securities 
trades and the provision of custody services for securities.Securitisation: the pooling of Þ nancial assets, such as residential mortgage loans, and their 
subsequent sale to a special-purpose vehicle, which then issues Þ xed income securities for sale to investors. The principal and interest of these securities depend on the cash ß ows produced by the 
pool of underlying Þ nancial assets.
Settlement risk: the risk that settlement in a transfer system will not take place as expected, usually owing to a party defaulting on one or more settlement obligations. This risk comprises, in particular, 
operational risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.Stability and Growth Pact: the Stability and Growth Pact is intended to serve as a means of 
safeguarding sound government Þ nances in Stage Three of 
Economic and Monetary Union in order to strengthen the conditions for price stability and for strong, sustainable growth conducive to employment creation. To this end, the Pact prescribes that Member States specify medium-term 
budgetary objectives. It also contains concrete speciÞ cations on the 
excessive deÞ cit procedure
. The Pact consists of the Resolution of the Amsterdam European Council of 17 June 1997 on the 
Stability and Growth Pact and two Council Regulations, namely i) Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 
of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance 
and coordination of economic policies as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1055/2005 of 
27 June 2005, and ii) Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the 
implementation of the excessive deÞ cit procedure as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1056/2005 
of 27 June 2005. The Stability and Growth Pact is complemented by the ECOFIN Council™s report entitled ﬁImproving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pactﬂ, which was endorsed 
by the Brussels European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005. It is also complemented by the new 
Code of Conduct entitled ﬁSpeciÞ cations on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact 
and Guidelines on the format and content of stability and convergence programmesﬂ, which was 
endorsed by the ECOFIN Council on 11 October 2005.Standing facility: a central bank facility available to counterparties on their own initiative. The Eurosystem offers two overnight standing facilities: the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility.284ECBAnnual Report
2008Straight-through processing (STP): the automated end-to-end processing of trades/payment transfers, including, where relevant, the automated completion of conÞ rmation, matching, 
generation, clearing and settlement of orders.Systemic risk: the risk that the inability of one participant to meet its obligations in a system will cause other participants to be unable to meet their obligations when due, with possible spillover effects such as signiÞ cant liquidity or credit problems that may threaten the stability of the 
Þ nancial system. Such inability may be caused by operational or Þ nancial problems.TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system): 
the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system for the euro. TARGET2: a new generation of the TARGET system which replaces the former decentralised technical structure with a single shared platform offering a harmonised service with a uniform
