Executive Summary 
 Multiple adverse shocks have combined to dampen economic activity in Europe. High 
commodity prices have depressed real incomes and consumption, and propelled inflation to 

levels not seen in a decade. A strong euro and slowing demand from trade partners have 

acted as a drag on exports. And extraordinary 
financial stresses have
 been  negatively affecting advanced economies, while testing the resilience of emerging economies. 
 Activity is expected to stagnate in most advanced economies in the near term, as asset 
price and consumption booms deflate and financial institutions curb credit to reduce 

leverage. In most emerging economies, growth is projected to slow significantly. With the 

adjustment in the financial system likely to be arduous and protracted, a modest recovery is 

expected only later in 2009. Intensifying strains in the financial sector and a mutually 

reinforcing deterioration in financial and economic conditions constitute key downside risks. 

Increases in oil and food prices should ordinarily not generate a sustained rise in inflation. 

However, these increases have been so broad and sizable that concerns have arisen about 

demands for higher wages, which would put upward pressure on all prices. Emerging 

markets in which prior overheating pressures prevailed are particularly prone to a wage-price 

spiral. In advanced economies, the projected sharp weakening of activity together with the 

recent reduction in several key commodity prices should lead to a steady decline in inflation. 
 Stabilizing financial conditions is the policy priority. Achieving this goal necessitates 
global action, including liquidity provision when needed, and the restoration of healthy 

financial balance sheets by encouraging loss recognition and rebuilding of capital bases. 

European leaders will need to make a commitment to concerted and coordinated action to 

alleviate financial stresses. Given the importan
ce of cross-border financial institutions, the 
ongoing financial turmoil has made it clear that the European Union needs to put in place 

joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability to avoid the serious risk of 

backtracking on European financial integration. 
 While containing inflation remains a policy concern, nurturing the recovery is likely to 
gain policy prominence. In most advanced economies, headline inflation is projected to drop 

to levels below central bank objectives as a result of the very weak outlook for activity. In 

these circumstances and with further downside risks emanating from the financial sector, 

scope for easing monetary policy has emerged. Meanwhile, operation of automatic fiscal 
stabilizers should support activity, but safeguarding long-term fiscal sustainability requires 
deficits to be kept within the limits of fiscal rules. Exceptions can be considered, if and when 

public resources are needed to directly alleviate financial stresses. In many emerging 

economies, macroeconomic policy settings may need to be tightened further to address 

inflationary pressures and external vulnerabi
lities. And contingency plans should be put in 
place to deal with possible financial instability and hard landings. 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
viii 
 Advanced economies are better positioned than their emerging counterparts to head off 
second-round effects on inflation from the sur
ge in commodity prices (Chapter 2). Though 
vestiges of indexation remain in some countries, improved labor market flexibility, strong 

monetary policy credibility and the weak outlook for activity should limit the pass-through of 

commodity price shocks to core inflation. The risks of spillovers of price pressures to a 
broad range of goods are greater in the emerging economies, for which food and fuel 
account for a substantial share of consumption. For some of these economies, the rise in 

commodity prices adds to existing price pressures from overheating. Moreover, inflation 
may be more difficult to control in emerging markets with fixed exchange rates or limited 

monetary policy credibility.  
 The appropriate policy response to the commodity price increases depends on the 
source of the price pressures, the credibility of policymakers, and the degree of labor market 

flexibility. Because global demand factors played an important role in the run-up of 

commodity prices, a tighter-than-usual monetary
 policy stance may be warranted, especially 
in some emerging economies and in countries with greater labor market rigidities. Past 

experience suggests that policymakers should resi
st the temptation to try to maintain high 
growth in the face of adverse commodity price shocks. Rather, fiscal and structural policies 

are best aimed at easing supply bottlenecks and providing the right incentives to producers 

and consumers. As the ongoing financial market turmoil underscores, financial systems are inherently 
subject to cycles, with important but dissimilar consequences for real activity across 

countries (Chapter 3). Developments in national housing and corporate finance systemsŠ

which are reinforcing the role of financial assets as borrowing collateralŠhave the potential 

to make bank lending procyclical. In this way, the financial sector can amplify business cycle 

fluctuations, as well as the impact of monetary policy shocks and asset price movements on 

real activity. Cross-border ownership of assets
 further bolsters this mechanism. Analysis 
suggests that emerging economies are likely to be more vulnerable than advanced economies 

to the current downturn in the credit cycle, though with large differences across countries. 
 What can policymakers do to lessen the undesirable macroeconomic volatility associated 
with asset price dynamics? While there is no consensus yet on this issue, the introduction of 

a countercyclical element in prudential regulation could substantially reduce the volatility of 

investment, particularly in financially integra
ted economies with tighter borrowing limits. In 
this respect, financial integration remains essential to foster smooth and growth-oriented 

adjustment. At the same time, supervision needs to keep pace with increasingly complex 

linkages across borders by ensuring adequate
 coordination of financial policies across 
Europe, and especially within the euro area. 
 Along with international capital, the flow of labor across the borders of the European 
Union™s New Member States has been a key feature in their convergence process 

(Chapter 4). Since the onset of transition, these labor movements have intensified

appreciably and become increasingly diverse and flexible. Labor mobility has significant 
advantages: it speeds up convergence, boosts economy-wide capital-labor ratios, supports 

aggregate demand through remittances, and may help augment skills through the 

reintegration of returning migra
nts in domestic labor markets.  Contrary to some perceptions, restrict
ing labor mobility is not the answer to 
overheating pressures; policies to improve overall labor mobilization are a much better 

avenue. Rather than being a source of overheating, labor mobility is more likely to play a 
moderating role. Indeed, the wage increases during economic booms diminish the incentive 
to seek employment abroad and instead attract immigrants, both of which lessen pressure on 

domestic wages. However, outward labor mobility speeds up the wage increases normally 
associated with the process of income convergence. In the presence of labor market 
rigidities, such increases could set off second-round inflationary effects, which would need 

to be kept in check to preserve competitiveness. In addition, differences in age and skills 
composition between labor outflows and inflows could contribute to labor market 
mismatches. Policies to improve mobilization and utilization of labor are therefore key to 

supporting sustainable growth and securing a smooth domestic reallocation of resources.
11.  Outlook: Dealing with Shocks 
 After holding up well in early 2008, growth slowed 
markedly in Europe, mainly owing to the ongoing impact of 
external shocks. Inflation rose to levels not seen in a decade, 
but with commodity prices stabilizing and the prospect of very 
weak activity, inflationary pressures are expected to recede. 

Advanced economies have been hit by extraordinary financial 
stress whose alleviation has become the overriding policy 
concern. For most emerging economies, where resource 
pressures continue even though growth is moderating, the 
principal challenges are to bring inflation under control and 
address external imbalances. Meanwhile, contingency plans 
need to be prepared to deal with possible financial instability.

commodity price shocks intensified in the first half 
of 2008, causing a spike in headline inflation and 
sapping real disposable income and consumer 
demand (Figure 1). Financial turmoil, which was 
expected to dissipate, instead worsened again, first in 
JuneŒJuly 2008, when large financial institutions 
came under renewed pressure, and more recently in 
September with the failure of some large U.S. 
financial institutions. Europe was affected directly, 

through bank losses and an associated tightening of 
financial conditions for borrowers, and indirectly, 
through a weakening of demand from the United 
States, where the turmoil originated. Moreover,

account imbalances caused the euro to appreciate 
disproportionatelyŠbeyond its medium-term 
equilibrium value (Box 1)Šexerting a drag on 
growth.  Commodity price shocks have played an 
important role in the slowdown in activity in 
Europe, but tightening financial conditions have 
now taken over. Commodity price shocks adversely 
affected consumption in a few advanced economies 
already in the second half of 2007. This process 
came to a head in the second quarter of 2008, when 

the price level in the euro area jumped by nearly 2 
percent above the first quarter, triggering a 
significant decline in consumption. Investment, 
which had held up well, also fell as confidence 
plummeted and evidence surfaced of the worsening 
consequences for Europe of the global financial 
turmoil. While the euro area initially resisted the 
adverse shocks somewhat better than the United 
States, it has subsequently slowed faster, as dollar 

depreciation and more expansionary 
macroeconomic policies have helped support 
growth in the United States.  
 Meanwhile, headline inflation in Europe rose to a 
level not seen in a decade, though there are some 
tentative signs that it may have peaked in JuneŒJuly 

2008 (Figure 1). For the euro area, headline 
inflation, after being pushed up repeatedly by a 
sequence of commodity price shocks, stabilized at 4 
percent in July 2008, before easing to 3.8 percent in 
August 2008 as the result of falling energy prices. 
Inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol, and 
tobacco, has been relatively stable throughout, 
remaining below 2 percent. Observations on other 
advanced economies are similar, but the upward 

momentum in headline inflation has yet to turn in 
Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. 
Inflation expectations edged up following the latest 
spike in energy prices but have subsequently 
receded, especially in the euro area. Moreover, when 
adjusted for inflation risk premiums, break-even

3Box 1. How Strong Is the Euro?  
On the eve of its 10-year anniversary, the euro 
remains close to the strongest it has ever been, 
though the trend appreciation that began at the 
end of 2005 may have ended in August 2008. 
At its current level, the euro is assessed to have 
appreciated beyond its fundamental 
equilibrium level, but by considerably less than 
what the bilateral euroŒU.S. dollar exchange 
rate may suggest. The recent appreciation of 
the euro has contributed to slower growth and 
provoked concerns about competitiveness for 
some euro area members. 
The euro has appreciated considerably with 
respect to the U.S. dollar in recent years but 
significantly less in real effective terms (first 
figure). Its value has risen by 31 percent since 
the end of 2005 relative to the U.S. dollar, but 
in nominal effective terms it has appreciated by only half
 as much. In real terms, the euro has appreciated by 
12 percent when measured based on consumer prices and by 15 percent when measured based on relative 
unit labor costs. The euro area™s prices have been on a declining trend relative to the prices of the area™s 
trading partners, falling by 7½ percent since the introduction of the euro and by 2 percent since the end of 
2005.1With these developments, the euro was on the strong side relative to fundamentals up to the middle of 2008. 
IMF estimates of the equilibrium real effective exchange rate (REER) of the euro suggest that it was above its 
medium-run fundamentals by somewhat more than 10 percent.
 2 The euro area™s medium-run current account 
deficit is projected at about ¾ percent of GDP, compared with an equilibrium surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP 
based on real exchange rate models.
3Price levelŒdisaggregated data also confirm that the euro is on the strong side (second figure). Cross-country 
comparisons of purchasing power parity (PPP) prices relative to per capita GDP show that almost all euro 
 . . . continued
dd1 The weights of the countries in the REER calculation that had higher inflation rates than the euro area in 
the period 2005Œ07 add to 68.9 percent, compared with 31.3 percent for countries that had lower inflation 
rates. Moreover, inflation in the first group was higher than in the euro area by 2.3 percent, while inflation in 
the second group was lower than in the euro area by only 0.8 percent. 
2Equilibrium estimates are based on the IMF™s CGER approach. CGER stands for the Consultative Group 
on Exchange Rate Issues, which was established by the IMF in 1995 to strengthen its capacity to assess 
current account positions and exchange rate levels. The CGER assessments are based on three 
complementary approaches: the macroeconomic balance approach, the reduced-form equilibrium real 
exchange rate approach, and the external sustainability approach. For more details, see Lee and others (2008).

area countries are somewhat ﬁexpensiveﬂ

4 However, they do not 
seem to be more so than advanced European 
economies with flexible exchange rates. 
Most countries in the euro area or with fixed 
euro exchange rates have increased their export 
market shares in recent years despite the 
appreciation of the euro, though there are a 
few exceptions (third figure). The trade 
patterns of countries in the euro area and

not shifted inward (fourth figure), as would 
have been expected in response to 
deteriorating competitiveness. If anything, euro 
area and fixed euro exchange rate economies 
seem to have increased their trade with countries 
with flexible exchange rates with respect to the 
euro. 
Simulations of a cross-country econometric 
model estimated in Fabrizio, Igan, and Mody 
(2007) suggest that improvements in the quality 
of exported European products may have partly 
offset the negative impact of the euro 
appreciation on exports. The model explains 
movements in export market shares based on 
changes in REERs and a number of indicators 
related to changes in product quality and 
technology of exports. Based on these 
simulations, the euro appreciation during January 
2006 to May 2008 should reduce export market 
shares (normalized by the country™s GDP share 
in world GDP) by 3½ percentage points in the 
euro area and by 6 percentage points in 
4 PPP prices are used to adjust GDP to take into account the fact that prices of nontradable goods are usually 
cheaper in less developed countries and, therefore, the purchasing power of consumers in these countries is 
higher than dollar GDP numbers would imply. Accordingly, the higher a country™s per capita GDP, the lower 
its PPP conversion factor (the conversion factor is less than one in developed economies). Therefore, 
countries with conversion factors lower than those in ot
her countries with similar income levels have a higher 
level of prices, which suggests that real exchange rates in the former countries may be overvalued.

5European countries with fixed exchange rates to 
the euro, keeping everything else constant. The 
fact that export market shares in these economies 
have not deteriorated suggests that other factors 
in the model, such as quality improvements, may 
have played an offsetting role. 
inflation rates derived from bond yields suggest that 
inflation expectations have remained well behaved in 
the euro area (Bank for International Settlements, 
2008).Activity Expected to Stagnate While 
Inflation Recedes  
 Activity in the advanced economies is expected to 
be very weak during the second half of 2008 and 
first half of 2009, as the adverse consequences of 
the financial turmoil dampen growth, despite some 

relief from stabilizing commodity prices (Figure 2). 
Euro area growth will average 1.3 percent in 2008 
and 0.2 percent in 2009, before returning to 1.4 
percent in 2010 (Table 1). For many economies, the 
profile is likely to be one of stagnation into the first 
half of 2009, with several countries experiencing 
even a slight, temporary decline in activity.
2 Indeed, 
the continuing deterioration in business and 
consumer confidence and in other coincident and 

leading indicators does not bode well for the 
immediate future. Countries experiencing declining 
house prices after previous booms (e.g., Denmark,

detailed assumptions underlying these projections and the global 

context. 
Ireland, Spain, and the United Kingdom) are 
expected to see the sharper downturns (Hilbers and 
others, 2008). 
 Given the nature of the shocks hitting the 
European economy, a slowdown in growth is 
unavoidable. With Europe a net energy importer, 
the energy price shock is acting as a tax on 
household income paid abroad. Because the shock is 
generally perceived as permanent, households are 
not expected to dip into their savings, especially in 

the context of falling equity values and slower

7increases or declines in house prices. Exports to 
commodity producers may pick up somewhat, but 
will not meaningfully compensate for the 
reduction in domestic demand. Moreover, higher 
energy prices are likely to have adverse 
consequences for potential output as energy-
intensive capacity has to be phased out, which 
could be aggravated by real wage rigidities. The 
food price shock is different from this perspective, 
because it acts mostly to redistribute income 

among countries within Europe; however, it poses 
problems within each country because of its 
disproportionate effect on low-income 
households. While the stabilization of commodity 
prices might help real disposable income growth, 
resolving the banking crisis that is now affecting 
Europe will be an arduous and protracted process. 
Banks™ deleveraging will weigh on economic 
growth well into 2009.  
 In the baseline forecast, inflation is projected to 
recede steadily from mid-2008 onward, falling to 
below 2 percent by end-2009 in most advanced 
economies. This projection assumes that 
commodity prices stabilize, that there are no 
significant second-round effects through a wage-

price spiral, and that monetary policy credibility is 
preserved. While uncertainty is high, risks to the 
outlook for commodity prices appear balanced. 
The empirical analysis reported in Chapter 2 
together with the projected weakness in activity 
give ground for optimism about the validity of 
other baseline assumptions. Energy price shocks 
are not found to have fed into core inflation in 
advanced economies, while the effect of food 

price increases on core inflation has been small. 
Though vestiges of indexation remain, labor 
market flexibility in Europe has increased 
compared with earlier episodes of commodity 
price shocks, and monetary policy credibility 
seems well established. Moreover, the projected 
weakening of activity should put considerable 
downward pressure on wages and prices. 
 The extent of the slowdown and the shape of 
the recovery are highly uncertain. Commodity 
prices and the value of the euro could move 
favorably compared with the baseline. Although 
the recent easing of the pressures on these fronts 
may seem helpful, it seems to reflect an underlying 
demand slowdown and a reassessment of the 
relative growth prospects of Europe and the 
United States, to the de
triment of the former. 
External demand could falter more broadly, 
especially if an adverse feedback loop develops 
between advanced and emerging economies, 
based on trade linkages and the increased degree 

of production sharing. Domestic demand could, 
however, be stronger than expected as households 
in the majority of countries and nonfinancial 
enterprises have maintained sound balance sheets. 
For continental Europe, second-round effects on 
inflation from real wage settlements in excess of 
productivity constitute a 
further albeit small risk, 
in particular as (partial) indexation is still practiced 
in some countries (European Central Bank, 2008a, 

p. 51). Finally, against the background of 
unrelenting tensions in financial markets, the 
possibility of a mutually reinforcing deterioration 
of financial and economic conditions persists as 
the key risk. 
Financial Turmoil Continues . . .  
 Highly volatile financial markets continue to 

display significant stresses and high perceptions of 
risk (Figures 1 and 3). While global financial 
conditions improved following the rescue of U.S. 

investment bank Bear Stearns in March, tensions 
flared up again in July, when a large U.S. mortgage 
lender failed, and the U.S. Treasury and the 
Federal Reserve decided to extend wide-ranging 
and explicit guarantees to the government-
sponsored enterprises (GSEs).
3 In September, 
financial strains intensified further, causing the 
failure of systemically important U.S. financial 
institutions and requiring extraordinary public 

intervention to prevent a meltdown of the U.S. 
financial system. The banking crisis also reached 
Europe, where several financial institutions had to 
be rescued or resolved. Financial stock prices have

8fallen substantially, reflecting investor uncertainty 
about the viability of some banks. 
 Markets are concerned about losses related to 
subprime assets, exposures to unviable financial 
institutions, and the impact of the economic 
slowdown on general asset quality. One year after 
the onset of the financial turmoil, U.S. subprime-
related write-downs and reco
rded credit losses at 
European banks amounted to about $200 billion, 

not much less than those incurred by North 
American banks. Swiss banks™ losses reached a 
staggering $50 billion. As recorded losses are now 
shifting from trading to loan books and from large 
global banking groups to regional banks with large 
mortgage portfolios, the share of U.S. housing 
marketŒrelated losses borne by European banks 
should diminish. But recent failures of banks and 
insurance companies are adding further losses. 
Moreover, the economic slowdown in Europe is 
contributing to a broader deterioration of loan 
quality, especially in regions where housing 

markets are in decline.  
 Financial institutions are under severe pressure 
to reduce their high leverage.
4 Markets are paying 
increasing attention to pure rather than risk-
weighted leverage, an indicator on which 
European financial institutions score less 

favorably than their U.S.
 equivalents. Moreover, 
while recapitalization initially went well, with 
European banks raising $155 billion between the 
onset of the turmoil and mid-2008, it is now likely 
to slow. The appetite of sovereign wealth funds 
and institutional investors has diminished, while 
volatile financial markets, together with legal 
requirements that protect existing shareholders 
from dilution of ownership, weigh on the cost of 

raising capital. Instead, public intervention, asset 
sales, and bank consolidation have begun to play a 
more prominent role in attempts to strengthen 
capital positions.  
 Borrowing costs and credit default spreads 
have risen, and term spreads in money markets 

have remained at elevated levels (Figures 1 and 4). 
Segmentation in money markets has increased as 
well and term funding is virtually unavailable. 
These problems have moved to commercial paper, 
and, together with rising risk aversion, have 
pushed corporate bond yields of all ratings close 
to their highest levels of this decade. Generally, 
availability of credit has become severely impaired. 
 Financial stability continues to be at risk, 
though not likely in a systemic manner. As noted

9by the European Central Bank (ECB) in June, 
risks to the euro area™s financial stability had on 
balance increased since the beginning of the year 
(European Central Bank, 2008b), in line with 
similar observations by the central banks of the 
United Kingdom and Sweden (Bank of England, 
2008; and Riksbank, 2008). The disruptions in the 
U.S. financial system in September have 
heightened the risk of a systemic financial crisis in 
Europe further, though a full-blown crisis remains 

improbable and recent actions by the authorities 
should help in this respect. Nonetheless, 
additional banks may fail, as implied by their very 
high risk spreads and market doubts about the 
viability of their business models. 
. . . with Adverse Effects on Real 
Activity 
 Household credit is slowing significantly, and 
mortgage credit has slumped in several regional 
housing markets. Features of mortgage markets, in 
particular the role of colla
teral, are a key factor in 
determining the boom-bust dynamics of asset 
prices and their real effects (see Chapter 3 for 
details). In Ireland, house prices have now 

declined for over a year, and in the United 
Kingdom, they have dropped sharply over the 
past few months; meanwhile, in Spain they have 
started falling recently. Consequently, in these 
countries, construction activity has been 
contracting noticeably. The reliance on wholesale 
funding by Spanish banks entails a risk that the 
credit squeeze will stretch to other sectors, 
especially if funding costs rise further and the 

maturity profile of debt liabilities continues to 
shorten. Also, in the United Kingdom, there is an 
acute risk that adverse feedback loops between 
housing and credit sectors will have a sizable 
negative effect on real activity. 
 Tighter financing conditions are expected to 
temper the issuance of debt securities by 
European corporates. Debt issuance is expected 
to grind to a halt after a period of robust growth.  
Corporate bank lending is beginning to show signs 
of moderation, in line with the typically lagged 
response of such lending to the tightening of 
financing conditions over the credit cycle 
(Figure 5). These tighter conditions should 
increasingly affect European businesses that are 
highly dependent on bank lending and highly 
leveraged, with adverse consequences on business 
activity. Default rates are expected to rise from 
their recent historically low levels, with highly 
leveraged corporations and real estateŒrelated 
businesses being particularly vulnerable.  
Policies Need to Limit the Damage 
from Financial Turmoil 
 The immediate priority for central banks in 
advanced economies is to restore calm to financial 
markets through provision of liquidity as needed. 
With these economies set to slow, commodity 
prices stabilizing, and risks tilted to the downside 
from the financial turmoil, scope for monetary 

easing has emerged. In the euro area, the ECB 
signaled its determination to anchor inflation 
expectations and meet it
s inflation objective with an increase in the policy rate in early July 2008. 
Since then it has remained on hold as upside risks 
to inflation are diminishing and downside risks to 
output are rising. With the slowdown in activity 
clearly under way and inflation expectations well 
behaved, a more accommodative policy stance is 

now feasible. Meanwhile, to keep inflation 
expectations anchored, the Bank of England has

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
10kept rates unchanged since August 2008, but the 
sharp deterioration of the economic outlook for 
the United Kingdom is bringing forward the 
prospect of an easing of the policy stance. In 
other cases, such as Norway and Sweden, where 
activity has remained str
onger, central banks have 
recently tightened further, but the tightening cycle 
is likely to have run its course. 
 Financial sector policies should aim at resolving 
the stresses in the financial system. Actions on a 
scale similar to the U.S. intervention are unlikely 
to be required, but coordinated and concerted 
action is also needed in Europe. Proactive liquidity 
management has been appropriate, and helpful 
adjustments to liquidity management frameworks 
have been implemented in several countries and 

properly coordinated across borders. However, 
these frameworks should also feature incentives 
that support the improvement of credit quality of 
collateral deposited with central banks after the 
financial stress has dissipated. In this regard, the 
recent tightening of the ECB™s collateral policy 
will be helpful. But the banking crisis has now also 
required solvency support for major financial 
institutions, including some cross-border banks, 

while leading to the adoption of different 
guarantees by national governments. To restore 
confidence, European leaders will need to make a 
decisive commitment to concerted and 
coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses 
and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on 
European financial integration. Addressing the 
concerns raised by cross-border spillovers of 
actions taken by national authorities will require 

movement toward more joint responsibility and 
accountability for financial stability in Europe. 
 Looking further ahead, to dampen the 
propensity of the financial sector to amplify 
business cycle fluctuations and the impact of 
monetary policy and asset price developments on 

real activity, banking regulation may have to play a 
role in mitigating the cyclical swings in credit 
conditions (see Chapter 3 for detailed analysis).  
 Fiscal policies can help cushion the downturn, 
but medium-term fiscal sustainability needs to be 
safeguarded. In the current context, automatic 
stabilizers can be allowed to play fully around the 
required consolidation path, except in those 
countries where this would breach their fiscal 
rules. The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has 
improved fiscal discipline, but many European 
countries still face persistent challenges in meeting 
their medium-term objectives; in some countries, 

fiscal deficits risk exceeding the Maastricht deficit 
limit in the near term (Table 2). Similarly, the 
United Kingdom needs to set policy consistent 
with meeting its fiscal rules. In the current 
circumstances, discretionary loosening is unlikely 
to be effective and countries should set fiscal 
policy so as to reach their medium-term objectives 
in line with commitments under the revised SGP 
and consistent with medium-term fiscal rules. 

Discretionary use of fiscal resources should 
primarily be focused on measures to directly 
alleviate stress in financial markets, if and when 
needed. In reaction to higher commodity prices, the 
fiscal policy response should be limited to 

temporary, well-targeted income support to 
vulnerable households, while structural policies 
should promote supply and free trade. General 
fiscal support or a reduction in taxes on items 
most affected by the commodity price shocks 
would be counterproductive: both would boost 
demand, further aggravating wage and price 
pressures, and likely benefit the wealthy more. 
Instead, removing remaining supply-limiting 

distortions in the agricultural sector, including 
through a reform of the Common Agricultural 
Policy, and breaking the deadlock on the Doha 
Round of trade talks would provide clear benefits.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
12Emerging Economies  
Growth Is Slowing Significantly 
 Following a prolonged expansion, activity and 
domestic demand have started to moderate in 

emerging Europe, in most cases lowering growth 
rates toward more sustainable levels and beginning 
to reduce external imbalances (Figure 6 and 
Tables 1 and 2). In most countries, a slowdown 
was necessary to ease overheating pressures and 
bring growth rates in line with what could be 
justified by fundamentals (IMF, 2008c). The 
region has been relatively resilient to the global 
financial turmoil, but it is now increasingly facing 

tighter financial conditions and more discerning 
investors. Credit growth and capital inflows 
remain strong on average, but inflows have slowed 
noticeably and become more sensitive to 
individual countries™ imbalances, the soundness of 
policy frameworks, and progress in structural 
reforms. For some countries, for example the 
Baltics, the pace of credit growth has come down 
markedly from earlier peaks. Slower growth in 

advanced economies has weighed on exports, 
while price shocks have dampened consumption. 
Risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the 
downside, stemming primarily from external 
demand and external financial conditions, while in 
some cases domestic asset price declines could 
have a significant impact on the balance sheets of 
households, enterprises, and financial institutions, 
further undermining growth.  
 The extent of the slowdown varies considerably 
across the region, depending on the speed of the 
earlier expansion, the resulting external 

imbalances, and the stance of macroeconomic 
policies. Growth in central-eastern Europe
5 is 
easing to rates just below trend. The moderation is 
more pronounced in southeastern Europe, though 
this region is expected to continue to grow at rates 
above or close to potential. Moreover, Romania, 
Moldova, FYR Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Albania 
have yet to show significant signs of slowing. The 
Baltic economies are experiencing a more abrupt 

adjustment, with recessions in Estonia and Latvia, 
correcting an unsustainable economic boom 
(Box 2). Turkey is also slowing, while Russia™s oil-
driven boom has started easing. Financial risks 
have risen appreciably, constituting a key 
downside risk to the outlook for most emerging 
economies.Inflation Is Still a Concern . . . 
 Recent price shocks have affected emerging 

Europe substantially more than the rest of 

Europe, mainly due to the larger share of food 
and fuel in these countries™ consumption baskets 
(see Chapter 2). Global energy and food price 
increases have had a significant impact on 
domestic prices of these items. However, 
domestic factorsŠsuch as weather conditions, 
convergence-related price pressures, and trade 
integrationŠhave played a dominant role in 
determining food prices in recent years. Inflation 

in the region is projected to average about 11 
percent in 2008Œ09 (Table 1). Half of the 
countries in the region have already hit double-
digit inflation in 2008, with the highest rates 
observed in Ukraine, followed by Latvia, Belarus, 
and Russia.

OUTLOOK: DEALING WITH SHOCKS 
13Box 2. The Baltics: Harder Times Ahead 
Against a backdrop of wide economic imbalances, the Baltic economies are slowing sharply in response to a 
tightening of external financing conditions (figure). For years, domestic demand had grown too fast, driven 
by optimistic expectations about convergence, foreign-financed credit, and sharply rising real estate prices, 
amplified in some cases by procyclical fiscal policies. The resulting external and internal imbalances and 
financial risks eventually led the mainly Nordic-owned banks to tighten lending standards and slow credit 
growth, a move that has been reinforced by the global financial turbulence of the past year. As a result, 
growth has fallen. In Estonia, year-on-year growth fell close to zero in the first quarter of 2008; Latvia has 
experienced its slowest growth rate in a decade; and there has been some deceleration in Lithuania, albeit 
from a less elevated level. 
While a correction of economic imbalances was needed, adjustment will not be easy. As demand continues 
to unwind, labor market pressures should dissipate and current account deficits narrow. But the resumption 
of balanced growth will involve reallocating resources from nontradables to tradables, and wage growth will 
need to move back into line with productivity growth. Even though the Baltic economies are relatively 
flexible, this could take some time, with competitiveness deteriorating in the interim. In the financial sector, 
slowing GDP growth will lead to a decline in credit quality, which will put pressure on bank capital; 
however, overall financial sector resilience will be supported by large foreign-owned banks with a long-term 
commitment to the region. The slowdown will also erode government revenue, pushing budgets into deficit, 
although low public indebtedness should mitigate concerns about fiscal solvency. The adjustment could be 
painful, but delaying would entail a longer and deeper growth slowdown. 
While the burden of adjustment will fall primarily on
 the private sectorŠas de
scribed aboveŠ
consistent 
and well-articulated policies will be needed to en
courage smooth adjustment and maintain investor 
confidence: 
Public communications should guide private sector expectations about a realistic adjustment path and 
emphasize the need for wage restraint. 
Adjustment can be facilitated by structural reforms to improve the flexibility of goods and factors 
markets.   In the financial sector, the authorities should ensure that banks maintain adequate capital and liquidity, 
that high prudential standards are maintained, and that
 financial safety nets be upgraded where necessary.
Automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to operate, and discretionary easing of fiscal policy 
avoided.

OUTLOOK: DEALING WITH SHOCKS 
15 Rising core inflation suggests that commodity 
price shocks have exacerbated existing 
overheating pressures (Figures 7 and 8 and 
Chapter 2). Continued strong demand (primarily 
in Bulgaria and Romania) and, in some cases, 
wages rising faster than productivity (primarily in 
central-eastern Europe) have been key factors. 
Core inflation so far in 2008 has increased the 
most in Russia and Bulgaria. It has fallen only in 
Hungary and Moldova.  
 In contrast to advanced economies, several 
emerging economies in Europe have responded to 
the recent commodity price shocks with 
administrative measures to limit their impact on 
inflation and increase food supplies. Measures 
have included lower import tariffs and other trade 

barriers on selected food items (FYR Macedonia, 
Moldova, and Russia); selective food export taxes 
(Croatia and Russia); food export quotas 
(Ukraine); temporary export bans for wheat 
(Serbia); lower consumption taxes for food 
(Lithuania), public transportation (FYR 
Macedonia), and petroleum (Croatia); use of state 
commodity reserves to replenish domestic food 
supply (FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, 

and Ukraine); subsidies and other support to 
agriculture (Belarus, Croatia, and Moldova); and a 
tax relief to oil refineries (Belarus). Attempts to 
limit food price inflation have also been 
undertaken through direct caps on price margins 
(Belarus) or by moral suasion (FYR Macedonia 
and Montenegro). These measures have not, on 
balance, substantially altered prevailing inflationary 
pressures. 
. . . but External Imbalances Present 
the Major Risks 
 Risks of a hard landing remain elevated in parts 
of the region. Although external imbalances are 
expected to narrow as growth rates fall in most 

countries (Table 2), they remain high by historical 
standards and compared with other emerging 
economies. Moreover, about half of the countries 
in the region still have double-digit current 
account deficits as a share of GDP. Large external 
imbalances and a high dependence on foreign 
financing are exposing a number of countries in 
the region to external shocks and changes in 
international credit conditions and investors™ 
sentiment. Decisions by foreign banks to limit 
their exposure to the region, following the recent 

increase in risk aversion and financial market 
volatility, could affect financial conditions more 
than domestic policies.  
 Indeed, market confidence has eroded recently. 
Risk premiums and borrowing costs have 
increased throughout the region since mid-2007,

16although from historically low levels (Figures 9 
and 10). Stock market indices have also dropped 

markedly in most countries so far in 2008; in the 
case of Russia triggering a temporary suspension 
of trading. Against the background of the seizure 
of U.S. financial markets in September, some 
emerging economies experienced capital outflows 
and/or a very sharp widening of spreads. Banks 
operating in emerging Europe are being affected 
by the widening turmoil in western Europe. 
Policies Need to Engineer a Soft 
Landing For nearly all of emerging Europe, tightening 
macroeconomic policies to reduce external 
imbalances and contain inflation, and putting in 
place contingency plans to deal with potential 
financial instability remain a priority. Where 
possible, monetary policy has been tightened (the 
Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, 

and Turkey), and exchange rates have been 
allowed to appreciate to ease inflation pressures 
(particularly in central-eastern Europe). For 
central-eastern Europe, risks to inflation and 
growth now appear balanced, justifying keeping 
monetary policy on hold. Elsewhere, however, 
further tightening seems required to address 
concerns about second-round effects from recent 
price shocks and help reduce external imbalances. 

In south-eastern Europe, mindful of the more 
volatile external environment, reining in domestic 
demand, in particular by containing growth in 
public expenditure, is essential. Fiscal balances are 
projected to improve in one-third of the countries 
in 2008, and delivering on this intention will be 
essential (Table 2). In addition, with output still 
above potential in several countries and rising 
fiscal deficits in most, the pace of fiscal 

consolidation in the region needs to be stepped 
up. The challenge for Russia is to address the 
concerns about the stability of its financial system, 
while alleviating the impact of the commodity 
boom on domestic demand through a 
combination of monetary tightening, greater 
exchange rate flexibility, and a prudent fiscal 
stance (Box 3).   
 While fiscal consolidation remains key, some 
targeted and temporary income support for 
vulnerable households is needed and preferable to 
the use of administrative measures to attempt to 
curb inflationary pressures. Income support 
policies will need to be carefully designed to avoid 
adding to overall demand pressure. Administrative 

measures, which usually introduce further market 
distortions, preventing supply and demand from

17Box 3. Russia: Dealing with Surging Commodity Exports 
The worldwide surge in commodity prices is fueling Russia™s already-booming economy. Like elsewhere, 
rising food and commodity prices have directly boosted domestic inflation, especially with food items 
representing over 40 percent of Russia™s 
consumption basket. However, in contrast to 
most other European economies, Russian firms 
are benefiting from the commodity price boom. 
Oil and gas account for around 20 percent of 
GDP, and about 60 percent of export earnings 
(with coal, metals, and precious stones 
accounting for another 20 percent). Russia™s 
terms of trade have increased by over 110 
percent during 2000Œ08, representing a 
cumulative gain of about 25 percent of GDP. 
Almost one-third of this gain has accrued in 2008 
alone.  
The effect on the domestic economy has been 
muted by the operation of Russia™s Oil 
Stabilization Fund. Established in 2004, this fund 
has set aside 85 percent of all marginal windfall 
oil revenues in excess of $27 a barrel, and has 
been key in sterilizing the domestic impact of 
surging export revenues (figure).  
Nonetheless, there has been significant leakage 
into domestic demand. With rising export prices 
adding to strong growth prospects, domestic 
demand has recently risen at a rate of about 15 
percent a year, more than double most estimates 
of potential growth. As a result, inflation has 
moved up sharply, well beyond what can be 
justified by increases in food and energy prices. 
Temporary measures to calm select food prices in 
2007, through export tariffs and strategic grain 
sales, were widely held to be ineffective, and have 
largely been allowed to lapse. 
A gradual widening of the non-oil fiscal deficit 
has contributed to demand. This, in turn, stems 
from intense political pressure to spend more of 
Russia™s windfall gains on the economy™s critical 
social and infrastructure needs. Additionally, 
efforts to increase public savings through the 
stabilization fund have been offset by substantial 
private dissaving.

18Box 3 (concluded)
In this context, monetary policy has been largely accommodating, notwithstanding recent incremental 
increases in policy rates and reserve requirements. Concerned about Russia™s external competitiveness, the 
central bank has been reluctant to allow nominal appreciation, and thus has heavily intervened in the foreign 
exchange market. With limited scope to sterilize these interventions, the result has been rapid money and 
credit growth and, ultimately, inflation. Deteriorating investor sentiment has recently added substantial 
volatility, with liquidity conditions tightening sharply and the exchange rate depreciating. 
Against the background of this challenging environment, the IMF has advocated a different policy mix. 
Monetary policy will need to be refocused on inflation reduction in the context of more exchange rate 
flexibility. Moreover, fiscal policy will need to avoid any further stimulus until demand pressures ease. 
However, the recent disruption in domestic financial markets has complicated the policy response, requiring 
liquidity support and possibly use of fiscal resources to shore up the financial system. 
adjusting to the new price signals, should be 
avoided. Instead, the current price shocks should 
be seized as an opportunity to remove existing 
distortions and unclog bottlenecks in domestic 
commodity markets, including by liberalizing 
commodity trade and eliminating production 
subsidies. Competition in the food and energy 
sectors could be enhanced to increase supply and 
ease price pressures. Land reform (for example, in 

Ukraine and Croatia) and public investment in 
energy efficiency would also pay off in the 
medium term.  
 In countries where the adjustment has been 
more abruptŠprimarily in the BalticsŠpolicies 
have to strike a balance among the needs to 

support the economy, control inflationary 
pressures, and sustain market confidence. The 
adjustment should be allowed to take its course, 
cushioned by the free operation of automatic 
fiscal stabilizers. Meanwhile, a strengthening of  
the financial system and its supervision, including 
the cross-border dimension, is paramount. 
 A reinvigorated commitment to structural 
reforms, including in the financial sector, could 
smooth the adjustment and improve the long-
term prospects of the region. As previous IMF 
work has shown, parts of emerging Europe 
(primarily southeastern Europe, parts of central-
eastern Europe, and the Commonwealth of 
Independent States countries) lag well behind 
progress achieved in the rest of Europe in 
liberalizing product and labor markets, creating a 
business-friendly environment, and tackling 
inefficient bureaucracies and corruption (IMF, 
2008c). Continuing strengthening of financial 

sector supervision and progress in institutional 
reforms should ensure that financial development 
proceed without adding volatility, thus 
contributing to the region™s convergence with the 
rest of Europe. 
192. Europe: Coping with High Commodity Prices  
 The surge in commodity prices has boosted headline 
inflation across Europe. Analysis 
in this chapter focuses on 
the risks to inflation. Though some rigidities remain, 
improved labor market flexibility, the weakening economy, 
and strong monetary policy credibility should help limit 
second-round effects in the advanced economies. The risks of 
spillovers of price pressures to a broad range of consumption 
goods are greater in the emerging economies, where food and 
fuel account for a substantial share of consumption. 
* Commodity prices have surged in recent years. 

Oil prices have doubled since the end of 2006. 
Global food and metals prices have also risen 
sharply (Figure 11). The current boom in 
commodities has also lasted longer than most 
historical episodes. With food and energy prices 
accounting for a significant share of consumption, 
the commodity price increases have boosted 

headline inflation across Europe (Figure 12). For 
some emerging economies, the rise in food and 
energy prices is adding to existing price pressures 
from overheating and convergence-related factors. 
 Large increases in commodity prices present a 
difficult challenge for policymakers. A major 

concern is that these increases have been so broad 
based and sizable that they may trigger a rise in 
inflation expectations and demands for higher 
wages, which would put upward pressure on all 
prices.
6 At the same time, commodity price rises 
depress real growth for the commodity-importing 
countries.  
The commodity price boom raises the following 
key questions, which are addressed in this chapter:

20key role since it has been commodity intensive. In 
addition, oil demand in many countries has been 
relatively insulated from rising prices through 
various policy measures, often at a significant 
fiscal cost.
9 On the supply side, markets have been 
vulnerable to disruptions, as spare capacity is at 
relatively low levels and the cost of developing 
new oil fields has risen. In the long term, oil price 
prospects will depend on how quickly capacity 
constraints ease and on the responsiveness of 
demand to high prices. However, in real terms, 
fuel prices will remain significantly above the low 
levels of the early 2000s. Futures markets suggest 
that oil prices in U.S. dollars are expected to 

remain around their current spot level.    
 Food prices have been pushed up by a 
combination of rising de
mand and weather-related supply shocks. Strong consumption growth, 
especially in the emerging economies, contributed

to the increase in food prices. Soaring demand for 

corn and vegetable oils from biofuel producers 
has been an additional factor. On the supply side, 
droughts in 2006 and 2007 damaged grain crops. 
Higher energy costs and rising fertilizer prices 

have also boosted food production and 
distribution costs. Finally, the imposition of more 
restrictive food trade policies in a number of 
countries has caused a temporary overshooting of 
prices. The estimated contribution of each of 
these factors to the global rise in prices for some 
major foods varies considerably (Figure 13). 
Looking forward, the resolution of weather-
related supply disruptions and the removal of 

trade restrictions will lead to some easing of 
prices. Nonetheless, price pressures from high 
energy prices and rising biofuel production will 
remain.  Figure 12. Advanced and Emerging Europe: Contribution of Food and Fuel Price Increases to Headline Inflation

EUROPE: COPING WITH HIGH COMMODITY PRICES 
21 To summarize, prices of commodities relative 
to other goods are likely to stay at a higher level. 
The issue facing policymakers is how to facilitate a 
smooth adjustment of relative prices and ensure 
that the rise in headline inflation remains a 
temporary phenomenon. The following section 

looks at the implications of the commodity price 
boom for inflation prospects in Europe. 
Effect of Commodity Price 
Increases on Inflation in the 
Advanced Economies  
 Higher international oil and food prices raise 
domestic inflation directly, by affecting the energy 
and food components of the consumer price 
index (CPI). Most of the increase in headline 

inflation in advanced Europe over the last year has 
been due to this ﬁfirst-roundﬂ effect. Meanwhile, 
core inflation (a measure of inflation excluding 
food and energy) has remained subdued so far 
(Figure 14).  There could also be ﬁsecond-round effectsﬂ on 
inflation, if workers demand higher wages to 
compensate for the loss in their purchasing power 
and if firms pass on the higher costs of 
production to the price of other goods. There are 
concerns that the current period of persistently 
high commodity price inflation may unhinge 
inflation expectations and trigger demands for 
higher wages, which would affect all prices. 
 Turning to the data, inflation expectations have 
increased both in the United Kingdom and in the 
euro area, although the July rate hike in the euro 
area seems to have reversed the upward trend in 
inflation expectations (Figure 15).
10 Labor costs in 
the euro area have also edged up over the past 
year but remain relatively contained (Figure 16).   
 To assess the likelihood that rising commodity 
prices could cause broader price pressures, the 
historical pass-through of commodity prices to 
core inflation is analyzed, using a vector 

autoregression (VAR) model for a set of advanced 
economies (Box 4). The results of the analysis 
suggest the following:  
The pass-through from international fuel 
prices to domestic headline and core inflation 
has diminished considerably since the 1970s. 

As discussed in Blanchard and Gali (2007), the 
muted response to oil price shocks in recent 
years can be explained by a combination of

bond pricesŠfor the United Kingdom have also stabilized

22 better monetary policy, more flexible wages, 
and a lower oil intensity of production in the 
advanced economies. The pass-through from international to 
domestic food prices seems to have 
strengthened somewhat since the mid-1990s, 
following a number of reforms that increased 

competition in agricultural production. 
Nonetheless, the pass-through from food price 
shocks to core inflation remains relatively low 

for most countries.  
 To summarize, in contrast to the 1970s, energy 
price increases have not ha
d a significant effect on 
core inflation over the last two decades for the 
advanced economies. The effect of food price 

rises on core inflation has also been relatively 

small. However, one should keep in mind that the 
cumulative commodity price increases over the 
last four years have been higher than anything 

experienced in the previous two decades, so the 
actual pass-through going forward may still 
surprise on the upside.  
To complement this analysis, the inflation 
outlook for the euro area and the risks around it 
are evaluated using econometric analysis and 

model simulations based on more recent data 
(Box 5). The econometric forecasting models take 
into account recent developments in the domestic 

and global economy that can influence inflation. 
The forecasts suggest that inflation would start to 
fall gradually toward the inflation target as 

commodity price growth subsides and economic 
growth slows. However, the risks around the 
central forecast are subst
antial. A forward-looking 
structural model of the economy also implies that 

the combination of a relatively tight monetary 
policy stance, slowing economic growth, and 
deteriorating financial conditions will gradually 

dampen inflationary pressures.   
Effect of Commodity Price 
Increases on Inflation in the 
Emerging Economies
11The rise in commodity prices has had an even 
larger impact on headline inflation in the emerging 
economies in Europe, due to the larger share of 
food and fuel in their consumption baskets. To 

assess the effect of international commodity price 

changes on domestic inflation, a VAR model is

EUROPE: COPING WITH HIGH COMMODITY PRICES 
23Box 4. Pass-Through of Commodity Price Sh
ocks to Inflation in Some Advanced 
European Economies 
To evaluate the impact on inflation of commodity price shocks and separate it from other potential 
inflationary pressures, such as economic growth and monetary policy, a five-variable structural vector 
autoregressive (SVAR) model is used. The domestic price response of commodity price shocks for 
12 European countries is assessed, as well as the changes over time in the nature and size of those effects.
1The baseline VAR includes the following variables: the nominal price of oil and food, different measures of 
domestic inflation (food, energy, core, and headline), a measure of economic activity, and a measure of the 
monetary stance.
2Fluctuations in crude oil prices are found to be no longer as important as they were 20 to 30 years ago. 
Estimates of the impact of a 10 percentage point oil price shock on domestic energy inflation, core inflation, 
and headline inflation are reported for two different sample periods, pre- and post-1986 (first table).
3 The 
break date chosen is one commonly identified in the literature, and each subperiod contains two large oil 
shock episodes (Blanchard and Gali, 2007). First-round effects persist, as part of the increase in oil prices is 
mechanically reflected in the energy component of the consumer price index (CPI). However, and more 
important, the impact on headline inflation is more subdued after 1986, and the shock does not last as long. 
This evidence is consistent with Blanchard and Gali™s (2007) hypothesis that the macroeconomic effects of 
oil price shocks have become more negligible in advanced economies in recent years, owing to a 
combination of better monetary policies, more flexible wages, and lower oil dependency.

3  Oil shocks are identified by assuming that only oil price shocks can influence oil prices in the long run; 
only oil and food shocks are allowed to influence international food prices in the long run. A vertical, long-
run Philips curve is assumed to give two restrictions, which state that monetary policy shocks and aggregate 
demand shocks have no long-run impact on industrial production. Additionally, monetary policy shocks are 
not allowed to have a contemporaneous effect on real economic activity.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
24Box 4 (concluded)
Contrary to the findings on oil price shocks, the impact of international food price shocks has been more 
pronounced in recent years. Domestic food inflation shifted up more and remained positive for a protracted 
period after 1996.
4 The impact on headline inflation follows mechanically, though it is less than 
proportional, while core inflation remains relatively unaffected, except for Germany and Sweden (second 
table).  
A possible explanation for the more intense pass-through of food prices in the past decade lies in the major 
institutional and policy changes experienced by European countries in the 1990s. The MacSharry reformŠ
the first major reform of the Common Agricultural policy (CAP), launched in 1992
5 and implemented over 
the subsequent four yearsŠreplaced market support by direct income support. This reform, accompanied 
by compulsory set-asides of arable land, led to a rapid decline in supply and in stocks. In addition, following 
negotiations for the Uruguay Round and the creation 
of the World Trade Organization in 1995, market 
support from the CAP (the intervention price and the associated border measures that determined import 
tariffs and export refunds) was significantly reduced, thus curtailing incentives for supply surpluses and 
reducing the space for buffering future shocks. 
4 A structural break in the international food price series seems to have occurred in 1996, coinciding with a 
rise in U.S. demand for ethanol and increased corn imports by developing countries, in particular China and 
Mexico (European Commission, 2008). 
5 The pre-1992 CAP guaranteed a minimum price to producers and imposed a system of variable tariffs, as 
well as a system of storage and disposal of surplus domestic production. This system was extremely 
ﬁsuccessfulﬂ in expanding agricultural production, leading to sizable supply surpluses and consequent costly 
budget expenditures.

EUROPE: COPING WITH HIGH COMMODITY PRICES 
25Box 5. Inflation Outlook in the Euro Area 
This box uses two approaches to form a view about the inflation outlook and the risks around it. First, a set of 
inflation forecasts is produced from a large number of empirical forecasting models.
1 The advantage of this 
approach is that it captures the effects of numerous macroeconomic variables on the inflation process; the 
disadvantage is that it is backward looking. Second, a small structural model of the euro area is used to project 
inflation.
2 This approach has the advantages of being forward looking, accounting for simultaneity of the shocks, 
and incorporating the ECB™s policy response.  
The results from the set of inflation-forecasting models suggest that inflation will decline over the next two years 
to the ECB™s target of ﬁbelow but close to 2 percentﬂ (first figure). The distribution of the inflation forecasts 
implies substantial risks around the central forecast. In that regard, the interaction between wages and inflation 
expectations is key, as Granger causality tests suggest they do affect each other.  
The results from the structural model also portray a benign inflation outlook. Because of the tight financial 
conditions and the expected weakening of aggregate demand, inflation is projected to decline below 2 percent by 
the end of 2009 (second figure). The model results therefore support the ECB™s view that, following the increase 
in the policy rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent in July, ﬁthe monetary policy stance ... will contribute to 
achieving our objectiveﬂ (see ECB, 2008c).

1  For the methodology and further details on the forecasting framework, see Stavrev (2006). 
2 The model has three behavioral equationsŠaggregate demand, aggregate supply (inflation equation), and a 
monetary policy reaction function. Important elements of the model are the central bank™s credibility and 
forward-looking nature of market participants. Additional features are the estimation of model-consistent 
potential output and natural interest rates. The model is estimated using Bayesian techniques, with quarterly data 
from the first quarter of 1993 to the second quarter of 2008.

26Box 5 (concluded)
On balance, the results suggest that the 
combination of a tighter monetary stance, 
slowing growth, and tighter overall financial 
conditions is gradually dampening the 
inflationary forces. However, there are risks to 
the inflation outlook. On the downside, the 
real economy may slow even more sharply 
than currently envisaged. On the upside, with 
the labor market sill somewhat tight, there are 
some risks of second-round effects. Going 
forward, economic and labor market 
developments will be of particular importance. 
used.
12 The results suggest that increases in world 
fuel prices have a significant impact on domestic 

energy inflation in most countries (Table 3). The 
pass-through is very rapidŠthe peak effect is 
typically reached in six months (or less) after the 
increase in world prices. 
 Shocks to international food price inflation also 
have a significant impact on domestic food 

inflation for many emerging economies (Table 3). 
However, variance decompositions suggest that, 
while 30 percent of the variability of domestic fuel 
prices can be attributed to global price shocks, 
_______ 
12 The model includes the following variables: world fuel and 
food inflation, the 12-month change in the industrial 

production index as a measure of economic activity, domestic 
energy inflation, domestic food inflation, core inflation, the 3-
month money market rate, and the 12-month change in the 
nominal effective exchange rate. The model is a ﬁnearﬂ VAR 
as international food and fuel prices depend only on their 
lagged values, and not on domestic variables. Block-
exogeneity tests confirm the validity of this assumption. The 
model is estimated on monthly data from the late 1990s to 
March 2008. Impulse responses are obtained using the 

Cholesky decomposition, with the variables ordered as listed 
above. For Ukraine, a dummy is included among the 
explanatory variables to account for the spike in energy 

import prices from Russia in 2006Œ07. 
only 10 percent of the volatility in domestic food 
prices can be attributed to changes in global food 
prices. Therefore, domestic factorsŠsuch as local 

weather conditions, rising wages and 
transportation costs, increasing local demand for 
higher-value-added food items driven by income 
convergence, and continuing trade integrationŠ
are key drivers of local food prices.

13 For net food exporters, surging international food prices 
increase domestic demand, which adds to inflation pressures.

EUROPE: COPING WITH HIGH COMMODITY PRICES 
27 Complementing this analysis, a panel regression 
was estimated to examine the contribution of 
various factors to changes in domestic food 
inflation.14 The results show that, over the past 
year, three factors explain most of the increase in 
domestic food price inflation: the international 
food price shocks, disruptions in local agricultural 
production due to bad weather, and inflation 
inertia. Real effective exchange rate appreciations 
had a moderating effect on inflation in a number 

of countries. 
 There are tentative signs that rising commodity 
prices are causing broader price pressures in 
emerging Europe. Over the last year, core 
inflation has edged up, inflation expectations have 
risen, and unit labor costs have increased in a 

number of economies (Figures 17Œ19).
15 Of course, these developments may also be caused by 
overheating pressures and tight labor markets. To 
isolate the effect of commodity price changes on 
core inflation from other factors, the responses of 
core inflation to changes in domestic food and 
fuel prices are examined in the VAR framework.
16The results imply that some emerging economies 

are susceptible to second-round effects. The 

spillover from domestic food inflation shocks to 
domestic core inflation is positive and significant 
in eight countries, while the spillover from fuel

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
28inflation has been the most important 
contributing factor to the rise in core inflation in 
emerging Europe. Other factors, such as inflation 
inertia, real effective exchange rate changes, and 
price convergence, have played a smaller role. 
Policy Responses 
 Policymakers have taken various actions to 
mitigate the negative impact of high food and fuel 
prices on consumers (Table 5). A number of 
countries have tightened 
monetary policy, while 
others have changed their tax and tariff policies. 
In response to public pressure, some governments 
have considered cutting gasoline taxes. Model 
simulations suggest, however, that such measures 
would be counterproductive (Box 6). Generally, 

fiscal and structural policies should focus on 
easing supply bottlenecks, providing the right 
incentives to producers and consumers, and 
ensuring a well-functioning social safety net for 
the most vulnerable. The following sections 
discuss some factors that monetary policymakers 
need to consider when faced with commodity 
price shocks.   
The Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Response to Commodity Price 
Increases . . .  
 Sharp increases in commodity prices present a 
difficult challenge for monetary policymakers in 
the commodity-importing countries. Higher input 
costs reduce real growth, while putting upward 
pressure on inflation. Setting an interest rate path 
that helps the economy adjust smoothly is a 
delicate balancing act. As the experience of the 
1970s shows, policy mistakes can have serious

29Box 6. The Effects of Cutting Taxes on Gasoline 
Some governments have considered cutting taxes on gasoline to mitigate the impact of the oil price increase on 
consumers. While there is a case for using social policy to protect the most vulnerable from the rise in commodity 
prices, an across-the-board cut in gasoline taxes is not a good policy proposal for three reasons. First, it is not 
targeted. Second, demand for oil will be higher than it would have been in the absence of policy intervention, and 
thus the price of oil will be higher. Finally, a cut in gasoline taxes may have to be financed by raising other taxes, 
likely with negative effects on economic growth. 
The economic impact of a gasoline tax reduction is assessed using an extended version of the IMF Global 
Economy Model (GEM) that explicitly incorporates produc
tion and trade in oil (Elekdag and others, 2008; and 
Lalonde and Muir, 2008).  
The response of oil prices, output, consumption, and investment in the euro area to a 10 percentage point 
reduction in ad valorem gasoline taxes is shown in the 
figure. The reduction of gasoline taxes is assumed to be 
financed by an increase in taxes on labor income, which have significant disincentive effects on labor supply. The 
gasoline tax cut slows the process of substitution away from energy consumption. Oil prices rise relative to the 
baseline, offsetting some of the effect of the lower gasoline taxes for the consumer. The oil trade balance 
deteriorates, and the real exchange rate depreciates to stimulate exports and crowd out imports. The increase in 
labor taxes reduces aggregate employment and investment. Consumption declines, owing both to the negative 
wealth effect of higher oil prices and to the reduction in productive capacity and real income. 
Instead of reducing gasoline or food taxes, a better approach is to develop a well-targeted social safety net. From 
an efficiency standpoint, it is better to pass on the full commodity price increase to consumers since that will 
encourage producers to raise supply and consumers to adjust demand. From a fairness standpoint, the benefits of 
reducing consumption tax rates accrue disproportionately to the higher-income households, since they consume a 
larger absolute amount of all goods (including energy and food). At the same time, it is the poorest households 
that are least able to cope with the price increases, given the large share of food in their consumption baskets. A 
policy of targeted transfers would ameliorate the impact of higher commodity prices on the most vulnerable 
without creating distortions or imposing an undue burden on the budget.

30negative economic consequences.
18 The 
magnitude of the economic effects and the 
appropriate monetary policy response will depend, 
among other factors, on the presence of nominal 
and real rigidities in the economy, on the drivers 
of the oil price increase, and on the degree of 
policy credibility.. . . Depends on the Flexibility of 
Labor Markets, . . . 
 How can producers respond to rising nonwage 
costs? In the short run, they can accept a 
reduction in profits. However, capital markets 
reward firms with higher rates of return, so 
lowering profit margins could be only a temporary 
solution. In the medium term, firms should either 
raise productivity or reduce real wages.
19 In case of 
a downward rigidity of wages, the monetary 
authorities have to raise interest rates to prevent a 

wage-price spiral.  
 Model simulations illustrate the effects of 
temporary real wage resistance after a rise in the 
price of oil (Figure 20).
20 In the baseline scenario 
(the solid line), wages adjust promptly in response 
to higher oil prices triggered by a disruption in oil 
_______ 
18 Commodity prices rose steeply in the 1970s against a 
background of already-rising inflation and low interest rates. 
Wage earners, organized in powerful unions, tried to preserve 
their purchasing power and demanded higher wages, which 
led to second-round effects on inflation. In response to the 
commodity price shock, initially monetary policymakers 
focused on maintaining high growth rates and continued 
easing monetary policy, further increasing inflation. High 
inflation became entrenched in many countries. Eventually, 
inflation was brought down by substantial, sustained 

monetary policy tightening, at th
e cost of a significant output 
loss and high unemployment.   
19 Theoretically, when the price of an input in the production 
function (energy) increases, the marginal product of labor 
declines, implying that real wages will need to adjust 
accordingly. Energy-intensive capital becomes obsolete; 
therefore, the capital stock also declines. Overall, an increase 
in commodity prices is equivale
nt to a negative productivity 
shock, and, therefore, potential output declines.

augmented with energy prices, and calibrated for the euro 
area. Details on the model calibration and simulations are 

available from Dora Iakova. 
supply. In the second scenario (the dotted line), 
real wages are assumed to remain unchanged for 
two years before gradually coming down to the 
new equilibrium. In the latter case, there is a 
secondary spike in inflation (a second-round 
effect) as firms increase prices to be able to pay 
the higher wages. Interest rates need to rise by 
more and stay higher longer to bring inflation 
back to target. The tight monetary policy will 
result in greater output loss than in the scenario of 

flexible labor markets. In
 summary, if real wages 
adjust quickly, monetary policymakers can 
accommodate the commodity price increase, 
minimizing the impact on the real economy. If 
not, monetary policy will need to remain tight to 
prevent second-round effects. 
 Structural reforms have improved the flexibility 
of labor markets in Europe over the past two 
decades. Employment rates have been on a trend 
rise in a number of countries. In addition, the 
globalization of the labor markets, and especially 
the greater mobility of labor within the European 
Union, has helped keep wage growth broadly in 
line with productivity. Therefore, wage adjustment 
should be smoother than in the 1970s. However, 

based on various measures of labor market 
rigidities, many advanced European countries still 
rank among the economies with less flexible labor 
markets, and some still have wage indexation. This 
fact explains the close watch that policymakers are 
keeping on wage developments in Europe. 
. . . on the Credibility and Experience 
of Monetary Policymakers, . . . 
 The appropriate monetary policy response 
would also depend on the degree of policy 
credibility. The higher the inflation-fighting 
credibility of the central bank, the more likely it is 
that inflation expectations will remain contained, 
and the easier it will be to bring inflation down. 
Several central banks in Europe, including the 
European Central Bank, have tightened policy 
over the last year to signal commitment to their 

inflation targets. For some emerging economies, 
EUROPE: COPING WITH HIGH COMMODITY PRICES 
31which are showing signs of overheating and where 
policymakers™ credibility is still being established, 
monetary policy may have to tighten further. 
 After the experience of the 1970s, monetary 
policymakers have come to realize that a rise in 
commodity prices driven by a reduction in supply 
reduces the productive capacity of the economy. 
This leads to a temporary moderation of real 
growth rates, and attempts to stimulate the 
economy to maintain high growth rates only 
intensify the upward pressure on inflation. The 
effect of such a policy error is illustrated in 

Figure 20 (the dashed line). In this simulation, 
policymakers continue to target a high growth 
rate, without realizing that the level of potential 
output has declined. In this case, the initial 
monetary policy stance is overly expansionary, and 
the spike in inflation is higher and more persistent 
than in the baseline case.
21 In practice, estimating the reduction in 

potential output associated with the energy price 
shock is subject to methodological challenges and 
data problems. IMF staff analysis suggests that the 
2007Œ08 increase in oil prices could reduce the 
level of potential output in the European 
economies by about ½ to ¾ percentage point
_______ 
21 In the simulation, policymakers understand their mistake 
after two years and correct their policy response. Since the 
model assumes rational expectations, anchored on the 
inflation target, there is no substantial cost in terms of lost 
output. In the real world, there is an added complicationŠ
once inflation expectations move above the target and the 
central bank credibility diminishes, it becomes very costly to 

reduce inflation.

32 (Box 7). To avoid overheating, policymakers, 
especially in some emerging economies, should 
resist the temptation to maintain the exceptionally 
high growth rates seen in recent years. This is of 
particular importance at present because the 
current commodity price boom, unlike the 1970s 
boom, is driven by a combination of oil supply 
constraints and excess demand. The following 
section explains why the source of the energy 
imbalance matters.  
. . . and on the Source of Oil Price 
Pressures  
 Does the source of the energy market 
imbalanceŠexcess global demand or limited 
supplyŠmatter for the effects of the oil price 
shock on inflation and the real economy? To 
answer this question, two simulations are 
conducted using the IMF™s Global Economy 
Model, calibrated on the euro area. In the first 
one, the increase in oil prices is driven by a 
reduction in oil supply capacity. In the second, 
productivity increases in emerging economies raise 
global demand and the price of oil. The results 
illustrate the difference in economic outcomes, 
depending on the source of the imbalance, and the 
appropriate policy responses (Box 8). 
 If energy prices rise because of a reduction in 
oil supply, there is an unambiguous reduction in 
the productive potential of the world economy. As 
long as labor markets are flexible and workers 
accept a one-off reduction in their real wages to 
match the decline in labor productivity, relative 
prices will adjust quickly and the rise in inflation 

will be temporary. However, if the energy price 
increase is driven by rising productivity in 
emerging markets, the long-run effects will be 
different. The euro area will experience rising 
demand for exports and an increase in the relative 
price of its exports, which would offset, at least to 
some extent, the negative output effects of the oil 
price increase. Rising global demand will trigger a 
rise in domestic wages and exert upward pressure 

on inflation. In the second scenario, interest rates 
need to remain elevated for an extended period to 
bring inflation down.   
 During the current boom, both supply and 
demand factors have contributed to the rise in 
energy prices. The above analysis suggests that 
monetary policy authorities in Europe need to be 
even more vigilant about the inflationary 

consequences of commodity price increases if 
higher productivity in the emerging economies is 
an important cause of the rise in energy prices. If 
policymakers treat the commodity price surge as 
driven only by a reduction in oil supply capacity, 
they will amplify inflationary pressures.  
Policy Conclusions 
 Will the boom in commodity prices lead to a 

sustained increase in inflation in Europe? For 
advanced economies, the empirical findings of this 

chapter give ground for cautious optimism. In 
contrast to the 1970s, energy price shocks over the 
last two decades have not had a significant effect 
on core inflation. Though rigidities remain, 
improved labor market flexibility, strong monetary 
policy credibility, and the weakening economy 
should help limit second-round effects. However, 
the pass-through to core inflation may still 
surprise on the upside. When choosing the 

optimal monetary policy stance, policymakers in 
advanced economies will have to continue to 
balance carefully the upside risks to the inflation 
outlook against the disinflationary impact of 
decelerating activity.  In emerging economies, where food accounts 
for up to half of the consumption basket, 
concurrent large increases in food prices have a 
greater potential to aff
ect inflation perceptions 
and feed into core inflation. Therefore, in the 
countries where the commo
dity price shocks are 
coming on top of existing price pressures from 
overheating, and where monetary policy credibility 
is still being established, a tighter monetary policy 
stance may be justified. In the countries where 

economic activity is decelerating, but inflation 
EUROPE: COPING WITH HIGH COMMODITY PRICES 
33Box 7. Impact of High Oil Prices on Potential Output in Europe 
A key consideration for policymakers in their response to oil 
price shocks is the extent to which such shocks affect the 
supply capacity of the economy. Even though oil intensity 
of production has fallen in Europe in recent decades 
(first figure), a panel VAR, production function estimates, 
and simulations of an empirical growth model for net oil-
importing European countries indicate that the 2007Œ08 
increase in oil prices could reduce the level of potential 
output by about ½ to ¾ percent.  
Time-Series Evidence  
The medium-term impact of oil prices changes on real 
output in advanced economies is estimated through a panel 
VAR.1 The model is estimated separately for the periods 
1960Œ83 and 1984Œ2007, following Blanchard and Gali 
(2007), who find the impact of oil price on U.S. output to be 
considerably larger in the first period. The results for the 
period 1960Œ83 show that an increase in the oil price of one 
standard deviation ($12.20) leads to a decline in real GDP of 1.3 percent in the medium term. However, an increase in 
the oil price of one standard deviation in the period 1984Œ2007 ($15.40) leads to a decline in real GDP of only about 
0.25 percent (second figure). Therefore, the negative impact of oil on output has been considerably smaller in recent 
decades (and is not statistically significant). These estima
tes suggest that the 2007Œ08 oil price increase could reduce 
real GDP by 0.8 percent in the medium term, in the worst case scenario.

Evidence from a Production Function and a Cross-Country Panel 
Estimates from a production function for all European economies with positive net imports of oil suggest that 
the recent increase in the price of oil ($36 a barrel in 2008) could reduce real GDP growth by an annual average 
of 0.2 percentage point in the next four years, equally in advanced and emerging economies (first column of 
table).
2 The results are sensitive to the assumption for the oil price elasticity. The table includes the midpoint of 
a range of possible estimates.
3Estimates from an econometric 
growth model suggest that the 
recent oil price increase will reduce 
growth in oil-importing European 
economies by an annual average of 
0.3 percentage point over the 
medium term. More specifically, 
the higher oil price projected for 
2006Œ104 could slow annual growth 
during this period by 0.2 percentage point in advanced oil-importing European economies and by 0.4 
percentage point in emerging economies.
5 These estimates are derived from a panel regression model, with fixed 
country effects, covering 77 oil-importing economies (European and non-European) from 1965 to 2005. The 
dependent variable is the average per capita real GDP growth. The list of independent variables includes the 
standard growth determinants found in the literature. In addition, the regression includes the price of oil, 
deflated by the U.S. consumer price index, and its interaction with the lagged net imports of oil barrels per 
thousands of real dollar GDP. The results are presented in the second column of the table.
62  Technology is assumed to be Cobb-Douglas with three factors, capital, labor, and oilŠand with constant 
returns to scale. The capital stock for advanced European economies is estimated using the perpetual inventory 
method. For emerging economies, the capital stock estimates are taken from the April 2008 
Regional Economic 
Outlook: Europe
, Chapter 3. The oil input in production is assumed to be equal to each country™s oil trade deficit 
in barrels. The income share of labor is as in the April 2008 
Regional Economic Outlook: Europe
, Chapter 3, or from 
Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004). The oil income share is calculated as the ratio of each country™s oil trade deficit 
in U.S. dollars divided by GDP in U.S. dollars. Based on the constant-returns-to-scale assumption, the capital 
income share is one minus the income shares of labor and oil.  
3  The estimates are the midpoint of two extreme scenarios: at one extreme, the country does not change its net 
imports of oil barrels in response to the increase in the price of oil, in which case its net oil importŒto-GDP 
ratio increases proportionally to the oil price increase; at the other extreme, the country keeps its GDP share of 
net oil imports constant, in which case its imports of oil 
barrels adjust fully to the oil price increase over the 
medium term. 
4  The oil price is assumed to average $89 during 2006Œ10, based on the latest WEO global assumptionsŠan 
increase of $55 in nominal terms, or 129 percent in real terms, compared with the previous five-year period. 
5  The estimates should be considered as the upper limit of a possible range, which will be falling as countries 
adjust to the price shock by reducing the oil intensity of their production.

35Box 8. Does the Driver of the Energy Imbalance Matter? 
To evaluate the role of different drivers of the ener
gy imbalance, this box conducts two simulations using 
the IMF™s Global Economy Model (GEM).
1 In the first one, the increase in oil prices is driven by a 
reduction in oil supply capacity. In the second, productivity increases in emerging economies raise global 
demand and the price of oil. 
In the first simulation, a permanent increase in the price of energy of about 50 percent is generated by 
restricting the supply of oil. The increase in the price of energy (an input in production) causes a permanent 
decline in real output of 1 percentage point, a reduction in the capital stock, a decline in the marginal 
product of labor, and, therefore, a reduction in the real wage (the solid line in the figure). Consumer price 
inflation increases modestly on impact and then returns to target within two years. Here, it is assumed that 
households accept without resistance the decline in the real wage. Therefore, the increase in energy costs is 
offset by lower real wages, and there are no second-round effects affecting consumer price inflation. Under 
these assumptions, the monetary authorities can afford to accommodate the temporary increase in headline 
inflation, and real interest rates remain broadly unchanged.

1  The GEM is a large macroeconomic model, augmented with an energy sector. A two-country version of 
the model is constructed, representing the euro area and the rest of the world. The euro area is a net 
importer of energy. Energy is produced with a fixed factor (land), labor, and capital, and can be used both as 
an intermediate input in production and as a final consumption good. For a general description of the GEM, 
see Laxton and Pesenti (2003). Hunt (2006) describes the incorporation of energy into the GEM. This 
simulation is based on the euro area calibration of the model used in Bebee and Hunt (2008).

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
36Box 8 (concluded)
In the second simulation, a similar increase in the price of energy is achieved by assuming rising tradable 
sector productivity growth in the rest of the world. This captures the idea that fast growth in emerging Asia 
has been important in driving up energy demand and energy prices. Rising productivity in the tradable sector 
abroad will lower prices of tradable goods imported by the euro area. The positive terms of trade effect of 
falling non-energy prices will offset the negative impact of higher energy prices on domestic output growth. 
In addition, rising incomes abroad will increase demand for euro area exports. The euro area exchange rate 
will depreciate (a Balassa-Samuelson effect), further stimulating exports. In this case, the decline in real GDP 
is only temporary. As exports pick up and the terms of trade improve, GDP recovers, rising above the 
baseline in the long run.
2In contrast to the first simulation, the rise of inflation is very persistent in the second simulation. This 
phenomenon reflects the recovery in real wages and increased demand pressures, driven by rising export 
demand and the wealth effect from an improvement in the terms of trade. In this scenario, interest rates 
must remain elevated for an extended period to contain the inflationary pressures. 
2  The precise magnitude of the positive effect will depend on the direct trade linkages between the euro area 
and the fast-growing emerging economies. A number of other factors will also affect the economic outcome 
in reality. The policy of energy price controls in some large emerging markets does not allow the higher 
international price of energy to mitigate demand in these economies. This situation would keep oil prices 
higher than in the absence of such a policy. The policy of fixing the exchange rate to the dollar that some 
emerging markets and oil exporters follow could also delay economic adjustment and reduce the magnitude 
of the effects described above. 
remains high, policymakers should resist pressure 
to maintain the recent high growth rates. In some 
emerging economies with fixed exchange rates, 
maintaining a tight fiscal policy stance may be 

warranted to prevent second-round effects.  
 In both advanced and emerging economies, 
fiscal and structural policies should aim to ease 
supply bottlenecks and provide the right 
incentives to producers and consumers. Universal 
subsidies and commodity tax reductions may 

entail fiscal costsŠwith the benefits accruing 
primarily to the higher-income householdsŠand 
provide distorted price signals, which could 
ultimately reinforce global price pressures. 
Recognizing the drawbacks of this type of 
measures, last June EU member countries  
confirmed the 2005 Manchester agreementŠ
which called for avoiding the use of distorting 
fiscal and other policiesŠand expressed support 
for temporary and well-targeted actions.  
 Some countries have imposed export 
restrictions or price caps to keep food prices low. 
Such policies should be avoided as they discourage 
farmers from expanding agricultural production in 
response to rising world prices. In contrast, tariff 
reductions can help by reducing trade distortions 

and mitigating price increases. Also, countries with 
restrictions on the use of land for agriculture 
should consider taking measures to ease them. 
Finally, domestic competition could be promoted 
to increase supply and ease price pressures.  
373. The European Credit Cycle: Diverging Patterns 
 Differences in country-specific financing conditions may 
account for a dispersion of responses to a turnaround in the 

credit cycle across Europe. Moreover, by reinforcing the role of 
financial assets as borrowing collaterals, developments in 
national housing and corporate finance systems have the 
potential to make bank lending procyclical. In this way, the 
financial sector can amplify business cycle fluctuations as well 
as the impact of monetary policy shocks and asset price 
movements on real activity. Cross-border ownership of assets 
further bolsters this mechanism. By affecting the behavior of 
banks™ capital buffers over the cycle, banking regulation might 
have some role to play in mitigating procyclical swings in 
domestic credit conditions and,
 thereby, in lessening 
macroeconomic volatility.
*Overview 
 The ongoing financial market turmoil has drawn 

considerable attention to the impact of a tightening 
in financial conditions on real activity in European 
economies and on cross-border financial linkages.
22From a theoretical perspective, two stylized facts 

appear to be widely recognized. First, financial 

systems are inherently subject to cyclesŠwith 
growth in lending, leverage, and asset prices often 
magnifying underlying economic dynamicsŠ
leading, at times, to a buildup of financial 
imbalances followed by sharp corrections. Second, 
financial cycles can, in turn, have an impact on the 
macroeconomy both by affecting lenders™ capital 
adequacyŠand, hence, their ability to extend 
loansŠand by altering asset prices and value of 

collaterals, thereby impinging on borrowers™

creditworthiness and their ability to borrow.
23 From 
a policy viewpoint, the recent distress in the financial 

system has required regulators and policymakers to 
devise new ways of containing systemic risks and 
lessening the likelihood of boom-bust episodes in 
the future.
24 Against such a background, this chapter evaluates 
the responses of individual (advanced and emerging) 

European economies to changes in asset prices and 
credit supply and examines how differences in 
national financing conditions may account for the 
dispersion in their responses. Specifically, answers 
are sought to the following questions: (1) to what 
extent have financing conditions affected growth in 
European countries over the latest credit cycle? (2) 
what drives divergences in the strength and in the 
timing of macrofinancial linkages across European 

countries? (3) which European countries are more 
susceptible to a turnaround in the credit cycle and 
asset prices? (4) how can policy contribute to 
mitigating the effects of boom-bust dynamics? (5) in 
which European economies are such stabilization 
policies most needed? and (6) howŠand to what 
extentŠdo cross-country spillovers complicate this 
picture?  
 The evolution of financial positions in European 
Union (EU) countries over the latest credit 
expansion and the macroeconomic impact of 
financial conditions among selected European 
economies since 1999 offer a broad view of the 
mechanisms through which financial shocks affect 
Europe™s macroeconomic stabilityŠthe so-called 

macrofinancial linkages. In the process, the chapter

was first singled out by Bernanke and Gertler (1989), and later 
developed by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) and Bernanke, Gertler, 
and Gilchrist (1999). A well-known exposition of the procyclical 
feature of financial systems is Minsky™s financial instability 
hypothesis (Minsky, 1992).

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
38provides an overview of the state of household and 
firm balance sheets, the dynamics of credit and asset 
prices over the business cycle, and the importance of 
financial spillovers across Europe. Calibrated 
simulations provide a first gauge of the effectiveness 
of policies aimed at smoothing the cyclical pattern 
of lending standards. The key findings are as 
follows: 
First, the latest credit expansion had a very 
limited impact on the growth of the advanced 
economies of Europe as a whole, while 
contributing substantially to the growth of 

emerging European economies. Within these 
country groups, the dispersion of performance 
was considerable, both across countries and 

across sectors. With the economic effects of a 

downturn in the credit cycle still playing out, 
such a dispersion is expected to remain wide, if 
not widen further. 
Second, cross-country divergences in 
households™ borrowing/saving decisions over the 
cycle appear to be strictly related to domestic 
mortgage market characteristics: in countries 
where the loan-to-value (LTV) ratios are high, 

the level of mortgage debt relative to GDP also 
tends to be high, while consumption is likely to 
be more volatile and more sensitive to underlying 

financial shocks. 
Third, the stringency of co
llateral constraints in 
bank lending seems to have a bearing on cross-

country dissimilarities in debt and investment 
dynamics in the corporate sector. In this context, 

in economies with more rationed access to 

credit, equity prices are found to be more 
sensitive to underlying changes in fundamentals. 
This greater sensitivity is likely to induce higher 

volatility to investment, debt, and the current 
account balance. Fourth, country-specific financial condition 
indices for the corporate sector reveal important 
divergences in the timing and the strength of 

macrofinancial linkages across European 
countries. Possibly more interestingly, country-
specific financial condition indices provide a 
clear picture of the extent to which bank lending 
to the corporate sector tends to be procyclical. 
Fifth, a cross-country scrutiny shows that the 
responsiveness of credit growth to changes in 
asset prices is positively related to the degree of 
procyclicality in corporate leverage. In turn, 

procyclicality in lending tends to increase the 
volatility of capital accumulation. This 
relationship implies that, wherever credit 

conditions are more likely to co-move with the 

cycle, credit availability becomes more sensitive 
to variations in equity pricesŠand boom-bust 
dynamics are thereby magnified. 
Sixth, a reduction in the procyclicality of bank 
lending following, for example, the introduction 
of a countercyclical element into banks™ 
regulatory provisions, is found to substantially 
reduce the volatility of investment of financially 

integrated economies. In particular, stability gains 
appear to become more important in economies 
that are more financially constrained. 
Finally, greater financial integration and the 
increasing prevalence of cross-border ownership 
of assets are found to be associated with better 
growth opportunities, with the link stronger in 
countries where integration 
is faster. At the same 
time, though, these developments in 

international financial markets have the potential 
to further amplify business cycle fluctuations and 
the impact of asset price movements on real 

activity by increasing the strength of cross-
border financial spillovers.  
All in all, this chapter points to the perils of 
procyclicality in bank lending in a number of 
European countries, while suggesting that banking 

regulation might have some ro
le to play in mitigating 
procyclical swings in credit conditions by affecting 
the behavior of banks™ capital buffers over the cycle, 
particularly in financially integrated economies with 
tighter borrowing limits. The analysis also suggests 
that financial integration and adequate coordination 
of financial policies across Europe, and especially 

within the European Monetary Union, are essential 
to foster smooth and growth-oriented adjustment. It

39also underscores the need for supervision to keep 
pace with increasingly complex linkages across 
borders. 
Vulnerability to Changes in 
Financial Conditions 
 According to the so-called financial accelerator 
mechanism, a credit cycle is set in motion by any 

shockŠfrom monetary policy, financial 
liberalization, or technologyŠthat pushes asset 
prices up. This financial cycle then tends to get 
amplified over time: as asset price gains drive the 
value of borrowers™ collateral up and as banks™ 
capital positions improve (with fewer defaults and 
delinquencies), banks are willing to supply more 
credit and households and corporates are willing to 
borrow more (as rising asset prices and improving 

business conditions increase their perception of net 
worth). The recent credit
 cycleŠin Europe as 
elsewhereŠwas mainly driven by a low interest rate 
environment and by developments in mortgage 
market securitization, although these effects were 
probably magnified by investor complacency (see 
Box 9). 
 Although bank balance sheets have continued to 
expand over recent months and bank lending to 
euro area nonfinancial corporations has so far 
remained strongŠreaching a record nominal annual 
growth rate of 15 percent in March 2008 (see 
Chapter 1, Figure 5)Šthe credit cycle seems to have 
turned in most advanced and emerging European 
economies. Higher borrowing costs, tighter bank 

lending standards, and the effective closing of some 
credit market segments are all evidence of this 
turn.25 Data also confirm a gradual moderation in house 
price inflation that is broadly based, notwithstanding 
a certain degree of heterogeneity across countries.
26_______ 
25 On these points see, among others, IMF (2008c), IMF 
(2008a), and European Central Bank (2008). 
26 In particular, in the United Kingdom and in Ireland house 
prices have dropped quite sharply over the past few months. In 

Belgium, Spain, France, and Italy, property prices have 
(continued) 
As a result of these developments, lending growth is 
expected to slow across the board over the coming 
months, with due allowance for some lags owing to 
the average maturity of precommitted credit 
agreements.  
 To what extent have financing conditions 
affected growth in European countries over the 

latest credit cycle? Which economies are more 
susceptible to a turnaround in the credit cycle and 
asset prices? An economy™s vulnerability to a turn in 
the credit cycle largely depends on the degree of 
overextension of household and corporate balance 
sheets, the stock of outstanding debt, and the extent 
of overvaluation in asset prices.
27 If corporates or 
households are running large financial deficits, when 
corrections in asset prices startŠand banks begin to 

respond to collateral valuations and to their own 
capital positions by rationing the availability of 
creditŠthen there is no alternative to a cutback in 
private sector spending. As a result, absolute 
declines in asset prices, in the stock of outstanding 
debt, and in real activity are likely to ensue. 
 A simple (and admittedly imprecise) way to gauge 
the impact of credit conditions on individual 
European economies would thus be to look at the 
evolution of their household and corporate financial 
positions over the latest credit expansion.
28 Indeed, 
if saving rates were mean reverting and initial 
financial positions were at equilibrium, then the 
__________________________________________ 
continued on a path of gradual deceleration, while in the 
Netherlands and Austria house price increases in the first half of 
2007 were roughly unchanged compared with the increases 
recorded in 2006 (European Central Bank, 2008). 
27 For an assessment of house price developments across 
Europe, see also Box 1.2 in IMF (2008a) and Hilbers and others 
(forthcoming). 
28 This approach is based on some simplifying assumptions. By 
deriving the impact of credit expansion on growth as the sum of 
changes in the financial positions of households and 
nonfinancial corporates, this assessment implicitly rules out any 
accelerator mechanism in the economy, thereby underestimating 
the actual impact of credit growth. On the other hand, this 
approach also implies that the total flow of dividends (which are 
deducted from corporate income before the financial position is 
calculated) is paid out to the householdsŠan assumption that 
might exaggerate the impact of credit growth if, instead, not all 

dividends have boosted household incomes. 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
40Box 9. European Securitization and the Possible Revival of Financial Innovation 
Collapsing global securitization volumes in the wake of the subprime crisis have raised fundamental questions over the 
viability of the originate-to-distribute (O2D) business model.
1 Issuance has dropped precipitously in both Europe and 
the United States, with banks keeping more loans on their balance sheets and tightening lending standards as a result 
(first figure). The decline has been particularly sharp for mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and MBS-backed 
collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The O2D model was thought to have made the financial system more resilient 
by dispersing credit risk to a broad range of investors. Ironically, however, the O2D model itself became the source of 
financial instability. 
Mortgages constituted the vast majority of loans securitized in Europe in 2006Œ07. Of these, about 54 percent were 
originated in the United Kingdom; Spain (14 percent) and the Netherlands (11 percent) followed. Total European MBS 
issuance dropped from •307 billion in 2007 to •28 billion in the first quarter of 2008. During the same period, CDO 
issuance plummeted from •471 billion to •63 billion, and asset-backed securities (ABS) issuance
2 dropped from about 
•124 billion in 2007 to •9 billion in the first half of 2008. 
What Went Wrong? 
In many cases, the risk transfer from securitization proved to be less complete than believed, and investors to whom 
risks were transferred were too complacent. The adoption of new international financial accounting standards in Europe 
forced the recognition on the balance sheet of substantial securitization volumes (IMF, 2008b, Box 1.3). Also, the 
efficacy of some risk transfers (e.g., to asset-backed commercial paper conduits and structured investment vehicles) 
relied on market liquidity, which broke down in 2007. As a result, banks have had to take back onto their balance sheets 
assets they had earlier securitized. Some banks also retained supposedly lower-risk CDO and MBS tranches, but have 
been forced to drastically write down these holdings as their market values have fallen and bond insurers have been 
downgraded.

THE EUROPEAN CREDIT CYCLE: DIVERGING PATTERNS 
41Investor complacency resulted in overreliance on credit ratings. Furthermore, the rating agencies™ key 
assumptions on some risks (e.g., subprime mortgage delinquencies and recovery rates) turned out to be overly 
optimistic. As credit fundamentals deteriorated, many of the more complex and multilayered securities became 
nearly impossible to value, and market liquidity disappeared as leveraged investors (primarily hedge funds) 
reduced their exposures. The disappearance of market liquidity and the reliance on models for valuations 
triggered uncertainty about losses and loss exposures. The interaction of credit and liquidity risk drove market 
valuations into downward spirals of mark
-to-market losses and forced liquidations. 
Road to Recovery 
Reviving securitization requires structural change. Investor confidence in the instruments, the originators, and 
the rating agencies needs to be restored. Originators will have to simplify security structures and improve the 
disclosure of their underlying assets in a timely and comprehensive manner. Rating agencies will need to provide 
more information on the models and inputs that underpin their ratings and on the potential for rating volatility. 
The American and European Securitization Forums are engaged in coordinating standardized reporting and 
originator principles. This process will take many years. Also, the major rating agencies are consulting over 
whether to supplement rating letter grades with rating vo
latility and loss sensitivity metrics. However, they have 
been slow to address the conflict of interest that arises because of their parallel activities as consultancy services.
It has been proposed that originators in Europe retain some meaningful economic interest in the underlying 
securities, so that their incentives can be more closely aligned with those of investors. A European Commission 
proposal regarding implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive suggests requiring minimum levels of 
originator risk retention. However, this proposal could easily make securitization uneconomic for originators 
and faces considerable monitoring and enforcement difficulties. It is, therefore, unlikely to restart the market. 
Covered Bonds 
In Europe, covered bonds have provided banks with cost-efficient secured financing for over 200 years, and 
U.S. authorities recently launched an initiative to encourage their use by U.S. banks. Covered bonds are backed 
by identifiable and legally ﬁring-fencedﬂ pools of loans. They remain on the balance sheet, however, so that the 
bank retains the ultimate credit risk and is encouraged to maintain loan quality. Nevertheless, yield spreads on 
U.K. and Spanish covered bonds have widened sharply during the crisis owing to declining housing markets.

Meanwhile, German and French spreads have remained relatively low (second figure). Although secondary market 
liquidity has dried up, issuance of ﬁjumboﬂ bonds is continuing; however, these are mostly German Pfandbriefe. 
Covered bond issuance is expected to remain below trend for some time, but the market is likely to continue 
broadening. The first Greek covered bond issue is expected in 2008, and the four largest U.S. banks have 
committed to issuing covered bonds, while an electronic trading platform in Europe is planned. The covered bond 
market has not been immune from recent turbulence, but it does provide a less complex alternative to outright 
securitization. 
Conclusion 
The risk transfer and capital saving benefits of securitization, combined with underlying investor demand for 
securities, should eventually revive issuance. But the products are likely to be simpler and more transparent, and 
trade at significantly wider spreads. 
ultimate dampening effect of a turn in the credit 
cycle might be the reverse of what happened in 
the upswing. However, in the current 
environmentŠwith the ongoing sharp repricing in 
credit riskŠthe downturn of the credit cycle is 

likely to be much more abrupt than the upswing.  
 Recent balance sheet data for EU countries 
indicate that, for advanced economies as a whole, 
the credit expansion had virtually no impact on 
growth over the latest cycle.
29 However, it contributed substantially to the (nominal) growth 

of emerging economies, where corporates and 
households were running large financial deficits, 
averagingŠon aggregateŠaround 7 and 4 percent 
of nominal GDP, respectively. Such a general 
picture masks a significant dispersion of 
performance across countries (Figure 21). For 
example, credit expansion had essentially no 
impact in Germany and PolandŠwhere 
household and corporate savings actually 

increased over the periodŠbut it had a much 
larger impact, say, on the Spanish and Baltic 
economies, where the overextension of both

household and corporate balance sheets was 
considerable. More generally, euro area household 
savings actually increased during the credit 
expansion (by almost 3 percent), more than 
offsetting the surge in the financial deficit of the 

euro area corporate sector (about 2 percent).
30 In nonŒeuro area advanced economies, the impact of 
the credit expansion was largely neutral, with small 
(about 1 percent) corporate financial surpluses 
compensating for household financial deficits of 
similar magnitude. Overall, more developed credit 
markets (like the Netherlands, Finland, the United 
Kingdom, and Denmark) were featuring 
significant deficits in household financial 

positions, while exhibiting strong corporate 
balance sheet positions.
_______ 
30 Although euro area household sector indebtedness has 
continued to increase over recent years, the overall 
assessment of household sector balance sheets as a potential 
source of risk from a financial stability perspective is still one 
of ongoing strength. Vulnerabilities may be growing for 
households in those parts of the euro area where the debt 
buildup has been most pronounced, where the majority of 
debt is financed at variable interest rates, and where housing 
valuations appear tight. On the other hand, euro area firms™ 
leverage has increased since 2005, fueled by improved 

investment opportunities and favorable financing conditions. 
Firms™ reliance on bank lending accounted for around 85 
percent of the total debt of euro area firms in 2006 and is 

likely to have further increased as a result of ongoing stress in 
corporate bond markets. The gradual move of firms toward 
holding more debt has certainly made them more vulnerable 

to adverse shocks (European Central Bank, 2008). 
THE EUROPEAN CREDIT CYCLE: DIVERGING PATTERNS 
43 Altogether, the impact for advanced economies 
in Europe is likely to be more contained than in 
previous credit downturnsŠeven with 

nonnegligible asymmetries within the region. 
Although asset prices have risen, the cumulative 
gain over recent years looks modest, especially if 
compared with the experiences of those countries 
in the second half of the 1980s.
31 Meanwhile, households are still running sizable financial 
surpluses in the euro area and modest deficits in 
nonŒeuro area advanced economies, with the 
opposite holding true for the corporate sector. 

Hence, while the credit cycle will no doubt be a 
dampening factorŠand severely so in some 
countriesŠit is unlikely to weigh substantially on 
growth in the aggregate 
of advanced European 
economies, partly because Germany did not 
participate in the upswing of the credit cycle.  
 However, the same benign conclusion cannot 
be reached for emerging Europe, even if 
dispersion in performance remains wide in this 
region too. Recent flows of borrowing by 
households and corporates (Figure 21), recent 
debt accumulation (Figure 22), and recent gains in 
asset prices (Figure 23) in some of the emerging 
European economiesŠsuch as the BalticsŠrecall

THE EUROPEAN CREDIT CYCLE: DIVERGING PATTERNS 
45valuation rules and special investor protection 
diminish the risks of European mortgage-covered 
bond markets, while allowing lenders to obtain 
comparatively cheap funds in capital markets and 
to benefit from lower regulatory risk weightings. 
  However, this general picture masks significant 
heterogeneity in the institutional characteristics of 
national mortgage markets across (both advanced 
and emerging) European economies (Box 10). 
With the intention of identifying clusters of 
countries on the basis of shared characteristics of 
their mortgage markets, a number of empirical 
studies tend to concur that, in economies where 
LTV ratios are high, the level of mortgage debt 
relative to GDP also tends to be high. In countries 

where households are able to borrow more easily 
against their housing wealth, elevated LTV ratios 
and relatively large mortgage debts are generally 
accompanied by longer contract durations and 
more widespread home equity release.
34 The correlation between private consumption 

and house price fluctuations over the cycle is 
found to be related to mortgage market 
characteristics, with that 
correlation larger in those 
countries where mortgage refinancing is feasible 
_______ 
34 For an extensive survey of the literature on housing 
financing and its business cycle implications, see IMF (2008f) 

and references therein. 
and variable rate contra
cts are more common. In 
addition, the size of the peak effect of a monetary 
policy shock on consumption and real house 
prices appears to be positively related to the 
mortgage debtŒto-GDP ratio, the LTV ratio, and 
the existence of equity release products. The 
evidence that private consumption is more 
responsive to monetary impulses in economies 
with more
 developed mortgage markets is due to 
the presence of collateralized borrowing, as 
private borrowing is constrained by the value of 
the collateral. That value is endogenously tied to 
the evolution of the nominal price of housing. 
Thus, in a context where housing credit markets 
can more easily convert asset values into 
borrowing and, therefore, spending, consumption 
is likely to be more sensitive to underlying 
financial shocks (Figure 24). 
. . . and in the Corporate Sector 
 Do similar conclusions hold true with respect 
to the relationship between private investment and 
equity price fluctuations over the cycle? Does the 

responsiveness of capital accumulation to shifts in 
credit conditions and asset prices differ on a 
country-by-country basis, depending on the level 
of development of each country™s corporate 
finance market? Given the remarkable importance

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
46Box 10. Institutional Features of Mortgage Markets in Europe 
Mortgage markets differ significantly across European countries in terms of both size and key institutional 
characteristics, such as the prevailing contractual arrangements and the available product range; these differences 
largely reflect national traditions and cultural factors, as well as the institutional settings of the local banking sector. 
The table summarizes some of the institutional indicators that have been identified in the literature as most likely to 
have a bearing on the relationship between housing wealth and consumption, as well as on the channels of 
monetary policy transmission.
 1The indicators included in the table are (1) average cost and time of mortgage enforcement procedures; (2) 
maximum LTV ratio; (3) typical mortgage contract duration;
 (4) type of interest rate structure; (5) diffusion of 
home equity release products; and (6) securitization.  
Cross-country heterogeneity is pervasive in all indicators considered. In particular, LTV ratios vary significantly 
across countries, ranging between 50 percent in Italy and over 110 percent in the Netherlands. Overall, it is now 
typical for borrowers to have available loans worth 70Œ80 percent of the house value. Cross-country variations in 
these ratios partly reflect differences in legal and regulato
ry frameworks. The heterogeneity in terms of interest rate 
adjustment is also substantial across countries. Among th
e EU countries, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Ireland 
mainly have variable or adjustable ra
te mortgages. In contrast, Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, and 
the Netherlands are mainly characterized by fixed rate mortgages.  
Many of the mortgages offered in eastern Europe are foreign currency loans, and their increasing popularityŠ
because their interest rates are lower than domestic currency mortgagesŠhas brought even more dramatic 
convergence in the nominal interest rate on debt between eastern and western Europe. For example, Latvian and 
Polish mortgage rates are just over 1 percent above their German equivalent. In Poland, mortgage lending 
denominated in foreign currency accounted for approximately 60 percent of the stock of mortgages by mid-2005. 
Lending in foreign currency has also been rising very rapidly in Hungary, and reached almost 30 percent of the 
stock of lending by early 2006, up from only 1 percent in 2003. The overwhelming majority of new mortgages in 
Hungary have recently been in foreign currencyŠoften denominated in Swiss francs.  
Finally, an important element of divergence among national mortgage markets is the extent of recourse to home 
equity release. Following changes in house prices and mortgage interest rates, collateral-constrained agents can 
adjust their net borrowing positions or refinance the term
s of their existing mortgages according to the changed 
conditions. For instance, following rises in house prices, borrowers may increase the amount of their mortgage 
loans or apply for a second mortgage against the increased value of their collateral. The released mortgage equity 
may subsequently be used for a variety of purposes, such as debt refinancing, acquisition of durable goods, 
purchase of financial assets, or home improvements. When mortgage interest rates decrease, agents may be willing 
to refinance their mortgages to take advantage of lower interest payments, to free liquidity for other expenditures; 
alternatively, they may want to increase their borrowing to reflect their increased debt-servicing capacity.  
Overall, the use of home equity release remains limited in most countries, though mortgage equity extraction and 
refinancing have become significant at the aggregate level in a few (e.g., the United Kingdom and the Netherlands). 
In some cases, the limited recourse to home equity release may reflect scarce availability of suitable mortgage 
contracts (e.g., owing to regulatory constraints). However, in most countries borrowers are deterred from 
refinancing their contracts by administrative obstacles and prohibitive transaction costs. In such countries, 
mortgage lending is likely to interact with interest rate and house price developments only to a very limited extent 
(namely, for the new mortgage contracts only and not for the existing ones, which mostly reflect the market 
conditions prevailing at the time they were signed rather than current conditions).

of bank lending for European corporate financing 
(see footnote 30) and the extent of cross-country 
divergences in corporate financial positions, these 

questions are of considerable relevance. In order 
to address these issues, a macroeconomic model 
of a stylized two-country economy is developed to 
illustrate how the double role of equitiesŠas 
collateral in the (international) lending process and 
as value of the capital used for productionŠmay 
affect the volatility of 
investment, corporate debt, 
and the current account.
35 This model captures the 
idea that observed cross-country differences in 

investment and current account dynamics may be 
consistent with the fact that lending conditions 
and discount factors are not symmetric across 
countries. This is achieved by assuming that in 
one of the two economies agents are credit 
constrained and ﬁimpatientﬂ: that is, they do not 
smooth consumption based on permanent 
income, but have preferences tilted toward current 
consumption. Their access to credit on 

international financial markets is constrained by

the value of their collateral, which is endogenously 
tied to the evolution of equity prices.
36 A more developed financial market is represented by a 

higher borrowing limit (LTV = 0.7)Ša parameter 
that determines the extent to which capital can be 
used as collateral for borrowing to invest and to 
produce goods. Despite its stylized nature, this 
structural model is consistent with the empirical 
findings that investment and current account 
dynamics are more responsive to changes in 
financial conditions in economies with 
less
developed corporate financing. In economies with
_______ 
36 Thus, firms can borrow up to a fraction of the market 
value of their capital. This constraint resembles a debt 
contract with a margin clause (on this point, see also 

Mendoza, 2006). Margin clauses typically require borrowers 
to surrender the control of collateral assets when the debt 
contract is entered and give creditors the right to sell the 

assets when their market value falls below the contract value. 
There are also other arrangements that operate in a similar 
way. These include value-at-risk strategies of portfolio risk 
management used by investment banks and capital 
requirements imposed by regulators on financial institutions. 
In both cases, if an aggregate shock hits the asset value, banks 
are required to reduce their corresponding exposure; 
however, since the shock is aggregate, the resulting sale of 
assets increases price volatility, thereby requiring further 

portfolio adjustments.

49lower borrowing limits (LTV = 0.4)Šas equity 
prices have fallen following either a technology 
shock or an exogenous tightening to the lending 
standardŠimpatient agents see their borrowing 
curtailed more against the declining value of their 

collateral, and are thus able to borrow less against 
collateral for any given value of their capital, 
compared with those in economies with higher 
borrowing limits (Figure 25). Although the model 
is highly stylizedŠabstracting from many factors 
affecting monetary policy decisionsŠthe exercise 
is nevertheless instructive: it provides some insight 
into how macroeconomic volatility varies 
according to the characteristics of financial 

markets in economies where firms™ borrowing 
limits are tied to collateral values and where agents 
do not behave in the farsighted way that is more 
traditionally supposed.  
From Financial Conditions to 
the Macroeconomy 
 To examine more closely the dynamic 
relationship between corporate financial 
conditions and real activity and to understand 
what drives divergences in the strength and in the 
timing of macrofinancial linkages across European 
countries, financial conditions indices (FCIs) for 
the corporate sector of 16 advanced and 
12 emerging European economies have been 

constructed by means of vector autoregression 
and impulse response functions (Figure 26 and 
Table 6). National FCIs are meant to account for 
the timing of transmission from financial markets 
to real activity and to incorporate the endogenous 
response of financial variables to the business

37 Allowing for these 
dynamic interrelations is important when 
attempting to disentangle the impact of multiple 
variables that are highly correlated.  
 For each economy, the estimated FCI contains 
statistically significant effects on GDP growth 
from shocks to domestic (real) credit growth, 
(real) equity prices, an
d (real) interest rates.
38_______ 
37 The construction of FCIs follows the methodology 
developed in Swiston (2008). 
38 By ruling out both direct and indirect effects of house price 
shocks on the corporate sector™s growth, the estimated FCIs 
are likely to forgo the impact of construction-driven 
boomsŠsuch as those recently experienced in Spain or 

Ireland. 
Specifically, impulse responses from these 
financial variables are combined with estimates of 
the shocks to each of these variables to calculate 
the total impulse to growth in a given month. As 
the FCI contains information from three financial 

shocks over a period of 12 months preceding the 
month in which GDP is measured, it also appears 
to be an important leading indicator of real GDP 
growth. Measurement of the FCI in terms of its 
contribution to growth means that both the level 
of the index and the direction of its changes have 
implications for economic activity. For example, a 
value of 1 means that the total impulse of financial 
conditions to GDP in a given quarter is 

1 percentage point, annualized. A decline from 1 
to ½ implies that financial conditions are expected

58to erode ½ percentage point from growth, 
although the total contribution to growth remains 
positive. In this way, it is possible to distinguish 
between tight financial conditions and a 
tightening
 in financial conditions that are, however, still 

accommodative. Estimated FCIs appear to account for a 
substantial portion of the variation in real GDP 
growth over the business cycle of almost all 
European countries in the sample (Figure 27). 
Turning to the role of individual financial 

variables, credit is foundŠamong the advanced 
economiesŠto have contributed substantially to 
annual growth in Austria (40 percent), Sweden 
(25 percent), and, to a lesser extent, the United 
Kingdom and Greece (10 percent). Changes in 
equity prices explain 40 percent of growth 
variation in Finland, France, and the Netherlands, 
while interest rate variations play an important 
role in Sweden and Denmark. Among emerging 

economies, financial conditions playŠoverallŠa 
much greater role. They account for over 70 
percent of growth variation in Hungary, Russia, 
Latvia, and Estonia, underscoring, once again, the 
vulnerability of these economies™ corporate sector 
to downswings in financing conditions.  
 Looking at the path of FCIs over time 
corroborates the view that, by end-2007, the 
financial cycle had already turned in most 
advanced European economies. However, 
financial conditions appear to be generally still 
accommodative in the region, with few exceptions 
(Figure 26). In emerging Europe, the tightening in 
credit conditions seemsŠon balanceŠto have 
started earlier, over the course of 2006, and to 
have already begun crunching into growth in a few 
countries. On the other handŠand in contrast to 
the prevailing trend in international credit 
marketsŠTurkey, Poland, and the Slovak 
Republic appear to enjoy rather favorable 
financing conditions, sustaining growth in these 
economies. Are country-specific financial conditions co-
moving with the cycle? In which countries are 
lending conditions more responsive to underlying 
shocks to asset prices? Once again, the answers 
vary on a country-by-country basis (Table 6). 
Some empirical regularities can, however, be 
identified. First, credit growth tends to be more 

sensitive to changes in asset prices in those 
economies where the firms™ leverage tend to co-
move more closely with the business cycle 
(Figure 28). Second, a higher degree of 
procyclicality in firms™ leverage seems to be 
associated with higher volatility in private 
investment (Figure 29). RemarkablyŠand in line 
with the findings of the theoretical model 
economy described aboveŠoversensitivity of 

credit availability to asset price changes, greater 
procyclicality in firms™ leverage, and higher 
investment volatility appear to be features mostly

59characterizing the least advanced financial markets 
in the sample. This finding corroborates the idea 
that, in a context in which firms™ financing 
conditions are more stringent, capital 
accumulationŠand, therefore, productionŠ
appears to be more responsive to the underlying 
financial shocks, which may affect the value of 
collaterals.  
Cross-Border Lending: Further 
Benefits and Risks 
 Financial systems in advanced and emerging 
economies of Europe have undergone remarkable 
changes over the past decade. Cross-border 
ownership of assets has increased, revealing not 

only important benefits associated with financial 
integration, but also new risks. 
 Greater financial integration has clearly shown 
its ability to disperse claims to a broader range of 
portfolios, so that risks are better spread. In 
particular, financial integration holds great 

potential to smooth incomes through cross-border 
asset diversification, and thus stabilize the 
economy in the face of asymmetric shocks. 
Empirical work on the United States estimates 
that two-fifths of the income effect from local 
shocks is smoothed away through asset holdings 
across state lines. A similar analysis for European 
countries shows that, since 1999, risk sharing has 
also begun to emerge across these economies, 
although the extent to which financial integration 
is able to insure incomes against country-specific 
shocks is still limited (with estimates below 10 

percent in all regions) and uneven across regions 
(Figure 30).39 Adjusting well to shocks means having a system 
that is not only resilient but also reallocates

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
60resources more efficiently across sectors and 
across firms, thereby fostering growth. Also, 
improved, risk-adjusted growth opportunities 
appear to be related to future advances in 
integration. This empirical regularity indicates that 
the countries whose integration has been faster 
benefit most from a virtuous dynamic in which 
financial integration and improved real prospects 
are mutually reinforcing. Europe is found to be 
the region that has benefited the most from such 

dynamics (see Box 11).  
 At the same time, though, financial integration 
poses new challenges to market investors and 
policymakers. Cross-border ownership of assets 
exposes financial institutions such as banks to 
macroeconomic, financial, and asset price 

fluctuations in the countries where they hold 
positions. Increasingly complex linkages across 
market segments and borders make the 
transmission of shocks in the international 
economy and the pattern of risk dispersion more 
opaque, creating uncertainty for agents and 
policymakers about where the ultimate risks lie. 
 In order to shed light on potential international 
spillovers and the feedback between the real and 
the financial sectors, it is crucial to look into the 
time profile of the cross-country transmission of 
financial shocks, while explicitly accounting for 
regional interdependencies.
40 In this perspective, 
country-specific vector 
error-correction models 
are estimated, where the domestic macroeconomic 

variables are related to the corresponding foreign 
variables constructed exclusively to match the 
international financial flows of the country under 
consideration. The individual country models are 
then combined consistently and cohesively to 
generate predictions for all the variables in the 
world economy simultaneously. The resulting 
global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model is 
_______ 
40 Model and estimation details underlying the assessment of 
regional financial spillovers across Europe are provided in 
Galesi and Sgherri (forthcoming). The GVAR methodology 
was originally developed by Pesaran, Schuermann, and 

Weiner (2004) and extended by Dees and others (2007). 
estimated for 28 European countries, grouped 
into 6 regions plus the United States, using 
monthly data on real GDP growth, real growth in 
credit to the corporate sector, real equity prices, 
and real interest rates from January 1999 to 
March 2008. Looking at generalized impulse response 
functions for an exogenous one-standard-error 
negative shock to U.S. equity prices (equivalent to 
a fall of around 4¼ percent in U.S. real equity 
prices, annualized) confirms the significant 
interdependence of international equity markets 
(with the exception of southeastern European 
markets) and strong financial co-movements 
between credit conditions in Baltic countries and 
non euroŒarea advanced economies (namely, 

Sweden). InterestinglyŠand consistent with 
results in previous sectionsŠempirical evidence 
from the GVAR seems to support the view of a 
decoupling between credit conditions in advanced 
economies and those in selected emerging 
European markets (e.g., Turkey and Russia) and 
central-eastern Europe, in the face of a common 
adverse shock stemming from U.S. financial 
markets (Figure 31). 
 How does the evidence of significant financial 
spillovers affect conclusions on macrofinancial 
linkages? Ultimately, does financial integration 
weaken or reinforce the relationship between the 
procyclicality of firms™ leverage and 
macroeconomic volatility? Using GVAR estimates 

for calibration purposes shows that significant 
financial cross-border spillovers have the potential 
to amplify the macroecono
mic effects of leverage 
procyclicality, though only marginally. In other 
words, all else being equal, an increase in the 
procyclicality of lending behavior might boost 
investment (and output) volatility even further in 
the presence of financial cross-border spillovers 
than it would do in their absence (Table 7).
THE EUROPEAN CREDIT CYCLE: DIVERGING PATTERNS 
61Box 11. Financial Integration and Grow
th: Are They Related, and How? 
Theory predicts that financial integration should bring about beneficial real effects resulting from a more 
efficient resource allocation. A recent IMF study finds that advances in financial integration are indeed 
associated with better growth opportunities, and the effect is stronger in countries where the process of 
integration is faster.
1 Europe is the region that appears to have integrated the fastest, reaping the largest real 
gains in the process. The study also finds that some of the channels through which financial integration 
affects growth include faster globalization and financial market development, and higher liquidity.  
Measuring the advances in financial integration as a degree of cross-country convergence in equity premiums 
(following Adjaouté and Danthine, 2004), the analysis indicates the following: 
Financial integration has increased worldwide, but especially so in emerging markets. Regional 
integration has proceeded faster in Europe, including in emerging Europe.  
The faster rate of financial integration has been associated with higher subsequent risk-adjusted growth.
2At the same time, improved risk-adjusted growth opportu
nities have been related to future advances in 
integration. This indicates that the countries whose integration has been faster benefit most from a 
virtuous dynamics, in which financial integration and improved real prospects are mutually reinforcing. 
Europe is the region that has benefited the most from such dynamics.
In addition, the investigation of possible channels through which advances in financial integration might 
affect growth finds the following: 
Financial integration fosters globalization and financial development, and boosts market liquidity.  
Coupled with findings in other studies that relate globalization and growth (Bekaert, Harvey, and 
Lundblad, 2005) and liquidity and growth (De Nicolò and Ivaschenko, 2008), these results suggest that 
globalization and liquidity are two of the channels through which the benefits of integration translate 
into higher real growth.

62What Are the Implications for 
Policy? 
 The empirical analysis carried out in this 
chapter suggests that domestic asset price 
dynamics are likely to reinforce economic boom-
bust dynamics. Specifically, the rapid growth of 
asset prices, particularly stocks and real estate 
prices, during booms raises the value of collateral, 
thus stimulating credit growth. Speculation on 
price swings will also become an additional source 

of demand for credit. In turn, the resulting wealth 
effects accentuate the spending boom. This 
process is further reinforced by the greater 
liquidity that characterizes fixed assets during 
periods of financial euphoria. However, this 
behavior also increases the vulnerability of the 
financial system during the subsequent 
downswing, when it becomes clear that the loans 
did not have adequate backing. Asset price 
deflation will be reinforced as debtors strive to 
cover their financial obligations and creditors seek 

to liquidate the assets received in payment for 
outstanding debts, in conditions of reduced asset 
liquidity. The basic problem in this regard is the inability 
of individual financial intermediaries to internalize 
the collective risks assumed during boom periods. 

This is because these risks are essentially of a 
macroeconomic character and therefore entail 
coordination problems that exceed the capabilities 
of any one agent. Moreover, risk assessment and 
traditional regulatory tools tend to have a potential

63procyclical bias in the way they operate.
41 The 
traditional focus on microeconomic risk 
assessment, with inadequate attention paid to the 
effects of external financial cycles on domestic 
financial markets, and on exchange and interest 
rates, further reinforces this bias. In fact, it is 
during crises that the excess of risk assumed 
during economic booms becomes evident and 
ultimately makes it necessary to write off loan 
portfolios. In a system where loan loss provisions 

are tied to loan delinquency, the sharp increase in 
such delinquency during crises reduces financial 
institutions™ capital and, hence, their lending 
capacity. This, in conjunction with the greater 
perceived level of risk, triggers the credit squeeze 
that characterizes such peri
ods, further reinforcing 
the downswing in economic activity and asset 
prices, and thus the quality of the portfolios of 
financial intermediaries.  
 To mitigate these cyclical effects, some 
supervisors (for example, in Spain) have 
advocated (and implemented) the use of 
countercyclical provisioning methodologies 
(sometimes referred to as ﬁdynamicﬂ or 
ﬁstatisticalﬂ), which require banks to provision 

more (than evidenced by losses) in good times, 
when the identified need for provisioning is 
smaller, and draw against these reserves in bad 
times, when the need for provisions is larger. 
Given the interaction between provisions and 
capital, it is argued that such forward-looking 
provisioning methods could reduce the 
procyclicality of regulatory requirements (see 
Box 12).  
_______ 
41 There is a growing literature on the potential procyclicality 
of the new risk-sensitive bank capital regulationŠknown as 
Basel IIŠmirroring the concern that the increase in capital 

requirements during downturns might severely contract the 
supply of credit. On this point, see, among others, Jokipii and 
Milne (2006), Taylor and Goodhart (2006), Jiménez and 

Saurina (2006), Saurina and Trucharte (2007), and Repullo 
and Suarez (2008). For recent policy discussions, see also 
Caruana and Narain (2008) and Goodhart and Persaud 

(2008). Indeed, model simulations of a decrease in 
procyclicality of bank lendingŠfollowing, for 
example, the introduction of a countercyclical 
element into prudential banks™ capital regulationŠ

suggest substantial reductions in the volatility of 
investment in financially integrated economies. 
Not surprisingly, stability gains appear to become 
more significant in those economies exhibiting 
tighter financial borrowing constraints (Figure 32). 
 Improved prudential regulation, including the 
introduction of countercyclical components that 
take into account the macroeconomics of boom-
bust cycles, is a complement to but not a 
substitute for appropriate policies in other areas. 
Two types of policies are crucial in this regard: 
countercyclical macroeconomic policies that 
reduce the intensity of boom-bust cycles, and 
policies aimed at deepening domestic financial 
development. In general, having sufficient room 

for maneuver on the policy side substantially 
reduces the pressures that are likely to be felt on 
the real economy as financial conditions 
deteriorate. Last but not least, the empirical evidence 
presented above argues in favor of greater 

financial integration supported by adequate 
coordination of national financial policies. Indeed,

64Box 12. Countercyclical Credit Risk Provisioning: The Spanish Experience 
Conceptually, the framework for bank credit risk management views provisions as covering ﬁexpected losses,ﬂ and 
capital as covering ﬁunexpected losses.ﬂ These provisions can either be ﬁspecificﬂ or ﬁgeneralﬂ (depending on 
whether they are related or unrelated to any specific loans or impairments). Risk-based bank capital regulations can 
have a procyclical propensityŠin a downturn, as credit risks are heightened, capital requirements increase and 
banks may resort to reduced lending, accentuating the downturn. Provisioning requirements for credit risk may 
also be similarly procyclicalŠa
s credit losses mountin a downturn, banks 
may be required to provision more. This 
in turn reduces the earnings, thus affecting banks™ ability to bolster their capital. To mitigate these cyclical effects, 
some supervisors have advocated (and implemented) the use of countercyclical provisioning methodologies 
(sometimes referred to as ﬁdynamicﬂ or ﬁstatisticalﬂ), which require banks to provision more (than evidenced by 
losses) in good times, when the identified need for provisioning is small, and draw against these reserves in bad 
times, when the need for provisions is larger. Given the interaction between provisions and capital, such forward-
looking provisioning methods could reduce the procyclicality of regulatory requirements.   
In practice, while the use of ad hoc countercyclical methods is not uncommonŠfor instance, through a temporary 
increase of provisioning or risk-weight requirements in the face of rapid credit growthŠfew countries use full-
fledged countercyclical provisioning systems. Spain has been the leading practitioner of countercyclical 
provisioning, requiring banks to make statistical provisions based on either a supervisory formula or own internal 
estimates of historical expected loss, which form part of the general provisions. Specific provisions in the 
accounting period are compared with this statistical provision. If the former are less than the latter, then the 
difference is charged to income for the period; otherwise, the accumulated statistical provisions can be drawn 
down to meet any increase in required specific provisions. This reduces the volatility of earnings as well as the 
associated procyclical effects. This system appears to have served Spain well. Although several Spanish banks have 
been faced with more nonperforming loans in recent periods on account of their exposure to real estate, investor 
sentiment has not faltered, as reflected in the resilience of these banks™ share prices.  
If countercyclical provisions are the way to go, why have they not been adopted more widely? Unlike bank capital, 
there are no internationally agreed standards on supervisory provisioning prescriptions. However, guidance has 
been provided on a country-by-country basis. National practices vary, partly because banks™ provisioning decisions 
are influenced by an interaction of the regulatory, a
ccounting, and taxation regimes, as well as management 
objectives regarding earnings. Elements of these different dimensions tend to conflict with forward-looking 
provisions, especially those that are more general (not identified with any particular exposure or impairment). 
Historically, regulatory prescriptions on provisioning have tended to be backward looking, that is, focusing on 
relating provisioning levels to the extent of deterioration in the outstanding value of the loan. In recent times, 
many countries have included forward-looking elements by requiring identified, though not incurred, impairments 
to be provisioned, and some have also encouraged the creation of across-the-board general provisions, a limited 
portion of which can qualify as capital. However, these practices are sometimes interpreted as being in conflict 
with the impairment provisioning laid out in the revamped International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
These standards champion a fair valuation of all assets, 
including loans; this valuat
ion must reflect any incurred 
losses or impairment events, but restrict the ability to include (with some exceptions) losses that may occur in the 
future, an essential element of countercyclical provisioning. Market regulators, too, are wary of the possibility that 
such methods can allow banks to manipulate their earnings through ﬁincome smoothing,ﬂ and thus hinder 
transparency for investors. Finally, the tax treatment of provisions (specific provisions are more likely to be tax 
deductible while general provisions are usually not) may also create disincentives for bank management.

THE EUROPEAN CREDIT CYCLE: DIVERGING PATTERNS 
65However, as the experience of Spain (and a few other countries, including Portugal and Australia) suggests, none 
of these issues is insurmountable, and it is likely that, in the context of the ongoing credit crunch, more 
supervisors will seek to interpret the accounting standards in a manner that supports their ability to dampen the 
procyclical effects of bank regulation. Supervisory discussions in international forums are also focusing on 
mitigating the unintended procyclical effects of bank regulation, particularly in the context of Pillar 2 of the Basel 
II framework, which requires supervisors to ensure that systems to manage bank risk take cyclical effects into 
account. Countercyclical methods for credit risk provisioning may, therefore, just be in the headlines once again. 
regulatory and supervisory convergence remains 
essential to foster smooth and growth-oriented 
adjustment among economies characterized by 
increasingly complex linkages across market 
segments and bordersŠand even more so within 
a monetary union. In this context, further, bold 
steps are needed to commit EU member states to 
put in place national and cross-border 
arrangements to deal with financial stability issues 
(Box 13).
Box 13. Cross-Border Financial Stability in the European Union: Where Do We Stand?
1The European Union needs a more integrated approach to financial stabilityŠa fact highlighted by the ongoing 
financial turmoil. Since the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the European Union has sought to establish a single financial 
market. It has made major progress toward this objective, but completing the process and managing the related 
risks require an integrated approach to financial stability.
 2 Political preference, as well as legal and institutional 
considerations, has thus far limited the progress on cross-border financial stability arrangements; however, the 
increased sense of urgency created by the ongoing financial turmoil has bolstered support for reforms in this area. 
The fundamental problem is that national supervisors™ fiduciary responsibilities are toward national governments 
and parliaments. This limits their incentives to work to
ward common EU objectives. The IMF staff has for some 
time argued that the European Union needs joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability, and that 
this undertaking should be underpinned by more complete information sharing (including with the European 
Central Bank) and better crisis prevention, management, and resolution frameworks. 
The European Union has adopted a set of cross-border crisis management principles and a supporting 
memorandum of understanding (MoU). These principles, adopted by the October 2007 Economic and Financial 
Affairs Council (ECOFIN), commit member states to act in crises to minimize the ﬁpotential harmful economic 
impacts at the lowest overall collective costs.ﬂ If public resources are needed to achieve a cost-minimizing 
solution, then direct budgetary net costs are to be ﬁshared among Member States on the basis of equitable and 
balanced criteria.ﬂ The recently agreed MoU seeks to implement these principles. It commits member states to 
putting in place national and cross-border arrangements to manage financial stability problems, a set of common 
guidelines for crisis management, and a common assessment framework to determine the systemic nature of a 
crisis. Meanwhile, work is ongoing to overhaul the legal framework to deal with solvency problems in cross-border 
banks. This work covers improvements to deposit guarantee schemes, a framework for early intervention and 
reorganization measures, and an assessment of obstacles to the transfer of assets across borders.

(concluded)
The Lamfalussy framework, aimed at achieving regulatory 
and supervisory convergence, is being reinforced. This 
framework was set up to facilitate financial sector rule making at the EU level and achieve a more consistent 
application of these rules at the national level. The so-called Level 3 Committees of this framework bring together 
national supervisors and have been tasked with much of the burden of achieving the desired convergence. The 
December 2007 ECOFIN launched a road map of reforms to reinforce these committees by giving them more 
resources, introducing scope for qualified majority voting, and strengthening the national application of guidelines 
issued by these committees, while maintaining the nonbinding nature of the guidelines. 
Strong political leadership will be needed to move decisively toward greater joint responsibility and accountability. 
The crisis management principles, with their recognition of a collective responsibility and a need to share costs, 
have broken the mold. However, in a severe crisis, national interests may still prevail over the good intentions 
embedded in these principles and the nonbinding MoU. The MoU also risks adding further complexity to the 
cross-border financial stability setup. All in all, timely and collective cost-minimizing solutions may still prove out 
of reach. The key challenge is to align the legal underpinnings of nationally anchored financial stability frameworks 
and the incentives of the relevant agents with the commonly agreed principles. In this context, an important step 
was taken at the May 2008 ECOFIN meeting, which called on member states to endow their supervisors™ statutes 
with a European mandate so that they ﬁare able to take into account the EU dimension in the performance of 
their duties, including having regard to the financial stability concerns in other Member States in exercising their 
duties.ﬂ However, bolder steps will be needed. These will require strong political leadershipŠof the kind that led 
to the introduction of the euro as a common currency 10 years ago. 
674. Cross-Border Labor Flows in New Member 
States: Patterns and Challenges  
 The flows of labor across the borders of the European 
Union™s New Member States (NMS) have not only 
intensified significantly since the onset of transition, but have 
also become increasingly diverse and flexible. Cross-border 
labor mobility has been beneficial to the NMS, speeding up 
the convergence process in countries where these flows have been 
large. Contrary to perceptions, labor mobility is an unlikely 
source of overheating; instead, it tends to play a cushioning 
role over the business cycle. In the medium term, however, 
outward labor mobility may contribute to wage increases that 
could combine with other rigidities and set off second-round 
inflationary effects. These need to 
be kept in check to preserve 
competitiveness. Better mobilization and utilization of labor 
are also desirable, to meet the challenges of reversing current 
account imbalances and ensuring sustained growth in the long 
run.
*Overview  
 Along with the international flow of capital, the 

movement of labor across the borders of the 

European Union™s NMS has been a key feature in 
their process of income convergence.
42 With the 
progressive relaxation of restrictions to the cross-
border mobility of labor, most NMS have since the 
onset of transition experienced an intensification of 
the flow of labor across borders. These flows have 
manifested themselves in various guises and 
directions: 
Over the past decade or so, many countries have 
experienced a wider variety in the way labor 
services are being provided across borders,

permanent residence, and participation in the 
foreign labor market, or through various types of 
seasonal, temporary, or irregular flows of labor 

services across borders. These different modes 
have emerged in response to factors such as an 
increased availability of (very) low-cost 

transportation options, a less restrictive policy 

environment, and an increased demand for 
flexible forms of foreign labor. 
Unlike capital flowsŠwhich have been primarily 
inboundŠmany countries have experienced 
flows of labor in both inbound and outbound 

directions. While several countries have 
witnessed sizable outflows to higher-income 
countries, many of them have simultaneously 

benefited from sizable inflows from their lower-
income neighbors. In net terms, however, most 
countries have experienced large outflows for 

some time since the onset of transition.
The magnitude of these flows has fueled a debate 
that has unevenly emphasized the perspective of 

higher-income recipient or destination countries. 
For these countries, a key issue has been the 
absorption of foreign labor inflows in domestic 

labor markets. Whereas initially the concern was that 
large inflows would hurt labor market outcomes, the 
evidence thus far suggests that the inflows have 

been absorbed well. They have supplemented rather 
than replaced domestic labor, and, by doing so, they 
have alleviated aging-related problems, contributed 

to economic growth, and helped fend off 

inflationary pressures.
43Adopting the perspective of the NMS, this 
chapter documents the evolving patterns of cross-
border labor mobility and addresses how the NMS 
can best manage the associated challenges. Building 

on a general equilibrium theoretical framework, this 
_______

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
68chapter discusses how labor mobility interacts with 
the process of income convergence. Among its key 
findings are the following:  
Labor mobility speeds up the convergence 
process, helps boost economy-wide capital-labor 
ratios, supports aggregate demand through 

remittances, and may contribute to skills 
augmentation through the reintegration of 
returning migrants into domestic labor markets.  
As labor migrates, so does part of the demand 
for nontradable goods. This migration moderates 
the boom in nontradable prices and the buildup 
of the current account deficit that arise during 
the convergence process. It also lessens the 

requirement for internal factor market flexibility 

to direct resources to the tradable sector, which 
would help reduce the current account deficit 
subsequently.  
Restricting labor mobility is therefore no answer 
to overheating pressures. Labor mobility is 
unlikely to be a significant primary source of 
overheating. In addition, labor mobility tends to 
play a cushioning rather than amplifying role. 

However, over the medium term, second-round 
effects of wage inflation possibly associated with 
outward labor flows need to be avoided to 

prevent an erosion of competitiveness.  
To ensure sustained growth, labor needs to be 
mobilized and utilized better, including by 

fostering labor force participation. This outcome 
would help countries face the challenges of 

reorienting resources from the nontradable to 

the tradable sector, as well as address any 
mismatches resulting from the differences in the 
age and skills composition of labor outflows and 

inflows.
Patterns  
 A general caveat applies to the discussion that 
follows on general patterns in cross-border labor 
mobility. The measurement of labor flows across 
borders is subject to various data limitations 

(availability, timeliness, precision, and quality). For 
example, migration registration systems reliant on 
changes in permanent residency may underestimate 
flows when foreign workers 
maintain their residency 
status while working abroad. Also, population 
censuses and labor force surveys may not capture 
temporary and irregular flows. Moreover, workers™ 
registration and other administrative systems in 
recipient countries may produce double counting 
and suffer from cross-country comparability.
44Intensified Flows  
 Labor market openness has made large and rapid 
strides since the onset of transition. Before 
transition, the movement of labor was highly 
restricted by governments 
(in terms of volume and 
destination) and primarily took the shape of 
settlement and irregular migration. The fall of the 
Iron Curtain gave a significant impetus to migration 
and, thereby, the mobility of labor across borders. 
However, labor markets in destination countries 
were opened up only gradually. Given the large 
income differentials and the uncertainty surrounding 
the possible scale of migration, restrictions were 
initially in force, but these were gradually alleviated 

in the wake of the successive EU enlargements.  
 The intensification of cross-border labor flows is 
evident in the development of net migration rates 
(Table 8). The data on net migration, derived from 
population statistics and available for most countries 
over relatively long periods of time, suggest that 

several countries have experienced strongly negative 
net migration rates over extended periods of time 
(i.e., outflows dominating inflows). This was 
particularly so in the Baltics during the early years of 
transition (reflecting the return migration of ethnic 
groups). Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania also 
experienced high negative net migration rates. For 
other countries, such as the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, and Slovenia, the average migration 
balance was positive. 
_______ 
44 Worker registration systems, for example, may not be able to 
ensure that workers deregister when they leave the destination 
country. This would cause the measure of inflows to be 

overstated. 
CROSS-BORDER LABOR FLOWS IN NEW MEMBER STATES: PATTERNS AND CHALLENGES 
69 Considering the period following the first EU 
enlargement in 2004, the evidence available on gross 
emigration rates suggests the following patterns:  
From the perspective of the EU-15 old member 
states, the stock of foreign residents from the 

NMS-8 has increased by about 200,000Œ250,000 
a year since the first EU enlargement.
45 This represents a cumulative 1.5 percent of source 

countries™ total population since 2004, with 
Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland experiencing 
higher-than-average gr
oss emigration rates.
46Countries that opened up earlier were among the 
more popular destination countries (Figure 33). 
Ireland and the United Kingdom, which were 
among the first to lift restrictions, recorded large 
inflows, leading to well-established migration 

networks.47 Factors other than migration 
restrictions also played a role, such as language 
barriers, as countries with similarly liberal 
regimes (e.g., Denmark and Sweden) did not 

experience sharp rises in inflows.  
Bulgaria and Romania became important source 
countries well before their accession in 2007

70Growing Flexibility  
 The past decade has also seen a sea change in the 
ways labor services are being provided across 
borders, as flexible modes of service delivery 
became increasingly more common:  
Flexible forms of labor mobility have thrived in 
response to (1) the seasonality of labor demand 
in destination countries, especially in the 

agriculture and construction sectors, and (2) the 

generally greater demand in these countries for 
flexible forms of labor, given domestic labor 
market rigidities. This situation has increased 

short-term and high-frequency labor flows.  
Proximity and accessibility factors have played a 
critical role in the emergence of these more 
flexible modes of delivery. The importance of 
geographical proximity is well illustrated in the 

cross-border linkages between Germany and 
Poland (Figure 34). For areas farther apart, 
accessibility has improved, thanks to low-cost 

transportation. This has fostered temporary 
forms of labor mobility (for example, between 
the Baltics and Ireland).
50A significant part of short-term labor flows may 
consist of irregular flows. The commuting back 
and forth by foreign laborers is hard to capture 

in the data and may lead to an underestimation 
of actual flows. At the same time, an increase in 
official cross-border flows after the lifting of 

inflow restrictions may be illusory, if the increase 
reflects the formalization of existing 
employment.51Changes in Composition  
 Although net flows may be of primary concern 
when the macroeconomic impact of labor mobility 
is being examined, the composition of gross flows 
matters too. Even if gross inflows exactly match 
gross outflows, an impact may be felt, not only 
through transitional costs arising from labor

movements but also through changes in the 
composition of the labor force.  
 Two dimensions of interest for the composition 
of flows are age and skill level:  
The limited evidence available suggests that, in 
recent years, the age distribution has not been 
significantly affected by the migration of labor 
(Table 10). By and large, young people are highly 

represented in outflow statistics. Yet, at the same 

time, they are also highly represented in the 
inflows to these countries. For the 15Œ24-year 
age group, the net migration rate is lower than 

average in Latvia and Poland (net emigration)

71and in Lithuania and the Slovak Republic (net 
immigration). For the age group of 25Œ29 years, 
only in Lithuania and Romania is net emigration 
significantly higher than average.  
It is not clear whether a similar conclusion holds 
for the distribution of skills. Data on skill levels 
are much harder to obtain. The partial evidence 
available for Estonia and Poland suggests that 
the skill levels of immigrants are generally lower 

than those of emigrants, even though the 

evidence for Poland also suggests that skill levels 
of recent emigrants are higher than those of 
emigrants in previous decades.
52 This finding, 
however, may not apply to other countries, as 
indicators of educational attainment of the 
working-age population in the NMS suggest an 

improvement in recent years.
53 So, if emigrants 
had high educational levels, their departure is 
unlikely to have significantly reduced the average 

skill level of the labor force.
54Impact of Labor Mobility on 
Convergence  
 Over the past decade, the NMS economies 
expanded strongly, with income levels converging at 
unprecedented speed to EU averages (Figure 35). 

The per capita income levels in the Baltic economies 
improved dramatically, rising from about 40 percent 
to 63 percent of the overall EU average over only 
eight years.
55 Other countries, such as Hungary and 
Slovenia, converged more slowly, partly because of 
their stronger starting position. 
 How has this convergence process been affected 
by the mobility of labor across borders? Before 
addressing this question, it is useful to consider the 
stylized example of an economy catching up to 
higher living standards when the only type of labor

54 However, average educational attainment levels might have 
been higher if highly educated migrants had not left. 
55 These ratios are calculated as the simple unweighted average

Lithuania to that of the EU-27. 
mobility allowed is that between the sectors of the 
economy. Thus, workers can shift between jobs in a 
country (ﬁinternal labor mobilityﬂ), but not between 
countries for employment in a similar job (ﬁexternal 
labor mobilityﬂ). Afterward, the cases of both 
internal and external mobility will be considered. 
Convergence with Only Internal 
Mobility  
 Consider an economy whose productivity 
improves, benefiting all sectors in the economy, but 
especially the tradable sector (Figure 36, 
panel ﬁAﬂ).56 The process of convergence when 
labor is externally immobile is described by two 
distinct stages: an expansion stage and a 
reorientation stage.
57The 
expansion stage

56 The asymmetric treatment of 
productivity developments in 
the nontradable and tradable sectors does not result in a loss of 
generality. Its sole purpose here is to generate the Balassa-
Samuelson effect of price convergence. 
57 The theoretical underpinnings of the two stages of 
convergence are detailed in Bems and Schellekens (2007).

72 to be able to smooth their consumption in 
anticipation of higher permanent income, will 
borrow from abroad. To satisfy the increased 

demand for goods, tradable goods can be easily 
imported from abroad, but nontradable goods 
need to be produced locally. Because it takes 

time to produce nontradables, demand for 
nontradable goods initially exceeds supply, 
causing nontradable prices to appreciate. 
The 
reorientation stage
 takes place as soon as 
capacity in the nontradable sector has caught 
up with demand. This catch-up results in a 
dampening of nontradable price pressure, and 
the moderation in the relative price of 

nontradables, if not reversal, will help direct 
resources back to the production of tradable 
goods. The change in the economy™s 

production structure will reduce the 
dependence of consumers on foreign 
borrowing and help service the stock of 
foreign liabilities.  
The internal mobility of labor is a crucial factor 
in making sure that convergence proceeds 
smoothly. If internal mobility were to be 

constrained for some reason, the rapid buildup of 
foreign debt during the expansion stage would no 
longer be optimal. It would prove too costly 

during the reorientation stage to shift labor 
resources from one sector to another. When 
internal mobility is limited, it will therefore be 

optimal to slow the convergence process by 

reducing the upswing in the expansion stage and 
lessening the requirements fo
r structural change in 
the reorientation stage.

CROSS-BORDER LABOR FLOWS IN NEW MEMBER STATES: PATTERNS AND CHALLENGES 
73Convergence with Internal and 
External Mobility  
Capital-Labor Adjustment  
 Consider now the case in which, in the 
economy described above, labor can flow not only 
internally across sectors but also externally across 
borders. This kind of mobility will have several 
effects on the medium-term convergence process: 
As NMS economies typically have too little 
capital and too much labor, the marginal return 
on capital (labor) is high (low). The search for 

the highest return, therefore, simultaneously 
produces capital inflows and, when external 
labor mobility is allowed, labor outflows 

(Figure 36, panel ﬁBﬂ). In this way, the NMS 
are able to achieve a more efficient economy-
wide capital-labor ratio.  
Because income levels can be boosted by 
providing labor services abroad, greater 
external labor mobility produces faster 
convergence in consumption and, therefore, 
welfare levels (Figure 36, panel ﬁCﬂ). 
Convergence measured in terms of output per 
capita also speeds up. However, because the 
utilization of labor resources is partly diverted 
abroad, the domestic product of the source 
country will grow more slowly than in the case 

of less or no external mobility (Figure 36, 

panel ﬁDﬂ). Expansion and Reorientation
As for the two stages of convergence, external 
labor mobility has the following impact on the 

domestic economy:  
External labor mobility moderates the 
expansion stage boom and lessens the resource 
shift needed in the reorientation stage. As 

labor flows abroad, so does part of the 

demand for nontradable goods, easing the 
bottleneck in the nontradable sector. As a 
result, nontradable price inflation will be more 

modest, too (Figure 37, panel ﬁAﬂ). So, even if 
convergence in consumption is faster, the 
domestic nontradable boom will be more 
moderate since economies abroad carry part of 
the burden of providing nontradable goods.  
Since the expansion boom is moderated, the 
nontradable sector will expand less and more 
gradually, and the current account deficit will 

be narrower (Figure 37, panel ﬁBﬂ). This 
reduces the need in the next stage to reorient 
the economy toward the tradable sector. 

Interestingly, this is the opposite of the effect 

of greater internal mobility, where more 
flexibility in allocating labor across sectors will 
amplify cross-sectoral volatility. The inflow of 

remittances owing to greater external mobility 
helps finance the trade deficit (Figure 37, 
panel ﬁCﬂ). Wages and Remittances
Throughout convergence, the following wage-
related developments can be observed: 
Greater external mobility may contribute to 
domestic wage inflation (Figure 37, 
panel ﬁDﬂ). The outflow of labor drives up the 

marginal product of labor domestically and, 
therefore, also domestic wages. This helps 
speed up wage convergence to foreign levels, 

reducing the incentive to provide labor services 
abroad. The extent of such wage pressure 
depends on the severity of domestic labor 

shortages and mismatches.
58Some of the wage gains workers manage to 
extract by providing labor abroad are offset in 
real terms because of higher foreign price 
levels. As a result of their spending time 
abroad, migrant workers may need to consume 

substantial amounts of nontradable goods in 
the destination country. Foreign nontradables, 
however, are more expensive than in the 

source country due to sectoral productivity 
differentials across countries (the Balassa-
Samuelson effect).
_______ 
58 This is not to say that labor mobility is the only source of 
wage pressure. An inflationary macroeconomic policy mix 

may constitute an additional source of wage inflation. 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
74Through remittances, the net gain in wages as 
a result of working abroad benefits both the 
migrant worker and any household members 

left behind in the source country.
59Remittances can be spent on domestic goods, 
invested, or used to finance a part of the trade 
deficit. To the extent that remittances fuel the 

demand for nontradable goods, the relative 
price of nontradable goods is boosted by their 
inflow._______ 
59 The general equilibrium model in Bems and Schellekens 
(forthcoming) assumes a utility-maximizing representative 
household, a fraction of which can work abroad and earn the 

foreign wage. 
Outflows and Return Inflows
Considering the intertemporal nature of the 
adjustment process, the outflows and return 

inflows of labor follow 
this general pattern:  
Labor initially flows out at high speed. 
However, as wage levels converge between 
source and destination countries, the incentive 

to leave the source country is diminished, and 

the outflow of workers slows.  
Eventually, the outflow of workers may 
reverse (Figure 36, panel ﬁBﬂ), particularly 
when agents expect persistently higher growth

CROSS-BORDER LABOR FLOWS IN NEW MEMBER STATES: PATTERNS AND CHALLENGES 
75in productivity in the source country.
60 This development will provide an incentive to reap 
the benefits of higher wages abroad early on, 
since domestic wages will be expected to 

converge rather quickly. 
To the extent that cross-border workers have 
acquired specific skills and built human capital by 
virtue of their jobs abroad, the return of these 
workers will also augment the growth potential of 
the source country.  
Policy Challenges  
 Greater labor mobility has substantial benefits 
at the level of the individual but presents a 
number of challenges at the aggregate level: 
From the perspective of the individual, greater 
mobility offers a wider set of possibilities. 

Insofar as the outflow of labor is the outcome 
of a decision made under free choice, the 
outcome is welfare improving to the 

individual.From the perspective of society, however, the 
question is more difficult. Does the individual 
decision impose any externalities on the rest of 
society? How are these 
externalities shared 
across borders? Do national policymakers 
sufficiently take into account the cross-border 
externalities?  
The challenge for policymakers is to maximize 
the benefits of cross-border labor mobility, while 
avoiding volatility by implementing demand-

management policies and fostering growth 
through structural reforms.
61_______ 
60 Return migration is driven not only by the nature of the 
productivity shock, but also by imperfections in the degree of 

factor mobility, which amplify wage developments during 
transition. As labor flows out, capital cannot be immediately 
reduced to the optimal level. Thus, wages are temporarily 

ﬁtoo highﬂ in transition, which triggers return migration. 
61 Other challenges, relating to the distributional impact of 
cross-border labor mobility, are beyond the scope of this 

chapter. 
Managing Volatility  
 The flow of labor across borders has been 
repeatedlyŠand, as will be argued, often 
erroneouslyŠassociated with overheating and 
subsequent cooling (the boom-and-bust cycle). 

This is perhaps unsurprising in view of the rates 
of wage inflation recently observed in some 
countries, as well as the presumed boost of 
remittances to domestic demand.  
Symptoms of Overheating . . .
 During the early stages of transition, labor 

outflows occurred in the context of large 
unemployment and underemployment figures. 
Later on, however, domestic labor markets began 
to experience a tightening to some degree or 
another, resulting in real wage increases 
(Figure 38), although this has started to taper off 

somewhat more recently. This pattern is also 
reflected in job vacancy rates, which increased 
steadily (Figure 39), although in Estonia and 
Latvia they have recently started to fall. Shortages 
have emerged in specific segments of the labor 
market, including the construction and services 
sector, where labor demand has been especially 
buoyant. With labor markets tighter, incremental

76moves in the supply of labor due to cross-border 
mobility have become more easily reflected in 
wages. 
 Associated with the cross-border outflow of 
labor is the inflow of remittances. Remittances 
support domestic economic activities, and, insofar 
as these activities translate into an increased 
demand for domestic products, remittances could 
contribute directly to price and wage inflation 
through a ﬁremittances acceleratorﬂ mechanism. 
In addition to supporting household and family 

consumption, remittances may increasingly take 
on an investment character. The monies remitted 
by cross-border workers may be invested in 
domestic equity and real estate markets, thus 
amplifying existing appreciation pressures on 
these asset prices and feeding back into overall 
demand through wealth effects.  
. . . or Business as Usual?
 Before one can assess th
e role played by labor 
mobility in overheating, it is useful to first assess 
its worth in determining the relative importance of 
labor and capital in the convergence process 

(Box 14). In most countries, the combination of 
anticipated productivity growth and the desire to 
smooth consumption seems to have been a 
driving force more powerful than the impact of 
outward labor mobility. This conclusion is also 
apparent in the fact that, even if labor has flowed 
out, capital has continued to flow inŠsomething 
that would not have been the case had net labor 
outflows been the dominant factor.
62 In sum, if 
labor plays a more limited role than capital in the 
convergence process, one can safely conjecture 
that the role of labor in producing overheating is 

also more limited. 
 The role played by labor mobility, and its 
contribution to wage inflation and demand 
support (e.g., through remittances), need not be 
seen as causing overheating per se:  
A degree of wage inflation in domestic labor 
markets is a natural and optimal feature of 
convergence when labor is crossing borders.
63Remittances allow households to access a 
wider set of consumption and investment 
choices, and are therefore a crucial channel 
through which cross-border labor mobility 
translates into welfare benefits.
64Labor mobility may dampen the oscillations 
observed in the domestic economy. As labor 
flows out, some of the demand for 
nontradable goods is exported, thereby 
alleviating pressure on domestic resource 

constraints. As a result, the nontradable price 
boom and current account deterioration are 
both smaller (Figure 37, panels ﬁAﬂ and ﬁBﬂ). 
_______ 
62 If labor flows out, optimality would require dismantling the 
capital stock, as the remaining labor force would have too 
much capital. 
63 In a setting with a labor-leisure choice, employment could 
increase during the boom years, alleviating some of the wage 
pressure

expenses by seasonal migrants who worked in Germany 
during 1998Œ2000 fall under the category of current 

consumption.

77Box 14. Migration and Economic Convergence in the New Member States 
Many New Member States (NMS) are 
concerned with the economic and social 
consequences of emigration. Although official 
statistics are incomplete, populations are 
declining markedly in some of these countries, 
owing to both falling birthrates and net 
outward migration. In addition, recent surveys 
suggest that 
potential
 migration could be 
substantial, especially in light of the relaxed 
migration policies that are mandated for 
European Union (EU) countries by end-2010. 
At the same time, it is important to recognize 
that labor outflows, along with capital inflows, 
are an integral part of the development 
process. Growth models predict that countries 
with relatively low capital-to-labor ratios will 
attract capital, since the rate of return on 
capital is relatively high. The models also predict that
 labor will move abroad, where labor productivity and 
real wages are higher. The convergence process for a particular country will depend, among other factors, on 
the degree to which labor and capital are mobile across borders, and the degree of substitutability between 
capital and labor. 
Two questions are particularly important in this respect: 
Is labor migration unusual in the NMS?
 Net migration rates and income differentials for the EU-15 countries 
during 1960Œ2000 indicate that migration among EU-15 countries was strongly responsive to economic 
incentives (figure). This estimated relationship is somewhat successful in explaining recent migration 
trends for NMS, even though outward migration is lik
ely flowing to nonŒEU-15 countries, as well as to 
EU-15 countries (first table). The actual net migration 
rates tend to be lower than the predicted rates for 
lower-income countries and tend to be higher for countries with income levels closer to the EU-15.

(concluded) 
How important is labor migration for the convergence process?
 Capital-to-employee ratios have improved quickly 
for all NMS, especially those with re
latively low initial levels (second table). Most of the gains, however, 
came from capital accumulation rather than from ou
tward migration, suggesting that labor is relatively 
immobile compared with capital.
Labor Mobility™s Cushioning Role
 Labor mobility responds to overheating 
pressures: the outflow of labor moderates as the 

economy overheats, thereby diminishing labor™s 
effect on wage inflation.
Consider the case where overheating derives 
from an overoptimistic assessment of future 

productivity developments, which drives up 
present consumption and investment in 
anticipation of future permanent income 

increases that will (or may) not materialize.
65Through its effect on relative wages and prices, 

overheating can have an important impact on 

the incentive to provide labor services across 

the border.  
Compared with an economy that is not 
overheating (i.e., one in whichŠin keeping 
with this exampleŠproductivity expectations 

are about right), an overheating economy will 

experience smaller labor outflows because local

mix. 
economic conditions are perceived to be better 
(Figure 40). Thus, relative to the best case of 
no overheating, labor mobility plays a smaller 

role in producing wage inflation than the 

underlying cause of overheating.  
Labor mobility would also respond in the case 
of a significant cooling or ﬁbustﬂ in the boom-
bust cycle. Whereas most countries have 
continued to register strong growth, the economic

CROSS-BORDER LABOR FLOWS IN NEW MEMBER STATES: PATTERNS AND CHALLENGES 
79conditions in some countries, particularly those 
that had experienced overheating pressures 
previously, have started to turn around or have 

already done so. With labor markets open 
internationally, the concern is that the downturn 
would produce additional outward flows of labor, 

as well as a smaller inflow of labor from abroad 

(including a reduced incentive for return inflows). 
The concern is particularly valid when the wage 
gap with destination countries is insufficiently 

closed. 
Model simulations illustrate this mechanism 
(Figure 41). Given expectations about future 
productivity growth, some labor flows out in the 
initial periods. If these expectations had been

bustﬂ in Figure 41), the stock of foreign labor 
abroad would have started to taper off after a 
number of periods, reflecting the return inflow of 

labor. However, if the initial rosy expectations had 
been proven wrong (ﬁoverheating with bustﬂ), the 
stock of foreign labor may actually continue to 

grow, reaching its maximum level later.  
The magnitude of the labor outflow following 
a downturn also depends, of course, on whether 

the downturn is similarly being felt in recipient 
economies. Indeed, if conditions deteriorate 
simultaneously in recipient and sending countries, 

the threat of additional labor outflows may be 
diminished. Also, region-specific shocks may 
induce both inward and outward migration. For 
example, a sector-specific shock in one region may 
induce an inflow of high-skilled workers from 
other regions, while producing an outflow of low-

skilled workers. 
Demand-Management Policies
 Against this background, what are the 
implications for demand-management policies? 
With respect to episodes of overheating, the 
key policy implication is to address the source 
of overheating directly, taking into account 
that much of the wage pressures caused by 
labor mobility reflect natural convergence and 

not overheating. Attempting to limit labor 

mobility directly or to offset the resulting 
upward pressure on wages through demand-
management policies may hurt the overall 

economy™s convergence process and, therefore, 
individual and social welfare. At the same time, from a demand-management 
perspective, overheating may pose a number of 
secondary challenges, and the key will be to 

address these while preserving the benefits of 
labor mobility. For example, as noted, wage 
inflation may be a natural consequence of 

labor mobility. While these inflationary 

consequences are optimal, the policymaker will 
need to fine-tune demand-management 
policies to ensure that wage pressures do not 

set off a self-feeding wage-price spiral. 
Policymakers will also need to keep the 
second-round impact in check to ensure that 
wage growth does not erode competitiveness. 
Even where local labor market characteristics, 

such as low degrees of unionization and high 
internal labor market flexibility, would suggest 
that wage growth can be kept in line with 

productivity growth, the threat of emigration 
limits the scope for doing so. In designing their 
policy response, policymakers will need to 

carefully monitor wage developments and walk 

a fine line between preserving competitiveness 
and allowing wages to rise naturally in line with 
what is optimal.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
80Fostering Growth  
 Several challenges to the competitiveness and 
dynamism of the NMS economies need to be 
addressed to ensure that these countries not only 
reorient their economies successfully toward the 
tradable sector but also utilize resources more 
efficiently.  Mobilizing Labor Supply and 
Employment
 Most NMS have experienced a significant 
improvement in labor market outcomes since 
2000. Convergence led to a boost in the rate of 
job creation (Figure 42). As a result, average 
employment rates for the NMS rose by almost 

5 percentage points, although the improvement 
varied significantly across countries. Similarly, 
unemployment indicators improved (Figure 43), 
falling from about 12 percent during the early 
2000s to 7 percent in the past few years. Long-
term unemployment rates also improved in many 
countries. 
 Notwithstanding these improvements, there is 
further scope to mobilize and better utilize labor 
resources in most NMS. While the average 
employment rate has improved in most countries, 
it remains in all countries below the Lisbon target 
of 70 percent. The average employment rate in 
2007 stood at 63 percent, with some countries 
(Poland, Hungary, and Romania) experiencing 

rates below 60 percent. Also, unemployment rates 
remain high in several countries (notably the 
Slovak Republic and Poland, but also Bulgaria and 
Hungary). Raising labor market participation rates will 
help ease pressures on the labor force arising from 

natural demographic reasons and net migration, 
both of which reduce the working-age population. 
As argued by Kaczmarczyk and Okólski (2008), 
changes in labor market participation may play a 
bigger role than purely demographic changes 
through natural population growth and net 
migration. It is essential that the NMS improve 
participation rates so that they can successfully 
meet the challenges they will face.  
 A number of factors may complicate the 
mobilization of labor supply and the increase in 
employment rates:

CROSS-BORDER LABOR FLOWS IN NEW MEMBER STATES: PATTERNS AND CHALLENGES 
81Overheating forces may have eroded the 
competitiveness of tradable industries, causing 
them to close down; if reinstalling industries is 
costly, completing the reorientation stage will 

become more difficult.  
Reorientation stage challenges are also more 
difficult to meet if the labor supply is limited 
and the skills profile of the workforce has 
deteriorated through the allocation of 

resources to the nontradable sector.  
The foreign debt will need to be serviced with 
a smaller labor support (assuming that much of 
the foreign debt remains local while labor 
migrates).The process of income convergence is 
accelerated if policymaker
s stimulate labor force 
participation and employme
nt rates. Greater labor 
market participation and lower structural 
unemployment could be achieved through better-

targeted active labor market policies, less rigid 

regulations regarding hiring and dismissals, and an 
improved design of the tax benefits system.  
Reducing Labor Market Mismatches
 In a number of countries, labor outflows of 
the young and relatively low skilled have been 
particularly pronounced. This phenomenon has 
lowered the rate of wage dispersion across 
education levels. In Estonia, for example, net 
wages in 1997 for those with tertiary education 

were 93 percent higher than for those with only  

primary education; by 2006, this premium had 
fallen to 32 percent.
66In countries where mismatches have arisen 
owing to changes in the composition of gross 

outflows and inflows, these mismatches will need 
to be addressed. Similar mismatches may arise 
from the aging of the populations in many 

countries. These problems complicate the 

reorientation of the economy to a high-value-
added and competitive export sector. 
To offset mismatches, further consideration 
should be given to relaxing immigration policies, 
so as to allow larger inflows from non-EU 

emerging economies.
67 In addition, countries 
could invest in return migration to attract back 
those emigrants who have, during their 

employment abroad, gained valuable skills. Some 

countries have, for example, launched initiatives to 
induce overseas nationals to ﬁreturn migrateﬂ to 
reduce mismatches domestically.
68 Policymakers 
could also consider investing further in education, 
including tertiary education.

67 These non-EU countries may soon, however, face similar 
problems of labor shortage. 
68 Romania, for example, launched initiatives to persuade 
Romanian construction workers to return home and fill 

domestic job vacancies.
