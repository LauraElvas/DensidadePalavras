 Alternative scenario for the euro area: a credit-squeeze

   OVERVIEW   1 Economic activity in the EU and euro-area economies has started to slow. 
GDP growth eased to 0.5% quarter-on-quarter (qoq) in the EU in the last 

quarter of 2007 and to 0.4% in the euro area. This represents a moderation by 
0.3 percentage point (pp.) in both regions compared to the exceptional 
performance observed in the third quarter.  
For 2007 as a whole, GDP growth amounted to 2.8% in the EU (2.6% in the 
euro area), still well above estimates 
of potential growth. Growth was 
supported by sound domestic fundamentals that boosted investment and, to a 
lesser degree, private consumption growth.  
However, the moderation in growth towards the end of last year did not come 
as a surprise in view of the turmoil in financial markets, which broke out last 

summer and is still persisting, and the marked slowdown of global activity, 
with the United States on the brink of
 a recession. Moreover, soaring energy 
and food prices affected both growth and inflation adversely.  
Going forward, the financial turmoil is proving deeper, wider and longer-
lasting, while the downturn in the US looks set to be more pronounced and 

protracted than assumed in the autumn 
forecast. The EU economy is still in a 
relatively good position to weather these headwinds on the back of improved 

fundamentals. Overall, compared w
ith the autumn 20
07 forecast, GDP 
growth for the EU has been revised down by about ½ pp. for both this year 

and next, to 2.0% in 2008 and 1.8% in 2009 (1.7% and 1.5%, respectively, in 
the euro area).  
The global economic situation and outl
ook are beset with more than usual 
uncertainty and, therefore, the forecast is
 surrounded with co
nsiderable risks. 
The baseline forecast depends crucially on 
the assumptions that the distress in 
the financial markets will play out gradually and on how manageable the 
effect on the real economy proves to be.  
Uncertainty about the size and locati
on of credit losses and therefore of 
counterparty risk is assumed to prevail until the end of this year, before 

gradually petering out during the first half of next year. The financial distress 

could have a lagged impact on the real economy. Indeed, the effect so far 

must be considered relatively limited 
given the sizeable shocks the European 
economy is facing. That could be a sign of the transmission lags being longer 

than earlier expected. It could also be
 taken as evidence of the improved 
resilience of the EU economy.  
Even if the EU economy is more resilient
 than earlier, thanks in part to the 
positive impact of past structural reforms and increased credibility of 

macroeconomic policies, Europe cannot es
cape unaffected. It can also not be 
ruled out that the underlying assumption on the financial turmoil and the US 
could prove to be too optimistic. The impact of a more pronounced credit 

squeeze is discussed in an alternative 
scenario, see Box 2.7.1, pointing to 
GDP growth being reduced by a further 0.5 pp. this year and 0.1 pp. next in 
both the euro area and the US. 
Turning to the new baseline forecast in
 greater detail, global growth is 
cooling rapidly from the exceptionally stro
ng growth of recen
t years, to an 
expected 3.8% in 2008 and 3.6% in 2009. This revision also includes the

Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  2 impact of a downward shift of global growth data by about ½ pp. in 2002-
2007 following a recent update of th
e purchasing power parities used for the 
aggregation of global growth (updating the base year from 1993 to 2005), see 

Box 1.1.1. Excluding the EU, global growth is projected at 4.4% this year 

and 4.2% next. Similarly, world trade growth is slowing markedly, down 
from about 7% in 2007 to 6% during both years of the forecast period. 
Despite this sizeable downward revision 
of global growth, it remains in line 
with its long-term average, reflecti
ng the growing importance of emerging 
economies and their relative robu
stness at the current juncture. 
Notwithstanding the dampening impact of the appreciation of the euro, 

economic activity is therefore expected to be supported by a positive, albeit 
small, net contribution from the external sector this year and next. 
At the regional level, recent information points to both a deeper and more 
protracted downturn of 
the US
 economy as the severe contraction of the 
housing sector, reinforced by the distress in financial markets, spreads to the 

rest of the economy. Consumption has stagnated following a weakening 
labour market, rising inflation, deteriorating credit conditions and, possibly, 

negative wealth effects from falling house and stock prices. Consumer 

confidence has collapsed to a long-time low. In spite of a considerable 

positive contribution from net exports, real GDP growth dropped to 0.1% qoq 
in the fourth quarter of 2007, down from 1.2% in the third quarter.  
Looking ahead and despite the sizeable fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, 
US GDP growth is now projected at 0.9% in 2008 and 0.7% in 2009, 

implying a downward revision of 0.8 pp. and 1.9 pps., respectively, since the 

autumn forecast. The US economy seems 
to be set for an extended period of 
sluggish growth. The expected impact of the tax rebates mid-2008, 

temporarily boosting activity in the second half of the year, in combination 

with a weak underlying recovery points to a drawn out W-shaped profile for 

GDP growth over the forecast period. 
The adjustment of the US economy, 
whilst clearly painful, should allow the current-account deficit to fall back to 

4% of GDP in 2009 while the households' savings rate improves by almost 2 

pps., thereby reducing global imbalances. At the same time, the budget 
deficit is set to deteriorate rapidly to about 6% of GDP in 2009. 
The outlook for 
Japan
 is also bleaker this year, despite the surprisingly 
strong growth recorded in the last quarter of 2007 when GDP growth rose to 

0.9% qoq (up from 0.3% in the third qua
rter). This follows, in particular, 
from the sharp deterioration in consumer confidence pointing to weak 

consumption growth ahead. Construction investment, on the other hand, 

should rebound this year (as the administrative problems related to the 

introduction of new anti-seismic regula
tions are overcome). Overall, GDP 
growth is expected to be 1.2% this year and 1.1% next. On the back of higher 

oil and commodity prices, inflation turned positive at the end of 2007 and is 
expected to remain so, albeit below 1% this year and next.  
Activity in 
emerging Asian
 economies continues to hold up relatively well in 
the light of the marked deterioration in the outlook for advanced economies. 

Indeed, both China and India exceeded ea
rlier expectations, yet again, and 
posted growth of 11.9% and 8.4% respectively in 2007. In view of the share 
of the US in the exports for some 
of the emerging economies, however, a 
protracted slowdown of US imports cannot go unnoticed. Moreover, the 

surge in consumer price inflation (to 
about 7% in China, for example), has 
forced central banks to continue to tighten monetary policy, thereby 
...above all, as US GDP 
growth falls to less 
than1%... 
...while emerging 
economies are 
holding up better...

  3 dampening domestic demand growth. For the region as a whole (i.e. Asia 
excluding Japan), real GDP growth is 
expected to decelerate from 8.6% in 
2007 to 7.9% this year and 7.6% next. This translates into a downward 
adjustment of about ½ pp. 
a year since last autumn. 
Growth in the 
other emerging economies
 also remains robust. Indeed, as 
regards the Middle East a
nd North Africa region, gr
owth is accelerating and 
has been revised up to around 6% a year on the back of oil revenues for some 

and the impact of past structural reform
s for others. In the CIS countries (i.e. 
the Commonwealth of Independent States), activity is set to moderate 

somewhat, to 7¾% this year, as the temporary boost to investment in Russia 

from the financial liberalisation in 2006 fades away, but the growth outlook 

is largely maintained from last autumn. Similarly, Latin America is 

weathering the slowdown in developed economies better than during similar 

periods in the past. Following sizeable inflows of private capital, improved 

labour market situations and reduce
d macroeconomic imbalances, real GDP 
growth is expected at 4¼% this year
. Lastly, the outlook for Sub-Saharan 
Africa also remains broadly unchanged with a GDP growth of more than 

6½% in 2008 as the economies benefit from high oil and/or commodity 
prices as well as increased openness. 
In the 
candidate countries
, i.e. in Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia and Turkey, economic activ
ity slowed markedly during the 
second half of 2007. This reflects lower global demand, the end of an 

election-related boost to public spending in Turkey and Croatia and the 

impact of earlier monetary tightening in Turkey, the by far largest economy 

of this group. Looking ahead, a moderate recovery is expected by 2009, 

allowing GDP growth to rebound to close to 5% (though this is 1½ pps. 

below the autumn projection). This foreca
st also includes 
an outlook for the 
potential candidate countries
, comprising Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, 
Montenegro and Serbia, pointing to a certain moderation in GDP growth to 
around 6%, mirroring the slowdown in global growth. 
Commodity prices continued to soar at th
e start of this year with new all-time 
highs reached for food, me
tal and oil prices. This is, to a certain extent, 
explained by a weaker US dollar (USD) and the financial turmoil turning 
some commodities into investment alternatives at the current juncture.  
...which, in turn, is 
contributing to higher 
commodity prices 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  4 A moderation of global growth ought to ease price pressures in some of these 
markets. Nevertheless, robust demand from emerging economies and 

geopolitical tensions in some of the commodity exporting countries point to 

continued high price levels ahead. Food prices, in particular, rose by almost 

40% year-on-year (yoy) in euro terms in the second half of 2007. This is the 

result of increased demand in emerging markets, strong demand for some 

crops from the biofuel industry and the ensuing substitution effects, and poor 

harvests as well as export taxes imposed in some of the major exporting 

countries. Food price infl
ation accelerated further dur
ing the first two months 
of 2008 and, based on future contract
s, prices are assumed to increase by 
54% yoy in the first half of this year, before stabilising.  
Prices for most metals have also risen 
markedly in recent m
onths on the back 
of stronger demand. Future prices point to a stabilisation at these higher 
levels for most, but not all metals. 
Based on contracts in the futures market
s, oil prices are assumed to increase 
to 101.2 USD per barrel (bl.) in 2008 (up from 72.5 USD / bl. in 2007 and 

revised up by 22½ USD or 28% since th
e autumn forecast) before declining 
slightly next year. For the euro area, the 
impact of higher oil prices is partly 
cushioned by the appreciation of the 
euro (EUR). Measured in EUR, oil 
prices are assumed to increase to 
65.3 EUR / bl. this year, limiting the 
upward revision to 13%. 
Concerning financing conditions, the distress in the markets has caused risk 
premia to widen markedly since last summer. The tightening of credit 

conditions has, however, been partly offset by the decline in benchmark 
interest rates in recent months. This 
reflects among other th
ings the weakened 
growth outlook, especially for the US, the flight to quality and a shift in 
expectations towards a looser monetary policy.  
So far, there are no firm
 signs of a credit squeeze.
 Although the bank lending 
survey by the ECB points to a tightenin
g of credit conditions, at the aggregate 
level M3 growth remains buoyant at more than 11% yoy in February 2008. 

This is explained by a continued acceler
ation of lending growth (especially 
bank lending) to non-financial corporations reaching a new record high, 

while lending growth to households for house purchases remains on a 
decelerating trend.  Most survey data at the beginning of 2008 point to a gradual easing of GDP 
growth in the coming quarters. Notwithstanding a slight rebound in the 

Commission's most recent business and co
nsumer surveys from March 2008, 
confidence has deteriorated in all s
ectors and for all of the largest EU 
economies since their peak last summer,
 with the exception of Poland where 
it remains robust. Nonetheless, the sectoral confidence indicators for industry 

and construction remain above their lo
ng-term averages, while confidence in 
the services sector has dropped well below.  
Against this backdrop, both hard and soft data point to a slowdown in 
economic activity. The deceler
ation in real GDP growth is being temporarily 
reinforced in the second quarter of this year when construction investment is 
set to fall back in Germany following a boost due to the mild weather in the 

first quarter. For 2008, in view of the carry-over of 0.9 pp. from 2007 (0.7 pp. 

in the euro area) and available information suggesting still firm growth in the 

first quarter in other Member States as 
well, real GDP growth is expected to 
decelerate from 2.8% in 2007 to 2.0% in
 2008 in the EU (a

  5 in the euro area). Reflecting the assu
med improvement in confidence in the 
course of next year, economic activ
ity could gradually accelerate towards 
potential at the end of 2009. For the y
ear as a whole, however, GDP growth 
is expected to decelerate further to 1.
8% (1.5% in the euro
 area). This would 
imply a downward revision by about ½ pp. in both 2008 and 2009 compared 
to the autumn forecast.  
Revisions to GDP per capita growth are of the same magnitude, bringing it 
down to 1.7% in 2008 and 1.5% in 2009 in the EU (1.4% and 1.2%, 

respectively, in the euro area). As a 
comparison, per capita GDP growth in 
the US is now forecast at around 0% 
for both years. Another measure of the 
'relative resilience' of Europe would be a comparison of the estimated output 

gaps where both regions started with a largely balanced position in 2007, 

expected to fall to -0.6% of GDP in the 
EU by 2009 compared to over -3% in 
the US (according to IMF's recent projection for the latter). 
The relative resilience, in view of the magnitude of the shocks, follows from 
improved fundamentals in the EU economy. Macroeconomic imbalances 

were largely absent in 
2007. Both public finan
ces and the current account 
posted deficits below 1% of GDP (with the budget deficit around ½% and 
current account in balance in the euro area), even if differences are large 

across Member States with some countri
es exhibiting a significant degree of 
external financing need. Households and enterprise balance sheets have 

improved markedly in recent years, making these sectors more resilient. 

Strong momentum in the labour market drove the unemployment rate down 

to 7.1% of the labour force (7.4% in th
e euro area), the lowest rate in more 
than 15 years.  
Growth rates continue to vary across EU
 Member States, not least because of 
the catching-up process in
 the recently-acceded Member States. Some of the 
countries who have benefitted from st
rong growth in recent years are now 
clearly slowing. Economic activity in others is holding up better (in view of 

the current headwinds) following e.g. several years of wage restraints and/or 
improved productivity.  
As regards the demand components, gross fixed capital formation, which has 
been the main source of gr
owth in recent years, is
 set to decelerate over the 
forecast period. Total investment growth 
falls from 5.4% in 2007 to 2.8% in 
...which, given the size 
of the shocks, confirms 
improved resilience 
Investment growth is 
weakening... 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  6 2008 and 2.0% in 2009 in the EU (down to 2.0% and 1.2% in the euro area). 
Construction investment, in particular, but also equipment investment, are 
revised down substantially.  
The weakening in construction investment reflects the cooling-off of 
overvalued housing markets in several EU countries, particularly Ireland, as 

well as in Denmark, Estonia and Spain where construction investment is 
contracting.  
As for equipment investment, although the distress in the financial markets 
does not yet appear to have affected bank lending to corporates, investor 

confidence has deteriorated and the prof
it share is likely to have peaked. The 
outlook is for a deterioration as economic activity weakens (and since 

demand factors are generally considered 
the key driving forces of industrial 
investment in the medium term), with the banking sector particularly 

affected. On the other hand, high capacity utilisation rates and sound balance 

sheets suggest that the outlook for equipment investment remains relatively 

favourable in some countries and sector
s, especially where investments can 
be self-financed.  
In contrast to earlier business cycles, private consumption has yet to take over 
as the main engine of growth, whic
h would be unusual as the cycle has 
already peaked. Weak private consumption could partly be explained by 

temporary factors in 2007 following th
e impact of e.g. 
the increase of the 
VAT rate in Germany or the general surge in consumer price inflation 

towards the end of last year (with co
nsumption decelerating to 0.1% qoq in 
the fourth quarter in the EU an
d -0.1% in the euro area).  
However, the weakness in household spending cannot be explained only by 
temporary factors. Four y
ears into the current cycl
e, the level of private 
consumption is about 3½ pps. below the average level recorded in the four 

previous business cycles. This appears to be explained, above all, by a lower 

growth in real compensation, while employment gains have been stronger 
than during previous recoveries.  
Looking ahead, with employment and real
 wage growth decelerating this year 
and consumer confidence in steady dec
line (below its long
-term average in 
March), private consumption growth is 
expected to decelerate from 2.1% in 
2007 to 1.6% in both 2008 and 2009. 
The relatively favourable composition of EU exports in product and 
geographical terms (with e.g. increas
ed importance of emerging and oil-
producing countries) limits the impact of the marked deterioration in the 

outlook for the US at the aggregated level, although it will be clearly 

noticeable for some countries such as 
Ireland and the United Kingdom. With 
the projected moderation of world trade, a further appreciation in nominal 

effective terms and, as regards the euro
 area, a deceleration in import growth 
reflecting an easing of domestic demand growth, the growth contribution 

from net exports diminishes (remaining slightly positive in both areas and for 

both years). Divergences in export 
performance remain sizeable across 
Member States, as a result of differences in cost competitiveness and in the 
product structure and geographical composition of exports.  
Turning to the labour market, employment continued to benefit from the 
strong growth momentum until the first half of 2007, in accordance with its 

usual lagged response. For the year as a whole, employment growth 

amounted to 1.7% in the EU (1.6% in the euro area), corresponding to nearly

Overview 
  7 4 million new jobs, and was broad-based across sectors, various types of 
work arrangements and most, but not all 
Member States (with e.g. marginal 
growth recorded in Portugal and a decline noted in Hungary). Going forward, 

employment growth is projected to slow down markedly to 0.8% this year 

and 0.5% next in the EU (0.9% and 0.5%, respectively, in the euro area), 
bringing it well below the long-term average.  
The unemployment rate fell to a record 
low last year of 7.1% of the labour 
force in the EU and 7.4% in the euro 
area (down from more than 8% in both 
areas in 2006) and continued to improve in
 the first quarter of this year. This 
improvement is explained by both cyclical and structural factors. Differences 

nevertheless remain sizeable across coun
tries, with the unemployment rate 
ranging from some 3% in the Netherlands to more than 11% in Slovakia, 

notwithstanding the latter's impressive 
improvements in recent years. With 
job creation slowing forward, the unem
ployment rate is forecast to bottom 
out this year in the euro area and somewh
at later - at the turn of 2008/2009 - 
in the EU.  
Labour shortages became increasingly 
visible towards the end of 2007 and 
were still on the rise in the first quarte
r of 2008 in the manufacturing sector, 
although no longer in the services sector. However, with the actual 

unemployment rate bottoming out and a deceleration foreseen in employment 
growth, compensation of employees per head is expected to remain relatively 

moderate over the forecast horizon, th
ough Germany is set to see a more 
pronounced acceleration of wage growth (up from 1.1% to 2.1% this year and 

2.6% next, following several years of wage restraints). Overall, wage growth 

is expected to accelerate from 2.9% to 
3.8% in 2008, temporarily boosted by 
some catching-up measures, before decel
erating again to 3.5% next year.  
Labour productivity growth 
is forecast to remain at 
1.2% in 2008 in the EU 
(and at 0.9% in the euro area), stay
ing below its long-term average. This 
implies an acceleration of unit labour cost
 growth to 2.6% in the EU this year 
(and 2.4% in the euro area). In real 
terms, however, real unit labour costs 
declined last year and remain broadly unchanged in 2008 and 2009 in both 
regions. 
Consumer price inflation remained cont
ained in the first three quarters of 
2007. Indeed, the inflation rate remained below 2% in the euro area for one 

year up until August 2007. However, headline inflation has increased rapidly 

thereafter to reach 3.6% yoy in March 
2008, the highest level in 12 years. 
The sharp increase reflects a combination 
of soaring food and energy prices 
as well as the fading of favourable base effects. Although core inflation, 

which excludes energy and unprocessed fo
od, has also increased to 2.7% yoy 
in March 2008, a sizeable gap betwee
n headline and core inflation has 
reappeared.  
Notably in view of the markedly higher commodity price assumption, the 
inflation forecast has been revised upwards by more than 1 pps. for 2008 

compared to the autumn forecast. 
Inflation is expected to increase 
temporarily from 2.4% in 2007 to 3.6% in 2008, before coming down to 

2.4% in 2009 in the EU (up from 2.1% to 3.2% this year and back to 2.2% in 

2009 in the euro area). In terms of quarterly profile, inflation is projected to 

peak in the second quarter of 2008 
in the EU and to gradually decrease 
throughout the rest of the year.

Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  8 The EU current-account deficit remains 
largely unchanged over the forecast 
period to just below 1% of GDP, wh
ile the euro-area current account would 
be broadly balanced. However, the aggregated development masks stark 

differences across EU Member States
. This reflects partly the increased 
heterogeneity within the EU the last
 two accessions brought about, as the 
catching-up process may involve sizea
ble current-account imbalances. For 
example, the current-account deficit is
 forecast at some 20% of GDP in 
Bulgaria and Latvia in 2008. Large external deficits and rising debts could, 

however, raise concerns about sust
ainability in case resources are not 
allocated to productivity-enhancing activities.  
Differences are, however, also large 
within the euro area. The current-
account deficits are substantial, e.g., 
in Greece, Spain and Portugal where, 
despite an economic slowdown, they ar
e expected to reach 10-15% of GDP 
in 2008. In these countries, rising exte
rnal debt service burdens imply a loss 
of domestically available income. In co
ntrast, large and increasing surpluses 
are projected for Germany and the Nether
lands (of 7-10% of GDP) as well as 
for Luxembourg and Austria (5-6% of GDP). There could be several reasons 

for these developments, including an in
creased divergence in competitiveness 
across euro-area countries, mirrored in losses or gains of market shares, or 

differences in consumption propensity (due e.g. to wealth effects). The 

ongoing financial market turmoil, by hampering the smooth flow of funds 

within the euro area and the EU, increases
 the risks for the financing of large 
current-account deficits. 
On the back of the good economic pe
rformance and structural adjustment, 
public finances improved markedly in 2007, with the general government 

budget deficit falling to 0.9% of GDP in the EU, down from 1.4% in 2006 

(and to 0.6% of GDP in the euro area, down from 1.3%). While the deficit 
thus declined for the fourth year in a ro
w, this trend is expected to reverse in 
2008, on account of slower output growth and tax cuts in some countries. The 

deficit is projected to rise by 0.3 pps. in the EU, to 1.2% of GDP, and by 0.4 

pps. in the euro area, to 1.0%. Based on the usual no-policy-change 

assumption, the deficit is forecast to 
remain broadly unchanged in both the 
EU and the euro area in 2009. 
The projected deterioration of the budgetary outlook for 2008 concerns most 
countries as only seven of the 27 EU 
Member States show improvements in 
the headline balances compared to 200
7. Forecasts for 2009 on unchanged 
policies suggest that eight countries will show an improvement in their 
headline balance. 
Six countries are currently in the ex
cessive deficit procedure (EDP). As 
concerns the two euro-area EDP countr
ies, Italy and Portugal, the 2007 
outcome confirms that the deficit has been brought below the 3% of GDP 

threshold. In Italy, the deficit is fo
recast to increase again over the forecast 
horizon, while remaining below the 3% threshold. In Portugal, after a further 

reduction in 2008, the deficit is expected to rebound to 2.6% of GDP in 2009 

in a no-policy change scenario. As in 
2007, no euro-area country is projected 
to have a budget deficit in excess of 3% of GDP in 2008.  
Outside the euro area, th
e budgetary outlook improved in all four EDP 
countries compared to th
e autumn forecast. In th
e Czech Republic, Poland 
and Slovakia, the 2007 deficit fell below the 3% of GDP reference value. The 

deficit is projected to decline furthe
r in the Czech Republic, to remain 
broadly unchanged in Slovakia, and to rebound to 2.5% in Poland in 2008.

Overview 
  9 Following a remarkable consolidation effort in 2007 and a smaller 
improvement expected in 
the current year, Hungary 
is forecast to post a 
deficit of 4% of GDP in 2008, which is
 projected to fall further in 2009.  
For France, the deficit outlook has dete
riorated compared
 to the autumn 
forecast and would reach 3% of GDP in 2009 with unchanged policy. In the 

UK, due to the worsened gr
owth outlook, the deficit 
is forecast to exceed the 
3% of GDP reference value in both of the financial years 2008/09 and 

2009/10. For Romania, despite a slight improvement of the fiscal outlook 

compared to the autumn forecast, the pr
ojections continue to show a strong 
widening of the deficit over the fo
recast period to 3.7% in 2009.  
Correcting for cyclical f
actors, one-offs and other temporary measures, the 
structural deficit also fell markedly: from 1½% of GDP in 2006 to 1% in the 

EU in 2007 (from 1¼% to ¾% in the euro area). While the good economic 

performance was helpful in improving public finances, the outcome shows 
that a large part of the consolidation was of a discretionary nature, reflecting 

largely prudent fiscal policies. It is possible, however, that the estimate for 

the structural balance overstates the strength of the underlying budgetary 

position, notably on account of temporar
y favourable revenue surprises over 
the past two years. Future revisions may therefore point to a less favourable 
underlying budgetary position.  
In 2008, the structural deficit is fore
cast to deteriorate by around ¼ pps. in 
both the EU and the euro area, in line with the headline balance. For 2009, 

however, on the back of a broadly unchanged headline balance combined 

with a projected output growth below potential, the structural deficit is 
forecast to improve slightly again in both areas.   
The general government gross debt ratio continues to decline, a trend that 
started in 2006. In the EU as a whole debt fell below the 60% of GDP 

reference value in 2007. After a temporary halt in 2008, the downward trend 

is expected to continue in 2009. In th
e euro area, between 
2007 and 2009, the 
debt ratio is expected to decrease by around 2 pps., to some 64¼% of GDP. 
Summing up, the economic outlook for th
e EU and the euro area is for a 
marked deceleration of GDP growth, do
wn from some 3% to around 2% in 
both 2008 and 2009 in the EU (and down to 1¾-1½% in the euro area), 
falling below potential. Although this implies a marked downward revision, it 

is far from a recession scenario. At the same time, inflation has been revised 
up by more than 1 pps. this year due to soaring food and energy prices.  
The economic situation and outlook is unusually uncertain at the current 
juncture. Even though some of the risks identified in the autumn forecast 

have materialised and others have been more extensively incorporated into 
the current outlook, downside risks prevail.  
As regards the growth outlook, the major downside risks relate to the still 
ongoing turmoil in the financial markets which may reinforce the US 

downturn further. The uncertainty remains large as regards the ultimate size 
and location of credit losses and significant disruption persists in some 

market segments. In spite of the impact of the financial distress on the real 

economy so far appearing limited in the EU, it cannot be ruled out that the 

lags are longer (or credit losses la
rger) than assumed and that credit 
conditions, credit availability and confidence may be more seriously affected. 

This would reinforce the ongoing correction of some housing markets, 

notably that of the US, but also with
in the EU (e.g. t
hose of Ireland and 
Improved structural 
deficit, but potentially 
overstated

for growth... 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  10 Spain) Œ and could trigger a more pronounced downturn in the housing 
markets of some other EU countries, with the subsequent risk of putting 

balance sheets under increasing strain. The risks stemming from imbalances 

in some of the countries 
with sizeable current-account 
deficits and/or external 
debts could be reinforced by shifts in risk preferences following a further 
deepening and/or widening of the financial crisis.  
Although the current outlook implies a marked improvement of global 
imbalances, with the US current-account deficit expected to fall to 4% of 

GDP in 2009, a disorderly unwinding of remaining imbalances cannot be 

excluded; and nor can the possibility that the adjustment of global growth and 
related exchange-rate developments could trigger protectionist measures.  
Future commodity prices could, as always, entail both positive and negative 
surprises. There are some upside risks related to the underlying strength of 

emerging economies, as well as the flexibility of the US economy and what 

impact the fiscal and monetary stimulus might have. Within the EU, the 

momentum in the labour market may also prove more sustained, which could 
support labour income and consumption to a greater extent.  
As regards the inflation outlook, the majo
r risk relates to the recent surge in 
energy and food prices. Although second-round effects appear limited so far, 

inflation expectations have increased slightly, in particular in some of the 
recently-acceded Member States, but al
so somewhat in the euro area. 
Together with a still tight labour market
 in some countries and sectors, wage 
increases could accelerate further, a
lthough for the tradeable sector, 
competitive pressures together with the cooling of world activity should limit 
the impact on wage growth.  
Overall, risks are more balanced 
than in the autumn 2007 forecast. 
Nonetheless, the balance of risks for the growth outlook continues to be tilted 

to the downside, especially for 2009, while the risks for inflation are 

somewhat on the upside, and, in partic
ular, for some of the recently-acceded 
Member States.  
...and upside risks for 
inflation... 
...although, overall, 
risks are better 
balanced  
Overview 
  11   Box 1: 
Some technicalities behind the forecast
The overall cut-off date to take new information 
into account when preparing this macroeconomic 
outlook is 15 April 2008. The forecast also 
incorporates validated public finance data from 

Eurostat's press release 54/2008, dated 18 April 
2008. 
External assumptions 
This forecast is based on a set of external 
assumptions, reflecting the market expectations at 
the time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions 
from possible volatility during one specific trading 

day, averages from a 10-day reference period (i.e. 
from 26 March to 8 April 2008) have been used for 
exchange and interest rates as well as for oil prices.  
Exchange and interest rates 
The technical assumption as regards exchange rates 
has been standardised using fixed nominal 
exchange rates for all currencies. This technical 

assumption leads to implied average USD/EUR 
rates of 1.37 in 2007, 1.55 in 2008 and 1.57 in 
2009, and average JPY/EUR rates of 161.3 in 2007, 
158.6 in 2008 and 158.9 in 2009. 
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based. Short-
term interest rates for the euro area are derived 
from future contracts. Long-term interest rates for 
the euro area, as well as short- and long-term 

interest rates for other Member States, are 
calculated using implicit forward swap rates, 
corrected for the spread between the 3-month inter-
bank interest rate and the 3-month swap rate. In 
cases where no market instrument is available, a 
fixed spread vis-à-vis euro-area interest rates is 

taken for both short- and long-term rates. As a 
result, short-term interest rates are expected at 
4.3% on average in 2007, 4.3% in 2008 and 3.8% 
in 2009 in the euro area. Long-term interest rates 
are assumed at 4.2%, in 2007, and 4.0% in 2008 
and 2009. 
Commodity prices 
Commodity-price assumptions are also, to the 
extent possible, based on market conditions, c.f. 
table 62. In the case of oil prices special attention is 
paid to futures' prices. Prices for Brent oil are, 
accordingly, projected to be 72.5 USD/bl in 2007, 
101.2 USD/bl in 2008 and 100.0 in 2009. This 

would correspond to an oil price of 52.9 EUR/bl. in 
2007, 65.3 EUR/bl. in 2008 and 63.7 EUR/bl. in 
2009. 
Budgetary data  
Data up to 2007 are based on government debt and 

deficit data notified by Member States to the 

European Commission in April 2008. In validating 
these data, Eurostat has made the following 
reservation: 'Eurostat is in the process of clarifying, 

in close co-operation with the Greek statistical 
authorities, some issues relating to the recording of 
EU grants in 2006 and 2007, the existence of a 
substantial statistical discrepancy in 2007 of 0.6% 
of GDP and the insufficient coverage of source data 
for extra-budgetary funds, local government and 

social security funds achieved for the first estimate 
of the 2007 balance'. 
Moreover, Eurostat has, as usual, amended the 
deficit data notified by the United Kingdom for 
years 2004 to 2007 for consistency of recording of 
UMTS licences proceeds. Reported debt figures 
were kept unchanged. 
In addition, Eurostat noted that the recent events in 
the financial markets, as well as the interventions 
of governments in support of affected financial 
institutions directly or indirectly, have raised a 
number of national accounting issues, which will 
be addressed with the concerned Member States in 

the coming weeks.  Eurostat also announced that it 
is in the process of clarifying the accounting 
treatment of flows and debt relating to public 

infrastructure investments, as well as the sector 
classification of the concerned public units. 
For 2008, budgets adopted or presented to national 
parliaments and all other measures known in 
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. For 

2009, the 'no-policy-change' assumption used in the 
forecasts implies the extrapolation of revenue and 
expenditure trends and the inclusion of measures 
that are known in sufficient detail.  
The general government balances reported by 
Member States to the European Commission may 
be slightly different from those published in the 
national accounts. The difference concerns 

settlements under swaps and forward rate 
agreements (FRA). According to ESA95 (amended 
by regulation No 2558/2001), swaps and FRA-
related swaps are financial transactions and 
therefore excluded from the calculation of the 
government balance. However, for the purposes of 

the excessive deficit procedure, those flows are still 
booked as interest.

Calendar effects on GDP growth and output 
gaps 
The number of working days may differ from one 
year to another. For 2005 and 2006, the effects 

were negative around -0.1 pp. each year, while they 
are estimated to be close to neutral in 2007. The 
Commission's annual GDP forecasts are not 
adjusted for the number of working days, while 
quarterly forecasts are. As 2008 is a leap year, the 
working-day adjustment is positive, estimated at 

around 0.1 pp. for the euro area.   
The calculation of potential growth and the output 
gap does not adjust for working days. Since it is 
considered temporary, it should not affect the 
cyclically-adjusted balances. 
   Chapter 1 Current international developments and prospects   1. CLOUDS ARE GATHERING OVER THE GLOBAL 
ECONOMY    15 The outlook for the global economy remains 
unusually uncertain, as several headwinds continue 

to threaten world growth. First, the risk of 

recession of the US economy has begun to 

materialise; second, the financial turmoil is still 

on-going with many banks severely affected by 

losses and write-downs; thir
d, commodity prices Œ 
for oil, food and metals Œ are soaring. However, 

global growth has proved relatively resilient so far, 

as the emerging economies continue to expand at a 

buoyant pace.  All in all, world GDP growth (excluding the EU) is 
projected to slow to 4.4% in 2008 and 4.2% in 

2009, after 5.2% in 2007. This is markedly less 

than expected in the autu
mn forecast, even when 
excluding the impact of the revision of purchasing 

power parities which lowered growth by about ½ 

pp. during 2005-2007 (see Box 1.1.1). However, 

world growth is now in line with its long-term 

average, which is outstanding given the sluggish 

US GDP growth. As a matte
r of fact, the emerging 
economies now contribute to about 60% of the 

world GDP growth. Nevertheless, these economies 

also face challenges which ha
ve proved difficult to 
overcome in the past: a contraction of exports to 

the US, a generalised movement of flight-to-

quality on financial markets and, last but not least, 

a (possible) resurgence of 
inflation. As a result, 
risks are clearly tilted to the downside as regards 

the outlook for the global growth.  
The US economy faces a risk of recession – In the last quarter of 2007, GDP growth dropped to 

a rate of 0.1%, down from 0.9% and 1.2% in the 

previous two quarters. The contraction in the 

housing sector continues to deepen, triggering 

spill-over effects on consumption.  
Housing starts are now less than half what they 
were at their peak, while
 manufacturing output has 
declined since the end of
 2007. As a result, the 
labour market weakened significantly in the first 

quarter of 2008 with falling employment and a 

rising unemployment rate. Real consumption has 

stagnated in response to the softening labour 

market, soaring inflation, deteriorating credit 

conditions, and negative wealth effects stemming 

from falling house and stock prices. Consumer 
confidence, at 112.6 last July, collapsed to 64.5 in 
March. 
These developments are expected to persist: 
inflation - at 4.0% yoy in March - is being fuelled 

by higher energy prices and food prices, while the 

weakness of the dollar pushes up the price of 

imports. As for house prices, their decline is 

causing new delinquencies on home loans, leading 

to tighter credit conditions and a further decline in 

house prices. In order 
to break this spiral, 
monetary policy has been loosened aggressively 

since last August, as the federal funds target rate 

has been lowered by 300 basis points to 2.25%. In 

addition, a fiscal package, consisting mainly of 

rebates in personal income taxes, was enacted to 

provide households with additional purchasing 

power equivalent to about 1% of GDP around mid-

year. Despite the policy stimulus, the outlook for 2008 
and 2009 is bleak. GDP growth is now projected to 

be 0.9% for 2008 and 0.7% for 2009 which is 

respectively 0.8 pp and 1.9 pps. lower than in the 

autumn forecast. The first reason for this is that the 

housing crisis and its financial fallout is now 

considered likely to exert a heavier drag on the 

broader economy than previously expected. 

Second, this projection takes into account the surge 

in commodity prices, whic
h was not expected last 
autumn. Against this background, and taking into 

account the sharp improvemen
t in net exports, the 
current account deficit is set to narrow from 5.1% 

in 2007 to 4.0 in 2009. This improvement is 

obtained by solidly growing exports and a sharp 

slowdown in import volumes. The latter are set to 

grow by only 0.9% in 2008 and to contract by 

0.5% in 2009. Therefore, a certain reduction of 

global imbalances would be achieved, but at the 

expense of global growth. While they have proved 

resilient so far, a severe and protracted slowdown 

in US imports will also affect the emerging 

economies, especially t
hose, like China, whose 
growth is, to a large extent, based on exports.  
In conjunction with the monetary policy easing, 
the deteriorating US outlook has entailed a further 

weakening of the US dolla
r against the euro. The 
euro stood at 1.58 USD on 15 April 2008, which is 

about 17% higher than one year ago. As a result, 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  16 the export shares of the euro area to the US could 
be reduced further, which would particularly 

weigh on growth in the 
countries where they are 
high, Ireland in particular, though also, to a lesser 

extent, Germany, Italy and France. This risk is 

reinforced by the fact 
that the euro has also 
appreciated against the UK
 pound and the Chinese 
renminbi. Of the main currencies, only the 

Japanese yen has gained some ground against the 

euro, coming back close to
 its level of one year 
ago, at 159 euro on 1 April 2008.

 – which feeds the financial turmoil – With mounting delinquencies in the US mortgage 
market, US banks have continued to report losses 

which, in some cases, have
 been large enough to 
endanger their solvency. 
In addition, the slowdown 
of the US economy has pushed up risk premia on 

the credit markets, especially for the lowest 

ratings. Due to the fact that many international 

banks and financial institutions have bought 

financial products linked to mortgage loans and 

other risky assets, this decline in confidence has 

spread throughout the global market. 
The flight-to-quality rush is particularly striking in 
the euro area inter-bank market, where the spread 

between the key interest rate - the minimal rate of 

submission to the main refinancing operation Œ and 

the 3-month EURIBOR remains high. While it had 

narrowed to 30 basis points (bp) at the mid-

January, it has widened to about 75 bp by the mid-

April, after the announcement of the difficulties of 

the US-based investment bank Bear Sterns. This 

phenomenon is striking since the level of excess 

reserves is not higher than usual, suggesting an 

absence of a liquidity squeeze. Such high spreads 

mainly reflect a rising perception of counterparty 

risk which makes banks reluctant to lend money 
without sound collateral in return. The declining 
risk appetite is also visible on the bond market, 

where the yield spreads between corporate and 

government bond have increased on all the ratings.

conditions has been moderated by a decrease in 

long-term interest rates, following the aggressive 

easing of US monetary policy and the downward 

revisions of growth expectations. On 15 April, the 

US 10-year rate was at 3.60%, i.e. about 90 bp 

below its autumn level. In the euro area, the 

decline has been less pronounced, as growth 

expectations have been revised more moderately. 

On 15 April, the 10-year rate stood at 3.97%, about

Stock prices on world markets
 – while commodity prices are soaring  Commodity prices have increased to new all-time 
highs, in food, oil and metal. This has not only 

pushed up production costs, but could also 

endanger price stability. Therefore, many central 

banks are facing the challenge of having to deal 

with both a bleak outlook and resurgent inflation 

simultaneously. 
Oil prices are now around USD 110 per barrel, 
which represents a rise of about 60% since last 

year, and about 20% since la
st autumn. Even if the 
weakness of the US dollar has played a role in this 

appreciation, the rise still remains significant in 

euro. With the price of oil standing at about EUR 

68 per barrel, this puts th
e increase at about 35% in 
one year and 15% since the autumn forecast. The 

main reasons of the increase have not 

fundamentally changed since last autumn. From 

the supply-side, the OPEC
 countries are unwilling 
to increase their production and geopolitical 

tensions are still strong. In addition, US crude 

stockpiles remain low, while bottlenecks persist in 

the refinery process. From the demand-side, world 

demand is expected to grow quickly in the medium 

term, though the turndown in global growth could 

also help to contain prices in the short run.

Food prices have also soared recently. In 2007, 
they have increased by a
bout 20% in USD, and are 
expected to increase by 
about 40% in 2008. The 
rise is driven by cereals and dairy products which 

have more than doubled since mid-2006. These 

developments have mainly been triggered by short-

term factors, such as weather-related shortfalls. 

However, long-term factors have also played a 

role, especially a growing population and an 

increasing demand for higher value-added food in 

some catching-up countries and a rising demand 

for biofuels. Lastly, mineral and metal prices are 

also on a rising trend, with
 an increase of 13.5% in 
2007, after about 50% in 2006 and 25% in 2005. 

Geopolitical tensions partly explain this 

phenomenon, but the growing demand from 

developing countries should not been overlooked. 

In 2008, mineral and metal prices are expected to 

increase further, by about 10 %. 
However, growth continues to be buoyant, 
while slowing somewhat, in emerging 

economies – In spite of the bleak US outlook, world growth

the weight of emerging c

 In China
, GDP growth increased to 11.9% yoy in 
2007, from 11.6% in 2006. The key factors behind 

this higher-than-expected growth were net 

merchandise exports and a reacceleration of 

investment in fixed assets. However, economic 

growth is expected to 
ease to 10.0% in 2008 and 
about 9.1% in 2009, compared to 10.3% and 9.9% 

respectively in the 2007 au
tumn forecast. This is 
due firstly to the People's Bank of China 

continuing to tighten monetary policy in the face 

of strong consumer price inflation of about 7% in 

2007, with a further rise in both interest rates and 

the reserve requirement ratio. A second reason is 

the contraction in US imports, which can be 

expected to affect Chinese exports which make up 

one third of the China's total GDP. However, this 

scenario is also associated 
with upside risks, as the 
various measures to curb investment, including 

administrative steps, have proved relatively 

inefficient so far. As for exports, despite the slight 

appreciation of the renminbi, China could continue 

to win new market shares in world trade. 
While growth in 
India
 is also projected to 
moderate somewhat over the forecast period (from 

8.4% in 2007 to 8.0% in 2008 and 2009), it is still 

strong, owing to the continued strength of 

domestic demand. However, even though fears of 

overheating have receded, wholesale price 

inflation has picked up recently to above 6%. 

Further downside risks remain to the economic 

outlook. These include a further softening of 

external demand and consumption (owing to lags 

in the cycle of previous monetary tightening and 

the trend appreciation of 
the rupee against the US 
dollar) as well as high international crude oil 
prices.  In the 
rest of Asia
 (excluding Japan), GDP growth 
is supported by a buoyant domestic demand and 

should therefore deceler
ate only gradually. In 
Indonesia, it is expected to fall back to 6.1% in 

2008 and 6.0% in 2009, from 6.3% in 2007. In 

Malaysia, the economy could continue to expand 

at a pace of about 5% over the forecast horizon. In 

Korea, thanks to a diversification in the export 

base, growth is expected to moderate only slightly, 

to 4.7% in 2008 and 4.8% in 2009 after 5.0% in 

2007. 
In Russia
, real GDP is estimated to have expanded 
by 8.1% in 2007, after 7.4% in 2006, which in 

itself was an upward revision. This acceleration is 

explained by higher domestic demand, especially 

investment. While the latter was supported by a 

significant increase in net capital inflows and 

booming oil revenues, private consumption 

expanded due to a stronger labour market and 

rising wages. For 2008 and 2009, GDP growth is 

expected to be at above 7%. In the other CIS 

countries, economic growth is foreseen to average 

8% in 2008 and 2009, after about 9% in 2007, 

reflecting the strong performance of its second 

biggest economy, 
Ukraine (7.3% in 2007) and 
continuing strong growth in the third and fourth 

largest economies of the 
region, Kazakhstan and 
Belarus. 
In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA),
 annual GDP growth is estimated to remain robust 
at around 6% in 2008 and 2009, after 5.2% in 

2007. Oil-importing countries should continue to 

perform better than most 
oil-exporting countries, 
due to the positive impact of past structural 

reforms. Growth in Saudi Arabia weakened in 

2007, but is expected to rebound to 6%, in 2008, 

driven by higher energy prices. The same applies 

to the United Arab Emirates and the other energy 

exporting countries, including Iran. In the other 

countries of the MENA region, the stimulation of 

growth will come mainly from buoyant foreign 

direct and portfolio investment inflows.  
In Latin America
, economic growth is estimated 
to have reached 5.3% last
 year, almost matching 
the performance in 2006. In spite of the turmoil in 

world financial markets, 
Latin American countries 
as a whole experienced very favourable 

developments in 2007, characterised by a 

combination of a current account surplus (0.7% of 
Current developments and prospects 
  19 GDP), improving terms of trade (+2.6%), an 
ongoing decrease in unemployment and a primary 

surplus in public budgets (2.2% of GDP). Due to 

the strong inflow of private capital to the region, 

currencies were undergoing
 pressure to appreciate. 
This led to a considerable
 (3.5% of GDP) increase 
in foreign exchange re
serves, allowing for a 
reduction in external debt. These developments 

appear to have put the region as a whole on a much 

better footing to weathe
r the expected global 
slowdown than in similar situations in the past.  
However, there is no denying that some countries 
of the region seem particularly vulnerable to the 

stagnation in US import, especially Mexico whose 

export base is almost exclusively made of US 

imports. A reversal in capital inflows, such as 

those which occurred in the past, would also have 

recessive effects on the economies of the region. 

Lastly, developments in commodity prices 

constitute a downside risk for some countries. At 

the same time, other countr
ies, such as Brazil, are 
clearly benefiting from the increase in commodity 

prices. For the region as a whole, GDP growth is 

expected to slow to 4.3% in 2008 and to 4.0% in 

2009. 
In 2007, GDP growth in 
sub-Saharan Africa
 reached 6.5%, after 6.1% 
in 2006. Oil production 
gained strength in several countries, notably in 

Angola and Sudan. In oil-importing countries, 

growth was boosted by higher (non-oil) 

commodity prices, improved macro-economic 

stability, increased openness and recovery from 

drought in many areas. Debt relief and rising 

private capital inflows also contributed positively 

to growth. Consumer price inflation (excluding 

hyperinflation in Zimbabwe) accelerated 

moderately to 7.6% from 6.9% in 2006, reflecting 

increased pass-through from higher energy and 

food prices. These trends 
are likely to continue in 
2008, as growth is expected to edge up to 6.7%, 

before slowing down to around 6% in 2009 when 

exports are projected to moderate.  
.. and to be proving resilient in most other trade 
partners of the EU   In Japan
, GDP growth decelerated from an 
average of 2.4% in 2006 to 2.0% in 2007. This 

slowdown is expected to continue in the near 

future, with a GDP growth set to drop to 1.2% for 

2008 and 1.1% for 2009. Household consumption 

is anticipated to remain sluggish, while Japanese 

firms are also expected to
 remain cautious in their 
investment plans over the course of the year. 
Business investment is expected to rebound 

afterwards and support domestic demand. As for 

external trade, the US import stagnation should 

further curb Japan's export growth. So far, exports 

to Asia have compensated for this loss, but this 

will only be sustainable if the non-US trading 

partner economies hold up.  
In Canada
, the economy is benefiting from high 
commodity prices and robust domestic demand 

growth, but the slowdown 
in the US and the recent 
appreciation of the Canadian dollar should bring 

about an accelerating declin
e in real net exports 
this year, resulting in a decline in GDP growth 

from 2.7% in 2007 to 1.5% in 2008 and 1.9% in 

2009.

 long-term economic expansion 
looks set to continue, w
ith the economy expected 
to grow by 4.2% in 2007 and by 3.5% in 2008 and

including rising employment and real wages, 

should support domestic demand. After 

experiencing a recovery in 2007, 
New Zealand's
 economy is expected to decelerate slightly due to 

the economic slowdown in the US and decreasing 

business confidence. The annual growth rates for 

2008 and 2009 could remain below 2%.  
Among the EFTA countries, 
the
 Swiss 
economy 
should slow gradually over
 the forecast horizon, in 
a context of tighter monetary policy and slightly 

less buoyant international environment
. In 2007 
GDP growth is estimated at 3.1%, reflecting a 

strong external demand and a healthy business 

environment. For the years 
2008 and 2009 a return 
to more moderate growth rates is expected at 2.2% 

for both years. In
 Norway
, real GDP growth is 
also expected to deceler
ate to 2.5% in 2008 and 
2.1% in 2009, from 3.5% in 2007. Domestic 

activity will continue to be the main driver of 

growth in the forecast years, supported by strong 

private consumption, partly due to low interest 

rates. However, the large volumes of investment in 

the oil and gas sector that were spurred by soaring 

oil prices are expected to come to completion in 

the course of 2008, causi
ng a further deceleration 
in investment growth. Lastly, in 
Iceland, an 
investment boom helped
 GDP growth to reach 
4.2% in 2006 but it subsequently fell to 2.7 % in 

2007. Looking forward, a gradual declined is 

expected with a growth of 1.3% in 2008 and 0.4% 

in 2009.

Turkey
, which accounts for more than 90% of this country 

group, private consumption and investment slowed 

sharply, reflecting monetary tightening, the end of 

the election-related boom in public spending and 

bad weather conditions during the summer 

affecting the agricultural sector. For 2008 and 

2009, a moderate recovery is likely, which could 

bring GDP growth in this group of country back to 

4½% - 5%, from 4.6% in 2007. In

likely. After years of weak growth, economic

Current developments and prospects 
  21  Box 1.1.1: 
Updated estimates of Purchasing Power Parities lower global growth
The International Comparison Programme (ICP), a 
joint project by the World Bank, Eurostat and 
OECD, has released new Purchasing Power Parity 
(PPP) exchange rates for 146 countries. These are 
used to calculate the relative size of individual 
economies and aggregate to world GDP. They are 
based on the price levels of year 2005 and replace 
previous estimates from 1993. Using these new 
PPP exchange rates entails a downward revision of 

world GDP growth by around ½ pp. each year 
during 2002-07, as the relative share of the fastest-
growing economies has been lowered slightly. 
PPP exchange rates reflect relative prices of 
goods and services but they are difficult to 

compute 
The PPP exchange rate is defined as the rate at 
which the currency of a country would have to be 

converted into that of a reference country to buy 

the same amount of goods and service in each 
country. Therefore, it can deviate by a large amount 
from the market exchange rate, especially in the 

short run: while PPP exchange rates depend on the 

relative developments in consumer prices between 

countries, the developments in market exchange 
rates depend on international trade and capital 
flows.  
As a result, PPP exchange rates are less volatile 
than market exchange rates, a key point when the 
purpose is to assess the respective size of 
economies. A further advantage of PPP exchange 
rates is to cover all the goods and services of a 

reference basket, including those which are non-
tradable such as hair dressers. However, PPP 
exchange rates are difficult to compute, as they 
require, for all countries, the construction of a 
reference basket of goods and services. The latest 
assessment of PPP exchange rates was carried out 
in 1993. Improvements introduced by the new PPP 

update and enlarge this basket to more than 1000 
goods and services, and benefit from the 
participation of China in the survey programme for 
the first time. 
With the new PPP exchange rates, the relative 
size of some emerging economies has been 
lowered 
The new PPP exchanges entail a downward 
revision of the share of emerging economies, for 

both structural and statistical reasons. In 
developing countries, the change in relative price 
can be relatively fast due to the productivity gains 

in the manufacturing sector. As a result, the 

structure of consumption expenditures changes and 
the reference basket becomes less representative. In 
addition, previous estimates for the Chinese PPP 
exchan
ge rates were sim
ply extra
polated fro
ma bilateral comparison of 1986 prices between China 
and the United States. This proved to be an 

inaccurate guide, as by applying the PPP 
methodology, the size of China has shrunk by 
nearly 40%. The sizes of other large emerging 
economies have also been revised, down by 37% 
for India and 10% for Brazil, but up by 7% for 
Russia.

size in the world GDP, from 26.5% to 20.2% for 
year 2005, results in a lowered world GDP growth 
by about ½ pp, at 4.7% (including the EU), instead 
of 5.2% with old PPP exchange rates. For the 

forecast horizon, the impact of the downside 

revision is also about ½ pp.

However, the share of emerging economies in 
the world output is on a rising trend 
With globalisation and the resulting productivity 
gains in the emerging economies, the developing 

countries are engaged in a catching-up process. For 

years, their potential growth is higher than that of 
the industrialized countries by several percentage 
points. As a result, even if their share in the world 

output has been revised down, it is still growing 
and will do as long as the catching-up process 
prevails. For instance, if China continues to expand 
at the same pace as today, its economy will have 

overtaken that of the USA around year 2020.  
However, the gap in terms of GDP per capita 
remains considerable between emerging and 
industrialized countries. While the Chinese GDP is 
half of the US GDP, its GDP per capita is only the 
tenth of that of the US. Such differences in living 
standards suggest that the catching-up process is 
likely to continue for a long time.  
   Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU   1. RESILIENT GROWTH IN THE FACE OF HEADWINDS 
   25 Softening of solid growth Following strong economic activity in 2006, the 
economy of the European Union continued to 

expand at a healthy pace 
in 2007. GDP growth was 
2.6% in the euro area and 2.8% in the EU, in line 

with the autumn 2007 forecast and above trend-

growth for the second year in a row. The output 

gap moved into positive territory (at about 1/3 pp. 

in both the euro area and 
the EU) for the first time 
since 2002.  
In the first half of 2007, output growth even 
reached an annualised 3% in the EU, moderating 

to 2.7% in the second half (from 2.8% to 2.4% in 

the euro area). The so
ftening of the growth 
momentum reflected severa
l factors, including a 
general deterioration in external conditions, 

surging commodity prices and continued 

turbulence in financial markets.

Composition of growth in 2007 - euro area
(Quarter-on-quarter % ch.)
(Contributions in pp.)
 World trade growth has continued to decelerate 
during 2007, averaging 6.8% on the year as a 

whole compared to 9.5%
 in 2006. The loss in 
import momentum was broad-based although 

sharper in industrial coun
tries than in emerging 
economies. The euro has strengthened. In nominal 

effective terms, it has appreciated by 2.4% in 

2007, mostly in the second half of the year. The 

redirection of EU exports to fast growing markets 

in recent years has limited the negative effects of 

the slowdown in the US and other developed 
economies. But, the negative impact on euro-area 
exports is likely to be larger in the future than it 

has been in the recent past, due to the usual lags in 

the reaction of trade to exchange rate 

developments and cooling global growth. 
Both food and oil prices increased sharply last year 
(by 19.1% and 9.5%, respectively, in USD) and the 

rise is proving to be more persistent than expected. 

Thanks to the appreciation of the euro, the euro-

area's terms of trade did not deteriorate in 2007, 

preventing a drain on national income. But adverse 

commodity developments have had a substantial 

impact on headline inflation, pushing it above 3% 

towards the end of the year, and curbing the 

purchasing power of households.  
The extent to which the financial turbulence has 
spilled over into the real economy is difficult to 

assess, as the EU economy has been hit 

simultaneously by a number of shocks. However, 

the financial turmoil has led to a tightening of 

financial conditions. The flight to quality has led to 

a widening of spreads on government bonds rates 

since July 2007, by 50 basis points for short-term 

interest rates and more moderately Œ by 20 basis 

points - for long-term interest rates. Collateral 

requirements have also tightened.  
Sluggish labour income behind weak 
consumption –.. As regards the composition of GDP growth, the 
contribution of domestic demand weakened in 

2007, in particular in the euro area (to 2.2 pp. 

compared to 2.6 pp. in 2006), while the 

contribution of net trade strengthened (to 0.4 pp. 

from 0.2 pp. in 2006) despite the appreciation of 

the euro.  Private consumption contributed 1.2% to GDP 
growth in the EU in 2007, but only 0.9 pp. in the 

euro area. The sizeable contraction of private 

consumption in Germany in the first quarter of 

2007 due to VAT-related effects and poor 

performance in the following quarters weighed on 

euro-area household spending in 2007. That said, 

euro-area private consumption has been on a 

modest growth path since 2002, posting an average 

growth rate of only 1.4% between 2002 and 2007, 

significantly below the 2.5% rate of growth 

recorded between 1996 an
d 2001. An analysis of 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  26 the dynamics of euro-area consumption across 
similar expansion phases confirms that the 

weakness of household spending is a specific 

characteristic of the current cycle as a whole and 

not only of 2007. Four y
ears after the start of the 
current recovery (2003Q3)
, the level of private 
consumption is currently about 3.5 pps. below the 

average level recorded in previous expansion 

phases. 
The weakness of private consumption in recent 
years has gone hand in hand with a subdued 

performance by disposable 
income, by far the most 
important determinant of household spending. 

Diverging developments between these two 

variables in the short-term are possible, but there is 

a long-term tendency of consumption and 

disposable income to move together. Weak 

disposable income, rising at an average annual 

pace of only 1.5% betwee
n 2002 and 2007 (down 
from 2.5% during the period 1996-2001), simply 

did not allow for a stronger consumption dynamic.

 In particular, labour income was dragged down by 
the low growth in real wa
ges. Average quarter-on-
quarter growth in real compensation per head was 

slightly negative during this recovery (-0.1%) and 

largely positive during previous upswings 

(+0.3%). This has helped improve euro-area 

competitiveness, but depressed household income. 

By contrast, employment gains have been 

somewhat stronger in the current upturn than 

during previous recoveries (0.3% qoq compared to 

0.2%). In 2007, the labour market has continued to 

support household income, with employment 

expanding (by around 1½% in both the euro area 

and the EU) and the unemployment rate reaching a 

15-year low (7.4% in the euro area and 7.1% in the 

EU).   A rise in the household saving ratio from 13.9% in 
2006 to 14.5% in 2007 further depressed 

consumption in the euro area. Rising inflation 

perceptions may have had an adverse impact on 

consumption and saving propensity. And if so, the 

recent jump in headline inflation and the related 

upward movement in inflation expectations could 

result in a higher saving rate going forward. This, 

together with the reduction of the purchasing 

power of households, does not bode well for 

consumption in the quarters ahead.  
–while investment has so far maintained its 
growth momentum A more positive development in 2007 was the 
continued strong growth in investment spending. 

Gross fixed capital formation rose by 4.3% last 

year in the euro area (5
.4% in the EU), following 
the robust performance of 5% in 2006 (5.6% in the 

EU). When compared to average growth rates 

between 1997 and 2006 of 3.1% in the euro area 

and 3.5% in the EU, the figures for investment 

growth in 2007 stand out. In a cyclical perspective, 

capital spending has now outpaced the level 

reached in previous expa
nsion phases by about 5 
pps.  
In 2007, the positive performance of gross fixed 
capital formation can be ascribed to both 

equipment and construction investment, the former 

expanding by 6.1%, the latter by 3.2%, thus well 

above the average growth for 1997-2006 of, 

respectively, 4.4% and 1.6%. 
However, construction investment experienced a 
significant deceleration in the second half of 2007. 

The year-on-year growth rate came down from 

5.1% in 07H1 to 2.3% in 07H2. During the same 

period, growth in equipment investment 

accelerated from 4.9% to 5.
3%. It is therefore, the 
weaker investment in construction (which amounts 

to around 50% of total investment in the euro area) 

which can be responsible for the deceleration in 

overall gross fixed capital formation towards the 

end of the year. This largely reflects the cooling-

off of the housing market in several euro-area 

countries, most notably in Spain and Ireland. A 

clear indication is the substantial fall in building 

permits by more than 20% since January 2006 in 

the euro area. 
According to investment surveys, demand factors 
are the key driving forces of industrial investment. 

Above potential GDP growth in the last two years 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  27 has therefore fuelled capital spending. The degree 
of capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector 

has steadily increased sin
ce the beginning of 2006, 
reaching the same level as 
the peak of the previous 
cycle in the second quarte
r of 2007. Although it 
has since been declining, its level of 84.2 for 2007 

as a whole was well above its long-term average 

(81.9%).

gross operating surplus (in % of nominal GDP)
Graph 2.1.2:
Consumption and disposable income, euro area
 The healthy financial position of the non-financial 
corporate sector is another factor contributing to 

the strong growth in equipment investment in 

2007. The share of gross operating surplus (a good 

proxy for profits) of nonfinancial corporations has 

been on the rise for several years and it stood at 

39% of value added in 2007, a record high.  
Efforts to modernise the capital stock have also 
underpinned investment. The contribution to 

potential growth of capital deepening and total 

factor productivity has improved in 2006-2007         

- admittedly - only moderately by 0.2 pp., but 

nevertheless interrupting a prolonged downward 

trend. The trend in labour-productivity
1 has also 
improved or at least ceased to deteriorate, 

according to a recent DG ECFIN research. 
On the negative side, the rise in oil prices in 2007 
and the tightening of credit conditions since the 

start of the financial turmoil may have had a 

dampening impact on capital spending. However, 

high profitability has allowed companies to absorb 

the oil price shock more easily than in the past. As 

for interest rates, their current level, especially on 

the long-end, remains low by historical standards, 

as confirmed by the sustained growth in loans to 

non-financial corporations (at a record high in 

February 2008). In addition, a large share of

investment can be financed by means of generated 
cash flows, making euro-area firms less dependent 

on prevailing financing conditions, at least 

temporarily 
Heterogeneous country performances Growth rates continue to vary across EU Member 

States. The dispersion of annual GDP growth 

across EU countries has remained almost 

unchanged between 1996 and 2005 and has 

slightly increased in the last two years. This 

development is primarily due to significant 

heterogeneity in trend GDP growth rates. This 

partly reflects a catchin
g-up process of some 
economies, particularly 
those of the recently-
acceded Member States. In
 fact, in 2007 the 
growth rate of potential GDP in the EU was about 

¼ pp higher than in the euro
 area, with that of the 
new EU Member States sign
ificantly above that of 
the euro-area average. 
Some heterogeneity in 
country's performance is vi
sible also in the larger 
euro-area Member States. 
In recent years, Spain 
(together with some of the smaller economies such 

as Ireland, Finland Portugal and Greece) has 

recorded GDP growth ra
tes well above the euro-
area average, France GDP has expanded in line 

with the euro area and, Ge
rmany and, in particular, 
Italy well below. Again, these different 

performances are backed by differences in 

potential output growth. Looking ahead, however, 

the relative positions of some of these countries are 

set to shift (see also section 2.3). 
By contrast, cyclical 
developments across EU 
countries appear more synchronised. The 

dispersion of output gaps in the EU has halved 

between 2003 and 2007, declining from an average 

standard deviation of 0.8 pp. in 2003-2005 to 

around 0.4 pp. in 2006-2007. A similar pattern is 

envisaged in the four largest euro-area economies 

(Germany, France, Italy and Spain).  
That said, quarterly GDP growth rates in the euro 
area were less uniform in 2007 than in 2006. The 

increased dispersion is likely to reflect the varying 

degrees of vulnerabilities in different countries. On 

the one hand, Germany appears more resilient and 

less exposed to current headwinds in credit and 

housing markets. On the other hand, both France 

and Italy suffer from a weak external competitive 

position, Italy also suffers from weak domestic 

demand, while both Spain and the UK are more 

exposed to a downturn in the housing market 

reinforced by the financial distress. 
2. UNFOLDING FINANCIAL CRISIS POSES RISKS 
   28 Crisis ongoing The international financial system remains in a 
state of crisis, with banks in the most developed 

economies unwilling to lend to each other on an 

unsecured basis. Several other key credit markets 

are either malfunctioning or dislocated. The 

fragility of the situation was underlined by the 

near-collapse of Bear Stearns in March, when US 

authorities intervened to orchestrate an emergency 

takeover of the liquidity-constrained investment 

bank. As Bear Stearns had announced a solid 

liquidity position only two days earlier, it is clear 

that banks remain highly vulnerable to adverse 

market sentiment, which may or may not be 

justified.

 In recent weeks, strains have re-emerged in the 
interbank markets, with all major central banks 

injecting additional liquidity in an effort to ensure 

market functioning and keep market interest rates 

in line with policy rates. The liquidity measures 

have had limited effect so far, partly due to 

pending financial reporting deadlines and partly 

due to concerns about counterparty risk among 

banks. The US Federal Reserve has created several 

new facilities allowing banks Œ and for the first 

time also investment banks Œ to access liquidity in 

exchange for an increasingly broad array of 

collateral, including highly-rated asset-backed 

securities. The ECB has always accepted asset-

backed securities as collateral for its lending 

operations.   
Uncertainty about counterparty risk among banks 
arises from their growing credit losses, of which 

more than USD 200 billion have been disclosed so 
far. There is a concern among investors that 
substantially more losses may be disclosed in the 

future, as problems in sub-prime mortgage markets 

have spread to other credit markets, e.g. credit 

cards, car loans, and corporate loans to highly 

indebted borrowers (leveraged loans). Concerns 

remain about the possible downgrading of 

monoline insurers and the associated risk that 

some sellers of credit insurance may not be able to 

honour their commitments in the now vast 

(USD 40 trillion) market 
for credit default swaps 
(CDS). In such an event, the consequence would 

be further losses, uncertainty and higher risk 

premia. In addition, major banks, which are big 

players in the CDS market, could be at risk.  
In another development, investors have begun to 
discriminate between countries on the basis of 

their relative funding needs and perceived 

riskiness. This has been reflected in emerging- 

market bond spreads. So far, investor concern has 

been concentrated on Iceland and, to a lesser 

extent, Turkey but market commentary 

increasingly points also to the Baltics and some 

other new Member States such as Romania, 

Bulgaria and Hungary. Investor discrimination has 

even caused government bond spreads within the 

euro area to widen to the 
highest levels since the 
euro's introduction in 1999. While credit-risk 

spreads were unusually narrow before the current 

crisis, there is now a risk of over-shooting, similar 

to that observed in other areas of the credit market.  
As a result of the deepening and broadening credit 
problems, there is a growing perception that the 

financial crisis will now last at least until the end 

of 2008, a marked change 
from earlier, when there 
was a consensus that the worst would be over in 

the first quarter of 2008.  
Lending flows still generally robust Despite the ongoing financial crisis, bank lending 

to the private sector remain
s brisk, at least in the 
euro area. The year-on-year 
growth rate of loans to 
non-financial corporate fi
rms reached a new record 
high of 14.8% in February. Non-financial 

corporate loan growth is 
also strong in the UK. In 
contrast, loan growth to the household sector in the 

euro area is deceleratin
g Œ continuing a trend 
already in place before the crisis began. The 

growth rate of loans for house purchases was 6.7% 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  29 in February, which is a 15-year low. Mortgage 
loan growth is also d
ecelerating in the UK.  
The robustness of bank lending is surprising 
against the background of turmoil in financial 

markets and survey evid
ence of a significant 
tightening in lending standards. On the basis of 

available lending data, it would seem that any 

slowdown in credit is driven more by a decline in 

demand than by constraints on supply. However, 

there is a risk that the eff
ects of the financial crisis 
on bank lending behaviour will be felt with a lag. 

If so, the current situation of strong funding to the 

non-bank private sector will not last, as banks feel 

progressively compelled to cut back their lending 

activities due to larger-than-expected losses and a 

need to rebuild capital ratios. 
Transmission to real economy  The main transmission 
mechanisms from the 
financial crisis to the r
eal economy are threefold, 
coming directly from deteriorating credit 

conditions but also more indirectly from a less 

favourable external environment and a decline in 

business and consumer confidence. 
While a significant retrenchment of credit to the 
private sector has not materialised so far, survey 

evidence suggests that the attitude of banks to 

credit risk has changed.  If this change in risk 

preferences feeds thr
ough to actual lending 
behaviour, the cost of external financing for both 

corporate and household sectors could rise 

significantly. In addition to higher funding costs, 

there might also be a reduction in the availability 

of credit to some business and household 

borrowers.  
A more indirect effect of the financial crisis on the 
EU economy will come via the effect of tightening 

credit conditions on other parts of the global 

economy. In particular, th
e performance of the US 
economy has been severely weakened by the 

impact of the financial crisis. To this extent, the 

EU economy is exposed via the traditional trade 

and investment channels, but also via balance sheet 

exposures. Another negative stimulus would arise 

in the event of a further sharp appreciation in the 

euro, partly driven by the monetary easing by the 

Fed in response to macro-financial pressures in the 

US.   
The EU economy might also be affected indirectly 
by negative effects of the financial crisis on 
business and consumer confidence. Such 
confidence effects are difficult to predict but can 

have a pervasive impact on real-sector activity. So 

far, overall economic sentiment in the EU has been 

underpinned by optimism in the manufacturing 

sector, although services 
and consumer confidence 
have been less buoyant. The symbiotic relationship 

between economic confidence and the global 

housing boom in recent years points to the risk of a 

mutually reinforcing downward trend in economic 

confidence and housing-market correction. 
Housing sector The question for the EU is whether the US housing 

adjustment could herald similar developments 

elsewhere.
 The recent boom in the housing market 
has been Œ with a few exceptions such as in 

Germany Œ a global phenomenon, encompassing 

most of the EU and several euro-area countries as 

well. Housing construction has boomed and saving 

rates have declined, while household sector debt 

has soared to record levels. The broadly based 

housing upswing raises the question of whether the 

US experience could trigger similar experiences 

across the global economy.  
The question regains in importance as signs of a 
housing slowdown emerge in the EU, with the 

pace in price increases d
ecelerating markedly in 
the euro area as a whole bu
t also outside the area 
with prices declining in the UK, for instance. 

Available information suggests that the 

deceleration of euro area h
ouse prices continued in 
the second half of 2007 on the back of a 

decelerated bank credit gr
owth for house purchase 
loans. In addition, euro area building permit 

indicators have weakened considerably. All this 

would suggest that a significant housing downturn 

could be ahead.  
While overall housing trends have been mostly 
smaller in the euro area, there have been a number 

of "hot-spot" countries with much more 

pronounced rates of house price increases and 

associated debt accumulation. In these countries, 

house prices seem to have increased at a similar 

rate as in the US, household sector debt ratios 

climbed to similar levels or have surpassed US 

levels and the share of residential construction on 

GDP is often much higher than in the US.  
However, EU mortgage markets are organised 
differently than in the US, reflected in the near 

absence of subprime lending and a much lower 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  30 degree of loan securitisation, thus requiring banks 
to keep loans on their books until maturity and 

therefore compel them to
 a solid credit analysis. 
Also, the possibilities for households to extract 

equity from their home ar
e much more limited and 
European households have a much higher saving 

rates than their US peers, providing them with a 

financial buffer.  
There is a concern, th
ough, that house price 
corrections in especially
 vulnerable euro area 
countries could trigger a broader euro area decline. 

While it was widely assumed before the US 

housing downturn that the housing correction 

caused by subprime would stay limited to that 

particular market segments and therefore not affect 

the broader market, subsequent developments have 

shown that modern financial linkages packaged all 

market segments together. Similarly, the 

expectation that a house price correction would be 

confined to the particular
ly vulnerable euro area 
countries could prove equa
lly false. Transmission 
factors not only include 
trade but also confidence 
effects and Œ especially - financial market linkages 

as they become increasingly integrated. Also, some 

of the "hot-spot" countries were active in 

securitising loans and in the covered bond market 

and have spread their mortgage exposure to 

investors all over the eu
ro area (and the EU as 
well). As a result, a house price slump in those 

countries could - via financial linkages - trigger a 

broader decline for other 
euro area countries as 
well.  Corporate sector The euro-area corporate sector has accumulated 

record debt levels and runs a financial deficit in 

aggregate. Some companie
s involved in leveraged 
buy-outs could be especially vulnerable to tighter 

financing conditions and the price of leveraged 

loans has already declined significantly in 

secondary trading. Also, much of the non-financial 

corporate debt has been amassed by the 

construction sector or by land developers, and a 

housing downturn would affect those segments and 

lead to higher loan de
linquencies. Overall, the 
financial balance of the euro-area corporate sector 

Œ also defined as savings minus investment outlays 

Œ records a financial deficit in the euro area. This 

is in contrast to US 
corporate balance sheets, 
which record a surplus. 
While corporate profits rema
in strong at present, a 
slowdown in economic growth and falling share 
prices would suggest th
at profits will weaken 
going forward. Declining business confidence and 

faltering retail sales are adding to worries for the 

business sector. A higher risk of corporate 

defaults, which remain at historically low levels, is 

also increasingly priced 
in via higher corporate 
spreads which have reached multi-year highs. 

Higher investor perception of corporate defaults is 

also visible in the indi
ces measuring the annual 
costs of investor protection against corporate 

defaults.

 Recently-acceded Member States Some of the recently-acced
ed Member States are 
also vulnerable to deteriorating financial 

conditions.
 Unlike on previous occasions, the 
financial turbulence has affected mainly financial 

products and banks in more developed countries. 

In contrast, there has been a notable absence of 

geographical risk aversion 
based on Œ for instance 
Œ unsustainably wide current-account deficits. 

Going forward one cannot exclude the possibility 

that this geographical element might become more 

important. This would make countries excessively 

reliant on short-term financing flows vulnerable to 

sudden reversals in risk-preferences, with 

implications for exchange rates. In the recently-

acceded Member States, lending activities are 

often dependent on foreign banks, which might be 

under pressure from events in their domestic 

markets to curtail lending in the host Member 

States. 3. FINANCIAL TURMOIL AND HIGH COMMODITY 
PRICES REDUCE EU GROWTH    31 Downward growth revisions The expression "unusually uncertain" describes the 
current economic situation 
and outlook particularly 
well. Most of the risks to the outlook for growth 

and inflation identified in the autumn forecast have 

started to materialise simultaneously. This, in 

itself, is unusual.  
The global economy is cooling and, in particular, 
the US economy is on the brink of a recession. 

According to the CPB in
dicator, year-on-year world trade volume growth more than halved 

during 2007. Moreover, the financial turmoil is 

ongoing and intensifying, putting the credit-

sensitive components of growth at risk. 

Commodity prices are in
creasing further and, 
notwithstanding the dampening impact from the 

appreciation of the euro, are pushing inflation up 

to rates not seen in many years.  
So far, the European economy has weathered these 
headwinds relatively well, with its fundamentals 

on a sound footing when the turmoil broke out. 

The observed impact of the financial crisis on the 

real economy is relatively 
limited so far, and there 
is no evidence of a credit squeeze or crunch in the 

EU. Although this is difficult to assess, a certain 

lagged impact is to be expected, especially in 

economies with a large financial sector or a 

stretched housing market.  
As a result of the persistence of the negative 
factors weighing on the European economy, the 

projections for EU and eu
ro-area GDP growth in 
2008 and 2009 are revised down by about ½ pp., 

compared to the autumn fo
recast. EU growth will 
decelerate from 2.8% in 20
07 to 2.0% in 2008 and 
1.8% in 2009. For the euro area, the respective 

figures will be 2.6%, 1.7% and 1.5%. While below 

potential, the projections 
for the EU clearly exceed 
those for the US and Japan.  
Among individual Member States, the largest 
revisions occur, as expected, for the Member 

States with a large financial sector, significant 

macro-economic imbalances, high exposure to the 

US or a likely correction in the housing market. 

This concerns, in particul
ar, Ireland, Spain, Italy 
and Luxembourg in the euro area, as well as 
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the United 
Kingdom. It has to be noted that the large 

downward revision of Italian growth in 2008 is 

partly due to unexpectedly 
weak growth in the last 
quarter of 2007, which reduces the carry-over. 
Compared to the interim 
forecast of 21 February, 
the forecast for EU growth 
in 2008 is unchanged, 
while euro-area growth is reduced by 0.1pp. This 

may come as a surprise, in light of the new 

information regarding the US economy, the 

financial turmoil and inflation. However, while 

growth for all other large euro-area Member States 

was revised down, the German outlook for 2008 

was revised up, due to significantly better news on 

developments in the first quarter. 
As the slowdown affects some of the fastest-
growing EU economies the most, the dispersion of 

growth rates declines. GDP growth rates of the 

largest economies of the euro area converge in a 

range of 1.4-1.8% in 2009, with the exception of 

Italy. 
Domestic demand will slow down substantially, 
from 2.9% in 2007 to 1.7% in 2009 in the EU. It 

will nevertheless be the mainstay of GDP growth, 

as the net external contribution fades to 0.1 pp. in 

2008 and 2009 (both in the EU and the euro area), 

reflecting the global slow
down reinforced by the 
euro appreciation. 
Inflation dampens private consumption growth  In recent years, globalisa
tion and increased labour 
market flexibility have put downward pressure on 

nominal wage developments. Over the last ten 

years, nominal compensation per employee grew 

on average by 2½% per year in the euro area. 

While globalisation curbed price developments for 

manufactured products, the credible monetary 

policy that aims at keeping inflation at or below 

2%, ensured some room was left for increases in 

real income. Moreover, employment growth has 

been accelerating (to 1½% annual growth in the 

euro area in 2006 and 2007, somewhat higher in 

the EU). Together, this should have paved the way 

for reasonable growth in real disposable income 

and, consequently, private consumption. However, 

the recent sharp rises in food and energy prices

 Looking forward, consumption is unlikely to get 
much help from key driving variables. The pace of 

job creation is already slowing and will ease 

further as weaker GDP st
arts feeding through to 
the labour market, exerting also some downward 

pressure on nominal wage growth. In some 

countries, the labour ma
rket cycle has already 
turned and unemployment is expected to rise 

already in 2008 in
 Spain, Ireland, Estonia, Latvia 
and the United Kingdom. Moreover, the end of the 

rise in house prices will dampen consumption 

growth through direct wealth effects as well as 

indirect confidence effects. EU consumer 

confidence has already fallen significantly since 

the summer of 2007, wi
th expectations for 
households' own situation at their lowest level for 
ten years.  As a result, the forecast projects fairly bleak 
private consumption growth in the euro area given 

the mature position of the business cycle 

(respectively 1.5%, 1.4% and 1.5% in 2007, 2008 

and 2009). The apparent acceleration in 2009 is 

partly due to a normalisation of consumption 

growth in Germany and Italy. In both Member 

States, growth in 2008 is temporarily depressed by 

the estimated contraction in the last quarter of 

2007, which substantially reduces the carry-over. 
Non-residential activity prevents total 
investment in construction from shrinking in 

2008 and 2009 Gross fixed capital formation was the main driver 
of GDP growth in 2006-2007, growing by 6.0% in 

2006 and 5.4% in 2007 in the EU. However, 

investment growth is projected to be less than half 

that in 2008 and 2009, mainly due to tighter credit 

conditions and weaker overall demand. Investment 

is projected to grow by respectively 2.8% and 

2.0% in 2008 and 2009. Investment in 

construction, in particular, but also in equipment, 

is revised downwards significantly. 
As regards investment in construction, a lot of 
attention is traditionally paid to the housing sector. 

However, it is often overlooked that non-

residential construction (including civil 

engineering) makes up slightly more than half of 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  33 total construction investment. During the forecast 
period, non-residential construction will provide 

some stability to the development of total 

construction investment (as it did already during 

2007). It is actually expected to prevent total 

investment in construction from shrinking in 2008 

and 2009 in the euro 
area. The evolution of 
investment in non-residential construction is the 

outcome of various influencing factors, including 

the idiosyncratic cycle of public investment, the 

weakness of the financial sector and, finally, the 

role of the non-financial corporate sector. 
Turning to housing investment, the jump in 
inflation at the end of 2007 aggravated households' 

financing possibilities for house purchases, which 

were already suffering from the high level of house 

prices and the tightening of credit conditions. The 

ECB's interest rate statistics show that, depending 

on the maturity of the loans, interest rates on new 

loans for house purchases increased by 25 to 55 

basis points between February 2007 and February 

2008 in the euro area. Th
ere is evidently a sizeable 
risk that, as a result of the financial turmoil, credit 

costs will increase further in the near future.

 Signs of a housing slowdown have become 
evident: indicators for house prices, building 

permits and credit growth for house purchases all 

weakened during 2007 in 
the euro ar
ea. Credit 
growth for house purchases, which was already 

declining before the financial turmoil, dropped to a 

15-year low in February 2008 (+6.7% yoy). As a 

result of these factors, housing investment is 

projected to contract in 
the euro area in 2008 and 
2009, dragged down by developments in Ireland 

and Spain. Notwithstanding the substantial 

downward revision to housing investment, its 

share in GDP remains abov
e its long-term average 
in some Member States in 2009, pointing to 
persistent country-specific downside risks to 
housing investment. 
Some resilience in equipment investment  Equipment investment has been an important 
source of growth in the recent past. The high 

profitability of the non-financial corporate sector 

and the existing capacity constraints should 

continue to support equipment investment during 

the forecast period. The gr
oss operating surplus (a 
good proxy for profits) of non-financial 

corporations has been on th
e rise for several years, 
but is likely to come under increasing pressures 

ahead. Although capacity utilisation in the 

manufacturing sector has declined slightly since its 

peak in the summer of 2007, its stands well above 

its long-term average.  
Confidence also remained relatively resilient in the 
manufacturing sector since the outbreak of the 

financial turmoil. Most business survey indicators, 

including the European Commission's 

manufacturing survey, the Reuters PMI index for 

manufacturing activity an
d the IFO indicators, despite declining in recent 
months, remain at fairly 
high levels, well above their long-term average.

 Confidence in the servi
ce sector, however, has 
been markedly less robust. This should come as no 

surprise in view of the large weight of the financial 

sector in the service sector and the weakness of 

private consumption. Moreover, equipment 

investment is typically closely related to overall 

demand expectations, which are affected by 

bleaker export prospects and the slowdown in 

consumption. Finally, tighter financing conditions 

ought to dampen investment activities where these 

cannot be financed out of own resources. The

 34 ECB's interest rate statistics show that, depending 
on the maturity and amount of the loans, interest 

rates on new loans to the 
non-financial
 corporate 
sector increased by 37 to 77 basis points between 

February 2007 and February 2008 in the euro area. 

Increasing write-downs for non-performing loans 

could cause banks to increase rates further. 
The projections foresee euro-area equipment 
investment growth decelerat
ing from 6.4% in 2007 
to 3.9% in 2008 and 2.1% in 2009. The latter 

projection has been revised down from 4.0% in the 

autumn forecast. In 2008, the projection for Italy is 

significantly lower than the euro-area average. 

This is partly due to the estimated contraction in 

the last quarter of 2007, which substantially 

reduces the carry-over. 
A neutral contribution from the external side The EU is not alone in
 facing the multiple 
headwinds of the ongoing financial turmoil, high 

and rising commodity prices and a severe 

slowdown in the US. As 
a result, year-on-year 
world trade volume growth more than halved 

during 2007, from 9.7% in January 2007 to 4.3% 

in January 2008 according to the CPB indicator.  
The less supportive global 
environment is reflected 
in the projections, where world GDP (outside the 

EU) has been revised down by about ½ pp. in 

2007, 1 pp. in 2008 and 1¼ pps. in 2009. 

Revisions to world trade have been smaller for 

2007 and 2008, due to the relative resilience of the 
emerging markets: respectiv
ely, 0 pp. and ¼ pp., to 
7.8% and 6.8% for world imports of goods and 

services (excluding the EU). In 2009, world trade 

will further decelerate to 6.4%. 
The combined forces of 
the less favourable global 
environment and the appreciation of the exchange 

rate push euro-area export growth down to 4.4% in 

2008 and 4.0% in 2009, from 6.1% in 2007. The 

relative stability in 2009 reflects both a relatively 

favourable composition of European exports (in 

product and geographical terms) as well as a 

relative resilience against the appreciation of the 

exchange rate. 
The supportive role of demand from emerging 
markets, specifically from oil exporters and 

emerging Asia, for EU exports is expected to 

continue during the forecas
t period. Between 1999 
and 2007, the contribution of EU exports to oil 

exporters and emerging Asia to total export values 

exceeded their weight in th
e EU export basket by, 
respectively, 4.1 pps. and 1.1 pps. EU exports 

include also intra-EU tr
ade, where the supportive 
role of demand from the recently-acceded Member 

States is also expected to continue. Indeed, their 

contribution exceeded their weight by 7.0 pps. 
When assessing the impact of the exchange rate 
appreciation, it is important to look beyond the 

bilateral euro-dollar rate. According to the usual 

technical assumption (kee
ping nominal exchange 
rates constant from a specific base period), the 

euro will depreciate in 2008 against the Japanese 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  35 yen, the Swiss franc and some currencies of the 
recently-acceded Member Stat
es. While the euro is 
assumed to appreciate by 
13% in 2008 against the 
US dollar, the nominal effective exchange rate of 

the EU (and the euro area)
 will increase by 5½% in 
2008, leading to an appreciation of 6% in real 

terms (4¾% for the euro
 area). While the real 
effective exchange rate of the euro area is still 

relatively close to its long
-term average, it is not 
excluded that the impact
 on exports may become 
stronger the longer and further the appreciation 

continues, as hedging only provides coverage 

against short- to medium-term variations.  
The resilience of EU exports to the appreciation of 
the exchange rate is reflected in subdued export 

market share losses (¾% in both 2008 and 2009, 

against slightly more than 1% for the euro area). 

The evolution at the aggregate level is the result of 

diverging developments at the Member State level. 

Overall, the net external contribution fades to 0.1 

pp. in 2008 and 2009 in 
the EU and the euro area. 
In these years, the net 
external contribution is 
reduced severely in many Member States where it 

was large in 2007 (i.e. Germany, Malta, Austria 

and Slovakia).

n in the current account

the Member States with a large deficit (i.e.

However, the widening of the deficit in some other 

Member States continues to raise concerns (i.e. 

Spain, Cyprus, and Romania). 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  36  Box 2.3.1: 
Estimation of the impact of the oil-price shock
Crude oil prices increased strongly over the recent 
past. In April 2008, they were about 60% higher in 
US dollar and 35% higher in euro terms than one 
year ago. In four years, the oil prices have almost 

doubled in euro, and almost tripled in dollars. 
The origins of this increase are difficult to 
disentangle. Demand-related factors have certainly 
played a role, as the world demand for oil has 
increased by about 4% in the last three years, 
mainly due to fast-growing demand from emerging 
markets. However, supply-related factors are also 
important: geopolitical tensions, refinery 

bottlenecks and the unwillingness of the OPEC to 
increase its production significantly. 
This box briefly discusses the macroeconomic 
impact of the oil shock on the euro-area economies. 
For that purpose, simulations have been carried out 

with a multi-region version of the QUEST model. 
This model belongs to the modern class of 
Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium
 (DSGE) 
models that now serve as the foundation for macro-
economic policy analysis. It includes an energy 
production sector in which energy serves as an 
intermediate input in the final goods production. 
The relative price of oil is exogenously determined. 
The past increases in oil prices have led to lower 
GDP growth and to higher inflation  
In an attempt to capture the gradual and 
unanticipated nature of the oil price shocks, a first 
simulation assumes a stepwise increase in current 

and expected future oil prices of 100% over a 
period of three years. This scenario consists of a 
succession of three permanent shocks in which, 

compared to the baseline, oil prices are raised by 
33% the first year, 66% the second year and 100% 
the third year. This roughly corresponds to the 
increase in oil prices between January 2004 (27 
EUR per barrel) and November 2007 (55 EUR per 
barrel).  
The outcome of the simulation is that real GDP 
falls by 1 percent below baseline after three years, 
which implies a loss in GDP growth of about 0.3 
pp a year. The impact on consumption is stronger, 
with a decline of 2% after three years. Investment 

decreases by almost 3% in the first five years. In 
spite of the increasing deficit on the oil balance, the 
trade balance improves due to higher exports to oil-

exporting countries and a contraction of imports 
driven by the lower consumption. As for inflation, 
it rises b
y 0.7% for the first three 
years
, which is 
roughly in line with the increase in energy prices 
and their share in the consumer price index. 
A further 25 % increase in oil prices would cut 
GDP growth by about 0.2 pp in the first two 
years 
A second scenario takes the previous simulation as 
a new baseline and shows the effects of a further oil 
price increase of 25% (i.e. about 15 EUR). This 
would imply oil prices in line with what is 
currently assumed for 2008 and 2009. Such a rise 
would have a negative impact on real GDP of 

around 0.2% the first year, 0.35% the second and 
about 0.7% after 10 years. There would be a 
sharper fall in consumption and in investment 
spending, partly offset by growth in net exports. As 
for inflation, the oil price shock would add about 
0.7 pp to the consumer price index.  
However, the impact strongly depends on 
underlying assumptions 
There are several factors which influence the 
outcome of the model. Among them, the way 
wages respond to the oil shock plays an important 
role: if real wages decrease in line with 
productivity, the negative growth impact is 

reduced. If they are indexed to consumer prices Œ 
as they were in the1970s, with strong second-round 
effects Œ the cost is markedly higher, since the 
adjustment is obtained only after a strong decrease 
in production and subsequently in labour demand.  
Another important difference with the 1970s is the 
nature of the shock. The previous simulation has 
been carried out assuming an exogenous shock to 

oil prices. However, the current persistent increase 
in world oil prices could be partly endogenous, 
driven by demand factors and higher productivity 
growth in oil-importing countries. Even if the 
impact of higher oil prices on world growth is still 
negative, it could be a simple consequence of 

higher world growth, from which the euro-area 
economies benefit via other channels. 
   4. LABOUR MARKETS ST
ILL SOLID, SOFTENING AHEAD    37 Employment continued to benefit from the growth 
momentum in 2007 in bo
th the euro area and the 
EU. Due to the lagged response of employment to 

GDP growth and assuming 
that the cycle reached 
its peak in the first half 
of 2007, a deceleration in 
employment growth will become visible in 2008-

2009. On top of this, as GDP growth slows down 

further due to the current headwinds, employment 

growth should slow even more going forward. 

Overall, unemployment rates are expected to 

stabilise over the forecast horizon, while 

employment growth is set to decline. Between 

2007 and 2009, the euro-a
rea economy is expected 
to create 4½ million new jobs, and the EU 

economy Œ above 7 million. 
Robust employment growth in 2007 Boosted by strong economic activity in 2007 (well 

above potential), 
employment
 grew by 1.6% in 
2007 in the euro area an
d 1.7% in the EU. These 
rates are broadly comparable to 2006, and are 

above average for the sec
ond year in a row. In 
more detail, positive surprises have led to sizeable 

upward revisions to data for 2007, especially in the 

Netherlands and Slovenia, but also, to a lesser 

extent in Germany, Ital
y, France, Austria and a 
number of smaller Member States, compared to the 

assessment in the autumn
 2007 forecast. In 
contrast, employment growth has been revised 

down, notably in Greece, 
Denmark and Estonia. 
Overall, Europe created nearly 4 million jobs in 

2007 and the euro area 2½ million. The main 

contributions in terms of jobs created were from 

Spain, Germany and Poland, where over 600 

thousand additional persons were employed in 

each country compar
ed with 2006.  
Employment growth appeared broad across 
Member States, although employment in Portugal 

grew at a much more subdued pace than the euro-

area average. Good news 
(from Poland especially) 
translates into a still high level of job creation in 

the EU as a whole. All sectors benefited from the 

revival of the labour market (manufacturing and to 

a lesser extent, services), as well as the growing 

uptake of various types of work arrangements (e.g. 

part-time, full-time, permanent and fixed-term 

contracts).

 Unemployment at a historical low The unemployment rate
 declined to 7.4% in the 
euro area in 2007 and to
 7.1% in the EU, from 
above 8% in both regions in 2006. This represents 

a sizeable drop between 2006 and 2007, at the 

peak of the cycle, which was mainly driven by 

Germany (-1.4 pps.) and France (-0.9 pp.), while 

the unemployment rate in
creased in Portugal and 
Ireland. Differences in unemployment rates 

continued to be large among euro-area Member 

States, ranging from 3.2% in the Netherlands to 

above 8% in Germany, Greece, Spain and France 

in 2007. Turning to the EU, in 2007, Slovakia 

featured the highest unemployment rate at 11.1%; 

nevertheless, a drop by 2.3 pps. within the past 

year is encouraging, as was the drop in Poland, 

where the unemployment rate came down by an 

impressive 4.2 pps. The reduction in the number of 

unemployed persons in 2006-2007 is comparable 

to the previous upturn, although the current cycle 

might be shorter-lived. That said, in February 2008 

around 11 million people were still registered as 

unemployed in the euro area, and close to 16 

million in the EU. 
Entering into 2008, the unemployment rate in the 
EU kept declining, to reach 6.7% in February 

(down from 6.8% in January), while the rate in the 

euro area remained unchanged at 7.1%.  

Employment growth, although moderating, 

remained solid, especially in Germany, and thus 

could potentially support consumer confidence, 

which would be welcome at the current juncture. 

However, unemployment has started to rise again

 Expectations pointing down However, given the weakened economic growth 
prospects, labour market expectations worsened in 

the first quarter of 2008. They indicate a 

deceleration of employment 
growth going forward, 
compared to the buoyant 
performance over the last 
couple of years. Employment prospects reported in 

the Commission's business and consumer surveys 

(BCS) point to managers' employment 

expectations declining in manufacturing and 

services in recent months and stabilising in March; 

consumers' unemployment expectations for the 

next 12 months are also on a decreasing trend and 

worsened further in March. The employment 

component of the Purchasing Managers' Index 

eased after a peak last su
mmer. While remaining at 
levels indicative of robust employment growth, 

this suggests softening labour markets. The 

employment component of the index improved 

slightly in manufacturing, while it continues to 

decline in services.

 Labour market outlook for 2008-2009 Further ahead, employment growth is projected to 
slow down markedly to around 0.8-0.9% in 2008 

and 0.5% in 2009 in both the euro area and the EU. 

This change is due to a deceleration in 

employment growth in almost all Member States. 

Employment growth in the euro area and the EU in 

2009 is expected to be well below the long-term 

average. This board do
wnturn in employment 
growth is mainly being driven by the slowdown in 

GDP growth. However, employment growth is 

projected to recover in 20
09 in some cases, notably 
in Ireland, Italy, Hungary, and some smaller 

Member States.  
Unemployment stabilises The unemployment rate is expected to decline to 

around 7¼ % in 2008-2009 in
 the euro area and to 
6.8% in both years in the EU. This is higher than 

expected in the autumn 2
007 forecast, by 0.1-0.2 
pp. in both forecast years, 
and reflects the fact that 
the unemployment rate is still decreasing, but at a 

slower pace. The unemployment rate is expected to 

bottom out in 2008 in the euro area, on account of 

increases in Spain, Ireland
, Belgium, and Austria. 
In the EU, the unemployment rate is set to flatten 

out in 2008-2009, but to increase in the United 

Kingdom, Sweden, Hungary and the Baltic States. 
Labour markets tensions are expected to ease The estimate of the structural unemployment rate 

(NAIRU) is declining, and it should reach 7.3% in 

the euro area and 6.7% in 
the EU by 2009. As the 
actual unemployment rate in the euro area is 

expected to increase slightly in 2009, the 

unemployment gap should widen somewhat, 

pointing to a certain easing in the labour market 

situation. This should alleviate wage pressures, 

according to the theory behind
 the structural rate of 
unemployment. At the individual country level, 

though, this estimate of the structural 

unemployment rate appears set to rise over the 

forecast horizon in Spai
n, the United Kingdom, 
Ireland, and Portugal. 
An additional indicator of labour market tension is 
shortages on the labour market. Labour shortages 
and equipment shortages became more and more 

visible towards the end of 2007, and shortage of 

labour was still on the rise in the euro area in the 

first quarter of 2008 in manufacturing, but no 

longer in the services s
ector, possibly leading to a 
turnaround. As the production cycle peaks, it is 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  39 likely that shortages will fall back, thereby 
alleviating potential upward pressure on wages.

NAIRU
% Moderate real wage developments In the past decade, wage moderation has prevailed. 
In the autumn forecast, given the strength and the 

gradual tightening of European labour markets, the 

outlook was for more dynamic wage 

developments, ultimately supporting consumption. 

However, towards the end of 2007 and at the 

beginning of 2008, inflation developments 

gradually ate up the slight wage increases (see also 

section 5 on inflation).  
As a result, and in view of the deceleration in 
employment growth, 
real compensation of 
employees
 in the euro area 
is likely to increase 
only very moderately over the forecast horizon, 

from 0.4 % in 2007 and 2008 to 0.9% in 2009. 

This relatively flat profile in 2007-2008 is 

essentially due to opposite developments in 

developments in Italy and France, which cancel 

each other out. Real comp
ensation per employee is 
forecast to increase in Germany in 2009, at last. In 

the EU, real compensation should increase to 1.3% 

annual growth in 2009, reflecting the similar albeit 

less pronounced profile fo
r the euro area. These 
growth rates are nevertheless around the long-term 

averages of the past ten 
years for the euro area and 
the EU as a whole. In
 that respect, current 
developments are far from extraordinary.  
Such 
moderate 
wage developments can be 
understood in the context of competitive pressure 

from the international environment, where it may 

have diminished the bargaining power of workers 

in some more exposed sectors. This may have 

implied a structural change in wage formation. 

However, employment co
mposition effects also 
play an important role. All in all, sizeable wage 
hikes seem unlikely even beyond the forecast 

horizon.  
Moreover, unit labour costs (ULC) continue to 
grow at a very moderate pace, by 1½ to 2% in the 

euro area and the EU on av
erage. In real terms, 
negative 
real 
unit labour costs continue prevail in 
the euro area, as they have in the past fifteen years. 

This very subdued ULC growth is a general feature 

across euro-area Member States. This should 

continue to support the export performance of the 

region, but implies that the wage share is still 

declining in line with the trend that has now 

prevailed for some time. All in all, the wage bill is 

projected to continue to d
ecline. On the other hand, 
employment growth has been relatively robust 

across the last cycle. This adjustment mechanism, 

which is common in a monetary union comes at 

the expense of consumption, which is certainly the 

most sluggish variable observed across the current 

cycle. Meanwhile, 
labour productivity
 growth has 
also remained rather subdued, below its longer-

term average, even at the 
peak of the cycle. Labour 
productivity will grow by 1% in the euro area in 

2009 and by 1.3% in the EU. 
Structural reforms are paying off The improvement across different types of 

employment reflects 
inter alia
 past structural 
reforms and the increased use of flexible types of 

work arrangements. Various types of labour-

market reforms have been enacted in the period 

2000-2006 (
e.g. flexible working-time 
arrangements, employment protection legislation, 

taxation) and the information available suggests 

that reforms put in place have focused on 

increasing labour utilisation (to integrate 

'outsiders'). The examples gathered in the 

Commission's LABREF database indicate that 

most of the larger Member States have 

implemented reforms (see Quarterly Report on the 

Euro Area, No 1 2008). 
Analysis indicates that 
these have paid off, by increasing employment and 

participation rates in the euro area and 

strengthening the response of employment to 

cyclical fluctuations, although at the expense of 

(temporarily) dampened labour productivity 

growth and, in some cases, increased dualism in 

the labour market. 
The overall employment rate is expected to 
continue increasing, albeit 
at a slower pace than in 
the years of the cyclical 
upturn, reaching 67.8 % of

which Europe had set itself in the Lisbon agenda 

cannot be achieved. That
 said, the structural 
reforms undertaken have clearly improved the 

functioning of the labour market, and contributed 

to an increase in the employment rate by around 3 

to 4 pps. since 2000 until now (corresponding to 

18 million new jobs in the EU). Despite recent 

improvement, the EU will also fall short of the 

targets for older workers (50%) and female (60%) 

employment rates. Despite across-the-board 

increases in overall employment rates, large 

variations persist across Member States. According 

to the current projections, the employment rate will 

vary from 55.4% in Malta to 77.9% in Denmark in 

2009.  
 5. INFLATION TO SURGE TEMPORARILY 
   41 Headline inflation doubled since last autumn – Headline HICP inflation
 in the EU has remained 
well contained in 2007 until the autumn. Indeed, 

last August marked the first time since 1999 in 

which the euro area register
ed a period of twelve 
consecutive months with inflation rates below 2%. 

However, since August 2007, headline inflation in 

the euro area has doubled, reaching 3.6% in March 

2008 Œ the highest level in 12 years. Inflation in 

the whole EU has also doubled, from 1.9% in 

August 2007 to 3.8% in March 2008. 
The sharp increase reflected a combination of 
soaring oil and food prices and the fading of 

favourable base effects. As oil prices rose strongly 

during most of 2006, peaking in the summer, 

favourable energy-price ba
se effects contributed 
significantly to the limited increase in overall 

inflation in the first part of 2007. However, since 

oil prices subsequently fell sharply in the autumn 

of 2006, base effects reversed and pushed inflation 

upwards in the last months of 2007. The annual 

rate of increase of energy 
prices in the euro area, 
for instance, averaged merely 0.5% in the first 

eight months of the year, compared to over 8½% 

since then (reaching 11.2% in March 2008). The 

sharp increase over the last few months turned the 

contribution of this component to headline 

inflation from about -0.1 pp. in August 2007 to 

over 1 pps. in the first months of 2008, see also

 Inflation in the other main non-core component, 
i.e. unprocessed food
, also increased recently and 
stands ¼ pp. above the 2007 averages in both the 

euro area and the EU at 3% and 3.5%, 
respectively. Unlike past food price shocks, the 
latest surge in food commodity prices has mostly 

affected processed, rath
er then unprocessed food 
prices. The latest pick-up is due to an ongoing 

increase in meat prices, resulting from the rising 

cost of animal feed an
d increased demand from 
emerging markets. 
– while core inflation swelled on the back of 
increasing prices of processed food and 

services Similarly, euro-area 
core inflation
 (HICP 
excluding energy and unprocessed food) recently 

accelerated to 2.7% in March, after hovering 

around 2% for most of 2007. Although the rise of 

underlying inflation is in line with the economy 

reaching a mature cyclical 
position, it also reflects 
a certain pass-through of strong increases in 

primary commodity prices, particularly food 

prices.  The increase in core inflation can be attributed to 
services, non-energy industrial goods and 

processed food altogether. The latter climbed 

sharply from just below 2% in the summer of 2007 

to 6 ¾% in March 2008, on
 the back of the surge 
in the prices of agricultural commodities and food 

in world markets.  This hike is driven by a 

combination of both tran
sitory and structural 
supply and demand factors. As regards the former, 

the supply is reduced due to damaged crops 

because of the adverse w
eather conditions in 2007 
and speculation by institutional investors 

stemming from financial markets turbulence. For 

the latter, demand is boosted due to a switch to 

biofuels and a rising income level in emerging 

economies. 
At the same time, 
services inflation
 in the 
beginning of 2008 eased somewhat to just below 

2.5% after a continuous upward drift observed 

until September 2007, to rise again to 2.8% in 

March 2008. This placed services inflation 0.5 pp. 

above its level of a year ea
rlier. Part of the overall 
increase can be attributed to developments in 

Germany, where services inflation was affected by 

e.g. the VAT hike.  However, there is also some 

evidence suggesting that firms in the services 

sector, which are more sheltered from foreign 

competition, are better able to pass on rising cost 

pressures to consumers.  
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  42 Inflation in 
non-energy industrial goods
 continued 
in 2007 on the gentle upward trend started in mid-

2005, reflecting the gradual pass-through of past 

increases in oil and non-oil commodity prices. In 

the beginning of 2008 inflation in this component 

decreased by about 0.2 pp. from last year average 

of 1%, reflecting the pattern of seasonal 

discounting and to some extent some base effects 

from the VAT increase in Germany in the 

beginning of 2007. Despite capacity utilisation in 

the manufacturing sector reac
hing historically high 
levels and input cost pressures, the dynamics of 

industrial goods inflation remains subdued, which 

can be attributed both to the dampening effect of 

appreciating euro on 
import prices and a 
competitive international environment. 
Looking at developments at the production stage, 
soaring food and oil prices led to rising 

inflationary pressures. Overall industrial producer 

price inflation (PPI, excluding construction) in the 

euro area have been on the rise from a 1.7% (yoy) 

last August to 5.3% in February 2008. This was 

mainly the result of the sharp increase in the 

energy component, which climbed in that period 

from -2.2% to 11.7%. At the same time, inflation 

in industrial consumer goods, the most 

immediately relevant component for consumer 

prices, hovered around 2.1%, 0.4 pp. higher than in 

the first half of 2007. The annual rate of price 

increases in intermediate goods, the largest 

component of the index, increased slightly in the 

beginning of 2008 after a long downward drift that 

started in August 2006.

yoy % Labour costs remain subdued, as mentioned in the 
labour market section. The annual growth rate in 

compensation per employee in the euro area 

reached 2.0% in the thir
d quarter of 2007, which 
compares with 1.8% at the 
end of 2006. This slight 
increase still suggests no 
significant second-round 
effects, so far, from 
the past commodity price 
hikes. For the year as 
a whole, compensation per 
employee is estimated to have accelerated to 2.5%, 

after 1.3% in 2006.  
Other labour cost indicators also point to contained 
wage developments in course of last year. The 

ECB's indicator of negotiated wages moved down 

from 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 2.1% in 

the fourth quarter of 2007. On average, negotiated 

wages in the euro area grew by 2.1% in 2007, 

compared with 2.3% in 2006. The annual growth 

rate in Eurostat's hourly labour cost index shows 

an acceleration from 2.2% to 
2.7% in the course of 
2007, ½ pp. higher then one year before. The 

relatively subdued growth of total hourly labour 

cost and compensation of 
employees in view of a 
tightening labour market was partially due to 

dampening effects of cuts in social security 

contributions implemented in some euro-area 

economies in 2007. However, the remarkable 

moderation in wage growth in euro area observed 

in 2005-2006 (with no growth in real 

compensation per employee)
 has come to an end 
and wages have started to pick up somewhat.  
A slowdown in labour productivity growth in 2007 
meant that the acceleration of wage growth had a 

slight inflationary impact. It is estimated that 

productivity in the euro area rose by 1.1% in 2007, 

which represents a deceleration of 0.2 pp. 

compared to 2006, although still above the average 

gains of the four previous years. Accordingly, 

growth in unit labour costs is estimated to have 

picked up from 1.1% in 2006 to 1.4% in 2007.

managers' selling-price expectations decreased 

slightly in industry in the euro area, while 

remaining stable in the EU, whereas they 

decreased in the construction sector in both the 

euro area and the EU. Consumers™ price 

expectations decreased, but 
currently stand close to 
the high levels reached 
in 2001. After increasing 
somewhat at the end of last year, long-term 

inflation expectations in the euro area derived from 

French government inflation-indexed bonds hit the 

record high of 2.32% in March 2008, following a 

temporary decline to 2.
12% one month earlier. 
A temporarily dire inflation outlook at the 
aggregate level Looking ahead, average annual HICP inflation in 
the euro area is projected to rise sharply from 2.1% 

last year to 3.2% this year, before coming back to 

around 2.2% in 2009. In the EU, inflation is 

expected to mount from 2.4% in 2007 to 3.6% this 

year and to ease significantly to 2.4% in 2009. 

Compared to the autumn
, the new projections 
entail a sizable upward revision for 2008 (for both 

the euro area and the EU by 1.1 pps. and 1.2 pps., 

respectively), which reflects mainly higher 

commodity prices. For 2009, the inflation 

projection is revised up both for the euro area and 

the EU by 0.2 pp. 
In terms of quarterly profiles, inflation in the euro 
area is now deemed to have reached a peak in the 

first quarter of 2008 and expected to gradually 

decrease throughout the rest of the year, to fall 

below 3% in the last quarter. In the EU, the highest 

inflation rate is expected in the second quarter of 

2008, with gradual easing thereafter, though it is 

likely to remain above 3% until the first quarter of 

2009. In the beginning of next year, the 

unfavourable base effects from commodity price 

increases are projected to fade out, bringing the 

inflation rate steadily down from about 2.4% to 
2.1% at the end of the forecast horizon in the euro 
area and from 2.6% to 2.3% in the EU.  
The new projection for inflation originates 
externally from higher co
mmodity prices and, 
domestically by possible extra financial cost 

caused by the credit squeeze and certain 

acceleration in unit labour cost, albeit modest 

given the easing in the cyclical momentum. The 

annual rate of increase in
 total primary commodity 
prices (including fuels) is assumed to rise sharply 

from merely 1.3% in the first half of last year to 

nearly 50% in the first half of 2008, and lose 

momentum thereafter to de
crease slightly at the 
end of the forecast period, on account of falling 

fuel prices. On the othe
r hand, prices of other 
primary commodities are set to peak only in the 

third quarter of 2009. Meanwhile, the annual rate 

of increase of import prices
 is projected to increase 
from 1¼% in 2007 to about 2½% in 2008 and ease 

thereafter to 1½%.  
On the domestic side, the pipeline inflationary 
pressures from rising input
 costs, together with 
higher cost of capital following from the tighter 

credit conditions may induce firms to pass these 

extra costs onto consumers, especially in some 

segments of the market with lower competition. 

Moreover, growth in nominal unit labour costs in 

the euro area is expected to accelerate from 1.5% 

in 2007 to 2.4% in 2008 and 1.9% the following 

year. This profile is explained chiefly by the 

projected acceleration of 0.3 pp. in nominal 

compensation per employee over the forecast 

horizon (to 2.9% in 2009, following a temporary 

increase to 3.3% in 2008), while productivity gains 

remain broadly unchanged (at 1.0%), with a 

temporary slowdown in 
2008. The acceleration in 
wage growth appears in line with the maturing 

cyclical position of the euro area and the still tight 

labour market. The euro-area unemployment rate 

is foreseen to stay below the NAWRU in 2008, 

putting a slight upward pressure on wages and 

inflation. The unemployment rate should stabilise 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  44 around 7¼% until 2009, the lowest rate since the 
early 1990s. At the same time, the output gap is 

projected to close in 2008 and turn slightly 

negative by the end of the forecast horizon. 
Inflation prospects differ across Member States At the level of Member States, the upward 

revisions for 2008 were registered in all euro-area 

countries, however, the amplitude of corrections 

ranged from 0.4 pp. in Portugal and the 

Netherlands to 1.7 pp. in Slovenia, which implies 

bigger dispersion of inflation rates across the euro-

area member states. Among the largest countries, 

inflation in 2008 is set to increase in Germany to 

2.7%, in France and Italy to 3.0%, and in Spain to 

3.8%. In 2009 the picture is more mixed, as 

compared to the autumn, inflation has been revised 

upwards in most countries, but not in all of them 

(including e.g. Germany and Spain). This reflects, 

inter alia, different lag patterns of pass-through 

from high oil and food prices to headline inflation 

across member states, impact of indexation in 

some countries and diverging cyclical positions.

 Outside the euro area, inflation for 2008 was also 
revised up in all Member States, but particularly in 

five of them, which also happen to display some of 

the highest inflation rates in the EU: Estonia, 

Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and the Czech 

Republic. In 2009, inflation is set to ease again, 

although the projections ar
e in most cases higher 
compared to the autu
mn forecast. Among the 
larger non-euro-area Member States, inflation in 

Poland is set to increase to 4.3% in 2008 and 3.4% 

in 2009, while in the UK it is expected to rise to 

2.8% in 2008 and come down by ½ pp. one year 

later. The UK's inflation outlook is more benign 

than in the euro area 
despite the expected 
continued depreciation of the Sterling. This 
follows from a lower share of energy and food 
components in the HICP basket and favourable 

base effects pursuant to high inflation rates already 

one year ago.

 45 Continuous budgetary consolidation since 
2003 partly reversed in 2008  The general government budget deficit in 2007 
reached 0.6% of GDP in 
the euro area, down from 
1.3%, and 0.9% of GDP in the EU as a whole, 

compared to 1.4% in 2006. While the deficit thus 

declined for the fourth time in a row, this trend is 

expected to reverse in 2008, on the back of slower 

output growth and tax cuts 
in some countries. The 
deficit is projected to rise by 0.3 pps. in the EU, to 

1.2% of GDP, and by 0.4 pps. in the euro area, to 

1.0%. Based on the usual no-policy-change 

assumption, in 2009 the 
deficit is forecast to 
remain broadly unchanged in both the EU and the 

euro area. 
These projections largel
y confirm those of the 
2007 autumn forecast. Fo
r 2007, the deficits for 
both the euro area and the EU turned out 

somewhat lower than forecast in autumn. The 

deficit projections have remained broadly 

unchanged for 2008, whereas they have increased 

somewhat for 2009.  
The better-than-expected 
outcome for 2007 largely 
reflects a positive base ef
fect from a downward 
revision of the 2006 deficit, due to a slightly 

lower-than-projected revenue ratio being more 

than offset by a downward revised expenditure 

ratio. These improved results were partially carried 

over to 2007, with the revenue-to-GDP ratio 

remaining at the projected
 45.6% of GDP in the 
euro area (44.9% in the EU) and the expenditure-
to-GDP ratio turning out to be slightly lower than 
forecast in autumn (at 46.
3% in the euro area and 
45.8% in the EU).  
Over the forecast period, the revenue-to-GDP ratio 
is projected to decline from 45.6% in 2007 to 

45.2% in 2009 in the euro area (and from 44.9% to 

44.5% in the EU). This reflects discretionary tax 

cuts in a number of Member States, but also tax 

elasticities coming down 
from their exceptional 
heights in recent years to more normal levels. The 

expenditure ratio is expected to decline only 

marginally in the euro ar
ea, from 46.3% of GDP in 
2007 to 46.2% in 2009, and to remain unchanged 

at 45.8% in the EU.  
Correcting for cyclical factors, one-offs and other 
temporary measures, the st
ructural deficit in the 
euro area was at ¾% of GDP in 2007. This is the 

lowest level on record since the early 1970s. While 

the good economic performance was helpful in 

improving public finances, the outcome shows that 

a large part of the consolidation was of a 

discretionary nature, reflecting by and large 

prudent fiscal policies. It is possible, however, that 

the estimate for the struct
ural balance overstates 
the strength of the underlying budgetary position, 

notably on account of temporary favourable 

revenue surprises. In addition, the experience from 

the early years of this deca
de suggests that current 
estimates of potential output in 2007 may be on the 

high side and therefore u
nderestimate the cyclical 
part of the budgetary improvement. Future 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  46 revisions may therefore point to a less favourable 
underlying budgetary position.
  In 2008, the structural defi
cit is forecast to increase 
somewhat, in line with the headline balance, to 1% 

of GDP. In 2009, 
the structural deficit is forecast 
to edge down again. A similar pattern can be 

observed for the EU as a whole.

forecas
t Euro area: budgetary weakening in 2008, but 
all countries continue to respect the 3% of GDP 

reference value In 2007, no euro-area country had a budget deficit 
in excess of the 3% of GD
P reference value. While 
the projected weakening of
 the budgetary outlook 
in 2008 concerns most countries, with only 

Greece, Malta, the Netherlands and Portugal 

showing improvements in the headline balances 

compared to 2007, deficits
 are expected to remain 
below the 3% threshold across the board. The 

budgetary weakening mainly reflects the economic 

slowdown and tax cuts in some countries. For 

2009, the budgetary position is forecast to improve 

in five countries and remain unchanged in two 

others.  
For countries currently in the excessive deficit 
procedure (EDP), the 2007 outcomes confirm that 

the deficit has been brought below the 3% of GDP 

threshold in both Italy (1.9%) and Portugal (2.6%), 

in both cases by a larger margin than previously 

expected. The deficit is forecast to increase again 

in Italy, to reach 2.4%
 of GDP by 2009. In 
Portugal, after a further reduction in 2008 (to 

2.2%), the deficit is expected to rebound to 2.6% 

of GDP in 2009.  
For France, the deficit fo
r 2008 and especially 
2009 is revised upward compared to the autumn 

forecast, and with unchanged policy would reach 
3% of GDP in 2009. A deterioration of the fiscal 
outlook compared to the 
autumn 2007 forecast is 
also projected for Irela
nd, Spain and Germany. 
Conversely, the outlook has improved for Cyprus, 

Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Finland.  
For the remaining euro-area countries, the 
budgetary forecast has little changed compared to 

the autumn.  
Broadly in line with the developments in the 
headline balances, the u
nderlying structural 
budgetary position in 2008 is forecast to 

deteriorate in all countri
es but Belgium, Greece, 
Malta, the Netherlands and Portugal. In 2009, 

against the background of 
less favourable cyclical 
conditions, the structural position is forecast to 

improve in the majority of countries, particularly 

in Malta and Slovenia, while it is expected to 

worsen in Ireland, Spain and Portugal.    
Outside the euro area, budgetary outlook 
improved for all four EDP countries  Outside the euro area, 
the budgetary outlook 
improved compared to th
e autumn forecast in all 
four Member States cu
rrently subject to the 
excessive deficit procedure. In the Czech Republic, 

Poland and Slovakia, the deficit fell clearly below 

the 3% of GDP reference 
value already in 2007. 
Over the forecast period, the deficit is projected to 

decline further in the Czech
 Republic to 1.1% by 
2009, to remain broadly unchanged in Slovakia, at 

2.3%, and to rebound to 2.6% in Poland. 

Following a much better-than-expected 

consolidation effort in 2007 and smaller 

improvements over the forecast horizon, Hungary 

is expected to post a deficit of 3.6% of GDP in 

2009.  
Also for Denmark and, to a lesser extent, Romania, 
the outlook improved compared to the autumn 

forecast. By contrast, the projections for the 

headline balance have worsened compared to the 

autumn 2007 forecast for Estonia and Latvia and, 

to a lesser extent, also for Lithuania, Sweden and 

the UK. Due to the worsen
ed outlook for the UK, 
the deficit is forecast to
 exceed the 3% of GDP 
reference value in both of the financial years 2008-

2009 and 2009-2010. For Romania, despite a slight 

improvement of the fiscal
 outlook, the projections 
continue to show a strong widening of the deficit 

over the forecast period (from 2.5% in 2007 to 

close to 3% in 2008 and 3¾ % in 2009).

weaken in 2008 in most
 countries, the major 
exceptions being Hungary, Denmark and the 

Czech Republic. For 2009, 
the structural position 
is set to improve in all countries but Denmark 

Romania and Slovakia.   
Debt continues its downward path In the euro area, the debt ratio continues its decline 

that started in 2006. Between 2007 and 2009, it is 

expected to continue to 
decrease by more than 2 
pps, to some 64¼% of GDP, confirming the trend 

anticipated in the autumn 
forecast, albeit at a lower 
pace particularly in 2009.
 In the EU27 as a whole 
debt has fallen below the 60% of GDP reference 

value already in 2007. After a temporary halt in 

2008, the downward trend is expected to continue 

in 2009.  
The decreasing trend over the period 2007-2009 is 
shared by all euro-area c
ountries except Ireland, 
France, Luxembourg and Portugal, albeit to 

varying degrees. Compared
 to the autumn 2007 
forecast the debt projections have been revised 

upward for a slight majority of Member States, 

notable exceptions from this trend being Cyprus, 

the Netherlands and Slovenia. The debt ratio 

dropped below the 60% of GDP reference value in 

2007 in Cyprus and Austria.
 It is expected to fall 
below the reference value by 2009 in Malta. In 
Germany, it is forecast to
 decline to about 61½% 
of GDP by 2009.  
Outside the euro area, debt is decreasing in the 
majority of Member States over the period 2007-

2009. Notable exceptions to this trend are Latvia, 

Romania and the UK. 
7. RISKS TO THE FORECAST 
   48 Unusual uncertainty char
acterises the current 
economic situation, as most of the risks to the 

outlook for growth and inflation identified in 

autumn last year have started to materialise 

simultaneously. The global economy is cooling 

and, in particular, the US economy appears 

markedly more fragile. Weakening US labour 

markets and consumer demand in the first half of 

2008 suggest that the US could slip into recession. 

The financial turmoil is spreading and intensifying. 

Commodity prices are increasing further.  
Since the beginning of the financial turbulence in 
July 2007, however, evidence of negative effects 

on the 'real' economy is meagre. This partly stems 

from the fact that European economies were in a 

sound position in 2007, more resilient to external 

shocks. Moreover, central banks, including the 

ECB have injected liquidity in the system in order 

to secure the smooth functioning of the financial 

markets. On the nomin
al side, second-round 
effects from increases in 
oil and commodity prices 
have been largely absent so far. With some of the 

risks identified in 
the autumn forecast 
materialising and, as no surprise, GDP growth 

started to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2007. 

Other risks have been incorporated into the current 

outlook to a greater degree, pointing to a further 

easing ahead, even if the Commission's new 

baseline forecast is not without risks.  
Risks to the 
growth outlook 
relate first to the 
slowdown in the United States. A worse-than-

foreseen contraction in the US could dampen 

world growth further through the trade impact and, 

possibly more importantly, spillover effects on the 

financial markets and confidence. In addition, the 

slowdown in world growth has so far been 

relatively mild, but could prove to be larger in the 

course of this year, if the downturn in US growth 

starts to bite in emerging markets economies and 

oil-producing economies 
to a greater extent.  
Second, the financial crisis, which originated in the 
US subprime mortgage market last summer, is 

spreading. While the turmoil in the financial 

markets has proven more persistent than assumed 

last autumn, its impact on the real economy has 

been relatively limited so far. A lagged impact is to 

be expected, as loan growth reacts with a lag to 

changes in lending standa
rds, and a credit squeeze 
could emerge going forward. Credit-losses may 
also prove larger than 
expected and might also 
surface in countries that 
are less directly exposed 
to the financial distress, as a substantial amount of 

outstanding loans are held in other countries than 

the originating country. As of mid-April, 

announced losses and write-downs of financial 

institutions have amounted to about USD 300 

billion. Around half of this originates in US-based 

banks and a further 40 percent in European banks 

(a third of which is explained by Swiss banks). 

With first quarter reporting still under way, 

announced losses are likely to rise further in the 

coming weeks. 
Following the collapse of confidence in the 
financial markets, credit spreads rose to and 

remain at elevated levels 
(not only compared to the 
level of last summer, when risks were compressed 

to an unsustainable low level, but also above long-

term averages). However, this is partly 

compensated by lower government bond yields. 

The turmoil will be more long-lasting and it cannot 

be excluded that credit conditions, such as 

increased collateral re
quirements, and credit 
availability are more seriously affected than 

assumed in the current GDP outlook.  
More adverse shifts in investor and consumer 
confidence cannot be ruled 
out. A negative wealth 
effect, due to falling real and financial asset prices 

could hamper domestic demand. Hikes in inflation 

rates observed recently in Europe could also (as is 

already the case in some co
untries) have a further 
impact on consumer confidence, on top of the 

current declining trend in
 consumer confidence 
due to the turmoil itself.  
The impact of a further tightening of lending 
conditions and reduced credit availability is likely 

to be asymmetric across Member States. In 

particular, countries experiencing a housing market 

correction may be hit more adversely, not only in 

the US, but also in the EU, especially Ireland and 

Spain. The exposure to and impact from the 

current distress in the financial markets differ 

across Member States. Countries having had a 

housing boom in the recent 
past, with high external 
deficit and debt or a high share of debt at variable 

interest rates are likely to be more exposed than 

others. Moreover, the difficult intermediation due 

to the ill-functioning segments of the financial 

markets adds to these risk
s at the current juncture. 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
    49 Current-account imbalances
 in some EU Member 
States could raise concern in terms of their 

financing and sustainability. This reflects partly 

the increased heterogeneity within the EU, as the 

catching-up process may 
involve sizeable current-
account deficits. Differences are, however, also 

large and growing within the euro area. The rising 

burden of the external de
bt service implies a loss 
of domestically available income, which ultimately 

hampers growth. The ongoing financial market 

turmoil, by hampering the smooth flow of funds 

within the euro area and the EU, increases the risks 

for the financing of large current account deficits. 
Other downside risks to the growth outlook relate 
to the possibility of disruptive exchange-rate 

developments associated with the continuation of 

significant current account imbalances (although 

the US deficit, on our assumptions, is projected to 

narrow further over the forecast period). 

Furthermore, the risk of protectionist and other 

trade-distorting measures is sustained, possibly 

fuelled by the surge in food prices. Further 

appreciation of the euro, 
possibly reaching levels unheard of so far, would weigh on economic 

activity. 
On the upside, though, th
e current scenario of a 
global growth slowdown could turn out to be 

shorter than foreseen in the baseline. In particular, 

the underlying strength of emerging markets may 

have been underestimated. Growth in the United 

States could also rebound sooner and in a more 

dynamic way than foreseen, as a result of the 

strong monetary and fiscal easing, but where the 

impact of the stimulus is
 surrounded by a sizeable 
degree of uncertainty. Within EU economies, 

upside risks to the growth outlook relate to 

relatively sound fundamentals, allowing European 

economies to withstand the current headwinds 

better. The importance of the still positive 

employment growth in the regular labour market 

on consumption propensity may also have been 

underestimated.  
Graph 2.7.1 provides a quantification of these risks 
in terms of the possible deviation of output growth 

from the main scenario. More specifically, the 

graph shows the impact various combinations of 

risks could have on euro-area GDP growth, the 

outcomes being weighted by the probability of 

their occurrence. At a 90
% confidence interval, 
GDP growth in the euro area could be 1 pp. lower 

in 2008 compared to the central scenario if all 
negative factors materialise. But growth could also 
be up to 0.9 pp. higher if the positive risks to the 

outlook were to materialise.

Euro area GDP forecasts: 
Uncertainty linked the balance of risks
 As regards the 
inflation outlook
, the risks 
identified in the autumn 
forecast of a further up-
tick in commodity prices have already materialised 

and have had a direct impact on consumer price 

inflation. This is currently also contributing to 

social unrest in parts of the developing world.  
Within the EU, a certain impact from soaring oil- 
and especially food prices on inflation expectations 

(see graph 2.7.2) and subsequently on wage claims 

has been noted in some Member States. In 

particular, some of the recently-acceded Member 

States are witnessing double-digit inflation rates in 

the first months of 2008 (e.g the Baltic States). 

These countries are more vulnerable and could be 

subject to second-round 
effects in the coming 
months. Economies with a sound external position, 

strong cyclical growth (e
.g. the Czech Republic 
and Poland) and credible policy frameworks are 

less sensitive to the outburst of inflationary 

pressures.

 Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  50 On the other hand, the risk
 of second-round effects 
is considered to be relatively small, as competitive 

pressure from globalisation is expected to limit the 

acceleration in wage growth at the aggregated 

level. Simultaneously, labour market tensions are 

expected to ease as the unemployment rate 

stabilises and the unemployment gap gradually 

becomes positive again.  
Moreover, in view of a general moderation of 
growth, domestic inflationary pressures should 

ease going forward. In particular, if commodity 

prices were to decline faster than futures' markets 

suggest, and if oil prices
 eventually recede owing 
to a slowdown in GDP growth, notably in the 

United States. Some investors' preferences have 

shifted away from financial assets given their 

riskiness and towards 
commodities in recent 
months. As tensions on equity markets fade, 

investors could return to a more regular bundle of 

assets, which would cease putting upward pressure 

on commodities. On the other hand, commodity 

prices have surprised on the upside several years in 

a row, and a gradual decline in the coming years is 

not a certainty.  
Overall, while risks are more balanced than in the 
autumn 2007 forecast, the balance of risks for the 

growth outlook continues to be tilted to downside, 

especially for 2009, while risks for inflation are 

somewhat on the upside, and, in particular, for 

some of the recently-acceded Member States. 
To conclude, risks to the forecast appear more 
balanced in 2008 and 2009. Given the number of 

risks though, and the unusual surrounding 

uncertainty, an 
alternative scenario
 is presented in 
Box 2.7.1, which simulates the macroeconomic 

impact of a further tightening of financial 

conditions (an increase in spreads and a further 

tightening of collateral requirements), and 

spillovers from the United States. The results show 

that all risks taken together would entail a 

significant additional loss in output of some 0.5 pp. 

this year and a further 0.1 pp. for both the euro 

area and the US next year compared to the baseline 
scenario contained in this forecast.

  51  Box 2.7.1: 
Alternative scenario for the euro area: a credit-squeeze would further dampen 
domestic demand
This box briefly presents the results of the 
simulations that were carried out by the 
Commission services to describe the impact 
relative to the baseline of (1) a further deterioration 
of the housing market in both the US and the euro 
area, resulting from an increase in the collateral 
requirement for households (both in the US and the 

euro area); (2) an increase 
in the interest rate spread 
of 50 bps both in the US and the euro area; and  (3) 
the combination of these two shocks.  
The results presented in this box are obtained with 
the Commission's QUEST III model which is a 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) 
model, with forward-looking agents. It comprises 
nominal and real rigidities, and assumes two kinds 

of households, Ricardian and liquidity-constrained 
households. 
Model simulations indicate that a more pronounced 
financial distress dampens domestic demand. 
Simulations with the QUEST III model indicate 

that the impact of (1), th
at is, an increase in the 
collateral requirement for households (causing a 
decline of the mortgage-debt-to-GDP ratio by 5% 

in the medium run), would affect investment and 
consumption directly, both in 2008 and in 2009.  
Credit rationing by banks affects both housing 
investment and private consumption, as it reduces 
credit availability for less wealthy households who 

borrow against the value of their houses. Relative 
to the baseline scenario, this 'domestic demand'- 
channel would reduce euro-area and US GDP 
growth in the first year.  
An increase in interest-rate spreads (2) affects the 
cost of capital for both business and residential 
investment. For credit-constrained households, 
higher credit costs tighten their budget constraint 

and therefore reduce consumption relative to the 
baseline, see table 1. The fall in consumption is 
relatively large, as credit-constrained households 
cannot smooth their consumption but have to 
respond immediately to credit restriction by 
reducing their residential investment and 

consumption.  
The combined effect of a collateral tightening and 
increased interest-rate spreads (3) would reduce 
GDP growth in both the euro area and the US by 
0.5 pp. in 2008 and a further 0.1 pp. in 2009 
relative to the baseline. With the current baseline 
scenario, this would mean a euro-area GDP growth 
of 1.2% in 2008 and 1.4% in 2009. 
How euro-area growth prospects would be further 
affected by an additional slide in the value of the 
dollar depends on the driving factors behind it. If, 
for example, a further depreciation of the dollar 

was driven by a shift in investors' preferences away 
from the dollar in favour of the euro, it might have 
a negative impact in the short run on the tradable 
sector, but this would be mitigated in the medium 
run by the positive domestic demand effects from 
lower real interest rates in the euro area.

t54 Activity in 2007 GDP growth came out at 2.7% in 2007 and was 
mainly driven by domestic demand. In line with 

the global deceleration, growth gradually slowed 

down towards the end of 2007.  
Private consumption was buoyant in the first three 
quarters of the year, mainly on the back of 

increasing real household disposable income. 

Rapidly increasing inflation and a deterioration of 

the economic environment, with a negative impact 

on consumer confidence, led to a slowdown in 

consumption growth from 0.9% qoq in the first 

three quarters to an estimated 0.4% in the fourth 

quarter. Investment growth was impressive in the 

first quarter and gradually fell to more moderate 

levels afterwards. Despite
 the slower growth of 
export markets and the a
ppreciation of the euro, 
exports recovered from the unusually low 

expansion rate in 2006 as Belgian exporters were 

able to limit their loss of
 market share. Imports 
increased faster, however, so that the contribution 

of net exports to GDP growth became negative. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 Given the deteriorating international environment, 

strongly rising inflation and tighter financing 

conditions, both for corporations and households, 

economic growth in Belgium is set to continue its 

decelerating trend in the next quarters, before 

slowly picking up towards the end of 2008 (see 

graph). This is projected to result in an annual 

growth rate of 1.7% in 2008 and 1½% in 2009. 
Private consumption growth
 is forecast to weaken 
as the slowdown in employ
ment creation, the peak 
in inflation and smaller real wage increases will 

lead to a slower growth of real disposable income. 

Furthermore, the transformation of part of the 

health insurance system for self employed from a 

voluntary private scheme to an obligatory state-run 

system will negatively affect consumption growth 

in 2008. On the other hand, households are likely 

to smooth consumption to a certain extent; their 

saving rate is set to decline in 2008 and stabilise in 

2009. 
Projected slower real disposable income growth 
and lower confidence levels, together with an 

expected tightening of banks' lending conditions 

and a partly related softening of the housing 

market after a number 
of years with rapidly 
increasing prices, are proj
ected to induce a marked 
slowdown in housing investment. Deteriorating 

demand conditions, the unusually high level of 

uncertainty and less beneficial financing 

conditions are likely to put a drag on corporate 

investment in the forecast years. Government 

investment is set to return to its trend growth. 
Finally, export growth is expected to suffer from 
weakening foreign demand while Belgian 

exporters are also projected to continue to loose 

market share. Import growth is also expected to 

slow, reflecting weakening final demand. Net 

external demand is forecast to make a negative 

contribution to GDP growth of 0.2 percentage 

points in both 2008 and 2009.  
Labour market, costs and prices Employment kept rising rapidly in 2007 (1.7%), 

reflecting the continued positive impact of buoyant 

economic activity on the labour market, but also 

the creation of a large number of subsidised jobs 

under the system of "cheques services". In view of 

weaker economic growth, 
employment is forecast 
to increase at a slower p
ace in 2008 (0.9%) and 
2009 (0.4%). As a result, the unemployment rate is 

expected to rise slightly in 2009, after a sustained 

decrease between 2005 and 2008.  
HICP inflation has remained contained in 2007 
(1.8%), as the energy component has exerted a 

moderating effect. In 2008, inflation is set to rise 

to 3.6% in view of higher processed food and 

energy prices on global
 markets. The main gas

   55 providers implemented large price increases and 
distribution costs for gas and electricity were 

raised, which is projected to result in an inflation 

rate above the euro ar
ea average. The gradual 
transmission of these higher prices into a wide 

range of goods and services should result in a still 

relatively high inflation rate of 2.3% in 2009. 
The sharp price increase will have a lagged impact 
on nominal wages as these are automatically 

adapted to a measure of pa
st inflation. Although 
this measure excludes a nu
mber of goods, such as 
motor fuels, for which inflation has been 

particularly high in recent months, wages are 

projected to increase 
more than in the 
neighbouring countries in 2008. Wage 

developments in 2009 will depend on the outcome 

of the upcoming bargaining rounds, but are 

forecast to be largely in 
line with those in France, 
Germany and the Netherlands. 
Public finances The budget balance amount
ed to -0.2% of GDP in 
2007. This is 0.5 p.p. below the budget target, in 

spite of stronger-than-expected economic growth. 

The difference is largel
y due to the non-execution 
of a package of revenue-raising one-offs for 0.4% 
of GDP however, resulting in a slight improvement 
of the structural balance in 2007.  
Given the difficulties encountered in forming a 
new federal government following the elections of 

June 10 2007, a budget for 2008 could only be 

agreed by the end of February, once a new interim 

government had been formed. The government 

targets a balanced budget and plans limited deficit-

increasing measures (0
.1% of GDP), mainly 
aiming at increasing purchasing power and 

lowering labour taxation for the most vulnerable 

households. The budget is however based on quite 

optimistic macro-econo
mic assumptions. In 
addition, a number of measures, such as the 

imposition of a specific tax on the energy sector 

(0.1% of GDP) or the collection of additional 

corporate taxes following more effective fraud 

detection (0.1% of GDP),
 are not sufficiently 
documented to be taken into account in the 

forecast. Overall, a defic
it of around 0.4% of GDP 
can be expected for 2008. As for 2009, on a no-

policy-change basis, a further slight deterioration 

of the deficit to around 0.6% of GDP is forecast, 

reflecting the weaker ec
onomic environment. 
The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain on a 
downward path, falling to just below 80% in 2009.

t56 Activity in 2007 Driven by buoyant domestic demand, real GDP 
growth remained strong in 2007, at 6.2%, despite a 

sharp drop in activity in agriculture. On the back of 

record-high FDI inflows 
and a re-acceleration of 
bank credit, gross fixed capital formation was 

particularly strong, incr
easing by 21.7%. Private 
consumption, however, decelerated to 5.3%, down 

from 9.5% in 2006, despite very high wage 

increases and relatively strong employment growth 

implying a rising household savings ratio. In 

contrast, public consumption was boosted by a 

large additional spending package in late 2007, 

accelerating to 3.1% in real terms. The 

composition of growth remained fairly unbalanced 

with a strong negative contribution of net exports 

at around 5% of GDP. 
Export performance was 
exceptionally weak in 
2007. Growth of goods exports remained 

substantially below import growth and, as a result, 

the trade deficit widened further to 25.5% of GDP. 

This weak export performance may reflect an 

underreporting of intra-EU trade flows caused by 

the introduction of the Intrastat system upon 

accession. A decrease in net current transfers and 

negative net incomes from abroad led to a further 

worsening in the current account deficit. Net 

borrowing vis-à-vis the rest
 of the world increased 
to around 21% of GDP in 2007. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 The Bulgarian economy has been fairly resilient to 

the global financial markets turmoil in 2007. 

Nevertheless, the deterioration in the international 
economic outlook is expected
 to have an impact on 
the economy and lead to 
a slow-down in economic 
activity. Real GDP growth will thus moderate to 

below 6% in 2008 and 2009, although the 

catching-up process, in 
terms of GDP per capita, 
remains vibrant. 
Prolonged and growing uncertainty on the 
international financial markets, a more protracted 

slow-down in world growth, and higher external 

oil, food and commodity prices will imply a 

deceleration in domestic demand. Tighter global 

liquidity conditions, rising interest rate spreads, 

and lower returns are expected to bring a decrease 

in FDI and investment growth. Private 

consumption growth will also moderate due to 

higher inflation and lower bank credit growth. 

However, relatively strong wage and robust 

employment growth as well as the favourable 

impact from the reduction in personal income 

taxation on disposable income should limit this 

deceleration. On the external side, exports are expected to 
recover from the dip in 2007 as the large build-up 

in investments over recent years starts to improve 

the export potential of the economy. At the same 

time, in line with weaker domestic demand, import 

growth should cool down. The negative 

contribution of net exports to growth will thus 

decrease. With the trade de
ficit starting to narrow, 
a gradual reduction in the current account deficit is 

foreseen. This, together with strong capital 

transfers from the EU, should help reduce the net 

borrowing of the economy to around 19% of GDP 

in 2009. 
Labour market, costs and prices Employment growth decelerated slightly from 

3.3% in 2006 to 2.8% in 2007. Against robust 

economic activity, employment will continue to 

grow, albeit at a deceler
ating rate. Increasing 
participation rates and possible hiring of workers 

from abroad would mitigate 
to a certain extent the 
tightness in labour supply. Unemployment is 

projected to decline furthe
r to below 6% in 2009. 
In line with the tightened labour market conditions, 
nominal wage growth has accelerated sharply since 

the end of 2006 to around 18% on average in 2007. 

Wage pressures will remain substantial over the

   57 forecast period. However, nominal wage growth 
may decelerate from the currently high levels as a 

result of weaker labour demand due to rising wage 

costs and employment rationalization in the public 

sector. Labour productivity 
is expected to increase 
to around 4½% and growth in nominal unit labour 

costs would thus decelerat
e, especially in 2009. 
Consequently, real unit labour costs will start to 

decrease after the shar
p acceleration in 2007. 
HICP inflation remained high, increasing from 
7.4% on average in 2006 to 7.6% in 2007. On the 

back of considerably rising oil and food prices and 

increasing demand pressures, inflation accelerated 

substantially in the second half of 2007, reaching 

11.6% at the end of the 
year. In 2008, annual 
average inflation is expect
ed to increase further to 
around 10% due to higher oil, food and commodity 

prices and sustained wage pressures. In 2009, 

HICP inflation is projected to moderate thanks to 

base effects and a certain moderation in wage 

growth. 
Public finances The general government surplus reached 3½% of 

GDP in 2007, against an of
ficial target of about 
¾% in the budget law.
 The budgetary over-
performance was entirely due to higher-than-
expected revenue reflecting favourable growth 
composition, higher inflation and improved tax 

compliance. Expenditure control was, however, 

not fully maintained. Initially envisaged savings of 

current expenditures were not implemented, 

pensions were increased by more than prescribed 

in the law, and an additi
onal spending package of 
around 2% of GDP was approved in late 2007. 
The general government budget surplus is 
expected to remain high at slightly above 3% of 

GDP in 2008 and 2009. A small drop in the 

revenue-to-GDP ratio in 2008 is linked to the 

impact of the introduction of a 10% flat-rate 

personal income tax, 
the decrease in social 
contributions in 2007, and a less tax rich growth 

composition. On the expenditure side, efforts to 

contain the public sector wage bill will imply a 

slight reduction of the overall expenditure ratio. In 

2009, the projection is based on a no-policy-

change assumption. 
In line with strong nominal GDP growth and 
continued high primary fiscal surpluses, general 

government gross debt is expected to drop to close 

to 10% of GDP by 2009.

58 Activity in 2007 The strong expansion of the Czech economy 
continued in 2007 with record annual GDP growth 

of 6½%. The growth was mainly driven by strong 

domestic demand while trade balance and stock 

building also contributed positively to the growth 

performance.  
The surge in consumer spending was underpinned 
by a number of factors including climbing wage 

levels, falling unemployment, expanding credit 

and an increase in social benefits. Gross fixed 

capital formation remained strong channelling 

mainly into construction, transport infrastructure, 

machinery and transport 
equipment. Export and 
import growth rates were 14.5% and 13.7% 

respectively. The foreign 
trade balance was higher 
than expected recording 
a surplus for the third 
consecutive year. The inco
me account registered a 
widening deficit chiefly due to the outflow of 

profits from the current FDI, thus adversely 

affecting the current ac
count balance. On the 
supply side, and linked to high export growth, 

manufacturing performed very well, in particular 

the automotive and electronics sectors. With 

regard to the financial turmoil the Czech economy 

is likely to be less exposed due to the focus of the 

banking sector on the retail sector and the 

relatively low indebtedness of households.
 Prospects for 2008 and 2009  Economic growth is foreseen to slow down to 
about 4.7% in 2008, before edging up again to 

5.0% in 2009. Domestic demand is set to continue 

as the main driver of growth, while contribution 
from the foreign balance is likely to remain 
positive. Consumer spending growth is expected to 

decelerate in 2008, ow
ing primarily to the 
measures envisaged in the stabilisation package, 

before regaining momentum in 2009. The increase 

in the lower band of VAT will weigh on 

consumption as well as the surge in inflation, 

partly due to increases in
 regulated prices at the 
beginning of 2008.  
Investment growth is expected to be solid 
supported by FDI and by EU funds. While export 

growth was stronger than anticipated in 2007, it is 

expected to moderate under the influence of a high 

koruna during 2008 before
 receiving a boost in 
2009 from the start-up of a large new automotive 

plant. Imports are likely to
 be affected by slowing 
consumer demand. The trade balance is expected 

to remain in surplus for 2008 and 2009. 

Government consumption is expected to be 

constrained during 2008 and 2009, reflecting the 

aim of fiscal consolidation envisaged in the 

stabilisation package and 2008 budget. 
Labour market, costs and prices In spite of government incentives to stimulate the 

labour market, employment growth is likely to 

moderate slightly in 2008 due to the overall 

slowdown, planned cuts to public sector 

employment, and as a consequence of significant 

employment growth in 2007 which has brought the 

unemployment level to a record low since 

transition. Wage increases
 are generally expected 
to remain strong given rising inflation in 2008. 
Inflation remained low until the fourth quarter of 
2007 when it began to escalate due mainly to 

rising food and fuel prices. A range of 

administrative measures stoked inflation at the 

beginning of 2008. A further rise in excise duty, 

the introduction of environmental taxes and the 

increase in the lower VAT rate from 5 to 9% 

effective from January 2008 have all contributed to 

greater inflationary pressure. While inflation is 

expected to remain high, at over 6% for 2008, 

there are a number of mitigating influences which 

are likely to ensure a 
gradual decline in the 
medium-term: notably, moderate consumer 

spending, public expenditure restraint, and a firm 

koruna which will act as an offsetting factor 

against external price shocks.

   59 Public finances Government finances were significantly better-
than-targeted in 2007. The government deficit fell 

to just above 1½% of GDP. The better-than-

expected out-turn was du
e to increased revenue 
from record high growth while government 

expenditure was also restrained. Given the much 

better base in 2007, it is anticipated that the deficit 

will continue to be reduced to 1.4% of GDP in 

2008 and about 1% of GDP in 2009. This is based 

on the estimated impact of the stabilisation 

package, aimed at further consolidation, the 

introduction of partial charges for basic health 

care, and continued government expenditure 

restraint, particularly with respect to public sector 

employment and other government consumption 

expenditure. The main downside risks to this 

forecast relate to the expected moderation in 

economic growth and the inflationary pressure in 

2008 which may impact on public sector wage 

demands. The range of changes occurring to direct 

and indirect taxation at the same time makes 

forecasting revenues difficult. The continued use 

of reserve funds, in which government 

departments roll over spending allocations, also 

adds some uncertainty to expenditure. The reserve 

funds expanded to about 2.8% of GDP in 2007, of 

which it is estimated around a third could 

potentially swell future spending. The other two-
thirds are related to EU funds and, as such, backed 
up by revenues. 
The Czech government adopted a proposal in 
January 2008 on compensation for the confiscation 

of churches by the communist regime. Should the 

compensation be approved by parliament it has the 

potential to temporarily, but in a significant way 

increase the general government deficit in the 

forecast period. However, on a no-policy change 

basis, this measure is not taken into account in the 

forecast.  As a result of firm growth over the forecast period 
and the fiscal contraction, the government debt 

ratio is expected to fall to below 28% of GDP by 

2009.

60 Activity in 2007 The slowdown of growth in Denmark predates the 
global trend and is due to capacity constraints 

following a period of high growth. GDP growth 

rate was reduced by more than half to below 2% in 

2007. Growth weakened 
in all major demand 
components, most significantly in construction 

investment reflecting the cooling down of the 

housing market. 
Private consumption growth nonetheless exceeded 
the annual average of the past decade. This 

reflected continued strong employment growth and 

low inflation boosting the real disposable income 

of households. In spite of the negative 

developments in financial markets and the 

stagnation in the housing market, there was a 

strong rebound in consumption and investment in 

the second half of the year. With domestic 

production capacity being constrained, export 

growth declined and imports were required to 

cover an increasing share of the strong domestic 

demand. The net external balance therefore 

continued to contribute negatively to GDP growth. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 GDP growth is set to moderate further over the 

forecast period reflecting the turn of the cycle as 

well as international tre
nds. The deceleration takes 
place amidst high inflatio
n, a stagnating housing 
market and higher financing costs. Overall, GDP 

growth is expected to slow to 1¼% in 2008 and 

1% in 2009, remaining well below potential, 

providing for an easing of capacity constraints. 
Private consumption is fore
seen to gear down as 
wealth effects taper off and higher inflation and 

interest payments reduce disposable household 

income. Meanwhile the strong labour market 

position, sizable wage increases, tax cuts being 

implemented in 2008 and 2009, and stable interest 

rates over the forecast period are counterbalancing 

factors implying that private consumption will 

continue to drive growth. 
The housing market is key to domestic demand on 
the back of a boom over the 2004-2006 period. So 

far, price developments have varied significantly 

across regions and real estate categories. On 

average, they do not suggest a major general 

downward correction. Forced sales have remained 

at a low level, and household wealth is assessed to 

be sufficient to cushion the blow from falling real 

and financial asset prices. A soft landing remains 

the central scenario, where broadly stagnating 

nominal house prices over time will imply a 

gradual correction as real disposable incomes catch 

up. Assuming stable long-term interest rates at the 

current level, a severe downward adjustment is 

unlikely. Nevertheless, it remains a prominent 

downside risk, potentially restraining private 

consumption via the impact on wealth and 

consumer confidence.  
Weaker investment activity, notably in housing 
construction, is the principle factor behind the 

moderation of growth. The ratio of housing-

investments-to-GDP is fore
seen to recede from the 
currently highest level in the past 30 years. This is 

driven by the combination of stagnating house 

prices and increasing construction costs reducing 

profitability. The gloomy outlook is reflected in 

survey data of the construction sector. However, 

should housing construction fail to come down, 

excess supply would increase 
the risk of a stronger 
correction in house prices. 
Equipment investment has reached a high level. In 
view of the high capacity utilisation and labour 

shortages further investments are nonetheless 

expected in 2008 to 
raise the capital stock. 
Meanwhile the ongoing financial turmoil is 

expected to reduce the pr
opensity to invest as 
financing costs increase and asset prices fall.  
A moderation of export growth is foreseen in view 
of lower global growth and the effective exchange

capacity pressures are expected to ease and import 

growth to decelerate. Overall, it is foreseen that the 

external balance is moving to a more neutral 

impact on GDP growth. 
Labour market, costs and prices The labour market is generally expected to remain 

tight. After a period of substantial gains, 

employment is forecast to 
start declining slightly 
during the course of 2008 and into 2009, notably in 

the construction sector. Nevertheless, the 

unemployment rate is predicted to remain around 

the historically low level over the forecast period.  
Productivity is assumed to improve after a very 
weak growth in 2007. Wage growth has picked up 

and is expected to remain higher than in previous 

years over the forecast peri
od. Inflation is foreseen 
to follow global trends, where increasing energy 

and food prices erode consumer purchasing power. 

Domestic inflationary pressures are also expected 

to rise, albeit from a low level. Overall, inflation is 

expected to come down during the course of 2009 

while remaining high by historical standards. 
Public finances The strong labour market position is expected to 

benefit public finances both in terms of revenue 

and expenditure. The tax burden is foreseen to 

decrease by 1 percentage 
point over the forecast 
period, primarily due to income tax cuts, the 

continued application of the tax freeze (
1), and the 
reintroduction of the special pension contribution 

(SP). The suspension of the SP expires by the end 

of 2008 implying a reintroduction of the 

compulsory saving scheme. Due to the tax 

treatment of contributions, tax revenue is foreseen 

to decrease by ¼ % of GD
P. Measures to stem 
recurrent spending overruns by local governments 

are to be agreed in budget negotiations in mid-

2008 to ensure that expenditure growth limits are 

respected. 
The trend of high general government surpluses is 
foreseen to continue, albeit declining from 4½% of 

GDP in 2007 to around 3% 
in 2009 as cyclical and 
temporary effects subside. Gross government debt 

is forecast to fall well below 20% of GDP.

 from 2002 onwards, neither

62 Activity in 2007  Demand and output growth slowed towards the 
end of the year, not so mu
ch under the impact of 
the financial turmoil, but due to a setback in 

private consumption. Employment growth has 

traditionally been the main determinant of private 

consumption, both on the positive side in the 

1990s and on the negative side in the first half of 

this decade.  
Since the onset of the last recovery, this close 
relationship has been troubled by a number of one-

off factors. While the 
anticipation of the VAT 
increase led to a temporary increase in private 

consumption in 2006, the negative echo-effects of 

this could be felt in 2007. In addition, in the last 

quarter of 2007 the self-employed and family-

owned companies may have availed of the 

improved depreciation rules in operation until the 

end of 2007 to invest at the expense of 

consumption. Of greater importance, however, 

seems to be the strong acceleration of inflation, 

which has a particular impact on consumer 

confidence because it is concentrated in high 

frequency purchases like fuel and food. 
On the other hand, the above-mentioned phasing-
out of improved depreciation rules boosted 

investment in machinery and equipment in 2007, 

which also benefited from sound external demand. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 The reduction in the statistical carry-over from 

2007 explains about half of the downward revision 

of growth in 2008 compared with the autumn 
forecast. Going forward, gr
owth is set to remain 
relatively stable in 2008 and to moderately 

accelerate in the course 
of 2009. The positive 
fundamentals underlying private consumption 

should prevail as the temporary effects of the VAT 

increase and the improved depreciation rules will 

not weigh on private consumption again in 2008 

and inflation is forecast to decelerate in the second 

half of 2008. With a declining but still positive 

employment growth and accelerating wage 

increases, rising real disposable income will help 

private consumption to pick up moderately. 

Improved job security will also be supportive, as 

unemployment should fall towards 7% in 2009 Œ

lower by one-third than in 2005. This could boost 

households' spending propensity, thereby lowering 

the persistently high savings rate. 
With the weakening of the external environment 
and the appreciation of the euro, corporate 

investment, while remaining an important growth 

contributor, is set to slow down. This is also 

supported by recent domes
tic investment orders 
and production data. The impact of the financial 

turmoil on credit to enterprises is manifesting itself 

in a stricter risk assessment by banks, particularly 

for companies with a relatively low owner capital 

share. In contrast, growth of credit to enterprises 

has clearly accelerated since summer 2007. 

Moreover, the balance sheet restructuring 

undertaken in recent years,
 as well as the healthy 
profit situation, have led to a sound overall 

financial situation of enterprises in Germany. 

Collectively, the sector has a positive net savings 

that allow investments to be financed from own 

resources and makes companies less vulnerable to 
Member States, Germany 
  63 the potential impacts of the financial turmoil. 
Fluctuation in economic activity in the first two 
quarters is driven by construction investment 

profiting from unusual warm weather conditions in 

the winter months, reducing the seasonal pick-up 

in spring. Independently from this short term 

swing, public investment will continue to profit 

from pent-up demand for infrastructure investment 

and improved public finances, also at the local 

level. In contrast, housing investment should 

remain stable until the end of 2009. Since, in 

contrast to most economies, German house prices 

have been stable in recent years and the 

construction sector has declined since the middle 

of the 1990s, the financial turmoil is not expected 

to have a negative impact on this sector. On the 

contrary, mortgage rates have fallen rather than 

increased since the beginning of the financial 

turmoil last year.  
While growth in Germany in recent years was to a 
large extent driven by net exports, it is set to 

become more balanced in 2008 and 2009. As 

world demand decelerates and the euro 

appreciates, the main demand component affected 

by the financial turmoil is undoubtedly exports. In 

addition, Germany's price competitiveness 

compared with its main trading partners is not 

likely to improve further due to stronger wage 

increases and an increas
e in unit labour costs 
beyond that in other euro area economies, in 

particular in 2009. Given the mainly steadily 

accelerating growth in domestic demand and, 

consequently, the relatively strong import growth, 

the growth contribution of net external demand 

will decline.  
Costs and prices Inflation in Germany has 
reached levels not seen 
for nearly 1½ decades dr
iven by rising food and 
energy prices. However,
 inflation in these 
components should peak in summer 2008. Due to 

favourable base effects, particularly for the food 

and energy prices but also for the VAT increase 

and the introduction of tuition fees in some 

Länder, headline inflation should start decelerating 

in the second half of this year, falling towards 2% 

in the last few months of 2008 and below this level 

in late spring 2009. While stronger wage increases 

are leading to rising unit labour costs, inflationary 

pressure from wages remains limited. 

Consequently, core inflation might also decelerate 
in 2009, after rising moderately in the coming 
months. 
Public finances In 2007, the general government budget was in 

balance for the first time in nearly two decades, 

with the exception of the 
year 2000 (when the one-
off revenues from the auction of the UMTS 

licences were realised).  
The revenue side benefited from the increase in the 
standard VAT rate and substantially stronger 

revenues from direct taxes, in particular those 

related to profits. At the same time, receipts from 

social contributions declined due to a reduction in 

the unemployment insurance contributions rate 

(from 6.5% to 4.2%), which was not matched by 

the increases in the pension contribution rate (from 

19.5% to 19.9%) and higher contributions to health 

care insurance.  
Despite exceptionally strong revenue growth, total 
general government spending grew by less than 

1%. With lively GDP growth, the expenditure-to-

GDP ratio fell by 1½ pp. Positive labour market 

developments led to a reduction in related 

expenditure, in particular on unemployment 

insurance (
Arbeitslosengeld I
).  
In 2008, the general government balance is 
projected to weaken and to 
give rise to a deficit of 
½% of GDP, a more marked reversal than 

expected last autumn.  
The short-run effects of the reform of company 
taxation are expected to l
ead to revenue losses of 
0.3% of GDP. Moreover, the expected strong wage 

increases should dampen
 company profits, and 
hence profit-related taxes. An additional burden to 

the budget will come from the reduction of the 

unemployment insurance contribution rate (from 

4.2% to 3.3%). As of mid-2008 the contribution 

rate to the long-term care system is scheduled to 

increase by 0.25 pp, which will serve to fund 

additional spending. 
The expected further dec
line in the unemployment 
rate should lead to a reduction in spending on 

unemployment insurance. However, the budget is 

likely to be burdened by the upward adjustment of 

retirement benefits, which exceeds that envisaged 

by the legislation in force after the 2004 pension 

reform, and increases in public sector wages. In 

particular, the new wage and working time

   64 agreement for employees at

level foresees an effec

2008. In addition, working time is to be raised to at 

least 39 hours per week. The still valid agreement 

at the Länder level (which
 claims the largest share 
of public employment) foresees wage rises of 3% 

in 2008. 
Moreover, financial market turbulence should 
weigh on revenues from profit-related taxes. So 

far, the extent of tax revenue losses due to the 

write-offs and revaluation of the bank portfolios 

could amount, according to some estimates, to 

about 0.2 % of GDP. However, the exact 

magnitude and timing of these effects is still 

unknown due to the uncertainty related to the 

evaluation of the underlying outstanding risks and 

their maturity structure. In addition, the budget is 

likely to be burdened by the bank rescue 

operations organised by the German government at 

the federal and Länder level. The extent of this 

effect will depend on the precise recording of 

government actions to be ruled upon by Eurostat at 

a later stage.  
In 2009, the general government balance is 
projected to improve slightly. Under the 

assumption of unchanged policies, social 

contribution rates will remain constant. Finally, the 
agreement on public sector wages foresees a 
further increase of 2.8% as well as a one-off 

payment of 225 euro in 2009.  
In addition, both the 2008 and 2009 budgets will 
be burdened by the retroactive tax reimbursements 

resulting from the ruling of the European Court of 

Justice on taxation of foreign dividend income. In 

2009, a temporary budget relief is expected from a 

one-time reduction in Germany's contributions to 

the EU budget based on the Council decision on 

the own resources for the EU budget 2007-2013.  
The government debt ratio is projected to fall over 
the forecast period, from 65% of GDP in 2007 to 

slightly more than 61.6% in 2009, supported by the 

relatively solid GDP growth in 2008 and 2009.

65 Activity in 2007 The deceleration of the Estonian economy in the 
second half of 2007 turned out to be steeper than 

previously expected with the rate of economic 

growth coming down to 7.1% for the year as a 

whole and just 5.0% yoy in the last quarter of the 

year, compared with 10.2
% in 2005 and 11.2% in 
2006. Confidence indicators started to decelerate 

abruptly in 2007, in many cases dipping below 

their historical averages ar
ound the turn of the year 
and corresponded to a pronounced slowdown in 

private consumption. Much of the moderation in 

domestic demand is related to slowing credit 

growth and the easing of the housing boom, as 

annual credit growth halved and real estate 

transactions decreased by a third; this was 

reflected in a decline in investment activity. 

International credit pressures notwithstanding, 

most of the moderation in credit growth seemed 

due to lower demand rather than restriction in its 

supply. Export and import growth slowed throughout the 
year, mostly related to developments in quasi-

transit trade and sub-contracting in electronics. 

Annual growth in exports moderated to 1.5% 

(8.3% in 2006), while annual growth in imports 

slowed to 2.8% (17.1%in 2006). An improvement 

in the trade balance, in line with slowing domestic 

demand, set in rather noti
ceably towards the end of 
the year, with the contribution of net exports 

turning positive in the final quarter. There has 

nevertheless been no improvement in the external 

account due to a record income deficit, where the 

bulk of recorded outflows were reinvested. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 The economy is expected to slow considerably 

more in 2008 and 2009 than earlier projected due 

to the deceleration of do
mestic demand, but with 
momentum starting to recover by the end of 2008, 

driven firstly by net exports and subsequently by 

domestic demand. Private consumption growth 

seems fragile, especially in light of exceptionally 

high price increases in ear
ly 2008, and is expected 
to remain subdued at below 3% in 2008 and 

recover to 4½% in 2009. Fixed investments, where 

growth rates are expected to decline noticeably and 

turn negative for construction, will at the same 

time be supported by government and other EU-

funding related investments, as well as by 

increases in equipment investment, motivated by 

high labour costs and favourable price dynamics. 

Domestic demand is expected to pick up in late-

2008 and 2009 on the back of strengthening 

consumer confidence, when
 the dampening effect 
of very high inflation on disposable income 

recedes and expectations of a new growth phase 

become more widely shared. Higher pension 

increases from April 2008 and family-supporting 

measures agreed in the 
2008 budget are expected 
to contribute to strengthening consumer 

confidence. The contribution of net exports is 

expected to remain positive in 2008, turning 

neutral in 2009. 
The strength of the projected recovery will depend 
on the ability of the economy to cope with price 

pressures, as well as on its degree of flexibility to 

re-orient output towards niches where demand is 

strong. The export sector is still competitive in the 

higher value-added segments, where there are 

signs of increasing production and exports. 

However, there are also signs of deteriorating 

competitiveness in more labour intensive sectors. 

The trade balance is set to improve in line with 

lower domestic demand, which will help to narrow 

the external account defic
it to below 10% of GDP. 
Net external liabilities relative to GDP, around 

three-quarters at end-2007, will remain broadly 

stable, though with the exte
rnal debt ratio expected 
to overtake that of equ
ity during the forecast 
period. Net primary income 
debits are expected to 
stay high due to increasing debt interest and FDI-

related earnings.

  66 Labour market, costs and prices Labour supply remains tight, in particular for 
skilled workers. However, some decrease in 

employment and an increase in the number of   

unemployed is expected in 2008 as the economy 

cools. Wage growth is expected to remain far 

above that of productivity 
over the forecast period, 
with the gap narrowing only gradually.  
HICP inflation started picking up at the peak of the 
economic cycle, reflecting strong domestic 

demand growth and rising wage costs, and rose 

further in late 2007 mainly driven by global price 

developments. Excise tax increases at the 

beginning of 2008 brought inflation to double-digit 

levels for the first time since 1998. While price 

pressures are expected to moderate gradually with 

the cooling of the economy, HICP inflation will 

remain strong over the wh
ole forecast period at 
9½% in 2008 and above 5% in 2009. 
Public finances The general government budget position for 2007 

turned out to be strong with a surplus of 2.8% of 

GDP, even though headline surplus numbers were 

revised downwards in the spring fiscal notification 

due to the reclassifying of some companies and 

foundations inside the government sector, with a 
negative effect on the government balance of 0.4% 
points of GDP (
2). However, public finance 
prospects have worsened due to decelerating 

domestic demand, reflected in a sluggish tax 

collection in the first months of 2008. While still 

expected to maintain a small surplus in 2008, 

public finances are likely to experience a deficit in 

2009 due to a combination of slowing tax 

collection reflecting lower and less tax-intensive 

growth, as well as increasing social expenditure 

and the impact of proposed changes to corporate 

income tax legislation.  
The general government debt ratio decreased 
further in 2007, even with the effect of 

reclassification, and will remain low over the 

forecast period.

t67 Activity in 2007 Preliminary estimates showed GDP growth at 
5.3% in 2007, broadly in line with the earlier part 

of the decade.  However, this robust performance 

masked a significant deterioration over the course 

of the year, as annual growth slowed to 3.5% by 

the final quarter mainly due to a severe correction 

in the housing sector. House completions fell by 

one tenth from their 2006 peak.  Other classes of 

investment grew relatively robustly: machinery 

and equipment was buoyed by aircraft imports; 

strong growth in non-residential construction 

reflected planned public infrastructure provisions 

and buoyant private non-residential construction. 

Consequently, the overall volume of investment 

remained broadly at 2006 levels. Private 

consumption grew by 5.4 % annually, supported 

by continued strong growth in employment and 

incomes as well as the 
maturation of a one-off 
government-sponsored saving scheme. Public 

consumption grew by 6.7% reflecting a strongly 

expansionary stance. Domestic demand growth 

therefore remained rela
tively robust at 3½% 
annually. On the external side
, the performance of 
merchandise exports was the strongest for a 

number of years, thanks partly to a strong chemical 

sector performance and continued rapid growth in 

services exports. The latter grew by almost 15% 

especially trade-related, computer and business 

services. Overall export
s grew by 8.2% while 
imports remained strong growing at 6.4%, 

somewhat faster than final demand.   
Prospects for 2008 and 2009  GDP growth is expected to slow sharply to around 

2¼% in 2008 and, despite a pickup to 3¼% in 

2009, should remain well below potential over the 

forecast period.  However the overall growth 

picture is heavily influenced by the trajectory in 

the residential construction sector, with growth 

remaining relatively robust in the rest of the 

economy.  Therefore, despite private consumption 

growth of around 3% in 2008, domestic demand is 

projected to be broadly flat, largely reflecting an 

expected further large fall in house completions.  

While this correction in the housing market, in 

response to higher interest rates and rising prices, 

had been underway since later 2006, it has been 

compounded by the worsening international 

economic and financial environment. Although the 

full extent of the correction or its duration remains 

uncertain, with the prospect of relative stability in 

housing output in 2009, domestic demand growth 

is expected to return to 2¾% annually.   
In 2008, economic growth is projected to come 
mainly from net exports reflecting strong growth 

in services exports, as well slower imports as 

domestic demand weakens. In 2009, the 

contribution of net exports is expected to moderate 

but remain positive.  Thus, while considerably 

weaker than in the recent past, overall growth is 

expected to be more balanced between domestic 

and external components.  While this reflects 

cyclical factors and the ending of the housing 

boom in particular, it also reflects some 

improvement in underlying productivity.  
Labour market, costs and prices  Employment rose annually by 3.6% in 2007. The 

services sector, both public
 and private, accounted 
for most of this increase, whereas the construction 

sector had registered an annual fall in employment 

by the end of the year. Annual HICP inflation in 

2007 was 2.9%, which was significantly above 

euro area inflation mainly 
because of the services 
sector. CPI inflation was 
even higher at 4.9%, 
reflecting higher mortgage repayments. In 2008, 

employment growth is projected to slow to around 

¾% reflecting in particular a sharp contraction in 

construction employment and less dynamic 

services sector employmen
t growth. A smaller fall 
in construction employment during 2009 will

   68 allow for some recovery in total employment 
growth to around 1½%. Slower growth is also 

expected to have a negative impact on labour 

supply through reduced immigration and 

unchanged labour force participation, but 

unemployment is still expected to rise to 5½% in 

2008 and 5¾% in 2009. The rate of growth of 

compensation per employee is
 projected to slow to 
4¼% in 2008 and further to 3¾% in 2009. 

Productivity will be affected by countervailing 

influences. On the one hand, cyclical conditions 

suggest a weakening.  On 
the other, the structural 
move away from reliance on the highly labour-

intensive residential construction sector may offset 

this, on balance leaving economy-wide 

productivity growth broadly unchanged. While 

cyclical conditions might be expected to lead to a 

moderation of inflation by the end of the 

projection, recent adverse energy and food price 

developments are likely to delay the projected fall 

in HICP inflation from 3.3% in 2008 to 2.4% in 

2009. Importantly for price expectations, national 

CPI inflation is expected to fall faster in line with 

interest rate assumptions, as the impact of higher 

average mortgage repayments recedes - from 4.2% 

in 2008 to 2.2% in 2009.  With the assumed 

appreciation of the exchange rate, merchandise 

export prices are expected 
to continue falling over 
the projection period.  Similarly merchandise 
import prices are expected to fall in 2008, although 
the extent of this will be tempered by rising energy 

import prices, and overall import prices are 

expected to start increas
ing again in 2009.  The 
worsening merchandise terms of trade over the 

forecast period, offset to some extent by an 

improved terms of trade for the services balance, is 

expected to delay the cyclically related 

improvement in the balance of payments deficit 

from 5% in 2007 to 4.7% in 2009.  
Public finances In 2007, general government is estimated to have 

registered a surplus of 0.
3% of GDP, compared to 
an original Budget 2007 target of 1.2% reflecting 

higher than targeted spending and undershooting 

tax revenues linked with the slowdown in the 

housing market. For 2008, weaker nominal GDP 

growth and relative weakness in tax revenues at 

the beginning of the year suggest that the outturn 

could be somewhat worse than projected (1.4% of 

GDP against a targeted 0.9%).  For 2009, a 

projected slowdown in government spending may 

not been sufficient to offset continued weakness in 

tax revenues, leading to a further worsening of the 

nominal balance to 1.7% of GDP. Government 

debt is projected to increase from 25¼ % of GDP 

in 2007 to about 28¾% by end 2009.

69 Activity in 2007  Economic activity decelerated marginally to 4% in 
2007, from 4¼% in 2006, remaining robust and 

exclusively domestic-demand driven. This 

deceleration reflects the adjustment of private 

consumption to a more sustainable pace, the 

fading-out of last year's extraordinary dynamism in 

residential investment activity and the decline in 

government's public investment programme in the 

second half of the year. On the other hand, the 

improving business environment and increasing 

corporate profitability benefited investment, which 

rebounded strongly, compensating partly for the 

slowdown in residential construction. Public 

consumption accelerated 
significantly in 2007, 
clearly above the historical levels, after contracting 

marginally in 2006. The rebound was mainly 

driven by the implementation of relief measures 

for the areas hit by the August fires and the 

unforeseen cost of the organisation of the call for 

elections in September 2007.
 Overall, domestic 
demand contributed almost 5¼ percentage points 

to growth. On the external front, the declining but 

still dynamic performance of exports of goods and 

the rebound in the tourism and transportation 

sectors led to a significant reduction of the 

negative contribution of net exports to growth.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 Economic growth is projected to decelerate over 

the forecast horizon, with 
real GDP growing at just 
below 3½% in both 2008 and 2009. Economic 

activity is likely to remain exclusively driven by 

domestic demand and changes in the growth 

composition compared with
 the 2007 outcome are 
expected to be marginal, with private and public 
consumption growth easing to more sustainable 

levels. The effective tightening of credit conditions 

and the effects of higher food and oil prices on 

household disposable income are expected to 

outweigh positive developments in employment, 

real wage growth, cuts in
 income taxes and higher 
social benefits. This would lead to a marginal 

slowdown in private consumption growth, which 

should remain just above 3% per year.
 Public 
consumption growth is expected to move closer to 

3¼% after last year's temporary hike. Residential 

investment is likely to decline further, while 

corporate and public investment is foreseen to 

remain strong. Specifically, investment growth 

should continue to derive support from still 

negative real interest rates, the healthy financial 

and cash-flow position of enterprises, the strong 

corporate profitability of last year, EU structural 

funds inflows and the launch of public-private 

partnership investment projects.  
Overall, domestic demand is projected to 
contribute just below 4½ percentage points to GDP 

growth per year.
 On the external front, imports are 
projected to decelerate in
 step with domestic 
demand, while the growing differential with 

Greece™s main trade partners in terms of unit 

labour costs will further worsen competitiveness 

and, consequently, result in a relatively weak 

performance of exports of goods. Exports of 

services however, are foreseen to keep the 

momentum of the recent past, on the back of a 

dynamic transportation sector. As a result, the 

contribution of the net exports to GDP growth is 

projected to remain ne
gative. In view of 
developments in the external sector, the current 

account deficit is projected
 to remain high, above 
16% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, reflecting a further 

widening in the trade balance deficit.  
Labour market, costs and prices Consistent with buoyant growth, employment grew 

by 1¼% in 2007. However, the projected 

slowdown of economic activity should lead to 

slightly lower growth in job creation, at around 1% 

in both 2008 and 2009. The unemployment rate is 

expected to decrease acco
rdingly, by around ½ 
percentage point per year to just below 7½% in 

2009, maintaining the steady downward trend of 

the last few years. As regards prices, annual HICP

  70 inflation was contained at
 3% in 2007, compared 
to 3.3% in 2006. In 2008, however, it has already 

exceeded 4¼% in the first quarter, fed mainly by 

the ongoing acceleration in food and oil prices. 

Inflationary pressures are expected to remain 

strong throughout the year, on the back of 

uncertainties in the global energy markets, rising 

indirect taxes on oil 
sub-products and recent 
developments in labour costs. Specifically, wages 

per head in 2008 are set to grow faster than in 

2007 and continue to exceed productivity growth. 

This should somewhat accelerate the increase in 

unit labour costs, which would continue to rise by 

more than in the euro ar
ea's trading partners and 
thus, contribute to a further deterioration in the 

country™s competitive position, especially in the 

traded goods. 
Public finances The general government deficit outcome for 2007 

was 2.8% of GDP, including a net one-off(
3) deficit-increasing impact of some ¼ percentage 

points of GDP(
4). The December 2007 update of 
the Stability and Growth programme targets a 

deficit of 1.6% of GDP in 2008, in line with the 

2008 Budget Law. Deficit-reducing one-off 

measures of some 0.1% of GDP are included. 

Total revenues are budget
ed to rise by some 1 
percentage point of GDP, on the back of indirect 
and property tax increases. In contrast, total 

expenditures are projected to decrease by some ½ 

percentage point of GDP, mostly due to lower 

public consumption. On account of a slightly less 

favourable growth scenario and a more prudent 

assessment of measures on the revenue side, which 

takes account of past outcomes, the Commission 

services project a deficit of around 2% of GDP in 

2008. Measured by the cyclically-adjusted balance 

net of one-offs, the structural balance should 

improve by more than ½% of GDP. Based on the 

customary unchanged policy assumption, the 2009 

deficit is projected at around 2% of GDP. The 

general government debt ratio should decrease to 

about 90% of GDP by 2009. 
                                                          
 (3) This net one-off impact is the combination of deficit-
increasing one-offs of 1 percentage point (mainly related to 
the arrears paid to the EU
 budget following the GDP 
revision and the cost of summer
 forest fires) and deficit-
reducing measures of 0.8 of a percentage point of GDP 
(related to deferred payments by private banks to the 

pension funds). 
(4) Eurostat is in the process 
of clarifying, in close co-
operation with the Greek statistical authorities, some issues 

relating to the recording of EU grants in 2006 and 2007, 
the existence of a sizeable statistical discrepancy in 2007 
and the insufficient coverage of source data for extra-

budgetary funds, local government and social security 

funds achieved for the first estimate of the 2007 balance.

forecast
%71 Activity in 2007 Buoyant economic activity continued during 2007, 
when real GDP grew at 3.8%. However, this high 

growth rate for the year as a whole actually 

conceals a decelerating quarterly profile. Domestic 

demand started to show some signs of fatigue 

already during the se
cond quarter, which 
accentuated during the second half of the year. 

Private consumption and investment lost 

momentum due to both worsening consumer 

confidence and tighter credit conditions associated 

with the financial market turmoil. Only investment 

in equipment remained resilient and continued 

growing at two-digit levels. For the year as a 

whole, domestic demand contributed 4.6 

percentage points to GDP growth.  
Exports increased by 5.3%, slightly above the 5% 
recorded in 2006 and broadly in line with market 

growth. Due to the record
ed slowdown in private 
consumption, imports grew by 6.6%, compared 

with more than 8% in 2006. As a result, the 

negative growth contribution of net exports 

declined from 1.2 pp in 2006 to slightly below 0.7 

pp in 2007. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 In 2008, GDP growth is foreseen to slow down to 

2¼% on the back of cooling private consumption 

and contracting housing investment. The factors 

supporting strong and sustained investment in 

housing have faded away. Credit demand for 

housing began to ease already in 2006 and credit 

conditions tightened in 2007. Moreover,  

confidence deteriorated last year and the financial 
turmoil put additional pressure on credit markets. 
The number of housing approvals has been on a 

sharply declining path since the first half of 2007. 

This persistent fall in building permits provides 

evidence that the housing sector is immersed in a 

structural, as opposed to
 a cyclical, adjustment 
process towards a new equilibrium. This is in line 

with the projected creation of new households, 

which could reduce the size of the sector by about 

1/3 in real terms over the next three years. On this 

basis, investment in dwellings is projected to 

decline by around 5%. Nevertheless, total gross 

fixed capital formation should increase by a 

meagre 1½% (6% in 2007), thanks to still 

relatively strong infrastructure and equipment 

investment. 
In addition, private consumption is losing 
momentum in line with its economic 

fundamentals. Specifically, sluggish employment 

creation prospect
s would imply a deceleration of 
real disposable income. Moreover, the recourse to 

consumption credit could be more difficult than in 

the past due to high household indebtedness ratios 

in Spain and uncertainties in financial markets. 

The announced fiscal stimulus (see further details 

in the public finance section below) might provide 

some support to households' disposable income 

during the second half of 
the year and, as a result, 
private consumption could grow at 2¼%. The 

household saving rate is projected to reverse its 

previous declining trend. Overall, domestic 

demand is projected to contribute 2¾ percentage 

points to GDP growth in 2008.  
Export growth is foreseen
 to decrease in 2008 to 
around 4%. On top of the dollar depreciation, the 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  72 inflation differential of the country with the euro 
area is not expected to narrow over the forecasting 

horizon, weakening the competitiveness position 

of the Spanish economy further. Moreover, it is 

anticipated that global demand will worsen. 

Together with the slowdow
n in the pace of private 
consumption, imports should grow by 4½% in real 

terms, lowering the negative contribution from net 

exports to GDP growth, to below half a percentage 

point of GDP. 
GDP growth is projected to slow down further in 
2009 to around 1¾%. The ongoing contraction in 

housing investment, which is projected to decline 

by around 15%, is likely to weigh on job creation, 

thus further deceleratin
g private consumption. 
Unlike in 2008, the projected increase in 

infrastructure should fail to offset the fall in 

housing investment and, consequently, gross fixed 

capital formation might contr
act by 1½%.  Overall, 
domestic demand should contribute 1½ percentage 

points to GDP growth. It is envisaged that the 

contribution of net exports will become slightly 

positive, especially on the back of lower import 

growth reflecting slowing domestic demand. 

Exports are projected to accelerate slightly, 

allowing the country to broadly keep its market 

shares.  
The trade deficit is forecast to further increase to 
around 9% of GDP. This partially reflects the 

deterioration in the terms of trade by 1¼% and ½% 

in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Additionally, the 

balance of primary incomes should worsen 

because of a higher debt 
burden vis-à-vis foreign 
lenders. Higher payments to foreign investors 

should also bring about a widening of the gap 

between domestic and national disposable income. 

All in all, the current account deficit is expected to 

stay in two-digit territory throughout the 

forecasting period. There are risks to this scenario. On the one hand, 
sustained population growth might result in a 

better-than-expected outcome for economic 

activity. Specifically, in spite of the deterioration 

of economic activity, population growth might 

remain significant in the short-term, thus helping 

to sustain private consumption and to soften the 

adjustment of investment in dwellings. On the 

other hand, a sharper-than-expected adjustment of 

the housing sector and further tightening in 

financial markets could weigh on economic 

activity more than projected in the baseline 

scenario above.  In a co
ntext of tighter credit 
conditions, the adjustment in the housing sector 
would take place more rapidly than expected, 

further slowing down the pace of employment and 

private consumption growth.  Spanish households, 

highly indebted at almo
st exclusively variable 
interest rates, are significantly exposed to possible 

hikes in the cost of credit. Furthermore, within a 

context of credit restraint, the financing of the fast 

rising external debt of the country might further 

weigh on domestic activity.  
Labour market, costs and prices  In line with economic activity, job creation is 

projected to decelerate strongly in 2008 and 2009.  

Employment (full time equivalent) is expected to 

grow by about 1¼ % and ¾% respectively, mainly 

in the service sector. This 
compares with a rate of 
job creation of 3% in 2007. With still relatively 

strong migrant inflows, labour force growth could 

outpace job creation, thus
 raising the number of 
the unemployed. As a result, the unemployment 

rate should increase by around one percentage 

point per year, to above 10% in 2009.  
On the back of higher oil and food prices, inflation 
is expected to remain at around 4% until the end of 

the current year, when price pressures should ease 

to 2¾%. The average annual inflation rate could 

stand just above 3¾% in 2008, one percentage 

point higher than last year. In the same vein, the 

inflation differential with the euro area would 

remain at around one percentage point, comparable 

to the average recorded ov
er the last decade. In 
2009, a decelerating internal demand might 

alleviate price pressures, 
leading to a substantial 
decline of headline infla
tion to 2½%, on average 
for the whole year. The in
flation differential with 
the euro area is projected
 to narrow to slightly 
below ¾ of a percentage point.  
Compensation of employees is expected to closely 
follow, and even surpass, inflation developments. 

In 2008, labour co
sts increase per head could reach 
4¼% before easing to 3¼% in 2009. This leads to 

an increase of real un
it labour costs, which 
contrasts with its declining path in the recent past. 

Productivity growth for the economy as a whole 

should remain sluggish 
over the forecast horizon, 
at around 1% per year. Unit labour costs might 

grow by 3½% in 2008 and just below 2¼% in 

2009.  Accordingly, the competitiveness of the 

Spanish economy vis-à-vis the rest of the euro area 

would deteriorate further.

   73 Public finances For 2007, the general government surplus is 
estimated at 2¼% of GDP. This is a better 

budgetary outcome than in 2006, and well above 

the target in the 2007 B
udget Law (0.7% of GDP), 
mainly explained by higher-than-expected 

revenues. Specifically, corporate taxes associated 

with unusual profits have been growing at record 

levels. 
For 2008, the Budget Law targets a surplus of 
1¼% of GDP, fully in line with the updated 2007 

Stability Programme. Although the Budget Law 

seems to be based on an
 optimistic macroeconomic 
scenario (it projects GDP growth of 3.3%), 

favourable projections for tax revenues might be 

largely offset by the better base effect of 2007. 

However, the recently a
nnounced fiscal package, 
with an estimated cost of •6 billion (0.6% of 

GDP), implies a downward revision of the public 

surplus in 2008, which might bottom out at around 

½% of GDP. Specifically
, the measure with the 
highest budgetary impact co
nsists of a tax credit of 
•400 granted to each tax 
payer (employees, self-
employees and pensioners) during the second half 

of the current year by lowering tax withholdings 

and, as result, revenues 
might increase by a modest 
3¼%. On top of the fis
cal package, should the 
downward risks to the macroeconomic outlook 
presented above materialis
e, the projected surplus 
might eventually vanish.  
Total expenditures are expected to grow by about 
7¼%, well above nominal GDP growth below 5%. 

Regarding central government expenditure, the 

2008 Draft Budget Law gives priority for the 

fourth consecutive year 
to R&D, which should 
grow in nominal terms by around 17%. As a result, 

public R&D would represent 0.7% of GDP.  
In 2009, based on the customary no-policy-change 
scenario, the general government surplus could 

narrow to a close-to-balance position. Revenues 

are projected to grow at around 4%, close to 

nominal GDP, reflecting mainly low indirect and 

corporate taxes on the back of declining tax 

collection associated with
 a scenario of less 
buoyant housing market and corporate profits. 

Total expenditures are assumed to grow by 5½%, 

above nominal GDP, mainly explained by the 

functioning of automatic stabilisers, especially 

higher unemployment benefits.  
Although the primary surplus should decline from 
3¾% in 2007 to 1½% in 2009, the debt-to-GDP 

ratio is projected to continue on a decreasing path, 

from 36¼% in 2007 to around 35¼% in 2009.

t74 Activity in 2007  In 2007, the economy grew by 1.9% in real terms 
after 2% in 2006, close to potential. Domestic 

demand remained resilient, while the contribution 

from net exports was again significantly negative 

(-0.4 pp after -0.5 in 2006).  
GDP growth was therefore still exclusively driven 
by domestic demand, in particular private 

consumption. Robust employment creation 

buttressed the strong increase in household 

disposable income. In the wake of surging 

inflation, household consumption slowed in the 

fourth quarter (which was also affected by ten days 

of strikes against the Government™s plans to 

reform special pension regimes), while business 

investment remained dynamic. Despite buoyant 

government investment spurred by the local 

electoral cycle, invest
ment in construction 
decelerated relative to th
e previous year as the 
housing market continued to cool. Export growth 

held up during most of the year but contracted in 

the last quarter in the wake of the deteriorating 

global environment. Imports, which had developed 

in line with the robustness of final demand, fell 

sharply in the last quarter, partly on account of the 

marked decrease in household consumption of 

durable goods.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009  In a macroeconomic context characterised by 

growing uncertainties, still high inflation and some 

tightening of financial conditions, real GDP 

growth is forecast to decelerate in 2008. In 2009, 

economic activity is projected
 to remain lacklustre, 
with GDP growth picking up only very moderately 
in the second half of the year in a context of 

gradually abating inflation pressures and slowly 

improving prospects in so
me of France™s largest 
trading partners. Growth is expected to continue to 

be largely driven by domestic demand. Net exports 

should again provide a negative contribution, 

albeit less than in previous years. 
Private consumption, though slowing, would 
remain the main driving force of economic growth. 

In 2008, household real disposable income would 

be dampened considerably, on the back of a 

slowing labour market and higher inflation. 

However, as in the past, households are likely to 

react with a lag to change
s in disposable income 
and to smooth consumption, reducing their savings 

in 2008, which increased considerably in 2007. 

After a relatively strong first quarter of the year, 

household consumption would slow somewhat, 

though a minor positive impact from the 

unfreezing of employees™ stake in companies
5 is 
assumed in the second half of the year. In 2009, 

cuts in the personal income tax introduced with the 

TEPA6 package, though slightly less effective than 
previously estimated (
inter alia
, as concerns 
taxation on overtime), are expected to support 

some recovery in household real disposable 

income, which would also benefit from lower 

inflationary pressures.   
Investment in machinery and equipment should 
remain comparatively resilient in the first half of 

the year, as indicated by recent business surveys 

and production data and the 
fact that the capacity 
utilisation rate is slightly above its long-term 

average. It is however expected to slow more 
Member States, France 
  75 markedly from the seco
nd half of the year 
onwards, due to deteriorating demand prospects 

and tightening credit conditions. Although 

evidence of a restriction of credit to enterprises is 

still limited, the forecast 
assumes that, given the 
fact that French firms have in recent years reduced 

financing from own resources, their investment 

decisions are somewhat 
vulnerable to banks™ 
intentions to enforce stricter risk assessment as a 

consequence of the financial turmoil. As for 

investment in construction, the phasing out of the 

impulse from the local electoral cycle and the 

slowdown in the housing market should all 

contribute to making it considerably less dynamic 

in 2008 and 2009. The forecast is based on the 

assumption of a soft landing for the French 

housing market. Prices, which have been declining 

since January 2006, appear to have stabilised in the 

fourth quarter of 2007. Housing demand has 

slowed in recent months, but looking ahead 

demographic factors as well as fiscal measures 

taken to support household housing investment 

may be expected to somewhat mitigate the 

slowdown in demand.   
On average, French expo
rt volumes are projected 
to slow down in 2008 due to weakening external 

demand, the deterioration in price competitiveness 

linked to the appreciation of the euro and still 

unfavourable cost competitiveness. The outlook in 

2009 is foreseen to remain relatively downbeat. In 

a context of slowing final demand, import growth 

is also expected to dimini
sh significantly compared 
to 2007 and remain subdued over the forecast 

period. 
Labour markets, costs and prices Despite modest GDP growth, employment 

continued to expand robustly in 2007 (+1.2% after 

+0.8% in 2006), largely due to the performance in 

construction and services. In 2008 and in 2009, 

employment growth is set 
to decelerate markedly 
in the wake of the economic slowdown. Following 

two years on a strong downward trajectory, the 

unemployment rate is projected to decrease 

marginally in 2008, and rise again in 2009. 
With a still high unemployment rate (around 1 pp 
above the euro-area aver
age) and the projected 
slowdown in employment growth, wage 

moderation is expected to continue over the 

forecast horizon. The risk of second-round effects 

on wages from the flare-up
 in prices cannot be 
excluded, but seems relatively limited. Unit labour 
costs should broadly stabilise in 2008 and slow 
down marginally in 2009, as productivity growth is 

expected to increase slightly. HICP inflation 

should be around 3% in 2008. Inflationary 

pressures are expected to 
gradually abate, in line 
with the assumptions on oil and commodity prices, 

the slowdown in economic activity and assuming 

some marginal effects from the 
Loi Châtel
 on retail 
prices. In this context, HICP inflation is projected 

around 2% in 2009. Core inflation is expected to 

slightly rise from the first quarter of 2008 and to 

start decelerating as of
 the beginning of 2009. 
Public finances The general government deficit, which had been 
reduced to 2.4% of GDP in 2006 thanks to higher-

than-expected revenues (including one-offs of 

0.3% of GDP), increased to 2.7% of GDP in 2007, 

slightly above the Commission's autumn 2007 

forecast of 2.6% of GDP. The structural balance 

(the cyclically-adjusted-balance net of one-offs) 

showed no improvement. 
On the revenue side, the overall tax burden is 
projected to have decreas
ed to 43.7% of GDP, 
from 44.0% in 2006, and total revenue from 50.3% 

of GDP to 49.9%. The 
income tax reduction 
enacted with the 2007 fi
nance law and cuts in 
social contributions for overtime, which entered 

into force on 1 October, were partly 

counterbalanced by the 
effects of the robust 
employment performance and strong corporate tax 

proceeds. On the expenditure side, the state 

expenditure rule (a reduction of state expenditures 

by 1% in volume) was not achieved
7. Slippages 
were recorded in social security and particularly in 

healthcare, where once agai
n the objective was not 
met. Local expenditure growth was very dynamic, 

especially in investment, 
in line with the electoral 
cycle. All in all, the expenditure-to-GDP ratio 

decreased very marginally 
compared to 2006, from 
52.7% to 52.6% of GDP. 
In 2008, the deficit is exp
ected to increase to 2.9% 
of GDP. This compares with a new official target 

of 2.5%, up from 2.3%. The difference with this 

target stems both from lower revenue, partly linked 

to the deterioration of the macroeconomic 

environment envisaged in the Commission's 

scenario, and from slightly higher expenditure, 

notably in social security. The forecast 

incorporates the measures in the TEPA package 

and those presented in th
e draft finance laws for 
the state and social security. The main measures,

   76 impacting chiefly on revenues, are: (a) the TEPA

8, with an overall negative impact of 0.3% 
of GDP in 2008, slightly below the cost assumed 

in the autumn, (b) an additional cut in the "

" (negative impact of 0.1% of 
GDP), and (c) a reform in dividends taxation, with 

a positive one-off effect of 0.1% of GDP in 2008, 

split between the state and social security. The 

forecast assumes that the new rule for state 

expenditures, a "zero volume" increase extended to 

include most transfers from
 the state to the local 
authorities, is observed. Local authorities' 

investment growth should slow down significantly 

in view of the March 2008 local elections, in line 

with the electoral cycle an
d also as a result of the 
new state rule. Healthcare expenditure projections 

are based on a prudent assessment of corrective 

measures announced in the social security bill. 
Overall, the revenue-to-G
DP ratio would decrease 
by 0.3 pp and the expenditure-to-GDP ratio by 0.1 

pp. In structural terms (n
et of one-off measures 
projected at 0.1% of 
GDP), the 2008 deficit 
deteriorates by 0.1 pp.  
The deficit forecast for 
2009 is 3%, under the 
conventional assumption of unchanged policies. 

The revenue-to-GDP ratio would marginally 

decrease, reflecting the further deterioration of the 
economic situation as well the small residual 
additional impact in 2009 of the TEPA package. 

This would go alongside a minimal increase in the 

expenditure-to-GDP ratio, notably due to the 

indexation of most social transfers to the evolution 

of prices in the previous year, while 
inter alia
 compensation of employees and interest 

expenditure would be less dynamic than in 2008. 
After 64.2% in 2007, the debt ratio is expected to 
further slightly rise in 2008, and increase more 

significantly in 2009, just above 65%, based also 

on the allocation to debt reduction of privatisation 

proceeds, which for 2008 and 2009 are assumed to 

be at a level equivalent to those achieved in 2007.

77 Activity in 2007  Annual real GDP growth in 2007 is reported at 
1.5%. While quarterly data consistent with the 

revised accounts are not ye
t available, the large 
contraction of industrial production in the fourth 

quarter suggests that eco
nomic activity ended 2007 
on a negative note. 
On average throughout the year, the main driver of 
economic growth was domestic demand, 

particularly private consumption. This was 

supported by an increase in disposable income and 

fiscal incentives for the pu
rchase of durable goods. 
Net exports provided a slightly positive 

contribution, as mercha
ndise exports increased 
again at a sustained pace. 
On the supply side, the 
rate of growth in manufacturing value added 

slowed down from the value recorded in 2006, but 

still outperformed the low and even negative 

readings recorded in the 
first half of the decade. 
Value added growth in construction was similar to 

that recorded in 2006, 
but below the average for 
previous years. Services continued to record a 

healthier growth rate. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 The estimated contraction of economic activity in 

the fourth quarter of 2007 implies a negative 

growth impulse into 2008. In addition, available 

indicators suggest that economic activity will 

remain subdued in the first half of the year. But 

while the purchasing managers' index (PMI) for 

the services sector has fallen well below the 

critical threshold of stagnating activity, it has 

remained around that threshold in the 
manufacturing sector. Moreover, since part of the 
contraction in industrial production in Q4-2007 

could be due to exceptional factors Œ namely, 

strikes in the transportation sector in December Œ a 

slight recovery of economic growth is expected in 

the first quarter of 2008, followed by flat growth in 

the second. In the remaining two quarters, 

economic activity is expect
ed to increase, although 
at a slow pace.  
Overall, real GDP growth 
in 2008 is projected to 
be 0.5%, almost 1 pp. lower than in the autumn 

forecast and clearly be
low potential. The 
persistently negative grow
th gap with the average 
for the euro area will widen further despite the 

relatively modest exposure of the Italian banking 

system to the financial turmoil. The projected 

deceleration of growth stems from all demand 

components. Private co
nsumption will lose 
momentum under the impact of higher inflation 

and lower confidence, even
 though the increase in 
wages and employment will support nominal 

disposable income. The household saving rate 

should increase slightly, partly on the back of 

negative wealth effects. Investment in the private 

sector is expected to stagnate owing to decreasing 

capacity utilisation and tighter financing 

conditions, affecting both the corporate sector and 

households. By contrast, in the public sector, the 

increase in investment, including non-residential 

construction, should be su
stained. The deceleration 
in foreign demand and the appreciation of the real 

effective exchange rate w
ill affect export growth. 
As a result, the negative gap with growth in Italy's 

export markets will widen.  
In 2009, economic activity 
is expected to remain 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  78 subdued, under the influence of a still 
unfavourable external environment, but the growth 

momentum from 2008 should be slightly positive. 

Real GDP growth in 2009 is thus expected to stay 

below potential at 0.8%. Private consumption will 

regain some strength as pressures on prices ease. 

Gross fixed capital formation should remain weak 

under the lagged impact of the demand slowdown. 

Net exports are likely to provide a moderately 

negative contribution to real GDP growth, as 

import growth outpaces that of exports, in line 

with domestic demand and exchange rate 

developments. 
Labour market, costs and prices According to national account figures, in 2007 

employment in full-time equivalent terms (FTE) 

rose by 1% yoy, after 1.7% in 2006. As a result, 

labour productivity grow
th accelerated mildly 
from an almost flat outcome
 in 2006 and growth in 
unit labour costs slowed down. The unemployment 

rate decreased further, to 6.1% in 2007 from 6.8% 

in 2006. This decline was 
concentrated in the first 
three quarters of the year, when it was associated 

with a reduction in the number of active 

jobseekers, particularly in regions of the South.  
The significant slowdown in economic activity in 
2008 and 2009 is likely to be reflected in 

decelerating employment growth, which is 

expected to be 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, in 

full-time equivalent terms. The unemployment rate 

is nonetheless projected to continue falling to 6% 

in 2008 and to 5.9% in 2009, due to moderate 

labour supply growth.  
As the job content of growth is set to remain 
relatively high, labour productivity is forecast to 

increase by a mere 0.2% in 2008 and 2009, values 

that point to a persistent productivity challenge for 

the Italian economy. The wage agreements signed 

in late 2007 and those scheduled for 2008 in many 

sectors of the economy, both private and public, 

are likely to bring about an appreciable 

acceleration in compensation per employee. In the 

public sector, the expected sizeable increase results 

from the delayed implementation of the agreement 

on contract renewal at local level for the period 

2006-2007. Combined with slower labour 

productivity growth, this will fuel unit labour 

costs, also when measured in real terms. It will 

have a negative impact on the competitive position 

of the Italian economy, bot
h within the euro area 
and vis-à-vis the rest of the world. In 2009, labour 
cost growth should ease; in real terms it will be 
broadly in line with productivity growth.   
Annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in 2007, down 
from 2.2% in the previous two years. The surge in 

oil and food prices boos
ted year-on-year headline 
inflation in the latter part of the year. On the 

assumption of stable oil and commodity prices 

over the forecast horizon, inflation should 

progressively ease from 3.3% in the first two 

quarters of 2008 to reach 2.5% towards the end of 

the year, due to a smaller base effect. Overall, 

HICP inflation is expected to average 3.0% in 

2008. In 2009, HICP inflation might ease further to 

2.2%. After improving in 2007, Italy's terms of 

trade are projected to dete
riorate in 2008, due to 
the increase in the prices of energy products, 

which is only partly offset by the appreciation of 

the euro. In contrast, an 
improvement in the terms 
of trade is foreseen for 2009.  
Public finances In 2007, the deficit decr
eased to 1.9% of GDP, 
down from 3.4% of GDP in 2006 and below the 

3% of GDP threshold for the first time since 2002. 

The primary surplus rose to 3.1% of GDP, from 

1.3% in 2006. The correction was mainly revenue-

based. 
Overall, one-off and temporary measures increased 
the deficit by 0.2% of GDP. The structural 

balance, i.e. the cyclically adjusted deficit 

excluding one-offs, improved by about 1¼ 

percentage points of GDP relative to 2006. Over 

the 2006-2007 period, the correction of the 

structural deficit amounted to 3% of GDP. 
The official deficit projection for 2008 was revised 
upwards on 12 March, to 2.4% of GDP, from the 

2.2% of GDP deficit targeted in the 2007 update of 

the stability programme. Starting from the 

favourable base effect acquired with the better-

than-expected 2007 deficit outturn, this revision 

reflects lower real GDP 
growth (0.6% in the 
updated official forecast as compared with 1.5% in 

the update). It also inco
rporates some budgetary 
slippages, including some discretionary measures 

approved by Parliament in February 2008. 
Taking account of the budgetary measures that 
have been adopted by the time of the completion 

of the forecast, the Commission anticipates a rise 

in the general government deficit to 2.3% of GDP 

in 2008. The primary surplus should shrink by ½

   79 of a percentage point of GDP. Net of cyclical 
factors and excluding one-
off measures, both the 
deficit and the primary balance are projected to 

worsen by more than ¼ of a percentage point of 

GDP. This deterioration is due to additional 

spending and tax cuts. 
In particular, both the Commission and the official 
forecast incorporate the po
stponement to 2008 of 
the deficit-increasing imp
act of some new social 
transfers, investments and cuts in the regional 

taxes on productive activities (IRAP), originally 

planned for 2007. In 
the Commission forecast, 
public investment is projected to rise substantially, 

but by less than in the official projections, on the 

assumption that some delays will continue to be 

experienced in the budgetary execution of 

investments. 
The positive developments recorded by the state 
cash borrowing requirement in the first three 

months of 2008 reflect still buoyant revenue, 

matched by continued control in expenditure 

execution. However, upbeat revenue developments 

are expected to peter out progressively under the 

lagged impact of the economic slowdown and the 

disappearance of some te
mporary factors. Some 
court rulings are pending, particularly concerning 

the non-deductibility of IRAP from the tax base of 
income taxes. Finally, the outcome of the 
substantial changes in corporate taxation 

introduced by the 2008 bu
dget is subject to 
considerable uncertainty. 
Based on the customary no-policy-change 
assumption, the general government deficit is 

forecast to rise slightly 
in 2009, to 2.4% of GDP. 
This marginal increase is driven by lower 

corporate income taxes,
 as a result of both 
discretionary measures and the negative economic 

cycle. The expenditure ratio will remain broadly 

stable, as the sharp increase in outlays on 

compensation of employees th
at is due to occur in 
2008 will not repeat. With a negative output gap 

that is projected to open up further, the structural 

balance should improve slightly from 2008 to 

2009. 
Government debt declined to 104% of GDP in 
2007, from 106.5% in 2006. The debt ratio is 

expected to further decline slightly to 103.2% in 

2008 and, assuming unchanged policies, to 

continue diminishing in 2009.

80 Activity in 2007 Economic activity accelerated in 2007, posting a 
real GDP growth rate of 4½% after attaining 4% in 

2006. Growth was underpinned by dynamic 

domestic demand while net exports continued to 

contribute negatively. In particular, private 

consumption accelerated due
 to historically low 
interest rates, sustained credit expansion and 

continued employment and wage gains. A personal 

income tax cut also supported disposable income. 

Furthermore, a reform reducing car tax, introduced 

in November 2006, also added extra dynamism to 

private consumption, by stimulating the demand 

for cars. In parallel, sustained buoyant private 

investment in construction, especially housing, 

supported investment growth. Overall, domestic 

demand is estimated to have contributed 5¼ pps. to 

GDP growth, which was partially offset by a 

negative contribution from net exports. Total 

exports grew by 4¼% in real terms, while total 

imports rose by almost 7%, in line with strong 

consumer demand and investment. Reflecting 

weak re-export activity, exports of goods fell for a 

second consecutive year. In contrast, export-

oriented services continued to benefit from the 

positive outlook in the main export markets, while 

revenue growth from tourism accelerated 

compared with the past two years.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 In 2008 and 2009, economic growth is
 projected to 
decelerate from the excep
tionally high rate of 
2007, yet to grow solidly at 3.7%, against an 

adverse external environment.  
Economic activity will be exclusively driven by 
domestic demand while the external sector will 

continue to weigh negatively on GDP growth. 

Disposable income, supported not only by 

sustained wage and employment growth but also 

by the second phase of
 the enacted personal 
income tax reform, will keep private consumption 

growing robustly, although at
 a slower pace than in 
2007 on account of tighter credit conditions. 

Construction investment though should decelerate 

throughout the forecast pe
riod, compared to the 
exceptionally high levels of the last years. 

Investment in equipment, the bulk of which takes 

in the construction sector, is projected to follow 

suit. The main reasons 
for the deceleration in construction are the softening of demand for 

dwellings by non-residents and some policy 

measures aiming at cooling the housing market, 

such as the Central Bank directive concerning the 

reduction of the value-to-loan ratio.  
Albeit decelerating, export
s of services should 
remain dynamic, also on the back of positive 

prospects for tourism. Exports of goods, which 

consist mainly of re-exports, are projected to post 

some positive growth after the adoption of 

measures to boost the sector, such as the 

agreement with a global 
shipping corporation to 
use Cyprus as a regional hub, as well as the 

deepening of the port so as
 to serve larger vessels. 
Imports, in real terms, are projected to moderate, 

following developments in private consumption 

and investment activity, while remaining buoyant. 

However, in nominal terms, imports are likely to 

accelerate in 2008 but decelerate the following 

year in line with oil prices. As a result, the terms of 

trade would deteriorate in 2008 but level out in 

2009. Consequently, the current account deficit 

would worsen to 8½% of GDP in 2008, and 

improve slightly the following year.  
Labour market, costs and prices Labour market conditions 
remained close to full 
employment in 2007, with an unemployment rate 

of 3.9% and employment growth at 3¼%. In line 

with buoyant economic activity, employment 

should continue growing at around 1½% per year 

also in 2009. High participation, particularly by 

foreign workers, should ensure that wage pressures 

remain contained despite the tight labour market 

conditions. However, a moderation in immigration

   81 inflows, coupled with solid employment growth, 
should sustain the fall in the unemployment rate. 

Since productivity growth is expected to rise by 

about 2¼% by 2009, unit labour costs will rise but 

at lower rates than in th
e recent past and in the 
euro area over the forecast period.  
Average HICP inflation was 2.2% in 2007. Due to 
the hike of commodity prices, especially oil and 

food prices, overall HICP 
inflation is expected to 
accelerate to 3¾% in 2008. 
In 2009, it is set to 
decline to 2½%, against a background of 

moderating oil prices and domestic demand.   
Public finances 2007 marked a turnaround in Cyprus public 

finances as the general government balance 

reached a surplus of 3¼% of GDP, almost 4 

percentage points better than the 1½% deficit 

target of the Budget. In
 structural terms, the 
balance improved by around 4¼% of GDP in 

2007. The turnaround in 2007 is attributed to an 

exceptional rise in revenues, due to especially high 

tax receipts resulting from strong profitability in 

the financial sector and booming real estate 

investment. Consequently, part of the increase in 

tax bases and in the associated revenues does not 

appear to be permanent. While the 2008 Budget 
Law targeted a deficit of ½% of GDP, the new 
official target is for a surplus of about 1%. No one-

off measures are planned. The worsening of the 

government balance compared with 2007 comes 

from lower tax revenues, as part of their increase 

last year is considered to be due to temporary 

composition effects. Expenditure is assumed to 

remain constant as a percentage of GDP. The 

Commission services project a higher surplus to 

account for a reduction of 
revenues of only 1½% 
of GDP, as in the Stability Programme. In 

structural terms, the fiscal worsening in 2008 is 

expected to be about 1½% of GDP, which would 

imply an expansionary fis
cal stance. However, the 
Government's consideration that the rise in 

revenues in 2007 is only partially permanent 

reflects a prudent budgetary approach. In 2009, on 
a no-policy-change basis, the surplus is projected 

to inch up, due to interest payment savings. The 

debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain on a 

decreasing path, reaching about 43% by 2009, 

driven by the planned reduction of deposits with 

the central bank.

% of potential GDP
82 Activity in 2007 In 2007, real GDP growth slowed to 10.3% from 
12.2% in 2006. From the expenditure side, the 

pattern of growth was still characterized by 

buoyant domestic demand driven by private 

consumption, although investment growth fell 

sharply late in the year. The government's March 

2007 anti-inflation plan has helped to end the 

boom in the residential real estate market, a key 

factor behind the domestic demand overheating. 

Prices of standard Riga apartments started to 

decrease in the middle of 
2007, but in spring 2008 
were still at a significantly higher level than two 

years ago. Further expectations on easing house 

prices have curbed residential demand for 

mortgage loans, while banks have become more 

cautious to lend in view of falling collateral values 

and a less favourable economic outlook. 

Nevertheless, the moderation of lending growth 

has remained gradual with the growth rate of 

industrial loans surpassing
 mortgage loans by the 
last quarter of the year. 
The quarterly figures show
 a marked deceleration 
of domestic demand in the last quarter of 2007 

with net exports contributing positively to growth, 

as imports decreased sharply; exports continued to 

perform well. 
On the production side, GDP growth in 2007 was 
still strongest in sectors satisfying domestic 

demand. The highest growth rate was registered in 

the financial sector followed by construction, retail 

and wholesale and real estate, renting and business 

activities. From the main exporting sectors 

transport, storage and communications performed 
best with some pick-up during the course of the 
year. Manufacturing output stagnated, partly due to 

the closure of the sugar industry in Latvia. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 Currently there is unusually large uncertainty 

around short-term economic prospects due to the 

temporary fading of earlier main growth drivers 

and doubts as to the ability of domestic industry to 

increase exports and thus to help achieve a more 

balanced growth path. GDP data for the last 

quarter of 2007 and indicators for the first months 

of 2008 point to a sharper slowdown than assumed 

in the autumn forecast.  
In 2008, the growth of private consumption is 
expected to be dragged down by decreasing 

consumer confidence, negative wealth effects, 

lower real wage growth, deteriorating labour 

market conditions and increasing debt service 

obligations. 2009 is forecast to see a slow recovery 

of private consumption in quarter-on-quarter 

growth terms, due to the expected decrease in 

inflation and subsequent improvement in consumer 

confidence. A slowing in credit expansion and in 

real estate related economic activities is expected 

to continue throughout 2008 and in the first part of 

2009. In 2009, however, some recovery in 

residential investment can
 be expected. Public 
investment projects will continue at a significant 

level which will provide a cushion against a too-

sharp adjustment. Net exports are expected to have 

a positive growth contribution in 2008 and 2009, 

as the weakening of domestic demand should 

depress imports. On the other hand, export growth 

is expected to remain h
ealthy, driven by wood 
products, transport services and capital-intensive 

segments of manufacturing, where the rapid wage 

increases of previous years had a lower impact 

than in low-tech, lab
our-intensive segments. 
However, the loss in cost competitiveness in the 

latter clouds somewhat the short-term export 

prospects, weighing on overall industrial output 

development despite the successful ongoing 

restructuring of manufacturing towards more 

capital-intensive segments. The contemporaneous 

growth downturn in Latvia's Baltic markets is also 

unfavourable for exports growth picking up over 

the forecast horizon.

  83 The ratio to GDP of net external liabilities is 
expected to continue to increase in 2008 and 2009, 

as the external imbalance is poised to stay high 

with its financing remaining one of the key risk 

factors to this forecast, es
pecially in view of the 
concomitant global financial turmoil. 
Labour market, costs and prices  With the culmination of overheating on the labour 

market in 2007, employment grew by 3.5%, 

unemployment decreased to below 6% and whole 

economy nominal unit labour cost increased by 

around 25% (and in manufacturing by 30%), 

though an unidentifiable part of this increase is due 

to legalization of wages. With the peak of the cycle 

passed, a gradual reversal of the labour market 

trends can be expected in 2008 and 2009 with the 

construction sector leading the way followed by 

other domestic demand oriented sectors. However, 

public sector wages are set to continue to increase 

rapidly in 2008, exerting a potentially significant 

negative impact on private sector wage flexibility. 

Inflation is hitting record highs in a decade, as 

food and regulated price 
increases coincide with 
the impact of the domestic cost shock from higher 

wages and still high inflationary expectations. 

Inflation is expected to
 decrease to single-digit 
levels only in 2009. 
Public finances  The fiscal outturn for 2007 is reported to be around 

balance, weaker than ex
pected in the autumn 
forecast. With domestic demand easing, the growth 

rate of tax revenues is expected to slow 

significantly over the forecast period. High 

inflation will compensate to some extent the 

impact of lower real growth, but this effect is 

expected to fade in 2009. On the other hand, 

higher inflation puts pressure on the expenditure 

side, especially on pensions and public sector 

wages. Under a no policy change assumption, a 

deficit of around 1% of GDP can be expected for 

2008 and of around 2% of GDP for 2009. The 

deterioration is mainly explained by the projected 

decrease in the revenue to GDP ratio, due to lower 

growth in 2009. However, risks are skewed 

towards higher deficits, given the possibility of 

economic stimulation measures being taken.

84 Activity in 2007 Real GDP growth in 2007 reached 8¾%; however, 
data for the last quarter of 2007 already show signs 

of slowdown. 
Domestic demand was the main driver of growth, 
but was losing momentum with both consumption 

and investment increasing at
 a slower pace and net 
exports turning positive in the second half of 2007. 

Investment grew by nearly 16% over the year but 

weakened in the second half as previously 

booming construction and real estate sectors 

started to cool, partly in response to tightening 

credit conditions. Nevertheless, credit to 

households continued to grow rapidly and growth 

of consumer spending remained strong (11%). 

Household disposable income was buoyed by the 6 

pp cut in the personal income tax rate in July 2006, 

as well as by high wage growth and rising 

employment. The trade balance stabilised after the 

rapid widening of the deficit in the first half of the 

year when it was affected by capacity restrictions 

in oil refining. The external deficit widened to over 

12% of GDP from slightly below 9% in 2006.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 Real GDP growth is project
ed to weaken to around 
6% in 2008 and even more considerably in 2009 to 

3¾%, led by a slowdown in domestic demand. 

This reflects both tighter lending standards as 

regards credit supply and reduced confidence on 

the demand for credit which should moderate 

private investment and consumption growth 

substantially. 
Investment growth is thus likely to decelerate 
significantly in 2008-2009. Even though the 

profitability of companies reached record levels in 

2007, residential construction is expected to drop 

as a consequence of a housing market correction; 

some relief should come from continuing 

infrastructure projects and non-residential business 

investment. Supply-side constraints as a 

consequence of the tight labour market will 

continue to hinder growth in some sectors.  
Private consumption growth
 is forecast to weaken, 
but to remain relatively high, buoyed by 

continuing still substantial real wage growth 

(including from increases
 in minimum and public 
sector wages), a further 3 pp. cut in personal 

income tax rate in January 2008, and higher social 

transfers.  
Export growth should pick up in 2008 and remain 
robust in 2009. Export developments are expected 

to remain favourable, although price pressures are 

increasing and growth in ma
in trading partners is 
expected to weaken. Deteriorating export 

opportunities in EU countries will be offset by 

continuing demand from neighbouring CIS 

countries. Import growth
 is forecast to slow 
somewhat in line with slowing demand. The 

external deficit is expect
ed to improve but remain 
substantial; while the negative income balance 

should stay high, the merchandise trade deficit is 

likely to improve and increasing current and 

capital transfers from the EU and expatriate 

remittances should exert a moderating influence. 

Consequently, net external liabilities relative to 

GDP are expected to continue to increase 

significantly during the forecast period. 
Labour market, costs and prices The labour market is expected to remain tight with 

the rate of unemployment staying just above 4% 

and a limited growth in the labour force; net 

migration is still negative. However, a slight 

easing is expected due to higher immigration 

including returning emigrants. Employment is 

forecast to grow slightly 
in 2008 before stagnating 
in 2009. Labour shortages, especially as regards 

skilled labour, have put upward pressure on labour 

costs. Wage growth should thus show some inertia 

in 2008 but decline in 2009. Unemployment is 

expected to increase some
what in 2008 and 2009.

  85 Against this background, unit labour costs will still 
rise at a relatively fast rate, exerting pressure on 

competitiveness, especially in labour-intensive 

sectors. 
Annual average HICP infla
tion rose from 3.8% in 
2006 to 5.8% in 2007 fuelled by overheating and 

higher energy and food prices following global 

trends; however, core inflation also rose. At the 

beginning of 2008 Lithuania's sole natural gas 

supplier increased its contract price by 80% yoy, 

the price reaching West European price levels. Gas 

prices for consumers incr
eased by around 65% at 
the beginning of 2008 and regulated prices for 

heating are likely to go up by around 30% in 

autumn 2008 with possibl
e second-round effects to 
be registered. An increase of excise duties on fuel, 

alcohol and tobacco at th
e beginning of 2008 has 
also added to inflation. Transport prices are likely 

to accelerate. Overall in
 2008 annual average 
inflation is expected to 
exceed 10%. In 2009, given 
the substantial base effects in 2008, inflation is 

expected to ease slightly but to stay at a high level. 

Additional upside risks relate to possibly higher 

electricity and heating prices for households in 

2009.   
Public finances In 2007, the general government deficit widened to 

around 1.2% of GDP (2006, 0.5%), higher than the 

government target of 0.9% of GDP. Weaker than 

planned collection of personal and corporate 

income tax was partly offset by higher VAT tax 

collection and higher excise tax revenues. The 

deficit is forecast to widen further in 2008, mainly 

due to ongoing pension reforms and direct tax 

reductions (including a cut in personal income tax 

from 27% to 24% and the abolition of a temporary 

tax of 3% of corporate profits), but also higher 

spending for social transf
ers and a rise in public 
sector salaries, only partly offset by the increased 

excise duties noted above. There are risks that 

additional expenditures will be planned in the run-

up to the parliamentary elections in October 2008. 

A recent decision to increase teachers' wages adds 

to planned expenditures in 2008 and 2009. In 2009 

the deficit is expected to narrow only slightly as 

domestic growth weakens and expenditure growth 

remains high. The general government debt-to-

GDP ratio is forecast to re
main broadly stable at 
around 17%.

t86 Activity in 2007 GDP growth had culminated at 6.1% in real terms 
in 2006, the highest growth rate since 1999-2000. 

It remained dynamic in 2007, reaching about 5% 

according to a preliminary estimate based on the 

first three quarters. As expected, domestic demand 

replaced external trade as the main engine of 

growth: the contribution of net exports to GDP 

growth, which had amounted to 5.6 percentage 

points in 2006, is likely to have declined to about 

1% but that of domestic demand is expected to 

have risen to nearly 4%. Private consumption, 

boosted by strong job creation and rather fast 

rising wages, accelerated to about 3% after a rather 

subdued 2.0% in 2006 (despite the strong rise in 

employment and wages as well as the relatively 

moderate inflation in that year). Investment, both 

private and public, was very strong, rising by about 

10% in real terms due probably to strong GDP 

growth and compensating to some extent for a 

rather modest 3% increase in 2006. By contrast, 

exports were weaker than in 2006 when they had 

expanded by around 10%: exports of goods were 

significantly and exports of services slightly less 

buoyant than in 2006 as th
e effects of the financial 
turmoil began to be felt in the second semester.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 Growth should continue to slow down from 2007 

to 2008, declining to around 3½%, while 

remaining broadly stable in 2009. Domestic 

demand is projected to remain relatively dynamic: 

in particular, despite the recent decline in 

consumer confidence (much less pronounced, 

however, than in most other EU countries), private 
consumption should be boosted by still robust 
employment growth and buoyant wages as well as 

the cuts in income tax foreseen in the 2008 budget. 

Investment is likely to be rather resilient, though 

decelerating significantly w
ith respect to 2007. By 
contrast, exports of services will be strongly 

affected by the financial turmoil (exports of 

financial services amounted to two-thirds of 

exports of services and to half of total exports in 

2006), while exports of goods will suffer from the 

slowdown in the trade partners. 
Labour market, costs and prices Employment was very dynamic in 2007, growing 

by about 4½% after 3.7% in 2006. Non-residents 

were the main beneficiaries of this strong job 

creation but residents' em
ployment accelerated too, 
rising by about 2% after 1.7% in 2006. As a result, 

unemployment began to decrease in September for 

the first time sin
ce autumn 2001 (
9). Employment 
is projected to decelerate 
slightly but to remain 
dynamic over the forecast period, repeating the 

pattern already observed during the 2001-2003 

slowdown, when, due to a considerable amount of 

labour hoarding, it followed developments in 

output with a significant lag. However, it will 

probably decelerate enough 
to bring the decline in 
unemployment to a quasi-standstill in 2009 

(employment has to rise by at least 3½% a year for 

residents' unemployment to decrease).   
Wages rose strongly in 2007 (by about 4% after 
4.5% in 2006), reflecting the fast employment 

growth and the relatively tight labour market. They 

should decelerate in 2008 and 2009 but not 

dramatically (their slowdown in 2008 will 

probably be overstated by the likely drastic 

reduction in profit-related bonuses in the financial 

sector) as the rise in employment is projected to 

remain rather robust and inflation to be quite 

strong both by historical and international 

standards. Labour productivity might well stagnate 

or even slightly decrease in 2008 and 2009 due to 

the fact that employment will probably react with a 

significant lag and only partially to the slowdown 

in output (during the previous slowdown, 

employment peaked in 2000 and 2001 but output 

had already considerably slowed down in 2001, so 

that GDP per person employed fell by 2.9% in that 

year). Consequently, unit labour costs should rise 

significantly, by about 3½% in 2008 and 2009.

  87 Inflation remained rather subdued in yearly 
average in 2007, w
ith both Eurostat's HICP (up by 
2.7%) and the national CPI (up by 2.3%) rising 

slightly less than in 2006. However, as a result of 

rising world food and en
ergy prices, it accelerated 
strongly in the fourth quarter of 2007, with the 

yearly increase in the HICP
 nearly doubling to 4% 
compared with the first 9 months of the year. As 

usual, the surge in the national CPI, which 

excludes consumption by non-residents (and 

especially their large purc
hases of car fuel, alcohol 
and tobacco products), wa
s more limited (3.2% in 
2007Q4). Inflation will

4¼% and the national CPI by 3.4%. In 2009, under 

the assumptions of a stabilisation in the world 

price of food and of a slig
ht decrease in oil prices, 
inflation should be significantly lower than in 

2008. 
Public finances According to recently re
leased revised public 
finance data, the general government surplus, 

which was estimated by the October 2007 stability 

programme to have risen from 0.7% of GDP in 

2006 to 1.0% in 2007, actually surged from 1.3% 

of GDP in 2006 to 3.1% in 2007. This much-

better-than-expected result seems to be essentially 
due to large revenue windfalls. The surplus is 
expected to decline to 2.4% of GDP in 2008, 

essentially because the rise in revenues is projected 

to be much slower than in 2007. This will be due 

for a part to the cuts in income tax foreseen in the 

2008 budget (the 
ex ante cost of which has been 
estimated at around 0.8% of GDP) but also, to 

some extent, to the eff
ects of the slowdown in 
growth. These effects, however, are likely to be 

felt only gradually, as 
corporate tax receipts generally reflect fluctuations in companies' profits 

with a significant lag. In 2009, at unchanged 

policy, the surplus should remain broadly stable 

due to the fact that, despite the delayed effects of 

the forecast slowdown in growth, the rise in 

revenues will be stronger than in 2008, when it 

was reduced by the tax cuts. The general 

government debt, which amounted to 6.8% of 

GDP in 2007, should remain very low, reaching 

some 7½% of GDP in 2009

Administration de l'Emploi. The Eurostat unemployment 
rate followed a slightly different pattern in recent years.

88 Activity in 2007 After coming to a halt in the second quarter of 
2007, economic activity continued to be extremely 

weak in the following quarters reflecting to a large 

extent the fiscal consolidation efforts of the 

government starting in mid-2006. Overall, GDP 

grew by 1.3% in 2007, down from 3.9% in 2006.  
By reducing their savings rate households were 
able to smooth consumption despite the significant 

fall in real disposable 
income; hence consumer 
expenditure declined only moderately in 2007. On 

the other hand, government consumption fell by 

6% due to significant expenditure cuts related to 

health-care services and public administration. 

Investment remained lacklustre, resulting in a mere 

1% annual increase of gross fixed capital 

formation. Investment across sectors differed 

substantially however, as in export-oriented 

industries a marked increase was recorded. Strong 

external demand boosted exports which increased 

by more than 14% in 2007; however, net export 

growth already started to slow down. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 Economic activity is projected to recover only 

slowly, reaching 1.9% in 2008, since growth 

remained subdued in the second half of 2007, 

commodity prices have increased substantially, the 

outlook for the EU economy has become dimmer, 

and credit conditions are tightening. Nevertheless, 

as the impact of the fiscal 
retrenchment is to fading 
out, domestic demand is anticipated to gather pace, 

pushing GDP growth to around potential in 2009. 
 The recovery is expected to take place with a 
growing contribution from domestic components, 

despite a gradually shrinking momentum from net 

exports. In particular, consumer expenditure is 

foreseen to accelerate moderately, in line with the 

households™ consumption smoothing behaviour. 

Government consumption is expected to continue 

to have a negative impact on growth in 2008, but a 

reversal in trend is envisaged in 2009. Even though 

profit margins were reduced by the consolidation 

measures (increasing the effective tax burden) and 

credit may become more difficult to acquire, 

private investment is foreseen to support the 

recovery as capacity utilisation levels are high. 

Moreover, the increase in th
e available EU funds is 
also anticipated to sup
port corporate investment. 
Export growth, on the other hand, is expected to 

slow down to around 10% annually, due to the 

unfavourable external environment. However, as a 

result of strengthening domestic demand, import 

growth is foreseen to approach to that of exports. 

Against this background,
 the current account 
deficit is projected to drop from 5% in 2007 to 

3.9% in 2009. 
Labour market, costs and prices In the second half of 2007, labour market 

conditions started to adjust to the economic 

slowdown. As a result private sector employment 

started to decrease and unemployment began to 

rise. This process is foreseen to continue in 2008; 

in 2009 however, as the economic recovery further 

accelerates, a slight increase in employment can be 

expected. Such labour market conditions allow for 

only a moderate increase in real private wages 

throughout the forecast pe
riod, whereas in the 
public sector wages are assumed to exceed 

inflation, but only in 2009.  
At the end of 2007, the substantial increase in 
energy and food prices
 worldwide temporarily 
reversed the disinflationary process in Hungary 

and led to an annual increase of 8%. The upward 

pressure was further increased by the impact of the 

liberalisation of the electri
city market in January 
2008. Based on the forecast assumptions on food 

and energy prices and in the absence of additional 

pressures from wages, CPI inflation is nevertheless 

expected to resume its downward path and reach 

6.3% in 2008 and 3.7% in 2009.

  89 Public finances As a result of the Government's fiscal 
consolidation programme (including revenue-

increasing measures as well as expenditure freezes 

and structural reform steps), the budget deficit 

significantly decreased to 5.5% of GDP in 2007, 

down from 9.2% in 2006. The fiscal improvement 

was almost evenly distributed between the revenue 

and the expenditure side (the latter was achieved 

despite sizeable one-off expenditures of 0.9% of 

GDP). In 2008, the deficit 
is expected to further 
decrease to 4% of GDP, due to the elimination of 

deficit increasing one-off operations and continued 

fiscal adjustment. Based on the usual no-policy-

change assumption (including as regards the tax 

code), the forecast projects a modest improvement 

in 2009 to 3.6% of GDP, thanks to a continued 

expenditure moderation in government 

consumption achieved by a series of structural 

reform measures to streamline the public sector. In 

structural terms the deficit 
is expected to fall from 
4¾% in 2007 to 3¼% of GDP in 2009. 
The decrease in the budget deficit in 2008 is partly 
explained by a more efficient collection of taxes 

and social contributions due to a series of measures 

addressing tax evasion, entailing a moderate 

increase in the tax burden by half a percentage 

point to 39.9% of GDP in 2008. On the 
expenditure side, the elimination of a number of 
investment and capital transactions (financed from 

domestic sources) as well as moderate increases in 

the public wage bill and price subsidies (totalling 

around 1¼% of GDP in 2008) are the main reasons 

behind the reduction in the expenditure ratio. 

However, for 2009, it is assumed that not all of the 

planned further savings in government 

consumption (especially price subsidies and the 

public wage bill) and in subsidies on products will 

be achieved, since it may be difficult to continue to 

contain spending. The fore
cast does not include 
any possible takeover from the debt of MÁV, the 

state-owned railway company (around 1% of 

GDP), nor any additional capital injections to 

MÁV. It also does not consider any consequence 

of the ongoing restructuring of MÁV on the 

sectoral classification of
 the company's successor 
units. 
After a moderate increase in 2007 to 66% of GDP 
(from 65.6% in 2006), the debt ratio is projected to 

continue to increase somewhat to 66.5% of GDP in 

2008, before declining to 65.7% of GDP in 2009.

90 Activity in 2007 Malta™s real GDP grew by 3.8% in 2007, 
accelerating from 3.4% in the previous year. 

Economic activity was mainly driven by domestic 

demand, most notably higher private consumption. 

Inventories, and to a lesser extent, net exports also 

contributed to GDP growth. Private consumption 

increased by 2.8%, recovering from a declining 

trend that began in 2003. Strong job creation, 

coupled with lower personal income taxes and 

favourable inflationary developments, supported 

real disposable income growth. Private 

consumption was also boosted by strong growth in 

consumer credit and cash de-hoarding in the run-

up to euro changeover. Public consumption 

increased by 0.6%, reflecting the expenditure-led 

fiscal consolidation. 
Growth in gross fixed capital formation slowed 
down to 0.3%, in the wake of lower public capital 

spending following the completion, by mid-year, 

of a major healthcare facility. The contribution of 

final domestic demand to GDP growth amounted 

to slightly more than 2 percentage points. In 

addition, net exports contributed around 0.8 

percentage points to growth. 
Despite an increase in nominal terms, real exports 
of goods and services contracted by 0.6%. Foreign 

sales of goods, which account for three-fifths of 

total exports, declined sharply, primarily as a result 

of a closure of two sizeable
 textile factories. The 
poor performance of merchandise exports was 

partly offset by significant growth in export of 

services, mainly explained by higher revenue from 

tourism. Imports contracted by 1.3% in 2007, 
weighed down by the slow
er pace of investment 
growth and the fall in exports of goods which, for 

Malta, are characterised by a relatively high import 

content. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 GDP is expected to slow down to 2.6% in 2008 

and 2.5% in 2009. Economic activity is projected 

to be mainly domestically-driven in both years. For 

2008, the boost to disposable income brought 

about by further tax cuts and higher transfer 

payments, is expected to be dampened by higher 

food and oil prices and a moderation in 

employment growth. Against this background, 

private consumption growth is anticipated to 

decelerate in 2008 and r
ecover slightly in 2009. 
Public consumption is proj
ected to increase at low 
rates during the forecast horizon. Investment is 

anticipated to post strong growth in 2008 and 

2009, by around 3.5% and 3% respectively, on the 

back of higher private 
capital spending linked, 
amongst others, to a major ICT project. Overall, 

final domestic demand is expected to contribute by 

2.5 percentage points to GDP growth during the 

forecast horizon.  
Exports of goods and services are anticipated to 
recover in 2008 and remain unchanged in 2009, as 

the losses in export market shares of traditional 

manufacturing sectors registered in previous years, 

make way for further growth in rapidly-expanding 

sectors such as pharma
ceuticals. Meanwhile, 
positive results for the first two months of 2008 

and favourable indications for the rest of the year Œ 

partly owing to the servicing of new routes by low-

cost airlines - point to further expansion in 

tourism, albeit at a slow
er pace. In line with an 
improved export performance and buoyant 

investment, imports are foreseen to increase by 

0.6% in 2008 and by 0.7% in 2009. Following a 

sharp decline to 5.5% of 
GDP in 2007, the current 
account deficit is projected 
to deteriorate to 5.9% 
of GDP in 2008, mainly due to a higher fuel 

import bill, and improve to 5.6% in 2009. As a 

result, net borrowing vis-à-vis the rest of the world 

is foreseen to reach around 4.8% of GDP by 2009.

   91 response to the recovery in tourism. Although 
moderating in 2008 and 
2009, the pace of job 
creation is expected to 
be above the historical 
average, driven mainly by information technology, 

tourism and remote gaming. The unemployment 

rate is foreseen to decline slightly from 6.4% in 

2007 to 6.2% in 2009. 
Although bottlenecks in certa
in sectors of the job 
market and the automatic wage indexation to past 

inflation would push wages up, new employees 

entering the labour market should partially ease the 

pressure. Compensation per employee is projected 

to grow by above 3% in nominal terms, in line 

with the euro area averag
e. Productivity gains are 
expected to remain moderate at around 1¼%, 

leading to faster growth in unit labour costs over 

the forecast horizon. However, the acceleration of 
unit labour costs is on average less marked than 

that of the euro area. 
In 2007, HICP inflation fell sharply to 0.7%, 
mainly on account of d
eclines in tourist 
accommodation prices as well as the authorities' 

decision to keep utility prices unchanged. Higher 

food and oil prices are 
expected to push up 
inflation to 3.4% in 2008. Thereafter, the rate of 

price increases will ease to 2.2%, brought about by 
the unwinding of the previous year™s build-up in 
food and energy prices.  
Public finances The general government deficit fell to 1.8% of 

GDP in 2007, primarily as a result of a decline in 

current expenditure-to-GD
P ratio. The structural 
balance (cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-

offs) improved by around ½ a percentage point of 

GDP in 2007. For 2008, the deficit is projected to 

decline further to 1.6% of GDP. The ratio of 

current expenditure to GDP is projected to 

continue to fall, mainly as a result of slower 

growth in compensation of employees in relation 

to nominal GDP, and lower interest expenditure.  
For 2009, under the no-policy-change scenario, the 
deficit is expected to decline further to 1% of 

GDP. The improvement in 
the fiscal stance will 
result mainly from a further decline in both the 

ratio of compensation of employees to GDP and 

government gross fixed capital formation. 
General government debt in 2007 stood at around 
62.5% of GDP and is anticipated to decline to 

60.6% of GDP in 2008. Under the no-policy-

change scenario, the debt ratio is foreseen to fall to 

below 59% of GDP in 2009.

92 Activity in 2007 Following growth of 3% in 2006, GDP continued 
to grow strongly in 2007, at 3.5%, the highest 

growth rate since the start of the century. The 

quarterly growth pattern was distorted by 

unusually high temperatures in the first half of 

2007 (reducing gas production) and a subsequent 

normalisation of gas production boosting growth in 

the second half of the year. Overall, GDP growth 

over the year 2007 was ro
ughly unaffected by gas 
production volatility and primarily driven by 

strong domestic demand, while also supported by 

the still favourable international environment. 
Despite on average lower consumption of energy 
products, private consumption increased by a 

healthy 2.1% in 2007. Consumer confidence fell in 

the second half of the year in response to the 

developing international financial turmoil, but 

private consumption expenditure remained 

unaffected as Dutch consumers did not experience 

any direct personal financial consequences. In fact, 

consumption growth of consumer durables 

remained strong in the second half of the year, 

although this was also supported by the relatively 

benign price developments of those products. 

Overall, private consumption expenditure growth 

slightly outpaced net disposable income. 
Private investment growth slowed in 2007 
following very buoyant growth in 2006. The 

slowdown was concentrated in transportation 

equipment. Investments in other categories 

remained strong in 2007,
 especially in the 
construction sector and residential dwellings. 
The contribution of net exports to GDP was 
relatively high in 2007 as export growth remained 

strong, driven by continued high international 

trade developments in the first three quarters of the 

year. At the same time, overall import growth 

slowed in response to reduced investment demand 

for transportation equipment, much of which is 

imported. Only at the end of 2007 did export 

growth start to weaken in response to the 

slowdown in international import demand. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 Economic growth prospects have turned 

significantly less favour
able recently, as the 
international economic slowdown is projected to 

be more pronounced than was expected a short 

while ago. The projected high annual growth 

figure of 2.6% is related to the exceptionally high 

carry-over from 2007, whic
h accounts for 1.9% of 
growth in 2008 and hides the substantial slowdown 

in growth dynamics. For 2009, the carry-over from 

2008 is only 0.6% and annual GDP growth is 

expected to come out at 1.8%. 
Throughout 2008, quarterly growth rates are 
expected to average 0.4% 
qoq, which is marginally 
below potential and significantly more modest than 

average quarterly growth rates in 2007 (of 1.1%). 

In the first quarter of 2008, a small negative effect 

is expected from lower gas production related to 

above-average temperatur
es, but in quarter-on-
quarter terms growth is expected to remain clearly 

positive. For 2009, quarterly rates are expected to 

be at potential, at around 0.5% throughout the 

year. Member States, The Netherlands 
  93 On the demand side, real private consumption 
expenditure growth is expected to slow 

significantly to around ¼% qoq throughout the 

forecast period(
10). This results in annual growth of 
2.2% in 2008 and around 1% in 2009. The main 

reasons for the slowdown Œ which is occurring 

despite favourable employment developments Œ 

are increasing social contributions in 2008 and 

upward price pressures from mid-2008 onwards 

that reduce purchasing power. As the economic 

outlook deteriorates, corpor
ations are expected to 
reduce private gross fixed capital formation. As a 

result, total investments in fixed capital will likely 

slow from 5.1% in 2007 to 3% and 1.3% in 2008 

and 2009, respectively. 
Due to its openness, the very open Dutch economy 
is expected to be affected disproportionately by the 

projected slowdown in international trade over the 

forecast horizon. This is in part the result of the 

high share of transit trade in total Dutch trade. 

Taking advantage of its geographical location, a 

significant (and growing) part of all the 

Netherlands' imports is re-exported to the 

European hinterland. As import growth in other 

European countries slows, this affects both import 

and export trade flows. Nevertheless, the external 

trade balance is expected to contribute positively 

to GDP growth over the forecast period, as import 

growth slows more rapidly than export growth, on 

account of decelerating private demand. 
The current account surplus 
is foreseen to increase 
over the forecast horizon, continuing a trend that 

started at the end of the last decade. The balance of 

trade in goods is set to 
increase from a surplus of 
7.3% of GDP in 2007 to roughly 8% in 2009 as 

export growth slightly outpaces import growth. 

Regarding 2009, the curr
ent account surplus also 
increases because of the reduction in the 

contribution to the EU own resources. 
Labour market, costs and prices In 2007, employment growth was 2.4% in full-

time equivalence terms. It is expected to slow to 

1.3% in 2008 and 0.7% in 2009, which is the result 

of opposing factors. On the one hand, existing 

tightness is expected to persist in large sections of 

the labour market, while on the other hand labour 

demand growth is expected to slow in response to 

the economic slowdown and the rising cost of 

labour. The unemployment rate is likely to 

continue its fall in 2008 to come out slightly below 

3% and stabilise in 2009 as net employment 
demand is expected to be in line with the increase 
in the labour force. 
Despite the apparent tightness of the labour 
market, labour unions have kept their wage 

demands relatively subdued to date. Over the 

forecast horizon, wage de
mands are expected to 
rise in response to both the still tight labour market 

and increasing inflation.
 It is expected that 
contractual wages will accelerate this and next 

year. In all, wages and salaries per full-time 

equivalent are expected to increase by 3.6% in 

2008 and almost 4% in 2009. 
HICP inflation has remained relatively low in 2007 
coming out at 1.6%, putting the Netherlands 

among the best performing countries in the EU. 

However, it is expected to increase rapidly in the 

course of 2008 and 2009
 to reach around 3% in 
2009(
11), clearly above the projected EU inflation 
forecast for that year. High
er projected inflation is 
in part related to the recent sharp increase in 

international food prices and the continued high 

energy prices. The effect of these developments on 

consumer price inflation is likely to be relatively 

drawn out as a result of the current fierce 

competition among food retailers and the relatively 

long lags in the transmission of energy prices to 

heating costs. Furtherm
ore, the anticipated 
increase in wages is expected to put upward 

pressure on inflation, especially in 2009. Finally, 

plans to introduce an aviation tax and a packaging 

tax and to increase levies on fuels and tobacco will 

put further upward pressure on inflation from mid-

2008 onwards.  
Public finances The headline budget balance did not benefit from 

the remarkably high economic growth in 2007 and 

came out at 0.4% of GDP, roughly identical to the 

outcome in 2006 of 0.5% of GDP. Total tax 

revenues exceeded budgeted amounts, but overall 

receipts from the sale of natural gas came out 

lower, which was related to lower-than-expected 

gas production in the first half of 2007. 

Furthermore, there were expenditure overruns, 

mainly concentrated in he
alth care. Overall, the 
structural balance fell by
 roughly ¾ percentage 
point of GDP in 2007. If the structural balance is 

corrected for the slowdown in gas revenues, the 

deterioration comes out around ½% of GDP. 
In 2008, the headline balance is expected to 
improve by 1 percentage point of GDP to 1.4% of

   94 GDP. Half of the budgetary improvement is related 
to the projected rise in non-tax gas revenues from 

1.4% of GDP in 2007 to around 2% of GDP in 

2008 in view of the continued high energy prices 

over the forecast horizon. Furthermore, budgetary 

consolidation is planned on the revenue side that 

involves raising a variety of taxes and social 

contribution rates. The measures include higher 

health care contributions, 
increased fuel levies, the 
introduction of a tax on aviation and on packaging 

from mid-2008 onwards and higher excise duties 

on tobacco and alcohol. These factors raise overall 

government revenues and outweigh the additional 

expenditure outlays that are planned in the fields of 

health care and education.
 The structural budgetary 
balance is expected to im
prove by around ¾% of 
GDP in 2008. Corrected 
for the increase in gas 
revenues, the improvement is only around ¼%. 
For 2009, the headline 
budgetary balance is 
expected to improve by roughly half a percent of 

GDP to 1.8% in 2009, whereby it is assumed that 

tax elasticities excluding policy measures return to 

levels somewhat below their historical values, as is 

common in a cyclical downturn. Although the 

forecast is based on a no-policy-change 

assumption, the projected 
outcome is affected by 
several tax measures that will be implemented in 

mid-2008 and that improve the budgetary outcome 
in 2009 by 0.1% of GDP. Furthermore, gas 
revenues are expected to increase slightly based on 

continued high energy prices. Finally, the balance 

in 2009 is affected by the reduction in the annual 

contribution of the Netherlands to the EU budget 

of slightly less than 0.2%
 per year according to the 
Council decision on the EU own resources. 

Cumulated for the years 2007 to 2009, this 

amounts to 0.5% of GDP, out of which 0.3% of 

GDP is a one-off. Corrected for this one-off and 

the increase in gas revenu
es, the balance in 2009 
would remain unchanged compared with 2008. 

Corrected for gas revenue 
increases, the structural 
balance is planned to remain roughly unchanged in 

2009, implying a broadly neutral fiscal stance. 
The government debt ratio is forecast to fall from 
47.9% in 2006 to 39% of GDP in 2009. The fall in 

the debt ratio can be mainly attributed to the 

growth of nominal GDP. 
                                                          
 (10) Private consumption expenditure is expected to be higher 
in the first quarter of 2008, only. This is related to a 
modification to the health care system that leads to a 

reclassification of public health consumption to private 
health consumption. 
(11) The government plans to raise the main VAT rate in 2009 
from 19 to 20%. In line w
ith the no-policy-change 
assumption, this has not been taken into account.

t95 Activity in 2007 The Austrian economy grew by 3.4% in 2007 with 
quarter-on-quarter growth slowing down gradually 

throughout the year, from 0.9% qoq in the first 

three months of the year to 0.6% in the last quarter.  
The main contribution to growth came from 
exports, which registered one of the highest growth 

rates in the last decad
e, benefitting from the 
favourable economic situation in Europe, 

particularly in Germany, and sustained gains in 

cost competitiveness.  
Gross fixed capital formation, which accelerated 
from an already strong p
ace of the previous year, 
provided the second largest contribution to growth. 

In particular, investment in equipment saw a 

significant rebound on the back of the high 

capacity utilisation. Investment in construction, by 

contrast, registered a gradual slowdown, which 

was due to an abrupt falloff in housing 

construction.  
Since both private and public consumption grew 
only moderately, they contributed to growth to a 

much lesser extent than net exports and 

investment.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 The still buoyant activity at the beginning of 2008 

is set to gradually slow down over the course of 

the year, only to start pi
cking up as from mid-2009 
on the back of an improving external environment. 

The output gap, which closed in 2006, is envisaged 

to remain positive but gradually diminish 
throughout the forecast period as growth is likely 
to be much lower than potential in 2009.  
Against the background 
of the expected high 
inflation, marginally rising saving rate of 

households and slightly worsening prospects for 

the labour market, the profile of private 

consumption is projected to stay relatively flat. 

Growth in public consumption is anticipated to 

slow down in 2009, to a large extent due to the 

phasing-out of payments for military equipment. 

Having peaked in 2007, growth in gross fixed 

capital formation is exp
ected to ease over the 
forecast period. Investment
 in equipment is likely 
to slow down sharply, due to deteriorating 

prospects for exports.  
Since Austria's exports to the US constitute only a 
small percentage of the total, the impact of the 

slowdown in the American economy will mostly 

be indirect. The projected
 deceleration of German 
exports (which have a high Austrian import share), 

is predicted nevertheless to take its toll on the 

Austrian economy. Therefor
e, the contribution of 
net exports to real GDP is set to decline somewhat. 

However, it is expected to remain positive 

throughout the forecast period and the current 
account balance will gradua
lly increase to just 
above 5% of GDP. 
Labour market, costs and prices Thanks to the continued strong activity, 

employment registered its fastest growth in 

decades and unemployment rate declined to 4.4% 

in 2007. However, on the back of moderating 

activity, employment growth is envisaged to 

decelerate throughout the forecast period. The 
unemployment rate, which has been on the decline 

since 2006, is anticipated to pick up marginally in 

2009, as job creation will not be sufficient to 

match the growing labour 
force due to increased 
inflows of immigrants, and rising participation rate 

of women and older workers. The latter now stay 

longer in the labour mark
et as a consequence of 
the recent pension reforms.  
Prices are set to grow much
 faster than previously 
expected, with Austria's 
HICP surpassing the 2% 
threshold by a wide margin in 2008, but returning 

to it the year after. Th
e increase in wages is 
projected to be slightly 
lower than the euro-area

   96 average, which combined 
with the strong growth 
of Austria's labour productivity in comparison to 

other euro-area countries will ensure maintaining 

of relative price competitiveness. 
 Public finances At 0.5% of GDP, the headline general government 
deficit for 2007 turned out much lower than the 

initial 0.9% of GPD officially expected. The 

favourable outturn was mainly due to higher-than-

expected receipts from wage and corporate taxes 

as well as capital yields taxes, which more than 

offset slightly higher-than-planned expenditure 

growth.  
The federal budget for 2008 was adopted (together 
with that for 2007) by the new parliament in May 

2007, giving priority to expenditure on R&D, 

education and social affairs.
 In addition, the budget 
will be burdened by the recently agreed 

exemptions for low-wage workers from paying 

unemployment insurance contributions. As 

cyclical conditions are bound to worsen and no 

concrete saving measures within the framework of 

the administrative reforms have been decided yet, 

the deficit is expected to deteriorate marginally in 

2008, but still stay close to the target set in the 

recent update of the 
Stability Programme.  Afterwards it will improve slightly due - to a large 
extent - to the phasing-out of expenditure on new 

military equipment. However, this improvement 

will not match the consolidation effort foreseen in 

the Stability Programme.  
In 2007, the debt-to-GDP ratio finally dipped 
under the 60% of GDP threshold, for the first time 

since 1992. With nominal budget deficits staying 

relatively low, the debt ratio is anticipated to 

decrease continuously over
 the forecast period.

97 Activity in 2007 Economic activity was robust in 2007. Driven by 
domestic demand, real GDP increased by 6½% 

yoy (in line with the Commission services' autumn 

2007 forecast). Growth wa
s supported by private 
consumption (5.2%) and buoyant investment 

(20.4%). Nevertheless, economic activity 

decelerated slightly thro
ughout 2007. In the final 
quarter of 2007 economic growth reached a 

preliminary 6.7% yoy on the back of lower private 

consumption. Total domestic demand grew by a 

strong 7.3% in 2007. Export and import growth 

decreased to 9.1% and 10.9% in real terms, year-

on-year, respectively. Net exports contributed 

negatively to GDP growth (-0.9 percentage points) 

on account of continuing investment activity and 

overall strong private consumption.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 Domestic demand will continue to be the main 

driving force of GDP growth, which is expected to 

ease to 5.3% in 2008 and 5.0% in 2009. Both 

investment and private consumption growth are 

likely to stay robust ov
er the projection period. 
The effects of financial turmoil are foreseen to 

remain limited due to ample liquidity in the market 

and strong demand for housing supported by rising 

employment and wages. Investment is expected to 

grow at over 12% each year
, on the back of foreign 
direct investment and an increased inflow of EU 

funds. In 2008 Poland will still be able to use the 

funds from both the 2004-2006 and 2007-2013 

programming periods.   
Private consumption is expected to accelerate by 
5.6% in 2008, although it will moderate somewhat 
in 2009. The better employment situation, 

increasing wage growth because of tightening in 

the labour market, a further cut in the tax wedge in 

2008 and lower personal income taxes in 2009 are 

the main factors suppor
ting strong growth in 
private consumption. This outlook is underpinned 

by short-term indicators which point to industrial 

production, retail sales and construction activity 

remaining close to historically high levels in the 

first quarter of 2008
. Increased private 
consumption and investments will boost domestic 

demand and increase imports, which will enlarge 

the negative contribution of net exports to GDP 

growth in 2008.   
Imports are expected to 
grow at 10½% in 2008 
while export growth is expected to slow down to 

about 7% due to lower external demand in the EU, 

Poland™s main trading partner. After reaching 3.7% 

in 2007, the current account 
deficit is expected to 
widen to about 4.6% in 2008 and 5½% in 2009, 

but higher transfers fr
om the EU will have a 
moderating impact on the capital account. The 

external deficit will be limited to 3.6% in 2009 and 

will to a large extent be financed by a stable inflow 

of foreign direct investments.  
Labour market, costs and prices Labour market conditions improved substantially 

in 2007 with employment growing by 4.5% and 

the number of unemployed decreasing by more 

than 700.000 to 1.6 million. In the coming years, 

employment will continue to increase, though at a 

slower pace on the back
 of sectoral labour 
shortages, so that employment growth will 
Economic Forecast, Spring 2008 
  98 decrease gradually to 1.3% in 2009. The projected 
rise in the employment level should translate into a 

lower unemployment rate, which will come down 

to 6.3% of the civilian labour force in 2009, the 

lowest since the beginning of the economic 

transformation. The reduction of taxes on labour, 

substantial increases in wages and the planned 

measures to increase the 
participation of older 
workers will all have a favourable impact on 

employment and the participation rate within the 

forecast horizon. Unit labour
 costs grew by 6% in 
2007, as a result of strong wage growth combined 

with modest productivity growth.  
In 2008 and 2009, nominal unit labour costs are 
likely to continue rising, albeit at a slower pace, as 

productivity growth recovers supported by high 

investments from previous years and slower 

employment creation. Annual HICP inflation 

reached 2.6% in 2007, accel
erating strongly in the 
fourth quarter of the y
ear on the back of rising 
food and energy prices. In view of a tightening 

labour market and compensation of employees 

increasing faster than productivity, market 

participants still expect some monetary policy 

tightening. Nevertheless, inflation is likely to rise, 

on the back of higher wages, rising food prices and 

hikes in controlled prices of energy and gas, to 

4.3% in 2008. HICP inflation is expected to 

decline to 3.4% in 2009, as the one-off price hikes 

fall out of the calculation of annual rates 

strengthening the favourable base effects.  
Public finances As foreseen in the autumn 2007 forecast, revenues 

from all major tax components were much higher 

than projected in
 the budget, predominantly due to 
a positive GDP growth surprise and dynamic wage 

growth, especially in the 
second half of the year. 
Total revenues for the year turned out 0.6% of 

GDP higher than forecast in the autumn. In 

particular, current taxes on income and wealth 

outperformed the previous forecast. On top of 

higher revenue, government expenditure turned out 

slightly lower than anticipated in the autumn 2007 

forecast. In particular, 
public investment growth 
was below the expected rate mainly on account of 

subdued absorption of EU funds. In addition, 

social spending needs were less than expected 

thanks to a larger rise in income per head and a 

slightly bigger-than-expected drop in the 

unemployment rate. The resulting better primary 

balance allowed for lower-than-planned debt 

growth and interest expenditure leading to a much 
lower-than-budgeted general government deficit 
(2.0% of GDP compared to
 3.4% in the November 
2006 convergence programme).  
The 2008 budget indicates
 a worsening of the 
central state balance (non
 ESA95) by about 0.8% 
of GDP in 2008 compared to the 2007 outturn 

because of a number of de
ficit-increasing measures 
adopted before the parliamentary elections. Most 

of them will reduce government revenues: (i) a 

second cut in social contributions (exceeding 1% 

of GDP and following the one made in the middle 

of 2007) is the most costly item, followed by (ii) 

personal income tax relief for families based on 

number of children.  
On the expenditure side, the 2008 budget restores 
the generous (inflation plus wage growth) annual 

indexation of pensions and disability benefits, 

which had been abandoned as part of the Hausner 

plan in 2004, with an overall budgetary cost in 

2008 estimated at almost ½% of GDP.  
The deficit-increasing measures will be partly 
offset by (i) significantly higher inflation, 

compared to the budgetary projections, that 

reduces real expenditure which is predominantly 

fixed in nominal terms, (ii) improving tax 

compliance and falling inactivity rate owing to the 

tax wedge cut, (iii) higher taxable income due to 

lower social contributions, and (iv) excise duty 

hikes related to the EU tax harmonisation. All 

things considered, this forecast anticipates that the 

general government deficit will increase to 2.5% of 

GDP in 2008 according 
to the spring 2008 
forecast. In 2009, the general government deficit ratio is 
expected to rise marginally. A personal income tax 

reform will be the main deficit-increasing measure 

(estimated at about 0.6% of GDP). The vast 

majority of tax-payers will be subject to a low 

marginal rate of 18%. This impact will be 

cushioned by further improvement in tax 

compliance and falling inactivity thanks to lower 

overall tax wedge. There seems to be a particularly 

high potential for reducing the shadow economy 

and stimulating labour activity in Poland, as 

suggested by the significant difference between the 

registered unemployment rate and the 

unemployment rate from labour force surveys 

(about 3 percentage points in the beginning of 

2008). Furthermore, Poland has one of the lowest 

activity rates in the EU (6
3½% compared to almost 
71% in the EU in the second half of 2007),

  99 especially for those aged 55+. The steep increase 
in corporate-income and small-business personal-

income tax revenues in the recent years in Poland 

may be partly explained with a better compliance 

following a reduction of initially high tax rates. 

One more round of hikes in indirect taxes required 

for EU harmonisation will have a direct deficit-

decreasing effect (about 0.1% of GDP). After a 

steep decrease (by about 2½% of GDP) in 2007, 

gross debt is projected to fall more slowly this year 

and next to about 44% of GDP in 2009. If 

privatisation is reactivated, as planned by the new 

government, the debt ratio may decline faster.

% of GDP
100 Activity in 2007 In 2007, GDP grew by 1.9%, thus continuing the 
moderate acceleration of economic activity that 

started in mid-2005. This outturn was driven by 

greater dynamism of domestic demand, especially 

investment, and a robust export performance.  
Domestic demand grew by about 1½%, picking up 
from a situation of quasi-stagnation in the 

preceding year. This upturn was mainly driven by 

the revival of gross fixed capital formation, with 

equipment investment posting strong growth and 

the construction sector displaying some signs of 

recovery in the second half
 of 2007 after years of 
marked retrenchment. Economic activity was 

further helped by a sli
ght acceleration in household 
consumption on the back of a significant rise in 

durable goods expenditure. 
The contribution of the ex
ternal sector to GDP 
growth declined significantly in 2007. This profile 

reflects a progressive decel
eration of exports over 
the course of the year, as well as a greater 

dynamism of imports. The former largely reflected 

a fast deceleration in car and machinery exports, 

while the latter was primarily fuelled by the brisk 

expansion in durable goods consumption and 

investment in equipment. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 The economic outlook for 
the forecast period is 
affected by adverse external developments against 

a backdrop of persistent structural fragilities and 
low potential GDP growth. In particular, actual 
GDP growth appears to be dampened by the 

slowdown in economic ac
tivity of major trading 
partners, the effects of the persistent credit market 

turmoil, and higher energy and food prices. As a 

result, real GDP growth is
 expected to decelerate, 
hovering 1½% in 2009. 
Household spending in 2008 should be constrained 
by higher inflation, tighter financial conditions, 

and increased uncertainty. However, in 2009, 

household disposable income is expected to benefit 

somewhat from the normalisation in financial 

markets through a relief in the debt service. Private 

investment is projected to decelerate while still 

exhibiting some resilience in the earlier part of the 

forecast period, largely owing to the expected 

impact of a number of specific investment 

decisions. Thereafter, the investment revival is 

foreseen to fade away against a backdrop of the 

uncertain financial and economic outlook. 
The contribution of the ex
ternal sector to GDP 
growth is foreseen to be slightly positive over the 

projection period. Whilst exports are expected to 

grow at a slower pace, in
 line with the predicted 
moderation of external demand, imports should 

also decelerate in the f
ace of weaker domestic 
demand. It is worth noting, however, that the 

projections for export activity are subject to 

considerable risks. On the one hand, exports could 

display increased resilience due to lower growth in 

unit labour costs than in some main trading 

partners, an upgraded product mix and the wider 

geographical diversification observed in recent 

years. On the other hand, export growth may be 

further contained by lower-than-expected growth 

of some major trading partners. The external 

deficit is forecast to remain high. It should be 

attenuated by higher EU funds transfers in 2008, 

amid still the change to a new seven-year package, 

and benefit from the projected stabilisation in 

commodities prices in 2009. 
Labour market, costs and prices After the upward trend observed in recent years, 

the unemployment rate has been declining 

moderately since mid-2
007. Against the current 
economic outlook, the unemployment rate is

   101 projected to remain relatively flat in 2008 and 
2009.  
After having declined in 2007, inflation is 
expected to pick up in 2008, fuelled by rising 

energy and food prices. In
 2009, in line with the 
projected containment of the prices of those items 

inflation looks set to slow down again. In addition, 

inflationary pressures might be slightly mitigated 

by the effects of the 1 percentage point cut in the 

VAT standard rate as of July 2008. 
Public finances In 2007, the general government deficit 

represented 2.6% of GDP, after 3.9% of GDP in 

2006. This narrowing of the fiscal imbalance was 

underpinned by buoyant tax revenue mainly due to 

improved tax administration and compliance. In 

addition, the expenditure-to-GDP ratio declined 

with current primary expenditu
re flat in real terms. 
Spending moderation was driven mainly by 

containment of personnel expenditure, and was 

further supported by the fall in unemployment 

benefits and some health-related expenditure. 
In 2008, the government deficit is forecast to 
decline to around 2¼% 
of GDP. Overall tax 
receipts are projected to 
continue increasing in 
2008, albeit less markedly than in 2007, reflecting 
the projected deceleration 
of economic activity and 
the cut in VAT standard rate as of July 2008. In 

addition, after the high fi
gures observed in recent 
years, tax elasticities are assumed to move closer 

to their historical aver
age reflecting declining 
marginal gains from enhanced tax administration 

and compliance. The expenditure-to-GDP ratio is 

forecast to remain broadl
y stable, with personnel 
expenditure continuing to display a contained 

expansion as a result of wage moderation and 

declining central government employment. The 

granting of concessions for the exploitation of 

dams will provide a one-off deficit-reducing 

contribution of almost 0.2% of GDP.  
In 2009, on the basis of unchanged policies, the 
government deficit is projected to rebound to over 

2½% of GDP. Besides the base effect associated 

with the 2008 one-off operation, this deterioration 

is expected to be driven mainly by the further 

impact of the VAT cut in
 mid-2008. This forecast 
is made on the assumption that tax proceeds evolve 

in line with the relevant tax bases. 
After falling to 63½% of GDP in 2007, the 
government debt ratio is projected to upturn again 

and reach 64¼% of GDP in 2009.

102 Activity in 2007 After reaching 7.9% in 2006, real GDP growth 
slowed to 6.0% in 2007. Fuelled by strong wage 

increases, rising employment and the rapid 

expansion of credit, domestic demand remained 

the driver of economic growth, with gross fixed 

capital formation reaching 
a record increase of 
almost 29% in real terms. The value-added in the 

construction sector also grew at a record level of 

34%. A negative contribution came from the 

drought-induced agricultural supply shortfall that 

resulted in a considerable reduction of stocks. 

Value-added in agricultu
re contracted by 17%. 
Furthermore, the strong appreciation of the RON 

in the first half of the year led to a higher negative 

contribution from the external balance. The latter 

was only partly mitigated by the improved export 

performance in the last quarter of 2007, which 

materialised on the back of a sharp depreciation of 

the RON since August.  
Mainly driven by the trade balance, net borrowing 
from the rest of the world widened from 10.4% of 

GDP in 2006 to 13.2% in 2007. As the 

privatization of state-owned enterprises is largely 

over, FDI inflows slowed down in 2007 and the 

FDI coverage of external net borrowing dropped 

from 89% in 2006 to 44% in 2007. This may 

weigh unfavourably on Romania's external 

vulnerability. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 The forecast projects real 
GDP growth at 6¼ % in 
2008, easing towards just above 5% in 2009. 

Initially, domestic demand dynamics are expected 
to keep their momentum on the back of buoyant 
credit and wage growth. However, in the second 

half of 2008, rising commodity prices and tighter 

credit conditions, including the cumulative impact 

of recent interest rate hikes by the central bank, are 

likely to start dampening consumption and 

investment growth. This effect is expected to 

persist well into 2009. With domestic demand 

gradually cooling down, import growth is expected 

to decelerate as well, l
eading to a halt in the 
expansion of net borrowing from the rest of the 

world, which is forecast 
to reach 15½% of GDP in 
2009.  
In contrast to the projected gradual slowdown in 
the forecast scenario, the ri
sk of a sustained strong 
boom and a further build-up of domestic and 

external imbalances leading ultimately to a sharper 

and more sudden adjustment cannot be fully 

excluded. A continuation of the boom could in 

particular result from higher than assumed wage 

increases in a context 
of increased inflation 
expectations and a fiscal policy stance that is not 

sufficiently geared to the need to contain domestic 

demand pressure. The general uncertainty related 

to the unfolding of the international financial 

turmoil could also spring negative surprises. 
Labour market, costs and prices In spite of the contraction of several labour-

intensive industries (especially textiles and 

clothing), overall employment grew by 1.3% in 

2007 and is projected to still expand by almost 1% 

in 2008 and ¾% in 2009. The job creation process 

in the formal private sector will be sustained by 

foreign investment and goes hand in hand with a 

further reduction of the informal economy. 

Unemployment is projected 
to decline slightly over 
the forecast period to just above 6%. However, 

increasing skill shortages are driving up unit 

labour cost, affecting Romania's international 

competitiveness in spite
 of the recent RON 
depreciation. Wage and exchange rate developments, 
compounded by supply-side shocks and rising 

international commodity prices have also fuelled 

an upturn in inflation, 
which reached an annual 
6¾% in December 2007, thereby exceeding the 

central bank's end-year ta
rget band of 4+/-1%. In 
response, the main policy rate has been increased

Nevertheless, annual infla
tion is projected to edge-
up to an average of 
around 7½% in 2008, 
reflecting the pass-through of external price 

increases and exchange rate depreciation along 

strong demand pull pressu
res. In 2009 it should 
ease to slightly below 5% in 2009.  
Public finances The budget deficit was 2.5% of GDP in 2007 (up 
from 2.2%
1 of GDP in 2006). This is slightly lower 
than the original budget target of 2.7% of GDP. 

Higher-than-planned public wages and social 

transfers were compensated by an under-

realisation of capital spending and well performing 

revenues.  
In 2008 and 2009, the deficit is expected to further 
widen to 2.9% and, under unchanged policies, 

3.7% of GDP respectively. One important 

expenditure increasing factor
 is an almost doubling 
of pensions over this period. Also, part of pension 

contributions are redirected to a funded second 

pension pillar introduced in 2008 (the budgetary 

cost is estimated at 0.2% and 0.3% of GDP in 2008 

and 2009 respectively). In addition, the social 

contribution rate will be gradually cut by 6pps in 

the course of 2008 with th
e full impact felt as from 
2009. These reforms will be partly financed by 
some measures aimed at broadening the 

contribution base. Gross fixed capital formation is 

projected to gradually 
increase, assuming an 
improved absorption of EU funds. Direct tax 

revenues are expected to remain the main revenue-

increasing item. Despite r
ecent measures to control 
public expenditure, there remains a considerable 

risk of higher deficits, adding to the already 

expansionary fiscal policy in a context where 

macro-economic vulnerabilities would call for a 

more restrictive fiscal policy. The risk factors 

include: lower revenues, including a more negative 

impact of the above-mentioned reforms on social 

contributions; public wage slippages as seen in the 

past; a continuation of the dismal track record in 

terms of budgetary planning and execution (in 

particular if the recent measures are not effective); 

and expenditure pressures due to the political cycle 

(elections in 2008 and 2009).  
The 2006 deficit was revised upwards from 1.9% 
of GDP, due to new information on debt 

cancellation in favour of third countries, partially 

compensated by the positive impact of revisions 

concerning other government transactions.

104 Activity in 2007 Economic activity in Slovenia continued to be 
buoyant in 2007. Real GDP growth in this first 

year of euro-area member
ship reached 6.1% yoy, 
the highest value since the country's independence. 

However, this was accompanied by a marked pick-

up in inflation, with aver
age annual HICP inflation 
standing at 3.8%. 
As in 2006, economic growth was mainly driven 
by gross fixed capital formation. The latter 

increased by an impressive 17.2%, mainly as a 

result of buoyant motorway and other 

infrastructure construction, as well as a strong 

increase in residential construction. Household 

consumption growth was sustained, due to a 

marked rise in employment as well as a favourable 

development of net wages. In contrast, the external 

sector's contribution to GDP growth turned 

negative in 2007 (-0.9 pp.) despite very vigorous 

growth in exports of goods and services (13.0%). 

The even stronger increase in imports (14.1%) was 

mainly fuelled by buoyant demand for investment 

goods and intermediate goods used in exports. 

Despite the recorded gains in export market shares, 

some deterioration in competitiveness indicators 

emerged due to the pick-up in domestic inflation. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 The central scenario foresees a moderate 

deceleration of GDP growth 
in Slovenia to 4.2% in 
2008. This slowdown to slightly below the average 

of 4.3% recorded in 1998-2007 is linked mainly to 

a projected significant d
eceleration of gross fixed 
capital formation, which after last year's 
exceptional growth is se
t to increase by around 
6.5 % in 2008. It is expected that the still dynamic 

investment activity will continue to be sustained 

by the public sector's infrastructure investment, 

especially in motorway
s and railways. Private 
consumption is projected 
to slightly accelerate. 
Continuing strong real disposable income stems 

mainly from significant wage increases in the 

public and probably also 
the private sector. Income 
groups with a high spending propensity should 

benefit particularly from net wage growth. The rate 

of growth of exports is 
projected to decelerate in 
the context of a less favourable euro area 

environment. At the same time, the slowdown in 

investment and exports should reduce import 

growth, resulting in a small positive contribution 

of net exports to GDP growth. 
With a projected GDP growth rate of slightly 
below 4 %, the slowdown of GDP growth is 

expected to continue in 2009, mainly due to further 

deceleration of capital form
ation. In particular, 
construction is projected to expand more slowly as 

investment in motorway construction levels off. 

Private consumption is forecast to remain buoyant 

on the back of continued growth in real disposable 

income due to sustained wage growth and 

declining inflation. It is envisaged that exports 

growth will ease compared to the preceding years. 

The growth rate of imports should also moderate, 

reflecting the slowdown in investment and 

consumption demand. Thus, net exports should 

maintain their positive contribution to growth.  
Labour markets, costs and prices Consumer price inflation 
increased markedly in 
2007, reaching an average 
level of 3.8 % for the 
year as a whole, compared
 to 2.5 % in 2006. While 
external shocks reflecting food and energy price 

developments played a significant role, their 

effects are likely to have been amplified by 

domestic factors. In particular, price increases may 

have been facilitated by low competition in some 

sectors as well as strong demand pressures. Several 

indicators suggest rising demand pressures led to 

some overheating of the economy in 2007: firm 

surveys reported high capacity utilisation and lack 

of skilled personnel; real interest rates have been 

very low; and the economy has probably been 

experiencing a positive output gap. In contrast,

   105 euro did not contribute more than 0.3 pp. to annual 
inflation. 
From a high of 6.5% in the first quarter, HICP 
inflation is projected to d
ecelerate in the course of 
2008, leading to an elevat
ed average rate of about 
5.4% for the year as a w
hole. Despite the expected 
slowdown in activity, and also in view of expected 

commodity price developments, the risks to the 

inflation outlook are mainly on the upside. Private 

sector wage negotiations are ongoing and are 

likely to be influenced by the January 2008 

agreement for th
e public sector, which implied 
almost full indexation of wages to the difference 

between expected and actual inflation in 2007. The 

government's efforts to reduce income disparities 

within the public sector in 2008-2010 might imply 

that employees will press for even higher 

increases.  
Labour market developments were favourable in 
2007 with a strong incr
ease in employment of 
2.7 % yoy. Employment expansion was especially 

strong in construction. Unemployment fell to 

4.8 % in 2007 and is probably below the natural 

rate. It is projected to decline somewhat further in 

2008 and 2009, while employment growth is 

expected to decelerate in
 the face of the economic 
slowdown.  
Public finances The general government deficit narrowed to 0.1 % 

of GDP in 2007 after 1.2% in 2006. This outturn 

was below the 0.6 % deficit anticipated in the 

November 2007 stability programme. On the back 

of the strong economic activity and positive labour 

market developments, revenue increased markedly 

despite the reduction of personal income tax 

brackets and the fall in corporate and payroll taxes, 

in the framework of a comprehensive tax reform.  
The general government deficit is expected to 
increase to 0.6% of GDP in 2008. Revenue as a 

share of GDP should dec
line as the tax reform 
continues. Measures designed to raise disposable 

income, including tax breaks for lower income 

groups and increases in some transfers, are 

projected to have an adverse effect on the deficit. 

However, the better-than-planned 2007 budgetary 

outcome is expected to offset these effects to a 

large extent. In contrast, ignoring the demands of 

certain groups of public sector employees for 

higher-than-anticipated wage rises might prove 

difficult, especially in view of the general elections 

scheduled for October. Ov
er the forecast horizon, 
debt as a share of GDP 
is projected to decline 
slowly to around 23 % in 2009, while the general 

budget deficit is not expected to deteriorate despite 

the continuing slowdown.

106 Activity in 2007 In 2007, economic grow
th accelerated to 10½% 
from 8½% recorded in 2006, thus continuing the 

strong performance of recent years. Economic 

expansion was fuelled by both domestic demand, 

especially by investment and private consumption, 

and a strongly increased external growth 

contribution.  
Private consumption expenditure increased by 
some 7% benefiting from strong wage growth and 

improved labour market conditions. Robust 

investment activity in th
e corporate sector kept 
gross fixed capital formation growth at almost 8%, 

while pre-stocking with cigarettes at the end of 

2007 (preceding the excise
 tax hike in January 
2008) has added around 1 percentage point to 

growth in 2007.  
In spite of the strong exchange rate appreciation, 
export growth maintained significant momentum, 

although slowing by some 5 percentage points to 

around 16%, as the recently built manufacturing 

capacities in the automotive and electronics sectors 

continued to increase production. At the same 

time, import growth fell substantially, including a 

drop in investment related technology imports. As 

a consequence, an improved trade deficit induced a 

significant decline in net borrowing from the rest 

of the world, which decr
eased to roughly 4¾% of 
GDP. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 Economic growth is expected to ease to some 7% 

in 2008 and 6¼% in 2009. Domestic demand is 
likely to remain the main driving force of 
economic expansion while the contribution of net 

exports should decline ma
rkedly over the forecast 
horizon. 
Further improvements in the labour market and 
sustained credit expansion are expected to continue 

to support private consumption growth, which, 

albeit moderating, should remain at well above 

5%. Gross fixed capital formation should stay 

robust at around 7%, due to additional foreign 

direct investments in the automotive and 

electronics sectors, as more suppliers of 

automotive and electronics parts are expected to 

settle close to the already built assembly plants.  
The somewhat decreasing dynamics of gross fixed 
capital formation and consumption should dampen 

import growth. As export growth is anticipated to 

continue to exceed im
port growth, the trade 
balance is likely to keep improving and thus 

contribute to a further decline in net borrowing 

from the rest of the world. 
Labour market, costs and prices In 2007, total employment increased by some 2% 

while the unemployment rate fell significantly to 

almost 11%. Unemployment is expected to further 

go down in 2008 and 2009, though at a slower 

pace, as still expand
ing export production 
capacities are likely to continue to provide 

additional employment opportunities. Although 

wage growth is expected to remain stable, falling 

productivity growth will create some upward 

pressure on unit labour cost. 
HICP inflation dropped significantly to just below 
2% in 2007, thanks mainly to smaller increases in 

energy prices combined w
ith strong exchange rate 
appreciation. However, since the last quarter of 

2007, rapidly growing food and energy prices have 

resulted in gradually rising HICP inflation, which 

is expected to peak in 
the third quarter of 2008. 
Favourable base effects at the end of 2008 should 

ensure some moderation in the inflation rate, 

especially if second round 
effects are kept in check 
and there is no further su
rge in commodity prices 
at the world markets. The disinflationary base 

effect is, however, likely to be partly offset by a 

jump in the inflation contribution of tobacco prices 

in the last quarter of 2008 as accumulated stocks of

  107 cheaper cigarettes are expected to run out. As a 
result, average HICP inflation is estimated to 

increase to around 3¾% in 2008 and then to 

decrease to some 3¼% in 2009. 
Public finances The January 2008 increase 
in excise taxes induced 
a larger-than-expected accumulation of stocks of 

cigarettes by consumers a
nd enterprises at the end 
of 2007. It thus resulted in extra revenue of some 

½% of GDP compared to 
¼% of GDP foreseen by 
the budget. This effect together with higher-than-

expected GDP and employment growth and lower-

than-budgeted spending on co-financing for EU-

funds ensured that the general government deficit 

dropped to 2¼% of GDP in 2007.  
Revenue-increasing measures included in the 2008 
budget such as a broade
ning of the corporate and 
personal income tax base and an increase in the 

maximum ceiling on social contributions are 

foreseen to generate additional revenue of around 

¼% of GDP in 2008. However, these revenue-

increasing measures will be more than fully offset 

by the unexpected revenue shortfall induced by the 

2007 pre-stocking. On the other hand, a further 

revenue-increasing effect is likely to stem from 

another hoarding of cigarettes motivated by a 
lower excise tax hike planned for the end of 2008. 
On the expenditure side, farming subsidies are set 

to continue increasing substantially. Nevertheless, 

continued strong growth combined with limited 

wage increases in the public sector should ensure 

that the general government deficit falls to some 

2% of GDP in 2008. 
Under the customary no-policy-change assumption 
the budget deficit is project
ed to increase to around 
2¼% in 2009 given the likely revenue shortfall of 

some ½% of GDP resulting from the expected pre-

stocking with cigarettes at the end of 2008. 
Gross public debt is expected to remain broadly 
stable over the forecast horizon.

108 Activity in 2007  GDP growth reached 4.
4% in 2007, about 1 
percentage point above the potential growth 

estimate. The current cyc
lical upswing appears to 
have peaked during the first half of 2007, when 

growth reached over 5% yoy. In the second half of 

2007, growth moderated to about 3½ %, led by 

slowing domestic demand. Weakening consumer 

confidence triggered a slowdown of private 

consumption in the final quarter of 2007. Contrary 

to the other demand components, investment 

growth did not moderate over 2007, expanding by 

7½ % for the year as a whole. This is the fastest 

growth recorded over the 
present decade, driven 
notably by non-residential construction. Also, 

equipment investment picked up in 2007 after 

several years of weak growth, supported by capital 

replacement needs and high capacity utilisation 

rates in industry. On the other hand, housing 

investment increased on
ly incrementally after 
strong expansion over several previous years. 

Trade volumes also slowed markedly during the 

second half of 2007, but the contribution to growth 

from foreign demand remained positive.  The 

metal industry was the main driver of export 

growth, benefiting from robust global demand for 

investment goods. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009  Finland is relatively well shielded from the direct 

impact of the global turmoil, as its financial sector 

appears unaffected to date and the real-estate 

market is set to slow in an orderly fashion. 

Nevertheless, it is expected that economic activity 

will moderate subsequent to the boom years of 
2006-2007. The rapid rise in wages (determined by 
sectoral agreements) and strong employment 

growth at the beginning of 2008 do not appear to 

boost growth of private consumption further. A 

sharp rise in inflation in 2008 will cut purchasing 

power, combined with global economic 

turbulences undermining consumer and business 

confidence. Weaker global demand will curb 

export growth in all the main industries. Notably, 

wood and paper exports ar
e expected to contract 
both in 2008 and 2009, due to wood supply 

disturbances caused by Russian round-wood 

export duties, a strong euro and global demand 

shifts for paper and wood products. Investment 

activity is expected to moderate steadily over the 

forecast period. Growth should be upheld by non-

residential construction and capital expenditure, 

with housing investment shrinking marginally. A 

sharp rise in government sector investment will 

boost expenditure on infrastructure projects, 

budgeted mainly for 2008.  
Quarterly yoy growth is forecast to subside 
somewhat below potential growth during the 

second half of 2008 and first half of 2009.  

However, by the end of 2009, growth momentum 

is expected to pick up and settle at close to its 

estimated potential. The predicted improvement in 

the external environment and global growth, 

coupled with a decelerati
on of inflation to about 
2%, is seen to support exports and private 

consumption in the last quarters of 2009. 

Nevertheless, the recovery of the external sector is 

forecast to be modest, given that the relatively high 

wage growth would erode external 

competitiveness.  
Labour market, costs and prices During the cyclical upswing in 2006-2007, 

employment increased rapidly by about 2% 

annually, mainly on account of new jobs in 

services and construction. Unemployment is 

predicted to decline to close to 6% of the labour 

force by the end of the forecast period, but further 

improvement is held back by relatively large 

geographical and skills mismatches in the labour 

market. The growing tightness in the labour market 

combined with decelera
ting economic activity is 
expected to increasingly constrain employment 

growth. The current multi-annual wage agreements 

provide for 5½ % wage growth in 2008 and

  109 slightly less in 2009. This is 1½ percentage points 
higher than on average over
 the recent years. As a 
result, unit labour costs will rise, reaching 

particularly high levels in services, and leading to 

domestic inflationary pressures. In industry, 

productivity growth has traditionally been 

considerably faster than in
 services, translating to a 
more limited loss of external competitiveness than 

what could be concluded from the national 

average.  
After low yearly increases of about 1½ % during 
the first half of 2007, HI
CP inflation accelerated to 
close to 2% in the final quarter of 2007 on the back 

of energy price rises. A further sharp increase 

occurred in the beginning of 2008, when rising 

food prices pushed inflation up to 3½ %. The rise 

in world food prices passed through to retail prices 

with a considerable lag, but in a single large step, 

as Finnish retailers appear to have relatively long-

term supply contracts. Also, the rise of energy and 

alcohol excises at the 
beginning of the year 
contributed to inflation by about 0.3 percentage 

points. In line with the expected softening of 

global energy and food price pressures, inflation is 

expected to fall back to below 2½ % in 2009, also 

helped by the cuts to food VAT rates in October 

2009. 
Public finances  The general government surplus peaked at 5.3% of 

GDP in 2007 (including a 0.3 p.p. upward revision 

from pension funds' investments). The bulk of the 

general government surplus originates from 

accumulating pension fund assets, accounting 

annually for about 3% of GDP. Local governments 

have consistently recorded a close-to-balance 

fiscal position in recent years. The short-term 

fluctuations in the general government surplus are 

largely driven by central government finances, 

where expenditure ceilings have helped to build up 

surpluses during good economic times. While the 

sharp rise of central government expenditure in 

2008 will reduce the surplus, it will decline 

moderately by about half a percentage point as 

higher expenditure is mitigated by rapid nominal 

growth in tax bases. The surplus will further edge 

down in 2009, in line with the slowing growth 

profile. The government debt ratio is projected to 

decline to below 30% of GDP by 2009.

110 Activity in 2007 Despite domestic demand remaining very strong 
during the first three quarters of 2007, annual GDP 

growth in Sweden slowed to 2.6% for the year as a 

whole. This compares w
ith an above-trend growth 
of 4.1% reached in 2006. The slowdown was 

mainly due to a weak ex
port performance, where 
buoyant services exports 
only partly compensated 
for a very sluggish increase in exports of goods. 

The latter was held back by subdued external 

demand and capacity constraints in the export 

sector. Combined with relatively strong import 

growth resulting from continued strong 

consumption and investment growth, net exports 

gave a significantly negative contribution to GDP 

growth in 2007. There was a substantial stock-

building in 2007, contributing 0.7 percentage 

points to GDP growth. This was mainly due to 

weaker than expected demand. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 The Swedish economy is expected to continue to 

slow down in both 2008 and 2009, with annual 

GDP growth decelerati
ng to 2.2% and 1.8%, 
respectively. Feeling the ef
fects of the turbulence 
in the international financial markets that started 

last summer combined with a more pessimistic 

view of the outlook fo
r the global economy, 
Swedish consumers started to rein in spending 

already in the fourth quarter of 2007. Most 

indicators at the beginning of 2008 point to 

continued consumer cautiousness, with retail sales 

(including auto sales) and consumer confidence 

showing continued weakness. In the latter part of 

2007, rising inflation started to erode the real 
purchasing power of consumers, who have also 
seen a sharp decline in th
eir wealth over the last 
couple of months as a result of the slump in stock 

prices and the stagnation in house price 

appreciation. Despite relatively strong nominal 

wage gains and some further increases in 

employment, consumer spending is forecast to 

expand at a slower pace over the forecast period. 

Typical of this stage of 
the cycle, the household 
saving rate thus looks set 
to rise over the forecast 
horizon, exceeding 11% in 2009.  
After posting a strong performance in 2007, 
investment growth looks set to slow down over the 

forecast period. The combination of a more 

subdued outlook for economic activity and the 

effect of previous strong 
investment should lead to 
a lower capacity utilisation in the years ahead. The 

deceleration should be broad-based, but more 

pronounced in the residential construction sector, 

where investment growth is expected to ease from 

an average pace of 15% in
 the 2004-06 period to 
about 1 ½ % in 2008-09.  
Export growth is expected to continue to moderate 
somewhat over the forecas
t period. While external 
demand remained fairly strong in early 2008, the 

effects of the financial turmoil, the slowdown of 

the US economy and falling cost-competiveness 

are likely to restrain export growth going forward. 

However, as domestic demand Œ and thus imports 

Œ is also forecast to grow less briskly, net exports 

should contribute positively to GDP growth in 

both forecast years. 
Labour market, costs and prices The labour market strength
ened markedly in 2007, 
with employment expanding by 2.4%. This 

performance can be explained by a pent-up need 

for new hiring after a period of jobless growth in 

2004/2005 and the various measures undertaken by 

the government to increase labour market 

participation. Unemployment fell by almost 1 

percentage point to 6.2%. While employment is 

expected to continue to increase in 2008 and 2009, 

albeit at a significantly slower pace, 

unemployment is projected to rise slightly over the 

forecast period. As a consequence of strong employment gains and 
decelerating output grow
th, productivity slowed

  111 sharply in 2007. As employment gains decelerate 
over the forecast period, productivity is likely to 

recover somewhat. However, with last year's wage 

agreements resulting in strong nominal wage 

gains, real unit labour costs are likely to continue 

to rise in both forecast years. 
As a result of sharply higher food and energy 
prices and some domestic co
st pressures, inflation 
picked up towards the end of 2007. While it is 

expected to gradually come down over the forecast 

period, the 12-month figure is likely to remain 

above 2% for the whole of 
2008. To prevent rising 
inflation expectations from translating into higher 

actual inflation, the Riksbank hiked its policy rate 

by 25 basis points to 4.25% in February 2008. In 

view of the slowdown of the economy and the 

expected stabilisation of international commodity 

prices, the Riksbank is likely to cut rates somewhat 

during the forecast period. 
Public finances Public finances had a very strong performance in 

2007, registering a surplus of 3.5% of GDP. 

Despite various expansionary elements contained 

in the 2007 budget, including reductions of both 

income and wealth taxes, the strengthening of the 
labour market contributed to both higher-than-
foreseen tax revenues and lower expenditure. 
While public finances are expected to remain 
strong over the forecast period, the surplus is likely 

to narrow somewhat. The effects on tax receipts 

from both smaller capital gains and slower 

economic growth are likel
y to bring the surplus 
down to 2.7% and 2.3% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, 

respectively. While the revenue to GDP ratio is 

forecast to come down slightly, public spending as 

a share of GDP should remain more or less 

constant. On the basis of continued high general government 
surpluses, the government debt ratio is projected to 

decline further to less than 32% of GDP in 2009.

t*changes in inventories not shown 
112 Activity in 2007 Economic activity in the final two quarters of 2007 
still showed relatively robust GDP growth of 0.6% 

in each quarter, having sl
owed slightly compared 
to the first two quarters. Following minor 

downward revisions annual GDP growth stood at 

3.0% in 2007, after 2.9% in 2006. Financial market 

conditions were tense through the latter part of the 

year, during which credit 
conditions tightened and 
liquidity problems in the banking sector persisted. 
The economy's expansion in the second half of the 
year continued to be supported by private 

consumption, which showed signs of moderating 

in the final quarter. Growth in gross disposable 

income rebounded in the final quarter, bolstered by 

wages and salaries and by property income 

received by households. This helped households to 

rebuild savings, with the saving ratio nonetheless 

falling to 2.9% for the whol
e year, compared to an 
already low 4.8% in 2006. 
Total investment growth accelerated in the second 
half of the year, following subdued activity in the 

second quarter. The recovery
 was mainly driven by 
business investment, with some additional stimulus 

from general government investment.  
General government consumption was broadly 
growth-neutral in the second half of the year.   

Build-up of inventories strongly supported growth 

in the third quarter, with the contribution easing in 

the final quarter.  
Net external demand proved volatile throughout 
2007, but continued to exert an overall drag on 
growth in the second half. Due to a sizeable fall in 
earnings on direct investment in the UK stemming 

from the ongoing financial market turmoil,
 the 
external deficit fell from 5.5% of GDP in the third 

quarter to 2.4% in the fourth, bringing the annual 

deficit to 4.2% of GDP.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 The economic outlook for 2008 and 2009 is largely 

shaped by developments in the housing market and 

the financial sector, both of which are likely to 

dampen growth in 2008. At the same time, the 

significant depreciation of the pound's nominal 

effective exchange rate (by over 11% between 

August and March) is lik
ely to improve the price 
competitiveness of UK exports, while at the same 

time aggravating inflationary risks in the short 

term. 
The central outlook envisa
ges a marked slowing of 
private consumption in 2008, driven by more 

restrictive borrowing conditions and a downward 

correction in house prices, and only a limited 

recovery in 2009. The Bank of England's April 

2008 credit conditions survey showed that 

conditions for all types of lending to households 

tightened in the first quarter, and were expected to 

be restricted further in the second quarter. 

Expected falls in net housing equity would also 

weaken the collateral value of housing for secured 

borrowing, thus compounding the ongoing 

tightening of credit conditions. As a consequence, 

household spending growth will slow on account 

of lower secured and unsecured borrowing and a 

squeeze in gross disposable income due to lower 

net interest income. Whilst moderate earnings 
Member States, The United Kingdom 
  113 growth will support private consumption, 
employment growth will no longer do so as it 

slows to almost zero over the forecast horizon. 
Investment is also set to
 slow in 2008 on account 
of tighter lending conditions, including through the 

consequences of the housing market correction on 

residential investment. Both the availability and 

the price of corporate credit have been tightened 

successively since mid-2007 and are expected to 

become more restrictive over the near term. 

Together with a weaker business climate, this will 

dampen business investment in 2008, though 

investment should return to more robust levels in 

2009 due to improved corporate earnings and 

elevated capacity utilisation.  
Government consumption will continue providing 
a moderate stimulus in 2008, with the latest 

Budget plans confirming a relatively tight 

expenditure envelope over the forecast horizon.  
The growth contribution of net external demand is 
expected to turn sharply positive from 2008. This 

is driven by a slowdown in imports in line with a 

moderation of domestic demand growth and the 

weaker exchange rate, while the pound's 

depreciation will support a recovery in exports that 

more than makes up for more subdued growth in 

key markets such as the US and the euro area.
12 Income account payments and receipts will be 

affected in the short term by writedowns of 

banking assets amidst the ongoing financial 

turmoil, but UK investment earnings overall 

should still be supported by global growth and the 

net effect of sterling depreciation, thus continuing 

to help finance the UK's substantial trade deficit. 

The external deficit is therefore likely to improve 

to around 3% of
 GDP over the forecast period.   
In summary, growth in the UK economy is 
expected to slow to around 1¾% in 2008. In 2009, 

with no large carryover effect from 2008, the 

gradual recovery in domestic demand through the 

year will bring annual growth to just over 1½%. 

This scenario is subject to downside risks relating 

to the length and severity of financial market 

problems, which remain highly uncertain but are 

crucial in view of the typically strong growth 

contribution of the UK's financial sector.  
Labour market, costs and prices The labour market has recently performed well, 

with high rates of employment (71.5% in 2007) 
and low unemployment. Over the forecast period 
employment growth is expected to slow to near-

zero as a result of the moderation in activity. The 

supply of labour is also pr
ojected to increase at a 
slower pace, reflecting re
duced immigration, and 
as a result of slowing activity the unemployment 

rate is set to increase slightly over the next two 

years.  Indications of the labour market tightening 
throughout in 2007 have not brought about an 

increase in average earnings growth.  Future 

earnings and wage growth are not expected to 

diverge from a broadly stable trend, although a 

slight moderation is expected in 2008 due to labour 

market easing. HICP inflation looks set to rise 

further to around 2¾% in
 2008 (exceeding 3% in 
the third quarter), due to food and energy price 

developments and a weaker exchange rate.  
Public finances Following a large unbudg
eted increase in the 
general government deficit in the 2007/08 financial 

year13, the weaker macroeconomic context is 
expected to contribute to a further deterioration in 

public finances during the forecast period. The 

deficit is forecast to rise from 2.9% of GDP in 

2007/08 to 3¼% in 2008/09 and to remain around 

the same level in 2009/10.

 In structural terms, the deficit in 2007/08 is 
estimated to have increased by 0.4 percentage 

points of GDP from the preceding year, half of this 

attributable to an increase in tax repayments due to 

companies overpaying corporate tax in previous 

years. The latter could have flattered the deficit 

reported for 2006/07.  
In 2008/09, the deficit is expected to increase by 
around ¼ percentage point. Revenue growth is 

expected to slow from the previous year. Weaker 

employment earnings and reduced corporate 

profitability are expected to constrain revenues

   114 from income taxation, while lower housing market 
activity is set to dampen intakes from stamp duties. 

Indirect tax revenues will also grow at a lower rate 

than in 2007 due to lower household spending and 

an increase in the share 
of expenditure on food, 
which is not subject to the standard VAT rate. 
Discretionary tax measures coming into force in 
April 2008 have an essentially neutral effect on 

public finances. The increased revenues from the 

removal of the 10% starting rate of tax on 

employment income and the reduction in 

allowances for investment will largely finance 

reductions in the basic rate of personal income tax 

and in the main corporate tax rate  
On the expenditure side, the envelope set in the 
government's 2007 Comprehensive Spending 

Review for the three years beginning in April 2008 

envisages a deceleration in non-cyclical primary 

expenditure, which the forecast assumes will be 

adhered to, but which also implies a greater risk of 

spending overruns relative to previous years.  
In 2009/10, with growth
 forecast to remain well 
below potential and the negative output gap thus 

widening further, little change is projected in the 

nominal deficit. In structural terms, the deficit is 

nevertheless forecast to decrease by ¼% of GDP, 
reflecting the combined effects of discretionary 
measures, including the higher taxes on alcohol 

and motor vehicles introduced in the 2008 Budget, 

and continued slower growth in government 

expenditure. 
General government gross debt is expected to 
increase by 4 percentage points of GDP during the 

forecast period, to 47½% of GDP at the end of 

2009/10, with the repl
acement of the Bank of 
England's loan to Northe

 116 Activity in 2007 In 2007, real GDP grew by 5.6%, up from 4.8% in 
2006, backed by strong domestic demand.  Private 

consumption growth acceler
ated to 6.2%, up from 
3.5% in 2006.  Public consumption also recorded a 

stronger growth rate, partly driven by pre-election 

spending.  Investment activity slowed somewhat, 

due to a gradual termination of public investment 

projects in transport, 
but private investments 
became more dynamic.  Imports of goods and 

services grew slightly more strongly than exports, 

leading to a negative contribution of net exports to 

GDP growth.  
Consumer price infla
tion (CPI) accelerated 
markedly to 5.8% at end-2007, on the back of 

higher food and energy prices.  Annual average 

inflation in 2007 stood at 2.9%, somewhat lower 

than in 2006.  The cu
rrent account deficit 
continued to widen, to 8.6% of GDP, from 7.9% in 

2006.   A higher merchandise trade deficit as well 

as lower surpluses in the 
trade with services and a 
decline in net transfers contributed to the higher 

current account deficit.  Net inflows of FDI 

reached 9.1% of GDP and thus more than 

compensated for the defic
it in the current account. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 So far, the financial turmoil appears to have caused 
limited negative effects on the Croatian economy.  

However, it cannot be excluded that growth 

prospects may worsen in th
e case of a proliferation 
of the financial market turbulences.  In general, 

economic activity is forecas
t to remain robust in 
2008 and 2009.  Consumer and investor 
confidence are expected to remain positively 
affected by the prospects 
of EU accession in a not 
too distant future.   
Real GDP growth is expect
ed to slow somewhat to 
around 4.5% in 2008, before it mildly accelerates 

to 5% in 2009.  The main reason for the growth 

slowdown in 2008 is a significant moderation of 

private consumption. Specific factors which 

fuelled demand in 2007, such as payments to 

pensioners, will be considerably lower in 2008.  

Also, the recent rise in inflation reduces real wages 

and disposable incomes and may worsen consumer 

expectations. Costs for household credits may 

increase as financing conditions for banks tighten 

up further.  Private consumption may also be 

negatively affected by w
ealth effects, following 
the recent decline in the Zagreb Stock Exchange 

index.  Public consumption growth is also 

expected to slowdown co
mpared to the election 
year 2007. However, expect
ed increases in public 
sector employment and wages may partly 

compensate for lower spending on goods and 

services.  Investment growth is forecast to remain 

strong in 2008 and to accelerate somewhat in 

2009.  The contribution of public investment 

remains significant, but total investments will 

increasingly be driven by a more dynamic private 

sector which benefits from generally comfortable 

confidence levels and rece
nt improvements in the 
overall business environment. However, downside 

risks to the investment performance could ensue 

from less favourable financing conditions on 

domestic and foreign capital markets.  
The forecast expects a mild
 acceleration of export 
growth, due to higher exports to neighbouring 

countries in the region an
d a better performance of 
tourism and some manufacturing sectors.  

However, the risk of a less benign economic 

environment in the main EU trading partners could 

undermine export performance. The growth of 

total imports is forecast to
 decelerate in 2008, in 
line with lower domestic demand, and to pick up 

somewhat in 2009.  The contribution of net exports 

to growth will remain ne
gative over the forecast 
horizon, although to a lesser extent.  
The current account defic
it is expected to be 
slightly reduced to below 8% of GDP by 2009, as 

total exports are set to rise more strongly than 

imports. An increase of surplus in the trade with

   117 services will contribute to the improvement of the 
current account.   
Labour market, costs and prices Growth and investment dynamics will continue to 

impact favourably on the labour market.  Total 

employment will continue to rise, by 1-1.5% on 

average.  The unemployment rate (LFS) is 

expected to further decline.  The growth of 

nominal wages is expected to accelerate somewhat 

in 2008, as unions will su
cceed in obtaining partial 
compensations for the rece
nt surge in inflation. 
This will lead to a temporary stronger increase in 

unit labour costs.   
The forecast assumes a moderation of commodity 
price developments, in particular for food and 

energy, during 2008. However, the significant 

acceleration of inflation to
wards the end of 2007 
and ensuing carry-over effects contribute to a 

marked increase of averag
e inflation in 2008, to 
close to 6%. Part of this increase is expected to 

come from further adjustments of administrative 

prices. A sound monetary policy framework will 

continue stabilising inflation expectations. This 

together with a lowering of domestic demand 

pressures will help bringing average inflation back 

to around 3% in 2009.  
Public finances A particularly strong revenue performance in 2007 

led to a further reduction of the general 

government deficit (ESA 95) to 1.6% of GDP 

(from 2.5% in 2006).  However, the "adjusted" 

deficit, including pension debt repayments 

currently recorded off-budget, stood at an 

estimated 2.8% of GDP (3.4% in 2006).  In 2008, 

the growth of public consumption is expected to 

moderate somewhat compared to the election year 

2007. However, spending on subsidies, transfers 

and social benefits are expected to remain strong, 

given the generally slow pace of enterprise 

restructuring and recent announcements (e.g. in the 

PEP 2007) to increase social welfare spending in 

some areas. Also, policy measures aimed at 

supporting an expenditure-led fiscal consolidation 

process are not expected to be adopted over the 

short-term.  At the same time, a moderation of real 

GDP growth in 2008 is likely to reduce the growth 

of tax revenues.  Altogether, this will lead to a 

deterioration of the fiscal balance in 2008, before it

118 Activity in 2007 Output growth accelerated
 in 2007, improving 
from 4% in 2006 to 5.1% in 2007. A key impulse 

for this improved growth dynamics came from the 

export sector, which benefited from strong global 

demand for basic materials. Private consumption 

and investment remained in line with the overall 

performance. Industrial output, which accounts for 

some 20% of value added, rose by 3.7% only, 

reflecting lower production of electricity and 

textiles.  
The labour market situation continued to improve, 
although the level of unemployment is still 

particularly high.  Employment increased by 3.5% 

compared to the year befo
re, while the number of 
unemployed dropped by 1.8%.  As a result, the 

annual unemployment rate
 declined from 36% in 
2006 to 34.9% in 2007.  About 22% of the 

unemployed are between 15-24 years old.  The 

unemployment rate in this age group dropped from 

64% in 2006 to some 62% in 2007.    
Inflation had been rather low in the first three 
quarters of 2007, with inflation rates of around 1%. 

However, towards the end of the year, increasing 

prices for food and ener
gy brought the annual 
inflation rate to 2.3%. In 2006, inflation had been 

3.2%, largely reflecting the 
impact of increases in 
excise taxes.  
The current account deteri
orated during the last 
months of 2007 from a largely balanced account 

during the year to a deficit of about 3% of GDP by 
end-2007. A marked increase in imports and less 
buoyant private transfers we
re the main reasons for 
this deterioration. Inflow
s of net private transfers 
continue to amount to nearly 18% of GDP, and are 

thus nearly of a similar size as the trade deficit.  

Inflows of FDI came down to about 4.3% of GDP, 

compared to 6.8% of GDP in 2006.  However, a 

large share of this inflow in 2006 had been related 

to the privatisation of the electricity distribution 

company ESM, sold to a foreign investor.  
In 2007, the general government accounts 
registered a surplus of 0.
6% of GDP, compared to 
a deficit of 0.5% in 2006. The original budget for 

2007 had envisaged a deficit of 1% of GDP. The 

main reason for the better than expected 

performance was higher tax revenues, due to 

strong economic growth and improved tax 

collection. Towards the end of the year, the 

government has increased spending for social and 

labour market related purposes and construction 

and renovation activities (about ¼% of GDP).   
The general government debt ratio declined from 
39% of GDP at the end of 
2006 to some 25% at the 
end 2007.  This sharp decline is largely a result of 

early debt repayments.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 For 2008 and 2009, the so far positive impact of 

the global economy is expected to subside, in 

particular given the expected growth moderation in 

the country's main trading partners. In addition, the 

recent threat of Greece to 
veto the country's EU 
accession process has further added to the global 

and regional uncertainty. Nevertheless, the 

country's overall growth performance is likely to 

benefit from robust domestic demand - partly 

fuelled by private transfers - and the positive 

effects of recently taken structural measures to 

improve the business environment.  
Overall, economic activity is expected to remain 
strong, with GDP growth at 4¾% in 2008 and 

5½% in 2009. The biggest contributions will come 

from private consumption, benefitting for transfers 

from abroad. The increase of public consumption 

will be slightly GDP growth in 2008, reflecting an 

already adopted strong rise in public sector wages,

Domestic and foreign investment is seen to 
respond to the overall less benign international 

environment but also to the recent increase of 

political tensions in the region (Kosovo vs Serbia, 

the country's name issue 
with Greece). As a result, 
investment in equipment is seen to decelerate to 

some 12% in 2008 and to 11% in 2009. The high 

import content of equipment investment will limit 

the immediate impact on gr
owth. However, in the 
medium-term, lower investment growth impedes 

the country's improvement of its growth potential.  
Labour market, costs and prices The still solid GDP growth and measures to reduce 

the informal sector will translate into additional 

employment and a decline in the unemployment 

rate. A large part of the new jobs will be filled by 

so far unregistered labour, which will dampen the 

decline in the number of
 unemployed. Overall, 
employment is expected to increase by some 3½% 

on average in 2008 and 2009. Unemployment is 

seen to decline to some 32% of the labour force.  
Higher prices for food, energy and basic materials 
will raise consumer price inflation to some 6% in 
2008. However, after the petering out of this cost 
push, headline inflation should drop to below 3% 

in 2009.  
Public finances A more active policy stance government, and the 

need to modernise the co
untry's infrastructure and 
institutions will result in a shift from the close-to-

balance deficits or surpluses of the previous years, 

to higher deficits in the near future. In 2008, the 

deficit is expected to r
each 1½% of GDP. In 2009, 
higher revenues, benefiting from the stronger role 

of domestic demand and im
proved efficiency in 
tax collection could reduce the deficit towards 

1¼% of GDP.  The debt ratio is expected to 

continue to decline, reflecting strong nominal GDP 

growth and a continued policy of early repaying 

public debt. As a result, the debt ratio could fall to 

some 21% of GDP by 2009.

Turkey - GDP growth and contributions 
 %forecas
t120 Activity in 2007 Real GDP growth fell from 7% in 2006 to 4½% in 
2007, chiefly due to weaker domestic demand, 

which was partly driven by the tighter monetary 

stance, higher interest 
rates and lower lending. 
Contributions of the external sector changed 

substantially. Imports grew at 11% in 2007, up 

from 6¾% in 2006.  Exports' growth rose from 

4¾% in 2006 to 6½% in 2007. 
Inflation rose significantly to just over 9% yoy in 
March 2008 after going down to 7% in the third 

quarter of 2007, still far above the Central Bank's 

year-end target of 4%. At the same time, Turkey 

has been paying high real interest rates - of above 

10% per annum Œ but observed capital outflows 

and downward pressure on the Turkish lira. 
Strong growth over the five previous years has not 
fuelled substantial job creation. Employment 

started to rise since 2007 by roughly 1% annually.  

However, in particular due to a large inflow of 

young people in the labour force, employment 

rates stagnated at just 41%. These trends together 

led to stable unemployment rate just below 10%.   
The current account deficit fell slightly Œ partly 
reflecting falling domestic demand in the first half 

of the year - from 6% in 2006 to 5¾% in 2007. 

FDI-inflows remained historically high, and 

covered over half of the current account deficit. 
Prospects for 2008 to 2009 Due to its sizeable financing needs, Turkey may be 

more vulnerable to the current financial turbulence 

than most EU-Member States or other candidate 

countries. 
The overall picture for th
e forecasting period looks 
rather mixed.  Turkey should be able to increase 

export growth - in particular in tourism - while the 

tight monetary and fiscal policy mix will start 

supporting the disinflation process.  A gradual 

decline in inflationary pressures may then allow a 

fall in interest rates and improve the investment 

climate. Overall, economic 
activity is expected to 
rise only gradually from 4¼% in 2008 to 4¾% in 

2009.  Output growth is expected to be 

increasingly balanced, w
ith private consumption 
and equipment investment growth mitigating lower 

public consumption and construction growth than 

in previous years.   
Since inflation is expected to fall only gradually, 
growth of disposable income may not accelerate 

very rapidly, which is expected to put a break on 

private sector consumption growth from 4½% in 

2008 to 5% in 2009.  Fixed investment may 

increase slightly provided it continues to benefit 

from reduced macroeconomic uncertainty and 

declining real interest rates.   
On the other hand, the build-up of stocks is 
slowing down. Strong investment and stable 

consumption growth will lead to continued high 

growth of imports, in particular of capital goods 
and consumer durables.  Exports have been 

buoyant so far in 2008, and benefit from a weaker 

Turkish Lira and from diversification and quality 

improvements resulting from earlier high 

investments.   
Labour market, costs and prices In line with the pace of economic expansion, 

employment is forecast to increase by about 1% 

per year.  Given the sizeable inflows in the labour 

force age population, this will lead to a flat 

unemployment rate of 10% in 2008 and 2009.  
As from mid-2008, inflationary pressures are 
expected to fall slowly.  Fiscal discipline and a

   121 disinflation targets are important elements in this 
respect. 12-month consumer price inflation is 

expected to fall below 8% by the end of 2008 and 

to 6% at the end of 2009.  However, high oil and 

food prices and exchange rate pass-through might 

slow down the disinflation process.  
Growth of imports will remain strong, partially 
reflecting a rather high import content of exports.  

In 2008 exports will start benefiting from a weaker 

currency.  The current accou
nt deficit is therefore 
forecast to stabilize aroun
d 6½% of GDP in 2008-
2009.  A higher surplus of the services balance 

should contribute to maintain positive medium-

term prospects in the external sector.  
Public finances  In the election year 2007, fiscal policy was 

loosened significantly. However, corrective 

measures in the second part
 of the year brought the 
primary surplus to just over
 4% of GDP.  This still 
substantial surplus brought about a reduction in the 

debt ratio, from 46% of GDP at the end of 2006 to 

39% at the end of 2007.  General government 

interest payments have fallen from about 13% of 

GDP in 2003 to 7% of GDP in 2007. In the short 

term, public sector balances may be affected by 

higher interest rates and a slowdown in 
privatisation. Conversely, the ongoing public 
finance reforms will help to widen the tax base and 

to increase the efficiency 
of tax collection.  Non-
interest expenditures are seen to remain largely 

constant relative to GDP.  The general government 

balance is expected to change from a deficit of 

1¼% of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 1% of GDP in 

2009, as a result of gradual fiscal tightening and 

slowly falling interest rates.  
General government debt is expected to further 
decline gradually, albeit at
 a decelerating pace, to 
about 28% in 2009. Un
til early 2008, the 
government has been making progress in 

lengthening the average maturity and swapping 

foreign denominated into lira denominated debt. 

However, since the financial turbulence in spring 

2008, Turkey's vulnerability to interest and 

exchange rate volatility and rollover risk have 

become increasingly visible and the average 

maturity of its domestic debt has even started to 

shorten.

124 From housing correction to recession Declining residential construction has pushed US 
growth lower over the past two years, although 

GDP growth still registered 2.2% in 2007. But the 

housing-led slowdown broadened to the wider 

economy in the fourth quarter with GDP growth 

dropping to an annual rate of 0.6%. The economy 

has decelerated further in 
the first quarter of 2008 
and is now in a state which ultimately is likely to 

be designated a recession. 
Looking forward, it is par
ticularly noteworthy that 
real consumer spending already started to stagnate 

last winter in response to rising energy prices, 

deteriorating credit conditions, falling house 

prices, and a weakening la
bour market.  Consumer 
confidence has collapsed to long-time lows in 

recent months. At the same time, the housing 

sector slump continues to deepen. House prices are 

already around 10% lower on a nation-wide basis. 

The sector is caught in a 
vicious circle in which 
excess supply causes prices to fall; price declines 

cause delinquencies on home loans to rise; the 

resulting foreclosures lead to tighter credit 

standards; this aggravates excess supply. In 

addition, non-residential construction has started to 

decline and equipment investment is close to 

stagnation. These developments will weigh heavily 

on economic growth over
 the forecast period. 
The most positive development is the turnaround 
in net exports. For the first time since 1995, net 

exports made a positive contribution to GDP 

growth last year as real imports decelerated 

sharply.  Consequently, and despite sharply higher 

oil prices, the current account deficit narrowed 
significantly in 2007. On the other hand, the fiscal 
deficit of general government is deteriorating 

again. It already surpassed 3% of GDP last year.  
The end of the six-year long expansion is reflected 
in the labour market where employment has started 

to decline and the unemployment rate has risen 

from the cyclical low of 
4.4% in March 2007 to 
5.1% one year later. Meanwhile, overall CPI 

inflation has increased to 4%
 as energy prices have 
soared, but core CPI inflation has remained within 

the 2 - 2½% range over the past year. 
Consumers under pressure The factors which have made private consumption 

stagnate in recent months will, on balance, gain in 

strength in the near term. In particular, 

employment has much further to fall as businesses 

adjust their workforce to lower demand for their 

output. With rising unemployment, nominal wages 

will decelerate. Cr
edit availability is likely to 
remain curtailed and house prices are expected to 

fall by another 10% over the next twelve months. 

These factors will depress consumer spending 

significantly and for an extended period. Only in 

the third quarter of 2008, the personal income tax 

rebates, the central part
 of the recently adopted 
economic stimulus package, will temporarily 

bolster consumer spending. Even if house prices 

stop falling in 2009, as assumed, consumer 

spending is likely to remain depressed well beyond 

the forecast horizon becau
se the negative wealth 
effect from the housing slump kicks in with a 

considerable time lag. 
On the investment side, residential construction 
will only bottom out in the second quarter of next 

year since housing demand is still falling and the 

inventory of unsold homes remains at record 

levels. Non-residential construction should also 

decline over the forecast 
period while equipment 
investment will remain close to stagnation. The 

downturn will be tempered by the fact that 

business inventories are already relatively lean. 
Net exports can be expected
 to offset part of the 
weakness in domestic demand over the next two 

years. Although there may be some slowing of 

economic growth in key 
export markets, real 
exports should continue to expand at a healthy 

pace supported by the recent gains in international

 125 price competitiveness. Real imports, on the other 
hand, will stagnate and even decline next year. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 GDP growth of 0.9% this year, as projected, is 

exclusively due to the carryover from last year. 

Following stagnation in the first quarter, growth is 

expected to contract by 1½% on an annual basis in 

the second quarter, but the fiscal stimulus should 

lead to 2% growth in the third quarter. In the 

following four quarters, consumer spending should 

decline again, but the positive contribution from 

net exports would prevent GDP from contracting. 

When the housing sector emerges from the 

doldrums in the second half of next year, growth 

could start to crawl back to the 2% mark. The 

annual growth rate in 2009 would nevertheless 

only muster 0.7%. Due to the policy-induced spike 

in the second half of this year, the growth profile 

resembles a drawn out W (see Graph 5.1.1). 
The fiscal deficit of general government will suffer 
from a sharp deceleration in
 tax receipts because of 
the stimulus package and the cyclical downturn. It 

is projected that the fiscal deficit will rise to almost 

6% of GDP next year.  Unemployment is expected 

to rise gradually to 6.3% of the labour force in the 

second half of next year since trend growth will 
not yet be achieved by the end of the forecasting 
period. In view of the increasing slack in resource 

utilisation and the stabilisation of commodity 

prices, overall consumer pr
ice inflation is expected 
to recede to 1.3% at the end of 2009. Household 

saving as a share of disposable income is projected 

to rise by 1.8 percentage points over two years. 

The current account deficit will continue to shrink 

to 4% of GDP in 2009 - still a relatively high level.  
The significant downward adjustment of US 
growth, relative to the autumn forecast, is partly 

due to the unexpected su
rge in commodity prices, 
particularly the oil price, since last October. Even 

more important is that the housing crisis and its 

financial fallout are exerting a heavier drag on the 

broader economy than previously expected. 

Nevertheless, the risks to the present forecast 

remain skewed to the 
downside. The ongoing 
credit crunch may cause an
 even deeper cut in 
private consumption than projected here. House 

prices may fall by more than the projected 20%. 

The negative wealth effect may also be stronger. 

Furthermore, the feedback loop between the credit 

crunch, the housing crisis, the labour market, and 

consumer spending may be underestimated.

126 Resilient growth in 2007 Despite some deceleration, GDP growth has 
remained resilient at the end of 2007. For 2007 as 

a whole, GDP growth decel
erated from an average 
of 2.4% in 2006 to 2.0%. The strong GDP growth 

in the last quarter of 2007
 (+3.5% qoq annualised)
 reflects a significant contribution from government 

consumption and business investment. The 

positive contribution of net exports remained also 

sizeable as exports (in par
ticular to the rest of 
Asia) were still very dynamic while imports 

continued to be anaemic. On the other hand, 

household consumption remained sluggish and 

construction investment plummeted significantly, 

due to new domestic building regulation measures. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 The economic upturn which started in 2002 has 

been based on the steady growth in business 

investment and employment, while wages and 

household consumption remained on the side lines. 

Several indicators show th
at the corporate sector 
has lost some momentum and recent business 

surveys suggest that this weakness will continue in 

2008. As a result, the resilience of the corporate 

sector will be key to keep some growth 

momentum. So far, the expansion has failed to 

spread to households, whose confidence has been 

hit by several factors including low wage growth, 

the increase in oil and food prices, the sharp fall in 

the stock market, the errant implementation of the 

revised building standard law, several food safety 

scandals, and the political stalemate resulting from 

the divided control of the Parliament.  
Looking ahead, against the 
backdrop of the global 
economic slowdown, business investment growth 

is expected to slow in 2008, albeit moderately, due 

to sizeable profit margin
s, very little credit 
tightening and still dynamic export markets 

(mainly to the rest of As
ia). Thereafter, Japanese 
firms are expected to be less cautious when the 

gradual normalisation in the markets and the 

global outlook will occur. Construction activity is 

already showing signs of improvement, suggesting 

that the effects of the ch
ange in building standards 
are waning. As regard consumption, a slight 

deterioration in the labour market is expected to 

contain wage growth while confidence will 

continue to be hit by higher inflation prospects and 

perceptions. As a result, household spending
 is forecast to remain sluggish
 in 2008 an
d 2009. On 
the external side, though
 decelerating, emerging 
market economies are expected to show some 

resilience to the US slowdown. As a result, 

Japanese exports are forecast to decelerate 

gradually in the course of 2008 and to pick-up 

again progressively the fo
llowing year. Imports, 
which were surprisingly weak in 2007, are 

expected to accelerate in
 2008 and 2009, in line 
with domestic demand growth. All in all, Japan 

GDP growth is forecast to 
slow from 2.0% in 2007 
to 1.2% in 2008 and to remain just above 1.0% in 

2009.  
Price and monetary developments Despite some positive developments, deflation is 

not yet fully overcome. In February, both headline 

and BoJ's core CPI (excluding fresh food only) 

reached +1.0% yoy. Excl
uding food and energy, 
the core CPI remained un
changed at -0.1% yoy for 
the fourth consecutive month. High energy prices 

are expected to continue 
to support price increases. 
Headline inflation is forecast to accelerate 

somehow, albeit remaining below 1%, to an 

average of 0.7% in 2008 and 0.6% in 2008 after 

0.1% in 2007.  
Since February 2007, the policy rate has been 
maintained at 0.5%. Against the backdrop of a 

gloomier economic outlook, market participants 

expect a rate cut by the end of the year. However, 

once the uncertainties related to the financial 

turmoil dissipate, the Bank of Japan should 

continue to keep its strategy to remove gradually 

monetary accommodation not least to monitor the

 127 external implications of its ultra-loose monetary 
stance.  Public finance remain unsustainable in a long 
term perspective A noteworthy improvement 
has been recorded in 
the past fiscal year thanks to cyclical revenue 

buoyancy (in particular through corporate taxes) 

and sustained expenditure cuts. However, the 

Japanese authorities' medium term fiscal 

consolidation programme remains not ambitious 

enough. The programme, pr
esented in July 2006, 
foresees two stages: a primary surplus (excluding 

social security) would be achieved by FY2011, and 

then, by the mid-2010s, the debt-to-GDP ratio 

would be progressively brought down.  
FY2007 over-performance implies that the central 
and local government primary balance has 

improved to -0.7% of GD
P (from -1.7% the year 
before). On 17 January 2008, the Japanese 

authorities presented revised medium-term fiscal 

projections that forecast th
at, even under the most 
optimistic growth scenario
, the local and central 
government primary balance will continue to 

remain in deficit in 2011, if no additional measure 

to increase the revenues is implemented.  
While the reduction in expenditures should 
continue, a significant increase in revenues is 

necessary to, at least, stabilise the debt-to-GDP 

ratio (currently at 180% of
 GDP). Increasing fiscal 
revenues will be all the more urgent given that the 

central government™s contribution to the basic 

pension program will increase in 2009 from one 

third to one half of the costs. This is expected to 

add an additional 1% of GDP per year to public 

expenditures. Moreover, the inability to get a 

political consensus on the renewal of a temporary 

tax on gasoline will probably imply an 

"unexpected" fiscal stimulus of 0.5% of GDP in 

2008. 
The possibility of increasing tax revenues (in 
particular through a comprehensive tax reform and 

a higher consumption tax rate Œ currently at 5%) 

was expected to be discussed ahead of FY2008 

budget deliberations but the ruling party's defeat at 

the Upper house election has further complicated 

the political landscape and delayed measures 

aimed at fiscal consolidation.

%128 Strong growth performance  With GDP growth of 11.9%, 2007 was the fifth 
year in a row with double digit growth figures, 

bringing the average annual growth to 10% since 

economic reforms began in 1979. Like in 

preceding years, GDP growth was driven by very 

strong growth in fixed asset investment (up by 

24.8% in value terms) an
d a rise in the trade 
surplus from USD 177.5 billion in 2006 to USD 

262.2 billion last year. Although retail sales of 

consumer goods jumped almost 17% in nominal 

terms, the even faster growth rate of investment 

and net exports implies another decline in the share 

of private consumption in overall GDP. 
Inflation accelerating further– Following an increase in consumer prices by 1.5% 

in 2006, inflation accelerat
ed to 4.8% in 2007 and 
an even higher 8.7% in February. Consumer price 

inflation continues to be driven by food prices 

which have a very high share in the typical 

consumption basket as China is still a developing 

country. 
–and financial conditions continue to tighten Given the strong acceleratio
n in consumer prices, 
the People's Bank of China has continued to raise 

both its benchmark lending rate (to 7.47% as of 15 

December) and has brought the reserve 

requirement ratio for banks up to 15.5% as of 25 

March (compared to a rate of 13% end of October 

2007). 
 While the appreciation of the Renminbi (RMB) 
against the US Dollar has even accelerated 

recently, the RMB has not changed much in 

effective terms, not least due to the almost 

uninterrupted depreciation against the Euro.  
All in all, financial conditions have tightened 
clearly and are likely to tighten further, given the 

politically motivated strong determination of the 

Chinese leadership to decelerate the rise in 

consumer prices. Given th
e projected stabilisation 
of food prices at current high levels, however, it 

will take some time before inflation will start to 

decelerate to more acceptable 
levels. All in all, the 
rise in CPI is now projected to reach 5.7% in 2008 

and to decelerate to
 3.2% in 2009. Growth outlook for 2008 On the back of tightening financial conditions and 
slowing demand in particular from the US and 

Japan, China's growth is 
likely to decelerate to 
10% in the current year
. However, following a 
deceleration in February linked to the heavy 

snowfalls in central and southern China, exports 

are likely to recover somewhat in the near future. 

Available data on profits for the first two months 

of this year actually show
 a strong deceleration in 
profit growth of industrial enterprises from close to 

40% on the year end of 2007 to 16.5% early this 

year, indicating that 
(export) companies are 
accepting cuts in their margin
s to continue to sell 
their products, a strategy visible on the external 

side for some time now.  
Furthermore, given the likely general government 
surplus in 2007, the government has already 

announced some measures like a 43% rise in the 

central education budget
 to overcome not only 
social problems in rural ar
eas but also to maintain 
and even encourage private consumption. The 

government has also announced that it is willing to 

intervene further should the external slowdown 

reveal itself stronger than projected by authorities 

so far. Based on these assumptions, imports are expected 
to continue their strong rise; in value terms, this 

development is likely to be supported by the high 

level of petrol prices. With the growth rate of

  129 exports projected to d
ecelerate, the 2008 trade 
surplus is likely to grow only marginally in 

nominal terms and to decrease in terms of GDP. 

However, combined w
ith ever rising capital 
inflows, foreign currency 
reserves Œ which reached 
US Dollar 1.68 trillion end March 2008 Œ are very 

likely to rise even faster, obliging the People's 

Bank of China to intervene even more in order to 

avoid another jump in liquidity.   
As the slowdown in the US is now projected to 
continue well into next year, China's GDP is now 

expected to grow by 9.1% in 2009, i.e. clearly 

below its average of 10% since economic reforms 

took off in 1979.  While domestic demand is likely 

to remain strong, exports of goods are forecast to 

grow by 12% in volume terms only compared to 

more than 20% per year since 2002). With imports 

continuing their fast increase, such a development 

will drive down the trade surplus not only in 

relative, but also in nominal terms. This 

development would also be driven by the ongoing 

rise in the imports of services, in particular 

Chinese tourists going 
abroad (which already 
constitute a considerable source of income not 

only for places like Macao 
and Hong Kong SARs, 
but also for countries like Australia).  
The challenge for the Chin
ese leadership in the 
coming 20 months will be to make sure that 

inflation comes down and, in the meantime, to 

avoid that growth rates fall below the employment 

creating threshold, which some observers put at  

6.5% (because of the fast growth in productivity). 

A slowdown in growth in line with the above 

Commission projections would therefore be highly 

welcome as it would allow for a more stable 

economic environment.

have enjoyed a period of strong growth. The 

outlook for the forecast 
years, however, shows a 
return to more moderate growth in Switzerland, 

Norway and Liechtenstein
1. Iceland's GDP is 
forecast to decline consid
erably in 2008 and 2009 
following the impact of the financial turmoil and 

the conclusion of the large investments that have 

taken place in recent years.  
Norway enjoys strong economic growth... Norway continued to enjoy dynamic growth for 

the fourth year in a row, with GDP growth for the 

mainland reaching the second highest level in 10 

years in 2007 at 3.5%. Growth is broadly based, 

sustained by an expansion in almost all demand 

components and in most main industries, except 

the petroleum sector which remains stable. The 

real GDP growth rate for 2008 is forecast to 

moderate to 2.5% and to 2.1% in 2009 thus 

narrowing the output gap.  
Domestic activity will continue to be the main 
driver of growth, with still low interest rates 

fuelling strong private consumption. The latter is 

expected to keep growing 
at annual rates above 3% 
until 2009. The large investments in the oil and gas 

sector that were spurred by soaring oil prices are 

expected to be completed in the course of 2008, 

implying a continuation of
 the deceleration in 
investment growth that started already in 2007. 

Norway is expected to continue its expansionary 

fiscal policy, which is mainly funded through high 

oil revenues and tax increases. 
–with record-low unemployment The expansion in economic activity has led to a 

decline in unemployment,
 which has reached the 
lowest level in 20 years despite high labour force 

growth. Unemployment is 
forecast to remain low, 
but to inch up slightly in 2008 and 2009. Inflation 

remains subdued but is expected to increase to 

2.5% in 2008, mainly due to electricity price 

increases. In 2009 inflatio
n is expected to ease to 
1.5%. 
The outlook for Switzerland remains positive... The economic upturn that started four years ago 

seems to have ended in 2007. The upswing, which 

was initially driven by foreign demand, has 

become more broadly based over the last two years 

thanks to a significant expansion in domestic 

demand. Further supported by an accommodative 

monetary policy, GDP growth in 2007 was largely 

driven by domestic demand. The slowdown in 

world growth is expected to dampen foreign 

demand for Swiss goods and 
services this year and 
next. Consequently, real growth in exports of 

goods and services is likel
y to decelerate in 2008 
and to remain around or slightly below that level in 

2009. Imports grew at a slower pace than exports 

in 2007 but are likely to match export growth in 

the forecast years. Extern
al trade should therefore 
continue to make a positive, albeit declining, net 

contribution to economic growth over the whole 

forecast period. All in all, GDP growth in 2008 reflects both 
relatively strong external demand and sound 

investment growth, mirroring a healthy business 

environment. The capacity of the domestic 

economy to stimulate growth can be observed 

through the remaining strong demand for imported 

consumer and capital goods. Stable growth in 

consumer spending will be based on continued 

growth in incomes. GDP growth is expected to 

decelerate slightly to 2.
2% in 2008 and 2.1% for 
2009, but to remain close to potential output 

growth.  
–while unemployment continues to be low Employment is expected to
 increase slightly in 
2008, while the unemployment rate is expected to 

remain low at around or under 3.5%. The

to private consumption.  
Iceland, economic balance in sight? After a period of high growth rates supported by 

large investment projects and strong domestic 

demand, which have generated significant 

imbalances, Iceland is now facing a period of 

macroeconomic adjustme
nt. GDP growth is 
expected to decline significantly over the forecast 

period to around 0.4% in 2009. Further downside 

risks due to the uncertainty generated by the 

current credit crisis, 
the weakening krona and 
increasing unemployment could eventually lead to 

a GDP contraction in 2009. Declining domestic 

demand and a worsening labour market are turning 

the positive output gap in 2008 into a negative gap 

in 2009. 
Demand pressures in the economy are expected to 
decline sharply in 2008, largely due to high 

interest rates, slowing private consumption and 

expected ongoing weakness of domestic demand, 

though public consumption should partly offset 

continued weakness in investment.  
Unemployment is likely to increase slightly this 
year, staying un
der 2.5%, but an acceleration is 
expected in 2009, 
almost doubling the 
unemployment rate. Inflation, however, is 

expected to slow down in 2008 and 2009, partly 

due to government measures to reduce food prices. 

The current account deficit 
is expected to decline 
significantly in 2008 and 2009 following an 

improvement in the terms of trade.

th straight year of strong growth for 
Russia, which, like most 
emerging markets, has 
remained so far largely un
affected by the ongoing 
financial instability. Afte
r reaching 7.4% in 2006 
(revised upwards from the 6.7%, mainly due to 

investment), GDP growth reached 8.1% in 2007. 

Russia™s GDP is now roughly 16% of the EU™s in 

PPP terms. 
The key factors behind th
e higher-than-expected 
2007 growth were a continued acceleration of 

investment spending (which grew by almost 21% 

in 2007) and the very sign
ificant increase of net 
capital inflows observed since full capital account 

liberalisation in mid-2006, as well as by a rebound 

in oil prices. An additional factor was the increase 

in fiscal spending linked to
 the electoral cycle. All 
those factors were supported by a continued strong 

expansion of private consumption, which soared 

by around 13%. The strong expansion in 

investment is expected to continue, and average 

18% during 2008-2009. Private consumption is 

forecast to grow by 10.5
% on average, while the 
fiscal expansion is expected to abate somewhat. 

On the other hand, the outlook for capital inflows 

is somewhat uncertain. 
External position and unstable capital flows The reliance of the recen
t growth performance on 
capital inflows is highlighted by changes in the 

current account. After re
aching a goods trade 
balance of over 14% of GD
P in 2006 and a current 
account surplus of almost
 10% of GDP, Russia 
experienced a reduction in both in 2007, largely 
due to an increase in imports, which grew by 
almost 36% in USD terms, more than twice the 

growth rate of exports. As a result, the trade 

surplus fell to around 10%, while the current 

account surplus fell to around 6% of GDP. The 

commission forecast projects the continuation of 
this trend, with a sustained reduction of both the 

trade and current account surplus during 2008-

2009, expected to average,
 respectively, 7.2% and 
4% (these developments are highly dependent on 

the outlook for oil prices: during the first quarter of 

2008 the rise in oil prices generated a record 

current account surplus of USD 37 billion, or a 

61% increase over the sa
me period of 2007).  
The fall in the current account surplus in 2007 
described above was more than compensated by 

developments in the financial account,
 leading to a 
surplus: the surplus there is estimated to have 

reached almost 7% of GDP in 2007. The Central 

Bank of Russia (CBR) estimates net private capital 

inflows of USD 87 billion in 2007. This was 

largely fuelled by borrowing by Russian 

companies Œ in particular state-owned companies 

and banks (in contrast, estimations for the first 

quarter of 2008 point to a significant net capital 

outflow during that period, of almost USD 23 

billion, driven by the repayment of foreign loans 

by the non-financial secto
r). FDI into Russia also 
increased in 2007, reaching over USD 52 billion, 

with net FDI estimated at USD 6.8 billion. Larger 

net FDI inflows could in the short run counteract 

this expected fall in the current account and the 

instability of short-term loans, while in the long 

run diversifying the economy away from the 

primary sector, reducing its import intensity and 

boosting its export potential. However, for this 

scenario to become true 
the investment climate in 
Russia would need to improve. 
Investment supporting increase in growth Industrial output grew by 6.3% in 2007, while 

manufacturing growth reached 7.9%, amid a 

continued deceleration of the quarrying and mining 

sector to 0.3% (from 1.6% in 2006): oil production 

has declined, indicating the need for a more 

supportive policy framewo
rk for the sector. The 
highest sector growth rates in 2007 were registered 

in construction, which reflects the very significant 

and largely state-supported investments in 

infrastructure, and in se
rvices. Supporting this

 133 strong performance by the industrial sectors Œ 
industrial production growth in March 2008 was 

up 6.5% yoy and 11.7% mom, investment growth 

yoy also continued to be very robust, at around 

20%, close to the Commission™s forecast for the 

period 2008-2009. GDP is up by an estimated 8% 

during the first quarter of 2008.
 A strong fiscal expansion The period 2007-2008 witnessed a long electoral 

cycle for Russia, as elec
tions to the Duma were 
held in December 2007, and presidential elections 

in early March 2008. Reflecting this political 

cycle, the expenditures in 
the 2007 Federal Budget 
increased by around 2% 
of GDP compared to 2006 
(as indicated above, government expenditures, 

especially in infrastruct
ure, are an important 
component of the pick-up in investment). As a 

consequence, the budget 
surplus fell to 5.5% in 
2007. With the end of the el
ectoral cycle, the fiscal 
expansion is expected to subside to some extent, 

but the surplus is still expected to fall to below 5% 

of GDP by 2009 (this depends on oil prices, given 

Russia's reliance on energy for fiscal revenues). 
Inflation bounces back Russian CPI inflation incr
eased again to above the 
10% mark in 2007, reaching 11.9% (end-of-year 

figures) on the back of 
global food price increases, 
the growth of fiscal expenditures, a continued 
monetary expansion fuelled by capital inflows, 

policy measures to offset potential liquidity 

shortages and the faster GDP growth itself. The 

March 2008 CPI increased further, reaching 13.3% 

yoy. Accordingly, this forecast anticipates a slow 

fall in inflation to 9.5% only by 2009. Inflation is 

now a considerable policy concern in Russia. 
Main prospects for 2008 and 2009 Russia's growth is expected to remain strong 

during 2008-2009, due to a continuation of the 

increase in investment, supported by foreign 

capital inflows and the elections-induced fiscal 

expansion. Private consumption is also forecast to 

remain strong, growing at above 10% on average, 

supporting the previous factors. As a result, GDP 

growth is likely to average 7.5% in 2008-2009. 

This will lead to a continued reduction of 

unemployment, which is expected to fall to around 

4% in 2008-2009, while inflation will fall to below 

double-digit levels only slowly. The budget 

surplus will fall below 5% of GDP. Russia is at the 

same time also forecast to experience continued 

reductions of both its 
trade and current account 
surpluses to, on average, 
7% and 4% respectively.
