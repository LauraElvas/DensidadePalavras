Convention used in the Report:
Aggregate EU-15 figures in this report are generally constructed using purchasing parity exchange rates in
order to weight the individual national data. However, trade data use actual exchange rates in 1993.
Rates and indices (except CPI) are based on 1993 GDP weights, while CPI is based upon consumer spending
weights.

This Report was finalised in early March 1997.

creation is dismal. Employment has barely
risen in the Union as a whole since the
cyclical trough in 1993 - and projections
envisage little improvement. This points
to the crucial need for continued labour
cost moderation and enhanced labour
market reforms, for it is evident that the
recovery of output growth alone will be
insufficient to remedy deep-seated
structural patterns of unemployment.

The EMI’s Annual Report for 1996
highlights, first, the monetary, economic
and financial conditions in the Union,
including the state of convergence; and
second, the activities of the EMI, with
particular focus on the progress made by
the Institute in fulfilling its statutory
obligation to undertake the necessary
preparatory work for the start of Monetary
Union.
I see grounds for cautious optimism
concerning macroeconomic developments,
although the risks and challenges should
not be underestimated. An economic
recovery is under way and seems set to
continue, accompanied by relatively low
rates of inflation. For the most part, EU
foreign exchange markets have been
moderately calm. Long-term interest rates
are low, while differentials have narrowed
appreciably, to a large extent reflecting
the influence of economic fundamentals,
although this trend has been reversed
somewhat in a number of cases recently.
Against the overall background of subdued
inflationary pressures, and given the
tightening of the fiscal stance, monetary
policy has justifiably been eased further,
although counter-inflationary vigilance
remains essential.
Unemployment trends, however, are
extremely worrisome; in my view, the
recent record of the Union in terms of job

XIV

The EMI’s report entitled “Progress towards
convergence 1996”, published in
November, concluded that the majority
of Member States did not fulfil the
necessary conditions for the adoption of a
single currency. A further report will be
prepared in early 1998 for Monetary
Union to start on 1 January 1999. It is
extremely important that the economies
of the Member States making up the
Monetary Union should be convergent and
capable of remaining so.
Clearly, progress has been made in respect
of the convergence of inflation and bond
yields, and exchange rate stability has been
broadly maintained. In a welcome
development, Finland and Italy are now
ERM members. However, on the fiscal
side, the situation remains far from
satisfactory in many countries. Despite
efforts aimed at consolidation, which have
contributed to a reduction in actual deficits,
the latter still overshoot the reference
values laid down in the Treaty in most
countries. Debt ratios have continued to
rise in the aggregate, despite favourable
trends in some Member States. In my
view, the composition of consolidation
continues to rely excessively on high
revenue ratios and less than is desirable on
expenditure cuts. Furthermore, sustainable
consolidation cannot be achieved by oneoff and accounting measures.
Turning to the activities of the EMI, I note
with pleasure that considerable further
progress has been made in preparatory
work. In particular, the EMI met its statutory

obligation to specify by end-1996 the
regulatory, organisational and logistical
framework for the ESCB to perform its
tasks in Stage Three. Among the areas in
which work has advanced, I would highlight
the following:
■

the EMI contributed to proposals for
EU regulations on the introduction of
the euro;

■

the operational aspects of monetary
policy, including instruments and
procedures, have now been specified
in some detail, while the factors
underlying the eventual choice of
strategy by the ECB in the Monetary
Union have been outlined; the EMI also
submitted to the EU Council draft
recommendations for regulations on
statistics, minimum reserves and
sanctions;

■

ERM II - the foreign exchange
relationship to be established between
the Monetary Union and Member States
which are not participants - has been
clarified;

■

concerning the TARGET payment
system, the EMI has addressed issues
such as the operating time and the
organisational framework;

■

the EMI released a statement of
statistical requirements to enable the
ESCB to carry out its functions in Stage
Three.

There are a large number of other areas in
which work is being carried forward,
including aspects of the foreign exchange
reserve management of the ESCB; securities
settlement systems; the preparation of
euro banknotes; the harmonisation of
accounting rules and standards for the
ESCB and information and communications
systems. Progress has also been made
on certain legal and changeover-related
items.
A great deal of work remains to be done
in all of the areas mentioned above, notably
the detailed specification of all the technical
features of the various instruments and
procedures, and more generally in respect
of the implementation of the overall
framework so that a single monetary policy
can operate smoothly from the outset.
This will undoubtedly reveal many further
issues - but they can be overcome. The
EMI is well on track to achieve its objective
of ensuring that all the technical
preparations are ready to allow Stage
Three of EMU to start in 1999.

Executive summary

Executive summary
With this year’s Annual Report, the
European Monetary Institute (EMI) aims
to provide an overview of all aspects
related to its tasks as set out in the Treaty
establishing the European Community. 1 In
accordance with Article 11 of the EMI
Statute, the Report covers both economic,
monetary and financial conditions in the
Community up to the end of 1996 and
the activities of the EMI; it also presents
the Institute’s annual accounts. To a
significant extent, the material presented
in this year’s Report draws on earlier,
more extensive EMI publications,

particularly the reports entitled “Progress
towards convergence 1996” (November
1996) and “The single monetary policy in
Stage Three - Specification of the
operational framework” (January 1997). In
addition, this Report is also considered as
fulfilling the reporting obligations according
to Article 7 of the EMI Statute,
notwithstanding the intention of the
Institute to publish further material later
this year, particularly on the preparations
of the procedures necessary for carrying
out a single monetary policy in the third
stage.

1 Economic, monetary and financial conditions in the
European Union
Economic and financial background in 1996
Against the background of broadly
favourable global economic developments,
a moderate recovery of GDP growth got
under way in the EU from the second
quarter of 1996 onwards. In some
countries growth may have been weaker in
the fourth quarter, but this is not to be
seen as a reversal of the underlying trend.
The resumption of GDP growth in the
course of the year was not, however,
sufficient to offset the effects of the
slowdown which began in late 1995 and
continued into early 1996, so that growth
for the year as a whole was markedly
lower; real GDP growth in the EU is
estimated to have been around 1.7% in
1996, compared with 2.5% in 1995. A
key element of the weaker average
performance of growth in 1996 was the
subdued increase in fixed investment. In
this respect, a durable pattern of growth,
particularly one associated with an
acceleration of investment across the
Union, had not yet been clearly established
by the end of 1996.

2

In parallel with moderate GDP growth,
employment did not increase in most
Member States. The unemployment rate
for the EU as a whole fell slightly during
mid-1996, but rose to just over 11%
towards the end of the year. In the light of
longer-term trends, it is clear that the bulk
of EU unemployment is of a structural
rather than of a cyclical nature; for several
decades there has been a clear and
unbroken trend rise in EU unemployment
and a rather weak relationship between
GDP growth, employment and
unemployment. As a consequence, while
some increase in employment can be
expected as a result of GDP growth, in
addition to continued wage moderation a
reduction in structural rigidities in labour

(and product) markets is a sine qua non
for the alleviation of the unemployment
problem in the EU. In most countries
labour market reforms still seem to be
too marginal to significantly improve labour
market trends. Even in countries where
substantive measures have been
undertaken, more time will be necessary
for the effects of such reforms to be fully
assessed.
Price developments have remained
favourable. A crucial role has been played
by an increased emphasis placed on
medium-term-oriented monetary policies
geared towards the achievement and
maintenance of price stability. Moreover,
the favourable price climate was supported
by increased competition, both
domestically as a result of privatisation and
deregulation and internationally, partly
related to European integration and, in
some countries, to the effects of the
opening-up of eastern Europe. As a result,
inflation in the EU as a whole fell to an
average of 2.6% in 1996. This compares
favourably with the rate of 3.1% observed
in 1995 and is also a major achievement in
a historical context. Most Member States
are currently enjoying inflation rates of
close to or below 2%, and in others
inflation rates are declining. In 1996 the
reduction in inflation rates was also
supported by slow growth in import prices
and weaker domestic inflationary pressures,
the latter linked to weak demand and low
increases in unit labour costs in most
Member States.
As regards fiscal policies, the stance in
1996 continued to be directed towards
the need for consolidation, given
persistently high general government deficit
and debt ratios in most Member States. In
the EU as a whole, fiscal deficits have
continued to decline since their peak in
1993, but the average general government
deficit-to-GDP ratio was still expected to
stand well above 4% in 1996, thus
remaining a matter of serious policy

concern. The average debt ratio in the EU
has increased steadily from below 60% in
1991 to well above 70% in 1996.
Furthermore, whereas the momentum
towards lower deficits continued in 1996,
the composition of fiscal consolidation
was a ground for concern from the
perspective of the sustainability of
developments in government expenditure
and revenue. Whereas in 1994-95 some
correction took place, which was reflected
in falling deficit ratios mainly driven by
expenditure restraint, in 1996 the
momentum shifted away from cuts in
expenditure and towards increases in
revenues. Finally, also with a view to
achieving durable consolidation, short-term
or one-off measures, which are only
effective in one year, which improve the
current budgetary situation at the expense
of future budgets, or which have mere
presentational effects, cannot be regarded
as contributing to sustainability.
Compared with
exchange
rate
developments in previous years, relatively
calm conditions prevailed within the
Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). In
particular, between the end of May and
mid-October 1996, the bilateral exchange
rates between the participating currencies
remained within relatively narrow bands,
and exchange rate volatility declined
significantly compared with 1995. In
addition, two further currencies joined the
ERM in 1996: the Finnish markka with
effect from 14 October and the Italian lira
on 25 November. Developments in
currencies not participating in the ERM
followed a broadly common pattern of
appreciation until the autumn of 1996;
thereafter the pound sterling experienced
stronger upward pressure while other
currencies remained broadly stable.
Overall, when measured in terms of real
effective exchange rates, many EU
currencies may be considered to have
moved towards exchange rate levels that
are more sustainable with respect to
underlying competitive positions.

3

Against the backdrop of these trends, longterm interest rates declined over the course
of 1996 in all Member States, with the
exception of the United Kingdom, which
was in a different cyclical position. Moreover,
long-term interest rate differentials against
countries with the lowest bond yields
narrowed significantly. A combination of
factors appears to account for this trend,
including a significant reduction in expected
inflation differentials within the EU,
perceptions of progress towards fiscal
consolidation, the relative stability of
exchange rates and a decrease in political
uncertainty in a number of countries. These
factors were seen by the markets as
improving the prospects for Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) - an element which
may in turn have played an independent role
in the narrowing of differentials, both directly
and by further improving prospects for
exchange rate stability.

Monetary policies in Member States
The economic and financial environment
in 1996 allowed for a further steady but
cautious easing of monetary policies via
reductions in official and key interest rates
in most EU countries. On balance, in the
majority of Member States (namely
Belgium/Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland
and Sweden) official and key interest rates
declined to low and very similar levels.
The convergence of short-term interest
rates and inflation rates in 1996, in
conjunction with the achievement of a
high degree of exchange rate stability,
suggests the emergence of a closely aligned
stance of monetary policies among these
EU countries. In most of the remaining EU
countries economic and exchange rate
conditions in 1996 gradually became more
supportive of an easing of monetary policies.
As a result, their short-term interest rate
differentials against the Deutsche Mark
narrowed considerably. This led to a
progressive convergence of the more

4

differentiated monetary policy stance which
had been warranted for much of 1995 to
counter rising inflationary pressures and/or
renewed exchange rate turbulence in some
EU countries. The exceptions were Ireland,
which, later in the year, chose to adopt a
more strict monetary stance, and the
United Kingdom, which raised official
interest rates in the second half of 1996.

Economic prospects and challenges for
convergence
As regards economic prospects for 1997,
the conjunctural outlook is more
favourable, while the need for structural
adjustment persists. GDP growth in the
European Union is expected to pick up in
1997, whereas the situation in labour
markets is forecast to remain highly
unsatisfactory in most Member States. It is
in this field that a wide range of institutional
rigidities account for the weak
performance, and it will be a major
challenge for most Member States to
tackle them in a decisive and sustained
manner.
With regard to the state of convergence, in
November 1996 a comprehensive report
entitled “Progress towards convergence
1996” was released by the EMI. The
material presented in this Report mainly
provides a brief update of the examination
related to 1996. Little new data have
become available since then; in particular,
no new Commission data for the outcome
of fiscal policies in 1996 are yet available.
Prospects for sustained low inflation in the
EU are rather favourable although upward
risks still remain, as is evidenced by significant
increases in unit labour costs in some
countries. Against the background of fiscal
positions in 1996, many governments have
taken initiatives to strengthen their
consolidation efforts with a view to the
outcome in 1997. It is too early to judge the
effect these measures will have on outturns

in 1997 and beyond. However, in general,
more and durable progress is needed in
order to ensure sustainable fiscal positions. If
present assumptions about the improved
conjunctural outlook turn out to be well
founded, the necessary continuation and
strengthening of structural adjustments should
be facilitated. At the same time, the
temptation to relax adjustment efforts in
the light of seemingly diminishing constraints
must be avoided at all costs. In a broader
context, the decisive achievement of
government objectives can make a major
contribution to the reduction of risks linked
to the state of public finances. In particular,
there is a link between sustainable fiscal
adjustment and an improvement of growth
perspectives over the medium term which
justifies viewing consolidation efforts not
only against the background of the
requirements of the convergence criteria,
but also as necessary in themselves. Further
progress will also contribute to sustaining
exchange rate stability and the convergence
of bond yields, whereas setbacks in the
consolidation of public finances or other
factors that may reduce confidence in the
EMU process may negatively affect financial
markets.
As the deadlines for moving to Stage
Three approach, the essential requirement
of achieving a high degree of sustainable
convergence will have to be fulfilled. This
is all the more important since agents are
starting to look beyond the year 1999 and
to form expectations about likely longerterm developments in the euro area. At
stake is the macroeconomic environment
in which the European Central Bank (ECB)

will have to take its first steps in ensuring
price stability.
These considerations make it all the more
essential that monetary policies remain
vigilant with a view to ensuring price
stability. The stance adopted in the period
ahead will be particularly important in that
it will increasingly affect inflation in 1999
and thereafter, and hence price
expectations for the euro area. As regards
budgetary policies, it must be kept in mind
that the necessary strict compliance with
the fiscal criteria also implies ensuring the
sustainability of government financial
positions as a precondition for the
adoption of the single currency. As agreed
by the European Council in Dublin in
December 1996, the maintenance of sound
budgetary positions in Stage Three will
take place within the framework of the
Stability and Growth Pact. The paramount
importance of sustainable budgetary
positions also stems from the future burden
which will arise from the interaction
between interest payments on the
accumulated debt stocks, high and
persistent
unemployment,
and
demographic trends. Finally, exchange rate
stability remains an element in judging the
degree of sustainable convergence both
before and after 1999. As part of the
future monetary and exchange rate policy
co-operation between the euro area and
non-participating EU countries, a new
exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) will be
established. Membership will be voluntary;
nevertheless, EU Member States with a
derogation can be expected to join the
mechanism.

2 Preparatory work for Stage Three
In 1996 the EMI made further progress in
preparing the ground for the European
System of Central Banks (ESCB) to be
able to perform its tasks from the start of

Stage Three. This involved continuing
preparatory work in the areas of monetary
policy, foreign exchange policy, statistics,
payment systems, issuing banknotes,

5

accounting rules and standards, information
systems, and also on legal issues. The EMI
has also continued to monitor progress in
the preparatory work for the introduction
of the euro, following the adoption of the
changeover scenario by the European
Council in Madrid in December 1995.

monetary policy and to the fields of

monetary policy in Stage Three Specification of the operational framework”
in January 1997, the EMI provided the
public and the counterparties of the national
central banks (NCBs) with information of
interest regarding the operational aspects
of monetary policy. The EMI’s preparatory
work on the single monetary policy is
progressing according to schedule and the
conceptual phase has been concluded for
all the main issues of relevance. The list of
potential candidate strategies for monetary
policy in Stage Three has been narrowed
down to two: monetary targeting and
direct inflation targeting. The EMI Council
has also defined a set of monetary policy
instruments that will be made available to
the ESCB. It is envisaged that the ESCB will
mainly use open market operations, but
that it will also offer two standing facilities:
a marginal lending facility and a deposit
facility. In addition, preparations are being
made for an infrastructure allowing the ECB
to impose minimum reserve requirements
if it wishes to do so. In order to secure a
single monetary policy stance and a level
playing-field for counterparties across the
whole of the euro area, the EMI has worked
out common eligibility criteria, both for the
counterparties and for the assets to be
used in their operations with the ESCB. No
technical preparations are being undertaken
at this stage for remote access to monetary
policy operations.

In the area of foreign exchange policy, the
broad lines of the future exchange rate
relationships between the euro area and
non-participating Member States were
defined in 1996. The EMI’s report on this
issue was forwarded by the ECOFIN
Council to the Dublin meeting of the
European Council in December 1996, at
which it was endorsed. The European
Council invited the ECOFIN Council to
prepare a draft Resolution for the European
Council meeting to be held in Amsterdam
in June 1997 setting out the fundamental
elements of the new exchange rate
mechanism (ERM II). The EMI has been
invited to prepare, in parallel, a draft
agreement between central banks for
submission to the ECB and to the central
banks of the Member States not forming
part of the euro area. Preparatory work is
also being conducted by the EMI and the
NCBs to ensure that the ESCB will be in a
position to avail itself of the two basic
organisational arrangements - centralisation
and decentralisation - for the conduct of
its foreign exchange operations. Further
preparation is under way to ensure that
the ECB will be in a position to set the
foreign reserve management policy and to
monitor its implementation from the start
of Stage Three.

In the course of 1997 the EMI intends to
publish further material relating to the
specification of the ESCB’s operational

Statistics
With regard to statistics, the EMI, where
appropriate in consultation with the
European Commission, has prepared a
statement of statistical requirements for

Stage Three. These requirements were set
out in a detailed document which the EMI
released in July 1996 for the use of
banking associations and others involved in
statistical preparations, and were
summarised for more general use in an
explanatory booklet published at the same
time. Since statistical preparations take a
long time, Member States have been
strongly
encouraged
to
begin
implementation promptly. The statistical
information needed for the conduct of
policy in Stage Three will be wide-ranging.
While much of the statistical information
is already available at the national level, the
compilation of aggregates covering the
euro area will raise questions of
harmonisation and consolidation. The
statistical requirements will have to be
met by participating Member States in
time for the start of Stage Three on 1
January 1999; some data, which should be
as harmonised as possible, will be needed
well in advance of the start of Stage Three.

Payment systems
In the field of payment systems, the EMI’s
“First progress report on the TARGET
(Trans-European Automated Real-time
Gross settlement Express Transfer)
project”, which was released in August
1996, provided additional information on
the organisational features of the system.
To avoid impediments to the efficient
conduct of the single monetary policy, a
certain degree of harmonisation of the
features of the national RTGS (Real-Time
Gross Settlement) systems within the euro
area will be ensured with respect to the
provision of intraday liquidity, operating
time and pricing policy. As part of the
work to establish instruments and
procedures for the single monetary policy
and to ensure the smooth functioning of
payment systems in Stage Three, the EMI
assessed the adequacy of securities
settlement systems and of their linkages
with payment systems. The main

conclusions are contained in the EMI’s
report entitled “EU securities settlement
systems – Issues related to Stage Three of
EMU”, released in February 1997.

Preparation of euro banknotes
The EMI launched a euro banknote design
competition in February 1996 which ran
until mid-September. In December the
EMI Council selected one of ten shortlisted
design series, taking into account in
particular the advice of an international
jury comprising renowned experts in
marketing, design and art history and the
results of a public consultation exercise
carried out in fourteen Member States.
The President of the EMI informed the
European Council at its December meeting
in Dublin of the EMI Council’s selection.
The EMI is currently carrying out the work
of developing the design sketches into the
final designs. This includes working with
the designer to facilitate the banknote
production and to ensure that all
requirements are met, for example the
avoidance of national bias and the
incorporation of security features.
Thereafter, further preparations will be
undertaken with respect to the production
process, including the preparation of
printing plates.

Accounting issues
In 1996 the EMI Council approved the
accounting principles for the financial
reporting of the ESCB. Application of
these accounting principles will be
mandatory for all items material to the
operations of the ESCB, for all items of
the ECB’s financial statements, and for the
calculation of monetary income.
Nevertheless, NCBs might continue to
draw up and publish their financial
statements according to their own
accounting rules. Work is under way to
develop the necessary techniques so that

7

individual NCBs and the ECB can adapt
their accounting procedures and systems
to comply with the chosen accounting
principles, and the ESCB’s reporting
framework is to be elaborated upon.
Work is also in progress on the
development of an appropriate method
for the determination of the income arising
from the performance of the ESCB’s
monetary policy function.

Information and communications systems
In the field of information and
communications systems, the EMI Council
approved a technical solution for providing
secure high-capacity teleconference services
for the ESCB, and has been investigating the
best way of extending the teleconference
system beyond the ESCB, in particular to
the non-EU central banks participating in
the “Concertation Group”. Agreement has
also been reached on the main choices for
the communications infrastructure linking
the ECB with the NCBs, the specifications
of which are being elaborated. The
infrastructure is planned to be put in place
towards the end of 1997 in order to allow
testing to commence shortly thereafter.
On the applications side, specification work
reached a stage that should allow
development of the necessary information
systems support for the conduct of
decentralised monetary policy open market
operations, as well as to enable the
monitoring of decentralised monetary policy
interventions based on bilateral procedures
and of foreign exchange interventions to be
carried out from the start of Stage Three.

Banking supervision
Prudential supervision in Stage Three will
remain a competence of the national
authorities and the supervisory framework
laid down at the EU level will not be
altered. The preparatory work of the EMI
in this field aims to identify the possible

8

ways in which Article 105 (5) of the
Treaty and Article 25 (1) of the ESCB/
ECB Statute could be implemented as
well as to make a preliminary assessment
of how the ECB could define its position
in respect of the provision under
Article 105 (6) of the Treaty.

Legal issues
In the legal field, in June 1996 the EMI
transmitted to the Commission elements
for secondary legislation governing the
introduction of the euro. Commission
proposals for two EU Council Regulations
were endorsed in principle by the European
Council in December 1996. One Council
Regulation deals, inter alia, with the oneto-one replacement of the ECU (European
Currency Unit) by the euro, the continuity
of contracts and technical rules for the
conversion rates, including rounding. The
second addresses matters such as the
substitution of the euro for the currencies
of the participating Member States,
transitional provisions with respect to the
national currency units and the issue of
banknotes and coins. The EMI also
formulated recommendations for
secondary Community legislation relating
to statistical information, minimum
reserves and sanctions, and developed a
list of features of central bank
independence to help guide national
legislators when adapting their respective
NCB’s statute. The EMI identified certain
provisions in the statutes of NCBs which it
considered to be incompatible with Treaty
and ESCB/ECB Statute requirements on
central bank independence and which, in
its view, needed to be adapted. Further
adaptations of national legislation which
may be required in preparation for Stage
Three, particularly with regard to the
integration of NCBs in the ESCB and
legislation other than the statutes of NCBs,
are under consideration and the EMI will
refer to this issue in future reports.

Changeover to the euro
The EMI has continued to monitor progress
in the preparatory work for the
introduction of the euro, following the
adoption of the changeover scenario by
the European Council at its meeting in
Madrid in December 1995. The EMI
provides a forum for the exchange of
information between central banks on
four main topics: NCBs’ internal
preparatory work for the establishment of
the ESCB; changeover preparations by
financial market participants; euro-related
activities performed by the public

authorities; and the provision of
information on the changeover to the
general public. Taking into account the
national specificities in financial markets
and banking structures, the NCBs constitute
the main channel of dialogue regarding the
latter three areas between the monetary
authorities and financial market
participants. Furthermore, there is an
ongoing exchange of views between the
EMI, in co-operation with the NCBs, and
the banking and financial community to
assess the need for co-ordination at the
EU level concerning the process of the
changeover to the single currency.

3 Other tasks of the EMI
Central bank co-operation in the field of
payment systems
The EMI has continued to facilitate cooperation between the EU central banks
in three major areas of payment systems:
remote access; standardisation; and
electronic money. These issues are analysed
in the EMI’s report on “Developments in
EU payment systems in 1996”, also due to
be released in April 1997.

Oversight of the ECU Clearing and
Settlement System
The EMI’s main focus has been to ensure
that adequate action is taken to improve
the System’s compliance with the safety
standards laid down in the 1990 G-10
Report on Interbank Netting Schemes. In
this respect, the most important reforms
implemented in 1996 were the
establishment of a system of binding
intraday limits on the multilateral net
position which a participant is allowed to
incur at any moment during the clearing
process and the revision of membership

and exit criteria. The EBA (ECU Banking
Association) has requested advice from
external legal counsel to develop a legal
structure which would provide the System
with a sound and enforceable legal basis
and which would also be suitable for Stage
Three. The EBA also started discussions
with the EMI on issues related to the
settlement of the System via TARGET in
Stage Three.

Co-operation in the field of banking
supervision
Consultations among banking supervisory
authorities focused on three topics. First,
the issue of credit institutions’ internal
control systems was analysed in depth
with the aim of identifying elements which
could assist banking supervisors and other
interested parties in assessing the features
and effectiveness of these systems. Second,
an analysis of the methods used by EU
banking supervisors to detect, at an early
stage, financially fragile credit institutions
showed that there are no fundamental
differences in the basic approach to early

9

warning methods. Third, co-operation
among the central credit registers currently
existing in seven Member States continued
with the main objective of opening up the
registers on a cross-border basis in order
to grant reporting institutions access to
the data stored in them.

Administration of EMS mechanisms and
Community loans
Since both Finland and Italy had already
been participating in the swap mechanism
on a voluntary basis, the Finnish markka’s
entry and the Italian lira’s resumed
participation in the ERM during the autumn
had no impact on the EMI’s ECU swap
operations. In 1996 the EMI continued to
receive from borrowers, namely Greece
and Italy, and to pay to creditors vis-à-vis
the Community the sums due in respect
of capital, interest, commission and
expenses on outstanding loans.

Advisory functions
Article 109f (6) of the Treaty and Article
5.3 of the EMI Statute require that the
EMI be consulted by the Council of the
European Union or the responsible national
authorities, as appropriate, on any
proposed Community or national legislation
within its field of competence. Sixteen
requests for consultations were received
in 1996. Six came from the Council of the
European Union, three were received from

10

the European Commission and seven
originated from national authorities.

Monitoring of compliance with the prohibition
on monetary financing and on privileged
access
The EMI’s regular monitoring procedure
suggested that the Treaty requirements
continued to be respected by the EU
central banks. Remaining imperfections
which had appeared in the transition to
the new arrangements, as well as technical
problems which had occurred in the
implementation of new regulations, were
finally corrected in the course of 1996 and
at the beginning of 1997.

Co-operation with other institutions
The EMI has continued to co-operate
closely with other bodies of the European
Union in a number of forms and at a
number of levels. With regard to contacts
with institutions outside the Community,
the “concertation procedure” has remained
a valuable forum for exchanging data among
central bank foreign exchange experts.
Working relationships have also been
retained with the Bank for International
Settlements, the IMF and the World Bank.
The EMI has also established relationships
with the central banks of the associated
Central and Eastern European countries
(CEECs) and other applicant countries.

Chapter I

Economic, monetary and
financial conditions in the
European Union

1 Economic and financial background in 1996
1.1 Major developments outside the
EU
Favourable external climate
Global economic developments were
broadly favourable in 1996. According to
the latest data available from international
organisations, real GDP in countries outside
the EU is estimated to have expanded by
just over 4%, compared with around 3½%
in 1995. Inflationary pressures in
industrialised countries remained subdued;
a rise in oil prices was partly compensated
by a slight decline in non-oil commodity
prices. World import growth decelerated
somewhat from the rate of 11% seen in
1995, but remained rather buoyant at 8%
(see also Box 1).
In the United States GDP growth in 1996
was robust (see Chart 1), owing largely to
buoyant private consumption, while
unemployment reached a historical low of
slightly above 5%. At the same time, CPI
inflation remained at 3%. In Japan GDP
growth was rapid in the first half of the
year, but the pace of recovery slowed
thereafter. CPI inflation in Japan was virtually
zero, and there were no signs of inflationary
pressures. Growth was also positive in
most other industrialised countries outside
the Union. An exception was Switzerland,
where output declined as a consequence
of the sharp appreciation of the Swiss
franc.
In the South-East Asian economies GDP
growth continued to be rapid: at around
7½% it was only slightly lower than in
1995. In Central and Eastern European
countries (CEECs) developments differed.
While several countries continued to
experience rapid growth rates (in particular
Poland, the Czech Republic and the Slovak
Republic), activity increased more modestly
in others and declined in Bulgaria. Average

14

growth in all CEECs is estimated to have
been just below 4%. In contrast, the
Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) experienced a further decline in
output of around 1%. Growth in countries
in Latin America was over 3% and in Africa
around 4½%.

Global bond markets adjust to changing
expectations
Bond yield movements in major
international markets largely reflected
expectations about underlying economic
developments. Yields on 10-year US bonds
rose from 5.6% at the end of 1995 to a
peak of 7.1% in July, due inter alia to a
concern that inflationary tensions might
shortly increase. The buoyant growth of
US employment was particularly influential
in this regard. However, this rise in yields
turned out to be only temporary as it
became evident that inflationary pressures
in the United States remained subdued,
and yields declined gradually to stand at
6.4% at year-end. In Japan both shortterm and long-term interest rates remained
at historically low levels during 1996. The
10-year bond yield rose from 2.9% at the
end of 1995 to 3.4% at end-February as
the recovery gathered pace. Thereafter,
yields fluctuated around 3.3% until endJuly and then declined gradually to 2.6% at
year-end as the Japanese economic recovery
faltered and interest rate expectations
were revised downwards accordingly.

Relatively calm foreign exchange markets
During 1996 global exchange rate
developments were characterised by a
recovery of the US dollar, while the average
day-to-day volatility of the US dollar/
Deutsche Mark exchange rate was very
low by historical standards. Against the

Deutsche Mark, the US dollar appreciated
from DEM 1.43 in early January to a high
of DEM 1.55 in late May, before falling at
end-July to a level of around DEM 1.48
and recovering later in the year. At the
end of 1996 the dollar stood at
DEM 1.55, i.e. 8.4% above the end-1995
level. The US dollar also recovered vis-àvis the Japanese yen, rising from JPY 105 at
the beginning of the year to JPY 116 at
year-end, 10.5% above the end-1995 level.
An underlying reason for the dollar’s
appreciation was market expectations of a

widening of positive short-term interest
rate differentials vis-à-vis the Deutsche
Mark and the Japanese yen.
Changes in nominal effective exchange
rates of the three currencies were less
pronounced than changes in their bilateral
rates. During the year the nominal effective
exchange rate of the US dollar against
twenty-six trading partners appreciated
by 4%, whereas that of the Japanese yen
depreciated by 9% and that of the
Deutsche Mark by 4%.

Box 1

Trends in the geographical allocation of EU exports of goods
International trade is a key channel for the transmission of real economic impulses, and consequently its
geographical distribution determines the benefit the EU may expect to gain from patterns of growth in the
rest of the world. In this context, the chart below shows the geographical allocation of EU exports in value
terms in 1985 and 1995 - the most recent date for which comprehensive figures are available. In general it
should be noted that the geographical distribution of exports should be interpreted with caution as it may
also change over time due to changes in real exchange rates.
According to the IMF Direction of Trade Statistics, total exports of goods of the fifteen Member States
in 1995 are estimated to be valued at around USD 1,900 billion, representing 23% of EU-15 GDP. ExtraEU exports amounting to 38% of total EU exports or 9% of EU-15 GDP were distributed between the
United States (18%); Japan (6%); other Asian countries (excluding Japan, including China) (19%); other
non-European OECD countries (5%); non-EU western European countries (mainly Norway and Switzerland)
(15%); Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) and the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) (14%); and the “rest of the world” (23%) (see chart below).
Compared with 1985 the proportion of extra-EU exports directed to the United States, other nonEuropean OECD countries and the “rest of the world” has declined. In contrast, the proportion of extraEU exports to Japan and other Asian countries increased by 3 and 9 percentage points respectively. Over
the period considered, both high real GDP growth and increased openness in other Asian countries have
in themselves contributed to high world trade growth as well as to the increased importance of this area as
a market for the EU. For example, its GDP is estimated to have grown by 109%, or almost 8% a year on
average between 1985 and 1995, compared with a world-wide average of 40%, or just over 3% annually.
The openness of other Asian countries also increased substantially, whereas elsewhere openness, on
average, remained broadly unchanged.
Although the EU is a relatively closed area (i.e. extra-EU exports are a relatively small percentage of
GDP), it nevertheless benefits in terms of exports from the growth of dynamic markets elsewhere in the
world. In this respect, over the period 1985-95, the EU-15 total share in world trade (measured by the
share of imports supplied by EU countries in total world imports, in value terms) declined slightly from
38% to 37%, whereas its extra-EU share declined from just under 16% in 1985 to around 14% in 1995,
partly offset by an increase in the intra-EU trade share. The EU increased its share of Japanese imports

16

(from 8% in 1985 to 14% in 1995), of imports by non-EU western European countries (from 40% to 70%)
and of imports by the CEECs and CIS (from 36% to 51%). It maintained its share of imports by other
Asian countries (15%) and of the “rest of the world” (around 42%), while its share of imports by the
United States declined (from 22% to 18%) as did that by other non-European OECD countries (from 16%
to 13%).

1.2 Macroeconomic developments in
the EU
Resumption of GDP growth during the year
Although the slowdown in the EU which
began in late 1995 continued into early
1996, a moderate recovery got under way
from the second quarter onwards. In
some countries growth may have been
weaker in the fourth quarter, but this is
not to be seen as a reversal of the
underlying trend. The resumption of
growth in the course of the year was not,
however, sufficient to offset the effects of
the slowdown on average growth in 1996.
Consequently, real GDP growth in the EU
is estimated to have been around 1.7% in

1996 as a whole, i.e. markedly lower than
its 1995 level of 2.5%. This general pattern
of lower average growth in 1996 was
reflected in most EU countries. Only
Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal
recorded higher growth in 1996 than in
1995. Although Ireland showed lower
growth in 1996, at just above 7% the rate
nevertheless remained well above that of
the EU average (see Table 1).
The factors underlying the recovery
included a reversal of previous
developments which had dampened
activity in the second half of 1995. In
particular, the process of inventory
adjustment was gradually completed in
most countries, economic expansion in

North America accelerated and exchange
rates within the EU reverted smoothly
towards the patterns prevailing prior to
the turbulence of 1995. Moreover,
inflationary prospects allowed an easing of
monetary conditions and bond yields
declined further. Reflecting these
developments, industrial confidence started
to recover in most Member States after
having fallen sharply during 1995 and early
1996. On the other hand, improvements
in consumer confidence were more limited
and were restricted to a smaller number
of EU countries.

18

Private consumption relatively resilient,
investment growth more subdued
Slower growth in 1996 for the EU as a
whole almost entirely reflected a more
subdued growth rate of domestic demand
than in 1995, especially in the case of fixed
investment (see Table 2). The contribution
of net exports remained small.
Nevertheless, during the course of the
year, domestic demand growth and net
exports gradually improved in most EU
countries. The main exception was Italy,
where the expectation of further fiscal
consolidation and the appreciation of the
lira continued to dampen consumption
and net exports respectively.

Low growth of real household disposable
income, the effects on consumer
confidence of the persistence of high, and
in a number of countries rising,
unemployment, as well as the uncertainties
with respect to the scope and speed of
fiscal consolidation, appear to have been
among the main factors restraining the
growth of private consumption.
Nevertheless, over the year as a whole,
private consumption strengthened
modestly across the Union to reach an
average growth rate of around 1.9%, similar
to the increase in 1995. Consumption
grew at rates well above the EU average in
Denmark, Greece, France, Ireland, the

Netherlands, Portugal, Finland and the
United Kingdom.
Government consumption increased in
1996 by around 1.2% in the Union as a
whole, a rate close to that observed in
1995; this subdued growth rate reflected
the efforts of fiscal authorities to restrain
spending in the light of the need for fiscal
consolidation (see Section 1.4). Growth
was negative in Italy and Sweden, while in
Germany and Finland general government
consumption rose by almost 3%.
A key element in the weaker average
performance of growth in 1996 was the

subdued increase in fixed investment,
which amounted to only 1.7% for the EU
as a whole, despite widespread and sizable
reductions in long-term interest rates. In
this respect, a durable pattern of growth,
particularly one associated with an
acceleration of investment across the
Union, had not yet been clearly established
by the end of 1996. However, there was
also considerable variation across Member
States; investment rose more strongly than
in 1995 in Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal
and the United Kingdom. In these countries
more favourable expectations of growth
and relatively high capacity utilisation rates
were important underlying factors. In other
EU countries investment rose more slowly
than in the previous year; it actually declined
in Germany and France. In France this
appeared to be largely related to subdued

growth expectations, while in Germany
the end of the housing boom and
uncertainties related to the fiscal and
structural adjustment process seem to
have played a role.
Export growth of EU countries in 1996
was 4.3% on average and on a year-onyear basis, considerably lower than in
1995. This reflected weaker growth in
demand from major trading partners within
the Union, offsetting the favourable impact
of external demand (see also Section 1.1
above). The rise in imports amounted, on
average, to around 3.0%. European
Commission figures suggest that the EU
current account balance, which was already
in surplus in 1995, increased slightly in
1996 (see Table 3).

There were improvements in current

in several Member States. In Italy and the
Netherlands there were significant
increases in the already sizable surpluses.
Current account deficits increased in 1996
in Greece and Portugal in particular.

of the recession in the early 1990s was a
key explanatory factor in the poor labour
market performance. Of course, in all
cases employment developments should
also be seen against the background of
differences in levels and changes in
participation rates across Member States.

Little progress in employment generation

Unemployment in the EU remained at a high
level

For the EU as a whole, real GDP growth
since the 1992-93 recession has in general
been accompanied by negligible job
creation. While accumulated GDP growth
over the past three years was around 7%,
employment growth was virtually zero.
Chart 2 puts developments in 1996 in a
medium-term perspective by highlighting
the patterns of net job creation in EU
countries over the period since 1985. It
suggests that there was no employment
growth in the EU as a whole in 1996, and
growth of only around 5% over the period
1985-96 (whereas GDP expanded by
25%). In five Member States (Belgium,
Germany, Greece, France and the United
Kingdom) employment and GDP growth
were close to the EU average since 1985
(although the pattern over time and the
relative contribution of the public and
private sectors differed). Employment
growth appears to have been particularly
strong over the period in Ireland,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands. In each
case this may be linked to sustained wage
moderation. Greater labour market
flexibility may also have played a role,
particularly in the case of the Netherlands,
while in Ireland and Luxembourg the strong
growth in output was clearly a major
factor. Employment growth was also above
the EU average in Spain, Austria and
Portugal. In the remaining countries,
notably in Finland and, to a lesser degree,
Sweden, as well as in Denmark and Italy,
employment growth was significantly
below the EU average. In Finland and
Sweden, in particular, the unusual severity

22

In line with weak employment and GDP
growth, the unemployment rate in the EU
has not fallen significantly since the 199293 recession. In the light of longer-term
trends, it is clear that the bulk of EU
unemployment is of a structural rather
than a cyclical nature. Consequently, while
some increase in employment can be
expected as a result of further GDP
growth, a reduction in structural rigidities
in labour (and product) markets is a sine
qua non for the alleviation of the
unemployment problem in the EU (see
Box 2).
Focusing on 1996, and measured on the
basis of national data, the unemployment
rate for the EU as a whole fell slightly
during mid-1996, but rose to just over
11% towards the end of the year. While
the overall unemployment rate at yearend was thus far from satisfactory, the
outturns for individual Member States
differed considerably. In Luxembourg and
Austria the unemployment rate remained
below 5%, while in Germany, France,
Ireland, Italy and Finland it was higher than
10%, and in Spain, despite declines in
recent years, it remained above 20%.
During 1996 further progress in reducing
unemployment rates was recorded in
several countries, especially in Denmark
and the United Kingdom but also, albeit to
a lesser degree, in Belgium, Spain, Ireland,
the Netherlands and Finland. In the
remaining Member States unemployment
was either unchanged or rose slightly (see
Chart 3).

Box 2

Labour market rigidities in EU Member States
Long-term macroeconomic developments in the EU as a whole indicate that a rather weak relationship
prevails between GDP growth, employment and unemployment. This is illustrated in the table below,
which shows developments in these EU aggregates from 1960 onwards over various sub-periods, on the
basis of European Commission figures. The bulk of unemployment is evidently structural and not cyclical.
Since the 1970s, there has been a clear and unbroken trend rise in EU unemployment. In effect, while GDP
growth and employment growth were positively related to one another, the link was not strong enough to
avoid a trend rise in unemployment given the rise in the number of people seeking employment over this
period. If such past relationships continue to hold, the implication is that stronger GDP growth in 1997
and beyond will alone not be sufficient to bring about a sustained reduction in unemployment. In addition
to continued wage moderation, reductions in labour (and product) market rigidities are a sine qua non for
the alleviation of the unemployment problem in the EU. These should include a reduction of the disincentives
created by the structure of social security contributions, taxes and transfer payments. This is all the more
important as globalisation has increased competition dramatically. Such policies should also support
monetary policies geared towards price stability.

(a) As a percentage of the labour force.

First steps have been taken in many Member States to reduce labour market rigidities in recent years. Since
the mid-1980s, replacement ratios for unemployment benef its have fallen in Germany, Spain, Ireland,
Austria, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Benef it duration has been reduced in Belgium, France,
the Netherlands, Finland and the United Kingdom. There has been a relaxation of minimum wage regulations
in a number of Member States (Belgium, France, Greece, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom);
in two countries (Greece and the Netherlands) the indexation of minimum wages has been abolished, while
in Belgium it has been tempered, inter alia through the introduction of a so-called “health index”. In the
United Kingdom, Wage Councils, which set minimum wage levels in a number of industries, have been
abolished, with the exception of agriculture. In Italy, wage indexation was abolished in the context of a
general reform of the bargaining system. Employment protection regulations have also changed in a number
of Member States; the costs and/or administrative burden of dismissal have been reduced in Germany,
France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Finally, employers’ social security contributions
and payroll taxes have fallen as a percentage of GDP since 1985 in Denmark, France, Ireland, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom, although in many cases they remain at very high levels.
The overall incidence of non-wage labour costs has risen or remained broadly unchanged in other EU
countries. In sum, however, as is clear from the development of labour market conditions, measures to date
have generally been inadequate. Further progress remains an urgent necessity in order to revive labour
markets and to reverse the pattern of low employment growth and increasing unemployment rates.

1.3 Price developments
Favourable price climate in most Member
States
In this section price developments are
analysed with reference to national
consumer price indices, as these are still
the main focus of individual countries’
policies. However, when the Report
addresses the issue of convergence in
Section 3, reference is made to harmonised
data, which do not yet provide a
comprehensive measure of domestic
inflation, but are more comparable than
current national indices and thus provide a
more uniform basis for assessing
convergence. Accordingly, inflation rates
for 1995 based on Interim Indices of
Consumer Prices (IICPs) as well as the
inflation rates resulting from newly
generated Harmonised Indices of
Consumer Prices (HICPs) for 1996 are
reported in Table 9. Details of the progress
towards the generation of HICPs are
described in Box 7.

downward trend in inflation continued,
but at a slow pace, so that inflation still
stood at 8.5% in 1996.
Annual average rates of inflation conceal
some more divergent within-year patterns,
as in a number of countries a degree of
upward pressure was seen in inflation
rates over the course of the year although
inflation remained at modest levels (see
Chart 4). Meanwhile, Sweden and Italy
showed the steepest declining trends, with
inflation falling at the end of the year to
below zero in Sweden and to 2.6% in Italy.
A somewhat more moderate reduction
took place in Spain, where inflation
diminished to 3.2% at the end of the year.
In Portugal, inflation fluctuated around a
slightly downward trend, to stand at 3.3%
at year-end. The deceleration of Greek
inflation which has been observed in recent
years was temporarily interrupted in the
early part of 1996 but resumed thereafter,
and inflation reached 7.5% in December.

Supporting underlying factors
According to national consumer price
indices, inflation in the EU as a whole fell
to an average of 2.6% in 1996 (see Table 4).
This compares favourably with the rate of
3.1% observed in 1995 and is also a major
achievement in a historical context (see
Box 3). Belgium, Denmark, Germany,
France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Austria and Finland, which had inflation
rates of close to or below 2% in 1995,
broadly remained at that level in 1996. In
Ireland and Sweden annual average inflation
was reduced to below 2% from 2.5% or
above in 1995. Among the remaining
countries, annual average inflation in Spain
and Portugal was reduced to 3.6% and
3.1% respectively, in both cases well below
the level of 4.7% and 4.1% prevailing in
1995. Similarly, in Italy inflation fell from
5.4% in 1995 to 3.9% in 1996. Inflation
(excluding mortgage interest payments) in
the United Kingdom was unchanged at just
under 3% in 1996. In Greece the

Although in the long term inflation is a
monetary phenomenon, in the short run
developments in consumer prices are
affected by several cost and demand factors,
as discussed below.
Growth in import prices slowed in the
Union as a whole from 4.1% in 1995 to
1.1% in 1996 (see Table 4). This favourable
pattern was mirrored in most Member
States, and prevailed despite a sharp
increase in commodity prices in late 1995
and early 1996. The dynamics of import
prices benefited in a number of Member
States from the appreciation of effective
exchange rates. Among ERM countries
import price growth remained low or
negative in Denmark, Germany, France,
Luxembourg, Austria and Portugal; in Spain
and Ireland increases slowed significantly
from 4% or above in 1995 to 2.1% and
1.3% in 1996 respectively, while in Italy

after rising by 11.8% in 1995. In contrast,
an upward movement, although still at a
modest level, was seen in Belgium and the
Netherlands, as well as in Finland. Outside
the ERM effective appreciations of the

respective currencies during 1996 led to a
significant reduction in import prices in
Sweden and considerably lower increases
in the United Kingdom. A similar pattern,
albeit at a higher level, was found in Greek
import price inflation, which decelerated

moderation did not feed through one-toone to unit labour costs.

For the Union as a whole, domestic
inflationary pressures (measured by the
increase in the GDP deflator) declined
from 2.9% in 1995 to 2.4% in 1996. In the
majority of Member States inflation
according to the GDP deflator was low,
standing close to or below 2%. Domestic
inflation decelerated in 1996 in Spain and
Portugal to 3.3% and 2.8% respectively. In
Italy inflation by this measure was 5.0%; in
Greece it was 8.8%.

Changes in indirect taxes contributed to
increases in prices in most Member States
in 1996, including Belgium, Denmark, Spain,
the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the
United Kingdom. The strongest impact of
changes in indirect taxes was seen in
Greece, where they raised consumer prices
by almost 1 percentage point. In 1996
inflation slowed in both the sheltered and
non-sheltered (or “non-traded” and
“traded”) sectors of most EU economies,
but disinflation was more pronounced in
traditionally sheltered sectors; hence the
gap in inflation between the sectors
narrowed in 1996.

Although unit labour cost growth rose
somewhat in the EU on average, it still
remained rather subdued, at an average of
2.1% in 1996. Indeed, in many EU countries
low unit labour cost growth was an
important factor underlying the low growth
in domestic costs. However, there were
also contrasting developments as unit labour
costs accelerated somewhat in Denmark,
Spain and Portugal and were buoyant in
Greece, Italy and Sweden (see Table 4). In
some of these countries (particularly those
where significant gains in price competitiveness had been recorded in 1993-95),
the increase in unit labour costs was at least
partly absorbed by profit margins.
In 1996 as a whole average wage growth
in the Union was 3.5%, compared with
3.6% in 1995. In line with the pattern
typical of a pause in economic growth, a
fall in productivity growth took place in
the EU, declining from an average of 2.0%
in 1995 to 1.4% in 1996. This helps to
explain why the general pattern of wage

Overall, there are some indications that
inflation expectations are gradually adapting
to the current environment of low
inflationary pressures. A crucial role has
been played by an increased emphasis
placed on medium-term-oriented
monetary policies geared towards the
achievement and maintenance of price
stability. Moreover, the favourable price
climate was supported by increased
competition, both domestically as a result
of privatisation or deregulation and
internationally, partly related to European
integration and, in some countries, to the
effects of the opening-up of eastern
Europe. In 1996 the reduction in inflation
rates was also supported by slow growth
in import prices and weaker domestic
inflationary pressures, the latter linked to
weak demand and low increases in unit
labour costs in most Member States.

Box 3

Progress towards price stability in EU Member States
Average consumer price inflation in the European Union as a whole stood at 2.6% in 1996. Compared with
past experience this represents progress towards price stability.
Some marked differences are apparent in the inflation records of individual EU countries over a long period.
Over the whole period since 1960 inflation has been lowest in Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Austria and Belgium (see table below). The highest inflation rates have been observed in Portugal, Greece,
Spain and Italy.

28

The ranking of volatility, measured by means of standard deviations of inflation rates, is more or less in
line with the ranking of mean inflation rates: it was lowest for low-inflation countries such as Germany,
Austria, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium, and highest for Portugal, Greece, Italy and Ireland,
where the rise and subsequent fall of inflation rates were more pronounced.
It is evident that inflation has undergone a number of regime shifts over the past three decades. The first
“break point”, in 1972/1973, marks the first oil shock and the end of the system of fixed exchange rates
under the Bretton Woods regime. The second break point, in 1987/1988, coincides with the fall in oil
prices and the start of a period of stable ERM exchange rates. This justifies focusing on three sub-periods,
namely 1961-72, 1973-87 and 1988-96. Over the first sub-period, 1961-72, inflation rates were 4.6% on
average. In contrast, in the period 1973-87, mean inflation rates were much higher, standing on average
close to 10%, and, in addition, were more volatile. In the last sub-period, 1988-96, mean inflation rates fell
strongly in all countries, reaching an EU-wide average of slightly above 4%. The strongest declines in
inflation have tended to occur in the countries which had the highest inflation over the whole period.
Furthermore, volatility declined in the majority of Member States and the standard deviation of EU-15
inflation was low compared with earlier periods.
Convergence in inflation may also be analysed using EU countries’ inflation rate differentials with Germany,
the country with the lowest inflation rate over the whole period. Inflation rate differentials with Germany
have been positive for all countries over all periods considered, apart from Greece during the period 196172, and Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria in the period 198896. Using weighted averages, other EU-15 countries’ differentials with Germany were 4% during the
whole period 1961-96. In the sub-periods they were around 1.5% during the period 1961-72, just below
7.5% in the period 1973-87 and 1.5% during the period 1988-96. Hence convergence with German
inflation rates during the most recent period has brought the average differential back to that prevailing
prior to the first oil price shock.
On balance, the convergence of inflation rates is marked if 1988-96 is compared with the high-inflation
years of 1973-87; inflation has fallen sharply, especially in countries with the highest inflation. However,
achievements in the convergence of inflation rates are not exceptional if 1988-96 is compared with the
former “low”-inflation period spanning from 1961 to 1972.

1.4 Fiscal developments
Enhanced efforts at fiscal consolidation
In the context of persistently high general
government deficit and debt ratios in
most Member States, the stance of fiscal
policy in 1996 continued to be directed
towards the need for consolidation.
Consolidation was supported by improving
economic conditions in the course of the
year. The data commented on below are
the official data from the European
Commission as presented in its autumn
1996 forecast and shown in Table 5.
However, these data rely on incomplete
information about the year 1996 and are
due to be updated in the spring, i.e. after
the publication of this Report. Therefore,
the latest available national data, which are
nevertheless still of a preliminary nature,
are also shown for information in Table 6.
These more recent estimates of
government deficits and debts are broadly
in line with the Commission’s November
forecast. For Belgium, Denmark, France
and Italy they suggest slightly higher deficit
figures than estimated by the Commission
in November. Germany, Greece, Ireland,
the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden
and the United Kingdom are expected to
have lower deficits, with the most
significant downward revision being in the
case of Sweden. Higher debt ratios than
were expected earlier are foreseen in
Greece, Spain, Italy and Sweden, whereas
other countries for which data are available
now estimate lower debt ratios. The most
considerable revisions are for Spain,
Ireland, Austria and Finland.
In the EU as a whole fiscal deficits have
continued to decline since their peak in
1993 (see Table 5). Nevertheless, the
average general government deficit-to-GDP
ratio in 1996 was still expected to stand
well above 4%, thus remaining a matter of
serious policy concern. The performance of
individual countries was more similar in
1996 than in the past, as the general

30

government deficit ratio appears to have
declined in all countries except Germany.
The biggest deficit reduction, of more than
4 percentage points, was observed in
Sweden (where the estimated deficit stands
more than 8 percentage points below its
1993 level). According to Commission
estimates, budgetary improvements in the
EU were at least partly based on reductions
in structural deficits; Ireland was the main
exception.
The average debt ratio in the EU has
increased steadily from below 60% in 1991
to well above 70% in 1996 (see Table 5).
Some individual countries have nonetheless
managed to reduce their debt ratios in
recent years. Denmark and Ireland have
recorded falling debt ratios since 1993 and
this was also the case for Belgium, although
its general government debt ratio remains
the highest in the Union. In 1995 and 1996
there were successive reductions in the debt
ratio of Sweden and in the still very high
ratio of Italy. In 1996 some reduction in
debt ratios was also seen in the Netherlands
and Portugal; a decline was also expected in
the very high ratio prevailing in Greece.

Structure of consolidation less favourable
Whereas the momentum towards lower
deficits continued in 1996, the composition
of fiscal consolidation was a ground for
concern from the perspective of the
sustainability of developments in
government expenditure and revenue (see
Box 4). This becomes apparent from
recent trends in expenditure and revenue
growth. As regards performance during
the early 1990s, highlighted by EU-wide
developments, it can be seen from Chart 5
that the increase in deficit ratios until
1993 was accompanied by rises both in
receipts and in expenditures as a percentage
of GDP. More recently, in 1994-95, some
correction took place, which was reflected
in falling deficit ratios mainly driven by
expenditure restraint. In 1996, however,

the momentum shifted away from cuts in
expenditure and towards increases in
revenues.
Commission estimates suggest that in 1996
only three Member States reduced their

deficit ratios via lower expenditure ratios
while at the same time being able to
lower their revenue ratios: namely Ireland,
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
In Belgium, Greece, Spain, Austria, Finland
and Sweden deficit reduction was partly

based on expenditure restraint and partly
on higher revenue ratios. Denmark, France,
Italy and Portugal are expected to have
higher expenditure ratios in 1996, and
deficit ratios are only expected to decline
as a consequence of larger, albeit at times
temporary, increases in government
receipts.

Within total government receipts, the EU
average share of social security
contributions increased particularly strongly
during the 1990-93 period and could not
be brought down from this high level
thereafter (see Chart 5). At the country
level, social security contributions as a
share of GDP have declined since 1990
only in Ireland and Sweden. However, for

Trends in fiscal expenditure and revenue ratios and the issue of sustainability
The broad tendency for government expenditure and revenue ratios to increase since the early 1990s reflects a
continuation of past trends. Although there are important differences across countries, the average expenditure
ratio in the EU increased from 37% in 1970 to more than 50% in 1996, even faster than the average share of
government receipts in GDP, which increased from 37% to 46% (see chart below). Hence, a growing proportion
of economic resources in the EU has been absorbed by government activity.

An implication of government spending permanently growing faster than output is that either revenue or deficit
ratios have to adjust upwards. In both cases, however, private activity may be crowded out, thus damaging longterm growth prospects. Also, looking at the composition of government expenditure, a growing part of government
outlays is used for interest payments, adversely affecting the flexibility of fiscal policies in the short and medium
term. Interest payments on government debt as a percentage of GDP in the EU increased from below 2% in 1970
to above 5% in 1996; the share of interest payments in total government expenditures doubled during the same
period. In most years since 1984 interest payments required more financial resources than were generated by
government net borrowing (see chart below).
Whereas such trends in government finances can hardly be judged as sustainable in the longer term, a more
precise analytical approach is needed to assess sustainability in a comprehensive manner. In this context, it is
suggested that material for an assessment of sustainability can be derived from various analytical procedures
which focus on budgetary balance requirements over different time horizons. Suggestions can also be made
concerning the appropriate balance between expenditure cuts and revenue increases in the achievement of
consolidation.
A short-term indication of the sustainability of fiscal consolidation strategies can be obtained by distinguishing
between measures with permanent or only short-term effects on trends in revenues and expenditures. Shortterm or one-off measures, which are only effective in one year, improve the current budgetary situation at the
expense of future budgets, or have mere presentational effects, cannot be regarded as contributing to sustainability.

In the medium term the feasibility of given budgetary objectives may be considered by estimating the fiscal
adjustments that would be necessary to reach these goals. The emphasis here is on the correction of those items
which are generally seen as being under the control of governments, i.e. the primary balance resulting from all
expenditure items, excluding interest payments, as well as revenues. For instance, the actual primary balance of
a government may be compared with the primary balance which would be required to reduce the debt-to-GDP
ratio during the current year. This concept, referred to as the “primary (or debt convergence) gap”, may be
supplemented by the calculation of the primary balance required to reduce the debt ratio to a specific value
within a given time period (see the EMI’s report on “Progress towards convergence 1996”, November 1996). In
addition, the adjustment of the expenditure and revenue figures for cyclical and non-structural effects gives an
indication of the degree to which a given deficit reduction reflects genuine fiscal consolidation efforts. However,
it should be noted that calculations of structural expenditure and revenue data differ according to the methods
applied, and figures for the level are typically less reliable than figures for year-to-year changes. Furthermore,
certain non-recurrent elements such as one-off measures may distort the estimations.
As regards long-term issues of sustainability, the budgetary situation must be judged in the light of projections
and forecasts of demographic and economic developments which are of relevance to government finances.
The state of government finances under unchanged tax and transfer policies may face severe challenges when
the expected problems of an ageing population emerge over the next few decades. A valuable concept which
is increasingly being used to capture the relation between fiscal policy and demographic changes and the intergenerational redistribution resulting from tax and benefit policies is known as “generational accounting”.
In each case, in view of the high burdens of tax and social security contributions in the EU, fiscal consolidation
should primarily be based on expenditure restraint. Higher revenue ratios would exacerbate existing distortions.
They might also be perceived by private agents as unsustainable in the long run and could thus damage
confidence, not least in financial markets. However, not all forms of expenditure reduction may be seen as
equally sustainable. For example, systematic cuts in government capital expenditure may harm longer-term
growth prospects owing to the positive growth effects of certain types of government infrastructure investment.

34

the EU as a whole, the main source of the
increase in government receipts in 1996
was taxation rather than social security
contributions.
As regards expenditures, marked increases
in government transfer payments were
seen on average in the early 1990s, whereas
growth rates were slightly negative
thereafter. Hence a pattern similar to that
for social security contributions on the
revenue side can be observed on the
expenditure side. Overall, therefore, the
financial positions of social security sectors
are imposing an increasing burden on the
budgetary situations of many EU countries,
as well as posing risks for the future in the
light of the ageing of the population.
In 1996 adjustments in fiscal positions
appear to have been related strongly to
cuts in government investment; capital
expenditures were the only category of
expenditure to be reduced in the EU on
average. While relatively “painless” in the
short run, this may run the risk of burdening
economic and budgetary positions in the
longer term. Looking at individual countries,
only Ireland has increased government
capital expenditures as a share of GDP
since 1993 while also managing to reduce
its deficit ratio. On the other hand,
particularly sizable parts of deficit
reductions since 1993 were borne by a
reduction in capital expenditure in Greece
and Spain, although their levels remain
close to and above the EU average
respectively.

1.5 Intra-EU exchange rates
Relatively calm conditions within the ERM,
greater volatility of some non-ERM
currencies
During 1996 exchange rate developments
within the ERM were characterised by
relatively calm conditions. In particular,

between the end of May and mid-October
1996, the bilateral exchange rates between
the participating currencies remained within
relatively narrow bands (see Chart 6). In
the last quarter the maximum bilateral
divergence from central rates widened, to
reach around 7-8% in December. Exchange
rate volatility among EU currencies declined
significantly compared with 1995; most
ERM currencies recorded their lowest
volatility against the Deutsche Mark since
the widening of the ERM fluctuation bands
in August 1993.
One group of currencies - the Belgian/
Luxembourg franc, the Deutsche Mark,
the Dutch guilder and the Austrian schilling
- remained closely aligned, with the
respective short and long-term interest
rate differentials, which were already small,
narrowing further. From early May onwards
the French currency alternated with the
Danish krone as the weakest currency in
the grid, while both remained relatively
close to their ERM central rates vis-à-vis
the Deutsche Mark throughout 1996. The
French franc experienced some temporary
and limited downward pressures between
mid-July and early September and, to a
lesser extent, in late November/early
December. From January until September
1996 the Spanish peseta remained relatively
stable as the strongest currency in the grid,
albeit close to the mid-point of its
fluctuation band. Thereafter, the Irish
pound, which had been the weakest
currency in the grid during the first four
months of 1996 and had subsequently
risen steadily against the other ERM
currencies, became the strongest currency
in the ERM. The Portuguese escudo
strengthened, while remaining within a
fluctuation range of ± 2% against its central
rate vis-à-vis the Deutsche Mark throughout
1996.
In 1996 two further currencies joined the
ERM: the Finnish markka with effect from
14 October, and the Italian lira on 25
November. The Finnish markka continued

Vertical lines show realignments of PTE and ESP on 6 March 1995, the entry in the ERM of FIM on 14 October 1996 and the re-entry of ITL on
25 November 1996. The position of a currency in the fluctuation band is determined by its deviation with respect to the mid-point between the

its downward movement during the first
four months of 1996, but recovered during
the summer. Its ERM entry rate of FIM
3.04 vis-à-vis the Deutsche Mark was
slightly below the market rate prevailing at
the time, and the Finnish currency
thereafter remained stronger than its
Deutsche Mark ERM parity. The Italian lira
continued its steady recovery in the first
half of 1996, breaching the ITL 1,000 level
vis-à-vis the Deutsche Mark, and fluctuated
around this level in the following months.
After resuming participation in the ERM at
a central rate vis-à-vis the Deutsche Mark
of ITL 990, which was slightly above the
market rate prevailing at the time, the
Italian currency remained slightly above it
for the remainder of 1996.
Developments in currencies not
participating in the ERM followed a broadly
common pattern until the autumn of
1996. After a phase of virtually continuous
appreciation over the first half of 1996,
non-ERM currencies lost a little ground
vis-à-vis the strongest ERM currencies during
July and August. Subsequently, the Greek
drachma recovered significantly, ending
1996 at levels close to those recorded in
mid-1996. The Swedish krona initially
recouped its losses, but depreciated in the
last months of 1996, ending the year
slightly stronger than at the start. The
pound sterling experienced stronger
upward pressure in the last four months of
the year, which brought the UK currency
to its highest level against the Deutsche
Mark for the past three years.

Favourable underlying international and
intra-EU factors
Several factors appear to have contributed
to the exchange rate developments
summarised above. The upward trend in
the US dollar, which represented a
correction of the earlier depreciation of
the US currency, coupled with lesser
volatility, contributed to exchange rate

stability within the ERM. Progress towards
convergence, combined with reiterated
expressions of strong political commitment
to the EMU process - as highlighted by the
conclusions of the Madrid, Florence and
Dublin European Councils - have gradually
raised market expectations that Stage
Three of EMU will start as scheduled (the
latter expectation was also reflected in
the ECU market, see Box 5). However, it
appears difficult to disentangle markets’
positive assessment of member countries’
overall macroeconomic performance and
the sustainability of their economic policies
from market expectations about their
potential participation in Stage Three. In
any event, substantial capital flows into
some of the former high-yielding ERM and
non-ERM currencies took place, fuelling
upward pressure on their exchange rates
and downward pressure on the respective
interest rates relative to those prevailing in
Germany. For some EU currencies
anticipation of ERM entry may also have
played a strengthening role. Furthermore,
in an environment of low inflationary
pressures in continental EU countries,
further gradual monetary easing in Germany
up to late August 1996 facilitated
substantial cuts in official interest rates in
most other EU countries.

Corrective movements in effective exchange
rates
Reflecting limited inflation differentials,
real effective exchange rate developments
during 1996 closely mirrored fluctuations
in nominal effective exchange rates (see
Chart 7). Most ERM currencies, including
the Finnish markka, depreciated in real
effective terms. 1 In contrast, the Irish
pound and the Italian lira appreciated. For
the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese

The calculation of real effective exchange rates is
based on the following deflators: consumer price
index, producer price index and unit labour costs
in the manufacturing sector.

Private ECU markets
In 1996 the private ECU banking and financial markets contracted for the fourth successive year (see table
below). The estimated total market size declined by 8.6% between end-September 1995 and end-September
1996, to stand at ECU 153.6 billion. This level is 20.5% below the peak recorded in September 1992. A
fall in the volume of outstanding international bond issues, from ECU 62.5 to 51.8 billion between endSeptember 1995 and end-September 1996, was largely responsible for the overall contraction of the
market. Repayments of maturing bonds continued to be high and in excess of new issues. Against the
background of buoyant issuing activity on international bond markets, the contraction of the international
ECU bond market brought the currency’s share in the total down from 3.8 to 2.8% over the twelve months
to end-September 1996. Other sectors of ECU activity were more buoyant. The value of outstanding
domestic ECU bonds, which reflected mainly new issues by the public sector, increased from ECU 56.6
to 58.3 billion. Short-term instruments outstanding increased slightly over the same period due to a pickup in ECU-denominated Euronote issues. Here again, however, the global volume of Euronotes rose more
rapidly than the ECU segment, implying a decline in market share from 1.9 to 1.5%. Estimated bank
lending in ECUs (total final bank lending and lending to banks outside the BIS reporting area) declined by
11.0%, to stand at ECU 51.0 billion at end-September 1996, compared with ECU 57.3 billion at endSeptember 1995. On the liabilities side, ECU deposits held by non-banks contracted by 9.1%. The ECU’s

market share in total international banking assets and liabilities dropped further from 2.4 to 1.9% (assets)
and from 2.3 to 1.8% (liabilities).
The spread between the ECU market and theoretical or “basket” exchange rates has traditionally remained
in a range of +20 basis points, except during periods of exchange market turbulence. In early 1996 the
negative spread widened markedly to reach over -3%, the largest discount ever (see chart below). However,
from March onwards, a rapid and marked reversal of this trend was recorded, bringing the spread back to
around -0.5% by December 1996. The spread between the ECU market bond yield and the theoretical
bond yield widened from around zero in early 1996 to -0.2 percentage point in April and remained around
that level for the remainder of the year.
The sharp widening of the exchange rate spread by early 1996, at a time when exchange rate tensions were
not marked, may have reflected various factors, most notably uncertainties about the starting date and
expected initial composition of Stage Three of EMU, as well as the legal status of the private ECU and the
continuity of ECU contracts. The subsequent marked narrowing of the exchange rate spread since the first
quarter of 1996 may be the result of a lowering of tensions and uncertainties, as reflected in stable
conditions within the EMS. It may also mirror the increased optimism in financial markets about the
likelihood of EMU, as well as the agreement reached at the European Council meeting held in Dublin on
13-14 December 1996 on the legal framework for the use of the euro.

escudo the evidence was mixed, depending
on the indicators used. All non-ERM
currencies, and most notably the pound
sterling, experienced an appreciation of
their real effective exchange rates. Overall,
at end-1996 many EU currencies may be
considered to have moved towards
exchange rate levels that are more
sustainable with respect to underlying
competitive positions. A crucial factor in
this regard may have been declining
inflationary expectations coupled with the
limited degree of passthrough of earlier
depreciations to domestic inflation.

Nuanced policy responses
Monetary authorities responded to the
quiet market conditions prevailing during
1996 in different ways, reflecting varying
domestic economic needs and monetary
and exchange rate policy strategies (see
also Section 2 of this chapter). Notably,
upward pressure experienced by a number
of currencies vis-à-vis the Deutsche Mark
was accommodated by means of a
combination of approaches - allowing
currencies to appreciate, reducing shortterm interest rates and effecting
intervention purchases of foreign reserves
- the relative weight of which differed
between countries.
Some EU central banks permitted a sizable
appreciation of their exchange rates in
order to support an anti-inflationary policy
stance or to contain potential inflationary
pressures in the light of a buoyant domestic
economy. In many member countries
interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the
Deutsche Mark declined sharply along the
yield curve. Overall, foreign exchange
intervention activity was higher than in
1995. A few EU central banks bought
significant amounts of foreign currencies in
order either to replenish reserves or to
preserve orderly market conditions, while
keeping monetary conditions in line with
domestic policy requirements.

1.6 Securities markets in EU
countries
Declining long-term interest rates and
differentials
Nominal yields on 10-year bonds declined
over the course of 1996 in all EU countries,
with the exception of the United Kingdom.
On average, bond yields in the EU
decreased by 1.1 percentage points (see
Table 7). There were marked crosscountry variations: long-term interest rates
in Italy, Portugal and Spain declined by 3.3,
2.9 and 2.8 percentage points respectively,
while in Sweden they declined by 1.7
percentage points. In Belgium, Denmark,
France, Ireland, Luxembourg and Finland
10-year bond yields dropped by around
0.7 to 1.0 percentage points. The decline
was less pronounced in Germany, the
Netherlands and Austria, where interest
rate levels were already low.
Two broad themes emerge from an analysis
of factors underlying bond market
developments in the EU in 1996. One is
the role played by the US market. Given
its size, developments in the US bond
market generally tend to play a key role in
the determination of short-term
movements of bond yields in the EU.
However, fundamental factors which
influenced bond market developments in
the EU in 1996 differed somewhat from
those in the United States, making room
for a partial “decoupling” from the US
market. Whereas the differential between
US 10-year bond yields and those in
Germany has fluctuated within a very
narrow range by historical standards since
1990, mainly reflecting the influence of
the longer-term improvement in the
inflation performance of the United States,
this differential moved from negative to
positive during 1996 as US bond yields
rose above those in Germany for the first
time since late 1994 (see Chart 8). The
principal underlying factor was the differing
cyclical positions of the United States and

41

most EU countries, which in turn led to
differing expectations about the future
course of short-term interest rates. In
addition, the recovery of the US dollar
throughout the year played a supportive
role in this development. Differing
expectations of short-term rates linked to
the current cycle also accounted for the
difference in nominal bond yields between
the United Kingdom and Germany.
A second theme relates to the
development of intra-EU bond yield
differentials. In all EU countries with the
exception of the United Kingdom, longterm interest rate differentials against
countries with the lowest bond yields
narrowed significantly during the course of
1996 (see Chart 8). In the early part of

the year long-term interest rate differentials
tended to narrow, particularly for highyielding countries, despite the upturn in
international bond yields. This development
contrasted with previous episodes of
increasing international bond yields, which
are usually coupled with widening
differentials. Together with the declining
volatility in the bond markets of highyielding countries, this was indicative inter
alia of declining inflation risk premia in
these countries.
In particular, those countries which had
the largest differentials at the beginning of
the year and where risk premia may
correspondingly have been highest, such as
Spain, Italy, Portugal and Sweden, tended
to demonstrate the greatest narrowing of

differentials. A combination of factors
appears to account for this trend, including
a significant reduction in expected inflation
differentials within the EU, perceptions of
progress towards fiscal consolidation, the
relative stability of exchange rates and a
decrease in political uncertainty in a number
of countries. These factors were seen by
the markets as improving the prospects
for EMU - an element which may in turn
have played an independent role in the
narrowing of differentials, both directly
and by further improving prospects for
exchange rate stability.

Strong performance of EU equity markets in
1996
In most EU countries equity price indices
increased by 20-25% during 1996. This
similar development is, to some extent,
indicative of broadly similar expectations
regarding real macroeconomic trends in
EU countries. However, the rise did not
solely relate to expectations regarding
corporate earnings.

44

One important influence on this
development appears to have been a
perception that stock prices in many EU
countries had moved out of line with both
US stock prices and EU bond markets
during the course of 1995 rather than
revisions of expectations regarding trends
in corporate earnings. To some extent,
therefore, there may have been an element
of catch-up with US developments during
1996, with international fund managers
increasing their EU portfolio weightings as
US equity prices continued to rise.
Bond yields may also have played a role.
The gap between long-term bond yields
and dividend yields can offer an indication
of the influence of bond market
developments on the equity market and
hence can provide information about
expected future dividend growth or
changes in the equity risk premium. In
contrast to the United States, this gap
tended to narrow in many EU countries
during 1996. This suggests that not only
expectations about future earnings in the
EU but also the decline in long-term bond
yields played an important role in the
equity markets.

2 Monetary policies in Member States
This section describes the changes in
monetary conditions in individual EU
countries in 1996. Its content reflects the
EMI’s task in Stage Two of EMU to
strengthen the co-operation between the
national central banks and the co-ordination
of the monetary policies of Member States,
with the aim of ensuring price stability.
Linked to these responsibilities, the
appropriateness and compatibility of
current monetary and foreign exchange
policies are reviewed in regular discussions
at the EMI.
In most EU countries the economic and
financial environment in 1996 allowed for
further steady but cautious easing of
monetary policies via reductions in official
and key interest rates (see Chart 9,
Chart 10 and the chronology in the Annex);
the rate of expansion of the broad money
supply (in terms of harmonised M3) in
the Union as a whole rose from 2.9% in
1995 to 6.4% in 1996. On balance, in the
majority of Member States (namely
Belgium/Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland
and Sweden) official and key interest rates
declined to low and very similar levels.
The convergence of short-term interest
rates and inflation rates in 1996, in
conjunction with the achievement of a
high degree of exchange rate stability,
suggests the emergence of a closely aligned
stance of monetary policies among these
EU countries. In most of the remaining EU
countries economic and exchange rate
conditions in 1996 gradually became more
supportive of an easing of monetary policies.
As a result, their short-term interest rate
differentials against the Deutsche Mark
narrowed considerably (see Chart 10).
This led to a progressive convergence of
the more differentiated monetary policy
stance which had been warranted for
much of 1995 to counter rising inflationary
pressures and/or renewed exchange rate

turbulence in some EU countries. The
exceptions were Ireland, which, later in
the year, chose to adopt a more strict
monetary stance, and the United Kingdom,
which raised official interest rates in the
second half of 1996.
In Germany the prospect of inflation
remaining at a level seen as being consistent
with price stability allowed the Deutsche
Bundesbank to pursue further monetary
easing. The securities repurchase rate,
which stood at 3.75% at the start of 1996,
was allowed to fall to 3.4% at the end of
January and was set at 3.3% from February
onwards. In April the central bank decided
to reduce the official discount rate by 0.5
percentage point to the historically low
level of 2.5%. At the same time, the
lombard rate was lowered from 5.0 to
4.5%. With the inflation outlook continuing
to be favourable, the securities repurchase
rate was again reduced in August, to stand
at 3.0% for the rest of the year. In
addition, further correction of the major
appreciation of the Deutsche Mark which
had taken place in early 1995 was observed.
The expansion of the broad money supply
M3 remained the key variable guiding the
monetary policy decisions of the Deutsche
Bundesbank. In the fourth quarter of the
year the annual rate of M3 growth was
8.1% and thereby exceeded the 4-7%
target range (see Table 8). This was
attributable to a slight recovery of bank
lending to the private sector and, above
all, to a hesitant demand for long-term
financial assets not included in M3.
However, as M3 growth was around 5%
on average over the past three years, the
underlying monetary trend appeared to
be broadly in line with the objectives and
was not considered to be a serious ground
for concern. As a consequence of the
occasional distortions to M3 growth in
recent years, the central bank placed

45

increasing emphasis on the medium-term
trend in monetary growth (see Box 6). To
take account of the greater volatility of
short-term monetary developments, the
Deutsche Bundesbank also decided to
widen the target corridor for M3 growth
in 1996 from 2 to 3 percentage points.
Furthermore, due consideration was given
to the information contained in
supplementary indicators of future inflation.
The downward movement of German
official interest rates was mirrored in

several other EU countries. The strength
of the Dutch guilder allowed De
Nederlandsche Bank to maintain its key
interest rates somewhat below their
German equivalents throughout the year.
This position was reflected in slightly
negative short-term interest rate
differentials vis-à-vis the Deutsche Mark
(see Chart 10). Money market rates in
Austria remained closely linked to those in
Germany, consistent with the strong focus
on maintaining a stable relation between
the schilling and the Deutsche Mark.

Economic fundamentals underpinned the
high degree of stability of the Belgian/
Luxembourg franc vis-à-vis the Deutsche
Mark. During the year the Belgian threemonth interest rate spread over Germany
fluctuated in a narrow range around zero.
Following the strengthening of their
respective currencies within the ERM, the
central banks of both Denmark and France
gradually brought their official rates down
to levels not far above those in Germany,
the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium.
A specific feature in the case of France was
the marked deceleration of broad money
growth during the year, as the steep yield
curve triggered a widespread shift from
short-term deposits into longer-term assets
and other substitutes for money such as
certain forms of contractual savings. In the
fourth quarter of 1996 M3 declined at an
annual rate of 1.5%, which compares with
the Banque de France’s objective of
accommodating an annual increase of 5%
over the medium term (see Table 8). At
the same time, formation of liquidity was
dynamic; the narrow money aggregates
M1 and M2, which cover transactions
balances and liquid savings, showed annual
growth rates of 3.7% and 6% respectively
in the fourth quarter of 1996. The growth
rate of gross total domestic debt, which
the Banque de France monitors as an
indicator of financing provided to the
economy, decelerated from 5.0 to 3.6%.
In Finland evidence of very subdued
inflationary pressures provided scope for
Suomen Pankki to bring its tender rate
down further, while continuing to comply
with its objective of stabilising underlying
inflation at around 2% (see Table 8). From
October onwards, money market rates
stood virtually in line with those in
Germany. On the entry of the Finnish
markka to the ERM on 14 October 1996,
the central bank declared that while
monetary policy decisions would continue
to be taken with a view to the inflation
target, greater attention would henceforth

48

be given to the objective of ensuring
exchange rate stability.
Outside the ERM Sveriges Riksbank
undertook a monetary easing beginning in
early January 1996 in response to the
rapidly improving inflation outlook in
Sweden following the strong recovery of
the krona and the restrictive fiscal stance.
The pace of the subsequent step-wise
reduction in official interest rates was
conditional on the continued observance
of the Riksbank’s 2% inflation target (with
a fluctuation margin of 1 percentage point
on either side). Over the year as a whole
the Swedish three-month interest rate fell
in anticipation of lower key rates while the
securities repurchase rate declined by a
total of 481 basis points to 4.1%.
Among the remaining countries, in Portugal
evidence of progress towards fiscal
consolidation and wage developments in
line with incomes policy agreements
contributed to favourable inflation prospects,
which underpinned the steady upward trend
of the escudo within the ERM. This paved
the way for a reduction in official interest
rates broadly in line with several other ERM
currencies and an appreciable narrowing of
the three-month interest rate spread over
Germany (the repo rate declined by a total
of 180 basis points to 6.7%).
The Banco de España also saw scope to
continue the cautious monetary easing it had
initiated in December 1995, while ensuring
that the downward trend of current and
expected Spanish inflation stayed in line with
its objective to bring the rate of inflation
steadily below 3% in 1997. Two key factors
supporting this assessment were the stable
position of the peseta within the ERM and
the decline of the growth rate of ALP (liquid
assets held by the public) to 6.5%, well
below the medium-term ceiling of 8% (see
Table 8). Moreover, the adoption of a
restrictive budget entailed a notable
improvement in the policy mix. Accordingly,
the intervention rate was brought down in

several steps, from 9.0% at the start of the
year to 6.25% in December. While the
associated decline in short-term interest
rates significantly reduced the spread of
Spanish rates over Germany, the wide margin
still suggested a relatively strict monetary
stance.
The Banca d’Italia had announced that it
would seek to ensure a rate of consumer
price inflation (net of indirect taxes) of
below 4% in 1996 and of less than 3% in
1997. Consequently, the satisfactory price
performance - which was supported, inter
alia, by a strong recovery of the lira allowed the central bank gradually to lower
short-term interest rates during the course
of 1996. Moreover, the expansion of the
M2 money supply remained well below
the reference target of 5% (see Table 8).
After mid-year both the discount rate and
the fixed-term advances rate were reduced
in two steps, by 75 basis points on each
occasion, to 7.5% and 9% respectively.
Subsequently, short-term market rates
declined further after the lira’s return
to the ERM grid, which took place on
25 November 1996, although the
reduction in short-term rates was less than
that in long-term rates, thus signalling a
restrictive monetary policy stance.
The Bank of Greece gradually lowered its
interest rates, as a reflection of both the
broadly stable position of the drachma
against the ECU - the central bank’s key
intermediate objective - and the prospect of
inflation resuming its downward trend. High
fiscal deficits and structural rigidities, however,
continued to act as a constraint on monetary
policy and prevented the attainment of a
more appropriate policy mix. In particular,
the resultant relatively high level of interest
rates encouraged strong capital inflows, even
though interest rate differentials against other
EU countries narrowed considerably. To
arrest the attendant rapid credit expansion,
in addition to continuously absorbing excess
interbank liquidity, the central bank was
forced to tighten its minimum reserve

50

requirements from June onwards. Largely as
a result of this countermeasure liquidity
conditions gradually normalised, credit
expansion slowed down, and the annual rate
of M3 growth fell to within the 6-9% target
range.
The more advanced cyclical upswing led
to a somewhat more differentiated
monetary policy stance in the United
Kingdom. In the first part of the year the
inflation outlook appeared to be broadly
consistent with the Government’s
medium-term objective of bringing
underlying (RPIX) inflation down to 2.5%
or less. This prompted the authorities to
proceed further along the path towards
monetary easing on which they had
embarked in December 1995. Accordingly,
the minimum lending rate was reduced on
three occasions by a total of 75 basis
points, and stood at 5.75% at the end of
the first half of the year. In the course of
1996, however, inflation prospects
deteriorated as the cyclical recovery
gathered pace and broad money growth
(in terms of M4) remained strong. Against
this background, and following the advice
of the Bank of England, the Chancellor of
the Exchequer decided at the end of
October to raise the minimum lending
rate again by 25 basis points to 6.0%.
Finally, Ireland also observed the closely
aligned stance of monetary policy
characteristic of the majority of EU
countries in the first months of 1996. In
April the central bank was still in a position
to participate in the general round of
official interest rate reductions, trimming
its short-term facility rate by 25 basis
points to 6.25%. Later in the year, however,
it chose to adopt a more strict monetary
stance by letting money market rates rise
in response to the buoyant growth of
monetary and credit aggregates and
economic activity. This went in parallel
with a steadily appreciating Irish pound.

Box 6

Recent experience of monetary targeting and inflation targeting
For many years monetary policies in the larger industrial countries made prominent use of intermediate
monetary targets. The major EU countries were no exception; by the end of the 1970s they had all
publicly announced monetary targets as the centrepiece of their national frameworks for monetary policy.
In contrast, smaller Member States generally adhered to an exchange rate objective and refrained from
setting monetar y targets in their pursuit of the common objective of price stability. Against the backdrop
of the changing f inancial environment and the increased focus on exchange rate stability, most of the larger
EU countries downgraded the practice of monetary targeting in the course of the 1980s. Only in Germany
did monetary targeting retain its previous pre-eminent position. The fact that, in addition to Germany,
several other Member States (namely Greece, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom) nonetheless
continued to announce quantitative monetary guidelines, reference values or monitoring ranges suggests
that they still attached a prominent role to key monetary aggregates.
In the early years of the 1990s the process of financial liberalisation and innovation continued at an even
faster pace, raising important questions about the interpretation of and control over more volatile shortterm movements in monetary aggregates. Moreover, in Germany monetary growth was distorted by
influences resulting from unification and by other special factors, e.g. modifications to the tax framework.
The Deutsche Bundesbank has adjusted to these trends by increasingly assessing current monetary
developments in Germany from a medium-term perspective and in the light of supplementary inflation
indicators. With the help of this strategy the Deutsche Bundesbank was able to reduce the inflation rate,
which had risen in the wake of unification, in the following years to a level which is broadly seen as
consistent with price stability. The monetary authorities of other EU countries under review have generally
responded by (further) reducing the prominence given to monetary aggregates in the formulation of their
monetary policies. They nonetheless continue to see monetary aggregates as a very useful - and in some
cases preferred - indicator of the longer-term risks of future inflation. As such, monetary aggregates have
retained their function as an indispensable policy guide.
In some cases the shift in policy focus described above has occurred as part of the changeover to a monetary
regime in which explicit inflation targets perform the role of providing an anchor for inflation expectations.
Over the past few years four Member States have formally adopted such a monetary framework, namely
Spain, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. While the rather recent date of the changeover precludes a
conclusive assessment of the effectiveness of direct inflation targeting, the experience of the early years
nevertheless allows some observations to be made. In general, the inflation performance in these EU countries
has been markedly better than in the past and the announced (interim) inflation targets have often been
achieved ahead of time. As a note of caution, however, it should be borne in mind that these good results may
also have reflected in most cases the tight monetary policies which had been pursued towards the end of the
previous exchange rate targeting regimes, the global experience of disinflation and supply-side policies.
This general qualification notwithstanding, all four of the above Member States had a rather favourable
policy record in the f irst few years of implementing a direct inflation targeting strategy. This policy
record (as documented, for example, in the EMI’s previous two Annual Reports) shows that, in the
course of 1994-95, the monetary authorities in Spain, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom responded
to a deterioration in prospects for inflation by tightening the policy stance in an alert and pre-emptive
manner. To account for the uncertainties of inflation forecasting and inflation control, they have tended to
adopt a cautious monetary policy stance on the basis of all relevant information (generally including
monetary aggregates), while explaining their actions and objectives in detailed inflation reports and related
publications. Available indicators for 1996 indicate that some success has been achieved in establishing
credibility for this new monetary strategy.

51

3 Economic prospects and challenges for convergence
More favourable conjunctural outlook, while
structural adjustment needs persist
Economic forecasts released by
international organisations at the end of
1996 point to a benign external environment and a more favourable conjunctural
outlook for the EU in 1997.
As regards the external environment, world
output growth is expected to maintain
the same sustained pace in 1997 as it did
in 1996, with the US economy continuing
to expand at a steady rate, although
activity in Japan may decelerate. World
trade should maintain the relatively high
growth rate attained in 1996. The prices
of raw materials are not expected to pose
a major threat to price stability.
In the European Union GDP growth is
expected to pick up in 1997, reflecting a
projected recovery of both domestic and
foreign demand. Domestic demand - in
particular private investment - should
benefit from a number of positive
developments during 1996, inter alia:
progress towards price stability; a significant
decline in long-term interest rates; and
corrective movements of exchange rates
followed by increased stability on foreign
exchange markets. Moreover, continued
wage moderation and favourable
profitability should contribute to an
acceleration in activity. Net exports are
also expected to increase their positive
contribution to growth, albeit slightly, inter
alia as a result of forecast high extra-EU
growth. Private consumption may remain
more subdued.
In contrast to the more favourable
conjunctural outlook, however, the process
of structural adjustment is still at an early
stage. In particular, the situation in labour
markets is forecast to remain highly
unsatisfactory in most EU countries.

52

Although employment is expected to grow
to some extent in 1997, after stagnating in
1996, unemployment rates in the EU may
decrease only marginally, thus remaining at
historically high levels. For this reason,
considerable emphasis has been placed
over the past few years on efforts to
increase labour market flexibility in Europe
(see Box 2). Some countries, such as
Denmark, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands,
Finland and the United Kingdom, may be
expected to perform better than average
in this respect, owing in several cases to
progress in labour market reforms.
However, in most countries such reforms
still seem to be too marginal to significantly
improve labour market trends. Even in
countries where substantive measures have
been undertaken, more time will be
necessary for the effects of such reforms
to be fully assessed.
While structural reform is indeed seen to
be the key to addressing the unemployment
problem in most Member States, it is
obvious that there is no uniform European
labour market. This explains why there
have been considerable differences in the
form, intensity and timing of labour market
reforms in the individual Member States.
However, it is common to almost all these
reforms that they have focused on social
security (particularly the unemployment
benefits system), regulations concerning
working hours, contract terms and the use
of temporary workers, and aspects of the
collective bargaining systems. It is in these
fields that a wide range of institutional
rigidities account for the weak performance
of European labour markets, and it will be
a major challenge for most Member States
to tackle them in a decisive and sustained
manner.

The state of convergence
In November 1996 a comprehensive
report entitled “Progress towards
convergence 1996” was released by the
EMI. The report, which for the first time
was produced for the EU Council under
Article 109j (1) of the Treaty, concluded
that “at present a majority of Member
States do not fulfil the necessary conditions
for the adoption of a single currency”. In
mid-December 1996 the Council, meeting
in the composition of the Heads of State
or Government, took its decision under
Article 109j (3) of the Treaty and
confirmed that the procedure laid down
in Article 109j (4) will be applied as early
as possible in 1998, with a view to the
commencement of the third stage of EMU
on 1 January 1999. This decision requires
that the Council, meeting in the
composition of the Heads of State or
Government, will confirm in early 1998
which Member States fulfil the necessary
conditions for the adoption of the single
currency. The Treaty provides for this
assessment to be preceded by reports by
the EMI and by the Commission.
As regards the state of convergence, the
EMI’s November 1996 Report saw the
environment of low cost and price pressures
as favourable. Most Member States were
enjoying relatively low inflation, and many
had virtually achieved price stability. Other
countries had recorded a slowdown in
inflation, which was seen as having
contributed to a tendency towards reduced
risk premia in financial markets, and thereby
to a higher degree of exchange rate stability
and a reduction in long-term interest rate
differentials. By contrast, progress in fiscal
consolidation was generally regarded as
too slow. Most countries had not yet
achieved a situation which, in a broader
view, might be judged as sustainable in the
medium term. With regard to the issue of
sustainability, it was emphasised that the
improvement of the deficit by measures

with a one-off effect does not ensure
sustainable consolidation and that great
attention would have to be paid to the
substance and not only to the accounting
methods used to measure both deficits
and debts; that consolidation efforts
needed to be all the more resolute, the
higher the initial stock of debt; and that
sustainable fiscal consolidation would have
to cope with two challenges: first, high and
persistent unemployment and, second,
those arising from demographic trends.
The data presented below (see Table 9)
give a brief update of this examination
related to 1996. In this context, it should
be noted that the data for the examination
of convergence are to be provided by the
Commission and no new Commission
data are yet available for the outcome of
fiscal policies in 1996. Therefore, reference
is still made to the data published by the
Commission in November 1996. For the
criteria on price stability and on
convergence of long-term interest rates,
the data have been updated to include the
months to December 1996. Furthermore,
new data on Harmonised Indices of
Consumer Prices have been included for
1996, while for 1995 inflation rates are
only available on the basis of Interim
Indices of Consumer Prices (see Box 7).

Progress towards price stability
Prospects for sustained low inflation in the
EU are rather favourable. A number of
factors underlie this judgement: the growth
of monetary aggregates does not give
cause for concern; in most countries there
remains spare capacity and wage growth
appears to be moderate. Moreover, in
some countries where wages are more
buoyant, there may still be some scope for
their inflationary consequences to be at
least partly absorbed by reductions in
profit margins or increases in productivity.

Besides these largely temporary factors,
some structural improvements have been
observed which support the view that the
prevailing low inflation rates can be
sustained in the context of appropriate
monetary policies geared towards the
objective of price stability. These structural
changes include increasing competition in
goods and services markets linked to
privatisation, deregulation and international
integration; the fact that, in countries
where inflation rates have traditionally
been high, both fiscal and monetary policies
are regarded as having helped to bring
about a structural improvement in inflation
expectations; and labour market reforms
54

in some countries, which have contributed
to improving wage and employment
flexibility. As described above, however,
the evidence in this respect suggests that
further measures to increase labour market
flexibility are urgently warranted,
particularly in the light of the high levels of
unemployment in Europe.
Upward risks for inflation still remain, as is
evidenced by significant increases in unit
labour costs in some countries. While
estimates of output gaps in the EU point
to the existence of spare capacity in
most countries, owing to difficulties of
adjustment, a rapid reduction of the output

statements 5 and 6 relating to Council Regulation (EC) No. 3605/93 of 22 November 1993, the Council and the Commission agree
that, for Denmark, these items shall be specified in the presentation of general government gross debt. They totalled 12.0% of GDP
in 1995 and are expected to be 10.0% of GDP in 1996. In addition, the data are not adjusted for the amounts outstanding in the
government debt from the financing of public undertakings, which, according to statement 3 relating to the aforementioned Regulation,
will be subject to a separate presentation for the Member States. In Denmark this item amounted to 6.5% of GDP in 1995 and is
expected to be 6.2% of GDP in 1996. If corrected by these items, the debt level at end-year would stand at 53.4% of GDP in 1995
and an expected 54.0% in 1996.

gap may create temporary inflationary
pressures, even if productive capacities in
the economy are not yet fully utilised.
However, it should be noted that reliable
estimation of the output gap after a major
recession is very difficult. Furthermore,
external developments could pose risks.

The key role of sustainable fiscal positions
Against the background of fiscal positions
in 1996, many governments have taken
initiatives to strengthen their consolidation
efforts with a view to the outcome in
1997. It is too early to judge the effect

these measures will have on outturns in
1997 and beyond. However, in general,
more and durable progress is needed in
order to ensure sustainable fiscal positions.
If present assumptions about the improved
conjunctural outlook turn out to be well
founded, the necessary continuation and
strengthening of structural adjustments
should be facilitated. At the same time,
the temptation to relax adjustment efforts
in the light of seemingly diminishing
constraints must be avoided at all costs.
In a broader context, the decisive
achievement of government objectives can
also make a major contribution to the

55

Box 7

Harmonised indices of consumer prices
The Treaty requires the sustainable convergence of EU economies on a high degree of price stability to be
measured by consumer price indices calculated on a comparable basis, taking into account differences in
national definitions. Although current consumer price statistics in the Member States are largely based on
similar principles, there are considerable differences of detail which affect the comparability of the
national results.
To meet the requirement for comparability set out in the Treaty, in October 1995 the EU Council adopted
a Regulation concerning Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HICPs). Based on this regulation, a first
step towards producing harmonised indices of consumer prices was taken in 1996 with the publication of
the Interim Indices of Consumer Prices (IICPs) by EUROSTAT. In a second step, from January 1997
onwards HICPs are calculated using comparable definitions and procedures.
The HICPs will form the basis for the assessment of inflation convergence in early 1998 and will also be
essential for the conduct of the single monetary policy in Stage Three.
The conceptual work on the harmonisation of consumer price indices is being carried out by the European
Commission (EUROSTAT) in close liaison with the National Statistical Institutes. As a key user, the
EMI is closely involved in this work. In addition to the Council Regulation, the European Commission
has prepared two comprehensive Regulations to define the version of the HICPs that is available now.
The Commission Regulations concern - inter alia - the initial coverage of HICPs in 1997, initial standards
for the procedures of quality adjustment and the treatment of new goods and services, as well as a
common set of formulae for the calculation of elementary price indices (i.e. those for individual products).
Moreover, a harmonised classification for HICP sub-indices has been agreed, which will enable the
publication of a fully comparable detailed breakdown for the fifteen Member States. Although these
measures are a substantial step towards fully comparable consumer price indices in the EU, it has not
proved possible to solve all the conceptual and technical questions in time for 1997. Further measures for
achieving fully harmonised HICPs are therefore required and will need to be implemented in the next few
years.

Monthly HICPs are published from January 1997, including back data for the years 1996 and 1995. This
allows calculation of HICP inflation rates from January 1996 onwards. Though not all of the harmonisation
measures implemented with effect from January 1997 can be introduced for data for the period before
1997, HICPs for 1995 and 1996 are nonetheless based on comparable coverage of goods and services, thus
removing one of the main differences between national CPIs. The results are shown in comparison to the
national CPIs in the table above.
The general pattern of HICPs is close to that given by the national CPIs, with the differences in the figures
being generally small (in the range of -0.3 percentage point to 0.1 percentage point). In only a few
countries (Greece, the Netherlands and Finland) does the difference exceed this interval.
Differences in the results obtained using HICPs and using CPIs reflect differences in the coverage of the
two indices, in price developments in the respective sub-groups, and in methodological standards. Furthermore,
the significance of these factors varies across countries, thereby affecting, to a greater or lesser extent, the
difference between the HICP and the CPI in each individual Member State.

reduction of risks linked to the state of
public finances. First, if consolidation is
implemented so as to promote credibility
regarding a durable shift towards sound
budgetary developments, negative shortterm effects on demand may well be
counteracted by positive confidence
effects. Second, durable consolidation will
also have lasting effects on potential growth.
It is this link between successful fiscal
adjustment and an improvement of growth
perspectives over the medium term which
justifies viewing consolidation efforts not
only against the background of the
requirements of the convergence criteria,
but also as necessary in themselves. While
such efforts must continue to be primarily
focused on governments’ deficit and debt
positions, they must also include structural
measures on the expenditure and revenue
side to promote strong economic
performance and employment and to
underpin an environment of non-inflationary
growth.

Increased exchange rate stability and
reductions in yield spreads
While recent developments, reflected in
broadly stable conditions in the ERM and a
significant reduction in long-term interest
rate differentials among EU Member States,
are partly related to market expectations
concerning EMU participation, they also
reflect the increasing degree of nominal
convergence which has been achieved. In
the latter respect, exchange rate corrections
and subsequent stability and the
development of bond yields reflect inflation
convergence and can be seen as an
indication that private sector expectations
are gradually adapting to the lower rates
of inflation that have been achieved,
thereby also contributing to the reduction
of risk premia.
However, the impact of EMU expectations
on financial asset prices also entails some
risks. Setbacks in the consolidation of
public finances or other factors that may
reduce confidence in the EMU process
may negatively affect bond markets, with
possible spillovers to foreign exchange
markets.

57

Decisive period ahead as Stage Three
deadlines approach
As the deadlines for moving to Stage
Three approach, the essential requirement
of achieving a high degree of sustainable
convergence will have to be fulfilled. This
is all the more important since agents are
starting to look beyond the year 1999 and
to form expectations about likely longerterm developments in the euro area. At
stake is the macroeconomic environment
in which the ECB will have to take its first
steps in ensuring price stability.
These considerations make it all the more
essential that monetary policies remain
vigilant with a view to ensuring price
stability. The stance adopted in the period
ahead will be particularly important in that
it will increasingly affect inflation in 1999
and thereafter, and hence price
expectations for the euro area. As regards
budgetary policies, it must be kept in mind
that the necessary strict compliance with
the fiscal criteria also implies ensuring the
sustainability of government financial
positions as a precondition for the
adoption of the single currency. As agreed
by the European Council in Dublin in
December 1996, the maintenance of sound

58

budgetary positions in Stage Three will
take place within the framework of the
Stability and Growth Pact. The EMI
endorses the objective of strengthening
the credibility and effectiveness of the
Excessive Deficit Procedure under Article
104c. This framework should be as
transparent and precise as possible, in
accordance with the principles of the
Treaty, and the procedures to be enshrined
in the EU Council Regulation should be
strong and credible and contribute
decisively to the sound conduct of fiscal
policy in Stage Three. The paramount
importance of sustainable budgetary
positions also stems from the future burden
which will arise from the interaction
between interest payments on the
accumulated debt stocks, high and
persistent
unemployment,
and
demographic trends. Finally, exchange rate
stability remains an element in judging the
degree of sustainable convergence both
before and after 1999. As part of the
future monetary and exchange rate policy
co-operation between the euro area and
non-participating EU countries, a new ERM
will be established. Membership will be
voluntary; nevertheless, EU Member States
with a derogation can be expected to join
the mechanism.

Chapter II

Preparatory work
for Stage Three

1 Monetary policy
In accordance with Article 7 of its Statute,
the EMI is required to report annually on the
adaptation of monetary policy instruments
and the preparation of the procedures
necessary for conducting the single monetary
policy in Stage Three of EMU. Furthermore,
Article 109f (3) of the Treaty requires the
EMI to specify, at the latest by 31 December
1996, the regulatory, organisational and
logistical framework necessary for the ESCB
to perform its tasks in Stage Three. In
publishing the report on “The single monetary
policy in Stage Three - Specification of the
operational framework” in January 1997, the
EMI provided the public and the
counterparties of the national central banks
(NCBs) with information of interest regarding
the operational aspects of monetary policy.
In addition, the publication of the document
“Elements of the monetary policy strategy of
the ESCB in Stage Three of EMU” in February
1997 provided further information regarding
the choice of strategy to be followed in
Stage Three. This section provides a brief
summary of the main issues covered in these
reports, both of which are available from the
EMI on request.

1.1 Monetary policy strategy
The Treaty unambiguously states that the
primary objective of the ESCB is to
maintain price stability. In the pursuit of
this final objective, the ESCB will have to
develop a monetary policy strategy. Five
candidate strategies for monetary policy in
Stage Three (exchange rate targeting;
interest rate pegging; nominal income
targeting; monetary targeting; and direct
inflation targeting) have been examined by
the EMI. Taking into account a number of
guiding
principles
(effectiveness,
accountability, transparency, medium-term
orientation, continuity and consistency with

62

the ESCB’s independence) and considering
the environment likely to prevail in the
euro area, the list of potential candidate
strategies has been narrowed down to
two, namely monetary targeting and direct
inflation targeting.
While pure forms of monetary and direct
inflation targeting can be clearly
distinguished at a theoretical level, their
application in different countries has shown
that several variants integrating elements
of both strategies exist. Moreover, all
central banks that pursue either of these
two strategies monitor a wide and similar
set of economic and financial variables as
indicators in the determination of the
monetary policy stance. The EMI is not in a
position, nor is it necessary, to determine
more specifically at this stage which
strategy should be the preferred one to
be adopted by the Governing Council of
the ECB.
Whichever choice will be made in terms
of monetary policy strategy, a number of
key elements have been identified as being
an indispensable part of any strategy: a
quantified definition of the final objective
of price stability and of the specific targets
against which to assess the ESCB’s
performance in terms of meeting the
objective; a communication policy for the
ESCB to explain its strategy to the general
public; the availability of a broad set of
indicator variables to help assess the risks
to future price stability; detailed
information on and a prominent role for
monetary aggregates, provided that money
demand is sufficiently stable in the long
run in the euro area; and tools to allow
forecasts for inflation and other economic
variables pertaining to the euro area.
The EMI and the NCBs are undertaking
preparatory work to ensure that the ESCB

will have the statistical and analytical
infrastructure at its disposal to pursue
either of the above strategies.

1.2 Implementation of the single
monetary policy
Instruments and procedures
The EMI Council has defined a set of
monetary policy instruments that will be
made available to the ESCB. It is envisaged
that the ESCB will mainly use open market
operations, but that it will also offer two
standing facilities. In addition, preparations
are being made for an infrastructure
allowing the ECB to impose minimum
reserve requirements if it wishes to do so.
Four types of open market operations will
be at the disposal of the ESCB: main
refinancing operations (viz. regular liquidity-

providing reverse transactions with a
weekly frequency and a maturity of two
weeks); longer-term refinancing operations
(viz. liquidity-providing reverse transactions
with a monthly frequency and a maturity
of three months, intended to cater for a
limited part of the global refinancing
volume); fine-tuning operations (adapted
to the prevailing circumstances and to the
specific objectives of managing the liquidity
situation in the market or of steering
interest rates); and structural operations
(intended to affect the structural liquidity
position of the banking system vis-à-vis the
ESCB). Table 10 sets out the main features
of the open market operations of the
ESCB.
Two standing facilities will be available to
provide (in the case of the marginal lending
facility) or to absorb (in the case of the
deposit facility) overnight liquidity. These
facilities will bound overnight market

interest rates and the interest rates applied
to them will help signal the general stance
of monetary policy.
The minimum reserve system which will
also be available could be used for
stabilising money market interest rates,
creating or enlarging a structural liquidity
shortage in the money market and possibly
contributing to the control of monetary
expansion. The EMI is undertaking the
necessary technical preparatory work in
order to put the ECB in a position to use
this instrument should it decide to do so.

Eligible counterparties and assets
In order to secure a single monetary policy
stance and a level playing-field for
counterparties across the whole of the
euro area, the EMI has worked out common
eligibility criteria, both for the
counterparties and for the assets to be
used in their operations with the ESCB.
No technical preparations are being
undertaken at this stage for remote access
to monetary policy operations, allowing
counterparties in the euro area to have
direct access to operations with an NCB
of a jurisdiction where they have no physical
presence.

Euro or the national denominations of the euro.

It is envisaged that an appropriate legal
instrument will cover the uniform
conditions under which a broad range of
counterparties will participate in the ESCB’s
open market operations and standing
facilities. A broad range of eligible
counterparties is consistent with the
principle of decentralisation in the
execution of the ESCB’s monetary policy
operations. It will enhance policy efficiency
and equal treatment and facilitate the
smooth functioning of the payment system.
Only in the case of fine-tuning operations
may operational efficiency advocate dealing
with a limited range of counterparties.
The Treaty requires all ESCB credit
operations to be based on adequate
collateral. With regard to the actual choice
of assets eligible for use in the ESCB’s
liquidity-providing monetary policy
operations, the ESCB will establish two
types of lists. Both of them will contain
public and private assets which as a rule
will be eligible throughout the euro area.
The tier one list will consist of marketable
assets which fulfil uniform euro area-wide
eligibility criteria specified by the ECB. In
addition, the list will include debt
certificates issued by the ESCB, if any. The
list will be established and maintained by
the ECB. Tier two lists will consist of
additional assets, either marketable or
non-marketable, which NCBs consider
particularly important for their national
financial markets and banking systems.

Subject to ECB guidelines, NCBs will
establish and maintain national lists of
eligible tier two assets. Together, the lists
will allow for the use of a wide set of
assets, which is also desirable for the
smooth functioning of the domestic RTGS
systems and TARGET. All lists will be
available to the public. Table 11 sets out
the main features of tier one and tier two
assets.

Preparatory work following the specification
of the operational framework
As the operational framework of the
single monetary policy in Stage Three has
been specified and made public, the EMI is
now preparing a detailed specification of
all the technical features of the different
instruments and procedures. In addition,
the distribution of responsibilities within
the ESCB, and the legal acts and agreements
regulating the relationships between the
NCBs and the ECB, and between the
ESCB and its counterparties, are already
being prepared.
In the course of 1997 the EMI intends to
publish further material relating to the
specification of the ESCB’s operational
framework for the conduct of the single
monetary policy and to the fields of
monetary policy strategy, monetary policy
instruments and procedures, the TARGET
system and securities settlement systems.

2 Foreign exchange policy
2.1 Exchange rate policy co-operation
between the euro area and other EU
Member States
In 1996 the broad lines of the future
exchange rate relationships between the
euro area and other EU Member States
were defined. The EMI submitted a report
on this issue, which was forwarded by the
ECOFIN Council to the Dublin meeting of
the European Council in December 1996,
at which it was endorsed. The European
Council invited the ECOFIN Council to
prepare a draft Resolution for the European
Council meeting to be held in Amsterdam
in June 1997 setting out the fundamental
elements of the new exchange rate
mechanism (ERM II), following the
precedent set in 1978 in relation to the
present ERM. The EMI has been invited to
prepare, in parallel, a draft for the
agreement between central banks, for
submission to the ECB and to the central
banks of the Member States not forming
part of the euro area.
The ERM II will form part of the future
exchange rate policy co-operation between
the euro area and other EU countries.
Membership will be voluntary; nevertheless,
EU Member States with a derogation can
be expected to join the mechanism. The
main features of the new exchange rate
mechanism are described in the EMI’s
report on “The single monetary policy in
Stage Three - Specification of the
operational framework”.

decentralisation. Irrespective of the chosen
degree of centralisation/decentralisation,
the selection of counterparties will follow
a uniform approach, based primarily on
prudence and efficiency. The pool of
potential counterparties will be sufficiently
large and diverse to guarantee the necessary
flexibility in the conduct of the ESCB’s
intervention operations. Further details
are given in the EMI’s report on “The single
monetary policy in Stage Three Specification of the operational
framework”.

2.3 Management of the ECB’s foreign
exchange reserves
Article 105 (2), third indent, of the Treaty
stipulates that one of the basic tasks of the
ESCB shall be to hold and manage the
official foreign reserves of the Member
States participating in the euro area. Article
30.1 of the ESCB/ECB Statute stipulates
that the ECB shall be provided by the euro
area NCBs with foreign reserve assets,
other than Member States’ currencies,
ECUs, IMF reserve positions and SDRs, up
to an amount equivalent to EURO 50
billion. The proportion to be called up,
following the ECB’s establishment and at
later dates, shall be decided by the ECB
Governing Council. 3 Article 30.1 of the
ESCB/ECB Statute also stipulates that the
ECB shall have the full right to hold and
manage the foreign reserves that are
transferred to it and to use them for
the purposes set out in the ESCB/
ECB Statute.

2.2 Foreign exchange intervention
Preparatory work is being conducted by
the EMI and the NCBs with a view to
ensuring that the ESCB will be in a position
to avail itself of the two basic organisational
arrangements for the conduct of its foreign
exchange operations: centralisation and

66

3

Further calls beyond the EURO 50 billion limit may be
effected by the ECB within limits and under conditions
to be laid down in Community secondary legislation.

Building upon the EMI’s earlier work as
described in its Annual Report 1995,
further preparation is currently being
conducted with the aim of ensuring that
the ECB will be in a position to set the
reserve management policy and to monitor
its implementation from the start of Stage
Three.

2.4 Guidelines for the NCBs’ and
Member States’ operations in foreign
reserve assets
Article 31 of the ESCB/ECB Statute
stipulates that the euro area NCBs’
operations in their remaining foreign
reserve assets and Member States’
transactions with their foreign exchange

working balances shall, above a certain
limit, to be set in the framework of
guidelines by the ECB, be subject to
approval by the ECB in order to ensure
consistency with the single exchange rate
and monetary policies. The ECB Governing
Council shall issue guidelines with a view
to facilitating such operations.
Building upon the principles outlined in
the EMI’s Annual Report 1995, these
draft guidelines are currently being drawn
up for approval by the ECB Governing
Council. At a technical level, follow-up
work is proceeding with regard to the
information systems support required for
the exchange of the related data within
the ESCB.

3 Statistics
3.1 Statistical requirements to enable
the ESCB to carry out its functions in
Stage Three
The Treaty requires the ECB to collect,
with the assistance of the NCBs, the
statistical information needed for the
conduct of the single monetary policy and
foreign exchange operations of the euro
area. One of the functions of the EMI is to
make the necessary statistical preparations.
The EMI, where appropriate in consultation
with the Commission, has prepared a
statement of statistical requirements for
Stage Three. These requirements were set
out in a detailed document which the EMI
released in July 1996 for the use of
banking associations and others involved in
statistical preparations, and were
summarised for more general use in an
explanatory booklet published at the same
time.4 The main points of the requirements
are given briefly below. Since statistical
preparations take a long time, Member
States were strongly encouraged to begin
implementation promptly.
The statistical information needed for the
conduct of policy in Stage Three will be
wide-ranging. In addition to monetary and
balance of payments statistics and financial
accounts, the ECB will use - as national
central banks do now - a variety of statistics
on costs and prices, government finance,
output and demand, and the labour market.
Forward-looking data (orders, business
surveys) will also be relevant.
Much of this information is already available
at the national level. However, the
compilation of aggregates covering the
euro area will raise questions of
harmonisation and consolidation.
The EMI and subsequently the ECB are
specifically charged with the task of

68

harmonising statistics where necessary
within their area of competence.
Harmonisation is required because there
are differences of definition and statistical
practice, which, if not attended to, would
yield inconsistent aggregates. The aim is to
achieve consistent statistics of good quality,
but without imposing uniform concepts
disregarding differences in the structure
and functioning of national financial systems.
Appropriate consolidation is necessary for
the compilation of certain aggregates since
- in particular - the money stock and its
counterparts and the balance of payments
of the euro area as a whole will not simply
be the sums of the national money stock
and its counterparts and the balance of
payments of the participating countries,
even if the underlying concepts and
statistical practices are fully harmonised.
Thus the money stock of the euro area will
include cross-border holdings of deposits
and other monetary instruments within
the area; the counterparts to money will
be defined and compiled correspondingly.
The balance of payments of the euro area
will comprise only transactions with
residents of countries outside the area,
excluding all transactions within the area;
the international investment position (the
stock of external assets and liabilities of
the area) will be defined in the same way.
In each case, more information will be
needed
to
enable
appropriate
consolidation to be carried out. The task is
complicated by the fact that the
composition of the euro area will not be
known for some time, and that it may
subsequently change.

4

See EMI, “The statistical requirements for Monetary
Union”, July 1996.

The requirements will have to be met by
participating Member States in time for
Stage Three to start in January 1999.
However, to prepare for the single
monetary policy, serious policy planning
will need to begin some months earlier,
and some data will be needed, which
should be as harmonised as possible, well
in advance of the start of Stage Three.

Money and banking statistics
A consolidated balance sheet will be
established on a monthly basis, containing
data on the business of the Monetary
Financial Institutions (MFI) sector,5 in
sufficient instrument, maturity and sectoral
detail to allow flexibility in the calculation
of monetary aggregates and counterparts
covering the single currency area. Since
money and its counterparts will be closely
monitored, irrespective of whether a
monetary aggregate is targeted, reliable,
closely harmonised and timely statistics
will be needed. These aggregates for the
euro area will be compiled as amounts
outstanding (i.e. stocks) and as flows
derived from them, with procedures to
adjust for different accounting practices
where necessary. Further data will be
required on a quarterly basis, including
more information on the maturity of
assets and liabilities and on the sector of
counterparties. The balance sheet statistics
from which the monetary statistics will be
drawn will also provide the liabilities base
for a system of reserve requirements in
the single currency area, should the ECB
choose to introduce one. The statistical
framework is designed to conform to the
European System of Accounts (ESA 95).

exchange markets. Summary items only
would be shown for the current account,
though somewhat more detail will be
required for the financial account. More
detailed information will be provided on a
quarterly basis to permit further analysis
of external transactions.
For the purpose of monetary policy and
exchange market analysis, and to assist in
the compilation of balance of payments
flows, a statement of the external assets
and liabilities of the euro area as a whole,
i.e. the international investment position,
will be compiled annually.
As far as possible, data will correspond to
international standards set out in the 5th
edition of the IMF Balance of Payments
Manual.

Financial and related statistics other than
money and banking and balance of payments
statistics
These statistics will satisfy the ESCB’s
requirements for data on interest rates;
data on financial intermediaries which are
not MFIs, and on capital issues, commercial
paper and similar instruments; financial
accounts conforming to the ESA 95; and
government finance statistics. Financial
accounts set monetary developments in
the context of broad financial
developments. Balance sheet data may
throw light on spending and saving patterns
and are essential to judgements about the
functioning and development of the
financial system and its client sectors. The

5

Balance of payments statistics
A monthly balance of payments of the
euro area will be established, showing the
main items relevant to the ECB’s
judgement on monetary conditions and

The full definition of MFIs is “resident Credit Institutions
as defined in Community Law, and all other resident
Financial Institutions whose business is to receive
deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from
entities other than MFIs, and, for their own account (at
least in economic terms), to grant credits and/or to
make investments in securities”. A list of MFIs, which
form a sub-sector in the European System of Accounts
(ESA 95), is being prepared.

69

financial accounts required under the ESA
95 will be drawn up on a national basis. It
will not be possible to compile a financial
account for the euro area from this source
owing to problems of consolidation. The
EMI is investigating the possibility of
compiling a partial but properly
consolidated financial account for the area
from monetary, balance of payments and
other sources that will be available.
Furthermore, like the national central banks
conducting monetary policy at present,
the ESCB will monitor government finance
and government expenditure and receipts
closely, because government financial
positions and deficits exert important
influences on financial conditions.

Statistics relating to prices and costs;
background economic statistics
Statistics on prices and costs will be
central to the main policy responsibility of
the ESCB. A preliminary harmonised index
of consumer prices (HICP) for all EU
countries is already available for the
purpose of assessing convergence. The
ESCB may be expected to use the HICP in
the form of an index covering the euro
area as a whole (with sub-indices as
necessary) as a main measure of prices. In
addition to the need to have inflation data
as measured by the change in the consumer
price index, the ECB will require a variety
of other measures of prices to support its
primary objective of maintaining price
stability as well as in the context of general
economic assessments. These will include
commodity prices, foreign trade prices,
producer and wholesale prices, and
construction prices. House prices and
survey data may give an advance indication
of inflationary pressures. Wage costs
(including pay settlements, average earnings,
and unit labour costs) will also be used as
indicators of inflationary pressures, as well
as for assessing competitiveness. The
European Commission’s plans to develop

70

a European employment cost index are
relevant in this connection. Sectoral wage
data will be required for monitoring the
effects of wage costs on output prices.
Background economic statistics include
national accounts, monthly statistics on
output and demand, and labour market
statistics. The Council Regulation on shortterm indicators which is in preparation
will be helpful in this area.

3.2 Organisation of statistical work at
the European level
As noted in the EMI’s Annual Report
1995, the EMI and prospectively the ECB
have primary responsibility at the European
level for money and banking and related
statistics, and share responsibility with the
Commission (EUROSTAT) for balance of
payments statistics and financial accounts.
These are the types of statistics for which
central banks are usually responsible in EU
Member States, or share responsibility
with the national statistical institute, and in
which they are likely to take the lead, or
be closely involved, in making the necessary
statistical changes in preparation for the
euro area. Statistics relating to the
convergence criteria and other economic
statistics are the Commission’s
responsibility. The EMI and EUROSTAT
have undertaken to co-operate closely in
all areas of common interest.
As far as the organisation of statistical
work within the ESCB in Stage Three is
concerned, Article 5.2 of the ESCB/
ECB Statute states that the NCBs should
carry out this task, to the extent possible.
To provide the statistics needed for the
ESCB to perform its functions, the NCBs
will collect data in their national territory,
within a common framework, aggregate
the data, and send the aggregates to the
ECB, where statistics covering the euro
area will be compiled. While the ECB will
take the lead in developing statistical

concepts, the NCBs will continue to be
involved at the conceptual stage, since
they will retain considerable expertise in
statistical matters, remain close to the
reporting agents, and continue to be
responsible for most of the practical
statistical work.
The ESCB will need a rapid, secure and
reliable means of exchanging statistical
data with the NCBs, the Commission
(EUROSTAT) and certain other bodies.
An electronic data exchange project is
under way.

3.3 Legal aspects
Article 5.4 of the ESCB/ECB Statute states
that the EU Council must define the
natural and legal persons subject to
reporting requirements, the confidentiality
regime, and the appropriate provisions for
enforcement. It is envisaged that the ECB
will submit a recommendation to the EU
Council to this effect following its
establishment.
The EMI has already prepared the text of a
draft EU Council Regulation which meets

these requirements. The Treaty allows the
ECB to issue regulations where this is
necessary for the ESCB to undertake its
tasks, with binding power in the EU
Member States participating in the euro
area, subject to the terms of
complementary legislation of which this
draft Regulation would form part. Articles
concerning the right of verification of data,
the compulsory collection of statistical
information, and sanctions in the event of
non-compliance would apply only in
participating EU Member States. The
Regulation as drafted requires EU Member
States not participating in the euro area to
design and implement at the national level
all the measures they consider appropriate
in order to collect the statistical information
needed to fulfil the ECB’s statistical
reporting requirements in good time for
their entry into the euro area. There are
strict provisions to protect the
confidentiality of individual reported data.
The text of this draft Council Regulation
was appended to the EMI’s report
on “The single monetary policy in Stage
Three - Specification of the operational
framework”, which was published in
January 1997.

71

4 Payment systems
4.1 The TARGET system
In August 1996 the EMI released the “First
progress report on the TARGET (TransEuropean Automated Real-time Gross
settlement Express Transfer) project”. The
report provided some additional
information on the organisational features
of the system. It mainly addressed the
following issues concerning the
implementation of the TARGET system:
the provision of intraday liquidity; pricing
policies; operating time; the provision of
settlement services to other large-value
transfer systems; the organisational
framework of the project; and technical
specifications for the common procedures
(Interlinking system).
On the first issue, it was agreed that intraday
liquidity will be provided by NCBs of the euro
area to the eligible ESCB counterparties
participating in their domestic payment
systems by making use of two facilities:
intraday overdrafts and intraday repurchase
agreements, which are considered to be
equivalent. Participants in RTGS systems may
also rely on free reserves and develop an
interbank market for intraday liquidity, if they
so wish. Finally, if reserve requirements are
imposed for monetary policy reasons, reserve
balances will be available for payment systems
purposes. Intraday liquidity will be potentially
unlimited, apart from the limitations stemming
from Article 18 of the ESCB/ECB Statute,
which requires central bank credit to be
based on adequate collateral. It was also
agreed that it would be possible for collateral
to be mobilised in a cross-border context
and that it would be the same for central
bank intraday and overnight credit (see
Table 11). Intraday liquidity is expected to be
provided by NCBs free of interest charges.
The options for NCBs outside the euro
area to grant intraday credit in euro to
TARGET participants are still under

72

discussion. In this respect, the EMI Council
decided in December 1996 to prepare
three mechanisms which aim at preventing
intraday credit, if granted to non-euro
area NCBs, from spilling over into overnight
credit. 6 The final decision on which
mechanism to implement will be taken by
the Governing Council of the ECB.
The TARGET pricing policy will be based
on the cost recovery principle. It should
not affect the implementation of the
single monetary policy; it should maintain
a level playing-field between participants
and it should contribute to risk reduction
policies in payment systems. Moreover,
the TARGET pricing policy has to be
compatible with EU competition law.
Concerning operating time, it has been agreed
that TARGET will open, as a general rule, at
7 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. C.E.T. Domestic
RTGS systems may open at an earlier time
for processing domestic payments only. This
harmonisation, based on the current longest
operating hours in the EU, will allow for a
larger overlap between TARGET and the
payment systems of the major financial
centres in North America and the Far East,
thereby supporting the efforts made by
credit institutions and central banks worldwide to limit cross-currency settlement risk.
The common closing time will also avoid the
risk of substantial payments taking place
outside the common operating hours and
thus leading to “regional”/segmented
movements in interest rates in the euro
area.
Concerning the fourth issue - relations
with other transfer systems - all largevalue net settlement systems (NSS) will be

6

See the EMI’s Report on “The single monetary policy in
Stage Three - Specification of the operational framework”, Chapter III Section B 3.1.

required to settle in central bank money. As
regards the provision of settlement services
to these systems operating in euro, it was
agreed that the settlement procedures of
cross-border NSS could be based on
normal TARGET transfers between the
ordinary (RTGS) account of the
participating credit institutions and a special
(centralised) account for the NSS within
the ESCB. Settlement services to domestic
NSS may be provided by NCBs according
to other methods, provided that the
solution does not entail risks for the other
members of the ESCB.
The development phase of the TARGET
project started, as scheduled, in July 1996
after the successful completion of the
specification phase (completed in mid1996). The testing phase will start in mid1997 and be completed in June 1998.
The subsequent simulation phase will be
completed in December 1998. Regular
audit reports are submitted to the EMI
Council on the development of the
TARGET project.
A technical description of the common
procedures of TARGET (the Interlinking
system) is contained in the set of technical
documents annexed to the “First progress
report on the TARGET project”.

4.2 Securities settlement systems
As part of the work to establish
instruments and procedures for the single
monetary policy and to ensure the smooth
functioning of payment systems in Stage
Three of EMU, the EMI assessed the
adequacy of securities settlement systems
and of their linkages with payment systems.
The main conclusions are contained in the
EMI’s report entitled “EU securities
settlement systems – Issues related to
Stage Three of EMU”, released in February
1997, which describes three agreed lines
of action.

The first line of action foresees that in Stage
Three no credit will be granted before the
final transfer of securities has occurred, in
order to prevent the ESCB from incurring
inappropriate risks in conducting monetary
policy operations and/or in providing liquidity
for the smooth functioning of payment
systems. This will ensure the same level of
safety for central bank operations, which are
currently settled in different ways throughout
the European Union.
In Stage Three, some central bank
operations (for example, operations to
provide intraday liquidity to domestic
RTGS systems or some monetary policy
operations) will need to be settled intraday
and will be processed through the TARGET
system. In this case, in order to meet the
above requirement, the securities
associated with such operations will also
need to be transferred with intraday
finality. No major changes with respect to
the current situation are necessary prior to
the start of Stage Three of EMU to ensure
that central bank operations can be settled
securely and efficiently.
The second line of action concerns the
operating hours of securities settlement
systems or central securities depositories
(CSDs), which will have to be consistent
with the operating hours of the single
money market and with those of the
TARGET system.
The third line of action consists of
preparatory work for implementing two
models (the correspondent central banking
model and the guarantee model) for the
cross-border use of collateral in ESCB
credit operations.7

7

For the description of the two models see the EMI’s
Reports “The single monetary policy in Stage Three –
Specification on the operational framework”,
Annex 13, and “EU securities settlement systems –
Issues related to Stage Three of EMU”, Chapter 3.

73

The EMI has started discussions with the
European national and international CSDs
on the extent to which the present and
possible future links between them might
be used to enable central banks to take
collateral held abroad. The EMI will also
be considering in more detail the risks
involved in such linkages and in other

74

aspects of securities settlement and the
possible need for the harmonisation of
principles concerning soundness and
efficiency in settlement procedures. This
work will form the basis of new minimum
standards which European national and
international CSDs will be expected to
meet.

5 Preparation of euro banknotes
After concluding its preparatory work in
1995 with respect to the selection of
design themes and features for the euro
banknotes (see the EMI’s Annual Report
1995), the EMI launched a design
competition on 12 February 1996.
Professional banknote designers nominated
by fourteen EU central banks were invited
to submit draft designs for all seven euro
banknote denominations on the basis of
two themes: “Ages and styles of Europe”,
and an “abstract/modern” design.
Altogether twenty-nine designers or design
teams had submitted their draft designs
when the competition closed on 13
September 1996, twenty-seven design
series for the “Ages and styles of Europe”
theme and seventeen for the “abstract/
modern” design theme.
The designers had to comply with detailed
technical specifications which included a
number of obligatory design features and a
wide range of advanced security features,
which will be incorporated to ensure that
the euro banknotes will be at least as well
protected against counterfeiting as existing
banknotes. The technical specifications also
took into account the needs of the blind
and partially sighted.
The draft designs had to be sent to the EU
central bank which had nominated the
designer by 13 September 1996. After
having checked the draft designs for
printability and compliance with the
“design briefs”, the central banks sent the
accepted design series to a notary in
Frankfurt/Main. The notary removed all
remaining indications of authorship and
attributed a random three-digit number
to each draft design series before sending
them to the EMI on 24 September 1996.
At all subsequent stages of the selection
process the draft design series remained
anonymous.

On 26 and 27 September 1996 an
international jury consisting of renowned
experts in marketing, design (including
industrial design) and art history met at
the EMI under the chairmanship of the
Secretary General of the EMI. The jury
members had been selected by the
President of the EMI from a list of
candidates submitted by the EU central
banks.
The jury appraised all forty-four designs
and recommended two shortlists
comprising the five best design series for
each of the two design themes. The
principal criteria for the jury’s appraisal
were creativity, aesthetics, style,
functionality, likely public perception and
acceptability. Subsequently, a public
consultation exercise was organised by an
experienced company, EOS Gallup Europe,
and carried out in fourteen Member States,
in order to gauge public opinion on the
ten shortlisted design series. The public
survey was conducted between 7 and 13
October 1996.
On 3 December 1996 the EMI Council
selected one of the ten shortlisted design
series, taking into account in particular the
advice of the jury and the results obtained
from the public consultation exercise. This
selection will be the basis for the final
designs which will be submitted to the
ECB Governing Council for decision. On
13 December 1996 the President of the
EMI informed the European Council at its
meeting in Dublin of the outcome of the
selection process. The European Council
welcomed the selection made by the EMI.
On that day, the selected design series
were presented to the public by the EMI
at two simultaneous press conferences in
Dublin and Frankfurt.

75

The EMI is currently carrying out the work
of developing the design sketches into the
final designs. This includes working with
the designer to facilitate the banknote
production and to ensure that all
requirements are met, for example the
avoidance of national bias and the
incorporation of security features.
Subsequently, the origination process that will turn completed designs into
printing plates - will begin and other
preparatory work will be undertaken to
ensure that the production process can
get under way in a timely manner. In
principle, all printing works of the countries
participating in the euro area from the
start of Stage Three and currently involved
in the production of national banknotes
can take part in the production of the
initial stock of euro banknotes. Other
practical issues related to the introduction
of the euro banknotes are currently being
addressed.
In 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB
will launch the printing process in order
for the euro banknotes to be ready to be

76

put into circulation by 1 January 2002 at
the latest. The exact date for the
introduction of the euro banknotes will be
announced before 1 January 1999.
In anticipation of the situation in which
euro banknotes will not be available at the
start of Stage Three, Article 52 of the
ESCB/ECB Statute obliges the NCBs of
the Member States participating in the
euro area to exchange their respective
national banknotes at par value. Against
this background, and together with the
national banking and finance communities,
the EMI is currently exploring ways in
which to organise the exchange of
banknotes in Stage Three. At present, the
bulk of retail transactions in foreign
banknotes are handled by commercial
banks and by specialist bureaux de change.
It will be necessary to assess how, after the
start of Stage Three, the exchange of
national banknotes circulating within the
euro area can be organised so as to
differentiate it from the exchange of
banknotes of countries not participating in
the euro area.

6 Accounting issues
The Treaty contains various provisions
requiring the publication of consolidated
financial data for the ESCB. In addition to
these, there will be regular consolidated
reports for the internal needs of the ESCB.
These reports will require a consolidation
of the assets and liabilities of the ECB with
those of the participating NCBs. For such
reports to be meaningful, the figures for
the ECB and the individual NCBs need to
be prepared on a harmonised basis.
In 1996 the EMI Council approved the
accounting principles for the financial
reporting of the ESCB. According to these
principles, the balance sheet will be based
on market values, but unrealised gains
arising from revaluation will not be
recognised as income. Unrealised losses
will be taken to the profit and loss account
if they exceed previous revaluation gains
registered in the revaluation account. Such
losses may only be reversed on subsequent
realisation and not against any future
unrealised gains. These principles combine
transparency with prudent recognition of
income and are appropriate for the nature
and conduct of central banks’ activities.
Application of these accounting principles
will be mandatory for all items material to
the operations of the ESCB, for all items
of the ECB’s financial statements, and for
the calculation of monetary income.
Nevertheless, NCBs might continue to
draw up and publish their financial
statements according to their own
accounting rules.
Further work will be undertaken during
1997 to develop the necessary techniques
so as to enable individual NCBs and the

ECB to adapt their accounting procedures
and systems in order to apply the accounting
principles for the financial reporting of the
ESCB. The reporting framework for the
ESCB will also be elaborated upon to
ensure that the harmonised accounting
data are properly reflected in all the
published and internal reports of the ESCB.
A related area of work concerns the
development of an appropriate method
for the determination of the income arising
from the performance of the ESCB’s
monetary policy function (monetary
income). This income is to be allocated
among the participating NCBs in
accordance with the provisions of the
Treaty. The EMI Council has come to the
conclusion that it is unlikely that the balance
sheet structures of participating NCBs will
permit, from the start of Stage Three, the
measurement of monetary income
according to the method provided for in
Article 32.2 of the ESCB/ECB Statute.
This method identifies monetary income
as being equal to the annual income derived
from earmarked assets held against
banknotes in circulation and deposit
liabilities to credit institutions (“direct
method”). Hence, preparatory work is
being undertaken for the implementation
of an alternative method which may be
applied under Article 32.3 of the Treaty
for a period of up to five years. Such an
alternative method will consist in calculating
monetary income by reference to a rate of
return specified according to a predetermined rule applied to the monetary
liabilities (“indirect method”). Further
research on a calculation method in line
with Article 32.2 will be pursued at a later
stage.

77

7 Information and communications systems
Information and communications systems
support is required for a number of
operational and policy functions to be
conducted in the ESCB context involving
the ECB and the national central banks.
Further progress in the definition of the
necessary information systems support has
meant that the basic outline of the future
ESCB’s information and communications
systems is emerging.
Following the establishment of a dedicated
project team at the start of 1996, a
Europe-wide open tender procedure was
carried out with the aim of identifying a
new secure high-capacity teleconference
system for the ESCB. In November the
EMI Council approved a technical solution
to provide the new teleconference services
for the ESCB. Further detailed negotiations
are taking place with the selected
equipment and services suppliers to
investigate the best way of extending the
new teleconference system beyond the
ESCB, in particular to the non-EU central
banks participating in the “Concertation
Group”.
For both the synchronous (real-time) and
the asynchronous exchange of data within
the ESCB, agreement has been reached
during 1996 on the main architectural
choices for the communications
infrastructure linking the ECB with the
national central banks. This common
infrastructure will carry the majority of the
information exchanges between the
institutions concerned. The functional and
technical specifications of the necessary
infrastructure are being elaborated and
the infrastructure is planned to be put in
place towards the end of 1997 in order to
allow testing of the different applications
that will be using this infrastructure to
commence shortly thereafter.

78

On the applications side, the primary
policy areas have finalised the user
requirements for the functioning of the
main policy instruments. By the end of
1996 specification work had reached a
stage that should allow development of
the necessary information systems support
for the conduct of decentralised monetary
policy open market operations based on
tender procedures as well as to enable the
monitoring of decentralised monetary
policy interventions based on bilateral
procedures and of foreign exchange
interventions to be carried out from the
start of Stage Three. Other needs for the
exchange of operational data among the
entities of the ESCB have been identified
and may give rise to further specific
application development.
A number of other business functions of
the ECB and the ESCB also require the
support of data exchange and data
processing systems. One example is the
interlinking of national RTGS systems in
the TARGET system. In 1997 the EMI will
provide a centralised test centre against
which the Interlinking components of the
national central banks will be tested. Other
areas on which work has focused include
provision of the necessary support for the
management of the ECB’s foreign exchange
assets, and systems to allow the smooth
exchange of statistical data among the
entities of the ESCB.
1996 has also brought additional insight
into the information and communications
systems requirements of the ECB itself.
Identification of the relevant issues has led
to the establishment of a number of
project definitions for which more detailed
plans will now be outlined and
implemented in the months ahead so as to
ensure that the ECB will be able to
commence its operations from the
beginning of Stage Three.

8 Banking supervision
In Stage Three prudential supervision will
remain a competence of the national
authorities and the supervisory framework
laid down at the EU level will not be
altered. Nevertheless, the Treaty and the
ESCB/ECB Statute assign to the ESCB/ECB
some functions related to the prudential
supervision of credit institutions. These
are explicitly referred to in the following:
■

Article 105 (5) of the Treaty, which
stipulates that the ESCB shall contribute
to the smooth conduct of policies
pursued by the competent authorities
relating to the prudential supervision of
credit institutions and the stability of
the financial system;

■

Article 25 (1) of the ESCB/ECB Statute,
which states that the ECB may offer
advice to and be consulted by the
Council, the Commission and national
authorities on the scope and
implementation of Community
legislation relating to the issues above;

■

Article 105 (6) of the Treaty, which
envisages the possibility of assigning to
the ECB - by virtue of a unanimous
decision by the Council - specific tasks
concerning policies relating to the
prudential supervision of credit
institutions and other financial
institutions (with the exception of
insurance undertakings).

The preparatory work of the EMI in this
field is intended to identify the possible
ways in which Article 105 (5) of the
Treaty and Article 25 (1) of the ESCB/
ECB Statute
could
actually
be
implemented as well as to make a
preliminary assessment of how the ECB
could define its position in respect of the
provision under Article 105 (6) of the
Treaty. Work on these aspects is under
way within the EMI with the assistance of
the Banking Supervisory Sub-Committee.

9 Legal issues
Legal work has concentrated on five areas:
secondary Community legislation, legal
convergence, project support, advisory
functions (see Chapter III Section 5) and
administrative matters. Some of the
highlights are addressed below.

9.1 Secondary Community legislation
The EMI co-operated with the European
Commission in the elaboration of
secondary Community legislation on the
introduction of the euro. On 11 June
1996 it transmitted to the Commission a
document containing building blocks for
the two EU Council Regulations in this
area, which the Commission proposed
and which were endorsed by the European
Council in December 1996.
One Council Regulation, based on
Article 235 of the Treaty, is intended to
be adopted shortly and to become
effective in 1997 and deals with issues
such as the replacement of the ECU, as
referred to in Article 109g of the Treaty
and as defined in Council Regulation (EC)
No. 3320/94, by the euro at a rate of one
to one, the continuity of contracts and
technical rules for the conversion rates,
including rounding. This Regulation will be
applicable in all Member States.
A second Council Regulation, based on
Article 109l (4) of the Treaty, is intended
to be adopted as soon as the participating
Member States are known and to become
effective on 1 January 1999. This Regulation
will be applicable in all Member States,
subject to Protocols Nos. 11 and 12 on
the United Kingdom and Denmark and
Article 109k (1) of the Treaty referring to
the status of Member States with a
derogation. It addresses matters such as
the substitution of the euro for the

80

currencies of the participating Member
States, transitional provisions with respect
to the national currency units and the issue
of banknotes and coins.
The EMI delivered an opinion on these
two pieces of secondary Community
legislation on 29 November 1996 in a
consultation procedure under Articles 109f
(6) and 109f (8) of the Treaty (see
Chapter III Section 5). Two issues still
need to be specified: the exact timing of the
introduction of euro banknotes and coins;
and the scope of provisions to enable the
redenomination in the euro unit of
outstanding debt of general government
denominated in the national currency units
of other participating Member States and
also of bonds and other forms of
securitised debt of other issuers which are
negotiable in the capital markets. Such
provisions will be included in the Council
Regulation based on Article 109l (4) of
the Treaty before the European Council
meeting in Amsterdam in June 1997.
In addition, the EMI formulated
recommendations
for
secondary
Community legislation under Articles 5.4
(statistical information), 19.2 (minimum
reserves) and 34.3 (sanctions) of the ESCB/
ECB Statute. This resulted in draft texts
of:
■

a Council Regulation (EC) concerning
the collection of statistical information;

■

a Council Regulation (EC) concerning
the application of minimum reserves;

■

a Council Regulation (EC) concerning
the powers of the ECB to impose
sanctions.

The EMI will advise the ECB to submit the
three draft Regulations in the form of
recommendations to the EU Council for

adoption under Article 106 (6) of the
Treaty and Article 42 of the ESCB/
ECB Statute. In order to advance the
adoption procedure, the EMI released the
documents to the Commission and the
Monetary Committee so as to allow
informal discussions to start.
The preparation of the three draft
Regulations was part of the EMI’s work on
the regulatory framework for the single
monetary policy in Stage Three, which,
under Article 4.2 of its Statute, the EMI was
required to prepare by the end of 1996.

9.2 Legal convergence
Member States are obliged, in accordance
with Article 108 of the Treaty, to eliminate
incompatibilities between their national
legislation, on the one hand, and the
Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute, on the
other. The EMI is required under Article
109j (1) of the Treaty and Article 7 of its
Statute periodically to assess, in addition
to the fulfilment of the economic
convergence criteria, this process of legal
convergence (as is the Commission). The
results of the 1996 assessment were laid
down in the report on “Progress towards
convergence 1996”, of November 1996.
The legal chapter of that report
distinguished between the statutes of the
NCBs and other legislation which may
need to be adapted in the light of Treaty
and ESCB/ECB Statute provisions.
With regard to the statutes of the NCBs, a
distinction was made between adaptations
in the area of central bank independence
and other adaptations to ensure the
necessary degree of integration of NCBs in
the ESCB. The EMI developed a list of
features of central bank independence of
an institutional, personal, functional and
financial nature which could serve as
guidance for national legislators when
adapting the statutes of NCBs in this field.
The EMI also identified certain provisions

in the statutes of NCBs which it considered
to be incompatible with Treaty and ESCB/
ECB Statute requirements on central bank
independence and which, in its view, should
therefore be adapted. Such adaptations
need to become effective at the latest at
the date of the establishment of the
ESCB/ECB.
Furthermore, the EMI pointed out the need
for statutes to be adapted to ensure the
necessary degree of integration of NCBs in
the ESCB in accordance with Article 14.3 of
the ESCB/ECB Statute. This Article states
that NCBs will become an integral part of
the ESCB and are required to comply with
the ECB’s guidelines and instructions. This
implies in particular that statutes of NCBs
should not contain any provisions which are
not compatible with the exclusive
competence of the ECB in certain areas
(e.g. authorisation of the issue of banknotes)
or which, if adhered to by an NCB, would
prevent such an NCB from complying with
rules adopted at the level of the ECB (e.g. on
the deployment of monetary policy
instruments). The adaptation of the statutes
of NCBs in this area needs to become
effective at the start of Stage Three or, for
Member States with a derogation or a
special status, at the start of their full
participation in Monetary Union. The EMI
will continue to act as a forum for an
exchange of views between NCBs in this
field and to refer to this issue in future
reports.
The timely adoption of the necessary
adaptations of national legislation is a point
of concern to the EMI. Whereas in almost all
Member States preparations are under way
to adapt the statutes of NCBs, no major
activities have been noted as far as the
scrutiny of other legislation on compatibility
with Treaty and ESCB/ECB Statute
requirements is concerned. As 1997 and
early 1998 are the periods in which such
adaptations would need to materialise,
legislative action should, where appropriate,
not be postponed for much longer.

81

10 Changeover to the euro
The EMI has continued to monitor progress
in the preparatory work for the
introduction of the euro, following the
adoption of the changeover scenario by
the European Council at its meeting in
Madrid in December 1995. The EMI
provides a forum for the exchange of
information between central banks on
four main topics: NCBs’ internal
preparatory work for the establishment of
the ESCB; changeover preparations by
financial market participants; euro-related
activities performed by the public
authorities; and the provision of
information on the changeover to the
general public. Taking into account the
national specificities in financial markets
and banking structures, the NCBs constitute
the main channel of dialogue regarding the
latter three areas between the monetary
authorities and financial market
participants. Furthermore, there is an
ongoing exchange of views between the
EMI, in co-operation with the NCBs, and
the banking and financial community to
assess the need for co-ordination at the
EU level concerning the process of the
changeover to the single currency.
In the course of the summer months of
1996 the EMI, through the intermediary
of the EU central banks, consulted the
banking and financial community on the
highly technical question of rounding in the
conversion of amounts expressed in the
different denominations of the single
currency that will be in use in the transitional
period of Stage Three of EMU. Conversion
will occur from euro to national
denominations and vice versa, as well as
between national denominations in use in
the countries participating in the euro
area. The intention was to assess the
extent to which rounding inaccuracies might
cause difficulties for the equivalence
between the different denominations of
the single currency and to determine

82

possible solutions to minimise such
problems.
In September 1996 the EMI Council
endorsed a set of guidelines which it
forwarded to the European Commission
as a further contribution by the EMI to the
draft legislative framework on the
introduction of the euro which was under
preparation at the time (see also Section
9.1). The objective of the guidelines was
to present a set of minimum requirements
which would significantly limit the scope
for the occurrence of rounding differences
when undertaking conversion operations.
The guidelines were not intended to
replace the rounding conventions already
in use in mono-currency or foreign exchange
transactions.
The following guidelines were laid down:
conversion rates shall contain six significant
figures; they shall be expressed in terms of
a sum of national currency units for one
euro; they shall never be rounded or
truncated; no use shall be made of inverse
conversion rates; for the computation of
conversions between two national
denominations, a fixed algorithm shall be
followed involving a division (rounded to
not less than three decimals) cum
multiplication of the euro conversion rates
of the two national denominations involved,
although alternative methods can be used
provided the result is exactly the same.
The Commission took these guidelines on
board in a draft EU Council Regulation on
some provisions relating to the
introduction of the euro. This Regulation
was endorsed by the European Council at
its Dublin meeting in December 1996
(see Section 9.1), with a view to giving
early guidance to financial markets so as to
ensure a smooth changeover to the single
currency.

In the period ahead, the EMI intends, inter
alia, to assess whether differences in
countries’ changeover actions could in any
way threaten the smooth functioning of
the euro area-wide money market which

will be created at the start of Stage Three.
Specific issues relating to the changeover
for Member States joining the euro area at
a later stage will also be investigated.

Chapter III

Other tasks
of the EMI

1 Central bank co-operation in the field of payment
systems
The EMI has continued to facilitate cooperation between the EU central banks
in three major areas of payment systems:
remote access; standardisation; and
electronic money.
These issues are analysed in the EMI’s
report on “Developments in EU payment
systems in 1996”, which will be released in
April 1997.

1.1

Remote access

In July 1995 the EMI Council agreed that,
within the framework of Community
legislation (in particular the Second Banking
Co-ordination Directive), credit institutions
would be entitled to gain remote access
to foreign interbank funds transfer systems
(IFTS) in Stage Two of EMU, although this
right could not be automatic. It was also
agreed that in order to allow for remote
access to IFTS, central banks would grant
access to settlement account facilities
to remote participants on a nondiscriminatory basis. Central banks may
also consider granting intraday credit,
provided that the risks they would incur
from remote participants do not exceed
those relating to domestic participants.
So far, remote access to IFTS has only
been granted in Belgium, Germany and the
Netherlands. One Luxembourg bank was
granted remote access to the Belgian
RTGS system ELLIPS in December 1996.
In Germany fifteen EU credit institutions
located near Germany’s borders use their
accounts held at Deutsche Bundesbank
branches mainly for cash operations and
funds transfers to German credit
institutions. Two participants, however,
use their accounts for the paper-based,
and one for the paperless, collection of
cheques. In the Netherlands, fourteen
foreign banks currently have access to the

88

Dutch RTGS system, primarily to facilitate
the execution of social security payments
abroad.
In December 1996 the EMI Council agreed
that remote access to IFTS and to central
bank account facilities would continue to
be granted in Stage Three of EMU in all EU
IFTS and to all EU remote applicants on a
non-discriminatory basis, as a consequence
of the Single Market legislation. It has yet
to be decided whether and under what
conditions remote access to intraday credit
in euro will be granted to credit
institutions.

1.2

Standardisation

The EMI considers that in view of the start
of Stage Three it will be important for it
to maintain contact with international
standardisation bodies, international
banking associations and other major
players in the field of cross-border money
transfers, in order to avoid - in those cases
where the efficiency of the market would
thereby be compromised - the
proliferation of non-compatible standards
for cross-border payments and to build
the TARGET system in such a way that it
will support standardisation to the largest
possible extent.
In the area of retail payments, the EMI has
continued to follow the work of the
European Committee for Banking
Standards. However, this work is
progressing at a slow pace.

1.3

Electronic money

In May 1994 the EMI published a report
on prepaid cards, which recommended
that only credit institutions should be
allowed to issue electronic purses.

This 1994 report was drafted at a time
when developments in prepaid card
schemes were at a preliminary stage. Since
then, in almost all EU countries a variety of
different prepaid card schemes has been
developed and started operation.
Furthermore, in addition to new prepaid
card schemes, another new means of
payment has emerged: electronic network
money. At present, two types of electronic
money can be distinguished: electronic
money stored on a chip card (card money)
which may be used face-to-face or via
telecommunications networks; and
electronic money stored on the hard disk
of a computer and used over networks
(network money).

Central banks are currently reviewing the
analysis of the effects electronic money
may have on the conduct of monetary
policy, the stability and integrity of payment
systems, and financial markets as a
whole, and are considering the 1994
recommendation in the light of recent
developments in prepaid cards and other
forms of electronic money. For the sake of
their analysis, central banks have broadly
defined electronic money as “an electronic
store of monetary value on a technical
device that may be widely used for making
payments, without necessarily involving
bank accounts in the transaction but acting
as a prepaid bearer instrument”.

89

2 Oversight of the ECU Clearing and Settlement System
The ECU Clearing and Settlement System
falls under the oversight of the EMI by
virtue of Article 109f (2), sixth indent, of
the Treaty. In 1996 the system processed
about 6,000 transactions per day with an
average turnover of ECU 50 billion.
The oversight of the ECU Clearing and
Settlement System has the fundamental
objective of seeking to ensure that the
ECU Banking Association (EBA), which
manages the system, takes the necessary
measures to ensure that the system does
not pose unacceptable risks either to
participants in the system or to the ECU
market or domestic markets in the EU.
Within this framework, the major line of
action of the EMI is to ensure that adequate
action is taken to improve the system’s
compliance with the safety standards laid
down in the 1990 Report on Interbank
Netting Schemes, which was prepared by
the central banks of the G-10 countries. In
this respect, the most important reforms
implemented in 1996 were the
establishment of a system of binding limits
on the multilateral net position which a
participant is allowed to incur at any
moment during the clearing process and
the revision of membership and exit
criteria.

2.1 The implementation of the new
risk control system
On 16 September 1996 the EBA fully
implemented ECU 3, the new system
providing for binding intraday limits,
whereby no payment can be delivered to
a receiving bank unless both the sending
and receiving banks have net positions
which are within the multilateral debit and
credit limits which have been established
for both banks. The multilateral limits now
form the new basis of the liquidity and

90

loss-sharing arrangements. Only if a bank
remains within its multilateral limits do
the clearing rules allow for the activation
of the liquidity-sharing and loss-sharing
arrangements. Therefore, the establishment
of ECU 3 was an essential element in
improving the compliance of the system
with the G-10 standards concerning credit
and liquidity risk management.
The new system may also increase
compliance with the safety standard which
focuses on the operational reliability of
technical systems and the availability of
backup facilities capable of completing
daily processing requirements. In this
respect, the EBA has implemented an
operational backup site where all its
essential equipment is duplicated. While
the previous system, ECU 2, had a
maximum capacity of 3,000 payments an
hour, the new system is able to process
12,000 payments an hour.

2.2

Legal issues

In 1996 the EBA requested advice from
external legal counsel to develop a legal
structure which would provide the ECU
Clearing and Settlement System with a
sound and enforceable legal basis and
which would also be suitable for Stage
Three. In this respect, new legal structures
were considered to regulate a multilateral
netting scheme without a central
counterparty.
The EBA has also expressed its intention
of introducing collateral as a means of
supporting the daily settlement, and
thereby improving compliance with the
G-10 standard concerning liquidity risk
management. Detailed proposals from the
EBA are expected in early 1997 and will
require in-depth analysis.

2.3 Settlement of the EBA Clearing
and Settlement System in Stage Three
In accordance with the “Report on
Minimum Common Features for Domestic
Payment Systems” of November 1993,
which states that all large-value payment
systems have to settle in central bank
money, the EBA has started discussions

with the EMI on issues related to the
settlement of the EBA Clearing and
Settlement System via TARGET in Stage
Three. A joint informal workshop with
representatives of the EBA and the EMI/
EU central banks has been established to
identify all issues related to the settlement
of the EBA Clearing and Settlement System
in Stage Three.

91

3 Co-operation in the field of banking supervision
In accordance with Article 109f (2), fourth
indent, of the Treaty the EMI also held
consultations in 1996 among banking
supervisory authorities on a number of
issues affecting the stability of financial
institutions and markets. The most
important topics were the internal control
systems of credit institutions and
supervisory early warning systems. As far
as central credit registers are concerned,
co-operation among the interested NCBs
has continued.

Internal control systems
Internal control systems (ICSs) have always
represented an important element of the
operational and management structure of
credit institutions. Over the past few years a
number of factors (the globalisation of
markets, the internationalisation of credit
institutions, financial innovation and the
development of information technology)
have rendered banking activity more complex.
Consequently, the internal control function
has become more important for credit
institutions and, for their part, supervisory
authorities are also putting more emphasis
on the adequacy of ICSs in relation to the
specific features of some recent banking
failures. Against this background, the issue of
the ICSs of credit institutions was analysed in
depth, with the main objective being the
identification of elements which could assist
in particular banking supervisors in assessing
the features and effectiveness of these
systems. The main outcome of the work
conducted in this area was the selection of a
set of basic principles relating to all the
relevant aspects of an ICS which are regarded
as being appropriate to promote the
establishment and maintenance of effective
ICSs at credit institutions. To this end, it was
necessary to strike a balance between the
need to ensure the adequacy of ICSs and the
need to avoid an excessive burden on credit

92

institutions. In addition, a specific merit of
the work was the provision of a
comprehensive overview of the main aspects
of an ICS.
The work focused on three main topics.
First, a common understanding of the
concept of an ICS was pursued which
draws upon the work undertaken in this
field by international organisations of
professionals. Second, a set of basic
principles relating to all the relevant aspects
of a sound ICS was identified. These
principles refer to an ICS as a whole and
four main related aspects, namely:
administrative organisation, risk control,
information systems and electronic
information systems. Most of these
principles mirror standards widely
accepted at the international level for
companies of all types, whereas others are
specifically devised for credit institutions.
Given the significance assumed by
information technology in the banking
business, particular attention was devoted
to the selection of principles for the
electronic storage and use of data. Third,
consideration was given to the role of the
various bodies involved in the field of ICSs.
The crucial role of the decision-making
bodies of a credit institution (board of
directors and senior management) is
underlined. The board of directors bears
ultimate responsibility for ensuring an
effective ICS, whereas senior management
is in charge of implementing the strategy
set by the board in this area. Particular
reference is made to the positive role
which, in some countries and depending
on certain conditions, could be played by
an audit committee as an advisory body to
the board. Furthermore, the important
function carried out by internal auditors,
as well as the role which should be played
by external auditors in favouring the
adoption and maintenance of adequate
ICSs at credit institutions, is spelt out.

Given the importance of the subject, the
report prepared on the matter, following
the approval of the EMI Council, was sent
for consideration to the Basle Committee
on Banking Supervision and the Banking
Advisory Committee, as well as to a
number of non-EU banking supervisory
authorities.

Supervisory early warning systems
By way of fact-finding, the state of the art
for supervisory early warning systems
(EWSs), notably the methods used by EU
banking supervisors to detect, at an early
stage, financially fragile credit institutions,
has been analysed. The survey showed
that there are no fundamental differences
in the basic approach to early warning
methods. The entire day-to-day
supervisory process is geared towards the
identification of financially fragile
institutions and is based on comprehensive
qualitative and quantitative information on
all aspects which could potentially give rise
to financial fragility in individual institutions.
This reflects the fact that financial fragility
may result from any of the wide range of
risks inherent in banking.
As regards the main features of EWSs
used by banking supervisors, the following
elements deserve consideration. First, early
warning is performed through the
identification of actual or potential
breaches of quantitative and qualitative
standards. Less “tangible” and less formal
aspects may also be important in the early
warning process. Second, peer group
comparisons play a central role in the
evaluation of institutions. Peer group
analysis is conducted to alert supervisors
to a deterioration in the situation of an
individual institution’s position relative to
its peer group. Third, in all EU countries
supervisors use a host of quantitative data
(e.g. relating to capital, asset quality,
profitability,
liquidity,
business
concentration (e.g. large exposures and

sectoral exposures)) and qualitative data
(e.g. on the quality of the management,
internal control systems, business strategy).
However, data used differ in detail and
differences were observed in particular in
the use of macroeconomic data in the
supervisory early warning process.
Although there are no fundamental
differences in the underlying approach to
early warning, the degree of formalisation
of the risk assessment varies. Some
countries have developed more formalised
EDP-based risk assessment systems.
However, even where formalised EWSs
are used, the “output” of the systems
(ratings, rankings or assessments of
institutions) does not lead to an automatic
supervisory reaction because judgmental
or subjective factors may be of crucial
importance in the supervisory process.
These systems represent one of the many
tools which serve the early warning process.
Given that asset quality is crucial for the
financial soundness of credit institutions,
definitions of both “bad and doubtful
loans” and requirements for value
adjustments (“provisioning”) were analysed
in greater detail in the context of the
survey. In this respect, the EU accounting
Directives form the basis of national
legislation and accounting practice in all
Member States. However, the EU
Directives do not provide a specific
definition of the concept of bad and
doubtful loans. Specific definitions of bad
and doubtful loans and specific
requirements for provisioning are laid down
in Member States’ legislation. Legislation
and practices vary in a number of respects.
In general, some countries appear to follow
a more prescriptive approach and oblige
credit institutions to make a specified level
of provisioning if certain conditions are
fulfilled, while other countries rely more
heavily on the credit institutions’
management and their external auditors’
assessment.

93

The survey serves as a reference document
for internal use by the EU banking
supervisory authorities and has contributed
to co-operation in the further
development of supervisory early warning
systems, an area in which follow-up work
is envisaged. A more detailed investigation
of the use of macroeconomic data in the
supervisory early warning process and of
developments in industry-wide practices
concerning provisions for bad and doubtful
loans is planned.

Central credit registers
Co-operation among the central credit
registers currently existing in seven Member
States (Belgium, Germany, Spain, France,
Italy, Austria and Portugal) continued. The
main objective in this field remains the
opening-up of the registers on a crossborder basis in order to grant reporting
institutions access to the data stored in all
the EU registers. As regards the legal
framework, in Portugal the regulation
concerning the national register was
amended in 1996 to lift the legal obstacles
preventing it from providing information
on a cross-border basis. Therefore, at this
stage, there are no legal restrictions to the
opening-up of the registers on a crossborder basis in four countries, whereas in
the remaining three the respective NCBs
remain committed to promoting the
adoption of the necessary measures to
remove the legal obstacles at the earliest
opportunity.

94

The tools and modalities used by the
registers are subject to a periodic updating
and revision process. This is a necessary
step to ensure that the systems maintain a
satisfactory degree of effectiveness in the
context of the continuous evolution of the
financial world. Co-operation between
registers aims to monitor this process with
a view to pursuing the possible convergence
of its main features, where appropriate. In
this context, the question of the possible
inclusion in the registers of data concerning
the credit risk associated with derivatives
transactions has been addressed. This was
triggered by the fact that in three countries
it was recently decided to extend, although
in different forms, the reporting areas of
the registers to include derivatives
operations. Co-operation on this specific
subject represents an opportunity for the
other registers to obtain useful information
for their reflections on the possibility of
following the same path.
Credit registers are a valuable source of
information which can also be exploited
from a statistical perspective with a view
to analysing some aspects of national
financial systems. A first attempt in this
direction was made by conducting a survey
in four EU countries which focused on the
relationship between credit institutions
and customers and, in particular, on the
issue of “multiple exposures”, namely a
situation in which the financial needs of an
enterprise are met by a large number of
financial institutions.

4 Administration of EMS mechanisms and Community
loans
The EMI’s operational tasks relate to the
administration of the mechanisms of the
European Monetary System (EMS) - the
Very Short-Term Financing mechanism
(VSTF), the Short-Term Monetary Support
mechanism and the creation of ECUs for
the purpose of implementing the EMS
Agreement - and the administration of
borrowing and lending operations
concluded by the Community under the
Medium-Term Financial Assistance
mechanism.

EMS mechanisms
The EMI carries out operations associated
with the creation, utilisation and
remuneration of official ECUs. Official
ECUs are issued to EU central banks
against the contribution of 20% of their
gross gold holdings and US dollar reserves
through revolving swaps. Contributions
are compulsory for the EU central banks
participating in the ERM and voluntary for
EU central banks not participating in the
ERM. The swap operations are renewed
every three months, which allows for the
necessary adjustments to be made in
order to: first, ensure that each EU central
bank’s contribution to the EMI continues
to represent at least 20% of its gold and
US dollar reserve holdings at the end of
the month preceding the renewal date;
and, second, take account of changes in the
price of gold and in the US dollar exchange
rate vis-à-vis the official ECU. The results
of these operations are shown in the
Annual Accounts enclosed with this Report.
In 1996 the Finnish markka joined the
ERM with effect from 14 October, and
the Italian lira resumed participation in the
mechanism with effect from 25 November.
Since both countries had already been
participating in the swap mechanism on a

voluntary basis, their ERM entry had no
impact on the EMI’s ECU swap operations.
The amount of official ECUs issued by the
EMI under the latest three-month swap
transaction, which took place on 10 January
1997, reached ECU 60.1 billion.
Compared with January 1996, the stock of
ECUs increased by nearly ECU 6 billion.
The increase was mainly due to: first, a rise
in the USD/ECU exchange rate; and,
second, an increase in the total volume of
US dollar reserve contributions from the
EU central banks participating in ECU
swap operations with the EMI.
In addition to the creation of official ECUs,
the EMI records in its books transfers of
ECUs among the participating central banks
and Other Holders. In 1996 such transfers
resulted in a decrease of ECU 7.98 billion
to 63.5 million in net ECU positions. The
remaining balance reflects the acquisition
of ECUs through swap operations of the
Swiss National Bank with two EU central
banks, given its status of “Other Holder” of
ECUs. The ECU mobilisation mechanism
has not been activated since 1986. No use
was made of the VSTF in 1996, nor of the
Short-Term Monetary Support mechanism.
The latter has not been activated since
1974.

Community loans
In accordance with Article 109f (2) of the
Treaty and Article 11 of Council Regulation
(EEC) No. 1969/88 of 24 June 1988, the
EMI administers the borrowing and lending
operations concluded by the Community
under the Medium-Term Financial
Assistance mechanism. The mechanism
provides for loans to be granted to
Member States which are experiencing or
are seriously threatened by difficulties in
their balance of payments (current or

95

capital account). The EMI effects payments
arising from these borrowing and lending
operations. It verifies the maturity dates
laid down in the borrowing and lending
contracts for the payment of interest and
repayment of the principal and reports to
the Commission on the operations carried
out for the account of the EU.

In 1996 the EMI continued to receive
from borrowers, namely Greece and Italy,
and to pay to creditors vis-à-vis the
Community the sums due in respect of
capital, interest, commission and expenses
on outstanding loans. The following table
shows the total of outstanding Community
lending operations as at 31 December
1995 and 1996.

5 Advisory functions
Article 109f (6) of the Treaty and Article
5.3 of the EMI Statute require that the
EMI be consulted by the Council of the
European Union or the responsible national
authorities, as appropriate, on any
proposed Community or national legislation
within its field of competence. The limits
and conditions of consultations on draft
legislation by national authorities are set
out in Council Decision 93/717/EEC of 22
November 1993. Article 1 of this Decision
states that ”Member States shall consult
the EMI on any draft legislative provisions
within its field of competence pursuant to
Article 109f of the Treaty and in particular
on:
■

currency legislation, the status of the
ECU and means of payment;

■

the status and powers of national central
banks and the instruments of monetary
policy;

■

the collection, compilation and
dissemination of monetary, financial,
banking and balance of payments
statistics;

■

clearing and payment systems, in
particular for cross-border transactions;

■

rules applicable to financial institutions,
insofar as they influence the stability of
financial institutions and markets”.

Sixteen requests for consultations were
received in 1996. Six came from the
Council of the European Union, three
were received from the European
Commission and seven originated from
national authorities.
The table below summarises the
consultation procedures in which the EMI
delivered opinions.

The EMI’s benchmark for the assessment
of the consultations was primarily the
compatibility of the proposed legislation
with the Treaty, whilst the potential impact
on future arrangements for Stage Three of

98

EMU and, in appropriate cases, the question
as to whether the stability of financial
institutions and markets would be affected
by the legislation were also examined.

6 Monitoring of compliance with the prohibition on
monetary financing and on privileged access
In 1996 the EMI continued to monitor
central banks’ fulfilment of their obligations
under Articles 104 and 104a of the Treaty
and Council Regulations (EC) Nos. 3603/
93 and 3604/93. 1 The European
Commission monitors Member States’
compliance with these provisions.
In 1996 the Treaty requirements continued
to be largely respected by the EU central
banks. Remaining imperfections which had
appeared in the transition to the new
arrangements, as well as technical problems
which had occurred in the implementation

of new regulations, were finally corrected
in the course of 1996 and at the beginning
of 1997.
The EMI also monitors central banks’
secondary market purchases of public
sector debt instruments. Although the
acquisition of debt instruments of the
public sector in the secondary market is in
general in compliance with the Treaty,
such purchases must not be used
to circumvent the objective of Treaty
Article 104.

7 Co-operation with other institutions
The EMI has continued its close cooperation with other bodies of the
European Union in a number of forms and
at a number of levels. The President of the
Council of the European Union and a
member of the European Commission
have participated in meetings of the EMI
Council, and the President of the EMI has
attended meetings of the Council of the
European Union whenever matters relating
to the objectives and tasks of the EMI have
been discussed. This has included his
attendance at informal ECOFIN Council
meetings, where issues related to ERM II
and the determination of the monetary
and exchange rate policy co-operation
between the euro area and other
EU Member States (see Chapter II Section
2.1) were discussed. The President also
attended the EMU parts of the June and
December meetings of the European
Council. He has also appeared before the
European Parliament to present the EMI’s
Annual Report 1995 to a plenary session
in June 1996 and the EMI’s report on
“Progress towards convergence 1996”, to
the Sub-Committee on Monetary Affairs
in November 1996.
At the working level, senior representatives
of the EMI have regularly attended the
meetings of the Monetary Committee as
observers. Close working relationships exist
with the competent Directorates General
of
the
European
Commission,
representatives of which also attend
meetings of some EMI working groups. In

100

the field of statistics the EMI has further
enhanced its co-operation procedures with
EUROSTAT (the European Commission’s
statistical office) and is represented by
three members in the Committee on
Monetary, Financial and Balance of
Payments Statistics. Furthermore, the EMI
has continued to co-operate with the
national Mint Directors representing the
institutions which are responsible for
producing the coins which will circulate
alongside the euro banknotes in Stage
Three.
With regard to contacts with institutions
outside the Community, the “concertation
procedure” has remained a valuable forum
for exchanging data among foreign exchange
experts from central banks in the EU
and those in Canada, Japan, Norway,
Switzerland and the United States on
exchange
market
developments,
intervention and other official foreign
exchange transactions. Consultations on
matters of common interest between the
EMI and the central banks of Norway and
Switzerland have continued, and a good
relationship exists with the IMF and the
World Bank. Important links have also
been retained with the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS). In 1996
the EMI also started to establish
relationships with the central banks of the
associated Central and Eastern European
countries (CEECs) and other applicant
countries.

1. Accounting Policies
1.1 The annual accounts were drawn up
in accordance with accounting principles
established by the Council of the EMI
pursuant to Article 17.3 of its Statute, and
are expressed in official ECUs.
1.2 Although the EMI, as a body of the
European Communities, is not subject to
national laws and regulations on accounting
practices, its accounting policies follow
internationally accepted accounting
principles, unless specific EMI issues require
otherwise. Notwithstanding the limited
life of the EMI, the accounts have been
prepared on a “going concern” basis.
1.3 EMS-related assets and liabilities are
shown at cost. Short-term discount
securities are shown at cost plus accrued
interest. Securities, other than short-term
discount securities and financial fixed assets,
are shown at year-end market value.
Financial fixed assets are shown at
acquisition cost less any provision for a
permanent diminution in value. All other
financial assets and liabilities are shown at
nominal value.
1.4 Tangible assets are valued at cost less
depreciation. Depreciation is calculated
on a straight-line basis, beginning in the
quarter after acquisition, over the expected
economic lifetime of an asset, namely:
Equipment, furniture
and plant in building

10 years

Computers, related
hardware, software
and vehicles

4 years

1.5 Apart from EMS-related assets and
liabilities and financial fixed assets, foreign
currency translation of balance sheet items
into ECUs is based on the official rates
published by the European Commission
applying at 31 December 1996, or
otherwise on closing market rates for that
date. Foreign currency transactions
reflected in the Profit and Loss Account
are valued at the average of daily official
rates for the year 1996. Translation of
financial fixed assets denominated in
foreign currencies is at the spot rates of
exchange ruling on the dates of their
acquisition.
1.6 Income and expenses are recognised
on an accruals basis. Unrealised gains arising
from the revaluation of assets vis-à-vis the
purchase price are not recognised as income
but taken into a revaluation account;
unrealised losses are charged against
previous unrealised gains in the revaluation
account and any remaining losses charged
against profit.
1.7 In accordance with Article 17.4 of
the Statute, the Council has appointed
C & L Treuarbeit Deutsche Revision as
independent external auditors.

107

2. Notes on the Balance Sheet
2.1 EMS-related assets and liabilities
These items relate to the three-month
revolving swaps of official ECUs created in
exchange for EU central banks’
contributions to the EMI of 20% of their
gold and US dollar reserves. These
operations are described in Chapter III
Section 4 of the Report. The respective
assets and liabilities are shown in the EMI’s
books. The entries do not imply any
interest payments or receipts. Interest on
official reserves swapped for ECUs
continues to accrue to the underlying
owners. Interest on ECU holdings arising
out of swaps only becomes due where a
central bank’s holdings exceed its forward
ECU liabilities; in such cases, payments are
covered by interest due from central
banks whose forward liabilities in ECUs
exceed their holdings of ECUs.

2.2 Other assets
II (1) Cash and bank sight accounts: Working
cash balances were held on a current
account in Deutsche Mark, in which
currency almost all of the EMI’s day-to-day
transactions are payable. This account was
used exclusively to deal with payments
and receipts relating to the day-to-day
administration of the EMI. Other
uninvested cash balances were held on a
one-day notice interest-bearing account in
Deutsche Mark.
II (2) Time deposits: As stated in the
Annual Report for 1995, ECU 597.2
million of the resources contributed by
the EU central banks pursuant to Article
16.2 of the Statute of the EMI was placed
in time deposits in January 1995 at a fixed
term of three years to generate the income
deemed necessary to cover the EMI’s
administrative expenses. These deposits
constitute a financial fixed asset of the
108

EMI. As at 31 December 1996, shortterm deposits of a further ECU 30.8
million of the EMI’s cash balances were
held.
II (3) Securities: Other cash balances were
invested from time to time in Treasury
Bills of the Federal Republic of Germany
or in discount securities issued by
the Bank for International Settlements.
No such securities were held at
31 December 1996.
II (4) Tangible assets: Net of cumulative
depreciation of ECU 4.8 million these
comprised, at year-end:
ECU
Special installations

1996
3,632,708

1995
4,717,153

“Special Installations” comprises the costs
of special additions and enhancements to
the standard fittings and capital plant and
equipment within the EMI’s premises in
the Eurotower building in Frankfurt am
Main required to meet its particular
operational needs.
II (5) Other assets: This item includes a
claim against the German Federal Ministry
of Finance in respect of recoverable value
added and other indirect taxes paid on
goods and services. Such taxes are
refundable under the terms of Article 3 of
the Protocol on the privileges and
immunities of the European Communities,
which also applies to the EMI by virtue of
Article 21 of its Statute.

2.3 Other liabilities
II (1) Creditors and other liabilities: This
item principally comprises payments due
to suppliers, together with income tax
deducted at source from salaries pending
payover to the European Communities,
and accumulated pension contributions
with interest thereon repayable to staff.
Members of the staff contribute to the
pension scheme a percentage of their
basic salary (matched by a contribution of
twice that amount by the EMI - see II(2)
below); the staff contribution is repayable
at the termination of the employment
contract together with accrued interest
thereon.
II (2) Provision for pensions and similar
obligations: This item comprises the
accumulated contributions of the EMI
towards the staff pension scheme. These
contributions are required to cover the
eventual cost of severance grants and any
ill-health pensions.
II (3) Other provisions: These comprise
funds set aside in respect of restoration of
the EMI’s premises at the end of its lease,
office rental and service charge payments
outstanding in respect of 1996, final
settlement of costs of work on establishing
the premises, and the production of the
Annual Report and the accounts for 1996.
II (4) Contributions from EU central banks:
These represent the contributions made
pursuant to Article 16.2 of the Statute by
the EU central banks, as detailed below.

II (5) Revaluation
account:
The
depreciation of the Deutsche Mark against
the ECU during 1996 resulted in an
unrealised loss in the net value of assets
held in, or denominated in, Deutsche
Mark, which has been partly charged against
the previous gains taken into this account.
The balance has been charged against
profit (see Note 1.6 under “Accounting
Policies” and Note 3.4 below).
II (6) General reserve fund: This represents
accumulated undistributed profits from
previous years. See also Note 3.5 below.
II (7) Surplus for the year: See Note 3.5
below.

3.1 Income

3.3 Extraordinary income

Interest income: This item represents
interest of ECU 43.5 million earned on
the time deposits and of ECU 1.0 million
from investment of cash balances (see
Notes under “Other assets”).

This item represents extraordinary income
arising mainly from the release of provisions
made at end-1995 in respect of
anticipated expenditure arising in that year
that are no longer required.

3.2 Expenses

3.4 Valuation loss

Staff costs: This item relates to salaries and
general allowances (ECU 15.6 million), and
to employer’s contributions to pensions
and health and accident insurance
(ECU 2.6 million), in respect of permanent
staff employed by the EMI. Salaries and
allowances of staff, including emoluments
of holders of senior management positions,
are modelled in essence on, and
comparable to, the remuneration scheme
of the European Communities.

Unrealised losses in the net value of assets
held or denominated in Deutsche Mark
that were not covered by the revaluation
account balance have been charged against
profit (see Note II (5) under “Other
liabilities”).

The average number of permanent staff
employed during 1996 was 202, compared

permanent staff were recruited and 9 staff
ceased to be employed.
Other administrative expenses: These cover
all other current expenses, viz. rents,
maintenance of premises and equipment,
goods and equipment of a non-capital
nature, professional fees, and other services
and supplies, together with the expenses
involved in recruitment, relocation and
installation of staff.

3.5 Allocation of surplus
Pursuant to Article 17.5 of the Statute of
the EMI, any surplus of the EMI shall be
transferred in the following order:
(a) an amount to be determined by the
Council of the EMI shall be transferred to
the general reserve fund of the EMI;
(b) any remaining surplus shall be
distributed to the national central banks in
accordance with the key referred to in
Article 16.2. 1

1

At its meeting on 4 March 1997, the Council determined that the entire surplus for the year 1996 should be
transferred to the general reserve fund.

President and Council

Frankfurt am Main

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the European Monetary
Institute. The Management of the European Monetary Institute is responsible for the
preparation of the accounts. It is our responsibility to form an independent opinion on
these accounts based on our audit, and to report our opinion to you.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Auditing. An
audit includes examinations, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the accounts. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the European Monetary Institute’s circumstances and
adequately disclosed.
In our opinion, the financial statements, which have been prepared under accounting
policies set out in Section 1 of the notes on the accounts of the European Monetary
Institute, give a true and fair view of the financial position of the European Monetary
Institute at 31 December 1996 and the results of its operations for the year then
ended.

Glossary
Bilateral central rate: the official exchange rate between any pair of ERM member currencies,
around which the ERM fluctuation margins are defined.
Central credit register (CCR): information system designed to provide commercial credit
institutions, central banks and other supervisory authorities with data regarding the indebtedness of
firms and individuals vis-à-vis the whole banking system.
Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs): Community terminology used to refer
to those countries of central and eastern Europe with which the European Community has concluded
association treaties and with which the Community intends to begin accession negotiations after the
completion of the Intergovernmental Conference. These associated CEECs currently comprise
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, the Slovak
Republic and Slovenia.
Collateral: assets pledged as a guarantee for the repayment of the short-term liquidity loans
which credit institutions receive from the central banks, as well as assets received by central banks
from credit institutions as part of repurchase operations.
Concertation procedure: framework within which central bank foreign exchange experts (from
each EU Member State, Canada, Japan, Norway, Switzerland and the United States) participating in
the Concertation Group exchange information about market developments. The framework
provides for regular daily telephone sessions and periodic meetings of central bank experts.
Correspondent banking: arrangement under which one bank provides payment and other
services to another bank. Payments through correspondents are often executed through reciprocal
accounts (so-called nostro and loro accounts), to which standing credit lines may be attached.
Correspondent banking services are primarily provided across international boundaries but are also
known as agency relationships in some domestic contexts. A loro account is the term used by a
correspondent to describe an account held on behalf of a foreign bank; the foreign bank would in
turn regard this account as its nostro account.
Council (of the European Union): is made up of representatives of the Governments of the
Member States, normally the Ministers responsible for the matters under consideration (therefore
often referred to as the Council of Ministers). The Council meeting in the composition of the Ministers
of Finance and Economy is usually referred to as the ECOFIN Council. In special circumstances, in
particular in the case of Article 109j of the Treaty, the Council meets in the composition of the
Heads of State or of Government. See also European Council.
EBA (ECU Banking Association): interbank organisation created in 1985 with the support of
European institutions with the task of achieving three objectives: to promote the use of the ECU in
financial and commercial transactions; to manage and develop the ECU Clearing and Settlement
System and to be a representative body and discussion forum for all matters related to the use of
the ECU.

114

ECB (European Central Bank): the ECB will have legal personality. It will ensure that the tasks
conferred upon the ESCB are implemented either by its own activities pursuant to its Statute or
through the national central banks. According to the Treaty the ECB shall have recourse to the
national central banks to carry out operations which form part of the ESCB to the extent deemed
possible and appropriate.
ECB Executive Board: the decision-making body of the ECB which will implement monetary
policy in accordance with the guidelines and decisions laid down by the ECB Governing Council. It will
be composed of the President, the Vice-President and two to four other members, appointed from
among persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary and banking
matters by common accord of the governments of the Member States of the euro area at the level
of the Heads of State or of Government, on a recommendation from the Council after it has
consulted the European Parliament and the ECB Governing Council.
ECB General Council: in addition to the ECB Governing Council and the ECB Executive Board,
the ECB’s third decision-making body. Composed of the ECB’s President, Vice-President and the
governors of the national central banks. It will perform the tasks deriving from the situation in which
not all EU Member States participate in the euro area right from the start.
ECB Governing Council: composed of the members of the ECB Executive Board and the
governors of the national central banks of the countries participating in the euro area; it will be the
supreme decision-making body of the ECB which will adopt the guidelines and take the decisions
necessary to ensure the performance of the tasks entrusted to the ESCB under the Treaty and the
ESCB Statute.
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): the Treaty describes the process of achieving
economic and monetary union in the EU in three stages. Stage One of EMU started in July 1990 and
ended on 31 December 1993: it was mainly characterised by the dismantling of all internal barriers
to the free movement of capital within the EU. Stage Two of EMU began on 1 January 1994. It
provided, inter alia, for the establishment of the European Monetary Institute, the prohibition of
monetary financing of and privileged access to financial institutions for the public sector, as well as for
the avoidance of excessive deficits. Stage Three will start on 1 January 1999 in accordance with the
decision pursuant to Article 109j (4), with the transfer of monetary competence to the ESCB and the
creation of the euro.
ECU (European Currency Unit): in its present definition (Council Regulation No. 3320/94 of
20 December 1994), the ECU is a basket made up of the sum of fixed amounts of twelve out of
the fifteen currencies of the Member States. Article 109g of the Treaty states that this composition
shall not be changed until the start of Stage Three. The value of the ECU is calculated as a weighted
average of the value of its component currencies. As official ECU, it serves, inter alia, as the
numeraire of the ERM and as a reserve asset for central banks. Official ECUs are created by the EMI
through three-month swap operations against one-fifth of the US dollar and gold assets held by the
fifteen EU central banks. Private ECUs are ECU-denominated financial instruments (e.g. bank
deposits or securities) which are based on contracts which, as a rule, make reference to the official
ECU. The “theoretical” value of the private ECU is defined on the basis of the value of the individual
components of the ECU basket. However, the use of the private ECU is different from that of the
official ECU and in practice the market value of the private ECU may diverge from its “theoretical”
basket value. The replacement of the private ECU by the euro at the rate of one to one will be laid
down in Article 2 of the Council Regulation on some provisions relating to the introduction of the
euro, which was endorsed by the European Council in Dublin on 13 and 14 December 1996.

115

EEA (European Economic Area) countries: the EU Member States and Iceland,
Liechtenstein and Norway.
Electronic purse: a reloadable multi-purpose prepaid card which may be used for small retail or
other payments instead of coins.
EMS (European Monetary System): established in 1979 in accordance with the Resolution of
the European Council on the establishment of the EMS and related matters of 5 December 1978.
The Agreement of 13 March 1979 between the central banks of the Member States of the
European Economic Community lays down the operating procedures for the EMS. The objective is to
create closer monetary policy co-operation between Community countries leading to a zone of
monetary stability in Europe. The main components of the EMS are: the ECU; the exchange rate and
intervention mechanism (ERM); and various credit mechanisms.
EMU: see Economic and Monetary Union.
ERM (Exchange Rate Mechanism): the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the
EMS defines the exchange rate of participating currencies in terms of a central rate vis-à-vis the ECU.
These central rates are used to establish a grid of bilateral exchange rates between participating
currencies. Exchange rates are allowed to fluctuate around bilateral central rates within fluctuation
margins. These margins have been set at +/- 15% since 2 August 1993. Pursuant to a bilateral
agreement between Germany and the Netherlands, fluctuation margins between the Deutsche Mark
and the Dutch guilder are maintained at +/- 2.25%. Adjustments of central rates are subject to
mutual agreement between all countries participating in the ERM.
ERM II: successor exchange rate arrangement to the present ERM, which will provide the
framework for exchange rate policy co-operation between the euro area and Member States not
participating in the euro area from the start of Stage Three. Membership will be voluntary;
nevertheless, EU Member States with a derogation can be expected to join the mechanism. The
basic principles and operational features were agreed at the Dublin European Council on 13 and
14 December 1996 and the related legal texts which will form the basis of the mechanism (a
European Council Resolution and an agreement between the ECB and non-euro area NCBs) are
currently under preparation.
ERM fluctuation margins: floor and ceiling of bilateral exchange rates, within which ERM
currencies are allowed to fluctuate.
ESCB (European System of Central Banks): the ESCB is composed of the ECB and the
national central banks of the Member States. Its primary objective will be to maintain price stability.
Its basic tasks are to define and implement the monetary policy of the euro area, to hold and
manage the official reserves of the participating Member States and conduct foreign exchange
operations and to promote the smooth operation of payment systems in the euro area. The ESCB
will also contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating
to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system.
euro: the name of the European currency adopted by the European Council at its meeting in Madrid
on 15 and 16 December 1995. It will be used instead of the generic term “ECU” used by the Treaty
to refer to the European Currency Unit.

116

euro area: area covering those Member States which have adopted the euro as the single currency
in accordance with the Treaty and in which a single monetary policy will be conducted under the
responsibility of the decision-making bodies of the ECB (ECB Governing Council; ECB Executive
Board).
European Commission: institution of the European Community which ensures the application of
the provisions of the Treaty, takes initiatives for Community policies, proposes Community
legislation and exercises powers in specific areas. In the economic policy area, the Commission
recommends broad guidelines for the economic policies in the Community and reports to the Council
on economic developments and policies. It monitors public finances and initiates the procedure on
excessive deficits. It consists of twenty members and includes two nationals from Germany, Spain,
France, Italy and the United Kingdom, and one from each of the other Member States.
European Council: provides the European Union with the necessary impetus for its
development and defines the general political guidelines thereof. It brings together the Heads of
State or of Government of the Member States and the President of the European Commission. See
also Council.
European Parliament: consists of 626 representatives of the citizens of the Member States. It is
a part of the legislative process, though with different prerogatives according to the procedures
through which EU law is to be enacted. In the framework of EMU, the Parliament has mainly
consultative powers. However, the Treaty establishes certain procedures for democratic accountability
of the ECB to the Parliament (presentation of the annual report, general debate on the monetary
policy, hearings to the competent parliamentary committees).
Fiduciary money: refers to banknotes and coins. These means of payment are termed “fiduciary”
because their value is based on the confidence and trust of the holder in the issuer of the currency.
Fixed rate tender: a tender procedure where the interest rate is specified in advance by the
central bank and participating counterparties bid the amount of money they want to transact at the
fixed interest rate. See also variable rate tender.
Foreign exchange swap: simultaneous spot and forward transactions of one currency against
another. The ESCB will execute open market monetary policy operations in the form of foreign
exchange swaps where the NCBs (or the ECB) buy (or sell) euro spot against a foreign currency and
at the same time sell (or buy) it back forward. This instrument will also be used in the management
of the ESCB’s foreign reserves.
Funds transfer system (FTS): a formal arrangement, based on private contract or statute law,
with multiple membership, common rules and standardised arrangements for the transmission and
the settlement of money obligations arising between the members.
IFTS (Interbank Funds Transfer System): funds transfer systems in which most of (or all)
participants are credit institutions.

117

Implementation package: in July 1996 the EMI Council approved the “Statistical requirements
for Stage Three of Monetary Union” (the “Implementation Package”). This publicly available working
document sets out in detail the statistics which will be required by the ECB in defining and conducting
the single monetary policy. While dealing principally with money and banking and balance of
payments statistics, it also covers other financial statistics, price and cost and government finance
statistics, and background economic statistics.
Interlinking mechanism: one of the components of the architecture of the TARGET system. The
term Interlinking is used to designate the infrastructures and the procedures which link domestic
RTGS systems in order to process cross-border payments within TARGET.
Intervention at the limits: compulsory intervention carried out by central banks the currencies
of which are respectively at the floor and ceiling of their ERM fluctuation margins.
Intra-marginal intervention: intervention carried out by a central bank to influence the
exchange rate of its currency within its ERM fluctuation margins.
Large-value payments: payments, generally of very large amounts, which are mainly exchanged
between banks or between participants in the financial markets and usually require urgent and timely
settlement.
Loss-sharing rule (or loss-sharing agreement): an agreement between participants in a
transfer system or a clearing house arrangement regarding the allocation of any loss arising when one
or more participants fail to fulfil their obligation; the arrangement stipulates how the loss will be
shared among the parties concerned in the event the agreement is activated.
Monetary Committee: a consultative Community body, composed of two members appointed
by each Member State in their personal capacity (normally one from the government and one from
the central bank) and two representatives appointed by the European Commission. It was created in
1958 on the basis of Article 105 of the EEC Treaty. In order to promote co-ordination of the
policies of Member States to the full extent needed for the functioning of the internal market, Article
109c of the Treaty lists a set of areas where the Monetary Committee contributes to the
preparation of the work of the Council. At the start of Stage Three (Economic and Monetary Union),
the Monetary Committee will be dissolved and an Economic and Financial Committee will be created
instead.
Monitoring Group: group composed of foreign exchange experts from the EU central banks
who review on a regular basis current economic and monetary developments and policies in order
to assess the functioning of the EMS.
Multi-purpose prepaid card: a prepaid card which can be used at the outlets of several service
providers for a wide range of purposes, which has the potential to be used on a national or
international scale but may sometimes be restricted to a certain area. Also known as an electronic
purse.
Net settlement system (NSS): a funds transfer system whose settlement operations are
completed on a bilateral or multilateral net basis.

118

Quick tenders: tender procedure used by the ESCB mainly for fine-tuning operations when it is
deemed desirable to have a rapid impact on the liquidity situation in the market. Quick tenders are
executed within a time frame of one hour and are restricted to a limited set of counterparties.
Realignment: change in the ECU central rate and bilateral central rates of one or several currencies
participating in the ERM.
Re-denomination of securities: the denomination of a security is the currency in which the par
value of the security is expressed (in most cases, the face value of a certificate). Re-denomination
refers to a procedure through which the original denomination of a security, issued in national
currency, is changed into the euro at the irrevocably fixed conversion rate.
Remote access to an IFTS: the facility for a credit institution established in one country (“home
country”) to become a direct participant in an interbank funds transfer system (IFTS) established in
another country (“host country”) and, for that purpose, to have a settlement account in its own name
with the central bank in the host country, if necessary, without having established a branch in the host
country.
Reverse transaction: an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under a
repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.
RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement) system: a settlement system in which processing and
settlement take place on an order-by-order basis (without netting) in real time (continuously). See
also TARGET system.
Scriptural money: all money in book-entry form and therefore not circulating in the form of
banknotes and coins.
Second Banking Co-ordination Directive: adopted on 15 December 1989 (89/646/EEC),
which deals with the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the
taking-up and pursuit of the business of EU-based credit institutions. It amends the First Banking Coordination Directive adopted in 1977 (77/780/EEC).
Settlement agent: an institution that manages the settlement process (e.g. the determination of
settlement positions, monitoring the exchange of payments, etc.) for transfer systems or other
arrangements that require settlement.
Settlement risk: general term used to designate the risk that settlement in a transfer system will
not take place as expected. This risk may comprise both credit and liquidity risk.
Standard tender: a tender procedure to be used by the ESCB in its regular open market
operations. Standard tenders are carried out within a time frame of 24 hours. All counterparties
fulfilling the general eligibility criteria are entitled to submit bids in standard tenders.
TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer)
system: payment system consisting of one real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system in each of the
Member States participating in the euro area at the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary
Union. The national RTGS systems will be interconnected through the Interlinking mechanism so as to
allow same-day cross-border transfers throughout the euro area. RTGS systems of non-euro area
Member States may also be connected to TARGET, provided that they are able to process euro.

119

Treaty: the term refers to the Treaty establishing the European Community. The Treaty was signed
in Rome on 25 March 1957 and entered into force on 1 January 1958. It established the European
Economic Community (EEC) and was often referred to as the “Treaty of Rome”. The Treaty on
European Union was signed in Maastricht (therefore often referred to as the “Maastricht Treaty”) on
7 February 1992 and entered into force on 1 November 1993. It amended the EEC Treaty, which
is now referred to as the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Variable rate tender: a tender procedure whereby the counterparties bid both the amount of
money they want to transact with the central bank and the interest rate at which they want to enter
into the transaction. See also fixed rate tender.
VSTF (Very Short-Term Financing): EMS credit facility between central banks for financing
interventions in ERM currencies.
